00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 so people welcome to one 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.629
 new video and at the same time too 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:09.269
 a new series what that is to come 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.139
 First of all, I'll get the idea for you first 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.700
 that series 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.740
 I had that a good month ago 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.540
 but then decided against it 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 to do that in the 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.230
 Gameplay simply played too defensively 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.949
 I do not feel that way anymore 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.779
 liked 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.250
 I was not sure anymore 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.170
 arrive well now or will that be sooner 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.820
 arrive less well and then I have 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.939
 I left it now but before two 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.369
 three days comment proposal for yours 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.680
 Choosing a qual get the dazzle me 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.630
 It's best to come here now 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:39.090
 the one who wrote is 30 kids 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.969
 channels with the humor 12 onto the user- 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.390
 without dying but you are allowed to 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:44.430
 to be revived 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.030
 This proposal has me directly 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.920
 remembered in my idea 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.829
 and there this comment from the one 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.320
 somehow 20 or 30 thumbs up 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:57.210
 definitely had a lot telling me 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.010
 of course hey that people want to see that 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.989
 could arrive well that is well received 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 In any case, want to see that people 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.290
 and my idea is this suggestion 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.519
 is pretty similar I thought 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.960
 Now I just do it now 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.939
 we'll see now I have that now 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.439
 first gameplay bludgeoned out of it so 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.720
 that here what you see here is 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.850
 also directly the first gameplay to this 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.580
 series of comments for yours was one 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.540
 qual was yes 30 kids fun twelfth channels 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:23.159
 without dying but reviving 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.479
 this series is now but because with 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.119
 reviving it is just too easy 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.710
 in battlefield there you can 50.0 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.710
 to have fun with that is easy too 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:33.420
 simple and this series is like that now 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.450
 Here I am playing with, for example 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.369
 in the 16 m 16 20 kills without dying 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.170
 but really without dying myself 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.579
 may not be revived if I 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.920
 then it is over 

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:46.409
 So I have to do 20 kills in a row 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.049
 without falling over without dying and allowed 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.460
 not being revived is one 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.899
 a bit more demanding but that 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.970
 I also need what I feel so 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.950
 last months on a channel always like that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.229
 a bit was missing was such a 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.540
 series where I play well where do I go from 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:02.520
 where i show how i bet a lot of games 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.469
 correct and not your choice my smoking 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.509
 nonsense make soldiers in the focal point 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:09.239
 Most of the time we only do one 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.649
 nonsense and do not play properly and 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:12.569
 I just missed that and that 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.410
 Now this series is now possible 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.510
 write 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.740
 you like how it would arrive me 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.270
 really interested and would me too 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.800
 happy if it arrives well because of me 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.600
 I need a series where I just 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:24.120
 if you can give it a go and 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.920
 not just always doing something like that 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.060
 as I have so far so yes I had 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.770
 just the feeling i make out of mine 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.930
 channel now quasi euro was a qual 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.240
 soldiers in the focal point and I think that 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:35.550
 The series still fulfills that 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:37.380
 third part of it where I am then too 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.580
 just nice to play that beautiful 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.110
 is and it is a bit 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.610
 it is a little more demanding 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.830
 Challenge and I need it too 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.630
 at battlefield was definitely 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.220
 Battlefield is already pretty 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.650
 long outside and challenges are 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.340
 always good to keep on having fun 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.560
 the thing has 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.540
 and yes, I think everything is said 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.400
 still good with the weapons 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.110
 Of course I'm running here in the first one 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.790
 gameplay with the 16 in the round 

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.470
 standard weapon a strong weapon 

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.790
 of course I will also other weapons 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.590
 I 'll take worse weapons too 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.940
 take weapons that are not played so often 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.190
 So I will not do this here 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:09.840
 every gameplay with the 16 or with 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.440
 the ica I will also weapons 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:17.570
 wrap up like for example the pp 2003 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.260
 what else is there in any case 

00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:21.420
 worse weapons and not just the ones 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.760
 enough weapons as it is always called on 16 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:25.530
 Air Guns Loops the play 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.600
 No, I'll do nothing like that I'll 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:29.100
 always take my other weapons up 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.840
 so all through but I think so too 

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:33.180
 not that i will play any weapon 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.920
 So with the us soder with the duration with 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.030
 to become any barren shotguns 

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.720
 I suppose most likely 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.430
 do not do it 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.140
 that does not make me enjoy playing 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.150
 and probably not to 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:45.090
 watch well the game face is over 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.989
 I believe I am at 23 kills or so 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.640
 died 

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:49.080
 on the server that was now so 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.760
 top left in the chat always the gestures 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.050
 was displayed on the man was 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:54.570
 but I will do it that way 

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:56.370
 you somewhere hinke a small counter hinke 

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:59.190
 who counts so you know where I am 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.850
 whether exciting or not and now for 

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:01.680
 The End 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.110
 I wanted to ask you something 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:06.270
 just the wrong word I wanted something 

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.070
 Let's say it like this, I have it 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.040
 never in any video anyway 

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:12.780
 said or written by because of give 

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:14.910
 the video and thumbs up the divides 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.410
 on facebook twitter instagram was it 

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:17.940
 Even so, subscribe me to ours 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.380
 shit I do not do that I want 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.539
 Not at all, but I wanted something 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:23.039
 try and over 5000 now 

00:04:21.539 --> 00:04:25.650
 subscribers in any case 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.160
 and if I say you like this now 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.200
 this 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.060
 I do not know how many likes 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.150
 but it would be really cool 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:35.730
 if each of you now thumbs 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.200
 push up button on this video 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.630
 and I would like to know how 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.550
 many come together 200 i believe more 

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.600
 if there are really many then join 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:46.620
 I'm sure there will be 300 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.970
 I can do it very badly right now 

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:51.120
 estimate I think something 

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:52.400
 between 200 and 300 likes we could 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.330
 get there together 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.560
 i have no idea maybe 

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:57.390
 maybe more, maybe less 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.610
 we'll give it a try 

00:04:57.390 --> 00:05:01.440
 maybe they beat that 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.690
 thumb up button again 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.310
 strong up and then we will 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.780
 see what comes out at 

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.100
 I 've been here all the time 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.150
 in black screen I I pack as 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.160
 probably something else behind it 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.750
 so that you have something to watch if you 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.400
 still some name for the series 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.930
 here you have please write in please 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.700
 the comments I'm not yet 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:18.930
 sure i like the whole amount on each one 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.060
 In this case, I say goodbye to people now 

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:24.080
 and say to the next video people 

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:24.080
 See you
