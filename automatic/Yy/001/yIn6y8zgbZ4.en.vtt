we're going to open it back up and turn

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:15.460 
we're going to open it back up and turn
it<00:01:10.150> 45-degree<00:01:11.150> angles<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:11.780> that<00:01:11.990> a<00:01:12.640> b<00:01:13.640> c<00:01:14.450> d<00:01:14.869> is

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 
it 45-degree angles so that a b c d is

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.770 
it 45-degree angles so that a b c d is
facing<00:01:16.280> in<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.580> direction<00:01:16.610> that<00:01:17.270> i<00:01:17.330> have<00:01:17.630> it

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
facing in the direction that i have it

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.640 
facing in the direction that i have it
here<00:01:18.640> next<00:01:19.640> we're<00:01:19.909> going<00:01:20.119> to<00:01:20.360> take<00:01:21.020> corners<00:01:21.470> a

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:21.650 
here next we're going to take corners a

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.070 
here next we're going to take corners a
and<00:01:22.100> fee<00:01:22.550> and<00:01:22.850> we're<00:01:23.060> going<00:01:23.300> to<00:01:23.450> bring<00:01:23.690> it<00:01:23.869> up

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:24.080 
and fee and we're going to bring it up

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.410 
and fee and we're going to bring it up
to<00:01:24.110> d<00:01:24.860> so<00:01:25.729> we<00:01:26.270> will<00:01:26.479> be<00:01:26.690> folding<00:01:27.470> upwards<00:01:28.420> and

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
to d so we will be folding upwards and

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.540 
to d so we will be folding upwards and
then<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.290> will<00:01:30.409> find<00:01:30.680> that<00:01:30.800> the<00:01:30.950> paper<00:01:31.190> will

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
then you will find that the paper will

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.749 
then you will find that the paper will
fold<00:01:31.820> in<00:01:32.090> on<00:01:32.240> itself<00:01:33.070> flatten<00:01:34.070> out<00:01:34.220> into<00:01:34.729> a

00:01:34.749 --> 00:01:34.759 
fold in on itself flatten out into a

00:01:34.759 --> 00:01:38.770 
fold in on itself flatten out into a
square<00:01:36.369> next<00:01:37.369> we're<00:01:37.790> going<00:01:37.970> to<00:01:38.149> take<00:01:38.479> these

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
square next we're going to take these

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.990 
square next we're going to take these
outer<00:01:39.140> edges<00:01:39.530> and<00:01:39.950> we're<00:01:40.130> going<00:01:40.369> to<00:01:40.520> fold<00:01:40.759> them

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
outer edges and we're going to fold them

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.749 
outer edges and we're going to fold them
into<00:01:41.240> the<00:01:41.450> middle<00:01:41.710> so<00:01:42.710> taking<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.280> outer<00:01:43.460> edge

00:01:43.749 --> 00:01:43.759 
into the middle so taking the outer edge

00:01:43.759 --> 00:01:46.749 
into the middle so taking the outer edge
we're<00:01:44.420> going<00:01:44.450> to<00:01:44.780> fold<00:01:45.289> them<00:01:45.619> into<00:01:46.009> the<00:01:46.610> middle

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759 
we're going to fold them into the middle

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.840 
we're going to fold them into the middle
so<00:01:47.360> that<00:01:47.390> the<00:01:47.780> paper<00:01:48.140> turns<00:01:48.619> into<00:01:48.890> a<00:01:49.100> kite<00:01:49.550> like

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
so that the paper turns into a kite like

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:55.419 
so that the paper turns into a kite like
shape<00:01:51.280> so<00:01:52.280> from<00:01:52.940> left<00:01:53.149> to<00:01:53.330> right<00:01:54.429> going

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:55.429 
shape so from left to right going

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:57.999 
shape so from left to right going
through<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> edges<00:01:56.420> and<00:01:56.840> we're<00:01:57.710> going<00:01:57.890> to

00:01:57.999 --> 00:01:58.009 
through the edges and we're going to

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.219 
through the edges and we're going to
turn<00:01:58.190> the<00:01:58.340> entire<00:01:58.670> piece<00:01:58.970> over<00:01:59.390> and<00:01:59.630> do<00:02:00.080> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
turn the entire piece over and do the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.570 
turn the entire piece over and do the
same<00:02:00.440> for<00:02:00.649> this<00:02:00.770> slide<00:02:01.039> so<00:02:01.700> from<00:02:02.300> left<00:02:03.200> edge<00:02:03.770> to

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:04.580 
same for this slide so from left edge to
