believe this is set in a particular

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.940 
believe this is set in a particular
neighborhood<00:00:32.219> in<00:00:32.790> 1930s<00:00:33.690> Sydney<00:00:34.200> and<00:00:34.410> this<00:00:34.800> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
neighborhood in 1930s Sydney and this is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.950 
neighborhood in 1930s Sydney and this is
about<00:00:35.100> kelpy<00:00:35.640> and<00:00:35.910> Dymphna<00:00:36.390> whose<00:00:36.660> lives

pretty<00:00:40.530> interesting<00:00:41.160> I<00:00:41.250> think<00:00:41.309> this<00:00:41.579> also

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
pretty interesting I think this also

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.330 
pretty interesting I think this also
includes<00:00:42.210> a<00:00:42.300> bit<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.510> mob<00:00:42.660> rivalry<00:00:43.350> it's<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:44.070> a

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
includes a bit of mob rivalry it's in a

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.940 
includes a bit of mob rivalry it's in a
familiar<00:00:44.730> ish<00:00:45.239> setting<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> me<00:00:46.200> but<00:00:46.649> also<00:00:46.770> in

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
familiar ish setting to me but also in

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.279 
familiar ish setting to me but also in
the<00:00:47.010> 1930s<00:00:47.670> so--but<00:00:48.030> historical<00:00:48.780> as<00:00:48.899> well<00:00:49.079> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
the 1930s so--but historical as well and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.529 
the 1930s so--but historical as well and
apparently<00:00:49.680> ghosts<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.760> well<00:00:50.820> there<00:00:51.360> might<00:00:51.510> be

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
apparently ghosts as well there might be

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.060 
apparently ghosts as well there might be
ghosts<00:00:52.050> or<00:00:52.530> something

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:18.420 
across this kind of unusual puzzle on

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:20.690 
across this kind of unusual puzzle on
the<00:05:18.510> internet<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:19.140> she<00:05:19.590> manages<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.250> solve<00:05:20.520> it

organization<00:05:23.250> called<00:05:23.280> the<00:05:23.640> industry<00:05:24.240> so<00:05:24.510> I

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:24.540 
organization called the industry so I

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.270 
organization called the industry so I
think<00:05:24.810> this<00:05:24.960> kind<00:05:25.140> of<00:05:25.350> involves<00:05:25.890> a<00:05:26.010> bit<00:05:26.160> of

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:26.280 
think this kind of involves a bit of

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:28.100 
think this kind of involves a bit of
code<00:05:26.610> breaking<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.390> hacking<00:05:27.780> and<00:05:27.870> things

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:28.110 
code breaking and hacking and things

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.140 
code breaking and hacking and things
like<00:05:28.260> that<00:05:28.500> sounds<00:05:29.160> pretty<00:05:29.310> cool<00:05:29.610> looks

00:05:30.140 --> 00:05:30.150 
like that sounds pretty cool looks

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.090 
like that sounds pretty cool looks
pretty<00:05:30.450> cool<00:05:30.690> I'm<00:05:31.590> intrigued

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:32.100 
pretty cool I'm intrigued

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:34.070 
pretty cool I'm intrigued
