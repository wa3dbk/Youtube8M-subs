and<00:02:24.840> mines<00:02:25.840> already<00:02:26.260> done<00:02:27.040> okay<00:02:28.030> it's<00:02:28.180> more

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
and mines already done okay it's more

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.810 
and mines already done okay it's more
than<00:02:28.510> a<00:02:28.570> hundred<00:02:28.780> percent<00:02:28.960> so<00:02:29.350> on<00:02:29.610> okay<00:02:30.610> then

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
than a hundred percent so on okay then

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.440 
than a hundred percent so on okay then
um<00:02:31.140> there<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.260> go<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:32.710> after<00:02:33.490> you<00:02:33.640> click<00:02:34.390> on

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
um there you go and after you click on

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.050 
um there you go and after you click on
these<00:02:35.140> all<00:02:35.560> of<00:02:35.620> these<00:02:35.920> you're<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.790> to<00:02:36.880> want

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
these all of these you're going to want

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:42.780 
these all of these you're going to want
to<00:02:37.740> go<00:02:38.740> to<00:02:38.800> mograph<00:02:39.550> effector<00:02:40.480> and<00:02:40.750> random<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790 
to go to mograph effector and random and

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:44.970 
to go to mograph effector and random and
then<00:02:42.940> went<00:02:43.120> even<00:02:43.240> random<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.560> don't<00:02:44.740> want<00:02:44.890> to

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:44.980 
then went even random you don't want to

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.910 
then went even random you don't want to
click<00:02:45.190> on<00:02:45.340> shift<00:02:46.000> and<00:02:46.330> we're<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.140> first<00:02:47.410> exon

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
click on shift and we're the first exon

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.210 
click on shift and we're the first exon
here<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.430> just<00:02:48.670> wanna<00:02:48.820> wanna<00:02:49.380> click<00:02:50.380> and<00:02:50.680> then

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:51.220 
here you just wanna wanna click and then

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:53.130 
here you just wanna wanna click and then
drag<00:02:51.280> all<00:02:51.970> the<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.180> down<00:02:52.480> or<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.959> could<00:02:53.110> just

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
drag all the way down or you could just

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.490 
drag all the way down or you could just
do<00:02:53.380> it<00:02:53.470> manually<00:02:54.120> to<00:02:55.120> put<00:02:55.300> the<00:02:55.420> check<00:02:56.200> marks

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
do it manually to put the check marks

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.840 
do it manually to put the check marks
and<00:02:57.090> then<00:02:58.090> I'll<00:02:58.330> start<00:02:58.660> to<00:02:58.900> do<00:02:59.290> this<00:02:59.920> random

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
and then I'll start to do this random

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:02.970 
and then I'll start to do this random
thing<00:03:01.120> and<00:03:01.390> then<00:03:01.630> after<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.170> you<00:03:02.560> know<00:03:02.590> want

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:02.980 
thing and then after that you know want

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.699 
thing and then after that you know want
to<00:03:03.070> keep<00:03:03.640> selected<00:03:04.269> on<00:03:04.390> random<00:03:04.840> you<00:03:05.410> know<00:03:05.530> what

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:05.709 
to keep selected on random you know what

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.050 
to keep selected on random you know what
I<00:03:05.739> go<00:03:05.860> deformer<00:03:06.610> go<00:03:07.269> on<00:03:07.330> point<00:03:08.140> and<00:03:08.820> then<00:03:09.820> your

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
I go deformer go on point and then your

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.330 
I go deformer go on point and then your
go-to<00:03:10.540> defector<00:03:11.200> and<00:03:11.230> I<00:03:11.500> like<00:03:11.709> to<00:03:11.920> put<00:03:12.130> it

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
go-to defector and I like to put it

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:15.810 
go-to defector and I like to put it
under<00:03:12.790> ten<00:03:13.150> somewhere<00:03:14.140> under<00:03:14.380> 10<00:03:14.590> 10<00:03:15.190> depends

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:15.820 
under ten somewhere under 10 10 depends

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:19.560 
under ten somewhere under 10 10 depends
on<00:03:15.910> what<00:03:16.090> text<00:03:16.450> to<00:03:16.570> use<00:03:16.840> and<00:03:17.700> I<00:03:18.700> think<00:03:19.330> this

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
on what text to use and I think this

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.240 
on what text to use and I think this
looks<00:03:19.780> good<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.380> we<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.830> should<00:03:21.040> put<00:03:21.220> a

the atoms lightroom and the in the
description<00:06:26.719> and<00:06:26.979> that's<00:06:27.979> how<00:06:28.249> our<00:06:28.429> text<00:06:28.879> is

00:06:28.989 --> 00:06:28.999 
description and that's how our text is

00:06:28.999 --> 00:06:30.309 
description and that's how our text is
going<00:06:29.179> to<00:06:29.239> load<00:06:29.419> you<00:06:29.569> can<00:06:29.629> change<00:06:29.929> the<00:06:30.079> color

00:06:30.309 --> 00:06:30.319 
going to load you can change the color

00:06:30.319 --> 00:06:32.199 
going to load you can change the color
obviously<00:06:30.679> you<00:06:31.429> could<00:06:31.549> do<00:06:31.639> a<00:06:31.669> bunch<00:06:31.939> of<00:06:32.089> other

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:32.209 
obviously you could do a bunch of other

00:06:32.209 --> 00:06:34.959 
obviously you could do a bunch of other
stuff<00:06:32.299> it<00:06:33.109> is<00:06:33.319> just<00:06:33.529> a<00:06:33.799> simple<00:06:34.309> way<00:06:34.459> to<00:06:34.489> do<00:06:34.819> it

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:34.969 
stuff it is just a simple way to do it

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:39.969 
stuff it is just a simple way to do it
the<00:06:35.119> basic<00:06:35.599> way<00:06:35.839> so<00:06:38.259> so<00:06:39.259> you<00:06:39.349> could<00:06:39.649> figure<00:06:39.829> out

00:06:39.969 --> 00:06:39.979 
the basic way so so you could figure out

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:41.679 
the basic way so so you could figure out
how<00:06:40.129> to<00:06:40.189> do<00:06:40.339> it<00:06:40.369> later<00:06:40.639> on<00:06:40.819> on<00:06:41.089> yourself<00:06:41.449> and

00:06:41.679 --> 00:06:41.689 
how to do it later on on yourself and

00:06:41.689 --> 00:06:43.749 
how to do it later on on yourself and
when<00:06:42.289> you<00:06:42.319> don't<00:06:42.469> want<00:06:42.589> to<00:06:42.739> do<00:06:42.799> for<00:06:42.949> red<00:06:43.159> render

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
when you don't want to do for red render

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:48.449 
when you don't want to do for red render
settings<00:06:44.149> is<00:06:44.359> what<00:06:44.509> i<00:06:44.539> do<00:06:44.629> is<00:06:46.419> 1280<00:06:47.419> by<00:06:47.779> 720

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:48.459 
settings is what i do is 1280 by 720

00:06:48.459 --> 00:06:51.879 
settings is what i do is 1280 by 720
pixels<00:06:49.459> and<00:06:49.869> just<00:06:50.869> you<00:06:50.989> just<00:06:51.199> you<00:06:51.409> could<00:06:51.679> just

00:06:51.879 --> 00:06:51.889 
pixels and just you just you could just

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:55.689 
pixels and just you just you could just
stop<00:06:52.429> the<00:06:53.319> video<00:06:54.319> and<00:06:54.679> just<00:06:54.860> look<00:06:55.159> at<00:06:55.369> it<00:06:55.399> and
