hi this is Michael with auto e clinic

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.870 
hi this is Michael with auto e clinic
today<00:00:09.630> we're<00:00:09.960> doing<00:00:10.050> link<00:00:10.440> Diagnostics<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
today we're doing link Diagnostics the

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.820 
today we're doing link Diagnostics the
customer<00:00:12.269> complaint<00:00:12.570> on<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.809> vehicle<00:00:13.019> was

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
customer complaint on this vehicle was

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.060 
customer complaint on this vehicle was
losing<00:00:14.309> power<00:00:14.490> steering<00:00:14.910> fluid<00:00:15.030> leak

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
losing power steering fluid leak

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.830 
losing power steering fluid leak
diagnostic<00:00:17.070> starts<00:00:17.609> with<00:00:17.730> gravity<00:00:18.180> gravity

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
diagnostic starts with gravity gravity

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.109 
diagnostic starts with gravity gravity
only<00:00:18.960> flows<00:00:19.289> one<00:00:19.590> way<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:20.039> same<00:00:20.250> as<00:00:20.400> any<00:00:20.640> fluid

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
only flows one way the same as any fluid

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:22.429 
only flows one way the same as any fluid
so<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.539> want<00:00:21.689> to<00:00:21.779> start<00:00:21.960> at<00:00:22.050> your<00:00:22.199> highest

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
so you want to start at your highest

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.769 
so you want to start at your highest
point<00:00:22.920> and<00:00:23.160> work<00:00:23.789> your<00:00:23.970> way<00:00:24.029> down<00:00:24.359> until<00:00:24.570> you

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
point and work your way down until you

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:34.790 
point and work your way down until you
see<00:00:25.050> where<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.260> leak<00:00:25.410> is<00:00:25.439> coming<00:00:25.590> from

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:01:00.840 

you

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.389 

if<00:01:01.850> you're<00:01:02.059> only

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
if you're only

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.950 
if you're only
to<00:01:02.550> determine<00:01:03.000> where<00:01:03.149> a<00:01:03.180> particular<00:01:03.510> link<00:01:03.840> is

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
to determine where a particular link is

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.320 
to determine where a particular link is
coming<00:01:04.290> from<00:01:04.470> you<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> wash<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.850> engine

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
coming from you want to wash the engine

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.690 
coming from you want to wash the engine
from<00:01:06.780> the<00:01:06.810> top<00:01:07.080> and<00:01:07.440> from<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:07.979> bottom<00:01:08.250> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
from the top and from the bottom to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.130 
from the top and from the bottom to
clean<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.000> from<00:01:09.090> any<00:01:09.360> type<00:01:09.600> of<00:01:09.630> previous

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
clean it from any type of previous

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.350 
clean it from any type of previous
fluids<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:11.130> way<00:01:11.369> when<00:01:11.670> it<00:01:11.820> does<00:01:12.000> start<00:01:12.150> to

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
fluids that way when it does start to

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.700 
fluids that way when it does start to
leak<00:01:12.659> you'll<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.259> able<00:01:13.320> to<00:01:13.470> see<00:01:13.619> it

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
leak you'll be able to see it

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:37.580 
leak you'll be able to see it
immediately<00:01:36.110> after<00:01:37.110> cleaning<00:01:37.350> off<00:01:37.560> the

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
immediately after cleaning off the

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.590 
immediately after cleaning off the
engine<00:01:38.100> we<00:01:38.250> then<00:01:38.490> add<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.729> fluorescent<00:01:39.420> dye

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
engine we then add a fluorescent dye

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.510 
engine we then add a fluorescent dye
to<00:01:39.899> the<00:01:39.990> power<00:01:40.170> steering<00:01:40.410> fluid<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:41.340> then

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
to the power steering fluid we then

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.130 
to the power steering fluid we then
crank<00:01:41.789> the<00:01:41.970> engine<00:01:42.360> allowing<00:01:42.899> the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
crank the engine allowing the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.719 
crank the engine allowing the
fluorescent<00:01:43.560> dye<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.679> circulate<00:01:44.310> through<00:01:44.610> the

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
fluorescent dye to circulate through the

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:57.560 
fluorescent dye to circulate through the
power<00:01:44.910> steering<00:01:45.270> system

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.480 

we<00:01:58.570> use<00:01:58.720> a<00:01:58.750> UV<00:01:59.049> light<00:01:59.409> to<00:01:59.680> illuminate<00:01:59.860> the<00:02:00.280> dye

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
we use a UV light to illuminate the dye

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.609 
we use a UV light to illuminate the dye
in<00:02:00.850> the<00:02:01.090> power-steering<00:02:01.390> fluid<00:02:01.659> this<00:02:02.320> allows

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
in the power-steering fluid this allows

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:03.690 
in the power-steering fluid this allows
us<00:02:02.740> to<00:02:02.829> determine<00:02:03.070> that<00:02:03.310> the<00:02:03.430> power-steering

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
us to determine that the power-steering

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.850 
us to determine that the power-steering
leak<00:02:04.119> was<00:02:04.360> in<00:02:04.509> fact<00:02:04.750> coming<00:02:05.110> from<00:02:05.439> the<00:02:05.680> power

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:05.860 
leak was in fact coming from the power

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.630 
leak was in fact coming from the power
steering<00:02:06.100> rack<00:02:07.890> now<00:02:08.890> that<00:02:09.069> we've<00:02:09.190> guided<00:02:09.520> you

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:09.640 
steering rack now that we've guided you

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:10.949 
steering rack now that we've guided you
through<00:02:09.819> the<00:02:09.910> leak<00:02:10.090> diagnostic<00:02:10.780> process

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:10.959 
through the leak diagnostic process

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.020 
through the leak diagnostic process
let's<00:02:11.709> move<00:02:11.920> on<00:02:12.040> to<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.280> next<00:02:12.430> step<00:02:12.730> which

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
let's move on to the next step which

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:14.580 
let's move on to the next step which
would<00:02:13.180> be<00:02:13.239> to<00:02:13.630> repair<00:02:14.019> the<00:02:14.200> leak<00:02:14.319> in<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
would be to repair the leak in the

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.130 
would be to repair the leak in the
steering<00:02:14.950> gear
