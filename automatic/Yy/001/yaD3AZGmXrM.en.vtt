00:00:10.619 --> 00:00:13.079
 Good guys, welcome to my channel today we are going to do 

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:16.409
 another character of those that I like doing so much 

00:00:16.409 --> 00:00:19.420
 today we're going to do DareDevil, it's a character 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:22.369
 of comic but I've done it because it's now 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:25.909
 his series, has just started his series very little in this 2015 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:28.480
 at the end of 2014 I think I remember 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:31.070
 that is becoming very well known is a series 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.130
 that if you do not see it, I recommend it also because it's action 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.640
 is very cool, very cool the truth has its point there 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:39.520
 dark 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.630
 so today we're going to do this makeup that as you know 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:43.810
 all with paintings 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:47.630
 The only thing I have done has been to put on a bald spot and cover my eyebrows 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.060
 that I'm going to show you at the beginning of the video, so if you want to see how we do this 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.170
 DareDevil, stay watching 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.380
 before you start let me remind you to subscribe to the channel, you have the button there 

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.780
 and that you share this video on Facebook so that more people can see it 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.580
 Let's start, in the information box I'll leave a video of how to create the bald 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:08.830
 very easy 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:11.610
 so let's apply the bald, I'm going to apply mastix 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.870
 I'm going to tap to activate it and I'm going to paste everything 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.630
 around leaving the ears inside and also around the neck because that the effect 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.330
 we're looking for, we cut the excess and I'm going to apply 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.620
 a bit of moldable wax or artificial flesh on top of the eyebrows 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.410
 I recommend that you apply it with moisturizer on your hands because 

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:33.910
 It is easier to apply, and we apply a layer of latex around the edge and above the eyebrows 

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:34.630
 so that it does not move 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.820
 we seal everything with loose powders and we start to create the design, you know that always 

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.900
 I like to create a guide 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.100
 with pencil or black pencil the one you have more at hand, whatever it is to know more or less where 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.750
 going to create 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.770
 where the design will be then we apply the color and not always 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.479
 they serve us but at the beginning if it gives us a more specific idea 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:02.180
 of how the makeup will go, we apply a aqua color in black 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.569
 all over the neck area that is black and we're going to start 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:09.180
 to go mixing between red and black to go creating different 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:14.189
 shades of red, lighter and more intense and apply it in certain areas 

00:02:14.189 --> 00:02:18.499
 to make it much easier I'll leave photos of the finish on my blog 

00:02:18.499 --> 00:02:23.009
 you have the link in the silviaquirosblog.com information box 

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:26.879
 you can download the photo you want and you can see in more detail where they go 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:31.119
 the darker and lighter colors and for the side area what I have done has been to add 

00:02:31.119 --> 00:02:35.559
 to the mixture a little bit of white as well as to the part further back of the head 

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:39.649
 that I have added a mixture between the two, as you can see I have only been adding 

00:02:39.649 --> 00:02:43.569
 different shades adding black and white to red 

00:02:51.141 --> 00:02:55.040
 now that we have all the most marked color differences 

00:02:55.049 --> 00:02:57.070
 let's start creating the lights first 

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:58.969
 it's going to be with a mixture a little 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:04.199
 more clarita on the lateral sides and with a purer white as is 

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.789
 I'm going to create the lights 

00:03:05.789 --> 00:03:09.009
 of the ears and the opposite part the shadow of the ears 

00:03:09.009 --> 00:03:11.359
 I'm going to apply a deeper black 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.959
 the same mixture applied on the base part of the sides of the head 

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:19.579
 I'm going to create the front lines and from there up 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:20.679
 I'm going to apply a 

00:03:20.679 --> 00:03:23.209
 dark reddish color but more red 

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:25.519
 some touches of black more in the ears 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:34.659
 and we went to intensify more the shines of the sides with pure white 

00:03:34.659 --> 00:03:39.290
 a pass has already happened to cream colors, cream colors that fade very well 

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.579
 the color of aqua color is not going to moder so I can work with more tranquility 

00:03:42.579 --> 00:03:44.229
 I will create different 

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:49.009
 luminosity also knowing that this mask is supposedly latex 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.899
 that takes postures and that's what I'm creating 

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:54.959
 on the sides, first I create some blank lines and then 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:56.679
 I'm going to aplicate 

00:03:56.679 --> 00:04:01.189
 a cream color in black and we are going to blur some areas so that there is a 

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:03.000
 more real seams 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.100
 how am I using cream colors do not have any problem in 

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.780
 apply more quantity because they blur very well, I'll start with the target to give 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.710
 different brightness points fade very well in certain areas and 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:33.070
 in other areas leaving it more intensive and voya do exactly the same in the area of 

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.610
 body 

00:04:37.749 --> 00:04:41.769
 for the seams of the suit I'm going to do something similar to the mask but vice versa 

00:04:41.769 --> 00:04:43.180
 first I will create the two lines 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.840
 in black and in the center I will apply the line 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.310
 blank and blur to make it more intentional by adding the lights as always 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:54.190
 and the stitches that are the white dots with a little black dot in the center 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:59.770
 we will use a aqua color and a toothbrush to create the beard a bit of black pencil 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:01.389
 in the lower water line 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:02.429
 some contact lenses and that's it 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.139

00:05:09.139 --> 00:05:10.150

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:14.419
 I do not want to take out the hands that are a bit ugly 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.430
 you already know that you can leave me below, there below the video 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:19.889
 a comment with any character you want 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.189
 I do, I'm going to point and as points are added 

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:26.470
 and adding people who want me to do it then I'm doing it 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:29.389
 besides adding the ones that I like here and there 

00:05:29.389 --> 00:05:30.430
