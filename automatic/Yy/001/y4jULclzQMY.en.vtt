so<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:07.560> realized<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.429> we<00:02:08.700> had<00:02:08.729> some<00:02:09.090> features

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
so we realized that we had some features

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.470 
so we realized that we had some features
like<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.140> reduction<00:02:10.619> gear<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.310> most<00:02:12.269> of<00:02:12.390> our

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
like the reduction gear that most of our

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.199 
like the reduction gear that most of our
customers<00:02:12.750> never<00:02:13.410> ever<00:02:13.650> used<00:02:13.970> how<00:02:14.970> were<00:02:15.120> you

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:15.209 
customers never ever used how were you

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.640 
customers never ever used how were you
able<00:02:15.239> to<00:02:15.540> take<00:02:15.720> weight<00:02:15.930> out<00:02:15.959> of<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.320> vehicle

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
able to take weight out of a vehicle

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:17.990 
able to take weight out of a vehicle
that<00:02:16.680> seems<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.250> be<00:02:17.370> one<00:02:17.640> of<00:02:17.760> the<00:02:17.820> most

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
that seems to be one of the most

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.390 
that seems to be one of the most
difficult<00:02:18.480> engineering<00:02:19.019> tasks<00:02:19.709> isn't<00:02:20.340> it

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
difficult engineering tasks isn't it

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.740 
difficult engineering tasks isn't it
absolutely<00:02:20.850> and<00:02:21.540> you're<00:02:22.440> not<00:02:22.560> going<00:02:22.980> to<00:02:23.130> find

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
absolutely and you're not going to find

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.350 
absolutely and you're not going to find
four<00:02:24.750> hundred<00:02:25.110> pounds<00:02:25.769> in<00:02:26.550> just<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:27.030> section

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
four hundred pounds in just one section

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.290 
four hundred pounds in just one section
of<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.660> car<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.440> the<00:02:28.830> way<00:02:29.190> we<00:02:29.400> went<00:02:29.880> about<00:02:29.970> is

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
of the car so the way we went about is

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.530 
of the car so the way we went about is
to<00:02:30.660> really<00:02:31.320> set<00:02:31.530> targets<00:02:32.340> for<00:02:32.790> each<00:02:32.970> part<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
to really set targets for each part you

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.150 
to really set targets for each part you
know<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.810> that<00:02:33.930> in<00:02:34.380> general<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:34.890> want<00:02:35.010> to

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:35.160 
know is that in general we want to

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.280 
know is that in general we want to
reduce<00:02:35.970> the<00:02:36.180> weight<00:02:36.360> of<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.660> car<00:02:36.900> by<00:02:37.049> 10

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
reduce the weight of the car by 10

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.979 
reduce the weight of the car by 10
percent<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:38.549> you<00:02:38.850> have<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.180> attack<00:02:39.540> the

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
percent and you have to attack the

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.340 
percent and you have to attack the
weight<00:02:40.170> of<00:02:40.350> every<00:02:40.769> single<00:02:40.950> part<00:02:41.600> so<00:02:42.600> you<00:02:42.930> know

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
weight of every single part so you know

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.860 
weight of every single part so you know
it's<00:02:43.620> spread<00:02:43.920> out<00:02:43.950> even<00:02:44.579> quite<00:02:45.239> evenly<00:02:45.540> across

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
it's spread out even quite evenly across

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.770 
it's spread out even quite evenly across
the<00:02:46.079> whole<00:02:46.400> so<00:02:47.400> you're<00:02:47.549> taking<00:02:47.730> out<00:02:47.970> grams<00:02:48.329> and

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the whole so you're taking out grams and

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.810 
the whole so you're taking out grams and
portions<00:02:49.200> of<00:02:49.320> grams<00:02:49.620> and<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.220> that<00:02:50.579> is<00:02:50.790> a

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820 
portions of grams and and that is a

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:53.539 
portions of grams and and that is a
major<00:02:51.420> game<00:02:51.720> for<00:02:51.959> you<00:02:52.049> this<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.739> Porsche

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
major game for you this is a Porsche

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.500 
major game for you this is a Porsche
after<00:02:53.880> all<00:02:54.000> so<00:02:54.150> let's<00:02:54.299> talk<00:02:54.450> about

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
after all so let's talk about

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.949 
after all so let's talk about
performance<00:02:55.019> with<00:02:55.350> this<00:02:55.500> yes<00:02:56.600> well<00:02:57.600> you<00:02:57.840> know

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
performance with this yes well you know

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.979 
performance with this yes well you know
we're<00:02:58.110> if<00:02:58.799> you<00:02:58.950> reduce<00:02:59.280> weight<00:02:59.840> next<00:03:00.840> to

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
we're if you reduce weight next to

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:03.340 
we're if you reduce weight next to
reduction<00:03:01.709> to<00:03:01.890> consumption<00:03:02.250> you<00:03:02.640> can<00:03:02.670> also

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
reduction to consumption you can also

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.580 
reduction to consumption you can also
increase<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.530> performance<00:03:04.709> right<00:03:05.280> the<00:03:05.489> you

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
increase the performance right the you

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.520 
increase the performance right the you
again<00:03:07.590> turbo<00:03:08.459> is<00:03:09.000> a<00:03:09.060> half<00:03:09.930> a<00:03:10.049> second<00:03:10.380> faster

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
again turbo is a half a second faster

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:11.559 
again turbo is a half a second faster
from<00:03:10.980> zero<00:03:11.310> to

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569 
from zero to

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.780 
from zero to
see<00:03:11.900> then<00:03:12.409> the<00:03:12.560> card<00:03:12.799> model<00:03:13.159> which<00:03:13.400> already

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
see then the card model which already

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.539 
see then the card model which already
was<00:03:13.969> quite<00:03:14.180> fast<00:03:14.439> yeah<00:03:15.439> tell<00:03:16.069> us<00:03:16.099> about<00:03:16.400> the

00:03:16.539 --> 00:03:16.549 
was quite fast yeah tell us about the

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:17.830 
was quite fast yeah tell us about the
hybrid<00:03:16.879> yes

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
hybrid yes

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.550 
hybrid yes
well<00:03:18.200> the<00:03:18.400> hybrid<00:03:19.400> here<00:03:19.700> is<00:03:19.879> a<00:03:20.260> parallel<00:03:21.260> full

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
well the hybrid here is a parallel full

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.849 
well the hybrid here is a parallel full
hybrid<00:03:22.010> that<00:03:22.609> means<00:03:22.849> it's<00:03:23.389> a<00:03:23.599> system<00:03:24.260> that

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:24.859 
hybrid that means it's a system that

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:28.089 
hybrid that means it's a system that
combines<00:03:25.459> the<00:03:26.319> conventional<00:03:27.319> combustion

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
combines the conventional combustion

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:29.800 
combines the conventional combustion

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:42.319 
on the level of the cayenne s that was

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.449 
on the level of the cayenne s that was
our<00:03:42.530> target<00:03:43.480> in<00:03:44.480> terms<00:03:44.719> of<00:03:44.840> performance<00:03:45.709> in

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
our target in terms of performance in

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:49.300 
our target in terms of performance in
terms<00:03:46.879> of<00:03:47.030> fuel<00:03:47.419> consumption<00:03:47.840> is<00:03:48.139> about<00:03:48.799> 20%

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310 
terms of fuel consumption is about 20%

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.520 
terms of fuel consumption is about 20%
less<00:03:50.180> than<00:03:50.629> the<00:03:50.780> v8<00:03:51.500> model<00:03:52.040> and<00:03:52.840> the<00:03:53.840> very<00:03:54.109> you

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
less than the v8 model and the very you

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.349 
less than the v8 model and the very you
know<00:03:54.590> unique<00:03:55.129> feature<00:03:55.430> is<00:03:55.730> that<00:03:56.000> we<00:03:56.180> have<00:03:56.329> a

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
know unique feature is that we have a

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.869 
know unique feature is that we have a
separation<00:03:57.019> clutch<00:03:57.439> between<00:03:58.250> the<00:03:58.549> combustion

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
separation clutch between the combustion

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:01.270 
separation clutch between the combustion
engine<00:03:59.120> and<00:03:59.449> the<00:03:59.840> electric<00:03:59.930> engine<00:04:00.409> and<00:04:00.769> we

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
engine and the electric engine and we

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:03.819 
engine and the electric engine and we
can<00:04:01.459> completely<00:04:02.030> decouple<00:04:02.449> the<00:04:03.109> combustion

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:03.829 
can completely decouple the combustion

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:06.069 
can completely decouple the combustion
engine<00:04:04.099> and<00:04:04.519> turn<00:04:04.790> it<00:04:04.879> off<00:04:05.000> completely<00:04:05.269> up<00:04:05.870> to

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:06.079 
engine and turn it off completely up to

00:04:06.079 --> 00:04:09.939 
engine and turn it off completely up to
speeds<00:04:06.379> of<00:04:06.639> 97<00:04:07.639> miles<00:04:07.819> per<00:04:08.000> hour<00:04:08.620> the<00:04:09.620> idea

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:09.949 
speeds of 97 miles per hour the idea

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:13.179 
speeds of 97 miles per hour the idea
behind<00:04:10.129> this<00:04:10.430> was<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:11.500> have<00:04:12.500> increased

00:04:13.179 --> 00:04:13.189 
behind this was to have increased

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:15.520 
behind this was to have increased
efficiency<00:04:13.790> also<00:04:14.150> at<00:04:14.209> higher<00:04:14.389> speeds<00:04:14.840> because

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
efficiency also at higher speeds because

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:23.740 
the thing you're most proud of

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:26.980 
the thing you're most proud of
well<00:04:24.740> the<00:04:25.070> first<00:04:25.310> thing<00:04:25.460> that<00:04:25.639> really<00:04:25.990> strikes

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
well the first thing that really strikes

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:29.800 
well the first thing that really strikes
you<00:04:27.229> is<00:04:27.470> to<00:04:27.979> design<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.699> know<00:04:28.820> I<00:04:29.120> said<00:04:29.630> before

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:29.810 
you is to design you know I said before

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:32.290 
you is to design you know I said before
it<00:04:30.289> looks<00:04:30.560> more<00:04:30.770> like<00:04:30.949> a<00:04:30.979> Porsche<00:04:31.370> but<00:04:32.030> when

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
it looks more like a Porsche but when

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.290 
it looks more like a Porsche but when
you<00:04:32.360> think<00:04:32.599> of<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:33.740> car<00:04:33.979> being<00:04:34.190> -<00:04:34.759> about<00:04:35.000> 2

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
you think of the car being - about 2

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.870 
you think of the car being - about 2
inches<00:04:35.599> longer<00:04:36.009> you<00:04:37.009> know<00:04:37.130> you<00:04:37.550> don't<00:04:37.699> really

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
inches longer you know you don't really

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:40.390 
inches longer you know you don't really
notice<00:04:38.150> it<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.930> first<00:04:39.320> spy<00:04:39.530> shots<00:04:39.830> were

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:40.400 
notice it and the first spy shots were

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.219 
notice it and the first spy shots were
commented<00:04:40.909> in<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.180> press<00:04:41.389> you<00:04:41.599> know<00:04:41.720> oh<00:04:41.900> this

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229 
commented in the press you know oh this

00:04:42.229 --> 00:04:44.589 
commented in the press you know oh this
is<00:04:42.380> your<00:04:42.530> new<00:04:42.650> baby<00:04:42.949> Cayenne<00:04:43.430> which<00:04:44.120> shows<00:04:44.389> you

00:04:44.589 --> 00:04:44.599 
is your new baby Cayenne which shows you

00:04:44.599 --> 00:04:47.439 
is your new baby Cayenne which shows you
how<00:04:45.340> well<00:04:46.340> they're<00:04:46.580> designed<00:04:46.970> well<00:04:47.180> that's<00:04:47.330> a

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:47.449 
how well they're designed well that's a

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.270 
how well they're designed well that's a
real<00:04:47.630> compliment<00:04:47.990> isn't<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.470> right<00:04:48.770> when<00:04:49.159> they

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
real compliment isn't it right when they

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:50.860 
real compliment isn't it right when they
think<00:04:49.490> it's<00:04:49.610> smaller<00:04:49.880> rather<00:04:50.270> than<00:04:50.449> larger

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:50.870 
think it's smaller rather than larger

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.559 
think it's smaller rather than larger
and<00:04:51.080> it<00:04:51.199> actually<00:04:51.380> is<00:04:51.710> like

00:04:52.559 --> 00:04:52.569 
and it actually is like

00:04:52.569 --> 00:04:55.139 
and it actually is like
