use<00:01:48.689> a<00:01:48.720> blockhead<00:01:49.560> special<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.159> about<00:01:50.340> now

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
use a blockhead special right about now

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.450 
use a blockhead special right about now
there<00:01:50.790> we<00:01:50.939> go<00:01:51.149> and<00:01:51.390> as<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.200> can<00:01:52.380> see<00:01:52.409> that<00:01:52.619> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
there we go and as you can see that the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.090 
there we go and as you can see that the
execution<00:01:53.729> move<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.390> lot<00:01:54.630> a<00:01:54.869> lot<00:01:54.899> faster<00:01:55.439> really

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
execution move a lot a lot faster really

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.350 
execution move a lot a lot faster really
move<00:01:56.219> a<00:01:56.340> lot<00:01:56.460> of<00:01:56.549> fat<00:01:56.640> so<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.850> helps<00:01:57.060> out<00:01:57.210> when

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
move a lot of fat so it helps out when

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.940 
move a lot of fat so it helps out when
you're<00:01:57.540> trying<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.869> beat<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.140> it's<00:01:58.710> like<00:01:58.920> a

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
you're trying to beat that it's like a

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.410 
you're trying to beat that it's like a
huge<00:01:59.250> box<00:01:59.520> and<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.759> try<00:01:59.880> to<00:01:59.909> beat<00:02:00.149> them<00:02:00.299> all

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
huge box and you try to beat them all

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.539 
huge box and you try to beat them all
that<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> it<00:02:01.140> makes<00:02:01.439> it<00:02:01.619> really<00:02:01.799> really<00:02:02.009> good<00:02:02.520> i

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
that is it makes it really really good i

executioners<00:02:11.370> executions<00:02:12.370> are<00:02:12.489> one<00:02:12.700> of<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
executioners executions are one of the

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.600 
executioners executions are one of the
best<00:02:13.030> tanks<00:02:13.510> in<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.720> game<00:02:14.190> Minotaur<00:02:15.190> I<00:02:15.430> mean

ox Warriors are all right but still
execution<00:02:20.019> is<00:02:20.080> the<00:02:20.140> best<00:02:20.349> unless<00:02:20.530> they

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
execution is the best unless they

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:22.650 
execution is the best unless they
release<00:02:21.040> another<00:02:21.250> a<00:02:21.340> hero<00:02:21.730> then<00:02:22.000> yeah<00:02:22.360> we'll

they might you never know alright let's
attack<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:28.840> bad<00:02:29.260> way<00:02:29.470> of<00:02:29.620> a<00:02:29.680> base<00:02:29.920> here<00:02:30.250> would

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:31.030 
attack this bad way of a base here would

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.940 
attack this bad way of a base here would
double<00:02:31.360> the<00:02:31.390> walls<00:02:31.690> I'll<00:02:32.050> put<00:02:32.260> down<00:02:32.290> block

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:32.950 
double the walls I'll put down block

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.589 
double the walls I'll put down block
head<00:02:33.160> first<00:02:33.370> and<00:02:33.580> dark<00:02:33.819> right<00:02:34.000> or<00:02:34.180> follow<00:02:34.390> that

head first and dark right or follow that
and<00:02:34.900> let's<00:02:35.050> see<00:02:35.200> how<00:02:35.349> far<00:02:35.830> of<00:02:36.250> damage<00:02:36.790> it<00:02:36.940> will

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
and let's see how far of damage it will

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.820 
and let's see how far of damage it will
do<00:02:37.180> i'll<00:02:37.330> use<00:02:37.510> dark<00:02:37.750> writers<00:02:38.049> ability<00:02:38.560> first

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
do i'll use dark writers ability first

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.940 
do i'll use dark writers ability first
because<00:02:39.580> it<00:02:39.790> is<00:02:40.090> does<00:02:40.360> do<00:02:40.660> get<00:02:41.290> more<00:02:41.470> damage

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
because it is does do get more damage

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.789 
because it is does do get more damage

00:02:44.789 --> 00:02:44.799 
out of it let's ease bad look at these

00:02:44.799 --> 00:02:46.440 
out of it let's ease bad look at these
they're<00:02:45.130> all<00:02:45.280> going<00:02:45.519> one<00:02:45.790> direction<00:02:45.940> my

00:02:54.509 --> 00:02:54.519 
about that we'll just look around that

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.850 
about that we'll just look around that
the<00:02:54.880> execution<00:02:55.239> special<00:02:55.900> ability<00:02:56.380> as<00:02:56.680> how

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860 
the execution special ability as how

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.650 
the execution special ability as how
fast<00:02:57.340> they're<00:02:57.579> destroying<00:02:57.940> everything<00:02:58.329> now

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
fast they're destroying everything now

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.140 
fast they're destroying everything now
since<00:02:59.200> their<00:02:59.319> attack<00:02:59.590> is<00:02:59.769> up<00:02:59.799> my<00:03:00.640> dark<00:03:00.700> rider

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
since their attack is up my dark rider

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.940 
since their attack is up my dark rider
is<00:03:01.269> about<00:03:01.510> to<00:03:01.660> die<00:03:01.810> in<00:03:01.870> a<00:03:02.049> couple<00:03:02.380> of<00:03:02.500> seconds

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
is about to die in a couple of seconds

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.710 
is about to die in a couple of seconds
I'll<00:03:03.040> use<00:03:03.190> blockhead<00:03:03.670> special<00:03:04.060> ability<00:03:04.540> so

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
I'll use blockhead special ability so

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.720 
I'll use blockhead special ability so
they'd<00:03:04.870> run<00:03:05.019> a<00:03:05.049> little<00:03:05.260> faster<00:03:05.739> I'll<00:03:06.340> run<00:03:06.700> a

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
they'd run a little faster I'll run a

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.210 
they'd run a little faster I'll run a
lot<00:03:07.000> faster<00:03:07.030> actually<00:03:07.690> they<00:03:08.200> really<00:03:08.530> do<00:03:08.920> run

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
lot faster actually they really do run

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:10.949 
lot faster actually they really do run
off<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:09.640> as<00:03:09.790> you<00:03:09.970> can<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.150> our<00:03:10.299> Dark<00:03:10.780> Riders

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:10.959 
off and as you can see our Dark Riders

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.520 
off and as you can see our Dark Riders
out<00:03:11.579> because<00:03:12.579> the<00:03:12.790> dark<00:03:13.450> bright<00:03:13.630> well<00:03:14.230> Dark

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
out because the dark bright well Dark

so<00:03:19.150> that's<00:03:19.359> the<00:03:19.780> big<00:03:19.959> difference<00:03:19.989> if<00:03:20.650> i<00:03:20.799> had<00:03:20.889> a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
so that's the big difference if i had a

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.890 
so that's the big difference if i had a
hero<00:03:21.220> hey<00:03:21.400> the<00:03:21.700> fight<00:03:22.150> another<00:03:22.239> hero<00:03:22.600> 8<00:03:22.720> on
