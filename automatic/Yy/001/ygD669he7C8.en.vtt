that you know on the outside what's the

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.490 
that you know on the outside what's the
simplest<00:01:08.040> one<00:01:08.430> liner<00:01:08.729> visually<00:01:09.390> or<00:01:09.600> verbally

that<00:01:11.040> can<00:01:11.220> kind<00:01:11.340> of<00:01:11.460> get<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.670> point<00:01:11.880> across

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
that can kind of get the point across

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.480 
that can kind of get the point across
and<00:01:12.390> then<00:01:12.900> as<00:01:13.170> people<00:01:13.590> are<00:01:13.830> interested<00:01:14.369> or
