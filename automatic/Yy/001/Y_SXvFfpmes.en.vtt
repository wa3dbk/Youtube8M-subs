00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
are these just simmering and gently

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.399 
are these just simmering and gently
exploding<00:01:33.150> open<00:01:34.369> I've<00:01:35.369> gotta<00:01:35.549> get<00:01:35.700> out<00:01:35.790> more

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:36.409 
exploding open I've gotta get out more

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:38.810 
exploding open I've gotta get out more
now<00:01:37.409> it<00:01:37.530> doesn't<00:01:37.710> that<00:01:38.009> look<00:01:38.220> good

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
now it doesn't that look good

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:40.789 
now it doesn't that look good
and<00:01:39.360> I<00:01:39.450> like<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.869> lumps<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.380> I'm<00:01:40.560> gonna

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
and I like the lumps in it I'm gonna

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.289 
and I like the lumps in it I'm gonna
leave<00:01:41.009> a<00:01:41.040> few<00:01:41.369> were<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.549> whole<00:01:41.729> lumps<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.180> it

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:42.299 
leave a few were the whole lumps in it

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:43.730 
leave a few were the whole lumps in it
so<00:01:42.509> it's<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.780> bit<00:01:42.930> of<00:01:42.960> texture<00:01:43.530> but

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
so it's got a bit of texture but

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
so it's got a bit of texture but
obviously<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:44.939> these<00:01:45.060> being<00:01:45.329> cranberries

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
obviously with these being cranberries

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.109 
obviously with these being cranberries
they've<00:01:45.990> got<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> lot<00:01:46.350> of<00:01:46.470> pectin<00:01:46.850> and<00:01:47.850> it<00:01:47.970> will

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
they've got a lot of pectin and it will

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.670 
they've got a lot of pectin and it will
set<00:01:48.420> thicker<00:01:48.720> than<00:01:48.899> that<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.259> if<00:01:49.380> you<00:01:49.470> think

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:49.680 
set thicker than that so if you think

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.620 
set thicker than that so if you think
the<00:01:49.860> sauce<00:01:50.100> is<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.369> little<00:01:50.460> too<00:01:51.000> thick<00:01:51.210> to<00:01:51.329> start

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
the sauce is a little too thick to start

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:57.899 
the sauce is a little too thick to start
with<00:01:51.810> bit<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.710> water.that<00:01:53.130> Easy<00:01:55.130> Spirit

give that a couple more minutes on the

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.380 
give that a couple more minutes on the
