light for the film back when camera is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.889 
light for the film back when camera is
used<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.050> use<00:00:46.260> film<00:00:46.620> so<00:00:47.219> the<00:00:47.430> higher<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.210> ISO

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
used to use film so the higher the ISO

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.380 
used to use film so the higher the ISO
the<00:00:49.110> more<00:00:49.320> sensitive<00:00:49.829> to<00:00:49.980> light<00:00:50.129> the<00:00:50.340> film<00:00:50.670> so

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the more sensitive to light the film so

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.529 
the more sensitive to light the film so
let's<00:00:51.539> say<00:00:51.660> you're<00:00:51.870> in<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.789> dimly<00:00:53.789> lit<00:00:53.940> room<00:00:54.090> or

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
let's say you're in a dimly lit room or

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.049 
let's say you're in a dimly lit room or
a<00:00:54.570> club<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.170> may<00:00:55.350> need<00:00:55.410> an<00:00:55.559> ISO<00:00:56.070> 800<00:00:56.370> or<00:00:56.850> even

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
a club you may need an ISO 800 or even

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.090 
a club you may need an ISO 800 or even
greater<00:00:57.530> especially<00:00:58.530> if<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:58.649> don't<00:00:58.739> have<00:00:58.859> any

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
greater especially if you don't have any

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.880 
greater especially if you don't have any
flash<00:00:59.399> with<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.320> so<00:01:01.320> how<00:01:01.410> do<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.530> control<00:01:01.739> the

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
flash with you so how do you control the

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.010 
flash with you so how do you control the
ISO<00:01:02.309> on<00:01:02.550> the<00:01:02.910> t2i<00:01:04.640> hit<00:01:05.640> the<00:01:05.850> ISO<00:01:06.450> a<00:01:06.479> button<00:01:06.840> and

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
ISO on the t2i hit the ISO a button and

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.620 
ISO on the t2i hit the ISO a button and
hold<00:01:07.890> that<00:01:07.979> down<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.580> you<00:01:09.030> can<00:01:09.150> spin<00:01:09.510> your

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
hold that down and you can spin your

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.770 
hold that down and you can spin your
dial<00:01:09.900> which<00:01:10.530> selects<00:01:11.189> different<00:01:11.670> iso's<00:01:12.180> so

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
dial which selects different iso's so

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.590 
dial which selects different iso's so
you<00:01:12.869> can<00:01:12.960> go<00:01:13.049> from<00:01:13.170> an<00:01:13.320> iso<00:01:13.740> 100<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.479> 6400<00:01:15.479> on

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
you can go from an iso 100 to 6400 on

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.710 
you can go from an iso 100 to 6400 on
your<00:01:15.780> TTYL<00:01:16.290> so<00:01:16.470> let's<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.740> with<00:01:16.860> an<00:01:16.979> iso<00:01:17.720> 100

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
your TTYL so let's go with an iso 100

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.179 
your TTYL so let's go with an iso 100
since<00:01:18.869> this<00:01:19.229> is<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.409> well-lit<00:01:19.920> room<00:01:20.240> and<00:01:22.189> the

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
since this is a well-lit room and the

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.219 
since this is a well-lit room and the
lower<00:01:23.400> the<00:01:23.610> iso<00:01:24.090> will<00:01:24.270> also<00:01:24.600> give<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.960> a

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
lower the iso will also give you a

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.100 
lower the iso will also give you a
better<00:01:25.710> quality<00:01:26.369> of<00:01:26.549> picture<00:01:26.790> because<00:01:27.360> as<00:01:27.570> you

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
better quality of picture because as you

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.590 
better quality of picture because as you
go<00:01:28.229> up<00:01:28.439> an<00:01:28.590> iso<00:01:29.009> your<00:01:29.280> picture<00:01:29.939> may<00:01:30.090> look<00:01:30.540> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
go up an iso your picture may look a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.999 
go up an iso your picture may look a
little<00:01:30.659> bit<00:01:30.869> more<00:01:31.020> grainy<00:01:33.560> so<00:01:34.560> now<00:01:34.650> let's<00:01:34.829> go

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
little bit more grainy so now let's go

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:38.600 
little bit more grainy so now let's go
to<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.520> aperture<00:01:36.240> app<00:01:36.780> sure<00:01:37.259> is<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:38.009> whole<00:01:38.460> it

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
to the aperture app sure is a whole it

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.179 
to the aperture app sure is a whole it
lets<00:01:38.790> light<00:01:39.090> through<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.659> lens<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.200> that's

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
lets light through the lens and that's

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.630 
lets light through the lens and that's
measurement<00:01:41.729> f-stop<00:01:42.299> so<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:43.369> higher<00:01:44.369> the

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
measurement f-stop so the higher the

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.700 
measurement f-stop so the higher the
f-stop<00:01:45.240> these<00:01:45.630> smaller<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.259> aperture<00:01:46.409> or

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
f-stop these smaller the aperture or

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.030 
f-stop these smaller the aperture or
hold<00:01:47.100> let<00:01:47.340> life<00:01:47.549> room<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> the<00:01:48.829> lower<00:01:49.829> the

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
hold let life room and the lower the

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.010 
hold let life room and the lower the
f-stop<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.729> larger<00:01:51.180> than<00:01:51.299> apertures<00:01:51.780> let

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
f-stop the larger than apertures let

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.889 
f-stop the larger than apertures let
light<00:01:52.229> through<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> what<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.270> adjusts<00:01:54.780> is

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
light through and what that adjusts is

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:59.719 
light through and what that adjusts is
also<00:01:55.470> is<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> depth<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.189> focus<00:01:56.430> so<00:01:57.409> an<00:01:58.729> f-stop

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
also is the depth of focus so an f-stop

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.670 
also is the depth of focus so an f-stop
of<00:02:00.000> 14<00:02:00.899> will<00:02:01.409> give<00:02:01.590> you<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.770> small<00:02:02.610> hole<00:02:03.320> or<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.560> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
of 14 will give you a small hole or in a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.260 
of 14 will give you a small hole or in a
small<00:02:04.920> aperture<00:02:05.340> but<00:02:05.610> everything<00:02:06.000> will<00:02:06.060> be<00:02:06.180> in

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
small aperture but everything will be in

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.390 
small aperture but everything will be in
focus<00:02:06.509> including<00:02:06.990> the<00:02:07.079> mount

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
focus including the mount

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.580

bathroom<00:02:07.910> let's<00:02:08.210> say<00:02:08.330> your<00:02:08.479> f-stop<00:02:08.930> is<00:02:09.320> lower

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
bathroom let's say your f-stop is lower

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.400 
bathroom let's say your f-stop is lower
which<00:02:09.920> is<00:02:10.040> about<00:02:10.520> like<00:02:10.790> 2.8<00:02:11.450> which<00:02:12.140> will<00:02:12.290> give

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
which is about like 2.8 which will give

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.730 
which is about like 2.8 which will give
you<00:02:12.500> a<00:02:12.560> large<00:02:13.340> aperture<00:02:14.030> only<00:02:14.840> things<00:02:15.050> nearby

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:15.740 
you a large aperture only things nearby

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.380 
you a large aperture only things nearby
Oh<00:02:15.770> being<00:02:16.130> focused<00:02:16.550> in<00:02:16.610> the<00:02:16.700> back<00:02:16.880> room<00:02:17.060> will

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
Oh being focused in the back room will

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:19.900 
Oh being focused in the back room will
be<00:02:17.420> blurred<00:02:17.810> and<00:02:17.990> out<00:02:18.140> of<00:02:18.290> focus<00:02:18.730> so<00:02:19.730> how<00:02:19.850> do

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
be blurred and out of focus so how do

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
be blurred and out of focus so how do
you<00:02:20.030> adjust<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.420> aperture<00:02:20.510> on<00:02:20.810> your<00:02:21.020> teeth

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
you adjust the aperture on your teeth

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.760 
you adjust the aperture on your teeth
you<00:02:21.320> I<00:02:21.640> you'll<00:02:22.640> see<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.120> AV<00:02:23.990> plus<00:02:24.260> minus<00:02:24.500> bun

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
you I you'll see a AV plus minus bun

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.740 
you I you'll see a AV plus minus bun
here<00:02:25.100> in<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> upper<00:02:25.760> right-hand<00:02:26.480> corner

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
here in the upper right-hand corner

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:28.810 
here in the upper right-hand corner
going<00:02:27.110> to<00:02:27.290> hold<00:02:27.530> that<00:02:27.680> down<00:02:27.890> and<00:02:28.220> again<00:02:28.790> you

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:28.820 
going to hold that down and again you

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.790 
going to hold that down and again you
can<00:02:28.970> spin<00:02:29.450> the<00:02:29.570> Dow<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.900> top<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.320> adjust<00:02:30.650> your

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:30.800 
can spin the Dow on top to adjust your

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.150 
can spin the Dow on top to adjust your
your<00:02:31.340> aperture<00:02:31.670> so<00:02:32.000> let's<00:02:32.180> leave<00:02:32.930> it<00:02:32.990> at<00:02:33.200> 4.5

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
your aperture so let's leave it at 4.5

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.300 
your aperture so let's leave it at 4.5
there<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:35.150> then<00:02:35.240> we're<00:02:35.360> ready<00:02:35.420> to<00:02:35.510> go<00:02:35.690> and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
there and then we're ready to go and

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.800 
there and then we're ready to go and
finally<00:02:37.310> it's<00:02:37.730> your<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.270> can<00:02:38.420> adjust<00:02:38.510> your

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:38.810 
finally it's your you can adjust your

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:41.290 
finally it's your you can adjust your
shutter<00:02:39.170> speed<00:02:39.260> which<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.310> measured<00:02:40.610> measured

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:41.300 
shutter speed which is measured measured

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.870 
shutter speed which is measured measured
in<00:02:41.660> fractions<00:02:41.959> of<00:02:42.320> a<00:02:42.440> second<00:02:42.830> so<00:02:43.220> this<00:02:43.400> shutter

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
in fractions of a second so this shutter

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.120 
in fractions of a second so this shutter
speed<00:02:44.270> is<00:02:44.450> one<00:02:45.110> over<00:02:45.290> one<00:02:45.500> hundred<00:02:45.620> or<00:02:45.890> one

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
speed is one over one hundred or one

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.800 
speed is one over one hundred or one
one-hundredth<00:02:46.640> of<00:02:46.730> a<00:02:46.850> second<00:02:47.209> so<00:02:47.570> that's<00:02:47.720> the

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
one-hundredth of a second so that's the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.720 
one-hundredth of a second so that's the
amount<00:02:47.930> of<00:02:48.020> time<00:02:48.290> that<00:02:48.320> the<00:02:48.650> shutter<00:02:49.459> will<00:02:49.610> be

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 
amount of time that the shutter will be

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:52.000 
amount of time that the shutter will be
opened<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.180> little<00:02:50.270> allow<00:02:50.930> light<00:02:51.200> through<00:02:51.530> so

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
opened a little allow light through so

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.370 
opened a little allow light through so
let's<00:02:52.190> say<00:02:52.280> you're<00:02:52.459> someplace<00:02:52.640> words<00:02:53.230> like<00:02:54.230> on

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
let's say you're someplace words like on

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:55.930 
let's say you're someplace words like on
the<00:02:54.500> beach<00:02:54.740> and<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:55.100> broad<00:02:55.370> daylight<00:02:55.400> and

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the beach and it's broad daylight and

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.760 
the beach and it's broad daylight and
you<00:02:56.090> want<00:02:56.330> to<00:02:56.480> allow<00:02:56.810> less<00:02:57.170> light<00:02:57.530> through

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
you want to allow less light through

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:59.230 
you want to allow less light through
because<00:02:58.040> your<00:02:58.520> pictures<00:02:58.820> are<00:02:58.910> coming<00:02:59.030> out

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
because your pictures are coming out

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.780 
because your pictures are coming out
overexposed<00:03:00.080> so<00:03:00.620> go<00:03:00.740> ahead<00:03:00.830> and<00:03:00.950> spin<00:03:01.700> the

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
overexposed so go ahead and spin the

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:05.560 
overexposed so go ahead and spin the
dial<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:02.230> this<00:03:03.230> will<00:03:04.120> change<00:03:05.120> your<00:03:05.270> shutter

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
dial and this will change your shutter

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.750 
dial and this will change your shutter
speed<00:03:05.660> to<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:06.470> two<00:03:06.800> hundredth<00:03:07.250> of<00:03:07.310> a<00:03:07.400> second

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
speed to one two hundredth of a second

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.120 
speed to one two hundredth of a second
so<00:03:08.090> it's<00:03:08.209> even<00:03:08.300> it's<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.560> shuttle<00:03:09.980> will<00:03:10.070> be

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:10.130 
so it's even it's the shuttle will be

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:13.030 
so it's even it's the shuttle will be
open<00:03:10.400> half<00:03:10.880> as<00:03:11.090> much<00:03:11.270> as<00:03:11.540> it<00:03:12.050> was<00:03:12.170> before<00:03:12.350> when

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:13.040 
open half as much as it was before when

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:14.890 
open half as much as it was before when
it<00:03:13.130> was<00:03:13.310> one<00:03:13.640> hundredth<00:03:14.090> of<00:03:14.150> a<00:03:14.269> second<00:03:14.600> so<00:03:14.720> it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:14.900 
it was one hundredth of a second so it

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:20.470 
it was one hundredth of a second so it
allow<00:03:15.110> less<00:03:15.590> light<00:03:15.860> to<00:03:15.980> pass<00:03:17.590> and<00:03:18.760> finally<00:03:19.760> let

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
allow less light to pass and finally let

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.060 
allow less light to pass and finally let
me<00:03:20.570> show<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.780> how<00:03:20.930> to<00:03:21.050> use<00:03:21.170> the<00:03:21.500> histogram

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
me show you how to use the histogram

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.060 
me show you how to use the histogram

it'll show you the histogram of the

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.930 
it'll show you the histogram of the
photo<00:03:57.630> and<00:03:57.900> what<00:03:58.590> you<00:03:58.680> want<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.920> do<00:03:59.010> we<00:03:59.610> want<00:03:59.850> to

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
photo and what you want to do we want to

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:01.340 
photo and what you want to do we want to
avoid<00:04:00.210> is<00:04:00.390> hitting<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.840> left<00:04:01.080> or<00:04:01.230> the<00:04:01.260> right

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:01.350 
avoid is hitting the left or the right

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.050 
avoid is hitting the left or the right
side<00:04:01.770> of<00:04:01.890> the<00:04:01.920> histogram<00:04:02.400> you<00:04:02.550> need<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.850> right

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
side of the histogram you need the right

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.160 
side of the histogram you need the right
so<00:04:03.270> that<00:04:03.390> means<00:04:03.570> your<00:04:03.690> picture<00:04:04.020> is

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
so that means your picture is

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.960 
so that means your picture is
overexposed<00:04:04.950> where<00:04:05.220> there's<00:04:05.370> too<00:04:05.520> much<00:04:05.610> light

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
overexposed where there's too much light

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.780 
overexposed where there's too much light
if<00:04:06.420> your<00:04:06.600> histogram<00:04:07.140> hits<00:04:07.530> the<00:04:07.830> left<00:04:08.310> side<00:04:08.550> of

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
if your histogram hits the left side of

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:11.810 
if your histogram hits the left side of
the<00:04:09.000> histogram<00:04:09.450> then<00:04:10.490> it<00:04:11.490> means<00:04:11.610> your

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
the histogram then it means your

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.400 
the histogram then it means your
pictures<00:04:12.090> are<00:04:12.180> under<00:04:12.480> exposing<00:04:13.080> there's<00:04:13.260> not

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
pictures are under exposing there's not

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.500 
pictures are under exposing there's not
enough<00:04:13.680> light<00:04:13.860> and<00:04:14.220> so<00:04:14.340> you<00:04:14.400> generally<00:04:15.360> want

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:15.510 
enough light and so you generally want

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:17.150 
enough light and so you generally want
your<00:04:15.690> histogram<00:04:15.990> graph<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.680> be<00:04:16.799> somewhere<00:04:17.130> in

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
your histogram graph to be somewhere in

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:23.660 
your histogram graph to be somewhere in
the<00:04:17.280> middle<00:04:20.780> so<00:04:22.160> you're<00:04:23.160> all<00:04:23.280> set<00:04:23.310> to<00:04:23.640> start

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
the middle so you're all set to start

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.600 
the middle so you're all set to start
using<00:04:24.090> your<00:04:24.240> ken<00:04:24.540> rebel<00:04:24.780> t2i<00:04:25.550> photography<00:04:26.550> is

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
using your ken rebel t2i photography is

to understand what kind of settings will
work<00:04:32.820> in<00:04:32.940> different<00:04:33.060> situations<00:04:33.600> anyone<00:04:34.560> come
