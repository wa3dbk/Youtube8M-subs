00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
see you know they're a little bit but I

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.229 
see you know they're a little bit but I
think<00:03:16.019> look<00:03:16.380> great

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
think look great

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.060

alright<00:03:18.239> so<00:03:18.660> we're<00:03:18.810> gonna<00:03:18.900> go<00:03:19.019> down<00:03:19.170> now<00:03:19.799> this

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
alright so we're gonna go down now this

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.420 
alright so we're gonna go down now this
one<00:03:20.400> is<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> little<00:03:21.000> different<00:03:21.739> okay<00:03:22.739> because

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
one is a little different okay because

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.539 
one is a little different okay because
we<00:03:23.880> want<00:03:24.120> it<00:03:24.180> to<00:03:24.239> lean<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:24.870> left<00:03:25.400> you<00:03:26.400> would

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:26.549 
we want it to lean to the left you would

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:30.410 
we want it to lean to the left you would
say<00:03:26.850> okay<00:03:27.709> going<00:03:28.709> to<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.160> here<00:03:29.670> this<00:03:30.090> stitch

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:30.420 
say okay going to this here this stitch

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.470 
say okay going to this here this stitch
but<00:03:31.350> actually<00:03:32.040> we've<00:03:32.670> already<00:03:32.910> passed<00:03:33.450> that

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
but actually we've already passed that

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:39.500 
but actually we've already passed that
we<00:03:36.480> want<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:36.870> go<00:03:37.049> into<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.650> stitch<00:03:38.010> below<00:03:38.510> that

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
we want to go into the stitch below that

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.280 
we want to go into the stitch below that
right<00:03:39.989> here<00:03:40.709> okay<00:03:41.340> does<00:03:41.730> that<00:03:41.760> make<00:03:41.940> sense

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
right here okay does that make sense

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.199 
right here okay does that make sense
because<00:03:43.290> the<00:03:43.590> working<00:03:44.010> yarn<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.489> is<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:45.030> the

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
because the working yarn now is on the

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.259 
because the working yarn now is on the
right<00:03:45.630> side<00:03:46.069> we've<00:03:47.069> already<00:03:47.370> passed<00:03:47.880> the

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
right side we've already passed the

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:53.210 
right side we've already passed the
stitch<00:03:48.630> so<00:03:49.049> if<00:03:49.350> I<00:03:49.500> did<00:03:49.859> the<00:03:50.670> increase<00:03:51.209> here<00:03:52.220> it

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
stitch so if I did the increase here it

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.190 
stitch so if I did the increase here it
wouldn't<00:03:53.670> work<00:03:53.940> because<00:03:54.239> it<00:03:54.750> would<00:03:54.870> be<00:03:55.019> too

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
wouldn't work because it would be too

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.379 
wouldn't work because it would be too
high<00:03:55.470> it<00:03:55.799> wouldn't<00:03:56.220> be<00:03:56.340> across<00:03:56.670> from<00:03:57.060> itself

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
high it wouldn't be across from itself

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.809 
high it wouldn't be across from itself
it<00:03:57.660> would<00:03:57.810> be<00:03:57.959> on<00:03:58.230> a<00:03:58.260> different<00:03:58.500> role<00:03:58.950> okay<00:03:59.760> so

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
it would be on a different role okay so

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.910 
it would be on a different role okay so
I<00:03:59.970> hope<00:04:00.209> that<00:04:00.389> makes<00:04:00.540> sense<00:04:00.660> to<00:04:00.900> you<00:04:01.019> okay<00:04:01.859> so

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
I hope that makes sense to you okay so

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.650 
I hope that makes sense to you okay so
we're<00:04:02.280> not<00:04:02.400> gonna<00:04:02.549> go<00:04:02.760> on<00:04:02.790> this<00:04:03.030> one<00:04:03.269> we're

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
we're not gonna go on this one we're

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.420 
we're not gonna go on this one we're
going<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.810> go<00:04:03.959> into<00:04:04.319> that<00:04:04.650> stitch<00:04:04.980> so<00:04:05.250> we're

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:05.430 
going to go into that stitch so we're

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.009 
going to go into that stitch so we're
