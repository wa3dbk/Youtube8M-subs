baby you have this fancy design so the

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:58.699 
baby you have this fancy design so the
back<00:02:57.390> looks<00:02:57.720> like<00:02:57.930> this<00:02:58.080> really<00:02:58.260> nothing

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
back looks like this really nothing

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:03.170 
back looks like this really nothing
there<00:02:58.920> and<00:02:59.790> you<00:03:00.150> basically<00:03:01.220> push<00:03:02.220> it<00:03:02.430> in<00:03:02.580> and

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
there and you basically push it in and

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:05.740 
there and you basically push it in and
you<00:03:03.900> should<00:03:04.080> hear<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.350> click

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:05.750 
you should hear a click

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.060 
you should hear a click
sometimes<00:03:06.750> you<00:03:06.840> don't<00:03:07.020> hear<00:03:07.260> clear<00:03:07.560> but<00:03:07.709> most

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
sometimes you don't hear clear but most

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:10.160 
sometimes you don't hear clear but most
sometimes<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.790> do<00:03:08.970> this<00:03:09.630> is<00:03:09.720> what<00:03:09.840> it<00:03:09.930> should

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
sometimes you do this is what it should

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:12.860 
sometimes you do this is what it should
look<00:03:10.230> like<00:03:10.440> when<00:03:10.860> you<00:03:10.950> insert<00:03:11.280> it<00:03:11.660> my<00:03:12.660> only

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
look like when you insert it my only

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.960 
look like when you insert it my only
gripe<00:03:13.230> about<00:03:13.470> this<00:03:13.830> is<00:03:14.010> that<00:03:14.160> the<00:03:14.340> star<00:03:14.670> is

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
gripe about this is that the star is

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:17.090 
gripe about this is that the star is
actually<00:03:15.810> slightly<00:03:16.049> smaller<00:03:16.650> than<00:03:16.980> in<00:03:17.070> the

00:03:19.039 --> 00:03:19.049 
actual one the star is bigger than the

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:24.500 
actual one the star is bigger than the
actual<00:03:20.720> neckline<00:03:21.720> in<00:03:21.900> here<00:03:22.140> and<00:03:23.180> this<00:03:24.180> is<00:03:24.330> what

rating<00:05:09.780> out<00:05:09.900> of<00:05:09.930> 10<00:05:10.260> I<00:05:10.710> would<00:05:11.699> give<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.419> a<00:05:12.630> 7

00:05:13.149 --> 00:05:13.159 
rating out of 10 I would give it a 7

00:05:13.159 --> 00:05:15.770 
rating out of 10 I would give it a 7
mainly<00:05:14.159> because<00:05:14.340> it<00:05:14.789> only<00:05:14.849> covers<00:05:15.330> the<00:05:15.510> front

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:15.780 
mainly because it only covers the front

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:17.540 
mainly because it only covers the front
and<00:05:16.139> not<00:05:16.320> the<00:05:16.380> back<00:05:16.530> the<00:05:16.919> whole<00:05:17.099> start<00:05:17.400> thought

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:17.550 
and not the back the whole start thought

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.290 
and not the back the whole start thought
it<00:05:17.639> would<00:05:17.760> be<00:05:17.880> a<00:05:17.909> big<00:05:18.180> 3d<00:05:19.169> star<00:05:19.530> and<00:05:19.949> also<00:05:20.940> that

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
it would be a big 3d star and also that

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:24.260 
it would be a big 3d star and also that
the<00:05:21.389> star<00:05:21.599> is<00:05:21.630> slightly<00:05:22.530> small<00:05:23.010> but<00:05:24.000> overall

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:24.270 
the star is slightly small but overall

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:27.230 
the star is slightly small but overall
it<00:05:24.659> -<00:05:25.199> it's<00:05:25.680> not<00:05:25.830> a<00:05:25.860> disappointment<00:05:26.610> to<00:05:26.669> me<00:05:26.880> so
