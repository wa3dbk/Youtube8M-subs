00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.000
 hello in this video I'm going to share 

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:12.670
 which is what I carry in my backpack that 

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.339
 is on the beach or for the pool or 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.869
 when is the goal park or any 

00:00:15.339 --> 00:00:20.320
 thing that has to do with summer 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:22.989
 as you can see I bring you super full and 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.509
 it's because I for everything a little too much 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:28.570
 If I'm going on a trip, he packed up more if he 's 

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:31.340
 something in the house packed up others and record 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.190
 that I do not fit even my hat 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.370
 and my towel but I always wear a hat 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:40.340
 and I like this one because it has the little thing 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.130
 so you can play and run and 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.200
 everything and you will not fall and the wind me 

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.629
 I really like it I bought it in chillÃ¡n 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.090
 gangs that I take then my little face towel 

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:52.280
 I do not bring it but the current one I hang it 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.350
 here so that I stay like the backpack and 

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:57.170
 I'm agreeing on the add-on and now 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.690
 entering my bag 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.970
 the first thing is a type of snack today 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:04.550
 I have almonds but you have almonds 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:07.610
 fruits vegetables whatever sweet 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.009
 small and easy to eat I have something 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.450
 to entertain me many things to 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.369
 entertain him because when I go to the 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:15.530
 I like beach so it's worth it and 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:18.140
 that some good hours and I like with 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:21.080
 this exceeded to look for the words with 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.060
 the down since I get bored this reads a 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.710
 book this book makes me laugh 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:26.539
 very much I read about ten times 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:28.670
 keep on always going to laugh no matter 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:30.740
 counted the gift in two and if I do not want 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:32.810
 read a book then I got a magazine 

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:35.569
 today of regular glamor that is the one of 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.650
 July this month and I take two 

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:40.730
 blockers 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:43.100
 this one that is protective of 30 hydrates 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:46.010
 well rich do not leave anything greasy the 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.930
 body or face but for meat 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:52.220
 special I have this that is of our 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:54.440
 china and is 55 and experts in granites 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.660
 do you know that for a while I was 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.180
 is creating with that and I bought this for 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:01.100
 better prevent granites 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.470
 but every half hour that makes a 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.720
 beach or 40 minutes I like to apply 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.030
 our time blocker and hands with 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:09.950
 sand I do not like cream I like the 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.190
 spray nothing more of all that in all the 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.010
 face and body and it's super good 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:17.630
 boat for my water and I like it to be 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:19.850
 You can turn inside and put a 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:22.730
 little chili and bring the water my 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:25.490
 wallet with my cards a t-shirt 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.860
 extra because you always occupy something 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:29.990
 entrusting here is never missing 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.990
 my phone with hearing aids to listen 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:34.940
 music or take pictures or what I am to 

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:38.150
 sometimes calls but some music and 

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.010
 hearing aids wipes for 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:42.470
 you do not know this as a life saver 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.560
 because it is what we have from the beach is the 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:47.209
 sand as you stick your hands is fine 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.209
 uncomfortable I like to clean up with 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:53.360
 wipes the antibacterial that is for 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:55.760
 that more of the owners obviously after 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:58.430
 I put on my sunscreen 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.290
 this to tan me but I do not use this 

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:04.129
 I just always use it on top of a 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:07.430
 protector because this nothing else has 34 

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:09.680
 almost nothing has but here we are I want 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.859
 take advantage of and use is above that a 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:16.190
 comb because axel is from the sea the hair you 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.829
 one tooth remains and this and I do not like 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:20.629
 catch my hairs to refresh me 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:22.909
 like to go to our little water bottles 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.970
 it's like a spray and it's nothing more 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:28.200
 Water 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.540
 and it refreshes you and you feel more comfortable 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:34.210
 I have my camera and the only two 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.240
 Beauty products that I use is a 

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:39.670
 mask against water this is the same 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:42.310
 manga de l'orel is what I bring now 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.950
 let it dry and nothing fills me 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:48.100
 eyelashes and I put on the two layers of this 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.870
 and I love it with a lot of wind 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.590
 says that those that are against water like 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.960
 this lasts more Chinese with them and 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:57.430
 I think it's true I like it a lot 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.280
 every time you see on the beach after 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.990
 there we get hungry and we go to eat and 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:04.030
 I do not like Alberto as well as pale and 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:06.670
 burned I like a little color my 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:12.850
 lips and this is the great color this 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:16.800
 Thein Masters in India intrigue the 001 and 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.800
 I like it because it gives you shine 

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:23.000
 the color and apart a jet lasts you 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:25.250
 because it paints your lips makes you like 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.259
 since you take it off you have this 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.449
 little color but lighter on the lips 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:31.460
 even if you eat and I like it very much 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:33.229
 color parts is perfect for the 

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:35.360
 I also take an hour 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.129
 perfume nothing more hostile for after 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:39.379
 the beach that we are going to eat I do not like 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.900
 stink I put nothing was not equipped quito and 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:44.900
 and returns it rich so I love the 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:46.729
 peaceful point of something super super 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:50.690
 important to me this is a brooch 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.449
 cited and leagues and the latest are lenses 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:56.960
 these are super badges cost like 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:59.810
 five dollars I think and I like that they are 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.490
 super dark and it's not pressing to 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.620
 handle because they are very dark but 

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:05.360
 I like for the beach to produce 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.430
 they cover the sun a lot and many of my 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:09.379
 I met her in the world 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:11.360
 games we all know that world games are 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:13.789
 around the corner that I love 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:16.759
 of them and something exciting is that 

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:18.979
 walking is having a as a contest 

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:20.840
 right now if they go down in the little box 

00:05:18.979 --> 00:05:22.550
 of information there is a link that can be 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:25.850
 order 100 dollars to buy 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.710
 and things I hope you liked us
