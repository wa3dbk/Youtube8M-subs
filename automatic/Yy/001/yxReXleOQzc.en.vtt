00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:50.790 
moving around a lot more than the

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:52.190 
moving around a lot more than the
previous<00:03:51.150> game<00:03:51.329> he's<00:03:51.540> moving<00:03:51.810> around<00:03:51.930> a

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:52.200 
previous game he's moving around a

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.610 
previous game he's moving around a
fucking<00:03:52.939> button<00:03:53.939> and<00:03:54.209> I<00:03:54.900> missed<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:55.349> jump

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620 
fucking button and I missed that jump

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:58.069 
fucking button and I missed that jump
scare<00:03:55.890> because<00:03:56.189> and<00:03:56.459> the<00:03:57.209> screen<00:03:57.810> seemed<00:03:57.989> to

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
scare because and the screen seemed to

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.869 
scare because and the screen seemed to
black<00:03:58.290> out<00:03:58.470> on<00:03:58.590> me<00:03:58.680> so<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:58.829> think<00:03:59.040> that<00:03:59.250> appears

00:03:59.869 --> 00:03:59.879 
black out on me so I think that appears

00:03:59.879 --> 00:04:01.429 
black out on me so I think that appears
to<00:04:00.000> be<00:04:00.090> some<00:04:00.299> kind<00:04:00.480> of<00:04:00.569> glitch<00:04:00.629> but<00:04:01.109> overall
