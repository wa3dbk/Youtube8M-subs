00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:18.039 
to remove the cap off of the reservoir

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.189 
to remove the cap off of the reservoir
so<00:00:18.250> what<00:00:19.000> I<00:00:19.029> want<00:00:19.270> to<00:00:19.330> do<00:00:19.449> here<00:00:19.690> is<00:00:19.720> put<00:00:19.900> a<00:00:19.930> rag

so what I want to do here is put a rag

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.470 
so what I want to do here is put a rag
over<00:00:20.560> just<00:00:20.859> so<00:00:21.430> you<00:00:21.490> don't<00:00:21.730> get<00:00:21.850> burned<00:00:22.090> all

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:22.480 
over just so you don't get burned all

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:25.670 
over just so you don't get burned all
right

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:30.600 

and<00:00:26.680> always<00:00:26.830> open<00:00:27.280> these<00:00:27.370> slowly<00:00:29.430> all<00:00:30.430> right

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:30.610 
and always open these slowly all right

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.060 
and always open these slowly all right
now<00:00:31.020> there's<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.079> couple<00:00:32.259> different<00:00:32.410> tests<00:00:32.949> you

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:33.070 
now there's a couple different tests you

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.950 
now there's a couple different tests you
can<00:00:33.190> do<00:00:33.340> an<00:00:33.460> antifreeze<00:00:34.739> one<00:00:36.420> is<00:00:37.420> a<00:00:37.480> tester

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
can do an antifreeze one is a tester

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.069 
can do an antifreeze one is a tester
like<00:00:38.140> this<00:00:38.379> all<00:00:38.859> right<00:00:39.929> everybody's<00:00:40.929> prey

00:00:41.069 --> 00:00:41.079 
like this all right everybody's prey

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:43.349 
like this all right everybody's prey
familiar<00:00:41.530> with<00:00:41.649> these<00:00:41.829> and<00:00:42.670> how<00:00:42.789> to<00:00:42.850> use<00:00:43.120> them

00:00:43.349 --> 00:00:43.359 
familiar with these and how to use them

00:00:43.359 --> 00:00:47.250 
familiar with these and how to use them
but<00:00:43.569> what<00:00:44.409> we<00:00:44.559> do<00:00:44.769> is<00:00:45.010> you'll<00:00:45.780> push<00:00:46.780> it<00:00:46.929> down<00:00:47.109> in

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
but what we do is you'll push it down in

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.110 
but what we do is you'll push it down in
there<00:00:47.409> and<00:00:47.499> free<00:00:47.769> squeeze<00:00:48.249> the<00:00:48.399> ball<00:00:48.609> burr<00:00:48.850> and

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:49.120 
there and free squeeze the ball burr and

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.989 
there and free squeeze the ball burr and
you'll<00:00:49.239> suck<00:00:49.479> some<00:00:49.629> antifreeze<00:00:49.870> up<00:00:50.289> okay<00:00:51.010> now

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:51.999 
you'll suck some antifreeze up okay now

00:00:51.999 --> 00:00:56.639 
you'll suck some antifreeze up okay now
I'm<00:00:52.389> not<00:00:52.600> sure<00:00:52.780> if<00:00:52.899> you<00:00:52.989> can<00:00:53.109> see<00:00:53.319> this<00:00:55.379> but<00:00:56.379> you

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
I'm not sure if you can see this but you

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:59.039 
I'm not sure if you can see this but you
look<00:00:57.489> over<00:00:57.819> on<00:00:57.850> the<00:00:58.059> corresponding<00:00:58.749> scale

00:00:59.039 --> 00:00:59.049 
look over on the corresponding scale

00:00:59.049 --> 00:01:01.049 
look over on the corresponding scale
here<00:00:59.440> and<00:00:59.530> this<00:01:00.339> will<00:01:00.489> tell<00:01:00.670> you<00:01:00.789> what<00:01:00.940> your

00:01:01.049 --> 00:01:01.059 
here and this will tell you what your

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:03.029 
here and this will tell you what your
freeze<00:01:01.299> point<00:01:01.600> is<00:01:01.749> and<00:01:02.049> it<00:01:02.109> looks<00:01:02.139> like<00:01:02.499> I'm

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
freeze point is and it looks like I'm

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:06.060 
freeze point is and it looks like I'm
right<00:01:03.249> around<00:01:03.399> 20<00:01:03.879> below<00:01:04.030> all<00:01:04.570> right<00:01:05.070> maybe

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
right around 20 below all right maybe

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.300 
right around 20 below all right maybe
just<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.460> little<00:01:06.700> bit<00:01:07.060> less<00:01:07.270> maybe<00:01:07.479> teen<00:01:08.310> but

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:09.310 
just a little bit less maybe teen but

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:10.679 
just a little bit less maybe teen but
that's<00:01:09.549> pretty<00:01:09.729> much<00:01:09.939> how<00:01:10.180> you<00:01:10.240> test<00:01:10.539> the

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
that's pretty much how you test the

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.450 
that's pretty much how you test the
freezing<00:01:11.079> points<00:01:11.409> and<00:01:11.530> grant<00:01:11.740> freeze<00:01:12.070> okay

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:12.460 
freezing points and grant freeze okay

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.539 
freezing points and grant freeze okay
there's<00:01:13.240> another<00:01:13.479> test<00:01:13.840> which<00:01:14.829> really<00:01:15.340> should

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
there's another test which really should

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:16.830 
there's another test which really should
do<00:01:15.670> especially<00:01:16.000> if<00:01:16.210> you're<00:01:16.329> running<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.659> red

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:16.840 
do especially if you're running the red

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.609 
do especially if you're running the red
antifreeze<00:01:20.369> Peter<00:01:22.200> you're<00:01:23.200> going<00:01:23.380> to<00:01:23.439> want<00:01:23.590> to

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:23.619 
antifreeze Peter you're going to want to

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:26.639 
antifreeze Peter you're going to want to
go<00:01:23.740> over<00:01:23.770> here<00:01:24.039> to<00:01:24.189> the<00:01:24.280> 20<00:01:24.609> volt<00:01:25.079> DC<00:01:26.079> scale

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:26.649 
go over here to the 20 volt DC scale

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:33.359 
go over here to the 20 volt DC scale
okay<00:01:27.869> now<00:01:28.869> a<00:01:30.210> lot<00:01:31.210> of<00:01:31.329> people<00:01:31.979> have<00:01:32.979> different

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
okay now a lot of people have different

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:36.419 
okay now a lot of people have different
opinions<00:01:33.430> on<00:01:33.939> this<00:01:34.710> but<00:01:35.710> to<00:01:35.740> me<00:01:35.979> it<00:01:36.219> doesn't

00:01:36.419 --> 00:01:36.429 
opinions on this but to me it doesn't

00:01:36.429 --> 00:01:38.730 
opinions on this but to me it doesn't
matter<00:01:36.729> which<00:01:37.060> lead<00:01:37.329> you<00:01:37.570> stick<00:01:37.810> in<00:01:38.049> because

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
matter which lead you stick in because

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.289 
matter which lead you stick in because
you're<00:01:38.950> just<00:01:39.100> looking<00:01:39.250> for<00:01:39.460> the<00:01:39.640> reading<00:01:40.060> you

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:40.299 
you're just looking for the reading you

00:01:40.299 --> 00:01:42.630 
you're just looking for the reading you
don't<00:01:40.509> really<00:01:40.630> care<00:01:40.750> if<00:01:40.990> it's<00:01:41.259> a<00:01:41.350> minus<00:01:41.619> or<00:01:42.579> a

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
don't really care if it's a minus or a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.490 
don't really care if it's a minus or a
positive<00:01:42.909> reading<00:01:43.390> that's<00:01:43.869> not<00:01:44.049> really<00:01:44.350> what

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:44.500 
positive reading that's not really what

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.599 
positive reading that's not really what
you're<00:01:44.590> looking<00:01:44.619> for<00:01:45.009> you're<00:01:45.100> looking<00:01:45.130> for

over<00:01:52.899> here<00:01:53.140> I'm<00:01:53.259> going<00:01:53.409> to<00:01:53.499> use<00:01:53.590> the<00:01:53.770> head<00:01:53.950> okay

00:01:54.539 --> 00:01:54.549 
over here I'm going to use the head okay

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:56.130 
over here I'm going to use the head okay
that<00:01:54.850> it's<00:01:54.999> right<00:01:55.299> here<00:01:55.570> it's<00:01:55.659> clean<00:01:55.929> and<00:01:56.049> I

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140

can do it now the other lead you want to
sit<00:01:59.950> down<00:02:00.100> into<00:02:00.460> the<00:02:00.689> antifreeze<00:02:01.689> and<00:02:02.530> all<00:02:02.649> you

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:02.799 
sit down into the antifreeze and all you

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:04.529 
sit down into the antifreeze and all you
got<00:02:02.950> to<00:02:03.039> do<00:02:03.130> is<00:02:03.310> get<00:02:03.460> the<00:02:03.700> tip<00:02:04.119> of<00:02:04.299> the<00:02:04.359> lead

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:04.539 
got to do is get the tip of the lead

00:02:04.539 --> 00:02:07.200 
got to do is get the tip of the lead
into<00:02:04.780> the<00:02:04.990> inner<00:02:05.140> freeze<00:02:05.609> you<00:02:06.609> don't<00:02:06.789> have<00:02:06.939> to

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
into the inner freeze you don't have to

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:08.910 
into the inner freeze you don't have to
put<00:02:07.749> the<00:02:07.869> whole<00:02:07.990> lead<00:02:08.200> in<00:02:08.380> or<00:02:08.500> nothing<00:02:08.800> then

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
put the whole lead in or nothing then

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.050 
put the whole lead in or nothing then
you<00:02:09.009> want<00:02:09.160> to<00:02:09.190> try<00:02:09.310> to<00:02:09.399> make<00:02:09.580> sure<00:02:09.610> it<00:02:09.880> doesn't

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
you want to try to make sure it doesn't

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:11.130 
you want to try to make sure it doesn't
touch<00:02:10.300> anything<00:02:10.569> else<00:02:10.750> in<00:02:10.960> there<00:02:11.080> especially

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.140 
touch anything else in there especially

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:13.920 
touch anything else in there especially
for<00:02:11.440> something<00:02:11.770> metal<00:02:12.220> all<00:02:12.400> right

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
for something metal all right

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.509 
for something metal all right
now<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.230> don't<00:02:14.409> know<00:02:14.560> if<00:02:14.620> you<00:02:14.709> can<00:02:14.829> see<00:02:15.010> on<00:02:15.159> here

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
now I don't know if you can see on here

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.479 
now I don't know if you can see on here
but<00:02:15.819> I<00:02:16.060> have<00:02:16.450> a<00:02:16.540> point<00:02:16.870> one<00:02:17.170> well<00:02:18.129> it's<00:02:18.310> changed

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
but I have a point one well it's changed

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.330 
but I have a point one well it's changed
a<00:02:18.700> little<00:02:18.760> bit<00:02:19.000> I'm<00:02:19.510> basically<00:02:19.930> 0.1<00:02:20.709> volts

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
a little bit I'm basically 0.1 volts

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:26.039 
a little bit I'm basically 0.1 volts
okay<00:02:21.989> that<00:02:22.989> is<00:02:23.170> very<00:02:23.439> acceptable<00:02:24.930> what<00:02:25.930> you're

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.049 
okay that is very acceptable what you're

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.830 
okay that is very acceptable what you're
looking<00:02:26.379> for<00:02:26.620> here<00:02:26.950> is<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.909> want<00:02:28.030> to<00:02:28.150> be<00:02:28.329> point

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
looking for here is you want to be point

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.830 
looking for here is you want to be point
5<00:02:29.409> volts<00:02:30.040> or<00:02:30.220> less<00:02:31.170> all<00:02:32.170> right<00:02:33.329> point<00:02:34.329> seven

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
5 volts or less all right point seven

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.080 
5 volts or less all right point seven
and<00:02:34.930> above<00:02:35.290> you<00:02:35.769> should<00:02:35.909> change<00:02:36.909> your

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:37.090 
and above you should change your

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.020 
and above you should change your
antifreeze<00:02:37.829> thing<00:02:38.829> is<00:02:39.040> antifreeze<00:02:39.730> has

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
antifreeze thing is antifreeze has

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.089 
antifreeze thing is antifreeze has
corrosion<00:02:40.659> inhibitors<00:02:41.170> it<00:02:41.650> also<00:02:41.799> has<00:02:42.069> a

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:42.099 
corrosion inhibitors it also has a

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:43.740 
corrosion inhibitors it also has a
lubricant<00:02:42.579> in<00:02:42.700> it<00:02:42.849> and<00:02:43.060> stuff<00:02:43.359> so<00:02:43.599> it's

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
lubricant in it and stuff so it's

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.360 
lubricant in it and stuff so it's
actually<00:02:43.959> not<00:02:44.260> permanent<00:02:44.890> even<00:02:45.010> though<00:02:45.220> it

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually not permanent even though it

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.000 
actually not permanent even though it
says<00:02:45.579> permanent<00:02:46.090> antifreeze<00:02:46.480> on<00:02:46.690> them

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
says permanent antifreeze on them

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.430 
says permanent antifreeze on them
especially<00:02:48.010> the<00:02:48.069> red<00:02:48.340> it<00:02:48.519> will<00:02:48.639> break<00:02:48.940> down<00:02:49.440> a

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
especially the red it will break down a

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.849 
especially the red it will break down a
lot<00:02:51.190> of<00:02:51.310> motors<00:02:51.639> also<00:02:52.090> or<00:02:52.269> aluminum<00:02:52.780> and<00:02:53.049> iron

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:53.859 
lot of motors also or aluminum and iron

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:57.569 
lot of motors also or aluminum and iron
combined<00:02:54.609> pieces<00:02:55.510> and<00:02:55.930> what<00:02:56.739> happens<00:02:57.129> is<00:02:57.340> the

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
combined pieces and what happens is the

00:02:57.579 --> 00:02:59.099 
combined pieces and what happens is the
red<00:02:57.790> antifreeze<00:02:58.269> especially<00:02:58.810> you'll<00:02:58.900> start

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
red antifreeze especially you'll start

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:01.020 
red antifreeze especially you'll start
breaking<00:02:59.500> down<00:02:59.530> and<00:03:00.129> that's<00:03:00.670> why<00:03:00.849> you're

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
breaking down and that's why you're

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.440 
breaking down and that's why you're
checking<00:03:01.239> this<00:03:01.629> for<00:03:02.079> DC<00:03:02.859> voltage<00:03:03.340> once<00:03:04.299> you

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
checking this for DC voltage once you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.449 
checking this for DC voltage once you
get<00:03:04.599> over<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.900> certain<00:03:05.079> amount<00:03:05.859> of<00:03:06.040> voltage

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
get over a certain amount of voltage

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:09.270 
get over a certain amount of voltage
what<00:03:07.450> will<00:03:07.569> happen<00:03:07.989> is<00:03:08.170> the<00:03:08.650> antifreeze<00:03:08.950> will

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
what will happen is the antifreeze will

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.399 
what will happen is the antifreeze will
start<00:03:09.459> breaking<00:03:09.639> down<00:03:09.849> and<00:03:10.510> loses<00:03:10.900> qualities

00:03:11.399 --> 00:03:11.409 
start breaking down and loses qualities

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:13.800 
start breaking down and loses qualities
and<00:03:12.189> then<00:03:12.430> what<00:03:12.700> happened<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.269> you'll<00:03:13.689> start

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:13.810 
and then what happened is you'll start

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:16.199 
and then what happened is you'll start
eating<00:03:14.319> gaskets<00:03:14.889> and<00:03:15.069> different<00:03:15.849> things<00:03:16.090> in

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
eating gaskets and different things in

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:17.520 
eating gaskets and different things in
the<00:03:16.359> motor<00:03:16.569> it<00:03:16.810> will<00:03:16.930> actually<00:03:17.049> you<00:03:17.290> can<00:03:17.409> eat

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
the motor it will actually you can eat

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.220 
the motor it will actually you can eat
the<00:03:17.680> metal<00:03:17.889> in<00:03:18.129> the<00:03:18.220> motor<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.810> a<00:03:19.810> lot<00:03:20.199> of

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
the metal in the motor and a lot of

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:23.550 
the metal in the motor and a lot of
times<00:03:20.530> neglect<00:03:21.160> of<00:03:21.280> this<00:03:21.459> antifreeze<00:03:22.260> is<00:03:23.260> why

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
times neglect of this antifreeze is why

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.860 
times neglect of this antifreeze is why
a<00:03:23.590> lot<00:03:23.859> of<00:03:23.889> people<00:03:24.010> will<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.870> gasket

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:25.870 
a lot of people will have gasket

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.039 
a lot of people will have gasket
failures<00:03:26.489> and<00:03:27.489> different<00:03:28.419> kind<00:03:28.599> of<00:03:28.629> failures

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:29.049 
failures and different kind of failures

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:32.099 
failures and different kind of failures
due<00:03:29.260> to<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:30.449> eating<00:03:31.449> the<00:03:31.480> insides<00:03:31.870> of<00:03:32.019> their

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
due to the eating the insides of their

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:34.140 
due to the eating the insides of their
motors<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.220> it's<00:03:33.340> always<00:03:33.519> a<00:03:33.639> good<00:03:33.849> thing

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
motors so it's always a good thing

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.360 
motors so it's always a good thing
to<00:03:34.720> check<00:03:35.049> your<00:03:35.079> antifreeze<00:03:35.560> for<00:03:36.069> freezing

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
to check your antifreeze for freezing

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:39.030 
to check your antifreeze for freezing
point<00:03:36.790> and<00:03:37.060> check<00:03:37.930> it<00:03:38.079> with<00:03:38.199> a<00:03:38.230> voltmeter<00:03:38.590> to

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
point and check it with a voltmeter to

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.860 
point and check it with a voltmeter to
see<00:03:39.449> if<00:03:40.650> you're<00:03:41.650> getting<00:03:41.859> above<00:03:42.250> the<00:03:42.870> limit

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:43.870 
see if you're getting above the limit

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:45.059 
see if you're getting above the limit
that<00:03:44.019> you<00:03:44.109> will<00:03:44.229> need<00:03:44.349> to<00:03:44.440> change<00:03:44.709> it<00:03:44.859> or<00:03:44.949> not

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:45.069 
that you will need to change it or not

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:48.390 
that you will need to change it or not
that's<00:03:45.699> point<00:03:46.359> 5<00:03:46.720> volts<00:03:47.229> and<00:03:47.319> less<00:03:47.590> you're

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:48.400 
that's point 5 volts and less you're

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.050 
that's point 5 volts and less you're
okay<00:03:49.269> I<00:03:49.540> like<00:03:50.229> to<00:03:50.379> see<00:03:50.590> less<00:03:50.829> than<00:03:50.859> 0.5<00:03:51.579> volts

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
okay I like to see less than 0.5 volts

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:56.699 
okay I like to see less than 0.5 volts
but<00:03:52.720> if<00:03:53.590> it's<00:03:53.919> point<00:03:54.370> 7<00:03:54.849> or<00:03:54.970> higher<00:03:55.409> you<00:03:56.409> really

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
but if it's point 7 or higher you really

00:03:56.709 --> 00:03:58.409 
but if it's point 7 or higher you really
should<00:03:56.919> think<00:03:56.949> about<00:03:57.220> flushing<00:03:57.729> your<00:03:58.030> system

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
should think about flushing your system

00:03:58.419 --> 00:04:01.770 
should think about flushing your system
and<00:03:59.489> changing<00:04:00.489> your<00:04:00.639> antifreeze<00:04:00.909> before<00:04:01.690> it

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
and changing your antifreeze before it

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.819 
and changing your antifreeze before it
does<00:04:01.930> harm<00:04:02.139> to<00:04:02.290> your<00:04:02.379> motor

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
does harm to your motor
