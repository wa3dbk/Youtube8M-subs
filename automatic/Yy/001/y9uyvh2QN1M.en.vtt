problem but the government can certainly

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:55.700 
problem but the government can certainly
make<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.869> lot<00:01:55.049> worse<00:01:55.259> and<00:01:55.560> they're

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
make it a lot worse and they're

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
make it a lot worse and they're
proceeding<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.280> do<00:01:56.430> it<00:01:56.579> with<00:01:56.880> every<00:01:57.270> new

with<00:02:02.310> what<00:02:02.520> they're<00:02:02.670> doing<00:02:03.740> no<00:02:04.740> I<00:02:05.159> mean<00:02:05.670> I

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
with what they're doing no I mean I

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.459 
with what they're doing no I mean I
think<00:02:05.789> it's<00:02:06.149> very<00:02:06.210> reasonable<00:02:06.780> what<00:02:07.320> they're

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
think it's very reasonable what they're

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.630 
think it's very reasonable what they're
doing<00:02:07.859> I<00:02:08.130> think<00:02:09.320> stepping<00:02:10.320> in<00:02:10.470> to<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.400> degree

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
doing I think stepping in to the degree

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.940 
doing I think stepping in to the degree
that<00:02:11.670> they<00:02:11.879> have<00:02:12.090> is<00:02:12.269> necessary<00:02:12.840> I<00:02:13.140> think<00:02:13.830> it

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
that they have is necessary I think it

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:14.509 
that they have is necessary I think it
will

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
will

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.009 
will
it<00:02:14.700> won't<00:02:14.879> forestall<00:02:15.360> a<00:02:15.390> very<00:02:15.690> severe

00:02:16.009 --> 00:02:16.019 
it won't forestall a very severe

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:16.550 
it won't forestall a very severe
recession

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
recession

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.010 
recession
that's<00:02:16.830> coming<00:02:17.280> but<00:02:18.239> I<00:02:18.270> think<00:02:18.510> it's<00:02:18.660> necessary

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:19.020 
that's coming but I think it's necessary

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:20.930 
that's coming but I think it's necessary
to<00:02:19.380> force<00:02:19.890> all<00:02:20.069> something<00:02:20.459> we<00:02:20.489> haven't<00:02:20.700> seen

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
to force all something we haven't seen

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.610 
to force all something we haven't seen
since<00:02:21.209> the<00:02:21.390> great<00:02:21.569> but<00:02:21.780> not<00:02:22.230> learned<00:02:22.470> our

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
since the great but not learned our

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.870 
since the great but not learned our
lesson<00:02:23.010> I<00:02:23.099> mean<00:02:23.250> I<00:02:23.340> think<00:02:23.400> that's<00:02:23.700> basically

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
lesson I mean I think that's basically

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.490 
lesson I mean I think that's basically
Peter's<00:02:24.569> point<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.110> by<00:02:25.260> bailing

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
Peter's point is that by bailing

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.199 
Peter's point is that by bailing
everyone<00:02:26.069> out<00:02:26.220> we<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.489> not<00:02:26.640> learning<00:02:27.090> our

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
and first you know I don't think that

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.660 
and first you know I don't think that
the<00:03:30.570> average<00:03:30.840> American<00:03:31.320> truly<00:03:31.890> understands

that<00:03:36.989> link<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:37.530> think<00:03:37.799> though<00:03:37.920> I<00:03:38.569> think<00:03:39.569> that

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
that link I think though I think that

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:40.940 
that link I think though I think that
they<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:39.810> understand<00:03:40.410> it<00:03:40.530> but<00:03:40.620> that<00:03:40.769> they're

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
they do understand it but that they're

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:42.800 
they do understand it but that they're
so<00:03:41.190> pissed<00:03:41.549> off<00:03:41.790> by<00:03:42.090> what's<00:03:42.299> happened<00:03:42.690> that

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
so pissed off by what's happened that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.030 
so pissed off by what's happened that
they're<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.140> they're<00:03:43.260> not<00:03:43.530> willing<00:03:43.799> to

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
they're that they're not willing to

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.920 
they're that they're not willing to
basically<00:03:44.280> they're<00:03:45.090> willing<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.450> forfeit

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
basically they're willing to forfeit

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.930 
basically they're willing to forfeit
their<00:03:46.109> own<00:03:46.260> job<00:03:46.590> in<00:03:46.799> my<00:03:46.920> opinion<00:03:47.340> in<00:03:47.670> order<00:03:47.760> to

their own job in my opinion in order to

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.009 
their own job in my opinion in order to
make<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.180> mortgage<00:03:48.480> we<00:03:48.630> could<00:03:48.750> argue<00:03:48.870> about

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
make that mortgage we could argue about

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.309 
make that mortgage we could argue about
that<00:03:49.260> another<00:03:49.470> right<00:03:50.780> behavioral<00:03:51.780> economics

that another right behavioral economics

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:54.379 
that another right behavioral economics
right<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.769> don't<00:03:53.549> agree<00:03:53.850> with<00:03:54.000> that<00:03:54.060> I<00:03:54.180> don't

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389 
right I don't agree with that I don't

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.460 
right I don't agree with that I don't
think<00:03:54.540> they're<00:03:54.630> make<00:03:54.780> they've<00:03:55.019> made<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.319> link

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
think they're make they've made the link

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:56.750 
think they're make they've made the link
yet<00:03:55.650> but<00:03:55.769> they<00:03:55.889> will<00:03:55.920> and<00:03:56.430> once<00:03:56.670> they

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:56.760 
yet but they will and once they

00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.460 
yet but they will and once they
understand<00:03:57.180> that<00:03:57.389> and<00:03:57.540> that's<00:03:57.600> why<00:03:57.810> the<00:03:57.870> the

00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:58.470 
understand that and that's why the the

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.050 
understand that and that's why the the
support<00:03:58.739> for<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.100> legislation<00:03:59.160> changed

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
support for this legislation changed

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.090 
support for this legislation changed
within<00:04:00.329> a<00:04:00.389> few<00:04:00.540> days<00:04:00.690> because<00:04:00.840> I<00:04:01.769> think<00:04:02.040> it

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
within a few days because I think it

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.500 
within a few days because I think it
changed<00:04:02.489> was<00:04:02.579> because<00:04:02.880> of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> bribes<00:04:03.299> that

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:03.510 
changed was because of the bribes that

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.670 
changed was because of the bribes that
were<00:04:03.600> put<00:04:03.750> in<00:04:03.840> the<00:04:03.930> bill<00:04:04.079> to<00:04:04.109> get<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.470> voters

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680 
were put in the bill to get the voters

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:06.650 
were put in the bill to get the voters
to<00:04:05.100> the<00:04:05.250> necessary<00:04:05.730> vote<00:04:06.180> so<00:04:06.329> that<00:04:06.359> we<00:04:06.510> give

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
to the necessary vote so that we give

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:08.750 
to the necessary vote so that we give
people<00:04:06.810> rum<00:04:07.109> factories<00:04:07.560> and<00:04:07.709> arrowheads<00:04:08.459> in

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
people rum factories and arrowheads in

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.190 
people rum factories and arrowheads in
order<00:04:09.120> to<00:04:09.209> get<00:04:09.329> the<00:04:09.420> votes<00:04:09.630> last<00:04:09.840> night<00:04:10.079> right

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
order to get the votes last night right

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.349 
order to get the votes last night right
and<00:04:10.620> I<00:04:10.709> don't<00:04:10.769> think<00:04:10.980> inflation<00:04:11.790> can<00:04:12.030> go<00:04:12.209> into

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:12.359 
and I don't think inflation can go into

00:04:12.359 --> 00:04:13.910 
and I don't think inflation can go into
one<00:04:12.569> of<00:04:12.600> the<00:04:12.750> other<00:04:12.780> points<00:04:13.049> that<00:04:13.230> you<00:04:13.319> made<00:04:13.500> it

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
one of the other points that you made it

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.400 
one of the other points that you made it
is<00:04:14.130> an<00:04:14.310> issue<00:04:14.430> not<00:04:14.790> for<00:04:15.120> this<00:04:15.239> year<00:04:15.569> I<00:04:15.600> mean<00:04:15.900> the

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:16.410 
is an issue not for this year I mean the

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:19.250 
is an issue not for this year I mean the
economic<00:04:17.250> body<00:04:17.459> barely<00:04:18.030> breathing<00:04:18.479> it's<00:04:19.109> not

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260 
economic body barely breathing it's not

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.900 
economic body barely breathing it's not
it's<00:04:19.500> not<00:04:19.620> even<00:04:19.769> it's<00:04:20.130> not<00:04:20.220> even<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.549> its<00:04:20.700> feet

it's not even it's not even on its feet
let<00:04:21.539> alone<00:04:21.570> running<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.289> mean<00:04:22.650> I<00:04:22.680> do<00:04:22.800> think<00:04:22.889> a

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
let alone running I mean I do think a

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:24.710 
let alone running I mean I do think a
year<00:04:23.490> from<00:04:23.669> now<00:04:23.760> maybe<00:04:24.120> two<00:04:24.330> years<00:04:24.479> from<00:04:24.659> now

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
year from now maybe two years from now

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.600 
year from now maybe two years from now
when<00:04:24.960> the<00:04:25.050> economy<00:04:25.500> is<00:04:25.620> back<00:04:26.159> on<00:04:26.370> its<00:04:26.550> feet

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:26.610 
when the economy is back on its feet

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:27.830 
when the economy is back on its feet
that<00:04:26.909> you<00:04:27.030> can<00:04:27.150> start<00:04:27.360> thinking<00:04:27.419> about<00:04:27.570> today

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
that you can start thinking about today

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:29.060 
that you can start thinking about today
where<00:04:27.990> something's<00:04:28.289> not<00:04:28.409> gonna<00:04:28.590> be<00:04:28.740> back<00:04:28.919> on
