player<00:01:19.170> pretty<00:01:19.530> much<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.180> it's<00:01:21.180> it's<00:01:21.509> been

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
player pretty much and it's it's been

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.390

pretty<00:01:21.930> awesome<00:01:22.020> watching<00:01:22.500> his<00:01:22.799> progression

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
pretty awesome watching his progression

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.359 
pretty awesome watching his progression
and<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.600> think<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.229> has<00:01:25.350> a<00:01:25.409> lot<00:01:25.560> to<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:25.979> with<00:01:26.009> you

and I think it has a lot to do with you

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.420 
and I think it has a lot to do with you
know<00:01:26.490> with<00:01:26.700> him<00:01:27.090> watching<00:01:27.270> or<00:01:28.100> just<00:01:29.100> trying<00:01:29.340> to

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
know with him watching or just trying to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:32.120 
know with him watching or just trying to
keep<00:01:29.579> up<00:01:29.759> with<00:01:29.820> me<00:01:30.150> in<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.390> game<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.810> and<00:01:31.680> it

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
keep up with me in the game and and it

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.609 
keep up with me in the game and and it
seems<00:01:32.490> like<00:01:32.700> he<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.509> know<00:01:33.630> he<00:01:33.810> cues<00:01:34.170> learning

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
seems like he you know he cues learning

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.740 
seems like he you know he cues learning
a<00:01:34.740> lot<00:01:34.860> for<00:01:35.100> me<00:01:35.189> I<00:01:35.220> was<00:01:35.729> tough<00:01:35.939> I<00:01:36.090> gave<00:01:36.509> him<00:01:36.630> a

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
a lot for me I was tough I gave him a

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.020 
a lot for me I was tough I gave him a
few<00:01:36.780> pointers<00:01:36.990> but<00:01:37.530> this<00:01:38.369> game<00:01:38.579> isn't<00:01:38.790> too

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
few pointers but this game isn't too

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.600 
few pointers but this game isn't too
hard<00:01:39.240> to<00:01:39.390> figure<00:01:39.509> out<00:01:39.659> so<00:01:40.170> it<00:01:41.009> just<00:01:41.070> takes<00:01:41.460> a

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
hard to figure out so it just takes a

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.910 
hard to figure out so it just takes a
little<00:01:41.759> bit<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.000> you<00:01:42.540> know<00:01:42.630> in<00:01:42.810> a<00:01:43.409> little<00:01:43.680> bit

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
little bit of you know in a little bit

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.609 
little bit of you know in a little bit
of<00:01:44.040> intuitive<00:01:44.670> thought<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.750> then<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.290> pretty

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
of intuitive thought and then you pretty

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.440 
of intuitive thought and then you pretty
much<00:01:46.770> can<00:01:47.070> figure<00:01:47.310> out<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.909> know<00:01:47.939> how<00:01:48.030> to<00:01:48.210> play

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
much can figure out you know how to play

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.480 
much can figure out you know how to play
this<00:01:48.600> game<00:01:48.810> and<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.680> takes<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.040> little<00:01:50.220> bit<00:01:50.430> of

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
this game and it takes a little bit of

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.700 
this game and it takes a little bit of
hand-eye<00:01:51.030> coordination<00:01:51.479> skill<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.200> then<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
hand-eye coordination skill and then you

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.990 
hand-eye coordination skill and then you
kind<00:01:52.950> of<00:01:53.009> can<00:01:53.159> figure<00:01:53.369> it<00:01:53.490> out<00:01:53.579> mean<00:01:53.790> look<00:01:53.939> at

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
kind of can figure it out mean look at

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.910 
kind of can figure it out mean look at
this<00:01:54.149> hand<00:01:54.420> eye<00:01:54.509> coordination<00:01:54.689> skill<00:01:55.290> that's

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
this hand eye coordination skill that's

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.160 
this hand eye coordination skill that's
not<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.189> land<00:01:56.490> I<00:01:56.909> coordinators<00:01:57.479> go<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.869> I<00:01:57.960> still

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
not a land I coordinators go but I still

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
not a land I coordinators go but I still
