00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
formation we are running but simply

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.769

because<00:00:23.460> for<00:00:23.850> one<00:00:23.970> two<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.240> two<00:00:24.359> is<00:00:24.390> super

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
because for one two and two is super

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.750 
because for one two and two is super
super<00:00:24.960> expensive<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.949> at<00:00:26.189> this<00:00:26.310> time<00:00:26.369> I'm<00:00:26.730> on

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
super expensive and at this time I'm on

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.849 
super expensive and at this time I'm on
such<00:00:27.240> a<00:00:27.449> tight<00:00:27.750> budget<00:00:28.109> I<00:00:28.470> can't<00:00:28.710> actually

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
such a tight budget I can't actually

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.099

afford<00:00:29.099> him<00:00:29.400> in<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.699> Craig<00:00:29.939> formation<00:00:30.449> so<00:00:30.630> at

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
afford him in the Craig formation so at

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:32.630 
afford him in the Craig formation so at
the<00:00:31.230> minute<00:00:31.439> I<00:00:31.529> think<00:00:31.590> he's<00:00:31.949> on<00:00:32.099> a<00:00:32.130> seven

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640

gone into our first game so we only do

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.360

waste<00:01:19.650> a<00:01:19.890> lot<00:01:20.189> of<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.369> contract<00:01:20.790> on<00:01:20.909> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
waste a lot of the contract on the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.160 
waste a lot of the contract on the
players<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:21.420> does<00:01:21.540> mean<00:01:21.720> that<00:01:21.750> have<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.080> go

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
players and does mean that have to go

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:23.690 
players and does mean that have to go
and<00:01:22.320> pick<00:01:22.439> up<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.650> lot<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.250> as<00:01:23.310> you<00:01:23.400> can<00:01:23.490> see

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
and pick up a lot more so as you can see

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.850 
and pick up a lot more so as you can see
here<00:01:23.850> that<00:01:23.880> I<00:01:24.150> do<00:01:24.450> spend<00:01:24.869> seven<00:01:25.290> hundred<00:01:25.710> coins

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
here that I do spend seven hundred coins

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.679 
here that I do spend seven hundred coins
and<00:01:26.159> two<00:01:26.430> contracts<00:01:26.939> which<00:01:27.060> isn't<00:01:27.299> ideal<00:01:27.360> but

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
and two contracts which isn't ideal but

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.030 
and two contracts which isn't ideal but
it's<00:01:28.200> something<00:01:28.409> you<00:01:28.500> have<00:01:28.650> to<00:01:28.680> do<00:01:28.860> an

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
it's something you have to do an

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
it's something you have to do an
ultimate<00:01:29.430> team<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.820> straight<00:01:30.479> after<00:01:30.750> that

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
ultimate team so straight after that

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.600 
ultimate team so straight after that
then<00:01:31.020> that<00:01:31.290> does<00:01:31.470> mean<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.710> we<00:01:31.920> are<00:01:31.950> only<00:01:32.070> one

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
then that does mean that we are only one

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.399 
then that does mean that we are only one
point<00:01:33.030> away<00:01:33.210> now<00:01:33.570> from<00:01:33.600> the<00:01:33.900> division<00:01:34.110> title

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
point away now from the division title

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.770 
point away now from the division title
we<00:01:34.710> do<00:01:34.829> head<00:01:35.040> into<00:01:35.280> our<00:01:35.430> second<00:01:35.850> game<00:01:36.030> I'm<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
was going off I did think that whoever

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.649 
was going off I did think that whoever
the<00:01:52.680> player<00:01:52.860> I<00:01:52.950> tackled<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.610> was<00:01:54.180> going<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.570> be

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the player I tackled was was going to be

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.910 
the player I tackled was was going to be
turning<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> other<00:01:55.170> way<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> would<00:01:55.770> be

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
turning the other way and I would be

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.770 
turning the other way and I would be
challenging<00:01:56.399> for<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.729> ball<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.060> for<00:01:57.240> me<00:01:57.329> he

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
challenging for the ball but for me he

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.209 
challenging for the ball but for me he
did<00:01:57.990> go<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.350> complete<00:01:58.680> other<00:01:58.710> way<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.100> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
did go the complete other way so that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:01.010 
did go the complete other way so that
does<00:01:59.490> mean<00:01:59.700> that<00:01:59.729> I<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.270> him<00:02:00.450> sent<00:02:00.689> down<00:02:00.869> and

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
does mean that I got him sent down and

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.539

we<00:03:53.819> didn't<00:03:54.060> need<00:03:54.180> a<00:03:54.329> right<00:03:54.599> back<00:03:54.870> to<00:03:55.049> complete

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
we didn't need a right back to complete

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:56.899 
we didn't need a right back to complete
the<00:03:55.500> squad<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.220> we<00:03:56.310> did<00:03:56.459> go<00:03:56.579> out<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:56.790> buy

00:03:56.899 --> 00:03:56.909 
the squad and we did go out and buy

00:03:56.909 --> 00:03:58.970 
the squad and we did go out and buy
Rafina<00:03:57.329> in<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.780> right<00:03:58.049> formation<00:03:58.409> again<00:03:58.650> so

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
Rafina in the right formation again so

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.409 
Rafina in the right formation again so
he'll<00:03:59.129> be<00:03:59.159> getting<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.609> nine<00:03:59.760> chemistry<00:04:00.269> and

00:04:00.409 --> 00:04:00.419 
he'll be getting the nine chemistry and

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:03.020 
he'll be getting the nine chemistry and
he<00:04:00.959> did<00:04:01.230> cost<00:04:01.470> 800<00:04:02.220> coins<00:04:02.430> and<00:04:02.669> that<00:04:02.760> is<00:04:02.879> the

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
he did cost 800 coins and that is the

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.030 
he did cost 800 coins and that is the
squad<00:04:03.299> complete<00:04:03.690> chemistry<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.620> bit<00:04:04.829> whiffy

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
squad complete chemistry is a bit whiffy

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.949 
squad complete chemistry is a bit whiffy
we<00:04:05.459> are<00:04:05.579> going<00:04:05.790> to<00:04:05.909> be<00:04:06.000> upgrading<00:04:06.419> that<00:04:06.569> now<00:04:06.720> as

00:04:06.949 --> 00:04:06.959 
we are going to be upgrading that now as

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:08.300 
we are going to be upgrading that now as
you<00:04:07.079> can<00:04:07.169> see<00:04:07.230> we<00:04:07.590> did<00:04:07.769> win<00:04:07.980> the<00:04:08.159> division

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
you can see we did win the division

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.399 
you can see we did win the division
title<00:04:08.730> which<00:04:09.449> didn't<00:04:09.690> mean<00:04:09.780> we<00:04:09.959> did<00:04:10.109> get<00:04:10.260> a

00:04:10.399 --> 00:04:10.409 
title which didn't mean we did get a

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:12.110 
title which didn't mean we did get a
nice<00:04:10.680> generous<00:04:11.069> amount<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.639> coin<00:04:11.819> so<00:04:12.030> the

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
nice generous amount of coin so the

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.689 
nice generous amount of coin so the
first<00:04:12.359> upgrade<00:04:12.599> we<00:04:13.019> did<00:04:13.169> God<00:04:13.349> make<00:04:13.379> was<00:04:14.159> s<00:04:14.459> vine

00:04:14.689 --> 00:04:14.699 
first upgrade we did God make was s vine

00:04:14.699 --> 00:04:17.060 
first upgrade we did God make was s vine
we<00:04:14.879> did<00:04:15.030> upgrade<00:04:15.180> him<00:04:15.569> up<00:04:15.690> from<00:04:15.959> the<00:04:16.169> I<00:04:16.560> think

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
we did upgrade him up from the I think

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:18.949 
we did upgrade him up from the I think
he<00:04:17.220> was<00:04:17.340> on<00:04:17.489> seven<00:04:17.880> chemistry<00:04:18.329> but<00:04:18.479> now<00:04:18.630> we<00:04:18.690> do

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
he was on seven chemistry but now we do

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.719 
he was on seven chemistry but now we do
have<00:04:18.989> him<00:04:19.229> in<00:04:19.320> the<00:04:19.409> fall<00:04:19.590> into<00:04:19.829> 12<00:04:19.979> we<00:04:20.579> are

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
have him in the fall into 12 we are

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:22.310 
have him in the fall into 12 we are
bumping<00:04:21.000> him<00:04:21.180> up<00:04:21.269> to<00:04:21.359> that<00:04:21.419> nine<00:04:21.690> chemistry<00:04:22.200> we

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
bumping him up to that nine chemistry we

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.050 
bumping him up to that nine chemistry we
do<00:04:22.440> go<00:04:22.590> and<00:04:22.770> so<00:04:23.099> his<00:04:23.370> previous<00:04:23.909> version<00:04:24.389> 4<00:04:24.950> 1100

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.060 
do go and so his previous version 4 1100

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:27.460 
do go and so his previous version 4 1100
coins<00:04:26.270> which<00:04:26.419> is<00:04:26.570> super<00:04:26.750> super<00:04:26.960> awesome<00:04:27.410> and

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:27.470 
coins which is super super awesome and

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.250 
coins which is super super awesome and
from<00:04:27.680> there<00:04:27.860> we<00:04:28.220> did<00:04:28.400> go<00:04:28.580> an<00:04:28.700> upgrade<00:04:29.030> chief<00:04:29.419> he

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:30.260 
from there we did go an upgrade chief he

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.200 
from there we did go an upgrade chief he
again<00:04:30.530> was<00:04:30.740> on<00:04:30.919> 8<00:04:31.160> chemistry<00:04:31.669> i<00:04:31.700> believe<00:04:31.940> i<00:04:32.060> did

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
again was on 8 chemistry i believe i did

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:33.610 
again was on 8 chemistry i believe i did
want<00:04:32.389> him<00:04:32.510> to<00:04:32.600> be<00:04:32.690> on<00:04:32.780> the<00:04:32.870> nine<00:04:33.050> chemistry<00:04:33.500> so

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
want him to be on the nine chemistry so

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.120 
want him to be on the nine chemistry so
you<00:04:33.680> did<00:04:33.830> go<00:04:33.980> and<00:04:34.220> upgrade<00:04:34.940> him<00:04:35.180> we<00:04:35.330> did<00:04:35.480> spend

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
you did go and upgrade him we did spend

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.280 
you did go and upgrade him we did spend
1100<00:04:37.130> coins<00:04:37.340> on<00:04:37.639> the<00:04:37.850> nine<00:04:38.120> chemistry<00:04:38.990> version

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:39.290 
1100 coins on the nine chemistry version

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:40.690 
1100 coins on the nine chemistry version
of<00:04:39.380> him<00:04:39.500> in<00:04:39.620> the<00:04:39.680> fall<00:04:39.860> into<00:04:40.100> into<00:04:40.310> formation

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:40.700 
of him in the fall into into formation

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.879 
of him in the fall into into formation
and<00:04:41.210> we<00:04:41.360> do<00:04:41.510> go<00:04:41.690> and<00:04:41.870> sell<00:04:42.110> his<00:04:42.320> previous

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:42.889 
and we do go and sell his previous

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:47.230 
and we do go and sell his previous
version<00:04:43.550> 4<00:04:44.380> 1200<00:04:45.380> coins<00:04:45.620> so<00:04:45.860> that<00:04:46.460> is<00:04:46.700> a<00:04:46.730> lot<00:04:47.180> of

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:47.240 
version 4 1200 coins so that is a lot of

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.090 
version 4 1200 coins so that is a lot of
chemistry<00:04:47.750> being<00:04:48.139> upgraded<00:04:48.290> with<00:04:48.740> bought<00:04:48.950> in

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:49.100

all<00:04:52.070> on<00:04:52.460> at<00:04:52.610> nine<00:04:52.820> chemistry<00:04:53.389> so<00:04:53.510> that<00:04:53.630> is

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
all on at nine chemistry so that is

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.540 
all on at nine chemistry so that is
bumped<00:04:53.990> it<00:04:54.080> up<00:04:54.139> a<00:04:54.260> lot<00:04:54.380> we<00:04:54.770> are<00:04:54.889> now<00:04:55.070> on<00:04:55.100> to<00:04:55.520> the

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
bumped it up a lot we are now on to the

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.240 
bumped it up a lot we are now on to the
93<00:04:56.270> rated<00:04:57.139> chemistry<00:04:57.590> we<00:04:57.680> do<00:04:57.800> have<00:04:57.950> to<00:04:58.070> upgrade

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
93 rated chemistry we do have to upgrade

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:00.250 
93 rated chemistry we do have to upgrade
the<00:04:58.850> two<00:04:59.030> centre-backs<00:04:59.419> but<00:04:59.840> they<00:05:00.020> are

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
the two centre-backs but they are

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.990 
the two centre-backs but they are
ridiculous<00:05:00.860> i<00:05:00.979> think<00:05:01.160> they<00:05:01.280> cost<00:05:01.490> around<00:05:01.639> four

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
ridiculous i think they cost around four

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:04.510 
ridiculous i think they cost around four
to<00:05:02.180> five<00:05:02.389> thousand<00:05:02.810> coins<00:05:02.930> each<00:05:03.200> in<00:05:03.919> the<00:05:04.310> form
