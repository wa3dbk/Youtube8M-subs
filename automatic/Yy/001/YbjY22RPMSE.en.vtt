00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
are going to be like one you ward you'd

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.240

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250 
be like I did Ward and then you'll think

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.680 
be like I did Ward and then you'll think
that<00:00:38.430> warding<00:00:38.760> doesn't<00:00:39.090> help<00:00:39.239> when<00:00:39.300> it<00:00:39.510> really

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
that warding doesn't help when it really

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.100 
that warding doesn't help when it really
does<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:41.129> ward<00:00:41.370> here<00:00:42.149> a<00:00:42.540> little<00:00:42.719> bit<00:00:42.899> deeper

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
does you ward here a little bit deeper

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.799 
does you ward here a little bit deeper
gets<00:00:43.500> more<00:00:43.710> time<00:00:43.860> to<00:00:43.980> react<00:00:44.250> and<00:00:44.460> here<00:00:45.450> so<00:00:45.690> if

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
gets more time to react and here so if

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:46.970 
gets more time to react and here so if
they<00:00:45.930> come<00:00:46.079> through<00:00:46.110> the<00:00:46.320> jungle<00:00:46.649> you<00:00:46.739> can<00:00:46.860> see

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
they come through the jungle you can see

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.340 
they come through the jungle you can see
them<00:00:47.100> coming<00:00:47.280> like<00:00:47.719> you<00:00:48.719> have<00:00:48.809> no<00:00:49.110> time<00:00:49.289> to

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
them coming like you have no time to

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.040 
them coming like you have no time to
react<00:00:49.680> like<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.280> hecarim<00:00:50.670> or<00:00:50.789> dr.<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.899> get

react like the hecarim or dr. your get

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.619 
react like the hecarim or dr. your get
you're<00:00:52.289> gonna<00:00:52.350> die<00:00:52.590> you're<00:00:52.829> just<00:00:53.100> gonna<00:00:53.219> die

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.639 
you're gonna die you're just gonna die
and<00:00:54.629> then<00:00:54.750> you'll<00:00:54.899> believe<00:00:55.079> that<00:00:55.320> wording

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
and then you'll believe that wording

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.319 
and then you'll believe that wording
doesn't<00:00:55.980> help<00:00:56.129> and<00:00:56.309> that's<00:00:56.640> never<00:00:56.969> good

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
doesn't help and that's never good

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.150 
doesn't help and that's never good
