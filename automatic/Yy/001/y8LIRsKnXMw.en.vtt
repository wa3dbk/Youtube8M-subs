00:00:01.589 --> 00:00:04.589
 Hagen 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.600
 8th 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:15.309
 In this segment we have these apps Kfz-bracket 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.369
 in an older program because he has me ever imagined 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.609
 The addressee is the car that was presented as was then 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.089
 the iPad 1 only but there are now naked ICEs 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:31.359
 for the iPad 2 and these brackets can be used for both 

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.860
 and that were watching us 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130
 the snack car holder 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:38.840
 becomes the topic of cancer 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:43.950
 is made of synthetic leather in the upper area you have such a holder where 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.810
 the lid accordingly 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:50.140
 Schmidt is pushed through to the brackets down and 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.140
 sets the owner in the right place 

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.480
 running with appropriate gomes the whole thing over the headrest cloudy 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.910
 slipped over and then with appropriate straps 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.910
 secured under the headrest 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.380
 so you take the magnet system lid folds you push back the romp 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.200
 unsure that below 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.010
 In this little Clemens, the whole thing is really safe on the headrest 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.630
 now in this snack case, the car holder came then again 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.510
 Conclusion was 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:38.369
 slowly 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.120
 Percent to further says dealer shelves 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.120
 and what does that have to say why do you say so 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:46.909
 more Hello 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.919
 we will miss Marcel five Mark attitude trusted 50 was allowed 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.499
 we can see if the place in the car 

00:01:53.499 --> 00:01:57.560
 It's very hot, I do not know if I'm really broken and continued 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.890
 we noticed some things 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:03.200
 and partly 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.310
 Henkel continues to lead her unchanged, hips are haunted 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.349
 Assists by whatever means not so stable 

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:12.379
 and we do not really like that anymore now the way leads in 

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:13.879
 Towards Erfurt 

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.729
 and how fast and how cool behind in the holder 

00:02:16.729 --> 00:02:19.929
 which bothers about the passenger about the driver by itself 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.609
 I think that's not very nice 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:24.730
 that's very 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.760
 These are things like when he is also over bumpy in the case of victims 

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:28.709
 streets 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
 Wacker village churches pretty leadership 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.269
 so real cleansing is possible "Maybe I'll say calmly 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.659
 put 

00:02:36.659 --> 00:02:39.659
 then you could movie Coco Ursula Straka cool thing though 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:43.529
 but none of the things you could possibly change was clear 

00:02:43.529 --> 00:02:45.239
 could make previous tour 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:48.719
 because, for example, it can make a coating so completely withdraw 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:51.569
 that may be over 

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:53.699
 solved more intelligently 

00:02:53.699 --> 00:02:55.200
 Dice very fine thing 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.789
 and not around 

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:58.449
 pebe steering 11 

00:02:58.449 --> 00:02:59.619
 today 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.329
 4 out of 5 points 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:03.779
 So it's a gentle not cool thing 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:07.599
 Hold a score to get five points if he still has one 

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:10.509
 little thing would be changed Rheine bracket 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.629
 Unzen greetings device thank you for it and to the debt relief show 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.439
 We thank Florian for your trip 17 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.049
 What do you think of it would be that he also tested in our car 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:29.549
 yes, I think they had a very good that is about 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:34.010
 so flexible march to flexible same must demands a bit tuesday 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:37.269
 11 in the back is decided 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.469
 That did not affect us too 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.249
 Now we do not actually take this for granted 

00:03:44.249 --> 00:03:47.129
 I'll tell you that we'll settle on it 

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:49.229
 from the processing ago 

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:52.039
 we are like that 

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:54.729
 Anderson serves a very simple design 

00:03:54.729 --> 00:03:57.789
 but he performs his functions as he does that is over 

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:01.939
 changing the crisis - proof attitude must not be afraid to say that im 

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:03.699
 fails 

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:06.509
 He also said that 

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:10.749
 that's a little bit ugly, as well as the vessels against the 

00:04:10.749 --> 00:04:12.109
 the headrest 

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.619
 then head around in a headrest then one always sneaks to these 

00:04:15.619 --> 00:04:18.870
 annoying he would actually have an additional protection on top of disturbed 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.400
 So that you can do it again with a uniform deal 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:26.370
 but i think master be running simple system as the first one 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.150
 easy it is just for easy cheap 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:30.750
 all the more and 7 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:33.750
 for it his function closely I also yes 

00:04:34.309 --> 00:04:38.209
 so much for snack bass car the car mount 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:44.870
 often 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.860
 on 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.870
 hor
