00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.399
 hello welcome to my channel the day of 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.680
 Today I have prepared a video for you 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.049
 makeup technique that I was not 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.169
 very convinced so I gave it as a 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:16.510
 twist as well as more suited to my 

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:18.730
 style and what I like and 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.529
 You have probably read or seen videos 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.250
 about the technique of scouting 

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.929
 they agree in the 90s at the end of the 90s 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.609
 Well, the best there are still people who 

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:29.470
 he has it but back then they used 

00:00:27.609 --> 00:00:31.539
 much that when he gave enrole the 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:34.420
 squares the cars create slaves 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:35.980
 they agree to be like ironing good 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:38.470
 for the same new technique that is called 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:42.370
 straubing in the makeup was going to be 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:45.940
 marriage and is a technique streaming 

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:48.780
 consists of a let's say an attempt to 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.130
 Face profiling using only 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.930
 illuminator and so on good terms 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:54.820
 simple means that these 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.530
 profiling and lighting techniques 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.630
 you remove the profiling and do what you 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.490
 can with the village mine d'or well of 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:02.740
 easy but the truth is that I for more 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:05.199
 I tried it and so it did not seem like 

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:07.390
 for me it was very functional because 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.320
 I am very white maybe if the 

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.020
 more girls die 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.790
 they are more appealing they light up a lot the 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.729
 part of the cheekbones the bridge of the 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:19.360
 nose because that's going to play fine father with 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.860
 with his pronounced brown skin tone 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:22.240
 but in my case I 'm super white 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:23.800
 for me since it has been enlightening me 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.260
 it has been as it is I am very pale I 

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:28.240
 I need something that gives me shade for that 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.640
 as much as the twists and turns still in 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.920
 this being to me honestly did not make me 

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.780
 so I bring you my version of the 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.670
 streaming that for me is much more 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.710
 functional one more for very skin 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.570
 white but for all but I want 

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.950
 share with you something that was 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.140
 doing lately and that I liked 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.119
 a lot and that they have played me a lot and 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.160
 let's say that as the first hand of scoring 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.080
 nothing more than instead of profiling to 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.759
 mark a bronzer on all 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.289
 face but I want to talk about the 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.450
 what to mention step by step how to achieve 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.100
 between the profit that is two super globe 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.750
 to house it good I think that the 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.630
 most of you already know that there is a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.240
 abysmal difference between illuminate and 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.190
 greasy see if you have oily skin 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.440
 like me this guy is going to serve a lot 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.509
 I want my skin to look super globe 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.209
 super radiant but I do not think it's 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.350
 Greasy shiny sweat or anything by the 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.810
 style then 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.640
 I'm going to use a base that lives like it a lot 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.370
 this base of claver grow that is three in 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.350
 one has the first corrector and is the basis of 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.690
 make up how I want to use right 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:27.160
 additional but did not use a first before 

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.260
 this base because I feel that it has 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.890
 super good fixation and has a finish 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.870
 almost mate not as much as the infallible 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.820
 but if you leave a matte finish for 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.800
 much more time and that I'm going to combine 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:41.530
 with a liquid illuminator that I have for 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.500
 here this I got it mtv is from the brand 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.880
 mini but if you do not get this one to me 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.010
 is the one I like the most right now 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.140
 Liquids is also a very good option 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.690
 this other one of the mix that is the liquid team 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.570
 dominator there is in this environment and one 

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.700
 which is a little bit like more champagne for 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:59.740
 there, as I mentioned, I'm going to combine 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.900
 these two and I'm going to put them in the 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:03.940
 behind my hand and with the help of my 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.680
 eliminating I'm going to apply for all the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.300
 face I'm going to combine moments that 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:09.850
 I'm taking them with life and selling 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:12.870
 here let's say that they are already combined and 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:12.870
 I'm going to start applying 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.600
 since I applied the makeup I'm going to 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.060
 continue with the proofreader and I'll 

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:30.030
 apply in the way that I always 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.310
 I make it like the triangle 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.940
 a little nothing in the bottom of the 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.940
 bridge of the nose 

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:49.020
 To fix makeup you can use a 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.940
 Fixer with which you feel comfortable 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:53.280
 I want to keep that aspect 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.080
 super hydrated and super lit I'll 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.940
 fix it with the thermal water of the tree 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.440
 wife and other brands this is 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.630
 just the one that we saw I like but 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.700
 there are many brands of thermal water and in 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.080
 several sizes and it's very economical and it's 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.570
 a very good alternative for 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.740
 cool you up today I just heard 

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:10.080
 someone say that I kept it in the 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:11.490
 refrigerator and then I applied it with 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.050
 I got super hot here in 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.090
 Monterrey is very hot but I know that 

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:16.920
 I joined almost to say in Merida hello of 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:18.390
 also of heat also so is it 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.220
 very good option and with this I am going to 

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:22.580
 seal before applying the products in 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.580
 powder 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.570
 and since he 's the super son okay I'm going to 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:28.610
 Apply a little bit of sunscreen but do not 

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:30.200
 the typical matt sunscreen we use 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:32.420
 to profile and give depth and 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.730
 dimension to the face but a bronzer 

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:36.860
 with brightness and I have the options that I 

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.060
 they like it a lot and it depends on the taste of 

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:40.340
 everyone 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:44.240
 one of them is this that I have here 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.860
 this m that is in a brown tone is medium 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.690
 cold at first sight we think but 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.970
 when I showed you this viso will be given 

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:52.160
 account that this one has digital mandala and 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:55.070
 red and this one 

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:57.050
 and video is that its approval comes 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.490
 tone of this all left on screen 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:00.590
 both mary kate and beat 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.420
 today I'm going to use mary kate and the 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:05.360
 brochita that I will use for 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.130
 apply this kabuki is that it is for 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:08.960
 be outlined but I feel that it is 

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:12.110
 as very large to be outlined 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:14.240
 but it's super soft and while the 

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:17.450
 profiler we do not put the bass the 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.160
 cheekbones at the hairline a 

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:20.990
 little the sides of the nose this 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.370
 type of shiny bronzer with many 

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:24.260
 globules let's apply a very 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.300
 different I will put the parts 

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:28.280
 highs of the face and where normally the 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.950
 sun would give me that would be the bridge of the 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:32.030
 nose on the other hand 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:33.860
 profiler that I am on the east sides 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.390
 I'll put on the bridge over the 

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.050
 cheeks and a little bit also about the 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:38.050
 front and chin 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:48.660
 finally an illuminator that leaves me like that 

00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.600
 but super super super pretty illuminated 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.220
 with healthy aspect, I love 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.930
 but I no longer know where you can 

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:56.610
 get in Mexico I got it very 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.169
 easily in any additive and I think 

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:59.610
 they no longer sell us itv 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:02.280
 but any enlightener is going to 

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:03.540
 serve well ladies that good job this 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:06.360
 I'm going to put the cheekbones where 

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:08.910
 I would normally put the illuminator as 

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.650
 already illuminate with the shiny bronzer the 

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:12.660
 bridge of the nose nothing else puts it a 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.180
 little bit on the tip 

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:20.120
 and a little more of this same arribita 

00:06:15.180 --> 00:06:20.120
 in the eyebrows it looks super nice 

00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:27.370
 I do not like to carry much illuminator 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:29.170
 the central part of the forehead because if 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:31.900
 you stop expression as is my case 

00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:34.330
 they are accentuated even more or villages 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.280
 dilated both in the forehead as well as 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.560
 the sides of the nose are still dilated 

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:40.390
 more or more are accentuated and are more 

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:42.310
 notorious what they dilate more but that 

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.650
 it shows more by the brightness or are more 

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:45.910
 striking the final touch but that follows 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:48.100
 having very illuminated but also 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:49.780
 bronzer is a lipstick that makes you 

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:51.820
 see more tan than you are 

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.770
 they always exist or for all there is a type 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.690
 lipstick that whenever you put it on 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:57.220
 you look like more cheerful more tan 

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:59.710
 although not necessarily 

00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:02.440
 substantiated to me these days has been 

00:06:59.710 --> 00:07:05.940
 This one from the USA is mate 

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:05.940
 holder in the coral tone 

00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.180
 there is always a lipstick that we all 

00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:15.639
 it makes me look like I said more tan 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:17.800
 look for yours another good option apart 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:20.949
 of this one from f1 that has lately given me 

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.720
 liked a lot is this one of them and clear them 

00:07:20.949 --> 00:07:24.729
 I will teach the two in swaps this 

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:27.220
 creamy here is today's and this one that 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:28.810
 it looks more liquid is his and crowe me 

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:30.009
 I used theirs because I feel that for 

00:07:28.810 --> 00:07:31.930
 the day is a little less 

00:07:30.009 --> 00:07:34.090
 scandalous that the other but any 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:35.789
 of the two and you're white in mid-tone 

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.199
 even the modern ones must go super well 

00:07:35.789 --> 00:07:39.880
