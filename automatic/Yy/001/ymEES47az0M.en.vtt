 mommies we channel we knit just this 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.360
 on a barrel of roses 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:17.850
 This is the second part of the video knitting lesson 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:22.260

 lessons on the screen by clicking on any 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.640
 the picture will go to the corresponding 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:30.269
 video lesson we tied up 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 right depth and cap and now we will 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:35.149
 to knit 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.739
 fields for panama dial one air 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:43.649
 lifting which replaces the first bar 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:46.110
 without sc and then we were binding under 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:51.660
 single crotch over 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:53.149
 a column above the checkbox under 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.030
 airborne 

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:59.480
 above the column that is, it turns out in each 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.539
 loop in this series we knit 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:06.080
 single crochet we knit it 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:09.090
 preparatory series 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:14.640
 after it will start the resolution for us 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:16.530
 glasses attach syakko 1 air 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.250
 lift with connecting stub in 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:24.119
 end of row 1 air and on again 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:29.009
 over each column we knit a column without 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:32.939
 nakida we knit 4 columns without 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:38.780
 knit in the fifth loop we knit 2 columns 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:38.780
 without nakida we do an increase that is 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.450
 4 single crochets one by one 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:49.990
 fifth loop 2 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:55.000
 and so the whole row 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:59.280
 every fifth loop increase at the end 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000
 rows are attached 1 air lift 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.700
 here we are in principle 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.260
 tied up all the gains that expand 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.240
 further knit the fields themselves 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:13.230
 three aerial lifts replace first 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:13.230
 double crochet 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:20.880
 then knit in each loop one by one 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.880
 double crochet 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:28.420
 now we will knit very beautiful on 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:33.280
 My view of the field I unfortunately do not know 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.410
 who first thought them up exactly 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:38.830
 beautiful fields, I changed a little 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.170
 knitting here adding this row from 

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:44.590
 double crochet because I 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:49.450
 it seems that for beginners to bind him 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:51.100
 need to be easier to knit on three 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.450
 aerial lift and scored 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:59.080
 and knit alternating convex column with 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:01.150
 nakidom and double crochet that is 

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.980
 bulging it we catch 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:07.260
 the very stem of the previous row and 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:09.760
 knit a crochet 

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.720
 regular double crochet knit in 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.000
 next loop we catch a column 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:19.470
 knit 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.470
 further just above the post 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:30.740
 Convex bar with a sc 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:36.590
 double crochet ideally of course 

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:43.560
 there must be an even number of bars 

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:46.760
 so that we have a beautifully laid pattern beautifully 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.760
 end of it is over 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.300
 Further the next row, we again scored 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:56.390
 three air just knit over convex 

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:57.560
 column convex double crochet over 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:08.300
 normal column 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:13.790
 double crochet 

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:17.959
 knitted for example 2 rows of columns without 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:24.830
 nakida row of crochets and 3 already 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:35.260
 a series of relief and we have the field like this 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:37.910
 lie down and bend two three 4 5 5 or 6 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:41.450
 such rows can be knit 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:44.570
 and so far not very much case 100 

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:48.980
