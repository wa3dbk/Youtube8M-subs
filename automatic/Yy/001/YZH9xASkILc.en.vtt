00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
you're gonna be expecting like five

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.510 
you're gonna be expecting like five
hours<00:01:50.759> of<00:01:51.299> reading<00:01:51.509> every<00:01:51.990> day<00:01:52.140> and<00:01:52.350> etc<00:01:52.590> so

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
hours of reading every day and etc so

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.460 
hours of reading every day and etc so
what<00:01:53.759> this<00:01:53.880> has<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.270> has<00:01:54.420> 12<00:01:54.750> boss<00:01:54.960> encounters

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
what this has it has 12 boss encounters

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.039 
what this has it has 12 boss encounters
and<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.070> 13<00:01:56.490> foes<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:57.060> heroic<00:01:57.450> only<00:01:57.810> so<00:01:57.960> I'm

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
and the 13 foes on heroic only so I'm

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.840 
and the 13 foes on heroic only so I'm
guessing<00:01:58.200> it's<00:01:58.409> like<00:01:58.530> a<00:01:58.560> Sinestro<00:01:59.159> back<00:01:59.700> in

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
have four different wings so you don't

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.039 
have four different wings so you don't
gotta<00:02:05.670> do<00:02:05.790> it<00:02:05.850> all<00:02:05.939> at<00:02:06.030> once<00:02:06.240> which<00:02:06.479> is<00:02:06.630> pretty

good and on the PTO it's gonna have
limited<00:02:09.270> testing<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:09.929> they'll<00:02:10.080> eventually

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
limited testing so they'll eventually

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.860 
limited testing so they'll eventually

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:52.500 
get loot if they attack the boss so I

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.720 
get loot if they attack the boss so I
means<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.799> can<00:02:52.920> have<00:02:53.040> like<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.190> hundred<00:02:53.400> man

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
means you can have like a hundred man

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.550 
means you can have like a hundred man
raid<00:02:54.000> attack<00:02:54.329> of<00:02:54.450> the<00:02:54.510> boss<00:02:54.660> which<00:02:55.290> would<00:02:55.440> make

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:55.560 
raid attack of the boss which would make

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.809 
raid attack of the boss which would make
it<00:02:55.739> even<00:02:55.829> easier<00:02:56.040> than<00:02:56.250> already<00:02:56.549> is<00:02:56.790> but

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:56.819 
it even easier than already is but

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:59.690 
it even easier than already is but
that's<00:02:57.450> what<00:02:57.720> seems<00:02:57.900> like<00:02:58.019> it's<00:02:58.170> like<00:02:58.700> for

00:02:59.690 --> 00:02:59.700
