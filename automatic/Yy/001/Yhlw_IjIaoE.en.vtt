00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
does work on 3.1.3 as well but again I'm

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.350 
does work on 3.1.3 as well but again I'm
just<00:01:58.200> going<00:01:58.409> to<00:01:58.530> do<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.890> with<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.460> iPad<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.240> I'm

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
just going to do it with the iPad so I'm

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.120 
just going to do it with the iPad so I'm
just<00:02:00.509> going<00:02:00.630> to<00:02:00.719> click<00:02:00.930> on<00:02:01.110> iPad<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> then

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
just going to click on iPad and then

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.709 
just going to click on iPad and then
you're<00:02:02.250> going<00:02:02.430> to<00:02:02.549> have<00:02:02.729> to<00:02:02.880> enter<00:02:03.180> DFU<00:02:03.689> mode

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you're going to have to enter DFU mode

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.929 
you're going to have to enter DFU mode
now<00:02:04.170> it<00:02:04.320> does<00:02:04.560> give<00:02:04.829> you<00:02:04.950> guys<00:02:05.130> instructions

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
now it does give you guys instructions

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.150 
now it does give you guys instructions
on<00:02:06.149> the<00:02:06.329> screen<00:02:06.509> how<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:06.960> do<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> I'm<00:02:08.129> just

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
on the screen how to do it and I'm just

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.710 
on the screen how to do it and I'm just
following<00:02:08.940> along<00:02:09.179> the<00:02:09.390> instructions<00:02:10.170> so<00:02:10.530> I'm

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
following along the instructions so I'm

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.270 
following along the instructions so I'm
doing<00:02:11.990> exactly<00:02:12.110> what<00:02:12.800> it<00:02:12.890> says<00:02:13.100> on<00:02:13.250> the

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
doing exactly what it says on the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.060 
doing exactly what it says on the
instructions<00:02:14.060> and<00:02:14.270> then<00:02:14.990> basically<00:02:15.500> once<00:02:15.860> you

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:16.070 
instructions and then basically once you

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.060 
instructions and then basically once you
have<00:02:16.340> successfully<00:02:16.670> entered<00:02:17.540> DFU<00:02:18.110> mode<00:02:18.140> then

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
have successfully entered DFU mode then

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.460 
have successfully entered DFU mode then
it<00:02:19.400> will<00:02:19.790> detect<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.510> and<00:02:20.780> it<00:02:20.900> will<00:02:21.050> move<00:02:21.230> on

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
it will detect that and it will move on

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:22.810 
it will detect that and it will move on
and<00:02:21.710> as<00:02:22.010> you<00:02:22.070> can<00:02:22.250> see<00:02:22.310> it<00:02:22.520> says<00:02:22.640> it's

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:22.820 
and as you can see it says it's

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.210 
and as you can see it says it's
exploiting<00:02:23.360> with<00:02:23.480> lime<00:02:23.720> rain<00:02:24.020> not<00:02:24.830> much<00:02:25.040> is

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
exploiting with lime rain not much is

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:27.160 
exploiting with lime rain not much is
going<00:02:25.400> on<00:02:25.580> in<00:02:25.640> my<00:02:25.850> iPad<00:02:26.330> right<00:02:26.360> now<00:02:26.810> it's<00:02:27.080> just

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
going on in my iPad right now it's just

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.820 
going on in my iPad right now it's just
a<00:02:27.410> black<00:02:27.650> screen<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:28.340> decided<00:02:28.850> not<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.210> go<00:02:29.660> with

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
a black screen I decided not to go with

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.110 
a black screen I decided not to go with
video<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.100> to<00:02:31.250> not<00:02:31.370> show<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:31.700> guys<00:02:31.850> what<00:02:32.030> was

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
video and to not show you guys what was

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.600 
video and to not show you guys what was
going<00:02:32.390> on<00:02:32.510> with<00:02:32.660> my<00:02:32.810> iPad<00:02:33.230> because<00:02:33.830> I<00:02:34.040> figured

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610 
going on with my iPad because I figured

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:37.470 
going on with my iPad because I figured
it<00:02:35.030> was<00:02:35.150> just<00:02:35.210> too<00:02:35.630> much<00:02:35.780> work<00:02:36.080> to<00:02:36.320> do<00:02:36.530> and

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
it was just too much work to do and

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.850 
it was just too much work to do and
nothing<00:02:38.480> really<00:02:38.690> happens<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.350> mean<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:39.590> screen

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:39.860 
nothing really happens I mean the screen

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.670 
nothing really happens I mean the screen
just<00:02:40.040> stays<00:02:40.250> black<00:02:40.550> the<00:02:40.790> entire<00:02:41.180> time<00:02:41.630> I<00:02:41.960> it

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:42.680 
just stays black the entire time I it

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.100 
just stays black the entire time I it
actually<00:02:43.160> quit<00:02:43.460> out<00:02:43.610> there<00:02:43.940> because<00:02:44.209> Norton

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:45.110 
actually quit out there because Norton

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:47.890 
actually quit out there because Norton
detected<00:02:45.770> it<00:02:45.890> as<00:02:46.040> being<00:02:46.370> a<00:02:46.490> virus<00:02:47.000> even<00:02:47.720> though

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:47.900 
detected it as being a virus even though

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.590 
detected it as being a virus even though
it's<00:02:48.110> not<00:02:48.350> a<00:02:48.410> virus<00:02:49.040> so<00:02:49.430> I<00:02:49.700> guess<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.360> could

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:50.600 
it's not a virus so I guess that could

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.330 
it's not a virus so I guess that could
be<00:02:50.630> something<00:02:51.050> to<00:02:51.140> take<00:02:51.320> into<00:02:51.590> account<00:02:51.860> you

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
be something to take into account you

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:53.500 
be something to take into account you
might<00:02:52.459> want<00:02:52.670> to<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:52.850> to<00:02:52.970> turn<00:02:53.180> off<00:02:53.480> your

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
might want to have to turn off your

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.050 
might want to have to turn off your
Norton<00:02:54.230> if<00:02:54.560> you<00:02:54.709> have<00:02:54.920> Norton<00:02:55.280> or<00:02:55.400> any<00:02:55.850> other
