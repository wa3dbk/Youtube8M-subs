00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:00.640 
going to play the finals so i might not

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.190 
going to play the finals so i might not
win<00:01:00.879> but<00:01:00.910> then<00:01:01.239> again<00:01:01.390> I<00:01:01.510> might<00:01:01.750> wait<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:01.989> couple

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:02.200 
win but then again I might wait a couple

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:21.399 
win but then again I might wait a couple
of<00:01:02.350> my<00:01:02.590> intuition

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:25.520 

it<00:01:22.409> is<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.710> area<00:01:22.950> of<00:01:23.009> high<00:01:23.100> deprivation<00:01:24.530> over

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
it is an area of high deprivation over

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.069 
it is an area of high deprivation over
half<00:01:25.710> our<00:01:25.890> wards<00:01:26.280> are<00:01:26.430> within<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.090> lowest<00:01:27.960> ten

00:01:28.069 --> 00:01:28.079 
half our wards are within the lowest ten

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:29.749 
half our wards are within the lowest ten
percent<00:01:28.469> of<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.950> wards<00:01:29.159> in<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.310> country<00:01:29.670> in

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
percent of the wards in the country in

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.370 
percent of the wards in the country in
terms<00:01:29.939> of<00:01:30.060> multiple<00:01:30.390> deprivation<00:01:30.689> indices

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
terms of multiple deprivation indices

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.069 
terms of multiple deprivation indices
into<00:01:32.130> the<00:01:32.310> community<00:01:32.700> cohesion<00:01:33.090> different

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
into the community cohesion different

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:35.809 
into the community cohesion different
groups<00:01:34.259> of<00:01:34.350> people<00:01:34.409> who<00:01:34.710> come<00:01:34.860> down<00:01:35.069> here<00:01:35.340> had

00:01:35.809 --> 00:01:35.819 
groups of people who come down here had

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:37.370 
groups of people who come down here had
there<00:01:35.970> not<00:01:36.030> been<00:01:36.210> playing<00:01:36.720> table<00:01:36.960> tennis<00:01:37.110> at

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
there not been playing table tennis at

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:38.749 
there not been playing table tennis at
the<00:01:37.409> center<00:01:37.920> they<00:01:38.250> may<00:01:38.399> never<00:01:38.640> have

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the center they may never have

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.609 
the center they may never have
interacting<00:01:39.299> with<00:01:39.390> one<00:01:39.420> another<00:01:39.569> so<00:01:40.470> I<00:01:40.530> think

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
interacting with one another so I think

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.529 
interacting with one another so I think
that<00:01:40.770> kind<00:01:41.310> of<00:01:41.399> growth<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:41.939> partnerships

00:01:42.529 --> 00:01:42.539 
that kind of growth on the partnerships

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:44.600 
that kind of growth on the partnerships
that<00:01:42.659> they<00:01:42.810> have<00:01:43.039> enabling<00:01:44.039> more<00:01:44.159> people<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
that they have enabling more people to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.340 
that they have enabling more people to
play<00:01:44.850> all<00:01:45.119> those<00:01:45.360> benefits<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> we<00:01:46.110> talked

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
play all those benefits that we talked

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:48.080 
play all those benefits that we talked
about<00:01:46.380> being<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.860> crew<00:01:47.069> from<00:01:47.219> sport<00:01:47.640> you

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
about being a crew from sport you

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.160 
about being a crew from sport you
actually<00:01:48.390> see<00:01:48.479> happening<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.140> ground

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
actually see happening on the ground

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.649 
actually see happening on the ground
here<00:01:49.649> they've<00:01:50.310> done<00:01:50.490> wonders<00:01:50.849> with<00:01:51.060> the<00:01:51.270> venue

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
here they've done wonders with the venue

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.699 
here they've done wonders with the venue
and<00:01:51.869> with<00:01:51.990> what<00:01:52.110> they<00:01:52.200> mail<00:01:52.349> to<00:01:52.530> deliver

00:01:52.699 --> 00:01:52.709 
and with what they mail to deliver

00:01:52.709 --> 00:01:55.130 
and with what they mail to deliver
through<00:01:53.099> the<00:01:53.220> venue<00:01:53.580> so<00:01:54.209> I'd<00:01:54.330> say<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.929> fund

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
through the venue so I'd say the fund

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
through the venue so I'd say the fund
helps<00:01:55.439> clubs<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.950> grow<00:01:56.189> and<00:01:56.399> it<00:01:56.459> helps<00:01:56.849> them<00:01:56.939> to

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
helps clubs to grow and it helps them to

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:59.499 
helps clubs to grow and it helps them to
achieve<00:01:57.119> their<00:01:57.450> goals<00:01:57.659> they're<00:01:58.289> not<00:01:58.380> going<00:01:58.560> to

00:01:59.499 --> 00:01:59.509 
achieve their goals they're not going to

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:01.699 
achieve their goals they're not going to
achieve<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.840> perhaps<00:02:01.020> in<00:02:01.229> a<00:02:01.289> smaller<00:02:01.560> venue

00:02:01.699 --> 00:02:01.709 
achieve that perhaps in a smaller venue

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.979 
achieve that perhaps in a smaller venue
without<00:02:02.130> the<00:02:02.280> capital<00:02:03.209> impact<00:02:03.569> to<00:02:03.659> do<00:02:03.840> it

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:03.989 
without the capital impact to do it

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:05.779 
without the capital impact to do it
however<00:02:04.470> great<00:02:04.709> there<00:02:04.920> they<00:02:05.280> wish<00:02:05.459> to<00:02:05.489> do<00:02:05.759> so

00:02:05.779 --> 00:02:05.789 
however great there they wish to do so

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.419 
however great there they wish to do so
is<00:02:06.179> so<00:02:06.539> it's<00:02:06.869> been<00:02:07.079> a<00:02:07.110> really<00:02:07.380> good<00:02:07.560> impact<00:02:07.890> for

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
is so it's been a really good impact for

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:13.729 
is so it's been a really good impact for
this<00:02:08.549> club<00:02:08.759> man<00:02:08.940> for<00:02:09.090> Middlesbrough<00:02:12.739> so

00:02:13.729 --> 00:02:13.739 
this club man for Middlesbrough so

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.890 
this club man for Middlesbrough so
