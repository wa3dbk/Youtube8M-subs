take off some of this blue
let's<00:02:21.470> look<00:02:21.830> at<00:02:22.010> how<00:02:22.129> it<00:02:22.250> compares<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.849> other

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
let's look at how it compares to other

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.570 
let's look at how it compares to other
devices<00:02:23.239> like<00:02:23.989> the<00:02:24.230> omnia<00:02:24.680> which<00:02:25.220> is<00:02:25.370> very

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
devices like the omnia which is very

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.780 
devices like the omnia which is very
similar<00:02:25.909> in<00:02:26.090> terms<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.540> resolution<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.790> even

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
similar in terms of resolution and even

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:34.210 
similar in terms of resolution and even
screen<00:02:29.180> size<00:02:30.250> in<00:02:31.599> terms<00:02:32.599> of<00:02:32.810> thickness<00:02:33.379> looks

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:34.220 
screen size in terms of thickness looks

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.330 
screen size in terms of thickness looks
like<00:02:34.430> the<00:02:34.610> insight<00:02:35.239> is<00:02:35.420> a<00:02:35.450> little<00:02:35.780> bit<00:02:35.930> bigger

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
like the insight is a little bit bigger

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.270 
like the insight is a little bit bigger
and<00:02:37.340> let's<00:02:38.209> look<00:02:38.420> at<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.930> touch<00:02:39.409> HD<00:02:39.920> which<00:02:40.159> of

00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:40.280 
and let's look at the touch HD which of

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:42.220 
and let's look at the touch HD which of
course<00:02:40.310> has<00:02:40.819> a<00:02:40.849> much<00:02:41.329> much<00:02:41.659> much<00:02:41.989> larger

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:42.230 
course has a much much much larger

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.149 
course has a much much much larger
screen<00:02:42.799> and<00:02:43.930> is<00:02:44.930> a<00:02:45.170> little<00:02:45.620> bit<00:02:45.739> thinner<00:02:45.920> as

00:02:46.149 --> 00:02:46.159 
screen and is a little bit thinner as

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.750 
screen and is a little bit thinner as
well<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:47.620> let's<00:02:48.620> look<00:02:48.739> at<00:02:48.890> the<00:02:49.010> the<00:02:49.280> epics

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.760 
well and let's look at the the epics

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.009 
well and let's look at the the epics
which<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.150> know<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.299> lot<00:02:50.510> of<00:02:50.540> people<00:02:50.659> are<00:02:50.900> looking

00:02:51.009 --> 00:02:51.019 
which I know a lot of people are looking

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:56.050 
which I know a lot of people are looking
at<00:02:51.260> right<00:02:51.290> now<00:02:51.470> on<00:02:51.709> AT&amp;T<00:02:52.720> so<00:02:53.720> it<00:02:54.019> is<00:02:54.879> not<00:02:55.879> as

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
at right now on AT&amp;T so it is not as

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.819 
at right now on AT&amp;T so it is not as
tall<00:02:56.269> as<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.450> epics<00:02:56.870> it's<00:02:57.079> much<00:02:57.230> smaller<00:02:57.560> in

00:02:57.819 --> 00:02:57.829 
tall as the epics it's much smaller in

00:02:57.829 --> 00:03:00.009 
tall as the epics it's much smaller in
hand<00:02:58.069> and<00:02:58.310> it<00:02:58.819> is<00:02:59.000> probably<00:02:59.480> about<00:02:59.629> the<00:02:59.840> same

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
hand and it is probably about the same

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:01.930 
hand and it is probably about the same
thickness<00:03:00.349> and<00:03:00.709> let's<00:03:01.069> look<00:03:01.310> at<00:03:01.489> the<00:03:01.609> iphone

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
thickness and let's look at the iphone

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:07.979 
thickness and let's look at the iphone
just<00:03:02.180> to<00:03:02.390> finish<00:03:02.750> up<00:03:02.989> the<00:03:03.079> comparisons<00:03:03.560> here

00:03:07.979 --> 00:03:07.989 

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:10.569 

and<00:03:08.989> a<00:03:09.079> little<00:03:09.260> thicker<00:03:09.470> than<00:03:09.620> the<00:03:09.680> iphone<00:03:10.099> so

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:10.579 
and a little thicker than the iphone so

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:12.610 
and a little thicker than the iphone so
my<00:03:11.150> first<00:03:11.569> impressions<00:03:11.989> of<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.200> device<00:03:12.440> is

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
my first impressions of the device is

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.170 
my first impressions of the device is
that<00:03:12.650> it<00:03:12.799> feels<00:03:13.129> high<00:03:13.370> quality<00:03:13.849> it<00:03:13.940> looks

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
that it feels high quality it looks

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.710 
that it feels high quality it looks
great<00:03:14.510> it's<00:03:15.290> a<00:03:15.409> really<00:03:15.560> interesting<00:03:16.390> look<00:03:17.390> for

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:17.720 
great it's a really interesting look for

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.270 
great it's a really interesting look for
windows<00:03:18.019> mobile<00:03:18.200> device<00:03:18.590> and<00:03:18.620> i<00:03:18.980> look<00:03:19.129> forward

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
windows mobile device and i look forward

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.160 
windows mobile device and i look forward
