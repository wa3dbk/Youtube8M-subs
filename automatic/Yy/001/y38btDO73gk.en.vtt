00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:06.000
 Wear protective clothing, goggles, masks, gloves when using RHH PU construction. 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 Application of RHH PU foaming agent 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
 When you operate RHH PU foaming agent, 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
 Please install complete safety equipment 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:25.500
 Including goggles, masks, gloves, overalls, 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.300
 Make sure your skin does not touch the pharmacy 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.200
 For more information, please refer to the video of the security device. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.900
 To operate the RHH PU foaming agent, please undo the safety valve and point the gun at the place where it is applied. 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.100
 Trigger the trigger, the medicament will be ejected from the nozzle 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.300
 The point at this point is that the A/B agent barrel should be kept upright and should not be dumped. 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.700
 The film is filled with PU foaming agent for S-50 large barrels. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.000
 During the construction process, A/B agent double barrel pharmacy, if dumped or lying down, 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.080
 Will cause the pressure in the barrel to be uneven, so that the medicine cannot be ejected. 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.700
 Therefore, in the construction process, please put the A/B agent double barrel medicine in the box and do not take it out. 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.200
 The best construction distance is 50~70 cm, please keep the distance 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.520
 The nozzle on the gun will mix the A/B agent to create a high independent sealed bubble. 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:27.000
 Move the spray gun during construction, please apply from top to bottom 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.800
 The faster the spray gun is, the thinner the foam at the construction site 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.680
 If you want to thicken the foam layer at the construction site, please move the spray gun slowly. 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:41.000
 Made of high independent sealed air bubbles, the foaming volume will be 5-6 times the original 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.540
 So please pay special attention, do not spray too much foaming agent in the same place. 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.300
 Made of high independent sealed bubbles will not stick in 60 seconds 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:02:00.900
 Before drying, if you want to thicken the construction target, you can re-spray a layer of foaming agent on the original construction target. 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.000
 The foamed PU foam can be cut with a sharp blade 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:15.700
 If the thickness of the foam at the construction site needs to be more than 1 inch thick, it is recommended that you can layer the construction. 

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:23.500
 To avoid a situation where the foaming agent will flow down when the foaming agent is too hard to be hardened at one time. 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.900
 You can operate the trigger of the foam gun to control the rate at which chemicals flow out. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.700
 In the beginning, you can push the gun body forward from far away. 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.580
 Until you find the most appropriate position, get the best foaming results 

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:45.300
 If you need to fill an excessive gap, just put the tip of the nozzle 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:50.300
 Place it on the edge of the gap and slowly pull the trigger 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.760
 Please remember that the pharmacy will expand 5 to 6 times and fill the gap. 

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:02.940
 When the foam is cured, it is found that the PU foam does not fill the gap, and a layer of foam can be filled at this time. 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.700
 The second layer of foam will automatically combine with the first layer of foam 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:10.940
 If there are too many foams, cut them with sharp blades. 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:19.040
 PU chemicals are chemically reacted to cure them, so heat is generated during curing. 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:25.720
 If you need to make a large volume of PU foam, the thickness can not exceed 4 inches 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.020
 And must be added layer by layer, one layer after curing, plus another layer
