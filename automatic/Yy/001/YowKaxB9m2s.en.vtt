00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:15.599
 Hello friends! 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.830
 And our pet animals are getting older and in this video 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.439
 we will talk about the special care that we have to give a rabbit 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:25.210
 senior. 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.189
 The first question is when do we think a rabbit has reached seniority? 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.880
 Starting with the first four years of life. 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.560
 What is the life expectancy of a rabbit? Depends 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:41.920
 and rabbit race, but generally between 7 and 9 years. 

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:46.540
 I brought with me a pair of seniors, 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:47.890
 I'll introduce you 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.559
 Bolivia, 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:51.370
 this white rabbit, 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:53.400
 and her husband Popeye, 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.110
 this gorgeous Belier brown. 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.200
 What are the ones 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.680
 common problems that we encounter? 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:02.920
 Starting with 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.110
 aged 4-5, from the moment we think 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.590
 rabbits have become seniors, 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.060
 we have to keep them low 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.280
 once a year to a veterinary check, 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.729
 because in this period the most common problems begin. 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.590
 Which are these? I brought special diets with me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.770
 for these issues. The most common 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:28.329
 are dental problems. 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:31.679
 As I told you a thousand times, the rabbits grow their teeth 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:32.850
 throughout life 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.690
 and they need a fan on them. 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.640
 When they reach seniority and do not eat enough fan, 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.620
 teeth are abnormal and mouths or infections appear in the mouth. 

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.350
 How do we figure out if our rabbit 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.140
 suffer from dental problems? 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.130
 Most of the time, without a veterinarian's control is difficult to figure out because 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.109
 we have to keep his mouth open, let's watch a mini video camera 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.270
 and check how the mouth and teeth of the animal are presented, 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.420
 if we are confronted 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.170
 with an ulcer or a wound, as the molars become sharp 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:09.899
 and hurt both the tongue 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.859
 and cheeks. 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:16.319
 For these rabbits we have this dental diet, which helps them to teeth their teeth faster 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.899
 and that helps to correct the shape of the teeth. 

00:02:19.899 --> 00:02:23.829
 Secondly, another problem commonly encountered in senior rabbits 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:28.130
 is due to kidney disease. Here we have a special diet 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:30.249
 for kidney problems. 

00:02:30.249 --> 00:02:32.429
 It's a diet with a low calcium content. 

00:02:32.429 --> 00:02:37.229
 Why do these problems arise in the kidneys? 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:39.889
 They usually appear 

00:02:39.889 --> 00:02:44.149
 because they have eaten whole foods rich in calcium. 

00:02:44.149 --> 00:02:48.269
 Calcium can be stored on different organs, as well as on the kidneys, 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.969
 calcifying them, making kidney function because the rhinitis cleans the body, 

00:02:52.969 --> 00:02:57.259
 so that this cleaning is no longer appropriate. 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:00.089
 For the kidneys to work well, 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.089
 we have this diet, a diet specially designed to help 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.999
 kidney function. 

00:03:04.999 --> 00:03:08.259
 We'll know if the kidneys work or not 

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:10.810
 only if we do a medical analysis, 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.849
 we will check some parameters, 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.510
 parameters that will help us make a profile, 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:20.960
 we call it renal profile, where we check urea, creatinine, 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:24.009
 calcium and phosphorus in the blood. 

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.239
 And the last one, 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:29.519
 Frequently, although less frequently than before, 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:30.909
 we have the retaliatory problems. 

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:35.689
 Many of these are secondary problems of dental problems, 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.799
 the rabbit teeth are very close to the nose, 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:42.339
 thus, problems and tooth infections become and 

00:03:42.339 --> 00:03:44.059
 nasal problems. 

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:47.839
 For these situations, we have a special diet, also with a low calcium content, 

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:51.429
 special for the seniors' age, 

00:03:51.429 --> 00:03:53.489
 diet "Respiratorio". 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:56.799
 For the most part, these are the main problems, 

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:01.499
 although we can face many more, I insist to tell you that a rabbit, starting with the age of 4-5 years 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:02.649
 becomes senior. 

00:04:02.649 --> 00:04:06.139
 You will notice that they will move less, the older rabbits are quieter, 

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.449
 suffer from osteoarthritis, even if not as much as other species, 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:12.570
 the important thing is to go to the veterinarian, give him control, 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.620
 as in our case, when we get older, we need more care, 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.850
 so do our pets.
