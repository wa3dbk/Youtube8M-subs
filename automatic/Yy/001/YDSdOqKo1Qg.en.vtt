00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:20.320 
so we're going to cut it down cut it

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:36.660 
so we're going to cut it down cut it
down<00:03:20.650> and<00:03:22.380> try<00:03:23.380> to<00:03:25.230> match<00:03:26.230> it<00:03:26.260> up<00:03:34.620> so<00:03:35.620> again<00:03:36.280> add

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
down and try to match it up so again add

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:41.729

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
try to make it straight and the idea is

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.420 
try to make it straight and the idea is
to<00:03:58.290> go<00:03:59.010> around<00:03:59.130> the<00:03:59.370> entire<00:03:59.690> bangle<00:04:00.690> and<00:04:01.430> once
