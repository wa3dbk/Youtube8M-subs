00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
you're not going to need to get a lot of

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.400 
you're not going to need to get a lot of
materials<00:00:05.850> for<00:00:06.089> this<00:00:06.180> project<00:00:06.240> you<00:00:07.080> can<00:00:07.109> use<00:00:07.379> a

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:07.410 
materials for this project you can use a

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.690 
materials for this project you can use a
lot<00:00:07.649> of<00:00:07.680> things<00:00:07.980> that<00:00:08.130> you<00:00:08.160> can<00:00:08.220> find<00:00:08.550> around

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
lot of things that you can find around

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.950 
lot of things that you can find around
at<00:00:09.030> home<00:00:09.210> so<00:00:09.599> I'm<00:00:09.840> just<00:00:10.080> going<00:00:10.200> to<00:00:10.290> get<00:00:10.380> started

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:11.960 
at home so I'm just going to get started

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.150 
at home so I'm just going to get started
the<00:00:12.960> first<00:00:12.990> things<00:00:13.410> you're<00:00:13.559> gonna<00:00:13.710> need<00:00:13.860> are

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
the first things you're gonna need are

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.740 
the first things you're gonna need are
some<00:00:14.429> silicone<00:00:14.820> molds<00:00:15.150> and<00:00:15.210> you<00:00:15.420> will<00:00:15.570> do

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
some silicone molds and you will do

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.050 
some silicone molds and you will do
chocolates<00:00:16.619> of<00:00:16.770> your<00:00:16.920> choice<00:00:17.220> any<00:00:17.490> flavor<00:00:17.789> a

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
chocolates of your choice any flavor a

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.570 
chocolates of your choice any flavor a
metal<00:00:18.480> dish<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.960> a<00:00:19.410> larger<00:00:19.890> dish<00:00:20.070> so<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.400> can

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
metal dish and a larger dish so you can

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:23.269 
metal dish and a larger dish so you can
put<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.850> metal<00:00:21.060> one<00:00:21.270> inside<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.279> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
put the metal one inside of it the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.920 
put the metal one inside of it the
reason<00:00:23.670> we're<00:00:23.789> using<00:00:23.820> silicone<00:00:24.600> mold<00:00:24.779> is

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
reason we're using silicone mold is

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.570 
reason we're using silicone mold is
because<00:00:25.230> it's<00:00:25.410> flexible<00:00:25.920> this<00:00:26.189> is<00:00:26.340> going<00:00:26.490> to

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
because it's flexible this is going to

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:27.679 
because it's flexible this is going to
make<00:00:26.699> it<00:00:26.849> easier<00:00:27.150> to<00:00:27.210> push<00:00:27.449> out<00:00:27.599> the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
make it easier to push out the

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:30.830 
make it easier to push out the
chocolates<00:00:28.170> later<00:00:28.760> you<00:00:29.760> also<00:00:29.970> do<00:00:30.300> not<00:00:30.449> want<00:00:30.720> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
chocolates later you also do not want to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.020 
chocolates later you also do not want to
directly<00:00:31.289> put<00:00:31.529> chocolate<00:00:31.800> into<00:00:32.399> a<00:00:32.430> hot<00:00:33.000> pan

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
directly put chocolate into a hot pan

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.780 
directly put chocolate into a hot pan
the<00:00:33.899> chocolate<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.350> going<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.770> burn<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.340> you

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the chocolate is going to burn and you

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.430 
the chocolate is going to burn and you
do<00:00:35.940> not<00:00:36.090> want<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.390> put<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.690> metal<00:00:36.899> dish<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.380> a

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
do not want to put the metal dish in a

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680 
do not want to put the metal dish in a
microwave<00:00:38.070> because<00:00:38.370> microwaves<00:00:39.149> and<00:00:39.390> metal

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690 
microwave because microwaves and metal

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.139 
microwave because microwaves and metal
do<00:00:39.989> not<00:00:40.140> mix<00:00:40.320> well<00:00:40.500> together<00:00:40.850> also<00:00:41.850> because

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
do not mix well together also because

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.880 
do not mix well together also because
the<00:00:42.480> microwave<00:00:42.870> usually<00:00:43.230> eats<00:00:43.410> up<00:00:43.559> a<00:00:43.680> little

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
the microwave usually eats up a little

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.619 
the microwave usually eats up a little
too<00:00:44.010> fast<00:00:44.250> your<00:00:44.760> chocolate<00:00:45.000> will<00:00:45.270> most<00:00:45.450> likely

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
too fast your chocolate will most likely

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.660 
too fast your chocolate will most likely
burn<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.590> because<00:00:46.739> chocolate<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.520> very

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
burn this is because chocolate it's very

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.910 
burn this is because chocolate it's very
sensitive<00:00:48.000> to<00:00:48.360> heat<00:00:48.510> so<00:00:49.260> first<00:00:49.680> what<00:00:49.800> you're

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
sensitive to heat so first what you're

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.899 
sensitive to heat so first what you're
going<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.100> do<00:00:50.219> is<00:00:50.399> boil<00:00:50.670> some<00:00:50.910> water

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:56.970 

once<00:00:54.909> your<00:00:55.089> water<00:00:55.269> is<00:00:55.570> finally<00:00:55.989> boiled<00:00:56.379> we<00:00:56.829> are

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
once your water is finally boiled we are

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.709 
once your water is finally boiled we are
going<00:00:57.129> to<00:00:57.250> pour<00:00:57.429> this<00:00:57.550> water<00:00:57.609> into<00:00:58.179> the<00:00:58.300> larger

00:00:58.709 --> 00:00:58.719 
going to pour this water into the larger

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:01.799 
going to pour this water into the larger
dish<00:00:59.969> next<00:01:00.969> you're<00:01:01.179> going<00:01:01.269> to<00:01:01.329> put<00:01:01.510> the<00:01:01.600> metal

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
dish next you're going to put the metal

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:04.200 
dish next you're going to put the metal
dish<00:01:02.019> into<00:01:02.320> the<00:01:02.890> bigger<00:01:03.219> bowl<00:01:03.460> and<00:01:03.729> it's<00:01:04.000> just

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
dish into the bigger bowl and it's just

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.670 
dish into the bigger bowl and it's just
going<00:01:04.360> to<00:01:04.390> be<00:01:04.449> floating<00:01:04.869> there<00:01:05.019> you're<00:01:05.530> going

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:05.680 
going to be floating there you're going

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.410 
going to be floating there you're going
to<00:01:05.740> break<00:01:05.920> your<00:01:06.310> chocolate<00:01:06.759> pieces<00:01:06.939> up<00:01:07.240> and

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
to break your chocolate pieces up and

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.539 
to break your chocolate pieces up and
then<00:01:07.630> put<00:01:07.659> it<00:01:07.990> into<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.320> metal<00:01:08.530> dish<00:01:08.799> notice

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:09.549 
then put it into the metal dish notice

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:10.920 
then put it into the metal dish notice
how<00:01:09.729> your<00:01:09.880> chocolate<00:01:10.270> is<00:01:10.420> immediately

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930 
how your chocolate is immediately

melting and you're just going to keep

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:14.010 
melting and you're just going to keep
stirring<00:01:12.640> until<00:01:12.729> it's<00:01:13.090> fully<00:01:13.360> melted<00:01:13.630> and

stirring until it's fully melted and

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.660 
stirring until it's fully melted and
really<00:01:14.950> really<00:01:15.220> liquidy<00:01:15.430> like<00:01:15.850> this<00:01:17.189> now<00:01:18.189> this

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
really really liquidy like this now this

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.190 
really really liquidy like this now this
is<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.909> mold<00:01:19.210> we're<00:01:19.420> going<00:01:19.630> to<00:01:19.750> be<00:01:19.840> using<00:01:20.049> for

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:20.200 
is the mold we're going to be using for

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:21.690 
is the mold we're going to be using for
this<00:01:20.439> tutorial<00:01:20.649> and<00:01:21.159> what<00:01:21.340> you're<00:01:21.490> going<00:01:21.640> to

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
small spoon the chocolate into the mold

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.789 
small spoon the chocolate into the mold
this<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.690> what<00:01:28.840> mine<00:01:29.020> looks<00:01:29.229> like<00:01:29.380> after<00:01:29.590> I've

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:29.799 
this is what mine looks like after I've

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:32.010 
this is what mine looks like after I've
added<00:01:30.009> in<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.220> chocolate<00:01:30.729> and<00:01:30.970> if<00:01:31.630> you<00:01:31.780> want

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
added in the chocolate and if you want

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.080 
added in the chocolate and if you want
you<00:01:32.200> can<00:01:32.319> use<00:01:32.560> a<00:01:32.770> small<00:01:33.069> toothpick<00:01:33.549> to<00:01:33.729> kind<00:01:33.970> of

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
you can use a small toothpick to kind of

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.520 
you can use a small toothpick to kind of
swirl<00:01:34.330> around<00:01:34.479> the<00:01:34.690> chocolate<00:01:35.080> and<00:01:35.110> make<00:01:35.380> it

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:35.530 
swirl around the chocolate and make it

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:40.199 
swirl around the chocolate and make it
look<00:01:35.649> a<00:01:35.770> little<00:01:35.920> more<00:01:36.039> presentable<00:01:39.209> afterward

00:01:40.199 --> 00:01:40.209 
look a little more presentable afterward
