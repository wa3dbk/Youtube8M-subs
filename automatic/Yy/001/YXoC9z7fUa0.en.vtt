either
I've<00:00:27.269> played<00:00:27.599> it<00:00:27.720> before<00:00:28.140> and<00:00:28.699> I<00:00:29.699> used<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.420> take

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
I've played it before and I used to take

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.999 
I've played it before and I used to take
it<00:00:30.840> for<00:00:30.960> my<00:00:31.050> brother<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.590> time<00:00:31.769> that's

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
it for my brother all the time that's

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.549 
it for my brother all the time that's
why<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:33.059> wanted<00:00:33.630> to<00:00:33.690> get<00:00:33.809> my<00:00:33.899> own<00:00:34.020> copy<00:00:34.230> so<00:00:34.530> I

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
why I wanted to get my own copy so I

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.500 
why I wanted to get my own copy so I
could<00:00:34.710> play<00:00:34.829> whenever<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.160> wanted<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.760> so<00:00:36.480> I

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
could play whenever I wanted and so I

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.780 
could play whenever I wanted and so I
got<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.800> knew<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.129> was<00:00:38.250> compatible<00:00:38.579> with

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
got it and I knew it was compatible with

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.190 
got it and I knew it was compatible with
the<00:00:38.879> power<00:00:39.059> sales<00:00:39.360> Pro<00:00:39.660> so<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:41.040> thought<00:00:41.399> um<00:00:42.200> why

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
the power sales Pro so I thought um why

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
the power sales Pro so I thought um why
don't<00:00:43.379> we<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.620> a<00:00:43.649> video<00:00:43.950> on<00:00:44.129> it<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.550> I'll<00:00:44.879> this

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
don't we do a video on it and I'll this

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
don't we do a video on it and I'll this
is<00:00:45.600> like<00:00:45.780> my<00:00:45.960> first<00:00:46.140> time<00:00:46.289> I've<00:00:46.559> never<00:00:46.680> put<00:00:46.920> any

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
is like my first time I've never put any

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.160 
is like my first time I've never put any
codes<00:00:47.309> on<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.789> so<00:00:48.600> I<00:00:48.629> thought<00:00:48.870> it<00:00:48.960> would<00:00:49.050> be<00:00:49.140> a

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
codes on it so I thought it would be a

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.889 
codes on it so I thought it would be a
really<00:00:49.379> good<00:00:49.620> opportunity<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.660> let<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:51.750> guys

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
really good opportunity to let you guys

see what's on here so let's go ahead and
get<00:00:54.059> into<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.329> codes<00:00:54.629> so<00:00:55.050> we<00:00:55.949> only<00:00:56.250> only<00:00:56.399> codes

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
get back to you guys when the codes are

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.140 
get back to you guys when the codes are
on<00:01:38.689> okay<00:01:39.689> so<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> didn't<00:01:40.350> take<00:01:40.530> that<00:01:40.680> long<00:01:40.860> about

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
on okay so I didn't take that long about

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
on okay so I didn't take that long about
one<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.479> three<00:01:42.509> minutes<00:01:43.290> at<00:01:43.439> max<00:01:43.680> the<00:01:44.159> thing<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
one to three minutes at max the thing it

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.200 
one to three minutes at max the thing it
took<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.570> most<00:01:45.750> was<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.140> last<00:01:46.350> category<00:01:46.710> um<00:01:47.399> I

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
took the most was the last category um I

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.389 
took the most was the last category um I
think<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.320> was<00:01:49.350> like<00:01:49.500> writing<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.950> cartridge

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
think it was like writing the cartridge

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.090 
think it was like writing the cartridge
but<00:01:51.329> we're<00:01:51.689> going<00:01:51.869> to<00:01:51.930> go<00:01:52.140> ahead<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.770> take<00:01:53.070> it

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
but we're going to go ahead and take it

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.880 
but we're going to go ahead and take it
out<00:01:53.780> and<00:01:54.780> we're<00:01:54.930> going<00:01:55.049> to<00:01:55.170> go<00:01:55.290> ahead<00:01:55.350> and<00:01:55.619> test

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
out and we're going to go ahead and test

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.980 
out and we're going to go ahead and test
the<00:01:56.100> codes<00:01:56.369> my<00:01:57.360> peach<00:01:57.920> 3dsxl<00:01:59.719> going<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> do
