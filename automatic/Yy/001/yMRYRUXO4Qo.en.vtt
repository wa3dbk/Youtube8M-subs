land<00:01:35.909> and<00:01:36.180> then<00:01:36.990> my<00:01:37.890> rare<00:01:38.220> yeah<00:01:39.119> my<00:01:39.540> rare<00:01:39.780> is<00:01:39.960> an

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
land and then my rare yeah my rare is an

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.179 
land and then my rare yeah my rare is an
awk<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:42.030> know<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.479> mean<00:01:42.770> other<00:01:43.770> than<00:01:43.890> that

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
awk so you know I mean other than that

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.069 
awk so you know I mean other than that
island<00:01:44.670> not<00:01:44.850> have<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> say<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.659> counter

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
island not have to say that that counter

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:48.440 
island not have to say that that counter
style<00:01:46.380> is<00:01:46.590> probably<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.490> most<00:01:47.640> useful<00:01:47.790> card<00:01:48.329> I

the<00:01:51.509> second<00:01:51.990> one<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.200> a

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
the second one is a

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:54.590 
the second one is a
little<00:01:52.750> more<00:01:52.990> a<00:01:53.290> little<00:01:53.649> more<00:01:53.920> productive

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
little more a little more productive
