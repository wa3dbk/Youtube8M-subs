00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.330
 While we were thinking about Gran Turismo, 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:45.060
 All we had in mind was how we could benefit from what we learned from Formula 1, 

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:54.080
 Reviving it in the GT car, and how we can design a GT car originated from the track but also still enjoy the sense of race. 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.170
 We have had great cooperation with all the studios. 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.330
 But the final design was chosen from Beijing Studio. 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.070
 - Can you view it on screen? -Of course. 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.340
 It's a stunning project. 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.460
 All designers want to design a car without borders. 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.210
 Archy downloading. 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.350
 We want a sensual, attractive and futuristic car design. 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.990
 Along with its strength and impact from the first look. 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:36.410
 Looking at it from the front, you can see a strong, sharp and wide grid along with many sharp details. 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.080
 With curves in the strong shelves around the tires. 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.380
 It seems as if all forces are far away, but at the same time close. 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.530
 This gives her a strong appearance. 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.400
 From the first graphic design to her until the production of the last style, 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:14.470
 INFINITI CONCEPT Vision Gran Turismo is designed at the newly opened Infiniti Design Beijing. 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:17.210
 Through this modern studio, 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.830
 Young designers from China knew the Infiniti car heritage and were able to understand the language of the Infiniti structure. 

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.480
 They put their wishes into this powerful car. 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.530
 "Sense and Power" 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.230
 Namely the concept of INFINITI CONCEPT Vision Gran Turismo. 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.170
 Installed in front of the engine V8 8 Cylinder natural pull system, 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.770
 And the rear-wheel drive motor scheme using a rear axle motor. 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:50.770
 As a result, we designed a car that will make you feel fun while driving and this makes you want to see your returns over and over again.
