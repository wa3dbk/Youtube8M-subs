00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
opinion this is a nicely done stretch

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.190 
opinion this is a nicely done stretch
between<00:01:50.880> old-school<00:01:51.630> design<00:01:51.959> and

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
between old-school design and

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.980 
between old-school design and
frustration<00:01:52.709> free<00:01:52.950> progression<00:01:53.780> the<00:01:54.780> better

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
frustration free progression the better

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.289 
frustration free progression the better
you<00:01:55.200> know<00:01:55.319> the<00:01:55.500> game<00:01:55.679> the<00:01:56.190> easier<00:01:56.580> it<00:01:56.700> gets<00:01:56.759> so

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
you know the game the easier it gets so

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.179 
you know the game the easier it gets so
you<00:01:57.390> don't<00:01:57.600> need<00:01:57.840> all<00:01:58.049> those<00:01:58.320> 30<00:01:58.649> lives<00:01:58.890> of<00:01:59.100> the

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.229 
real flaw of this game has before I got
a<00:02:06.509> hang<00:02:06.719> of<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:06.990> I<00:02:07.140> lost<00:02:07.439> like<00:02:07.590> 25<00:02:08.519> of<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.940> 30

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:09.239 
a hang of it I lost like 25 of my 30

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:10.789 
a hang of it I lost like 25 of my 30
lives<00:02:09.479> before<00:02:09.810> I<00:02:09.989> got<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.289> beat<00:02:10.470> the<00:02:10.560> stage

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:10.799 
lives before I got to beat the stage

00:02:10.799 --> 00:02:13.490 
lives before I got to beat the stage
boss<00:02:11.070> but<00:02:11.880> starting<00:02:12.390> a<00:02:12.420> new<00:02:12.750> level<00:02:12.989> with<00:02:13.170> only

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
boss but starting a new level with only

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.650 
boss but starting a new level with only
five<00:02:13.829> lives<00:02:14.100> left<00:02:14.250> is<00:02:14.609> pretty<00:02:15.030> pointless<00:02:15.420> in

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
five lives left is pretty pointless in

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.300 
five lives left is pretty pointless in
my<00:02:15.780> opinion<00:02:16.109> especially<00:02:16.530> when<00:02:17.010> you're<00:02:17.190> not

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
my opinion especially when you're not

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.520 
my opinion especially when you're not
good<00:02:17.579> enough<00:02:17.609> yet<00:02:18.109> so<00:02:19.109> I<00:02:19.140> found<00:02:19.350> myself

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
good enough yet so I found myself

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.199 
good enough yet so I found myself
committing<00:02:20.070> suicide<00:02:20.519> a<00:02:20.549> few<00:02:20.640> times<00:02:21.030> and

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209 
committing suicide a few times and

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.080 
committing suicide a few times and
that's<00:02:21.630> bad<00:02:22.019> for<00:02:22.230> my<00:02:22.320> statistics<00:02:22.890> so<00:02:23.700> I<00:02:23.730> wish<00:02:23.970> I

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
that's bad for my statistics so I wish I

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.940 
that's bad for my statistics so I wish I
got<00:02:24.269> those<00:02:24.480> 30<00:02:24.780> lives<00:02:24.989> back<00:02:25.230> as<00:02:25.440> soon<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.829> got

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
got those 30 lives back as soon as I got

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.370 
got those 30 lives back as soon as I got
to<00:02:26.100> beat<00:02:26.280> one<00:02:26.459> stage<00:02:26.730> especially<00:02:27.630> since<00:02:28.260> I

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
to beat one stage especially since I

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.319 
to beat one stage especially since I
gained<00:02:28.620> a<00:02:28.769> lot<00:02:28.980> of<00:02:29.040> motivation<00:02:29.519> to<00:02:29.820> visit<00:02:30.090> soft

levels once more as soon as I found

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.660

early levels like asshole Vania may only

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.460 
early levels like asshole Vania may only
test<00:03:39.730> your<00:03:39.970> timing<00:03:40.390> skills<00:03:40.690> but<00:03:41.080> things<00:03:41.290> can

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
test your timing skills but things can

get pretty complicated after a while
still<00:03:44.739> the<00:03:45.010> level<00:03:45.310> design<00:03:45.400> is<00:03:45.640> always<00:03:46.360> fair<00:03:46.659> so

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:47.140 
still the level design is always fair so

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:48.420 
still the level design is always fair so
you<00:03:47.230> could<00:03:47.409> actually<00:03:47.650> beat<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> whole<00:03:48.400> game

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
without losing even one life and you'd

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.180 
without losing even one life and you'd

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:54.190 
even get a steam achievement for it but

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.289 
even get a steam achievement for it but
i'm<00:03:54.310> pretty<00:03:54.430> sure<00:03:54.700> that<00:03:54.730> it<00:03:54.970> will<00:03:55.060> take<00:03:55.269> a
