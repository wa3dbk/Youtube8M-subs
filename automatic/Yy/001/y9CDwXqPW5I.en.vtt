00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
I highly doubt should they'll end the

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.899 
I highly doubt should they'll end the
series<00:01:58.680> off<00:01:58.829> of<00:01:59.009> he<00:01:59.130> may<00:01:59.280> completely

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
quitting the student council most likely

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.770 
quitting the student council most likely
next<00:02:02.189> episode<00:02:02.670> they'll<00:02:02.880> come<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.270> apologize

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.929 
next episode they'll come to apologize
the<00:02:03.990> he<00:02:04.140> may<00:02:04.320> and<00:02:04.590> try<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.009> something<00:02:05.520> to<00:02:05.670> make

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:08.839 
amends for it and he will join back
that's<00:02:08.190> why<00:02:08.280> I<00:02:08.310> think<00:02:08.399> it's<00:02:08.580> gonna<00:02:08.670> happen

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
that's why I think it's gonna happen

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.690 
that's why I think it's gonna happen
next<00:02:09.090> episode<00:02:09.599> but<00:02:10.080> either<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.619> I<00:02:10.950> felt<00:02:11.489> like
