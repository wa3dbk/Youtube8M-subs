00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 what will happen in this 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.680
 the video may scare you away from the league 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.030
 legends but you know this happens not 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:14.130
 always hello everyone with you sly baba playing 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.020
 in league of legends for fiddlestica and now I 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.750
 tell you how to play for him 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.539
 here now begin the blue buff 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.570
 naturally you like 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:26.930
 for almost all the jungle mages you 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.539
 should in theory help him to pick up 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.920
 pretty cool stuff and swing it 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.160
 that is, she is not very much in the forest 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.590
 useful but nonetheless often 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.640
 The moment when here such here when udir 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
 comes and 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.290
 in style then my bafta yes and you kind of 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.090
 man already has more than not needed 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.309
 lines by the way as you can see everything is more or less 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.930
 well insist dude who can 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:54.030
 put a lot of demage now you saw me 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:57.090
 sauce walked he stood right there pasted 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.649
 such an impermissible jangash of him 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.289
 caught in extreme cases 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:03.270
 You see my team on such aggression 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.129
 what the form keepers are doing 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.900
 I do not understand why she is 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.560
 that part of the husband comes out if udir you run 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.180
 it will be very bad to the bot right now 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.760
 maybe the guarantor will start a little bit 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.860
 agreed we can all bark man 

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:18.689

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.390
 such files are actually no 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.620
 the jungler will not help even much stronger i 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.680

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:32.290
 how to jump he stands still and 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.740
 Ulta actually can knock down that it is necessary to 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:38.530
 feel that is if you are here now 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:42.160
 she will kill maybe even sacred 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:46.000
 kill something agry try it 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:52.210
 kill die already there are several 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.340
 options like pumping my god you are right 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.640
 genius friends here such jugglers 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:02:01.330
 salon understood something bath but he understands 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.670
 the situation met with excellent forms 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.800
 chained and all the enemy jungler 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 very strange this here you see what what 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.899
 I'm already 2 times 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.770
 careless he runs very far then 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.170
 there is 04 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.300
 I certainly understand that I am his nigga lines 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:18.340
 wave there is an option 0 because it is a line 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.530

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.510

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.800
 well garena stole is already so pretty 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:30.070
 tough on him even already hearing killing it 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:34.170
 generally just a nonsense of the idea are 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:38.260
 moments when some kind of line is lame 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:41.440
 shawl blanks alice i have my friends again 

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:44.140
 dying then why not why not 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.110
 die five times why will you die 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:49.810
 when I decided to write down a gaze why not 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:53.010
 die five times above the windows why 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.010
 need help 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:07.880
 that you are all friends here so here 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:12.230
 done then they kill my sa there 

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.770
 decides die friends 6 times what with this i 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:14.770
 himself not 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:22.610
 skunk, too, decides to dedicate friends well 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:27.290
 here it happens but nevertheless I 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.120
 no matter how despair hope dies 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.300
 the latter being said principle le 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:37.430
 blanks are less normal looking 

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:40.400
 Of course, too, itâ€™s necessary to be friends at all. 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:42.590
 this is the name of the game I fill it 

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:45.319
 video is video I want to show you 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.170
 what happens sometimes like this 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:52.700
 comment 

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:56.239
 I can not have such a trash and if more 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:59.150
 friends are blinking here , I just like 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:02.720
 generally shocked by what is happening that is 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:06.350
 I'm still doing a trial, that is 07 already what 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.940
 sometimes blitzkrank creates 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:13.280
 form your own and hear in such a game in 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.510
 Such a game, nothing will help you if 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.510
 these guys here with 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:21.680
 gone progress overall surrender on 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:25.580
 twentieth minute 

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.890
 what to buy next there 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.940
 This game even plays reluctance when here 

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:30.940
 so everything is bad 

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.839
 you see in general this is kapets i will forest 

00:04:34.769 --> 00:04:39.209
 farm because nothing will help 

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:43.849
 I already have at least a rest in it 

00:04:39.209 --> 00:04:50.729
 little ball just see 08 from 

00:04:43.849 --> 00:04:54.929
 Jason Olya 8 from Opera Super Tashcher in 05 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:59.819
 fit without stopping or lanka more or less 

00:04:54.929 --> 00:05:03.269
 normal mid and blitzkrank snook view 005 

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:08.449
 on me well what is it that's just nonsense 

00:05:03.269 --> 00:05:11.710
 some way will follow 

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:11.710
 and we have two sofa 

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:21.669
 that's what they are so friends what's the problem i 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:23.440
 I do not know with just probably could not 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:26.410
 stop the physicist he just decided 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.990
 die them says I damn break the tower 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.430
 but I don't know I'll die a million times, but I 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:35.139
 I'll break her, he just believed in himself 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:39.060
 fikov's hunt to become general 

00:05:35.139 --> 00:05:42.060
 Nothing to do a minute of silence 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.520
 honor honor 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:50.319
 blitzkrank who could not stand the heat 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:53.259
 passions nevertheless by the way i'm like again 

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:55.599
 you see the line continues to push the shield 

00:05:53.259 --> 00:06:00.069
 he really had a goal like that I don't know 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:01.690
 In general, something is wrong by the way if 

00:06:00.069 --> 00:06:05.050
 Here you have such a bad game you can 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:09.909
 submit to mount now the most 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:12.759

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:14.440

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:18.520
 just 01 

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:20.800
 I will drink until the end well, in general, that's all 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:21.880

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:26.460
