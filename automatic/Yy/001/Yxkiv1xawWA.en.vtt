00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
way that allows them to understand how

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.300 
way that allows them to understand how
the<00:04:02.480> weapon<00:04:02.660> works<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.500> that's<00:04:03.770> how<00:04:03.920> we<00:04:04.040> can<00:04:04.130> go

and I realized that being a manager you
can<00:04:20.870> work<00:04:21.140> with<00:04:21.290> those<00:04:21.410> things<00:04:21.680> but<00:04:21.859> from<00:04:22.100> a

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.160 
can work with those things but from a

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.490 
can work with those things but from a
