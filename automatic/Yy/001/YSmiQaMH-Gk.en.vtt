that<00:01:17.090> leopards<00:01:17.479> prototype<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.940> so<00:01:19.940> instead<00:01:20.240> I

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
that leopards prototype a so instead I

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.120 
that leopards prototype a so instead I
thought<00:01:20.660> it<00:01:20.810> was<00:01:20.899> a<00:01:20.959> good<00:01:21.140> idea<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.530> try<00:01:22.009> and

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
thought it was a good idea to try and

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.490 
thought it was a good idea to try and
dominate<00:01:22.250> this<00:01:22.550> whole<00:01:22.729> island<00:01:23.119> area<00:01:23.500> of

on his map but it's you shouldn't take

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.370 
on his map but it's you shouldn't take
it<00:01:28.940> at<00:01:29.270> all<00:01:29.450> costs<00:01:29.750> you<00:01:29.990> don't<00:01:30.170> have<00:01:30.289> to
