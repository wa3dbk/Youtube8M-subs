welcome<00:00:00.960> dialect<00:00:01.350> online<00:00:01.709> today<00:00:02.070> we're<00:00:02.370> going

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:02.490 
welcome dialect online today we're going

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:03.919 
welcome dialect online today we're going
to<00:00:02.610> talk<00:00:02.760> a<00:00:02.790> little<00:00:02.909> bit<00:00:03.120> more<00:00:03.300> about<00:00:03.449> physics

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
to talk a little bit more about physics

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.260 
to talk a little bit more about physics
and<00:00:04.230> in<00:00:04.380> particular<00:00:04.730> optics<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:06.000> of<00:00:06.060> course

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:06.270 
and in particular optics and of course

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.169 
and in particular optics and of course
optics<00:00:06.690> is<00:00:06.870> a<00:00:06.899> very<00:00:07.230> broad<00:00:08.010> subject<00:00:08.069> and<00:00:08.849> so

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
optics is a very broad subject and so

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
optics is a very broad subject and so
we're<00:00:09.300> going<00:00:09.450> to<00:00:09.540> take<00:00:09.719> it<00:00:09.870> one<00:00:09.990> step<00:00:10.230> at<00:00:10.290> a

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
we're going to take it one step at a

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:10.820 
we're going to take it one step at a
time

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
time

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.610 
time
first<00:00:11.340> topic<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.940> optics<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.630> reflection

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
first topic in optics is reflection

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.709 
first topic in optics is reflection
reflection<00:00:14.280> of<00:00:14.400> light<00:00:14.639> against<00:00:15.509> like<00:00:15.690> a

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
reflection of light against like a

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.710 
reflection of light against like a
mirror<00:00:16.199> or<00:00:16.379> a<00:00:16.410> shiny<00:00:16.740> surface<00:00:17.010> and<00:00:17.510> the<00:00:18.510> only

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
mirror or a shiny surface and the only

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.060 
mirror or a shiny surface and the only
thing<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:18.990> need<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.230> know<00:00:19.350> about<00:00:19.439> reflection

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
thing we need to know about reflection

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.689 
thing we need to know about reflection
is<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.880> whenever<00:00:21.150> we<00:00:21.390> have<00:00:21.420> an<00:00:21.720> inbound<00:00:22.140> ray

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:22.699 
is that whenever we have an inbound ray

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:25.040 
is that whenever we have an inbound ray
reflecting<00:00:23.699> off<00:00:23.880> a<00:00:24.060> shiny<00:00:24.390> surface<00:00:24.869> like<00:00:25.019> a

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
reflecting off a shiny surface like a

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.560 
reflecting off a shiny surface like a
mirror<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.980> angle<00:00:26.460> of<00:00:26.550> incidence<00:00:27.090> which<00:00:27.390> is

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
mirror the angle of incidence which is

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.419 
mirror the angle of incidence which is
defined<00:00:27.990> by<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.380> angle<00:00:28.920> between<00:00:29.099> the

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
defined by the angle between the

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.179 
defined by the angle between the
uncoming<00:00:30.090> ray<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:31.019> normal<00:00:31.410> line<00:00:31.859> to<00:00:32.070> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
uncoming ray and the normal line to the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.630 
uncoming ray and the normal line to the
surface<00:00:32.610> now<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.880> normal<00:00:33.450> line<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.870> the

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:34.640 
surface now the normal line is the

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.100 
surface now the normal line is the
imaginary<00:00:35.640> line<00:00:35.730> that's<00:00:36.270> perpendicular<00:00:36.510> to

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
imaginary line that's perpendicular to

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.880 
imaginary line that's perpendicular to
the<00:00:37.440> surface<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.540> the<00:00:39.540> angle<00:00:40.260> of<00:00:40.440> incidence

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the surface and the angle of incidence

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.950 
the surface and the angle of incidence
which<00:00:41.489> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:41.760> angle<00:00:42.030> between<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.390> incoming

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
which is the angle between the incoming

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.930 
which is the angle between the incoming
ray<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.559> normal<00:00:44.010> line<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.430> always<00:00:44.670> equal

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
ray and that normal line is always equal

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.020 
ray and that normal line is always equal
to<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.390> angle<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.410> reflection<00:00:46.469> the<00:00:47.370> theta<00:00:47.730> sub

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
to the angle of reflection the theta sub

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.819 
to the angle of reflection the theta sub
R<00:00:48.180> as<00:00:48.300> we<00:00:48.450> call<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.899> which<00:00:49.350> is<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> angle

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
R as we call it which is the angle

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.830 
R as we call it which is the angle
between<00:00:49.950> the<00:00:50.309> exiting<00:00:50.879> ray<00:00:51.059> and<00:00:51.329> the<00:00:51.660> normal

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
between the exiting ray and the normal

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.689 
between the exiting ray and the normal
so<00:00:52.199> these<00:00:52.410> two<00:00:52.620> angles<00:00:52.800> are<00:00:53.100> always<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.670> same

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
so these two angles are always the same

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.020 
so these two angles are always the same
anytime<00:00:54.690> there's<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> reflection<00:00:55.520> and<00:00:56.520> so<00:00:56.760> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
anytime there's a reflection and so the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
anytime there's a reflection and so the
entire<00:00:57.840> equation<00:00:58.109> comes<00:00:58.440> down<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.609> angle

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
entire equation comes down to the angle

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.459 
entire equation comes down to the angle
of<00:01:00.000> incidence<00:01:00.420> equals<00:01:00.629> the<00:01:00.930> angle<00:01:01.079> of

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
of incidence equals the angle of

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.130 
of incidence equals the angle of
reflection<00:01:01.699> now<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:03.000> seemed<00:01:03.300> easy<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.930> it

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
reflection now that seemed easy and it

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.410 
reflection now that seemed easy and it
is<00:01:04.170> now<00:01:04.949> can<00:01:05.250> we<00:01:05.369> apply<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.729> something<00:01:06.299> that's

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
is now can we apply to something that's

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.149 
is now can we apply to something that's
a<00:01:06.540> little<00:01:06.570> bit<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:06.990> complicated<00:01:07.320> so<00:01:08.130> let's

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
a little bit more complicated so let's

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.280 
a little bit more complicated so let's
say<00:01:08.460> we<00:01:08.580> have<00:01:08.760> what<00:01:08.939> we<00:01:09.060> call<00:01:09.210> here<00:01:09.570> a<00:01:09.600> corner

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
say we have what we call here a corner

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.920 
say we have what we call here a corner
reflector<00:01:10.860> and<00:01:11.250> we<00:01:11.580> have<00:01:11.700> an<00:01:11.820> inbound<00:01:12.270> ray<00:01:12.630> of

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
reflector and we have an inbound ray of

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.710 
reflector and we have an inbound ray of
light<00:01:13.229> at<00:01:13.530> an<00:01:14.189> angle<00:01:14.490> of<00:01:14.549> 60<00:01:14.610> degrees<00:01:15.299> with<00:01:15.689> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
light at an angle of 60 degrees with the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.830 
light at an angle of 60 degrees with the
horizontal<00:01:16.400> what<00:01:17.400> will<00:01:17.580> be<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.210> angle

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
horizontal what will be the angle

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.740 
horizontal what will be the angle
between<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.439> inbound<00:01:20.070> ray<00:01:20.340> and<00:01:20.670> the<00:01:21.090> exiting

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
between the inbound ray and the exiting

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.140 
between the inbound ray and the exiting
ray<00:01:21.930> after<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.500> bounces<00:01:22.920> off<00:01:23.100> these<00:01:23.460> two

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
ray after it bounces off these two

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.450 
ray after it bounces off these two
surfaces<00:01:24.720> that<00:01:24.780> are<00:01:24.960> at<00:01:25.200> right<00:01:25.770> angles<00:01:26.159> to<00:01:26.220> one

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
surfaces that are at right angles to one

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.760 
surfaces that are at right angles to one
another<00:01:26.520> all<00:01:27.330> right<00:01:27.509> so<00:01:28.049> what<00:01:28.409> we're<00:01:28.560> going<00:01:28.710> to

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
another all right so what we're going to

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.679 
another all right so what we're going to
do<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.040> in<00:01:29.189> each<00:01:29.310> case<00:01:29.579> at<00:01:29.820> every<00:01:30.090> reflection

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
do is in each case at every reflection

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:32.090 
do is in each case at every reflection
we're<00:01:30.810> going<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.079> use<00:01:31.259> this<00:01:31.409> principle<00:01:31.979> right

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
we're going to use this principle right

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.550 
we're going to use this principle right
here<00:01:32.460> and<00:01:32.640> we're<00:01:33.090> going<00:01:33.329> to<00:01:33.360> always<00:01:33.750> draw<00:01:34.049> the

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
here and we're going to always draw the

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.789 
here and we're going to always draw the
normal<00:01:35.040> line<00:01:35.250> to<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.420> surface<00:01:37.350> where<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
normal line to the surface where the

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
normal line to the surface where the
reflection<00:01:38.280> occurs<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:38.790> here's<00:01:39.000> the<00:01:39.150> normal

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
reflection occurs so here's the normal

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.030 
reflection occurs so here's the normal
and<00:01:39.720> then<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.259> define<00:01:40.650> this<00:01:40.860> as<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:43.040> inbound

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
and then we define this as the inbound

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.639 
and then we define this as the inbound
ray<00:01:44.399> angle<00:01:44.880> or<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.210> incident<00:01:45.750> angle<00:01:46.049> and<00:01:46.259> I

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
ray angle or the incident angle and I

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:48.740 
ray angle or the incident angle and I
liked<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:47.040> I<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.460> to<00:01:47.490> name<00:01:47.880> them<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.329> number

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
liked it I like to name them or number

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.920 
liked it I like to name them or number
them<00:01:48.930> like<00:01:49.170> 1<00:01:49.470> 2<00:01:49.740> 3<00:01:50.009> 4<00:01:50.369> 5<00:01:50.549> 6<00:01:50.850> so<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.390> inbound

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
them like 1 2 3 4 5 6 so the inbound

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.740 
them like 1 2 3 4 5 6 so the inbound
angle<00:01:52.409> is<00:01:52.530> 1<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:53.070> exiting<00:01:53.549> angle<00:01:54.180> is<00:01:54.240> 2<00:01:54.420> and<00:01:54.600> so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
angle is 1 the exiting angle is 2 and so

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.920 
angle is 1 the exiting angle is 2 and so
forth<00:01:54.780> throughout<00:01:55.380> all<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.740> surfaces<00:01:56.840> so<00:01:57.840> of

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
forth throughout all the surfaces so of

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.569 
forth throughout all the surfaces so of
course<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.469> is<00:01:58.649> 60<00:01:58.950> degrees<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> this

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
course if this is 60 degrees and this

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:02.420 
course if this is 60 degrees and this
must<00:01:59.850> be<00:01:59.939> equal<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.360> 30<00:02:01.259> degrees<00:02:01.920> and<00:02:02.189> then

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
must be equal to 30 degrees and then

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.520 
must be equal to 30 degrees and then
it's<00:02:02.579> going<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> reflect<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:04.049> Rays<00:02:04.259> will

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
it's going to reflect the Rays will

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.069 
it's going to reflect the Rays will
reflect<00:02:04.920> to<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.159> direction<00:02:05.750> until<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.869> hits

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
reflect to this direction until it hits

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.559 
reflect to this direction until it hits
this<00:02:07.560> side<00:02:07.860> right<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.129> and<00:02:08.610> so<00:02:09.030> this<00:02:09.239> is<00:02:09.420> then

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
this side right here and so this is then

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.479 
this side right here and so this is then
the<00:02:09.599> reflected<00:02:10.200> angle<00:02:10.349> theta<00:02:10.739> sub<00:02:11.009> 2<00:02:11.220> and<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:11.489 
the reflected angle theta sub 2 and of

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.640 
the reflected angle theta sub 2 and of
course<00:02:11.730> data<00:02:11.940> subdue<00:02:12.330> must<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:12.720> equal<00:02:12.870> theta

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
course data subdue must also equal theta

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:18.199 
course data subdue must also equal theta
one<00:02:13.799> which<00:02:14.370> is<00:02:14.610> 30<00:02:15.269> degrees<00:02:17.060> okay<00:02:18.060> at<00:02:18.150> that

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
one which is 30 degrees okay at that

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.390 
one which is 30 degrees okay at that
point<00:02:18.599> since<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:19.200> hits<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.920> wall<00:02:20.099> right<00:02:20.340> here

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
point since it hits the wall right here

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.670 
point since it hits the wall right here
we're<00:02:20.879> going<00:02:21.060> to<00:02:21.150> draw<00:02:21.360> a<00:02:21.689> normal<00:02:22.049> line<00:02:22.439> over

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
we're going to draw a normal line over

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.770 
we're going to draw a normal line over
here<00:02:22.709> and<00:02:23.220> then<00:02:23.640> we<00:02:23.730> can<00:02:23.879> say<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.239> this<00:02:24.420> here

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:24.780 
here and then we can say that this here

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.229 
here and then we can say that this here
is<00:02:24.810> theta<00:02:25.230> sub<00:02:25.530> 3<00:02:25.890> and<00:02:26.129> then<00:02:26.610> this<00:02:26.760> ray<00:02:27.030> will

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
is theta sub 3 and then this ray will

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.839 
is theta sub 3 and then this ray will
reflect<00:02:27.540> in<00:02:28.079> this<00:02:28.349> direction<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:29.040> then<00:02:29.670> this

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
reflect in this direction and then this

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.940 
reflect in this direction and then this
angle<00:02:30.060> will<00:02:30.329> then<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.629> called<00:02:30.840> data<00:02:31.379> so<00:02:31.650> for

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
angle will then be called data so for

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.440 
angle will then be called data so for
and<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.159> course<00:02:32.400> because<00:02:33.030> of<00:02:33.180> the<00:02:33.239> reflection

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and of course because of the reflection

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.270 
and of course because of the reflection
we<00:02:33.870> know<00:02:33.989> that<00:02:34.200> theta<00:02:34.349> sub<00:02:34.650> 3<00:02:34.920> must<00:02:35.189> equal

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
we know that theta sub 3 must equal

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.910 
we know that theta sub 3 must equal
theta<00:02:35.760> sub<00:02:36.030> 4<00:02:36.269> the<00:02:36.629> question<00:02:37.049> is<00:02:37.170> how<00:02:37.349> big<00:02:37.650> is

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
theta sub 4 the question is how big is

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.670 
theta sub 4 the question is how big is
Stata<00:02:38.280> sub<00:02:38.549> 3<00:02:38.849> well<00:02:39.720> we<00:02:39.959> have<00:02:40.140> ourselves<00:02:40.290> a

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
Stata sub 3 well we have ourselves a

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.800 
Stata sub 3 well we have ourselves a
triangle<00:02:41.189> right<00:02:41.220> here<00:02:41.400> we<00:02:42.150> know<00:02:42.269> that<00:02:42.480> this<00:02:42.629> is

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
triangle right here we know that this is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:45.080 
triangle right here we know that this is
the<00:02:43.019> 30-degree<00:02:43.769> angle<00:02:43.799> this<00:02:44.280> is<00:02:44.459> 90<00:02:44.819> degree

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
the 30-degree angle this is 90 degree

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.110 
the 30-degree angle this is 90 degree
angle<00:02:45.390> so<00:02:45.510> this<00:02:45.900> therefore<00:02:46.109> must<00:02:46.470> be<00:02:46.590> a

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
angle so this therefore must be a

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.220 
angle so this therefore must be a
60-degree<00:02:48.120> angle<00:02:48.180> because<00:02:48.690> the<00:02:48.840> three<00:02:49.079> angles

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
60-degree angle because the three angles

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.589 
60-degree angle because the three angles
must<00:02:49.590> add<00:02:49.829> up<00:02:49.859> to<00:02:49.980> 180<00:02:50.430> degrees<00:02:50.879> so<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.359> being

00:02:51.589 --> 00:02:51.599 
must add up to 180 degrees so this being

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:53.809 
must add up to 180 degrees so this being
a<00:02:51.840> right<00:02:52.290> angle<00:02:52.650> this<00:02:52.859> in<00:02:53.069> there<00:02:53.310> therefore<00:02:53.700> is

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
a right angle this in there therefore is

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:56.360 
a right angle this in there therefore is
equal<00:02:53.879> to<00:02:54.150> 60<00:02:54.840> degrees<00:02:55.109> which<00:02:55.620> means<00:02:55.920> if<00:02:56.129> theta

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
equal to 60 degrees which means if theta

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 
equal to 60 degrees which means if theta
is<00:02:56.519> of<00:02:56.639> 360<00:02:57.269> degrees<00:02:57.569> then<00:02:57.989> theta<00:02:58.260> sub<00:02:58.560> four

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
is of 360 degrees then theta sub four

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.080 
is of 360 degrees then theta sub four
must<00:02:58.980> also<00:02:59.250> be<00:02:59.670> 60<00:03:00.480> degrees<00:03:00.510> now<00:03:01.670> this<00:03:02.670> is<00:03:02.879> the

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
must also be 60 degrees now this is the

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:05.899 
must also be 60 degrees now this is the
direction<00:03:03.750> of<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.170> light<00:03:04.739> and<00:03:05.040> so<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.639> this

00:03:05.899 --> 00:03:05.909 
direction of the light and so the this

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:08.030 
direction of the light and so the this
is<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.180> outbound<00:03:06.720> or<00:03:06.989> exit<00:03:07.439> rate<00:03:07.620> this<00:03:07.829> is<00:03:07.950> the

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:08.040 
is the outbound or exit rate this is the

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.460 
is the outbound or exit rate this is the
inbound<00:03:08.430> ray<00:03:08.670> what<00:03:09.569> is<00:03:09.599> the<00:03:09.870> angle<00:03:10.319> between

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
inbound ray what is the angle between

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.690 
inbound ray what is the angle between
those<00:03:10.889> two<00:03:11.030> well<00:03:12.030> let's<00:03:12.269> see<00:03:12.480> now<00:03:13.129> if<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.370> count

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
those two well let's see now if I count

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.819 
those two well let's see now if I count
this<00:03:15.180> angle<00:03:15.599> Plus<00:03:16.019> this<00:03:16.049> angle<00:03:16.439> Plus<00:03:16.799> this

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
this angle Plus this angle Plus this

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.539 
this angle Plus this angle Plus this
angle<00:03:17.040> Plus<00:03:17.549> this<00:03:17.579> angle<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:18.329> get<00:03:19.169> 30<00:03:19.530> plus<00:03:20.250> 30

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:20.549 
angle Plus this angle I get 30 plus 30

00:03:20.549 --> 00:03:24.860 
angle Plus this angle I get 30 plus 30
is<00:03:20.639> 60<00:03:21.090> plus<00:03:21.449> 60<00:03:21.480> is<00:03:21.930> 120<00:03:22.139> plus<00:03:22.980> 60<00:03:23.790> is<00:03:23.819> 180<00:03:24.329> so

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:24.870 
is 60 plus 60 is 120 plus 60 is 180 so

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.050 
is 60 plus 60 is 120 plus 60 is 180 so
that<00:03:24.959> means<00:03:25.169> that<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> Ray<00:03:25.919> made<00:03:26.190> a<00:03:26.220> 180

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
that means that the Ray made a 180

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:30.170 
that means that the Ray made a 180
degree<00:03:27.650> change<00:03:28.650> in<00:03:28.949> its<00:03:29.129> direction<00:03:29.340> which

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
degree change in its direction which

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.759 
degree change in its direction which
means<00:03:30.480> that<00:03:30.720> those<00:03:30.959> two<00:03:31.260> then<00:03:31.440> must<00:03:31.680> be

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
means that those two then must be

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.009 
means that those two then must be
parallel<00:03:32.340> to<00:03:32.370> each<00:03:32.549> other<00:03:32.730> so<00:03:33.030> therefore<00:03:33.510> the

00:03:34.009 --> 00:03:34.019 
parallel to each other so therefore the

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:37.960 
parallel to each other so therefore the
answer<00:03:34.290> is<00:03:34.409> they<00:03:34.620> are<00:03:34.849> parallel<00:03:35.849> and

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:37.970 
answer is they are parallel and

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.240 
answer is they are parallel and
therefore<00:03:38.970> the<00:03:39.599> angle<00:03:39.930> is<00:03:40.019> zero<00:03:40.199> degrees<00:03:40.949> or

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
therefore the angle is zero degrees or

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.550 
therefore the angle is zero degrees or
if<00:03:41.669> you<00:03:42.120> want<00:03:42.269> to<00:03:42.359> be<00:03:42.449> strictly<00:03:42.930> mathematical

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
if you want to be strictly mathematical

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.039 
if you want to be strictly mathematical
about<00:03:43.769> it<00:03:43.949> they<00:03:44.579> differ<00:03:44.909> by<00:03:45.150> 180<00:03:45.690> degrees

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
about it they differ by 180 degrees

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.750 
about it they differ by 180 degrees
because<00:03:46.560> one<00:03:46.739> is<00:03:46.889> inbound<00:03:47.250> the<00:03:47.370> other<00:03:47.489> one<00:03:47.609> is

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
because one is inbound the other one is

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.819 
because one is inbound the other one is
outbound<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:48.329> but<00:03:48.510> technically<00:03:49.049> speaking<00:03:49.109> you

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:49.829 
outbound so but technically speaking you

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:51.020 
outbound so but technically speaking you
could<00:03:50.010> say<00:03:50.190> that<00:03:50.430> you<00:03:50.609> know<00:03:50.699> the<00:03:50.940> angle

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
could say that you know the angle

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.750 
could say that you know the angle
between<00:03:51.299> the<00:03:51.599> two<00:03:51.750> rays<00:03:51.930> is<00:03:52.229> zero<00:03:52.799> degrees<00:03:53.190> all

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
between the two rays is zero degrees all

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.000 
between the two rays is zero degrees all
right<00:03:53.940> there's<00:03:54.419> a<00:03:54.510> simple<00:03:54.959> example<00:03:55.109> let's<00:03:55.799> do

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
right there's a simple example let's do

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.530 
right there's a simple example let's do
one<00:03:56.190> that's<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.459> little<00:03:56.639> bit<00:03:56.760> more<00:03:56.940> challenging

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
one that's a little bit more challenging
