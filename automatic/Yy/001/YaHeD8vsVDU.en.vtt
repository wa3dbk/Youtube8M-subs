imagine in a very basic way let's

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:50.490 
imagine in a very basic way let's
imagine<00:03:47.770> we<00:03:48.100> have<00:03:48.280> four<00:03:48.910> paragraphs<00:03:49.600> we<00:03:50.350> have

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
imagine we have four paragraphs we have

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.050 
imagine we have four paragraphs we have
our<00:03:50.650> introductory<00:03:51.100> paragraph<00:03:51.760> with<00:03:52.030> the

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:54.970 
thesis statement in this essay I'm going

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.530 
thesis statement in this essay I'm going
to<00:03:55.090> compare<00:03:55.480> and<00:03:55.630> contrast<00:03:56.730> the<00:03:57.730> pathology

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
to compare and contrast the pathology

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:00.600 
to compare and contrast the pathology
diagnosis<00:03:59.110> and<00:03:59.260> treatment<00:03:59.710> of<00:03:59.830> Crohn's

disease and inflammatory bowel disease

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.090 
disease and inflammatory bowel disease
okay<00:04:03.700> there's<00:04:04.240> a<00:04:04.330> thesis<00:04:04.510> there<00:04:04.870> and<00:04:05.170> then<00:04:05.980> we

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:06.100 
okay there's a thesis there and then we

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.060 
okay there's a thesis there and then we
have<00:04:06.130> the<00:04:06.520> first<00:04:06.850> block<00:04:07.330> we<00:04:07.780> have<00:04:08.290> pathology

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:09.070 
have the first block we have pathology

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:11.160 
have the first block we have pathology
diagnosis<00:04:09.610> treatment<00:04:10.090> and<00:04:10.240> we're<00:04:10.930> just

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
diagnosis treatment and we're just

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.920 
diagnosis treatment and we're just
talking<00:04:11.440> about<00:04:11.740> the<00:04:12.040> similarities<00:04:12.930> we're

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:13.930 
talking about the similarities we're

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:16.199 
talking about the similarities we're
comparing<00:04:14.380> the<00:04:14.620> similarities<00:04:15.310> how<00:04:15.550> all<00:04:15.850> three

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
comparing the similarities how all three

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:20.670 
comparing the similarities how all three
of<00:04:17.190> how<00:04:18.510> pathology<00:04:19.510> diagnosis<00:04:20.080> and<00:04:20.260> treatment

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
of how pathology diagnosis and treatment

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.190 
of how pathology diagnosis and treatment
is<00:04:20.799> that<00:04:21.100> is<00:04:21.609> similar<00:04:22.240> in<00:04:22.479> both<00:04:22.780> Crohn's

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
is that is similar in both Crohn's

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.070 
is that is similar in both Crohn's
disease<00:04:23.410> and<00:04:24.100> inflammatory<00:04:25.030> bowel<00:04:25.600> disease

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
disease and inflammatory bowel disease

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.320 
disease and inflammatory bowel disease
so<00:04:26.710> that<00:04:26.860> whole<00:04:27.070> first

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
so that whole first

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:33.330 
so that whole first
talks<00:04:28.990> about<00:04:29.110> the<00:04:29.350> similarities<00:04:30.270> and<00:04:31.380> then<00:04:32.380> in

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:33.340 
talks about the similarities and then in

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.620 
talks about the similarities and then in
the<00:04:33.730> next<00:04:34.030> block

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
the next block

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:36.750 
the next block
we<00:04:35.080> might<00:04:35.260> again<00:04:35.530> we're<00:04:35.920> going<00:04:36.040> to<00:04:36.100> maybe<00:04:36.430> want

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:36.760 
we might again we're going to maybe want

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.280 
we might again we're going to maybe want
to<00:04:36.820> talk<00:04:37.000> about<00:04:37.150> pathology<00:04:37.780> diagnosis

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:38.290 
to talk about pathology diagnosis

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:40.050 
to talk about pathology diagnosis
treatment<00:04:38.650> of<00:04:38.770> Crohn's<00:04:39.310> disease<00:04:39.460> and

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
treatment of Crohn's disease and

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.320 
treatment of Crohn's disease and
inflammatory<00:04:41.760> inflammatory<00:04:42.760> bowel<00:04:42.970> disease

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
inflammatory inflammatory bowel disease

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.840 
inflammatory inflammatory bowel disease
but<00:04:43.810> we're<00:04:43.990> only<00:04:44.200> talking<00:04:44.500> about<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:45.850 
but we're only talking about the

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.630 
but we're only talking about the
differences<00:04:46.660> now<00:04:46.870> so<00:04:47.860> these<00:04:48.040> blocks<00:04:48.340> are

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
differences now so these blocks are

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.360 
differences now so these blocks are
arranged<00:04:49.120> in<00:04:49.470> this<00:04:50.470> first<00:04:50.710> block<00:04:50.890> is<00:04:51.100> about

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.370 
arranged in this first block is about

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:54.180 
arranged in this first block is about
similarities<00:04:52.320> we<00:04:53.320> talked<00:04:53.500> about<00:04:53.650> all<00:04:53.890> the

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
similarities we talked about all the

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.840 
similarities we talked about all the
similarities<00:04:54.610> between<00:04:56.460> Crohn's<00:04:57.460> disease<00:04:57.580> and

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
similarities between Crohn's disease and

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.700 
similarities between Crohn's disease and
inflammatory<00:04:58.180> bowel<00:04:58.720> disease<00:04:59.140> or<00:04:59.410> at<00:04:59.500> least

00:04:59.700 --> 00:04:59.710 
inflammatory bowel disease or at least

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:02.490 
inflammatory bowel disease or at least
the<00:04:59.830> ones<00:05:00.010> we've<00:05:00.190> identified<00:05:01.500> similarities

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
the ones we've identified similarities

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.550 
the ones we've identified similarities
similar<00:05:02.770> similarities<00:05:03.520> and<00:05:03.820> then<00:05:04.540> in<00:05:05.080> the

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:05.560 
similar similarities and then in the

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.470 
similar similarities and then in the
next<00:05:05.890> block<00:05:06.160> we<00:05:06.550> talked<00:05:07.060> about<00:05:07.360> the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:07.480 
next block we talked about the

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:12.090 
next block we talked about the
differences<00:05:08.520> all<00:05:09.520> of<00:05:09.940> all<00:05:10.330> at<00:05:10.600> once<00:05:10.950> how<00:05:11.950> is

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:12.100 
differences all of all at once how is

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:15.000 
differences all of all at once how is
that<00:05:12.250> different<00:05:12.670> from<00:05:12.700> point<00:05:13.120> by<00:05:13.270> point<00:05:13.890> in<00:05:14.890> a

is<00:06:30.850> called<00:06:31.030> block<00:06:31.270> as<00:06:31.510> we<00:06:31.660> we've<00:06:32.260> grouped

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
is called block as we we've grouped

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:35.610 
is called block as we we've grouped
we've<00:06:34.300> determined<00:06:34.630> that<00:06:34.900> all<00:06:35.170> of<00:06:35.320> these<00:06:35.470> are

we've determined that all of these are

00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:39.270 
we've determined that all of these are
going<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.800> be<00:06:35.860> grouped<00:06:36.660> as<00:06:37.660> one<00:06:38.140> according<00:06:39.130> to

similarities all of these are going to

00:06:40.570 --> 00:06:41.370 
similarities all of these are going to
be<00:06:40.630> grouped

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
be grouped

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.560

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:45.570 
as one according to differences there is

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:49.010 
as one according to differences there is
so<00:06:46.570> there<00:06:46.750> is<00:06:46.840> a<00:06:46.870> general<00:06:47.380> introduction<00:06:47.980> to
