00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
part so I've written the whole thing

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.990 
part so I've written the whole thing
down<00:00:28.830> for<00:00:29.099> these<00:00:29.189> it<00:00:29.519> looks<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.789> about<00:00:29.880> four

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
down for these it looks like about four

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.089 
down for these it looks like about four
measures<00:00:30.570> and<00:00:30.750> I'm<00:00:31.470> just<00:00:31.590> going<00:00:31.710> to<00:00:31.740> teach<00:00:31.980> you

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
measures and I'm just going to teach you

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.220 
measures and I'm just going to teach you
that<00:00:32.219> little<00:00:32.489> groove<00:00:32.669> here<00:00:32.700> it<00:00:33.600> sounds<00:00:33.930> like

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
that little groove here it sounds like

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:47.119 
that little groove here it sounds like
this<00:00:34.410> when<00:00:34.649> it's<00:00:34.770> all<00:00:34.860> together<00:00:46.129> remember

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
this when it's all together remember

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.639 
this when it's all together remember
that<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.460> end<00:00:47.780> okay<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:48.840> we'll<00:00:49.559> start

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
that from the end okay so we'll start

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:01.260 
that from the end okay so we'll start
with<00:00:49.800> a<00:00:49.890> lick

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.340 

one<00:01:02.050> more<00:01:02.230> time<00:01:02.440> slowly

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
one more time slowly

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:13.720 
one more time slowly
you

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:13.730 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.800 

now<00:01:14.730> you<00:01:14.850> start<00:01:15.060> combining<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.540> with<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
now you start combining that with the

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:27.110 
now you start combining that with the
left<00:01:15.990> hand

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.370 

that's<00:01:28.120> how<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:28.240> would<00:01:28.420> practice<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.990> first

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
that's how I would practice the first

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:39.720 
that's how I would practice the first
half<00:01:29.710> of<00:01:29.800> the<00:01:29.920> first<00:01:30.040> measure

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:39.730 

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:49.380 

you

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.090 

and<00:01:50.390> the<00:01:50.510> second<00:01:50.960> part<00:01:51.110> is<00:01:51.560> where<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:51.920> groove

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
and the second part is where the groove

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.430 
and the second part is where the groove
starts<00:01:52.430> getting<00:01:52.700> interesting<00:01:53.140> it<00:01:54.140> doesn't

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
starts getting interesting it doesn't

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.320 
starts getting interesting it doesn't
play<00:01:54.560> on<00:01:54.590> the<00:01:54.800> downbeat<00:01:55.250> instead<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.120> left

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
play on the downbeat instead the left

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.270 
play on the downbeat instead the left
hand<00:01:56.600> comes<00:01:56.780> in<00:01:57.020> on<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.260> sixteenth<00:01:57.950> right

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
hand comes in on the sixteenth right

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.510 
hand comes in on the sixteenth right
after<00:01:58.820> the<00:01:58.940> downbeats<00:01:59.390> of<00:01:59.660> the<00:02:00.100> if<00:02:01.100> the<00:02:01.310> beats

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
after the downbeats of the if the beats

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:12.010 
after the downbeats of the if the beats
are<00:02:01.700> here<00:02:09.910> put<00:02:10.910> that<00:02:10.940> with<00:02:11.360> the<00:02:11.390> other<00:02:11.600> measure

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
are here put that with the other measure

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:28.229 
are here put that with the other measure
it<00:02:12.230> helps<00:02:12.560> to<00:02:12.710> kind<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.920> get<00:02:13.070> into<00:02:13.190> it

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:30.610 

and<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.329> would<00:02:29.480> really<00:02:29.629> work<00:02:29.870> this<00:02:30.079> both<00:02:30.349> hands

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
and I would really work this both hands

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.229 
and I would really work this both hands
together<00:02:30.799> all<00:02:31.099> the<00:02:31.220> time<00:02:31.400> you<00:02:31.549> can<00:02:31.670> learn<00:02:31.790> one

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
together all the time you can learn one

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.610 
together all the time you can learn one
hand<00:02:32.450> at<00:02:32.540> a<00:02:32.599> time<00:02:32.810> it's<00:02:33.049> not<00:02:33.140> going<00:02:33.319> to<00:02:33.379> help

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
hand at a time it's not going to help

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.369 
hand at a time it's not going to help
you<00:02:33.829> so<00:02:34.610> it<00:02:34.939> starts<00:02:35.360> with<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.540> offbeat<00:02:36.140> in<00:02:36.260> the

00:02:36.369 --> 00:02:36.379 
you so it starts with the offbeat in the

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:37.569 
you so it starts with the offbeat in the
left<00:02:36.590> hand<00:02:36.829> and<00:02:36.950> you're<00:02:37.069> literally<00:02:37.370> going

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
left hand and you're literally going

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:42.550 
left hand and you're literally going
back<00:02:37.849> and<00:02:38.060> forth

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.040 

you

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.080 

and<00:02:47.560> it<00:02:47.680> sounds<00:02:47.950> funny<00:02:48.130> at<00:02:48.280> a<00:02:48.340> slow<00:02:48.550> tempo<00:02:48.700> but

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
and it sounds funny at a slow tempo but

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.760 
and it sounds funny at a slow tempo but
these<00:02:49.210> left<00:02:49.450> hand<00:02:49.720> years<00:02:50.050> are<00:02:50.320> really<00:02:50.590> just

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
these left hand years are really just

00:02:50.770 --> 00:03:06.890 
these left hand years are really just
ghost<00:02:51.130> notes

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.700 

that<00:03:07.900> was<00:03:07.990> something<00:03:08.200> Grayson<00:03:08.470> up<00:03:08.560> there<00:03:08.680> I

Gray Ghost of note on this e you kind of

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:27.470 
Gray Ghost of note on this e you kind of
do<00:03:26.950> this

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
do this

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:35.870 
do this
that's<00:03:28.480> our<00:03:28.660> East<00:03:29.230> seven<00:03:29.650> sharp<00:03:29.920> nine<00:03:30.160> chord

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.970 

that<00:03:36.880> chord<00:03:37.390> is<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:38.410> makeup<00:03:38.710> of<00:03:38.860> these

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:38.980 
that chord is the makeup of these

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:53.920 
that chord is the makeup of these
ghosting<00:03:39.490> things

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.760 

and<00:03:54.930> then<00:03:55.020> when<00:03:55.110> you<00:03:55.200> take<00:03:55.320> the<00:03:55.380> second<00:03:55.740> half

00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:55.770 
and then when you take the second half

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:57.740 
and then when you take the second half
of<00:03:55.890> that<00:03:55.950> measure<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:56.790> just<00:03:56.970> leading<00:03:57.450> into

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
of that measure it's just leading into

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:13.410 
of that measure it's just leading into
the<00:03:57.840> lake<00:03:57.990> again

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420
