00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 Y 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.820
 the whistle has several characteristics 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:13.040
 the most important thing is that we can give the 

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:15.559
 order the dog always in the same tone 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.329
 as well as with the voice we are going to change the 

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:19.520
 tone or the whistle to our own 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.560
 we will also never be able to 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.939
 make them equal with those batos and with what 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.460
 which we have the guarantee that this does not 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.779
 we will understand perfectly there 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.189
 people that tell me good that the whistles 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.340
 and you all the more to call the dog 

00:00:28.189 --> 00:00:32.570
 it's not the vote it 's a pattern for everything 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.970
 that you want for all orders that 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.670
 you have given you can adapt it is 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:41.350
 to change either your tone or your 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.350
 pauses so that you understand me for example 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.940
 I use this in ring tone 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.700
 and it was used in the form of directly 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.380
 that can already leave is already released not 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.820
 have no order 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:01:01.460
 these dry eyes made us so that the 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.460
 dog turn to order what he likes 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.640
 that he used during what he did as 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.640
 a fifth distance distance earth 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:18.939
 I use it food is a long tone with 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:22.450
 a pib behind he used it as a go 

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:24.729
 here we go 

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.490
 every time we play in a way 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:29.289
 different from other the whistle those forms 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:30.360
 they can use them as orders 

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:33.670
 different 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.229
 I personally give orders 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.939
 about the dog just make the dog 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.030
 I understand the orders so much in one way 

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:41.740
 verbal as with the whistle why then 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.390
 because if someone ever forgets us 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.520
 the whistle or if we do not have it at hand 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.079
 be able to make the tournament about the k by 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.259
 the verbal command me for example 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:53.799
 taught the dog that here means 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:55.720
 veins so much I am then and would say 

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:57.549
 receiving the dog according and 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:00.009
 final ideas removing the verbal command 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:03.680
 to use nothing more the command in 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:06.470
 this case of the serial whistle 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.920
 and the dog would understand perfectly that 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.270
 here 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:13.520
 ipic means the same 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.390
 one of the advantages of the whistle 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:21.170
 is that it does not scare the hunt as well as 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.640
 with a joke of 8 or from here or tour or 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:24.950
 any command we give in the bush 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.410
 hunting the predictions applied with 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.910
 the hole hares are going to identify her 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.410
 as a human 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.200
 we have observed many times in sides 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.630
 of waste that alirio whistle like 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:38.330
 a maximum locations get to embrace a 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.780
 little to immediately continue with what 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.780
 They were doing
