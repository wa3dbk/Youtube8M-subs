it's the sort of thing you would find in
perhaps<00:05:18.210> the<00:05:18.419> bathroom<00:05:18.900> or<00:05:19.229> it's<00:05:19.440> obviously<00:05:19.979> a

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:20.070 
perhaps the bathroom or it's obviously a

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:22.700 
perhaps the bathroom or it's obviously a
home<00:05:20.250> product<00:05:20.760> it<00:05:21.270> could<00:05:21.479> be<00:05:21.570> some<00:05:21.810> new<00:05:22.440> type

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:22.710
