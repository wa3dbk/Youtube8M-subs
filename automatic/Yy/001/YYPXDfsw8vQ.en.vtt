eyes<00:02:00.540> so<00:02:00.930> that<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.860> glue<00:02:02.310> has<00:02:02.520> time<00:02:02.760> to<00:02:02.940> dry

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
eyes so that that glue has time to dry

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.170 
eyes so that that glue has time to dry
while<00:02:03.630> she's<00:02:03.840> not<00:02:03.990> moving
