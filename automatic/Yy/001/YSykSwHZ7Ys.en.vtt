00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
the purple custom x 156 I've been

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.290 
the purple custom x 156 I've been
writing<00:00:35.280> that<00:00:35.550> for<00:00:36.030> like<00:00:36.410> five<00:00:37.410> years<00:00:37.440> already

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:38.300 
writing that for like five years already

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.280 
writing that for like five years already
it's<00:00:39.300> for<00:00:39.450> my<00:00:39.510> favorite<00:00:40.170> boards<00:00:40.610> but<00:00:42.290> it's

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
it's for my favorite boards but it's

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.430 
it's for my favorite boards but it's
pretty<00:00:43.469> stiff<00:00:43.920> it's<00:00:44.219> really<00:00:44.989> responsive<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
pretty stiff it's really responsive and

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.990 
pretty stiff it's really responsive and
then<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.520> just<00:00:47.789> a<00:00:47.969> normal<00:00:48.180> camber<00:00:48.750> board

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:50.000 
then it's just a normal camber board

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.540 
then it's just a normal camber board
that's<00:00:51.000> why<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.149> like<00:00:51.300> it<00:00:51.690> it's<00:00:51.870> a

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
that's why I like it it's a

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.310 
that's why I like it it's a
high-performance<00:00:53.550> book<00:00:53.820> and<00:00:54.180> it's<00:00:54.930> got<00:00:55.079> a<00:00:55.110> lot

performance board who want to give them

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:57.090 
performance board who want to give them
added<00:01:54.670> pressure<00:01:55.030> on<00:01:55.240> your<00:01:55.480> edges<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.080> kind<00:01:56.979> of

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 
added pressure on your edges and kind of

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.390 
added pressure on your edges and kind of
feel<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.810> carving<00:01:58.810> style<00:01:59.200> I<00:01:59.530> think<00:02:00.160> that's

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
feel the carving style I think that's

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.270 
feel the carving style I think that's
that's<00:02:00.940> the<00:02:01.390> what's<00:02:01.930> the<00:02:02.110> custom<00:02:02.590> x<00:02:02.770> is<00:02:02.979> about

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
that's the what's the custom x is about

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.880 
that's the what's the custom x is about
it's<00:02:03.580> uh<00:02:03.790> it's<00:02:04.030> got<00:02:04.630> a<00:02:04.660> lot<00:02:04.900> of<00:02:04.960> power<00:02:05.410> and<00:02:05.770> if

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
it's uh it's got a lot of power and if

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.460 
it's uh it's got a lot of power and if
you<00:02:06.040> can<00:02:06.250> use<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.390> power<00:02:07.570> to<00:02:07.720> the<00:02:07.960> board<00:02:08.229> it's

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:08.470 
you can use that power to the board it's

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.650 
you can use that power to the board it's
so<00:02:08.709> much<00:02:08.890> fun<00:02:09.750> you<00:02:10.750> mean<00:02:10.929> the<00:02:11.080> Euro<00:02:11.290> carving
