maybe<00:01:39.220> not<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:43.360> this<00:01:43.810> scene<00:01:44.080> nathan<00:01:44.470> drake

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
maybe not in this scene nathan drake

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.840 
maybe not in this scene nathan drake
says<00:01:46.470> it<00:01:47.470> means<00:01:47.770> be<00:01:48.130> careful<00:01:48.340> what<00:01:48.700> you<00:01:48.820> wish

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:48.850 
says it means be careful what you wish

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.830 
says it means be careful what you wish
for<00:01:49.799> it<00:01:50.799> might<00:01:51.100> just<00:01:51.250> get<00:01:51.490> you<00:01:51.700> which<00:01:52.600> could

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
for it might just get you which could

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.420 
for it might just get you which could
just<00:01:53.020> be<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.170> play<00:01:53.380> on<00:01:53.530> the<00:01:53.560> clever<00:01:53.799> phrase<00:01:54.100> but

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
just be a play on the clever phrase but

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.490 
just be a play on the clever phrase but
I<00:01:54.490> think<00:01:54.790> it<00:01:54.880> could<00:01:54.970> also<00:01:55.150> mean<00:01:55.360> possibly<00:01:55.750> that

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
I think it could also mean possibly that

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:57.929 
I think it could also mean possibly that
was<00:01:56.650> searching<00:01:57.100> for<00:01:57.130> at<00:01:57.310> some<00:01:57.520> point<00:01:57.759> of<00:01:57.880> the

00:01:57.929 --> 00:01:57.939 
was searching for at some point of the

00:01:57.939 --> 00:01:59.969 
was searching for at some point of the
game<00:01:57.970> isn't<00:01:58.299> an<00:01:58.479> object<00:01:58.900> but<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.350> person<00:01:59.650> or

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
game isn't an object but a person or

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:01.590 
game isn't an object but a person or
animal<00:02:00.130> which<00:02:00.640> is<00:02:00.820> probably<00:02:01.030> too<00:02:01.270> much<00:02:01.450> for

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:01.600 
animal which is probably too much for

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.960 
animal which is probably too much for
him<00:02:01.689> to<00:02:01.780> handle<00:02:01.810> as<00:02:02.320> a<00:02:02.920> side<00:02:03.280> note<00:02:03.310> is<00:02:03.670> also

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:03.970 
him to handle as a side note is also

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.370 
him to handle as a side note is also
good<00:02:04.119> to<00:02:04.150> see<00:02:04.270> that<00:02:04.420> Nathan<00:02:04.840> Jake<00:02:05.020> is<00:02:05.170> still

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:05.380 
good to see that Nathan Jake is still

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.859 
good to see that Nathan Jake is still

here<00:02:11.750> we<00:02:11.900> go

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.890 

now<00:02:20.580> here<00:02:20.790> we<00:02:20.910> see<00:02:21.090> some<00:02:21.300> brief<00:02:21.510> bits<00:02:21.750> of

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
now here we see some brief bits of

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.500 
now here we see some brief bits of
gameplay<00:02:22.320> one<00:02:22.950> is<00:02:23.070> in<00:02:23.190> a<00:02:23.250> city<00:02:23.520> which<00:02:23.850> could<00:02:24.360> be

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
gameplay one is in a city which could be

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.120 
gameplay one is in a city which could be
anywhere<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.110> if<00:02:25.290> we<00:02:25.410> go<00:02:25.560> for<00:02:25.770> the<00:02:25.860> fact<00:02:26.100> that

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
anywhere but if we go for the fact that

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:27.500 
anywhere but if we go for the fact that
some<00:02:26.370> of<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.520> takes<00:02:26.700> place<00:02:26.820> in<00:02:26.910> England<00:02:27.390> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
some of it takes place in England it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.810 
some of it takes place in England it
could<00:02:27.690> be<00:02:27.810> there<00:02:28.020> now<00:02:28.980> here<00:02:29.220> we<00:02:29.340> see<00:02:29.520> Nathan

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
could be there now here we see Nathan

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.640 
could be there now here we see Nathan
Drake<00:02:30.030> running<00:02:30.360> away<00:02:30.570> from<00:02:30.630> some<00:02:31.020> water<00:02:31.260> in<00:02:31.530> an

Drake running away from some water in an

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:34.580 
Drake running away from some water in an
unspecified<00:02:32.100> location<00:02:32.460> it<00:02:33.450> looks<00:02:33.870> like<00:02:34.380> it's

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
unspecified location it looks like it's

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:37.700 
unspecified location it looks like it's
actually<00:02:35.040> on<00:02:35.220> its<00:02:35.370> side<00:02:35.790> or<00:02:36.180> upside<00:02:36.690> down<00:02:37.320> and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
actually on its side or upside down and

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.680 
actually on its side or upside down and
with<00:02:38.130> the<00:02:38.310> light<00:02:38.520> there<00:02:38.790> being<00:02:39.030> on<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.330> floor

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
with the light there being on the floor

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.780 
with the light there being on the floor
I<00:02:39.930> would<00:02:40.380> say<00:02:40.680> that<00:02:40.860> it's<00:02:40.980> a<00:02:41.070> train<00:02:41.400> but<00:02:41.730> i

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
I would say that it's a train but i

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:43.640 
I would say that it's a train but i
doubt<00:02:41.940> that<00:02:42.180> no<00:02:42.570> still<00:02:42.840> going<00:02:43.110> to<00:02:43.260> repeat<00:02:43.590> that

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
doubt that no still going to repeat that

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.250 
doubt that no still going to repeat that
and<00:02:44.040> it's<00:02:44.670> clearly<00:02:45.090> not<00:02:45.240> in<00:02:45.510> the<00:02:45.720> plane<00:02:45.990> that

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
and it's clearly not in the plane that

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.620 
and it's clearly not in the plane that
we<00:02:46.470> saw<00:02:46.860> earlier<00:02:47.160> and<00:02:47.790> i<00:02:48.000> doubt<00:02:48.060> uncharted

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
we saw earlier and i doubt uncharted

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.360 
we saw earlier and i doubt uncharted
freeze<00:02:48.840> gonna<00:02:49.050> have<00:02:49.200> two<00:02:49.380> plane<00:02:49.680> crashes<00:02:50.130> so

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
freeze gonna have two plane crashes so

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.620 
freeze gonna have two plane crashes so
i'm<00:02:50.700> going<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:50.910> go<00:02:50.970> ahead<00:02:51.060> and<00:02:51.300> say<00:02:51.420> this<00:02:51.480> is

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
i'm going to go ahead and say this is

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.630 
i'm going to go ahead and say this is
probably<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:52.020> a<00:02:52.050> boat<00:02:52.320> that<00:02:52.770> you<00:02:53.130> know<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:53.640 
probably on a boat that you know the

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.190 
probably on a boat that you know the
water<00:02:53.910> can't<00:02:54.300> live<00:02:54.420> is<00:02:54.510> a<00:02:54.540> giveaway<00:02:54.840> for<00:02:54.959> that

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
water can't live is a giveaway for that

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.900 
water can't live is a giveaway for that
I<00:02:55.230> suppose<00:02:55.680> now<00:02:56.130> here<00:02:56.310> we<00:02:56.400> see<00:02:56.520> Drake<00:02:56.730> and

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
I suppose now here we see Drake and

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:58.729 
I suppose now here we see Drake and
Sully<00:02:57.090> using<00:02:57.540> teamwork<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.080> blast<00:02:58.350> open<00:02:58.530> a

00:02:58.729 --> 00:02:58.739 
Sully using teamwork to blast open a

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:00.740 
Sully using teamwork to blast open a
door<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.160> what<00:02:59.280> looks<00:02:59.489> like<00:02:59.580> a<00:02:59.700> hotel<00:02:59.940> on<00:03:00.239> fire

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
door to what looks like a hotel on fire

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:01.910 
door to what looks like a hotel on fire
now<00:03:01.200> I'm<00:03:01.260> not<00:03:01.380> sure<00:03:01.530> if<00:03:01.590> this<00:03:01.680> has<00:03:01.830> been

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
now I'm not sure if this has been

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.680 
now I'm not sure if this has been
confirmed<00:03:02.100> or<00:03:02.520> not<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:02.970> me<00:03:03.120> this<00:03:03.330> looks<00:03:03.390> a

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 
confirmed or not but to me this looks a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.900 
confirmed or not but to me this looks a
lot<00:03:03.870> like<00:03:04.050> a<00:03:04.110> co-op<00:03:04.650> campaign<00:03:04.860> or<00:03:05.459> maybe

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
lot like a co-op campaign or maybe

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.790 
lot like a co-op campaign or maybe
that's<00:03:06.090> just<00:03:06.300> wishful<00:03:06.510> thinking<00:03:07.200> then

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:07.800 
that's just wishful thinking then

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.530 
that's just wishful thinking then
there's<00:03:08.070> a<00:03:08.130> brief<00:03:08.370> bit<00:03:08.550> of<00:03:08.580> Drake<00:03:08.910> shooting<00:03:09.420> in

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
there's a brief bit of Drake shooting in

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.510 
there's a brief bit of Drake shooting in
what<00:03:09.989> could<00:03:10.200> be<00:03:10.260> a<00:03:10.440> harbor<00:03:10.890> but<00:03:11.070> that's<00:03:11.220> only<00:03:11.370> a

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:11.520 
what could be a harbor but that's only a

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.570 
what could be a harbor but that's only a
guess<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:12.620> finally<00:03:13.620> there's<00:03:14.070> a<00:03:14.160> release<00:03:14.550> date

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
guess and finally there's a release date

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.550 
guess and finally there's a release date
the<00:03:14.940> first<00:03:15.209> of<00:03:15.420> november<00:03:15.959> two<00:03:16.200> thousand

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
the first of november two thousand

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.380 
the first of november two thousand
eleven<00:03:16.620> well<00:03:17.370> thanks<00:03:17.730> for<00:03:17.760> listening<00:03:18.150> if<00:03:18.300> you

eleven well thanks for listening if you

eleven well thanks for listening if you
want<00:03:18.570> to<00:03:18.690> see<00:03:18.840> that<00:03:19.050> trailer<00:03:19.500> over<00:03:19.830> in<00:03:19.920> high

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
want to see that trailer over in high

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:21.770 
want to see that trailer over in high
definition<00:03:20.340> you'll<00:03:21.180> probably<00:03:21.360> do<00:03:21.540> that<00:03:21.660> on

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
definition you'll probably do that on

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.970 
definition you'll probably do that on
