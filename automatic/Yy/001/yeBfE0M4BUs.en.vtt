so let's choose next let's go into my
Wi-Fi

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.910 

okay<00:02:23.260> here<00:02:23.440> we<00:02:23.560> go<00:02:23.590> it's<00:02:24.190> connecting<00:02:25.920> fairly

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:26.920 
okay here we go it's connecting fairly

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:28.110 
okay here we go it's connecting fairly
simple<00:02:27.340> it<00:02:27.430> just<00:02:27.580> takes<00:02:27.760> a<00:02:27.820> little<00:02:27.910> bit<00:02:28.030> of

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
simple it just takes a little bit of

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:35.750 
simple it just takes a little bit of
time

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.170 

okay<00:02:36.690> this<00:02:37.080> SIM<00:02:37.379> card<00:02:37.650> is<00:02:37.800> missing<00:02:38.099> skips<00:02:38.940> I

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
okay this SIM card is missing skips I

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.030 
okay this SIM card is missing skips I
took<00:02:39.330> the<00:02:39.420> SIM<00:02:39.599> card<00:02:39.629> out<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.260> was<00:02:40.830> trying

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
took the SIM card out I was trying

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.570 
took the SIM card out I was trying
something<00:02:41.220> I<00:02:41.489> don't<00:02:41.640> know<00:02:42.140> we'll<00:02:43.140> see<00:02:43.580> you

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
something I don't know we'll see you

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:45.890 
something I don't know we'll see you
shouldn't<00:02:44.790> have<00:02:45.030> the<00:02:45.090> SIM<00:02:45.239> card<00:02:45.269> missing<00:02:45.720> some

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
shouldn't have the SIM card missing some

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:46.940 
shouldn't have the SIM card missing some
parts<00:02:46.019> should<00:02:46.200> be<00:02:46.230> there<00:02:46.470> but<00:02:46.620> I<00:02:46.709> think<00:02:46.769> that's

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
parts should be there but I think that's

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.119 
parts should be there but I think that's
probably<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.580> issues<00:02:48.709> SIM<00:02:49.709> card<00:02:49.950> has

00:02:50.119 --> 00:02:50.129 
probably one of the issues SIM card has

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:53.140 
probably one of the issues SIM card has
not<00:02:50.220> been<00:02:50.459> detected<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.450> your<00:02:51.569> phone

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
not been detected and your phone

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.789 
not been detected and your phone
so<00:02:54.150> anyways<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.260> lookout<00:02:55.530> for<00:02:55.590> the

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
so anyways be on the lookout for the

00:02:55.799 --> 00:02:57.050 
so anyways be on the lookout for the
review<00:02:56.129> I'm<00:02:56.220> gonna<00:02:56.370> try<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.580> figure<00:02:56.730> out<00:02:56.849> why

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
review I'm gonna try to figure out why
