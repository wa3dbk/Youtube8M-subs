it<00:03:41.160> on<00:03:41.300> h.264<00:03:42.300> it<00:03:42.450> doesn't<00:03:42.750> really<00:03:42.840> matter<00:03:43.050> I

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
it on h.264 it doesn't really matter I

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.130 
it on h.264 it doesn't really matter I
find<00:03:44.310> that<00:03:44.400> encoding<00:03:45.090> it<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.240> mpeg-4<00:03:45.570> works

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140 
find that encoding it with mpeg-4 works

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.450 
find that encoding it with mpeg-4 works
a<00:03:46.230> little<00:03:46.500> bit<00:03:46.680> faster<00:03:47.130> but<00:03:47.250> it's<00:03:47.370> not

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
a little bit faster but it's not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.620 
a little bit faster but it's not
something<00:03:47.640> you<00:03:47.820> really<00:03:47.850> need<00:03:48.180> to<00:03:48.330> work<00:03:48.510> a

worry about and you can also choose your
frame<00:03:51.210> rates<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.660> can<00:03:51.810> leave<00:03:51.960> that<00:03:51.990> alone<00:03:52.200> too

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
frame rates you can leave that alone too

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.220 
frame rates you can leave that alone too

suggest putting it all the way up you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.680 
suggest putting it all the way up you
can<00:03:59.040> also<00:03:59.190> choose<00:03:59.490> your<00:03:59.670> bitrate<00:04:00.000> and<00:04:00.270> target

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
can also choose your bitrate and target

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:03.470 
can also choose your bitrate and target
size<00:04:00.900> megabytes<00:04:01.850> those<00:04:02.850> aren't<00:04:03.300> really

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
size megabytes those aren't really

something<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.990> need<00:04:04.020> to<00:04:04.170> play<00:04:04.320> with

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
something you really need to play with

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:06.370 
something you really need to play with
either<00:04:04.590> and<00:04:05.100> down<00:04:05.550> here<00:04:05.700> it<00:04:05.790> just<00:04:05.820> tells<00:04:06.150> you

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
either and down here it just tells you

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:09.110 
either and down here it just tells you
what<00:04:07.380> your<00:04:07.530> picture<00:04:07.890> size<00:04:08.220> sources<00:04:08.910> and<00:04:09.090> the

what your picture size sources and the
output<00:04:09.870> and<00:04:10.020> resolution<00:04:10.560> so<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.640> 720<00:04:12.090> x<00:04:12.240> 480

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
output and resolution so it's 720 x 480

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:16.640 
output and resolution so it's 720 x 480
and<00:04:13.200> i'll<00:04:13.320> put<00:04:13.560> a<00:04:13.590> 720<00:04:14.070> x<00:04:14.160> 480<00:04:15.140> and<00:04:16.140> up<00:04:16.320> here<00:04:16.530> you

and i'll put a 720 x 480 and up here you

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.180 
and i'll put a 720 x 480 and up here you

going to actually finish encoding the

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.490 
going to actually finish encoding the

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
happens when you start it because i

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:05.180

so it says encoding here and it doesn't
in<00:05:08.340> one<00:05:08.550> pass<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.150> can<00:05:09.300> choose<00:05:09.540> to<00:05:09.570> pass<00:05:09.990> right

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
in one pass you can choose to pass right

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:12.410 
in one pass you can choose to pass right
here<00:05:10.680> and<00:05:10.980> it<00:05:11.760> tells<00:05:11.940> you<00:05:12.060> how<00:05:12.180> long<00:05:12.210> it's

here and it tells you how long it's
going<00:05:12.540> to<00:05:12.600> take<00:05:12.660> now<00:05:12.990> that<00:05:13.140> says<00:05:13.350> this<00:05:13.470> is

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590 
going to take now that says this is

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:15.260 
going to take now that says this is
going<00:05:13.770> to<00:05:13.860> take<00:05:14.040> three<00:05:14.340> hours<00:05:14.460> and<00:05:14.790> 22<00:05:15.240> minutes

to complete and it's actually going down
quite<00:05:17.880> fast<00:05:18.090> but<00:05:18.440> so<00:05:19.440> this<00:05:19.710> is<00:05:19.860> going<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.100> take

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
quite fast but so this is going to take

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.280 
quite fast but so this is going to take
a<00:05:20.340> while<00:05:20.430> it's<00:05:20.910> not<00:05:21.120> even<00:05:21.420> you<00:05:21.750> know<00:05:21.780> Oh<00:05:22.050> point

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
a while it's not even you know Oh point

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.370 
a while it's not even you know Oh point
fifteen<00:05:22.650> percent<00:05:23.550> through<00:05:23.850> it<00:05:23.970> so<00:05:24.600> you<00:05:25.260> know

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
fifteen percent through it so you know

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:27.320 
fifteen percent through it so you know
go<00:05:26.160> do<00:05:26.340> something<00:05:26.640> else<00:05:26.730> while<00:05:27.000> this<00:05:27.150> is

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:27.330 
go do something else while this is

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.360 
go do something else while this is
working<00:05:27.690> because<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.620> will<00:05:28.800> take<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.010> while<00:05:29.160> now

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:29.370 
working because it will take a while now

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:30.590 
working because it will take a while now

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
user you really don't have to worry

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.260 
user you really don't have to worry
about<00:06:21.630> there<00:06:22.320> are<00:06:22.530> nothing<00:06:22.890> too<00:06:23.100> complex<00:06:23.850> or

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270 
about there are nothing too complex or

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.840 
about there are nothing too complex or
they're<00:06:24.540> pretty<00:06:24.720> complex<00:06:25.050> so<00:06:25.560> you<00:06:26.520> probably

00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:26.850 
they're pretty complex so you probably

00:06:26.850 --> 00:06:28.610 
they're pretty complex so you probably
don't<00:06:27.270> want<00:06:27.390> to<00:06:27.450> use<00:06:27.510> them<00:06:27.750> unless<00:06:27.810> you<00:06:28.230> really

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:28.620 
don't want to use them unless you really

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:31.280 
don't want to use them unless you really
feel<00:06:28.950> like<00:06:28.980> you<00:06:29.280> need<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.570> they're<00:06:30.570> somewhat

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
feel like you need to they're somewhat

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.250 
feel like you need to they're somewhat
confusing<00:06:31.980> and<00:06:32.280> you<00:06:32.780> generally<00:06:33.780> won't<00:06:34.020> need

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:34.260 
confusing and you generally won't need

00:06:34.260 --> 00:06:35.750 
confusing and you generally won't need
to<00:06:34.290> use<00:06:34.380> them<00:06:34.650> so<00:06:35.130> i'm<00:06:35.190> just<00:06:35.250> going<00:06:35.490> to<00:06:35.550> hit

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:35.760 
to use them so i'm just going to hit

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:38.420 
to use them so i'm just going to hit
start<00:06:36.060> and<00:06:36.440> this<00:06:37.440> is<00:06:37.590> about<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.800> six<00:06:38.220> minute

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
start and this is about a six minute

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.770 
start and this is about a six minute
video<00:06:38.640> so<00:06:39.630> it's

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:40.780 
video so it's

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.010 
video so it's
to<00:06:41.850> encode<00:06:42.850> it<00:06:43.000> right<00:06:43.150> now<00:06:43.330> and<00:06:43.570> this<00:06:43.690> is<00:06:43.750> going

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:44.020 
to encode it right now and this is going

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.129 
to encode it right now and this is going
to<00:06:44.139> take<00:06:44.290> about<00:06:45.070> 23<00:06:45.670> minutes<00:06:45.850> it's<00:06:46.180> saying<00:06:46.389> so

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:47.139 
to take about 23 minutes it's saying so

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:49.290 
to take about 23 minutes it's saying so
I<00:06:47.560> will<00:06:47.889> come<00:06:48.460> back<00:06:48.580> when<00:06:48.760> it's<00:06:48.820> done<00:06:49.030> and<00:06:49.210> i'll

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:49.300 
I will come back when it's done and i'll

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:52.320 
I will come back when it's done and i'll
show<00:06:49.330> you<00:06:49.570> the<00:06:49.690> quality<00:06:50.580> so<00:06:51.580> i<00:06:51.610> finished

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:52.330 
show you the quality so i finished

00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.440 
show you the quality so i finished
encoding<00:06:52.720> the<00:06:52.930> file<00:06:53.230> and<00:06:53.500> it<00:06:54.040> exports<00:06:55.030> in<00:06:55.210> a

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:55.450 
encoding the file and it exports in a

00:06:55.450 --> 00:06:59.490 
encoding the file and it exports in a
dot<00:06:56.169> m4v<00:06:56.860> file<00:06:57.550> format<00:06:58.030> instead<00:06:58.419> of<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.930> demo

00:06:59.490 --> 00:06:59.500 
dot m4v file format instead of the demo

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.680 
dot m4v file format instead of the demo
via<00:06:59.710> was<00:07:00.010> in<00:07:00.250> now<00:07:00.850> I'm<00:07:00.940> just<00:07:01.060> going<00:07:01.300> to<00:07:01.330> compare

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:01.690 
via was in now I'm just going to compare

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.600 
via was in now I'm just going to compare
the<00:07:01.840> quality<00:07:01.930> to<00:07:02.290> show<00:07:02.440> you<00:07:02.500> that<00:07:02.889> this<00:07:03.370> does

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:03.610 
the quality to show you that this does
