00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
a gain of three yard and that's why you

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.080 
a gain of three yard and that's why you
send<00:01:18.049> all<00:01:18.259> those<00:01:18.439> guys<00:01:18.799> to<00:01:19.280> plug<00:01:19.579> up<00:01:19.610> the<00:01:19.909> holes

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:23.060 
and that time there were no holes really

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.850 
and that time there were no holes really
and<00:01:23.240> he<00:01:23.630> was<00:01:23.750> likely<00:01:24.049> to<00:01:24.170> get<00:01:24.259> anything<00:01:24.530> on<00:01:24.770> the

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:24.860 
and he was likely to get anything on the

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:33.669 
and he was likely to get anything on the
play<00:01:30.549> tackle<00:01:31.549> around<00:01:32.119> the<00:01:32.270> 28<00:01:32.600> yard<00:01:32.960> line<00:01:33.079> they

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
gained five yards there and so it will

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.240 
gained five yards there and so it will
be<00:01:35.869> third<00:01:36.289> down<00:01:38.349> the<00:01:39.349> offense<00:01:39.740> needs<00:01:39.979> about

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
line that was just going to take control

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.260 
line that was just going to take control
of<00:02:02.010> that<00:02:02.280> situation<00:02:04.880> looks<00:02:05.880> like<00:02:06.000> they're

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
of that situation looks like they're

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.670 
of that situation looks like they're
trying<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.540> get<00:02:06.690> this<00:02:06.870> conversion<00:02:07.290> on<00:02:07.590> the

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
trying to get this conversion on the

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:14.640 
about the 22 yard line and that'll be

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.460 
about the 22 yard line and that'll be
enough<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.240> move<00:02:15.390> the<00:02:15.450> sticks<00:02:15.900> well<00:02:16.320> he<00:02:16.440> just

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
enough to move the sticks well he just

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.590 
enough to move the sticks well he just
lowered<00:02:17.010> his<00:02:17.160> head<00:02:17.190> and<00:02:17.640> followed<00:02:18.060> those<00:02:18.240> big
