00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.600

the<00:01:45.150> first<00:01:45.450> lick<00:01:45.690> is<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> call<00:01:46.410> or<00:01:46.770> the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
the first lick is the call or the

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.350 
the first lick is the call or the
question<00:01:49.130> kind<00:01:50.130> of<00:01:50.280> leaves<00:01:50.430> it<00:01:50.550> hanging<00:01:50.910> and

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
question kind of leaves it hanging and

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:52.730 
question kind of leaves it hanging and
the<00:01:51.450> second<00:01:51.840> lick<00:01:51.960> is<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.290> answer<00:01:52.620> to<00:01:52.710> that

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740

all I want to address the vibrato part
of<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.540> lick<00:02:15.780> because<00:02:15.959> it's<00:02:16.080> really<00:02:16.260> what

slight<00:02:26.520> Bend<00:02:30.200> now<00:02:31.200> that<00:02:31.380> band<00:02:31.740> is<00:02:32.040> less<00:02:32.340> than

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
slight Bend now that band is less than

slight Bend now that band is less than
then<00:02:34.260> a<00:02:34.290> half-step<00:02:34.860> it's<00:02:35.100> more<00:02:35.310> of<00:02:35.400> like<00:02:35.580> a

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
then a half-step it's more of like a

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.070 
then a half-step it's more of like a
quarter<00:02:36.090> step<00:02:38.300> you<00:02:39.300> just<00:02:39.510> want<00:02:39.660> to<00:02:39.690> get<00:02:39.840> just

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
quarter step you just want to get just

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.080 
quarter step you just want to get just
enough<00:02:40.230> bluesy<00:02:40.890> sound<00:02:41.100> in<00:02:41.310> there<00:02:41.459> you're

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
enough bluesy sound in there you're

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:46.350 
a blues time you're not even gonna get

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.780 
a blues time you're not even gonna get
there<00:02:46.560> just<00:02:46.620> gonna<00:02:46.830> give<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.100> a<00:02:47.160> slight<00:02:47.459> Bend

there just gonna give it a slight Bend

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:50.600 
there just gonna give it a slight Bend
and<00:02:48.060> it's<00:02:48.690> a<00:02:48.810> really<00:02:49.019> nice<00:02:49.290> really<00:02:50.160> nice<00:02:50.310> feel

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:58.009 
and it's a really nice really nice feel
to<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.850> blues<00:02:51.390> lick<00:02:51.920> I<00:02:56.660> get<00:02:57.660> it<00:02:57.780> a<00:02:57.840> good

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
to the blues lick I get it a good

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:58.790 
to the blues lick I get it a good
vibrato

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
vibrato

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:02.570 
vibrato
I'm<00:02:59.340> also<00:02:59.790> barely<00:03:00.690> bending<00:03:01.050> the<00:03:01.140> note<00:03:01.350> so<00:03:01.920> if<00:03:02.400> I

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
I'm also barely bending the note so if I

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:04.699 
I'm also barely bending the note so if I
was<00:03:02.730> gonna<00:03:02.790> play<00:03:03.090> this<00:03:03.269> slow<00:03:04.019> down<00:03:04.350> for<00:03:04.650> you

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
was gonna play this slow down for you

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:07.310 
was gonna play this slow down for you
the<00:03:05.430> vibrato<00:03:05.850> would<00:03:06.150> sound<00:03:06.930> something<00:03:07.170> like

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
the vibrato would sound something like

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:16.550 
the vibrato would sound something like
this

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:19.290 

just<00:03:17.560> barely<00:03:17.980> bending<00:03:18.610> the<00:03:18.700> pitch<00:03:18.910> just

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
just barely bending the pitch just

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.120 
just barely bending the pitch just
enough<00:03:19.600> and<00:03:19.780> I'm<00:03:20.350> probably<00:03:20.560> doing<00:03:20.890> it<00:03:20.980> about

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
enough and I'm probably doing it about

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.710 
enough and I'm probably doing it about
three<00:03:21.760> or<00:03:21.850> four<00:03:22.060> times<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:25.420> then<00:03:25.570> when<00:03:25.690> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
three or four times and then when I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.660 
three or four times and then when I
repeat<00:03:26.020> the<00:03:26.170> second<00:03:26.560> time<00:03:26.740> the<00:03:27.040> answer<00:03:27.460> to

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:27.670 
repeat the second time the answer to

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.520 
repeat the second time the answer to
their<00:03:27.820> lick<00:03:30.030> let's<00:03:31.030> start<00:03:31.270> from<00:03:31.390> that<00:03:31.540> note<00:03:31.840> go

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530 
their lick let's start from that note go

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:33.930 
their lick let's start from that note go
back<00:03:32.740> to<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.040> a<00:03:33.070> on<00:03:33.310> the<00:03:33.400> seventh<00:03:33.730> fret<00:03:33.880> a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:33.940 
back to the a on the seventh fret a

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.090 
back to the a on the seventh fret a
string<00:03:34.090> and<00:03:34.870> end<00:03:35.170> on<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.530> fifth<00:03:35.770> fret<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
string and end on the fifth fret of the

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:37.580 
string and end on the fifth fret of the
g<00:03:36.310> string

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
g string

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.650 
g string
with<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.710> same<00:03:38.980> style<00:03:39.430> vibrato<00:03:40.030> it's<00:03:40.330> just<00:03:40.570> a

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:40.660 
with the same style vibrato it's just a

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.850 
with the same style vibrato it's just a
slight<00:03:40.990> Bend<00:03:42.630> and<00:03:43.630> an<00:03:43.780> even<00:03:44.200> amount<00:03:44.440> of

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
slight Bend and an even amount of

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:51.810 
slight Bend and an even amount of
bending<00:03:45.400> up<00:03:45.550> and<00:03:45.760> releasing<00:03:46.240> so<00:03:50.400> so<00:03:51.400> slowly

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
bending up and releasing so so slowly

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.250 
bending up and releasing so so slowly
that<00:03:51.970> vibrato<00:03:52.420> would<00:03:52.630> be<00:03:52.720> so<00:03:52.900> much<00:03:52.990> the<00:03:53.200> other

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
that vibrato would be so much the other

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.940 
that vibrato would be so much the other
one<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:53.620> this<00:03:57.750> here's<00:03:58.750> one<00:03:58.990> variation<00:03:59.350> also

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
one like this here's one variation also

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.540 
one like this here's one variation also
if<00:04:00.100> you<00:04:00.190> want<00:04:00.370> to<00:04:00.430> tag<00:04:00.730> up<00:04:01.110> high<00:04:02.110> a<00:04:02.470> to<00:04:02.650> the<00:04:03.400> end

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
if you want to tag up high a to the end

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:05.010 
if you want to tag up high a to the end
of<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:03.730> slick<00:04:03.970> it's<00:04:04.180> a<00:04:04.270> good<00:04:04.420> way<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.570> add<00:04:04.780> some

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:05.020 
of the slick it's a good way to add some

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:07.500 
of the slick it's a good way to add some
variation<00:04:05.590> so<00:04:06.430> I<00:04:06.460> might<00:04:06.820> start<00:04:07.060> to<00:04:07.180> lik<00:04:07.330> like

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
variation so I might start to lik like

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:15.030 
variation so I might start to lik like
this<00:04:09.360> ended<00:04:10.360> like<00:04:10.510> this<00:04:13.350> add<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.590> high<00:04:14.830> a

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:33.560 

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.200 

so<00:05:34.560> remember<00:05:34.920> the<00:05:35.040> key<00:05:35.070> to<00:05:35.430> a<00:05:35.460> killer<00:05:35.880> blues

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
so remember the key to a killer blues

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.540 
so remember the key to a killer blues
lick<00:05:36.510> is<00:05:36.660> your<00:05:36.810> vibrato<00:05:37.320> so<00:05:37.770> practicing<00:05:38.400> your

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:38.550 
lick is your vibrato so practicing your
