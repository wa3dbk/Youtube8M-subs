was<00:00:59.910> a<00:00:59.940> terrible<00:01:00.390> show<00:01:00.600> right<00:01:01.410> now<00:01:02.030> it'll

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
was a terrible show right now it'll

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.929 
was a terrible show right now it'll
still<00:01:03.420> take<00:01:03.690> about<00:01:03.930> ten<00:01:04.760> nanoseconds<00:01:05.760> from

the light of your friend to reach you

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.130 
the light of your friend to reach you
and<00:01:08.430> we'll<00:01:08.549> take<00:01:08.670> about<00:01:08.760> eight<00:01:09.140> milliseconds

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
and we'll take about eight milliseconds

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.620 
and we'll take about eight milliseconds
for<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> sound<00:01:10.710> of<00:01:10.920> your<00:01:11.010> friends<00:01:11.340> voice<00:01:11.670> to

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
for the sound of your friends voice to

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
for the sound of your friends voice to
reach<00:01:12.840> you<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.740> shortly<00:01:14.010> thereafter<00:01:14.250> you'll

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
reach you and shortly thereafter you'll

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.399 
reach you and shortly thereafter you'll
decide<00:01:15.450> to<00:01:15.570> slap<00:01:15.750> your<00:01:15.900> friend<00:01:16.140> because

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
decide to slap your friend because

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.020 
decide to slap your friend because
seriously<00:01:16.799> who's<00:01:17.100> that<00:01:17.369> kind<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.670> negativity

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
seriously who's that kind of negativity

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.810 
seriously who's that kind of negativity
now<00:01:18.900> you<00:01:18.960> might<00:01:19.170> say<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.250> close<00:01:20.610> enough

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
now you might say that is close enough

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.160 
now you might say that is close enough
to<00:01:21.060> be<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.689> the<00:01:21.840> same<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:23.159> as<00:01:23.549> in<00:01:23.970> I<00:01:24.240> slapped<00:01:24.990> my

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
to be in the same now as in I slapped my

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.590 
to be in the same now as in I slapped my
friend<00:01:25.650> just<00:01:26.250> now<00:01:26.340> because<00:01:27.270> he<00:01:27.360> said

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
friend just now because he said

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.260 
friend just now because he said
something<00:01:27.900> stupid<00:01:28.490> for<00:01:29.490> how<00:01:29.729> our<00:01:29.759> brains

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
something stupid for how our brains

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.600 
something stupid for how our brains
perceive<00:01:30.509> time<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.470> relative<00:01:32.070> length<00:01:32.400> of

perceive time and the relative length of

perceive time and the relative length of
our<00:01:32.670> lifespans<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.259> probably<00:01:34.530> get<00:01:34.619> away<00:01:34.740> with

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
our lifespans you probably get away with

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:38.060 
our lifespans you probably get away with
it<00:01:35.130> because<00:01:35.250> sure<00:01:35.790> that's<00:01:36.299> now<00:01:36.930> and<00:01:37.380> we<00:01:37.920> can

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
it because sure that's now and we can

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.700 
it because sure that's now and we can
consider<00:01:38.460> a<00:01:38.549> moment<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.299> occupy<00:01:39.750> a<00:01:39.780> span<00:01:40.439> to

they'll<00:01:58.140> hear<00:01:58.590> you<00:01:58.909> which<00:01:59.909> for<00:02:00.060> our<00:02:00.090> purposes

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
they'll hear you which for our purposes

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:05.240 
they'll hear you which for our purposes
would<00:02:00.780> be<00:02:01.399> right<00:02:02.399> now<00:02:02.990> now<00:02:03.990> over<00:02:04.590> larger

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
would be right now now over larger

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
would be right now now over larger
distances<00:02:05.280> this<00:02:06.090> doesn't<00:02:06.509> quite<00:02:06.750> work<00:02:06.990> as

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
distances this doesn't quite work as

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.260 
distances this doesn't quite work as
well<00:02:07.439> so<00:02:08.129> if<00:02:08.190> you<00:02:08.280> looked<00:02:08.459> up<00:02:08.580> in<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.729> sky<00:02:08.879> and

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
well so if you looked up in the sky and

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.690 
well so if you looked up in the sky and
you<00:02:09.390> saw<00:02:09.569> baitul<00:02:10.080> juice<00:02:10.289> become<00:02:11.160> a<00:02:11.190> supernova

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
you saw baitul juice become a supernova

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.300 
you saw baitul juice become a supernova
would<00:02:12.629> you<00:02:12.780> argue<00:02:13.319> that<00:02:13.349> it's<00:02:13.620> half

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
would you argue that it's half

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.839 
would you argue that it's half
now<00:02:15.030> now<00:02:15.990> some<00:02:16.170> people<00:02:16.470> might<00:02:16.680> say<00:02:16.950> yes<00:02:17.400> until

00:02:17.839 --> 00:02:17.849 
now now some people might say yes until

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.809 
now now some people might say yes until
you<00:02:18.660> know<00:02:18.989> about<00:02:19.470> an<00:02:19.590> event<00:02:19.950> you<00:02:20.370> can't<00:02:20.580> say

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
you know about an event you can't say

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.610 
you know about an event you can't say
it's<00:02:21.540> happening<00:02:22.110> so<00:02:22.800> hey<00:02:23.489> look<00:02:24.110> that<00:02:25.110> star<00:02:25.440> is

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
it's happening so hey look that star is

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.430 
it's happening so hey look that star is
going<00:02:25.830> supernova<00:02:26.160> right<00:02:27.000> now<00:02:27.300> is<00:02:28.110> what<00:02:28.319> your

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:28.440 
going supernova right now is what your

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.800 
going supernova right now is what your
brain<00:02:28.590> might<00:02:28.830> think<00:02:29.270> you<00:02:30.270> received<00:02:30.660> an

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
brain might think you received an

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.270 
brain might think you received an
indicator<00:02:31.260> the<00:02:31.500> event<00:02:31.770> is<00:02:31.890> beginning<00:02:32.220> to

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:32.280 
indicator the event is beginning to

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.970 
indicator the event is beginning to
happen<00:02:32.459> which<00:02:33.270> for<00:02:33.660> our<00:02:33.750> purposes<00:02:34.230> indicates

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
happen which for our purposes indicates

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.390 
happen which for our purposes indicates
it<00:02:35.220> just<00:02:35.850> started<00:02:36.270> now<00:02:36.450> except<00:02:37.110> as<00:02:37.890> one<00:02:38.160> of<00:02:38.280> our

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
it just started now except as one of our

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.550 
it just started now except as one of our
viewers<00:02:38.880> you're<00:02:39.480> way<00:02:39.780> too<00:02:39.810> smart<00:02:40.110> for<00:02:40.319> that

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
viewers you're way too smart for that

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.330 
viewers you're way too smart for that
you<00:02:40.950> would<00:02:41.100> argue<00:02:41.280> this<00:02:42.150> is<00:02:42.209> banal<00:02:42.780> juice<00:02:42.959> is

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
you would argue this is banal juice is

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.040 
you would argue this is banal juice is
640<00:02:44.510> light-years<00:02:45.510> away

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
640 light-years away

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.670 
640 light-years away
the<00:02:46.530> supernova<00:02:47.130> actually<00:02:47.819> happened<00:02:48.680> 640

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
the supernova actually happened 640

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.890 
the supernova actually happened 640
years<00:02:50.220> ago<00:02:50.550> and<00:02:51.000> it's<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.300> taken<00:02:51.540> that<00:02:51.660> long

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
years ago and it's just taken that long

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.680 
years ago and it's just taken that long
for<00:02:52.739> the<00:02:52.799> light<00:02:53.040> to<00:02:53.280> reach<00:02:53.459> us<00:02:53.489> we're<00:02:54.450> all<00:02:54.510> good

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
for the light to reach us we're all good

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.360 
for the light to reach us we're all good
so<00:02:54.810> far<00:02:55.080> as<00:02:55.470> soon<00:02:55.709> as<00:02:55.799> I<00:02:55.860> started<00:02:56.190> talking

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
so far as soon as I started talking

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.759 
so far as soon as I started talking
about<00:02:56.670> light-years<00:02:57.470> you<00:02:58.470> know<00:02:58.590> what<00:02:58.680> was

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
about light-years you know what was

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:01.640 
about light-years you know what was
going<00:02:59.040> on<00:02:59.160> it<00:02:59.910> looks<00:02:59.970> like<00:03:00.660> it<00:03:01.170> just<00:03:01.200> happened

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
going on it looks like it just happened

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
going on it looks like it just happened
now<00:03:02.250> but<00:03:03.209> aware<00:03:03.569> that's<00:03:04.530> not<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:05.100> case<00:03:05.250> it

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:05.670 
now but aware that's not the case it

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.150 
now but aware that's not the case it
happened<00:03:06.030> before<00:03:06.200> we're<00:03:07.200> only<00:03:07.470> aware<00:03:07.769> it's

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
happened before we're only aware it's

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.110 
happened before we're only aware it's
happening<00:03:08.610> now<00:03:09.299> so<00:03:10.260> here<00:03:10.769> is<00:03:10.970> where<00:03:11.970> it<00:03:12.030> gets

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
happening now so here is where it gets

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.350 
happening now so here is where it gets
weird<00:03:12.739> the<00:03:13.739> most<00:03:13.950> distant<00:03:14.489> galaxies<00:03:15.090> yet

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:15.360 
weird the most distant galaxies yet

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:19.430 
weird the most distant galaxies yet
discovered<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:16.200> Zedd<00:03:16.560> 8g<00:03:17.130> and<00:03:17.220> e5<00:03:18.000> 296<00:03:18.810> it's

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
discovered is Zedd 8g and e5 296 it's

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.210 
discovered is Zedd 8g and e5 296 it's
3.4<00:03:20.269> billion<00:03:21.269> light<00:03:21.720> years<00:03:21.900> away<00:03:22.049> so<00:03:22.980> if<00:03:23.040> we

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
3.4 billion light years away so if we

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.979 
3.4 billion light years away so if we
happen<00:03:23.430> to<00:03:23.609> observe<00:03:23.970> a<00:03:24.000> supernova<00:03:24.299> in<00:03:24.840> that

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
happen to observe a supernova in that

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:28.220 
happen to observe a supernova in that
distant<00:03:25.350> galaxy<00:03:26.030> when<00:03:27.030> would<00:03:27.810> we<00:03:27.840> say<00:03:28.109> it

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
distant galaxy when would we say it

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:32.180 
distant galaxy when would we say it
happened<00:03:28.620> now<00:03:29.430> obviously<00:03:30.000> it's<00:03:30.540> not<00:03:30.980> just<00:03:31.980> now

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
happened now obviously it's not just now

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.220 
happened now obviously it's not just now
right<00:03:33.120> because<00:03:33.299> when<00:03:33.480> the<00:03:33.630> light<00:03:33.900> we

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
right because when the light we

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:36.800 
right because when the light we
currently<00:03:34.530> observe<00:03:35.010> left<00:03:35.549> that<00:03:35.700> galaxy<00:03:35.940> it

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
currently observe left that galaxy it

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.229 
currently observe left that galaxy it
was<00:03:36.930> about<00:03:37.019> 3.4<00:03:37.799> billion<00:03:38.579> light<00:03:38.940> years<00:03:39.120> away

00:03:39.229 --> 00:03:39.239 
was about 3.4 billion light years away

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:43.640 
was about 3.4 billion light years away
so<00:03:40.010> should<00:03:41.010> we<00:03:41.190> say<00:03:41.400> it<00:03:41.430> happened<00:03:41.970> 3.4<00:03:42.900> billion

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:43.650 
so should we say it happened 3.4 billion

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:46.400 
so should we say it happened 3.4 billion
years<00:03:43.890> ago<00:03:44.600> sure<00:03:45.600> that<00:03:45.959> sounds<00:03:46.079> reasonable

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
years ago sure that sounds reasonable

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.590 
years ago sure that sounds reasonable
based<00:03:47.070> on<00:03:47.340> our<00:03:47.459> baitul<00:03:47.910> Juice<00:03:48.090> example

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
based on our baitul Juice example

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.220 
based on our baitul Juice example
however<00:03:49.790> since<00:03:50.790> our<00:03:50.940> universe<00:03:51.510> has<00:03:52.019> been

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
however since our universe has been

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.550 
however since our universe has been
expanding<00:03:53.030> it<00:03:54.030> actually<00:03:54.540> took<00:03:54.690> the<00:03:54.840> light<00:03:55.019> 13

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
expanding it actually took the light 13

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.970 
expanding it actually took the light 13
point<00:03:55.859> 1<00:03:56.160> billion<00:03:57.060> years<00:03:57.510> to<00:03:57.750> reach<00:03:57.780> us<00:03:57.959> so<00:03:58.890> we

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
point 1 billion years to reach us so we

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.170 
point 1 billion years to reach us so we
could<00:03:59.100> say<00:03:59.250> it<00:03:59.579> happened<00:04:00.620> 13<00:04:01.620> point<00:04:01.890> 1<00:04:02.180> billion

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
could say it happened 13 point 1 billion

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:07.520 
could say it happened 13 point 1 billion
years<00:04:03.540> ago<00:04:04.010> so<00:04:05.010> which<00:04:05.190> one<00:04:05.430> do<00:04:05.609> we<00:04:05.760> use<00:04:06.530> the

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
years ago so which one do we use the

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.670 
years ago so which one do we use the
real<00:04:07.829> catch<00:04:08.250> is<00:04:08.760> that<00:04:09.450> there's<00:04:09.600> no<00:04:09.900> cosmic

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
real catch is that there's no cosmic

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.340 
real catch is that there's no cosmic
definition<00:04:11.489> of<00:04:11.609> now<00:04:12.450> in<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.989> universe

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350
