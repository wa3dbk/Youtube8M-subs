pretty<00:00:40.680> impressive<00:00:41.130> gameplay<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.730> myself<00:00:42.330> do

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
pretty impressive gameplay I myself do

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.050 
pretty impressive gameplay I myself do
like<00:00:43.080> the<00:00:43.260> fi<00:00:43.530> di<00:00:43.740> used<00:00:44.100> it<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.340> bit<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.580> often

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:45.060 
like the fi di used it a bit more often

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.610 
like the fi di used it a bit more often
when<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:45.300> game<00:00:45.480> originally<00:00:45.900> came<00:00:46.170> out<00:00:46.380> it

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
when the game originally came out it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.440 
when the game originally came out it
does<00:00:47.130> have<00:00:47.310> a<00:00:47.340> little<00:00:47.550> bit<00:00:47.700> of<00:00:47.790> high<00:00:48.060> amount<00:00:48.360> of

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
does have a little bit of high amount of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.600 
does have a little bit of high amount of
recoil<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.080> it's<00:00:49.230> it<00:00:49.470> compensates<00:00:49.890> because

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
recoil but it's it compensates because

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.280 
recoil but it's it compensates because
you<00:00:50.730> can<00:00:50.880> use<00:00:51.000> grip<00:00:51.300> as<00:00:51.510> an<00:00:51.660> attachment<00:00:51.960> to

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:52.290 
you can use grip as an attachment to

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.260 
you can use grip as an attachment to
lower<00:00:52.440> the<00:00:52.590> recoil<00:00:52.980> and<00:00:53.310> the<00:00:53.520> fire<00:00:53.790> rate<00:00:54.060> is

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
lower the recoil and the fire rate is

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.690 
lower the recoil and the fire rate is
really<00:00:54.750> fast<00:00:55.110> obviously<00:00:55.770> it's<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.040> 42<00:00:56.490> round

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:56.700 
really fast obviously it's a 42 round

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.450 
really fast obviously it's a 42 round
magazine<00:00:57.150> which<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.540> obviously<00:00:57.989> great<00:00:58.290> but<00:00:59.040> to

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
magazine which is obviously great but to

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.430 
magazine which is obviously great but to
mention<00:00:59.880> this<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.239> hardcore<00:01:00.630> as<00:01:01.079> you<00:01:01.230> can

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
mention this is hardcore as you can

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.050 
mention this is hardcore as you can
obviously<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:02.130> because<00:01:02.310> you<00:01:02.520> don't<00:01:02.670> see<00:01:02.850> as

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060 
obviously see because you don't see as

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:05.479 
obviously see because you don't see as
bullets<00:01:03.510> or<00:01:03.899> anything<00:01:04.350> like<00:01:04.379> that<00:01:04.530> but<00:01:05.250> anyway

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
bullets or anything like that but anyway

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.270 
couple days ago and there's absolute
craziness<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.170> that<00:01:16.290> game<00:01:16.470> right<00:01:16.680> now<00:01:16.710> I<00:01:16.860> mean

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
craziness in that game right now I mean

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.640 
craziness in that game right now I mean
obviously<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:18.360> only<00:01:18.450> kill<00:01:18.780> streaks<00:01:19.080> we<00:01:19.350> saw

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
obviously the only kill streaks we saw

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.270 
obviously the only kill streaks we saw
they<00:01:20.010> only<00:01:20.159> have<00:01:20.400> like<00:01:20.640> five<00:01:20.880> available<00:01:21.570> at

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
they only have like five available at

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.530 
they only have like five available at
Gamescom<00:01:23.280> or<00:01:23.580> whatever<00:01:23.940> that<00:01:24.060> event<00:01:24.510> was

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
Gamescom or whatever that event was

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.080 
Gamescom or whatever that event was
called<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.890> have<00:01:26.010> upgradeable<00:01:26.700> streaks

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
called but you have upgradeable streaks

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.640 
called but you have upgradeable streaks
which<00:01:27.420> means<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.930> could<00:01:28.080> spend<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.470> hundred

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
which means you could spend a hundred

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.090 
which means you could spend a hundred
points<00:01:29.010> on<00:01:29.630> allowing<00:01:30.630> your<00:01:30.870> UAV<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.860> last

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
points on allowing your UAV to last

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.399 
points on allowing your UAV to last
longer<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:32.880> could<00:01:33.060> sweep<00:01:33.420> quicker<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.200> could

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
longer it could sweep quicker it could

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.219 
longer it could sweep quicker it could
turn<00:01:34.619> into<00:01:34.680> an<00:01:35.130> orbital<00:01:35.700> vsat<00:01:35.940> and<00:01:36.510> basically

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
turn into an orbital vsat and basically

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.350 
turn into an orbital vsat and basically
by<00:01:37.770> accosting<00:01:38.369> points<00:01:38.729> what<00:01:38.880> i<00:01:38.909> mean<00:01:39.180> by<00:01:39.330> that

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
by accosting points what i mean by that

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.810 
by accosting points what i mean by that
is<00:01:39.570> like<00:01:39.990> let's<00:01:40.350> say<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.619> UI<00:01:40.799> v<00:01:40.979> if<00:01:41.159> you<00:01:41.580> want

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
is like let's say the UI v if you want

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:44.240 
is like let's say the UI v if you want
to<00:01:41.909> make<00:01:42.119> it<00:01:42.330> last<00:01:42.570> longer<00:01:42.840> than<00:01:43.320> 30<00:01:43.770> seconds

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
to make it last longer than 30 seconds

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.980

60 seconds you have to make it cost an

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.980 
60 seconds you have to make it cost an
extra<00:01:49.229> hundred<00:01:49.650> points<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.549> earn<00:01:50.790> so<00:01:51.570> it's<00:01:51.900> a

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
extra hundred points to earn so it's a

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.170 
extra hundred points to earn so it's a
really<00:01:52.229> cool<00:01:52.560> concept<00:01:52.799> that<00:01:53.400> nobody<00:01:54.030> just

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
really cool concept that nobody just

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.030 
really cool concept that nobody just
really<00:01:54.479> thought<00:01:54.689> of<00:01:54.750> before<00:01:55.020> and<00:01:55.229> obviously

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
really thought of before and obviously

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.600 
really thought of before and obviously
sledgehammer<00:01:57.030> took<00:01:57.420> black<00:01:58.110> ops<00:01:58.380> 2<00:01:58.650> idea<00:01:59.340> of

sledgehammer took black ops 2 idea of

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.520 
sledgehammer took black ops 2 idea of
the<00:01:59.760> pic<00:01:59.939> 10<00:02:00.150> system<00:02:00.540> and<00:02:00.750> made<00:02:00.900> it<00:02:01.020> into<00:02:01.110> a<00:02:01.260> pic

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the pic 10 system and made it into a pic

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.340 
the pic 10 system and made it into a pic
13<00:02:01.890> and<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.880> reason<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.299> mayor<00:02:03.450> pic<00:02:03.750> 13<00:02:03.930> is

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
13 and the reason the mayor pic 13 is

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.260 
13 and the reason the mayor pic 13 is
because<00:02:04.710> they<00:02:04.860> include<00:02:05.220> the<00:02:05.430> streaks<00:02:05.790> inside

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
because they include the streaks inside

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.999 
because they include the streaks inside
of<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.540> but<00:02:06.869> one<00:02:07.680> of<00:02:07.710> the<00:02:07.799> most

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
of that but one of the most

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:09.710 
of that but one of the most
groundbreaking<00:02:08.220> things<00:02:08.879> obviously<00:02:09.509> as<00:02:09.689> we

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
the exoskeleton suit and you can't just

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.160 
the exoskeleton suit and you can't just
pick<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.760> class<00:02:27.030> and<00:02:27.060> walk<00:02:27.510> around<00:02:27.690> and<00:02:27.990> sit

pick that class and walk around and sit
in<00:02:28.260> corners<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.860> would<00:02:29.069> be<00:02:29.190> pretty<00:02:29.520> annoying

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
in corners that would be pretty annoying

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.270 
in corners that would be pretty annoying
but<00:02:30.690> from<00:02:31.110> what<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.410> saw<00:02:31.650> with<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.890> campaign

couple days ago this game looks like

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.229 
couple days ago this game looks like
it's<00:02:36.330> going<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.780> be<00:02:36.900> extremely<00:02:37.370> fast-paced<00:02:38.370> if

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
it's going to be extremely fast-paced if

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.510 
it's going to be extremely fast-paced if
not<00:02:39.690> even<00:02:39.930> more<00:02:40.080> fast-paced<00:02:40.590> in<00:02:40.950> black<00:02:41.160> ops<00:02:41.370> 2

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
not even more fast-paced in black ops 2

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.940 
not even more fast-paced in black ops 2
which<00:02:42.209> is<00:02:42.239> something<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.900> think<00:02:42.959> cold<00:02:43.470> ed<00:02:43.770> has

which is something I think cold ed has

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.830 
which is something I think cold ed has
been<00:02:44.220> deprived<00:02:44.640> of<00:02:44.850> at<00:02:45.060> least<00:02:45.180> sense<00:02:45.510> call

the<00:03:16.200> entire<00:03:16.530> game<00:03:16.739> that<00:03:16.769> would<00:03:16.980> be<00:03:17.100> pretty

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
the entire game that would be pretty

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.309 
the entire game that would be pretty

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
friggin annoying to be honest but we see

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:22.009

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
your scorestreaks so it's exactly like

problem with this if flak jacket and
advanced<00:03:46.079> warfare<00:03:46.500> works<00:03:47.190> like<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.700> did<00:03:47.940> in

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
advanced warfare works like it did in

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.599 
advanced warfare works like it did in
black<00:03:48.660> ops<00:03:48.870> 1<00:03:48.959> or<00:03:49.200> black<00:03:49.380> ops<00:03:49.590> 2<00:03:49.799> because<00:03:50.489> if

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:50.609 
black ops 1 or black ops 2 because if

00:03:50.609 --> 00:03:52.430 
black ops 1 or black ops 2 because if
you<00:03:50.730> guys<00:03:50.880> remember<00:03:51.060> blast<00:03:51.600> shield<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.200> Mama

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
you guys remember blast shield and Mama

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.560 
you guys remember blast shield and Mama
for<00:03:52.650> 3<00:03:52.890> or<00:03:53.100> cold<00:03:53.400> duty<00:03:53.640> ghosts<00:03:53.880> it's<00:03:54.180> pretty

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
for 3 or cold duty ghosts it's pretty

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.900 
for 3 or cold duty ghosts it's pretty
useless<00:03:55.049> against<00:03:55.560> danger<00:03:55.890> closer<00:03:56.160> explosives

00:03:56.900 --> 00:03:56.910 
useless against danger closer explosives

00:03:56.910 --> 00:03:59.060 
useless against danger closer explosives
so<00:03:57.450> if<00:03:57.540> it's<00:03:57.690> like<00:03:57.870> anything<00:03:58.440> like<00:03:58.590> black<00:03:58.859> ops

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
so if it's like anything like black ops

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:02.420 
so if it's like anything like black ops
2<00:03:59.250> flak<00:03:59.489> jacket<00:03:59.940> it<00:04:00.720> would<00:04:00.900> probably<00:04:01.250> get<00:04:02.250> rid

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
2 flak jacket it would probably get rid

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.250 
2 flak jacket it would probably get rid
of<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.730> ability<00:04:03.209> of<00:04:03.239> danger<00:04:03.630> close<00:04:03.840> really

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
of the ability of danger close really

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.319 
of the ability of danger close really
would<00:04:04.410> counter<00:04:04.769> it<00:04:04.890> for<00:04:05.100> sure<00:04:05.250> so<00:04:05.549> let's<00:04:06.120> just

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:06.329 
would counter it for sure so let's just

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:09.349 
would counter it for sure so let's just
hope<00:04:06.480> that's<00:04:06.720> the<00:04:06.870> way<00:04:07.079> it<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.260> but<00:04:07.950> all<00:04:08.239> in<00:04:09.239> all

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:09.359 
hope that's the way it is but all in all

00:04:09.359 --> 00:04:11.180 
hope that's the way it is but all in all
i'm<00:04:09.660> looking<00:04:10.079> forward<00:04:10.290> to<00:04:10.410> advanced<00:04:10.739> warfare

important things and that's something we

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:53.050 
important things and that's something we
