okay<00:01:03.280> so<00:01:03.340> let's<00:01:03.670> relate<00:01:03.910> this<00:01:03.969> coagulation

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
okay so let's relate this coagulation

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:06.359 
okay so let's relate this coagulation
theory<00:01:05.170> to<00:01:05.440> something<00:01:05.770> that<00:01:05.800> we<00:01:06.009> might<00:01:06.160> know

00:01:06.359 --> 00:01:06.369 
theory to something that we might know

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:08.700 
theory to something that we might know
just<00:01:07.210> take<00:01:07.420> the<00:01:07.539> example<00:01:07.600> of<00:01:08.050> creme<00:01:08.350> anglaise

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 
just take the example of creme anglaise

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:11.580 
just take the example of creme anglaise
so<00:01:09.550> here<00:01:10.360> we<00:01:10.479> have<00:01:10.690> the<00:01:10.899> ingredients<00:01:11.080> for<00:01:11.320> in

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
so here we have the ingredients for in

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.139 
so here we have the ingredients for in
one<00:01:11.740> place<00:01:11.950> fairly<00:01:12.369> standard<00:01:12.789> egg<00:01:12.910> yolks

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
one place fairly standard egg yolks

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:15.749 
one place fairly standard egg yolks
sugar<00:01:13.500> milk<00:01:14.500> and<00:01:14.560> sometimes<00:01:15.250> a<00:01:15.430> little<00:01:15.490> bit<00:01:15.610> of

00:01:15.749 --> 00:01:15.759 
sugar milk and sometimes a little bit of

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.420 
sugar milk and sometimes a little bit of
cream<00:01:15.940> enough<00:01:16.180> another<00:01:16.420> pod<00:01:16.830> so<00:01:17.830> in<00:01:18.190> this

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:18.430 
cream enough another pod so in this

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.630 
cream enough another pod so in this
production<00:01:18.700> process<00:01:19.360> we<00:01:20.100> beat<00:01:21.100> the<00:01:21.369> egg<00:01:21.610> yolks

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
production process we beat the egg yolks

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.020 
production process we beat the egg yolks
and<00:01:21.940> the<00:01:22.030> sugar<00:01:22.090> together<00:01:23.670> it's<00:01:24.670> important

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
and the sugar together it's important

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:26.190 
and the sugar together it's important
not<00:01:25.119> to<00:01:25.180> believe<00:01:25.540> the<00:01:25.720> sugar<00:01:25.960> on<00:01:26.110> the

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
not to believe the sugar on the

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.810 
not to believe the sugar on the
Yugoslavs<00:01:26.860> otherwise<00:01:27.310> they<00:01:27.490> could<00:01:27.670> have<00:01:27.790> a

Yugoslavs otherwise they could have a

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.149 
Yugoslavs otherwise they could have a
bit<00:01:28.000> of<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.150> reaction<00:01:28.990> of<00:01:29.110> them<00:01:29.290> and<00:01:29.680> chemically

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:30.159 
bit of a reaction of them and chemically

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.890 
bit of a reaction of them and chemically
burn<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.520> yolks<00:01:30.760> so<00:01:31.659> in<00:01:32.020> the<00:01:32.380> production<00:01:32.710> of<00:01:33.100> a

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:33.900 
burn the yolks so in the production of a

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.810 
burn the yolks so in the production of a
creme<00:01:34.900> anglaise<00:01:35.259> on<00:01:35.619> the<00:01:35.860> first<00:01:36.040> processes<00:01:36.520> to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:36.820 
creme anglaise on the first processes to

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.820 
creme anglaise on the first processes to
warm<00:01:37.000> up<00:01:37.150> the<00:01:37.390> the<00:01:38.170> milk<00:01:38.380> with<00:01:38.530> a<00:01:38.560> cream

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
warm up the the milk with a cream

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.740 
warm up the the milk with a cream
mixture<00:01:39.100> to<00:01:39.310> infuse<00:01:39.670> it<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:39.939> to<00:01:40.390> slowly

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
mixture to infuse it and to slowly

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.780 
mixture to infuse it and to slowly
temper<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.619> egg<00:01:41.830> yolk<00:01:42.070> mixture<00:01:42.460> with<00:01:42.700> a

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
temper the egg yolk mixture with a

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.499 
temper the egg yolk mixture with a
little<00:01:43.030> bit<00:01:43.150> of<00:01:43.270> this<00:01:43.390> some<00:01:43.720> warm<00:01:44.530> liquid<00:01:45.509> it's

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
little bit of this some warm liquid it's

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:47.670 
little bit of this some warm liquid it's
very<00:01:46.659> important<00:01:47.020> because<00:01:47.080> then<00:01:47.380> what<00:01:47.500> we<00:01:47.590> do

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
very important because then what we do

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:50.850 
very important because then what we do
is<00:01:47.830> return<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.670> mixture<00:01:49.180> back<00:01:49.930> to<00:01:50.290> the<00:01:50.470> pot<00:01:50.680> to

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
is return the mixture back to the pot to

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.710 
is return the mixture back to the pot to
cook<00:01:51.100> it<00:01:51.220> out<00:01:51.369> this<00:01:51.939> is<00:01:52.090> where<00:01:52.270> the<00:01:52.360> beginning

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
cook it out this is where the beginning

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.130 
cook it out this is where the beginning
of<00:01:52.930> the<00:01:53.229> coagulation<00:01:53.950> process<00:01:54.400> begins<00:01:55.140> it's

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
of the coagulation process begins it's

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:58.170 
of the coagulation process begins it's
very<00:01:56.350> important<00:01:56.829> to<00:01:56.950> note<00:01:57.100> that<00:01:57.130> during<00:01:58.090> this

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:58.180 
very important to note that during this

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.969 
very important to note that during this
cooking<00:01:58.540> out<00:01:58.630> process<00:01:59.020> we<00:01:59.350> can't<00:01:59.590> allow<00:01:59.920> the

00:01:59.969 --> 00:01:59.979 
cooking out process we can't allow the

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:03.690 
cooking out process we can't allow the
mixture<00:02:00.220> to<00:02:00.430> exceed<00:02:00.909> 85<00:02:01.720> degrees<00:02:02.700> what's

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:03.700 
mixture to exceed 85 degrees what's

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.219 
mixture to exceed 85 degrees what's
actually<00:02:03.880> happening<00:02:04.329> here<00:02:04.390> is<00:02:04.600> as<00:02:04.780> it<00:02:04.960> warms

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
actually happening here is as it warms

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.139 
actually happening here is as it warms
up<00:02:05.380> the<00:02:05.680> egg<00:02:05.860> proteins<00:02:06.310> are<00:02:06.430> starting<00:02:06.790> to<00:02:06.880> join

up the egg proteins are starting to join

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.479 
up the egg proteins are starting to join
together<00:02:07.619> and<00:02:08.619> that's<00:02:08.799> what<00:02:08.979> creates<00:02:09.429> the

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:09.489 
together and that's what creates the

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.979 
together and that's what creates the
 thickness<00:02:10.420> which<00:02:10.600> we<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.869> so

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
 thickness which we have so

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.800 
 thickness which we have so
shaped<00:02:11.260> with<00:02:11.380> creme<00:02:11.620> anglaise<00:02:12.360> now<00:02:13.360> one<00:02:13.780> of

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
like Freemont lays as if we can continue

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.520 
like Freemont lays as if we can continue
to<00:02:18.190> ovate<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.720> you<00:02:19.900> can<00:02:20.019> see<00:02:20.170> in<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.320> club

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
to ovate as you can see in the club

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.630 
to ovate as you can see in the club
let's<00:02:20.739> see<00:02:20.799> what<00:02:20.920> happens<00:02:21.130> we'll<00:02:21.220> be<00:02:21.280> able<00:02:21.370> to

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
let's see what happens we'll be able to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.900 
let's see what happens we'll be able to
source<00:02:22.079> those<00:02:23.079> proteins<00:02:23.799> can<00:02:24.040> continue<00:02:24.730> to

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:24.910 
source those proteins can continue to

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:28.050 
source those proteins can continue to
strengthen<00:02:25.360> as<00:02:26.220> they<00:02:27.220> strengthen<00:02:27.819> what

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
strengthen as they strengthen what

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:29.640 
strengthen as they strengthen what
actually<00:02:28.330> happens<00:02:28.690> as<00:02:28.840> they<00:02:28.989> tighten<00:02:29.500> and

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
actually happens as they tighten and

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:33.070 
actually happens as they tighten and
eventually<00:02:30.489> they<00:02:30.760> squeeze<00:02:31.480> the<00:02:31.930> liquid

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
eventually they squeeze the liquid

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.800 
eventually they squeeze the liquid
within<00:02:33.440> the<00:02:33.560> protein<00:02:34.060> out<00:02:35.060> and<00:02:35.390> if<00:02:35.570> you<00:02:35.660> look

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
within the protein out and if you look

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.060 
within the protein out and if you look
here<00:02:35.960> in<00:02:36.020> the<00:02:36.110> club<00:02:36.290> point<00:02:36.470> you<00:02:36.560> actually<00:02:36.830> see

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
here in the club point you actually see

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.880 
here in the club point you actually see
there's<00:02:37.760> small<00:02:38.480> chunks<00:02:38.990> and<00:02:39.110> quite<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.410> watery

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
there's small chunks and quite a watery

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.950 
there's small chunks and quite a watery
liquid<00:02:40.100> surrounding<00:02:40.880> it<00:02:41.000> this<00:02:41.570> is<00:02:41.750> an<00:02:41.870> example

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:41.960 
liquid surrounding it this is an example

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.980 
liquid surrounding it this is an example
both<00:02:42.650> over<00:02:43.250> coagulation<00:02:43.790> or<00:02:44.060> sanera<00:02:44.600> sources

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
both over coagulation or sanera sources

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.210 
both over coagulation or sanera sources
as<00:02:45.140> often<00:02:45.440> nominees<00:02:45.860> or<00:02:46.040> simply<00:02:46.760> curdling<00:02:48.220> so

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
as often nominees or simply curdling so

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.060 
as often nominees or simply curdling so
now<00:02:49.340> we're<00:02:49.520> we're<00:02:49.970> going<00:02:50.180> to<00:02:50.270> have<00:02:50.360> a<00:02:50.390> look<00:02:50.600> at

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
now we're we're going to have a look at

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.260 
now we're we're going to have a look at
producing<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.130> custard<00:02:52.520> using<00:02:52.820> colleagues

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
producing a custard using colleagues

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.990 
producing a custard using colleagues
with<00:02:53.900> the<00:02:54.020> creme<00:02:54.230> anglaise<00:02:54.560> we've<00:02:55.130> made<00:02:55.970> a

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:56.000 
with the creme anglaise we've made a

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.210 
with the creme anglaise we've made a
custard<00:02:56.390> in<00:02:56.660> egg<00:02:56.840> yolks<00:02:57.110> because<00:02:57.650> egos

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:58.220 
custard in egg yolks because egos

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.670 
custard in egg yolks because egos
contain<00:02:58.730> less<00:03:00.550> protein<00:03:01.550> then<00:03:02.000> egg<00:03:02.300> whites

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:02.680 
contain less protein then egg whites

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.760 
contain less protein then egg whites
they<00:03:03.680> produce<00:03:03.920> a<00:03:04.250> softer<00:03:04.700> result<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:06.380> in<00:03:06.680> the

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:06.770 
they produce a softer result so in the

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:07.750 
they produce a softer result so in the
clip<00:03:06.980> here<00:03:07.130> what<00:03:07.250> were<00:03:07.370> actually<00:03:07.430> doing<00:03:07.610> is

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
clip here what were actually doing is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:09.790 
clip here what were actually doing is
were<00:03:07.790> producing<00:03:08.150> a<00:03:08.300> lemon<00:03:08.540> tart<00:03:08.780> filling<00:03:08.990> so<00:03:09.530> a

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:09.800 
were producing a lemon tart filling so a

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:12.480 
were producing a lemon tart filling so a
lemon<00:03:10.670> tart<00:03:10.880> filling<00:03:11.030> has<00:03:11.330> whole<00:03:11.690> weeks<00:03:11.900> in<00:03:12.140> it

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:12.490 
lemon tart filling has whole weeks in it

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.600 
lemon tart filling has whole weeks in it
sugar<00:03:13.490> cream<00:03:14.450> in<00:03:14.690> lemon<00:03:15.230> juice<00:03:15.440> now<00:03:15.680> the<00:03:16.160> lemon

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
sugar cream in lemon juice now the lemon

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:19.210 
sugar cream in lemon juice now the lemon
juice<00:03:16.760> actually<00:03:17.240> reduces<00:03:18.020> down<00:03:18.350> the<00:03:18.800> strength

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:19.220 
juice actually reduces down the strength

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:22.030 
juice actually reduces down the strength
of<00:03:19.490> the<00:03:20.090> proteins<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.320> prevents<00:03:21.860> the

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 
of the proteins and prevents the

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.860 
of the proteins and prevents the
coagulation<00:03:22.610> happening<00:03:24.430> at<00:03:25.430> a<00:03:25.490> fast<00:03:25.760> rate<00:03:26.000> so

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
coagulation happening at a fast rate so

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.510 
coagulation happening at a fast rate so
what<00:03:27.290> works<00:03:27.530> you're<00:03:27.650> doing<00:03:27.890> here<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.310> we're

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:28.520 
what works you're doing here is we're

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.100 
what works you're doing here is we're
just<00:03:28.670> warming<00:03:29.060> up<00:03:29.150> the<00:03:29.330> mixture<00:03:29.570> ever<00:03:29.930> so

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:30.110 
just warming up the mixture ever so

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.780 
just warming up the mixture ever so
gently<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.990> we're<00:03:32.990> going<00:03:33.200> to<00:03:33.459> prepare<00:03:34.459> this

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
gently and we're going to prepare this

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.570 
gently and we're going to prepare this
in<00:03:34.910> a<00:03:35.000> slightly<00:03:35.270> different<00:03:35.450> way<00:03:36.070> than<00:03:37.070> what<00:03:37.400> we

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
in a slightly different way than what we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.320 
in a slightly different way than what we
did<00:03:37.760> for<00:03:39.430> for<00:03:40.430> for<00:03:40.640> instance<00:03:40.790> like<00:03:41.000> a<00:03:41.060> creme

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
did for for for instance like a creme

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:45.009 
did for for for instance like a creme
brulee<00:03:41.540> or<00:03:42.140> some<00:03:42.680> other<00:03:43.209> bait<00:03:44.209> to<00:03:44.390> custom<00:03:44.720> what

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:45.019 
brulee or some other bait to custom what

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:47.680 
brulee or some other bait to custom what
we<00:03:45.110> actually<00:03:45.260> do<00:03:45.590> is<00:03:45.950> we<00:03:46.450> prepare<00:03:47.450> this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
we actually do is we prepare this

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.610 
we actually do is we prepare this
custard<00:03:48.170> by<00:03:48.320> cooking<00:03:48.590> it<00:03:48.769> in<00:03:49.070> a<00:03:49.730> flame<00:03:50.030> case

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
custard by cooking it in a flame case

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.759 
custard by cooking it in a flame case
often<00:03:51.620> casts<00:03:52.550> baked<00:03:53.030> and<00:03:53.330> memories<00:03:54.320> which<00:03:54.590> are

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
often casts baked and memories which are

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.949 
often casts baked and memories which are
small<00:03:55.010> bourbon<00:03:55.730> weird<00:03:56.000> dishes<00:03:56.360> that<00:03:56.840> are

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
small bourbon weird dishes that are

00:03:56.959 --> 00:04:01.030 
small bourbon weird dishes that are
placed<00:03:57.170> into<00:03:57.760> some<00:03:58.760> water<00:03:58.970> in<00:03:59.420> a<00:04:00.170> metal

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
placed into some water in a metal

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.910 
placed into some water in a metal
container<00:04:01.360> and<00:04:02.360> the<00:04:02.480> oven<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:03.080> slowly<00:04:03.560> cooked

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
container and the oven in slowly cooked

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:05.259 
container and the oven in slowly cooked
and<00:04:04.100> it<00:04:04.190> just<00:04:04.370> helps<00:04:04.580> regulate<00:04:04.940> their

00:04:05.259 --> 00:04:05.269 
and it just helps regulate their

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.590 
and it just helps regulate their
temperature<00:04:05.860> so<00:04:06.860> here<00:04:07.760> we<00:04:07.850> are<00:04:07.970> making<00:04:08.360> the

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:08.600 
temperature so here we are making the

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.720 
temperature so here we are making the
custard<00:04:08.959> services<00:04:09.410> like<00:04:09.590> a<00:04:09.620> citrus<00:04:10.250> base<00:04:10.519> -

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:10.730 
custard services like a citrus base -

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.880 
custard services like a citrus base -
custard<00:04:11.150> just<00:04:12.050> moving<00:04:12.380> a<00:04:12.410> little<00:04:12.500> bit<00:04:12.590> of<00:04:12.739> for

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:12.890 
custard just moving a little bit of for

custard just moving a little bit of for
the<00:04:12.950> froth<00:04:13.280> there<00:04:13.550> from<00:04:13.730> the<00:04:13.850> top<00:04:14.060> of<00:04:14.239> that

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450 
the froth there from the top of that

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:15.520 
the froth there from the top of that
custard<00:04:14.930> just<00:04:15.140> to<00:04:15.230> help<00:04:15.350> with<00:04:15.470> the

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
custard just to help with the

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:21.009 
custard just to help with the
presentation<00:04:16.220> of<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:17.180> final<00:04:17.919> dish<00:04:19.780> so<00:04:20.780> just

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:21.019 
presentation of the final dish so just

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:22.450 
presentation of the final dish so just
taking<00:04:21.320> that<00:04:21.410> off<00:04:21.560> and<00:04:21.799> then<00:04:22.160> what's<00:04:22.310> gonna

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:22.460 
taking that off and then what's gonna

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:25.000 
taking that off and then what's gonna
happen<00:04:22.760> now<00:04:22.910> is<00:04:23.030> this<00:04:23.150> can<00:04:23.330> be<00:04:23.390> placed<00:04:24.010> into

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:25.010 
happen now is this can be placed into

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:27.159 
happen now is this can be placed into
the<00:04:25.340> tart<00:04:25.610> in<00:04:26.540> the<00:04:26.720> oven

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:27.169 
the tart in the oven

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.630 
the tart in the oven
so<00:04:28.090> again<00:04:29.090> it's<00:04:29.419> cooked<00:04:29.630> at<00:04:29.750> 120<00:04:30.530> degrees<00:04:30.919> and

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:31.640 
so again it's cooked at 120 degrees and

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:34.270 
so again it's cooked at 120 degrees and
that<00:04:31.790> just<00:04:32.030> helps<00:04:32.270> to<00:04:32.300> slow<00:04:32.570> down<00:04:33.280> that

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
that just helps to slow down that

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.940 
that just helps to slow down that
cooking<00:04:34.610> process<00:04:35.030> and<00:04:35.060> to<00:04:35.960> ensure<00:04:36.440> that<00:04:36.470> we

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
cooking process and to ensure that we

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.780 
cooking process and to ensure that we
don't<00:04:37.160> um<00:04:38.140> over<00:04:39.140> cook<00:04:39.890> those<00:04:40.100> proteins<00:04:40.580> and

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:40.790 
don't um over cook those proteins and

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:42.909 
don't um over cook those proteins and
ended<00:04:41.030> up<00:04:41.120> for<00:04:41.330> scrambled<00:04:41.750> egg<00:04:42.080> tasting

00:04:42.909 --> 00:04:42.919

and what you'll notice here is that the

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:26.190 
and what you'll notice here is that the
actual<00:05:24.340> customer<00:05:24.550> will<00:05:24.850> be<00:05:24.940> quite<00:05:25.180> firm<00:05:25.540> but

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:26.200 
actual customer will be quite firm but

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.080 
actual customer will be quite firm but
still<00:05:26.440> have<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> softness<00:05:27.310> about<00:05:27.580> it<00:05:27.760> due<00:05:27.940> to

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:28.090 
still have a softness about it due to

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:31.320 
still have a softness about it due to
the<00:05:28.240> little<00:05:28.960> level<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.410> acidity<00:05:29.910> now<00:05:30.910> the<00:05:31.210> way

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 
the little level of acidity now the way

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:32.790 
the little level of acidity now the way
the<00:05:31.600> reason<00:05:31.840> that<00:05:31.960> it's<00:05:32.110> holding<00:05:32.320> to<00:05:32.560> here<00:05:32.680> is

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:32.800 
the reason that it's holding to here is

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.550 
the reason that it's holding to here is
because<00:05:32.980> of<00:05:33.190> the<00:05:34.050> proportion<00:05:35.050> of<00:05:35.110> egg<00:05:35.320> white

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:35.560 
because of the proportion of egg white

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:37.620 
because of the proportion of egg white
will<00:05:36.160> whole<00:05:36.430> egg<00:05:36.670> in<00:05:36.850> the<00:05:36.940> recipe<00:05:37.210> have<00:05:37.510> you

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:37.630 
will whole egg in the recipe have you

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:39.180 
will whole egg in the recipe have you
made<00:05:37.780> this<00:05:37.840> of<00:05:37.990> yolks<00:05:38.470> hence<00:05:38.680> in<00:05:38.830> the<00:05:38.890> case<00:05:39.070> of

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:39.190 
made this of yolks hence in the case of

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:41.520 
made this of yolks hence in the case of
a<00:05:39.250> creme<00:05:39.490> anglaise<00:05:39.760> or<00:05:39.910> creme<00:05:40.120> brulee<00:05:40.530> simply

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:41.530 
a creme anglaise or creme brulee simply

00:05:41.530 --> 00:05:42.960 
a creme anglaise or creme brulee simply
wouldn't<00:05:41.830> hold<00:05:42.010> itself<00:05:42.430> together

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
wouldn't hold itself together

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:49.470 
wouldn't hold itself together
so<00:05:44.190> that's<00:05:45.190> two<00:05:45.490> examples<00:05:46.090> of<00:05:46.360> how<00:05:48.480> equate

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:49.480 
so that's two examples of how equate

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:52.170 
so that's two examples of how equate
