using a lexicon PCM 84 a fax got a
little<00:03:24.260> reverb<00:03:24.650> it's<00:03:24.920> slap<00:03:25.220> on<00:03:25.460> there<00:03:25.700> but

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:43.580 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:04:02.190 

Oh

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:02.200 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:18.890 

so<00:04:03.200> a<00:04:03.650> lot<00:04:04.340> like<00:04:04.549> a<00:04:04.579> Les<00:04:04.790> Paul

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.640 

and<00:04:19.490> these<00:04:20.490> tuning<00:04:20.880> keys<00:04:21.060> on<00:04:21.270> here<00:04:21.510> they<00:04:22.500> don't

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:22.650 
and these tuning keys on here they don't

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.830 
and these tuning keys on here they don't
look<00:04:22.710> like<00:04:22.770> much<00:04:23.160> but<00:04:23.190> they<00:04:24.150> just<00:04:24.300> don't<00:04:24.600> go

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
look like much but they just don't go

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.110 
look like much but they just don't go
out<00:04:24.990> of<00:04:25.020> tune<00:04:25.260> and<00:04:25.800> I<00:04:26.460> don't<00:04:26.520> think<00:04:26.670> Paul<00:04:26.940> would

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
out of tune and I don't think Paul would

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.870 
out of tune and I don't think Paul would
stick<00:04:27.390> anything<00:04:27.630> on<00:04:27.900> the<00:04:27.990> guitars<00:04:28.350> that<00:04:28.880> is

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
stick anything on the guitars that is

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.680 
stick anything on the guitars that is
questionable<00:04:30.450> and<00:04:30.780> nothing<00:04:31.200> on<00:04:31.320> here<00:04:31.530> is<00:04:31.710> and

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
questionable and nothing on here is and

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:35.150 
questionable and nothing on here is and
this<00:04:33.690> stop<00:04:33.990> bridge<00:04:34.290> is<00:04:34.530> another<00:04:34.800> amazing

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
this stop bridge is another amazing

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.130 
this stop bridge is another amazing
thing<00:04:35.700> it<00:04:36.000> just<00:04:36.030> does<00:04:36.450> not<00:04:36.480> go<00:04:36.780> out<00:04:36.810> of<00:04:37.020> tune

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:37.140 
thing it just does not go out of tune

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.800 
thing it just does not go out of tune
and<00:04:37.440> I<00:04:37.530> I<00:04:37.880> wrestle<00:04:38.880> with<00:04:38.910> this<00:04:39.150> thing

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
and I I wrestle with this thing

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:59.150 
and I I wrestle with this thing
quite<00:04:40.410> a<00:04:40.440> bit<00:04:40.710> and<00:04:40.980> it<00:04:41.430> doesn't<00:04:41.760> go<00:04:41.850> out<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:59.070> if

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
quite a bit and it doesn't go out so if

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.560 
quite a bit and it doesn't go out so if
you're<00:04:59.250> thinking<00:04:59.340> about<00:04:59.550> getting<00:04:59.850> a<00:05:00.150> Les<00:05:00.540> Paul

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:00.570 
you're thinking about getting a Les Paul

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.380 
you're thinking about getting a Les Paul
style<00:05:01.410> guitar<00:05:01.710> where<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:02.550> need<00:05:02.730> needa<00:05:03.180> Les

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
style guitar where you need needa Les

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.180 
style guitar where you need needa Les
Paul<00:05:03.630> style<00:05:03.960> guitar<00:05:04.080> for<00:05:04.560> that<00:05:05.520> tone<00:05:07.070> you<00:05:08.070> know

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
Paul style guitar for that tone you know

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.790 
Paul style guitar for that tone you know
use<00:05:08.430> Les<00:05:08.670> Paul<00:05:08.940> especially<00:05:09.840> I<00:05:09.870> use<00:05:10.110> the<00:05:10.680> Les

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:10.800 
use Les Paul especially I use the Les

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.280 
use Les Paul especially I use the Les
Paul<00:05:10.830> costume<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.610> mean<00:05:12.360> I<00:05:12.480> haven't<00:05:12.900> seen<00:05:13.170> them

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
Paul costume I mean I haven't seen them

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:16.340 
Paul costume I mean I haven't seen them
really<00:05:13.890> a<00:05:13.920> decent<00:05:14.280> one<00:05:14.370> below<00:05:14.670> $1,800<00:05:15.630> and<00:05:15.840> I

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
really a decent one below $1,800 and I

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.460 
really a decent one below $1,800 and I
think<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.130> normal<00:05:17.430> price<00:05:18.090> is<00:05:18.120> about<00:05:18.570> 2,300

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:19.470 
think the normal price is about 2,300

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.280 
think the normal price is about 2,300
but<00:05:20.220> if<00:05:20.370> you<00:05:20.460> can<00:05:20.610> find<00:05:20.760> one<00:05:21.000> of<00:05:21.030> these<00:05:21.210> like<00:05:22.170> I
