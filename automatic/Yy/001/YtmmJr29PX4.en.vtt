the<00:02:02.280> beat<00:02:02.580> is<00:02:02.760> is<00:02:03.150> transmitted<00:02:03.840> from<00:02:04.020> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
the beat is is transmitted from the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:05.570 
the beat is is transmitted from the
atria<00:02:04.620> which<00:02:04.770> is<00:02:04.890> at<00:02:05.010> the<00:02:05.100> top<00:02:05.250> of<00:02:05.370> the<00:02:05.430> heart

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
atria which is at the top of the heart

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.180 
atria which is at the top of the heart
through<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:05.909> ventricles<00:02:06.600> very<00:02:07.470> regular<00:02:08.069> we

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
through the ventricles very regular we

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.770 
through the ventricles very regular we
call<00:02:08.369> that<00:02:08.489> a<00:02:08.550> regular<00:02:08.909> rhythm<00:02:09.030> with<00:02:09.269> atrial

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
call that a regular rhythm with atrial

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.220 
call that a regular rhythm with atrial
fibrillation<00:02:10.430> up<00:02:11.430> in<00:02:11.760> the<00:02:12.150> atrium<00:02:12.690> the<00:02:13.050> top

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
fibrillation up in the atrium the top

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:13.869 
fibrillation up in the atrium the top
part<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.470> the<00:02:13.560> heart

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
part of the heart

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:17.380 
part of the heart
essentially<00:02:14.879> it's<00:02:15.060> quivering<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:16.010> that

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390 
essentially it's quivering and that

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:20.540 
essentially it's quivering and that
conduction<00:02:18.390> is<00:02:19.110> irregular<00:02:20.099> recording

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
conduction is irregular recording

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:23.600 
conduction is irregular recording
irregular<00:02:21.090> rhythm<00:02:21.330> as<00:02:21.450> you<00:02:21.629> see<00:02:22.610> that

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
irregular rhythm as you see that

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.039 
irregular rhythm as you see that
fluttering<00:02:24.239> that's<00:02:24.420> taking<00:02:24.690> place<00:02:24.840> that

00:02:25.039 --> 00:02:25.049 
fluttering that's taking place that

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:27.199 
fluttering that's taking place that
fibrillation<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.010> can<00:02:26.220> feel<00:02:26.580> that<00:02:26.819> in<00:02:27.060> your

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
fibrillation you can feel that in your

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.750 
fibrillation you can feel that in your
chat<00:02:27.540> boy<00:02:27.959> it<00:02:28.260> feels<00:02:28.530> like<00:02:28.709> there's<00:02:28.950> a<00:02:29.099> fish

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
chat boy it feels like there's a fish

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.960 
chat boy it feels like there's a fish
flopping<00:02:30.180> around<00:02:30.599> it's<00:02:31.170> like<00:02:31.230> a<00:02:31.319> flounder

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
flopping around it's like a flounder

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.210 
flopping around it's like a flounder
flopping<00:02:32.970> around<00:02:33.349> it's<00:02:34.349> scary<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.890> mean<00:02:35.069> who

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
flopping around it's scary I mean who

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.400 
flopping around it's scary I mean who
thinks<00:02:35.489> about<00:02:35.790> your<00:02:36.000> Hall<00:02:36.239> right<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.659> mean<00:02:36.870> the

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:37.410 
thinks about your Hall right I mean the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:38.990 
thinks about your Hall right I mean the
first<00:02:37.680> time<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:37.860> actually<00:02:38.100> said<00:02:38.580> well<00:02:38.790> there

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
first time I actually said well there

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.150 
first time I actually said well there
must<00:02:39.150> be<00:02:39.270> something<00:02:39.630> in<00:02:40.110> here<00:02:40.170> somewhere<00:02:40.980> you

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
must be something in here somewhere you

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.340 
must be something in here somewhere you
know

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
know

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:43.260 
know
like<00:02:41.560> my<00:02:41.800> heart<00:02:42.070> risk<00:02:42.760> you<00:02:42.910> know<00:02:43.000> you<00:02:43.060> don't

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:43.270 
like my heart risk you know you don't

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:44.550 
like my heart risk you know you don't
pay<00:02:43.390> attention<00:02:43.450> to<00:02:43.840> your<00:02:44.050> liver<00:02:44.260> your<00:02:44.530> kidneys

pay attention to your liver your kidneys

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.330 
pay attention to your liver your kidneys
or<00:02:45.070> your<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.400> their<00:02:45.790> it<00:02:45.910> was<00:02:45.940> going<00:02:46.390> like<00:02:46.690> that

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
or your and their it was going like that

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.010 
or your and their it was going like that
somebody<00:02:48.340> like<00:02:48.610> you<00:02:48.790> who's<00:02:49.090> who's<00:02:49.480> leaned<00:02:49.810> in

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
somebody like you who's who's leaned in

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.140 
somebody like you who's who's leaned in
good<00:02:50.260> shape<00:02:50.590> and<00:02:50.920> active<00:02:51.430> and<00:02:51.610> dancing<00:02:52.030> around

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:52.150 
good shape and active and dancing around

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:54.330 
good shape and active and dancing around
and<00:02:52.570> all<00:02:52.630> that<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.960> wouldn't<00:02:53.260> think<00:02:53.470> that<00:02:53.800> you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
and all that you wouldn't think that you

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.310 
and all that you wouldn't think that you
would<00:02:54.490> be<00:02:54.610> set<00:02:54.880> up<00:02:55.000> for<00:02:55.180> a<00:02:55.240> heart<00:02:55.450> problem<00:02:55.660> but

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:56.320 
would be set up for a heart problem but

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.200 
would be set up for a heart problem but
this<00:02:56.470> is<00:02:56.590> a<00:02:56.620> different<00:02:56.980> type<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.310> yeah<00:02:57.640> but<00:02:57.910> it

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:58.210 
this is a different type of yeah but it

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.850 
this is a different type of yeah but it
but<00:02:58.630> you<00:02:58.720> know<00:02:58.810> with<00:02:59.020> it<00:02:59.170> what<00:02:59.290> I'm<00:02:59.410> learning

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
but you know with it what I'm learning

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:01.290 
but you know with it what I'm learning
you<00:02:59.890> know<00:03:00.160> not<00:03:00.340> only<00:03:00.640> the<00:03:00.790> two<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.150> half

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
you know not only the two and a half

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.420 
you know not only the two and a half
million<00:03:01.480> people<00:03:01.660> have<00:03:01.990> this<00:03:02.170> thing<00:03:02.470> but<00:03:03.220> if

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:03.430 
million people have this thing but if

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:05.280 
million people have this thing but if
you<00:03:03.610> don't<00:03:03.970> take<00:03:04.210> care<00:03:04.240> of<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.750> you're<00:03:04.960> playing

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
you don't take care of it you're playing

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.310 
you don't take care of it you're playing
with<00:03:05.500> fire<00:03:05.560> and<00:03:06.130> this<00:03:06.850> is<00:03:07.060> dangerous<00:03:07.420> and<00:03:07.960> so

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:08.320 
with fire and this is dangerous and so

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.960 
with fire and this is dangerous and so
that's<00:03:08.530> why<00:03:08.680> I'm<00:03:08.800> here<00:03:08.980> it<00:03:09.340> is<00:03:09.730> really

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
that's why I'm here it is really

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.120 
that's why I'm here it is really
dangerous<00:03:10.240> so<00:03:10.840> if<00:03:10.930> you<00:03:11.110> have<00:03:11.380> symptoms<00:03:11.890> of

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
dangerous so if you have symptoms of

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.590 
dangerous so if you have symptoms of
atrial<00:03:12.370> fibrillation<00:03:12.760> whether<00:03:13.330> it's<00:03:13.510> a

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
atrial fibrillation whether it's a

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:15.300 
atrial fibrillation whether it's a
pounding<00:03:14.140> fluttering<00:03:14.590> in<00:03:14.710> your<00:03:14.800> chest<00:03:15.040> these

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
pounding fluttering in your chest these

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.500 
pounding fluttering in your chest these
palpitations<00:03:16.060> we're<00:03:16.210> talking<00:03:16.420> about

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
palpitations we're talking about

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.900 
palpitations we're talking about
shortness<00:03:17.350> of<00:03:17.440> breath<00:03:17.650> you<00:03:17.890> feel<00:03:18.160> weak<00:03:18.610> you

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
shortness of breath you feel weak you

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.460 
shortness of breath you feel weak you
have<00:03:19.000> a<00:03:19.060> little<00:03:19.180> chest<00:03:19.480> pain<00:03:19.570> or<00:03:19.720> fatigue<00:03:20.200> and

00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:20.470 
have a little chest pain or fatigue and

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:22.110 
have a little chest pain or fatigue and
dizziness<00:03:20.980> can<00:03:21.430> come<00:03:21.610> with<00:03:21.730> it<00:03:21.820> because<00:03:21.910> your

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
dizziness can come with it because your

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.970 
dizziness can come with it because your
heart's<00:03:22.390> not<00:03:22.480> beating<00:03:22.600> blood<00:03:23.260> as<00:03:23.410> efficiently

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
heart's not beating blood as efficiently

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:26.100 
heart's not beating blood as efficiently
as<00:03:24.190> it<00:03:24.310> normally<00:03:24.640> does<00:03:24.820> and<00:03:24.970> what<00:03:25.540> we<00:03:25.750> really

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:26.110 
as it normally does and what we really

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.810 
as it normally does and what we really
worry<00:03:26.350> about<00:03:26.470> in<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.070> emergency<00:03:27.430> department

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:27.820 
worry about in the emergency department

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:29.850 
worry about in the emergency department
is<00:03:27.910> if<00:03:28.420> you<00:03:28.630> have<00:03:28.810> that<00:03:28.960> irregular<00:03:29.380> atrial

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:29.860 
is if you have that irregular atrial

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:31.710 
is if you have that irregular atrial
fibrillation<00:03:30.010> and<00:03:30.640> it's<00:03:30.850> conducting<00:03:31.450> really

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
fibrillation and it's conducting really

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.960 
fibrillation and it's conducting really
fast<00:03:32.050> to<00:03:32.770> the<00:03:32.920> ventricles<00:03:33.400> which<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.700> the<00:03:33.790> part

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
fast to the ventricles which is the part

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:35.190 
fast to the ventricles which is the part
of<00:03:34.000> the<00:03:34.090> heart<00:03:34.270> that<00:03:34.300> pushes<00:03:34.780> blood<00:03:34.930> to<00:03:35.110> the

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
of the heart that pushes blood to the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.170 
of the heart that pushes blood to the
rest<00:03:35.320> of<00:03:35.440> the<00:03:35.500> body<00:03:35.680> that<00:03:36.370> can<00:03:36.430> really<00:03:36.790> cause<00:03:37.120> a

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:37.180

stimulants<00:05:33.520> because<00:05:33.790> one<00:05:34.450> of<00:05:34.540> the<00:05:34.630> first

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:34.840 
stimulants because one of the first

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:36.390 
stimulants because one of the first
things<00:05:35.080> we<00:05:35.200> actually<00:05:35.410> check<00:05:35.830> for<00:05:36.070> if<00:05:36.160> you<00:05:36.280> have

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
things we actually check for if you have

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:38.370 
things we actually check for if you have
atrial<00:05:36.550> fibrillation<00:05:36.940> and<00:05:37.660> you<00:05:37.960> have<00:05:38.050> a<00:05:38.140> fast

atrial fibrillation and you have a fast

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:39.690 
atrial fibrillation and you have a fast
heart<00:05:38.650> rate<00:05:38.770> is<00:05:38.860> will<00:05:39.040> actually<00:05:39.370> check<00:05:39.550> things

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:39.700 
heart rate is will actually check things

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.910 
heart rate is will actually check things
like<00:05:39.910> your<00:05:40.030> thyroid<00:05:40.390> hormone<00:05:40.810> because<00:05:41.380> if

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:41.920 
like your thyroid hormone because if

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.700 
like your thyroid hormone because if
that's<00:05:42.190> too<00:05:42.460> high<00:05:42.670> it<00:05:43.450> can<00:05:43.840> inspire<00:05:44.080> an<00:05:44.440> attack

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:44.710 
that's too high it can inspire an attack

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:47.220 
that's too high it can inspire an attack
of<00:05:44.950> atrial<00:05:45.220> fibrillation<00:05:45.250> so<00:05:46.060> don't<00:05:47.020> ignore

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230 
of atrial fibrillation so don't ignore

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:48.600 
of atrial fibrillation so don't ignore
the<00:05:47.530> symptoms<00:05:47.950> because<00:05:48.340> there<00:05:48.550> are

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:48.610 
the symptoms because there are
