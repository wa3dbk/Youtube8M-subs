common one we're used to seeing for
troops<00:01:31.350> face<00:01:31.829> printings<00:01:32.460> so<00:01:33.240> nothing<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:33.960> are

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170

troops face printings so nothing to are
there<00:01:34.409> but<00:01:34.650> it's<00:01:34.770> still<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.130> guess<00:01:35.340> an<00:01:35.490> easy<00:01:35.640> way

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
there but it's still I guess an easy way

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490 
there but it's still I guess an easy way

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
for many years I think since 2007 or

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.899 
for many years I think since 2007 or
2008<00:01:46.140> around<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.590> time<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:47.610> can<00:01:47.729> see

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.140 
you want to move it around is not this
way<00:03:08.770> but<00:03:09.040> putting<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.520> like<00:03:09.700> this<00:03:09.910> which<00:03:10.120> is

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
way but putting it like this which is

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.090 
way but putting it like this which is
also<00:03:10.450> accurate<00:03:10.660> to<00:03:10.959> its<00:03:11.080> design<00:03:11.440> in<00:03:11.680> the<00:03:11.800> movie

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
also accurate to its design in the movie

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:13.980 
also accurate to its design in the movie
because<00:03:12.820> it<00:03:13.060> gives<00:03:13.240> no<00:03:13.480> traction<00:03:13.810> whatsoever

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
because it gives no traction whatsoever

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:19.560 
because it gives no traction whatsoever
when<00:03:14.500> you<00:03:14.530> move<00:03:14.709> it<00:03:14.830> up<00:03:14.950> and<00:03:15.130> down<00:03:16.290> and<00:03:18.570> there's

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
when you move it up and down and there's

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:22.740 
when you move it up and down and there's
a<00:03:19.630> look<00:03:19.810> at<00:03:19.930> the<00:03:19.989> front<00:03:20.260> right<00:03:20.440> here<00:03:21.750> overhead

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
a look at the front right here overhead

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:25.290 
a look at the front right here overhead
view<00:03:23.280> like<00:03:24.280> I<00:03:24.400> said<00:03:24.550> those<00:03:24.730> are<00:03:24.760> the<00:03:24.970> missiles

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:25.300 
view like I said those are the missiles

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:28.199 
view like I said those are the missiles
so<00:03:25.420> if<00:03:25.510> you<00:03:25.600> push<00:03:25.810> on<00:03:25.900> this<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:27.730> missiles<00:03:28.060> go

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
so if you push on this the missiles go

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.540 
so if you push on this the missiles go
flying<00:03:28.480> which<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.810> pretty<00:03:28.989> cool<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.830> it's

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
flying which is pretty cool and it's

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:31.949 
flying which is pretty cool and it's
nice<00:03:30.730> to<00:03:30.820> get<00:03:30.970> this<00:03:31.120> piece<00:03:31.390> in<00:03:31.570> this<00:03:31.660> dark

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:31.959 
nice to get this piece in this dark

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:33.360 
nice to get this piece in this dark
brown<00:03:32.230> color<00:03:32.590> because<00:03:32.890> it<00:03:32.980> hasn't<00:03:33.130> come<00:03:33.340> in

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
brown color because it hasn't come in

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.160 
brown color because it hasn't come in
any<00:03:33.550> other<00:03:33.670> sets<00:03:34.000> before<00:03:34.180> in<00:03:34.510> that<00:03:34.750> color<00:03:34.989> so

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
any other sets before in that color so

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:36.930 
any other sets before in that color so
that's<00:03:35.290> really<00:03:35.590> cool<00:03:35.890> as<00:03:36.130> well<00:03:36.670> as<00:03:36.790> getting

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
that's really cool as well as getting

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.550 
that's really cool as well as getting
this<00:03:37.209> piece<00:03:37.480> on<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.690> bottom<00:03:37.900> right<00:03:38.260> here<00:03:38.410> this

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
this piece on the bottom right here this

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.740 
this piece on the bottom right here this
four<00:03:38.830> wide<00:03:39.070> piece<00:03:39.400> in<00:03:39.820> that<00:03:39.880> dark<00:03:40.269> brown<00:03:40.480> and

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
four wide piece in that dark brown and

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.660 
four wide piece in that dark brown and
this<00:03:40.959> triangular<00:03:41.620> plate<00:03:41.980> in<00:03:42.220> that<00:03:42.340> dark<00:03:42.580> brown

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:42.670 
this triangular plate in that dark brown

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.850 
this triangular plate in that dark brown
because<00:03:42.910> those<00:03:43.600> two<00:03:43.930> pieces<00:03:44.140> in<00:03:44.440> those<00:03:44.590> colors

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:44.860 
because those two pieces in those colors

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.170 
because those two pieces in those colors
don't<00:03:45.250> come<00:03:45.430> with<00:03:45.519> many<00:03:45.640> other<00:03:45.820> sets<00:03:46.060> they

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
don't come with many other sets they

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.490 
don't come with many other sets they
only<00:03:46.299> come<00:03:46.450> in<00:03:46.540> like<00:03:46.660> one<00:03:46.930> or<00:03:47.049> two<00:03:47.080> Chima

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
only come in like one or two Chima

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:49.710 
only come in like one or two Chima
that's<00:03:47.769> all<00:03:47.980> together<00:03:48.280> so<00:03:48.640> that's<00:03:49.480> kind<00:03:49.690> of

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
that's all together so that's kind of

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.990 
that's all together so that's kind of
interesting<00:03:50.100> also<00:03:51.100> on<00:03:51.190> the<00:03:51.280> bottom<00:03:51.400> here<00:03:51.820> it's

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
interesting also on the bottom here it's

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.280 
interesting also on the bottom here it's
kind<00:03:52.239> of<00:03:52.269> a<00:03:52.390> view<00:03:52.600> you<00:03:52.660> could<00:03:52.870> see<00:03:53.019> they<00:03:53.140> have

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:53.290 
kind of a view you could see they have

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:54.660 
kind of a view you could see they have
this<00:03:53.410> little<00:03:53.530> blaster<00:03:54.130> design<00:03:54.430> right<00:03:54.640> here

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
this little blaster design right here

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.710 
this little blaster design right here
which<00:03:55.000> is<00:03:55.180> pretty<00:03:55.450> cool<00:03:55.660> I<00:03:55.780> guess<00:03:56.820> and<00:03:57.820> a<00:03:58.299> look

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
which is pretty cool I guess and a look

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.199 
which is pretty cool I guess and a look
at<00:03:58.810> the<00:03:58.900> wheels<00:03:59.140> which<00:03:59.380> wheels<00:04:00.280> in<00:04:00.610> this<00:04:00.760> 10y

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
at the wheels which wheels in this 10y

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.000 
at the wheels which wheels in this 10y
design<00:04:01.600> are<00:04:01.870> very<00:04:02.170> hard<00:04:02.620> to<00:04:02.709> come<00:04:02.950> across

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
design are very hard to come across

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.850 
design are very hard to come across
nowadays<00:04:03.820> especially<00:04:04.360> in<00:04:04.660> this<00:04:04.860> transparent

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:05.860 
nowadays especially in this transparent

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.270 
nowadays especially in this transparent
color<00:04:06.070> and<00:04:07.060> in<00:04:07.600> trans<00:04:07.840> clear<00:04:08.170> it's<00:04:08.799> like<00:04:09.160> ice

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:09.280 
color and in trans clear it's like ice

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.740 
color and in trans clear it's like ice
it's<00:04:09.430> hard<00:04:09.580> to<00:04:09.670> get<00:04:09.790> them<00:04:10.030> but<00:04:10.450> this<00:04:10.600> is

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:10.750 
it's hard to get them but this is

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:12.030 
it's hard to get them but this is
printed<00:04:11.140> right<00:04:11.290> here<00:04:11.350> so<00:04:11.650> this<00:04:11.739> isn't<00:04:11.920> a

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.040 
printed right here so this isn't a

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:13.590 
printed right here so this isn't a
sticker<00:04:12.310> so<00:04:12.430> kind<00:04:12.790> of<00:04:12.850> let<00:04:12.970> me<00:04:13.030> say<00:04:13.209> use<00:04:13.420> of

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
sticker so kind of let me say use of

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.970 
sticker so kind of let me say use of
that<00:04:13.840> piece<00:04:14.110> which<00:04:14.320> I<00:04:14.500> would<00:04:14.650> have<00:04:14.739> preferred

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
that piece which I would have preferred

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.860 
that piece which I would have preferred
if<00:04:15.070> it<00:04:15.190> was<00:04:15.340> not<00:04:15.610> a<00:04:15.640> sticker<00:04:16.030> because<00:04:16.720> of<00:04:16.780> that

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
if it was not a sticker because of that

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.320 
if it was not a sticker because of that
reason<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:18.340> yeah<00:04:18.459> that's<00:04:18.609> really<00:04:18.760> it<00:04:19.000> for<00:04:19.180> the

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
reason but yeah that's really it for the

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:20.490 
reason but yeah that's really it for the
design<00:04:19.510> like<00:04:19.810> I<00:04:19.870> said<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.140> could<00:04:20.260> kind<00:04:20.440> of

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
design like I said you could kind of

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.100 
design like I said you could kind of
move<00:04:20.739> it<00:04:20.890> around<00:04:21.280> it<00:04:21.849> moves<00:04:22.360> pretty<00:04:22.599> well<00:04:22.900> if

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
move it around it moves pretty well if

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.850 
move it around it moves pretty well if
you<00:04:23.200> put<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:23.440> at<00:04:23.530> this

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
you put it at this

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.339 
you put it at this
position<00:04:24.250> you<00:04:25.000> know<00:04:25.120> the<00:04:25.270> wheel<00:04:25.659> the<00:04:26.050> wheel

00:04:26.339 --> 00:04:26.349 
position you know the wheel the wheel

00:04:26.349 --> 00:04:29.999 
position you know the wheel the wheel
parts<00:04:26.830> at<00:04:27.009> this<00:04:27.159> position<00:04:27.340> and<00:04:28.740> yeah<00:04:29.770> you

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:30.009 
parts at this position and yeah you

00:04:30.009 --> 00:04:31.379 
parts at this position and yeah you
can't<00:04:30.219> move<00:04:30.340> these<00:04:30.580> little<00:04:30.729> blasters<00:04:31.300> or

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
can't move these little blasters or

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:32.730 
can't move these little blasters or
anything<00:04:31.569> so<00:04:31.840> they're<00:04:31.990> stuck<00:04:32.199> there<00:04:32.229> but<00:04:32.650> it

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
anything so they're stuck there but it

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.830 
anything so they're stuck there but it
is<00:04:32.860> pretty<00:04:33.069> accurate<00:04:33.280> two<00:04:33.699> of<00:04:34.000> the<00:04:34.180> design<00:04:34.569> in

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:34.840 
is pretty accurate two of the design in

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:36.330 
is pretty accurate two of the design in
the<00:04:34.960> movie<00:04:35.229> not<00:04:35.830> the<00:04:35.949> most<00:04:36.069> interesting

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:36.340 
the movie not the most interesting

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.670 
the movie not the most interesting
vehicle<00:04:36.729> out<00:04:37.090> there<00:04:37.360> but<00:04:37.659> hey<00:04:38.020> I<00:04:38.289> guess<00:04:38.530> it's

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
vehicle out there but hey I guess it's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.040 
vehicle out there but hey I guess it's
kind<00:04:38.860> of<00:04:38.889> faithful<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.729> movie<00:04:39.969> design<00:04:40.300> so

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:41.050 
kind of faithful to the movie design so

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.020 
kind of faithful to the movie design so
