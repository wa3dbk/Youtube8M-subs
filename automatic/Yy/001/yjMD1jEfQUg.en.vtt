pull straight back I'm going to see if I
can<00:00:59.219> get<00:00:59.399> any<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.699> this<00:01:00.949> air<00:01:01.949> duct<00:01:02.280> work<00:01:02.940> out<00:01:03.210> of

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
can get any of this air duct work out of

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.479 
can get any of this air duct work out of
the<00:01:03.390> way<00:01:03.539> I'll<00:01:03.809> start<00:01:04.140> with<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.409> screw<00:01:05.070> right

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
the way I'll start with that screw right

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:08.780 
the way I'll start with that screw right
up<00:01:05.810> there<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.290> then<00:01:07.860> there's<00:01:08.100> some<00:01:08.369> plastic

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
up there and then there's some plastic

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.170 
up there and then there's some plastic
Clips<00:01:11.299> there's<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.420> screw<00:01:13.049> underneath<00:01:14.180> holding

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
Clips there's a screw underneath holding

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.370 
Clips there's a screw underneath holding
this<00:01:16.790> duct<00:01:17.790> work<00:01:18.060> this<00:01:18.420> plastic<00:01:18.930> duct<00:01:19.140> work

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
this duct work this plastic duct work

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.030 
this duct work this plastic duct work
it's<00:01:20.009> it's<00:01:20.780> basically<00:01:21.780> two<00:01:22.080> pieces<00:01:22.560> an<00:01:22.740> upper

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
it's it's basically two pieces an upper

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.810 
it's it's basically two pieces an upper
piece<00:01:23.280> here<00:01:23.759> which<00:01:24.570> I've<00:01:24.780> been<00:01:25.369> fighting<00:01:26.369> for

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
piece here which I've been fighting for

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.460 
piece here which I've been fighting for
a<00:01:26.880> while<00:01:27.090> and<00:01:27.450> then<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.659> lower<00:01:27.930> piece<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.409> I

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
a while and then a lower piece and I

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:35.200 
a while and then a lower piece and I
just<00:01:28.680> realized<00:01:29.000> this<00:01:30.000> lower<00:01:30.240> piece<00:01:31.280> well

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.760 

lower<00:01:36.210> piece<00:01:36.479> has<00:01:36.720> a<00:01:36.750> screw<00:01:37.490> holding<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.909> up<00:01:39.570> to

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
lower piece has a screw holding it up to

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.670 
lower piece has a screw holding it up to
the<00:01:40.770> blower<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.369> think<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.700> is<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:41.970> blower<00:01:42.680> so

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
the blower I think this is the blower so

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.670 
the blower I think this is the blower so
take<00:01:43.860> that<00:01:44.040> screw<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.640> one<00:01:45.000> screw<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.720> then

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
take that screw out one screw and then

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:50.060 
take that screw out one screw and then
this<00:01:46.829> lower<00:01:47.189> ductwork<00:01:47.790> will<00:01:48.780> come<00:01:49.049> down<00:01:49.350> out

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
this lower ductwork will come down out

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:55.580 
this lower ductwork will come down out
of<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.399> way<00:01:52.250> you<00:01:53.250> follow<00:01:53.549> me<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.439> you<00:01:55.439> can

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
of the way you follow me and you can

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.380 
of the way you follow me and you can
even<00:01:55.799> leave<00:01:55.920> it<00:01:56.009> plugged<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.430> I<00:01:56.640> guess<00:01:57.259> and<00:01:58.259> now

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
even leave it plugged in I guess and now

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.590 
even leave it plugged in I guess and now
we're<00:02:00.390> getting<00:02:00.540> a<00:02:00.689> much<00:02:00.719> better<00:02:00.869> view<00:02:01.560> of<00:02:01.890> the

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
we're getting a much better view of the

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.209 
we're getting a much better view of the
motor<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.170> to<00:02:04.259> take<00:02:04.409> out<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.799> servo

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
motor that I want to take out the servo

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.469 
motor that I want to take out the servo
they<00:02:05.430> call<00:02:05.640> them<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.790> servo

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
they call them a servo

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.400 
they call them a servo
and<00:02:08.319> that<00:02:08.770> upper<00:02:09.390> piece<00:02:10.390> of<00:02:10.599> ductwork<00:02:10.959> can

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410 
and that upper piece of ductwork can

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.890 
and that upper piece of ductwork can
stay<00:02:11.739> you<00:02:12.310> don't<00:02:12.550> need<00:02:12.819> to<00:02:13.000> move<00:02:13.180> that<00:02:15.900> you

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
stay you don't need to move that you

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.960 
stay you don't need to move that you
might<00:02:17.110> take<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.500> one<00:02:17.769> screw<00:02:18.250> out<00:02:18.280> up<00:02:18.700> there

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
might take that one screw out up there

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.660 
might take that one screw out up there
and<00:02:21.970> that<00:02:22.569> will<00:02:22.690> let<00:02:22.840> it<00:02:23.190> better<00:02:24.190> let<00:02:24.400> it<00:02:24.519> move

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
and that will let it better let it move

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.740 
and that will let it better let it move
a<00:02:24.819> little<00:02:24.970> bit<00:02:25.950> see<00:02:26.950> what<00:02:27.069> I<00:02:27.130> mean<00:02:27.280> now<00:02:30.750> looking

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
at this I see two screws and I see the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.559 
at this I see two screws and I see the
two<00:02:36.040> pipes<00:02:37.349> hmm<00:02:38.940> I'm<00:02:39.940> going<00:02:40.060> to<00:02:40.150> try<00:02:40.330> to<00:02:40.360> figure

00:04:53.409 --> 00:04:53.419 
thing is kind of frozen up I don't know

00:04:53.419 --> 00:04:55.060 
thing is kind of frozen up I don't know
if<00:04:53.660> it's<00:04:53.810> supposed<00:04:54.080> to<00:04:54.200> be<00:04:54.320> frozen<00:04:54.530> up<00:04:54.830> or<00:04:54.950> not

if it's supposed to be frozen up or not

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.760 
if it's supposed to be frozen up or not
I'm<00:04:55.250> going<00:04:55.340> to<00:04:55.400> have<00:04:55.460> to<00:04:55.640> test<00:04:55.910> this<00:04:56.090> unit<00:04:56.450> now

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
I'm going to have to test this unit now

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.650 
I'm going to have to test this unit now
what<00:04:57.770> it<00:04:58.550> controls<00:04:59.240> is<00:04:59.990> a<00:05:00.860> door<00:05:01.460> I<00:05:01.880> think<00:05:02.480> it's

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:02.660 
what it controls is a door I think it's

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.620 
what it controls is a door I think it's
like<00:05:02.930> a<00:05:02.960> heat<00:05:03.380> cold<00:05:03.680> or<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.400> heater<00:05:04.669> the<00:05:05.090> cooling

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
like a heat cold or a heater the cooling

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.800 
like a heat cold or a heater the cooling
door<00:05:06.460> is<00:05:07.460> shining<00:05:07.910> the<00:05:08.000> light<00:05:08.300> up<00:05:08.540> there<00:05:08.570> a

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:08.810 
door is shining the light up there a

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:13.930 
door is shining the light up there a
little<00:05:09.020> bit<00:05:11.560> there<00:05:12.560> and<00:05:12.890> I'm<00:05:13.639> going<00:05:13.760> to<00:05:13.820> take

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:13.940 
little bit there and I'm going to take
