00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:10.290
 hello you must have seen recently 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.090
 our presentation video dedicated 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.980
 several payment forms there at 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.960
 demonstrated the most powerful server on 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.480
 the base of two 12 ice all in 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.550
 modern as well as 256 gigabytes 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.470
 RAM many of you 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 probably wondering how is going to 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.970
 such systems and in this video we give you 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.739
 show it though the principle is the same here 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.630
 like in desktop computers but not 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:32.489
 less take into account the specifics of servers and 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 the freshness of this trend is on our 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 channel we decided to share with you 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.100
 build processes of this server on 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.899
 example of this short video you 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:42.000
 familiarize yourself with the general principles of 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.859
 server builds in our case 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.749
 the supermicro platform is featured 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:47.940
 which means that the motherboard and 

00:00:45.749 --> 00:00:49.559
 power supplies are already built into the case and 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.510
 the only thing left for us is 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.760
 install hard drives processor and 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.589
 RAM at installation 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.030
 CPU need to be very careful 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.550
 and neat and set it to 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.829
 according to the marks on the socket not 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.690
 damaging the teeth of the connector itself 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.880
 the next step is to prepare 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.040
 server processor new cooler in our 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.390
 case thermal grease already applied from the factory 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.860
 and we can only screw 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.200
 necessary fixings 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.180
 server cooler usually very small 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.159
 in size but don't let that knock you off 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.110
 sense their effectiveness specifically 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.540
 calculated and achieved by 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.170
 increased revolutions that reach 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.460
 sometimes 4 or 5 thousand revolutions per minute 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.560
 since in the server usually no one 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.390
 pays attention to the noise figure 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 this is the most important efficiency and 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.860
 cooling quality plus everything inside 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.530
 enclosures with special high 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.909
 revving case fans 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.159
 creates a very strong air flow 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:43.500
 which contributes to a large influx 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.600
 cold air and strong circulation 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.880
 inside the case so hot air 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.950
 here, in fact, does not have time to accumulate 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:51.659
 the next step is to install 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.789
 RAM on the motherboard 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.039
 there is a markup in which to put sweet 

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:58.380
 RAM if the memory strip 

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.289
 less than the salts themselves but in ours 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.080
 case we have 256 gigabytes of operational 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:05.810
 memory so we just scored 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.000
 m all slots the next step becomes 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.430
 installation of special server hard 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.770
 high reliability drives in our 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:15.710
 case is seagate with model 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.510
 constellation and with server machine for 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:20.000
 increase reliability hard drives 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:20.810
 unite in fish our system did not become 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.030
 except for 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.850
 besides the usual hard drives we also 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.530
 used ssd from intel in machines 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:29.120
 of this class are commonly used 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.700
 special high-speed 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.770
 highly reliable northern sysk but 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.510
 their cost is usually surpasses give in 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.030
 our version was not necessary 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.280
 land of this class therefore in our 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.590
 the case was chosen by the usual home ssd 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:45.410
 from intel which are considered the most 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.320
 reliable in home solutions market 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:50.660
 our version is from ezgio templ 730 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:52.790
 series on four hundred eighty gigabytes 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.830
 Well, the last step of our assembly 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.020
 server will be setting a special 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.120
 panels which roughly speaking helps 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:01.280
 create a separate directional air 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.800
 channel to create a strong flow 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:05.930
 air on the screen you see how will 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.660
 pass air flow inside the closed 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.660
 shell and of course the moment of inclusion 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:24.330
 as you can see at the time of inclusion 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.370
 fan turns on full 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.050
 power in principle as in ordinary 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.810
 computers but after loading 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.640
 fans are slowing down on this 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:34.620
 Today everything reminds me that 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 servers and ready platforms you can 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.970
 order on the website kp.ru 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.300
 Thank you all for your attention and see you in 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.300
 new reviews
