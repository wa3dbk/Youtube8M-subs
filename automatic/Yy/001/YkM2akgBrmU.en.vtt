00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:16.550 

you<00:02:14.849> can<00:02:15.000> already<00:02:15.120> see<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.840> by<00:02:16.079> doing<00:02:16.290> that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
you can already see that by doing that

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.899 
you can already see that by doing that
they<00:02:17.489> slowly<00:02:18.060> started<00:02:18.629> to<00:02:18.810> become<00:02:19.909> releasing

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:20.909 
they slowly started to become releasing

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.220 
they slowly started to become releasing
their<00:02:21.030> oils<00:02:21.390> they're<00:02:21.599> starting<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.900> clump<00:02:22.049> up

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
their oils they're starting to clump up

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.289 
their oils they're starting to clump up
a<00:02:22.349> little<00:02:22.530> bit<00:02:22.680> which<00:02:22.829> is<00:02:22.859> exactly<00:02:23.430> what<00:02:24.180> we

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299 
a little bit which is exactly what we

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:27.170 
a little bit which is exactly what we
want<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.599> happen<00:02:25.489> what<00:02:26.489> I<00:02:26.519> am<00:02:26.640> going<00:02:26.790> to<00:02:26.849> do<00:02:26.969> now

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
want to happen what I am going to do now

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.429 
want to happen what I am going to do now
though<00:02:27.420> since<00:02:27.689> they<00:02:27.810> are<00:02:27.900> starting<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.319> do

00:02:28.429 --> 00:02:28.439 
though since they are starting to do

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:29.330 
though since they are starting to do
that<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.799> I<00:02:28.859> know<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.069> they're

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
that and I know that they're

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.250 
that and I know that they're
store-bought<00:02:29.609> not<00:02:30.000> fresh<00:02:30.390> is<00:02:30.959> I'm<00:02:31.109> going<00:02:31.200> to

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
store-bought not fresh is I'm going to

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.550 
store-bought not fresh is I'm going to
add<00:02:31.409> about<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.769> teaspoon<00:02:32.069> of<00:02:32.459> my<00:02:32.939> oil<00:02:32.970> here<00:02:33.659> to

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
add about a teaspoon of my oil here to

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.640 
add about a teaspoon of my oil here to
it<00:02:38.060> if<00:02:39.060> you<00:02:39.239> need<00:02:39.389> to<00:02:39.480> add<00:02:39.599> more<00:02:39.870> do<00:02:40.139> it<00:02:40.170> but<00:02:40.439> try

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
it if you need to add more do it but try

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:55.220 
it if you need to add more do it but try
and<00:02:40.709> go<00:02:40.829> a<00:02:40.859> teaspoon<00:02:41.310> at<00:02:41.430> a<00:02:41.489> time

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:55.230 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.420 

again<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.349> may<00:02:56.470> have<00:02:56.560> to<00:02:56.680> stop<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.220> do<00:02:57.310> this

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
again you may have to stop and do this

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:03.330 
again you may have to stop and do this
occasionally<00:03:01.470> you<00:03:02.470> can<00:03:02.620> already<00:03:02.980> see<00:03:03.310> that

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
occasionally you can already see that

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.100 
occasionally you can already see that
peanut<00:03:03.700> butter<00:03:03.819> coming<00:03:04.269> together<00:03:04.450> there<00:03:04.840> look

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
peanut butter coming together there look

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.440 
peanut butter coming together there look
at<00:03:05.230> that<00:03:11.099> you<00:03:12.099> can<00:03:12.250> see<00:03:12.459> those<00:03:12.790> peanuts

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:13.450 
at that you can see those peanuts

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:18.110 
at that you can see those peanuts
slowly<00:03:14.079> but<00:03:14.260> surely<00:03:14.319> become<00:03:14.890> peanut<00:03:15.310> butter

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.030 

now<00:03:19.120> I'm<00:03:19.299> going<00:03:19.420> to<00:03:19.480> add<00:03:19.569> a<00:03:19.599> few<00:03:19.900> more<00:03:20.040> peanuts

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.040 
now I'm going to add a few more peanuts

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.490 
now I'm going to add a few more peanuts

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
to this actually no I'm not I'm going to

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.930 
to this actually no I'm not I'm going to
add<00:03:23.590> just<00:03:23.709> a<00:03:23.829> little<00:03:23.860> bit<00:03:24.069> more<00:03:24.280> oil<00:03:24.310> I<00:03:26.879> want<00:03:27.879> to

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
make sure I'm not burning out my motor

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:30.780 
make sure I'm not burning out my motor
here<00:03:29.739> because<00:03:29.980> I<00:03:30.010> can<00:03:30.160> already<00:03:30.400> started<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:30.790 
here because I can already started to

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:34.050 
here because I can already started to
see<00:03:30.970> it<00:03:31.060> do<00:03:31.180> its<00:03:31.329> thing<00:03:31.739> so<00:03:32.739> i'ma<00:03:32.829> go<00:03:32.920> a<00:03:33.250> little

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
see it do its thing so i'ma go a little

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:47.550 
see it do its thing so i'ma go a little
bit<00:03:34.180> at<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.299> time

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.990 

same<00:03:48.560> thing<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:49.370> this<00:03:49.520> a<00:03:49.580> little<00:03:49.730> bit<00:03:49.880> of<00:03:49.940> a

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:50.000 
same thing is this a little bit of a

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.570 
same thing is this a little bit of a
process<00:03:50.209> but<00:03:50.620> you'll<00:03:51.620> love<00:03:51.920> what<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.370> get

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 
process but you'll love what you get

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:53.680

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
process it through this way when I get

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.040 
process it through this way when I get
that<00:03:55.100> creaminess<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:55.970> kind<00:03:56.630> of<00:03:56.660> get<00:03:56.840> all

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:00.740 
those little extra tiny chunks of peanut

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:08.250 
those little extra tiny chunks of peanut
butter<00:04:01.040> out<00:04:01.370> of<00:04:01.550> there<00:04:01.840> there<00:04:02.840> you<00:04:02.930> go

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.479 

now<00:04:09.260> that's<00:04:09.590> there<00:04:09.830> I'm<00:04:09.950> also<00:04:10.100> going<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.340> add<00:04:10.459> a

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
now that's there I'm also going to add a

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.280 
now that's there I'm also going to add a
little<00:04:10.640> bit<00:04:10.760> of<00:04:10.850> honey<00:04:11.030> now<00:04:11.239> you<00:04:11.930> can<00:04:12.080> do<00:04:12.170> it

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
little bit of honey now you can do it

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.199 
little bit of honey now you can do it
outside<00:04:12.680> of<00:04:12.739> the<00:04:12.830> processor<00:04:13.430> in<00:04:13.670> the<00:04:13.760> process

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
outside of the processor in the process

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.060 
outside of the processor in the process
or<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:14.420> usually<00:04:14.690> like<00:04:14.780> to<00:04:14.840> do<00:04:14.930> it<00:04:15.050> in<00:04:15.260> at<00:04:15.800> least<00:04:15.980> I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070 
or I usually like to do it in at least I

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.640 
or I usually like to do it in at least I
know<00:04:16.130> it'll<00:04:16.430> mix<00:04:17.200> usually<00:04:18.200> anywhere<00:04:18.470> from

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
know it'll mix usually anywhere from

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.409 
know it'll mix usually anywhere from
about<00:04:18.829> a<00:04:18.919> teaspoon<00:04:19.459> to<00:04:19.579> two<00:04:19.760> teaspoons<00:04:20.269> of

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
about a teaspoon to two teaspoons of

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.300 
about a teaspoon to two teaspoons of
honey<00:04:20.600> will<00:04:20.959> do<00:04:21.169> just<00:04:21.799> add<00:04:21.950> a<00:04:21.980> little<00:04:22.160> bit<00:04:22.280> of

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
honey will do just add a little bit of

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:23.710 
honey will do just add a little bit of
flavor<00:04:22.580> but<00:04:22.790> you<00:04:22.970> kind<00:04:23.360> of<00:04:23.390> want<00:04:23.540> to<00:04:23.570> go<00:04:23.660> to
