00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:06.740
 for dad for more 

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:09.970
 with the girls today we are going to recycle 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:12.530
 old mines abuses can also be 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.070
 through the technique of working is a 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:18.020
 Total pavada is simply to find 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.060
 a printer that first paper tram 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.610
 persistence the 70 phrases all always 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.590
 It has a trap role but good is 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.900
 question of asking 

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:29.960
 then find a printing press to choose 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.520
 what do we want to stamp as ' us to your 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.830
 new correct to recycle the shirts 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.920
 because as it is used a lot in the 

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.440
 blondes and written good with this technique 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:41.989
 the first that we can recycle a 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:44.360
 T-shirt that we have old that we no longer 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.980
 like it more and we can also write what 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.220
 that we want that is good 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.270
 if one does not know how to use design programs 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:55.800
 it does not matter they write in big good word 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.900
 with bold letters whatever they want 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.079
 write last and the printing press 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.320
 they say look is for this shirt I need 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.170
 Let this high water be of this width 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:08.150
 you can also print images 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.290
 what they want they can look for images 

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:14.790
 that they like 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.550
 we pass is very simple then 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.910
 t-shirts raffles printing on paper 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:23.250
 iron lamp and it's good 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.500
 we started with the tips of it is very easy 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.020
 this technique is a dick but it has 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:31.830
 certain little things that we have to know in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:34.340
 principle that the fabric the t-shirts the 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.650
 Busts the appetite what they want 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:40.780
 stamp has to be clear because the 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:43.930
 transfer does not transmit blank or 

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.750
 it can be white gray striped or whatever 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.940
 who want it to be clear and also 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.720
 keep in mind that you do not transfer a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.759
 very powerful color let's say it's more like 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:59.200
 washing looks great for example 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:01.100
 written is very good but good is the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.560
 reality of this transfer paper 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.990
 what they would have to do what they 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.270
 should be done in this case is 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:11.090
 take the leaf as much as possible to me 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.550
 is oscar of this size a3 I got 50 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.390
 weights I thought it was 4 that's why I occupied 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:19.819
 only size a4 so my mistake if I 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:22.670
 I would have known had put many more 

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:24.470
 images to stamp more things and 

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.959
 then with 50 pesos have for 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.090
 stamp I do not know what you want 8 remedies 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.319
 depending on the design because I grab 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.330
 now and cut out I do not know the mouths I want 

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:38.750
 that they go for example if it wanted that 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:41.569
 go in four different shirts the 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.519
 as here back I suppose I would have you 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.470
 when ramÃ­rez cut and in each shirt 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:46.850
 I'm putting what I want nothing more like that 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.330
 that a sheet of these can be 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:53.620
 seize a lot 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:56.350
 good otherwise the transfer is a very 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:01.290
 good technique but it is homemade not us 

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:01.290
 serves to make in production 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.320
 it's a technique that is to recycle one 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:08.490
 is going to recycle a shirt and it's not going to 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:12.660
 last forever 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.220
 let's say the hand because although it lasts 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:16.470
 because I have shirts that he has done 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.640
 with this technique they have lasted me a lot 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:22.610
 good is a home-made technique 

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:25.490
 so that is clear that for 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.430
 do not call our attention be the long 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:32.000
 30,000 after destination washings 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.770
 can pass good I'll start to 

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.890
 I'll show you how to iron 

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:40.760
 the good ticket I'm going to start with the 

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.370
 white muscle with which I decided 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.390
 happy transformers 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:46.390
 a song 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:54.340
 I put the good article in 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:58.290
 like the table or wherever 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.290
 they have to have the iron 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:08.620
 cut out with the few centimeters under 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:12.360
 of the neck because muscle will be provided 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:12.360
 this measure where I wanted to do it 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:20.850
 you always want marquez marquez 

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:31.180
 in the text 

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:46.030
 more than anything began cutting hours of 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.390
 angles nothing else all the rest of the 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:48.390
 stains 

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:56.630
 Vegetable or good paper can put a 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:59.110
 towel in the middle 

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.110
 Y 

00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.330
 yes 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.310
 let's give it 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.310
 very much heat with the iron 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.300
 x 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:26.690
 father dad for tandas for dad dad 

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:26.690
 for for rods 

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:34.139
 we have 

00:05:35.529 --> 00:05:41.980
 the first printed shirt of the day 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:41.980
 we follow 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:51.580
 good now the rebel animal print him 

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:53.930
 let's stamp the sachets 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.820
 break 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:58.830
 good is to show you how to 

00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:02.460
 stamp the clarity part unlike 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:06.170
 of the dark part but that both the 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:06.170
 animal for good that effect 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:17.950
 and those things left me 

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:24.700
 there I finished the animal print with the 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:27.070
 nozzles has to see how a 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:31.480
 simple animal print 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:33.790
 asserted with the images above what 

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.150
 we can fill what we can put what 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:40.360
 we wanted but I wanted you to see how 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:44.760
 they change though with a pavada second of 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:48.120
 time how they change what we already 

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:48.120
 we did before 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:54.559
 We hope you liked this 

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:59.589
 put it into practice because it 's very very 

00:06:54.559 --> 00:07:03.159
 easy very simple and good that you like and 

00:06:59.589 --> 00:07:03.159
 chau see you later
