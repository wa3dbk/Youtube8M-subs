now<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.370> between<00:03:22.790> layers<00:03:23.329> I<00:03:23.630> always<00:03:23.900> suggest

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
now in between layers I always suggest

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.310 
now in between layers I always suggest
to<00:03:24.530> use<00:03:24.799> a<00:03:25.010> tack<00:03:25.220> cloth<00:03:25.810> like<00:03:26.810> white<00:03:27.079> white

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:27.320 
to use a tack cloth like white white

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.650 
to use a tack cloth like white white
white<00:03:27.500> white<00:03:27.769> white<00:03:28.100> white<00:03:28.519> and<00:03:28.970> there<00:03:29.540> you

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
white white white white and there you

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:35.039 
white white white white and there you
have<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.109> okay<00:03:31.070> now<00:03:31.750> traditionally<00:03:32.769> the<00:03:33.769> way

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
have it okay now traditionally the way

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.840 
have it okay now traditionally the way
most<00:03:37.959> you<00:03:38.959> know<00:03:39.079> varnishes<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:40.040> the<00:03:40.250> pour<00:03:40.730> it

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
most you know varnishes like the pour it

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.120 
most you know varnishes like the pour it
in<00:03:41.000> and<00:03:41.359> you<00:03:41.900> can<00:03:42.049> port<00:03:42.350> it<00:03:42.440> it<00:03:42.590> into<00:03:43.100> a

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
in and you can port it it into a

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:45.910 
in and you can port it it into a
container<00:03:43.730> okay<00:03:44.690> you<00:03:45.019> can<00:03:45.350> pour<00:03:45.590> it<00:03:45.620> in<00:03:45.769> there

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
container okay you can pour it in there

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.539 
container okay you can pour it in there
and<00:03:46.130> it<00:03:46.820> says<00:03:47.060> to<00:03:47.329> put<00:03:47.359> one<00:03:48.109> to<00:03:48.290> four<00:03:48.560> one<00:03:49.160> part

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
and it says to put one to four one part

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.580 
and it says to put one to four one part
water<00:03:50.540> four<00:03:50.989> parts

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
water four parts

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:55.960 
water four parts
varnish<00:03:52.450> mix<00:03:53.450> but<00:03:54.350> then<00:03:54.500> you<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:55.280> have<00:03:55.549> to<00:03:55.730> mix

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
varnish mix but then you you have to mix

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:58.259 
varnish mix but then you you have to mix
it<00:03:56.180> slowly<00:03:56.450> so<00:03:56.810> there's<00:03:57.019> no<00:03:57.200> bubbles<00:03:57.590> I

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
it slowly so there's no bubbles I

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:03.130 
it slowly so there's no bubbles I
suggest<00:03:59.269> for<00:03:59.630> my<00:04:00.470> my<00:04:00.980> canvases<00:04:01.579> to<00:04:02.359> use<00:04:02.630> it<00:04:02.900> as

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
suggest for my my canvases to use it as

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:07.840 
suggest for my my canvases to use it as
is<00:04:03.829> and<00:04:04.220> not<00:04:04.430> dilute<00:04:05.000> it<00:04:05.209> um<00:04:06.190> you<00:04:07.190> know<00:04:07.340> maybe

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
is and not dilute it um you know maybe

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:10.300 
is and not dilute it um you know maybe
maybe<00:04:08.359> there's<00:04:08.690> some<00:04:09.560> day<00:04:09.769> I'll<00:04:09.919> figure<00:04:10.160> out

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:10.310 
maybe there's some day I'll figure out

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:11.920 
maybe there's some day I'll figure out
why

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:11.930 
why

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:15.580 
why
one<00:04:12.650> two<00:04:13.580> four<00:04:13.610> is<00:04:14.180> a<00:04:14.209> great<00:04:14.599> thing<00:04:14.870> and<00:04:15.110> why

00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:15.590 
one two four is a great thing and why

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.680 
one two four is a great thing and why
just<00:04:16.750> using<00:04:17.750> it<00:04:17.900> directly<00:04:18.729> might<00:04:19.729> I<00:04:19.970> suspect

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:20.690 
just using it directly might I suspect

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:23.080 
just using it directly might I suspect
that<00:04:20.810> it's<00:04:21.290> because<00:04:21.709> there's<00:04:22.160> more<00:04:22.400> water<00:04:22.580> and

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
that it's because there's more water and

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:25.180 
that it's because there's more water and
it's<00:04:23.360> heavier<00:04:23.900> it<00:04:24.260> just<00:04:24.680> makes<00:04:24.860> it<00:04:24.949> a<00:04:25.040> little

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:25.190 
it's heavier it just makes it a little

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:28.960 
it's heavier it just makes it a little
bit<00:04:25.370> heavier<00:04:25.729> onto<00:04:26.300> your<00:04:26.510> canvas<00:04:27.139> so<00:04:27.740> I<00:04:27.979> just

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:28.970 
bit heavier onto your canvas so I just

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:33.670 
bit heavier onto your canvas so I just
like<00:04:29.180> using<00:04:29.870> it<00:04:30.320> straight<00:04:31.389> now<00:04:32.389> you<00:04:32.449> can<00:04:33.169> pour

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:33.680 
like using it straight now you can pour

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.080 
like using it straight now you can pour
it<00:04:33.800> into<00:04:34.100> a<00:04:34.850> container<00:04:36.250> such<00:04:37.250> as<00:04:37.280> this<00:04:37.699> and<00:04:38.060> you

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
it into a container such as this and you

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:41.640 
it into a container such as this and you
can<00:04:39.080> take<00:04:39.290> your<00:04:39.320> sponge<00:04:40.100> brush<00:04:40.490> and<00:04:40.760> then

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:41.650 
can take your sponge brush and then

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:47.909 
can take your sponge brush and then
apply<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.850> okay<00:04:43.850> I<00:04:44.260> suggest<00:04:45.260> another<00:04:45.680> way<00:04:45.949> I

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:47.919 
apply it okay I suggest another way I

00:04:47.919 --> 00:04:51.990 
apply it okay I suggest another way I
suggest<00:04:48.919> you<00:04:49.280> get<00:04:49.430> a<00:04:50.320> sponge

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:52.000 
suggest you get a sponge

use these sponge brushes it has a nice
little<00:04:57.800> wedge<00:04:58.190> to<00:04:58.610> it<00:04:58.760> so<00:04:59.510> it<00:04:59.960> and<00:05:00.650> I<00:05:01.010> don't

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:05.020 
little wedge to it so it and I don't
even<00:05:01.639> press<00:05:02.300> that<00:05:02.840> hard<00:05:03.110> I<00:05:03.289> just<00:05:03.320> lay<00:05:03.770> it<00:05:04.030> lay

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
even press that hard I just lay it lay

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.570 
even press that hard I just lay it lay
my<00:05:05.240> varnish<00:05:05.600> down<00:05:05.810> and<00:05:06.080> I<00:05:06.139> gently<00:05:06.500> glide<00:05:07.370> it

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
my varnish down and I gently glide it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.930 
my varnish down and I gently glide it
along<00:05:07.940> until<00:05:08.210> it's<00:05:08.900> evenly<00:05:09.320> distributed<00:05:09.940> okay

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:10.940 
along until it's evenly distributed okay

00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:18.760 
along until it's evenly distributed okay
and<00:05:11.240> here<00:05:11.660> we<00:05:11.780> go<00:05:16.660> okay<00:05:17.660> so<00:05:17.720> there<00:05:18.169> we<00:05:18.289> go<00:05:18.320> it's

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:18.770 
and here we go okay so there we go it's

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:21.010 
and here we go okay so there we go it's
coming<00:05:19.099> and<00:05:19.550> you<00:05:19.639> know<00:05:19.760> I<00:05:19.789> poured<00:05:20.330> it<00:05:20.479> on<00:05:20.660> and

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
coming and you know I poured it on and

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:25.360 
coming and you know I poured it on and
now<00:05:21.740> I'm<00:05:22.280> giving<00:05:23.060> it<00:05:23.210> even<00:05:23.900> distribution<00:05:24.370> why

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:25.370 
now I'm giving it even distribution why

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:28.330 
now I'm giving it even distribution why
do<00:05:25.430> I<00:05:25.639> do<00:05:25.700> it<00:05:25.880> this<00:05:26.120> way<00:05:26.330> because<00:05:26.599> if<00:05:27.590> I<00:05:27.860> start

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
do I do it this way because if I start

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.020 
do I do it this way because if I start
at<00:05:28.490> the<00:05:28.639> top<00:05:28.940> and<00:05:29.830> start<00:05:30.830> painting<00:05:31.220> on<00:05:31.610> the

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 
at the top and start painting on the

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.010 
at the top and start painting on the
varnish<00:05:32.450> by<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.780> time<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.080> get<00:05:33.320> to<00:05:33.349> the<00:05:33.590> bottom

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:35.020 
varnish by the time I get to the bottom

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.940 
varnish by the time I get to the bottom
the<00:05:36.020> top<00:05:36.260> is<00:05:36.500> dry<00:05:36.800> what<00:05:37.669> I<00:05:37.729> like<00:05:38.240> to<00:05:38.450> do<00:05:38.660> and<00:05:39.020> on

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:39.950 
the top is dry what I like to do and on

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.040 
the top is dry what I like to do and on
this<00:05:40.160> first<00:05:40.370> pass<00:05:40.760> is<00:05:41.240> actually<00:05:41.870> distributed

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:44.050 
this first pass is actually distributed

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.469 
this first pass is actually distributed
and<00:05:45.050> then<00:05:45.949> once<00:05:46.130> it's<00:05:46.280> all<00:05:46.490> distributed<00:05:49.479> you

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:50.479 
and then once it's all distributed you

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:53.830 
and then once it's all distributed you
go<00:05:50.690> in<00:05:50.960> one<00:05:51.229> direction<00:05:52.360> then<00:05:53.360> you<00:05:53.419> go<00:05:53.690> in

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:53.840 
go in one direction then you go in

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.860 
go in one direction then you go in
another<00:05:54.050> direction<00:05:54.370> okay<00:05:55.370> and<00:05:55.880> don't<00:05:56.510> forget

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:56.870 
another direction okay and don't forget

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.839 
another direction okay and don't forget
about<00:05:56.930> the<00:05:57.289> sides<00:05:57.560> okay

00:05:58.839 --> 00:05:58.849 
about the sides okay

00:05:58.849 --> 00:06:04.060 
about the sides okay
this<00:05:59.449> is<00:05:59.630> a<00:05:59.660> smaller<00:06:00.199> painting<00:06:00.860> and<00:06:02.020> I<00:06:03.070> believe

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.070 
this is a smaller painting and I believe

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:07.960 
this is a smaller painting and I believe
it's<00:06:04.280> 12<00:06:04.610> by<00:06:04.729> 16<00:06:05.090> um<00:06:06.220> so<00:06:07.220> it's<00:06:07.520> you<00:06:07.820> know<00:06:07.940> it's

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:07.970 
it's 12 by 16 um so it's you know it's

00:06:07.970 --> 00:06:09.760 
it's 12 by 16 um so it's you know it's
easy<00:06:08.270> to<00:06:08.840> do<00:06:08.960> this<00:06:09.110> coverage<00:06:09.410> but<00:06:09.530> if<00:06:09.650> you're

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
easy to do this coverage but if you're

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:14.110 
easy to do this coverage but if you're
painting<00:06:10.220> a<00:06:10.340> larger<00:06:10.760> painting<00:06:11.030> um<00:06:12.490> it<00:06:13.490> takes<00:06:13.880> a

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:14.120 
painting a larger painting um it takes a

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.200 
painting a larger painting um it takes a
little<00:06:14.389> longer<00:06:15.160> so<00:06:16.160> I'm<00:06:16.610> happy

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
little longer so I'm happy

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:20.700 
little longer so I'm happy
smaller<00:06:17.889> okay<00:06:18.889> here<00:06:19.130> we<00:06:19.220> go<00:06:19.250> one<00:06:19.699> two<00:06:20.300> three

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:20.710 
smaller okay here we go one two three

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.590 
smaller okay here we go one two three
and<00:06:21.710> then<00:06:22.160> all<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.669> way<00:06:22.759> around<00:06:23.060> all<00:06:23.389> the<00:06:23.449> way

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:23.600 
and then all the way around all the way

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.749 
and then all the way around all the way
around<00:06:23.690> all<00:06:24.289> the<00:06:24.319> way<00:06:24.410> around<00:06:24.530> okay<00:06:25.160> so<00:06:25.370> don't

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
around all the way around okay so don't

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:31.120 
around all the way around okay so don't
forget<00:06:26.289> one<00:06:27.289> direction<00:06:28.069> one<00:06:28.810> two<00:06:30.009> starting<00:06:31.009> to

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:31.130 
forget one direction one two starting to

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:34.809 
forget one direction one two starting to
dry<00:06:31.340> on<00:06:31.550> me<00:06:31.759> three<00:06:32.710> okay<00:06:33.710> and<00:06:34.009> then<00:06:34.280> and<00:06:34.550> then

00:06:34.809 --> 00:06:34.819 
dry on me three okay and then and then

00:06:34.819 --> 00:06:37.570 
dry on me three okay and then and then
you<00:06:34.940> can<00:06:35.090> go<00:06:35.270> another<00:06:35.660> direction<00:06:35.900> okay<00:06:36.830> so

00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:37.580 
you can go another direction okay so

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:40.900 
you can go another direction okay so
that's<00:06:37.819> it<00:06:38.120> for<00:06:38.330> varnishing<00:06:38.930> and<00:06:39.910> you're

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
that's it for varnishing and you're

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.749 
that's it for varnishing and you're
probably<00:06:41.150> wondering<00:06:41.630> how<00:06:41.750> many<00:06:41.810> layers<00:06:42.759> your

00:06:43.749 --> 00:06:43.759 
probably wondering how many layers your

00:06:43.759 --> 00:06:45.520 
probably wondering how many layers your
painting<00:06:44.360> will<00:06:44.509> dictate<00:06:44.960> how<00:06:44.990> many<00:06:45.319> layers

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
painting will dictate how many layers

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.939 
painting will dictate how many layers
your<00:06:46.250> your<00:06:46.789> your<00:06:47.210> own<00:06:47.360> you<00:06:47.960> know<00:06:48.110> whatever<00:06:48.800> you
