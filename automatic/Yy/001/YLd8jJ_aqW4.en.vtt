apologies<00:00:34.200> if<00:00:34.260> the<00:00:34.559> camera<00:00:34.890> does<00:00:35.070> shake<00:00:35.280> a

00:00:35.299 --> 00:00:35.309 
apologies if the camera does shake a

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.850 
apologies if the camera does shake a
little<00:00:35.520> bit<00:00:36.020> so<00:00:37.020> this<00:00:37.170> is<00:00:37.260> actually<00:00:37.559> a<00:00:37.590> pretty

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
little bit so this is actually a pretty

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:47.569 
little bit so this is actually a pretty
big<00:00:37.950> device<00:00:38.340> so<00:00:38.640> let's<00:00:39.050> slide<00:00:40.050> it<00:00:40.079> on<00:00:40.350> out<00:00:46.579> see

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
big device so let's slide it on out see

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:54.080 
big device so let's slide it on out see
if<00:00:47.610> we<00:00:47.820> can<00:00:47.969> do<00:00:48.120> that<00:00:52.370> so<00:00:53.370> this<00:00:53.489> comes<00:00:53.789> in<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
if we can do that so this comes in a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.360 
if we can do that so this comes in a
cardboard<00:00:54.420> box<00:00:54.840> but<00:00:55.020> within<00:00:55.530> that<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:56.340> can

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
cardboard box but within that you can

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.150 
cardboard box but within that you can
see<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.730> get<00:00:56.940> much<00:00:57.239> nicer<00:00:57.690> box<00:00:57.930> with<00:00:58.859> some

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
see you get much nicer box with some

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.779 
see you get much nicer box with some
padding<00:00:59.579> on<00:00:59.670> the<00:00:59.789> sides<00:01:01.460> we'll<00:01:02.460> set<00:01:02.640> this

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
padding on the sides we'll set this

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.380 
padding on the sides we'll set this
aside<00:01:03.860> then<00:01:04.860> you've<00:01:04.979> got<00:01:05.129> some<00:01:05.430> wrap<00:01:06.060> around

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
aside then you've got some wrap around

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.280 
aside then you've got some wrap around
it<00:01:07.640> this<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.790> very<00:01:08.970> reminiscent<00:01:09.420> of<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> Apple

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
it this is very reminiscent of the Apple

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.859 
it this is very reminiscent of the Apple
MacBook<00:01:10.470> Pro<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.640> terms<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> design<00:01:12.450> and<00:01:12.479> also

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
MacBook Pro in terms of design and also

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.990 
MacBook Pro in terms of design and also
the<00:01:13.140> packaging<00:01:13.650> you<00:01:13.680> can<00:01:13.770> see<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.130> box<00:01:14.340> just

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
the packaging you can see the box just

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.700 
the packaging you can see the box just
right<00:01:15.180> here<00:01:15.509> so<00:01:15.900> we'll<00:01:16.740> slide<00:01:16.860> this<00:01:17.100> all<00:01:17.280> out

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
right here so we'll slide this all out

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.230 
right here so we'll slide this all out
now<00:01:19.710> we'll<00:01:19.860> cut<00:01:20.040> through<00:01:20.220> this<00:01:20.490> tape<00:01:21.030> right

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
now we'll cut through this tape right

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.240 
now we'll cut through this tape right
here<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:23.310> open<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.180> up<00:01:25.009> see<00:01:26.009> how<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> all

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
here and open this up see how it all

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.240 
here and open this up see how it all
slides<00:01:26.640> out<00:01:27.590> so<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.799> think<00:01:28.920> it's<00:01:29.130> actually

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
slides out so I think it's actually

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.080 
slides out so I think it's actually
meant<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.670> the<00:01:30.180> other<00:01:30.390> way<00:01:30.479> around<00:01:30.630> you<00:01:32.090> can

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
meant to be the other way around you can

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.569 
meant to be the other way around you can
see<00:01:33.210> the<00:01:33.240> envy<00:01:33.600> level<00:01:33.900> right<00:01:34.079> up<00:01:34.110> there<00:01:34.579> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
see the envy level right up there and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.370 
see the envy level right up there and
here<00:01:36.360> you<00:01:36.450> go<00:01:36.600> so<00:01:36.840> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.110> see<00:01:37.229> some

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
here you go so you can see some

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.410 
here you go so you can see some
instructions<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:38.220> how<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:38.970> set<00:01:39.210> up<00:01:39.240> the

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
instructions on how to set up the

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
charger where the charging port is at

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.940 
charger where the charging port is at
the<00:01:41.460> power<00:01:41.640> port<00:01:41.909> and<00:01:42.409> then<00:01:43.409> it<00:01:43.500> says<00:01:43.680> thank

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950

00:04:06.809 --> 00:04:06.819 
trackpad and for decent things with it

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.640 
trackpad and for decent things with it
it's<00:04:06.970> not<00:04:07.120> fantastic<00:04:07.510> trackpad<00:04:08.200> but<00:04:08.410> as<00:04:08.530> you

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
it's not fantastic trackpad but as you

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.129 
it's not fantastic trackpad but as you
can<00:04:08.769> see<00:04:08.920> right<00:04:09.040> here<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:09.459> a<00:04:09.519> glass<00:04:09.760> trackpad

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:10.139 
can see right here it's a glass trackpad

00:04:10.139 --> 00:04:13.440 
can see right here it's a glass trackpad
has<00:04:11.139> sort<00:04:11.410> of<00:04:11.500> a<00:04:11.680> rubberized<00:04:12.459> line<00:04:13.030> right<00:04:13.269> here

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450

to<00:04:13.630> separate<00:04:14.109> between<00:04:14.290> the<00:04:14.739> movement<00:04:15.250> and<00:04:15.670> the

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
to separate between the movement and the

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:18.710 
to separate between the movement and the
clicking<00:04:16.539> area<00:04:16.959> not<00:04:17.709> too<00:04:17.859> bad<00:04:18.070> to<00:04:18.220> be<00:04:18.250> honest

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:18.720
