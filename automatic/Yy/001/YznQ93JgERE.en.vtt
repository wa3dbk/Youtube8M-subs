00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
the demon hunter society so she decides

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.840 
the demon hunter society so she decides
to<00:02:01.479> use<00:02:01.569> Akito<00:02:02.350> as<00:02:02.500> sort<00:02:03.069> of<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.280> punching<00:02:03.819> bag

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:03.850 
to use Akito as sort of a punching bag

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.059 
to use Akito as sort of a punching bag

00:02:06.059 --> 00:02:06.069

very<00:02:09.009> much<00:02:09.250> now<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:09.759> thing<00:02:09.970> about<00:02:10.119> this<00:02:10.239> show

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:10.299 
very much now the thing about this show

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:11.850 
very much now the thing about this show
is<00:02:10.450> that<00:02:10.599> so<00:02:10.899> far<00:02:11.140> they<00:02:11.349> haven't<00:02:11.680> actually

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 
is that so far they haven't actually

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.220 
is that so far they haven't actually
gone<00:02:12.280> out<00:02:12.340> of<00:02:12.549> their<00:02:12.880> way<00:02:12.910> to<00:02:13.060> explain<00:02:13.840> much<00:02:14.019> of

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
gone out of their way to explain much of

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:16.080 
gone out of their way to explain much of
it<00:02:14.319> yet<00:02:14.530> we<00:02:14.950> know<00:02:15.069> there<00:02:15.250> are<00:02:15.280> demons<00:02:15.760> and<00:02:16.000> then

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090 
it yet we know there are demons and then

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:17.699 
it yet we know there are demons and then
there<00:02:16.269> are<00:02:16.420> hunters<00:02:16.810> who<00:02:17.110> hunt<00:02:17.380> them

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
there are hunters who hunt them

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.500 
there are hunters who hunt them
we<00:02:17.799> know<00:02:17.920> that<00:02:18.069> Akihito<00:02:18.640> claims<00:02:18.940> to<00:02:19.329> be<00:02:19.480> a

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
we know that Akihito claims to be a

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.110 
we know that Akihito claims to be a
half-demon<00:02:20.379> hence<00:02:20.769> his<00:02:20.950> immortality<00:02:21.700> but

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
half-demon hence his immortality but

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.210 
half-demon hence his immortality but
beyond<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.690> we<00:02:23.110> don't<00:02:23.500> have<00:02:23.709> much<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> an

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
beyond that we don't have much of an

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.369 
beyond that we don't have much of an
explanation<00:02:24.519> if<00:02:25.060> he<00:02:25.299> is<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.450> half-demon<00:02:26.019> and

00:02:26.369 --> 00:02:26.379 
explanation if he is a half-demon and

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:28.020 
explanation if he is a half-demon and
therefore<00:02:26.799> is<00:02:26.980> he<00:02:27.099> mortal<00:02:27.459> because<00:02:27.790> of<00:02:27.940> it

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.030 
therefore is he mortal because of it

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:30.360 
therefore is he mortal because of it
wouldn't<00:02:28.599> that<00:02:28.780> make<00:02:28.989> full<00:02:29.440> demons<00:02:29.890> also

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
wouldn't that make full demons also

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:32.910 
wouldn't that make full demons also
immortal<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:31.000> if<00:02:31.090> so<00:02:31.329> shouldn't<00:02:32.290> a<00:02:32.470> demon

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
immortal and if so shouldn't a demon

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:34.949 
immortal and if so shouldn't a demon
hunter<00:02:33.129> be<00:02:33.940> able<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:34.329> kill<00:02:34.569> him

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
hunter be able to kill him

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.569 
hunter be able to kill him
I<00:02:34.989> suppose<00:02:35.709> the<00:02:35.890> current<00:02:36.040> reason<00:02:36.430> to<00:02:36.489> keep

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:36.579 
I suppose the current reason to keep

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:38.250 
I suppose the current reason to keep
watching<00:02:36.940> the<00:02:37.060> show<00:02:37.269> is<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.720> find<00:02:37.989> out<00:02:38.109> more

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
watching the show is to find out more

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.099 
watching the show is to find out more
about<00:02:38.319> Mirai<00:02:38.980> and<00:02:39.220> why<00:02:39.430> she<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.359> shunned<00:02:40.780> from

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:41.109 
about Mirai and why she is shunned from

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.110 
about Mirai and why she is shunned from
demon<00:02:41.500> hunters<00:02:41.769> society<00:02:42.370> because<00:02:42.880> you<00:02:43.000> know

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:43.120 
demon hunters society because you know

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.330 
demon hunters society because you know
that<00:02:43.299> seems<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.780> be<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.930> rather<00:02:44.139> large<00:02:44.680> focal

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
that seems to be a rather large focal

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.610 
that seems to be a rather large focal
point<00:02:45.639> of<00:02:45.850> course<00:02:46.329> if<00:02:46.450> that's<00:02:46.569> all<00:02:47.019> the<00:02:47.410> show

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
point of course if that's all the show

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.710 
point of course if that's all the show
is<00:02:47.799> about<00:02:47.950> than<00:02:48.310> I<00:02:48.400> would<00:02:48.609> expect<00:02:48.639> it<00:02:49.299> to<00:02:49.329> crash

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720 
is about than I would expect it to crash

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.360 
is about than I would expect it to crash
and<00:02:49.959> burn<00:02:49.989> because<00:02:50.349> that<00:02:50.650> doesn't<00:02:50.829> seem<00:02:51.130> to

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
and burn because that doesn't seem to

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.300 
and burn because that doesn't seem to
have<00:02:51.549> really<00:02:51.940> enough<00:02:52.329> substance<00:02:52.630> to<00:02:52.959> it<00:02:53.200> to<00:02:53.410> be

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
have really enough substance to it to be

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.800 
have really enough substance to it to be
worth<00:02:54.670> an<00:02:54.880> entire<00:02:55.150> show

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:55.810 
worth an entire show

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:57.780 
worth an entire show
but<00:02:56.109> knowing<00:02:56.380> kyoto<00:02:56.709> any<00:02:56.889> as<00:02:57.099> I<00:02:57.250> do<00:02:57.310> I<00:02:57.459> actually

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:57.790 
but knowing kyoto any as I do I actually

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:59.580 
but knowing kyoto any as I do I actually
highly<00:02:58.329> expect<00:02:58.720> the<00:02:58.840> large<00:02:59.049> chunk<00:02:59.380> of<00:02:59.470> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
highly expect the large chunk of the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.379 
highly expect the large chunk of the
show<00:02:59.799> to<00:03:00.130> be<00:03:00.280> about<00:03:00.489> the<00:03:00.639> relationship

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:01.389 
show to be about the relationship

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:03.449 
show to be about the relationship
between<00:03:01.420> Mirai<00:03:02.139> and<00:03:02.319> Akihito<00:03:02.739> whether<00:03:03.250> that

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:03.459 
between Mirai and Akihito whether that

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:05.539 
between Mirai and Akihito whether that
relationship<00:03:04.000> ends<00:03:04.239> up<00:03:04.329> being<00:03:04.480> romantic<00:03:05.019> or

00:03:05.539 --> 00:03:05.549 
relationship ends up being romantic or

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:08.460 
relationship ends up being romantic or
not<00:03:06.549> and<00:03:06.910> that'll<00:03:07.510> be<00:03:07.630> most<00:03:07.930> likely<00:03:08.139> the

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
not and that'll be most likely the

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.050 
not and that'll be most likely the
reason<00:03:08.590> why<00:03:08.859> I<00:03:08.889> keep<00:03:09.190> watching<00:03:09.370> aside<00:03:09.819> from

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
reason why I keep watching aside from

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.780 
reason why I keep watching aside from
you<00:03:10.450> know<00:03:10.480> the<00:03:10.780> gorgeous<00:03:11.410> animation<00:03:12.190> but<00:03:12.669> what

you know the gorgeous animation but what

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:14.849 
you know the gorgeous animation but what
I<00:03:12.819> want<00:03:13.060> to<00:03:13.150> see<00:03:13.359> though<00:03:13.569> is<00:03:13.780> more<00:03:14.319> development

I want to see though is more development

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:16.229 
I want to see though is more development
as<00:03:14.950> we<00:03:15.099> know<00:03:15.220> very<00:03:15.489> little<00:03:15.669> about<00:03:16.120> the
