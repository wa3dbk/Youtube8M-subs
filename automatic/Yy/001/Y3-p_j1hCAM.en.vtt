00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.809
 hi girls today i want to show you in 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.310
 this video as I edit in some 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:20.580
 so my low cost balm for 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:24.050
 enrich it so make it a little bit more 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.050
 more powerful in quotes 

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:28.680
 and it is exactly this balm that 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.510
 I will change it is a very step 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.610
 found in virtually all 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.600
 supermarkets and that of the splendor the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.579
 coco is really very little 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:42.239
 because I usually speak it between the 80 and 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.579
 90 cents per 300 ml is not 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.489
 in short, completely eco bio is not 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:51.600
 just exactly a natural product 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:54.780
 one hundred percent though with the change 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.859
 let's say I'm going to do as you will see later 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.629
 in the tutorial it is very simple 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.300
 let's say a good solution because 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.210
 however hair ministers 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:10.770
 it leaves them really bright shining 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:13.290
 I really like it so much 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.960
 obviously lovino to a shampoo of which 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:18.510
 I'll talk to you later if you want one 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.550
 shampoo of the real so I try to 

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:23.640
 in short, save in the bubble bath 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:25.800
 making me the house and if you want it in fact 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.350
 see that video click above 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.510
 you will go directly to the page of 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:35.040
 video so you can maybe do it too 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:36.630
 you and the balsam in short, in the sense 

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:39.870
 I always take this I find myself 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.070
 very well and then I make the change between 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:46.290
 quotes every time I have to 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.170
 wash my hair that man then one 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:52.770
 good solution to not spend much e 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.930
 however to resume a little haven 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.650
 to be able to have also 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.800
 a good product is made hair there 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.900
 I say they are really easy to comb 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.950
 then this product however you find it 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:09.450
 in virtually all supermarkets 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:14.880
 still not heard very well 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:17.010
 also from many forum sites in general 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.200
 so I still use it for a long time 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.200
 time since I started 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.440
 add other products to others 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.440
 ingredients you find in your home 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:30.600
 I find myself even better then you 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:33.540
 I leave the tutorial I hope you like it there 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:38.220
 useful and so I give you an appointment at 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:43.290
 next video there is a good kiss 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:53.910
 let's start by putting two tablespoons of 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:56.459
 balm in a small bowl 1 and 2 more 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:59.940
 or less long hair maybe if there 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:04.830
 you have courts you can use one ground 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:07.799
 in short to halve the doses here after 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:15.890
 that we are going to add a teaspoon 

00:03:07.799 --> 00:03:15.890
 of honey calmly 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:25.080
 here it is, you see a teaspoon of honey 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:34.690
 and do not go out even a little bit 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.750
 remove a little bit from the spoon e 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:39.959
 finally I add a florin of oil of 

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:39.959
 coconut 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.459
 if, like in winter, coconut oil is 

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:48.700
 solid if you don't want to stay there anyway 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.290
 dissolve a bit in a double boiler you can 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.170
 use sweet almond oil 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:57.280
 or jojoba oil which is good for you 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:59.610
 anyway this is fine when I do it 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.810
 I go to the shower and keep it there beside me 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:04.390
 simply when I gave myself hair 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.550
 I keep it next to me and with the moment of 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:10.230
 put the balm on my myth hair 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:16.019
 for 2 3 minutes this and then sack like 

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:16.019
 I normally take a kiss
