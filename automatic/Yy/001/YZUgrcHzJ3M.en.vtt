00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 the episode the diary in which 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:05.400
 tell the adventures of the parents of 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.440
 arnold and why they had to go back 

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.540
 a san lorenzo was just a prequel to 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.940
 a movie that would end the 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.920
 series to the story and what happened to this 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.809
 movie there was a great conflict between 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.550
 craig barlett and the nickelodeon channel 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.890
 nobody is sure what the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.350
 causes of that conflict but I have a 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.510
 theory however before explaining the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.730
 I want to mention a couple of things you know 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.650
 that the first gun movie the 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 the war of tomatoes the document and 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.390
 that was written thinking it as a 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.430
 movie for television while the 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.559
 movie that was never nicknamed in 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.570
 internet like the movie of the jungle is 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.879
 raised from the beginning as the only 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.649
 movie that would come out on the big screen 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.329
 however nickelodeon did not want 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 waste so good opportunity to 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.320
 make money with more movies so 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.820
 it occurred to them that it was the movie of 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.559
 War also tomatoes 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.300
 they premiere in cinema the first 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.670
 movie did not have a very good reception 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.739
 many cataloged it simply as 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:00.629
 an elongated chapter but that did not prevent 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.550
 than generate more than 15 million 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.890
 dollars worldwide for people 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.540
 mortals like you or like me 15 million 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:08.670
 of dollars is an extra amount 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.050
 but it is not for a movie nor 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 even for an animated film 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.480
 nickelodeon the movie of roberts 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:17.430
 are released in 98 genre 140 

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:20.850
 million dollars and the movie bob 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:22.650
 sponge the 2004 generated 140 points 2 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.590
 million dollars here begins my 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.450
 theory or that I did not even want that the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.280
 I hate I did not have money to make the 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.260
 jungle movie premieres in the 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.850
 cinema so they decided that that 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:33.690
 second movie will debut in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.910
 TV 

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.610
 however craig barletta will have done 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.710
 a quilombo after the drastic decision or 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.810
 they had already told him that the end 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.550
 yesterday would not show up at the cinema and 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.130
 sure he along with the producers will 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:49.229
 they worked particularly hard in this 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.090
 second movie for this reason 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.009
 Credit complaints began with the channel 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.450
 and that's why this second movie 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:56.450
 it was even made for television 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.119
 although there is no finished script or the 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.860
 less is not on the internet what there is 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.470
 is the key argument and events of the 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.240
 plot the entire class that was now 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.979
 in the fifth year they won a trip san 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
 lorenzo can be the prize of a 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.430
 trial contest in which weapons 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.010
 He emerged victorious, it has not been said 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:17.440
 HernÃ¡n participated knowing that said good 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.730
 that said trip was the prize and 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.590
 it served as motivation to win 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.630
 remember that this movie happens 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:24.760
 afterwards from the newspaper so 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.500
 arnold knew that if there was a place in the 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.120
 that his parents should be that place 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.620
 it was san lorenzo there 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.450
 arnold would meet the people of 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.980
 green eyes who have a gem 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.050
 sacred called heart that a 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.060
 mercenary nicknamed the shadow wants 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.800
 steal some important things that you 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.230
 they would develop throughout the movie 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.000
 they are first you would say the last name of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.620
 arnold at the beginning of the movie he 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.840
 I was going to receive a package with their names 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.640
 complete seconds writings for the 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.620
 romantic fans there would be a scene of are 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.360
 not and jargon like in the movie in the 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.760
 war of tomatoes only now ar 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:55.330
 would not be from the third initiative to 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.489
 final 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.989
 Armand had to choose between going home 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:01.299
 or stay with their parents in San Lorenzo 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.730
 and apparently not even escric barlett 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:04.650
 he is sure that decision 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.090
 do every time they ask what was going 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.830
 to go through a tree the change of 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.330
 answers or maybe the varies the 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:11.099
 answer to keep the doubt 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.830
 because he hopes that some 

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.390
 day the movie is unfolding it 's sad 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:17.459
 that this story has had an end 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.379
 so unfinished and open to his position 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.540
 of the viewer but it's not so bad 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:23.760
 there are many people who like 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.500
 unfinished endings in a story only 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:28.700
 look at the large number of fans 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.700
 of neon genesis evangelion
