00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:33.190 
milliamp hour battery overall you know I

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.640 
milliamp hour battery overall you know I
flew<00:00:33.489> this<00:00:33.700> I<00:00:33.880> tested<00:00:34.300> it<00:00:34.420> I<00:00:34.630> I<00:00:35.230> just<00:00:35.320> wasn't

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:35.650 
flew this I tested it I I just wasn't

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.290 
flew this I tested it I I just wasn't
that<00:00:35.800> impressed<00:00:36.160> with<00:00:36.310> it<00:00:36.460> the<00:00:36.579> main<00:00:36.760> problem

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:37.300 
that impressed with it the main problem

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.170 
that impressed with it the main problem
I<00:00:37.390> found<00:00:37.600> found<00:00:38.380> two<00:00:38.620> main<00:00:38.770> problems<00:00:39.180> the

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:40.180 
I found found two main problems the

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.150 
I found found two main problems the
first<00:00:40.390> is<00:00:40.570> there's<00:00:40.750> no<00:00:40.870> gyro<00:00:41.290> that's<00:00:41.829> kind<00:00:42.070> of

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:42.160 
first is there's no gyro that's kind of

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.380 
first is there's no gyro that's kind of
a<00:00:42.250> must<00:00:42.489> these<00:00:42.700> days<00:00:43.739> there's<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:45.180> really<00:00:46.180> small

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
a must these days there's a really small

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:48.570 
a must these days there's a really small
battery<00:00:46.840> too<00:00:47.050> and<00:00:47.380> that<00:00:47.560> might<00:00:47.740> have<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.310> do<00:00:48.430> it

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:48.580 
battery too and that might have to do it

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.520 
battery too and that might have to do it
because<00:00:49.390> it's<00:00:49.720> a<00:00:49.840> really<00:00:50.260> lightweight

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:50.530 
because it's a really lightweight

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:52.140 
because it's a really lightweight
helicopter<00:00:51.190> but<00:00:51.340> it<00:00:51.430> was<00:00:51.520> a<00:00:51.550> hundred<00:00:51.880> million

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:52.150 
helicopter but it was a hundred million

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.870 
helicopter but it was a hundred million
power<00:00:52.390> battery<00:00:52.450> I<00:00:52.900> think<00:00:53.560> that's<00:00:53.710> just<00:00:53.880> that's

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:54.880 
power battery I think that's just that's

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.060 
power battery I think that's just that's
the<00:00:55.030> two<00:00:55.210> downsides<00:00:55.750> so<00:00:56.020> with<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:56.830> small

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:57.070 
the two downsides so with the small

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.010 
the two downsides so with the small
battery<00:00:57.400> I<00:00:57.670> was<00:00:58.210> only<00:00:58.330> able<00:00:58.450> to<00:00:58.570> get<00:00:58.690> this<00:00:58.870> to

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
battery I was only able to get this to

00:00:59.020 --> 00:00:59.970 
battery I was only able to get this to
stay<00:00:59.200> in<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> air<00:00:59.470> for<00:00:59.500> about<00:00:59.740> a<00:00:59.770> minute

00:00:59.970 --> 00:00:59.980 
stay in the air for about a minute

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.810 
stay in the air for about a minute
thirty<00:01:00.340> seconds<00:01:01.170> without<00:01:02.170> the<00:01:02.410> gyro<00:01:02.830> I<00:01:03.100> wasn't

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
thirty seconds without the gyro I wasn't

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.050 
thirty seconds without the gyro I wasn't
really<00:01:03.940> able<00:01:04.089> to<00:01:04.299> fly<00:01:04.509> it<00:01:04.570> very<00:01:04.809> well<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:06.610> you

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:07.060 
really able to fly it very well the you

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.090 
really able to fly it very well the you
know<00:01:07.150> without<00:01:07.360> a<00:01:07.420> gyro<00:01:07.869> to<00:01:08.110> keep<00:01:08.740> the<00:01:08.890> tail

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
know without a gyro to keep the tail

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.100 
know without a gyro to keep the tail
stable<00:01:09.520> as<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:10.299> accelerate<00:01:10.570> you<00:01:10.930> know<00:01:11.020> it

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:11.110 
stable as you accelerate you know it

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.499 
stable as you accelerate you know it
might<00:01:11.259> spin<00:01:11.799> this<00:01:11.979> way<00:01:12.220> and<00:01:12.670> as<00:01:12.790> you<00:01:12.820> would

00:01:13.499 --> 00:01:13.509 
might spin this way and as you would

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:15.539 
might spin this way and as you would
slow<00:01:13.780> down<00:01:13.810> it<00:01:14.200> would<00:01:14.320> start<00:01:15.040> spinning<00:01:15.280> in

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
slow down it would start spinning in

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.670 
slow down it would start spinning in
circles<00:01:15.759> you<00:01:16.180> can<00:01:16.689> pretty<00:01:16.990> much<00:01:17.079> go<00:01:17.350> straight

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:17.680 
circles you can pretty much go straight

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.289 
circles you can pretty much go straight
up<00:01:17.829> and<00:01:18.040> down<00:01:18.299> but<00:01:19.299> it<00:01:20.850> wasn't<00:01:21.850> that<00:01:21.939> fun<00:01:22.179> to

00:01:22.289 --> 00:01:22.299 
up and down but it wasn't that fun to

00:01:22.299 --> 00:01:25.770 
up and down but it wasn't that fun to
fly<00:01:22.509> you<00:01:23.049> know<00:01:23.170> I<00:01:23.200> I<00:01:23.590> think<00:01:24.100> the<00:01:24.549> the<00:01:24.969> pros<00:01:25.450> are

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
fly you know I I think the the pros are

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.789 
fly you know I I think the the pros are
the<00:01:25.840> good<00:01:25.990> thing<00:01:26.170> about<00:01:26.200> this<00:01:26.499> helicopter

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
the good thing about this helicopter

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.469 
the good thing about this helicopter
would<00:01:27.069> be<00:01:27.130> the<00:01:27.310> price<00:01:27.579> you<00:01:28.030> know<00:01:28.060> it's<00:01:28.240> really

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 
would be the price you know it's really

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:31.559 
would be the price you know it's really
an<00:01:28.600> expensive<00:01:28.929> helicopter<00:01:29.939> and<00:01:30.939> it's<00:01:31.299> pretty

00:01:31.559 --> 00:01:31.569 
an expensive helicopter and it's pretty

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:33.330 
an expensive helicopter and it's pretty
tough<00:01:31.749> you<00:01:32.109> know<00:01:32.200> I<00:01:32.259> I<00:01:32.590> was<00:01:32.889> I<00:01:33.069> was<00:01:33.310> pretty

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
tough you know I I was I was pretty

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.539 
tough you know I I was I was pretty
impressed<00:01:33.819> with<00:01:33.999> these<00:01:34.840> plastic<00:01:35.829> the<00:01:36.130> plastic

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:36.549 
impressed with these plastic the plastic

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:38.550 
impressed with these plastic the plastic
body<00:01:36.729> here<00:01:37.060> it's<00:01:37.240> a<00:01:37.299> good<00:01:37.479> plastic<00:01:37.749> it's

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
body here it's a good plastic it's

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:39.719 
body here it's a good plastic it's
really<00:01:38.740> strong

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
really strong

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:41.940 
really strong
it's<00:01:40.210> thick<00:01:40.420> enough<00:01:40.659> that<00:01:40.899> it<00:01:41.350> can<00:01:41.799> handle

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
it's thick enough that it can handle

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.520 
it's thick enough that it can handle
some<00:01:42.369> pretty<00:01:42.549> tough<00:01:42.789> landings<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:44.020> quick

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
some pretty tough landings a quick

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.459 
some pretty tough landings a quick
review<00:01:44.799> what<00:01:44.979> you<00:01:45.100> get<00:01:45.310> you<00:01:45.490> get<00:01:45.670> the<00:01:46.469> the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
review what you get you get the the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:49.980 
review what you get you get the the
controller<00:01:47.950> controllers<00:01:48.880> infrared<00:01:49.329> you<00:01:49.869> do

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:49.990 
controller controllers infrared you do

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:52.739 
controller controllers infrared you do
have<00:01:50.170> three<00:01:50.499> modes<00:01:50.709> you<00:01:51.159> know<00:01:51.249> a<00:01:51.280> B<00:01:51.549> and<00:01:51.700> C<00:01:51.880> so

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
have three modes you know a B and C so

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:55.020 
have three modes you know a B and C so
in<00:01:52.810> theory<00:01:53.049> you<00:01:53.170> could<00:01:53.439> have<00:01:53.590> three<00:01:54.039> identical

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
in theory you could have three identical

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.789 
in theory you could have three identical
helicopters<00:01:55.569> all<00:01:55.899> with<00:01:56.409> different

00:01:56.789 --> 00:01:56.799 
helicopters all with different

00:01:56.799 --> 00:01:59.370 
helicopters all with different
controllers<00:01:57.429> in<00:01:57.549> the<00:01:57.579> same<00:01:57.850> room<00:01:58.229> it's<00:01:59.229> got<00:01:59.319> a

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
controllers in the same room it's got a

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.129 
controllers in the same room it's got a
charge<00:01:59.679> indicator<00:02:00.159> light<00:02:00.479> right<00:02:01.479> here<00:02:01.509> that's

00:02:02.129 --> 00:02:02.139 
charge indicator light right here that's

00:02:02.139 --> 00:02:04.319 
charge indicator light right here that's
actually<00:02:02.350> the<00:02:02.649> power<00:02:02.859> on<00:02:03.069> light<00:02:03.279> to<00:02:04.060> charge

00:02:04.319 --> 00:02:04.329 
actually the power on light to charge

00:02:04.329 --> 00:02:06.269 
actually the power on light to charge
this<00:02:04.539> you've<00:02:04.899> got<00:02:05.109> a<00:02:05.139> charge<00:02:05.529> cable<00:02:05.829> that

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
this you've got a charge cable that

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:09.210 
this you've got a charge cable that
comes<00:02:06.490> out<00:02:06.700> right<00:02:06.999> here<00:02:07.619> with<00:02:08.619> the<00:02:08.709> helicopter

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.430 

without<00:03:18.300> the<00:03:18.420> gyro<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:18.900> thing's<00:03:19.110> not<00:03:19.230> very

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
without the gyro this thing's not very

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.410 
without the gyro this thing's not very
stable<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.860> I'm<00:03:19.920> just<00:03:20.040> going<00:03:20.190> to<00:03:20.220> try<00:03:20.370> to<00:03:20.420> get

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:21.420 
stable so I'm just going to try to get

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.010 
stable so I'm just going to try to get
as<00:03:21.510> close<00:03:21.569> as<00:03:21.780> I<00:03:21.989> can<00:03:22.050> to<00:03:22.230> stay<00:03:22.530> kind<00:03:23.310> of<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.760> the

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:24.020 
as close as I can to stay kind of in the

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:49.480 
as close as I can to stay kind of in the
field

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:49.490 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:51.970 

if<00:03:50.030> you<00:03:50.210> get<00:03:50.570> better<00:03:50.840> at<00:03:51.050> these<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.560> can<00:03:51.740> kind

if you get better at these you can kind

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.260 
if you get better at these you can kind
of<00:03:52.040> control<00:03:52.220> them<00:03:52.550> but<00:03:52.700> without<00:03:52.820> the<00:03:53.090> driver
