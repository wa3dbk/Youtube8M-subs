defenses<00:00:41.010> phenomenal<00:00:41.579> he's<00:00:41.760> so<00:00:42.059> young

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
defenses phenomenal he's so young

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.000 
defenses phenomenal he's so young
there's<00:00:42.629> so<00:00:42.840> much<00:00:42.989> untapped<00:00:43.350> potential<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:43.950> I

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
there's so much untapped potential and I

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.830 
there's so much untapped potential and I
know<00:00:44.070> LeBrons<00:00:44.579> in<00:00:44.820> his<00:00:44.940> prime<00:00:45.239> he's<00:00:45.450> pushing

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
know LeBrons in his prime he's pushing

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020 
know LeBrons in his prime he's pushing
30<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.440> you<00:00:46.920> want<00:00:47.190> to<00:00:47.280> put<00:00:47.430> help<00:00:47.640> around<00:00:47.910> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
30 and you want to put help around and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.000 
30 and you want to put help around and
its<00:00:48.149> experience<00:00:48.750> but<00:00:48.989> Kevin<00:00:49.530> Love<00:00:49.680> hasn't

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
its experience but Kevin Love hasn't

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220 
its experience but Kevin Love hasn't
made<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.129> playoffs<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.760> I<00:00:51.360> think<00:00:51.930> that

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
made the playoffs and I think that

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.680 
made the playoffs and I think that
defense<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:53.070> always<00:00:53.789> more<00:00:54.000> valuable<00:00:54.420> than

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
defense is always more valuable than

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.029 
defense is always more valuable than
anything<00:00:54.930> get<00:00:55.199> on<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.379> offensive<00:00:55.649> end<00:00:55.829> and

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
anything get on the offensive end and

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.040 
anything get on the offensive end and
LeBron<00:00:56.820> will<00:00:57.030> teach<00:00:57.300> Wiggins<00:00:57.719> how<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> a

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
LeBron will teach Wiggins how to be a

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.010 
LeBron will teach Wiggins how to be a
phenomenal<00:00:58.260> player<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.190> I<00:00:59.219> just<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.899> this

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
phenomenal player and I just have this

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.660 
phenomenal player and I just have this
weird<00:01:01.289> hunch<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> the<00:01:01.920> Cavs<00:01:02.160> are<00:01:02.309> making<00:01:02.579> a

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
weird hunch that the Cavs are making a

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.579 
weird hunch that the Cavs are making a
big<00:01:02.940> mistake<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.600> they<00:01:03.750> trade<00:01:04.019> away<00:01:04.140> Wiggins

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
big mistake if they trade away Wiggins

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.300 
big mistake if they trade away Wiggins
which<00:01:04.710> it<00:01:04.860> seems<00:01:05.159> like<00:01:05.369> it's<00:01:05.580> going<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:05.760> be<00:01:05.990> not

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
which it seems like it's going to be not

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.350 
which it seems like it's going to be not
not<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.610> but<00:01:08.880> when<00:01:08.939> and<00:01:09.500> I<00:01:10.850> don't<00:01:11.850> know<00:01:12.150> but<00:01:12.330> I

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
not if but when and I don't know but I

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.580 
not if but when and I don't know but I
just<00:01:12.420> have<00:01:12.720> this<00:01:12.840> weird<00:01:13.049> hunch<00:01:13.290> you<00:01:13.409> know<00:01:13.500> when

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
just have this weird hunch you know when

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.109 
just have this weird hunch you know when
you<00:01:13.680> have<00:01:13.830> that<00:01:13.950> hunch<00:01:14.280> that<00:01:14.400> this<00:01:14.760> is<00:01:14.970> just

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
you have that hunch that this is just

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.609 
you have that hunch that this is just
something<00:01:15.570> doesn't<00:01:15.990> seem<00:01:16.140> right<00:01:16.200> about<00:01:16.380> this

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
something doesn't seem right about this

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.499 
something doesn't seem right about this
I<00:01:16.920> think<00:01:17.400> Wiggins<00:01:17.700> both<00:01:17.850> from<00:01:17.970> the<00:01:18.030> defensive

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
I think Wiggins both from the defensive

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:19.940 
I think Wiggins both from the defensive
side<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:18.930> he<00:01:18.990> can<00:01:19.140> learn<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.530> LeBron

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
side and what he can learn from LeBron

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.950 
side and what he can learn from LeBron
and<00:01:20.159> his<00:01:20.280> youth<00:01:20.580> he<00:01:20.820> could<00:01:21.330> pick<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.570> up<00:01:21.720> very

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
and his youth he could pick it up very

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.390 
and his youth he could pick it up very
quickly<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> I<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.799> I<00:01:22.920> wouldn't<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.280> this

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
quickly and I just I wouldn't do this

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.820 
quickly and I just I wouldn't do this
trade<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:24.110> would<00:01:25.110> make<00:01:25.259> this<00:01:25.380> trade<00:01:25.619> in<00:01:25.710> two

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830 
trade I would make this trade in two

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.649 
trade I would make this trade in two
seconds<00:01:26.280> know<00:01:26.369> anything<00:01:26.729> about<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.000> yeah<00:01:27.600> you
