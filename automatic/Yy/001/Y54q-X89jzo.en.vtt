00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
it with a single volume so the victor I

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.310 
it with a single volume so the victor I
decided<00:03:04.880> to<00:03:05.060> put<00:03:05.270> two<00:03:05.420> volumes<00:03:05.810> on<00:03:05.990> it<00:03:06.110> so

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:06.320 
decided to put two volumes on it so

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.420 
decided to put two volumes on it so
it'll<00:03:07.040> do<00:03:07.340> that<00:03:07.610> and<00:03:07.880> tone<00:03:08.750> young<00:03:09.620> anyone<00:03:10.130> so

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:10.430 
it'll do that and tone young anyone so

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.920 
it'll do that and tone young anyone so
so<00:03:11.030> that<00:03:11.180> we're<00:03:11.330> fine<00:03:12.490> but<00:03:13.490> both<00:03:13.910> guitars<00:03:14.120> use

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
so that we're fine but both guitars use

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:16.900 
so that we're fine but both guitars use
the<00:03:15.200> straight<00:03:15.560> string<00:03:16.040> pull<00:03:16.340> headstock

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
the straight string pull headstock

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.530 
the straight string pull headstock
because<00:03:17.390> I<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:19.400> idea<00:03:19.730> obviously<00:03:19.850> is<00:03:20.240> to<00:03:20.390> get

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
because I the idea obviously is to get

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.050 
because I the idea obviously is to get
no<00:03:20.720> kinks<00:03:21.200> and<00:03:21.320> no<00:03:21.500> holdups<00:03:22.010> anywhere<00:03:22.520> on<00:03:22.700> the

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
no kinks and no holdups anywhere on the

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.740 
no kinks and no holdups anywhere on the
guitar<00:03:23.390> I<00:03:24.260> feel<00:03:25.250> that<00:03:25.280> you<00:03:25.700> know<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:26.450> strings

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
guitar I feel that you know the strings

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:28.030 
guitar I feel that you know the strings
in<00:03:26.930> a<00:03:27.020> straight<00:03:27.320> line<00:03:27.350> they're<00:03:27.830> going<00:03:27.950> to

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:28.040 
in a straight line they're going to

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.240 
in a straight line they're going to
perform<00:03:28.340> better<00:03:28.750> and<00:03:29.750> also<00:03:30.020> the<00:03:30.830> wraparound

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
perform better and also the wraparound

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.830 
perform better and also the wraparound
bridge<00:03:32.060> was<00:03:32.360> at<00:03:32.570> own<00:03:32.870> pros<00:03:33.140> apt<00:03:33.770> to<00:03:34.690> which<00:03:35.690> is<00:03:35.810> a

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
bridge was at own pros apt to which is a

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.950 
bridge was at own pros apt to which is a
great<00:03:36.140> bridge<00:03:36.440> fully<00:03:36.770> in<00:03:36.950> turn<00:03:37.100> a<00:03:37.190> table<00:03:37.960> again

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:38.960 
great bridge fully in turn a table again

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.470 
great bridge fully in turn a table again
i<00:03:39.170> grew<00:03:39.530> up<00:03:39.560> we<00:03:39.800> get<00:03:39.950> ours<00:03:40.160> with<00:03:40.460> had<00:03:40.670> no<00:03:41.180> bridge

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:41.480 
i grew up we get ours with had no bridge

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.480 
i grew up we get ours with had no bridge
just<00:03:41.810> the<00:03:41.930> wraparound<00:03:42.260> tail<00:03:42.800> peas<00:03:43.040> on<00:03:43.220> it<00:03:43.250> and

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
just the wraparound tail peas on it and

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.200 
just the wraparound tail peas on it and
and<00:03:44.390> sustain<00:03:45.200> wise<00:03:45.470> I<00:03:45.860> don't<00:03:46.370> think<00:03:46.520> you<00:03:47.090> can

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
and sustain wise I don't think you can

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:50.710 
and sustain wise I don't think you can
actually<00:03:47.420> beat<00:03:47.810> that<00:03:48.080> well<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:50.180> less<00:03:50.360> points

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
actually beat that well the less points

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.960 
actually beat that well the less points
the<00:03:50.960> string<00:03:51.260> touches<00:03:51.710> the<00:03:52.340> better<00:03:52.580> is<00:03:52.760> going

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
the string touches the better is going

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.690 
the string touches the better is going
to<00:03:53.060> sustain<00:03:53.360> so<00:03:54.010> there<00:03:55.010> is<00:03:55.100> really<00:03:55.130> kind<00:03:55.640> of

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
to sustain so there is really kind of

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.310 
to sustain so there is really kind of
you<00:03:55.760> know<00:03:55.850> it<00:03:56.030> was<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.150> no-brainer<00:03:56.330> for<00:03:56.750> that<00:03:57.020> so

00:03:57.310 --> 00:03:57.320 
you know it was a no-brainer for that so
