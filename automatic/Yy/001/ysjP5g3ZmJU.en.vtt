00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Today we have a very nice Peter 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:05.150
 had shilling in Berlin 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:09.929
 I'm saying about myself I am always 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.519
 wild rebellious and free and shall i 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.889
 I also showed the shooting 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.020
 that the motive is for you to be yourself 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.180
 can build a great ball and that 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.619
 completely meatless since the beginning 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.600
 In my time I'm no meat 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.949
 So I can not do anything negative 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.660
 report about it 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:29.429
 I get up in the morning on crutches a few 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:32.099
 Nuts purely leave that to about 70 grams 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.660
 There are 70 grams of carbohydrates to the roof 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.200
 then normal court on 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.059
 Carbs are just as easy as me 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.210
 which i longer of and also for protein 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.610
 you do not need meat, I take care of myself 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.969
 hemp seed and from a lentil dish 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.320
 or soya everybody always had to say there 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:51.270
 this stick on it and the rest 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.710
 is what he is utter rubbish 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.420
 a bit of detail nutrient 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.039
 unterversorgt actually finished that yes 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.180
 so that you leave the meat plant 

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.859
 should and all that you as 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.120
 She is an internal with 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.890
 free up it was there should insert the 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.239
 all vitamins all the nutrients 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.619
 the body needs a piece of meat 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.619
 Maybe it's water 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.540
 and then continue to crop 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.409
 maybe a lot of fabric no idea 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.520
 you can not eat dough too 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.619
 here is an emotional for me 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.650
 intelligent beings like you and me 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.820
 have even a heart all feelings only 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.240
 that I have no voice and say 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.759
 can 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.479
 halo is not me the most 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.049
 People do not really know 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.210
 take 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.560
 Here's a meaty boredom 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.400
 because she can do that with others 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.799
 deal 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.180
 we are all industrialized we have 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.100
 just not the same girl together 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.750
 no idea how are here felt 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.030
 or live or whatever 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.030
 the sad thing is actually what 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.369
 then we will 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.990
 Salami pizza make the salami and eat 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.110
 for us the salami eats on a salami 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:51.790
 If we have an emotional bond again 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.590
 would build up with animals 

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:56.729
 I think yours is much less 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.729
 people will eat meat 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:04.860
 I am hans-peter and eat meat 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.860
 without with
