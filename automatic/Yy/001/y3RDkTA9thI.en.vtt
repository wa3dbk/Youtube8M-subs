etc so it's it's had a big impact on

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:58.550 
etc so it's it's had a big impact on
children<00:03:57.299> and<00:03:57.449> obviously<00:03:57.930> that<00:03:58.019> means<00:03:58.169> that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
children and obviously that means that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.170 
children and obviously that means that
it<00:03:58.650> doesn't<00:03:58.949> just<00:03:59.009> apply<00:03:59.459> to<00:03:59.579> children<00:03:59.729> so

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
it doesn't just apply to children so

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.059 
it doesn't just apply to children so
it's<00:04:00.299> now<00:04:00.419> got<00:04:00.569> a<00:04:00.629> much<00:04:00.900> wider<00:04:01.229> remit<00:04:01.650> and

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:02.069 
it's now got a much wider remit and

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:04.729 
it's now got a much wider remit and
we're<00:04:02.609> working<00:04:02.790> with<00:04:03.150> higher<00:04:04.139> education

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:04.739 
we're working with higher education

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:06.710 
we're working with higher education
institutions<00:04:05.400> at<00:04:05.549> universities<00:04:06.150> business

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
institutions at universities business

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.689 
institutions at universities business
schools<00:04:06.989> conference<00:04:07.560> centres<00:04:07.949> and<00:04:08.189> indeed

schools conference centres and indeed
business<00:04:09.060> and<00:04:09.209> industry<00:04:09.919> so<00:04:10.919> let's<00:04:11.129> take<00:04:11.310> a

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
business and industry so let's take a

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.330 
business and industry so let's take a
look<00:04:11.579> at<00:04:11.780> current<00:04:12.780> health<00:04:13.229> trends<00:04:13.739> starts<00:04:14.189> off

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
look at current health trends starts off

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.949 
look at current health trends starts off
quite<00:04:14.639> pessimistic<00:04:14.849> I'm<00:04:15.329> afraid<00:04:15.629> but<00:04:15.719> we'll

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
quite pessimistic I'm afraid but we'll

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.899 
quite pessimistic I'm afraid but we'll
get<00:04:16.049> a<00:04:16.109> little<00:04:16.349> bit<00:04:16.469> more<00:04:16.590> optimistic<00:04:17.130> towards

00:04:17.899 --> 00:04:17.909 
get a little bit more optimistic towards

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:20.539 
get a little bit more optimistic towards
the<00:04:18.030> end<00:04:18.150> so<00:04:19.049> may<00:04:19.709> not<00:04:19.919> surprise<00:04:20.070> you<00:04:20.250> to<00:04:20.519> hear

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
the end so may not surprise you to hear

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.909 
the end so may not surprise you to hear
that<00:04:20.880> were<00:04:21.060> creative<00:04:21.570> stress<00:04:21.870> is<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.409> second

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
that were creative stress is the second

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.560 
that were creative stress is the second
biggest<00:04:23.070> occupational<00:04:24.000> health<00:04:24.120> problem<00:04:24.509> in

the country and it guesses us to the
first<00:04:28.610> back<00:04:29.610> pain<00:04:29.909> and<00:04:31.580> this<00:04:32.580> is<00:04:32.880> a<00:04:32.909> surprising

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
first back pain and this is a surprising

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:35.209 
first back pain and this is a surprising

have been diagnosed with depression so

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:38.690 
have been diagnosed with depression so
that's<00:04:37.680> not<00:04:37.889> just<00:04:38.159> ticking<00:04:38.460> a

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
that's not just ticking a

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.610 
that's not just ticking a
box<00:04:38.820> in<00:04:39.000> a<00:04:39.060> Daily<00:04:39.360> Mail<00:04:39.540> questionnaire<00:04:40.290> saying

box in a Daily Mail questionnaire saying

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.290 
box in a Daily Mail questionnaire saying
do<00:04:41.100> you<00:04:41.160> feel<00:04:41.340> a<00:04:41.370> bit<00:04:41.580> glum<00:04:41.820> on<00:04:42.090> the<00:04:42.180> Monday

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:42.300 
do you feel a bit glum on the Monday

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:44.450 
do you feel a bit glum on the Monday
morning<00:04:42.810> that's<00:04:43.350> going<00:04:43.680> to<00:04:43.800> your<00:04:43.920> doctor<00:04:44.280> and

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:44.460 
morning that's going to your doctor and

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:45.830 
morning that's going to your doctor and
being<00:04:44.730> diagnosed<00:04:44.940> with<00:04:45.360> clinical<00:04:45.570> depression

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
being diagnosed with clinical depression

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.590 
being diagnosed with clinical depression
so<00:04:46.440> a<00:04:46.620> really<00:04:47.400> quite<00:04:47.670> depressing<00:04:48.000> statistic

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:48.600 
so a really quite depressing statistic

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:51.890 
so a really quite depressing statistic
and<00:04:49.730> the<00:04:50.730> same<00:04:50.970> amount<00:04:51.150> of<00:04:51.420> people<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.810> this

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
and the same amount of people in this

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.620 
and the same amount of people in this
country<00:04:52.110> are<00:04:52.320> now<00:04:52.500> clinically<00:04:52.950> obese<00:04:53.070> and<00:04:53.640> a

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:54.630 
country are now clinically obese and a

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:56.300 
country are now clinically obese and a
lot<00:04:54.810> more<00:04:54.840> getting<00:04:55.410> on<00:04:55.530> their<00:04:55.710> way<00:04:55.920> to<00:04:55.980> being

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:56.310 
lot more getting on their way to being

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.860 
lot more getting on their way to being
that<00:04:56.520> way<00:04:56.670> I<00:04:56.700> think<00:04:56.850> 75<00:04:57.330> percent<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:57.810> the

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:57.870 
that way I think 75 percent of the

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.080 
that way I think 75 percent of the
country<00:04:58.020> are<00:04:58.230> classified<00:04:58.740> as<00:04:58.860> overweight<00:04:59.090> so

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:00.090 
country are classified as overweight so

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.370 
country are classified as overweight so
very<00:05:00.480> quite<00:05:01.320> literally<00:05:01.650> for<00:05:01.800> a<00:05:01.860> big<00:05:02.040> issue<00:05:02.250> and

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
very quite literally for a big issue and

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.350 
very quite literally for a big issue and
sick<00:05:04.380> leave<00:05:04.590> costs<00:05:05.220> our<00:05:05.340> economy<00:05:05.790> a<00:05:05.820> huge

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:06.360 
sick leave costs our economy a huge

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.830 
sick leave costs our economy a huge
amount<00:05:06.720> of<00:05:06.810> money<00:05:06.870> each<00:05:07.200> year<00:05:07.230> so<00:05:08.190> not<00:05:08.490> very

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
amount of money each year so not very

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.390 
amount of money each year so not very
rosy<00:05:09.840> picture<00:05:10.080> in<00:05:10.530> terms<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.890> the<00:05:11.010> nation's

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.400 
rosy picture in terms of the nation's

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.850 
rosy picture in terms of the nation's
health<00:05:11.670> as<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:11.850> whole<00:05:12.290> but<00:05:13.290> if<00:05:13.380> we<00:05:13.500> look<00:05:13.530> at

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
health as a whole but if we look at

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:15.800 
health as a whole but if we look at
those<00:05:14.070> health<00:05:14.460> trends<00:05:14.940> in<00:05:15.030> the<00:05:15.060> light<00:05:15.270> of<00:05:15.300> food

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:15.810 
those health trends in the light of food

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:18.110 
those health trends in the light of food
trends<00:05:16.470> it's<00:05:16.950> quite<00:05:17.340> interesting<00:05:17.670> to<00:05:17.940> see<00:05:18.090> the

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
trends it's quite interesting to see the

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.180 
trends it's quite interesting to see the
link<00:05:18.480> between<00:05:18.690> how<00:05:19.470> we're<00:05:19.710> choosing<00:05:19.920> to<00:05:20.160> eat

you<00:05:27.390> all<00:05:27.510> agree<00:05:27.630> that<00:05:27.780> we<00:05:28.020> tend<00:05:28.200> to<00:05:28.290> snack<00:05:28.680> more
