to well you can I am not allergic to
cats<00:03:27.390> at<00:03:27.720> all<00:03:27.930> anymore

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
cats at all anymore

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.199 
cats at all anymore
and<00:03:29.519> it<00:03:29.940> used<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.209> be<00:03:31.280> so<00:03:32.280> I'm<00:03:32.610> thinking<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
and it used to be so I'm thinking it

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.870 
and it used to be so I'm thinking it
might<00:03:33.360> because<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:34.019> vitamins<00:03:34.500> partly<00:03:35.280> and

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
might because of the vitamins partly and

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.360 
might because of the vitamins partly and
I<00:03:36.870> don't<00:03:36.930> think<00:03:37.200> it's<00:03:37.350> just<00:03:37.560> cause<00:03:37.829> to<00:03:38.040> change

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
I don't think it's just cause to change

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.190 
I don't think it's just cause to change
and<00:03:38.700> you<00:03:38.790> know<00:03:38.910> your<00:03:39.120> body<00:03:39.150> changes<00:03:39.900> I<00:03:40.019> think

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:40.200 
and you know your body changes I think

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:41.660 
and you know your body changes I think
it<00:03:40.290> has<00:03:40.410> to<00:03:40.440> do<00:03:40.739> I<00:03:40.769> never<00:03:41.070> took<00:03:41.310> all<00:03:41.519> these

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
it has to do I never took all these

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.130 
it has to do I never took all these
vitamins<00:03:42.209> until<00:03:42.570> maybe<00:03:44.480> six<00:03:45.480> seven<00:03:45.870> years<00:03:45.989> ago

00:03:46.130 --> 00:03:46.140
