00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.029 
grow quickly you don't want to put down
so<00:00:14.730> many<00:00:14.849> seeds<00:00:15.410> that<00:00:16.410> when<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> plants

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
so many seeds that when the plants

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:18.890 
so many seeds that when the plants
mature<00:00:17.220> you<00:00:17.910> have<00:00:18.060> more<00:00:18.210> vegetables<00:00:18.390> than<00:00:18.750> you

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
mature you have more vegetables than you

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.960 
mature you have more vegetables than you
can<00:00:19.050> eat<00:00:19.170> so<00:00:20.010> one<00:00:20.189> of<00:00:20.220> the<00:00:20.400> things<00:00:20.699> that<00:00:20.880> you

can eat so one of the things that you
can<00:00:21.150> do<00:00:21.890> is<00:00:22.890> plant<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.640> case<00:00:23.880> radishes<00:00:24.359> in

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:26.810 
can do is plant in this case radishes in

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.599 
can do is plant in this case radishes in
waves<00:00:27.810> so<00:00:28.320> this<00:00:28.500> was<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> first<00:00:29.070> wave<00:00:29.310> that<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
waves so this was the first wave that I

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.170 
waves so this was the first wave that I
planted<00:00:29.970> back<00:00:30.539> in<00:00:30.750> March<00:00:31.130> they<00:00:32.130> did<00:00:32.340> get<00:00:32.579> hit

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
planted back in March they did get hit

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.580 
planted back in March they did get hit
by<00:00:33.360> Frost<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:33.899> they're<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.079> little<00:00:34.230> slow<00:00:34.530> to

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
by Frost so they're a little slow to

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.750 
by Frost so they're a little slow to
grow<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.540> as<00:00:36.540> these<00:00:36.780> mature<00:00:37.430> are<00:00:38.430> as<00:00:38.550> these

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
grow and as these mature are as these

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.569 
grow and as these mature are as these
were<00:00:38.910> growing<00:00:39.530> about<00:00:40.530> every<00:00:40.739> 2<00:00:40.890> to<00:00:40.920> 3<00:00:41.040> weeks<00:00:41.250> I

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
were growing about every 2 to 3 weeks I

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.639 
were growing about every 2 to 3 weeks I
planted<00:00:41.969> additional<00:00:42.930> radishes<00:00:43.260> which<00:00:43.530> I'll

together they sort of grow a long white

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.520 
together they sort of grow a long white
taproot<00:01:54.090> and<00:01:54.270> this<00:01:54.479> will<00:01:54.630> get<00:01:54.810> two<00:01:55.290> or<00:01:55.409> three

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
taproot and this will get two or three

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:56.929 
taproot and this will get two or three
times<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.829> size<00:01:55.920> actually<00:01:56.280> before<00:01:56.790> they're

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
times the size actually before they're

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.410

this<00:02:39.390> way<00:02:39.629> you<00:02:40.349> don't<00:02:40.379> plan<00:02:40.709> everything<00:02:40.980> at

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
this way you don't plan everything at

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:42.259 
this way you don't plan everything at
once<00:02:41.370> and<00:02:41.580> then<00:02:41.670> end<00:02:41.819> up<00:02:41.910> with<00:02:42.060> so<00:02:42.180> many

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269
