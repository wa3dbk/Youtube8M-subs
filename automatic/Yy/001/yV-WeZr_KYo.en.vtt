looks really good give you a side view
of<00:00:58.410> it<00:00:58.559> right<00:00:58.739> there<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:02.160> back<00:01:02.430> sets<00:01:02.730> up<00:01:02.910> a

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
of it right there the back sets up a

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.850 
of it right there the back sets up a
little<00:01:03.300> higher<00:01:03.539> but<00:01:03.570> I<00:01:04.019> want<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.470> to<00:01:04.559> be<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
little higher but I want it to be that

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
way so that when I put my quad on the

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200 
way so that when I put my quad on the
back<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.650> stuff<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.220> truck<00:01:08.430> doesn't<00:01:08.760> sag<00:01:09.060> in

under coating worked really well looks a
lot<00:01:54.100> better<00:01:54.340> than<00:01:54.430> surface<00:01:55.060> rust<00:01:55.360> because

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:56.200 
lot better than surface rust because

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.230 
lot better than surface rust because
this<00:01:56.500> truck<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> 98<00:01:57.430> so<00:01:57.670> obviously<00:01:58.060> there

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
this truck is a 98 so obviously there

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.920 
this truck is a 98 so obviously there
was<00:01:58.390> some<00:01:58.630> surface<00:01:58.990> rust<00:01:59.730> but<00:02:00.730> just<00:02:01.420> ground<00:02:01.780> it

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
was some surface rust but just ground it

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:03.120 
was some surface rust but just ground it
down<00:02:02.080> a<00:02:02.110> little<00:02:02.290> bit<00:02:02.440> with<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:02.740> die<00:02:02.860> grinder

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
down a little bit with the die grinder

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.620
