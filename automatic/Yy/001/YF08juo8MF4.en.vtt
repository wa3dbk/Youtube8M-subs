recommend highly for shadow work because
it's<00:01:58.680> about<00:01:58.920> one<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.310> a<00:01:59.369> half<00:01:59.430> times<00:01:59.880> the

therefore<00:02:02.430> you<00:02:02.579> get<00:02:02.790> a<00:02:03.000> lot<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.630> nice<00:02:04.259> coverage

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
therefore you get a lot of nice coverage

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:07.550 
therefore you get a lot of nice coverage
on<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.520> back<00:02:05.790> and<00:02:06.060> that's<00:02:06.750> very<00:02:07.049> important

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.500 
opening in the fabric the next thing I
use<00:02:47.450> is<00:02:47.720> a<00:02:48.100> shaping<00:02:49.100> board<00:02:49.580> or<00:02:49.910> a<00:02:49.940> pinning

you put on the fabric must be accurate

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.070 
you put on the fabric must be accurate
because<00:02:58.940> if<00:02:59.090> they're<00:02:59.239> not<00:02:59.269> it's<00:02:59.750> going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> be

because if they're not it's going to be

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.229 
because if they're not it's going to be
very<00:03:00.260> difficult<00:03:00.590> to<00:03:00.890> get<00:03:01.069> the<00:03:01.220> line<00:03:01.819> straight

and<00:03:18.019> shadow<00:03:18.350> work<00:03:18.590> is<00:03:18.769> so<00:03:19.190> important<00:03:19.820> to<00:03:19.910> get

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
and shadow work is so important to get

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.750 
and shadow work is so important to get
the<00:03:20.180> fabric<00:03:20.390> nice<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:21.200> taut<00:03:21.440> in<00:03:21.739> the<00:03:22.130> frame<00:03:22.459> so

angle<00:05:48.610> rather<00:05:48.759> and<00:05:49.149> then<00:05:49.839> pull<00:05:50.830> the<00:05:51.069> fabric

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
angle rather and then pull the fabric

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:55.110 
angle rather and then pull the fabric
down<00:05:51.669> tightly<00:05:52.539> not<00:05:53.289> super<00:05:53.800> tight<00:05:54.039> but<00:05:54.249> tightly

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120 
down tightly not super tight but tightly

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:56.969 
down tightly not super tight but tightly
so<00:05:55.330> that<00:05:55.479> it's<00:05:55.599> smooth<00:05:55.960> across<00:05:56.259> the<00:05:56.589> design

00:05:56.969 --> 00:05:56.979 
so that it's smooth across the design

00:05:56.979 --> 00:05:59.249 
so that it's smooth across the design
and<00:05:57.339> we're<00:05:57.879> going<00:05:57.999> to<00:05:58.029> pin<00:05:58.389> the<00:05:58.629> design<00:05:58.990> down

00:05:59.249 --> 00:05:59.259 
and we're going to pin the design down

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:03.059 
and we're going to pin the design down
on<00:05:59.639> all<00:06:00.639> four<00:06:01.210> corners<00:06:01.569> are<00:06:01.990> all<00:06:02.499> four<00:06:02.770> sides

00:06:03.059 --> 00:06:03.069 
on all four corners are all four sides

00:06:03.069 --> 00:06:05.969 
on all four corners are all four sides
and<00:06:03.399> then<00:06:04.060> every<00:06:04.659> inch<00:06:04.930> and<00:06:05.169> a<00:06:05.199> half<00:06:05.229> or<00:06:05.740> so

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:05.979 
and then every inch and a half or so

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:07.889 
and then every inch and a half or so
we're<00:06:06.219> going<00:06:06.339> to<00:06:06.399> put<00:06:06.580> another<00:06:06.669> pin<00:06:07.209> we're

00:06:07.889 --> 00:06:07.899 
we're going to put another pin we're

00:06:07.899 --> 00:06:09.779 
we're going to put another pin we're
going<00:06:08.020> to<00:06:08.110> keep<00:06:08.319> doing<00:06:08.620> this<00:06:08.740> until<00:06:08.800> you<00:06:09.610> have

00:06:09.779 --> 00:06:09.789 
going to keep doing this until you have

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:12.739 
going to keep doing this until you have
pins<00:06:10.120> completely<00:06:10.959> around<00:06:11.319> the<00:06:11.889> design<00:06:12.310> and

00:06:12.739 --> 00:06:12.749 
pins completely around the design and

00:06:12.749 --> 00:06:15.570 
pins completely around the design and
leave<00:06:13.749> enough<00:06:14.110> space<00:06:14.139> inside<00:06:15.039> that<00:06:15.279> you<00:06:15.399> can

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:15.580 
leave enough space inside that you can

00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:18.540 
leave enough space inside that you can
trace<00:06:15.909> the<00:06:15.939> design<00:06:16.509> now<00:06:17.349> I'm<00:06:17.589> trained<00:06:18.279> as<00:06:18.399> an

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:18.550 
trace the design now I'm trained as an

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:20.699 
trace the design now I'm trained as an
artist<00:06:18.969> and<00:06:19.209> I<00:06:19.569> know<00:06:19.930> this<00:06:20.229> is<00:06:20.409> an<00:06:20.560> unusual

00:06:20.699 --> 00:06:20.709 
artist and I know this is an unusual

00:06:20.709 --> 00:06:23.309 
artist and I know this is an unusual
thing<00:06:21.550> to<00:06:21.580> mention<00:06:21.939> but<00:06:22.360> a<00:06:22.569> lot<00:06:22.899> of<00:06:22.930> people

00:06:23.309 --> 00:06:23.319 
thing to mention but a lot of people

00:06:23.319 --> 00:06:25.559 
thing to mention but a lot of people
like<00:06:23.499> to<00:06:23.529> sketch<00:06:24.159> as<00:06:24.430> they<00:06:24.610> draw<00:06:24.879> actually

00:06:25.559 --> 00:06:25.569 
like to sketch as they draw actually

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:27.989 
like to sketch as they draw actually
it's<00:06:26.110> best<00:06:26.529> if<00:06:26.770> you<00:06:26.830> hold<00:06:27.249> the<00:06:27.520> pen<00:06:27.699> down

00:06:27.989 --> 00:06:27.999 
it's best if you hold the pen down

00:06:27.999 --> 00:06:30.209 
it's best if you hold the pen down
against<00:06:28.449> the<00:06:28.539> fabric<00:06:28.779> and<00:06:29.139> draw<00:06:29.680> your<00:06:29.919> lines

00:06:30.209 --> 00:06:30.219 
against the fabric and draw your lines

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:33.989 
against the fabric and draw your lines
with<00:06:30.939> one<00:06:31.330> fell<00:06:31.839> swoop<00:06:31.899> and<00:06:32.709> instead<00:06:33.249> of<00:06:33.399> doing

00:06:33.989 --> 00:06:33.999 
with one fell swoop and instead of doing

00:06:33.999 --> 00:06:35.939 
with one fell swoop and instead of doing
a<00:06:34.089> sketchy<00:06:34.479> type<00:06:34.839> of<00:06:34.990> drawing<00:06:35.229> this<00:06:35.529> makes<00:06:35.770> a

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:35.949 
a sketchy type of drawing this makes a

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:39.480 
a sketchy type of drawing this makes a
clearer<00:06:36.669> more<00:06:37.419> accurate<00:06:38.139> line<00:06:38.379> bring<00:06:39.310> your

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:39.490 
clearer more accurate line bring your

00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:42.329 
clearer more accurate line bring your
pen<00:06:39.699> around<00:06:40.060> now<00:06:40.749> if<00:06:40.990> you're<00:06:41.139> using<00:06:41.169> this<00:06:41.709> this

00:06:42.329 --> 00:06:42.339 
pen around now if you're using this this

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:44.969 
pen around now if you're using this this
water<00:06:42.729> soluble<00:06:43.089> pen<00:06:43.629> you<00:06:44.319> know<00:06:44.499> that<00:06:44.680> it<00:06:44.740> gets

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 
water soluble pen you know that it gets

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:47.189 
water soluble pen you know that it gets
darker<00:06:45.610> as<00:06:45.789> it<00:06:46.060> dries<00:06:46.360> so<00:06:46.689> you<00:06:46.749> don't<00:06:47.050> really

00:06:47.189 --> 00:06:47.199 
darker as it dries so you don't really

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.989 
darker as it dries so you don't really
have<00:06:47.409> to<00:06:47.560> keep<00:06:47.709> going<00:06:47.889> over<00:06:48.339> it<00:06:48.370> and<00:06:48.459> over<00:06:48.819> and

00:06:48.989 --> 00:06:48.999 
have to keep going over it and over and

00:06:48.999 --> 00:06:51.809 
have to keep going over it and over and
over<00:06:49.209> it<00:06:49.300> until<00:06:49.419> it's<00:06:49.839> so<00:06:50.529> fat<00:06:51.189> that<00:06:51.459> you<00:06:51.550> can't

00:06:51.809 --> 00:06:51.819 
over it until it's so fat that you can't
