all<00:00:01.650> right<00:00:01.800> so<00:00:01.949> let's<00:00:02.129> try<00:00:02.250> to<00:00:02.310> put<00:00:02.429> on<00:00:02.639> a<00:00:02.730> set

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
all right so let's try to put on a set

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:04.190 
all right so let's try to put on a set
of<00:00:02.939> knives<00:00:03.179> into<00:00:03.449> this<00:00:03.659> planer

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:04.200 
of knives into this planer

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.220 
of knives into this planer
these<00:00:04.770> Springs<00:00:05.600> provide<00:00:06.600> some<00:00:06.839> upward

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:07.230 
these Springs provide some upward

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.709 
these Springs provide some upward
pressure<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.799> the<00:00:08.040> blade<00:00:08.849> when<00:00:09.570> you're

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
pressure on the blade when you're

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.499 
pressure on the blade when you're
setting<00:00:10.050> the<00:00:10.080> height<00:00:10.320> so<00:00:10.769> it's<00:00:11.700> nice<00:00:11.849> to<00:00:11.880> put

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
setting the height so it's nice to put

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.860 
setting the height so it's nice to put
those<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.809> place<00:00:12.960> with<00:00:13.469> a<00:00:13.740> couple<00:00:14.309> of<00:00:14.809> with<00:00:15.809> a

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
those in place with a couple of with a

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.439 
those in place with a couple of with a
needle<00:00:16.170> pair<00:00:16.350> of<00:00:16.410> needle<00:00:16.650> nose<00:00:16.800> pliers<00:00:17.449> next

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
needle pair of needle nose pliers next

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.590 
needle pair of needle nose pliers next
thing<00:00:18.570> is<00:00:18.690> going<00:00:18.810> to<00:00:18.900> go<00:00:19.050> in<00:00:19.170> places<00:00:19.650> this<00:00:19.830> gibb

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:20.600 
thing is going to go in places this gibb

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.359 
thing is going to go in places this gibb
next<00:00:21.600> thing<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:22.020> the<00:00:22.230> blade<00:00:22.470> itself<00:00:22.890> right<00:00:23.310> so

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
next thing is the blade itself right so

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.179 
next thing is the blade itself right so
now<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:23.850> can<00:00:24.060> see<00:00:24.210> the<00:00:24.330> blades<00:00:24.570> in<00:00:24.750> place<00:00:25.189> the

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
now you can see the blades in place the

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.419 
now you can see the blades in place the
springs<00:00:26.640> right<00:00:26.910> there<00:00:27.210> are<00:00:27.449> what<00:00:28.220> keeps<00:00:29.220> it

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
springs right there are what keeps it

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.220 
springs right there are what keeps it
pressed<00:00:29.820> up<00:00:30.090> the<00:00:30.539> last<00:00:30.750> part<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> this

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
pressed up the last part of this

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.310 
pressed up the last part of this
procedure<00:00:31.590> is<00:00:32.360> to<00:00:33.360> lower<00:00:33.570> that<00:00:33.809> blade<00:00:34.079> to<00:00:34.230> the

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
procedure is to lower that blade to the

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.840 
procedure is to lower that blade to the
correct<00:00:34.620> height<00:00:34.710> and<00:00:35.160> then<00:00:35.309> tighten<00:00:35.700> those

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
correct height and then tighten those

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.360 
correct height and then tighten those
bolts<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.570> I'm<00:00:37.500> going<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.800> do<00:00:37.890> that<00:00:38.070> with<00:00:38.250> this

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
bolts and I'm going to do that with this

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.330 
bolts and I'm going to do that with this
little<00:00:38.670> blade<00:00:38.850> setting<00:00:39.390> tool<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:40.590> came<00:00:41.160> with

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
little blade setting tool that came with

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.150 
little blade setting tool that came with
my<00:00:41.370> planer<00:00:42.050> there's<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.110> little<00:00:43.350> indentation

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
my planer there's a little indentation

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.040 
my planer there's a little indentation
right<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:45.149> on<00:00:45.450> the<00:00:45.570> end<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.579> that<00:00:48.050> correctly

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
right here on the end and that correctly

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.529 
right here on the end and that correctly
sets<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.620> height<00:00:49.860> of<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> blade<00:00:50.789> off<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
sets the height of the blade off of the

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.340 
sets the height of the blade off of the
cutter<00:00:51.860> roller<00:00:52.860> head<00:00:53.190> all<00:00:54.030> right<00:00:54.090> so<00:00:55.050> I'm

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
cutter roller head all right so I'm

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.750 
cutter roller head all right so I'm
putting<00:00:55.800> that<00:00:55.890> over<00:00:55.949> those<00:00:56.309> blades<00:00:56.550> very

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
putting that over those blades very

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.510 
putting that over those blades very
gently<00:00:57.480> I<00:00:57.570> it's<00:00:58.469> metal<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:58.980> metal<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.489> I

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
gently I it's metal on metal so I

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.810 
gently I it's metal on metal so I
certainly<00:00:59.850> don't<00:01:00.329> want<00:01:00.629> to<00:01:01.160> ding<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.399> nice

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
certainly don't want to ding that nice

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.130 
certainly don't want to ding that nice
crisp<00:01:03.270> edge<00:01:03.570> ship<00:01:04.500> it<00:01:04.680> right<00:01:05.400> there<00:01:05.869> sets<00:01:06.869> my

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
crisp edge ship it right there sets my

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.330 
crisp edge ship it right there sets my
height<00:01:07.430> and<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.580> generally<00:01:08.880> do<00:01:09.420> is<00:01:10.340> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
height and what I generally do is I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.149 
height and what I generally do is I
tighten<00:01:13.340> one<00:01:14.340> end<00:01:14.610> first<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.890> one<00:01:16.890> middle

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
tighten one end first and one middle

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.390 
tighten one end first and one middle
bolt<00:01:17.990> then<00:01:18.990> I<00:01:19.110> make<00:01:19.320> sure<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.650> other<00:01:19.860> end<00:01:20.159> is

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
bolt then I make sure the other end is

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.649 
bolt then I make sure the other end is
at<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.640> right<00:01:22.009> height<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.790> then<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.509> go<00:01:24.630> back

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
at the right height and then I go back

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.740 
at the right height and then I go back
and<00:01:24.840> tighten<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.500> them<00:01:26.270> like<00:01:27.270> I<00:01:27.420> said<00:01:27.630> you

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
and tighten all of them like I said you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.319 
and tighten all of them like I said you
really<00:01:28.259> want<00:01:28.409> to<00:01:28.500> do<00:01:28.619> this<00:01:28.770> nice<00:01:29.009> and<00:01:29.329> gently

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:30.329 
really want to do this nice and gently

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.990 
really want to do this nice and gently
when<00:01:30.990> you're<00:01:31.140> messing<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.500> your<00:01:31.710> blade

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:48.999 

because<00:01:36.000> you<00:01:36.119> can<00:01:36.240> ship<00:01:36.450> them<00:01:37.340> tighten<00:01:38.340> that

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.230 

kind<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.040> hard<00:01:50.250> to<00:01:50.280> do<00:01:50.460> with<00:01:50.579> a<00:01:50.670> camera<00:01:50.909> right

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
kind of hard to do with a camera right

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.609 
kind of hard to do with a camera right
in<00:01:51.329> my<00:01:51.450> face<00:01:51.689> -<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:53.390> look<00:01:54.390> like<00:01:54.509> I'm<00:01:54.720> kind<00:01:54.990> 1z

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
in my face - so look like I'm kind 1z

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.010 
in my face - so look like I'm kind 1z
doing<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.340> I'm<00:01:57.240> just<00:01:57.450> trying<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:57.960> not

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
doing this but I'm just trying to not

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.380 
doing this but I'm just trying to not
bang<00:01:58.409> into<00:01:58.710> the<00:01:58.799> camera<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.909> can<00:02:00.119> start

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
bang into the camera and I can start

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.450 
bang into the camera and I can start
tightening<00:02:00.750> these<00:02:00.990> give<00:02:01.890> bolts<00:02:02.220> in<00:02:02.369> the

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
tightening these give bolts in the

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.560 
tightening these give bolts in the
center<00:02:04.399> anyway<00:02:05.399> that's<00:02:05.820> it<00:02:06.000> that's<00:02:06.240> how<00:02:06.509> you

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
center anyway that's it that's how you

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.779 
center anyway that's it that's how you
tighten<00:02:07.020> or<00:02:07.530> how<00:02:07.740> you<00:02:07.799> install<00:02:08.280> some<00:02:08.580> planer

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
tighten or how you install some planer

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.860 
tighten or how you install some planer
blades<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.860> you<00:02:10.860> can<00:02:10.979> see<00:02:11.130> that<00:02:11.250> took<00:02:11.430> me<00:02:11.610> what

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
blades and you can see that took me what

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:14.509 
blades and you can see that took me what
three<00:02:12.870> or<00:02:12.930> four<00:02:13.110> minutes<00:02:13.410> to<00:02:13.950> put<00:02:14.220> this<00:02:14.310> one

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:14.519 
three or four minutes to put this one

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:20.150 
three or four minutes to put this one
blade<00:02:14.760> in<00:02:16.400> with<00:02:17.400> that<00:02:18.350> knife<00:02:19.350> setting<00:02:19.739> tool<00:02:19.980> it

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
blade in with that knife setting tool it

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:24.559 
blade in with that knife setting tool it
goes<00:02:20.310> pretty<00:02:20.519> quickly<00:02:21.500> maybe<00:02:22.500> five<00:02:23.239> six<00:02:24.239> seven

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:24.569 
goes pretty quickly maybe five six seven

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.250 
goes pretty quickly maybe five six seven
minutes<00:02:24.840> per<00:02:25.049> blade<00:02:26.150> you<00:02:27.150> can<00:02:27.260> probably

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
minutes per blade you can probably

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.170
