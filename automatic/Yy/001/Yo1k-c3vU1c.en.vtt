00:01:13.779 --> 00:01:13.789 
total of sixty one and a half what do

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:15.550 
total of sixty one and a half what do
you<00:01:13.850> think<00:01:14.030> could<00:01:14.810> be<00:01:14.960> right<00:01:15.170> but<00:01:15.350> I'm<00:01:15.440> gonna

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:15.560 
you think could be right but I'm gonna

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.109 
you think could be right but I'm gonna
roll<00:01:15.710> with<00:01:15.860> Georgia<00:01:16.310> in<00:01:16.520> this<00:01:16.670> football<00:01:17.090> game

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
roll with Georgia in this football game

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.300 
roll with Georgia in this football game
feat<00:01:17.540> I<00:01:17.659> think<00:01:18.080> the<00:01:18.229> three<00:01:18.500> points<00:01:18.950> think<00:01:19.130> both

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
feat I think the three points think both

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.500 
feat I think the three points think both
these<00:01:19.460> teams<00:01:19.670> are<00:01:19.820> pretty<00:01:19.909> evenly<00:01:20.210> matched

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:20.510 
these teams are pretty evenly matched

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.719 
these teams are pretty evenly matched
but<00:01:21.440> I<00:01:21.530> think<00:01:21.710> home-field<00:01:22.130> advantage<00:01:22.640> is

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
but I think home-field advantage is

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:24.250 
but I think home-field advantage is
really<00:01:22.970> going<00:01:23.060> to<00:01:23.119> play<00:01:23.330> its<00:01:23.510> toll<00:01:23.720> on<00:01:23.750> this<00:01:24.049> 1p

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
really going to play its toll on this 1p

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.840 
really going to play its toll on this 1p
that's<00:01:24.710> why<00:01:24.830> I'm<00:01:24.890> gonna<00:01:25.040> roll<00:01:25.220> with<00:01:25.369> Georgia

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
that's why I'm gonna roll with Georgia

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.000 
that's why I'm gonna roll with Georgia
Georgia<00:01:26.540> you<00:01:26.930> know<00:01:27.020> they<00:01:27.140> had<00:01:27.409> a<00:01:27.470> tough<00:01:27.680> tough

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.010 
Georgia you know they had a tough tough

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.469 
Georgia you know they had a tough tough

they're<00:01:29.750> starting<00:01:30.110> to<00:01:30.140> play<00:01:30.380> better<00:01:30.409> football

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
they're starting to play better football

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.420 
they're starting to play better football
I<00:01:31.490> know<00:01:31.939> LSU's<00:01:32.750> very<00:01:33.380> very<00:01:33.710> good<00:01:33.920> Les<00:01:34.159> Miles

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:34.430 
I know LSU's very very good Les Miles

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.609 
I know LSU's very very good Les Miles
got<00:01:34.820> playing<00:01:35.150> good<00:01:35.270> football<00:01:35.510> but<00:01:35.869> wasn't<00:01:36.470> too

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:36.619 
got playing good football but wasn't too

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:38.080 
got playing good football but wasn't too
impressed<00:01:36.770> with<00:01:37.280> what<00:01:37.460> they<00:01:37.580> did<00:01:37.790> against

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
impressed with what they did against

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:39.609 
impressed with what they did against
Auburn<00:01:38.450> only<00:01:38.689> beat<00:01:38.869> them<00:01:39.020> by<00:01:39.080> two<00:01:39.229> touchdowns

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
Auburn only beat them by two touchdowns

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.649 
Auburn only beat them by two touchdowns
kind<00:01:40.610> of<00:01:40.670> took<00:01:40.820> the<00:01:40.880> foot<00:01:41.180> off<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.509> gas

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
kind of took the foot off the gas

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.300 
kind of took the foot off the gas
against<00:01:42.140> the<00:01:42.290> offer<00:01:42.409> and<00:01:42.619> kind<00:01:42.799> of<00:01:42.860> let<00:01:43.040> down<00:01:43.280> a

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:43.310 
against the offer and kind of let down a

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.429 
against the offer and kind of let down a
bit<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.970> think<00:01:44.479> it<00:01:44.570> could<00:01:44.780> be<00:01:44.900> too<00:01:45.080> big<00:01:45.259> of<00:01:45.380> a

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:45.439 
bit I think it could be too big of a

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:47.109 
bit I think it could be too big of a
challenge<00:01:45.650> for<00:01:46.009> LSU<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.549> I<00:01:46.610> think<00:01:46.790> George<00:01:47.030> is

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
challenge for LSU and I think George is

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:49.060 
challenge for LSU and I think George is
going<00:01:47.270> to<00:01:47.360> win<00:01:47.540> this<00:01:47.689> football<00:01:47.930> game<00:01:48.200> can<00:01:49.040> be

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
going to win this football game can be

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.859 
going to win this football game can be
decided<00:01:49.670> by<00:01:49.790> a<00:01:49.820> touchdown<00:01:50.150> but<00:01:50.450> I<00:01:50.659> think

00:01:50.859 --> 00:01:50.869 
decided by a touchdown but I think

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:52.780 
decided by a touchdown but I think
Georgia<00:01:51.200> takes<00:01:51.409> care<00:01:51.680> of<00:01:51.710> business<00:01:52.100> at<00:01:52.280> home<00:01:52.580> I

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:52.790 
Georgia takes care of business at home I

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.359 
Georgia takes care of business at home I
think<00:01:52.820> like<00:01:53.360> I<00:01:53.479> said<00:01:53.750> talent<00:01:54.259> for<00:01:54.380> talent<00:01:54.829> very

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
think like I said talent for talent very

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:56.980 
think like I said talent for talent very
even<00:01:55.850> but<00:01:55.970> I<00:01:56.030> think<00:01:56.180> home<00:01:56.360> field<00:01:56.600> advantage

00:01:56.980 --> 00:01:56.990 
even but I think home field advantage

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.109 
even but I think home field advantage
plays<00:01:57.259> a<00:01:57.290> big<00:01:57.710> part<00:01:57.740> in<00:01:58.100> this<00:01:58.189> football<00:01:58.640> game<00:01:58.670> I

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
plays a big part in this football game I

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:01.179 
plays a big part in this football game I
like<00:01:59.630> George<00:01:59.960> and<00:02:00.140> my<00:02:00.259> history<00:02:00.710> in<00:02:00.799> this<00:02:00.950> one

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
like George and my history in this one

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:02.859 
like George and my history in this one
you<00:02:01.460> think<00:02:01.670> home<00:02:01.790> field<00:02:02.000> means<00:02:02.210> that<00:02:02.450> much<00:02:02.689> I

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:02.869 
you think home field means that much I

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:04.120 
you think home field means that much I
mean<00:02:03.049> when<00:02:03.140> you<00:02:03.229> look<00:02:03.259> at<00:02:03.439> this<00:02:03.560> game<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.009> know

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
mean when you look at this game you know

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.280 
mean when you look at this game you know
basically<00:02:04.549> what<00:02:04.759> you<00:02:04.909> have<00:02:04.939> is<00:02:05.360> two<00:02:05.720> super

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
basically what you have is two super

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.560 
basically what you have is two super
awesome<00:02:06.650> teams<00:02:06.890> right<00:02:07.159> super<00:02:07.549> awesome<00:02:07.880> top<00:02:08.360> 10

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
awesome teams right super awesome top 10

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.350 
awesome teams right super awesome top 10
sec<00:02:09.229> squads<00:02:09.649> and<00:02:09.950> so<00:02:10.729> I'm<00:02:10.880> not<00:02:11.000> sure<00:02:11.060> how<00:02:11.180> you

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
sec squads and so I'm not sure how you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.090 
sec squads and so I'm not sure how you
can<00:02:11.540> look<00:02:11.660> at<00:02:11.780> this<00:02:11.840> game<00:02:12.049> and<00:02:12.230> get<00:02:12.650> any<00:02:12.829> kind

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
can look at this game and get any kind

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.440 
can look at this game and get any kind
of<00:02:13.190> angle<00:02:13.519> but<00:02:13.610> you<00:02:13.730> think<00:02:13.970> that<00:02:14.180> the

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
of angle but you think that the

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.699 
of angle but you think that the
home-field<00:02:14.720> advantage<00:02:15.230> is<00:02:15.350> going<00:02:15.470> to<00:02:15.530> be<00:02:15.680> a

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:15.709 
home-field advantage is going to be a

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:17.920 
home-field advantage is going to be a
worth<00:02:15.980> more<00:02:16.190> than<00:02:16.280> a<00:02:16.370> field<00:02:16.549> goal<00:02:16.670> here<00:02:16.880> I<00:02:17.090> do<00:02:17.630> I

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 
worth more than a field goal here I do I

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.319 
worth more than a field goal here I do I
really<00:02:17.989> do<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.709> this<00:02:18.829> one<00:02:19.040> Pete<00:02:19.280> sec<00:02:19.880> home

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:20.329 
really do in this one Pete sec home

00:02:20.329 --> 00:02:22.150 
really do in this one Pete sec home
field<00:02:20.600> advantage<00:02:21.019> seems<00:02:21.230> to<00:02:21.320> be<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.470> huge<00:02:21.889> deal

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
field advantage seems to be a huge deal

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.910 
field advantage seems to be a huge deal
you're<00:02:22.790> in<00:02:22.970> and<00:02:23.120> year<00:02:23.269> out<00:02:23.299> George<00:02:24.169> is<00:02:24.350> great

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
you're in and year out George is great

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.920 
you're in and year out George is great
all<00:02:25.099> I<00:02:25.430> think<00:02:25.819> that<00:02:25.970> crowd<00:02:26.270> noise<00:02:26.569> really

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
all I think that crowd noise really

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.570 
all I think that crowd noise really
going<00:02:27.140> to<00:02:27.200> elevate<00:02:27.349> their<00:02:27.800> defense<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.459> this

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
going to elevate their defense in this

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.729 
going to elevate their defense in this
one<00:02:28.849> I<00:02:29.090> think<00:02:29.510> their<00:02:29.630> offense<00:02:30.080> is<00:02:30.260> actually

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
one I think their offense is actually

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:32.620 
one I think their offense is actually
better<00:02:31.040> than<00:02:31.220> lsu's<00:02:31.910> offense<00:02:31.940> I<00:02:32.450> think

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
better than lsu's offense I think

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.540 
better than lsu's offense I think
they'll<00:02:32.810> be<00:02:33.500> able<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.709> get<00:02:34.010> things<00:02:34.310> done

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:34.550 
they'll be able to get things done

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:36.729 
they'll be able to get things done
offensively<00:02:35.140> defensively<00:02:36.140> I<00:02:36.260> think<00:02:36.590> they'll

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:36.739 
offensively defensively I think they'll

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.920 
offensively defensively I think they'll
do<00:02:36.920> just<00:02:36.950> enough<00:02:37.489> to<00:02:37.940> win<00:02:38.120> this<00:02:38.239> game<00:02:38.450> by<00:02:38.630> touch

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
do just enough to win this game by touch

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.900 
do just enough to win this game by touch
now<00:02:39.170> I<00:02:39.440> do<00:02:39.800> like<00:02:40.069> the<00:02:40.099> over<00:02:40.520> i<00:02:40.550> think<00:02:40.790> it's

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:40.910 
now I do like the over i think it's

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.449 
now I do like the over i think it's
going<00:02:41.030> to<00:02:41.090> be<00:02:41.150> about<00:02:41.270> a<00:02:41.470> 38-31<00:02:42.470> game<00:02:42.950> georgia

I<00:02:53.420> think<00:02:53.750> the<00:02:53.840> biggest<00:02:54.019> x<00:02:54.290> factor<00:02:54.680> is<00:02:54.800> Georges

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
I think the biggest x factor is Georges

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:56.949 
I think the biggest x factor is Georges
