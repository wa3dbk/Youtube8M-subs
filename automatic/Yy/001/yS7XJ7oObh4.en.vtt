00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.409 
layer above it simply just change the

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:09.570 
layer above it simply just change the
color<00:02:05.850> I'm<00:02:06.850> going<00:02:07.030> to<00:02:07.119> use<00:02:07.950> probably<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> purple

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.099 

I'm<00:02:36.230> trying<00:02:36.439> to<00:02:36.530> do<00:02:36.650> is<00:02:36.799> quickest<00:02:37.129> possible

I'm trying to do is quickest possible
obviously<00:02:39.109> you<00:02:39.200> spend<00:02:39.469> a<00:02:39.680> lot<00:02:39.950> more<00:02:39.980> time

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:40.400 
obviously you spend a lot more time

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:52.599 
obviously you spend a lot more time
doing<00:02:40.700> this<00:02:50.170> okay<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.890> then<00:02:52.129> what<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.340> do<00:02:52.579> is

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:52.609 
doing this okay and then what you do is

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:59.789 
doing this okay and then what you do is
go<00:02:52.879> over<00:02:52.909> the<00:02:53.239> eraser<00:02:53.629> tool<00:02:56.859> and<00:02:57.859> go<00:02:58.099> over<00:02:58.310> it

okay something like that then what you

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.750 
okay something like that then what you
would<00:04:29.100> do<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.490> just<00:04:29.640> go<00:04:29.820> into<00:04:30.210> image

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:31.760 
would do is just go into image

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:43.559 
would do is just go into image
adjustments<00:04:32.760> levels

00:04:43.559 --> 00:04:43.569 

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:49.790 

so<00:04:44.289> you're<00:04:44.409> trying<00:04:44.559> to<00:04:44.649> get<00:04:44.800> the<00:04:44.889> color<00:04:45.129> from

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:57.419 

them<00:04:54.389> right<00:04:55.389> okay<00:04:55.929> hopefully<00:04:56.889> something<00:04:57.129> like

00:04:57.419 --> 00:04:57.429 
them right okay hopefully something like

00:04:57.429 --> 00:05:15.109 
them right okay hopefully something like
that<00:04:57.610> and<00:04:57.819> then<00:04:58.119> not<00:04:58.949> shellfish<00:04:59.949> work

00:05:15.109 --> 00:05:15.119 

00:05:15.119 --> 00:05:19.949 

something<00:05:16.119> like<00:05:16.360> that<00:05:17.999> there<00:05:18.999> we<00:05:19.089> go<00:05:19.270> is<00:05:19.689> the

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:19.959 
something like that there we go is the

something like that there we go is the
purple<00:05:20.589> a<00:05:21.330> color<00:05:22.330> that's<00:05:22.689> the<00:05:22.959> only<00:05:23.080> problem

00:05:23.369 --> 00:05:23.379 
purple a color that's the only problem

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:27.839 
purple a color that's the only problem
you<00:05:24.300> could<00:05:25.300> always<00:05:25.919> change<00:05:26.919> it<00:05:27.159> if<00:05:27.279> you<00:05:27.430> once

00:05:27.839 --> 00:05:27.849 
you could always change it if you once

00:05:27.849 --> 00:05:29.189 
you could always change it if you once
you've<00:05:28.059> got<00:05:28.209> the<00:05:28.330> kind<00:05:28.599> of<00:05:28.749> look<00:05:28.930> that<00:05:29.110> you're

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:29.199 
you've got the kind of look that you're

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:37.439 
you've got the kind of look that you're
looking<00:05:29.319> for<00:05:29.499> I<00:05:33.089> don't<00:05:34.089> know<00:05:34.180> i<00:05:34.749> do<00:05:35.819> then<00:05:36.819> go<00:05:37.059> in

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:37.449 
looking for I don't know i do then go in

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:39.779 
looking for I don't know i do then go in
to<00:05:37.899> fill<00:05:38.199> or<00:05:38.409> adjustments<00:05:39.279> hue<00:05:39.699> and

00:05:39.779 --> 00:05:39.789 
to fill or adjustments hue and

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:43.350 
to fill or adjustments hue and
saturation<00:05:39.819> and<00:05:40.719> just<00:05:40.869> colorize<00:05:41.259> it<00:05:42.330> take<00:05:43.330> a

00:05:43.350 --> 00:05:43.360 
saturation and just colorize it take a

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:45.329 
saturation and just colorize it take a
few<00:05:43.749> kind<00:05:44.169> of<00:05:44.229> goes<00:05:44.439> or<00:05:44.709> sometimes<00:05:45.099> I'm<00:05:45.219> going

00:05:45.329 --> 00:05:45.339 
few kind of goes or sometimes I'm going

00:05:45.339 --> 00:05:49.199 
few kind of goes or sometimes I'm going
to<00:05:45.429> work<00:05:45.610> like<00:05:46.499> but<00:05:47.499> they're<00:05:47.740> say<00:05:48.399> you<00:05:48.819> are<00:05:48.999> not

00:05:49.209 --> 00:05:52.769 
to work like but they're say you are not
alone<00:05:50.369> so<00:05:51.369> you<00:05:51.459> wanted<00:05:51.819> that<00:05:52.029> blow<00:05:52.269> change<00:05:52.659> the

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
alone so you wanted that blow change the

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:56.719 
alone so you wanted that blow change the
saturation<00:05:52.930> change<00:05:53.889> the<00:05:54.039> lightness<00:05:54.639> of<00:05:54.669> it

00:05:56.719 --> 00:05:56.729 
saturation change the lightness of it

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:59.579 
saturation change the lightness of it
there's<00:05:57.729> i<00:05:57.999> don't<00:05:58.990> know<00:05:59.079> i'll<00:05:59.199> probably<00:05:59.379> go

00:05:59.579 --> 00:05:59.589 
there's i don't know i'll probably go

00:05:59.589 --> 00:06:01.739 
there's i don't know i'll probably go
for<00:05:59.769> a<00:05:59.829> pinky<00:06:00.369> reddy<00:06:00.639> powerful<00:06:01.149> something

00:06:01.739 --> 00:06:01.749 
for a pinky reddy powerful something

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:07.259 
for a pinky reddy powerful something
like<00:06:01.869> that<00:06:02.019> and<00:06:03.990> yeah<00:06:04.990> there<00:06:05.259> you<00:06:05.379> go<00:06:05.999> my<00:06:06.999> still

00:06:07.259 --> 00:06:07.269 
like that and yeah there you go my still

00:06:07.269 --> 00:06:10.409 
like that and yeah there you go my still
got<00:06:07.449> bits<00:06:07.779> that<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:09.610> know<00:06:09.789> that<00:06:10.119> i<00:06:10.149> should

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
got bits that you know that i should

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.679 
got bits that you know that i should
have<00:06:10.509> raised<00:06:10.839> out<00:06:11.110> around<00:06:11.379> this<00:06:11.919> area<00:06:12.189> here

00:06:12.679 --> 00:06:12.689 
have raised out around this area here

00:06:12.689 --> 00:06:14.999 
have raised out around this area here
there<00:06:13.689> any<00:06:13.869> good<00:06:13.990> thing<00:06:14.229> is<00:06:14.409> it's<00:06:14.559> on<00:06:14.709> a<00:06:14.740> new

00:06:14.999 --> 00:06:15.009 
there any good thing is it's on a new

00:06:15.009 --> 00:06:18.959 
there any good thing is it's on a new
layer<00:06:15.309> above<00:06:16.050> it<00:06:17.050> as<00:06:17.949> you<00:06:18.159> can<00:06:18.279> see<00:06:18.519> it's<00:06:18.819> on<00:06:18.939> a

00:06:18.959 --> 00:06:18.969 
layer above it as you can see it's on a

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:20.519 
layer above it as you can see it's on a
new<00:06:19.149> layer<00:06:19.329> and<00:06:19.569> it's<00:06:19.809> got<00:06:19.959> the<00:06:20.050> colors<00:06:20.349> from

00:06:20.519 --> 00:06:20.529 
new layer and it's got the colors from

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:23.069 
new layer and it's got the colors from
the<00:06:20.680> background<00:06:21.240> hopefully<00:06:22.240> this<00:06:22.569> has<00:06:22.689> helped

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:23.079 
the background hopefully this has helped

00:06:23.079 --> 00:06:26.670 
the background hopefully this has helped
to<00:06:23.409> change<00:06:23.439> color<00:06:24.089> this<00:06:25.089> principle<00:06:25.719> work<00:06:26.169> for

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680 
to change color this principle work for

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.920 
to change color this principle work for
hair<00:06:26.889> as<00:06:27.069> well<00:06:28.499> so<00:06:29.499> instead<00:06:30.039> of<00:06:30.099> you<00:06:30.550> know

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:30.930 
hair as well so instead of you know

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:34.259 
hair as well so instead of you know
brushing<00:06:31.930> over<00:06:32.019> a<00:06:32.319> piece<00:06:33.189> of<00:06:33.219> clothing<00:06:33.610> like

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:34.269 
brushing over a piece of clothing like

00:06:34.269 --> 00:06:38.009 
brushing over a piece of clothing like
that<00:06:35.459> hopefully<00:06:36.459> this<00:06:36.999> method<00:06:37.509> works<00:06:37.689> better

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:38.019 
that hopefully this method works better

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:43.259 
that hopefully this method works better
for<00:06:38.319> you<00:06:38.409> and<00:06:39.419> yeah<00:06:41.879> please<00:06:42.879> rate<00:06:43.240> subscribe
