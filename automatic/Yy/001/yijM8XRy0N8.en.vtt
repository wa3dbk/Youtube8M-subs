 the functional organization of the brain 

00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:10.559
 functional units according to luria work 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:13.850
 presented by olga lucia suárez silvia 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.570
 juliana rodríguez karel col 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.060
 nuria and neuropsychology studies the 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.820
 effects that an injury or damage in the 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:24.320
 structures of the central nervous system 

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.869
 can cause on the processes 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.689
 cognitive psychological and emotional 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.970
 of individual behavior within 

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:34.070
 his studies and theories highlights the 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.110
 interpretation of the role of 

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:38.180
 frontal lobes that are considered 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.470
 as the center and emotional home of 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.470
 control of our personality 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:48.130
 according to the mental processes 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.810
 humans are functional systems 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:52.180
 complexes that can not be conceived 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.280
 as processes located in zones 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:57.340
 restricted and limited brain 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.739
 according to Luria the brain is composed 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.330
 by basic functional units the 

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:03.960
 which will be explained in the following 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.960
 work 

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:10.579
 introduction of a lord there are already three 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.619
 Functional units the nervous system 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.420
 regulates its activity through 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:17.659
 coordinated activity of the three 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.520
 functional units these contribute and 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.229
 they play an important role over 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.899
 mental processes and activity 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.450
 conscious in the human being the first 

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:29.479
 unit corresponds to regulate the tone 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:32.359
 and wakefulness and mental states the 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.880
 second unit to receive analyze and 

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:37.789
 store information the third unit 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.150
 to schedule regular and verify the 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:43.450
 activity 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.970
 first unit according to santana 

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:48.280
 Anatomically it is distributed 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.140
 in the brainstem area and in 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.230
 some areas medial is the brain 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.630
 According to Pérez, it is constituted by 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:58.150
 brainstem structures and by the 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.100
 limbic system its functions 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.580
 correspond 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:06.490
 The first one is in charge of providing 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.170
 brain the flow of sufficient energy 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.910
 so that your various systems can 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.209
 carry out your specific work and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:15.310
 general also regulates the tone and 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:17.470
 waking state that allows us 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.290
 reduce the flow of energy when 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.720
 we want to rest or increase the level 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.020
 of energy when we want to make a 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.850
 sports activity is fundamental 

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:30.990
 first unit to perform the 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.360
 organized mental activity 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:35.790
 this unit is organized 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:38.850
 vertically in activity levels 

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:41.190
 Reflex nervous increasingly complex 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:43.980
 as it ascends from the 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.680
 neural segments up the archie and the 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:50.160
 pae for neocortex presenting a 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:52.560
 self-regulated character by those own 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.390
 cortical sectors and by the neocortex 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.390
 of the remaining functional units 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.819
 second unity 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.280
 functions 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:05.430
 Each lobe consists of primary areas 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:07.810
 receptive secondary areas 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.409
 codifiers and tertiary areas that 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:13.540
 do multimodal integration gets 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:15.000
 process and store world information 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.120
 Exterior 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.160
 this means that the second unit 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.100
 functional is responsible for acquiring 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.840
 process and store information 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:27.570
 both the internal environment and the 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.160
 external code encoding the and 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:31.120
 transporting it to the system 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.599
 nervous 

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:37.330
 this implies implies processes of 

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:39.640
 analysis synthesis comparison with 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:41.470
 previous storage information 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.349
 preparation of a response plan 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:46.930
 where they are located is located in the 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:49.409
 back of the cortex behind 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:53.450
 the waist of rolling temporal lobe 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:56.420
 occipital lobe and parietal lobe 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:58.340
 that produce their injuries produce 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.670
 sensory disorders disorders 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.360
 perceptive and cognitive disorders 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.360
 depending on the affected areas 

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:22.120
 third unit 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:24.520
 gloria proposes the third unit 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:27.669
 functional that has its location 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.570
 Anatomy in the frontal lobe performs 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:33.700
 functions like programming regulation and 

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:37.030
 verification of mental activity and 

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.880
 the behavior intentionality and pro 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:42.490
 positivity initiative and control 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:46.120
 intentional control of the most forms 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:50.290
 complex motor analyzer behavior 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:53.139
 according to brotman primary area four areas 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:58.060
 secondary six and eight tertiary areas 

00:04:53.139 --> 00:05:00.840
 9 10 11 44 ​​46 as we can see it in 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.840
 the representation 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:06.100
 in conclusion in all functions 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:10.180
 The three units are involved in 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:11.800
 functional the first and oldest is 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:13.450
 for then in charge of the 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.040
 vital functions that guarantee the 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.920
 integrity of the individual and the 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:20.590
 survival of the regulating species 

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:23.590
 in addition the instinctive instinctive behavior 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:26.110
 sexual and defense food and 

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:30.250
 produce the optimal activation tone of 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:32.350
 the cerebral cortex the second is the 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.060
 responsible for the coding analysis 

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.550
 synthesis and storage of 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.310
 information from the environment and 

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.590
 last being the third one is the one in charge 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.570
 of regular planning and verification of 

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.710
 according to what was planned throughout the 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.710
 conscious activity
