00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
with my own eyes that point I have to

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.990 
with my own eyes that point I have to
decide<00:00:33.840> whether<00:00:33.899> I'm<00:00:34.620> gonna<00:00:34.860> stay<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.460> him<00:00:35.760> I'm

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
decide whether I'm gonna stay on him I'm

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.819 
decide whether I'm gonna stay on him I'm
gonna<00:00:36.239> kind<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.690> transition<00:00:37.290> if<00:00:37.380> he<00:00:37.469> gets<00:00:37.620> into

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
gonna kind of transition if he gets into

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:39.170 
gonna kind of transition if he gets into
the<00:00:37.920> end<00:00:38.070> zone<00:00:38.160> you've<00:00:38.460> got<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> switch<00:00:38.940> to<00:00:39.149> a

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
the end zone you've got to switch to a

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.299 
the end zone you've got to switch to a
different<00:00:39.360> camera<00:00:39.780> with<00:00:40.170> shorter<00:00:40.500> legs<00:00:40.739> and

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
different camera with shorter legs and

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.940 
different camera with shorter legs and
so<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.390> kind<00:00:42.660> of<00:00:42.690> undecided<00:00:43.170> in<00:00:43.500> that<00:00:43.680> moment

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
so I'm kind of undecided in that moment

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.100 
so I'm kind of undecided in that moment
there<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.879> that<00:00:45.090> time<00:00:45.360> he<00:00:45.660> comes<00:00:45.870> up<00:00:46.079> to

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
there about that time he comes up to

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.740 
there about that time he comes up to
defensive<00:00:47.100> back<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> he<00:00:47.969> hurdles<00:00:48.329> him<00:00:48.510> and

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
defensive back and he hurdles him and

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.869 
defensive back and he hurdles him and
you<00:00:49.710> know<00:00:49.800> he's<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.100> hammer<00:00:50.370> down<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879

Mario<00:01:18.750> this<00:01:18.930> Heisman<00:01:19.549> campaign<00:01:20.549> and<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
Mario this Heisman campaign and this

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.300 
Mario this Heisman campaign and this
being<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.750> civil<00:01:22.080> war<00:01:22.290> the<00:01:22.470> final<00:01:22.830> game<00:01:23.040> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
being the civil war the final game and

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.770 
being the civil war the final game and
sort<00:01:23.549> of<00:01:23.580> this<00:01:23.670> is<00:01:23.850> when<00:01:24.000> he's<00:01:24.090> gonna<00:01:24.270> seal<00:01:24.570> it

sort of this is when he's gonna seal it

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.330 
sort of this is when he's gonna seal it
I<00:01:24.869> thought<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.170> had<00:01:25.320> some<00:01:25.530> extra<00:01:25.830> residents

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.120 
I thought it had some extra residents
over<00:01:26.570> usually<00:01:27.570> babies<00:01:28.200> down<00:01:28.409> plays<00:01:28.680> his<00:01:28.890> stuff

went in at halftime when I stuck that

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:41.420

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
of developed a life after that you know

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440 
of developed a life after that you know
I<00:01:43.799> could<00:01:44.009> see<00:01:44.220> even<00:01:44.430> at<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.610> end<00:01:44.729> of<00:01:44.790> halftime

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
I could see even at the end of halftime

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.690 
I could see even at the end of halftime
it<00:01:45.539> was<00:01:45.719> just<00:01:46.020> constantly<00:01:46.979> getting<00:01:47.130> retweets

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
it was just constantly getting retweets

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.149 
it was just constantly getting retweets
and<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.329> before<00:01:49.289> I<00:01:49.320> could<00:01:49.530> even<00:01:49.710> get<00:01:49.890> out<00:01:50.130> of

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
and so before I could even get out of

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.940 
and so before I could even get out of
halftime<00:01:50.729> at<00:01:51.170> SportsCenter<00:01:52.170> asking<00:01:52.799> for
