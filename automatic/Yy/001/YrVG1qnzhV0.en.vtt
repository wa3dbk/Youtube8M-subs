00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 the woman when she is wailing she should 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.660
 modify its power and the segments 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.080
 that can do bad for a baby 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.500
 they ask a lot about caffeine 

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.620
 chocolate 

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.000
 look at what scientifically people 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.340
 there's even a food engineer 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.010
 consecrated persons who have studied 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.720
 about the ones that have a lot even though I know 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:23.970
 until there is a stream of others 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.180
 mister super series who think some 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 food can harm the baby 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 but scientific work does not 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:34.710
 prove what we see in practice 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:39.480
 You can also have a free diet and go 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.370
 visit to meet its peculiarity if 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.960
 Even your mother , every time I 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.870
 sweet potatoes I think they do not accept 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.039
 Colic people then you I do not like to 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.590
 sweet potatoes this does not mean that 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.050
 everyone will stop eating treat not 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.920
 Do you work with the trios? 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.129
 caffeine and chocolate to go through 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:01.020
 milk in a proportion that affects the bb has 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.030
 only a very large amount 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.400
 It seems to me that chocolate would have to be 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.840
 over 800 grams of coffee over 1 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.490
 liter is something like this 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.270
 This is very different from that person. 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.460
 What do you miss for a cup of coffee in the morning? 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:17.189
 or who drinks a mezcal 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.430
 this is another one that won a good one this is 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:23.159
 different is linked to the quantity but 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.229
 was too much caffeine can pass and Dedê 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.810
 this is true for matt sometimes people 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.479
 always going to the cafe is a themed building 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.100
 in the middle léo marcio also has coffee 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:33.509
 so I guess these things should be 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.210
 used in small quantity 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.770
 but so when you ask is the mother 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.250
 who breastfeeds should change their diet 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:44.909
 I'd say yes because she 's almost a 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.180
 neither an athlete nor a caloric expenditure term is 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.340
 so she sleeps little shot one 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.189
 amount of nutrient 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.170
 to make the milk had a 

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:57.570
 amount of very large liquid 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.600
 to breastfeed because water is 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:02.490
 used during this time then so 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.829
 nutritionists who even work harder 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.550
 specifically with this phase exists 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:09.220
 a lot of people who like to meet 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.270
 fact makes a different diet with more 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.210
 calories 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.220
 using sugars better and with content 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.710
 glycemic better position they are 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.870
 released slowly to avoid spikes 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.120
 it is important to program 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.150
 small meals for the dawn if 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.880
 she wakes up spotting is an end but there's more 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.390
 integral things work a destination 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.790
 which usually looks bad, I think a 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.670
 molded feed for that moment 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.430
 can make a lot of difference in vitality 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.640
 This woman has to replace 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.710
 it's not rest anyway 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.460
 time is very similar to a diet of 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:50.530
 somebody who is going to make a 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.950
 a performance that will require more 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.200
 your body then increase calories with 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:58.240
 quality has studied so that this 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.380
 woman has just lived far above the 

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:01.540
 Weight 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:05.200
 I'll have to do it now and help 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:07.240
 lose weight but I need to keep it on 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.490
 work was rich in nutrients in 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:10.600
 sufficient liquid is then 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.780
 like this 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.640
 a balance is she who can receive 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:18.180
 a specific guideline for this is 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:18.180
 very good
