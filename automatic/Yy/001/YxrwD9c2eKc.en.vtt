that this say is similar to the set
before<00:03:47.260> with<00:03:47.950> just<00:03:48.250> a<00:03:48.340> few<00:03:48.370> tweaks<00:03:48.959> yes<00:03:50.130> good

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
before with just a few tweaks yes good

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:52.830 
before with just a few tweaks yes good
because<00:03:51.910> that's<00:03:52.030> basically<00:03:52.180> what<00:03:52.750> you're

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
because that's basically what you're

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.810 
because that's basically what you're
seeing<00:03:53.050> the<00:03:53.650> only<00:03:53.830> real<00:03:54.070> difference<00:03:54.250> here<00:03:54.700> is

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:54.820 
seeing the only real difference here is

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.000 
seeing the only real difference here is
that<00:03:54.850> the<00:03:55.090> first<00:03:55.330> slot<00:03:55.540> replaces<00:03:56.530> bulk<00:03:56.800> up

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.010 
that the first slot replaces bulk up

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.050 
that the first slot replaces bulk up
with<00:03:57.280> earthquake<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.290> that's<00:03:59.290> about<00:03:59.470> it<00:03:59.590> and

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
with earthquake and that's about it and

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.240 
with earthquake and that's about it and
with<00:04:01.060> that<00:04:01.090> another<00:04:01.930> Pokemon<00:04:02.350> bubbas<00:04:02.650> comes

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
with that another Pokemon bubbas comes

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:06.090 
with that another Pokemon bubbas comes
