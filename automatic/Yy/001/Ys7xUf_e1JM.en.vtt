00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.660
 Today's design is this scarf that

 also has hood or hood that has a 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.350
 embedded scarf that you send it is 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.300
 of the laptop 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
 Let's go and sew to do this part. 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.879
 You will need to pin the 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.030
 glass line for sewing chalk for 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:02.969
 scissors cloth tape tailpiece 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.369
 metric scissors for fabric and two 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.590
 fabrics that you can cut according to 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.080
 with the template that you can download in a link 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:13.439
 in the video description after you cut 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.080
 your parts you will get two of a 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.720
 fabric and two others I suggest 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.360
 that you make at least two of the 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.970
 flannel lining of some more fabric 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:26.670
 cuddly blush type to give a warm 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.970
 When you use the part I have a tip. 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.340
 at the time of the strong mirrored cut 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.829
 that is, in a way that I can 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.890
 when I put print with print 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.329
 to sew them are equal to and 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.460
 do not bother 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:43.979
 It's good, the first thing we're going to do. 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.619
 do is prick our hood 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:48.960
 We're going to put a stamp on it. 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.240
 or right with right and let's 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.570
 put pins and sew 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:56.409
 only this part curves here you go 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.929
 do this with the fabric of 

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:00.729
 inside and with fabric outside this seam 

00:01:58.929 --> 00:02:02.909
 here it will be that not one centimeter of 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.469
 such image 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:07.090
 after sewing the curved parts 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:09.099
 Now we need to make a 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.750
 Little trick to make everything alright 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:13.180
 Tidy when we say turn around. 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.640
 ask us to do it everywhere 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.769
 which has curve that small cuts without 

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:19.480
 pick up the stitching line so that it 

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:24.670
 deviates harmoniously 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:27.099
 come on we do not have health curve 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.049
 You need to do the whole piece, you see. 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:31.329
 Do you explain only in the margin of 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:33.459
 seam does not drop here at the seam in 

00:02:31.329 --> 00:02:35.849
 What did you do are thinking to take off? 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.900
 and we're going to have two now 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:44.170
 practically two pieces one the printed one 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.360
 and the other one made of the right flannel 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.010
 so our mission now is to put together a 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.920
 in the other to be sewing well 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:53.470
 You're going to get a seam. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:56.349
 you can use the future here at the top of 

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:58.090
 head you can use the seam of the base 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:00.459
 of the head so much 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.920
 and there you will align with the respective 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:04.000
 I'll show you in detail the other piece. 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:06.400
 on here 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.910
 after aligning this seam with people 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:13.690
 will affect all this right people with 

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:16.299
 you lose time by pinching if you have 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:18.130
 too lazy to ask for help because 

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:21.180
 You're misaligned, you 're just going. 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:21.180
 find out at the end 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:31.270
 when you reach the other side of the 

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:33.940
 Sewing has also you will the same 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.800
 way to seam sewing line right 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.050
 with the right to put a pin well 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:39.730
 in the middle after pinching will give 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.100
 You 'll be more or less a hand. 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:44.050
 opening window marked I all 

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.660
 shopkeepers do not forget 

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:51.100
 so do not forget, I'll even draw a 

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:53.440
 x I will not sew here posture back 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.630
 all with the margin of one centimeter and 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.650
 leave an opening on one side here 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:58.540
 of the legs 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:01.300
 a tip every time you go to sew 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:04.720
 molinhos this type fabrics with the flannel 

00:04:01.300 --> 00:04:06.880

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:08.920
 of the machine then the fabric is placed 

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.690
 It's harder to down and it's more 

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.390
 mole up to give you more firmness 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.190
 stability even if you have 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.890
 experience in sewing and especially 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.410

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.180
 to sew and we're going to sew back 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:22.960
 all over one centimeter 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:25.419
 seam 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.550
