again is so that you're able to see a
demonstration<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:12.270> how<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:12.810> actually

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
demonstration of how it's actually

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.220 
demonstration of how it's actually
be<00:02:13.650> loaded<00:02:14.100> in<00:02:14.310> we<00:02:14.970> have<00:02:15.120> a<00:02:15.230> traditional

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
be loaded in we have a traditional

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.440 
be loaded in we have a traditional
YouTube<00:02:16.710> video<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.100> shows<00:02:17.640> actually<00:02:18.210> how<00:02:18.420> to

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
YouTube video that shows actually how to

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.540 
YouTube video that shows actually how to
load<00:02:19.020> foils<00:02:19.650> so<00:02:19.890> I'm<00:02:20.010> not<00:02:20.190> going<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.400> go

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:20.550 
load foils so I'm not going to go

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:21.860 
load foils so I'm not going to go
through<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.940> take<00:02:21.180> this<00:02:21.300> off<00:02:21.480> and<00:02:21.510> put<00:02:21.780> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
through that take this off and put this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.410 
through that take this off and put this
on<00:02:22.050> now<00:02:22.110> but<00:02:23.100> this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.490> a<00:02:23.520> great<00:02:23.820> way<00:02:24.060> for<00:02:24.330> you

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
on now but this is a great way for you

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.930 
on now but this is a great way for you
to<00:02:24.450> see<00:02:24.720> by<00:02:24.960> demonstration<00:02:25.860> how<00:02:26.130> the<00:02:26.190> foil<00:02:26.640> is

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
to see by demonstration how the foil is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.900 
to see by demonstration how the foil is
supposed<00:02:27.300> to<00:02:27.480> be<00:02:27.600> loaded<00:02:28.190> okay<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.760> would

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
supposed to be loaded okay and you would

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.260 
supposed to be loaded okay and you would
just<00:02:29.940> latch<00:02:30.330> that<00:02:30.660> in<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.730> so<00:02:32.850> that's<00:02:33.060> all

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
just latch that in and so that's all

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.210 
just latch that in and so that's all
that<00:02:33.300> now<00:02:33.900> let's<00:02:34.140> go<00:02:34.290> back<00:02:34.500> in<00:02:34.680> here<00:02:34.950> in<00:02:35.010> this

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
that now let's go back in here in this

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.790 
that now let's go back in here in this
box<00:02:35.520> and<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.780> other<00:02:36.959> thing<00:02:37.260> that<00:02:37.290> will<00:02:37.590> come
