00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.930
 well is that one like this in its 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:10.420
 inclusion stream a few tricks 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:12.459
 this one they found me reissued and good 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.650
 this is me I did not discover it and good 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:17.170
 It's not a big deal, but they study from me 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.670
 part and this one of here that is only we see 

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.009
 this week will contain edit the ones that 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:23.109
 It seemed very good so good before 

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.179
 start I want to tell you to go see 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.849
 the video to see how this came about 

00:00:25.179 --> 00:00:29.439
 here trip see how this came here 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.699
 so you can see how this came here 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.070
 leave a note so they can go to 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:35.280
 see it is super epic but good we go 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.420
 to see with the tricks these first 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.160
 I recommend you go see if videos 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.750
 I tell them an annotation so that I could 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.160
 see it let's start with these 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.010
 tricks is had done something short 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.150
 but this one I think these tricks are 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.730
 not enough help 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.010
 the first thing is this that is a barrier not 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.230
 that for example imagine that it is for 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.720
 example a a house not inside of 

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.520
 a house that I know 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.220
 for example here is a wall of x not 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:03.760
 but over here I think it's from gm we're 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.710
 there is a secret chest see this see this 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.140
 is that it is ok the peak can hide 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.880
 whatever servers are on some south map 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:15.149
 value they have can hide their this 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.640
 well your lot not your secret chests and you 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.740
 take off that from here is not camera 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.979
 bastard as good as you see here as 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.929
 has a point not here where we are 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.539
 it's like he has a point not young 

00:01:24.929 --> 00:01:29.130
 here and to show you how to do this 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.280
 I'm going to show you is pretty 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.490
 simple first is to do what is this 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.159
 it's a simple barrier like this and on this side 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.840
 go putting this what are the 

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:43.179
 what are the stairs called not the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.710
 stairs we put here for example 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:47.069
 here is going to be the example box 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:50.200
 they take a chest here we are here 

00:01:47.069 --> 00:01:52.090
 here is enough the chest and we have to do 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.609
 that here back not that here back 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.750
 you know they are pointing towards 

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:57.909
 here I have to make here back 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:01.420
 how do we make it back so very 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:04.090
 easy we have to put these and know 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:05.979
 let me see this like this and this way there 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.739
 we have to put it on this side 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.599
 not like pointing towards us 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:13.120
 well as this little turn and it 

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.090
 produces this little book that I tell you 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.250
 this we will continue and we are and remains 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.810
 well the wall and just this click 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.730
 right until you find the point 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.470
 we are and we can keep all the 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.140
 things that we want and I tell them will be 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:27.549
 well well sheltered everything is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.890
 great is that I find it very good 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:32.140
 this idea the next idea let me 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:35.990
 put this at night again the 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.030
 next trick better said is this 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.730
 this put a zombie already know that many 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.180
 Sometimes it hurts a lot when a zombie 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.250
 is chingue and chingue the door and you the 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.440
 it ends up breaking and the ones I tell you 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.960
 Fuck a lot then this is a small 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.890
 trick let me put this game 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.890
 survival 

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.890
 what there is no sound 

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:08.140
 and now that it is good the case that this 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:10.150
 good trick is already killing me this 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:12.430
 fuck the case of this little trick 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.380
 makes the zombie not break the door 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.640
 as you can see you are jumping he was 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.440
 they are not able to listen to the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.320
 Sound like you think it is that we are not 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.150
 listen to the sound for some reason this 

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:23.950
 but I tell them it 's knocking on the door 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.440
 right now but do not break it because 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:29.380
 because it is jumping and it resets what 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:31.060
 it's time to break the door and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.190
 they know when they last a certain time 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.380
 the zombie breaks the door but not 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.730
 every time you jump this resets what 

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:39.010
 which is the knock on the door then 

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:41.620
 that's where the turkey is not that 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.300
 I do not know anymore and now the 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:45.130
 door and you no longer have to worry about 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:47.650
 that is going to break the door you have 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:50.560
 to go back to another fucking door and 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.540
 you know is a little trick quite this 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:55.000
 useful the truth stop killing is zombie 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.400
 there, let 's say it 's good because we're 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.920
 putting so much you see that 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:01.900
 well I'm going to stay here this 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.519
 this video was quite short but they 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.500
 I say apparently liked the topic of 

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.400
 tricks then I brought them few others 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:08.620
 plus 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.290

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:13.840
 see if any other part anymore and if I do 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:14.950
