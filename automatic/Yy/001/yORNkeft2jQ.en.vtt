00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
from what I'm hearing they're going to

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
from what I'm hearing they're going to
do<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.010> the<00:01:41.070> old<00:01:41.220> too<00:01:41.490> and<00:01:41.909> that<00:01:42.480> really

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
do it the old too and that really

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.600 
do it the old too and that really
surprised<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> economy<00:01:43.860> because<00:01:44.070> I<00:01:44.220> didn't

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
surprised the economy because I didn't

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.720 
surprised the economy because I didn't
ever<00:01:44.760> remember<00:01:45.150> him<00:01:45.330> getting<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.460> black<00:01:47.460> box

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
ever remember him getting the black box

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:50.240 
ever remember him getting the black box
Morpher<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.740> show<00:01:49.920> and<00:01:50.130> they're

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
Morpher in the show and they're

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.610 
Morpher in the show and they're
shinkenger<00:01:50.940> so<00:01:51.180> maybe<00:01:51.870> i'm<00:01:52.020> wrong<00:01:52.050> but<00:01:52.290> i

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:52.620 
shinkenger so maybe i'm wrong but i

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.770 
shinkenger so maybe i'm wrong but i
thought<00:01:52.800> he<00:01:53.070> didn't<00:01:53.340> never<00:01:53.520> give<00:01:53.730> it<00:01:53.880> so<00:01:54.180> that

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
thought he didn't never give it so that

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.820 
thought he didn't never give it so that
might<00:01:54.930> be<00:01:54.960> something<00:01:55.080> they're<00:01:55.500> just<00:01:55.680> going<00:01:55.770> to

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
might be something they're just going to

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.200 
might be something they're just going to
do<00:01:55.950> just<00:01:56.220> for<00:01:56.340> the<00:01:56.460> american<00:01:56.790> version<00:01:56.820> i

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
do just for the american version i

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.550 
do just for the american version i
thought<00:01:57.390> that's<00:01:57.510> cool<00:01:57.840> how<00:01:58.140> they<00:01:58.260> did<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
