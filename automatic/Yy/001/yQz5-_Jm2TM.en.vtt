we<00:00:11.460> wanted<00:00:11.700> to<00:00:11.759> create<00:00:11.910> an<00:00:12.120> engine<00:00:12.450> that<00:00:12.660> was

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
we wanted to create an engine that was

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.530 
we wanted to create an engine that was
capable<00:00:13.410> of<00:00:13.679> creating<00:00:14.490> truly<00:00:15.210> next

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
capable of creating truly next

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.019 
capable of creating truly next
generation<00:00:15.990> of<00:00:16.049> Triple<00:00:16.410> A<00:00:16.500> games<00:00:16.760> but<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:17.880> also

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
generation of Triple A games but we also

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:20.210 
generation of Triple A games but we also
saw<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.510> as<00:00:18.720> game<00:00:18.930> for<00:00:19.109> getting<00:00:19.350> bigger<00:00:19.529> so

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
saw that as game for getting bigger so

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.160 
saw that as game for getting bigger so
where<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> project<00:00:20.939> worked<00:00:21.150> on<00:00:21.330> them<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.630> we

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
where the project worked on them and we

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.769 
where the project worked on them and we
wanted<00:00:22.470> to<00:00:22.529> go<00:00:22.740> better<00:00:23.160> not<00:00:23.699> bigger<00:00:23.939> and<00:00:24.660> we

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
wanted to go better not bigger and we

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.810 
wanted to go better not bigger and we
all<00:00:24.900> wanted<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.320> be<00:00:25.529> smart<00:00:26.070> and<00:00:26.279> not<00:00:26.460> rely<00:00:26.789> on

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
all wanted to be smart and not rely on

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:40.689 
all wanted to be smart and not rely on
brute<00:00:27.060> force

00:00:40.689 --> 00:00:40.699 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:43.490 

the<00:00:41.699> engine<00:00:42.030> should<00:00:42.180> also<00:00:42.420> support<00:00:43.050> how<00:00:43.440> we

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
the engine should also support how we

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
the engine should also support how we
work<00:00:43.800> in<00:00:43.980> studio<00:00:44.399> which<00:00:44.789> is<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:44.969> lot<00:00:45.180> of<00:00:45.210> quick

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
work in studio which is a lot of quick

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.869 
work in studio which is a lot of quick

iterations of features I have a lot of

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:49.939 
iterations of features I have a lot of
creativity<00:00:48.359> and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.170> freedom<00:00:49.530> to<00:00:49.680> experiment

the core of the snowdrop engine is a

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:57.030 
the core of the snowdrop engine is a
node-based<00:00:55.690> scripting<00:00:56.470> system<00:00:56.770> this<00:00:56.950> is

node-based scripting system this is

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:58.710 
node-based scripting system this is
really<00:00:57.250> the<00:00:57.460> beating<00:00:57.880> heart<00:00:58.150> of<00:00:58.330> the<00:00:58.420> engine

really the beating heart of the engine

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.990 
really the beating heart of the engine
that<00:00:58.810> allows<00:00:58.930> us<00:00:59.080> to<00:00:59.380> do<00:00:59.530> what<00:00:59.920> we<00:00:59.980> do<00:01:00.340> it

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
that allows us to do what we do it

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.230 
that allows us to do what we do it
affects<00:01:01.480> all<00:01:01.660> systems<00:01:02.560> of<00:01:02.830> the<00:01:03.280> engine<00:01:03.880> from

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
so easy to use and to set up that you

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:22.920 
so easy to use and to set up that you
really<00:01:20.290> have<00:01:20.320> freedom<00:01:20.950> and<00:01:21.220> time<00:01:21.940> to<00:01:22.330> explore

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 
really have freedom and time to explore

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.330 
really have freedom and time to explore

different options
the<00:01:25.880> editor<00:01:26.210> is<00:01:26.359> basically<00:01:26.990> just<00:01:27.350> a<00:01:27.890> set<00:01:28.130> of

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
the editor is basically just a set of

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.370 
the editor is basically just a set of
different<00:01:29.090> windows<00:01:29.390> that<00:01:29.899> you<00:01:30.020> can<00:01:30.200> move

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
different windows that you can move

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.380 
different windows that you can move
around<00:01:30.500> whatever<00:01:30.979> you<00:01:31.219> want<00:01:31.460> and<00:01:31.789> if<00:01:32.030> you<00:01:32.240> work

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:32.390 
around whatever you want and if you work

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:34.719 
around whatever you want and if you work
in<00:01:32.659> a<00:01:32.869> specific<00:01:33.289> way<00:01:33.530> you<00:01:33.710> can<00:01:34.009> adjust<00:01:34.490> the

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:34.729 
in a specific way you can adjust the

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:38.859 
in a specific way you can adjust the
editor<00:01:35.539> to<00:01:35.810> fit<00:01:36.409> your<00:01:36.560> needs<00:01:37.750> working<00:01:38.750> with

editor to fit your needs working with

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.260 
editor to fit your needs working with
the<00:01:38.990> engine<00:01:39.289> is<00:01:39.590> kind<00:01:40.219> of<00:01:40.340> like<00:01:40.460> solving<00:01:41.060> a

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
the engine is kind of like solving a

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.179 
the engine is kind of like solving a
puzzle<00:01:41.420> because<00:01:42.409> the<00:01:42.500> components<00:01:43.039> are

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:43.189 
puzzle because the components are

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.669 
puzzle because the components are
usually<00:01:43.909> already<00:01:44.360> there<00:01:44.630> it's<00:01:44.959> just<00:01:45.289> a<00:01:45.500> matter

00:01:45.669 --> 00:01:45.679 
usually already there it's just a matter

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:49.090 
usually already there it's just a matter
of<00:01:45.829> how<00:01:45.920> you<00:01:46.159> combine<00:01:46.729> them<00:01:46.850> together<00:01:47.859> you<00:01:48.859> can

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
of how you combine them together you can

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.099 
of how you combine them together you can
do<00:01:49.219> whatever<00:01:49.670> you<00:01:49.880> want<00:01:50.060> it's<00:01:50.270> basically<00:01:50.899> it's

00:01:51.099 --> 00:01:51.109 
do whatever you want it's basically it's

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:53.260 
do whatever you want it's basically it's
like<00:01:51.200> Lego<00:01:51.799> because<00:01:52.459> it's<00:01:52.640> just<00:01:52.729> different

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
like Lego because it's just different

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.840 
like Lego because it's just different
building<00:01:53.689> blocks<00:01:53.719> and<00:01:54.140> you<00:01:54.170> can<00:01:54.439> test<00:01:55.340> does

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:55.850 
building blocks and you can test does

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.600 
building blocks and you can test does
this<00:01:55.880> fit<00:01:56.209> here<00:01:56.479> moreless<00:01:57.380> can<00:01:58.220> make<00:01:58.399> some

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
this fit here moreless can make some

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520 
this fit here moreless can make some
really<00:01:58.729> cool<00:01:58.970> results<00:01:59.390> just<00:01:59.599> by<00:01:59.750> very<00:02:00.049> simple

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
really cool results just by very simple

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.789 
really cool results just by very simple
components<00:02:01.340> I<00:02:01.899> really<00:02:02.899> enjoyed<00:02:02.989> to<00:02:03.500> work<00:02:03.619> with

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:03.799 
components I really enjoyed to work with

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.350 
components I really enjoyed to work with
it<00:02:05.530> at<00:02:06.530> massive<00:02:07.069> i<00:02:07.340> would<00:02:07.880> call<00:02:08.030> our<00:02:08.179> work

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
it at massive i would call our work

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.170 
it at massive i would call our work
