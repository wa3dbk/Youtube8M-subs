in<00:00:16.240> this<00:00:17.240> lesson<00:00:17.510> we<00:00:17.810> will<00:00:17.840> cover<00:00:18.170> the

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:18.350 
in this lesson we will cover the

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:19.840 
in this lesson we will cover the
different<00:00:18.710> options<00:00:19.100> you<00:00:19.160> have<00:00:19.250> when<00:00:19.400> working

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:19.850 
different options you have when working

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.060 
different options you have when working
with<00:00:20.000> multiple<00:00:20.330> objects<00:00:21.050> in<00:00:21.260> the<00:00:21.830> end<00:00:21.950> of

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:22.070 
with multiple objects in the end of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.350 
with multiple objects in the end of
their<00:00:22.160> there<00:00:22.340> are<00:00:22.369> two<00:00:22.610> ways<00:00:22.790> you<00:00:22.850> can<00:00:23.030> combine

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360 
their there are two ways you can combine

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:26.320 
their there are two ways you can combine
objects<00:00:24.110> gluing<00:00:24.800> and<00:00:25.010> grouping<00:00:25.550> first<00:00:26.060> let's

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
objects gluing and grouping first let's

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.480 
objects gluing and grouping first let's
look<00:00:26.510> at<00:00:26.660> gluing<00:00:27.050> you<00:00:27.650> can<00:00:27.830> see<00:00:28.070> here<00:00:28.310> I've

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
look at gluing you can see here I've

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.310 
look at gluing you can see here I've
placed<00:00:28.849> a<00:00:29.000> few<00:00:29.240> objects<00:00:29.720> that<00:00:29.840> I'd<00:00:30.020> like<00:00:30.140> to

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 
placed a few objects that I'd like to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.470 
placed a few objects that I'd like to
glue<00:00:30.529> together<00:00:30.710> there<00:00:31.430> are<00:00:31.580> two<00:00:31.790> ways<00:00:32.000> to<00:00:32.060> glue

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:32.480 
glue together there are two ways to glue

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.420 
glue together there are two ways to glue
objects<00:00:32.900> in<00:00:33.050> the<00:00:33.110> editor<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:33.890> first<00:00:34.160> way<00:00:34.400> is

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:34.430 
objects in the editor the first way is

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:36.160 
objects in the editor the first way is
to<00:00:34.760> select<00:00:34.940> all<00:00:35.239> the<00:00:35.420> objects<00:00:35.810> you<00:00:35.900> want<00:00:35.930> to

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
to select all the objects you want to

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.110

will highlight the whole group you still

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.990 
will highlight the whole group you still
need<00:01:29.930> to<00:01:29.960> press<00:01:30.230> a<00:01:30.470> to<00:01:30.500> grab<00:01:30.950> everything<00:01:31.130> but

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:32.000 
need to press a to grab everything but

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.550 
need to press a to grab everything but
this<00:01:32.120> is<00:01:32.330> a<00:01:32.360> great<00:01:32.660> way<00:01:32.840> for<00:01:32.900> selecting

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
this is a great way for selecting

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.770 
this is a great way for selecting
multiple<00:01:33.770> glued<00:01:34.370> or<00:01:34.700> grouped<00:01:35.030> objects<00:01:35.540> sets

at once now before we get into the

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:39.730 
at once now before we get into the
properties<00:01:38.330> of<00:01:38.480> a<00:01:38.540> glued<00:01:38.780> group<00:01:39.140> let's

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
properties of a glued group let's

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.530 
properties of a glued group let's
quickly<00:01:40.040> look<00:01:40.220> at<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.640> other<00:01:40.820> method<00:01:41.120> you<00:01:41.390> can

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
quickly look at the other method you can

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:43.840 
quickly look at the other method you can
use<00:01:41.720> to<00:01:41.960> glue<00:01:42.170> objects<00:01:42.710> if<00:01:42.860> you<00:01:43.340> open<00:01:43.490> the<00:01:43.700> new

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
example we have a bunch of physics

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.580 
example we have a bunch of physics
properties<00:04:14.269> which<00:04:14.569> we've<00:04:14.750> already<00:04:14.959> discussed

next<00:04:16.549> we<00:04:16.669> have<00:04:16.760> the<00:04:16.820> option<00:04:17.060> to<00:04:17.299> turn<00:04:17.600> our

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
next we have the option to turn our

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:20.379 
next we have the option to turn our
group<00:04:18.049> set<00:04:18.350> into<00:04:18.680> a<00:04:18.709> glued<00:04:19.039> set<00:04:19.340> and<00:04:19.549> we<00:04:20.060> can<00:04:20.269> of

00:04:20.379 --> 00:04:20.389 
group set into a glued set and we can of

00:04:20.389 --> 00:04:23.620 
group set into a glued set and we can of
course<00:04:20.419> also<00:04:20.840> ungroup<00:04:21.620> the<00:04:21.799> objects<00:04:22.630> removed

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
course also ungroup the objects removed

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:25.420 
course also ungroup the objects removed
from<00:04:23.840> group<00:04:24.080> comes<00:04:24.350> in<00:04:24.530> handy<00:04:24.710> if<00:04:24.979> you<00:04:25.100> want<00:04:25.310> to

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
from group comes in handy if you want to

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.700 
from group comes in handy if you want to
take<00:04:25.580> an<00:04:25.729> object<00:04:25.880> out<00:04:26.330> of<00:04:26.479> the<00:04:26.570> group<00:04:26.780> for<00:04:27.620> this

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
take an object out of the group for this

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:29.469 
take an object out of the group for this
you<00:04:27.919> will<00:04:27.950> need<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.310> use<00:04:28.430> lb<00:04:28.880> to<00:04:29.090> select<00:04:29.389> just

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:29.479 
you will need to use lb to select just

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:31.070 
you will need to use lb to select just
the<00:04:29.870> object<00:04:30.349> you<00:04:30.470> want<00:04:30.590> to<00:04:30.740> remove

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:31.080 
the object you want to remove

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:33.350 
the object you want to remove
open<00:04:31.830> up<00:04:31.949> the<00:04:32.069> properties<00:04:32.520> and<00:04:32.759> hit<00:04:33.000> remove

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
open up the properties and hit remove

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.360 
open up the properties and hit remove
from<00:04:33.599> group<00:04:33.900> now<00:04:34.470> that<00:04:34.710> item<00:04:35.039> is<00:04:35.159> no<00:04:35.340> longer

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370

part<00:04:35.909> of<00:04:36.000> the<00:04:36.120> group<00:04:36.330> and<00:04:36.770> finally<00:04:37.770> we<00:04:38.039> will

00:04:38.149 --> 00:04:38.159 
part of the group and finally we will

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:39.800 
part of the group and finally we will
move<00:04:38.310> on<00:04:38.520> the<00:04:38.699> saving<00:04:39.090> objects<00:04:39.509> to<00:04:39.689> the

move on the saving objects to the

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:42.200 
move on the saving objects to the
favorites<00:04:40.199> the<00:04:40.800> basic<00:04:41.159> idea<00:04:41.490> of<00:04:41.550> favorites<00:04:42.030> is

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
favorites the basic idea of favorites is

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.119 
favorites the basic idea of favorites is
that<00:04:42.539> you<00:04:42.629> can<00:04:42.810> save<00:04:43.050> objects<00:04:43.530> you<00:04:43.650> create<00:04:43.979> in

00:04:44.119 --> 00:04:44.129 
that you can save objects you create in

00:04:44.129 --> 00:04:46.939 
that you can save objects you create in
one<00:04:44.310> track<00:04:44.610> to<00:04:44.819> use<00:04:45.090> in<00:04:45.270> other<00:04:45.419> tracks<00:04:45.780> so<00:04:46.710> for

00:04:46.939 --> 00:04:46.949 
one track to use in other tracks so for

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:48.770 
one track to use in other tracks so for
example<00:04:47.039> I<00:04:47.520> just<00:04:47.550> made<00:04:48.030> this<00:04:48.210> square<00:04:48.539> on<00:04:48.750> the

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:48.780 
example I just made this square on the

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.570 
example I just made this square on the
wooden<00:04:49.050> beams<00:04:49.349> and<00:04:49.650> it's<00:04:50.069> such<00:04:50.280> an<00:04:50.430> awesome

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
wooden beams and it's such an awesome

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.279 
wooden beams and it's such an awesome
square<00:04:51.150> that<00:04:51.330> I<00:04:51.360> want<00:04:51.629> to<00:04:51.659> use<00:04:51.719> it<00:04:52.020> in<00:04:52.110> other

00:04:52.279 --> 00:04:52.289 
square that I want to use it in other

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:54.950 
square that I want to use it in other
maps<00:04:52.620> with<00:04:53.430> favorites<00:04:53.909> I<00:04:54.120> can<00:04:54.360> do<00:04:54.509> that<00:04:54.689> any

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:54.960 
maps with favorites I can do that any

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.230 
maps with favorites I can do that any
object<00:04:55.439> can<00:04:56.039> be<00:04:56.069> saved<00:04:56.400> to<00:04:56.550> favorites<00:04:56.789> but

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
object can be saved to favorites but

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:58.730 
object can be saved to favorites but
generally<00:04:57.750> you're<00:04:57.900> going<00:04:58.110> to<00:04:58.169> want<00:04:58.289> to<00:04:58.439> use<00:04:58.560> it

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
generally you're going to want to use it

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.070 
generally you're going to want to use it
to<00:04:58.770> save<00:04:59.069> combinations<00:04:59.849> of<00:04:59.939> objects<00:05:00.479> the
