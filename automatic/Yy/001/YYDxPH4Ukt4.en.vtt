00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.750 
and I found this one for $30 so it had
the<00:01:08.880> bottom<00:01:09.470> wire<00:01:10.470> cut<00:01:10.830> out<00:01:11.010> so<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.280> had<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> buy

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.539 
the bottom wire cut out so I had to buy
some<00:01:12.060> wire<00:01:12.299> and<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:13.740> isn't<00:01:13.979> the<00:01:14.280> regular

some wire and this isn't the regular

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
some wire and this isn't the regular
wire<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.240> isn't<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.659> the<00:01:15.689> hardware<00:01:16.200> cloth

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500
