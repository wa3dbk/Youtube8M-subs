32-ounce colossal club as opposed to the
24<00:00:24.689> hour<00:00:24.840> classic<00:00:25.410> up<00:00:25.619> because<00:00:26.550> i<00:00:26.580> think

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
24 hour classic up because i think

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:29.870 
24 hour classic up because i think
because<00:00:28.109> of<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.519> ingredients<00:00:29.519> that<00:00:29.550> this

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
because of the ingredients that this

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.790 
because of the ingredients that this
will<00:00:30.060> not<00:00:30.179> be<00:00:30.210> big<00:00:30.539> enough<00:00:30.570> so<00:00:31.289> if<00:00:31.439> you<00:00:31.590> don't

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
will not be big enough so if you don't

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.209 
will not be big enough so if you don't
have<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.369> 900<00:00:33.180> um<00:00:34.010> the<00:00:35.010> pro<00:00:35.219> 900<00:00:36.410> just<00:00:37.410> cut

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
everything in half so for example if
