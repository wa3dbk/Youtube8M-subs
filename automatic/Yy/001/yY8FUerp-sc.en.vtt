the wall with this classical background
let's<00:03:02.659> integrate<00:03:03.170> them<00:03:03.560> together<00:03:03.890> hopefully

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:04.129 
let's integrate them together hopefully

00:03:04.129 --> 00:03:06.910 
let's integrate them together hopefully
into<00:03:04.670> you<00:03:05.659> know<00:03:05.750> the<00:03:06.019> ideal<00:03:06.260> is<00:03:06.409> Bartok<00:03:06.739> where

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
into you know the ideal is Bartok where

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.140

something in between matt is so rooted

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.850 
something in between matt is so rooted
in<00:03:34.180> string<00:03:34.720> band<00:03:34.959> music<00:03:35.260> like<00:03:35.470> he<00:03:35.560> grew<00:03:35.830> up

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860

playing banjo and mandolin and took that

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:42.720 
playing banjo and mandolin and took that
and<00:03:40.380> extrapolated<00:03:41.380> that<00:03:41.410> over<00:03:41.860> it's<00:03:42.130> over<00:03:42.310> 20

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:42.730 
and extrapolated that over it's over 20

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:44.130 
and extrapolated that over it's over 20
minutes<00:03:42.880> of<00:03:43.120> music<00:03:43.239> hopefully<00:03:43.870> this<00:03:43.989> will<00:03:44.080> be

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:44.140 
minutes of music hopefully this will be

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.860 
minutes of music hopefully this will be
