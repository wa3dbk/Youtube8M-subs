00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.290
 Those people 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.469
 Today I'm going to teach you how to fix the 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:19.560
 compact or broken today in this 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:21.660
 process with this poc and with that blush and 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.359
 It was super good but I'm not one either. 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.189
 very careful person has left 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.109
 Compact that fell Compact I'll fix it 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.510
 Soon to you and I will tell you 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.200
 learn too, it's good, so let's go 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.000
 People I'm going to put my co here. 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.629
 inside this will need to break 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.290
 even more with the help of a spoon 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.290
 Oh my God. 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.420
 hence if you want and if the package goes 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:03.880
 coconut you can mix with one with the 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:08.050
 your focus on my case is the 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:12.190
 porcelain were walking and in this process here 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:18.130
 Oh I mixed the anasha plus one 

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:21.100
 Beige light with this blush I 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:22.660
 I mixed it with a bronze color with rose 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.350
 burned and I got this 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:25.350
 result here 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:34.000
 So it's got network break the compact 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:36.790
 you in the container so that he 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.280
 stay albee broken for 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.729
 to facilitate is the time you go 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:47.080
 mix with something good 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.229
 here is the tall one 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:54.070
 Then you'll do the studying yourself. 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:56.729
 he until he stays in let's say that 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.729
 it was slow 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.690
 I tried to stay like this not 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:19.650
 then with the spoon and the aid of your 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:24.000
 time will also deposit back to the 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:27.950
 expedient is good at anything by the time 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.900
 was to put the album in order not to be too long. 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.060
 very spare cup because otherwise it will end 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.060
 Spoiling him, it's the people. 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.970
 ready the impression that you will have 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.760
 the first time you have to get the safe 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.069
 with a little darker but it goes 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.810
 back with normal it is only in this color 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.420
 because it is wet 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.640
 now with the second role we're going 

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.640
 surrounding by making light pressure 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:11.959
 so people here was the end result 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.140
