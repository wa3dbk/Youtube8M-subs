okay<00:00:05.960> now<00:00:06.109> always<00:00:06.380> remember<00:00:06.470> to<00:00:06.979> turn<00:00:07.189> that<00:00:07.430> RS

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:08.090 
okay now always remember to turn that RS

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.600 
okay now always remember to turn that RS
CA<00:00:08.840> off<00:00:09.350> or<00:00:09.860> else<00:00:09.980> you<00:00:10.129> can<00:00:10.280> end<00:00:10.430> up<00:00:10.549> with

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:10.610 
CA off or else you can end up with

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.390 
CA off or else you can end up with
airbags<00:00:11.299> going<00:00:11.780> off<00:00:11.930> not<00:00:12.320> only<00:00:12.559> expensive<00:00:12.920> but

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:13.400 
airbags going off not only expensive but

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:14.860 
airbags going off not only expensive but
it<00:00:13.580> gets<00:00:13.700> in<00:00:13.849> the<00:00:13.940> way<00:00:14.090> okay<00:00:14.389> and<00:00:14.420> I'm<00:00:14.660> going<00:00:14.809> to

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:14.870 
it gets in the way okay and I'm going to

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.679 
it gets in the way okay and I'm going to
show<00:00:15.049> you<00:00:15.110> the<00:00:15.290> over<00:00:15.559> boosted<00:00:16.040> problem<00:00:16.490> so<00:00:17.119> I'm

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:17.689 
show you the over boosted problem so I'm

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:22.640 
show you the over boosted problem so I'm
at<00:00:17.930> what<00:00:18.320> nine<00:00:18.890> miles<00:00:19.189> an<00:00:19.400> hour<00:00:20.439> look<00:00:21.439> at<00:00:21.560> this

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
at what nine miles an hour look at this

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.230 
at what nine miles an hour look at this
and<00:00:22.980> turn<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:23.430> entire<00:00:23.670> car<00:00:24.120> with<00:00:24.810> one<00:00:25.170> digit

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:26.240 
and turn the entire car with one digit

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.180 
and turn the entire car with one digit
okay<00:00:27.240> those<00:00:27.810> of<00:00:27.840> you<00:00:28.230> old<00:00:28.380> enough<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.830> remember

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:29.190 
okay those of you old enough to remember

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:32.930 
okay those of you old enough to remember
that<00:00:30.650> we<00:00:31.650> had<00:00:31.800> vehicles<00:00:32.309> without<00:00:32.550> power

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
that we had vehicles without power

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.940 
that we had vehicles without power
steering<00:00:33.090> we<00:00:33.840> know<00:00:34.080> it<00:00:34.290> gets<00:00:34.470> easier<00:00:34.830> at

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
steering we know it gets easier at

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.010 
steering we know it gets easier at
higher<00:00:35.160> speed<00:00:35.610> that's<00:00:36.180> why<00:00:36.330> I<00:00:36.360> showed<00:00:36.660> it<00:00:36.900> to

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
higher speed that's why I showed it to

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.320 
higher speed that's why I showed it to
you<00:00:37.140> basically<00:00:37.800> stop<00:00:38.309> that<00:00:38.640> we<00:00:38.760> can<00:00:38.940> do<00:00:39.090> this

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:39.330 
you basically stop that we can do this

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.840 
you basically stop that we can do this
driving<00:00:39.629> one<00:00:40.050> finger<00:00:40.530> okay<00:00:41.370> now<00:00:41.580> we're<00:00:41.760> going

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
driving one finger okay now we're going

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.210 
driving one finger okay now we're going
to<00:00:41.940> talk<00:00:42.239> about<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.900> difference<00:00:43.379> between<00:00:43.500> a

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:44.220 
to talk about the difference between a

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:55.580 
to talk about the difference between a
track<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:46.940> the<00:00:48.770> mode<00:00:49.770> dial<00:00:52.309> so<00:00:53.989> basically<00:00:54.989> now

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
track and the mode dial so basically now

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.420 
track and the mode dial so basically now
I'm<00:00:55.739> in<00:00:55.860> for<00:00:56.850> low<00:00:57.059> okay<00:00:57.950> so<00:00:58.950> there's<00:00:59.309> a<00:00:59.370> couple

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
I'm in for low okay so there's a couple

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.150 
I'm in for low okay so there's a couple
different<00:00:59.760> techniques<00:01:00.390> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.170> hit<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.710> track

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
different techniques if you hit a track

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.090 
different techniques if you hit a track
okay<00:01:03.229> so<00:01:04.229> now<00:01:04.380> a<00:01:04.680> track<00:01:05.009> comes<00:01:05.250> on<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.899> and

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
okay so now a track comes on there and

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.430 
okay so now a track comes on there and
it<00:01:08.100> says<00:01:08.340> we're<00:01:08.550> in<00:01:08.640> for<00:01:08.910> low<00:01:09.119> so<00:01:09.990> then<00:01:10.200> we're

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:10.440 
it says we're in for low so then we're

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.639 
it says we're in for low so then we're
gonna<00:01:10.530> try<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.860> negotiate<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.940> little<00:01:12.300> bit<00:01:12.649> this

00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:13.649 
gonna try to negotiate a little bit this

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:16.520 
gonna try to negotiate a little bit this
road<00:01:14.039> here<00:01:14.399> what<00:01:14.610> a<00:01:14.640> track<00:01:15.090> does<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:16.140> basically

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
road here what a track does is basically

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.889 
road here what a track does is basically
gives<00:01:17.460> every<00:01:18.030> tire<00:01:18.590> traction<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:20.330> all<00:01:21.330> four

00:01:21.889 --> 00:01:21.899 
gives every tire traction so all four

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:25.490 
gives every tire traction so all four
tires<00:01:22.259> can<00:01:22.740> technically<00:01:23.190> spin<00:01:23.670> so<00:01:24.509> if<00:01:25.200> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
tires can technically spin so if you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.740 
tires can technically spin so if you
hear<00:01:25.770> it<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.100> feel<00:01:26.130> it<00:01:26.399> we're<00:01:26.759> slowly<00:01:27.209> making

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:27.750 
hear it you feel it we're slowly making

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:35.359 
hear it you feel it we're slowly making
it<00:01:28.080> up<00:01:28.229> okay<00:01:29.100> now<00:01:29.420> let's<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.600> back<00:01:30.899> and<00:01:34.369> then

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
it up okay now let's go back and then

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.669 
it up okay now let's go back and then
we're<00:01:35.520> going<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.700> do<00:01:35.789> this<00:01:35.880> again<00:01:36.240> in<00:01:37.849> the

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:39.679 
we're going to do this again in the

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.460 
we're going to do this again in the
terrain<00:01:40.679> selector<00:01:41.509> okay<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.569> you'll<00:01:42.899> see<00:01:43.170> that

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
terrain selector okay so you'll see that

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.210 
terrain selector okay so you'll see that
the<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> track<00:01:44.160> turns<00:01:44.880> itself<00:01:45.149> off<00:01:45.740> let's<00:01:46.740> start

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
the a track turns itself off let's start

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.380 
the a track turns itself off let's start
with<00:01:48.050> light<00:01:49.050> okay<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.069> what<00:01:50.700> that's<00:01:50.819> consider

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
with light okay so what that's consider

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.210 
with light okay so what that's consider
is<00:01:51.569> mud<00:01:51.869> sand<00:01:52.229> and<00:01:52.440> dirt<00:01:52.619> as<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:53.009> know<00:01:53.160> you

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
is mud sand and dirt as you know you

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.150 
is mud sand and dirt as you know you
could<00:01:53.429> do<00:01:53.550> it<00:01:53.640> in<00:01:53.729> four<00:01:54.000> high<00:01:54.179> as<00:01:54.360> well<00:01:54.599> so<00:01:55.470> put

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
could do it in four high as well so put

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.330 
could do it in four high as well so put
it<00:01:56.250> back<00:01:56.459> in<00:01:56.640> gear<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.470> try<00:01:58.470> to<00:01:58.530> negotiate<00:01:58.800> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
it back in gear I try to negotiate the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.730 
it back in gear I try to negotiate the
exact<00:01:59.700> same<00:02:00.000> muddy<00:02:00.869> Hill

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:03.740 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.200 

and<00:02:04.740> we're<00:02:04.890> not<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.460> not<00:02:05.550> gonna<00:02:05.760> make<00:02:06.000> it

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
and we're not we're not gonna make it

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.320 
and we're not we're not gonna make it
because<00:02:06.960> it's<00:02:07.350> letting<00:02:07.770> one<00:02:08.490> tire<00:02:08.759> slip<00:02:09.149> too

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
because it's letting one tire slip too

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.510 
because it's letting one tire slip too
much<00:02:09.539> which<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.110> reducing<00:02:10.709> the<00:02:10.830> traction<00:02:11.310> to

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
much which is reducing the traction to

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.220 
much which is reducing the traction to
the<00:02:11.670> other<00:02:12.240> tire<00:02:12.660> so<00:02:13.500> I<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:15.540> do<00:02:15.720> this<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.110> an

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
the other tire so I can do this as an

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.780 
the other tire so I can do this as an
experiment<00:02:16.590> we<00:02:17.010> go<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.220> loose<00:02:17.459> rocks<00:02:19.790> doesn't

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
experiment we go to loose rocks doesn't

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:27.100 
experiment we go to loose rocks doesn't
work<00:02:21.000> go<00:02:21.959> to<00:02:22.610> mogul

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:30.430 

doesn't<00:02:27.890> work<00:02:28.070> when<00:02:28.940> I<00:02:29.000> go<00:02:29.150> to<00:02:29.210> heavy<00:02:29.690> which<00:02:30.260> is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
doesn't work when I go to heavy which is

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.310 
doesn't work when I go to heavy which is
rock<00:02:30.740> which<00:02:31.340> in<00:02:31.550> theory<00:02:31.850> has<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.660> least

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
rock which in theory has the least

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.100 
rock which in theory has the least
amount<00:02:33.650> of<00:02:33.800> slippage<00:02:34.130> I<00:02:34.660> might<00:02:35.660> be<00:02:35.840> able<00:02:35.990> to

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
amount of slippage I might be able to

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.150 
amount of slippage I might be able to
make<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:37.360> okay<00:02:38.360> you<00:02:38.420> feel<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.260> there<00:02:39.860> we<00:02:39.980> go

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
make it okay you feel it and there we go

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:45.310 
make it okay you feel it and there we go
so<00:02:40.730> you<00:02:41.980> basically<00:02:42.980> have<00:02:43.730> a<00:02:44.270> choice<00:02:44.630> now<00:02:44.660> and

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
so you basically have a choice now and

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:51.130 
so you basically have a choice now and
what<00:02:46.310> I<00:02:46.340> find<00:02:46.760> is<00:02:47.150> that<00:02:47.180> a<00:02:47.660> track<00:02:49.120> okay<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.390> track

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
what I find is that a track okay a track

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:58.960 
what I find is that a track okay a track
is<00:02:51.500> the<00:02:51.530> same<00:02:52.010> as<00:02:54.220> multi-terrain<00:02:55.600> on<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:58.310> the

00:02:58.960 --> 00:02:58.970 
is the same as multi-terrain on for the

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.120 
is the same as multi-terrain on for the
rock<00:02:59.209> system<00:02:59.920> okay

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.130 
rock system okay

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:02.920 
rock system okay
so<00:03:01.610> that's<00:03:01.970> a<00:03:02.120> trick<00:03:02.420> you<00:03:02.540> know<00:03:02.630> what<00:03:02.750> to<00:03:02.810> go

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
so that's a trick you know what to go

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.229 
so that's a trick you know what to go
through<00:03:03.140> all<00:03:03.290> that<00:03:03.820> now<00:03:04.820> if<00:03:04.970> you're<00:03:05.120> still

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
through all that now if you're still

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.860 
through all that now if you're still
stuck<00:03:06.010> then<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.250> next<00:03:07.580> step<00:03:07.790> is<00:03:08.000> to<00:03:08.209> lock<00:03:08.390> the

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
stuck then the next step is to lock the

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:09.970 
stuck then the next step is to lock the
back<00:03:09.200> axle

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
back axle

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.670 
back axle
we<00:03:10.850> got<00:03:11.030> yet<00:03:11.209> another<00:03:11.480> beautiful<00:03:11.870> picture<00:03:12.470> on

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
we got yet another beautiful picture on

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:18.460 
we got yet another beautiful picture on
our<00:03:12.970> dashboard<00:03:13.970> and<00:03:16.600> we<00:03:17.600> can<00:03:17.750> also<00:03:17.900> use<00:03:18.080> the

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
our dashboard and we can also use the

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:26.270 
our dashboard and we can also use the
speed<00:03:18.739> control

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:29.309 

the<00:03:27.280> default<00:03:27.700> system<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.420> traction<00:03:28.750> control

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:29.319 
the default system is traction control

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:31.470 
the default system is traction control
in<00:03:29.620> let's<00:03:30.160> say<00:03:30.340> two<00:03:30.400> wheel<00:03:30.730> drive<00:03:30.760> four<00:03:31.330> wheel

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
in let's say two wheel drive four wheel

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:39.590 
in let's say two wheel drive four wheel
drive<00:03:31.750> high<00:03:32.080> so<00:03:32.709> if<00:03:32.800> I<00:03:32.920> accelerate<00:03:36.510> it

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.199 

basically<00:03:40.709> feathers<00:03:41.709> the<00:03:42.220> acceleration<00:03:43.030> so

00:03:43.199 --> 00:03:43.209 
basically feathers the acceleration so

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:45.210 
basically feathers the acceleration so
you<00:03:43.330> get<00:03:43.480> maximum<00:03:43.720> traction<00:03:44.350> off-road<00:03:45.010> that

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:45.220 
you get maximum traction off-road that

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.640 
you get maximum traction off-road that
may<00:03:45.400> not<00:03:45.550> be<00:03:45.610> the<00:03:45.880> best<00:03:46.030> thing<00:03:46.209> so<00:03:47.200> if<00:03:47.320> I<00:03:47.440> just

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
may not be the best thing so if I just

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.360 
may not be the best thing so if I just
tap<00:03:47.950> this<00:03:48.310> button<00:03:48.370> up<00:03:48.910> here<00:03:49.590> its<00:03:50.590> traction<00:03:51.220> off

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
tap this button up here its traction off

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.280 
tap this button up here its traction off
so<00:03:51.880> bike<00:03:52.270> so<00:03:52.510> right<00:03:52.720> now<00:03:54.600> it<00:03:55.600> just<00:03:55.870> keeps<00:03:56.110> on

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
so bike so right now it just keeps on

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.340 
so bike so right now it just keeps on
accelerating<00:03:57.300> without<00:03:58.300> the<00:03:58.540> traction

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
accelerating without the traction

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:03.150 
accelerating without the traction
Danny's<00:04:00.340> kicking<00:04:00.880> out<00:04:01.120> power<00:04:01.870> now<00:04:02.830> if<00:04:03.010> you

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
Danny's kicking out power now if you

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.650 
Danny's kicking out power now if you
want<00:04:03.459> to<00:04:03.610> also<00:04:04.060> turn<00:04:04.269> off<00:04:04.330> the<00:04:05.260> anti<00:04:06.250> slide<00:04:07.209> or

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 
want to also turn off the anti slide or

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:12.330 
want to also turn off the anti slide or
swerve<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:09.220> have<00:04:09.370> to<00:04:09.519> stop<00:04:09.850> the<00:04:10.090> vehicle<00:04:11.340> you

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
swerve you have to stop the vehicle you

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.370 
swerve you have to stop the vehicle you
have<00:04:12.459> to<00:04:12.610> hold<00:04:12.790> this<00:04:13.030> button<00:04:13.330> for<00:04:13.720> three

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:14.380 
have to hold this button for three

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:19.590 
have to hold this button for three
seconds<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:15.700> then<00:04:17.850> you<00:04:18.850> turn<00:04:19.150> off<00:04:19.390> the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
seconds and then you turn off the

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:22.560 
seconds and then you turn off the
traction<00:04:19.930> and<00:04:20.380> the<00:04:20.950> anti<00:04:21.280> swerve<00:04:21.669> so<00:04:22.060> now<00:04:22.270> it

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
traction and the anti swerve so now it

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.260 
traction and the anti swerve so now it
acts<00:04:22.870> like<00:04:23.140> the<00:04:23.380> way<00:04:23.500> you<00:04:23.560> want<00:04:23.919> not<00:04:24.760> what<00:04:25.150> the

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:25.270 
acts like the way you want not what the

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:28.290 
acts like the way you want not what the
car<00:04:25.480> is<00:04:25.510> trying<00:04:25.900> to<00:04:26.050> do<00:04:26.200> for<00:04:26.230> you<00:04:27.240> okay<00:04:28.240> so

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:28.300 
car is trying to do for you okay so

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:31.969 
car is trying to do for you okay so
here's<00:04:28.720> a<00:04:28.810> turn<00:04:29.140> all<00:04:30.100> the<00:04:30.340> equipment<00:04:31.000> is<00:04:31.360> now

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:31.979 
here's a turn all the equipment is now

00:04:31.979 --> 00:04:35.550 
here's a turn all the equipment is now
turned<00:04:32.979> off<00:04:33.750> so<00:04:34.750> as<00:04:34.900> we<00:04:35.050> come<00:04:35.229> around<00:04:35.320> the

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
turned off so as we come around the

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.850 
turned off so as we come around the
corner

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:39.860 

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:45.780 

okay<00:04:40.540> then<00:04:41.540> if<00:04:41.720> I<00:04:41.840> touch<00:04:42.110> up<00:04:42.350> here<00:04:43.540> now<00:04:44.540> all<00:04:45.050> the

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:45.790 
okay then if I touch up here now all the

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:49.660 
okay then if I touch up here now all the
electronics<00:04:46.790> are<00:04:46.970> on<00:04:47.270> again<00:04:48.130> so<00:04:49.130> now<00:04:49.280> we're

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
electronics are on again so now we're

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:54.820 
electronics are on again so now we're
going<00:04:49.820> to<00:04:49.910> slip<00:04:50.510> a<00:04:50.660> little<00:04:50.900> bit<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:53.500> all<00:04:54.500> the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
going to slip a little bit here all the

00:04:54.830 --> 00:05:04.879 
going to slip a little bit here all the
traction<00:04:55.130> genies<00:04:55.670> kicked<00:04:56.000> in<00:04:56.210> again

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:06.949 

you
