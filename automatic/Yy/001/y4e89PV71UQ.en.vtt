00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.700
 well now we are in the 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.680
 samsung showroom where we are going to 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.400
 explain how to take advantage and 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.760
 use one is marketing 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.890
 and all smart televisions 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.500
 they are wifi the first thing you have to do 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.529
 is to connect to your router in your home and 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.789
 put the internet key of your house 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.890
 because if not, it will not take advantage of 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 the TV the priority let's say the user 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.000
 is to view content or download 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.129
 applications like these or netflix 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.290
 youtube that are audiovisual content 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.690
 because it is what he thinks he takes 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.920
 a television in this case 55 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:47.970

 games and third social networks

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.049
 normal that happens that no more you're 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.030

00:01:02.369 --> 00:01:07.409
 this samsung case has applications 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.330
 exclusive as my selection for example

 You can start from 100 to 400 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.239
 megas are nothing past because they are 

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:04.940

 and the television turned off this TV 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.810

 corn optical audio output 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.770
 of course the cable where it goes 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.600
 connected to television antenna 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:43.210
 aerial antenna 

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.100

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.940
 this one connect another of the benefits that 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.960
 you could have with a samsung screen and 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.800
 Of course if you have a phone 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:03.670
 premium samsung galaxy note 4 a samsung 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.590
 galaxy alpha s 5 in that 4 is that you're going to 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.180
 able to stream that is all 

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.180
 that you see on your phone's screen 

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:12.280
 you'll be able to see on your TV 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:15.820
 they will connect by means of wifi point to 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.550
 point the phone and the TV then it goes 

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:21.040
 to have the advantage that you will be 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:23.620
 connected to the internet wifi of your home with 

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:25.600
 the phone and also the wifi of the 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.400
 point-to-point television and you're going to be able 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.660
 send all the content you have here 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:30.210
 for example if you are watching a video of 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:32.310
 Youtube 

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.440
 and not necessarily because it's smrtv is 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.789
 face if there are price ranges from the 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:43.319
 6 thousand 7 thousand pesos up to 40 45 thousand 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.660
 weights that will all depend on the size of 

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:48.870
 the technology if it is read if it is not read 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:51.150
 if it is 4k or it is not 4k but all in that 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.370
 range are going to do is martinis yes no 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:54.630
 doubt to have 4 cachetero still new 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:56.490
 content but next year if 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.740
 so I think if you go to 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.599
 invest if you invest for a little more 4k 

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:01.860
 that will last you many years without 

00:05:00.599 --> 00:05:04.500
 But you do not have enough money 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.840
 to buy a 55 TV 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.050
 inch led 4k that costs 150 thousand pesos 

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:13.410
 matter there are some six thousand eight thousand 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:15.509
 weights that are full hd that will have very 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.310
 good image quality in general and you go 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:21.440
 to have the interface of a television 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.440
 smart with all these applications 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.490
 these mirrors can obviously be made 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:31.770
 tailored to the clip can be a 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.530
 single large tele to very good screen 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:37.110
 logically the benefit that you have 

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:41.630
 to get this galaxy out 4 well it's the 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:41.630
 spain already has 2040
