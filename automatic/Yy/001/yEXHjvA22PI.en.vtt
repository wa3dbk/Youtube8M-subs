00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 greetings friends here your company is of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:06.359
 man bringing them a new batch of 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.370
 theories this time we will talk about 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.880
 clarence theories and some curiosities 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.710
 so without more or more let's start 

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.870
 clarence first curiosity ed style 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.369
 edd and eddy as many of us know the end 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.320
 of 10 and we observe that the 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.210
 fantastic adventures were only 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 stories told by the three friends 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.740
 while playing board games the 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.630
 Clarence series style reveals in a 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 chapter that actually clarence and his 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.390
 friends 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 jeff and added really just remember 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.559
 these adventures because apparently they 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.480
 they are already old so the adventures 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.460
 that clarence smoke and jeff live are just 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.520
 mere memories that possibly neither 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.590
 will not even happen two because jeff juice 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.390
 and clarence use robot legs like 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.430
 we could appreciate in the episode in the 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.829
 which shows the arrival of clarence to 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.989
 the school sumo jeff and clarence while 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.730
 remember how they became friends you see 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:56.489
 clearly that they have prostheses 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.590
 robotic with copper metal finishes and 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:00.420
 wood this may suggest that during 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.520
 some adventure these could have 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.409
 suffered an accident and were crippled 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.659
 until the moment in which these advanced 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.249
 prostheses were placed 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:09.929
 most likely at the same time 

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:11.670
 since in the asylum in which 

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.000
 they find they are the only ones with 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.069
 said prosthesis 3 theory jeff suffers from 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.840
 a syndrome the most logical explanation 

00:01:17.069 --> 00:01:21.359
 for compulsive behavior 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.549
 Jeff's aggressive erratic would be that this one 

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:25.799
 suffers from asperger syndrome which 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.869
 based on extreme social isolation 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.240
 concentration and aggressive behavior 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:32.399
 those who violate that concentration with 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.259
 obsession or tendencies to perfectionism 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.969
 this can be seen in the first 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.920
 chapter when it behaves so 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:40.079
 obsessive in that Clarence noticed that his 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.420
 dads despite the fact that this one has many 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.579
 you want to go to the bathroom this is clear part 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.379
 of this syndrome is the obsession with 

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:48.329
 cleaning which would explain its 

00:01:46.379 --> 00:01:51.539
 fearful and erratic behavior towards 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.759
 the germs theory 4 the possible reason 

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:55.860
 that his wife does not get along well 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.289
 theory proposes that both characters are 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.479
 totally opposite poles just like 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:02.729
 the double of sumo is a sociable guy 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.009
 funny and very hyperactive not to mention 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:07.530
 extroverted more though and it's very 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.569
 withdrawn antisocial and very shy even 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.979
 with his own friends this makes 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.670
 many times these two characters 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.590
 collisions then to the pair 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.810
 Doing this would not take well 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:18.790
 more the bond that unites them is clarence 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:21.040
 Well, both want Clarence as a friend 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.709
 to maintain that balance they learn 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.720
 sorry to get along fifth theory the 

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:27.670
 universe declare is similar to that of 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.319
 ten and this theory proposes that the 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:31.840
 neighborhood kids after having found 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:33.850
 Peace finally incarnated in a world 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:36.310
 again this due to the behavior of 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.100
 many characters like benzon and kevin ed 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:41.440
 and clarence double laws eddie added in his 

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.480
 that rim acz so another theory proposes 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.580
 that they would be the universe alter ego 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:46.840
 parallel to that universe and despite 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.600
 that both share characteristics 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.370
 similar do not seem the same fate that 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.440
 the others while the guys from 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.299
 neighborhood suffered breathed horrible 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.299
 these only have fun play are 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:03:00.549
 happy sixth theory that happened with amy 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.040
 its that if we all remember the episode 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:04.959
 a great day with a girl we will remember 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.000
 that she says to Clarence that she does not know with 

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.980
 who was to live with his mother or his 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.959
 father to which refers to a 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.880
 more divorce however after that 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:14.739
 episode we have not seen it again 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.660
 which is possible that she has gone 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.980
 will probably make cameos in others 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:21.050
 episodes or it will come back really clear 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.819
 when your mother touches you 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:25.010
 because in divorces many 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:28.190
 Sometimes both parents share times of 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.200
 visits seventh theory the weird luck 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:32.150
 of clarence this theory would say that 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.010
 Clarence being a carefree kid 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.319
 that expects nothing good or bad from 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.540
 life is rewarded with adventures or 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.700
 good things and that's how he is 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.010
 possesses an almost magical ability which 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.750
 is recognized by many allowing 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:47.239
 get away with it many times 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:49.459
 or simply enjoy situations 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.110
 good or bad because he does not see with eyes 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:54.319
 bad or with good eyes many 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:56.420
 situations eighth theory the scar and 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.400
 the new works of joshua as we see 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.769
 in the episode lost in the center 

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:03.109
 commercial a guy named joshua has 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:05.120
 a scar which added caused this 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.099
 because joshua surprised to added in 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:09.019
 some mischief and after scolding later 

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:11.390
 give him a high sermon without being able to 

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:13.700
 contain decides to attack him this fight 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.410
 causes a great disaster and makes it added 

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:17.720
 climb a ledge and rush towards 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.180
 joshua causing him a scar to 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.190
 same time I quantify the mother of 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:24.500
 sumo forcing him to pay the damages that 

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.490
 his son caused that way sumo every time 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.590
 that goes to the center 

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:29.810
 is forced to go in the seat to 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.150
 children among future jobs that I 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.009
 just have the car going to be your 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.319
 store manager I work in 

00:04:34.009 --> 00:04:38.210
 chicken restaurant rude riders since 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:40.520
 these allusions to the works that 

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:42.680
 many students perform if the video 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.630
 you liked it I like it and share it 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:47.919
 he spoke his company is mann wishing them 

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:47.919
 a good day a good day
