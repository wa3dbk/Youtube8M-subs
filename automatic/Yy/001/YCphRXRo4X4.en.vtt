to each other well you said there's

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:57.410 
to each other well you said there's
something<00:00:56.670> else<00:00:56.789> as<00:00:56.940> well<00:00:56.969> the<00:00:57.180> Palmer

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
something else as well the Palmer

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.540 
something else as well the Palmer
collection<00:00:57.719> correct<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.440> went<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.739> 256

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
collection correct we went from 256

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.389 
collection correct we went from 256
levels<00:00:59.699> of<00:01:00.030> pressure<00:01:00.660> sensitivity<00:01:01.140> to<00:01:01.469> 2048

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
levels of pressure sensitivity to 2048

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
levels of pressure sensitivity to 2048
so<00:01:02.609> it's<00:01:02.730> almost<00:01:02.820> times<00:01:03.329> as<00:01:03.480> much<00:01:03.629> resident<00:01:04.140> so

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
so it's almost times as much resident so

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.109 
so it's almost times as much resident so
when<00:01:04.680> you<00:01:04.769> go<00:01:04.920> sometimes<00:01:05.549> I<00:01:05.670> with<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:05.880> older

when you go sometimes I with the older
versions<00:01:06.420> at<00:01:06.510> least<00:01:06.630> not<00:01:06.810> yours<00:01:07.049> but<00:01:07.229> in<00:01:07.380> the

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
versions at least not yours but in the

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.080 
versions at least not yours but in the
early<00:01:07.500> days<00:01:07.950> of<00:01:07.979> pressing<00:01:08.610> city<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.880> would<00:01:08.939> go

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
early days of pressing city you would go

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.850 
early days of pressing city you would go
from<00:01:09.240> really<00:01:09.510> small<00:01:09.750> to<00:01:09.960> kinda<00:01:10.140> medium<00:01:10.439> to<00:01:10.680> big

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
from really small to kinda medium to big

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.560 
from really small to kinda medium to big

curve as you exactly you get more of a

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.660 
curve as you exactly you get more of a
mid<00:01:15.030> middle<00:01:15.479> middle<00:01:15.780> range<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.439> saw<00:01:16.830> how<00:01:17.549> are
