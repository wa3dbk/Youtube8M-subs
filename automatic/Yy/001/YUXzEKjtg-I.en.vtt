wrapped file suppl essel and this is on
team<00:00:16.830> deathmatch<00:00:17.570> so<00:00:18.570> they're<00:00:19.260> all<00:00:19.410> just<00:00:19.619> some

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
team deathmatch so they're all just some

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.609 
team deathmatch so they're all just some
slight<00:00:20.580> variations<00:00:21.210> and<00:00:21.539> gameplay<00:00:22.730> so<00:00:23.730> Moab's

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:24.619 
slight variations and gameplay so Moab's

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:27.950 
slight variations and gameplay so Moab's
no<00:00:25.619> abs<00:00:25.830> are<00:00:26.070> quite<00:00:26.400> enjoyable<00:00:27.300> to<00:00:27.449> watch<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:27.779> I

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
no abs are quite enjoyable to watch I I

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.650 
no abs are quite enjoyable to watch I I
suppose<00:00:28.349> a<00:00:28.769> lot<00:00:29.609> of<00:00:29.699> people<00:00:29.880> find<00:00:30.300> enjoyment

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
suppose a lot of people find enjoyment

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.350 
suppose a lot of people find enjoyment
and<00:00:31.019> what<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.349> watching<00:00:31.830> them<00:00:31.980> but<00:00:32.279> I<00:00:32.520> don't

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
and what in watching them but I don't

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.569 
and what in watching them but I don't
know<00:00:33.630> I<00:00:33.660> just<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:34.290> always<00:00:35.010> just<00:00:35.160> thought<00:00:35.280> they

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
know I just I always just thought they

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:38.110 
know I just I always just thought they
will<00:00:35.730> all<00:00:35.940> wait<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.480> little<00:00:36.719> bit<00:00:36.840> overrated

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:38.120 
will all wait a little bit overrated

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.750 
will all wait a little bit overrated
because<00:00:39.120> my<00:00:39.629> opinion<00:00:40.020> gameplay<00:00:40.440> is<00:00:40.649> not<00:00:40.980> the

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
because my opinion gameplay is not the

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.580 
because my opinion gameplay is not the
most<00:00:42.000> important<00:00:42.570> thing<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:42.899> a<00:00:43.020> commentary

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
most important thing in a commentary

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.680 
most important thing in a commentary
video<00:00:44.010> it's<00:00:44.520> more<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:44.850> the<00:00:45.120> voice<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
video it's more about the voice of the

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.350 
video it's more about the voice of the
common<00:00:46.079> table<00:00:46.260> and<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:47.670> quality<00:00:47.940> of<00:00:48.210> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
common table and the quality of the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.819 
common table and the quality of the
video<00:00:48.629> stuff<00:00:48.899> like<00:00:49.050> that<00:00:49.079> but<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.620> gameplay

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
video stuff like that but the gameplay

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.029 
video stuff like that but the gameplay
itself<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:50.670> could<00:00:51.570> really<00:00:51.690> kill<00:00:52.020> us<00:00:52.230> about<00:00:52.530> so

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
itself I could really kill us about so

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:55.369 
itself I could really kill us about so
what<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.789> want<00:00:53.969> to<00:00:54.030> talk<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.170> call<00:00:55.350> of

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
what I want to talk about is the call of

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.150 
what I want to talk about is the call of
duty<00:00:55.710> community<00:00:57.199> so<00:00:58.199> I<00:00:58.440> think<00:00:58.590> the<00:00:58.890> call<00:00:59.070> of

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
duty community so I think the call of

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.360 
duty community so I think the call of
duty<00:00:59.190> community<00:00:59.520> has<00:01:00.239> went<00:01:00.510> down<00:01:00.719> on<00:01:00.960> in<00:01:01.949> the

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
duty community has went down on in the

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.329 
duty community has went down on in the
past<00:01:02.550> steel<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.040> call<00:01:05.220> of<00:01:05.309> duty

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
past steel so so the call of duty

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.609

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.380 
some money so I I think since black ops

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.649 
some money so I I think since black ops
it's<00:01:46.380> gone<00:01:46.619> wolf<00:01:47.009> because<00:01:47.549> black<00:01:48.390> ops

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
it's gone wolf because black ops

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.780 
it's gone wolf because black ops
introduced<00:01:49.110> steal<00:01:49.470> the<00:01:50.040> April<00:01:50.399> mode<00:01:50.579> and

introduced steal the April mode and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.539 
introduced steal the April mode and
people<00:01:51.659> can<00:01:51.840> basically<00:01:51.990> use<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.890> camera<00:01:53.220> like

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
people can basically use a camera like

supply and demand will actually want
more<00:04:18.409> demand<00:04:18.859> than<00:04:19.099> supply<00:04:19.329> so<00:04:20.329> it's<00:04:21.200> battle

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
more demand than supply so it's battle

three<00:04:29.580> videos<00:04:30.030> a<00:04:30.570> week<00:04:30.600> from<00:04:31.290> your<00:04:31.470> favorite

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
three videos a week from your favorite

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.140 
three videos a week from your favorite
calm<00:04:31.980> tables<00:04:32.490> and<00:04:32.730> now<00:04:33.360> it's<00:04:33.600> a<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:35.150> essential

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:36.150 
calm tables and now it's a on essential

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.660 
calm tables and now it's a on essential
video<00:04:36.810> a<00:04:36.870> day<00:04:37.170> or<00:04:37.470> you'll<00:04:37.740> basically<00:04:37.920> screwed

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:38.670 
video a day or you'll basically screwed

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.870 
video a day or you'll basically screwed
so<00:04:39.540> I<00:04:40.490> think<00:04:41.490> I<00:04:41.970> think<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:42.540> demand<00:04:42.870> of

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:43.880 
so I think I think the demand of

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.520 
so I think I think the demand of
watching<00:04:44.880> videos<00:04:45.150> needs<00:04:45.390> to<00:04:45.480> go<00:04:45.630> up<00:04:45.780> and<00:04:45.960> how

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
watching videos needs to go up and how

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.560 
watching videos needs to go up and how
you<00:04:46.590> do<00:04:46.830> that<00:04:47.070> well<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.760> can't<00:04:48.150> really<00:04:48.390> do

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570 
you do that well you can't really do

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.140 
you do that well you can't really do
that<00:04:48.600> because<00:04:49.400> you<00:04:50.400> have<00:04:50.610> to<00:04:50.760> have<00:04:51.000> like<00:04:51.120> a

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:51.150 
that because you have to have like a

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:53.660 
that because you have to have like a
monopoly<00:04:51.750> over<00:04:51.900> and<00:04:52.530> you<00:04:52.920> can't<00:04:53.190> because<00:04:53.460> all

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:53.670 
monopoly over and you can't because all

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:55.370 
monopoly over and you can't because all
these<00:04:53.820> networks<00:04:54.270> are<00:04:54.450> just<00:04:54.630> popping<00:04:54.870> people

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:55.380 
these networks are just popping people

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.990 
these networks are just popping people
