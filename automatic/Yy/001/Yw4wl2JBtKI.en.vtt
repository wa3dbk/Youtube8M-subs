00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
a Kai's analog Custom Shop it is a true

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.400 
a Kai's analog Custom Shop it is a true
bypass<00:00:10.700> 100%<00:00:11.700> pure<00:00:12.000> analog<00:00:12.389> guitar<00:00:12.929> pedal<00:00:13.230> and

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
bypass 100% pure analog guitar pedal and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.829 
bypass 100% pure analog guitar pedal and
there's<00:00:14.370> a<00:00:14.460> lot<00:00:14.610> going<00:00:14.880> on<00:00:15.030> here<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.330> let's<00:00:15.540> go

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
there's a lot going on here so let's go

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.590 
there's a lot going on here so let's go
through<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> controls<00:00:16.850> our<00:00:17.850> level<00:00:18.420> knob

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
through the controls our level knob

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.279 
through the controls our level knob
controls<00:00:18.960> our<00:00:19.590> overall<00:00:20.160> volume<00:00:20.930> we<00:00:21.930> have<00:00:21.960> an

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
controls our overall volume we have an

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.950 
controls our overall volume we have an
EQ<00:00:22.859> section<00:00:23.100> here<00:00:23.519> with<00:00:23.820> low<00:00:24.119> mid<00:00:24.660> and<00:00:24.869> high

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
EQ section here with low mid and high

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.130 
EQ section here with low mid and high
and<00:00:25.710> our<00:00:26.640> mid<00:00:26.910> also<00:00:27.269> has<00:00:27.390> a<00:00:27.420> mid<00:00:27.660> frequency

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
and our mid also has a mid frequency

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.380 
and our mid also has a mid frequency
selector<00:00:28.619> so<00:00:29.130> we<00:00:29.250> can<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.640> across<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> mid

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
selector so we can go across the mid

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.479 
selector so we can go across the mid
frequency<00:00:30.810> spectrum<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:31.920> cut<00:00:32.219> it<00:00:32.250> or

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
frequency spectrum and then cut it or

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.430 
frequency spectrum and then cut it or
boost<00:00:32.940> it

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
boost it

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.889 
boost it
our<00:00:35.040> distortion<00:00:35.910> knob<00:00:36.120> controls<00:00:36.420> the

our distortion knob controls the

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.220 
our distortion knob controls the
saturation<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.620> our<00:00:37.739> distortion<00:00:38.370> and<00:00:39.230> for

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:40.230 
saturation of our distortion and for

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.490 
saturation of our distortion and for
switches<00:00:40.739> we<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.670> a<00:00:42.110> direct<00:00:43.110> recording

switch which we won't use in this case

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.270 
switch which we won't use in this case
because<00:00:46.260> we're<00:00:46.410> going<00:00:46.530> through<00:00:46.620> an<00:00:46.829> amplifier

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
because we're going through an amplifier

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.920 
because we're going through an amplifier
but<00:00:47.520> if<00:00:47.640> you<00:00:47.730> were<00:00:47.820> doing<00:00:47.969> home<00:00:48.539> studio

and off obviously in the on position

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.030 
and off obviously in the on position
we're<00:01:05.280> cutting<00:01:05.670> our<00:01:05.820> highs<00:01:06.030> and<00:01:06.290> then<00:01:07.290> since

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
we're cutting our highs and then since

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.670 
we're cutting our highs and then since
this<00:01:08.159> is<00:01:08.369> part<00:01:08.610> of<00:01:08.670> the<00:01:08.790> dr3<00:01:09.390> series<00:01:09.810> we<00:01:10.470> have

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
this is part of the dr3 series we have

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.280 
this is part of the dr3 series we have
another<00:01:11.070> 3-way<00:01:11.520> selector<00:01:11.659> we're<00:01:12.659> in<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.990> warm

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
another 3-way selector we're in the warm

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
another 3-way selector we're in the warm
position<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.070> have<00:01:14.220> diode<00:01:14.610> clipping<00:01:15.090> fat

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
position we have diode clipping fat

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.170 
position we have diode clipping fat
position<00:01:16.290> we<00:01:16.470> have<00:01:16.590> LED<00:01:17.100> clipping<00:01:17.549> and<00:01:17.729> the

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
position we have LED clipping and the

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.550 
position we have LED clipping and the
boost<00:01:18.420> position<00:01:18.930> in<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.140> middle<00:01:19.290> is<00:01:19.530> a

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
boost position in the middle is a

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:22.820 
boost position in the middle is a
combination<00:01:20.220> of<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.400> two<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.680> we're<00:01:22.680> going<00:01:22.770> to

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
combination of the two so we're going to

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.410 
combination of the two so we're going to
hear<00:01:23.100> some<00:01:23.130> different<00:01:23.340> sounds<00:01:24.060> out<00:01:24.180> of<00:01:24.210> this

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
hear some different sounds out of this

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.190 
hear some different sounds out of this
pedal<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.560> are<00:01:25.770> going<00:01:26.659> through<00:01:27.659> a<00:01:27.750> clean

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
pedal we are going through a clean

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:32.830 
pedal we are going through a clean
channel<00:01:28.650> on<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:29.310> Marshall<00:01:29.880> amplifier

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:32.840 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.850 

so<00:01:33.439> our<00:01:34.009> first<00:01:34.640> setting<00:01:35.450> is<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.689> zakk<00:01:36.590> wylde

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:36.860 
so our first setting is a zakk wylde

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.780 
so our first setting is a zakk wylde
style<00:01:37.390> distortion<00:01:38.390> and<00:01:39.369> we're<00:01:40.369> in<00:01:40.460> the<00:01:40.549> boost

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
style distortion and we're in the boost

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.590 
style distortion and we're in the boost
set<00:01:41.060> boost<00:01:41.720> position<00:01:42.170> high<00:01:42.979> cut<00:01:43.250> is<00:01:43.430> off<00:01:43.610> EQ

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:44.600 
set boost position high cut is off EQ

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.270 
set boost position high cut is off EQ
mode<00:01:44.750> is<00:01:44.869> classic<00:01:45.409> and<00:01:46.539> our<00:01:47.539> lows<00:01:47.990> are<00:01:48.200> up<00:01:48.350> mids

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:49.280

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.100 
mode is classic and our lows are up mids
are<00:01:49.429> cut<00:01:49.670> just<00:01:49.909> slightly<00:01:50.149> highs<00:01:50.689> are<00:01:50.899> cut

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
are cut just slightly highs are cut

00:01:51.110 --> 00:02:21.460 
are cut just slightly highs are cut
let's<00:01:51.799> hear<00:01:51.920> how<00:01:52.039> it<00:01:52.070> sounds

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:23.440 

okay<00:02:22.310> next<00:02:22.550> we're<00:02:22.820> going<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.000> check<00:02:23.270> out<00:02:23.420> a

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
okay next we're going to check out a

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.920 
okay next we're going to check out a
stoner<00:02:24.290> metal<00:02:24.530> setting<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:26.180> are<00:02:26.210> going<00:02:26.720> to

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
stoner metal setting we are going to

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
stoner metal setting we are going to
bring<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.890> our<00:02:28.040> high<00:02:28.310> cut<00:02:28.610> to<00:02:28.970> lose<00:02:29.150> some<00:02:29.390> of

bring in our high cut to lose some of

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.610 
bring in our high cut to lose some of
those<00:02:29.570> highs<00:02:29.870> keep<00:02:30.740> the<00:02:30.860> high<00:02:30.980> EQ<00:02:31.400> down<00:02:31.730> and<00:02:32.620> we

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
those highs keep the high EQ down and we

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:38.080 
those highs keep the high EQ down and we
will<00:02:33.890> keep<00:02:34.550> our<00:02:34.790> mids<00:02:35.690> scooped<00:02:36.440> a<00:02:36.620> bit<00:02:37.090> keep

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
will keep our mids scooped a bit keep

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.770 
will keep our mids scooped a bit keep
our<00:02:38.300> lows<00:02:38.600> up<00:02:39.070> our<00:02:40.070> boost<00:02:40.430> position<00:02:41.240> stays<00:02:41.600> the

our lows up our boost position stays the
same<00:02:42.020> on<00:02:42.170> the<00:02:42.260> drive<00:02:42.470> three<00:02:42.770> switch<00:02:43.010> so<00:02:43.340> the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:43.430 
same on the drive three switch so the

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:44.560 
same on the drive three switch so the
main<00:02:43.580> change<00:02:43.850> we're<00:02:44.000> making<00:02:44.030> is<00:02:44.420> we're

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:44.570 
main change we're making is we're

00:02:44.570 --> 00:03:16.840 
main change we're making is we're
getting<00:02:44.810> rid<00:02:44.930> of<00:02:44.960> a<00:02:45.410> lot<00:02:45.440> of<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.710> highs

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:16.850 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:19.940 

okay<00:03:17.850> from<00:03:18.030> here<00:03:18.270> let's<00:03:19.110> go<00:03:19.230> into<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.470> scooped

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
okay from here let's go into a scooped

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.670 
okay from here let's go into a scooped
mid<00:03:20.310> or<00:03:20.550> new<00:03:21.210> metal<00:03:21.570> radio<00:03:22.140> rock<00:03:22.380> type

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
mid or new metal radio rock type

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.270 
mid or new metal radio rock type
distortion<00:03:23.870> will<00:03:24.870> bring<00:03:25.170> our<00:03:25.320> level<00:03:25.830> up<00:03:25.980> just

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
distortion will bring our level up just

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.820 
distortion will bring our level up just
a<00:03:26.400> bit<00:03:26.610> increase<00:03:27.570> our<00:03:27.780> lows<00:03:28.140> to<00:03:28.470> the<00:03:28.560> point

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:28.830 
a bit increase our lows to the point

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.670 
a bit increase our lows to the point
where<00:03:28.980> we<00:03:29.100> get<00:03:29.220> some<00:03:29.430> low-end<00:03:29.910> resonance<00:03:30.680> we

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
where we get some low-end resonance we

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.630 
where we get some low-end resonance we
will<00:03:31.890> keep<00:03:32.670> our<00:03:32.880> mid<00:03:33.180> frequencies<00:03:33.810> scooped

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
will keep our mid frequencies scooped

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.810 
will keep our mid frequencies scooped
take<00:03:35.640> away<00:03:35.970> our<00:03:36.330> high<00:03:37.050> cut<00:03:37.410> give<00:03:38.370> ourselves<00:03:38.490> a

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:38.820 
take away our high cut give ourselves a

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:41.480 
take away our high cut give ourselves a
little<00:03:38.880> bit<00:03:39.090> more<00:03:39.210> highs<00:03:40.220> dial<00:03:41.220> back<00:03:41.430> the

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:41.490 
little bit more highs dial back the

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:43.460 
little bit more highs dial back the
distortion<00:03:42.150> just<00:03:42.360> a<00:03:42.450> bit<00:03:42.660> and<00:03:42.870> we're<00:03:43.320> going<00:03:43.410> to

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
distortion just a bit and we're going to

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.100 
distortion just a bit and we're going to
move<00:03:44.370> the<00:03:44.550> drive<00:03:44.850> three<00:03:45.180> switch<00:03:45.450> to<00:03:45.690> the<00:03:45.810> warm

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
move the drive three switch to the warm

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.250 
move the drive three switch to the warm
position<00:03:46.380> and<00:03:46.860> move<00:03:47.550> the<00:03:47.730> EQ<00:03:48.360> mode<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:49.110> our

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
position and move the EQ mode to our

00:03:49.260 --> 00:04:05.690 
position and move the EQ mode to our
modern<00:03:49.650> position

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:18.830 

you

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.599 

okay<00:04:19.840> and<00:04:20.049> then<00:04:20.349> last<00:04:20.680> up<00:04:21.009> we're<00:04:21.400> going<00:04:21.519> to

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
okay and then last up we're going to

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.999 
okay and then last up we're going to
show<00:04:21.819> you<00:04:21.849> a<00:04:22.090> thrash<00:04:22.900> metal<00:04:23.259> or<00:04:23.379> death<00:04:23.710> metal

00:04:23.999 --> 00:04:24.009 
show you a thrash metal or death metal

00:04:24.009 --> 00:04:25.860 
show you a thrash metal or death metal
type<00:04:24.190> distortion<00:04:24.759> which<00:04:25.150> is<00:04:25.300> very<00:04:25.479> mids

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
type distortion which is very mids

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:30.270 
type distortion which is very mids
driven<00:04:26.580> so<00:04:27.580> let's<00:04:28.500> bring<00:04:29.500> our<00:04:29.680> lows<00:04:29.949> back<00:04:30.250> a

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:30.280 
driven so let's bring our lows back a

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.510 
driven so let's bring our lows back a
bit<00:04:30.729> to<00:04:30.970> lose<00:04:31.180> some<00:04:31.419> of<00:04:31.449> that<00:04:31.569> resonance<00:04:32.139> and

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
bit to lose some of that resonance and

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.420 
bit to lose some of that resonance and
sweep<00:04:33.520> our<00:04:33.729> mid<00:04:34.000> frequency<00:04:34.659> over<00:04:35.190> boost<00:04:36.190> our

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:36.430 
sweep our mid frequency over boost our

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:38.580 
sweep our mid frequency over boost our
mids<00:04:36.669> in<00:04:36.819> this<00:04:37.000> case<00:04:37.240> bring<00:04:38.050> in<00:04:38.199> some<00:04:38.440> more

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
mids in this case bring in some more

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.719 
mids in this case bring in some more
more<00:04:38.979> highs<00:04:39.220> and<00:04:39.870> more<00:04:40.870> distortion<00:04:41.729> change

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
more highs and more distortion change

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.510 
more highs and more distortion change
our<00:04:42.940> Drive<00:04:43.210> three<00:04:43.599> switch<00:04:43.870> to<00:04:44.110> fat<00:04:44.409> keep<00:04:45.370> our
