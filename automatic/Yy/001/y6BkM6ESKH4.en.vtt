00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.789
 peking 18 

00:00:13.609 --> 00:00:16.049
 my dear sister 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.279
 I've been safe and alive for a week on the street 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.749
 but prepared 

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:25.470
 the men and women who have given me shelter here 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.140
 also in the sense that the plainest path 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.149
 is taken by mercenaries and bandits who are these lands 

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.300
 efe 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:36.310
 what that means 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:39.260
 When I left Rome ten months ago 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.950
 I did it with a single firm in discovering what our party could not do 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.479
 in a letter written a year before birth 

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:50.909
 mentions a library hidden under the stones of the castle asia 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.790
 a sanctuary full of priceless here 

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.520
 what will i find when i arrived 

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.900
 who needs 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.130
 a bet that templarios impatient as he fears him most 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.020
 otherwise it is the sense of a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.910
 cold and lonely 

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:16.770
 farmhouses not harbor the killers for almost 300 years 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.230
 we can keep claiming crazy 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.230
 we are not welcome 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.660
 with this announcement 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.800
 not for being at home 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:32.800
 but because our conflict seems to be moving 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:39.070
 today I have more questions than answers 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.560
 that's why he's arrived late 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.320
 I will look for clarity 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.320
 in search of the servitude and the one that left the grenade 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:52.960
 better understand the purpose of our 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.760
 and my place 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.400
 hours 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.640
 as it happened 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.930
 also the day of my life my intention is to change 

00:02:11.329 --> 00:02:14.619
 do not look for revenge and retaliation 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.619
 but they struggle to continue the search for the truth 

00:02:18.229 --> 00:02:20.899
 so everyone can benefit 

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:23.899
 The story is not new 

00:02:24.539 --> 00:02:25.399
 a tone to suffer
