00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.029

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.400

 of the matica extreme italia scooter 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.620
 matic and regional scooters and scooters 

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.510
 matic retica have created contests 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.520
 extremely bright and for the first time 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.590
 have complied with the new standard of 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:49.640
 security that provides for the adoption of 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:51.350
 brake lever and matica scooter 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.390
 extreme pole position for carlo 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.430
 starling to complete the first row there 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:57.620
 sono bonomo is found while lentini 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.390
 salerno and rizzo occupy the second row 

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:01.489
 but they did set times all over 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.170
 respect turns off the traffic light that gives the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.600
 via race 1 and the big group moves 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.490
 compact in curve 1 the funnel is crazy 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:09.830
 bonomo immediately slips into the heat of 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.630
 take a night stand and a little later in three 

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.490
 find themselves tasting the asphalt but 

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.620
 no one retires and the race continues with 

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.100
 sturniolo rizzo and salerno on the podium 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.750
 virtual 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.400
 of course the race loses much of the 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.000
 spectacle promised by the first 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.650
 curves 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.510
 and in fact the team bearer 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:25.760
 racing chips administers his 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.770
 leadership without too many worries 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.900
 even if close it never appears able 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.909
 to worry him is the only real fight 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.979
 on the track is the one that sees opposed 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.600
 bonomo and salerno are the ones to have fun 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.920
 and to entertain the public with 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.409
 break away through the breathtaking 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.750
 sturniolo wins race 1 on rizzo 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:43.610
 found bonomo salerno and lentini in 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:45.289
 all depart strong afternoons except 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.000
 that remains literally planted 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:49.640
 on the grill and is forced to leave 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.649
 the race ahead while march serrata 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.270
 with sturniolo bonomo lentini is found 

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.219
 all vying for victory 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.990
 the train continues compact and in half 

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:59.210
 race begins to make way for bonomo that 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.369
 he finds himself behind while Lentini 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.289
 loses the wake of its ninth rivals 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.090
 round the round loses also found e 

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:05.539
 so two remain to contend for the 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.430
 victory 

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:09.110
 bonomo appears a lot on the ball and passes to 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.130
 command the eleventh of the fifteen 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.990
 expected turns 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.820
 the brawl continues without respite up 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.370
 on arrival you decide on the photo finish 

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:17.870
 bonomo for shifts or lo for only 44 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.850
 thousandths of a second 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.560
 the results of race 1, however, reward the 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.570
 number 5 which makes the second stage its own 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.340
 Sicilian by adjusting its own bonomo e 

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.310
 salerno begins to take this from us 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.450
 really even if today I have to say that I have 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.090
 made the computer a bit 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.570
 in the second card, however, we say that 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.790
 good vintage I am well put you do 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:45.790
 that little training deficit however 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:47.620
 okay as tradition is rich 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.750
 starting line-up for the scooter 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.610
 matic of the regions to excel in the 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.290
 morning crono and marco de pasquale 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:55.030
 with marino and boccaccio alongside it 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.610
 in the front row behind them are 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.890
 davide de pasquale prop and saracen 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:01.300
 at the start and right davide de pasquale a 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:03.070
 shoot big from the second row 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.140
 and to take the lead by climbing over 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.790
 just the poleman when you close the 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.650
 first round the two have all to 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:10.300
 the more dangerous it looks 

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.400
 Boccaccio and marine while slightly 

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.710
 more detached but no less aggressive 

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.870
 we find domino prop cascella 

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.280
 Saracen and Polizzi before the middle of 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.710
 race it is clear that there will be four of them 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.880
 to play the march or better in three davids 

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:23.860
 de pasquale in fact loses 

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.870
 suddenly positions going down 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:27.670
 fourth place but above all fails 

00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.950
 more to keep the pace of his direct 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.450
 opponents now to command that is marco de 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.430
 Easter that finds itself marine and 

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:35.620
 Boccaccio in the exhaust between these is 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.600
 the number 23 of the team pbr a 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.000
 pull out the nails taking two 

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:41.950
 return to command operations but 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.960
 de pasquale does not let go of its own 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.150
 on the last lap he places the overtaking that 

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:47.680
 worth the race in race 2 the poleman 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.100
 start well and keep the head of 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.470
 race 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.660
 behind him there are marino davide de 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:53.440
 Easter Boccaccio Cascella and so on 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.330
 all the others 

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:57.490
 in front of it the train turns loose and 

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:59.380
 positions seem to be outlined instead a 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.480
 the center of the group are all short irons 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:03.640
 to conquer some points when you 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.620
 it surpasses the zero turn of the marine buoy 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.050
 the gap is now glued to marco de 

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:09.850
 the number 73 under pressure 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.890
 wrong in a hairpin loses the 

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:14.050
 back and is forced to re-enter 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.180
 track even in ninth position 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:17.980
 shortly after also davide de pasquale 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.870
 slips in the same curve leaving the 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.910
 second provisional square in the hands of 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.280
 domino with a prop that is found third 

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.690
 the flag arrives on the tenth lap 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:28.210
 red following another slip 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.520
 with the pilots who leave shortly after for 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.260
 a sprint of five samuele marine laps 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:34.450
 he continues his ride while 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.430
 domino is forced to retire so in the 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.260
 sum of the two sections are police 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.120
 April to rise on the second and third 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.540
 step of the podium of heats while 

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:44.790
 that of the day is composed of seas 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.320
 marco di pasquale polizzi is one 

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:50.790
 meteor very difficult to login 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:53.310
 a bad one because many problems do some 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:55.950
 fall however we have been calm 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:00.099
 reasoned and we made it a sin 

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:03.889
 for marco I give while I was fighting 

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:05.689
 slipped but it went so thank you 

00:05:03.889 --> 00:05:06.800
 my family all the ones there 

00:05:05.689 --> 00:05:12.289
 they believe in me 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:14.150
 we believe on the track of the second sun 

00:05:12.289 --> 00:05:15.770
 seasonal stop also for young people 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:17.780
 scooter riders, but that replies to you 

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:19.370
 barbera savior is the best in 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.259
 qualifications and is supported in the front row 

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:23.509
 from the old and the cerruto behind them 

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.400
 we find lisitano agosta and pantaleo 

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:28.220
 part of race 1 is the entire front row 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.419
 snap of barbera sling abbot cerruto solo 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:31.520
 one leaves some more 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.530
 while others immediately lose contact 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.210
 pantaleo runs into a slip already 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.220
 during the first round and finds himself at 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.110
 fund ranks while lisitano e 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:40.729
 agosta are at the foot of the virtual podium 

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.919
 in front instead there is a struggle to say the least 

00:05:40.729 --> 00:05:44.750
 tightened every point of the track seems 

00:05:42.919 --> 00:05:46.550
 good for attempting an abbot attack 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:48.379
 cerruto seem to be serious candidates for 

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.000
 victory in the heats but also barbera that 

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:52.129
 chased nearby can enter the 

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.569
 brawl past the turn of the cerruto 

00:05:52.129 --> 00:05:56.090
 he takes the lead but his leadership 

00:05:53.569 --> 00:05:57.379
 it lasts only two rounds, in fact yes 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:59.270
 takes over the head of the race 

00:05:57.379 --> 00:06:01.460
 resisting up to the checkered flag 

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:03.229
 Race 2 sees the excellent start of abbot 

00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:05.569
 while the poleman barbera remains 

00:06:03.229 --> 00:06:07.610
 planted on the finish line of the first lap on 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.949
 number 18 commands on lisitano agosta 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.539
 cerruto barbera and pantaleo agosta 

00:06:09.949 --> 00:06:13.789
 resists a few laps in second place 

00:06:11.539 --> 00:06:15.469
 but then he is sucked by the three directs 

00:06:13.789 --> 00:06:17.599
 trackers he has constantly in 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:18.800
 midway through the race, in fact, a cerruto a 

00:06:17.599 --> 00:06:20.779
 pass in second place 

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.029
 closely followed by Barbera and Lisitano 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:24.919
 in front of butt and try to escape but 

00:06:23.029 --> 00:06:27.110
 slowly it is recovered from cerruto 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:28.729
 the adriano motors team bearer stitches 

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:30.590
 in fact the tear but fails to 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:32.270
 place the winning overtaking also 

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:34.460
 because abbot defends himself with trade 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:36.469
 barbera meanwhile consolidated the third 

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:38.240
 step of the podium and with these positions 

00:06:36.469 --> 00:06:40.069
 the same as in race 1 you get the 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.979
 checkered flag abbot wins the stage 

00:06:40.069 --> 00:06:45.139
 of melilli with a well deserved double 

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:46.279
 makes you happy because this view does not 

00:06:45.139 --> 00:06:49.449
 he thought he was doing this and the result 

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:52.550
 thanks to my mechanical april motors 

00:06:49.449 --> 00:06:54.680
 which made it possible to make it an engine 

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:57.349
 always perfect I managed to make two 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.840
 beautiful good races thanks to the team a 

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:01.200
 those who follow me my friends for 

00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:04.430
 my girlfriend 

00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:04.430
 nothing for pasta
