00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.029
 Lake WÃ¶rthersee has been here for 32 years 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:08.400
 years the legendary gti meet 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.349
 many tuning fans are already traveling 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:15.030
 two weeks earlier to the excursion 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 in the morning you meet for the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.970
 No matter how much your favorites are 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.100
 from which country you know each other or you 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:27.349
 gets to know each other 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:31.009
 freshly polished then it goes to miles 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.850
 here is gossip clapped and 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.790
 talk shop 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.440
 regularly with the show 

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.160
 VW employee and tuning expert Mario 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.040
 and his buddies benny and vincent theirs 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.890
 preference is given to the so-called oem tuning 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.550
 that is, they build above all else 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.670
 original parts 1 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:55.489
 benny has its audi a3 brought the 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.260
 It looks subtle with almost 700 ps 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.930
 Fist thick under the hood 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.120
 this is the place for benni 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.800
 This inconspicuous that's just not 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.909
 everyone and you just always like that 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.550
 porsche or something like the taillights 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:09.410
 can show that cars over one 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:12.259
 Period of about two and a half years 

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.690
 was created from scratch 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.100
 pay attention here at the 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.490
 Performance increase is on the back 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.170
 turbocharger laid without it even works 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.570
 Nothing does that practically here 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.130
 Music The engine is a simple turbo 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.720
 base times been 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:27.920
 Everything was done 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.649
 you can actually imagine 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.179
 so that this mobile is also stable 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.560
 and this performance has also tolerated 

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:35.060
 So about another vehicle or 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.220
 I have never thought like that 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.720
 for me it was the vehicle which is 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.399
 stop necessarily wanted to continue and 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:42.709
 modify that makes you proud 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:55.520
 every event is proud of vincent 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:57.739
 his golf r32 of the first generation 32 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.660
 remained faithful and every year something 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:02:02.920
 changed small things began that 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:05.390
 I expanded in other words the 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.399
 interchanged interiors went off 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.379
 that you build another exhaust system 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.690
 and then I upgraded 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:14.330
 on 6 piston brake system front of 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:16.250
 write Porsche cayenne with audi s4 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.379
 the possibilities of tuning with 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.190
 Original parts from the group seem 

00:02:18.379 --> 00:02:21.560
 limitless 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.970
 vincent is on the safe side I've got 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.000
 even the original parts all 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.290
 welded and keep if times 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.720
 someday the need is that one the 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:31.280
 back to original rebuilt friend marius 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.379
 looks around now 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.410
 because next to your own car it works 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:36.390
 Of course, there too 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.220
 to see what the others so it 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:43.710
 have pretty eye-catching tag 432 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.720
 rebuilt on turbo Indian very much 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.400
 work made complete originals 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.280
 interior upholstered in white leather 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:54.300
 original seats matching shoes stand 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.500
 Of course, there is something in it with it 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.170
 no longer drives to work every day 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.590
 but nice here's still a very 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.930
 Nice celebration of golf in oem style 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.000
 we now say rebuilt to a 1 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:12.540
 8 liters turbo ag 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:15.360
 dating from the golf gti nice g60 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:18.270
 with chrome and gold thats he over the 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.880
 show &amp; shine class pretty deep very much 

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:23.070
 The young boy is very big 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:25.470
 Do not talk his colleague here are 18 

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.910
 pay a place to the bumper 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:31.340
 bumper to the earth we see again 

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:33.180
 that's not all right now 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.640
 missed so-called aerial landing gear 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.730
 stock is worth putting in the 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:41.430
 scene that's just really steve is that 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:44.070
 Conclusion of the friends super exchange with 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.020
 like-minded class humor that 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:49.430
 they already have a present for 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:49.430
 scheduled for next year
