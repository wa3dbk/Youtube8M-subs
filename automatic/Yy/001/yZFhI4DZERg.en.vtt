00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
1 x zy IPS touchscreen this is a

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.780 
1 x zy IPS touchscreen this is a
gigabyte<00:01:48.420> model<00:01:48.600> and<00:01:49.250> the<00:01:50.250> rest<00:01:50.399> is<00:01:50.640> pretty

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
gigabyte model and the rest is pretty

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.870 
gigabyte model and the rest is pretty
standard<00:01:51.649> so<00:01:52.649> i'm<00:01:53.130> guessing<00:01:53.399> this<00:01:53.640> is<00:01:53.759> going

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
standard so i'm guessing this is going

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:55.190 
standard so i'm guessing this is going
to<00:01:53.939> be<00:01:54.000> a<00:01:54.030> black<00:01:54.270> version<00:01:54.479> it<00:01:54.780> looks<00:01:55.020> like<00:01:55.140> is

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
to be a black version it looks like is

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.719 
to be a black version it looks like is
going<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.380> be<00:01:55.439> coming<00:01:55.590> in<00:01:55.799> both<00:01:57.619> so<00:01:58.619> let's<00:01:58.799> see

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
going to be coming in both so let's see

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.620 
going to be coming in both so let's see
what<00:01:59.880> it<00:01:59.909> is<00:02:00.149> oh<00:02:02.000> it's<00:02:03.000> why

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
what it is oh it's why

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:12.570 
what it is oh it's why
okay<00:02:05.530> so<00:02:08.550> here<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.670> unit<00:02:09.940> is<00:02:10.090> it's<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:11.550> has<00:02:12.550> a

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
okay so here the unit is it's a has a

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.990 
okay so here the unit is it's a has a
funky<00:02:13.110> texture<00:02:14.970> nice<00:02:15.970> for<00:02:16.690> gripping<00:02:16.989> I<00:02:17.080> guess

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
funky texture nice for gripping I guess

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.040 
funky texture nice for gripping I guess

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
power volume up volume down and this

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.479 
power volume up volume down and this
looks<00:03:01.599> like<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:01.840> pinhole<00:03:02.170> reset<00:03:02.560> button<00:03:02.890> so

00:03:03.479 --> 00:03:03.489 
looks like the pinhole reset button so

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:06.900 
looks like the pinhole reset button so
you<00:03:03.549> have<00:03:03.819> any<00:03:03.940> issues<00:03:04.150> with<00:03:05.430> with<00:03:06.430> the<00:03:06.519> tablet

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
you have any issues with with the tablet

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:13.190 
you have any issues with with the tablet

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:13.200 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.479 

feel<00:03:14.200> like<00:03:14.290> the<00:03:14.410> mic<00:03:14.560> should<00:03:14.799> be<00:03:14.950> at<00:03:15.220> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
feel like the mic should be at the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:17.670 
feel like the mic should be at the
bottom<00:03:15.670> here<00:03:16.000> so<00:03:16.390> we'll<00:03:16.959> see<00:03:17.140> if<00:03:17.170> there's<00:03:17.530> an

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
bottom here so we'll see if there's an

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.580 
bottom here so we'll see if there's an
annual<00:03:18.040> this<00:03:18.400> manual<00:03:18.880> will<00:03:19.000> be<00:03:19.090> in<00:03:19.180> chinese

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:19.590 
annual this manual will be in chinese

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:38.760 
annual this manual will be in chinese
let's<00:03:20.590> power<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:20.859> on<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:28.290> mini<00:03:30.150> so

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:38.770 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:40.740 

so<00:03:39.340> there<00:03:39.490> we<00:03:39.550> can<00:03:39.700> see<00:03:39.880> this<00:03:40.000> is<00:03:40.210> a<00:03:40.240> number

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
so there we can see this is a number

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:57.240 
so there we can see this is a number
line<00:03:40.870> mini<00:03:41.110> on<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:41.590> starting<00:03:42.150> screen<00:03:45.300> and

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:06.960 

so<00:03:57.940> yeah<00:03:58.090> looks<00:03:58.360> like<00:03:58.450> stuff<00:04:05.160> hmm<00:04:06.160> so<00:04:06.670> I<00:04:06.700> guess

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:06.970 
so yeah looks like stuff hmm so I guess

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.520 
so yeah looks like stuff hmm so I guess
it<00:04:07.180> looks<00:04:07.210> like<00:04:07.450> it<00:04:07.600> is<00:04:07.630> like<00:04:07.750> that<00:04:08.050> the

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:08.530 
it looks like it is like that the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.770 
it looks like it is like that the
cameras<00:04:08.860> at<00:04:08.980> the<00:04:09.070> bottom<00:04:09.370> so<00:04:10.090> this<00:04:10.360> is<00:04:10.390> the

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
cameras at the bottom so this is the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:22.650 
cameras at the bottom so this is the
recording<00:04:11.940> button<00:04:12.990> or<00:04:13.990> the<00:04:14.050> whole

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.140 

you<00:04:23.200> could<00:04:23.350> at<00:04:23.440> least<00:04:23.500> say<00:04:23.770> too<00:04:23.830> much<00:04:24.150> this

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
you could at least say too much this

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.040 
you could at least say too much this
again<00:04:25.450> it's<00:04:25.570> all<00:04:25.690> in<00:04:25.810> Chinese<00:04:26.170> so<00:04:28.050> I'm

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:29.050 
again it's all in Chinese so I'm

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.300 
again it's all in Chinese so I'm
guessing<00:04:29.230> that's<00:04:29.440> probably<00:04:29.800> what<00:04:29.920> it<00:04:29.950> is<00:04:30.130> it's

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:30.310 
guessing that's probably what it is it's

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:33.900 
guessing that's probably what it is it's
like<00:04:30.430> Larry<00:04:30.640> said<00:04:32.160> okay<00:04:33.160> and<00:04:33.400> let's<00:04:33.640> see<00:04:33.790> what

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910
