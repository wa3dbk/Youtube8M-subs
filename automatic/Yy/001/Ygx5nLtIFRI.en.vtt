one way to help your students develop a

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.559 
one way to help your students develop a
growth<00:00:04.680> mindset<00:00:04.950> is<00:00:05.490> to<00:00:05.790> explain<00:00:06.210> that<00:00:06.420> the

00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
growth mindset is to explain that the

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.709 
growth mindset is to explain that the
brain<00:00:06.779> can<00:00:07.020> get<00:00:07.140> stronger<00:00:07.529> and<00:00:07.919> smarter

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
brain can get stronger and smarter

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.330 
brain can get stronger and smarter
research<00:00:09.719> shows<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.230> students<00:00:10.650> actually<00:00:11.160> do

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:11.340 
research shows that students actually do

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.089 
research shows that students actually do
better<00:00:11.610> in<00:00:11.820> school<00:00:11.940> when<00:00:12.360> they<00:00:12.480> learn<00:00:12.690> this

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:13.099 
better in school when they learn this

better in school when they learn this
for<00:00:14.099> example<00:00:14.400> you<00:00:14.880> can<00:00:15.480> explain<00:00:15.809> that<00:00:15.990> the

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
for example you can explain that the

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:18.290 
for example you can explain that the
