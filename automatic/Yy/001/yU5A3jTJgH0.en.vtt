00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
goggles so it's big enough that a set of

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.450 
goggles so it's big enough that a set of
goggles<00:01:21.810> will<00:01:22.200> find<00:01:22.500> as<00:01:22.740> well<00:01:22.950> in<00:01:23.159> there<00:01:23.310> and

it's<00:01:23.610> lined<00:01:23.939> with<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.390> felt<00:01:26.240> then<00:01:27.240> this

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
it's lined with that felt then this

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.830 
it's lined with that felt then this
section<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.020> bag

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.899 

this<00:01:32.679> is<00:01:32.829> just<00:01:33.009> another<00:01:33.250> example<00:01:33.399> of<00:01:33.789> the

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
this is just another example of the

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:35.940 
this is just another example of the
futures<00:01:34.240> that<00:01:34.390> we<00:01:34.450> put<00:01:34.750> in<00:01:34.899> a<00:01:35.079> lot<00:01:35.590> of<00:01:35.740> times

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
futures that we put in a lot of times

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.279 
futures that we put in a lot of times
these<00:01:36.100> things<00:01:36.159> will<00:01:36.520> fall<00:01:36.759> but<00:01:37.570> we've<00:01:37.780> added<00:01:37.960> a

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
these things will fall but we've added a

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.200 
these things will fall but we've added a
little<00:01:38.439> pull<00:01:38.799> here<00:01:39.100> a<00:01:39.219> little<00:01:39.520> pull<00:01:39.700> here<00:01:40.000> so

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
little pull here a little pull here so

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.789 
little pull here a little pull here so
that<00:01:40.390> doesn't<00:01:40.750> that<00:01:40.840> doesn't<00:01:40.899> fall<00:01:41.350> out<00:01:41.530> but

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:41.799 
that doesn't that doesn't fall out but

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:44.399 
that doesn't that doesn't fall out but
you<00:01:42.009> can<00:01:42.280> separate<00:01:42.969> it<00:01:43.210> so<00:01:43.420> that<00:01:43.929> you<00:01:44.049> get<00:01:44.200> lot

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:44.409 
you can separate it so that you get lot

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.980 
you can separate it so that you get lot
