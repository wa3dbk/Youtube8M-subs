on<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.540> neck<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.320> neck<00:02:01.350> also<00:02:02.070> moves<00:02:02.399> this<00:02:03.060> guy

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
on the neck the neck also moves this guy

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.319 
on the neck the neck also moves this guy
is<00:02:03.530> getting<00:02:04.530> stuck<00:02:05.040> all<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.880> his<00:02:06.000> joints<00:02:06.270> are

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
is getting stuck all of his joints are

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:07.940 
is getting stuck all of his joints are
getting<00:02:06.570> stuck<00:02:06.810> and<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.110> armor<00:02:07.350> does<00:02:07.500> pop<00:02:07.740> off

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
getting stuck and the armor does pop off

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.070 
getting stuck and the armor does pop off
so<00:02:08.250> I'm<00:02:09.030> gonna<00:02:09.239> have<00:02:09.390> to<00:02:09.420> describe<00:02:09.840> the

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
so I'm gonna have to describe the

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.780 
so I'm gonna have to describe the
articulation<00:02:10.800> because<00:02:10.979> a<00:02:11.009> lot<00:02:11.340> of<00:02:11.459> its<00:02:11.610> not

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
articulation because a lot of its not

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:12.970 
articulation because a lot of its not
actually<00:02:12.030> moving<00:02:12.569> for<00:02:12.750> me

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
actually moving for me

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.860 
actually moving for me
show<00:02:13.159> you<00:02:13.220> so<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.030> head<00:02:14.180> is<00:02:14.209> on<00:02:14.540> a<00:02:14.569> ball-joint

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870 
show you so the head is on a ball-joint

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:16.470 
show you so the head is on a ball-joint
it<00:02:15.260> gives<00:02:15.409> you<00:02:15.500> pretty<00:02:15.680> good<00:02:15.890> range<00:02:16.129> of<00:02:16.250> motion

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
it gives you pretty good range of motion

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.610 
it gives you pretty good range of motion
there<00:02:17.480> we<00:02:17.569> go<00:02:17.690> we<00:02:17.780> got<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:17.959> neck<00:02:18.200> movie<00:02:18.500> the

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:18.620 
there we go we got the neck movie the

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.309 
there we go we got the neck movie the
neck<00:02:18.769> is<00:02:18.920> on<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.069> ball-joint<00:02:19.340> as<00:02:19.790> well<00:02:20.290> so<00:02:21.290> a

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
neck is on a ball-joint as well so a

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:22.960 
neck is on a ball-joint as well so a
pretty<00:02:21.590> good<00:02:21.799> range<00:02:21.980> of<00:02:22.159> motion<00:02:22.459> for<00:02:22.610> the<00:02:22.760> head

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
pretty good range of motion for the head

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.280 
pretty good range of motion for the head
pretty<00:02:23.269> much<00:02:23.480> anything<00:02:23.720> you<00:02:23.930> need<00:02:24.049> to<00:02:24.140> do

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
pretty much anything you need to do

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.800 
pretty much anything you need to do
you'll<00:02:24.950> be<00:02:25.099> able<00:02:25.190> to<00:02:25.370> do<00:02:25.580> it's<00:02:26.060> not<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.480> best

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
you'll be able to do it's not the best

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.479 
you'll be able to do it's not the best
but<00:02:27.260> it's<00:02:27.830> pretty<00:02:28.010> good

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:28.489 
but it's pretty good

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:30.729 
but it's pretty good
the<00:02:28.849> shoulders<00:02:29.299> are<00:02:29.450> on<00:02:29.510> ball<00:02:29.870> hinges<00:02:30.349> so<00:02:30.709> it

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
the shoulders are on ball hinges so it

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:34.119 
the shoulders are on ball hinges so it
swivels<00:02:31.310> and<00:02:31.519> has<00:02:31.879> a<00:02:31.910> hinge<00:02:32.269> on<00:02:32.450> it<00:02:32.860> it's<00:02:33.860> kind

00:02:34.119 --> 00:02:34.129 
swivels and has a hinge on it it's kind

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:35.350 
swivels and has a hinge on it it's kind
of<00:02:34.160> a<00:02:34.250> reverse<00:02:34.430> ball<00:02:34.819> hinge<00:02:35.090> but<00:02:35.209> it's

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
of a reverse ball hinge but it's

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.789 
of a reverse ball hinge but it's
effectively<00:02:35.750> the<00:02:35.870> same<00:02:36.140> thing<00:02:36.379> you<00:02:36.500> can<00:02:36.530> see

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
effectively the same thing you can see

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.140 
effectively the same thing you can see
the<00:02:36.920> hinge<00:02:37.099> part<00:02:37.250> on<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> outside<00:02:37.549> rather

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
the hinge part on the outside rather

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.250 
the hinge part on the outside rather
than<00:02:38.360> the<00:02:38.569> inside

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:39.260 
than the inside

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.020 
than the inside
and<00:02:39.590> then<00:02:39.680> there's<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> bicep<00:02:40.489> swivel<00:02:40.940> and

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
and then there's the bicep swivel and

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.270 
and then there's the bicep swivel and
then<00:02:41.150> the<00:02:41.360> shoulder<00:02:41.599> itself<00:02:42.019> will<00:02:42.260> rotate<00:02:42.470> but

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
then the shoulder itself will rotate but

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.309 
then the shoulder itself will rotate but
mine<00:02:43.459> are<00:02:43.489> both<00:02:43.790> stuck<00:02:44.209> on<00:02:44.420> each<00:02:44.690> side<00:02:45.019> so<00:02:45.290> I

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
mine are both stuck on each side so I

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.410 
mine are both stuck on each side so I
can't<00:02:45.590> show<00:02:45.650> you<00:02:45.829> the<00:02:46.579> elbows<00:02:46.849> have<00:02:47.000> a<00:02:47.030> single

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
can't show you the elbows have a single

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.880 
can't show you the elbows have a single
hinge<00:02:47.629> but<00:02:47.780> you<00:02:47.840> get<00:02:47.989> just<00:02:48.019> about<00:02:48.410> 90<00:02:48.769> degrees

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890 
hinge but you get just about 90 degrees

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.270 
hinge but you get just about 90 degrees
so<00:02:49.430> that's<00:02:49.549> fine<00:02:49.819> with<00:02:50.000> me<00:02:50.030> the<00:02:50.750> wrists<00:02:51.140> are

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
so that's fine with me the wrists are

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:54.220 
so that's fine with me the wrists are
using<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.430> tiny<00:02:52.790> little<00:02:52.940> ball<00:02:53.329> peg<00:02:53.629> still<00:02:53.959> I

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
using that tiny little ball peg still I

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.110 
using that tiny little ball peg still I
don't<00:02:54.709> care<00:02:54.920> for<00:02:54.950> that<00:02:55.220> it's<00:02:55.430> super<00:02:55.849> fragile

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:56.120 
don't care for that it's super fragile

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.630 
don't care for that it's super fragile
and<00:02:56.599> if<00:02:56.780> it<00:02:56.900> gets<00:02:57.079> stuck<00:02:57.260> like<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.620> is<00:02:57.739> now<00:02:57.950> it's

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
and if it gets stuck like it is now it's

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.059 
and if it gets stuck like it is now it's
very<00:02:59.090> very<00:02:59.540> easy<00:02:59.840> to<00:03:00.079> break<00:03:00.260> this<00:03:00.590> one<00:03:00.769> is<00:03:00.920> not

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
very very easy to break this one is not

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.240 
very very easy to break this one is not
stuck<00:03:01.400> luckily<00:03:01.879> though<00:03:02.090> so<00:03:02.269> I<00:03:02.299> can<00:03:02.329> show<00:03:02.660> you

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
stuck luckily though so I can show you

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.789 
stuck luckily though so I can show you
the<00:03:04.250> fingers<00:03:04.819> are<00:03:05.120> hinged<00:03:05.480> that's<00:03:06.019> an<00:03:06.200> upgrade

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
the fingers are hinged that's an upgrade

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.069 
the fingers are hinged that's an upgrade
to<00:03:07.340> the<00:03:07.459> original<00:03:07.879> elite<00:03:08.180> mold<00:03:08.450> the<00:03:08.930> other

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
to the original elite mold the other

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:11.710 
to the original elite mold the other
ones<00:03:09.260> didn't<00:03:09.530> have<00:03:09.620> a<00:03:09.650> hinge<00:03:09.980> these<00:03:10.849> do<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:11.599> you

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:11.720 
ones didn't have a hinge these do so you

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.930 
ones didn't have a hinge these do so you
have<00:03:11.900> no<00:03:12.140> trouble<00:03:12.470> at<00:03:12.739> all<00:03:12.769> having<00:03:13.489> them<00:03:13.760> hold

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:13.940 
have no trouble at all having them hold

have no trouble at all having them hold
their<00:03:14.150> accessories<00:03:14.750> and<00:03:15.019> it's<00:03:15.560> a<00:03:15.620> pretty<00:03:15.890> good

there's<00:03:36.470> also<00:03:36.709> a<00:03:36.919> little<00:03:37.190> bit<00:03:37.340> of<00:03:37.549> a<00:03:37.609> hinge<00:03:37.880> in

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:38.060 
there's also a little bit of a hinge in

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.330 
there's also a little bit of a hinge in
there<00:03:38.329> so<00:03:38.780> pretty<00:03:39.620> good<00:03:39.709> range<00:03:40.069> of<00:03:40.190> motion

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
there so pretty good range of motion

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.280 
there so pretty good range of motion
anything<00:03:40.970> you<00:03:41.060> need<00:03:41.209> to<00:03:41.299> do<00:03:41.480> you'll<00:03:41.959> be<00:03:42.169> able

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
anything you need to do you'll be able

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.319 
anything you need to do you'll be able
to<00:03:42.709> do<00:03:42.950> so<00:03:43.340> that's<00:03:43.519> fine<00:03:43.730> by<00:03:43.910> me

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
to do so that's fine by me

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.180 
to do so that's fine by me
he's<00:03:44.840> got<00:03:45.049> the<00:03:45.169> bulkier<00:03:45.560> knees<00:03:45.859> which

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:46.190 
he's got the bulkier knees which

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.250 
he's got the bulkier knees which
technically<00:03:46.819> the<00:03:47.299> arbiter<00:03:47.660> should<00:03:47.900> have<00:03:48.019> had

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
technically the arbiter should have had

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:50.289 
technically the arbiter should have had
the<00:03:48.889> arbiter<00:03:49.220> should<00:03:49.430> be<00:03:49.579> at<00:03:49.700> least<00:03:49.849> the<00:03:50.120> same

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:50.299 
the arbiter should be at least the same

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.270 
the arbiter should be at least the same
build<00:03:50.569> if<00:03:50.690> not<00:03:50.900> bigger<00:03:51.079> than<00:03:51.230> these<00:03:51.680> guys<00:03:51.980> and

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
build if not bigger than these guys and

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.559 
build if not bigger than these guys and

what's up with that

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:56.409 
what's up with that
