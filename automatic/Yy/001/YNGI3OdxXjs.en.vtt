of<00:01:45.650> worrying<00:01:45.950> how<00:01:46.250> many<00:01:46.520> how<00:01:46.940> many<00:01:47.000> meals<00:01:47.690> you

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:47.900 
of worrying how many how many meals you

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.510 
of worrying how many how many meals you
should<00:01:48.050> be<00:01:48.110> having<00:01:48.260> and<00:01:48.530> folks<00:01:49.100> you're<00:01:49.370> not

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
should be having and folks you're not

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.070 
should be having and folks you're not
not<00:01:49.940> slowing<00:01:50.180> down<00:01:50.210> the<00:01:50.479> metal<00:01:50.750> body<00:01:50.870> right

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:51.080 
not slowing down the metal body right

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.230 
not slowing down the metal body right
rather<00:01:51.440> speed<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.159> up<00:01:52.250> like<00:01:52.610> said<00:01:52.820> don't<00:01:53.180> worry

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
rather speed it up like said don't worry

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.820 
rather speed it up like said don't worry
about<00:01:53.330> how<00:01:53.540> many<00:01:53.720> meals<00:01:53.900> you<00:01:54.080> have<00:01:54.229> or<00:01:54.590> the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:54.830 
about how many meals you have or the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.710 
about how many meals you have or the
speed<00:01:55.130> it<00:01:55.280> up<00:01:55.370> or<00:01:55.550> being<00:01:56.000> more<00:01:56.150> active<00:01:56.300> during

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
speed it up or being more active during

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.140 
speed it up or being more active during
the<00:01:56.840> day<00:01:56.930> right<00:01:57.590> and<00:01:57.799> in<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.130> way<00:01:58.460> releasing

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.150 
the day right and in that way releasing

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:00.670 
the day right and in that way releasing
the<00:01:59.210> right<00:01:59.390> hormones<00:01:59.870> to<00:02:00.080> actually<00:02:00.320> burn<00:02:00.470> or

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
the right hormones to actually burn or

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.250 
the right hormones to actually burn or
fats<00:02:01.090> it's<00:02:02.090> like<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.299> said<00:02:02.479> most<00:02:02.960> of<00:02:03.140> your

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
fats it's like I said most of your

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.010 
fats it's like I said most of your
calorie<00:02:03.620> deficit<00:02:04.159> should<00:02:05.060> come<00:02:05.299> from<00:02:05.479> being

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
calorie deficit should come from being

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.719 
calorie deficit should come from being
more<00:02:06.200> active<00:02:06.320> during<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.830> day<00:02:07.010> so<00:02:07.460> the<00:02:07.580> more

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
more active during the day so the more

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:09.279 
more active during the day so the more
active<00:02:07.880> you<00:02:08.060> are<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.599> more<00:02:08.780> calories<00:02:08.990> you

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:09.289 
active you are the more calories you

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:10.809 
active you are the more calories you
burn<00:02:09.500> because<00:02:10.160> what's<00:02:10.340> going<00:02:10.459> to<00:02:10.520> happen<00:02:10.729> is

00:02:10.809 --> 00:02:10.819 
burn because what's going to happen is

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:12.730 
burn because what's going to happen is
if<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.060> decrease<00:02:11.660> your<00:02:11.780> calories

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
if you decrease your calories

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:15.280 
if you decrease your calories
buell<00:02:12.980> if<00:02:13.370> your<00:02:13.610> daily<00:02:14.420> intake<00:02:14.450> should<00:02:14.960> be<00:02:15.110> two

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
buell if your daily intake should be two

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.880 
buell if your daily intake should be two
thousand<00:02:15.800> and<00:02:15.890> you<00:02:16.010> bring<00:02:16.250> it<00:02:16.370> down<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.970> 1,500

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
thousand and you bring it down to 1,500

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
thousand and you bring it down to 1,500
1300<00:02:18.890> you're<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.400> going<00:02:19.580> to<00:02:19.640> start<00:02:19.820> getting

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:19.910 
1300 you're just going to start getting

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:21.910 
1300 you're just going to start getting
hungry<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.570> that's<00:02:20.990> when<00:02:21.200> you<00:02:21.260> start<00:02:21.530> slowing

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
hungry and that's when you start slowing

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.560 
hungry and that's when you start slowing
down<00:02:22.100> your<00:02:22.280> metabolic<00:02:22.550> rate<00:02:22.820> so<00:02:23.360> you're<00:02:23.480> going

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
down your metabolic rate so you're going

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.330 
down your metabolic rate so you're going
to<00:02:23.660> eat<00:02:23.720> pretty<00:02:24.500> close<00:02:24.830> to<00:02:25.070> what<00:02:25.190> your

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
to eat pretty close to what your

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.610 
to eat pretty close to what your
metabolic<00:02:25.580> rate<00:02:25.850> is<00:02:26.180> except<00:02:26.900> maybe<00:02:27.080> drop<00:02:27.440> it

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 
metabolic rate is except maybe drop it

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.570 
metabolic rate is except maybe drop it
maybe<00:02:28.250> by<00:02:28.490> 200<00:02:29.060> 300<00:02:29.330> calories<00:02:29.870> and<00:02:30.080> then<00:02:30.590> burn

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:31.580 
maybe by 200 300 calories and then burn

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.400 
maybe by 200 300 calories and then burn
off<00:02:31.760> a<00:02:31.910> hell<00:02:32.210> of<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.360> lot<00:02:32.480> more<00:02:32.510> calories<00:02:33.050> by

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
off a hell of a lot more calories by

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:34.840 
off a hell of a lot more calories by
being<00:02:33.650> more<00:02:33.800> active<00:02:33.980> during<00:02:34.340> the<00:02:34.430> day<00:02:34.610> and

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:34.850 
being more active during the day and

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:36.940 
being more active during the day and
doing<00:02:35.210> the<00:02:35.330> right<00:02:35.540> metabolic<00:02:36.470> type<00:02:36.680> training

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
doing the right metabolic type training

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.870 
doing the right metabolic type training
all<00:02:37.460> right<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:38.230> supplements<00:02:39.230> not<00:02:40.070> really<00:02:40.400> not

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:40.880 
all right so supplements not really not

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.980 
all right so supplements not really not
really<00:02:40.940> an<00:02:41.210> issue<00:02:41.330> shouldn't<00:02:41.810> really<00:02:41.900> be

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:41.990 
really an issue shouldn't really be

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:44.700 
really an issue shouldn't really be
using<00:02:42.350> them<00:02:42.470> they<00:02:42.590> don't<00:02:42.710> work<00:02:42.980> in<00:02:43.910> my<00:02:44.120> opinion

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:44.710 
using them they don't work in my opinion

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:48.610 
using them they don't work in my opinion
meals<00:02:45.710> how<00:02:46.220> many<00:02:47.020> doesn't<00:02:48.020> really<00:02:48.140> matter<00:02:48.350> I'd

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:48.620 
meals how many doesn't really matter I'd

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.490 
meals how many doesn't really matter I'd
recommend<00:02:48.980> three<00:02:49.790> day<00:02:50.120> makes<00:02:50.930> a<00:02:51.050> lot<00:02:51.200> lot

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:51.500 
recommend three day makes a lot lot

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.370 
recommend three day makes a lot lot
easier<00:02:51.740> if<00:02:52.100> you<00:02:52.370> can<00:02:52.640> eat<00:02:52.910> four<00:02:53.180> five<00:02:53.480> six<00:02:53.900> six

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:54.380 
easier if you can eat four five six six

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.050 
easier if you can eat four five six six
a<00:02:54.530> day<00:02:54.680> that's<00:02:54.920> that's<00:02:55.310> totally<00:02:55.760> up<00:02:55.850> to<00:02:56.000> you

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
a day that's that's totally up to you

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.570 
a day that's that's totally up to you
and<00:02:56.390> we<00:02:56.870> said<00:02:57.050> be<00:02:57.500> it<00:02:57.560> up<00:02:57.680> and<00:02:57.830> work<00:02:57.980> to<00:02:58.190> do<00:02:58.400> more

00:02:58.570 --> 00:02:58.580 
and we said be it up and work to do more

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.180 
and we said be it up and work to do more
metabolic<00:02:59.330> type<00:03:00.050> training<00:03:00.320> that's<00:03:00.950> going<00:03:01.100> to

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
metabolic type training that's going to

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.920 
metabolic type training that's going to
help<00:03:01.280> release<00:03:01.610> the<00:03:01.820> right<00:03:01.970> hormones<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.750> burn

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:02.930 
help release the right hormones to burn

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.290 
help release the right hormones to burn
off<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.590> fats<00:03:03.860> right<00:03:04.340> instead<00:03:04.970> of<00:03:05.030> worrying

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
off the fats right instead of worrying

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.090 
off the fats right instead of worrying
about<00:03:05.570> how<00:03:06.110> many<00:03:06.290> meals<00:03:06.500> I<00:03:06.680> should<00:03:06.860> be<00:03:06.950> having

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:07.100 
about how many meals I should be having

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:09.490 
about how many meals I should be having
the<00:03:07.610> actual<00:03:07.730> food<00:03:08.090> intake<00:03:08.540> themselves<00:03:09.110> each

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
the actual food intake themselves each

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.950 
the actual food intake themselves each
meal<00:03:09.950> should<00:03:09.980> contain<00:03:10.940> a<00:03:11.000> protein<00:03:11.600> right

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
meal should contain a protein right

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:14.560 
meal should contain a protein right
that's<00:03:12.530> just<00:03:12.740> going<00:03:12.830> to<00:03:12.950> help<00:03:13.130> increase<00:03:14.000> your

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:14.570 
that's just going to help increase your

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.230 
that's just going to help increase your
the<00:03:14.930> thermic<00:03:15.290> effect<00:03:15.410> all<00:03:16.040> right<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.400> it's

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:17.240 
the thermic effect all right and it's

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.760 
the thermic effect all right and it's
difficult<00:03:17.870> for<00:03:17.960> the<00:03:18.080> body<00:03:18.260> to<00:03:18.320> burn<00:03:18.560> off

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:18.770 
difficult for the body to burn off

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.130 
difficult for the body to burn off
proteins<00:03:19.280> or<00:03:19.610> digest<00:03:20.120> proteins<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:20.960> way

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
proteins or digest proteins and that way

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.540 
proteins or digest proteins and that way
you<00:03:21.200> can<00:03:21.350> increase<00:03:21.590> your<00:03:21.710> metabolic<00:03:21.950> rate<00:03:22.340> a

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
you can increase your metabolic rate a

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.640 
you can increase your metabolic rate a
little<00:03:22.760> bit<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.420> a<00:03:23.450> lot<00:03:23.540> but<00:03:24.200> every<00:03:24.470> meal

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
little bit not a lot but every meal

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.680 
little bit not a lot but every meal
should<00:03:24.980> have<00:03:25.190> a<00:03:25.220> protein<00:03:25.700> in<00:03:25.880> because<00:03:26.570> you're

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
should have a protein in because you're

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:27.760 
should have a protein in because you're
also<00:03:26.810> going<00:03:26.960> to<00:03:27.020> be<00:03:27.140> up<00:03:27.260> in<00:03:27.380> your<00:03:27.440> training

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:27.770 
also going to be up in your training

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.700 
also going to be up in your training
right<00:03:28.490> you<00:03:28.820> need<00:03:29.090> that<00:03:29.450> extra<00:03:29.780> amino<00:03:30.050> acids<00:03:30.560> to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
right you need that extra amino acids to

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.920 
right you need that extra amino acids to
actually<00:03:31.040> rebuild<00:03:31.700> rebuild<00:03:32.180> the<00:03:32.450> muscle<00:03:32.780> so

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
actually rebuild rebuild the muscle so

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:35.850 
actually rebuild rebuild the muscle so
with<00:03:33.380> every<00:03:33.620> meal<00:03:33.800> you<00:03:34.310> should<00:03:34.550> be<00:03:34.640> having<00:03:34.850> a

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
with every meal you should be having a

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.240 
with every meal you should be having a
protein<00:03:37.390> carbs<00:03:38.390> we<00:03:38.870> try<00:03:39.080> and<00:03:39.140> cut<00:03:39.470> out<00:03:39.680> most

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
protein carbs we try and cut out most

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.190 
protein carbs we try and cut out most
carbs<00:03:40.730> or<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.300> bad<00:03:41.480> ones<00:03:42.400> breads<00:03:43.480> pastas<00:03:44.480> rice

potatoes<00:03:46.100> you<00:03:46.250> try<00:03:46.460> and<00:03:46.550> cut<00:03:46.670> that<00:03:46.700> it<00:03:46.910> and<00:03:47.240> we

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
potatoes you try and cut that it and we

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.950 
potatoes you try and cut that it and we
try<00:03:48.140> and<00:03:48.200> get<00:03:48.320> most<00:03:48.530> of<00:03:48.650> our<00:03:48.740> carbs<00:03:49.190> from

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:49.960 
try and get most of our carbs from

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.370 
try and get most of our carbs from
vegetables<00:03:50.960> fruit<00:03:52.150> which<00:03:53.150> is<00:03:53.330> a<00:03:53.360> sugar<00:03:53.750> we<00:03:54.140> try

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:54.380 
vegetables fruit which is a sugar we try

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:56.590 
vegetables fruit which is a sugar we try
and<00:03:54.440> limit<00:03:54.770> as<00:03:55.070> well<00:03:55.460> so<00:03:55.580> you<00:03:55.640> cut<00:03:55.850> out<00:03:55.880> all<00:03:56.060> or

00:03:56.590 --> 00:03:56.600 
and limit as well so you cut out all or

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:00.190 
and limit as well so you cut out all or
sugars<00:03:57.260> right<00:03:57.800> and<00:03:58.670> fruit<00:03:59.120> we<00:03:59.630> try<00:03:59.870> and<00:03:59.990> limit

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:00.200 
sugars right and fruit we try and limit

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.900 
sugars right and fruit we try and limit
as<00:04:00.470> well<00:04:00.740> if<00:04:01.100> you're<00:04:01.280> going<00:04:01.490> to<00:04:01.550> have<00:04:01.670> fruits

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
as well if you're going to have fruits

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.790 
as well if you're going to have fruits
have<00:04:02.120> that<00:04:02.300> earlier<00:04:02.660> on<00:04:02.780> in<00:04:02.930> the<00:04:03.020> day<00:04:03.380> so<00:04:03.590> you

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
have that earlier on in the day so you

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:05.020 
have that earlier on in the day so you
can<00:04:03.830> actually<00:04:04.070> have<00:04:04.310> the<00:04:04.430> rest<00:04:04.670> of<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:04.820> day<00:04:05.000> to

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
can actually have the rest of the day to

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.570 
can actually have the rest of the day to
burn<00:04:05.360> it<00:04:05.510> off<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.620> carbs<00:04:07.070> we<00:04:07.160> trying<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.430> cut

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
burn it off so carbs we trying to cut

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.640 
burn it off so carbs we trying to cut
out<00:04:07.790> we<00:04:08.480> said<00:04:08.690> have<00:04:08.840> loads<00:04:09.080> of<00:04:09.170> proteins

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650 
out we said have loads of proteins

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:12.850 
out we said have loads of proteins
fruits<00:04:10.510> we<00:04:11.510> limit<00:04:12.110> a<00:04:12.200> little<00:04:12.380> bit<00:04:12.470> if<00:04:12.620> you<00:04:12.709> are

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:38.850 
those old fat loss formula is water I

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.030 
those old fat loss formula is water I
took<00:04:39.240> body<00:04:39.630> needs<00:04:39.900> water<00:04:40.169> for<00:04:40.470> every<00:04:40.800> single

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
took body needs water for every single

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.820

process fat burning your body doesn't

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.890 
process fat burning your body doesn't
regard<00:04:44.100> that<00:04:44.250> as<00:04:44.430> an<00:04:44.669> important<00:04:45.120> process<00:04:45.270> so

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:45.900 
regard that as an important process so

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:47.180 
regard that as an important process so
if<00:04:45.990> you<00:04:46.050> aren't<00:04:46.350> getting<00:04:46.500> in<00:04:46.800> enough<00:04:47.160> water

if you aren't getting in enough water
your<00:04:48.150> body<00:04:48.360> will<00:04:48.480> actually<00:04:48.780> limit<00:04:49.110> the<00:04:49.350> amount

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:49.410

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.680 
your body will actually limit the amount
of<00:04:49.710> fat<00:04:49.919> you're<00:04:50.100> burning<00:04:50.370> so<00:04:50.730> if<00:04:51.300> you<00:04:51.480> want<00:04:51.630> to

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
of fat you're burning so if you want to

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.480 
of fat you're burning so if you want to
be<00:04:51.750> healthy<00:04:52.169> your<00:04:52.410> training<00:04:52.740> order<00:04:53.190> you<00:04:53.400> want

to have to take extra water and it's

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:02.750 
to have to take extra water and it's
going<00:05:01.950> to<00:05:02.010> sound<00:05:02.190> a<00:05:02.280> little<00:05:02.370> bit<00:05:02.520> ridiculous

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
going to sound a little bit ridiculous

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.280 
going to sound a little bit ridiculous
but<00:05:03.090> you<00:05:03.360> need<00:05:03.510> to<00:05:03.630> be<00:05:03.660> drinking<00:05:03.810> at<00:05:04.110> least

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:04.290 
but you need to be drinking at least

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.010 
but you need to be drinking at least
three<00:05:04.650> to<00:05:04.830> four<00:05:04.860> liters<00:05:05.460> a<00:05:05.490> day<00:05:05.660> initially<00:05:06.660> you

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
three to four liters a day initially you

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.720 
three to four liters a day initially you
might<00:05:07.200> be<00:05:07.500> a<00:05:07.530> little<00:05:07.680> bit<00:05:07.830> more<00:05:07.980> okay<00:05:08.430> but<00:05:08.490> your

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:08.730 
might be a little bit more okay but your
