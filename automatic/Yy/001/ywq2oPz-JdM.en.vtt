 Dr 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.200
 the VfB seemed 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:18.220
 Hello and welcome to Dubai Europe again

 and visitors are bothering the match for a long time and I have my kopp for him 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.720
 packed the NDF but who knows the class to hold my favorite class 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.810
 From now on I call her lovingly the construction work altar 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:31.229
 very loving for me 

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:34.550
 and the only euro the only difference of everyone I know though 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.649
 already on the 5d after § on the 5 the Capitol held 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.040
 Terry ends up here and many of you ever since 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 represent 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.820
 Commander Dobert Modern Warfare 2 brings why is the Black Ops 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.040
 quite simply there have been many changes in the last two days both yes 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.370
 what changes to this I come now Mayerhoffer 2 is yes 

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:56.010
 momentarily accept »rarity 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.670
 on my channel I play games more so often more confident of the modern 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.570
 Warfare 2 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:02.100
 because I like this game of the 8th 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.800
 and I would like to have this Modern Warfare 2 GB that also comes with a gt 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.610
 betrayed for me 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 Say German is in kumite like and GM 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.470
 But I have and the relationship should be the weekend Saturday Sunday 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:18.250
 in Kassel spent their song contest on YouTube 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:22.380
 and came up with an idea Kathleen had the value of the homecoming on the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:23.990
 12 currently 3 o'clock 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.079
 and as I've been here for hours now at home 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:30.720
 this is Valley 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.600
 I just have to put this idea out of Horgen's way 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.160
 because the resourceful idea just awesome 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.890
 but first I come to it 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:42.250
 what was the hill or congresses that was what the SAV was all about 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:43.650
 in addition a few infos 

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.440
 the whole was launched from the video 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:48.700
 and cooperation with the European Championships in Salzburg 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.179
 and it looked like that was going to give the topic specifically 

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.429
 it was nice player there were really many YouTube place 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:58.530
 So it's mostly YouTube creators 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.479
 but it was on one side but if we just got some information 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.710
 wanted to have 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.970
 maybe also for the construction of their channel 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.139
 they were smaller over medium and large 

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:10.709
 So it was really a colorful mix 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.929
 Portfolio of commentators 

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.929
 Percent many one at any people 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.349
 St cool ideas came up 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:24.430
 and finally, all the lectures that were held there were for 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.540
 the YouTube and the theme how can I succeed on YouTube the US Open 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:29.339
 not so 

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:31.909
 in the end so what can I draw from it 

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:34.699
 It was pretty cool but I have to say 

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:37.699
 I think that so few people have achieved this 

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:43.159
 The whole topic of how to succeed is YouTube's most commonplace 

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:47.109
 but a topic is what interests a lot more people and what also 

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:49.699
 should be treated in more detail 

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:53.469
 and also just a bit up the sausage networks or the 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:57.199
 will these cooperations be very interesting 

00:02:57.199 --> 00:03:00.109
 and right there is a point where I want to start 

00:03:00.109 --> 00:03:02.569
 and that can be next to Bernd the car ride the shared flat 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:06.259
 I would like to launch a new action a new project 

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:09.659
 and this project will be called your career on YouTube 

00:03:10.199 --> 00:03:13.659
 and it starts so that in the next video will introduce first 

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:16.249
 what did you have the whole thing intertwined 

00:03:16.249 --> 00:03:19.249
 cheap is here everything is yet to come 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:23.060
 that will threaten again at the moment 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:26.130
 I'll tell you something like that a little bit so it's gonna be like that 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.959
 start that really with 0 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:32.519
 Subscribers with not even a channel will start holding it now 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.549
 my email address you are first in the channel 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:37.619
 but we need it clearly 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:41.439
 Of course it's okay now we come to the legal side just like that 

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:42.400
 take a picture 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.939
 and if so what images define which images do not take by the 

00:03:45.939 --> 00:03:49.959
 I do not want to explain that the manufacturer's I'll be you too 

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:51.769
 To provide people 

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:55.249
 previously China Bartha could now create your own 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.959
 personal avatar 

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.849
 and from it a very big coup 

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:02.749
 this project would hinder and because the cooperation 

00:04:02.749 --> 00:04:06.569
 If there are people out there, the channel enemas now give them the avatars 

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:07.450
 consolation 

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.260
 and I do not know what to do 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.639
 actually no limits 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:16.659
 you are all challenged and you have the ability to call profiles 

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:18.590
 to generate back respectively 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.870
 who start multiple projects 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.780
 At first I can not handle my vision the way I am 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:24.699
 imagine 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:28.919
 I'm catching up with the channel's two subscribers yet not mine 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:31.779
 Start that means what is the most important 

00:04:31.779 --> 00:04:32.680
 first time 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.289
 I want to do that better per child 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.729
 then profits and creating a Corner which is not very important for names 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.610
 you do not stand on your feet etc 

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.990
 XXXL Act yourself 34 4 53% Aldi 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.570
 no pig works 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:51.710
 has no recognition value is shit you do not need to talk about it 

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:56.129
 "We have to talk about it because that's how many points 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.210
 which you may be successful at then 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.380
 and he asked why no one finds me there are other things i will 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:07.319
 Discuss things such as search terms 

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:10.819
 how can I not attract several people without me now? 

00:05:10.819 --> 00:05:13.289
 somewhere advertising has to be around 

00:05:13.289 --> 00:05:15.529
 What do I have to do? What do I have to do? 

00:05:15.529 --> 00:05:19.699
 and that's just the task I set for myself and really 

00:05:20.229 --> 00:05:22.089
 from the beginning to the end 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.979
 to accompany unending end 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.090
 that means I will always deliver videos to you 

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:32.729
 on the topic on the topic on the subject really properly designed 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:35.729
 maybe also a cooperation with other people 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:40.800
 that this is going to be a really big part of the network that is 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:41.830
 my dream 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:45.770
 and that we all move a little bit closer together and more 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.029
 work together 

00:05:47.029 --> 00:05:49.870
 I think that's really cool, I'm really up for it 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.780
 and I always like that a bit like the poll from you 

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:55.800
 I know how to find the idea 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:58.219
 do you think that it is interesting for you? 

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:02.960
 and I've got to operate the FIA ​​at the moment and therefore it has to be for 

00:06:02.959 --> 00:06:04.080
 you interesting 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.589
 it will look like that too 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:07.729
 that the whole thing will be arranged wait 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:10.839
 it really should go so far that there is Zoff partnership 

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.629
 maybe even beyond the partnership, what can you do? 

00:06:13.629 --> 00:06:17.889
 From this generated on a youtube channel Wiedemann contact on with the wenger elf 

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.729
 Sponsors should look like the whole looks like a search if I 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.429
 I have to bring partners to the lawyer MusicStorm where I have to pay 

00:06:26.429 --> 00:06:29.919
 I sign up all these questions gradually bit by bit 

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:31.789
 always answered further 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:32.930
 that possible 

00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:36.419
 if you follow this channel and here with this Squad Pack 

00:06:37.839 --> 00:06:39.379
 also works together 

00:06:39.379 --> 00:06:43.439
 of course, the album questions will be answered as well 

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:47.099
 Questions classic question Alina Bondar best on what programs clearly 

00:06:47.099 --> 00:06:49.490
 Minutes where do I get the programs out 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.490
 I will answer all these questions and that will be the project 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.309
 become 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:58.469
 Duration in there is no teacher on YouTube 

00:06:58.469 --> 00:07:01.849
 and the whole will of course have several episodes even very many episodes 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.159
 how the whole thing will look exactly speak to the complete structure 

00:07:07.159 --> 00:07:10.869
 Since I want to sit down now, the whole thing will work out that he is 

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:15.090
 is its a lot of time we won 19 2 is my stats answered 

00:07:15.089 --> 00:07:17.810
 formed the video question that everyone finds this idea 

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:19.949
 and I say goodbye with a good shot 

00:07:19.949 --> 00:07:21.839
 this year Commander Krieger until next time
