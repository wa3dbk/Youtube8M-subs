00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.070
 It's amazing, it's getting more and more 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.200
 pretty is very different from 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.760
 in the old days 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.760
 It's really very beautiful. 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.160
 I spent almost five years in this locker room 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.670
 huh 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:06.480
 then the 6010 path is very 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:16.220
 modified if the owner is 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:21.330
 known to us that's cool you understand 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.479
 It will be too beautiful, it's the changing rooms. 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:26.190
 is not back here then in the South theory 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:30.990
 and players will come in here then 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:33.530
 to access the field will be much more 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.530
 very good 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:48.280
 I will played at the time after 30 BC 

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:52.119
 left for Italy and the memory is 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.680
 very big and he would be here too 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.649
 very excited, huh? 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.619
 in this transformation here the people 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:01.930
 is on sale today is a reality 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:03.880
 happening last year we still 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:07.659
 I was very early, I did not see anything. 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.810
 physical so it was hard for anyone who is not 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:13.959
 engineering 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:21.450
 now today it is now a 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:21.450
 very beautiful reality 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.080
 between quotation marks bertrand his mother things 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.080
 I think it was here was the right or 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.070
 changed in another office, right? 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.980
 opa state I know of the license 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:48.040
 what's up young 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:51.590
 there are here 

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:55.910
 really here I know myself well 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:58.489
 It is today in this straight part here 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:02.150
 placing the upper beam that is of the 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:04.370
 coverage of the stadium does not have all this 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:09.799
 very large alloy support structure 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:12.920
 a very delicate job at the time and a 

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:15.290
 difficult phase of the work is already being 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.480
 and we do not see the time to 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:21.349
 Start this, yes, lawn. 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:25.630
 planted and take care that there 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:25.630
 Will you come, will you stay? Forever. 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.299
 changed a lot 

00:03:38.349 --> 00:03:42.299
 the last time we were here it's already 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.959
 well advanced 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:50.580
 We look forward to seeing this here. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:55.540
 ready with the grass that blue whiting 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:58.530
 illogically crowded is what matters most 

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.530
 at the moment like this 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:05.120
 angola jorge 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:34.140
 any position here in the middle of the field 

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:37.260
 any position in the stadium shall not be 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.450
 there is a blind spot where we feel more 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.710
 We've already been up there behind the goal 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.160
 here on the curve 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.030
 the view is fantastic any place here 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:50.100
 in the stadium will be to have a very 

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:54.530
 Good. I intend to stay here in the middle. 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.530
 because I like to have the overview is 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:11.380
 is quite different from the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.380
 end of last mile 

00:05:15.639 --> 00:05:22.539
 I followed right that all that 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.330
 beginning of works being destroyed being 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:29.169
 demolished and suddenly now we come 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.050
 for another stage, see that 

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:34.900
 really is having a very change 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:38.919
 pretty much good then that to me I 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:41.919
 I think it's a local still not right 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:45.099
 things have changed they have become more beautiful 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:49.930
 but this continues to be a work 

00:05:45.099 --> 00:05:52.000
 that messes with anyone is I had to 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.029
 opportunity to live there in the countryside 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.719
 and I did not have the opportunity to see that I won 

00:05:55.029 --> 00:06:02.379
 the fans here from the outside but 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:05.409
 I'm changing this a little bit here 

00:06:02.379 --> 00:06:08.919
 remains a magical place, right? 

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.930
 the palm trees is still going to continue 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:15.419
 Growing more and more because this here 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.419
 will make the palm trees even bigger
