so<00:01:26.630> far<00:01:26.870> you've<00:01:27.020> seen<00:01:27.050> power<00:01:27.650> generation

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
so far you've seen power generation

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.770 
so far you've seen power generation
where<00:01:29.750> to<00:01:29.960> hit<00:01:30.170> and<00:01:30.590> how<00:01:31.040> to<00:01:31.100> hit<00:01:31.600> you've<00:01:32.600> also

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:32.780 
where to hit and how to hit you've also

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.320 
where to hit and how to hit you've also
seen<00:01:33.200> what<00:01:33.440> to<00:01:33.560> do<00:01:33.740> as<00:01:34.010> a<00:01:34.070> backup<00:01:34.490> situation

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
seen what to do as a backup situation

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.990 
seen what to do as a backup situation
from<00:01:35.480> when<00:01:35.630> things<00:01:35.840> have<00:01:35.960> gone<00:01:35.990> wrong<00:01:36.380> now

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
from when things have gone wrong now

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.800 
from when things have gone wrong now
what<00:01:38.000> we're<00:01:38.090> going<00:01:38.210> to<00:01:38.240> do<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.480> show<00:01:38.630> you<00:01:38.690> how

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
what we're going to do is show you how

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:40.330 
what we're going to do is show you how
to<00:01:38.870> combine<00:01:39.140> all<00:01:39.560> of<00:01:39.590> those<00:01:39.800> things<00:01:40.130> together

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340 
to combine all of those things together

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.270 
to combine all of those things together
in<00:01:40.760> a<00:01:40.940> more<00:01:41.120> realistic<00:01:41.540> application<00:01:41.960> a<00:01:42.710> little

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
in a more realistic application a little

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.690 
in a more realistic application a little
bit<00:01:43.400> more<00:01:43.580> Street<00:01:44.240> orientated<00:01:45.050> if<00:01:45.170> you<00:01:45.320> will

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
bit more Street orientated if you will

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.730 
bit more Street orientated if you will
okay<00:01:46.700> be<00:01:47.060> careful<00:01:47.270> when<00:01:47.570> you<00:01:47.660> practice<00:01:48.080> it<00:01:48.260> and

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
okay be careful when you practice it and

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.180 
okay be careful when you practice it and
most<00:01:48.920> of<00:01:49.040> all<00:01:49.160> enjoy<00:01:49.400> it<00:01:50.740> okay<00:01:51.740> we're<00:01:51.950> going<00:01:52.100> to

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.190 
most of all enjoy it okay we're going to

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:54.370 
most of all enjoy it okay we're going to
do<00:01:52.310> now<00:01:52.460> is<00:01:52.610> just<00:01:52.820> bring<00:01:53.570> the<00:01:53.810> stuff<00:01:54.020> a<00:01:54.080> little

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:54.380 
do now is just bring the stuff a little

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:56.730 
do now is just bring the stuff a little
bit<00:01:54.500> closer<00:01:54.770> to<00:01:55.130> the<00:01:55.280> screen<00:01:55.550> for<00:01:55.790> a<00:01:55.850> situation

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
bit closer to the screen for a situation

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.990 
bit closer to the screen for a situation
in<00:01:57.740> a<00:01:57.770> gate<00:01:57.979> through<00:01:58.280> some<00:01:58.550> of<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.700> threads

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.000 
in a gate through some of the threads

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.270 
in a gate through some of the threads
that<00:01:59.210> we've<00:01:59.420> done<00:01:59.830> obviously<00:02:00.830> wearing

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:01.280 
that we've done obviously wearing

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.890 
that we've done obviously wearing
different<00:02:01.430> played<00:02:01.850> in<00:02:02.090> so<00:02:02.390> you<00:02:02.479> just<00:02:02.660> need<00:02:02.840> to

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
different played in so you just need to

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.650 
different played in so you just need to
see<00:02:03.200> how<00:02:03.470> weird<00:02:03.770> that<00:02:03.830> what<00:02:04.520> with<00:02:04.700> the<00:02:04.850> make<00:02:05.479> it

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:05.660 
see how weird that what with the make it

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:08.770 
see how weird that what with the make it
work<00:02:05.840> for<00:02:05.990> an<00:02:06.050> everyday<00:02:06.290> situation<00:02:06.440> and<00:02:07.780> we'll

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
work for an everyday situation and we'll

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.860 
work for an everyday situation and we'll
see<00:02:09.020> see<00:02:09.590> how<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.800> goes<00:02:10.330> okay<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:11.480> long<00:02:11.660> in<00:02:11.810> the

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
see see how it goes okay so long in the

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.780 
see see how it goes okay so long in the
days<00:02:12.080> we<00:02:12.260> can<00:02:12.410> go<00:02:12.560> for<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.980> first<00:02:13.220> one<00:02:13.550> that<00:02:13.670> we

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
days we can go for the first one that we

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.330 
days we can go for the first one that we
did<00:02:13.940> before<00:02:14.440> which<00:02:15.440> was<00:02:15.560> a<00:02:15.830> motor<00:02:16.190> so

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:16.340 
did before which was a motor so

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.510 
did before which was a motor so
daguerreotype<00:02:17.060> for<00:02:17.330> a<00:02:17.360> rear<00:02:17.780> leg<00:02:18.350> sweep<00:02:18.740> and

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
daguerreotype for a rear leg sweep and

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.150 
daguerreotype for a rear leg sweep and
and<00:02:19.940> you<00:02:20.480> studied<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.200> we<00:02:21.560> can<00:02:21.709> still<00:02:21.950> do<00:02:22.130> it

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
and you studied that we can still do it

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.440 
and you studied that we can still do it
even<00:02:22.370> though<00:02:22.670> we're<00:02:22.850> not<00:02:22.970> wearing<00:02:23.240> those

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
even though we're not wearing those

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.360 
even though we're not wearing those
funny<00:02:23.720> cover<00:02:24.050> pajamas<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.860> special<00:02:25.220> it'll

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
funny cover pajamas and special it'll

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.370 
funny cover pajamas and special it'll
still<00:02:25.610> work<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:26.540> most<00:02:26.720> important<00:02:27.170> thing

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
still work the most important thing

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.620 
still work the most important thing
again<00:02:27.500> is<00:02:27.680> to<00:02:27.920> under<00:02:28.130> the<00:02:28.220> same<00:02:28.430> principles<00:02:28.670> so

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:29.630 
again is to under the same principles so

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.390 
again is to under the same principles so
to<00:02:29.780> look<00:02:29.989> at<00:02:30.050> the<00:02:30.230> different<00:02:30.590> directions<00:02:30.709> that

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
to look at the different directions that

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.300 
to look at the different directions that
the<00:02:31.940> balance<00:02:32.239> is<00:02:32.330> broken<00:02:32.890> triangle<00:02:33.890> theory<00:02:34.100> it

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
the balance is broken triangle theory it

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:35.680 
the balance is broken triangle theory it
talked<00:02:34.489> about<00:02:34.790> making<00:02:35.060> sure<00:02:35.330> that<00:02:35.540> he's

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
talked about making sure that he's

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:37.600 
talked about making sure that he's
weight<00:02:35.900> going<00:02:36.290> towards<00:02:36.680> the<00:02:36.860> third<00:02:37.100> point<00:02:37.430> of

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
weight going towards the third point of

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.509 
weight going towards the third point of
that<00:02:37.730> triangle<00:02:38.120> size<00:02:38.450> of<00:02:38.630> balance<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.950> what

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:40.519 
that triangle size of balance and what

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:42.790 
that triangle size of balance and what
things<00:02:41.150> like<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:41.600> yin<00:02:41.840> and<00:02:41.959> yang<00:02:42.200> Theory<00:02:42.680> if

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
things like the yin and yang Theory if

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.410 
things like the yin and yang Theory if
you<00:02:42.950> get<00:02:43.160> some<00:02:43.400> of<00:02:43.489> the<00:02:43.580> other<00:02:43.700> bits<00:02:44.030> in<00:02:44.269> the

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:44.420 
you get some of the other bits in the

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.390 
you get some of the other bits in the
series<00:02:44.780> will<00:02:45.019> explain<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.470> bit<00:02:46.070> more<00:02:46.130> about

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:46.400 
series will explain a bit more about

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.910 
series will explain a bit more about
that<00:02:46.610> and<00:02:46.940> and<00:02:47.840> also<00:02:48.019> the<00:02:48.260> pressure<00:02:48.500> points

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
that and and also the pressure points

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.190 
that and and also the pressure points
again<00:02:49.400> if<00:02:49.519> you<00:02:49.670> look<00:02:50.120> in<00:02:50.300> further<00:02:50.810> into<00:02:51.080> the

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:51.200 
again if you look in further into the

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.660 
again if you look in further into the
series<00:02:51.500> you'll<00:02:52.100> find<00:02:52.280> that<00:02:52.430> the<00:02:52.519> pressure

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
series you'll find that the pressure

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.490 
series you'll find that the pressure
points<00:02:53.090> are<00:02:53.269> coming<00:02:53.570> and<00:02:53.810> we<00:02:53.959> can<00:02:54.110> use<00:02:54.260> those

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:54.500 
points are coming and we can use those

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.160 
points are coming and we can use those
as<00:02:54.769> well<00:02:54.800> to<00:02:55.130> help<00:02:55.280> us<00:02:55.690> so<00:02:56.690> he's<00:02:56.840> feeling<00:02:56.959> it

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
as well to help us so he's feeling it

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.810 
as well to help us so he's feeling it
might<00:02:57.410> come<00:02:57.709> in<00:02:57.739> front<00:02:57.980> of<00:02:58.070> me<00:02:58.130> first<00:02:58.430> of<00:02:58.640> all

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
might come in front of me first of all

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.820 
might come in front of me first of all
and<00:02:59.180> then<00:02:59.780> we'll<00:02:59.989> show<00:03:00.170> you<00:03:00.200> a<00:03:00.410> little<00:03:00.560> bit

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
and then we'll show you a little bit

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.250 
and then we'll show you a little bit
more<00:03:01.130> on<00:03:01.250> the<00:03:01.340> move<00:03:01.580> in<00:03:01.730> a<00:03:01.790> minute<00:03:02.090> because<00:03:03.080> he

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
more on the move in a minute because he

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.280 
more on the move in a minute because he
hasn't<00:03:03.410> got<00:03:03.620> his<00:03:04.100> gear<00:03:04.459> on<00:03:05.019> we're<00:03:06.019> not<00:03:06.110> going

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
hasn't got his gear on we're not going

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.950 
hasn't got his gear on we're not going
to<00:03:06.410> take<00:03:06.800> the<00:03:06.980> same<00:03:07.190> sort<00:03:07.489> of<00:03:07.519> position

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:07.960 
to take the same sort of position

we'll<00:05:03.120> come<00:05:03.330> on<00:05:03.419> to<00:05:03.539> doing<00:05:03.779> this<00:05:03.870> in<00:05:04.050> a<00:05:04.110> minute

00:05:04.249 --> 00:05:04.259 
we'll come on to doing this in a minute

00:05:04.259 --> 00:05:06.230 
we'll come on to doing this in a minute
with<00:05:04.559> a<00:05:04.860> bit<00:05:05.039> more<00:05:05.219> speed<00:05:05.490> so<00:05:05.550> you<00:05:05.789> can<00:05:05.909> see<00:05:06.150> it

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
with a bit more speed so you can see it

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:26.730 
with a bit more speed so you can see it
a<00:05:06.300> bit<00:05:06.330> more<00:05:06.539> practically

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:29.680 

okay<00:05:27.740> what<00:05:27.950> we've<00:05:28.040> got<00:05:28.190> there<00:05:28.400> then<00:05:28.610> is<00:05:28.850> just<00:05:29.600> a

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
okay what we've got there then is just a

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:32.380 
okay what we've got there then is just a
safe<00:05:29.900> way<00:05:30.170> that<00:05:30.380> I<00:05:30.410> think<00:05:30.620> before<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:31.580> mean<00:05:32.210> that

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:32.390 
safe way that I think before I mean that

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.390 
safe way that I think before I mean that
Andy<00:05:32.990> is<00:05:33.020> the<00:05:33.260> aggressors<00:05:33.740> doing<00:05:34.010> it<00:05:34.130> to<00:05:34.250> me

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
Andy is the aggressors doing it to me

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:36.910 
Andy is the aggressors doing it to me
first<00:05:34.670> of<00:05:34.880> all<00:05:35.030> again<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.960> just<00:05:35.990> comes<00:05:36.350> down<00:05:36.470> to

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:36.920 
first of all again it just comes down to

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:39.900 
first of all again it just comes down to
speed<00:05:37.130> timing<00:05:38.000> getting<00:05:38.960> the<00:05:39.020> distance<00:05:39.350> right

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
speed timing getting the distance right

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.860 
speed timing getting the distance right
accenting<00:05:40.910> the<00:05:41.060> third<00:05:41.300> point<00:05:41.570> of<00:05:41.780> that

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:41.870 
accenting the third point of that

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:43.450 
accenting the third point of that
triangle<00:05:42.260> that<00:05:42.440> we<00:05:42.530> keep<00:05:42.680> going<00:05:42.860> on<00:05:43.070> about<00:05:43.130> all

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
triangle that we keep going on about all

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:45.160 
triangle that we keep going on about all
the<00:05:43.580> time<00:05:43.820> as<00:05:44.330> long<00:05:44.450> as<00:05:44.510> we<00:05:44.690> get<00:05:44.840> all<00:05:44.990> of<00:05:45.020> that

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:45.170 
the time as long as we get all of that

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.110 
the time as long as we get all of that
in<00:05:45.500> then<00:05:45.860> we<00:05:45.980> can<00:05:46.160> make<00:05:46.310> the<00:05:46.340> counter<00:05:46.880> and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:47.120 
in then we can make the counter and

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.790 
in then we can make the counter and
we've<00:05:47.270> made<00:05:47.480> it<00:05:47.630> even<00:05:47.750> easier<00:05:48.050> by<00:05:48.770> using

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
we've made it even easier by using

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:51.070 
we've made it even easier by using
exactly<00:05:49.550> the<00:05:49.640> same<00:05:49.790> threat<00:05:50.300> against<00:05:50.750> him

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:51.080 
exactly the same threat against him

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.500 
exactly the same threat against him
so<00:05:51.650> as<00:05:51.770> soon<00:05:51.980> as<00:05:52.040> he<00:05:52.190> moves<00:05:52.640> in<00:05:53.180> that<00:05:53.450> direction

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
so as soon as he moves in that direction

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.900 
so as soon as he moves in that direction
you<00:05:54.170> start<00:05:54.500> moving<00:05:54.740> and<00:05:55.190> just<00:05:55.550> keep<00:05:55.730> his

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:55.910 
you start moving and just keep his

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:57.760 
you start moving and just keep his
weight<00:05:56.150> going<00:05:56.450> towards<00:05:56.780> a<00:05:56.900> third<00:05:57.200> point<00:05:57.560> and

00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:57.770 
weight going towards a third point and

00:05:57.770 --> 00:05:59.560 
weight going towards a third point and
you<00:05:58.340> have<00:05:58.460> to<00:05:58.640> get<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:58.880> count<00:05:59.090> and<00:05:59.240> nice<00:05:59.390> and

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
you have to get the count and nice and

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.760 
you have to get the count and nice and
easily<00:06:01.810> okay<00:06:02.810> now<00:06:02.990> what<00:06:03.140> we're<00:06:03.260> gonna<00:06:03.350> do<00:06:03.590> is

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
easily okay now what we're gonna do is

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.130 
easily okay now what we're gonna do is
just<00:06:04.010> extend<00:06:04.460> that<00:06:04.669> a<00:06:04.790> little<00:06:05.090> bit<00:06:05.240> we've<00:06:06.110> got

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:06.140 
just extend that a little bit we've got

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.659 
just extend that a little bit we've got
the<00:06:06.380> initial<00:06:06.680> attack<00:06:06.890> coming<00:06:07.280> in<00:06:07.400> with

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
the initial attack coming in with

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.760 
the initial attack coming in with
defending<00:06:08.210> that<00:06:08.360> by<00:06:08.570> countering<00:06:09.320> it<00:06:09.500> with<00:06:09.710> the

00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:09.770 
defending that by countering it with the

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:11.470 
defending that by countering it with the
same<00:06:09.950> throw<00:06:10.280> and<00:06:10.580> it's<00:06:11.030> just<00:06:11.150> going<00:06:11.240> to<00:06:11.330> finish

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
same throw and it's just going to finish

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.270 
same throw and it's just going to finish
off<00:06:11.780> with<00:06:11.930> something<00:06:12.110> nice<00:06:12.350> and<00:06:12.590> simple<00:06:12.800> so

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
off with something nice and simple so

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.230 
off with something nice and simple so
that<00:06:13.790> we<00:06:14.360> can<00:06:14.540> later<00:06:14.690> escape
