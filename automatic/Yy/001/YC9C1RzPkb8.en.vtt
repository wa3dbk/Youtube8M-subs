00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.250
 feyenoord is after a bad start me 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.870
 weather back where have the word 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.969
 at the top teams say a lot 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.389
 People Sunday in Arnhem is only a real one 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:13.190
 test 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.190
 how do you look at it 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.230
 yes a real test every weekend every week 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.509
 it we must stand and every 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.339
 competition is just as important so it is 

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:27.720
 I certainly don't see it swell and 

00:00:25.339 --> 00:00:29.990
 must be a good match 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.710
 hopefully against a good opponent 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:37.140
 that also free build up of animals that 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:41.310
 match that almost either true or 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.750
 you could do little against ado on that field there 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.550
 seeing back from the team was earlier 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
 match we see and their start of the 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.100
 competition but still you know that one 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.960
 awkward opponent is a no bemÃ¼ht 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.420
 You do consider vitesse as a competitor 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 in the battle for the top spots 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.700
 yes so far a free one 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.290
 of course always hard to say 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.979
 so now the start of the competition 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.810
 but still you see it is a good one 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.579
 soccer team is with with in front 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.359
 quality so what about you 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:11.130
 form 

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.560
 Sunday at home against ado long 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:16.170
 well last quarter of an hour pastries understand how 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:21.210
 you with your form now okay 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.299
 well nothing can say it now one 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.159
 good series put down except that you 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.729
 that nec out 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:28.729
 But for the rest 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:34.499
 positive yes we have won a lot 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.840
 so say nothing else 

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:38.429
 and with your personal offerings Sunday 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:42.210
 for that is not in the base build 

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:43.950
 unbelievably natural 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.600
 bebat had as 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.479
 what football if you do not play because if 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.119
 she must sit on the couch with 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:54.469
 don't mean a soccer player in the end 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:54.469
 worked out well for the team 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.890
 and 4 2 wins got another 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.680
 raid and 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.009
 can still do the penalty for cases before 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.930
 racial so I felt with the 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:09.090
 smaller ones that got those minutes 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.739
 I just done something last week 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.180
 have had a cow way soon come 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.350
 here one then he said something about you 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.540
 it also gives you off a bit earlier 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:16.530
 occasional help together 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.030
 but what 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:23.239
 Do you recognize anything from our trainers there? 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:27.060
 say that about you after that is that is 

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.250
 just yes i'm a bit cold and me 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.580
 think that the cuban blood is me 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:32.670
 something 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.980
 am relaxed then the one with which ordinary 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.900
 but then when we when the anyway 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:38.640
 time to stand that and then I said 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.720
 always with mine 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:44.459
 doing an absolute best so this is it 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.110
 more an attitude the way to you 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.340
 maybe that is that will be in my 

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:49.470
 attitude has nothing to do with my mentality 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.730
 to worry about who is training this week 

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:52.440
 what do different media have to do 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:54.269
 write that you know koeman and that pass 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.069
 but because he is that he is different 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.660
 more of the group is that what is one 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.470
 difficult distance between players and 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:00.060
 training 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.310
 how do you experience that and what do you think 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:08.190
 it just after what is real I'm number 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:12.390
 5 weeks so I only have my husband for so long 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:15.690
 a so far yes it was the start was 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.609
 not the best but ultimately just as 

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:20.400
 I have just been We also have one now 

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:22.500
 put down a series with so many 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.410
 competitions and so many points achieved 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.350
 except for the draw so I think the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:30.630
 yes if that if that press on the group 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.799
 this mini state and then we can there 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:34.620
 we all get better from it 

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:36.359
 so there is no hassle or so 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.890
 a conflict between players and trainers 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.890
 certainly not certainly not happy but
