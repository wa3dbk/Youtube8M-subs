00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.980
 hello hello we continue with this series of 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.559
 makeup for the holidays 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.710
 and in this case it is a special machine 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.560
 for falls swarthy I will start 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.020
 with the first and I apply it of the eyelid 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:24.690
 mobile up under the arch of the eyebrows 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:27.570
 then I'll take a delineator 

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.570
 I'm going to use it as a base and I'm going to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.629
 apply on all the mobile eyelid I'm going to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.730
 use a flat bristle brush 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.969
 Synthetic to be better 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.409
 application and be a little easier 

00:00:37.969 --> 00:00:44.789
 then I'm going to take a black shadow 

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:47.219
 mate with a flat brush this is 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.899
 small to help me get to the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.379
 I will only apply the 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:55.530
 black shadow in the lacrimal and in the 

00:00:52.379 --> 00:01:00.630
 external angle leaving the space of in 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.610
 medium without black shadow only the base 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.030
 eyeliner that I had previously applied 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:10.320
 but this time I'm going to apply a 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.660
 golden tone in the middle part to 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.750
 having the black base is going to help me 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:18.450
 Look darker and see yourself a little 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.370
 more intense I will apply it with light 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.290
 blows so that it compacts very well and 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.650
 you already know that if a base is very 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:28.140
 greasy I need to apply several times the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.810
 powder so that all the fat is absorbed 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.060
 and the shadows last longer without me 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.409
 run after 20 minutes of having them 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:38.670
 Market Stall 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:42.090
 since I put the golden shadow I will 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.329
 use my brush the one that I put in the 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.579
 black shadow and I will try to blur 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:51.869
 the guards if you notice I'm 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:54.000
 combining the brushes diluted with the 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.630
 black and then blurs a bit with the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.459
 golden and then with the brush that I put 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.119
 the black shadow I'm just going to mark 

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:05.219
 the half circle or the half moon after 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:07.739
 with a brush to blur I'll 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.440
 blur exactly where it sinks my 

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:14.069
 party in the crease the shade coffee 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:16.170
 mate this is a dark coffee what is going 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:20.010
 to help that obviously diffuse 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.230
 very good black and you see all the 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.450
 transition color you know that to me 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:27.900
 like to see the whole grade like this 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.349
 nice later I'm going to take a little 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.930
 more black and I'm going to put it 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:37.530
 exactly where the eyelid sinks 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.230
 so that you continue to see 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.209
 the intense and not so much increase the color 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.209
 because with the brushes to blur already 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:49.290
 I'm going to turn up the color I do not need 

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:51.450
 upload it so much if you set them alone the 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.700
 brushes are doing it because 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:56.600
 bristles that are a little more open 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.600
 of normal 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.359
 then where another brush to blur 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.120
 you are a little wider and what 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:10.000
 I used it was a light brown shade in 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.150
 this case a matte bronzer and what 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.790
 use on top of the dark case the 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.310
 Bristles from this brush already help me 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.010
 raise the tone so I do not need to leave 

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.230
 above the fold after I wanted to 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.290
 intensify the golden shadow so 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.310
 moisten the flat brush and apply more 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.200
 the golden shadow remembers that you can 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.340
 intercalar brochas and go blurring 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.340
 as you require 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:45.230
 now below the arch of your eyebrow 

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:48.739
 I put that tone like a champagne or 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:51.409
 Perlite is satin and only 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:55.519
 I put and to obviously give light in that 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:58.579
 part now I went after using 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:00.920
 different brushes I recommend you 

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:04.010
 that is a brush for each shadow to 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.709
 so you can intersperse them and make a 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.129
 good blur or a good gradient in 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:12.980
 your makeup after I put eyeliner and 

00:04:10.129 --> 00:04:15.709
 my false eyelashes while drying 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:20.509
 the glue did the contour I used the 

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:23.840
 shade dark matte coffee remove the excess 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:27.020
 to the brush and I was marking the face 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.720
 doing a bit of contour after 

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:32.270
 to blur that outline I used a 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.830
 little bronzer and apply it on the 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:37.270
 same area 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.510
 Many of you have asked me 

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:43.090
 what shade of blush is left to the 

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:46.540
 Brunette then here I leave you my favorite 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:50.260
 What is left of any tonality is a 

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:54.310
 aged rose and it's mate is super trendy 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:57.280
 at this time of year in winter the 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.310
 mates are to everything that only gives 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.270
 apply a bit of illuminator in certain 

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:07.630
 areas to obviously give light to the 

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.870
 face but without finishing seeing all the 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:14.650
 Glossy or very exaggerated face 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.350
 only in certain areas as above 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.350
 of the cheeks on the bridge of the nose 

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:21.889
 the little piquito of the mouth and a little in the 

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:26.719
 chin 

00:05:21.889 --> 00:05:30.169
 then I put the black shadow on the 

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:32.900
 lower lashes I put it very well and 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:36.680
 to blur this black shadow I used 

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:38.990
 the dark coffee like that already looked smoked in 

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:42.289
 the part above and in the part below 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:45.529
 of the eye I finished with several layers of 

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:49.159
 Mascara already know in the tabs and below and 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:53.349
 also in the above and finally a 

00:05:49.159 --> 00:05:56.449
 gloss that is a super neutral hue 

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:59.240
 so that they obviously stand out more 

00:05:56.449 --> 00:06:01.980
 eyes of the lips and you see 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.440
 spectacular in these breasts 

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:06.750
 and this is the final result 

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:09.930
 thank you very much to my sister sofÃ­a that 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.940
 It was my beautiful model of today and 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:15.350
 See you next week with more 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:15.350
 tutorials bye
