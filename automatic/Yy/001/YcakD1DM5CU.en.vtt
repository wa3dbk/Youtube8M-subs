is that first of all the greatest

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.249 
is that first of all the greatest
injustice<00:02:09.179> in<00:02:09.509> this<00:02:09.599> country<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.140> the

injustice in this country is the

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.910 
injustice in this country is the
achievement<00:02:10.649> gap<00:02:10.770> between<00:02:10.920> high-income

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
achievement gap between high-income

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.620 
achievement gap between high-income
come<00:02:12.130> students<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.970> what<00:02:13.090> we've<00:02:13.240> found<00:02:13.270> is

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
come students and what we've found is

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.690 
come students and what we've found is
that<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.810> key<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.380> closing<00:02:14.740> that<00:02:14.890> gap<00:02:15.040> one<00:02:15.400> key

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:15.700 
that the key to closing that gap one key

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.490 
that the key to closing that gap one key
not<00:02:15.970> the<00:02:16.090> only<00:02:16.300> key<00:02:16.480> but<00:02:16.630> one<00:02:16.750> key<00:02:16.959> is<00:02:17.140> having

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500 
not the only key but one key is having

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.440 
not the only key but one key is having
more<00:02:17.650> time<00:02:17.890> on<00:02:18.069> task<00:02:18.220> so<00:02:18.970> our<00:02:19.090> kids<00:02:19.240> go<00:02:19.420> to

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:19.450 
more time on task so our kids go to

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.780 
more time on task so our kids go to
school<00:02:19.720> about<00:02:19.900> 60%<00:02:20.650> more<00:02:20.770> time<00:02:21.040> than<00:02:21.640> there

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
school about 60% more time than there

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.220 
school about 60% more time than there
are<00:02:21.819> public<00:02:22.240> there<00:02:22.420> their<00:02:22.720> district<00:02:23.080> school

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
are public there their district school

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.550 
are public there their district school
kid<00:02:23.470> Peters<00:02:24.250> do<00:02:24.580> but<00:02:25.510> what<00:02:25.660> we<00:02:25.780> found<00:02:25.990> in<00:02:26.319> Kipp

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:26.560 
kid Peters do but what we found in Kipp

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:28.920 
kid Peters do but what we found in Kipp
is<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.950> we've<00:02:27.490> doubled<00:02:27.940> achievement<00:02:28.390> among

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
is that we've doubled achievement among

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.840 
is that we've doubled achievement among
students<00:02:29.320> like<00:02:29.470> ours<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:29.920> our<00:02:30.400> kids<00:02:30.640> go<00:02:30.730> from

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
students like ours so our kids go from

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.880 
students like ours so our kids go from
the<00:02:31.000> 40th<00:02:31.360> percentile<00:02:31.870> in<00:02:31.990> math<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.380> the<00:02:32.470> 80th

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
the 40th percentile in math to the 80th

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.070 
the 40th percentile in math to the 80th
in<00:02:33.100> their<00:02:33.490> short<00:02:33.730> time<00:02:33.970> with<00:02:34.720> us

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
in their short time with us

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.530 
in their short time with us
so<00:02:35.430> this<00:02:36.430> might<00:02:36.550> be<00:02:36.670> that<00:02:36.700> retention<00:02:37.120> they

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
so this might be that retention they

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.240 
so this might be that retention they
don't<00:02:37.750> lose<00:02:38.020> things<00:02:38.350> over<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.770> summer<00:02:38.800> time

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:39.250 
don't lose things over the summer time

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.130 
don't lose things over the summer time
right<00:02:39.520> that's<00:02:39.910> part<00:02:40.150> of<00:02:40.239> it<00:02:40.420> and<00:02:40.540> part<00:02:40.989> of<00:02:41.020> it

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
right that's part of it and part of it

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.199 
right that's part of it and part of it
is<00:02:41.170> just<00:02:41.440> when<00:02:42.250> you<00:02:42.340> have<00:02:42.489> great<00:02:42.790> teachers

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
is just when you have great teachers

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.110 
is just when you have great teachers
more<00:02:43.870> of<00:02:44.050> those<00:02:44.230> grade<00:02:44.530> teachers<00:02:44.920> more<00:02:45.910> time

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.120 
more of those grade teachers more time

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.490 
more of those grade teachers more time
with<00:02:46.270> those<00:02:46.360> great<00:02:46.630> teachers<00:02:46.989> it's<00:02:47.170> just<00:02:47.350> good

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
with those great teachers it's just good

well<00:02:58.630> first<00:02:58.840> of<00:02:58.959> all<00:02:58.989> it's<00:02:59.260> important<00:02:59.620> to

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
well first of all it's important to

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.150 
well first of all it's important to
understand<00:03:00.130> that<00:03:00.310> Kip's<00:03:01.560> approach<00:03:02.560> is<00:03:02.830> more

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
understand that Kip's approach is more

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.400 
understand that Kip's approach is more
than<00:03:03.459> just<00:03:03.820> extending<00:03:04.600> the<00:03:04.720> school<00:03:04.959> year<00:03:05.019> and

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
than just extending the school year and

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.590 
than just extending the school year and
that<00:03:05.620> when<00:03:05.830> you<00:03:05.950> look<00:03:06.160> at<00:03:06.400> the<00:03:07.030> claims<00:03:07.330> of

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:07.600 
that when you look at the claims of

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.180 
that when you look at the claims of
success<00:03:08.080> they<00:03:08.350> don't<00:03:08.590> hold<00:03:08.800> up<00:03:09.010> under

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
success they don't hold up under

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:12.290 
success they don't hold up under
scrutiny<00:03:09.489> and<00:03:10.030> in<00:03:10.180> fact<00:03:10.420> school<00:03:11.230> districts
