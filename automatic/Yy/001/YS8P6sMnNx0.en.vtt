 hello everyone welcome to this new 

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:09.860
 channel I am marisa and this time 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.650
 I bring you this new video tutorial 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:14.990
 where I'm going to show you how to change the 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.390
 cydia message that appears in the 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.029
 home page as you can see here 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.369
 I should say welcome to Syria but 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.740
 I have changed that message for this 

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:26.449
 word that says subscribe so that 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
 so each and every one of you see it 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:30.710
 every one who enters xiria and then I'm going 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.599
 to teach more or less how is it 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.820
 you have to change what is 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:37.130
 this message so that you can 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.410
 put anything in your name a 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.780
 figures what you want so 

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:44.329
 then we will start 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.370
 in order to make this modification what 

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.079
 what we have to do is go to cydia 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.350
 Once inside we are going to drive 

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:53.600
 then to sources edit 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:55.850
 and we are going to add the repository of 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.890
 aitex grupo puntocom I will leave them 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:00.140
 here in the description so that you 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.149
 they can see it and in this way they can 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.180
 add the octopus aitex repository 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:07.280
 dotcom the or the repository sorry 

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.229
 republic dotcom I think most 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.509
 you already know republic 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.850
 puntocom in any of those two is going to 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:14.570
 serve very well you put him add 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.700
 source 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.830
 I put him cancel because I already have 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.539
 we put the ready we are going to go to 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.030
 search and we'll look for the tweet of 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:25.130
 haifa and since we are going to use it for 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.350
 to be able to change what this message is 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.940

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.670
 from the dotcom republic 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:33.800
 for example they enter what is the tweet 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:36.380
 that they put install and on confirmed that 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.409
 once downloaded what they are going to do is 

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:40.789
 once inside the following alpha and 

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.890
 what we are going to do is going to be 

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.770
 root the root is represented by a 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.480
 diagonal line then once inside 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:51.500
 from the root we're going to go 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:53.660
 is apply is in folder forgive 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.490
 which is called applications we are going to give 

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:58.640
 tap and here we will search the application 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.160
 from cydia ok would be point up here you guys 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.280

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.920
 will appear the cid and the folders of 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:10.100
 cydia in different languages â€‹â€‹english 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.050
 French German Italian and so on 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.720
 example I have it in Spanish here says 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.270
 spanish you select the folder 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.130
 according to how you have sidya in the 

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.500
 language in which they have it I put it in 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:23.210
 Spanish here we will appear a unique 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.300
 file that is this that they have here in 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:28.370
 the top part I'm going to give tap and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:30.050
 I'll put it in text viewer that 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.450
 So you have to put it in 

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.820
 text viewer and we will appear all 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.250
 this code ok what we have to do 

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:40.340
 now it 's very simple we're going to go to 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:43.130
 search ok now what we have to do 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.800
 it is here where he says look we are going to put 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:47.630
 the word of welcome so day ok by 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.460
 example I no longer have that word that 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:52.430
 you could see me she tells us 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.170
 at home at first welcome to Syria 

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.730
 already says subscribe 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.290
 what I'm going to do is look 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.989
 that word subscribe 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.129
 and I think that around here I came out here 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.700
 example you can see what it says 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.890
 welcome to sidya and now equal to 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.840
 subscribe then what I can 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:11.310
 do is select this I'm going to put 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.750
 here on the top where it says 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.890
 edit you selected it and I can delete it 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.450
 Always remember to leave 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.859
 quotes that are on the sides like 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.930
 you can see there are two quotes 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:23.879
 then they have to leave those quotes 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.530
 and then you can put what you 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:29.700
 you what you want too 

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.019
 serve with this emoji monitor you 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.959
 you can put the one you want for 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.359
 example these yori cones or can they put 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.310
 a heart what you want a 

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:41.669
 once they have modified the welcome to 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.450
 sidya they put him save they put him ok and 

00:03:41.669 --> 00:03:44.489
 ready 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:46.980
 in this way they are going to have to 

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:48.659
 changed what is your message of 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:50.370
 welcome so day the only thing they have 

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.590
 what to do next is to make a 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:54.889
 respite to your device with is vice 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.889
 tips 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:59.860
 and as you can see you are already 

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:01.930
 completely changed what is the 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:05.560
 Welcome to Syria and here appear the 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.420
 faces of little monkeys crying and the 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.849
 heart that we put earlier 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:11.379
 we can change many more things of everything 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:13.690
 what is here in Syria since it is 

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.180
 translated into Spanish and well if you 

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:17.889
 they like and if you want me to tell you 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.389
 how to change for example here that says 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.120
 sidya instead of saying yes day 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:24.490
 then you get a bus a man or I'm a 

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.630

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.970
 if you want me to help you 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.740

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:41.919
 possible so then that would be all 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.600
