00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.970
 to the question what you have later 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:21.369
 we are the answers mostly the same 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:23.619
 a house with a garden car and much much 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.810
 money to own it once 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:27.610
 both or spanning what are you doing 

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:29.020
 with your money you give everything the same 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.520
 you think of the one or the other 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:32.079
 another euro on the side 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.700
 We did not just ask you that 

00:00:32.079 --> 00:00:34.510
 The stars are also very small 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.110
 started 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.610
 do you feel and why are you saving so much 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:41.260
 track master I'm not really who 

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.080
 I finally see something like that in my body 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:49.930
 mostly somewhere for example and 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.820
 spain travel through africa travel and 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.880
 on the spree actually tracks directly 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:58.540
 not if I like her and then 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:01.450
 Buy what you have just done amplifier 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:04.600
 buys and makes the four job jobs that 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:05.560
 you can afford that save something for 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.750
 module travel 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.159
 work for it quite lead animal experiments 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.140
 to save but it usually takes 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:14.770
 it will always be something 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:17.200
 buy ha di gÃ¤rn taken around grunde 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.700
 actually rather little but give me 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.569
 money when is actually pretty 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.569
 quickly 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.570
 which actually traveling on the large 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:31.579
 main track for example driving license 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:35.420
 already as second in the east is up 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:39.350
 you then practically surf about but now 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:42.079
 currently sport nothing so I already and 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.360
 Although from passbook is before because always 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:49.429
 later make some living in the 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:52.490
 He has painted a real condominium 

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.890
 were to continue or gang likes to drive out 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.009
 but a little something goes a month 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.700
 from that pressure but later with 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:02.479
 no moment but have the money you 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.780
 earn when the holidays when 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.630
 Ferialjobs saves for next year 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.750
 is the benchmark at home in america 

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:13.849
 and weight training spahn is a virtue 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:15.890
 spahn is one of our values 

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:18.590
 society and saving money 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.650
 shows the change in value because that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.060
 saving money is not going to be that way anymore 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:27.829
 unrestricted so in the center of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:30.709
 seen with important values 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.540
 it will not save any other words 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:38.359
 classified as important as earlier 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:40.069
 nevertheless, many save it altogether 

00:02:38.359 --> 00:02:40.810
 there is no such thing as an important role in saving 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.620
 more 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.209
 Earlier, saving was something like something 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.639
 centrally is what is really important 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.220
 Saving something fundamental was important 

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:55.220
 and kicked today I have ever 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.190
 over it about the so-called financing 

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.769
 by saying then there is here or there 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.630
 I have favorable solution where the trade 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:04.639
 or whoever offers partial payment 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:06.680
 So we go around with money and other 

00:03:04.639 --> 00:03:09.200
 it is especially the youth with money 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:11.739
 deals differently so saving is not 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.690
 more so exclusively in the center 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.579
 of the necessary it is not the only one 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:19.190
 value retention the central value attitude 

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.989
 So we go loosely with money and 

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.470
 Youth is actually just that 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:27.340
 Target group the one particularly relaxed 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.340
 dealing with money has 

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:32.849
 Do you still have a piggy bank? 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:35.370
 and do you bring this every year on the 31st? 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:37.650
 october to the bank many in your age 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:39.030
 but why do you do that? 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.069
 actually the matchpuck and since when 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:44.340
 He is the World Savings Day already very much 

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.560
 namely for 84 years concrete and 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.030
 has broken through the right breakthrough 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:51.989
 the World Savings Agreement still only one 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.840
 war is what the people are aware of 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:57.660
 have saved more and each other 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:59.459
 saving is important that was so then 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:05.580
 so today and will be so in the future 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:07.860
 if you have a euro every day 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:09.630
 save as 30 euros a month 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.940
 there she goes with 18 years for this are 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.739
 existing and if they are special 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:16.680
 be frugal perhaps already is 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:19.350
 the first little used there mine 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:23.389
 first earned money i believe 

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:27.060
 I bought a good bottle of wine and 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:29.669
 new pants power the goods needed first 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.650
 a vw beetle beetle saving a 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:33.800
 I'll never forget the grayer ones 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.690
 At the time, pride cost 

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:41.070
 23,500 schilling that still sounds nothing 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.110
 are not even 1000 kilo sausage but 

00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.419
 very little but it was for me then 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.740
 what you can do 

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:48.870
 And it was also a great innovation 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:52.229
 I I have buying auto thought 

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.700
 now I am rich now have the 

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:56.060
 Breakthrough made it today is all 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.060
 relative
