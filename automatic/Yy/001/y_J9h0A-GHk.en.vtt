for a 3 by 3 and then we'll do some

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:29.719 
for a 3 by 3 and then we'll do some

you have nothing over here just go down
to<00:04:02.980> this<00:04:03.280> one<00:04:03.549> because<00:04:03.969> you<00:04:04.150> need<00:04:04.450> three

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
to this one because you need three

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.330 
to this one because you need three
entries<00:04:05.620> notice<00:04:06.189> each<00:04:06.340> one<00:04:06.519> of<00:04:06.549> these<00:04:06.700> has

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
entries notice each one of these has

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.190 
entries notice each one of these has
333333<00:04:09.340> you<00:04:10.150> need<00:04:10.299> three<00:04:10.599> factors<00:04:11.019> in<00:04:11.169> the

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
333333 you need three factors in the

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.800 
333333 you need three factors in the
multiplication<00:04:11.889> so<00:04:12.700> it's<00:04:12.849> this<00:04:13.060> times<00:04:13.659> this

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:13.810 
multiplication so it's this times this

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:17.310 
multiplication so it's this times this
times<00:04:14.500> this<00:04:15.120> now<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.150> go<00:04:16.419> to<00:04:16.479> the<00:04:16.599> next<00:04:16.720> one<00:04:16.840> be

13 there's nothing here but you need
three<00:04:19.900> of<00:04:19.930> them<00:04:20.109> so<00:04:20.320> you<00:04:20.380> go<00:04:20.560> here<00:04:21.190> and<00:04:21.280> here<00:04:22.240> so

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
three of them so you go here and here so

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:27.659 
three of them so you go here and here so
it's<00:04:23.530> be<00:04:23.710> 13<00:04:24.280> be<00:04:25.060> 21<00:04:25.570> times<00:04:26.050> be<00:04:26.289> 32<00:04:26.800> that<00:04:27.430> takes

care of the plus part now let's deal

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:32.460 
care of the plus part now let's deal
with<00:04:29.800> a<00:04:29.979> minus<00:04:30.250> part<00:04:30.639> go<00:04:31.539> back<00:04:31.720> to<00:04:31.870> the<00:04:31.900> b11

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:32.470 
with a minus part go back to the b11

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.279 
with a minus part go back to the b11
well<00:04:33.340> be<00:04:33.550> 11<00:04:33.940> now<00:04:34.240> go<00:04:34.449> try<00:04:34.509> going<00:04:34.900> down<00:04:35.110> to<00:04:35.259> the

there<00:04:59.050> are<00:04:59.110> different<00:04:59.349> kind<00:04:59.500> of<00:04:59.560> patterns

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
there are different kind of patterns

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.770 
there are different kind of patterns
that<00:05:00.009> you<00:05:00.070> can<00:05:00.250> come<00:05:00.460> up<00:05:00.580> with<00:05:00.789> this<00:05:01.270> is<00:05:01.479> simply

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
that you can come up with this is simply

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:03.870 
that you can come up with this is simply
the<00:05:01.900> best<00:05:02.080> pattern<00:05:02.500> that<00:05:02.740> i<00:05:02.979> personally<00:05:03.490> have

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
the best pattern that i personally have

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:06.089 
the best pattern that i personally have
come<00:05:04.060> up<00:05:04.210> with<00:05:04.389> to<00:05:04.659> work<00:05:04.840> with<00:05:05.139> three<00:05:05.949> by

00:05:06.089 --> 00:05:06.099 
come up with to work with three by

00:05:06.099 --> 00:05:10.320 
come up with to work with three by
threes<00:05:07.770> again<00:05:08.770> you've<00:05:09.759> probably<00:05:10.000> seen

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:10.330 
threes again you've probably seen

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:11.700 
threes again you've probably seen
determinist<00:05:10.810> before<00:05:11.110> so<00:05:11.229> whatever<00:05:11.470> pattern

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:11.710 
determinist before so whatever pattern

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.379 
determinist before so whatever pattern
you<00:05:11.830> come<00:05:12.039> up<00:05:12.159> with<00:05:12.280> is<00:05:12.400> fine<00:05:12.639> I<00:05:12.849> think<00:05:13.300> this

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:13.389 
you come up with is fine I think this

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.029 
you come up with is fine I think this
works<00:05:13.570> out<00:05:13.750> the<00:05:13.900> best<00:05:13.930> simply<00:05:14.530> because<00:05:14.830> you're

00:05:15.029 --> 00:05:15.039 
works out the best simply because you're

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:17.460 
works out the best simply because you're
going<00:05:15.280> to<00:05:15.370> the<00:05:15.460> right<00:05:15.810> positive<00:05:16.810> you're<00:05:17.229> going

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:17.470 
going to the right positive you're going

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:21.379 
going to the right positive you're going
down<00:05:17.500> to<00:05:17.919> the<00:05:18.060> left-<00:05:19.060> if<00:05:19.539> that<00:05:19.810> makes<00:05:20.050> sense<00:05:20.229> so

00:05:21.379 --> 00:05:21.389 
down to the left- if that makes sense so

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:23.879 
down to the left- if that makes sense so
those<00:05:22.389> have<00:05:22.419> positive<00:05:23.169> signs<00:05:23.440> when<00:05:23.770> you're

00:05:23.879 --> 00:05:23.889 
those have positive signs when you're

00:05:23.889 --> 00:05:24.930 
those have positive signs when you're
moving<00:05:23.979> in<00:05:24.190> this<00:05:24.310> direction<00:05:24.370> you<00:05:24.820> have

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
moving in this direction you have

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.270 
moving in this direction you have
negative<00:05:25.330> signs<00:05:25.599> and<00:05:25.900> of<00:05:26.259> course<00:05:26.560> in<00:05:26.740> this<00:05:26.889> you

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
negative signs and of course in this you

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.790 
negative signs and of course in this you
have<00:05:27.400> a<00:05:27.430> three<00:05:27.699> by<00:05:27.820> three<00:05:27.849> each<00:05:28.750> term<00:05:29.199> has<00:05:29.620> to

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:29.800 
have a three by three each term has to

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.709 
have a three by three each term has to
have<00:05:29.949> three<00:05:30.280> things<00:05:30.449> multiplied<00:05:31.449> by<00:05:31.599> each

00:05:31.709 --> 00:05:31.719 
have three things multiplied by each

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:38.310 
have three things multiplied by each
other<00:05:32.190> okay<00:05:33.190> let's<00:05:33.940> do<00:05:34.090> some<00:05:34.240> examples

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:38.320 

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:42.280 

let's<00:05:39.320> go<00:05:39.440> back<00:05:39.650> to<00:05:40.960> actually<00:05:41.960> you<00:05:42.050> know<00:05:42.140> what

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:42.290 
let's go back to actually you know what

00:05:42.290 --> 00:05:45.610 
let's go back to actually you know what
i<00:05:42.410> think<00:05:42.530> i'm<00:05:42.680> going<00:05:42.800> to<00:05:42.890> try<00:05:43.040> blue<00:05:43.490> ink<00:05:44.620> let's

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:45.620 
i think i'm going to try blue ink let's

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:52.740 
i think i'm going to try blue ink let's
define<00:05:46.070> a<00:05:46.310> as<00:05:47.890> one<00:05:48.890> two<00:05:49.610> three<00:05:50.470> two<00:05:51.470> one<00:05:52.130> three

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
define a as one two three two one three

again<00:06:54.740> positive<00:06:55.340> this<00:06:55.490> way-<00:06:56.800> that<00:06:57.800> way<00:07:00.580> let's

00:07:01.570 --> 00:07:01.580 
again positive this way- that way let's

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:04.660 
again positive this way- that way let's
do<00:07:01.700> a<00:07:01.730> two<00:07:01.940> by<00:07:02.090> two<00:07:02.260> let's<00:07:03.260> say<00:07:03.500> B<00:07:03.860> is<00:07:04.040> equal<00:07:04.250> to

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:04.670 
do a two by two let's say B is equal to

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:09.190 
do a two by two let's say B is equal to
4<00:07:05.420> negative<00:07:06.260> 7<00:07:06.770> 2<00:07:07.520> negative<00:07:08.390> 3<00:07:08.420> so<00:07:08.870> now<00:07:09.020> we<00:07:09.080> have

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:09.200 
4 negative 7 2 negative 3 so now we have

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.550 
4 negative 7 2 negative 3 so now we have
some<00:07:09.620> negative<00:07:09.890> entries<00:07:10.370> ok<00:07:11.440> do<00:07:12.440> you

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
some negative entries ok do you

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:18.490 
some negative entries ok do you
determinant<00:07:13.130> of<00:07:14.980> B<00:07:15.980> is<00:07:16.250> equal<00:07:16.580> to<00:07:16.940> this<00:07:17.600> times

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:18.500 
determinant of B is equal to this times

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:22.320 
determinant of B is equal to this times
this<00:07:19.150> 4<00:07:20.150> times<00:07:20.450> negative<00:07:20.930> 3<00:07:21.410> is<00:07:21.440> negative<00:07:21.890> 12

00:07:22.320 --> 00:07:22.330 
this 4 times negative 3 is negative 12

00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:26.740 
this 4 times negative 3 is negative 12
minus<00:07:23.330> this<00:07:24.200> times<00:07:24.860> this<00:07:25.060> this<00:07:26.060> times<00:07:26.360> this<00:07:26.450> is

00:07:26.740 --> 00:07:26.750 
minus this times this this times this is

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.030 
minus this times this this times this is
negative<00:07:27.140> 14<00:07:27.620> the<00:07:28.160> minus<00:07:28.520> sign<00:07:28.700> has<00:07:28.910> to<00:07:29.120> stay

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:30.040 
negative 14 the minus sign has to stay

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:36.720 
negative 14 the minus sign has to stay
so<00:07:31.040> it's<00:07:32.080> negative<00:07:33.080> 12<00:07:33.560> minus<00:07:34.250> a<00:07:34.640> negative

00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:36.730 
so it's negative 12 minus a negative

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.950 
so it's negative 12 minus a negative
14-12<00:07:37.730> plus<00:07:38.420> 14<00:07:38.990> it<00:07:39.440> is<00:07:39.710> equal<00:07:39.980> to<00:07:40.100> 2<00:07:40.480> ok<00:07:41.480> so

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:41.960 
14-12 plus 14 it is equal to 2 ok so

00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:45.010 
14-12 plus 14 it is equal to 2 ok so
these<00:07:42.170> signs<00:07:42.560> here<00:07:43.040> this<00:07:43.700> plus<00:07:44.150> here<00:07:44.540> plus
