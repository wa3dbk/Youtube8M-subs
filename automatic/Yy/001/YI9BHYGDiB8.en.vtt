00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:10.999 

we<00:00:09.030> have<00:00:09.180> a<00:00:09.210> wide<00:00:09.480> range<00:00:09.809> of<00:00:09.990> swage<00:00:10.320> dyes<00:00:10.679> from

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:11.009 
we have a wide range of swage dyes from

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:13.430 
we have a wide range of swage dyes from
two<00:00:11.280> millimeters<00:00:11.879> upwards<00:00:12.420> selection<00:00:13.320> is

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:13.440 
two millimeters upwards selection is

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.890 
two millimeters upwards selection is
easy<00:00:13.650> because<00:00:13.919> we<00:00:14.309> use<00:00:14.490> the<00:00:14.639> same<00:00:14.940> size<00:00:15.330> cable

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
easy because we use the same size cable

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.269 
easy because we use the same size cable
and<00:00:16.290> fitting<00:00:18.230> first<00:00:19.230> we<00:00:19.439> check<00:00:19.680> the<00:00:19.830> depth<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
and fitting first we check the depth of

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.730 
and fitting first we check the depth of
the<00:00:20.369> ball<00:00:20.580> with<00:00:21.180> plastic<00:00:21.630> coated<00:00:22.050> cables<00:00:22.500> the

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
the ball with plastic coated cables the

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.160 
the ball with plastic coated cables the
outer<00:00:22.890> coating<00:00:23.279> is<00:00:23.580> removed<00:00:24.029> so<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.929> bare

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
outer coating is removed so the bare

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:32.359 
outer coating is removed so the bare
cable<00:00:25.650> fully<00:00:26.189> enters<00:00:26.670> the<00:00:26.820> fitting<00:00:31.369> with

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
cable fully enters the fitting with

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.549 
cable fully enters the fitting with
plain<00:00:32.640> cables<00:00:33.150> it<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.450> only<00:00:33.629> necessary<00:00:33.930> to

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
plain cables it is only necessary to

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.369 
plain cables it is only necessary to
check<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.190> depth<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> mark<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.210> cable<00:00:36.660> so

00:00:37.369 --> 00:00:37.379 
check the depth and mark the cable so

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:39.200 
check the depth and mark the cable so
that<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.680> know<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> is<00:00:38.129> fully<00:00:38.430> inserted<00:00:38.610> before

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
that we know it is fully inserted before

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:52.770 
that we know it is fully inserted before
the<00:00:39.480> swaging<00:00:39.870> operation

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
once completed the eye is strong enough

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.170 
once completed the eye is strong enough
to<00:01:34.430> take<00:01:34.579> 90%<00:01:35.090> of<00:01:35.600> the<00:01:35.750> road<00:01:35.930> braking<00:01:36.409> load<00:01:37.180> it

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:38.180 
to take 90% of the road braking load it

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.210 
to take 90% of the road braking load it
will<00:01:38.329> fit<00:01:38.540> into<00:01:38.750> brackets<00:01:39.320> and<00:01:39.740> fittings

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
will fit into brackets and fittings

00:01:40.220 --> 00:02:04.390 
will fit into brackets and fittings
