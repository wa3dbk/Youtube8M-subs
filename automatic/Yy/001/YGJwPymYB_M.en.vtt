00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:10.660
 It is not ク チ ャ ー Today is the story of ricoh theta 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:16.960
 Breakthrough that can be taken this ricoh theta 360 degrees with one shot all round 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:18.010
 New is the device for you but just below the absolutely cat of the shutter button the lens 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.170
 At some of 

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:25.340
 When you take a photo with a shot , you get a big shot of yourself 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:31.730
 Written in to do with this 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:37.340
 I think that I want to solve it, and I've been here until now attached to something pot like this 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:40.340
 If you release the shutter with an iphone etc. here rather than using the shutter 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:44.510
 Can not see his hands large 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:45.329
 However, there was something that could be taken by all means 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.630
 that is 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:46.700
 Hmm 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.510
 this 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:54.260
 I'm a part of the body of Shit 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:58.130
 It is the subtle Tteyuu I think I'm sticking out here 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:05.210
 This is what Vivian had moved to 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:06.690
 I can not make it inconspicuous because I can not erase the white body that is slightly reflected 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:11.100
 Various makes 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:15.420
 Although on facebook I was your story and panoramic fellow 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:22.200
 Under such circumstances, some people have given us ground-breaking ideas 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:26.680
 Click here if Kumon's I is Kumon's Photos dojo say Among tell you what 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.740
 This is I put the aluminum tape to the body 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:35.230
 When I make a white part a mirror 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:40.180
 By making a mirror in the three white companies did not appear 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:45.370
 That the color of the direction diagonally downward is visible on captured co 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.700
 For example, in the case where it was placed, such as the table without 's can also sound 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.370
 Table color 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.750
 It's really reflective and it's really inconspicuous 

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:57.010
 Let's actually do a little 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:02:04.560
 There is no separate it particularly difficult 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:06.080
 Most recently the most recent and the tape of the aluminum to the appropriate thickness 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:11.630
 Cut it 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:16.370
 Then I will cover this protruding part of this theta 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:18.800
 I'll just put on a dip, but just the cat's shutter button 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.150
 Only this part of put away 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:26.069
 We'll make a round cut statement in a semicircular shape 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:32.219
 I'm good without'm this kind personality to another 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:37.680
 I think that the motif is written in the feeling that the shutter button is just a notch 

00:02:32.219 --> 00:02:42.670
 I cut it like this and then I put it on the sheet and put it on and say. 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:47.040
 If it is ok , the cat is the most important 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.040
 It feels like this 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:03:06.410
 Pada is all right so you can't just finish it here in this boo 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:09.250
 Yeah it is a problem outside error extra things that I Tsu of the day there is no Aso Reka 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:09.250
 If 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:18.170
 Good 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:25.820
 Yes, we were able to put the aluminum tape to both sides in this way 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:27.170
 With this, when I take a picture, this part of 某 d is reflected without being reflected and the texture of this side is reflected 

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:31.430
 Nde made in coming thing 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:33.120
 I think I would take in the pretty people and the pattern of the table 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.700
 Well then the sample I took with this 

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:40.780
 Let's have a look today 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:46.300
 Yes first of all without owning anything 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:53.550
 It is the photograph which I took with my hand and theta 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:59.240
 Like this , your hand is shown in a large size, but this also changes the way you hold it 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:04:01.350
 Te is like this really though I have is devised so as not to stand out too large 

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.790
 Hand is big 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.580
 I'm going to recon 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:09.960
 Yes here 

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:13.819
 This time, I put it on the tip of the monopod and stick it 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:18.420
 We devise not to be reflected, and further 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:24.780
 but also had to stretch oo I do what Kachitchai myself of 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:26.380
 This white line here is the body of the Theta . 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.240
 It in This 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:35.050
 I until I'm I was could not bear consumption also to what now 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.030
 I had no choice but to delete it by retouching 

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.620
 Yes and here 

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:44.400
 This version of the remodeled aluminum tape 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:48.100
 It was a photo I took 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:50.400
 I will live horror 

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.689
 Also I did you say that I came 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.749
 Here your error 

00:04:51.689 --> 00:05:03.149
 The white body is not totally reflected 

00:04:54.749 --> 00:05:08.999
 Although it is not completely reflected, the mirror reflection of the aluminum stuck to the body is in fact next to this 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:11.680
 That is to say I have become I'm certain I table of texture is crowded Ballmer mirror 

00:05:08.999 --> 00:05:19.020
 I will not do any processing at all 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:22.819
 That's how it looks like it's going to disappear beautifully 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.819
 I do not know it already it is this- 

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:35.260
 I wonder if this was so cheap aluminum tape that sells even cheap 100 yen 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:41.140
 Easily you will find in it Flower of theta that image quality is improved 

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:44.030
 Kumon's photo Dojo's site has a link in the explanation column but it's a drum photo 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.830
 I think if you are interested, you will study by all means 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:50.490
 I think there is no loss in looking 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:56.940
 What I introduced today is the photo dojo 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:59.370
 The white tape of the body is pasted on the aluminum tape that Mr. Kumon taught 

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:01.230
 A trick to reduce reflection 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:05.750
 was 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:07.750
 It can be used to support this good 

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:07.750
 Hmm
