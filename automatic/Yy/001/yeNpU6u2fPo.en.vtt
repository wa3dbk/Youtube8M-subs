 even a little later from the first of September 

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.970
 such matches are engaged at least 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:06.710
 Andreeva week just recently 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:08.570
 little attention and monolithic and 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.080
 border guards children children schoolchildren but still 

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.900
 not first graders they turn to school 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.689
 Russian language for children of migrants 

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:15.719
 essentially it's preparatory 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:16.539
 general education class 

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:19.590
 schools only studies them exclusively 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.999
 electricians russian language 

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:22.340
 analysts medical grammar 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.079
 practice 

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:25.349
 and in the form of a game output 

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.849
 specially designed technicians 

00:01:26.849 --> 00:01:29.529
 the main thing is not very colorful and colorful 

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:30.490
 illustrations 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.550

 Shuvalov game and schools 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:37.800
 Abramov thinks we are talking hotels 

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:38.600
 more 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.130
 to their children really 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:42.439
 It was crowded because of course such things 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:45.330
 serious as plural 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.659
 categories of making the field of soulfulness in 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:49.030
 four years 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.850
 and it's hard for them 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.280
 learning Russian as 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:53.710
 foreign year is calculated 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.850
 the main goal is to teach every child 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.770
 just chat in Russian and only 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.640
 then read and write so that in the future he could 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.400
 easily learn the usual school 

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.210
 programs 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.480
 they all start from scratch 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.260
 that is six eight years 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.810
 to death despite whose capone 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.689
 class at home finished 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:14.289
 they are Russian over from scratch 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.509
 and expense testing which 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:18.719
 held in September when they came to us 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.209
 she shows to school 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:22.889
 but chit makes 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:26.010
 individual work plan from a group of 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.010
 each ball separately student 

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:32.989
 in principle, the group should be no more 

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:36.009
 12 children is an important point I also can not 

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:37.979
 forget that it is expensive 

00:02:37.979 --> 00:02:41.789
 it's expensive and learning course at speed 25 

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:43.070
 children 30 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.810
 and here the game 

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.150
 13 when AIDS is like for Moscow it is expensive but 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.670
 it requires training methods 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.670
 Russian as a foreign language 

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.519
 here is another 

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:56.199
 class of the same school of Russian language from 

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:57.919
 ideas older children 

00:02:57.919 --> 00:03:00.169
 but now their program is much younger 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:02.259
 more serious and next year they 

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:03.649
 will already learn along with their 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.699
 Russian peers fourth who in the fifth 

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:08.339
 economy class 

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:11.339
 they came 

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:15.379
 the girl came 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:23.500
 the boss can't do it 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.270
 plant children must master not only 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:27.310
 heated learn to read and 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.499
 write correctly 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.599
 the help of the teacher this year the dress appeared 

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.429
 interactive whiteboard 

00:03:32.429 --> 00:03:34.669
 price increases are not comparable with last year because 

00:03:34.669 --> 00:03:37.119
 what pass when study even 

00:03:37.119 --> 00:03:38.870
 simplest new words 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:41.299
 it's one thing trying to dance like that 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.090
 explain these words is another thing when us 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.149
 it can instantly show it 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:47.879
 that is, the visualization of our business is engaged 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:50.879
 native village first positions in importance 

00:03:51.649 --> 00:03:53.539
 due to the fact that training takes place on 

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:54.339
 ordinary general education 

00:03:54.339 --> 00:03:55.369
 schools 

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:57.329
 children of foreigners quickly poured into 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.159
 new medium they come with it 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:00.619
 involved school activities 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:02.819
 holiday concert officer names and 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.059
 here they feel outcasts but for 

00:04:05.059 --> 00:04:06.629
 Russian children international 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.129
 the school will be set at 

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:10.570
 opening of this event 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:12.890
 fourth grade usually our school is not 

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:14.299
 Russian language school 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.299
 but the composition of multinational 

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:27.270
 not us 

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.599
 still armenia moldavia abkhazia 

00:04:31.599 --> 00:04:34.249
 Tatarstan and of course Russians 30 percent 

00:04:34.249 --> 00:04:36.899
 students of this school are foreigners 

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:38.979
 no national enmity will appear 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:40.399
 sense of unity they arise 

00:04:40.399 --> 00:04:41.849
 subconsciously assures the director 

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:43.620
 schools maria five countries 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.969
 Well, if you take only one of you to kings 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:49.960
 there are still roots of different nations 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.220
 but we try this list of all that all 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:54.240
 children must learn 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.870
 they all have to live happy well 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.029

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:03.319
 scheduled work on parenting 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:06.819
 Tolerance friendship she sang from that 

00:05:06.819 --> 00:05:07.539
 here we are 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:10.539
 Such a school climate is good 

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:25.189
 a la 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.830

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:34.729
 by this time 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:37.169
 It happens and this children will be the glory of their own and 

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:39.289
 Russian language but teachers include 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:40.970
 similar blunders with understanding 

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.550
 and even allow gentle mode 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:44.560
 evaluating these pupils cells by 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.400
 humanities exactly the same

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.780
 most of the foreigners who 

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.760
 graduates of the Russian language school 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.050

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:06.270
 the confirmation 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.619
 along with the growth on which 

00:06:08.619 --> 00:06:10.650
 it is such 

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:12.800
 Russian language school to help me which 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:14.460
 Should the Moscow Department of Education and 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:15.570
 children of migrants 

00:06:15.570 --> 00:06:17.710
 they exist in every district on the base 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.610
 schools where he works on 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.940
 two schemes the first is pretty school 

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.770

 Russian language classes 

00:06:25.129 --> 00:06:27.739
 but these lessons are these lessons as a rule 

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:29.599
 kids visit that basically 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:31.629
 Syktyvkar speak 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:33.699
 but can not painlessly and gently 

00:06:33.699 --> 00:06:35.659
 the learning process will start because 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:38.240
 problems with the language there 

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.560
 all the money and help in the second half 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:42.240
 of the day literate teachers who 

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:45.190
 passed no special training courses 

00:06:45.190 --> 00:06:47.410
 advanced training exactly 

00:06:47.410 --> 00:06:50.069
 these are subjects 

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:52.460
 there is a portal of the kind of madrid bodelan 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:53.919
 big win he's damn 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:06:56.439
 Russian language in other words five in the usual 

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:59.639
 school is meaningless 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:01.719
 however they cannot be avoided 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.719

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.919
 so as not to forget the native language 

00:07:09.919 --> 00:07:11.560
 and the fact that the native is the recipient even 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.009
 second language is already a plus 

00:07:14.009 --> 00:07:16.650
 every child on 5 6 years ago is close to 

00:07:16.650 --> 00:07:17.649

 thousands of migrant children 

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:32.680

 the education department sure 

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:39.480
 that could take much more 

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.669
 pupils only for some reason 

00:07:41.669 --> 00:07:43.719
