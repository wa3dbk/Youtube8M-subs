Orion<00:02:57.760> or<00:02:58.209> Cygnus<00:02:59.019> battle<00:02:59.859> stamina<00:03:00.870> so<00:03:01.870> let's

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
Orion or Cygnus battle stamina so let's

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.180 
Orion or Cygnus battle stamina so let's
see<00:03:03.359> if<00:03:04.359> you<00:03:04.989> can't<00:03:05.230> even<00:03:05.500> this<00:03:05.650> angle<00:03:06.010> cuz

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
see if you can't even this angle cuz

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.270 
see if you can't even this angle cuz
it's<00:03:06.340> from<00:03:06.489> the<00:03:06.609> camera<00:03:07.000> but<00:03:07.269> the<00:03:08.140> the<00:03:08.890> BG's

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
it's from the camera but the the BG's

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.670 
it's from the camera but the the BG's
not<00:03:09.489> working<00:03:09.940> so<00:03:10.120> well

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
not working so well

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.180 
not working so well
so<00:03:11.680> I'm<00:03:11.799> guessing<00:03:12.099> maybe<00:03:12.220> Cygnus<00:03:14.040> they<00:03:15.040> both

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:15.190 
so I'm guessing maybe Cygnus they both

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:19.520 
so I'm guessing maybe Cygnus they both
have<00:03:15.400> an<00:03:15.489> equal<00:03:15.760> to<00:03:15.849> point<00:03:15.940> chance<00:03:16.480> here<00:03:16.900> I
