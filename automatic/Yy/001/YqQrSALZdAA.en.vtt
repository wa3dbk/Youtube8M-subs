00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
if Jersey cells are any indication it

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.800 
if Jersey cells are any indication it
seems<00:00:26.490> like<00:00:26.699> they're<00:00:27.090> responding<00:00:27.630> pretty

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
seems like they're responding pretty

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.500 
seems like they're responding pretty
positively<00:00:28.500> so<00:00:29.130> Marc<00:00:29.730> of<00:00:29.910> course<00:00:30.179> there's

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:30.510 
positively so Marc of course there's

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:32.479 
positively so Marc of course there's
much<00:00:31.199> many<00:00:31.529> more<00:00:31.740> indicators<00:00:32.189> and<00:00:32.340> just

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
much many more indicators and just

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.150 
much many more indicators and just
jersey<00:00:32.880> cells<00:00:33.120> but<00:00:33.300> I<00:00:33.360> think<00:00:33.600> it's<00:00:33.750> quite

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
jersey cells but I think it's quite

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.319 
jersey cells but I think it's quite
impressive<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.190> they're<00:00:35.670> the<00:00:35.880> number<00:00:36.180> two

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
impressive that they're the number two

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.270 
impressive that they're the number two
selling<00:00:36.570> next<00:00:36.960> to<00:00:37.050> only<00:00:37.260> Johnny<00:00:37.770> Manziel

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
selling next to only Johnny Manziel

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.400 
selling next to only Johnny Manziel
who's<00:00:39.120> a<00:00:39.149> quarterback<00:00:39.690> and<00:00:39.870> was<00:00:39.989> drafted

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
who's a quarterback and was drafted

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.619 
who's a quarterback and was drafted
earlier<00:00:40.829> typically<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.969> jerseys<00:00:42.390> of

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
earlier typically the jerseys of

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.270 
earlier typically the jerseys of
quarterbacks<00:00:43.110> tend<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.530> sell<00:00:43.739> more<00:00:43.950> and

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
quarterbacks tend to sell more and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.160 
quarterbacks tend to sell more and
because<00:00:44.879> he<00:00:45.090> had<00:00:45.239> sort<00:00:45.450> of<00:00:45.480> some<00:00:45.660> lean<00:00:45.840> time<00:00:46.050> it

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
because he had sort of some lean time it

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.600 
because he had sort of some lean time it
makes<00:00:46.320> sense<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> he<00:00:46.739> would<00:00:46.860> sort<00:00:46.950> of<00:00:47.070> be<00:00:47.219> in

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
makes sense that he would sort of be in

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.560 
makes sense that he would sort of be in
first<00:00:47.969> place<00:00:48.149> as<00:00:48.480> opposed<00:00:48.809> to<00:00:48.930> Sam<00:00:49.829> so

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:50.570 
first place as opposed to Sam so

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.490 
first place as opposed to Sam so
hopefully<00:00:51.570> it's<00:00:51.690> an<00:00:51.780> indication<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:52.379> we're

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
hopefully it's an indication and we're

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.170 
hopefully it's an indication and we're
becoming<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.920> more<00:00:53.100> tolerant<00:00:53.309> society<00:00:54.030> and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
becoming a more tolerant society and

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.360 
becoming a more tolerant society and
people<00:00:54.390> want<00:00:54.600> to<00:00:54.660> send<00:00:55.230> that<00:00:55.320> message<00:00:55.649> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
people want to send that message you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.700 
people want to send that message you
don't<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:56.699> to<00:00:56.879> be<00:00:57.000> gay<00:00:57.360> to<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.930> know<00:00:58.109> be<00:00:58.440> in

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
teams because of certain rules and they

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.389 
teams because of certain rules and they
end<00:01:57.240> up<00:01:57.329> being<00:01:57.509> ostracized<00:01:57.990> or<00:01:58.590> hit<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:58.950> kicked

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
or things like that they end up being

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.800 
or things like that they end up being
sort<00:02:01.290> of<00:02:01.439> a<00:02:01.500> target<00:02:02.000> for<00:02:03.000> bullying<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.780> I

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
sort of a target for bullying so I

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:06.350 
sort of a target for bullying so I
wonder<00:02:04.229> if<00:02:04.259> any<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.340> might<00:02:05.549> happen<00:02:05.820> here

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
wonder if any of that might happen here

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:07.819 
wonder if any of that might happen here
or<00:02:06.540> is<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.689> you<00:02:06.840> know<00:02:06.960> they're<00:02:07.170> adults<00:02:07.439> they're

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
or is it you know they're adults they're

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:09.169 
or is it you know they're adults they're
could've<00:02:08.099> figured<00:02:08.310> out<00:02:08.550> they're<00:02:08.759> gonna<00:02:08.940> be

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
could've figured out they're gonna be

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.350 
could've figured out they're gonna be
fine<00:02:09.450> yeah<00:02:10.250> hopefully<00:02:11.250> we<00:02:11.700> fall<00:02:11.970> on<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> good

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
fine yeah hopefully we fall on the good

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.190 
fine yeah hopefully we fall on the good
side<00:02:12.510> of<00:02:12.629> this<00:02:12.750> is

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:13.200 
side of this is

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.710 
side of this is
probably<00:02:13.650> going<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.010> be<00:02:14.129> is<00:02:14.819> a<00:02:15.150> turn<00:02:15.510> the

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
probably going to be is a turn the

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.170 
probably going to be is a turn the
corner<00:02:16.020> situation<00:02:16.680> where<00:02:16.920> it<00:02:17.670> puts<00:02:17.970> it<00:02:18.090> in

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
corner situation where it puts it in

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:19.970 
corner situation where it puts it in
front<00:02:18.360> of<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.750> group<00:02:19.260> of<00:02:19.379> people<00:02:19.530> who<00:02:19.800> normally

by<00:02:54.870> coming<00:02:55.230> out<00:02:55.319> before<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.769> draft<00:02:56.040> he<00:02:57.000> may

about<00:03:11.700> it<00:03:11.849> but<00:03:11.970> there's<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.209> lot<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.510> money<00:03:12.660> at

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
about it but there's a lot of money at

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.080 
about it but there's a lot of money at
stake<00:03:12.870> and<00:03:13.290> he<00:03:13.410> may<00:03:13.920> have<00:03:14.040> turned<00:03:14.310> he<00:03:14.579> may<00:03:14.790> have

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
stake and he may have turned he may have

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.150 
stake and he may have turned he may have
turned<00:03:15.569> down<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.750> opportunity<00:03:15.810> at<00:03:16.440> millions

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
turned down the opportunity at millions

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.940 
turned down the opportunity at millions
of<00:03:17.340> more<00:03:17.519> dollars<00:03:17.780> because<00:03:18.780> of<00:03:18.840> this<00:03:19.230> so<00:03:19.769> he's

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
of more dollars because of this so he's

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.280 
of more dollars because of this so he's
taking<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.280> real<00:03:20.489> risk<00:03:20.700> yeah<00:03:21.660> and<00:03:21.900> I<00:03:21.989> think<00:03:22.170> it's

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
taking a real risk yeah and I think it's

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.080 
taking a real risk yeah and I think it's
also<00:03:22.440> a<00:03:22.590> calculated<00:03:23.250> risk<00:03:23.280> right<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.850> we<00:03:23.970> have

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:24.090 
also a calculated risk right so we have

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:27.259 
also a calculated risk right so we have
17<00:03:24.480> states<00:03:24.750> that<00:03:24.959> now<00:03:25.609> that<00:03:26.609> now<00:03:26.700> recognize

00:03:27.259 --> 00:03:27.269 
17 states that now that now recognize

00:03:27.269 --> 00:03:29.780 
17 states that now that now recognize
gay<00:03:27.540> marriage<00:03:27.959> and<00:03:28.260> so<00:03:28.829> and<00:03:29.250> that<00:03:29.400> seems<00:03:29.639> to<00:03:29.700> be

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
gay marriage and so and that seems to be

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.819 
gay marriage and so and that seems to be
changing<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.450> perhaps<00:03:30.630> is<00:03:30.959> the<00:03:31.170> right<00:03:31.350> time<00:03:31.590> to

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:31.829 
changing so perhaps is the right time to

00:03:31.829 --> 00:03:33.680 
changing so perhaps is the right time to
sort<00:03:31.980> of<00:03:32.069> push<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.819> a<00:03:32.880> little<00:03:33.060> bit<00:03:33.239> more<00:03:33.420> and<00:03:33.569> I

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
sort of push it a little bit more and I

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.000 
sort of push it a little bit more and I
think<00:03:33.959> you<00:03:34.139> he's<00:03:34.500> doing<00:03:34.709> something

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
think you he's doing something

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.430 
think you he's doing something
incredibly<00:03:35.519> brave<00:03:35.819> and<00:03:36.209> you<00:03:37.079> could<00:03:37.350> have

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
incredibly brave and you could have

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.289 
incredibly brave and you could have
kudos<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.889> him<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.579> let<00:03:38.819> us<00:03:38.850> know<00:03:39.060> your

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
kudos to him but let us know your

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:41.579 
thoughts on you know the jersey cells

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:42.770 
thoughts on you know the jersey cells
