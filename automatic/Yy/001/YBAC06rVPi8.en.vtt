this<00:02:18.680> portion<00:02:19.220> right<00:02:19.250> here<00:02:19.430> is<00:02:19.760> what<00:02:19.940> we<00:02:20.060> call

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
this portion right here is what we call

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.780 
this portion right here is what we call
the<00:02:20.510> valve<00:02:20.720> margin<00:02:21.470> as<00:02:21.620> it<00:02:22.400> gets<00:02:22.580> highlighted

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
the valve margin as it gets highlighted

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.260 
the valve margin as it gets highlighted
in<00:02:23.240> black<00:02:24.310> manufacturers<00:02:25.310> require<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.820> certain

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
in black manufacturers require a certain

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.470 
in black manufacturers require a certain
margin<00:02:26.900> so<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.130> it<00:02:28.250> still<00:02:28.520> has<00:02:28.760> enough<00:02:29.030> girth

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
margin so that it still has enough girth

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.050 
margin so that it still has enough girth
left<00:02:29.840> to<00:02:30.110> the<00:02:30.320> valve<00:02:30.560> to<00:02:30.860> absorb<00:02:31.430> heat<00:02:31.820> and

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
left to the valve to absorb heat and

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:36.220 
left to the valve to absorb heat and
dissipate<00:02:33.020> it<00:02:33.170> out<00:02:33.410> through<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.220> valve<00:02:35.230> seat

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
dissipate it out through the valve seat

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.740 
dissipate it out through the valve seat
area<00:02:36.700> this<00:02:37.700> is<00:02:37.880> what<00:02:38.030> they<00:02:38.150> call<00:02:38.300> the<00:02:38.510> valve

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
area this is what they call the valve

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:41.680 
area this is what they call the valve

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.650 
phase seat area in the cylinder head
it's<00:02:42.140> called<00:02:42.410> the<00:02:42.650> valve<00:02:42.920> seat<00:02:43.580> the<00:02:44.240> mating

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
it's called the valve seat the mating

it's called the valve seat the mating
surface<00:02:45.170> on<00:02:45.400> the<00:02:46.400> end<00:02:46.580> of<00:02:46.820> the<00:02:46.910> valve<00:02:47.470> we<00:02:48.470> have

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:48.740 
surface on the end of the valve we have

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:53.140 
surface on the end of the valve we have
our<00:02:49.090> tip<00:02:50.090> and<00:02:50.890> then<00:02:51.890> we<00:02:52.130> have<00:02:52.370> what<00:02:52.790> at<00:02:53.000> the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
our tip and then we have what at the

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.260 
our tip and then we have what at the
very<00:02:53.420> top<00:02:53.920> which<00:02:54.920> is<00:02:55.130> called<00:02:55.370> our<00:02:55.610> chamfer

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
very top which is called our chamfer

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.760 
very top which is called our chamfer
that<00:02:56.870> assists<00:02:57.470> in<00:02:57.970> preventing<00:02:59.650> chipping<00:03:00.650> of

thing<00:03:08.990> we<00:03:09.140> have<00:03:09.350> right<00:03:09.380> here<00:03:09.650> is<00:03:10.010> what's

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
thing we have right here is what's

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.790 
thing we have right here is what's
called<00:03:10.460> the<00:03:10.580> keeper<00:03:11.090> relief<00:03:11.570> this<00:03:12.140> area<00:03:12.590> in

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:12.800 
called the keeper relief this area in

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.060 
called the keeper relief this area in
here<00:03:13.780> that's<00:03:14.780> where<00:03:15.080> the<00:03:15.200> keeper<00:03:15.620> actually

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:16.070 
here that's where the keeper actually

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.150 
here that's where the keeper actually
locks<00:03:16.400> into<00:03:16.760> to<00:03:17.330> maintain<00:03:17.990> the<00:03:18.380> assembly

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:19.160 
locks into to maintain the assembly

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.520 
locks into to maintain the assembly
together<00:03:19.610> when<00:03:20.450> it's<00:03:20.630> put<00:03:20.870> back<00:03:20.900> into<00:03:21.350> the

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:21.530 
together when it's put back into the

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.250 
together when it's put back into the
engine<00:03:22.000> so<00:03:23.000> we<00:03:23.030> would<00:03:23.300> have<00:03:23.450> the<00:03:23.570> valve<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.080> the

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
engine so we would have the valve in the

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.740 
engine so we would have the valve in the
head<00:03:24.500> we'd<00:03:25.459> have<00:03:25.640> any<00:03:25.790> appropriate<00:03:26.450> shims

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:26.750 
head we'd have any appropriate shims

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:29.610 
head we'd have any appropriate shims
below<00:03:27.230> it<00:03:27.440> we<00:03:28.190> would<00:03:28.340> have<00:03:28.550> the<00:03:28.850> valve<00:03:29.090> guide

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:29.620 
below it we would have the valve guide

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:33.670 
below it we would have the valve guide
