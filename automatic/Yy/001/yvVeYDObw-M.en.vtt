00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:26.310 
stick it over like that and you can pull

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.240 
stick it over like that and you can pull
water<00:03:26.600> well<00:03:27.600> I<00:03:27.959> filled<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.620> top<00:03:28.860> and<00:03:29.160> it

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:29.250 
water well I filled it to the top and it

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.430 
water well I filled it to the top and it
took<00:03:29.430> probably<00:03:29.580> about<00:03:29.880> 10<00:03:30.180> minutes<00:03:30.390> it<00:03:31.110> didn't

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
took probably about 10 minutes it didn't

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.860 
took probably about 10 minutes it didn't
pull<00:03:31.560> it<00:03:31.590> all<00:03:31.800> the<00:03:31.830> way<00:03:31.980> but<00:03:32.940> it<00:03:33.090> had<00:03:33.480> bubbles

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
pull it all the way but it had bubbles

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.949 
pull it all the way but it had bubbles
in<00:03:34.470> the<00:03:34.560> Jemez<00:03:34.800> this<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.310> made<00:03:36.000> some<00:03:36.030> metal<00:03:36.840> it

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
in the Jemez this I made some metal it

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.830 
in the Jemez this I made some metal it
out<00:03:37.140> of<00:03:37.260> 10<00:03:37.470> full<00:03:37.760> cover<00:03:38.760> that<00:03:38.940> up<00:03:39.090> clamp<00:03:39.750> it

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
out of 10 full cover that up clamp it

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.330 
out of 10 full cover that up clamp it
down<00:03:39.900> at<00:03:40.230> bowl<00:03:40.440> it<00:03:40.620> in<00:03:40.709> less<00:03:40.890> than<00:03:41.070> 10<00:03:41.310> minutes

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:41.340 
down at bowl it in less than 10 minutes

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:46.720 
down at bowl it in less than 10 minutes
so<00:03:42.230> really<00:03:43.230> really<00:03:43.650> cheap<00:03:44.480> lightweight<00:03:45.650> kit

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
so really really cheap lightweight kit

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:53.840 
so really really cheap lightweight kit
but<00:03:47.730> if<00:03:47.850> you<00:03:47.970> want<00:03:48.120> to<00:03:48.269> go<00:03:48.480> even<00:03:48.720> lighter<00:03:52.850> you

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:53.850 
but if you want to go even lighter you

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.080 
but if you want to go even lighter you
can<00:03:54.030> do<00:03:55.580> stove<00:03:56.690> the<00:03:57.690> titanium<00:03:58.560> stove<00:03:58.800> I've<00:03:59.090> had

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:00.090 
can do stove the titanium stove I've had

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:03.660 
can do stove the titanium stove I've had
a<00:04:00.120> video<00:04:00.450> on<00:04:00.570> this<00:04:00.720> before<00:04:01.310> vargo<00:04:02.570> stone

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:03.670 
a video on this before vargo stone

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:10.710 
a video on this before vargo stone
of<00:04:04.020> the<00:04:05.020> legs<00:04:05.230> this<00:04:06.190> is<00:04:06.340> a<00:04:07.050> great<00:04:08.050> piece<00:04:09.720> is

of the legs this is a great piece is

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.370 
of the legs this is a great piece is
probably<00:04:10.959> what<00:04:11.290> I'll<00:04:11.440> be<00:04:11.560> backpacking<00:04:11.800> with

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:13.380 
probably what I'll be backpacking with

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:15.809 
probably what I'll be backpacking with

this soup can that a little chilly came
in<00:04:25.690> it<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:25.960> cut<00:04:26.919> the<00:04:27.040> top<00:04:27.250> off<00:04:27.430> where<00:04:28.389> you<00:04:28.480> can

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:28.630 
in it and cut the top off where you can

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.450 
in it and cut the top off where you can
put<00:04:29.470> it<00:04:29.560> back<00:04:29.620> on<00:04:30.030> just<00:04:31.030> standard<00:04:31.780> size<00:04:31.990> can

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460 
put it back on just standard size can

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.310 
put it back on just standard size can
and<00:04:33.460> this<00:04:34.950> fits<00:04:35.950> in<00:04:36.160> that<00:04:36.190> really<00:04:36.610> good<00:04:37.320> that

and this fits in that really good that
way<00:04:38.440> the<00:04:38.560> flames<00:04:38.830> will<00:04:39.040> come<00:04:39.220> up<00:04:39.310> around<00:04:39.490> it

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
way the flames will come up around it

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.100 
way the flames will come up around it
and<00:04:40.410> now<00:04:41.410> I've<00:04:41.560> bold<00:04:41.889> water<00:04:42.190> and<00:04:42.520> this<00:04:42.760> in<00:04:43.180> five

and compact and you can also put your
wind<00:04:54.340> screen<00:04:54.850> around<00:04:55.060> it<00:04:55.240> made<00:04:55.389> out<00:04:55.510> of<00:04:55.600> 10

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:55.810 
wind screen around it made out of 10

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:01.020 
wind screen around it made out of 10
full<00:04:56.760> make<00:04:57.760> it<00:04:57.910> go<00:04:58.030> faster<00:04:58.540> go<00:04:58.810> faster<00:04:59.850> so<00:05:00.850> this

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:01.030 
full make it go faster go faster so this

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:11.520 
full make it go faster go faster so this
is<00:05:01.060> just<00:05:01.419> some<00:05:01.800> options<00:05:05.490> yeah<00:05:07.140> you<00:05:08.140> can<00:05:08.320> do<00:05:10.530> all
