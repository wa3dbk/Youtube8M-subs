00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 healthy today show you cool 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 focus prediction we take very 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.730
 prediction and put aside 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.690
 ask the viewer to put your hand on not on 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.910
 this card makes no difference that the phone and 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:18.000
 take the deck itself show the viewer that 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.910
 we have all the cards are different 54 pieces including 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:26.430
 two jokers and ask the viewer to make a guess 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:30.929
 any number from 1 to 54 any for example 13 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:34.739
 We look carefully time two three 4 5 6 7 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:38.730
 8 9 10 11 12 13 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.969
 all these cards I save here that is 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.579
 we see them these cards we have them here 13 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.210
 pieces and look carefully here are ours 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:52.739
 lady rush predictions see what we have 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 here here we have the same lady peak here 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.360
 guys are 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.820
 cool focus everyone thanks for your attention 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.440
 but now we are learning that is he on 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.739
 really very simple 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.740
 you do not need any there super technician 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:12.119
 over the skills just need the usual 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.380
 a deck of cards is desirable of course 2 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:16.259
 deck of cards 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.409
 so that we have a map as a prediction 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.900
 or the card itself is a deck with which we will 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.200
 turn the whole fraud of course 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:27.240
 you can write on a piece of paper put 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.470
 somewhere under the table you give the viewer 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.200
 hold this leaf 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.000
 but it seems to me it is not so effect it 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.310
 the same effect will be me for example more 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.770
 I like it from the card when the viewer 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.750
 feel this card at hand when he 

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:43.409
 thinking about now might not work yet 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:46.290
 after all 54 cards and from there to 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:50.610
 so this is of course difficult but how 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.450
 we see everything we get we choose with 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.780
 one deck 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.700
 here is such a lady rush you can choose 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.189
 any card 

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.600
 and still take from this deck exactly the same 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:06.270
 lady peak this card we turn over well 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:08.810
 and here we take and glue here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.180
 top double-sided tape 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:16.530
 that is, we see here it is a little bit quite 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:22.050
 for the effect for this is not much needed 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:24.090
 just take the frame deck show 

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:26.220
 prediction that but here we go nowhere 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.390
 don't do for example our hand here 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.730
 lies all ask the viewer to guess any 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:36.690
 number we show the usual deck of cards 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.750
 and the audience says for example 17 then 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:45.720
 please we count two two three 4 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:52.110
 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 and 17 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:54.690
 we put the card on top of all of us all 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.329
 focus took place on top of us 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:03:02.269
 Random card is 4 worms and queen of spades 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:05.370
 It turns out here in this layout 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.310
 so as not to burn here that compress 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.019
 cards so they stick together we make 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.940
 such a 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.579
 seems to be the usual movement but in reality 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.940
 actually we glue together the two cards that have 

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:21.900
 we have a lady peak and we crush a finger in 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:26.519
 center and just draw the map here 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:30.180
 as if her all pulled together from the deck 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:32.639
 and showed everything is ready we have effect 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.280
 turned out super as we see here 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:37.470
 no equipment you just need 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.200
 take a deck if you even took a novice 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:43.079
 a deck glued from the top that scotch and 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:46.349
 show no need to cram there 

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:49.410
 any circuit techniques there all 

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:52.410
 simply enough in what plus what 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:56.030
 you can easily put this card to 

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:58.799
 you can pocket this card 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:04:01.139
 put another pocket well here they are 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.780
 pockets posed and show with this 

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:06.750
 deck 

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:09.090
 any tricks you want to show 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:13.880
 showed showed gave for example the viewer 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:17.340
 also shuffle the deck but it costs and 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:19.650
 then later you say i have 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:23.070
 right pocket predictions yourself in 

00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.600
 on the left you take this lady carite from above and you 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:30.630
 start showing this focus 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.880
 all here is such a trick everyone thanks for 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.180
 attention subscribe new meet and 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.180
 until
