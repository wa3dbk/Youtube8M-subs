00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:14.350
 hello very good friends to all 

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:17.020
 Welcome to a new tutorial 

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.820
 minecraft good what today I'm going to 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:21.430
 to teach today is to make a small trap 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.810
 for mods and good what they will need 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.140
 it is earth 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:30.349
 reddish stone torches dishes 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.180
 normal piston pressure and already a 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.449
 material you want can be pebble 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.059
 stone I do not know what you want well as 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:42.320
 I said let's make a square of 4 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:44.630
 x 4 something like what I'm going to do 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.930
 we break the blocks like this until we make a 

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.080
 square 4 x 4 well here is a 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:53.870
 hole down and just covered it 

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:55.579
 you then there accommodate it and well I'll 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.110
 to replace these sand blocks by 

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.220
 earth blocks so you see a 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.140
 little better something like that 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.790
 we put all the blocks for 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:06.490
 provision in addition 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:09.580
 and ready well now what follows is 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.980
 break the corners of the square something 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.140
 so we will be left with two of 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.200
 depth the corners and in them 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.330
 we put good reddish stone torches 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.070
 Here, as I say, I had one myself 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.260
 just covered it and put the 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:27.070
 reddish stone torches 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.720
 we put the other here and here well what 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.120
 follow is to put the material you want 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.370
 in between either pebble or earth what 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:36.280
 be and then above the torches 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.750
 let's put normal pistons 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.840
 that they are turning like this up 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:44.450
 something like that in all the corners we put 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.670
 a normal piston does not have to be 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.190
 adhesive if it does not lower the structure and 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.990
 then it will go wrong or good 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.960
 then we put pressure plates in 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 medium in the pebble blocks and now 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.910
 we put the normal pistons in the 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.000
 blocks that are left over something like 

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:03.490
 I'm putting myself 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.590
 and so ok now what we are going to 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:08.160
 make a structure of a structure 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.740
 square above the trap 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:15.060
 You can see it here as I do it 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:16.470
 of 4x4 in height of three 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.480
 that's where they're going to do it so that 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.760
 new people are trapped and can not 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.710
 get out and well what would be the trap already 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.080
 is done now it's time to approve it for 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:27.720
 Well, to see if it works and show them 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.319
 a little bit of what it is then I go to 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.439
 wait for it to be night 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:35.469
 Well friends, it's already night and 

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:38.030
 I'm going to show you how the trap works 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:40.340
 I'm going to appear here a zombie for 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.889
 show them a small example of how 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.590
 it works we hit it and we make it 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:47.180
 tell the zombie just do not go to 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.939
 get in if they are not going to fall on their own 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.579
 trap as well as they see the zombie there 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:55.280
 he is trapped he can not go well anymore 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.250
 now what follows is to attack it already 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.989
 kill him and take away all the experience 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.999
 something like that we give as you see then no longer 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:03.620
 It comes out if it tries to attack us because it's not going 

00:03:01.999 --> 00:03:06.530
 to come out this can be done also with 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.689
 creepers sometimes spiders out 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:12.859
 but almost always if they stay there is no 

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:15.169
 stuck well then they kill the zombie you 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:18.349
 they take away the experience and the pistons are 

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:19.699
 go back to work as soon as you remember 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.609
 they get trapped because they have to 

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:24.409
 break the pistons and put them back 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:26.359
 and well, this on my part would be everything 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.280
 I am the scene and I hope it serves you 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:29.810
