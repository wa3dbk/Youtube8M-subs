00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
the SD card because a lot of people

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:33.770 
the SD card because a lot of people
extract<00:02:31.140> it<00:02:31.410> and<00:02:31.640> put<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.670> wrong<00:02:32.970> files<00:02:33.420> and

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.740 
extract it and put the wrong files and
then<00:02:33.900> they<00:02:34.410> mess<00:02:34.650> up<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.880> like<00:02:36.239> I<00:02:36.300> said<00:02:36.480> in<00:02:36.720> the

then they mess up so like I said in the
beginning<00:02:36.959> I'm<00:02:37.680> not<00:02:37.920> held<00:02:38.220> responsible<00:02:38.459> if

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
beginning I'm not held responsible if

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.360 
beginning I'm not held responsible if
you<00:02:39.330> do<00:02:39.420> not<00:02:39.780> listen<00:02:40.050> right<00:02:40.410> and<00:02:40.650> do<00:02:40.980> something

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:24.680 
card in the battery slot the reason why

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.040 
card in the battery slot the reason why
I<00:03:24.710> focused<00:03:25.610> on<00:03:25.760> this<00:03:25.970> was<00:03:26.210> because<00:03:26.390> you<00:03:26.780> need

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:27.050 
I focused on this was because you need

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.140 
I focused on this was because you need
to<00:03:27.080> have<00:03:27.350> a<00:03:27.410> micro<00:03:27.770> SD<00:03:27.830> card<00:03:28.400> because<00:03:28.790> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
to have a micro SD card because the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.240 
to have a micro SD card because the
internal<00:03:29.690> storage<00:03:30.110> is<00:03:30.260> not<00:03:30.680> as<00:03:30.860> good<00:03:31.100> as

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
internal storage is not as good as

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.000 
internal storage is not as good as
finding<00:03:31.460> the<00:03:31.940> ROM<00:03:32.600> as<00:03:32.810> you<00:03:32.930> want<00:03:33.140> so<00:03:33.680> then<00:03:33.860> once

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.010 
finding the ROM as you want so then once

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.540 
finding the ROM as you want so then once
you<00:03:34.160> have<00:03:34.370> it<00:03:34.520> in<00:03:34.670> just<00:03:35.420> close<00:03:35.660> your<00:03:35.690> phone
