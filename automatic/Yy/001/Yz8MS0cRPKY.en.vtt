00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
cuz I'm there's going to be a large

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.340 
cuz I'm there's going to be a large
selection<00:02:32.110> of<00:02:32.500> weapons<00:02:33.030> costumes<00:02:34.050> like<00:02:35.050> easy

access<00:02:35.860> like<00:02:36.100> that<00:02:36.370> and<00:02:36.670> then<00:02:38.280> what<00:02:39.280> I<00:02:39.310> also

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:39.760 
access like that and then what I also

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:41.100 
access like that and then what I also
think<00:02:40.150> they're<00:02:40.360> going<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.569> be<00:02:40.690> able<00:02:40.780> to<00:02:40.959> do

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
think they're going to be able to do

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.550 
think they're going to be able to do
with<00:02:41.260> gamepad<00:02:41.739> is<00:02:41.799> on<00:02:42.370> other<00:02:43.360> systems<00:02:43.750> they're

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:44.560 
with gamepad is on other systems they're

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:50.280 
with gamepad is on other systems they're
making<00:02:45.010> a<00:02:46.380> ipad<00:02:47.640> multiplayer<00:02:49.290> connection

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
making a ipad multiplayer connection

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.729 
making a ipad multiplayer connection
where<00:02:51.390> if<00:02:52.390> someone<00:02:52.630> has<00:02:52.810> an<00:02:52.959> ipad<00:02:53.350> and<00:02:53.650> they

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
where if someone has an ipad and they

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.060 
where if someone has an ipad and they
have<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.220> app<00:02:55.140> they<00:02:56.140> can<00:02:56.410> connect<00:02:56.829> with

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.070 
have the app they can connect with

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:00.060 
have the app they can connect with
someone<00:02:57.280> who<00:02:57.400> has<00:02:57.549> the<00:02:57.670> game<00:02:57.910> i<00:02:58.180> think<00:02:59.140> it

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:00.070 
someone who has the game i think it

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.430 
someone who has the game i think it
would<00:03:00.190> be<00:03:00.250> neat<00:03:00.549> if<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:01.660> made<00:03:01.840> a<00:03:01.870> multiplayer

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
would be neat if they made a multiplayer

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:04.380 
would be neat if they made a multiplayer
mode<00:03:02.709> that<00:03:02.920> was<00:03:03.130> like<00:03:03.340> on<00:03:03.519> the<00:03:03.730> wii<00:03:03.850> u<00:03:04.060> only

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:04.390 
mode that was like on the wii u only

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:07.080 
mode that was like on the wii u only
where<00:03:05.290> someone<00:03:05.769> could<00:03:06.010> have<00:03:06.130> the<00:03:06.340> gamepad<00:03:06.880> and

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
where someone could have the gamepad and

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.740 
where someone could have the gamepad and
the<00:03:07.480> other<00:03:07.660> player<00:03:07.989> has<00:03:08.019> like<00:03:08.859> let's<00:03:09.549> say<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:10.750 
the other player has like let's say the

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.550 
the other player has like let's say the
game<00:03:11.350> controller<00:03:11.769> pro<00:03:12.070> and<00:03:13.140> the<00:03:14.140> person<00:03:14.530> with

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
game controller pro and the person with

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.699 
game controller pro and the person with
the<00:03:14.680> gamepad<00:03:15.280> it<00:03:15.670> basically<00:03:16.269> can<00:03:16.959> do<00:03:17.140> anything

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
the gamepad it basically can do anything

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:20.610 
the gamepad it basically can do anything
like<00:03:18.459> with<00:03:18.840> someone<00:03:19.840> would<00:03:20.019> be<00:03:20.200> able<00:03:20.230> to<00:03:20.500> do

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
like with someone would be able to do

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.800 
like with someone would be able to do
with<00:03:20.829> an<00:03:20.980> ipad<00:03:22.170> but<00:03:23.170> it's<00:03:24.180> just<00:03:25.180> more

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
with an ipad but it's just more

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.520 
with an ipad but it's just more
convenient<00:03:26.260> and<00:03:27.150> it<00:03:28.150> would<00:03:28.959> probably<00:03:29.200> be<00:03:29.500> a

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
convenient and it would probably be a

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:32.550 
convenient and it would probably be a
little<00:03:29.709> bit<00:03:29.920> faster<00:03:30.810> because<00:03:31.810> it's<00:03:32.290> all

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
little bit faster because it's all

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:37.349 
little bit faster because it's all
connected<00:03:32.859> in<00:03:33.280> one<00:03:33.670> system<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:36.150> yeah<00:03:37.150> that

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:37.359 
connected in one system and yeah that

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:38.400 
connected in one system and yeah that
sounds<00:03:37.600> like<00:03:37.690> a<00:03:37.720> really<00:03:37.810> cool<00:03:38.230> idea

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
sounds like a really cool idea

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.319 
sounds like a really cool idea
especially<00:03:39.070> if<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.519> look<00:03:39.670> at<00:03:39.820> even<00:03:40.000> what<00:03:40.239> they

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.329 
especially if you look at even what they

00:03:40.329 --> 00:03:43.440 
especially if you look at even what they
did<00:03:40.480> with<00:03:40.570> most<00:03:40.810> wanted<00:03:41.170> you<00:03:41.489> they<00:03:42.489> made<00:03:42.700> the

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
did with most wanted you they made the

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:46.050 
did with most wanted you they made the
two<00:03:44.230> sort<00:03:44.680> of<00:03:44.769> two<00:03:44.890> sets<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.310> controllers<00:03:45.730> to

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:46.060 
two sort of two sets of controllers to

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:48.750 
two sort of two sets of controllers to
where<00:03:46.239> you<00:03:46.930> know<00:03:47.049> someone<00:03:47.739> can<00:03:47.980> play<00:03:48.250> with<00:03:48.549> the

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
the pro controller and someone can use

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.770 
the pro controller and someone can use

things like that side I feel like since
ubisoft<00:04:07.980> is<00:04:08.159> the<00:04:08.250> same<00:04:08.430> company<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:08.879> design

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
ubisoft is the same company to design

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.330 
ubisoft is the same company to design
that<00:04:09.390> i<00:04:09.599> feel<00:04:10.140> like<00:04:10.260> it<00:04:10.379> maybe<00:04:10.560> I<00:04:10.739> mean<00:04:11.069> they

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:11.340 
that i feel like it maybe I mean they

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.550 
that i feel like it maybe I mean they
already<00:04:11.519> sort<00:04:11.849> of<00:04:11.970> know<00:04:12.150> how<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:12.870> gamepad

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
already sort of know how the gamepad

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.310 
already sort of know how the gamepad
functions<00:04:14.549> with<00:04:14.730> the<00:04:14.819> game<00:04:15.060> and<00:04:15.360> I<00:04:16.049> think

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
functions with the game and I think

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.620 
functions with the game and I think
though<00:04:16.560> that<00:04:16.799> it'll<00:04:17.280> I'm<00:04:17.519> sure<00:04:18.329> will<00:04:18.540> be

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
though that it'll I'm sure will be

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.719

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:37.200 
takes longer as they did with most one

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:38.930 
takes longer as they did with most one
of<00:05:37.320> you<00:05:37.440> as<00:05:37.560> well<00:05:37.740> they<00:05:38.010> took<00:05:38.190> you<00:05:38.580> know<00:05:38.669> extra

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
time to separately make sure that the

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.950 
time to separately make sure that the
game<00:05:40.590> was<00:05:40.830> the<00:05:40.889> best<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.490> could<00:05:41.580> be<00:05:41.810> into<00:05:42.810> the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
game was the best it could be into the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.270 
game was the best it could be into the
highest<00:05:43.169> you<00:05:43.680> know<00:05:43.800> capable

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
highest you know capable

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.970 
highest you know capable
that<00:05:45.000> we<00:05:45.150> currently<00:05:45.389> know<00:05:45.660> about<00:05:46.530> the<00:05:46.710> wii<00:05:46.830> u

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
that we currently know about the wii u

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.379 
that we currently know about the wii u
and<00:05:47.010> i<00:05:47.340> think<00:05:47.550> that's<00:05:47.700> really<00:05:47.850> remarkable

00:05:48.379 --> 00:05:48.389 
and i think that's really remarkable

00:05:48.389 --> 00:05:52.610 
and i think that's really remarkable
that<00:05:48.900> they<00:05:49.050> do<00:05:49.110> that<00:05:49.440> you<00:05:50.430> so<00:05:51.410> basically<00:05:52.410> to

00:05:52.610 --> 00:05:52.620 
that they do that you so basically to

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:57.710 
that they do that you so basically to
wrap<00:05:52.800> it<00:05:53.010> up<00:05:53.130> that<00:05:53.910> uh<00:05:54.020> i<00:05:56.150> predicted<00:05:57.150> that

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720 
wrap it up that uh i predicted that

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.909 
wrap it up that uh i predicted that
watch<00:05:58.290> dogs<00:05:58.320> will<00:05:58.889> come<00:05:59.070> out<00:05:59.250> in<00:05:59.400> a<00:05:59.850> range<00:06:00.330> of

00:06:00.909 --> 00:06:00.919 
watch dogs will come out in a range of

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
date that was scheduled for last year

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:15.290 
date that was scheduled for last year
but<00:06:11.040> then<00:06:11.100> they<00:06:13.250> removed<00:06:14.250> the<00:06:14.340> back<00:06:14.639> a<00:06:14.669> year<00:06:15.060> I

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
but then they removed the back a year I

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.909 
but then they removed the back a year I
feel<00:06:15.780> like<00:06:16.020> they're<00:06:16.200> just<00:06:16.410> gonna<00:06:16.560> go<00:06:16.770> to<00:06:16.800> that

00:06:16.909 --> 00:06:16.919 
feel like they're just gonna go to that

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.690 
feel like they're just gonna go to that
date<00:06:17.400> for<00:06:18.300> the<00:06:18.390> riu<00:06:18.810> I<00:06:19.190> don't<00:06:20.190> think<00:06:20.340> they

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
date for the riu I don't think they

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:22.070 
date for the riu I don't think they
would<00:06:20.850> risk<00:06:21.060> it<00:06:21.330> all<00:06:21.480> the<00:06:21.630> way<00:06:21.750> into<00:06:21.930> the

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:22.080 
would risk it all the way into the
