00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:51.870 
one is to make the transformation a

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:55.100 
one is to make the transformation a
little<00:06:52.169> bit<00:06:52.290> more<00:06:53.010> like<00:06:53.250> in<00:06:53.430> the<00:06:53.520> movie<00:06:54.110> not

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
little bit more like in the movie not

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.760 
little bit more like in the movie not
like<00:06:55.320> the<00:06:55.530> boiler<00:06:55.919> one<00:06:56.100> which<00:06:56.700> is<00:06:56.880> cool<00:06:57.180> but<00:06:57.389> I

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
like the boiler one which is cool but I

like the boiler one which is cool but I
wanna<00:06:58.770> see<00:06:59.100> this<00:06:59.370> guy<00:06:59.430> more<00:07:00.090> realistic<00:07:00.660> this

is<00:07:01.430> more<00:07:02.430> metallic<00:07:03.320> so<00:07:04.320> I<00:07:04.970> think<00:07:05.970> it<00:07:06.419> will<00:07:06.479> be

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:06.660 
is more metallic so I think it will be

00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:10.520 
is more metallic so I think it will be
very<00:07:06.810> cool<00:07:07.139> I<00:07:07.729> will<00:07:08.729> be<00:07:08.940> working<00:07:09.180> on<00:07:09.479> it<00:07:09.630> soon

00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:10.530 
very cool I will be working on it soon

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:17.660 
revealing and my version of iron Heights

00:07:17.660 --> 00:07:20.600 
revealing and my version of iron Heights
so<00:07:18.660> I<00:07:18.690> already<00:07:18.840> cut<00:07:19.320> the<00:07:19.560> alternate<00:07:19.979> mode<00:07:20.160> here

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:20.610 
so I already cut the alternate mode here

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:25.060 
so I already cut the alternate mode here
and<00:07:21.830> it's<00:07:22.830> time<00:07:23.040> to<00:07:23.070> work<00:07:23.370> on<00:07:23.669> this<00:07:23.910> cigar

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:25.070 
and it's time to work on this cigar

00:07:25.070 --> 00:07:29.029 
and it's time to work on this cigar
so<00:07:26.070> until<00:07:26.520> then<00:07:26.729> until<00:07:27.720> my<00:07:27.960> next<00:07:28.020> review<00:07:28.350> this
