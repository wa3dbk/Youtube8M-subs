00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:08.240
 Y 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.779
 good but soon 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.210
 action 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.350
 to do to hunt other aircraft in 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:31.990
 the air for us 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:36.870
 the pilots of the air force flew to 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:39.420
 2029 in the aspiration that we have 

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.100
 with a maximum speed of 2,400 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.290
 kilometers per hour capacity for 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.510
 maneuvering to 9 gravity is and a complete 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.640
 weapon system it's no wonder that 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.500
 pilot this warship be a 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.500
 uppercase challenge for hunters 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:57.640
 the airplane my 29 is a designed aircraft and 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.830
 built integrally in the former union 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.140
 Soviet on the right we have a 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.100
 configuration of four missiles 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.270
 infrared r 73 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:10.369
 which gives us a tactical advantage in 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:13.819
 close air combat within the 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:15.470
 visual range before flying only those 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.510
 pilots who wish to join the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.910
 squadron of 1.029 based in chiclayo 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:22.400
 they must go through two months of instruction 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.989
 theoretical learning each and every one 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.970
 of the parts of the ship then 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:29.190
 they experience on the ground what is capable 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:31.840
 to do using a simulator 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.960
 we are in the facilities of the 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:37.720
 simulator of 1,029 where the pilots of 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.950
 squadron of 612 fighters continue their 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:42.050
 preparation 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.940
 the most experienced pilots use 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:47.920
 also the simulator continuously as 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:47.920
 the best way to stay cool 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.620
 canceled you can make one of 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:58.390
 multiple emergencies is super critical 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.340
 How to finish sales is very simple 

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:02.830
 for me 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.480
 and we even ask for authorization 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:06.280
 to fly in the simulator 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.280
 the takeoff is simple and the flight 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:11.280
 pleasant how difficult is the landing 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.360
 yes 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.709
 and after having crashed a couple 

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.510
 of times we get an idea of ​​what 

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.610
 difficult that it should be the combat flight 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.380
 for this is that the pilots prepare 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.720
 In addition to knowledge and skill 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:35.940
 account here the physical resistance for 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.480
 withstand the maneuvers and pressure of 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.480
 the gravity 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:44.010
 if I had the first time and exercise 

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:49.049
 news suddenly you would not know what how 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:51.269
 act equally as a majority for that reason without 

00:03:49.049 --> 00:03:53.099
 pretexts in the midday heat all 

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:55.620
 the base without exception is seen short 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.470
 it is the hour of the healthy mind in body 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:04:00.750
 healthy all this adds up to the time of being 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.400
 in the air a pilot of 1,029 is not 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.739
 attentive only to himself and to 

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:07.590
 enemy but also to their environment in 

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.629
 combat take care of the partner or forward 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:11.400
 it becomes as important as taking care of yourself 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:13.290
 same 

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:16.680
 we define ourselves in two words 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:19.590
 mutual support I protect you and protect me 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.410
 to fulfill the objective that is to beat the 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:23.940
 adversary the pilots of 1,029 will 

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.160
 They keep in constant training and 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.530
 training the only way as well 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.270
 it is known is continuously flying by 

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:32.190
 they were the most enthusiastic when 

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:34.590
 They knew that Peru would be the seat of 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:37.020
 the exercises to the condor is that the 

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:39.150
 1,000 and the Peruvian mirage would have the 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:43.759
 opportunity to measure yourself as a rival of 

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:43.759
 its size the North American f16 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:48.210
 the officers do not tell us who won 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:52.160
 the war games although the pride 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.160
 be translated into the smile 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.719
 we have been able to demonstrate 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.539
 that we can be as professional as 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:05:01.129
 any force in the world is the same 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.870
 pride that comes out when they show 

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:05.180
 the visitors one of the treasures of the 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:07.340
 base chiclayana the room in which jose 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:10.099
 Abelardo Quiñones Hero Max of the 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.930
 air force spent his pilot years today 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.930
 that room is a museum 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:20.710
 this is a replica of the uniform he wore 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:23.979
 our hero and it's called uniform of 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:26.110
 work has not changed much as 

00:05:23.979 --> 00:05:28.350
 we are acting using currently 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:28.350
 we 

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:36.520
 replica of how good we use our 

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.380
 hero also quite different from 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.470
 less than the pilots of 

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.470
 combat 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:46.390
 the pilots of the 29 are in the first 

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:48.010
 line of national defense a line 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.930
 that not only depends on the new and well 

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:51.610
 aircraft that are maintained as 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:53.350
 in the preparation and commitment of 

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:56.430
 men who make up is the key 

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:56.430
 of your strength 

00:05:58.010 --> 00:06:04.650
 the good level of human capital with the 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.100
 what we have and have also seen how 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:11.250
 they have been able to raise the degree of 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:13.290
 operability of our aircraft and that 

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:16.050
 we continue in this recovery task 

00:06:13.290 --> 00:06:19.020
 because our aviation has to get there 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:22.440
 to have the magnificent seat that before 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:25.290
 knot and this government is in the 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.430
 understood and in the task of that 

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:28.740
 Recovery 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:30.930
 that's why I congratulate you and we are in the 

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:33.060
 correct path and we will have strength 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:38.030
 armed forces that are dissuasive is 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:38.030
 showing that there is a high content 

00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:45.290
 new technological degree that makes us 

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:47.550
 have confidence in the capacities in the 

00:06:45.290 --> 00:06:49.350
 training and in the delivery of 

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:52.160
 our armed forces our 

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.160
 gratitude to her
