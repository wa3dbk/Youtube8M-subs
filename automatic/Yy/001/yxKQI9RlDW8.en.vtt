okay<00:00:10.400> step<00:00:10.730> six<00:00:11.090> is<00:00:11.420> cutting<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:12.230> glass<00:00:12.380> so

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:13.220 
okay step six is cutting the glass so

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.060 
okay step six is cutting the glass so
most<00:00:13.700> important<00:00:14.240> and<00:00:14.600> this<00:00:14.780> is<00:00:15.290> actually<00:00:15.860> your

00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:16.070 
most important and this is actually your

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:18.100 
most important and this is actually your
safety<00:00:16.430> glasses<00:00:16.550> wear<00:00:17.240> them<00:00:17.450> at<00:00:17.570> all<00:00:17.779> times

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:18.110 
safety glasses wear them at all times

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:20.560 
safety glasses wear them at all times
the<00:00:18.529> glass<00:00:18.770> can<00:00:19.160> shard<00:00:19.580> and<00:00:20.000> you<00:00:20.210> don't<00:00:20.420> want

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:20.570 
the glass can shard and you don't want

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:23.170 
the glass can shard and you don't want
stuff<00:00:20.779> in<00:00:20.930> your<00:00:21.080> eyes<00:00:21.230> so<00:00:22.040> I<00:00:22.310> use<00:00:22.550> the<00:00:22.790> Morton

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:23.180 
stuff in your eyes so I use the Morton

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:25.499 
stuff in your eyes so I use the Morton
system<00:00:23.720> again<00:00:24.020> I<00:00:24.050> love<00:00:24.560> this<00:00:24.800> cutting<00:00:25.460> board

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:25.509 
system again I love this cutting board

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:28.900 
system again I love this cutting board
there's<00:00:26.509> all<00:00:26.840> these<00:00:27.050> nice<00:00:27.290> little<00:00:27.400> holes<00:00:28.400> and

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
there's all these nice little holes and

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.060 
there's all these nice little holes and
grids<00:00:29.210> so<00:00:29.630> that<00:00:29.779> you<00:00:29.900> can<00:00:30.110> line<00:00:30.320> things<00:00:30.619> up<00:00:30.829> and

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
grids so that you can line things up and

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.700 
grids so that you can line things up and
all<00:00:31.430> the<00:00:31.700> little<00:00:32.180> bits<00:00:32.329> of<00:00:32.570> glass<00:00:32.780> fall<00:00:33.200> into

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.710 
all the little bits of glass fall into

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.340 
all the little bits of glass fall into
it<00:00:33.860> I've<00:00:34.280> used<00:00:34.640> other<00:00:35.030> things<00:00:35.570> prior<00:00:36.050> to

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:36.350 
it I've used other things prior to

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.319 
it I've used other things prior to
discovering<00:00:37.070> this<00:00:37.220> but<00:00:37.489> I<00:00:37.520> would<00:00:37.820> say<00:00:38.000> this<00:00:38.149> is

00:00:38.319 --> 00:00:38.329 
discovering this but I would say this is

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.120 
discovering this but I would say this is
the<00:00:38.360> best<00:00:38.660> if<00:00:38.899> you<00:00:38.930> could<00:00:39.230> if<00:00:39.710> you<00:00:39.860> can<00:00:40.010> get

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:40.130 
the best if you could if you can get

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:42.279 
the best if you could if you can get
your<00:00:40.280> hands<00:00:40.550> on<00:00:40.670> one<00:00:40.730> this<00:00:41.660> is<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.899> straight

00:00:42.279 --> 00:00:42.289 
your hands on one this is a straight

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:44.680 
your hands on one this is a straight
edge<00:00:42.469> that<00:00:42.800> is<00:00:43.039> part<00:00:43.340> of<00:00:43.460> the<00:00:43.550> system<00:00:43.940> just<00:00:44.539> to

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
edge that is part of the system just to

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.750 
edge that is part of the system just to
show<00:00:44.870> you<00:00:44.960> how<00:00:45.079> to<00:00:45.140> make<00:00:45.320> a<00:00:45.350> strip<00:00:45.680> cut<00:00:46.010> you

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:46.760 
show you how to make a strip cut you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:49.419 
show you how to make a strip cut you
just<00:00:46.969> push<00:00:47.329> down<00:00:48.039> again<00:00:49.039> there's<00:00:49.250> many

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:49.429 
just push down again there's many

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:52.049 
just push down again there's many
Fancy's<00:00:50.090> ways<00:00:50.390> to<00:00:50.660> snap<00:00:50.989> a<00:00:51.350> piece<00:00:51.679> of<00:00:51.890> glass

00:00:52.049 --> 00:00:52.059 
Fancy's ways to snap a piece of glass

00:00:52.059 --> 00:00:55.540 
Fancy's ways to snap a piece of glass
off<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.449> just<00:00:53.899> hit<00:00:54.109> it<00:00:54.260> because<00:00:54.649> the<00:00:55.010> glass<00:00:55.250> is

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
off and just hit it because the glass is

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.029 
off and just hit it because the glass is
a<00:00:55.609> lot<00:00:56.000> easier<00:00:56.690> to<00:00:56.870> bring<00:00:57.320> apart<00:00:57.739> than<00:00:57.920> you

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
a lot easier to bring apart than you

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.340 
a lot easier to bring apart than you
realized<00:00:58.460> okay<00:00:59.329> so<00:00:59.390> this<00:00:59.690> is<00:00:59.899> one<00:01:00.079> of<00:01:00.109> our

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 
realized okay so this is one of our

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.400 
realized okay so this is one of our
pieces<00:01:00.829> for<00:01:01.160> the<00:01:01.539> for<00:01:02.539> the<00:01:02.660> pattern<00:01:03.109> I'll<00:01:03.260> just

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:03.410 
pieces for the for the pattern I'll just

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:04.900 
pieces for the for the pattern I'll just
move<00:01:03.589> this<00:01:03.739> out<00:01:03.920> of<00:01:03.949> the<00:01:04.160> way<00:01:04.309> for<00:01:04.370> the<00:01:04.580> sake<00:01:04.879> of

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:04.910 
move this out of the way for the sake of

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.430 
move this out of the way for the sake of
the<00:01:05.120> demonstration<00:01:05.300> they<00:01:05.930> don't<00:01:06.080> people<00:01:06.320> been

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440 
the demonstration they don't people been

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.160 
the demonstration they don't people been
eating<00:01:06.710> that<00:01:07.030> so<00:01:08.030> as<00:01:08.210> you<00:01:08.360> can<00:01:08.480> see<00:01:08.540> the<00:01:08.870> grids

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
eating that so as you can see the grids

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.850 
eating that so as you can see the grids
and<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:10.100> pattern<00:01:10.659> this<00:01:11.659> is<00:01:11.870> cutting<00:01:12.290> oil<00:01:12.500> I

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
and the pattern this is cutting oil I

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.280 
and the pattern this is cutting oil I
don't<00:01:13.760> like<00:01:14.030> using<00:01:14.270> it<00:01:14.570> in<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:14.750> cylinder<00:01:15.260> I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:15.290 
don't like using it in the cylinder I

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.990 
don't like using it in the cylinder I
just<00:01:15.560> find<00:01:15.740> it<00:01:15.830> gets<00:01:15.950> mucky<00:01:16.400> so<00:01:16.550> I<00:01:16.580> just<00:01:16.790> put<00:01:16.970> a

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:17.000 
just find it gets mucky so I just put a

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.200 
just find it gets mucky so I just put a
little<00:01:17.210> bit<00:01:17.420> in<00:01:17.690> my<00:01:17.960> in<00:01:18.830> my<00:01:19.100> jar<00:01:19.430> and<00:01:19.640> I<00:01:19.730> dip<00:01:19.970> and

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
little bit in my in my jar and I dip and

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:21.340 
little bit in my in my jar and I dip and
I<00:01:20.270> always<00:01:20.420> just<00:01:20.660> have<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.810> little<00:01:20.990> piece<00:01:21.200> of

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
I always just have a little piece of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.250 
I always just have a little piece of
paper<00:01:21.530> on<00:01:22.160> my<00:01:22.370> working<00:01:22.610> area<00:01:23.000> nothing<00:01:23.690> fancy

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:24.260 
paper on my working area nothing fancy

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.980 
paper on my working area nothing fancy
roll<00:01:24.920> off<00:01:25.160> most<00:01:25.460> of<00:01:25.700> the<00:01:25.850> oil<00:01:26.030> it<00:01:26.600> just<00:01:26.630> keeps

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
roll off most of the oil it just keeps

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.900 
roll off most of the oil it just keeps
your<00:01:27.200> wheel<00:01:27.380> lubricated<00:01:28.280> and<00:01:28.490> it<00:01:28.580> makes<00:01:28.730> your

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:28.910 
your wheel lubricated and it makes your

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.510 
your wheel lubricated and it makes your
tools<00:01:29.120> last<00:01:29.420> longer<00:01:29.720> so<00:01:30.080> you<00:01:30.500> just<00:01:30.770> start<00:01:31.160> and

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
tools last longer so you just start and

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:33.820 
tools last longer so you just start and
you<00:01:31.670> push<00:01:32.000> you<00:01:32.630> hear<00:01:32.840> that<00:01:32.990> nice<00:01:33.200> little<00:01:33.470> sound

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:33.830 
you push you hear that nice little sound

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.690 
you push you hear that nice little sound
and<00:01:34.190> it<00:01:34.460> snaps<00:01:34.850> off<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:36.200> make<00:01:36.380> curves<00:01:36.890> again

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
and it snaps off to make curves again

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.470 
and it snaps off to make curves again
just<00:01:38.270> a<00:01:38.420> really<00:01:38.840> nice<00:01:39.700> quite<00:01:40.700> a<00:01:40.730> hard<00:01:41.060> pressure

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:41.480 
just a really nice quite a hard pressure

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.130 
just a really nice quite a hard pressure
but<00:01:41.900> not<00:01:42.380> so<00:01:42.770> hard<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.160> it's<00:01:43.910> not<00:01:44.090> I<00:01:44.390> don't

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
but not so hard that it's not I don't

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:46.300 
but not so hard that it's not I don't
know<00:01:45.200> how<00:01:45.290> to<00:01:45.350> explain<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.770> get<00:01:45.920> the<00:01:46.040> feel<00:01:46.280> of

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
know how to explain you get the feel of

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.550 
know how to explain you get the feel of
it<00:01:46.520> as<00:01:46.670> you<00:01:46.790> go<00:01:46.970> along<00:01:47.120> and<00:01:47.600> different<00:01:48.290> glasses

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.460 
it as you go along and different glasses
take<00:01:49.550> different<00:01:49.850> pressure<00:01:50.390> these<00:01:51.110> are<00:01:51.290> just

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
take different pressure these are just

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.740 
take different pressure these are just
