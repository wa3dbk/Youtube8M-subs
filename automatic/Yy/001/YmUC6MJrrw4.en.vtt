and a half days and nights I was going
on<00:00:31.559> the<00:00:31.649> front<00:00:31.890> mike<00:00:32.130> was<00:00:32.309> up<00:00:32.700> above<00:00:33.030> me<00:00:33.149> a

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
on the front mike was up above me a

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.670 
on the front mike was up above me a
little<00:00:33.420> bit<00:00:33.510> back<00:00:33.690> behind<00:00:33.870> me<00:00:34.170> upslope<00:00:34.500> as

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
little bit back behind me upslope as

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.530 
little bit back behind me upslope as
we're<00:00:34.829> descending<00:00:35.280> and<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.270> as<00:00:36.390> we're<00:00:36.510> going

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
we're descending and so as we're going

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.990 
we're descending and so as we're going
down<00:00:36.780> what<00:00:37.110> we<00:00:37.170> do<00:00:37.260> is<00:00:37.410> we<00:00:37.559> use<00:00:37.980> our<00:00:38.190> ice<00:00:38.609> axes

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
down what we do is we use our ice axes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.689 
down what we do is we use our ice axes
and<00:00:39.179> we<00:00:39.510> probe<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.589> the<00:00:40.679> snow<00:00:40.890> we<00:00:41.100> push<00:00:41.460> it<00:00:41.579> into

00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:41.699 
and we probe at the snow we push it into

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:43.279 
and we probe at the snow we push it into
the<00:00:41.789> snow<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.179> if<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.329> feels<00:00:42.629> solid<00:00:42.929> and

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
the snow and if it feels solid and

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:45.619 
the snow and if it feels solid and
sounds<00:00:44.160> solid<00:00:44.370> then<00:00:44.910> we<00:00:45.089> know<00:00:45.239> it's<00:00:45.420> a<00:00:45.480> solid

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
sounds solid then we know it's a solid

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.270 
sounds solid then we know it's a solid
piece<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.050> ground<00:00:46.170> we<00:00:46.379> can<00:00:46.469> step<00:00:46.710> on<00:00:46.890> it<00:00:47.070> so<00:00:47.160> we

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
piece of ground we can step on it so we

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.029 
piece of ground we can step on it so we
we<00:00:47.640> probe<00:00:47.969> and<00:00:48.269> then<00:00:48.480> step<00:00:48.809> and<00:00:49.050> then<00:00:49.739> probe

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
we probe and then step and then probe

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.720 
we probe and then step and then probe
and<00:00:50.309> then<00:00:50.370> step

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.200 

I<00:00:54.130> stepped<00:00:55.130> off<00:00:55.280> the<00:00:55.520> trail<00:00:55.700> to<00:00:55.850> go<00:00:55.940> around<00:00:56.120> an

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
I stepped off the trail to go around an

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.210 
I stepped off the trail to go around an
obvious<00:00:56.600> crevasse<00:00:56.900> to<00:00:57.170> the<00:00:57.290> left<00:00:57.530> and<00:00:58.100> when<00:00:58.190> I

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:58.220 
obvious crevasse to the left and when I

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.950 
obvious crevasse to the left and when I
stepped<00:00:58.489> off<00:00:58.610> to<00:00:58.790> go<00:00:59.210> around<00:00:59.480> that<00:00:59.570> obvious

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
stepped off to go around that obvious

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.619 
stepped off to go around that obvious
crevasse<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.559> probed<00:01:01.280> and<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:02.180> snow<00:01:02.420> is<00:01:02.449> just

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
crevasse I probed and the snow is just

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.060 
crevasse I probed and the snow is just
about<00:01:02.930> two<00:01:03.110> feet<00:01:03.320> thick<00:01:03.530> about<00:01:03.710> the<00:01:03.800> length<00:01:03.980> of

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:04.070 
about two feet thick about the length of

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.790 
about two feet thick about the length of
this<00:01:04.220> axe<00:01:04.489> and<00:01:04.790> it<00:01:05.600> felt<00:01:05.840> solid<00:01:06.110> but<00:01:06.650> when<00:01:06.770> I

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
this axe and it felt solid but when I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.290 
this axe and it felt solid but when I
stepped<00:01:07.130> onto<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.580> it<00:01:07.880> started<00:01:08.180> collapsing

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
stepped onto it it started collapsing

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.390 
stepped onto it it started collapsing
under<00:01:08.720> my<00:01:08.900> foot<00:01:09.110> nice<00:01:09.650> thinking<00:01:10.009> up<00:01:10.160> to<00:01:10.250> my

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:10.400 
under my foot nice thinking up to my

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.490 
under my foot nice thinking up to my
ankle<00:01:11.210> which<00:01:11.630> was<00:01:11.810> normal<00:01:12.170> I<00:01:12.200> figured<00:01:12.440> I'm

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:12.500 
ankle which was normal I figured I'm

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:13.810 
ankle which was normal I figured I'm
just<00:01:12.650> in<00:01:12.770> a<00:01:12.860> little<00:01:13.009> bit<00:01:13.100> of<00:01:13.190> soft<00:01:13.369> snow<00:01:13.610> and

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:13.820 
just in a little bit of soft snow and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.969 
just in a little bit of soft snow and
then<00:01:14.330> I<00:01:14.420> came<00:01:14.750> up<00:01:14.810> to<00:01:14.990> my<00:01:15.110> shin<00:01:15.410> which<00:01:15.830> is

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
then I came up to my shin which is

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.620 
then I came up to my shin which is
deeper<00:01:16.310> than<00:01:16.430> normal<00:01:16.460> I<00:01:16.910> thought<00:01:17.390> well<00:01:17.600> maybe

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
deeper than normal I thought well maybe

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.270 
deeper than normal I thought well maybe
just<00:01:18.050> going<00:01:18.200> to<00:01:18.290> kind<00:01:18.590> of<00:01:18.650> soft<00:01:18.860> in<00:01:19.040> this<00:01:19.130> one

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:19.280 
just going to kind of soft in this one

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.430 
just going to kind of soft in this one
spot<00:01:19.550> it'll<00:01:19.790> solidify<00:01:20.479> and<00:01:20.840> firm<00:01:21.020> up<00:01:21.170> under<00:01:21.320> my

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:21.440 
spot it'll solidify and firm up under my

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.469 
spot it'll solidify and firm up under my
foot<00:01:21.650> but<00:01:22.310> it<00:01:22.430> didn't<00:01:22.670> solidify<00:01:23.090> I<00:01:23.119> didn't

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:23.479 
foot but it didn't solidify I didn't

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.300 
foot but it didn't solidify I didn't
firm<00:01:23.659> up<00:01:23.810> I<00:01:23.930> started<00:01:24.229> picking<00:01:24.650> up<00:01:24.800> speed<00:01:24.950> and

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
firm up I started picking up speed and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:27.160 
firm up I started picking up speed and
that's<00:01:25.789> when<00:01:26.000> I<00:01:26.060> realized<00:01:26.390> I<00:01:26.539> was<00:01:26.690> standing<00:01:27.050> no

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
that's when I realized I was standing no

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.620 
that's when I realized I was standing no
longer<00:01:27.530> on<00:01:27.619> a<00:01:27.680> solid<00:01:28.039> glacier<00:01:28.399> but<00:01:29.000> a<00:01:29.060> big<00:01:29.300> snow

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:37.120 

when<00:01:34.910> I<00:01:34.940> fell<00:01:35.720> the<00:01:36.170> big<00:01:36.320> factor<00:01:36.619> was<00:01:36.740> Mike<00:01:36.950> was

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.130 
when I fell the big factor was Mike was

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.370 
when I fell the big factor was Mike was
slowing<00:01:37.490> me<00:01:37.610> down<00:01:37.640> for<00:01:38.119> the<00:01:38.210> first<00:01:38.450> 50<00:01:39.110> feet<00:01:39.259> of

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380 
slowing me down for the first 50 feet of

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.230 
slowing me down for the first 50 feet of
my<00:01:39.470> fall<00:01:39.710> because<00:01:40.250> he<00:01:40.460> was<00:01:40.610> laying<00:01:41.030> down<00:01:41.180> on

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 
my fall because he was laying down on

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.790 
my fall because he was laying down on
the<00:01:41.390> stomach<00:01:41.600> digging<00:01:42.020> his<00:01:42.140> ice<00:01:42.289> axe<00:01:42.500> into<00:01:42.710> the

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
the stomach digging his ice axe into the

the stomach digging his ice axe into the
snow<00:01:43.039> trying<00:01:43.700> to<00:01:43.850> arrest<00:01:44.090> my<00:01:44.330> fall<00:01:44.570> or<00:01:44.780> stop<00:01:44.990> my

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:47.169 
snow trying to arrest my fall or stop my
fall<00:01:45.380> so<00:01:45.860> he<00:01:46.039> slowed<00:01:46.310> me<00:01:46.460> down<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:46.940> free

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:47.179

fell<00:01:47.360> the<00:01:47.509> last<00:01:47.539> 30<00:01:47.960> feet<00:01:48.229> or<00:01:48.350> so<00:01:48.500> and<00:01:48.740> when<00:01:49.190> I

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:49.220 
fell the last 30 feet or so and when I

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.100 
fell the last 30 feet or so and when I
landed<00:01:49.490> my<00:01:49.670> pack<00:01:50.060> was<00:01:50.270> just<00:01:50.539> the<00:01:50.690> right<00:01:50.810> size

walls<00:01:53.840> that<00:01:54.440> kind<00:01:54.649> of<00:01:54.710> cushion<00:01:54.950> my<00:01:55.220> landing<00:01:55.700> so

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
walls that kind of cushion my landing so

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.180 
walls that kind of cushion my landing so
I<00:01:56.030> sort<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.450> survived<00:01:57.200> the<00:01:57.440> whole<00:01:57.590> lesser<00:01:57.920> fall

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:58.190 
I sort of survived the whole lesser fall

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.100 
I sort of survived the whole lesser fall
that<00:01:58.429> way<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.789> Mike<00:01:59.479> fell<00:01:59.690> with<00:01:59.840> a<00:01:59.899> greater

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:00.110 
that way and Mike fell with a greater

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.109 
that way and Mike fell with a greater
force<00:02:00.380> because<00:02:00.679> there<00:02:00.830> was<00:02:00.950> no<00:02:01.670> one<00:02:01.819> to<00:02:01.849> slow

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
force because there was no one to slow

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:14.970 
force because there was no one to slow
down<00:02:02.300> his<00:02:02.479> fall

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.330 

I<00:02:16.810> had<00:02:17.810> some<00:02:17.990> trouble<00:02:18.290> getting<00:02:18.320> over<00:02:19.040> the<00:02:19.220> lip

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
I had some trouble getting over the lip

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.470 
I had some trouble getting over the lip
because<00:02:19.520> it<00:02:19.610> was<00:02:19.700> so<00:02:19.850> rotten<00:02:20.060> and<00:02:20.270> I<00:02:20.330> almost

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
because it was so rotten and I almost

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.900 
because it was so rotten and I almost
tumbled<00:02:21.350> in<00:02:21.440> backwards<00:02:21.860> and<00:02:22.070> almost<00:02:22.730> had<00:02:22.850> to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
tumbled in backwards and almost had to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.580 
tumbled in backwards and almost had to
do<00:02:23.000> sort<00:02:23.210> of<00:02:23.240> a<00:02:23.300> blind<00:02:23.570> leap<00:02:23.990> of<00:02:24.140> faith<00:02:24.350> of

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
do sort of a blind leap of faith of

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.830 
do sort of a blind leap of faith of
setting<00:02:25.160> my<00:02:25.190> axes<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.700> but<00:02:26.360> I<00:02:26.420> looked<00:02:26.660> out<00:02:26.810> I

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:26.840 
setting my axes and but I looked out I

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.330 
setting my axes and but I looked out I
realized<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.470> was<00:02:27.590> out<00:02:27.680> and<00:02:27.770> I<00:02:27.830> looked<00:02:28.040> up<00:02:28.160> and<00:02:28.280> I

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
realized I was out and I looked up and I

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:29.620 
realized I was out and I looked up and I
could<00:02:28.520> see<00:02:28.640> the<00:02:28.760> Sun<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.000> could<00:02:29.270> see<00:02:29.390> the<00:02:29.480> blue

then I realized I had to still sort of

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:56.560 
then I realized I had to still sort of
regroup<00:02:55.220> because<00:02:55.850> I<00:02:56.030> was<00:02:56.180> in<00:02:56.270> the<00:02:56.330> middle<00:02:56.480> of
