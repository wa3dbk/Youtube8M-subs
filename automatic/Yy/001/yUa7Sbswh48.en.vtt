00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:15.389
 how about all the good youtube band 

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:17.670
 in this video we will explain how 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:37.950
 diagnose in a very simple way 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:39.989
 the coil of our being and for this 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.300
 it will be necessary to disconnect the cables from 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.399
 cylinders 2 and 3 now we march 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.730
 the car observes the intensity of our 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.730
 spark 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:59.930
 this is pretty good now we do what 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.609
 same with cylinders 1 and 4 this 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.549
 spark is very weak as you can observe 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:07.070
 nothing compared to the previous one 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:09.259
 that we're going to replace our coil if 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.990
 your car presents a similar symptom 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.640
 it is necessary to replace it not without 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.009
 before being sure that this has 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.810
 started to fail for this we perform 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:20.149
 a small test with a tester 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.789
 test the coil connector of the 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.500
 next way if there are pulses in 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.119
 two of its terminals the coil that is 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.770
 the one that is failing 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:34.729
 if there were no pulses we would have to 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:36.920
 check other things like that well simple 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.050
 we will replace the coil this 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.729
 it's very simple, we only remove the three 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.729
 screws that hold it and ready 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:07.009
 we put the new coil and screw it 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.009
 moss that's all 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:30.060
 put the harness on it and finally 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.980
 the spark plug wires these are not 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.310
 we disconnect because we do not lose the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.310
 order 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:55.069
 and good friends that's all remember 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.079
 comment leave a like or subscribe 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.650
 remember that here we share what more 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.650
 we like it
