00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.160
 not by physical conditions the truth is not 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.760
 I know I love it and I would have loved it 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.550
 I play football fan football 

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:29.369
 for me I always say that there are 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.230
 sports and soccer is religion radio 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.050
 it's a religion soccer sport but 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.829
 after conditions I do not know if I had 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 so much courage for well lateral vittek or you 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.170
 I pushed the good but nothing no no 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.809
 I had conditions but I loved it 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.809
 Argentine soccer 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:00.570
 of first and the sports tn the one of the 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.050
 of the unah follows is the volume obeys 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:09.000
 yes but when they were Juan and Juan Pablo 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:11.700
 that would change would it be out there more 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.039
 permissive 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:16.229
 that there is a rule that still benefits 

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:20.399
 more to attack the team that wants 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:22.800
 attacking around would lower the score of 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.930
 belt 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.510
 and how it is kicked bats 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.430
 would do it with a conversion and 

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:31.410
 I would still keep five points 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.920
 centers would benefit the team that 

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:33.920
 want to attack 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.820
 I have come out a lot in my life but never the 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:41.370
 previous night of a match this is a 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.100
 rule that 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:47.700
 What do I have to do? I always think that 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:50.190
 out of respect for oneself and respect for your 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.610
 comrades before a match in our 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:56.280
 league if two days before the day after and 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.590
 I have repented many times of having 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:02.280
 meaning of the day after the same day 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.650
 after matches to my second home of 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.870
 my childhood club the club me west 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.670
 After many, I always say what 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:12.310
 then I have played in different 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.560
 teams and I always treat these 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:19.510
 teams as he admitted as a year more 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:23.700
 I do not try to treat in the same way 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.700
 who plays for me newman clubs always
