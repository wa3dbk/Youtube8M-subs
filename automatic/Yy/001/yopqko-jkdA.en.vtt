00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.859
 but I really really praise my cellphone 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.930
 my smartphone or my iphone what 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.580
 always because you are just flexible 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.650
 you can do something on the way 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.389
 Internet after Googling but for the home 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.009
 is this fiddling with these little ones 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:16.740
 screen then fit really 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.470
 really annoying and there I praise myself 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.090
 my keyboard only i do not know if i am 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.189
 correct in the assumption am a keyboard 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.930
 and he is not yet a mobile phone 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.580
 really been invented or so 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.349
 Normally you have indeed 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.060
 this on these smartphones or at 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.769
 this tablet no matter if we are now of the 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.660
 iphone talk or from an android 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.250
 based devices operating system plays 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.899
 It really does not matter if you do that 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.579
 Problem that you always so tiny little 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.170
 Keys did not stand as a man then 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.960
 always in front of it and create mine 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:43.860
 dictionary since the wildest creations 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:45.450
 and if I do that in world history 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.640
 Sometimes it can be quite chic 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.129
 be nice and embarrassing 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.120
 Of course, such a small and above all 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.340
 things spoken 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.110
 narrow and flat keyboard quite 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.539
 sense of public in the usual quality 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.460
 with usual typing comfort also here 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.620

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.830

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.850

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.360
 It all works 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:45.750
 wirelessly on data transmission 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.399

 range of up to ten meters that 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.760
 means I do not have to now 

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:12.130

 In any case, do not continue this way 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:35.750
 that makes real fun would now times 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.790
 then they can maybe 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:39.740
 see if they want to have that too 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:42.950
