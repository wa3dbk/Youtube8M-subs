00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.460
 I want to launch a new concept 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.529
 of video so at first this concept I 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.260
 wanted to call it special effects tutorial 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.960
 harry potter then I changed to tutorial 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.730
 harry potter special effect because 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.560
 it's more classy in English then in 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:20.910
 did it was too long I changed 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.199
 in tutorial hps sees it when I was little 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.060
 I really thought that magic 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.800
 existed then I arm myself and this 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.010
 fantastic very elastic baguette 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.560
 dacic of these beautiful glasses a 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.270
 once I had these accessories b2 sure 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.040
 I took myself for harry potter and 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.899
 joined amused to cast spells a little 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.489
 everywhere but hey, I do not know about you 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.170
 but me personally never worked 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.450
 that's why I decided to launch 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.190
 this new video concept where I'm going 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.660
 teach you how to do the tricks of 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.770
 magic co times in the good potter reee 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.480
 be they see all crazy not rolling 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.039
 actually make magic to complain 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.809
 rather special effects 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.309
 so we start with a little trick 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:55.289
 any beast that will allow us to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.820
 make the little fates pretty cool and 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:59.489
 snap you're very strong finally we 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.469
 will make 3 fate in this video and 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.830
 we will therefore use the principle of art 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.630
 version of videos to achieve this one 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.460
 starts with the axial spell that 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.229
 draws objects toward you 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.450
 to do this you will need a 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:14.420
 object on which you will launch the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:17.640
 out our friends the seedlings a baguette 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.740
 as well as a small camera and a 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 editing software like vegas for this 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.340
 tutor it will have to think backwards in 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.869
 done for these 3 so sort out all 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:26.880
 movements that you will have to do 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.340
 make them upside down so look at this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.110
 example I use a book I 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.990
 start by looking at it then I 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.409
 do I run it a little further in 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.850
 may 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.590
 leave it in the field and all at the same 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.030
 time I make a new lease and take 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.009
 your video you see your maca 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.999
 editing software and you reverse the 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.999
 sense of scrolling images 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.970
 so me personally for this tutorial I chose 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.620
 not to pronounce the jumps since that 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.880
 abyss additional difficulty he 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:58.170
 had to add a track in hard all 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.100
 that and I wanted to show that 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.750
 quite simple way 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.810
 after book you if you want to add 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 for example the spell pronounce in 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.560
 you have to record a track 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.240
 audio apart since when you go 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.350
 reverse the video all your words that 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.520
 you're going to pronounce ben ali 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.960
 automatically they will cross too 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.520
 good after I leave you 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.080
 untangle 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.290
 now here is lubitsch gardiole 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.870
 leviosa the dwelling where the capacity of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.220
 fly network for this tutorial I you 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:25.200
 advise to take a feather to 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.510
 have a better effect where so if there is 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.890
 a fairly light object but that will not 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.030
 towards your the case everywhere when you 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.710
 go and let go because we're all going 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.120
 go take it and let it go up 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.410
 in parliament a piece of paper that's 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.360
 not terrible since the sheet of 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.460
 paper so she goes rather you go 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.840
 need a feather a baguette 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.700
 as before a camera and 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.380
 editing software is also a 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.860
 assistant who will help you achieve 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:49.740
 this little special effect sit down to 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.120
 a table with your wand your 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:53.220
 assistant feathered files of 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.570
 find out of the field he'll let them go 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:56.489
 feather that you will follow from the 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:58.320
 wand and once it will have fallen 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:00.420
 on the table you make the move 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.250
 hard wingardium leviosa but reversed 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.980
 then you reverse the direction of scrolling 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.870
 pictures with your software so if 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.790
 you want if your pen or your 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:11.580
 object fell too quickly but by 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.870
 example add a slight slows not 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:15.420
 too powerful not that it can 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.100
 receive but a slight slow motion so that 

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.750
 the object turns him that the job and 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.370
 please be aware of the 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.290
 movement of winter jobs readable 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.900
 old it could be done right at 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.430
 when the ad will hit the table in 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.550
 party for although it's sync all 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.550
 it 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.530
 we will then move on to the last 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.540
 tutorial which is the fire spell 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.790
 spell can generate flames 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.670
 the end of the baguette so for this 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.430
 tutorial needing a candle the 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.829
 calmette a baguette then like a 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.030
 camera a montbard system alas if 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:50.190
 possible an assistant it's not 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:51.690
 obligatory but it will always be useful 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:53.340
 you're going to make a tight plan on the 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.819
 candle already lit and the tip of your 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.829
 Ring 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:58.109
 if you do not have an assistant he does not 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.579
 do not have to see your face 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:02.040
 go make a dry motion of your 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:04.140
 baguette and at the same time your 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:06.750
 assistant was going to blow to extinguish 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:10.280
 the candle again you reverse 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.280
 the video and voila 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:14.730
 then do not hesitate to add some 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.709
 little sound effects or music 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.030
 to have a better rendering and that's it 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.590
 that's all for this new concept of 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:21.329

 also tell me how much I 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.830
 could improve what I needed 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:29.850

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.300
 a little bit what we want 

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.789
