 or work up to 8g such welcome to 

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.049
 avenge one more day and as you can see we have a 

00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:10.730
 new squat wilder before starting with 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:12.980
 the squat wilder remember that if you want 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.389
 buy coins pass by fifa coins 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.910
 point with the description you have the 

00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:19.789
 link to the web and a discount code 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.310
 additionally you will find support in 

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.619
 Spanish and they are very fast delivering to 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.330
 the coins so nothing are we going to 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.109
 start with the video as you see is a the 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.339
 quadril der as I said before 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.170
 Irish is the team that I'm going to 

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:35.600
 use me for san tournament 

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.440
 patricio that surely will put this 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.859
 weekend already 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.920
 and nothing will start at the goal 

00:00:40.859 --> 00:00:45.829
 we have here they see the aston goalie 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.809
 vila that now the graves are not 

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:51.960
 I have taken this because it is the 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.010
 barclays and if in the future it will be worth more 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.210
 money that the other one that is in the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:57.250
 second division english 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.980
 on the right side we have coleman 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.199
 As you can see, it has two versions, silver and 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.930
 gold and has already taken the gold version 

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.640
 because apart from that it is cheaper is the 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.990
 better the truth that is not bad at all this 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.869
 player and when it was silver I liked it 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.759
 much now when then in gold the improvement 

00:01:10.869 --> 00:01:15.670
 also so it's really worth it 

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.530
 you also have it for a high 1400 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.770
 coins is now a little more expensive for 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.170
 the tournament but let's go 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.939
 is the defense we have to clear this 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.119
 defense I like a lot because I already tell you 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.610
 he has 65 rhythm and 75 defense what 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.899
 is a good defense the truth to be of 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.050
 Silver is the best there is 

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:35.790
 shipments 

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.440
 accompanying you we have some in a thread 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.290
 chosen more than anything by the pace that 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:43.230
 has 77 of pace and 61 of defense for 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.850
 being a bronze is wonderful in the 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.550
 left side I've put you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:51.180
 kuningan and I have not found anything better 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:52.580
 but good 77 of 65 defense rhythms 67 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.950
 of head 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:57.020
 the truth that comes very well to this 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.600
 bottom line you noticed that and it has 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.570
 liked in the truth no no I did not like 

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.870
 this player 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.979
 in the mcd we have wilson this game does not 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:07.750
 I liked it a lot but it was the one that 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:09.369
 defense had of all the Irish in 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.100
 the middle of the field then I decided 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.200
 for putting wilson 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.080
 in the md we have the star of 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.510
 team cream and as you know you have five 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.170
 Filigree stars 89 of rhythm 71 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:27.940
 of shots 75 of steps 87 dribble I have the 

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:29.920
 from Russia the lead because it was more 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:30.310
 cheap that the barclays not for another 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.310
 thing 

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:37.750
 and apart I promise with envelope in element 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:41.230
 we have ireland and as you can see it is the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.740
 best Irish player 75 of rhythm 78 of 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.550
 dribble has 76 of passes 70 of shot no 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.320
 it's not bad 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.870
 I would not call him a click bar team 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.890
 but this is fundamental for this 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.530
 player 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.810
 in the my and we have a white that have 91 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:59.690
 rhythms a barbarity is a bullet is 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:02.480
 Super fast you notice a weak but 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.370
 is very fast, so if we have 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.190
 buy what is not worth much 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.739
 and we are already with the point of attack 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:14.750
 we have robbie keane this is already a 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:20.239
 old glory 71 of rhythm the rhythm no no 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.239
 is the proper 79 81 dribble shot 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:25.010
 What can I say about robbie keane? 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:26.600
 neither can you say much does not stand out 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:29.300
 for nothing but at least it is the best 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.250
 shot has in ireland and at your side 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:34.160
 we have the star of the team this 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:38.240
 that I love we have the long 85 of 

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:39.920
 shot rhythm 68 shot 73 dribble pass 73 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:43.880
 this player already used it on my computer 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:45.320
 silver barclays so there will be the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.120
 true that I was quite lacking 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:49.819
 because this is the one that has climbed the most 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.319
 because he 's the best player and that's the 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.510
 point as a reference that they will use 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:55.610
 everyone hello guys I hope you 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.700

 I for the cup of Saint Patrick 

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.200
