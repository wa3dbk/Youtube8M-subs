00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.299
 you sure took the power I'm not particularly 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.830
 bad found 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.620
 especially after this race yes I am again 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:17.640
 I'll start the user to exclude 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:23.779
 Is it correct after the session guys wife 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.779
 these say wait a bit you are boring to go 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:01:12.479
 on a bicycle you can take something afraid 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.500
 these seem to me to run much easier 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.460
 than on the bike 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.460
 possibly 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:02:01.119
 worth drove 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.510
 speed just a little 

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:23.989
 operating 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:24.920
 we have a race like that I wanted to immediately 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:50.440
 halogen 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:54.579
 in the lobby in the chris does not provide a skin 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.579
 I certainly unsettled 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:05.150
 api image but without breaking 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:34.800
 why did we say well and normal 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:37.320
 chief means by this drove about decisive 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.850
 it hurts me by the way yes I said that they will 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:49.890
 walk those moments where she will 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:56.190
 I will squeeze in the technique of specifying the facts 

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:59.120
 up to some kind of so it should rather she 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.590
 rather cool made this game 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.510
 deflected by anything outside turretless 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:05.760
 no home see maybe maybe 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:06.360
 will be able to be taken in the morning and there is no 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.610
 they will be now 

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:16.410
 usually inhabits it reacts ordinary oops 

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:20.419
 oh oh oh flew the message komarovsky 

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:20.419
 you see the real seabrook 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.600
 when i know 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.699
 Arab 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:59.690
 when some sports cars most often 

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:02.330
 just doroguschy sports car and clogged 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:04.550
 by the mob she baffnut they accelerate to 

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:07.360
 mad speed just whips behind us 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:12.349
 well, that is 

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:18.020
 dividing said tire to a very 

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:20.840
 in sophisticated ways they are here. punishment 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:23.570
 about in the arabic third of this look 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:26.180
 bargaining anna it flows too they clicked on 

00:05:23.570 --> 00:05:30.409
 meetings where or just the funny thing 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:33.820
 tanis not look outside but me 

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:33.820
