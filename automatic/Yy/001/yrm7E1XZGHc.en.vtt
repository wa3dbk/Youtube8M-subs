how<00:00:28.260> does<00:00:28.650> an<00:00:28.769> earthquake<00:00:29.279> shift<00:00:29.670> the<00:00:29.939> Earth's

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
how does an earthquake shift the Earth's

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:35.389 
how does an earthquake shift the Earth's
axis<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> the<00:00:34.230> earthquake<00:00:34.620> is<00:00:34.890> redistributed

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
axis so the earthquake is redistributed

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:38.900 
axis so the earthquake is redistributed
the<00:00:36.180> masses<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.559> rocks<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.430> surface

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
the masses so the rocks on the surface

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
the masses so the rocks on the surface
and<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.690> have<00:00:39.809> such<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.110> big<00:00:40.410> earthquake

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
and if you have such a big earthquake

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.190 
and if you have such a big earthquake
you're<00:00:41.160> actually<00:00:41.340> talking<00:00:41.700> about<00:00:41.989> 200<00:00:42.989> 300

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
you're actually talking about 200 300

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.430 
you're actually talking about 200 300
kilometers<00:00:44.040> in<00:00:44.190> length<00:00:44.219> and<00:00:44.730> about<00:00:45.000> 40<00:00:45.690> 50<00:00:46.320> to

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
kilometers in length and about 40 50 to

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.639 
kilometers in length and about 40 50 to
100<00:00:46.860> meter<00:00:47.190> hundred<00:00:48.090> kilometer<00:00:48.539> in<00:00:48.809> width<00:00:49.050> so

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
100 meter hundred kilometer in width so

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.430 
100 meter hundred kilometer in width so
you're<00:00:49.829> moving<00:00:50.070> these<00:00:50.460> rocks<00:00:50.850> up<00:00:51.090> nearer<00:00:52.020> to

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
you're moving these rocks up nearer to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.410 
you're moving these rocks up nearer to
the<00:00:52.620> Earth's<00:00:52.829> surface<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.699> redistributing

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the Earth's surface and redistributing

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.139 
the Earth's surface and redistributing
in<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.989> way<00:00:55.199> the<00:00:55.620> masses<00:00:56.010> of<00:00:56.129> sears<00:00:56.460> it's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
in that way the masses of sears it's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:59.420 
in that way the masses of sears it's
like<00:00:57.420> if<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.750> have<00:00:57.840> watched<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.920> Olympics

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
like if you have watched the Olympics

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.209 
like if you have watched the Olympics
that<00:00:59.670> figure<00:00:59.940> skating<00:01:00.480> if<00:01:00.690> you<00:01:00.890> look<00:01:01.890> at<00:01:02.070> the

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
that figure skating if you look at the

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.299 
that figure skating if you look at the
period<00:01:02.640> there<00:01:03.059> if<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:04.049> athletes<00:01:04.619> move<00:01:04.949> their

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
period there if the athletes move their

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.120 
period there if the athletes move their
arms<00:01:06.000> closer<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.810> two<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.680> center

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
arms closer to the two to the center

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.130 
arms closer to the two to the center
they<00:01:08.369> are<00:01:08.490> just<00:01:08.670> speeding<00:01:09.210> up<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.479> spinning

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
they are just speeding up and spinning

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:11.899 
they are just speeding up and spinning
much<00:01:10.290> more<00:01:10.619> quickly<00:01:10.799> an<00:01:11.310> effective

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
much more quickly an effective

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.940 
much more quickly an effective
explanation<00:01:12.600> I<00:01:12.780> want<00:01:13.140> to<00:01:13.200> ask<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.530> though<00:01:13.710> how

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
explanation I want to ask you though how

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:15.590 
explanation I want to ask you though how
often<00:01:14.400> does<00:01:14.520> this<00:01:14.700> happen<00:01:14.760> we've<00:01:15.270> heard<00:01:15.570> that

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
often does this happen we've heard that

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600 
often does this happen we've heard that
the<00:01:15.990> tremor<00:01:16.290> eight<00:01:16.799> point<00:01:17.159> eight<00:01:17.310> on<00:01:17.490> the

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
Richter scale made chile's earthquake

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:23.120 
Richter scale made chile's earthquake
the<00:01:19.530> fifth<00:01:19.830> most<00:01:20.280> powerful<00:01:20.780> since<00:01:21.780> 1900<00:01:22.680> how

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
the fifth most powerful since 1900 how

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.370 
the fifth most powerful since 1900 how
hard<00:01:23.369> you<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> get<00:01:24.090> for<00:01:24.780> this<00:01:25.110> kind<00:01:25.320> of

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
hard you have to get for this kind of

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.530 
hard you have to get for this kind of
effect<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.830> take<00:01:26.009> place<00:01:28.850> so<00:01:29.850> you<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.509> be

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
effect to take place so you have to be

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.990 
effect to take place so you have to be
in<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.170> high<00:01:31.380> magnitude<00:01:31.950> eight<00:01:32.340> earthquakes

as<00:01:33.180> far<00:01:33.450> as<00:01:33.600> I<00:01:33.750> can<00:01:33.810> see<00:01:34.200> it<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:35.220> analysis<00:01:35.670> was

as far as I can see it the analysis was

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.840 
as far as I can see it the analysis was
done<00:01:35.909> by<00:01:36.420> NASA<00:01:36.869> and<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.680> think<00:01:38.009> we<00:01:38.369> are<00:01:38.610> right

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
done by NASA and I think we are right
