00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
came here anyway right the early the

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.229 
came here anyway right the early the
super<00:02:09.789> super<00:02:10.149> early<00:02:10.390> line<00:02:10.810> is<00:02:11.319> push<00:02:12.190> that<00:02:13.090> is

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
super super early line is push that is

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:14.790 
super super early line is push that is
probably<00:02:13.690> going<00:02:13.930> to<00:02:14.050> be<00:02:14.110> one<00:02:14.440> of<00:02:14.530> those<00:02:14.620> guys

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
probably going to be one of those guys

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.920 
probably going to be one of those guys
one<00:02:15.459> of<00:02:15.489> those<00:02:15.610> games<00:02:15.790> that's<00:02:16.209> going<00:02:16.540> to<00:02:16.720> be

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
one of those games that's going to be

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.880 
one of those games that's going to be
you<00:02:17.890> know<00:02:18.569> maybe<00:02:19.569> a<00:02:19.689> time<00:02:19.989> maybe<00:02:20.260> maybe<00:02:20.590> one<00:02:20.860> of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
you know maybe a time maybe maybe one of

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.559 
you know maybe a time maybe maybe one of
the<00:02:20.980> first<00:02:21.159> overtime<00:02:21.519> games<00:02:22.030> at<00:02:22.299> Super<00:02:22.540> Bowl

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:22.569 
the first overtime games at Super Bowl

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:23.050 
the first overtime games at Super Bowl
here

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:23.060 
here

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.430 
here
that's<00:02:24.060> that's<00:02:24.360> what<00:02:24.569> the<00:02:24.810> prediction<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
that's that's what the prediction is

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:28.729 
that's that's what the prediction is
early<00:02:25.980> it's<00:02:26.220> super<00:02:26.580> early<00:02:26.750> but<00:02:27.750> my<00:02:28.230> prediction

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
early it's super early but my prediction

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.479 
early it's super early but my prediction
is<00:02:29.209> Patriots<00:02:30.209> minus<00:02:30.569> one<00:02:30.890> minus<00:02:31.890> one<00:02:32.069> can<00:02:32.370> be<00:02:32.459> a

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
is Patriots minus one minus one can be a

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:34.280 
is Patriots minus one minus one can be a
touchdown<00:02:32.940> it<00:02:33.120> can<00:02:33.239> be<00:02:33.330> a<00:02:33.360> field<00:02:33.629> goal<00:02:33.840> it<00:02:34.170> can

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
touchdown it can be a field goal it can

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.410 
touchdown it can be a field goal it can
be<00:02:34.409> a<00:02:34.440> safety<00:02:34.709> it<00:02:35.640> can<00:02:35.849> be<00:02:35.970> any<00:02:36.150> of<00:02:36.330> those

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
be a safety it can be any of those

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.119 
be a safety it can be any of those
things<00:02:36.659> all<00:02:37.290> right<00:02:37.440> I<00:02:37.470> think<00:02:37.650> it's<00:02:37.950> going<00:02:38.040> to

00:02:38.119 --> 00:02:38.129 
things all right I think it's going to

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:42.229 
things all right I think it's going to
be<00:02:38.250> a<00:02:38.280> super<00:02:38.760> super<00:02:39.120> close<00:02:39.360> game<00:02:40.250> but<00:02:41.250> let<00:02:42.209> me

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
be a super super close game but let me

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.030 
be a super super close game but let me
just<00:02:42.330> say<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.690> like<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.319> think<00:02:43.830> the

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
just say it like this I think the

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.770 
just say it like this I think the
Seahawks<00:02:44.430> are<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> team<00:02:44.849> of<00:02:45.000> destiny<00:02:45.450> i<00:02:45.480> think

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
Seahawks are a team of destiny i think

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.570 
Seahawks are a team of destiny i think
if<00:02:45.870> they're<00:02:46.049> destined<00:02:46.620> to<00:02:46.709> go<00:02:46.890> back<00:02:47.190> to<00:02:47.370> back

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
if they're destined to go back to back

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.750 
if they're destined to go back to back
here<00:02:47.849> all<00:02:48.629> right<00:02:48.810> i<00:02:48.959> spoke<00:02:49.379> on<00:02:49.620> not<00:02:50.430> too<00:02:50.579> long

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
here all right i spoke on not too long

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.869 
here all right i spoke on not too long
ago<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:51.810> nucleus<00:02:52.409> of<00:02:52.440> the<00:02:52.739> seahawks<00:02:53.489> being

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:53.879 
ago the nucleus of the seahawks being

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.229 
ago the nucleus of the seahawks being
that<00:02:54.209> young<00:02:54.890> defense<00:02:55.890> they<00:02:56.519> have<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> young

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
that young defense they have a young

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.039 
that young defense they have a young
nucleus<00:02:57.720> they're<00:02:58.110> not<00:02:58.319> going<00:02:58.590> anywhere<00:02:59.099> and

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:00.049 
nucleus they're not going anywhere and

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:03.770 
nucleus they're not going anywhere and
they<00:03:01.049> just<00:03:01.079> find<00:03:01.650> ways<00:03:02.310> to<00:03:02.790> win<00:03:03.000> this<00:03:03.359> this<00:03:03.629> is

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
they just find ways to win this this is

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.530 
they just find ways to win this this is
probably<00:03:03.989> going<00:03:04.379> to<00:03:04.500> be<00:03:04.680> one<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.129> most

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
probably going to be one of the most

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.360 
probably going to be one of the most
