00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
going over my top three carbines the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.400 
going over my top three carbines the
weapons<00:00:20.609> you<00:00:20.789> can<00:00:20.939> use<00:00:21.119> across<00:00:21.510> all<00:00:21.779> classes

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
weapons you can use across all classes

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:24.600 
but seem like they fit the engineer

fun<00:00:42.480> the<00:00:43.320> ACW<00:00:43.920> has<00:00:44.160> an<00:00:44.489> RPM<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> 880<00:00:45.780> which<00:00:46.050> is

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
fun the ACW has an RPM of 880 which is

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.799 
fun the ACW has an RPM of 880 which is
the<00:00:46.440> far<00:00:47.010> faster<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:47.850> the<00:00:48.149> other<00:00:48.390> carbines

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809

in<00:00:49.050> my<00:00:49.140> top<00:00:49.410> three<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.920> it's<00:00:50.070> actually<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.479 --> 00:00:50.489 
in my top three and it's actually the

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:52.279 
in my top three and it's actually the
second<00:00:50.850> fastest<00:00:51.239> out<00:00:51.390> of<00:00:51.480> all<00:00:51.690> the<00:00:51.870> carbines

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289

right behind the mtar-21 which by the
way<00:00:55.140> I've<00:00:55.500> heard<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:55.949> pretty<00:00:56.250> good<00:00:56.550> as<00:00:56.730> well

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
way I've heard is pretty good as well

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.389 
way I've heard is pretty good as well
but<00:00:57.780> like<00:00:58.020> many<00:00:58.170> guns<00:00:58.469> I<00:00:58.680> haven't<00:00:59.129> tried<00:00:59.219> it

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
but like many guns I haven't tried it

which<00:01:18.990> are<00:01:19.140> both<00:01:19.350> not<00:01:19.740> bad<00:01:19.979> at<00:01:20.159> all<00:01:20.280> but<00:01:20.670> its

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
which are both not bad at all but its

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.039 
which are both not bad at all but its
main<00:01:21.060> doubtful<00:01:21.659> main<00:01:22.470> downfall<00:01:23.220> is<00:01:23.490> is<00:01:23.909> it<00:01:24.659> has

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
main doubtful main downfall is is it has

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.819 
main doubtful main downfall is is it has
quite<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.530> bit<00:01:25.979> of<00:01:26.130> recoil<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:27.049> I<00:01:28.049> mean<00:01:28.439> quite<00:01:28.799> a

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
quite a bit of recoil and I mean quite a

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.760 
quite a bit of recoil and I mean quite a
bit<00:01:29.070> moving<00:01:29.939> up<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> left<00:01:30.810> a<00:01:31.049> lot<00:01:31.439> and

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
bit moving up into the left a lot and

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
bit moving up into the left a lot and
slightly<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.490> right<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.689> probably

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
slightly to the right and this probably

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.950 
slightly to the right and this probably
comes<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.770> high<00:01:34.920> rpm<00:01:35.780> basically<00:01:36.780> this

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
comes from the high rpm basically this

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.080 
comes from the high rpm basically this
is<00:01:37.110> my<00:01:37.290> number<00:01:37.530> three<00:01:37.650> because<00:01:38.310> it's<00:01:38.700> really

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
is my number three because it's really

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
is my number three because it's really
only<00:01:39.390> good<00:01:40.020> in<00:01:40.229> close<00:01:40.590> quarter<00:01:40.979> maps<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.490> game

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
only good in close quarter maps and game

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.690 
only good in close quarter maps and game
modes<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.360> are<00:01:43.110> close<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.890> domination<00:01:44.520> and

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
modes that are close like domination and

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.060 
modes that are close like domination and
even<00:01:45.600> then<00:01:45.780> I<00:01:46.020> would<00:01:46.229> rather<00:01:46.380> use<00:01:46.680> something

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
even then I would rather use something

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.910 
even then I would rather use something
like<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.369> AK<00:01:47.820> or<00:01:48.060> the<00:01:48.180> f2000<00:01:48.960> but<00:01:49.140> still<00:01:49.409> it's

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
like the AK or the f2000 but still it's

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.340 
like the AK or the f2000 but still it's
a<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.369> really<00:01:50.700> good<00:01:50.909> gun<00:01:51.149> when<00:01:52.079> it<00:01:52.170> comes

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
a really really good gun when it comes

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.249 
a really really good gun when it comes
to<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.530> attachments<00:01:53.159> I<00:01:53.250> use<00:01:53.490> on<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> ACW<00:01:54.600> the

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
to the attachments I use on the ACW the

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.830 
to the attachments I use on the ACW the
scope<00:01:55.560> i<00:01:55.770> use<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.549> coyote<00:01:57.060> site<00:01:57.240> for<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:57.570> grip

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
scope i use the coyote site for the grip

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.660 
scope i use the coyote site for the grip
i<00:01:58.020> use<00:01:58.290> the<00:01:58.469> angled<00:01:58.920> grip<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.310> get<00:01:59.460> more

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
i use the angled grip to get more

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
i use the angled grip to get more
stability<00:02:00.060> since<00:02:00.659> it<00:02:00.750> has<00:02:00.899> a<00:02:00.930> lot<00:02:01.110> of<00:02:01.140> recoil

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
stability since it has a lot of recoil

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.530 
stability since it has a lot of recoil
and<00:02:01.799> for<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.460> barrel<00:02:02.729> i<00:02:02.850> use<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> muzzle

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
and for the barrel i use the muzzle

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.500 
and for the barrel i use the muzzle
brake<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.930> once<00:02:04.110> again<00:02:04.259> get<00:02:04.890> more<00:02:05.130> stability

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:10.510 

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:14.920 

number<00:02:11.510> two<00:02:11.750> the<00:02:12.350> ace<00:02:12.530> 52<00:02:13.090> cqb<00:02:14.090> so<00:02:14.660> many

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
number two the ace 52 cqb so many

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:17.260 
number two the ace 52 cqb so many
fucking<00:02:15.260> letters<00:02:15.770> right<00:02:16.520> off<00:02:16.640> the<00:02:16.700> bat<00:02:16.970> you

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
fucking letters right off the bat you

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.000 
fucking letters right off the bat you
must<00:02:17.540> be<00:02:17.660> wondering<00:02:17.900> why<00:02:18.200> would<00:02:18.320> he<00:02:18.560> pick<00:02:18.740> the

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
must be wondering why would he pick the

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:22.480 
must be wondering why would he pick the
ace<00:02:19.220> 52<00:02:19.460> over<00:02:20.240> the<00:02:20.270> ACW<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.710> asa<00:02:21.890> to<00:02:22.160> do<00:02:22.280> has<00:02:22.460> a

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
ace 52 over the ACW the asa to do has a

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.570 
ace 52 over the ACW the asa to do has a
slower<00:02:22.850> RPM<00:02:23.300> at<00:02:23.420> 650<00:02:24.200> slow<00:02:24.650> reload<00:02:25.070> time<00:02:25.370> with

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
slower RPM at 650 slow reload time with

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.210 
slower RPM at 650 slow reload time with
bullet<00:02:25.970> left<00:02:26.600> in<00:02:26.870> the<00:02:26.960> mag<00:02:27.140> at<00:02:27.260> 2.2<00:02:27.800> seconds

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
bullet left in the mag at 2.2 seconds

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.030 
bullet left in the mag at 2.2 seconds
and<00:02:28.400> with<00:02:28.700> no<00:02:29.210> bullets<00:02:29.600> left<00:02:29.750> in<00:02:29.930> the<00:02:30.050> mega<00:02:30.230> 3.1

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
and with no bullets left in the mega 3.1

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:33.220 
and with no bullets left in the mega 3.1
seconds<00:02:31.460> and<00:02:31.670> finally<00:02:32.540> it<00:02:32.660> has<00:02:32.780> a<00:02:32.810> smaller

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:33.230 
seconds and finally it has a smaller

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.320 
seconds and finally it has a smaller
maggot<00:02:33.710> only<00:02:34.040> twenty<00:02:34.400> six<00:02:34.640> bullets<00:02:34.970> compared

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
maggot only twenty six bullets compared

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:39.040 
maggot only twenty six bullets compared
to<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.510> 31<00:02:35.990> and<00:02:36.140> the<00:02:36.200> ACW<00:02:37.060> well<00:02:38.060> good<00:02:38.300> sir<00:02:38.510> the

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
to the 31 and the ACW well good sir the

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.720 
to the 31 and the ACW well good sir the
two<00:02:39.260> reasons<00:02:39.470> why<00:02:39.800> I<00:02:39.830> like<00:02:40.100> it<00:02:40.130> more<00:02:40.490> is

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
two reasons why I like it more is

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:43.330 
two reasons why I like it more is
because<00:02:40.940> one<00:02:41.360> compared<00:02:42.050> to<00:02:42.140> the<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> CWS<00:02:42.920> damage

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
because one compared to the a CWS damage

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.030 
because one compared to the a CWS damage
of<00:02:43.460> 25<00:02:43.940> the<00:02:44.540> ace<00:02:44.690> 52<00:02:44.900> doesn't<00:02:45.470> max<00:02:45.620> damage<00:02:45.800> of

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
of 25 the ace 52 doesn't max damage of

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.800 
of 25 the ace 52 doesn't max damage of
34<00:02:46.760> damage<00:02:47.300> in<00:02:47.480> a<00:02:47.870> minimum<00:02:48.320> of<00:02:48.470> 20<00:02:49.160> and<00:02:49.370> two<00:02:50.360> ace

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:50.810 
34 damage in a minimum of 20 and two ace

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.060 
34 damage in a minimum of 20 and two ace
52<00:02:51.170> has<00:02:51.850> so<00:02:52.850> so<00:02:53.090> recoil<00:02:53.540> which<00:02:54.020> is<00:02:54.290> definitely

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:55.070 
52 has so so recoil which is definitely

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:57.790 
52 has so so recoil which is definitely
still<00:02:55.580> a<00:02:55.610> lot<00:02:55.910> better<00:02:56.060> than<00:02:56.330> a<00:02:56.510> CW<00:02:57.080> so<00:02:57.620> it's<00:02:57.740> a

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
still a lot better than a CW so it's a

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.040 
still a lot better than a CW so it's a
lot<00:02:57.920> easier<00:02:58.130> to<00:02:58.550> control<00:02:58.940> and<00:02:59.450> kill<00:02:59.870> people

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
lot easier to control and kill people

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.780 
lot easier to control and kill people
faster<00:03:00.560> especially<00:03:00.770> since<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:01.490> have<00:03:01.610> higher

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
faster especially since you have higher

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.780 
faster especially since you have higher
damage<00:03:02.110> for<00:03:03.110> the<00:03:03.170> most<00:03:03.350> part<00:03:03.620> when<00:03:04.459> I'm<00:03:04.550> using

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790 
damage for the most part when I'm using

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.640 
damage for the most part when I'm using
these<00:03:05.030> guns<00:03:05.360> i'm<00:03:05.660> using<00:03:06.080> them<00:03:06.290> with<00:03:06.530> the

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
these guns i'm using them with the

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.400 
these guns i'm using them with the
engineer<00:03:07.070> class<00:03:07.280> which<00:03:08.209> i<00:03:08.420> only<00:03:08.780> use<00:03:08.959> on<00:03:09.170> large

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
engineer class which i only use on large

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:12.280 
engineer class which i only use on large
maps<00:03:09.709> and<00:03:10.130> large<00:03:10.640> game<00:03:10.940> modes<00:03:11.209> like<00:03:11.510> conquests

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
maps and large game modes like conquests

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.400 
maps and large game modes like conquests
so<00:03:13.100> having<00:03:13.820> the<00:03:14.060> high<00:03:14.239> damage<00:03:14.570> for<00:03:14.930> long<00:03:15.110> range

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
so having the high damage for long range

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.790 
so having the high damage for long range
and<00:03:15.920> medium<00:03:16.730> range<00:03:16.940> is<00:03:17.209> better<00:03:18.110> in<00:03:18.290> my<00:03:18.470> mind

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:18.800 
and medium range is better in my mind

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.020 
and medium range is better in my mind
then<00:03:19.370> high<00:03:19.760> RPM<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.720> quick<00:03:21.050> reload<00:03:21.410> times<00:03:22.030> is

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
then high RPM and quick reload times is

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.259 
then high RPM and quick reload times is
it<00:03:23.209> just<00:03:23.420> works<00:03:23.780> better<00:03:24.019> with<00:03:24.350> large<00:03:25.040> maps<00:03:25.400> so

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
it just works better with large maps so

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.390 
it just works better with large maps so
you're<00:03:26.420> not<00:03:26.630> getting<00:03:26.959> into<00:03:27.400> close-quarter

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
you're not getting into close-quarter

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.740 
you're not getting into close-quarter
gunfights<00:03:29.440> as<00:03:30.440> much<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:32.209> when<00:03:32.360> it<00:03:32.450> comes<00:03:32.570> to

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
gunfights as much so when it comes to

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.890 
gunfights as much so when it comes to
the<00:03:32.810> attachments<00:03:33.320> i<00:03:33.410> use<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.860> on<00:03:34.190> the<00:03:34.489> ace<00:03:34.610> 52
