00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
drives the graphics hardware and again

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:00.930 
drives the graphics hardware and again
this<00:00:58.360> is<00:00:58.510> an<00:00:58.600> unmodified<00:00:59.409> game<00:00:59.680> right<00:01:00.430> off<00:01:00.640> the

I'm<00:01:07.460> scaring<00:01:07.909> it<00:01:08.090> with<00:01:08.180> the<00:01:08.299> accelerometer

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
I'm scaring it with the accelerometer

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.910 
I'm scaring it with the accelerometer
and<00:01:09.520> even<00:01:10.520> the<00:01:10.610> game<00:01:10.790> I<00:01:10.820> can<00:01:11.150> take<00:01:11.330> full<00:01:11.600> screen
