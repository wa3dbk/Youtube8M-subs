00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
a very very difficult I think

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.080 
a very very difficult I think
all<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:31.770> earthly<00:01:31.979> first<00:01:32.399> you<00:01:32.549> came<00:01:32.759> extremely

all the earthly first you came extremely

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.660 
all the earthly first you came extremely
well<00:01:33.570> it's<00:01:33.810> not<00:01:33.930> easy<00:01:34.140> very<00:01:34.890> tightness<00:01:35.399> like<00:01:35.549> a

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
well it's not easy very tightness like a

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.289 
well it's not easy very tightness like a
bottleneck

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
bottleneck

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:38.360

cars<00:01:58.789> down<00:01:58.880> they<00:01:59.509> simply<00:01:59.869> move<00:02:00.079> the<00:02:00.289> corner<00:02:00.649> in

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:00.799 
cars down they simply move the corner in

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:03.669

and<00:02:01.039> let<00:02:01.220> the<00:02:01.369> racers<00:02:01.729> race<00:02:02.289> it's<00:02:03.289> one<00:02:03.500> of<00:02:03.590> them

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
and let the racers race it's one of them

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:04.929

to<00:02:03.740> see<00:02:03.829> those<00:02:03.979> two<00:02:04.159> Ferraris<00:02:04.399> there<00:02:04.819> they've

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:04.939 
to see those two Ferraris there they've

00:02:04.939 --> 00:02:06.429 
to see those two Ferraris there they've
got<00:02:05.090> their<00:02:05.240> new<00:02:05.390> engines<00:02:05.750> in<00:02:05.899> both<00:02:06.140> we've<00:02:06.319> got

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:06.439 
got their new engines in both we've got

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:08.889 
got their new engines in both we've got
new<00:02:06.590> engines<00:02:06.950> for<00:02:07.130> today's<00:02:07.399> race<00:02:07.670> so<00:02:08.479> let's

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
new engines for today's race so let's

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.479 
new engines for today's race so let's
hope<00:02:09.080> that<00:02:09.200> they<00:02:09.319> hold<00:02:09.560> together<00:02:09.739> that<00:02:10.099> their

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:10.489 
hope that they hold together that their

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.280 
hope that they hold together that their
reliability<00:02:10.879> hasn't<00:02:11.450> been<00:02:11.599> too<00:02:11.810> good<00:02:11.989> of<00:02:12.110> late

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
reliability hasn't been too good of late

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.990 
reliability hasn't been too good of late
a<00:02:12.530> lot<00:02:12.830> of<00:02:12.980> dust<00:02:13.160> they're<00:02:13.400> coming<00:02:13.730> out<00:02:13.819> of<00:02:13.940> the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:14.000 
a lot of dust they're coming out of the

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.970 
a lot of dust they're coming out of the
scary<00:02:14.299> curve<00:02:14.630> but<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.349> makai<00:02:15.620> I<00:02:15.650> think<00:02:15.890> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
scary curve but the makai I think the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.380 
scary curve but the makai I think the
workers<00:02:16.549> have<00:02:16.670> cleared<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.000> up<00:02:17.090> pretty<00:02:17.299> well

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
think when he went off he did seem to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.180 
think when he went off he did seem to

exactly

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.080 
exactly
so<00:03:09.780> I<00:03:09.810> was<00:03:10.079> just<00:03:10.260> just<00:03:10.769> thinking<00:03:11.129> man<00:03:11.579> for<00:03:11.849> God

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
so I was just just thinking man for God

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:13.580 
so I was just just thinking man for God
starts<00:03:12.629> act<00:03:12.840> on<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.049> front<00:03:13.260> of<00:03:13.290> the<00:03:13.379> grid

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
starts act on the front of the grid

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.960 
starts act on the front of the grid
because<00:03:13.890> they<00:03:14.040> haven't<00:03:14.310> completed<00:03:14.430> the<00:03:14.790> lap

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
because they haven't completed the lap

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:16.429 
because they haven't completed the lap
when<00:03:15.150> the<00:03:15.269> red<00:03:15.420> flag<00:03:15.450> came<00:03:15.900> out<00:03:16.079> and<00:03:16.200> I<00:03:16.230> guess

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:16.439 
when the red flag came out and I guess

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:18.440 
when the red flag came out and I guess
the<00:03:16.590> truth<00:03:16.769> of<00:03:16.920> it<00:03:16.980> is<00:03:17.129> yes<00:03:17.519> he<00:03:17.730> can<00:03:17.939> go<00:03:18.180> back<00:03:18.329> to

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:18.450 
the truth of it is yes he can go back to

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.569 
the truth of it is yes he can go back to
the<00:03:18.599> original<00:03:18.930> position<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:20.189> will<00:03:20.370> they<00:03:20.459> have

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:20.579 
the original position but will they have

00:03:20.579 --> 00:03:23.149 
the original position but will they have
to<00:03:20.700> get<00:03:20.849> his<00:03:21.000> training<00:03:21.299> car<00:03:21.599> out<00:03:21.890> well<00:03:22.890> can<00:03:23.069> he

00:03:23.149 --> 00:03:23.159 
to get his training car out well can he

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:25.190 
to get his training car out well can he
start<00:03:23.400> the<00:03:23.489> car<00:03:23.730> that<00:03:23.909> he<00:03:23.970> was<00:03:24.000> in<00:03:24.239> the<00:03:24.989> race

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:25.200 
start the car that he was in the race

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.960 
start the car that he was in the race
being<00:03:25.530> stopped<00:03:26.150> before<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:27.629> end<00:03:27.810> of<00:03:28.049> lap<00:03:28.290> -

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
being stopped before the end of lap -
