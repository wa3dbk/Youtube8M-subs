stalk<00:00:19.710> off<00:00:20.029> here<00:00:21.029> at<00:00:21.090> the<00:00:21.150> bottom<00:00:22.189> and<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.430> will

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
stalk off here at the bottom and I will

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:28.150 
stalk off here at the bottom and I will
probably<00:00:23.970> take<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.689> called<00:00:24.960> this<00:00:25.109> one<00:00:25.289> too

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:34.069 

and<00:00:31.640> what<00:00:32.640> will<00:00:32.759> happen<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:33.840> just<00:00:33.989> cut

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and what will happen is you just cut

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.770 
and what will happen is you just cut
that<00:00:34.170> off<00:00:34.230> this<00:00:34.860> will<00:00:35.010> all<00:00:35.270> grow<00:00:36.270> back<00:00:36.450> as<00:00:36.660> long

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
that off this will all grow back as long

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.200

as<00:00:36.899> I<00:00:36.989> don't<00:00:37.250> clip<00:00:38.250> too<00:00:38.399> much<00:00:38.550> off<00:00:38.760> here<00:00:39.030> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
as I don't clip too much off here I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.690 
as I don't clip too much off here I
think<00:00:39.989> that<00:00:40.079> should<00:00:40.170> be<00:00:40.230> good<00:00:40.500> now<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.340> still

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
get rosemary you grab it and you see how

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.580 
get rosemary you grab it and you see how
it<00:00:59.430> grows<00:00:59.609> this<00:00:59.879> way<00:01:00.289> let<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.350> take<00:01:01.500> your

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
it grows this way let you take your

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:05.210 
it grows this way let you take your
fingers<00:01:03.199> and<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:04.260> put<00:01:04.439> them<00:01:04.500> just<00:01:04.710> like<00:01:04.830> that

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
fingers and you put them just like that

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.560 
fingers and you put them just like that
and<00:01:05.519> then<00:01:05.670> you<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:05.850> run<00:01:06.030> your<00:01:06.060> fingers<00:01:06.479> the

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
and then you just run your fingers the

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.800 
and then you just run your fingers the
opposite<00:01:06.869> direction<00:01:08.210> and<00:01:09.210> that'll<00:01:09.689> probably

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
opposite direction and that'll probably

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:12.469 
opposite direction and that'll probably
pluck<00:01:10.140> off<00:01:10.380> usually<00:01:10.680> does<00:01:11.180> you'll<00:01:12.180> see<00:01:12.330> that

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
pluck off usually does you'll see that

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.780 
pluck off usually does you'll see that
you<00:01:12.659> just<00:01:12.689> basically<00:01:13.409> went<00:01:14.340> through<00:01:14.549> and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you just basically went through and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.030 
you just basically went through and
destem<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.420> whole<00:01:15.540> thing<00:01:15.750> now<00:01:16.470> on<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> end

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
destem the whole thing now on the end

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.350 
destem the whole thing now on the end
you're<00:01:17.549> gonna<00:01:17.640> want<00:01:17.790> to<00:01:17.850> pull<00:01:17.939> it<00:01:18.030> apart<00:01:18.119> by

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
you're gonna want to pull it apart by

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.499 
you're gonna want to pull it apart by
hand<00:01:18.570> a<00:01:18.689> little<00:01:18.810> bit<00:01:18.960> and<00:01:20.150> you<00:01:21.150> get<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> couple

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
hand a little bit and you get a couple

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.640 
hand a little bit and you get a couple
of<00:01:21.659> clusters<00:01:21.810> in<00:01:22.110> there<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.380> nothing<00:01:22.500> to

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
of clusters in there but nothing to

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:23.350 
of clusters in there but nothing to
worry<00:01:22.770> about

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
worry about

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.999 
worry about

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
you know you can go through it a couple

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.429 
you know you can go through it a couple
of<00:01:30.000> times<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.390> want<00:01:30.570> just<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.259> sure<00:01:31.380> you

all off just like this but that does
take<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> very<00:01:38.759> long<00:01:38.939> time<00:01:39.210> so<00:01:39.799> we'll<00:01:40.799> just

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
take a very long time so we'll just

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.969 
take a very long time so we'll just
pluck<00:01:41.159> that<00:01:41.189> as<00:01:41.729> such<00:01:42.649> now<00:01:43.649> for<00:01:43.829> this<00:01:43.920> last

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
pluck that as such now for this last

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.090 
pluck that as such now for this last
piece<00:01:45.290> just<00:01:46.290> going<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.470> give<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.680> a<00:01:46.740> good<00:01:46.860> tug

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
piece just going to give it a good tug

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.840 
piece just going to give it a good tug
as<00:01:47.310> well<00:01:47.540> and<00:01:49.009> the<00:01:50.009> fresher<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.640> rosemary

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
as well and the fresher your rosemary

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.080 
as well and the fresher your rosemary
the<00:01:51.420> easier<00:01:51.869> this<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.380> do<00:01:52.729> when<00:01:53.729> it<00:01:53.820> dries

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
the easier this is to do when it dries

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.090 
the easier this is to do when it dries
up<00:01:54.390> what<00:01:54.780> happens<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.290> it'll<00:01:55.470> snap<00:01:55.740> here<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
up what happens is it'll snap here in

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.620 
up what happens is it'll snap here in
the<00:01:56.189> middle<00:01:56.490> and<00:01:56.640> you'll<00:01:56.759> get<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.420> just<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
the middle and you'll get it's just a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.630 
the middle and you'll get it's just a
problem<00:01:59.210> you<00:02:00.210> want<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.450> avoid<00:02:00.659> that<00:02:00.869> too<00:02:01.640> and

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
problem you want to avoid that too and

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.389 
problem you want to avoid that too and
your<00:02:03.570> fingers<00:02:03.930> should<00:02:04.350> now<00:02:04.530> be<00:02:05.130> kind<00:02:05.340> of

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
your fingers should now be kind of

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.249 
your fingers should now be kind of
sticky<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:05.909> they<00:02:06.719> should<00:02:06.869> smell<00:02:06.990> wonderful

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
sticky and they should smell wonderful

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:12.300 
sticky and they should smell wonderful
so<00:02:08.179> there<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.420> all<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:10.259> our<00:02:10.349> picked<00:02:10.920> rosemary

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.310 
so there is all of our picked rosemary

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:13.920 
so there is all of our picked rosemary
now<00:02:13.180> we're<00:02:13.330> going<00:02:13.420> to<00:02:13.480> do<00:02:13.600> is<00:02:13.750> we're<00:02:13.840> gonna

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
now we're going to do is we're gonna

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.300 
now we're going to do is we're gonna
take<00:02:14.110> our<00:02:14.230> knife<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.710> we're<00:02:14.950> going<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.130> chop

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
take our knife and we're going to chop

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.530 
take our knife and we're going to chop
this<00:02:15.460> up<00:02:15.640> a<00:02:15.730> little<00:02:15.820> bit<00:02:16.030> because<00:02:16.180> it's<00:02:16.330> just<00:02:16.480> a

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:16.540 
this up a little bit because it's just a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.040 
this up a little bit because it's just a
little<00:02:16.630> too<00:02:16.810> big<00:02:16.960> the<00:02:17.110> way<00:02:17.200> it<00:02:17.290> is<00:02:17.410> so<00:02:18.960> just<00:02:19.960> uh

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
little too big the way it is so just uh

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:29.820 
little too big the way it is so just uh
one<00:02:23.050> pass<00:02:23.290> probably<00:02:28.170> and<00:02:29.170> it'll<00:02:29.530> probably<00:02:29.620> go

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:29.830 
one pass probably and it'll probably go

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:31.290 
one pass probably and it'll probably go
everywhere<00:02:30.070> when<00:02:30.190> you<00:02:30.220> chop<00:02:30.459> it<00:02:30.610> and<00:02:30.700> so<00:02:30.880> be

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
everywhere when you chop it and so be

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:41.490 
everywhere when you chop it and so be
aware<00:02:31.360> of<00:02:31.570> that<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:40.090> try<00:02:40.660> to<00:02:40.870> use<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.260> dried

00:02:41.490 --> 00:02:41.500 
aware of that and try to use the dried

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.050 
aware of that and try to use the dried
stuff<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:41.890> you<00:02:42.010> don't<00:02:42.459> have<00:02:42.580> to<00:02:42.760> because<00:02:42.970> it's

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
stuff if you don't have to because it's

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.449 
stuff if you don't have to because it's
pretty<00:02:43.450> terrible<00:02:44.110> it<00:02:45.100> doesn't<00:02:45.340> have<00:02:45.430> nearly

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:45.459 
pretty terrible it doesn't have nearly

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:50.460 
pretty terrible it doesn't have nearly
the<00:02:45.820> punch<00:02:46.739> and<00:02:47.739> now<00:02:48.000> we<00:02:49.000> have<00:02:49.290> run<00:02:50.290> about

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470 
the punch and now we have run about

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:53.190 
the punch and now we have run about
three<00:02:51.459> or<00:02:51.550> four<00:02:51.700> tablespoons<00:02:51.870> of<00:02:52.870> fresh

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
three or four tablespoons of fresh

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.350
