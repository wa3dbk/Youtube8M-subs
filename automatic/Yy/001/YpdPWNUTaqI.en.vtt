00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:57.839 
I've ridden before this is a full-on

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:00.320 
I've ridden before this is a full-on
kind<00:00:58.110> of<00:00:58.170> race<00:00:58.350> tuned<00:00:58.589> version<00:00:59.150> just<00:01:00.150> right

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:00.330

now<00:01:00.479> just<00:01:00.659> about<00:01:00.839> everyday<00:01:01.080> get<00:01:01.350> the

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:01.409 
now just about everyday get the

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:02.930 
now just about everyday get the
impression<00:01:01.589> that<00:01:01.799> it's<00:01:01.890> just<00:01:02.129> it's<00:01:02.699> big

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
impression that it's just it's big

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.670 
impression that it's just it's big
better<00:01:03.330> one<00:01:03.629> it's<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:03.960> lot<00:01:04.110> heavier<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> bigger

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
better one it's a lot heavier and bigger

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.950 
better one it's a lot heavier and bigger
but<00:01:05.670> while<00:01:05.909> there's<00:01:06.119> a<00:01:06.180> lot<00:01:06.270> of<00:01:06.390> latent<00:01:06.720> power

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
but while there's a lot of latent power

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.320 
but while there's a lot of latent power
underneath<00:01:07.229> that<00:01:07.549> it's<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:08.820> very<00:01:09.030> different

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
underneath that it's very very different

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.899 
underneath that it's very very different
right<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> feels<00:01:09.600> bigger<00:01:09.930> heavier<00:01:10.580> but<00:01:11.580> I<00:01:11.729> like

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
right it feels bigger heavier but I like

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:13.670 
right it feels bigger heavier but I like
you<00:01:12.180> so<00:01:12.360> it<00:01:12.480> will<00:01:12.600> come<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.080> quite<00:01:13.380> it's

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680 
you so it will come it's quite it's

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.620 
you so it will come it's quite it's
because<00:01:14.670> that<00:01:14.790> precedent<00:01:15.030> being<00:01:15.270> almost<00:01:15.420> like

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
because that precedent being almost like

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.340 
because that precedent being almost like
a<00:01:16.020> very<00:01:16.920> very<00:01:17.220> fast<00:01:17.580> boat<00:01:18.570> stall<00:01:18.900> instead<00:01:19.290> of

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
a very very fast boat stall instead of

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.780 
a very very fast boat stall instead of
being<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.590> full-on<00:01:19.860> kind<00:01:20.070> of<00:01:20.130> sports<00:01:20.400> bike<00:01:20.610> if

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
being the full-on kind of sports bike if

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.950 
being the full-on kind of sports bike if
that<00:01:20.940> makes<00:01:21.120> sense

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that makes sense

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.690 
that makes sense
but<00:01:22.290> obviously<00:01:22.380> it's<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.980> is<00:01:23.160> for<00:01:23.610> long

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
but obviously it's not it is for long

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:26.000 
but obviously it's not it is for long
sports<00:01:24.000> bike<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.480> is<00:01:24.600> rather<00:01:25.010> rather

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:26.010 
sports bike and it is rather rather

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:40.130 
literally but it feels really

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:42.040 
literally but it feels really
well-balanced<00:06:40.940> having<00:06:41.240> the<00:06:41.330> kind<00:06:41.509> of<00:06:41.569> to
