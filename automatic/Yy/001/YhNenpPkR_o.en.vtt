which<00:00:46.640> I've<00:00:46.790> already<00:00:47.000> taken<00:00:47.360> some<00:00:47.660> out

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:50.590 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.490 

and<00:00:51.100> then<00:00:51.220> there's<00:00:51.430> two<00:00:52.560> in<00:00:53.560> the<00:00:53.740> middle<00:00:53.980> here

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
and then there's two in the middle here

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.270 
and then there's two in the middle here
here<00:00:57.900> once<00:00:58.900> you<00:00:59.020> have<00:00:59.050> all<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.350> screws<00:00:59.590> out<00:00:59.860> I

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
here once you have all the screws out I

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.250 
here once you have all the screws out I
like<00:01:00.730> to<00:01:00.880> start<00:01:01.090> on<00:01:01.210> this<00:01:01.420> side<00:01:01.480> with<00:01:01.810> the<00:01:01.840> USB

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260 
like to start on this side with the USB

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.320 
like to start on this side with the USB
ports<00:01:02.650> because<00:01:03.430> you<00:01:03.670> have<00:01:03.760> to<00:01:03.880> work<00:01:04.030> it<00:01:04.180> over

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:04.330 
ports because you have to work it over

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:11.370 
ports because you have to work it over
all<00:01:05.110> these<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:07.830> up<00:01:08.830> here<00:01:10.050> work<00:01:11.050> your<00:01:11.260> way<00:01:11.350> over

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
all these so up here work your way over

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.740 
all these so up here work your way over
and<00:01:12.420> slide<00:01:13.420> it<00:01:13.570> off<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.720> back

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:16.750 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.240 

now<00:01:17.290> the<00:01:17.410> next<00:01:17.740> step<00:01:17.980> is<00:01:20.100> removing<00:01:21.100> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
now the next step is removing the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.140 
now the next step is removing the
wireless<00:01:21.760> card<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.680> under<00:01:24.520> this<00:01:24.700> little<00:01:25.000> piece

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
wireless card so under this little piece

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:33.399 
wireless card so under this little piece
of<00:01:25.330> tape<00:01:25.480> here<00:01:28.500> there's<00:01:29.500> one<00:01:29.710> screw

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:34.810 

and<00:01:33.860> that<00:01:34.040> one's<00:01:34.159> a<00:01:34.220> little<00:01:34.280> harder<00:01:34.640> to<00:01:34.729> get

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
and that one's a little harder to get

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.700 
and that one's a little harder to get
out<00:01:35.000> so<00:01:35.570> they<00:01:35.720> usually<00:01:35.930> use<00:01:36.259> a<00:01:36.290> little<00:01:36.470> bit

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
out so they usually use a little bit

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:43.510 
out so they usually use a little bit
bigger<00:01:36.920> head<00:01:37.220> on<00:01:37.369> the<00:01:37.490> screwdriver

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.330 

it<00:01:43.909> lifts<00:01:44.270> up<00:01:44.420> and<00:01:45.380> pull<00:01:45.679> straight<00:01:45.859> out<00:01:47.200> now

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:48.340 
it lifts up and pull straight out now

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.600 
it lifts up and pull straight out now
all<00:01:49.340> this<00:01:49.549> left<00:01:49.880> is<00:01:50.210> to<00:01:50.450> remove<00:01:50.689> one<00:01:51.170> screw

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610 
all this left is to remove one screw

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.520 
all this left is to remove one screw
right<00:01:52.610> here

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.340 

now<00:02:00.100> lift<00:02:00.340> your<00:02:00.430> hard<00:02:00.730> drive<00:02:01.000> and<00:02:01.750> gently<00:02:02.110> pull

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:02.350 
now lift your hard drive and gently pull

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.050 
now lift your hard drive and gently pull
out<00:02:02.700> and<00:02:03.700> there<00:02:04.060> you<00:02:04.090> have<00:02:04.620> your<00:02:05.620> hard<00:02:05.830> drive

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
out and there you have your hard drive

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.240 
out and there you have your hard drive
so<00:02:07.060> then<00:02:07.210> just<00:02:08.140> take<00:02:08.649> out<00:02:08.800> these<00:02:08.979> two<00:02:09.220> screws

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
so then just take out these two screws

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.030 
so then just take out these two screws
and<00:02:10.060> replace<00:02:10.300> it<00:02:10.810> on<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.340> new<00:02:13.000> hard<00:02:13.270> drive

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 
and replace it on the new hard drive

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.920 
and replace it on the new hard drive
well<00:02:15.040> then

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:17.930 

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:30.340 

pop<00:02:18.500> it<00:02:18.680> back<00:02:18.709> in<00:02:20.409> replace<00:02:21.409> this<00:02:21.769> screw

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.070 

then<00:02:31.040> carefully<00:02:32.000> put<00:02:32.480> the<00:02:32.570> wireless<00:02:32.900> card

then carefully put the wireless card
back<00:02:33.320> in<00:02:33.590> make<00:02:33.890> sure<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.130> don't<00:02:34.280> bend<00:02:34.460> any<00:02:34.670> of

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
back in make sure you don't bend any of

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.960 
back in make sure you don't bend any of
these<00:02:36.190> usually<00:02:37.190> you<00:02:37.310> won't<00:02:37.520> but<00:02:37.670> you<00:02:37.730> never

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:37.970 
these usually you won't but you never

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.310 
these usually you won't but you never
know<00:02:38.210> and<00:02:38.800> screw<00:02:39.800> down<00:02:39.940> this<00:02:40.940> screw<00:02:44.320> it's

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
know and screw down this screw it's

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:59.930 
know and screw down this screw it's
stuck<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:46.070> the<00:02:46.190> tape

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.840 

so<00:03:00.450> once<00:03:00.630> your<00:03:00.720> hands<00:03:00.840> take<00:03:00.990> it<00:03:01.140> from<00:03:01.290> the<00:03:01.410> tape

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:01.850 
so once your hands take it from the tape

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.940 
so once your hands take it from the tape
screw<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:03.060> screw<00:03:03.240> down

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.650 

I<00:03:08.010> should<00:03:08.670> step<00:03:08.940> back<00:03:09.000> on<00:03:09.360> there

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
I should step back on there

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.700 
I should step back on there
and<00:03:11.080> then<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.380> take<00:03:11.680> your<00:03:12.580> case<00:03:13.260> and<00:03:14.260> I<00:03:14.530> like

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
and then you take your case and I like

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.800 
and then you take your case and I like
to<00:03:14.860> start<00:03:15.100> with<00:03:15.160> the<00:03:15.340> side<00:03:15.550> with<00:03:15.760> the<00:03:15.940> VGA<00:03:16.690> and

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:16.810 
to start with the side with the VGA and

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.130 
to start with the side with the VGA and
audio<00:03:17.500> and<00:03:17.770> USB<00:03:18.280> ports<00:03:19.110> slide<00:03:20.110> it<00:03:20.260> over<00:03:20.380> it

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
audio and USB ports slide it over it

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:29.430 
audio and USB ports slide it over it
then<00:03:24.120> snap<00:03:25.120> it<00:03:25.150> back<00:03:27.690> into<00:03:28.690> place<00:03:29.020> make<00:03:29.410> sure

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
then snap it back into place make sure

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.560 
then snap it back into place make sure
you<00:03:29.710> those<00:03:29.890> are<00:03:30.070> aligned<00:03:30.610> right<00:03:30.850> with<00:03:31.090> the<00:03:31.240> USB

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
you those are aligned right with the USB

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
you those are aligned right with the USB
ports<00:03:31.960> on<00:03:32.050> that<00:03:32.200> side<00:03:33.900> of<00:03:34.900> things<00:03:35.200> that<00:03:35.350> snap
