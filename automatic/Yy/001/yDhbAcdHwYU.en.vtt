as if we all know the economy had a

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.370 
as if we all know the economy had a
little<00:04:01.850> bit<00:04:01.940> of<00:04:02.000> a<00:04:02.060> downturn<00:04:02.270> but<00:04:02.990> the<00:04:03.110> reining

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:03.380 
little bit of a downturn but the reining

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:06.160 
little bit of a downturn but the reining
horses<00:04:03.790> just<00:04:04.790> haven't<00:04:05.120> felt<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.510> hit<00:04:05.990> I

horses just haven't felt that hit I

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:08.380
