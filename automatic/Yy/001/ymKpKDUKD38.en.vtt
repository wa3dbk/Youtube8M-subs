a heavy-duty ground sheet as well but

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:46.580 
a heavy-duty ground sheet as well but
here<00:00:33.630> it's<00:00:34.410> a<00:00:34.500> bit<00:00:34.649> so<00:00:45.050> and<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.140> also<00:00:46.289> comes

here it's a bit so and it also comes
with<00:00:47.149> enough<00:00:48.149> pokes<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.539> pack<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> down<00:00:48.870> on<00:00:49.110> all

with enough pokes to pack it down on all
the<00:00:49.260> different<00:00:49.410> peg<00:00:49.649> prints<00:00:51.920> let's<00:00:52.920> just<00:00:53.039> get

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
the different peg prints let's just get

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.250 
the different peg prints let's just get
the<00:00:53.250> bag<00:00:53.399> away

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the bag away

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.350 
the bag away
so<00:00:56.100> as<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.370> see<00:00:56.430> it's<00:00:56.790> a<00:00:56.910> pretty<00:00:57.059> much

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
so as you can see it's a pretty much

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.660 
so as you can see it's a pretty much
tried<00:00:57.720> and<00:00:57.899> tested<00:00:58.050> pram<00:00:58.950> pod<00:00:59.130> type<00:00:59.309> design

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
tried and tested pram pod type design

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.370 
tried and tested pram pod type design
rather<00:01:00.390> similar<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.050> already

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:01.380 
rather similar to the already

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.170 
rather similar to the already
established<00:01:01.980> other<00:01:02.100> size<00:01:02.340> fish<00:01:02.550> is<00:01:02.670> it's<00:01:03.120> just

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
established other size fish is it's just

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.109 
established other size fish is it's just
the<00:01:03.329> next<00:01:03.540> step<00:01:03.629> forward<00:01:04.220> so<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.850> is<00:01:05.940> just<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
the next step forward so this is just a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.219 
the next step forward so this is just a
quick<00:01:06.270> demo<00:01:06.510> for<00:01:06.780> our<00:01:06.930> easy<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.260> goes<00:01:07.350> up<00:01:09.229> so

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
quick demo for our easy it goes up so

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.890 
quick demo for our easy it goes up so
the<00:01:10.470> first<00:01:10.710> thing<00:01:10.830> to<00:01:10.920> do<00:01:11.330> is<00:01:12.330> just<00:01:12.540> straighten

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
the first thing to do is just straighten

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.719 
the first thing to do is just straighten
it<00:01:12.960> all<00:01:13.050> out<00:01:15.890> and<00:01:16.890> then<00:01:16.950> it's<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.190> simple<00:01:17.490> case

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
it all out and then it's a simple case

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:31.490 
it all out and then it's a simple case
of<00:01:19.369> just<00:01:20.420> attaching<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> poles<00:01:30.320> last<00:01:31.320> ones

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
of just attaching the poles last ones

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:39.639 
of just attaching the poles last ones
attached<00:01:33.890> you<00:01:34.890> just<00:01:35.039> get<00:01:35.160> the<00:01:35.220> tension<00:01:35.430> strip

00:01:39.639 --> 00:01:39.649 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:44.780 

hook<00:01:40.649> it<00:01:40.800> onto<00:01:41.060> this<00:01:42.060> little<00:01:42.330> loop<00:01:42.450> here

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.370 

and<00:01:45.750> all<00:01:46.320> right<00:01:46.530> cross<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:46.920> other<00:01:46.980> side<00:01:48.380> just

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
and all right cross the other side just

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:50.810 
and all right cross the other side just
to<00:01:49.530> tension<00:01:50.070> it<00:01:50.160> open<00:01:50.340> create<00:01:50.610> the<00:01:50.670> dome

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
to tension it open create the dome

00:01:50.820 --> 00:02:02.930 
to tension it open create the dome
effect<00:01:58.880> as<00:01:59.880> you<00:02:00.000> can<00:02:00.150> see<00:02:01.550> it<00:02:02.550> just<00:02:02.730> goes<00:02:02.880> up

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
effect as you can see it just goes up

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.660 
effect as you can see it just goes up
like<00:02:03.210> a<00:02:03.420> yeah<00:02:03.600> like<00:02:03.900> a<00:02:03.930> pram<00:02:04.170> would<00:02:04.520> we<00:02:05.520> then

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
like a yeah like a pram would we then

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:19.760 
like a yeah like a pram would we then
need<00:02:05.790> to<00:02:05.820> get<00:02:06.000> these<00:02:07.340> tension<00:02:08.340> poles<00:02:18.590> now<00:02:19.590> back

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
need to get these tension poles now back

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.230 
need to get these tension poles now back
in<00:02:19.890> old<00:02:20.040> days<00:02:20.160> these<00:02:20.370> builders<00:02:20.670> just<00:02:20.910> used<00:02:21.090> to

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:21.240 
in old days these builders just used to

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.380 
in old days these builders just used to
peg<00:02:22.170> into<00:02:22.380> the<00:02:22.470> ground<00:02:22.940> what<00:02:23.940> a<00:02:23.970> lot<00:02:24.090> of<00:02:24.120> people

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
peg into the ground what a lot of people

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.630 
peg into the ground what a lot of people
throw<00:02:24.600> open<00:02:24.720> front<00:02:25.110> such<00:02:25.350> as<00:02:25.440> myself<00:02:25.709> so<00:02:26.520> it's

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
throw open front such as myself so it's

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.060 
throw open front such as myself so it's
a<00:02:26.670> lot<00:02:26.790> easier<00:02:26.940> just<00:02:27.090> to<00:02:27.270> get<00:02:27.420> these<00:02:28.070> straps

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:29.070 
a lot easier just to get these straps

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.690 
a lot easier just to get these straps
just<00:02:29.130> to<00:02:29.400> just<00:02:30.390> keep<00:02:30.540> it<00:02:30.630> all<00:02:30.690> attention<00:02:31.700> so

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
just to just keep it all attention so

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.070 
just to just keep it all attention so
this<00:02:32.820> one<00:02:33.000> fits<00:02:33.240> into<00:02:33.420> the<00:02:33.510> nice<00:02:33.660> little<00:02:33.900> slot

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.080 
this one fits into the nice little slot

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.380 
this one fits into the nice little slot
there<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.600> the<00:02:36.720> two<00:02:36.930> bolts<00:02:38.120> pick<00:02:39.120> it<00:02:39.239> into

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
there and the two bolts pick it into

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.630 
there and the two bolts pick it into
place<00:02:39.600> and<00:02:40.760> then<00:02:41.760> tension<00:02:42.209> it<00:02:42.300> out<00:02:43.640> and

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
place and then tension it out and

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.420 
place and then tension it out and
tighten<00:02:44.880> it<00:02:45.030> back<00:02:45.090> up<00:02:45.209> again<00:02:46.070> as<00:02:47.070> you<00:02:47.190> can<00:02:47.310> see

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:49.670 
there's a couple of different ends here

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.820 
there's a couple of different ends here
so<00:02:50.670> you'll<00:02:51.660> need<00:02:51.780> this<00:02:51.959> and<00:02:52.410> there's<00:02:52.560> window

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
and they do the packing point to pretty

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.800 
and they do the packing point to pretty
much<00:03:04.470> self-explanatory<00:03:05.540> adipex<00:03:06.540> route

attention<00:03:07.769> it

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.380 
attention it

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.980 
attention it
push<00:03:09.950> it<00:03:10.100> down<00:03:10.540> let's<00:03:11.540> take<00:03:11.660> the<00:03:11.720> blended

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:11.990 
push it down let's take the blended

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:13.860 
push it down let's take the blended
strap<00:03:12.200> over<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.410> top<00:03:12.500> for<00:03:12.830> extra<00:03:13.130> security

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.380 
from the internal ventilation material
so<00:03:18.500> we<00:03:18.590> just<00:03:18.740> put<00:03:19.070> that<00:03:19.160> in<00:03:19.280> this<00:03:19.370> so<00:03:20.030> mutters

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
so we just put that in this so mutters

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:26.290 
so we just put that in this so mutters
that<00:03:20.950> put<00:03:21.950> it<00:03:22.040> both<00:03:22.190> sides<00:03:24.400> down<00:03:25.400> now<00:03:26.120> as<00:03:26.210> you

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:26.300 
that put it both sides down now as you

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:28.780 
that put it both sides down now as you
can<00:03:26.390> see<00:03:26.450> here's<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.840> Bibby<00:03:27.050> setup<00:03:27.440> and<00:03:28.370> it's

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
can see here's the Bibby setup and it's

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.250 
can see here's the Bibby setup and it's
pretty<00:03:29.030> sturdy<00:03:29.330> not<00:03:29.690> going<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.900> lead<00:03:30.020> on<00:03:30.140> this

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
pretty sturdy not going to lead on this

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.580 
pretty sturdy not going to lead on this
and<00:03:30.470> I'm<00:03:31.280> not<00:03:31.430> exactly<00:03:31.670> light<00:03:32.200> these<00:03:33.200> bars<00:03:33.440> are

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590 
and I'm not exactly light these bars are

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.750 
and I'm not exactly light these bars are
quite<00:03:33.740> solid<00:03:34.010> especially<00:03:34.310> this<00:03:34.370> black<00:03:34.550> bar

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:34.760 
quite solid especially this black bar

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:35.950 
quite solid especially this black bar
here<00:03:34.940> which<00:03:34.970> was<00:03:35.180> the<00:03:35.210> main<00:03:35.360> supporting<00:03:35.750> bar

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.570 
here which was the main supporting bar
that's<00:03:36.680> not<00:03:36.770> gonna<00:03:36.860> go<00:03:37.010> anywhere<00:03:37.310> you<00:03:37.490> know

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
that's not gonna go anywhere you know

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:39.340 
that's not gonna go anywhere you know
you<00:03:37.640> can<00:03:38.270> throw<00:03:38.390> some<00:03:38.510> pretty<00:03:39.170> nasty

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:39.350 
you can throw some pretty nasty

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:40.570 
you can throw some pretty nasty
conditions<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.010> that's<00:03:40.160> and<00:03:40.280> that's<00:03:40.400> going

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
conditions that that's and that's going

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:43.630 
conditions that that's and that's going
to<00:03:40.640> stay<00:03:40.790> in<00:03:40.910> place<00:03:41.950> this<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.010> the<00:03:43.130> dual<00:03:43.340> panel

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
to stay in place this is the dual panel

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.220 
to stay in place this is the dual panel
so<00:03:43.970> you<00:03:44.000> can<00:03:44.090> have<00:03:44.240> the<00:03:44.360> module<00:03:45.080> power

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:45.230 
so you can have the module power

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.720 
so you can have the module power
completely<00:03:45.680> down<00:03:46.210> basically<00:03:47.210> back<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:48.700> get<00:03:49.700> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
what you prefer pull it back a bit more

what you prefer pull it back a bit more
to<00:03:54.710> get<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:54.890> mozzie<00:03:55.040> panel<00:03:55.960> the<00:03:56.960> day<00:03:57.110> of<00:03:57.200> those

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
to get the mozzie panel the day of those

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.050 
to get the mozzie panel the day of those
opens<00:03:58.190> you'd<00:03:58.310> expect<00:03:58.640> so<00:03:58.730> you<00:03:58.760> can<00:03:58.910> roll<00:03:59.030> it

probably<00:04:45.920> just<00:04:46.040> about<00:04:46.310> fit<00:04:46.520> two<00:04:46.640> beds<00:04:46.670> in<00:04:47.150> here

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
probably just about fit two beds in here

probably just about fit two beds in here
but<00:04:47.480> assume<00:04:47.800> you<00:04:48.800> know<00:04:48.920> it's<00:04:49.040> it's<00:04:49.460> designed
