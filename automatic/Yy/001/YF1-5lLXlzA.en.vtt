00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.650

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:39.460
 possible on the field and also outside 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:45.979
 Do you know the thing that most affected me? 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:49.280
 Enjoyed the conversation with baby going to play. 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:51.439
 with Flemish Flemish ready when 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.649
 It's classic, it's classic, there's no way it 's 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.590
 here on the river in São Paulo and in Europe and 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:59.630
 I could see that reality is well 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.399
 great 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:06.020
 the statements of the president 

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:09.590
 really let's say the word bug 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.600
 So that's cool, I think the 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.010
 classic is one of the most beautiful moments 

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:19.130
 and this pressure on this 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.530
 tension the idea of ​​these games and 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:24.310
 I hope to come back is ready to go to this 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.310
