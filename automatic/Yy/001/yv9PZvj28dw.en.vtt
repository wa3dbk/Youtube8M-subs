00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.290
 welcome to the overbergplatz 2013 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.790
 with the brand new revo now too 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.400
 will finally be in germany soon 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.040
 regus we have this, it is also 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.300
 Wired are the headphones service 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.710
 but only headphones are above all else 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.839
 the wines are interesting because 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.730
 you can drive it by nfc and that the 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.520
 unboxing so let's go right now 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.890
 had to and only make the two films 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.230
 or so close tesafilm here 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.090
 pull up, so to speak, and then we come 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.170
 also fast in the box when 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.300
 I am strong 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.130
 a week mobile effect is no more 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.500
 quite simply on the other side too 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:36.239
 Again we do not expect that now 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.960
 but we have too many packaging in it 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.940
 are excited 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.770
 the price would have to be over 200 euros 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.059
 for the election is and by the 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.160
 Wired there are two again 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:47.670
 versions then twice accordingly 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 So we have prices once 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.520
 a black box you see what here 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.199
 it will be in there, I think a cable 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 You can also get it wired 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.770
 use the wireless just like you 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.770
 we can once have a usb 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.059
 Charging cable in orange micro-usb course 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.390
 So , for example, could also for 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.930
 your 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:09.689
 For example, phones are used 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:12.420
 smartphones then we have a standard 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.009
 three and a half meters connection and both 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.149
 end this is finally what you 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:17.580
 Plug in your headphones 

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:19.049
 the headphones and the phone call you can 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.770
 as well as vice versa because they both 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:24.479
 are exactly the same and here is also 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:25.979
 microphone is not forgotten 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.600
 So she uses wired 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.530
 could thus also calls to the with the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.420
 1 button percent on android and ios and 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:35.429
 Of course, a small bag, too 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.750
 we already from jabba cam this standard 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:38.759
 bag here actually too 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.770
 sound through lets in the scenarios 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.179
 it does not really exist but you can 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.450
 wonderful to pull up nice and there 

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:47.429
 the headphones are still so natural 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.959
 something to read here getting started and 

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:52.049
 I think here are also still 

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:53.610
 sticker and similar in it exactly yourself 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.009
 a few things but that's what I want now 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.039
 Not so much from this accept the 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:02.340
 here are papers and of course those 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.170
 revo himself here with one 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.240
 velcro on it are beautiful but is 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:11.940
 Strongly built in here when you buy them 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:15.070
 should I work so well 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.170
 and always look at us we have them 

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:18.550
 on the mwc it's been seen before 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:21.720
 came as you can fold so 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.310
 they are actually ideal for take away 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.350
 is really very comfortable and nice small 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.050
 and above all you can here a 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.950
 of course, the size 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.470
 foreign law book so measured at least 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.960
 five centimeters here on both sides 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:36.190
 so that they are comfortable for everyone 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.020
 sets on then comes seen 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.760
 and at least look up 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.110
 push down a bit and already 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:43.270
 we have really comfortable here 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:44.770
 headphones that are already here 

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:45.550
 Sound a bit for me then wants to get out 

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.470
 here in the hall 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:48.850
 So I hear myself now more like 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.710
 anything that happens around me 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.240
 but active they suddenly do not have 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.710
 already a bit hard for us 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.180
 we have here that is of course the 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:56.860
 micro-usb-connection as already said 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:59.920
 here could be bluetooth pairing 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:01.990
 turn on and then turn on 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.220
 we still have two status leds what i have 

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:05.440
 So you can also show it for a short time 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.580
 that lights up a corresponding green and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.750
 if I have long bluetooth on it 

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.790
 it stays that way I think it starts 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.060
 blue blinking right there it looks too 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.230
 beautiful 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.150
 and then of course I can tap 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.100
 of course you can still be interesting 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:17.080
 not only the whole thing with all driven 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:20.110
 but also operate accordingly 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.460
 rather the wireless of our touch 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.260
 design here and one with is on 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.960
 player points can rotate accordingly 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.240
 for volume and I still believe it 

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:29.410
 another gesture going forward and back 

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:31.210
 but it actually looks like it even here 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.760
 So touch twice on one side 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.900
 then it's the last song and stuff 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.640
 further and on the other side 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:38.080
 until then installed accordingly nfc 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.030
 that means you can use your smartphone 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.280
 Take for example samsung galaxy s3 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:43.630
 Just put it on and you're done 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.850
 bluetooth connected and you do not have to 

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.360
 enter the pairing mode and so on 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.130
 and so on 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:51.190
 and yes that suits a chance of that 

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:52.570
 first impression of the first 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.460
 Hands on and we can see it too 

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:56.650
 still very stable here i want the 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.360
 Sony for example or the as well as public 

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:59.650
 So that should not be so 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.120
 easily break and that they are 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.350
 completely made of metal here too 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.240
 So you really like the picture 

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:05.260
 high quality and is also in the 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:07.300
 I know, as I already said 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:09.760
 this monument for the time being only in 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:11.350
 watched my name black and white 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.130
 Balazs came with the first unboxing 

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:15.900
 of the brand new revo here from jabra to 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.970
 next time 

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:21.600
 from the upper basin in 2013 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.600
 watched
