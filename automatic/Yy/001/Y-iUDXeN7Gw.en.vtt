00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.070
 very good to all and welcome once 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.570
 more to my YouTube channel in the video of 

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.790
 today we are going to explain is the second 

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.410
 version of how to save ya lights in 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.820
 English knobs to the side in Spanish 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:13.379
 for you for the people who are with me 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.360
 asking for Castilian so well let's go 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:17.189
 to apply a little the best the best 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.110
 ways to save this is the second 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:23.420
 version and we go to day 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.840
 well I repeat as same champion same 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:29.870
 dynamic bouquets due to the speed 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.880
 do not want to explain is a guard that 

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.200
 many people forget to do and this happens 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.110
 a lot in just that also premium of vale 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.510
 for example at level 1 people usually 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.000
 come here to defend this site this 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.309
 site this site this site does not foresee 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.840
 is that they invade and invade you 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.340
 just from here and lose this vision 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.320
 what you have to do is nothing but 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.970
 are invading you start running and 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.650
 drop is a guard loose a guard 

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.090
 in order to have enough information 

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.880
 how many people are invading you 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.920
 how many people go where they are and if or if 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.420
 they are here to change or not the second 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:04.329
 guard to explain is from here 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.329
 I hope I have the hot and it's perfect 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.840
 perfect 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.759
 you come here and it was you put us well 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.790
 glued to the wall and with the distance 

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:15.280
 what do you have of the guard 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.380
 and I'm not wrong now perfect 

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.850
 you release and this one is guaros of vision 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:20.260
 of all this gives you insight if you are here 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.090
 if you are waiting to do is the king 

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.530
 if they even do it, try to leave 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.540
 this side or even try to invade by 

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:27.790
 here another important thing to explain 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.710
 is when you read in the jungle a little weak 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:32.800
 guy ramus for example and you're playing 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.840
 against leasing or against harman or 

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.600
 against a euro or against the money that you 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:39.070
 can invade level 2 so what 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.440
 you have to do is come here you get 

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.750
 in this magical stone and you throw a 

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.160
 keep right behind this is good 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.050
 television from the whole back you 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:48.160
 they give up a little bit of vision of the river and what 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.690
 what do you get that this is that you do not get 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.640
 they can invade then that starts 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.350
 the red ten start doing and you always 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.850
 with what you put here here you already have 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.790
 complete vision that you are not going to come 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.900
 by no means is it worth 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.560
 now let's apply some guards 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.000
 on the lines both bot and top as 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.280
 save against different jungles by 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.660
 example if this is how much we count the 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.520
 better way we have great poster 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.920
 or by line that would look pretty 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:14.050
 obvious or by river that is the most logical 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.730
 is worth the way to stop a bouquets that you 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.850
 can invade is you put the guard or 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.470
 here or here mostly 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.090
 I'm going to put it here you can also put 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:24.400
 here for rambus speed and you have to 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.110
 make your mid and save this area for 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.510
 that they do not take and from behind so 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.190
 you have all this area of yours you can only 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.620
 enter by line and it's completely is 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:33.730
 easy to stop it or to see it not the 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.200
 second letter that I will explain goes to 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.760
 be against leasing if you are when 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.490
 leasing account for example leasing in 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.580
 the gang that he mostly does is from 

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:45.340
 this wall here and from here for a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.870
 guard has w and have to a lot 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:48.490
 people for a guard that they contract without and 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.840
 it is completely wrong the best 

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:51.550
 way to see them for example if you are 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.030
 playing cargo and they pose top against 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.620
 leasing 

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:55.510
 The best way for a 20 leasing is 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.770
 I came here and put this guard with this 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.120
 saves television from this part 

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.530
 here is the vision of all this part 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.000
 here and televised all this part here 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.620
 it's good I made you a lot against 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000
 champions against him and simply in a 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.260
 They 're going to bite because it's the 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.180
 only account I have but that's a 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.760
 little which you have to put it 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.129
 and it's for example that lease traction 

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.469
 is a character that foresees the six before 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:16.329
 Level 6 can only be for you 

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:18.879
 line is worth only only carpo 

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:20.409
 line so the simple way 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.000
 stopping it is fine it is to the bottom of your 

00:03:20.409 --> 00:03:23.709
 line you put a guard at the beginning to the 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.819
 idea and that's it and you can go because it was 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.280
 start has to make me stay by 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:29.049
 here around here and it's very obvious from 

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.700
 see where you are going to be and very obvious from 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:33.879
 stop it and finally what I'm going to 

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.930
 explain is going to be two ways 2 pink 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:39.760
 very deep wars or guards that 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.099
 they can put on and they are super useful for 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:43.840
 example we are in the top part 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.700
 we have a language of inventory and 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:47.200
 we see some enemy in the bot part if 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.389
 we come here fast fast fast and 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:50.980
 we released a pin guard here is pin 

00:03:49.389 --> 00:03:53.019
 guard will possibly last you all 

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.730
 game or almost the entire game is in 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:56.379
 huarte says reveals you the whole vision 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.939
 almost 20 red is not red but 

00:03:56.379 --> 00:03:59.319
 when people are going to do it or when the 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.579
 red moves now have all this 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.109
 part of everything reveals all this part 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:03.730
 if the top lane moves and you 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.469
 reveals a bit around here is here 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:07.419
 very pretty very well the same thing happens if 

00:04:05.469 --> 00:04:09.069
 you are in bot line and the genetic is 

00:04:07.419 --> 00:04:11.109
 up here for the just wait 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:12.400
 here is this pin huarte reveals all 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.780
 this area here all this area here and 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.910
 they are all here are 3 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.989
 three very important roads just like 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.079
 these are three other very paths 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:22.150
 important and good with that we finish 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:24.419
 the video seems to me that we have 

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:27.970
 finished we are going to 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.940
 go over it exactly that is all over the 

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:31.900
 Today's video I hope you liked it 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.910
 we will come back with more videos on how 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.960
 save and on how to play as the 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.610
 professionals or how they do 

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.800
 professionals and good I hope you have 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:42.870
 liked do not forget to subscribe and 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.870
 remember to always smile thank you
