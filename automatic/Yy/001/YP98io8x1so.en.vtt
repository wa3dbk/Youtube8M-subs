00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:41.960 

initially<00:02:40.650> had<00:02:40.770> talked<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.160> sticking<00:02:41.820> the

initially had talked about sticking the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
initially had talked about sticking the
jumps<00:02:42.360> if<00:02:42.510> she<00:02:42.690> really<00:02:43.080> did<00:02:43.260> at<00:02:43.410> that<00:02:43.440> point

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
jumps if she really did at that point

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.980 
jumps if she really did at that point
six<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.190> five<00:02:44.400> point<00:02:44.760> eight<00:02:44.880> as<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.600> can<00:02:45.780> see

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
six to five point eight as you can see

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:48.830 
six to five point eight as you can see
the<00:02:46.560> slight<00:02:47.250> deductions<00:02:47.940> there<00:02:48.150> were<00:02:48.300> related

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
the slight deductions there were related

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.450 
the slight deductions there were related
to<00:02:48.870> the<00:02:49.110> fact<00:02:49.140> that<00:02:49.440> on<00:02:49.650> that<00:02:49.770> triple<00:02:50.130> lutz<00:02:50.280> she

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
to the fact that on that triple lutz she

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.250 
to the fact that on that triple lutz she
lost<00:02:50.640> her<00:02:50.790> mouth<00:02:50.940> just<00:02:51.270> a<00:02:51.480> tad

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
lost her mouth just a tad

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.260 
lost her mouth just a tad
but<00:02:52.440> generally<00:02:53.040> speaking<00:02:53.070> that<00:02:53.580> was<00:02:53.730> a<00:02:53.760> spirit

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 
but generally speaking that was a spirit

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:56.120 
but generally speaking that was a spirit
hurt<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.600> marks<00:02:54.930> for<00:02:55.080> artistic<00:02:55.410> compression

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
hurt the marks for artistic compression

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:57.800 
hurt the marks for artistic compression
five<00:02:56.370> point<00:02:56.640> six<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.000> five<00:02:57.150> point<00:02:57.450> eight<00:02:57.540> again

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
five point six to five point eight again

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.720 
five point six to five point eight again
that<00:02:57.960> was<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> fairly<00:02:58.380> artistic<00:02:58.950> program

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
that was a fairly artistic program

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.520 
that was a fairly artistic program
fairly<00:03:00.150> intuitive<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.930> think<00:03:01.110> she<00:03:01.200> did<00:03:01.350> a<00:03:01.380> nice

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
fairly intuitive I think she did a nice

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.590 
fairly intuitive I think she did a nice
job
