00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:14.009
 there is a life preserver this visible 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.460
 of minecraft survival games on the back 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.470
 baseline and the map I never have 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.849
 played but I'm not so practical of 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.130
 this map in fact does not surprise us 

00:00:20.849 --> 00:00:24.630
 but also a process we do not go at random and 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.029
 however, we hope to put it into practice 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.699
 let's say some good results at least 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.800
 this part here that I don't know where to go 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.840
 here we say maybe already structured 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:39.239
 the other the 2 or 4 the one I do n't know is okay 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.940
 in any case, as it seems there is 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:44.250
 a basket I hope locals perfect too 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.440
 with good things that is if we take 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.539
 don't worry and let's go towards 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.820
 we hope that little spaceship there 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.129
 bring us something to today's tea pic 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.250
 heaven i would recommend a brize boy was 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.320
 precisely the browser 2817 that asks us and 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.510
 indispensable for the use of an area 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:06.960
 on mirrors our games and then 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:08.730
 let's say the textures from pvp and let's say 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.440
 as on the val yesterday on the texture point 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:15.390
 api ip are used by the players 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.160
 not everyone also because mine is not 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.630
 that many use in the mirror 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:22.590
 facts you have seen so many videos of 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 just the inps without rhesus r spec precisely 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.260
 I don't know depends on how to have it especially 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:30.600
 when i feel like personalizing some 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:32.280
 its tomine kraft hours we say the only one 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.080
 something that maybe essential to rai 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.330
 on mirrors more precisely in focus 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.830
 because also including what the transplant 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.840
 some other we want it tactical 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.940
 tactical flicks ok tactical doublets 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.640
 perfect speech worked and 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.170
 block I want for strength 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.440
 win this game on this map 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.450
 here you have not played perfect we say 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.980
 here is a perfect book this one 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.430
 he knew very well about the book 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.470
 so much my passing on teamspeak ok though 

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:03.690
 now enough is enough to say precisely 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:05.610
 to respect that from slut and see 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.000
 if you have the perfect fire I'm great 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.209
 ricchione a diciamole respect by pvp 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.340
 they are more than anything based on 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:17.400
 minecraft customization is but for 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.159
 As for me I could play 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.049
 fine with a default with a fire 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:25.829
 we say it with the low heat 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:30.569
 because while we say we have pvp have the 

00:02:25.829 --> 00:02:32.519
 fire when you get a fire 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:34.980
 high fire can be a nuisance 

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:38.540
 player trying to kill another 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.249
 summicron person and therefore we say that it is 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.049
 the use of an area is recommended 

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:48.420
 speck of cute people of a lexus 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:51.959
 he sins just while he gets himself done 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.060
 pvp for clay you can play very well 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.709
 even without the end is that of folk 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.329
 3 so much trouble though at a 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:01.650
 player can influence this thing 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:05.430
 here then this is what I say 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:09.239
 Descriptions I will recommend 5 textures 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:11.400
 very very simple packs are all 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:12.930
 published sources so that even people 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.700
 who were a good computer can 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.040
 hold up because the default and i am 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.629
 very very very beautiful and you have 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.700
 in short, I recommend some internships or 

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:22.409
 lowering then we do something not 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.999
 we risk going to sport we find 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:26.609
 what must happen to us even though 

00:03:23.999 --> 00:03:28.499
 the state had to happen to us 

00:03:26.609 --> 00:03:30.659
 behind that the team is not following him 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:32.069
 there is not even a look of intensity 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:33.599
 well 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.609
 I had to say to raise the helm face 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:38.549
 camper that you didn't see well all the 

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:40.079
 face and bones I hope this goes well 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.629
 and I can't look at the webcam because 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:43.019
 if i look if i look at the webcam i would be 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.790
 already dead 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:50.400
 then meanwhile the wells are coming 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:53.099
 come on and then let's do something 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.049
 very very fair and let's go on to 

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:58.099
 see if point year have taken all 

00:03:55.049 --> 00:04:00.150
 these parties to the a person behind 

00:03:58.099 --> 00:04:01.889
 so let's not waste time 

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.299
 directly from her but with five 

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:04.680
 people are missing two people per 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:07.260
 deathmatch I kill that person of 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.660
 fund is fortunate that I have another 

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.730
 person we're pretty much okay 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.540
 then let's do this bulletin here 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:20.730
 I miss the food so you play this 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:22.470
 dear circulation here and we are here alone 

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:26.760
 monaca super day type what's there for 

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:29.550
 me there is like a t2 basket I 'm sure 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.810
 of two that is if the efforts and the black ed 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.730
 a place means that c 2 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:44.640
 surely i have a team of di here 

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:48.090
 then fused them a finger style 

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:53.520

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:55.530
 shy 3 seriously oh well i know you serious 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:58.890
 that are missing 4 but with a person at the 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.230
 death matches are anxious why not 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:03.420
 I want to lose these games here because 

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:05.850
 I want to get to 100 wings to do then 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:09.090
 a kind of special kind of 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:15.810
 special in the sense then that in losers 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:20.970
 87 out of 7 789 sent to are more than one up 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:25.430

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:36.840
 then it is a team I was then iron or 

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:40.350
 we go now or we never have 

00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:44.340
 secondary let's get down to the ci 

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:46.500
 I believe I will save from a dead woman for one 

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:48.960
 death I died from the death of death 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.820
 on the couple on the love for the bike not 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:55.020
 it's true we ask hard we hold on 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:58.740
 we always go to the bottom of subjects 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:00.150
 that the rpm quickly he died 

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.860

 reproducing instead for a neighbor 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:11.870
 video in the head instead of everything 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:21.469
