with his right foot or you stop him and
you<00:01:24.850> make<00:01:25.000> him<00:01:25.180> stop<00:01:25.420> and<00:01:25.630> then<00:01:25.719> you<00:01:25.840> put<00:01:26.020> the

00:03:28.259 --> 00:03:28.269 
to Syria under 2.25 goals I mean I I

00:03:28.269 --> 00:03:30.340 
to Syria under 2.25 goals I mean I I
think<00:03:29.269> about<00:03:29.480> this<00:03:29.600> long<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.810> hard<00:03:29.989> but<00:03:30.290> I

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:30.350 
think about this long and hard but I

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.900 
think about this long and hard but I
just<00:03:30.530> think<00:03:30.620> that<00:03:30.799> Fulham<00:03:31.250> will<00:03:31.579> be<00:03:31.700> difficult

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
just think that Fulham will be difficult

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.640 
just think that Fulham will be difficult
to<00:03:32.209> play<00:03:32.390> against<00:03:32.660> they'll<00:03:32.810> be<00:03:32.900> difficult<00:03:33.560> to

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
to play against they'll be difficult to

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.530 
to play against they'll be difficult to
break<00:03:33.829> down<00:03:34.069> and<00:03:34.609> I<00:03:34.700> think<00:03:34.880> that<00:03:35.000> just<00:03:35.390> about

00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:35.540 
break down and I think that just about

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.420 
break down and I think that just about
be<00:03:35.840> enough<00:03:36.019> to<00:03:36.140> stop<00:03:36.200> wolves<00:03:36.799> going<00:03:37.100> forward

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:37.430 
be enough to stop wolves going forward

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.780 
be enough to stop wolves going forward
to<00:03:37.760> going<00:03:38.000> for<00:03:38.239> under<00:03:38.480> 2.25<00:03:39.260> goes<00:03:39.530> at<00:03:39.769> 17<00:03:40.250> to<00:03:40.400> 20

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:40.790 
to going for under 2.25 goes at 17 to 20

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:43.270 
to going for under 2.25 goes at 17 to 20
