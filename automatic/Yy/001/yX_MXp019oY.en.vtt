00:00:03.273 --> 00:00:05.040
 A real monster, do not you? 

00:00:05.266 --> 00:00:08.706
 It's worth adding that when we use two cards, 

00:00:09.006 --> 00:00:14.333
 we can of course decide which one will be preferred when calling, 

00:00:14.333 --> 00:00:17.340
 sending text messages or sending data. 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.066
 Of course, both cards are visible in standby mode. 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:23.653
 And now it's time for some practical advice. 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.526
 In a box outside the phone, the Pentagram Monster P 430-1 and the charger 

00:00:29.526 --> 00:00:31.680
 we will also find a headset - 

00:00:31.986 --> 00:00:36.666
 - asks you to use it, for example listening to music while walking. 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.640
 We can also use FM Radio or Music. 

00:00:42.333 --> 00:00:45.793
 In the latter case, a microSD card slot will be useful, 

00:00:45.793 --> 00:00:48.273
 where to save your favorite songs. 

00:00:48.926 --> 00:00:52.760
 Those of you who often travel by car to unknown places 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.160
 the Navigation application will be useful. 

00:00:55.253 --> 00:00:57.013
 It's a classic android program, 

00:00:57.013 --> 00:01:00.800
 which can also be replaced by the less-popular Navigator. 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:05.406
 In both cases the comfort of the driving car will be increased by the Gecko pad, 

00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:09.740
 which effectively holds the device in place - without getting dirty, 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.846
 gluing or limiting the field of view of elements. 

00:01:13.893 --> 00:01:19.613
 For travelers to other countries - and not only - the Translator application will give great services. 

00:01:19.806 --> 00:01:22.953
 It is enough to connect to the network so that it can be translated 

00:01:22.953 --> 00:01:25.386
 a few basic phrases in a dozen or so, 

00:01:25.386 --> 00:01:27.840
 like not a few dozen language combinations. 

00:01:28.306 --> 00:01:33.553
 Film and photography enthusiasts, equipping Monster with a MicroSD card, 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.520
 they will be able to enjoy good quality movies and photos. 

00:01:37.946 --> 00:01:42.900
 No problem can also be shared in social networks or by e-mail. 

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:48.933
 Pentagram Monster is a unique example of the practical approach of the manufacturer to the device. 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:52.140
 The creators focused on simplicity and efficiency. 

00:01:52.306 --> 00:01:57.353
 We do not have here grazing, cool extras or ultramodern design. 

00:01:57.453 --> 00:02:00.666
 There is a roomy battery, good quality screen, 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.720
 support for two cards and a solid housing. 

00:02:04.146 --> 00:02:09.406
 The icing on the cake is a very good camera with eight megapixels. 

00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:13.766
 So I will go with this monster for a long sightseeing tour, 

00:02:13.953 --> 00:02:16.773
 and choose to visit our website. 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.053
 Watch movies, read and be mobile and style.
