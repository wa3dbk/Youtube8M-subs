basically<00:01:23.430> allows<00:01:23.700> me<00:01:23.939> to<00:01:24.030> be<00:01:24.150> edgy<00:01:24.330> or<00:01:24.659> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
basically allows me to be edgy or it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.230 
basically allows me to be edgy or it
allows<00:01:24.900> me<00:01:25.140> to<00:01:25.229> take<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.439> risk<00:01:25.830> it<00:01:26.220> allows<00:01:26.700> me<00:01:26.729> to

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
allows me to take a risk it allows me to

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.770 
allows me to take a risk it allows me to
test<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.990> waters<00:01:28.500> by<00:01:29.070> saying<00:01:29.790> what<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.119> really

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
test the waters by saying what I really

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.859 
test the waters by saying what I really
want<00:01:31.110> even<00:01:31.890> if<00:01:32.009> it's<00:01:32.159> out<00:01:32.310> of<00:01:32.340> the<00:01:32.549> box<00:01:32.790> and<00:01:33.060> and

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
want even if it's out of the box and and

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.370 
want even if it's out of the box and and
it<00:01:34.290> also<00:01:34.799> suggests<00:01:35.610> that<00:01:36.390> I<00:01:36.600> might<00:01:37.110> get<00:01:37.259> away

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
it also suggests that I might get away

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.260 
it also suggests that I might get away
with<00:01:37.740> it<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.189> might<00:01:38.369> actually<00:01:38.610> say<00:01:38.970> that's<00:01:39.210> a

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
with it you might actually say that's a

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.200 
with it you might actually say that's a
good<00:01:39.299> idea<00:01:39.570> I<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.500> that<00:01:40.939> yeah<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.090> I<00:01:42.150> think

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
good idea I like that yeah and I think

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
good idea I like that yeah and I think
another<00:01:42.540> reason<00:01:42.810> is<00:01:43.140> we're<00:01:43.380> not<00:01:43.409> taking

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
another reason is we're not taking

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.490 
another reason is we're not taking
things<00:01:44.340> quite<00:01:44.670> so<00:01:44.909> personally<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.600> mean<00:01:45.840> life

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
things quite so personally I mean life

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.149 
things quite so personally I mean life

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
venus and airy aquarius give us just the

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.209 
venus and airy aquarius give us just the
dash<00:01:53.759> of<00:01:54.060> detachment<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:55.350> allows<00:01:55.740> us<00:01:56.009> to

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
dash of detachment which allows us to

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.969 
dash of detachment which allows us to
move<00:01:56.369> beyond<00:01:56.820> some<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.270> our<00:01:57.540> most<00:01:57.979> insecure

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
move beyond some of our most insecure

move beyond some of our most insecure
hangups<00:01:59.700> yeah<00:02:00.360> i<00:02:00.390> think<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.140> lose<00:02:01.469> that

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829

for a couple of hours we may forget
about<00:02:15.629> all<00:02:15.959> this<00:02:16.230> kind<00:02:16.530> of<00:02:16.590> edgy<00:02:17.219> exciting

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:17.939 
about all this kind of edgy exciting

really<00:02:20.670> kind<00:02:20.879> of<00:02:20.969> get<00:02:21.150> into<00:02:21.389> it<00:02:21.749> because<00:02:22.170> we

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
really kind of get into it because we

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.410 
really kind of get into it because we
have<00:02:22.769> we<00:02:23.189> have<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.340> feeling<00:02:23.760> that<00:02:23.790> we<00:02:23.999> need<00:02:24.239> to

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
have we have a feeling that we need to

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.970 
have we have a feeling that we need to
express<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.139> it<00:02:25.319> may<00:02:25.469> not<00:02:25.620> be<00:02:25.680> the<00:02:25.859> easiest

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
express and it may not be the easiest

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.489 
express and it may not be the easiest
thing<00:02:26.519> to<00:02:26.849> get<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.329> but<00:02:27.540> we<00:02:27.689> have<00:02:27.840> to<00:02:28.049> do<00:02:28.170> it<00:02:28.319> and

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:28.499 
thing to get to but we have to do it and

00:02:28.499 --> 00:02:30.949 
thing to get to but we have to do it and
with<00:02:28.980> Mars<00:02:29.280> sometimes<00:02:29.969> we<00:02:30.150> have<00:02:30.359> to<00:02:30.420> fight<00:02:30.810> and

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
with Mars sometimes we have to fight and

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.599 
with Mars sometimes we have to fight and
I<00:02:30.989> think<00:02:31.200> it's<00:02:31.319> fine<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.590> fight<00:02:31.980> if<00:02:32.189> we<00:02:32.340> fight

00:02:32.599 --> 00:02:32.609 
I think it's fine to fight if we fight

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:36.470 
I think it's fine to fight if we fight
fairly<00:02:33.530> I'm<00:02:34.530> Jeff<00:02:34.859> cower<00:02:35.159> in<00:02:35.430> for<00:02:36.060> planet
