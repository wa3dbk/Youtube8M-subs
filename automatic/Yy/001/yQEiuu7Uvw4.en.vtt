00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
hand but the after-effects of using it

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.910 
hand but the after-effects of using it
for<00:00:38.969> a<00:00:39.000> while<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.239> have<00:00:39.629> slime<00:00:40.350> enus<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
for a while you have slime enus the

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
glass gets super super slimy on the back

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.380 
glass gets super super slimy on the back
and<00:00:43.649> if<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.010> first<00:00:44.370> version<00:00:44.820> that<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:44.969> had<00:00:45.210> was

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and if the first version that I had was

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.790 
and if the first version that I had was
the<00:00:45.420> black<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.050> took<00:00:46.260> it<00:00:46.350> back<00:00:46.500> and<00:00:46.680> got

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
the black and I took it back and got

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.740 
the black and I took it back and got
white<00:00:47.010> just<00:00:47.430> so<00:00:47.520> you<00:00:47.640> wouldn't<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:48.120> those<00:00:48.360> but

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
white just so you wouldn't see those but

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.160 
white just so you wouldn't see those but
it<00:00:48.870> still<00:00:49.170> felt<00:00:49.559> slimy<00:00:50.250> so<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.969> fix<00:00:51.840> to<00:00:52.020> that

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it still felt slimy so my fix to that

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
it still felt slimy so my fix to that
was<00:00:52.379> going<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.770> D<00:00:52.980> brand<00:00:53.250> skin<00:00:53.699> they<00:00:54.120> have

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
was going with a D brand skin they have

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:55.850 
was going with a D brand skin they have
a<00:00:54.300> bunch<00:00:54.510> of<00:00:54.629> different<00:00:54.780> skins<00:00:55.410> and<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.739> have<00:00:55.829> a

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
a bunch of different skins and I have a

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:56.990 
a bunch of different skins and I have a
few<00:00:56.070> different<00:00:56.340> ones<00:00:56.370> this<00:00:56.579> is<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> black

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
few different ones this is the black

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000 
few different ones this is the black
carbon<00:00:57.300> fiber<00:00:57.690> the<00:00:58.230> reason<00:00:58.530> I<00:00:58.590> went<00:00:58.770> with<00:00:58.890> this

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
carbon fiber the reason I went with this

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:00.889 
carbon fiber the reason I went with this
is<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.340> because<00:00:59.699> so<00:00:59.940> that<00:00:59.969> way<00:01:00.210> if<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.600> don't

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
is just because so that way if I don't

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.599 
is just because so that way if I don't
want<00:01:01.109> to<00:01:01.170> have<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.320> case<00:01:01.590> on<00:01:01.800> it<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> can

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
want to have a case on it that I can

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
want to have a case on it that I can
actually<00:01:02.850> not<00:01:03.449> feel<00:01:03.960> that<00:01:04.229> slime<00:01:04.710> Enis<00:01:05.070> oh<00:01:05.189> you

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.730 
big deal for me we'll talk more about
the<00:01:18.330> camera<00:01:18.689> later<00:01:18.869> out<00:01:19.049> of<00:01:19.170> the<00:01:19.259> video

fingerprint<00:01:20.250> scanner<00:01:20.520> is<00:01:20.759> much<00:01:21.060> improved<00:01:21.390> but

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fingerprint scanner is much improved but

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.810 
fingerprint scanner is much improved but
yet<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.590> still<00:01:22.710> something<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.280> don't<00:01:23.549> use<00:01:23.790> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
yet it's still something I don't use so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.149

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
a down facing speaker that sounds pretty

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:29.899 
a down facing speaker that sounds pretty
good<00:01:28.500> but<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.040> if<00:01:29.159> you<00:01:29.280> go<00:01:29.430> full<00:01:29.729> blast

specs down below I'm not really gonna
get<00:01:58.020> into<00:01:58.170> them<00:01:58.409> because<00:01:58.560> it's<00:01:58.710> nothing<00:01:58.950> that

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100

another<00:03:00.520> thing<00:03:00.760> with<00:03:00.880> the<00:03:00.910> software<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.990> this

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
another thing with the software and this

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.590 
another thing with the software and this
could<00:03:02.800> be<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.950> hardware<00:03:03.400> thing<00:03:03.760> or<00:03:04.060> a<00:03:04.090> software

could be a hardware thing or a software
thing<00:03:04.959> but<00:03:05.200> I'm<00:03:05.290> gonna<00:03:05.410> say<00:03:05.650> it's<00:03:05.800> software

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
thing but I'm gonna say it's software

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610 
thing but I'm gonna say it's software

that I bought day one was a 32 gig black
now<00:03:11.170> I<00:03:11.200> explained<00:03:11.620> why<00:03:11.740> I<00:03:11.800> got<00:03:11.980> rid<00:03:12.010> of<00:03:12.160> the

black in the hardware portion of this

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:16.020 
black in the hardware portion of this
video<00:03:14.350> but<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.800> other<00:03:14.980> reason<00:03:15.370> I<00:03:15.459> exchanged

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:16.030 
video but the other reason I exchanged

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:18.210 
video but the other reason I exchanged
it<00:03:16.180> when<00:03:16.540> I<00:03:16.570> got<00:03:16.750> the<00:03:16.900> white<00:03:17.140> is<00:03:17.320> I<00:03:17.440> got<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> 64

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:35.140 
we'll say software for now because we're

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:36.780 
we'll say software for now because we're
in<00:03:35.380> this<00:03:35.650> portion<00:03:36.070> of<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.250> video<00:03:36.340> is<00:03:36.730> the
