00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
like the shapes and they led places you

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:07.660 
like the shapes and they led places you
can't<00:05:06.200> actually<00:05:06.380> see<00:05:06.650> the<00:05:06.740> picture<00:05:07.100> which<00:05:07.580> I

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:07.670 
can't actually see the picture which I

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:10.210 
can't actually see the picture which I
don't<00:05:07.730> like<00:05:08.000> so<00:05:08.240> we're<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.290> ISM<00:05:09.770> where<00:05:10.100> you

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
don't like so we're like ISM where you

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.480 
don't like so we're like ISM where you
right<00:05:10.520> click<00:05:10.640> on<00:05:10.790> it<00:05:10.850> at<00:05:11.540> extract<00:05:12.440> and<00:05:12.800> pretty

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
right click on it at extract and pretty

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:15.160 
right click on it at extract and pretty
much<00:05:13.520> it<00:05:14.000> will<00:05:14.120> make<00:05:14.300> it<00:05:14.420> into<00:05:14.510> a<00:05:14.600> folder<00:05:14.840> I

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.170 
much it will make it into a folder I

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:18.340 
much it will make it into a folder I
just<00:05:15.530> wait<00:05:15.680> for<00:05:15.710> it<00:05:15.920> to<00:05:15.950> load<00:05:16.130> process<00:05:17.350> already

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
just wait for it to load process already

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:20.650 
just wait for it to load process already
yeah<00:05:18.680> so<00:05:18.860> now<00:05:19.130> you<00:05:19.550> get<00:05:19.730> a<00:05:19.790> folder<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.450> now<00:05:20.600> you

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:20.660 
yeah so now you get a folder and now you

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:24.790 
yeah so now you get a folder and now you
can<00:05:20.870> literally<00:05:21.290> start<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.280> you<00:05:23.000> know<00:05:23.800> putting

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:24.800 
can literally start and you know putting

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.190 
can literally start and you know putting
like<00:05:25.190> copying<00:05:25.640> stuff<00:05:25.820> from<00:05:26.420> another<00:05:26.930> tish

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
like copying stuff from another tish

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.830 
like copying stuff from another tish
pack<00:05:27.530> and<00:05:27.740> stuff<00:05:27.890> so<00:05:28.700> yeah<00:05:29.300> I<00:05:29.330> guess<00:05:29.540> that's

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:29.840 
pack and stuff so yeah I guess that's

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:31.720 
pack and stuff so yeah I guess that's
all<00:05:29.960> I<00:05:30.020> add<00:05:30.230> you<00:05:30.740> know<00:05:30.830> you<00:05:31.250> can<00:05:31.400> make<00:05:31.460> your<00:05:31.580> own

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:31.730 
all I add you know you can make your own

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:33.940 
all I add you know you can make your own
taste<00:05:31.970> pack<00:05:32.270> looks<00:05:32.510> good<00:05:32.840> look<00:05:33.230> good<00:05:33.410> with

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
taste pack looks good look good with
