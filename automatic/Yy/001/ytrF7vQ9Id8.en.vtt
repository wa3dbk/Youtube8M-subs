it's<00:00:53.800> you<00:00:54.010> know<00:00:55.590> probably<00:00:56.590> somewhere<00:00:56.949> around

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
it's you know probably somewhere around

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.310 
it's you know probably somewhere around
in<00:00:57.280> this<00:00:57.489> tempo<00:00:57.910> and<00:00:58.329> he<00:00:58.870> does<00:00:59.019> a<00:00:59.050> lot<00:00:59.140> of

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
in this tempo and he does a lot of

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.619 
in this tempo and he does a lot of
double-time<00:00:59.980> things<00:01:00.309> in<00:01:00.579> that<00:01:01.120> so<00:01:01.390> in

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:01.629 
double-time things in that so in

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:03.990 
double-time things in that so in
particular<00:01:01.839> this<00:01:02.410> double-time<00:01:03.010> thing<00:01:03.309> stuck

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
particular this double-time thing stuck

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.970 
particular this double-time thing stuck
out<00:01:04.770> it<00:01:05.770> goes<00:01:05.980> like<00:01:06.220> this<00:01:06.250> one<00:01:06.730> A<00:01:07.090> two<00:01:07.720> A<00:01:08.350> one

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:08.980 
out it goes like this one A two A one

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:18.660 
out it goes like this one A two A one
two<00:01:09.580> three<00:01:10.510> four<00:01:15.810> more<00:01:16.810> time<00:01:17.080> one<00:01:17.440> two<00:01:17.800> three

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:18.670 
two three four more time one two three

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:27.750 
two three four more time one two three
four<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:25.450> it's<00:01:26.290> a<00:01:26.320> double-time<00:01:26.800> phrase<00:01:27.160> as<00:01:27.370> you

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
four so it's a double-time phrase as you

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.970 
four so it's a double-time phrase as you
can<00:01:27.940> hear<00:01:28.240> and<00:01:28.440> he<00:01:29.440> does<00:01:29.590> this<00:01:29.710> cool<00:01:29.950> thing

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:29.980 
can hear and he does this cool thing

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:32.040 
can hear and he does this cool thing
which<00:01:30.850> is<00:01:31.000> that<00:01:31.120> he<00:01:31.210> basically<00:01:31.360> just<00:01:31.630> divides

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
which is that he basically just divides

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.800 
which is that he basically just divides
his<00:01:32.200> hands<00:01:32.620> so<00:01:33.310> that<00:01:33.340> his<00:01:33.550> left<00:01:33.820> hand<00:01:34.150> does<00:01:34.660> all

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:34.810 
his hands so that his left hand does all

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.960 
his hands so that his left hand does all
the<00:01:34.930> sweeping<00:01:36.360> his<00:01:37.360> right<00:01:37.600> hand<00:01:38.700> does<00:01:39.700> all<00:01:39.850> the

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
the sweeping his right hand does all the

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.270 
the sweeping his right hand does all the
tapping<00:01:40.440> for<00:01:41.440> those<00:01:41.560> of<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.740> that<00:01:41.950> are<00:01:42.070> on<00:01:42.250> my

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
tapping for those of you that are on my

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.010 
tapping for those of you that are on my
site<00:01:42.700> you<00:01:42.850> guys<00:01:42.970> know<00:01:43.630> some<00:01:43.840> of<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:43.990> things

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
site you guys know some of the things

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.570 
site you guys know some of the things
we've<00:01:44.290> talked<00:01:44.500> about<00:01:44.590> in<00:01:44.800> terms<00:01:44.950> of<00:01:45.100> sweeping

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
we've talked about in terms of sweeping

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.150 
we've talked about in terms of sweeping
and<00:01:45.820> tapping<00:01:46.270> and<00:01:46.480> how<00:01:46.960> to<00:01:47.020> mix<00:01:47.290> those<00:01:47.560> two<00:01:47.860> and

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
and tapping and how to mix those two and

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
and tapping and how to mix those two and
to<00:01:48.490> me<00:01:48.610> this<00:01:48.730> is<00:01:48.790> a<00:01:48.880> great<00:01:49.210> example<00:01:49.600> of<00:01:49.870> that<00:01:49.930> so

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
to me this is a great example of that so

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.520 
to me this is a great example of that so
if<00:01:52.180> we<00:01:52.390> go<00:01:52.510> back<00:01:52.540> and<00:01:52.900> play<00:01:53.050> it<00:01:53.170> play<00:01:53.350> the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
if we go back and play it play the

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.500 
if we go back and play it play the
phrase<00:01:53.740> again<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.400> left<00:01:54.730> handle<00:01:55.090> sweep<00:01:55.330> our

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
phrase again on left handle sweep our

00:01:55.510 --> 00:02:03.530 
phrase again on left handle sweep our
right<00:01:55.870> handle<00:01:56.260> tap<00:01:56.500> so<00:01:57.100> it<00:01:57.190> goes

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:12.090 

so<00:02:04.540> it<00:02:04.690> ends<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:10.750> last<00:02:11.020> little<00:02:11.260> part<00:02:11.470> is<00:02:11.680> left

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:12.100 
so it ends the last little part is left

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.300 
so it ends the last little part is left
right<00:02:12.730> left<00:02:12.790> right<00:02:13.510> left<00:02:13.660> so<00:02:14.650> he's<00:02:14.770> got<00:02:14.920> to<00:02:15.010> end

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
right left right left so he's got to end

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.750 
right left right left so he's got to end
