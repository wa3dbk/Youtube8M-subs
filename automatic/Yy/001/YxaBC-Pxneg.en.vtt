00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
can't get over to the other side so you

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.740 
can't get over to the other side so you
got<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.799> park<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.729> helicopter<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.570> the

driver side two apart like so and it's a

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.030 
driver side two apart like so and it's a
bit<00:01:57.479> frustrating<00:01:58.020> but<00:01:58.170> once<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:58.920> you

bit frustrating but once you get it you

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.800 
bit frustrating but once you get it you
got<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.460> if<00:01:59.729> you<00:01:59.850> can't<00:02:00.060> drive<00:02:00.180> a<00:02:00.240> helicopter

get that the next part is going to be at
the<00:02:25.750> very<00:02:26.020> end<00:02:26.319> of<00:02:26.920> this<00:02:27.069> body<00:02:27.310> of<00:02:27.520> water<00:02:27.760> that

the very end of this body of water that

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.830 
the very end of this body of water that
we're<00:02:28.209> in<00:02:28.300> right<00:02:28.330> now<00:02:28.510> and<00:02:29.340> it's<00:02:30.360> it's<00:02:31.360> easy<00:02:31.600> to

so with that being said here's where we
got<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.120> last<00:02:40.510> part<00:02:40.810> wrap<00:02:41.019> and<00:02:41.350> then<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
got that last part wrap and then the

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:42.960 
got that last part wrap and then the
next<00:02:41.920> part<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.310> at<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.519> very<00:02:42.640> end<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.940> the

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
next part is at the very end of the

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.330 
next part is at the very end of the
stream<00:02:43.480> or<00:02:43.780> this<00:02:43.959> little<00:02:44.170> like<00:02:44.500> a<00:02:44.530> line<00:02:45.040> and

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
stream or this little like a line and

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.550 
stream or this little like a line and
there's<00:02:46.030> these<00:02:46.120> four<00:02:46.390> tubes<00:02:46.660> coming<00:02:46.989> down<00:02:47.290> now

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:47.560 
there's these four tubes coming down now

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.410 
there's these four tubes coming down now
the<00:02:48.280> part<00:02:48.519> you<00:02:48.580> cannot<00:02:48.910> see<00:02:49.090> it<00:02:49.150> because<00:02:49.209> it's

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
the part you cannot see it because it's

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.640 
the part you cannot see it because it's
underwater<00:02:49.720> and<00:02:49.959> you<00:02:50.019> can't<00:02:50.200> go<00:02:50.319> underwater

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
underwater and you can't go underwater

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:52.590 
underwater and you can't go underwater
to<00:02:50.890> see<00:02:51.069> it<00:02:51.160> but<00:02:51.370> it's<00:02:51.430> inside<00:02:52.030> that<00:02:52.269> first

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
to see it but it's inside that first

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.050 
to see it but it's inside that first
tube<00:02:53.100> you<00:02:54.100> run<00:02:54.310> up<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.580> it<00:02:54.640> and<00:02:54.700> should<00:02:54.910> be<00:02:55.000> able

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
tube you run up to it and should be able

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:56.460 
tube you run up to it and should be able
to<00:02:55.180> grab<00:02:55.360> it<00:02:55.390> should<00:02:55.810> be<00:02:55.900> no<00:02:56.019> problems<00:02:56.410> there

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
to grab it should be no problems there

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.380 
to grab it should be no problems there
at<00:02:56.680> all<00:02:56.769> then<00:02:57.549> you<00:02:57.610> turn<00:02:57.790> around<00:02:57.910> you<00:02:58.180> look

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:58.390 
at all then you turn around you look

back or I did just show you that there
is<00:03:00.430> the<00:03:00.730> four<00:03:00.940> tubes<00:03:01.209> and<00:03:01.660> it's<00:03:02.260> that<00:03:02.440> easy<00:03:03.030> now

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
is the four tubes and it's that easy now

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:11.490 
is the four tubes and it's that easy now
ah<00:03:05.310> the<00:03:07.410> next<00:03:08.410> part<00:03:08.560> here<00:03:08.920> I<00:03:09.450> believe<00:03:10.470> was<00:03:11.470> a

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:11.500 
ah the next part here I believe was a

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:14.580 
ah the next part here I believe was a
little<00:03:11.860> bit<00:03:11.980> more<00:03:12.660> no<00:03:13.660> it's<00:03:13.840> not<00:03:13.930> next<00:03:14.230> part<00:03:14.500> is

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
little bit more no it's not next part is

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.789 
little bit more no it's not next part is
not<00:03:15.160> challenging<00:03:15.880> the<00:03:16.060> next<00:03:17.019> one<00:03:17.170> is<00:03:17.320> on<00:03:17.350> that

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
not challenging the next one is on that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.009 
not challenging the next one is on that
outer<00:03:18.670> body<00:03:19.000> of<00:03:19.180> water<00:03:19.299> see<00:03:19.540> here<00:03:19.720> where<00:03:19.930> you

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
outer body of water see here where you

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.449 
outer body of water see here where you
got<00:03:20.170> those<00:03:20.290> last<00:03:20.530> two<00:03:20.680> pieces<00:03:20.859> here<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:21.400> if

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:21.459 
got those last two pieces here and if

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:23.009 
got those last two pieces here and if
you<00:03:21.549> just<00:03:21.790> do<00:03:21.880> a<00:03:21.910> hop<00:03:22.209> and<00:03:22.359> a<00:03:22.450> skip<00:03:22.480> over<00:03:22.840> the

00:03:23.009 --> 00:03:23.019 
you just do a hop and a skip over the

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:24.539 
you just do a hop and a skip over the
mountain<00:03:23.290> there<00:03:23.410> which<00:03:23.650> you<00:03:23.769> can't<00:03:24.040> but<00:03:24.340> to

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:24.549 
mountain there which you can't but to

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:27.180 
mountain there which you can't but to
pretend<00:03:25.450> or<00:03:26.109> get<00:03:26.320> a<00:03:26.350> helicopter<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.950> fly

pretend or get a helicopter and fly

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:28.979 
pretend or get a helicopter and fly
that'd<00:03:27.640> be<00:03:27.670> common<00:03:28.359> sense<00:03:28.570> thing<00:03:28.750> to<00:03:28.840> do
