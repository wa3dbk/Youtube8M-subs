 I'm zelanda if you do not have a video 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.750

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.599
 many of you is a list of the 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:12.330
 best mods for my multiplayer of 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.130
 hadley 2 of your free graphic engine 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.320

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.359
 how to install these mods will be under the 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.850
 description a some annotation by the 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:23.550
 screen and I'll leave you videos of those 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.380
 games or some of them in action for 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.090
 that you can see before you get 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.150
 download and see if they really are or not 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.640
 your game started we started 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.260
 with partners vikings and nights this 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.510
 game in which you embody as well says 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.030
 the title a pirate a viking or a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.510
 medieval knight for the custody of 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.610
 holy grail the treasure of the kingdom or 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.789
 just kill yourself for pleasure or for 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.670
 territory each team has several 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:52.530
 classes either the archer the captain of the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:55.500
 pirate ship the knight in the armor 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.030
 heavy yet viking berserker or even 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.699
 a spearman all have attacks 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.640
 specials and I assure you it is a game 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:05.250
 very crazy very entertaining and that is going to 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.070
 love continue with gnomes room in 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.750
 hell 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.640
 a game that is based on thematic 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.140
 apocalyptic zombie but contrary to 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.450
 all the typical games the objective 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.220
 here is not killing zombies but avoiding them 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.320
 we have to get to the point where 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:18.640
 we can escape with our team and 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.800
 we must be very careful as 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.780
 we only have one life we â€‹â€‹have very little 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:25.660
 ammunition very few weapons and I assure you 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:28.030
 that a single zombie can be a great 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.400
 threat these zombies are only killed of 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.650
 a shot in the head and it does not matter 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:35.140
 shrapnel jce the whole body weapons 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:37.450
 they have their own ammunition each for 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.100
 what you have to be very careful about the 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.899
 time to catch the ammunition there are also 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.910
 have to be very careful with the weight and 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:45.550
 that we can not carry the entire arsenal 

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:47.410
 that we would love is very realistic until 

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.240
 the point that they can grab us and 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:51.580
 we have to push them or try 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:53.410
 kill them before they kill us because 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.509
 those sure friends that are not going to 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.759
 to let go you do not like realism so much 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:59.500
 you prefer something more active closer to 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:02.500
 Well, you have the panic zombie with the same 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.509
 thematic are zombies against humans in 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.009
 this case the same weapons there are several 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.750
 types there are several ammunitions there are 

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:09.399
 keep in mind to share a team already 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.560
 that the weight will make us run much more 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.540
 slow and the zombies can catch us 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.489
 what is the advantage of this good game 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.560
 you can survive as much as you can and 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.390
 in case you die quietly that the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.520
 game has not finished incarnates you in 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:24.040
 zombie changes elevating you and ends with 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.989
 a few survivors before 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.250
 they do it with you it 's a game in the 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.980
 that you can not stand still because the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.140
 ammunition is running out and you need 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.660
 Go outside to find more for you 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.120
 as for your companions you are prepared 

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.280
 to face the zombie apocalypse the 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.530
 negative case you can always kill 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.510
 own people as if they were the 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.209
 protagonist a series movie b in 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.890
 action highlight 2 can you be that 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:49.870
 protagonist you have several types of 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:52.600
 weapons with animations pretty good 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.940
 made the truth and a terrible frenzy 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:57.489
 you can do jumps to the matrix you can 

00:02:54.940 --> 00:03:01.239
 bleed on the same floor based on 

00:02:57.489 --> 00:03:04.120
 shots and you can make gangs of mafias from 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:06.250
 thieves of a lot of typical things of 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.709
 those movies that we like so much to see 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.380
 a weekend we spent a game 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:14.470
 totally different from turning south in the 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.720
 that you embody an invisible specimen 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.860
 human eye equipped alone with a knife 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.230
 and a couple of gr 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.090
 improvised the other team is a group 

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:24.610
 of commands that the only thing you can do 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:27.310
 is to kill him with bullets before they are 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:29.440
 Approach 7 to 1 sounds easy truth 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:31.210
 but tell me when you have the 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.160
 knife in your throat you go exploded 

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:35.350
 in a thousand pieces we ended up with a game 

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.150
 that does not require a lot of age 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.010
 of if it would be worth I suppose that many 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.130
 characters the medieval chivalry warfare 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.050
 and this game is exactly the same but 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:46.720
