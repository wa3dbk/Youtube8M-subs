I'm<00:00:22.890> less<00:00:23.070> happy<00:00:23.400> about<00:00:25.369> minestrone<00:00:26.539> which<00:00:27.539> I

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
I'm less happy about minestrone which I

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.529 
I'm less happy about minestrone which I
think<00:00:27.810> should<00:00:27.869> be<00:00:28.199> okay<00:00:28.939> baked<00:00:29.939> beans<00:00:29.970> is

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
think should be okay baked beans is

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.830 
think should be okay baked beans is
pretty<00:00:30.869> much<00:00:30.990> standard<00:00:32.360> chicken<00:00:33.360> soup<00:00:33.630> that's

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
pretty much standard chicken soup that's

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.580 
pretty much standard chicken soup that's
probably<00:00:34.290> my<00:00:34.790> my<00:00:35.790> worst<00:00:36.000> one<00:00:36.329> today<00:00:36.750> and<00:00:37.200> no

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
probably my my worst one today and no

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.709 
probably my my worst one today and no
one<00:00:37.620> wants<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:38.100> pour<00:00:38.340> meet<00:00:38.610> on<00:00:38.879> themselves<00:00:39.360> I

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
one wants to pour meet on themselves I

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:41.869 
one wants to pour meet on themselves I
think<00:00:40.440> that's<00:00:41.340> probably<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:41.730> most

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
think that's probably the most

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.240 
think that's probably the most
disappointing<00:00:42.329> part<00:00:42.570> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:42.989> day<00:00:43.200> we've<00:00:44.040> also
