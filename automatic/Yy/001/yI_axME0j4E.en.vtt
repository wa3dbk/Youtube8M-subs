00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.920
 this time we are going to explain the 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.279
 combat against running 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.349
 against running on your normal difficulty 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.029
 the skills that we are going to 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:23.220
 have to face one of them going to 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.739
 be the barrier to this barrier 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:29.250
 what it will do is have the boss place it 

00:00:25.739 --> 00:00:31.919
 will absorb 100% magic damage and only 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:34.020
 we will have to go down we only have 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:35.730
 to go down first because the casters 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.680
 they are not going to do you absolutely nothing 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:40.260
 damage and then because every 10 seconds that 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.590
 pass with that barrier placed will win 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.780
 6% damage 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:50.330
 once the barrier is over all 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.309
 world - someone some people who 

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.870
 will be assigned in this case I have not 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:55.790
 been assigned me so you can not 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.070
 see is going to put as you are seeing in 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:01.100
 screen is going to start recharging the 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.930
 who is assigned should be left alone 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.479
 the in the middle the evils of having to 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.430
 separate and at that time will begin to 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.020
 load the boss barrier and the 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.640
 player who is inside with him will have to 

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:12.220
 cure him very much because life is going to 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.260
 download a lot 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:16.300
 and will win the barrier while it is 

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:19.330
 loading the boss will also appear 

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:22.270
 anomalies that will have to be killed only 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:23.770
 when it is on top of some areas of a 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.960
 bag that you are seeing right now 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:28.510
 also on screen that are called fields 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.190
 cancellation this cancellation field puts it 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.840
 the boss card a person will go 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:36.460
 towards him they hit march that on the ground 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.480
 and will put those areas you have to kill them 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.490
 inside because those areas 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.320
 they silence players who have 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.630
 stayed inside as to the same anomaly 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.729
 the anomaly when they are killed exploits 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.220
 but they are within that area as 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:50.920
 they are silenced and does not end up exploding 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.530
 then the boss is doing a kind 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.070
 doing several little things depending on 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.500
 the magic that you use 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.600
 skill that will eject magic when 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.710
 make cast fire magic as you are 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.950
 watching right now on screen 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.560
 we will receive a series of fire tics and 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.920
 when it dissipates after 10 seconds 

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.670
 we will do damage of 50-60 houses around 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.420
 our 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:18.400
 apart from this you can now also do 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.800
 an eject arcane magic will put it 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.489
 a player will put a tank and this 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:28.150
 tank will receive a 10 for a 100% more than 

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:31.209
 damage when this happens what you have to 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.520
 make the tank is running will leave a 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:35.230
 little road which is going to explode if 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.390
 I saw him there in the back in a skull 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.950
 the opposite of the tank is exploding and 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:40.780
 obviously the other tank will have to 

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.099
 take away the boss because he can not 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:45.370
 to stall what to follow for part 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:46.900
 receives 100% more damage and because 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.670
 he has to go then by dodging people 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.620
 It is therefore recommended that the tank be the 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.060
 that I removed the people I did not start to move 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.060
 if you see the tank as it comes towards 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.380
 you with him with the puddle with the river 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.790
 this one that leaves behind him because 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.190
 it was moving to the best the law must be 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.870
 so that the one that marks the way and 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:05.319
 you sit on the site to 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:07.630
 hurts five yards of what's coming 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:10.630
 being the east trail that leaves in the 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:13.120
 floor then you can also do it 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:15.280
 frost damage that are those orbs of 

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.350
 frosts that you see there 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.760
 right now in the background that the only thing that 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:21.610
 It does a lot of damage to us 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.860
 slows down in 85 what the world falls 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.930
 you have to keep loading milk and 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.060
 then the last cast out magic from 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:30.670
 shadows that what it does is that it will absorb 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.569
 the cure that we have until we are 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:36.360
 100k cure when cured ciencas 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:40.390
 will finish what has been absorbing 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.190
 and they can no longer lift their lives and 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:44.200
 last we would have the ability to 

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:46.209
 overflowing energy that are the little balls 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.830
 you are yellow that you are seeing then 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:51.190
 well the person is in charge 

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:53.770
 to mess with the boss right now 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.080
 that are usually hunter or some range that 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:57.730
 have a lot of mobility as people 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:59.680
 that they get in there that is covered 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.600
 earn a shield because that shield is 

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:03.100
 precisely to get under the 

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.240
 yellow balls the balls 

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.130
 yellow 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.700
 they do a million and a half damage or kill 

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:12.130
 you can not reduce the damage of any 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:14.470
 way or invulnerability is neither bubbles 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:17.650
 nor from terraces of the hunter nothing kills you 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:21.820
 it is given without shields it kills you and then 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.950
 you put that shield and if you can eat it 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.690
 If you do not eat it, it will make 70 houses 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.090
 the entire network and when a couple of 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:29.200
 balls at the same time you are going to die and 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:32.020
 until here there is nothing more to add 

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.640
 thank you very much for watching this video and we 

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:35.640
 we see in the next see you later
