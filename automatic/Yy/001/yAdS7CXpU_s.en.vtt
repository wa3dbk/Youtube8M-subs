and<00:03:36.449> it<00:03:37.440> looks<00:03:37.620> like<00:03:37.680> it's<00:03:37.769> all<00:03:38.010> going<00:03:38.160> to<00:03:38.190> go

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:38.310 
and it looks like it's all going to go

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:40.550 
and it looks like it's all going to go
become<00:03:38.639> worthless<00:03:38.879> and<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:40.019> the<00:03:40.169> US<00:03:40.290> and
