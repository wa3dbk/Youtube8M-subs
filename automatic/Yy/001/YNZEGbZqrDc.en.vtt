00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:08.900
 And I say what I goal for many people Tsu goal for many people than is biological 

00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:13.459
 It is not natural for maintaining the status quo 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.990
 Because I have to survive, I have homeostasis, so I have constant breathing 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:20.450
 Wings of factory-made porcelain of Te 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.970
 Blinking or breathing or yes cherry blossoms are usually hoped in a regular cycle 

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:27.000
 Female 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:32.880
 It is also true that the true identity of Hitachi has kept its present true status 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:39.990
 When it is how and our brain to go important so alive tries to maintain the status quo 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:44.790
 Instinct that was provided in nature although it was east would be the goal of maintaining the status quo 

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:47.850
 Tote can only actually see what it takes to maintain the status quo 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:52.460
 That's when it comes to good teams 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:56.410
 I can't make a change Self- hating, for example, I wanted to be a ball 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:59.930
 But because the brain can only see the scene 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:05.120
 The Tteyuu I'm can not see what you need in order to great success 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:08.510
 Self Tteyuu I am a student of about 60 points when you teach in the Speaking of school education 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:10.840
 It's in that comfort zone on that sort of postulate to people the image is made 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:14.130
 It happens to people who say that about 60 points 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:19.649
 For example, if you take 90 points 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:22.430
 Then Kesoshite I think unconsciously funny something properly taking 30 points in the next I test 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.390
 To try to return to the 60-point 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:31.040
 You have to say in their own score Toka self-image I think so something people who are doing time 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:36.230
 I can say anything good first half amazing town staff person and 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:38.150
 If there is a person who seems to have been scolding , then I will hit it in the second half of the land. 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.660
 It's like a double bogey 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.390
 The say pond Pochati is 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:46.050
 5th 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.610
 Something is wrong with your brain if you give a good score 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:54.660
 And was it not to adjust, which I think that I not like would be maintaining the status quo 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:02:00.030
 But properly my ball ball is set is just this 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:01.970
 How many times it 's a rival of the wing that talks about It 's a level that goes on properly 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.850
 Wrapped up 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:08.450
 It'm a pudding inn that was created in to say that very goal in the later Shatti recognition 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.890
 but 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:15.380
 It is noteworthy that our limit is the boundary of the imagination of the accident 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.950
 Go I seriously Nation to our front door accident 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:22.180
 Does the imagination decide the goal? 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:25.989
 It is you if words I uninstall card trigger for professional Actually 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:30.670
 In the image of the goal that everyone who entered now wants to be like this 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:34.930
 In wonder if this is of the Tteyuu Anta is I say the Tteyuu real in real Ikeda 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.970
 Its But I goal as it is not even the top Datte be impossible of felt in the real 

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:41.450
 How happy I was to achieve the goal 

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:45.080
 How fun would it be to get sick of your own image 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:50.030
 It is not an image of a goal but a reason for a bug fight in the goal head 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:53.540
 If you're already a child, you won't come to war fighting discrimination in the world that's what kind of child Terian doesn't come 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.960
 Once I was in I'll be done with it I'm happy now 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:02.340
 The goal is taking such a queuing is I When then I hope a no goal low shot Kyosho 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:05.430
 Where you name your appearance Tteyuu goods was amazing in real 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:09.690
 Keep in mind well what was imaged in the real 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:14.790
 It's about 4 seconds pleasant delightful freshness protection is proud 

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:21.629
 I think it's an emotion I think that one of the long women is happy, pleasant, fresh, fresh and proud 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:22.330
 If it is over while the brain says two floors of a long stroke goal , I will put it after your prepared crown after saying whack 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.620
 When 

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:25.620
 Productivity goes up thoroughly
