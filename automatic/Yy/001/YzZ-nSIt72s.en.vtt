bluetooth<00:01:50.009> I'm<00:01:50.579> going<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.930> share<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> in

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
bluetooth I'm going to not share it in

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.319 
bluetooth I'm going to not share it in
this<00:01:52.950> instance<00:01:53.399> but<00:01:53.610> actually<00:01:53.970> use<00:01:54.149> the

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
this instance but actually use the

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.660 
this instance but actually use the
pop-up<00:01:54.720> player<00:01:55.140> now<00:01:56.040> the<00:01:56.100> public<00:01:56.460> player

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
pop-up player now the public player

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.850 
pop-up player now the public player
again<00:01:57.240> it's<00:01:57.390> more<00:01:57.540> of<00:01:57.630> a<00:01:57.750> gimmick<00:01:58.350> really<00:01:58.740> than

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
again it's more of a gimmick really than

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.590 
again it's more of a gimmick really than
anything<00:01:59.159> else<00:01:59.340> but<00:01:59.490> you<00:01:59.610> can<00:01:59.759> sort<00:01:59.909> of<00:02:00.030> have

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
anything else but you can sort of have

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.679 
anything else but you can sort of have
that<00:02:00.840> video<00:02:01.049> that<00:02:01.469> you're<00:02:01.590> watching<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:02.689> I'm

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689 
that video that you're watching and I'm

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:04.940 
that video that you're watching and I'm
going<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:03.869> wind<00:02:04.079> it<00:02:04.229> back<00:02:04.380> because<00:02:04.530> it's<00:02:04.740> just

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
going to wind it back because it's just

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.969 
going to wind it back because it's just
finished<00:02:05.280> you<00:02:06.210> can<00:02:06.360> have<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:06.840> showing<00:02:07.649> on

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
finished you can have that showing on

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.699 
finished you can have that showing on
your<00:02:08.060> main<00:02:09.060> screen<00:02:09.509> so<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.810> can<00:02:09.929> carry<00:02:10.289> on<00:02:10.379> and

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
your main screen so you can carry on and

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:12.650 
your main screen so you can carry on and
maybe<00:02:11.190> read<00:02:11.459> a<00:02:11.640> book

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
maybe read a book

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.790 
maybe read a book
whilst<00:02:13.660> you've<00:02:13.930> got<00:02:14.080> the<00:02:14.170> video<00:02:14.410> playing<00:02:14.650> in

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
whilst you've got the video playing in

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.870 
whilst you've got the video playing in
the<00:02:14.860> background<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> only<00:02:15.400> thing<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.640> can't

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
the background the only thing you can't

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.240 
the background the only thing you can't
do<00:02:16.060> is<00:02:16.090> is<00:02:16.600> view<00:02:16.959> another<00:02:17.410> do<00:02:17.650> YouTube<00:02:17.950> video

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
do is is view another do YouTube video

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:19.650 
do is is view another do YouTube video
or<00:02:18.459> something<00:02:18.580> similar<00:02:19.090> like<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.480> because

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
or something similar like that because

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.570 
or something similar like that because
it's<00:02:19.930> going<00:02:20.050> to<00:02:20.110> be<00:02:20.200> using<00:02:20.319> the<00:02:21.069> same<00:02:21.310> sort<00:02:21.550> of

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
it's going to be using the same sort of

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.520 
it's going to be using the same sort of
graphics<00:02:21.970> processor<00:02:22.780> I<00:02:22.810> presume<00:02:23.170> you<00:02:23.319> can't

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
graphics processor I presume you can't

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.650 
graphics processor I presume you can't
play<00:02:23.680> two<00:02:23.740> videos<00:02:24.220> at<00:02:24.400> once<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.910> not<00:02:25.569> that

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
play two videos at once and not that

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.840 
play two videos at once and not that
I've<00:02:25.810> seen<00:02:25.840> it<00:02:26.290> being<00:02:26.500> able<00:02:26.740> to<00:02:26.830> do<00:02:26.920> anyway<00:02:27.190> so

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
I've seen it being able to do anyway so

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:31.500 
I've seen it being able to do anyway so
we<00:02:28.240> can<00:02:28.740> have<00:02:29.740> a<00:02:29.800> look<00:02:29.980> at<00:02:30.280> drag<00:02:31.270> this<00:02:31.450> down

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
we can have a look at drag this down

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.370 
we can have a look at drag this down
here<00:02:32.140> and<00:02:32.320> maybe<00:02:33.070> guess<00:02:33.370> let's<00:02:33.990> decide<00:02:34.990> to

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:35.380 
here and maybe guess let's decide to

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.250 
here and maybe guess let's decide to
maybe<00:02:35.650> I<00:02:36.270> don't<00:02:37.270> think<00:02:37.690> it's<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:37.900> to<00:02:37.990> let<00:02:38.140> me

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:38.260 
maybe I don't think it's going to let me

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:39.720 
maybe I don't think it's going to let me
do<00:02:38.380> this<00:02:38.500> but<00:02:38.680> let's<00:02:38.830> drag<00:02:39.040> the<00:02:39.190> camera<00:02:39.550> and

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
do this but let's drag the camera and

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:41.640 
do this but let's drag the camera and
this<00:02:39.850> will<00:02:39.970> probably<00:02:40.150> freak<00:02:40.420> it<00:02:40.570> out<00:02:40.690> now<00:02:41.440> I

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
this will probably freak it out now I

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.470 
this will probably freak it out now I
won't<00:02:41.980> let<00:02:42.130> me<00:02:42.190> use<00:02:42.370> the<00:02:42.520> camera<00:02:42.730> so<00:02:43.060> certainly

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
won't let me use the camera so certainly

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.140 
won't let me use the camera so certainly
instances<00:02:43.959> where<00:02:44.140> it<00:02:44.260> doesn't<00:02:44.470> actually<00:02:44.709> work

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
instances where it doesn't actually work

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.080 
instances where it doesn't actually work
and<00:02:46.150> doesn't<00:02:46.570> run<00:02:46.989> alongside<00:02:47.280> but<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.850> guys

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
and doesn't run alongside but the guys

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.270 
and doesn't run alongside but the guys
from<00:02:49.720> Samsung<00:02:50.650> did<00:02:50.980> show<00:02:51.310> it<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.850> use<00:02:52.180> with<00:02:53.280> the

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
from Samsung did show it in use with the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.490 
from Samsung did show it in use with the
browser<00:02:54.580> in<00:02:54.880> the<00:02:54.970> background<00:02:55.480> so<00:02:55.810> you<00:02:56.050> can

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
browser in the background so you can

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:01.020 
browser in the background so you can
maybe<00:02:56.739> go<00:02:57.100> pop<00:02:57.910> out<00:02:58.090> player<00:02:58.450> and<00:02:58.840> then<00:03:00.000> go<00:03:01.000> into

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
maybe go pop out player and then go into

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:17.310 
maybe go pop out player and then go into
the<00:03:01.390> internet<00:03:05.070> and<00:03:06.070> use<00:03:06.280> Google

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.330 

so<00:03:18.320> you<00:03:18.410> can<00:03:18.530> carry<00:03:18.710> on<00:03:18.770> watching<00:03:18.920> video

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
so you can carry on watching video

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:20.680 
so you can carry on watching video

center having a look at our site it's a

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.210 
center having a look at our site it's a
pretty<00:03:25.340> nice<00:03:25.580> little<00:03:26.380> thing<00:03:27.380> to<00:03:27.590> have<00:03:27.860> I

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
pretty nice little thing to have I

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.250 
pretty nice little thing to have I
wouldn't<00:03:29.030> see<00:03:29.210> people<00:03:29.630> using<00:03:29.660> it<00:03:30.020> every<00:03:30.230> day

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
wouldn't see people using it every day

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:33.220 
wouldn't see people using it every day
but<00:03:30.710> it's<00:03:31.430> pretty<00:03:31.550> cool<00:03:31.790> you<00:03:32.630> can't<00:03:32.810> resize

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:33.230 
but it's pretty cool you can't resize

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.210 
but it's pretty cool you can't resize
this<00:03:33.730> but<00:03:34.730> it's<00:03:34.880> nice<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.270> have<00:03:35.390> their<00:03:36.130> and<00:03:37.130> the
