mechanics of the game are gonna stay

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.460 
mechanics of the game are gonna stay
simple<00:01:29.909> I<00:01:30.180> mean<00:01:30.390> that's<00:01:30.540> the<00:01:30.780> formula<00:01:31.020> if

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
simple I mean that's the formula if

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.679 
simple I mean that's the formula if
people<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.159> like<00:01:32.280> oh<00:01:32.400> it's<00:01:33.000> not<00:01:33.119> even<00:01:33.360> changed

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
people are like oh it's not even changed

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.719 
people are like oh it's not even changed
at<00:01:33.780> all<00:01:33.900> it's<00:01:34.439> changed<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> lot<00:01:35.159> to<00:01:35.340> be<00:01:35.460> fairly

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
at all it's changed a lot to be fairly

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.100 
at all it's changed a lot to be fairly
honest<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.299> I'm<00:01:36.360> just<00:01:36.479> gonna<00:01:36.600> kind<00:01:36.840> of<00:01:36.900> put

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
honest and I'm just gonna kind of put

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.060 
honest and I'm just gonna kind of put
this<00:01:37.229> out<00:01:37.439> there<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.650> not<00:01:37.710> defending

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
this out there I'm not defending

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.530 
this out there I'm not defending
battlefield<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.820> explaining<00:01:39.240> things

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
battlefield I'm explaining things

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.730 
battlefield I'm explaining things
because<00:01:39.840> there's<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.110> lot<00:01:40.259> of<00:01:40.290> stupid<00:01:40.560> people

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
because there's a lot of stupid people

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:45.830 
because there's a lot of stupid people
out<00:01:41.130> there<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.380> truth<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.880> if<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.630> think

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
out there and truth is if you think

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.210 
out there and truth is if you think
about<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.049> battlefield<00:01:46.380> 3<00:01:46.680> in<00:01:46.770> battlefield<00:01:47.159> 4

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
about a battlefield 3 in battlefield 4

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.310 
about a battlefield 3 in battlefield 4
there<00:01:47.610> wasn't<00:01:47.970> massive<00:01:48.630> innovation<00:01:49.140> there

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
there wasn't massive innovation there

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.929 
there wasn't massive innovation there
that<00:01:49.500> wasn't<00:01:49.740> anything<00:01:50.040> really<00:01:50.399> really<00:01:50.729> crazy

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
that wasn't anything really really crazy

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.039 
that wasn't anything really really crazy
they<00:01:51.210> started<00:01:51.479> bringing<00:01:51.570> in<00:01:51.780> a<00:01:51.869> lot<00:01:51.990> of

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
they started bringing in a lot of

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:52.910 
they started bringing in a lot of
equipment<00:01:52.380> but<00:01:52.680> other<00:01:52.770> than<00:01:52.860> that

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
equipment but other than that

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:54.560 
equipment but other than that
battlefield<00:01:53.369> 3<00:01:53.640> battlefield<00:01:53.670> 4<00:01:54.299> were<00:01:54.420> damn

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570 
battlefield 3 battlefield 4 were damn

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.910 
battlefield 3 battlefield 4 were damn
near<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.780> same<00:01:54.869> game<00:01:55.259> little<00:01:55.590> things<00:01:55.799> were

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
near the same game little things were

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.670 
near the same game little things were
added<00:01:56.219> in<00:01:56.310> like<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:57.329> know<00:01:57.469> counter<00:01:58.469> knives

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
added in like you know counter knives

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.800 
added in like you know counter knives
and<00:01:59.189> bullet<00:01:59.820> trails<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.360> stuff<00:02:00.450> like<00:02:00.750> that

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
and bullet trails and stuff like that

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.539 
and bullet trails and stuff like that
but<00:02:01.140> overall<00:02:01.409> there<00:02:01.710> wasn't<00:02:02.009> like<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.340> massive

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
but overall there wasn't like a massive

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:05.450 
but overall there wasn't like a massive
change<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.119> game<00:02:03.299> played<00:02:03.719> an<00:02:04.049> experience<00:02:04.710> was

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
change the game played an experience was

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.660 
change the game played an experience was
the<00:02:05.670> same<00:02:05.939> so<00:02:06.810> with<00:02:07.079> that<00:02:07.200> being<00:02:07.380> said

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
the same so with that being said

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.150 
the same so with that being said
hardline<00:02:08.670> is<00:02:08.849> a<00:02:08.879> different<00:02:09.300> direction<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
hardline is a different direction and I

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.979 
hardline is a different direction and I
think<00:02:11.400> what<00:02:11.520> they're<00:02:11.640> targeting<00:02:12.150> is<00:02:12.330> people

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
think what they're targeting is people

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:13.850 
think what they're targeting is people
that

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
that

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.650 
that
like<00:02:13.950> close<00:02:14.400> quarter<00:02:14.670> combat<00:02:14.700> that<00:02:15.390> like

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
like close quarter combat that like

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.990 
like close quarter combat that like
fast-paced<00:02:16.230> fun<00:02:16.830> a<00:02:17.040> lot<00:02:17.550> of<00:02:17.610> people<00:02:17.880> like

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:18.000 
fast-paced fun a lot of people like

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.730 
fast-paced fun a lot of people like
although<00:02:18.210> try<00:02:18.510> and<00:02:18.660> lure<00:02:19.020> in<00:02:19.260> the<00:02:19.380> call<00:02:19.590> of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
although try and lure in the call of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:21.350 
although try and lure in the call of
duty<00:02:19.770> crowd<00:02:20.250> that's<00:02:20.520> not<00:02:20.700> necessarily<00:02:21.210> true

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
duty crowd that's not necessarily true

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.590 
duty crowd that's not necessarily true
of<00:02:21.960> course<00:02:22.230> their<00:02:22.440> their<00:02:22.890> idea<00:02:23.700> and<00:02:23.790> objective

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:24.600 
of course their their idea and objective

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:25.940 
of course their their idea and objective
is<00:02:24.690> to<00:02:24.780> gain<00:02:24.900> more<00:02:25.080> sales<00:02:25.350> make<00:02:25.620> more<00:02:25.770> money

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
is to gain more sales make more money

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.190 
is to gain more sales make more money
obviously<00:02:26.220> as<00:02:26.640> any<00:02:26.850> business<00:02:27.330> but<00:02:28.050> what<00:02:28.170> I

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
obviously as any business but what I

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.540 
obviously as any business but what I
think<00:02:28.440> they're<00:02:28.560> trying<00:02:28.800> to<00:02:28.980> do<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.280> I<00:02:29.310> think

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
think they're trying to do is I think

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.760 
think they're trying to do is I think
they're<00:02:29.700> targeting<00:02:30.180> fun<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:31.140> my<00:02:31.320> reasoning

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
they're targeting fun in my reasoning

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:33.950 
they're targeting fun in my reasoning
for<00:02:31.920> this<00:02:31.980> is<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.670> different<00:02:33.210> now<00:02:33.330> so<00:02:33.540> yes<00:02:33.780> of

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:33.960 
for this is it's different now so yes of

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.450 
for this is it's different now so yes of
course<00:02:34.170> it's<00:02:34.380> more<00:02:34.800> close<00:02:35.040> quarters<00:02:35.430> and

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460 
course it's more close quarters and

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.590 
course it's more close quarters and
that's<00:02:35.700> why<00:02:35.820> everyone<00:02:36.210> she's<00:02:36.330> always

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:36.600 
that's why everyone she's always

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.260 
that's why everyone she's always
defaults<00:02:37.200> to<00:02:37.230> let<00:02:37.830> Scott<00:02:38.280> that's<00:02:39.030> not

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
defaults to let Scott that's not

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.750 
defaults to let Scott that's not
necessarily<00:02:39.840> true<00:02:39.990> I<00:02:40.350> think<00:02:41.310> they're<00:02:41.430> aiming

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
necessarily true I think they're aiming

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.340 
necessarily true I think they're aiming
for<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> feature<00:02:42.180> that<00:02:42.330> still<00:02:42.660> retains<00:02:42.810> what<00:02:43.230> it

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
for a feature that still retains what it

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.840 
for a feature that still retains what it
is<00:02:43.440> with<00:02:43.590> battlefield<00:02:43.920> with<00:02:44.220> all<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.550> armor

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
is with battlefield with all the armor

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.430 
is with battlefield with all the armor
on<00:02:44.940> the<00:02:45.060> map<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.420> still<00:02:45.600> have<00:02:45.690> your<00:02:45.810> classes

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
on the map you still have your classes

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.370 
on the map you still have your classes
with<00:02:46.709> you<00:02:46.920> know<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:48.300> professional<00:02:48.990> and<00:02:49.260> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
with you know the professional and and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:50.960 
with you know the professional and and
stuff<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:49.830> that<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.310> experience<00:02:50.790> at<00:02:50.940> a

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
stuff like that that you experience at a

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:52.340 
stuff like that that you experience at a
battlefield<00:02:51.330> so<00:02:51.630> a<00:02:51.660> lot<00:02:51.810> of<00:02:51.840> the<00:02:51.989> equipment<00:02:52.110> a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
battlefield so a lot of the equipment a

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.900 
battlefield so a lot of the equipment a
lot<00:02:52.500> of<00:02:52.650> guns<00:02:52.830> a<00:02:52.980> lot<00:02:53.040> of<00:02:53.250> that<00:02:53.340> stuff<00:02:53.580> is<00:02:53.730> still

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
lot of guns a lot of that stuff is still

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.610 
lot of guns a lot of that stuff is still
there<00:02:53.940> even<00:02:54.090> some<00:02:54.450> new<00:02:54.630> stuff<00:02:54.900> like<00:02:55.110> ziplines

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
there even some new stuff like ziplines

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.110 
there even some new stuff like ziplines
and<00:02:55.830> grappling<00:02:56.250> hooks<00:02:56.430> they've<00:02:56.790> incorporated

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
and grappling hooks they've incorporated

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.570 
and grappling hooks they've incorporated
a<00:02:57.540> few<00:02:57.720> new<00:02:57.870> ideas<00:02:58.020> to<00:02:58.500> go<00:02:58.950> along<00:02:59.250> with<00:02:59.459> this

game<00:05:46.110> like<00:05:46.289> hardline<00:05:46.740> I'd<00:05:47.189> probably<00:05:47.490> do<00:05:47.879> it

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:48.029 
game like hardline I'd probably do it

00:05:48.029 --> 00:05:50.149 
game like hardline I'd probably do it
especially<00:05:48.389> if<00:05:49.050> it<00:05:49.139> plays<00:05:49.409> differently<00:05:49.919> than

00:05:50.149 --> 00:05:50.159 
especially if it plays differently than

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:51.980 
especially if it plays differently than
the<00:05:50.279> other<00:05:50.460> battlefield<00:05:51.029> title<00:05:51.330> so<00:05:51.719> you<00:05:51.779> got

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
the other battlefield title so you got

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:53.899 
the other battlefield title so you got
your<00:05:52.020> guaranteed<00:05:52.620> every<00:05:52.889> title<00:05:53.219> two<00:05:53.580> years

00:05:53.899 --> 00:05:53.909 
your guaranteed every title two years

00:05:53.909 --> 00:05:55.339 
your guaranteed every title two years
battlefield<00:05:54.539> that<00:05:54.689> you're<00:05:54.870> used<00:05:55.080> to<00:05:55.199> your

00:05:55.339 --> 00:05:55.349 
battlefield that you're used to your

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:56.600 
battlefield that you're used to your
core<00:05:55.589> battlefield<00:05:56.129> with<00:05:56.310> your<00:05:56.430> large

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:56.610
