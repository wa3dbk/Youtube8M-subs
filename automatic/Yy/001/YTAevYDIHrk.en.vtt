tank<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.870> top<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.440> collectors<00:00:07.890> on<00:00:08.040> the

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:08.130 
tank on the top the collectors on the

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.150 
tank on the top the collectors on the
bottom<00:00:08.460> there<00:00:08.670> this<00:00:09.150> uses<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:10.070> glycol<00:00:11.070> solution

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
bottom there this uses a glycol solution

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.680 
bottom there this uses a glycol solution
which<00:00:14.160> circulates<00:00:14.759> through<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> panel<00:00:15.540> and

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
which circulates through the panel and

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.970 
which circulates through the panel and
goes<00:00:15.870> up<00:00:16.020> into<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.820> big<00:00:17.820> silver<00:00:18.119> tank<00:00:18.510> and

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:18.980 
goes up into the big silver tank and

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.890 
goes up into the big silver tank and
that's<00:00:19.980> where<00:00:20.220> it<00:00:20.340> exchanges<00:00:21.330> its<00:00:21.480> heat<00:00:21.660> with

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
that's where it exchanges its heat with

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.450 
that's where it exchanges its heat with
the<00:00:21.930> water<00:00:22.230> coming<00:00:22.590> in<00:00:22.680> from<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.920> house<00:00:23.070> cold

the water coming in from the house cold

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.529 
the water coming in from the house cold
water<00:00:23.699> and<00:00:24.920> we're<00:00:25.920> using<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.340> as<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:27.000> pre

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
water and we're using this as a pre

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.820 
water and we're using this as a pre
heater<00:00:27.810> to<00:00:28.019> our<00:00:28.109> gas<00:00:28.349> hot<00:00:28.619> water<00:00:28.650> heater<00:00:30.830> seems

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
heater to our gas hot water heater seems

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.380 
heater to our gas hot water heater seems
to<00:00:31.890> be<00:00:31.949> working<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.399> good<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.940> only<00:00:33.180> weird

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
to be working pretty good the only weird

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.930 
to be working pretty good the only weird
thing<00:00:33.450> is<00:00:34.050> if<00:00:34.380> you<00:00:34.469> need<00:00:34.649> parts<00:00:35.130> kind<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.760> hard

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
thing is if you need parts kind of hard

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.209 
thing is if you need parts kind of hard
to<00:00:36.059> get<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.420> tomato<00:00:36.660> Australia<00:00:37.290> that

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
to get to the tomato Australia that

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
to get to the tomato Australia that
right<00:00:38.489> that<00:00:38.730> pipe<00:00:39.030> you<00:00:39.180> see<00:00:39.329> on<00:00:39.390> the<00:00:39.480> right

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
right that pipe you see on the right

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.569 
right that pipe you see on the right
side<00:00:39.690> one<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.590> the<00:00:40.710> fittings<00:00:41.070> didn't<00:00:41.370> fit<00:00:41.520> very

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
side one of the fittings didn't fit very

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.380 
side one of the fittings didn't fit very
good<00:00:41.940> and<00:00:42.710> it<00:00:43.710> was<00:00:43.860> hard<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.340> see<00:00:45.090> if<00:00:45.149> I<00:00:45.239> could

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
good and it was hard to see if I could

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.970 
good and it was hard to see if I could
get<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.510> new<00:00:45.690> one<00:00:45.809> finally<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.260> did<00:00:46.739> enough

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
get a new one finally I did enough

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:48.410 
get a new one finally I did enough
filing<00:00:47.370> on<00:00:47.460> it<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.610> get<00:00:47.760> two<00:00:47.850> fitting<00:00:48.120> to<00:00:48.210> fit

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
filing on it to get two fitting to fit

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.630 
filing on it to get two fitting to fit
properly<00:00:48.600> but<00:00:49.219> anyway<00:00:50.219> that's<00:00:50.370> something<00:00:50.579> to

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
properly but anyway that's something to

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.369 
properly but anyway that's something to
consider<00:00:50.730> because<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.449> is<00:00:51.539> made<00:00:51.750> in<00:00:51.870> Australia

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
consider because it is made in Australia

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.569 
consider because it is made in Australia
but<00:00:52.590> they<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:53.010> pretty<00:00:53.190> good<00:00:53.370> support

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
but they do have pretty good support

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.610 
but they do have pretty good support
here<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.239> the<00:00:55.199> States<00:00:57.050> here<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.140> can<00:00:58.260> see<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
here in the States here you can see the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.020 
here in the States here you can see the
the<00:00:58.859> collectors<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> bottom<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.850> has<00:00:59.910> a

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
the collectors on the bottom that has a

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.520 
the collectors on the bottom that has a
glycol<00:01:00.539> solution<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:02.420> the<00:01:03.420> gleich<00:01:03.660> glycol

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
glycol solution and the gleich glycol

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.310 
glycol solution and the gleich glycol
solution<00:01:04.949> gets<00:01:05.100> heated<00:01:05.280> up<00:01:06.080> comes<00:01:07.080> out<00:01:07.229> of

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
solution gets heated up comes out of

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.399 
solution gets heated up comes out of
this<00:01:07.409> pipe<00:01:07.680> here<00:01:08.220> and<00:01:08.570> goes<00:01:09.570> into<00:01:09.900> the<00:01:10.049> tank

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
this pipe here and goes into the tank

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:14.469 
this pipe here and goes into the tank
and<00:01:11.390> in<00:01:12.390> the<00:01:12.689> tank<00:01:12.990> it<00:01:13.200> exchanges<00:01:13.680> heat<00:01:13.950> with

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:14.479 
and in the tank it exchanges heat with

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.140 
and in the tank it exchanges heat with
47<00:01:15.479> gallons<00:01:15.780> of<00:01:15.900> water<00:01:16.470> in<00:01:16.680> there<00:01:16.909> the<00:01:17.909> cold

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
47 gallons of water in there the cold

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.749 
47 gallons of water in there the cold
water<00:01:18.420> from<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.720> house<00:01:18.869> comes<00:01:19.680> in<00:01:19.860> here<00:01:20.250> it

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
water from the house comes in here it

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.039 
water from the house comes in here it
goes<00:01:20.909> into<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.299> tank<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.689> that's<00:01:21.780> where<00:01:21.990> it

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
goes into the tank and that's where it

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:24.920 
goes into the tank and that's where it
gets<00:01:22.369> heat<00:01:23.369> exchange<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:24.090> then<00:01:24.570> once<00:01:24.780> it's

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
gets heat exchange and then once it's

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.320 
gets heat exchange and then once it's
heated<00:01:25.170> up<00:01:25.340> comes<00:01:26.340> out<00:01:26.490> of<00:01:26.549> this<00:01:26.640> hot<00:01:26.909> pipe

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.969 
heated up comes out of this hot pipe
here<00:01:27.600> comes<00:01:27.869> out<00:01:27.990> hot<00:01:28.200> and<00:01:28.640> into<00:01:29.640> the<00:01:29.729> house

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
here comes out hot and into the house

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.080 
here comes out hot and into the house
this<00:01:31.979> is<00:01:32.040> showing<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.490> temperature<00:01:32.790> on<00:01:33.060> the

the air temperatures about 70 and it's
fairly<00:01:45.180> early<00:01:45.420> in<00:01:45.570> the<00:01:45.659> day<00:01:45.840> so<00:01:45.899> we're<00:01:46.229> doing

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
fairly early in the day so we're doing

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.710 
fairly early in the day so we're doing
pretty<00:01:46.439> good<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.310> this<00:01:47.520> feeds<00:01:48.060> into<00:01:48.180> our<00:01:48.509> hot

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
pretty good and this feeds into our hot

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.929 
pretty good and this feeds into our hot
water<00:01:48.750> heater<00:01:49.200> cold<00:01:49.590> supply<00:01:49.979> we're<00:01:50.820> using

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
water heater cold supply we're using

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.030 
water heater cold supply we're using
this<00:01:51.149> as<00:01:51.210> a<00:01:51.390> pre<00:01:51.750> heater<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.409> gas<00:01:52.710> water

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
this as a pre heater to our gas water

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.660 
this as a pre heater to our gas water
heater<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.670> down<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:55.280> today<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.460> I<00:01:56.579> think

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
heater and down there today it's I think

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.990 
heater and down there today it's I think
it's<00:01:56.850> about<00:01:57.380> 98<00:01:58.380> 99<00:01:58.770> 100<00:01:59.100> degrees<00:01:59.610> going<00:01:59.850> into

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000
