road<00:00:46.640> today<00:00:46.900> so<00:00:47.900> what<00:00:48.050> we're<00:00:48.170> going<00:00:48.260> to<00:00:48.320> do<00:00:48.500> is

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:48.680 
road today so what we're going to do is

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.130 
road today so what we're going to do is
we're<00:00:48.890> going<00:00:48.920> to<00:00:49.150> have<00:00:50.150> a<00:00:50.210> quick<00:00:50.540> check<00:00:50.840> to<00:00:50.990> see

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:51.140 
we're going to have a quick check to see

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.630 
we're going to have a quick check to see
if<00:00:51.200> we<00:00:51.290> can<00:00:51.440> diagnose<00:00:51.860> what<00:00:52.070> the<00:00:52.100> problem<00:00:52.520> is

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
if we can diagnose what the problem is

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.700 
if we can diagnose what the problem is
with<00:00:52.790> our<00:00:52.940> vehicle<00:00:53.420> and<00:00:53.600> find<00:00:54.260> out<00:00:54.410> why<00:00:54.650> the

with our vehicle and find out why the

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:06.999 
with our vehicle and find out why the
airbag<00:00:55.160> light<00:00:55.370> is<00:00:55.520> on<00:01:05.409> just<00:01:06.409> need<00:01:06.560> to<00:01:06.680> scroll

00:01:06.999 --> 00:01:07.009 
airbag light is on just need to scroll

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:11.080 
airbag light is on just need to scroll
down<00:01:07.900> it<00:01:08.900> will<00:01:09.080> either<00:01:09.200> say<00:01:09.500> mr<00:01:09.920> s<00:01:10.130> as<00:01:10.670> its<00:01:10.910> ears

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
down it will either say mr s as its ears

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.020 
down it will either say mr s as its ears
hear<00:01:11.300> multiple<00:01:11.540> restraint<00:01:12.230> system<00:01:12.710> or<00:01:13.030> srs

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:16.330 
which is supplemental restraint system

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:21.210 
which is supplemental restraint system
so<00:01:17.330> in<00:01:17.420> this<00:01:17.540> vehicle<00:01:17.900> it's<00:01:17.990> showing<00:01:18.290> up<00:01:18.410> mrs

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
all we're going to read the codes find

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.460 
all we're going to read the codes find
out<00:01:29.330> where<00:01:29.510> the<00:01:29.630> problem<00:01:29.720> is<00:01:32.350> and<00:01:33.350> it's

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:33.470 
out where the problem is and it's

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:36.340 
out where the problem is and it's
telling<00:01:33.740> us<00:01:33.830> straight<00:01:34.070> away<00:01:34.750> that<00:01:35.750> there<00:01:36.140> is<00:01:36.320> a

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
telling us straight away that there is a

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.620 
telling us straight away that there is a
problem<00:01:36.800> with<00:01:37.130> the<00:01:37.250> seat<00:01:37.490> seat<00:01:38.150> occupancy

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
problem with the seat seat occupancy

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:43.120 
problem with the seat seat occupancy
detector<00:01:39.700> and<00:01:41.170> the<00:01:42.170> belt<00:01:42.440> tensioner<00:01:42.920> on<00:01:43.040> the

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
detector and the belt tensioner on the

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.880 
detector and the belt tensioner on the
front<00:01:43.820> passenger<00:01:44.420> seat<00:01:44.780> so<00:01:45.530> what<00:01:45.680> we're<00:01:45.800> going

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
front passenger seat so what we're going

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:47.190 
front passenger seat so what we're going
to<00:01:45.950> do<00:01:46.040> is<00:01:46.159> we're<00:01:46.280> going<00:01:46.370> to<00:01:46.430> check<00:01:46.640> that<00:01:46.700> out

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
to do is we're going to check that out

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.630 
to do is we're going to check that out
the<00:01:48.200> chances<00:01:48.590> are<00:01:48.710> it's<00:01:48.830> probably<00:01:49.010> just<00:01:49.460> a

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640 
the chances are it's probably just a

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.700 
the chances are it's probably just a
loose<00:01:49.790> connection<00:01:50.290> but<00:01:51.290> either<00:01:51.350> way<00:01:51.530> we'll

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
loose connection but either way we'll

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.469 
loose connection but either way we'll
check<00:01:51.979> it<00:01:52.130> out<00:01:52.220> and<00:01:52.490> then<00:01:53.000> we'll<00:01:53.180> come<00:01:53.450> back

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:53.479 
check it out and then we'll come back

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.789 
check it out and then we'll come back
and<00:01:55.330> try<00:01:56.330> and<00:01:56.360> erase<00:01:56.659> the<00:01:56.840> codes<00:01:57.080> and<00:01:57.380> see<00:01:57.680> if

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
and try and erase the codes and see if

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.219 
and try and erase the codes and see if
the<00:01:58.010> airbag<00:01:58.850> light<00:01:59.090> will<00:01:59.420> be<00:01:59.840> removed<00:02:00.170> from

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the airbag light will be removed from

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:04.510 
the airbag light will be removed from
the<00:02:00.409> dashboard<00:02:02.409> so<00:02:03.409> now<00:02:03.590> back<00:02:03.799> in<00:02:03.979> the<00:02:04.070> vehicle

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
that can take sort of up to 30 seconds

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.790 
that can take sort of up to 30 seconds
or<00:02:59.830> a<00:02:59.890> minute<00:02:59.920> or<00:03:00.250> so<00:03:01.140> this<00:03:02.140> one<00:03:02.380> here<00:03:02.680> it's

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
or a minute or so this one here it's

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.620 
or a minute or so this one here it's
doing<00:03:03.010> it<00:03:03.100> now<00:03:03.250> within<00:03:03.459> about<00:03:03.610> 30<00:03:03.940> seconds<00:03:04.480> and

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
doing it now within about 30 seconds and

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.630 
doing it now within about 30 seconds and
as<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.140> can<00:03:05.290> see<00:03:05.440> the<00:03:05.590> air<00:03:05.709> bag<00:03:05.920> light<00:03:06.160> has
