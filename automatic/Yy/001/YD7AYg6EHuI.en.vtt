think that black men do that as opposed
to<00:03:08.019> white<00:03:08.410> men<00:03:08.650> or<00:03:08.950> men<00:03:09.580> of<00:03:09.730> other<00:03:09.880> whoa<00:03:10.269> I

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
to white men or men of other whoa I

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.449 
to white men or men of other whoa I
think<00:03:10.690> white<00:03:11.230> men<00:03:11.470> for<00:03:11.769> one<00:03:11.860> won't<00:03:12.100> do<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:12.459 
think white men for one won't do it

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:14.130 
think white men for one won't do it
because<00:03:12.549> they'll<00:03:12.880> be<00:03:13.030> shown<00:03:13.269> as<00:03:13.450> a<00:03:13.480> racist<00:03:13.690> and

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:14.140 
because they'll be shown as a racist and

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:15.690 
because they'll be shown as a racist and
they'll<00:03:14.260> be<00:03:14.440> looked<00:03:14.860> at<00:03:15.010> as<00:03:15.130> races<00:03:15.519> that's

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
they'll be looked at as races that's

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.699 
they'll be looked at as races that's
that<00:03:15.970> line<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.569> black<00:03:17.049> men<00:03:17.320> so<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:17.560> they
