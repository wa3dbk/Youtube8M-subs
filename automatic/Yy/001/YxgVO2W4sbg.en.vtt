information<00:02:37.209> so<00:02:37.989> we<00:02:38.170> went<00:02:38.380> to<00:02:39.190> use<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.970> HP<00:02:40.630> set

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
information so we went to use the HP set

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.339 
information so we went to use the HP set
400<00:02:42.069> series<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.760> for<00:02:43.360> more<00:02:43.599> advanced

00:02:44.339 --> 00:02:44.349 
400 series and for more advanced

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.839 
400 series and for more advanced
engineering<00:02:45.209> we<00:02:46.209> are<00:02:46.390> using<00:02:46.780> the<00:02:47.170> HP<00:02:47.440> set<00:02:48.190> 800

00:02:48.839 --> 00:02:48.849 
engineering we are using the HP set 800

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.869 
engineering we are using the HP set 800
series<00:02:49.150> workstation

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
series workstation

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:55.280 
series workstation
so<00:02:51.810> totally<00:02:52.349> we<00:02:52.829> have<00:02:52.859> now<00:02:53.310> approximately<00:02:54.290> 550

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:55.290 
so totally we have now approximately 550

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:01.190 
so totally we have now approximately 550
workstations<00:02:56.780> 550<00:02:57.780> desktops<00:02:59.180> around<00:03:00.200> 500

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.229 
workstations 550 desktops around 500
laptops<00:03:01.680> and<00:03:01.980> worldwide<00:03:02.790> we<00:03:03.120> are<00:03:03.269> using<00:03:03.889> 2500

00:03:05.229 --> 00:03:05.239 
laptops and worldwide we are using 2500

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:14.330

LCD<00:03:06.239> screens<00:03:06.599> and<00:03:08.510> 125<00:03:09.799> servers

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.000 

worldwide<00:03:15.150> we<00:03:15.720> are<00:03:15.810> using<00:03:16.080> the<00:03:16.710> same

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
worldwide we are using the same

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.280 
worldwide we are using the same
specifications<00:03:17.460> of<00:03:18.270> the<00:03:18.630> hardware<00:03:19.020> and

operating system and all the software

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.730 
operating system and all the software
packages<00:03:23.340> is<00:03:23.640> easier<00:03:24.240> quicker<00:03:24.810> than<00:03:25.470> ever
