00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:14.920
 hi there, tungsten is the first 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.800
 Yaroslavl videobloger today we will 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.890
 cook do you think that of course we 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:24.100
 Today we will cook sugar so us 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:33.729
 components wow you almost fell sugar 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:38.219
 sand ordinary milk is ground dried apricots 

00:00:33.729 --> 00:00:43.620
 in a blender chop nuts and hazelnuts 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:59.829
 famous metallics retreat three 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:01:01.859
 cups of sugar 2 sand with 13 and a glass 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.859
 of milk 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:28.550
 let's do this a little more 

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:42.630
 now comes the rest of the fire will not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.210
 cook 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:51.690
 how long do I not even know while we will 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:56.570
 check from time to time and the very end 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:56.570
 add this this is nuts and 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.730
 minutes sort of probably have to cook this 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.730
 keep on constantly 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.490
 nothing burned not burned here the most 

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:13.860
 the main thing is that if you did not let loose 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:16.980
 he will be soft at all like some 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.790
 molasses such garbage is very once and if 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:23.580
 digesting it can burn or will be like 

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:27.180
 granite stone did not crack his name 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:33.140
 will be so what is the optimal 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:40.260
 option to find boil with us the whole thing 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:42.420
 Miller gas I turned off the minimum I will do 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.900
 for a long time this sugar does not boil for 10 years 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.900
 I guess maybe it wo n't work 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.720
 already little by little here all for huss it this 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.330
 mass I think another five minutes such 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:06.239
 a brown color appears for another 5 minutes and 

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:12.530
 we'll blow plates 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.530
 a lot of greased with butter 

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:24.670
 so that sugar does not stick to the time passed 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.819
 itâ€™s already up to 40 minutes 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:31.890
 close to completion 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:39.690
 Now we add butter 

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:39.690
 just give me a piece 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:04:09.750
 dried apricots mix all this and all 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:20.140
 plates 

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:25.300
 we spill it all in one plate 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:28.860
 month on the choir is not 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:41.700
 I thought I thought in two plates 

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:45.600
 one instantly freezes everything 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.600
 almost ready 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:58.860
 before that I snickers 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:05:03.539
 it's much tastier let's get down to 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:12.139
 tastings will cut him so he is not yet 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:12.139
 completely cooled nothing like that. 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:29.729
 He smells like a nut in the same 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:29.729
 which were added crumbly 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.679
 great taste 

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:46.050
 I thought this sugar won't work because 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:53.389
 what has long said it pinned 10 

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:53.389
 but in the end everything turned out even cool and 

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:06.180
 tasty and you had tungsten
