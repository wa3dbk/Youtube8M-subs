watch<00:00:52.220> window<00:00:52.460> yeah<00:00:52.760> it<00:00:53.120> seems<00:00:53.390> like<00:00:54.730> me<00:00:55.840> is

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:56.840 
watch window yeah it seems like me is

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.799 
watch window yeah it seems like me is
taking<00:00:57.170> a<00:00:57.350> lot<00:00:57.920> of<00:00:58.609> areas<00:00:59.300> into<00:00:59.480> his<00:00:59.629> game<00:00:59.780> plan

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
taking a lot of areas into his game plan

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:03.279 
taking a lot of areas into his game plan
right<00:01:00.199> now<00:01:00.230> yeah<00:01:01.160> in<00:01:01.670> my<00:01:02.390> mind<00:01:02.660> I<00:01:02.870> would<00:01:02.929> think

00:01:03.279 --> 00:01:03.289 
right now yeah in my mind I would think

00:01:03.289 --> 00:01:05.169 
right now yeah in my mind I would think
mark<00:01:03.590> one<00:01:03.769> wants<00:01:04.369> to<00:01:04.460> stick<00:01:04.670> to<00:01:04.820> the<00:01:04.850> ground

00:01:05.169 --> 00:01:05.179 
mark one wants to stick to the ground

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:07.120 
mark one wants to stick to the ground
but<00:01:05.840> maybe<00:01:05.990> moves<00:01:06.289> to<00:01:06.500> know<00:01:06.679> something<00:01:07.009> I

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
but maybe moves to know something I

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.139 
but maybe moves to know something I
don't<00:01:07.160> I'm<00:01:07.640> not<00:01:07.820> imagining<00:01:08.000> so<00:01:09.250> whoa<00:01:10.250> I<00:01:10.550> I

00:01:11.139 --> 00:01:11.149 
don't I'm not imagining so whoa I I

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:13.450 
don't I'm not imagining so whoa I I
don't<00:01:11.660> really<00:01:11.869> play<00:01:12.350> this<00:01:12.500> matchup<00:01:12.920> too<00:01:13.100> often

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
don't really play this matchup too often

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.060 
don't really play this matchup too often
but<00:01:14.240> I<00:01:14.300> definitely<00:01:14.660> think<00:01:15.229> that<00:01:15.380> you<00:01:15.649> serve

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
but I definitely think that you serve

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.410 
but I definitely think that you serve
yourself<00:01:16.220> better<00:01:16.580> by<00:01:16.759> doing<00:01:16.820> that<00:01:17.119> see<00:01:17.330> the

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:17.420 
yourself better by doing that see the

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.450 
yourself better by doing that see the
down<00:01:17.600> tail<00:01:17.810> down<00:01:18.020> tilts<00:01:18.380> down<00:01:18.560> tilting<00:01:19.250> and

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:19.460 
down tail down tilts down tilting and

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.130 
down tail down tilts down tilting and
staying<00:01:19.909> grounded<00:01:20.240> is<00:01:20.570> usually<00:01:20.869> what<00:01:21.050> I<00:01:21.080> try

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
staying grounded is usually what I try

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.680 
staying grounded is usually what I try
to<00:01:21.320> do<00:01:21.500> I<00:01:21.830> tried<00:01:22.520> not<00:01:22.700> to<00:01:22.940> take<00:01:23.240> to<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.479> sky

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:23.690 
to do I tried not to take to the sky

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:28.150 
to do I tried not to take to the sky
that<00:01:23.899> much<00:01:24.110> extra<00:01:26.020> and<00:01:27.020> that<00:01:27.530> is<00:01:27.739> not<00:01:27.770> safe

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.160 
that much extra and that is not safe

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.090 
that much extra and that is not safe
this<00:01:28.489> phase<00:01:28.700> just<00:01:28.970> attack<00:01:29.209> yeah

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.310 

he<00:01:34.100> could<00:01:34.310> have<00:01:34.450> been<00:01:35.450> doing<00:01:35.720> anything<00:01:35.990> that's

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
he could have been doing anything that's

he could have been doing anything that's
not<00:01:36.500> safe<00:01:36.770> is<00:01:38.799> it's<00:01:39.799> worse<00:01:40.130> at<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> matchup<00:01:40.670> like

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:40.940 
not safe is it's worse at a matchup like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.120 
not safe is it's worse at a matchup like

mean<00:07:12.670> depending<00:07:12.970> on<00:07:13.090> your<00:07:13.210> philosophy<00:07:13.720> it

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:13.840 
mean depending on your philosophy it

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.790 
mean depending on your philosophy it
could<00:07:13.990> be<00:07:14.080> deserved<00:07:14.380> it<00:07:14.500> could<00:07:14.620> not<00:07:14.770> be

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800 
could be deserved it could not be

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:18.000 
could be deserved it could not be
deserved<00:07:15.190> but<00:07:15.580> I<00:07:16.570> think<00:07:17.230> the<00:07:17.350> main<00:07:17.560> reason<00:07:17.620> is

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.010 
deserved but I think the main reason is

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:21.150 
deserved but I think the main reason is
like<00:07:18.220> the<00:07:18.630> the<00:07:19.630> wobble<00:07:20.020> which<00:07:20.320> is<00:07:20.440> everybody's

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:21.160 
like the the wobble which is everybody's

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.760 
like the the wobble which is everybody's
main<00:07:21.370> fear<00:07:21.700> it<00:07:22.090> was<00:07:22.510> like<00:07:22.660> the<00:07:22.840> last<00:07:23.020> remaining

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:23.770 
main fear it was like the last remaining

00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:27.780 
main fear it was like the last remaining
truly<00:07:24.760> unescapable<00:07:25.330> thing
