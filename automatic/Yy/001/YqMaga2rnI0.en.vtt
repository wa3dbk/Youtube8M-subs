00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:55.190 
most when it comes to the design of a

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.479 
most when it comes to the design of a
mobile<00:03:55.459> phone<00:03:55.670> in<00:03:56.530> the<00:03:57.530> main<00:03:57.709> is<00:03:58.099> it<00:03:58.370> about

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
mobile phone in the main is it about

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.820 
mobile phone in the main is it about
asserting<00:03:59.150> design<00:03:59.599> style<00:03:59.959> is<00:04:00.230> about<00:04:00.709> the

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:00.830 
asserting design style is about the

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.330 
asserting design style is about the
talent<00:04:01.040> you'll<00:04:01.400> finishing<00:04:02.350> cloud<00:04:03.350> action<00:04:04.069> or

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.940 
talent you'll finishing cloud action or
outstanding<00:04:04.850> technology<00:04:05.750> and<00:04:06.410> basically<00:04:06.799> I

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
outstanding technology and basically I

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.210 
outstanding technology and basically I
always<00:04:07.310> say<00:04:07.489> at<00:04:08.150> the<00:04:08.330> end<00:04:08.650> the<00:04:09.650> smartphone

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:10.220 
always say at the end the smartphone

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.309 
always say at the end the smartphone
design<00:04:10.610> is<00:04:10.880> about<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.540> creation<00:04:11.959> of<00:04:12.019> the<00:04:12.140> user

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:12.319 
design is about the creation of the user

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.800 
design is about the creation of the user
experience<00:04:12.739> and<00:04:13.130> out<00:04:13.670> send<00:04:13.970> units<00:04:14.360> view<00:04:14.599> so

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
experience and out send units view so
