to<00:00:53.960> make<00:00:54.199> this<00:00:54.440> origami<00:00:54.829> box<00:00:55.399> this<00:00:56.239> is<00:00:56.420> just

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:56.569 
to make this origami box this is just

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:59.049 
to make this origami box this is just
one<00:00:56.809> of<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.109> many<00:00:57.319> ways<00:00:57.530> to<00:00:57.949> do<00:00:58.190> this<00:00:58.219> the

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
one of the many ways to do this the

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.849 
one of the many ways to do this the
results<00:00:59.449> are<00:00:59.569> always<00:00:59.659> the<00:00:59.989> same

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
once you get those creases there then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:15.649 
once you get those creases there then

this<00:01:19.020> edge<00:01:19.289> down<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.909> center<00:01:21.360> I<00:01:23.240> want<00:01:24.240> to

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:24.329 
this edge down to the center I want to

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:26.419 
this edge down to the center I want to
make<00:01:24.509> this<00:01:24.750> fold<00:01:25.140> and<00:01:25.469> make<00:01:25.500> a<00:01:25.950> good<00:01:26.189> crease

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.680 
base of our box and we want to go ahead
and<00:02:50.670> turn<00:02:50.790> it<00:02:50.910> around<00:02:51.000> do<00:02:51.270> the<00:02:51.390> exact<00:02:51.660> same

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
and turn it around do the exact same

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:53.930 
and turn it around do the exact same
thing<00:02:52.140> on<00:02:52.260> this<00:02:52.380> side<00:02:52.620> again<00:02:52.800> pinching<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.730> the

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
thing on this side again pinching in the

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:59.510 
thing on this side again pinching in the
middle<00:02:54.210> here<00:02:57.620> allowing<00:02:58.620> it<00:02:58.740> to<00:02:58.770> come<00:02:59.040> up<00:02:59.250> and

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
middle here allowing it to come up and

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.150 
middle here allowing it to come up and
then<00:02:59.940> fold<00:03:00.360> down<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.840> pinch<00:03:01.440> at<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.620> top<00:03:01.920> as

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
then fold down and pinch at the top as

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:06.920 
then fold down and pinch at the top as
you<00:03:02.280> do<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:05.240> anyway<00:03:06.240> just<00:03:06.360> go<00:03:06.540> ahead<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.840> go

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
you do this anyway just go ahead and go

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.510 
you do this anyway just go ahead and go
around<00:03:06.990> and<00:03:07.410> make<00:03:07.620> sure<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.920> you<00:03:08.010> have<00:03:08.220> good

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
around and make sure that you have good

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.780 
around and make sure that you have good
solid<00:03:09.180> edges<00:03:09.660> here<00:03:10.200> at<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.680> base<00:03:10.890> giving<00:03:11.730> a

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
solid edges here at the base giving a

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.140 
solid edges here at the base giving a
little<00:03:12.000> pinch<00:03:12.270> for<00:03:12.390> each<00:03:12.600> of<00:03:12.750> these<00:03:12.900> sides<00:03:14.150> and

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
little pinch for each of these sides and

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.720 
little pinch for each of these sides and
generally<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.440> force<00:03:16.739> of<00:03:16.980> the<00:03:17.130> box<00:03:17.310> itself

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
generally the force of the box itself

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.910 
generally the force of the box itself
leaves<00:03:18.209> these<00:03:18.420> flaps<00:03:18.720> in<00:03:19.110> position<00:03:19.680> on<00:03:19.830> the

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
leaves these flaps in position on the

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.040 
leaves these flaps in position on the
bottom<00:03:20.250> if<00:03:20.610> you<00:03:21.000> find<00:03:21.420> they<00:03:21.570> move<00:03:21.750> too<00:03:22.020> much

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050 
bottom if you find they move too much

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.780 
bottom if you find they move too much
you<00:03:22.440> can<00:03:22.620> put<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:22.890> little<00:03:23.040> glue<00:03:23.250> on<00:03:23.400> them<00:03:23.580> to

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
you can put a little glue on them to

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:26.990 
you can put a little glue on them to
keep<00:03:23.940> them<00:03:24.150> secure<00:03:24.980> otherwise<00:03:25.980> that<00:03:26.370> is<00:03:26.670> our

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
keep them secure otherwise that is our

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.840 
keep them secure otherwise that is our
completed<00:03:27.540> project<00:03:28.380> for<00:03:28.530> today<00:03:28.770> a<00:03:28.980> very

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:29.850 
completed project for today a very

completed project for today a very
simple<00:03:30.390> origami<00:03:30.870> box<00:03:31.200> thanks<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.130> much<00:03:32.190> for

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
simple origami box thanks so much for

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.720 
simple origami box thanks so much for
watching<00:03:32.520> we'll<00:03:33.060> see<00:03:33.239> you<00:03:33.330> next<00:03:33.450> time
