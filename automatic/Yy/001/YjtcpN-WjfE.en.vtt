it's a note 3 and I have done both the

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.010 
it's a note 3 and I have done both the
devices<00:00:35.010> offer<00:00:35.460> and<00:00:36.090> I'll<00:00:36.300> be<00:00:36.450> turning<00:00:36.630> them

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
devices offer and I'll be turning them

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:46.000 
devices offer and I'll be turning them
both<00:00:37.260> on<00:00:38.030> at<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.180> same<00:00:39.420> time<00:00:40.579> so<00:00:41.579> let's<00:00:41.790> write

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:46.010 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.389 

as<00:00:47.010> you<00:00:47.789> can<00:00:48.059> see<00:00:48.390> both<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.410> devices<00:00:49.620> has<00:00:50.010> been

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
as you can see both the devices has been

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.850 
as you can see both the devices has been
turned<00:00:51.239> on<00:00:53.600> at<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> same<00:00:54.989> time<00:00:55.260> so<00:00:55.620> I'll<00:00:55.710> be

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
turned on at the same time so I'll be

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:04.270 
turned on at the same time so I'll be
seeing<00:00:55.890> which<00:00:56.309> one<00:00:56.640> what's<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.660> faster<00:01:02.449> as<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
seeing which one what's a faster as you

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:12.700 
seeing which one what's a faster as you
can<00:01:05.280> see<00:01:06.409> the<00:01:07.409> note<00:01:07.680> 3<00:01:07.979> beats<00:01:08.310> up<00:01:08.520> iphone<00:01:09.510> 5

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.950 

it's<00:01:13.710> obvious<00:01:14.189> that<00:01:14.220> note<00:01:14.610> 3<00:01:14.850> has<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:15.360> 3<00:01:15.570> gigs<00:01:15.780> of

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
it's obvious that note 3 has a 3 gigs of

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.340 
it's obvious that note 3 has a 3 gigs of
ram<00:01:16.200> and<00:01:16.439> it<00:01:17.159> just<00:01:17.549> is<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.450> fastest<00:01:18.930> android

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
ram and it just is the fastest android

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.310 
ram and it just is the fastest android
phone<00:01:19.710> out<00:01:19.950> there<00:01:20.280> so<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.299> just<00:01:21.570> beats<00:01:22.049> iphone

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
phone out there so it just beats iphone

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.770 
phone out there so it just beats iphone
5<00:01:22.860> in<00:01:23.009> the<00:01:23.100> putting<00:01:23.310> up<00:01:23.490> test<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:24.270> second<00:01:24.570> test

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
5 in the putting up test the second test

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.539 
5 in the putting up test the second test
that<00:01:24.960> i<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.140> be<00:01:25.200> doing<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.560> the<00:01:25.830> Geekbench<00:01:26.070> as

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
that i will be doing is the Geekbench as

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.420 
that i will be doing is the Geekbench as
you<00:01:26.939> know<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.240> i'll<00:01:27.960> be<00:01:28.500> just<00:01:28.680> launching<00:01:29.250> the

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you know that i'll be just launching the

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.100 
you know that i'll be just launching the
Geekbench<00:01:29.670> i<00:01:31.250> will<00:01:32.250> be<00:01:32.310> doing<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.670> Geekbench

Geekbench i will be doing the Geekbench

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.100 
Geekbench i will be doing the Geekbench
test<00:01:34.110> between<00:01:34.380> both<00:01:34.799> the<00:01:34.920> devices<00:01:35.130> so<00:01:39.110> here

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
test between both the devices so here
