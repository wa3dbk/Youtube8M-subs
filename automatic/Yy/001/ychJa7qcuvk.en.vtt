00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250 
video and in the halo reach beta will be

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:43.890 
video and in the halo reach beta will be
weapons<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.760> the<00:02:42.820> map<00:02:43.000> I<00:02:43.240> don't<00:02:43.810> necessarily

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
weapons on the map I don't necessarily

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.510 
weapons on the map I don't necessarily
like<00:02:44.260> that<00:02:44.530> design<00:02:44.830> anymore<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:45.400> know

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
like that design anymore you know

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.220 
like that design anymore you know
personally<00:02:46.150> that's<00:02:46.360> a<00:02:46.420> developer<00:02:46.900> like<00:02:47.110> I

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
personally that's a developer like I

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.020 
personally that's a developer like I
think<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.040> should<00:02:48.220> find<00:02:48.459> a<00:02:48.520> better<00:02:48.760> way<00:02:48.970> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
think you should find a better way to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:51.300 
think you should find a better way to
move<00:02:49.209> players<00:02:49.480> from<00:02:49.660> the<00:02:49.720> map<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.890> the<00:02:50.980> reason

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
move players from the map and the reason

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:52.949 
move players from the map and the reason
being<00:02:51.489> is<00:02:51.730> because<00:02:51.760> you<00:02:52.180> have<00:02:52.209> a<00:02:52.390> lot<00:02:52.750> of<00:02:52.780> a

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
being is because you have a lot of a

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:54.780 
being is because you have a lot of a
holes<00:02:53.200> out<00:02:53.410> there<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:53.860> don't<00:02:54.370> gonna<00:02:54.459> sort<00:02:54.700> of

still weapons on the map um there's some

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:24.420 
still weapons on the map um there's some
very<00:03:22.989> cool<00:03:23.260> additions<00:03:23.709> to<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:23.890> weapons<00:03:24.220> so

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
very cool additions to the weapons so

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:26.580 
very cool additions to the weapons so
there<00:03:24.640> was<00:03:24.730> a<00:03:25.150> weapon<00:03:25.420> at<00:03:25.510> that's<00:03:26.019> a<00:03:26.080> covenant

there was a weapon at that's a covenant

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.780 
there was a weapon at that's a covenant
but<00:03:26.769> it<00:03:26.890> looks<00:03:27.130> like<00:03:27.190> it<00:03:27.370> behaves<00:03:27.640> very

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
but it looks like it behaves very

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:31.880 
but it looks like it behaves very
similar<00:03:28.209> to<00:03:28.239> the<00:03:28.360> missile<00:03:28.720> pod<00:03:30.630> but<00:03:31.630> um

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:31.890 
similar to the missile pod but um

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.810 
similar to the missile pod but um
neither<00:03:32.890> rifle<00:03:33.280> looks<00:03:33.430> like<00:03:33.549> it<00:03:33.700> may<00:03:33.790> have

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:33.820 
neither rifle looks like it may have

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.100 
neither rifle looks like it may have
replaced<00:03:34.239> the<00:03:34.390> carbine<00:03:34.810> I'm<00:03:34.959> not<00:03:35.080> sure<00:03:35.230> and<00:03:35.970> on

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
replaced the carbine I'm not sure and on

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.690 
replaced the carbine I'm not sure and on
the<00:03:38.110> new<00:03:38.260> DMR<00:03:38.739> looks<00:03:39.040> like<00:03:39.160> looks<00:03:39.459> like<00:03:39.640> is

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
the new DMR looks like looks like is

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.000 
the new DMR looks like looks like is
going<00:03:39.730> to<00:03:39.880> replace<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.269> VR<00:03:40.600> which<00:03:41.560> is<00:03:41.680> finally

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:42.010 
going to replace the VR which is finally

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:43.440 
going to replace the VR which is finally
me<00:03:42.190> they<00:03:42.730> got<00:03:42.880> rid<00:03:42.970> of<00:03:43.030> the<00:03:43.120> headshot

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
me they got rid of the headshot

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.000 
me they got rid of the headshot
indicator<00:03:43.870> which<00:03:44.079> means<00:03:44.320> probably<00:03:44.410> less<00:03:44.739> auto

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
indicator which means probably less auto

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:46.440 
indicator which means probably less auto
lane<00:03:45.280> which<00:03:45.519> is<00:03:45.640> also<00:03:45.820> okay<00:03:46.120> with<00:03:46.239> me<00:03:46.299> because

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
lane which is also okay with me because

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:48.420 
lane which is also okay with me because
I<00:03:46.600> can<00:03:46.750> eyeball<00:03:46.900> the<00:03:47.200> headshot<00:03:47.560> often<00:03:48.280> playing

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:48.430 
I can eyeball the headshot often playing

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:51.360 
I can eyeball the headshot often playing
shooters<00:03:48.700> for<00:03:48.820> a<00:03:48.880> very<00:03:49.090> long<00:03:49.269> time<00:03:49.329> um<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:51.310> I

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
shooters for a very long time um and I

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.640 
shooters for a very long time um and I
think<00:03:51.610> it<00:03:51.700> sort<00:03:51.820> of<00:03:51.880> takes<00:03:52.060> a<00:03:52.180> little<00:03:52.530> adds<00:03:53.530> a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:53.650 
think it sort of takes a little adds a

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:54.750 
think it sort of takes a little adds a
little<00:03:53.709> bit<00:03:53.829> a<00:03:53.920> little<00:03:54.040> bit<00:03:54.220> of<00:03:54.310> an<00:03:54.459> element<00:03:54.640> of

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 
little bit a little bit of an element of

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.530 
little bit a little bit of an element of
skill<00:03:55.060> to<00:03:55.239> the<00:03:55.329> game<00:03:55.480> um<00:03:57.000> but<00:03:58.000> essentially<00:03:58.510> I

00:03:58.530 --> 00:03:58.540 
skill to the game um but essentially I

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.729 
skill to the game um but essentially I
mean<00:03:58.690> that's<00:03:58.750> it<00:03:58.959> the<00:03:59.019> graphics<00:03:59.200> look<00:03:59.470> great<00:03:59.709> I

00:03:59.729 --> 00:03:59.739 
mean that's it the graphics look great I

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.530 
mean that's it the graphics look great I
want<00:03:59.890> a<00:04:00.220> final<00:04:00.579> player<00:04:00.760> count<00:04:01.030> so<00:04:01.299> looking

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:05.890 
customizable spawn points I think this

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.550 
customizable spawn points I think this
is<00:04:05.950> almost<00:04:06.280> like<00:04:06.400> a<00:04:06.610> must<00:04:06.970> Oh<00:04:07.329> in<00:04:08.110> pursuit<00:04:08.470> errs
