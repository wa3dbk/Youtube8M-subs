hey<00:00:03.419> guys<00:00:03.659> so<00:00:03.990> here's<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.259> move<00:00:04.529> that<00:00:04.770> many<00:00:05.040> of

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
hey guys so here's a move that many of

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.920 
hey guys so here's a move that many of
you<00:00:05.339> have<00:00:05.460> heard<00:00:05.670> of<00:00:05.879> it's<00:00:06.330> called<00:00:06.660> the

00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:06.930 
you have heard of it's called the

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.259 
you have heard of it's called the
rainbow<00:00:07.470> and<00:00:07.680> it's<00:00:07.830> not<00:00:08.160> that<00:00:08.490> difficult<00:00:08.550> to

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
rainbow and it's not that difficult to

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:12.320 
rainbow and it's not that difficult to
learn<00:00:09.599> let's<00:00:10.349> break<00:00:10.650> it<00:00:10.800> down<00:00:10.880> so<00:00:11.880> the<00:00:11.910> first

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
learn let's break it down so the first

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.530 
learn let's break it down so the first
step<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:13.070> locking<00:00:14.070> the<00:00:14.099> ball<00:00:14.400> between<00:00:14.820> your

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
step is locking the ball between your

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.220 
step is locking the ball between your
two<00:00:15.990> feet<00:00:16.770> you<00:00:17.340> want<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.760> ball<00:00:18.000> pressed<00:00:18.960> up

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
two feet you want the ball pressed up

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.470 
two feet you want the ball pressed up
against<00:00:19.800> the<00:00:19.920> ankle<00:00:20.520> or<00:00:20.670> actually<00:00:21.000> the<00:00:21.119> heel

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
against the ankle or actually the heel

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.439 
against the ankle or actually the heel
of<00:00:21.720> your<00:00:22.010> standing<00:00:23.010> foot<00:00:23.310> and<00:00:23.580> you<00:00:24.119> want<00:00:24.300> your

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.390 
of your standing foot and you want your
other<00:00:24.630> foot<00:00:24.990> pressed<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.800> against<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.220> back

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
other foot pressed up against the back

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.700 
other foot pressed up against the back
of<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.699> ball<00:00:26.880> at<00:00:27.150> an<00:00:27.599> angle<00:00:27.990> so<00:00:28.230> this<00:00:28.410> is<00:00:28.560> your

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
actual trick in the actual motion after

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.910 
actual trick in the actual motion after
you've<00:01:06.390> rolled<00:01:06.630> it<00:01:06.810> up<00:01:06.960> onto<00:01:07.200> your<00:01:07.470> ankle<00:01:07.799> you

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
you've rolled it up onto your ankle you

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.190 
you've rolled it up onto your ankle you
want<00:01:08.100> to<00:01:08.189> pop<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.790> ball<00:01:08.939> up<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.390> your<00:01:09.630> heel

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
want to pop the ball up with your heel

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.469 
want to pop the ball up with your heel
while<00:01:11.189> leaning<00:01:11.580> forward<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.150> lean

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
while leaning forward so you lean

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.929 
while leaning forward so you lean
forward<00:01:12.510> while<00:01:13.140> you<00:01:13.290> do<00:01:13.439> it<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.770> pop<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.729> ball

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939

forward while you do it and pop the ball
up<00:01:14.970> with<00:01:15.150> your<00:01:15.330> heel<00:01:19.280> remember<00:01:20.280> what<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.520> just

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
up with your heel remember what I just

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.570 
up with your heel remember what I just
showed<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.330> slowed<00:01:22.130> version<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.400> it

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
showed you is a slowed version of it

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.490 
showed you is a slowed version of it
when<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:23.820> actually<00:01:24.119> do<00:01:24.810> this<00:01:24.960> trick<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.470> you

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
when I actually do this trick like you

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.590 
when I actually do this trick like you
saw<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> beginning<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> video<00:01:26.759> I'll

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
saw in the beginning of the video I'll

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.300 
saw in the beginning of the video I'll
show<00:01:27.840> you<00:01:27.900> another<00:01:28.110> me<00:01:28.590> doing<00:01:28.829> it<00:01:28.920> again<00:01:29.130> after

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
show you another me doing it again after

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.160 
show you another me doing it again after
I<00:01:29.490> speak<00:01:29.790> here<00:01:30.060> but<00:01:30.540> you'll<00:01:30.659> see<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:30.869> it's

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
I speak here but you'll see that it's

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.780 
I speak here but you'll see that it's
much<00:01:31.380> quicker<00:01:31.680> I'm<00:01:31.950> not<00:01:32.100> deliberately

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
much quicker I'm not deliberately

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.819 
much quicker I'm not deliberately
wedging<00:01:33.750> the<00:01:33.840> ball<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> then<00:01:34.350> rolling<00:01:34.680> it<00:01:34.770> up

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
wedging the ball and then rolling it up

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.649 
wedging the ball and then rolling it up
slowly<00:01:35.159> I'm<00:01:35.430> doing<00:01:35.670> it<00:01:35.759> all<00:01:35.909> in<00:01:35.939> almost<00:01:36.329> one

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
slowly I'm doing it all in almost one

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
slowly I'm doing it all in almost one
motion<00:01:36.900> which<00:01:37.560> actually<00:01:37.920> makes<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.189> easier<00:01:38.310> if

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
motion which actually makes it easier if

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.940 
motion which actually makes it easier if
you<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.850> it<00:01:38.880> slower<00:01:39.409> it<00:01:40.409> becomes<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.829> little

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
you do it slower it becomes a little

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.370 
you do it slower it becomes a little
more<00:01:41.040> difficult<00:01:41.189> because<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.509> speed<00:01:42.840> helps

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
more difficult because the speed helps

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.350 
more difficult because the speed helps
them<00:01:43.619> move<00:01:43.770> out<00:01:43.979> so<00:01:44.549> remember<00:01:44.939> that<00:01:44.970> you<00:01:45.180> want

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
them move out so remember that you want

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.539 
them move out so remember that you want
to<00:01:45.420> do<00:01:45.509> it<00:01:45.630> a<00:01:45.689> little<00:01:45.780> more<00:01:46.409> quickly<00:01:46.710> than<00:01:47.369> the

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to do it a little more quickly than the

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.260 
to do it a little more quickly than the
slow<00:01:47.850> down<00:01:48.090> process<00:01:48.810> I've<00:01:49.110> shown<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.380> here

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:52.270 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.570 

well<00:01:53.270> guys<00:01:53.480> that's<00:01:53.690> how<00:01:53.780> you<00:01:53.840> do<00:01:54.050> the<00:01:54.170> rainbow

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
well guys that's how you do the rainbow

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:56.770 
well guys that's how you do the rainbow
step-by-step<00:01:55.580> now<00:01:55.850> what<00:01:56.030> I<00:01:56.060> want<00:01:56.360> you<00:01:56.480> to<00:01:56.600> do
