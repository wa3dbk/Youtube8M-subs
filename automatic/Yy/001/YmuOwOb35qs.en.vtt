first device in a long time that doesn't
have<00:00:45.539> any<00:00:45.719> major<00:00:45.899> flaws<00:00:46.440> that<00:00:46.469> obviously<00:00:47.250> hold

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
have any major flaws that obviously hold

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.069 
have any major flaws that obviously hold
it<00:00:47.760> back<00:00:47.940> now<00:00:48.210> it's<00:00:48.360> not<00:00:48.480> like<00:00:48.629> every<00:00:48.870> device

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that's ever come out has had a major

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.490 
that's ever come out has had a major
flaw<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.210> there<00:00:51.329> are<00:00:51.420> some<00:00:51.570> almost<00:00:51.960> perfect

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
flaw but there are some almost perfect

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.869 
flaw but there are some almost perfect
devices<00:00:52.920> out<00:00:53.070> there<00:00:53.250> right<00:00:53.430> now<00:00:53.460> for<00:00:53.820> example

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
devices out there right now for example

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.479 
devices out there right now for example
the<00:00:54.210> HTC<00:00:54.780> One<00:00:54.989> it's<00:00:55.379> an<00:00:55.440> amazing<00:00:56.010> device<00:00:56.219> and

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the HTC One it's an amazing device and

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:57.799 
the HTC One it's an amazing device and
it's<00:00:56.579> really<00:00:56.820> good<00:00:57.000> in<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.149> lot<00:00:57.180> of<00:00:57.329> ways<00:00:57.600> it's

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
it's really good in a lot of ways it's

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.330 
it's really good in a lot of ways it's
almost<00:00:57.930> perfect<00:00:58.559> but<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:58.949> feel<00:00:59.100> like<00:00:59.219> that

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
almost perfect but I feel like that

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:01.130 
almost perfect but I feel like that
battery<00:00:59.760> life<00:00:59.910> has<00:01:00.120> held<00:01:00.300> it<00:01:00.449> back<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.930> me

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
battery life has held it back for me

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.810 
battery life has held it back for me
and<00:01:01.230> then<00:01:01.469> there's<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.680> galaxy<00:01:01.920> s4<00:01:02.309> again<00:01:02.699> an

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
and then there's a galaxy s4 again an

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.299 
and then there's a galaxy s4 again an
impressive<00:01:03.510> device<00:01:03.780> in<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.110> lot<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.350> ways<00:01:04.650> but

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
impressive device in a lot of ways but

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.980 
impressive device in a lot of ways but
you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.670> TouchWiz<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.210> held<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.810> and

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
you know TouchWiz has held it back and

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.359 
you know TouchWiz has held it back and
the<00:01:07.049> build<00:01:07.290> quality<00:01:07.350> has<00:01:07.860> really<00:01:08.159> been<00:01:08.340> a

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
the build quality has really been a

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.550 
the build quality has really been a
problem<00:01:08.670> for<00:01:09.030> me<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.390> even<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.049> Nexus<00:01:10.320> 4<00:01:10.530> is

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
problem for me and even the Nexus 4 is

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:12.500 
problem for me and even the Nexus 4 is
another<00:01:10.979> awesome<00:01:11.490> example<00:01:11.909> of<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.030> great<00:01:12.240> phone

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
another awesome example of a great phone

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.710 
another awesome example of a great phone
but<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.320> know<00:01:13.439> how<00:01:13.619> not<00:01:13.860> havin<00:01:14.159> LTE<00:01:14.460> is<00:01:14.820> also<00:01:15.390> a

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
but you know how not havin LTE is also a

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.780 
but you know how not havin LTE is also a
pretty<00:01:16.229> big<00:01:16.470> downside<00:01:17.040> so<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.280> feel<00:01:17.520> like<00:01:17.549> the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
pretty big downside so I feel like the

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.330 
pretty big downside so I feel like the
no.3<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.900> all<00:01:19.049> the<00:01:19.170> expectations<00:01:20.070> we<00:01:20.310> have

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
for it with all the things that we are

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.620 
for it with all the things that we are
expecting<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.830> get<00:01:22.950> out<00:01:23.130> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> phone<00:01:23.630> might

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630

I'll be using CyanogenMod a lot of

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.440 
I'll be using CyanogenMod a lot of
people<00:03:10.739> will<00:03:10.830> also<00:03:11.100> realize<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.520> since<00:03:12.270> it's

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
people will also realize that since it's

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.360 
people will also realize that since it's
a<00:03:12.570> Galaxy<00:03:13.020> Note<00:03:13.170> 3<00:03:13.200> we're<00:03:13.620> talking<00:03:13.890> about<00:03:13.980> here

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
a Galaxy Note 3 we're talking about here

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.490 
a Galaxy Note 3 we're talking about here
there's<00:03:14.790> also<00:03:15.000> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.330> be<00:03:15.450> a<00:03:15.480> stylus<00:03:16.230> just

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:16.500 
there's also going to be a stylus just

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:18.860 
there's also going to be a stylus just
like<00:03:16.620> all<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:16.950> other<00:03:17.100> galaxy<00:03:17.580> notes<00:03:17.790> and<00:03:18.120> I'm

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
like all the other galaxy notes and I'm

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.570 
like all the other galaxy notes and I'm
thinking<00:03:19.290> that<00:03:19.470> unless<00:03:19.830> there<00:03:20.100> are<00:03:20.280> some

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 
thinking that unless there are some

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.729 
thinking that unless there are some
really<00:03:21.060> impressive<00:03:21.540> things<00:03:22.110> going<00:03:22.410> on<00:03:22.530> with

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
really impressive things going on with

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:24.890 
really impressive things going on with
that<00:03:22.860> stylus<00:03:23.370> that<00:03:23.400> require<00:03:24.000> TouchWiz<00:03:24.660> I

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
that stylus that require TouchWiz I

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:26.810 
that stylus that require TouchWiz I
won't<00:03:25.890> even<00:03:26.040> give<00:03:26.160> it<00:03:26.220> a<00:03:26.250> chance<00:03:26.519> I'll

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
won't even give it a chance I'll

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.310 
won't even give it a chance I'll
probably<00:03:27.030> go<00:03:27.239> straight<00:03:27.299> to<00:03:27.600> cyan<00:03:27.810> gin<00:03:28.049> my<00:03:28.170> when

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:28.320 
probably go straight to cyan gin my when

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.570 
probably go straight to cyan gin my when
it's<00:03:28.440> available<00:03:28.560> next<00:03:29.070> we're<00:03:29.190> expecting
