I believe that's trying to like imitate

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.670 
I believe that's trying to like imitate
the<00:03:22.739> determine<00:03:23.609> winds<00:03:23.820> or<00:03:24.180> something<00:03:24.680> you

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:25.680 
the determine winds or something you

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.199 
the determine winds or something you
know<00:03:25.769> that<00:03:25.829> will<00:03:26.310> make<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.579> a<00:03:26.609> cent<00:03:26.910> but

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
know that will make you a cent but

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.620 
know that will make you a cent but
they're<00:03:28.200> not<00:03:28.260> really<00:03:28.500> doing<00:03:28.680> as<00:03:28.829> well<00:03:29.010> it<00:03:29.730> then

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630
