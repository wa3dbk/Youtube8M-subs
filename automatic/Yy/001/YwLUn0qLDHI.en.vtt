this<00:00:30.400> is<00:00:30.580> boiler

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:39.050 

so<00:00:34.950> when<00:00:35.070> the<00:00:35.190> door<00:00:35.400> opens<00:00:37.670> this<00:00:38.670> pack

so when the door opens this pack
releases<00:00:39.600> it<00:00:40.430> releases<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.670> Sun<00:00:41.880> would<00:00:42.440> open

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
releases it releases the Sun would open

be the inner plate that running up the
crowd<00:00:48.480> silhouette<00:00:49.200> oh<00:00:50.420> yeah<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:51.809> that<00:00:51.960> would

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:52.080 
crowd silhouette oh yeah so that would

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.580 
crowd silhouette oh yeah so that would
store<00:00:52.320> yeah<00:00:53.600> that's<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.720> family<00:00:54.900> thing<00:00:55.200> shuts

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
store yeah that's the family thing shuts

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.880 
store yeah that's the family thing shuts
that<00:00:55.830> one<00:00:55.980> off

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
that one off

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:23.000 
that one off
yeah<00:00:59.010> gosh<00:00:59.310> to<00:00:59.580> go<00:00:59.700> around<00:00:59.970> the<00:01:00.120> back

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:23.010 

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:30.000 

well<00:01:24.010> we<00:01:24.130> just<00:01:24.159> work<00:01:24.520> in<00:01:24.700> steel<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.869> steel<00:01:29.010> so

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
well we just work in steel just steel so

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.999 
well we just work in steel just steel so
it's<00:01:30.700> more<00:01:31.150> labor-intensive<00:01:31.600> but<00:01:32.530> we'd<00:01:32.740> like

00:01:32.999 --> 00:01:33.009 
it's more labor-intensive but we'd like

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:35.609 
it's more labor-intensive but we'd like
the<00:01:33.220> steel<00:01:33.549> so<00:01:34.180> good<00:01:34.390> heavy<00:01:34.630> gauges<00:01:35.140> of<00:01:35.290> steel

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:35.619 
the steel so good heavy gauges of steel

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:37.920 
the steel so good heavy gauges of steel
but<00:01:36.190> we<00:01:36.369> have<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.820> keep<00:01:36.970> the<00:01:37.090> details<00:01:37.270> simple

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:37.930 
but we have to keep the details simple

00:01:37.930 --> 00:02:13.589 
but we have to keep the details simple
to<00:01:38.770> make<00:01:38.920> the<00:01:39.040> stones<00:01:39.340> economical<00:01:39.970> to<00:01:40.060> build

00:02:13.589 --> 00:02:13.599 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:15.929 

we<00:02:14.290> get<00:02:14.439> the<00:02:14.560> heat<00:02:14.709> out<00:02:14.890> really<00:02:15.280> fast<00:02:15.640> through

00:02:15.929 --> 00:02:15.939 
we get the heat out really fast through

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.899 
we get the heat out really fast through
these<00:02:16.180> stoves<00:02:16.480> there's<00:02:16.840> no<00:02:16.959> fabric<00:02:17.620> lining<00:02:18.549> or

00:02:18.899 --> 00:02:18.909 
these stoves there's no fabric lining or

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:20.729 
these stoves there's no fabric lining or
sacrificial<00:02:19.629> places<00:02:20.170> learning<00:02:20.680> the

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:20.739 
sacrificial places learning the

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:23.399 
sacrificial places learning the
transmission<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.489> heat<00:02:21.959> which<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.109> leave<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.399 --> 00:02:23.409 
transmission of heat which you leave the

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:30.860 
transmission of heat which you leave the
stones<00:02:23.709> get<00:02:24.040> hot<00:02:24.280> fast<00:02:24.670> most<00:02:25.269> of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.569> stones

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:39.059 

so<00:02:31.870> what<00:02:32.049> it<00:02:32.140> is<00:02:37.200> are<00:02:38.200> we<00:02:38.349> doing<00:02:38.650> about<00:02:38.709> any

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:39.069 
so what it is are we doing about any

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.149 
so what it is are we doing about any
internal<00:02:39.579> battles<00:02:39.959> it's<00:02:40.959> the<00:02:41.349> shape<00:02:41.739> of<00:02:41.980> all

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
internal battles it's the shape of all

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:58.710 
internal battles it's the shape of all
the<00:02:42.310> world

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.680 

the<00:02:59.260> human<00:02:59.650> being<00:02:59.890> is<00:03:00.040> our<00:03:00.280> main<00:03:00.460> tune<00:03:00.820> the

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:01.690 
the human being is our main tune the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.290 
the human being is our main tune the
hands<00:03:02.200> right<00:03:02.650> there<00:03:02.680> compared<00:03:03.460> to<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.060> pair

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:04.300 
hands right there compared to the pair

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:26.200 
hands right there compared to the pair
of<00:03:04.330> hands

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:26.210 

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.850 

probably<00:03:27.210> fitted<00:03:27.510> over<00:03:27.720> half<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.110> soap<00:03:28.410> right

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
probably fitted over half the soap right

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.700 
probably fitted over half the soap right
in<00:03:29.190> the<00:03:29.310> last<00:03:29.490> 25<00:03:30.060> years<00:03:30.200> which<00:03:31.200> gives<00:03:31.470> us<00:03:31.560> a

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
in the last 25 years which gives us a

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.060 
in the last 25 years which gives us a
very<00:03:31.950> intimate<00:03:32.420> experience<00:03:33.830> of<00:03:34.830> how<00:03:35.040> the

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
very intimate experience of how the

00:03:35.070 --> 00:04:27.309 
very intimate experience of how the
stone<00:03:35.630> fits<00:03:36.630> into<00:03:36.960> the<00:03:37.080> house

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:27.319 

00:04:27.319 --> 00:04:30.610 

handmade<00:04:28.870> because<00:04:29.870> that's<00:04:30.199> the<00:04:30.319> way<00:04:30.440> we've

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:30.620 
handmade because that's the way we've

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:32.320 
handmade because that's the way we've
always<00:04:30.740> done<00:04:30.949> them<00:04:31.340> there<00:04:31.759> are<00:04:31.910> advantages

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
always done them there are advantages

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:35.010 
always done them there are advantages
and<00:04:33.080> making<00:04:33.440> them<00:04:33.560> by<00:04:33.740> hand<00:04:33.949> on<00:04:34.190> a<00:04:34.310> small<00:04:34.580> scale

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:35.020 
and making them by hand on a small scale

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.809 
and making them by hand on a small scale
again<00:04:36.020> this<00:04:36.229> is<00:04:36.380> an<00:04:36.530> aspect<00:04:36.919> of<00:04:37.099> just<00:04:37.400> working

00:04:37.809 --> 00:04:37.819 
again this is an aspect of just working

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:40.990 
again this is an aspect of just working
in<00:04:37.910> steel<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:39.830> it's<00:04:40.009> it's<00:04:40.849> a

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:41.000 
in steel that it's it's a

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.820 
in steel that it's it's a
labor-intensive<00:04:41.360> it's<00:04:42.050> also<00:04:42.229> skill

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:42.830 
labor-intensive it's also skill

00:04:42.830 --> 00:05:00.339 
labor-intensive it's also skill
intensive<00:04:56.889> it's<00:04:57.889> just<00:04:58.130> steel<00:04:58.460> on<00:04:58.639> steel<00:04:59.349> so

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:00.349 
intensive it's just steel on steel so

00:05:00.349 --> 00:05:02.620 
intensive it's just steel on steel so
our<00:05:00.530> stoves<00:05:00.860> will<00:05:01.130> seal<00:05:01.370> as<00:05:01.520> well<00:05:01.729> in<00:05:01.909> 2025

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:02.630 
our stoves will seal as well in 2025

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:05.620 
our stoves will seal as well in 2025
years<00:05:02.870> so<00:05:03.110> they<00:05:03.259> do<00:05:03.440> from<00:05:03.740> day<00:05:03.949> one<00:05:04.360> nothing<00:05:05.360> to

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
years so they do from day one nothing to

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:08.140 
years so they do from day one nothing to
replace<00:05:05.870> on<00:05:06.380> the<00:05:06.740> stove<00:05:07.069> unless<00:05:07.789> you<00:05:07.940> break

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
replace on the stove unless you break

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.960 
replace on the stove unless you break
the<00:05:08.270> glass<00:05:08.300> panel
