but<00:00:43.280> most<00:00:43.520> interestingly<00:00:43.790> is<00:00:44.570> all<00:00:44.990> that<00:00:45.200> power

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:45.470 
but most interestingly is all that power

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.920 
but most interestingly is all that power
comes<00:00:46.400> down<00:00:46.670> via<00:00:47.000> just<00:00:47.360> the<00:00:47.450> front<00:00:47.690> wheels

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:47.930 
comes down via just the front wheels

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.140 
comes down via just the front wheels
which<00:00:48.680> should<00:00:48.980> make<00:00:49.490> it<00:00:49.700> a<00:00:49.730> really

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:50.150 
which should make it a really

00:00:50.150 --> 00:01:13.389 
which should make it a really
interesting<00:00:50.480> drive

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:13.399
