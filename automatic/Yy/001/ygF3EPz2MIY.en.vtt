00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
go through the frame rails to an upper

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.369 
go through the frame rails to an upper
part<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.059> cradle<00:00:51.390> which<00:00:51.510> is<00:00:51.660> a<00:00:51.690> welded<00:00:52.230> in

part of the cradle which is a welded in
steel<00:00:52.850> platform<00:00:53.850> and<00:00:54.090> then<00:00:54.690> an<00:00:54.960> aluminum

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
steel platform and then an aluminum

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.220 
steel platform and then an aluminum
piece<00:00:56.250> that<00:00:56.640> mounts<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.210> upper<00:00:57.570> control<00:00:57.899> arm

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
piece that mounts the upper control arm

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.380 
piece that mounts the upper control arm
that<00:00:58.620> has<00:00:58.859> this<00:00:59.250> very<00:00:59.820> very<00:01:00.210> amazingly<00:01:01.079> cool

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:02.390 
that has this very very amazingly cool

that has this very very amazingly cool
adjustable<00:01:03.390> program<00:01:03.870> where<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.140> can<00:01:04.290> loosen

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
adjustable program where you can loosen

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.429 
adjustable program where you can loosen
a<00:01:04.710> bolt<00:01:05.090> rotate<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.360> basically<00:01:07.170> it<00:01:07.320> looks

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
a bolt rotate that basically it looks

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.859 
a bolt rotate that basically it looks
like<00:01:07.619> a<00:01:07.710> star<00:01:08.010> instead<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.549> teeth<00:01:08.820> and<00:01:09.090> lock<00:01:09.689> it

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
like a star instead of teeth and lock it

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:10.990 
like a star instead of teeth and lock it
down<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.260> you<00:01:10.290> could<00:01:10.530> have<00:01:10.680> multiple

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:11.000 
down so you could have multiple

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:14.000 
down so you could have multiple
suspension<00:01:12.000> settings<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.630> your<00:01:13.229> your<00:01:13.590> track

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
suspension settings like your your track

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.160 
suspension settings like your your track
