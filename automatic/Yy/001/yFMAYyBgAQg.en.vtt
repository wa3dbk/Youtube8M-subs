00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:49.950 
you're traveling around so you don't get

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:52.339 
you're traveling around so you don't get

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
dehydrated and then also on the side we

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.920 
dehydrated and then also on the side we
see<00:02:52.560> another<00:02:53.010> additional<00:02:53.670> pocket<00:02:54.180> now<00:02:54.720> this

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
see another additional pocket now this

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:56.660 
see another additional pocket now this
pocket<00:02:55.140> looks<00:02:55.470> like<00:02:55.530> it<00:02:55.769> has<00:02:55.950> some<00:02:56.549> water

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
pocket looks like it has some water

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.160 
pocket looks like it has some water
protection<00:02:57.209> inside<00:02:57.360> of<00:02:57.630> it<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:57.930> might<00:02:58.110> be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
protection inside of it so it might be

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.710 
protection inside of it so it might be
water<00:02:58.440> resistant<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.220> this<00:03:00.030> matches<00:03:00.269> up<00:03:00.569> on

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
water resistant and this matches up on

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.390 
water resistant and this matches up on
both<00:03:00.900> sides<00:03:01.200> so<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:01.680> see<00:03:01.920> it<00:03:02.040> here<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:02.280> this

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
both sides so you see it here on this

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.309 
both sides so you see it here on this
side<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.849> then<00:03:03.390> you<00:03:03.480> spin<00:03:03.720> around<00:03:03.870> you<00:03:04.110> see

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319 
side and then you spin around you see

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:06.020 
side and then you spin around you see
the<00:03:04.440> same<00:03:04.620> exact<00:03:05.010> side<00:03:05.220> mimicked<00:03:05.640> on<00:03:05.730> the

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
the same exact side mimicked on the

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.670 
the same exact side mimicked on the
other<00:03:06.180> side<00:03:07.250> this<00:03:08.250> thing's<00:03:08.489> very<00:03:08.910> big<00:03:09.680> very

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
other side this thing's very big very

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.610 
other side this thing's very big very
