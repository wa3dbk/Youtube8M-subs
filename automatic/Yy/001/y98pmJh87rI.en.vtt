both the dominant so see the e FG son G

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.429 
both the dominant so see the e FG son G
and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.140> play<00:01:55.350> an<00:01:55.649> optional<00:01:56.100> arpeggio<00:01:56.700> g<00:01:57.439> PG

/<00:01:58.680> T<00:01:59.100> major<00:01:59.340> chord<00:01:59.670> with<00:02:00.630> an<00:02:00.899> F<00:02:01.079> natural<00:02:01.409> in<00:02:01.979> it

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
/ T major chord with an F natural in it

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.679 
/ T major chord with an F natural in it
so<00:02:03.299> if<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.570> remember<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.560> G<00:02:04.799> major<00:02:05.070> chord<00:02:05.759> you

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
so if you remember the G major chord you

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:09.589 
so if you remember the G major chord you
make<00:02:06.840> your<00:02:07.020> own<00:02:07.049> scale<00:02:07.950> at<00:02:08.459> F<00:02:08.759> sharp<00:02:09.090> no<00:02:09.300> didn't

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
make your own scale at F sharp no didn't

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.100 
make your own scale at F sharp no didn't
it<00:02:09.660> but<00:02:09.810> what<00:02:09.899> we're<00:02:10.050> doing<00:02:10.080> is<00:02:10.349> with

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
it but what we're doing is with

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.710 
it but what we're doing is with
turning<00:02:11.380> seven<00:02:12.220> so<00:02:12.370> taking<00:02:12.790> that<00:02:12.820> F<00:02:13.060> sharp<00:02:13.090> and

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
turning seven so taking that F sharp and

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.120 
turning seven so taking that F sharp and
turning<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.080> internet<00:02:14.320> and<00:02:14.620> Apple

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
turning the internet and Apple

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:26.670 
turning the internet and Apple
so<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.550> have<00:02:15.730> G<00:02:16.030> B<00:02:16.780> D<00:02:17.080> F<00:02:17.830> natural<00:02:25.410> you<00:02:26.410> can<00:02:26.470> go

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
so we have G B D F natural you can go

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:34.440 
so we have G B D F natural you can go
higher<00:02:26.980> pause<00:02:27.280> down<00:02:27.580> as<00:02:27.730> you<00:02:27.850> like<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:34.300> ding

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:34.450 
higher pause down as you like the ding

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:35.910 
higher pause down as you like the ding
sound<00:02:34.630> quite<00:02:34.870> blue<00:02:35.110> easier<00:02:35.320> to<00:02:35.590> Domino

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
sound quite blue easier to Domino

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.790 
sound quite blue easier to Domino
sentence<00:02:39.780> it's<00:02:40.780> you<00:02:41.110> know<00:02:41.290> he's<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:41.560> center

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
sentence it's you know he's the center

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:43.440 
sentence it's you know he's the center
of<00:02:42.010> your<00:02:42.310> blue<00:02:42.490> scale<00:02:42.670> as<00:02:42.940> well<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.270> that's

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:43.450 
of your blue scale as well so that's

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.330 
of your blue scale as well so that's
