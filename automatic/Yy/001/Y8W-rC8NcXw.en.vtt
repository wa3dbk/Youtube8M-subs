 Avoid these pollutants 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.580

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:09.710
 is she rehearsing me on the way? 

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:11.690
 but they are also analyzed behind 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140
 above the same day analyzed 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.520
 become 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.520
