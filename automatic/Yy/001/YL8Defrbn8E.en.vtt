00:02:40.949 --> 00:02:40.959 
think of my life is first that is this

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:44.069 
think of my life is first that is this
whole<00:02:41.140> Maori<00:02:41.709> inning<00:02:42.129> and<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.299> that's<00:02:43.900> about

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
whole Maori inning and and that's about

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.330 
whole Maori inning and and that's about
it<00:02:44.970> what<00:02:45.970> instead<00:02:46.209> you<00:02:46.329> Vinnie<00:02:46.629> oh<00:02:47.160> one<00:02:48.160> of<00:02:48.280> the

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
it what instead you Vinnie oh one of the

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.580 
it what instead you Vinnie oh one of the
beste<00:02:48.780> definitely<00:02:49.780> up<00:02:49.930> there<00:02:49.959> with<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.440> best

now I reckon it would be a whole lot

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.920 
now I reckon it would be a whole lot
better<00:02:53.440> if<00:02:53.650> it<00:02:53.769> was<00:02:53.920> filled<00:02:54.190> with<00:02:54.930> 70,000

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:55.930

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
people all shouting my name and maybe it

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.940
