00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:13.800
 Dad, what are you doing 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:17.820
 i believe the catacombs of 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:21.119
 kingdom means and what should that of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 Do you think that's where I am? 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.290
 meaningless fuller black nothing 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.130
 built and write them by force 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.130
 connected 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.610
 you can be proud of your old one 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.989
 his 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:49.580
 it brings with it time my child 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:53.129
 time to unpack the snowman 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.440
 hello and the faceless speaks 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.269
 back to you yes I wanted something 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.070
 think twice because hello and 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.960
 welcome to frumpy 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.479
 we are in the catacombs of 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.030
 ascalon and here there is a no easter 

00:01:03.479 --> 00:01:08.130
 Egg, so to speak , I believe it is a part 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.799
 the thus not quite as done purely 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.619
 has and that is in the bus at the end 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.360
 room from 2 from the first and third way 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:18.149
 not from the second so with the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.590
 azzurra or with the people and man 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.539
 the stairs go up and then 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.430
 you are in front of a wall full of ev but 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:25.079
 You can actually go through there 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.320
 as a non-through-the one immediately 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:30.509
 sees and then you are in the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.820
 said room with the pollern the ins 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.710
 black nothing lead that black 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.679
 nothing is known at the latest from Harry 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:41.249
 potter 1 the game 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:42.659
 that were and these bollards are with me 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:44.009
 have it first as a glass pane 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.499
 By now I think I identified 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.969
 but that it should be easy to beam 

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:49.499
 but these bars are not there but 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.090
 only the dirt texture on the 

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:52.320
 is bar-and why it looks the way it 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.149
 as if you were talking about something 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.970
 invisible or would like to 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:58.650
 invisible run 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:00.960
 and this room has no real 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:05.550
 use so he dives nowhere in the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:10.050
 because he is just there and I have 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:11.940
 at least 30 times already catacombs of 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.290
 Ascalon have to do then at all 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:14.610
 first to see those stairs there 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.830
 actually completely obviously around 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.450
 you can see how to get along 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.660
 blinkers in front of the eyes through the 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:25.980
 territory is running in any case 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:31.200
 this room completely without any 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:32.760
 meaning there and has no goal so is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.980
 it's not like kate moss doing that 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.320
 you would somehow have thought 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.120
 because of that because of that 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:45.300
 here yes there is no real 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.400
 fundamentally there is no end or no 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.750
 where you should go but you are 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.430
 sometime on the other side of the 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.680
 raumes but there is nothing and at some point 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.660
 Then you jump down into the black 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.730
 nothing and strangely ends up in 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.400
 Water was because Harry Potter then 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.080
 crashed and then wind so deaths 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.720
 then required with arms around so 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:05.519
 good as that time stopped and well 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.930
 if you dive around there a bit 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:10.170
 then you can see the pillars of 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:12.000
 know all these costs in there 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:14.130
 The air is soaring and so on 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.019
 drain pipe what others back in the bus 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:18.630
 room leads where you originally 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:22.230
 has started what is all this is 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:23.580
 very very mysterious and so on 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:25.080
 Ultimately, it is probably a part 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.370
 from all of them just in there 

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.290
 have left because they thought 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.239
 yes we have too much work 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.830
 why put it away ? 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:33.299
 Of course you would also have a rock 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.470
 then before the entrance can roll 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:36.450
 that would never have been noticed by a player 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:38.850
 but it got me on the thought 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:40.920
 what if they were the 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.330
 dungeons just like that would expand with 

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:44.940
 You do not already scrape those areas 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:47.820
 has seen that then a two ways or 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.860
 so come to the then part of the 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.200
 Dungeons do not show that before 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:53.880
 was enterable as for example this 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.240
 that you can solve a little puzzle and 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.920
 or something else because dungeons are year 

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:01.070
 a large part actually only 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:04.010
 go through and kill the necessary opponents 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:08.930
 and things like riddles are relative 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.760
 rarely and that is something a little bit 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.520
 Variety would bring variety 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:20.209
 is my favorite where it went believe 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:21.770
 i just been with me through the 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:24.290
 I have to heat every time the window 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:25.880
 close so I can record because 

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:27.350
 Any kids screaming around outside 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:29.150
 they are just getting their new swimming 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:31.340
 because they are so warm 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.660
 is and that ruins more of mine 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.430
 recordings and that's why I have to 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:35.660
 To make windows and I live was quite 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.360
 very high up 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.310
 and here is the roaring heat when 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:41.630
 the window is closed for two minutes 

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.550
 then I am already cooking here 

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.870
 and I'm literally burning. I'm one 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.820
 little little inferno 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.430
 By the way, there are some who asked me 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:51.110
 if there is a vote in the game 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.150
 I can not imagine that is me nor 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.190
 is located on the server elona rock 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.880
 and do not bite if he does not do it himself 

00:04:55.190 --> 00:05:00.710
 is bitten 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:02.240
 and yes, if you like bock what 

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.680
 always have to save me then do 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.820
 he that 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:08.180
 by driving this name euro 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:10.420
 last entry and I also write 

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:13.570
 back if I can 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.570
 See you
