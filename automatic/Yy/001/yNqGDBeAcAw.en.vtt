00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.149
 This video I propose to make a cot 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:55.390
 for the doll we need the old 

00:00:52.149 --> 00:01:01.440
 carton box a small piece 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:06.190
 cotton fabric sintepon cord 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.330
 scissors ruler corrugated cardboard paper for 

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:11.470
 scrapbooking 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.700
 pencil and ruler glue pva and hot 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:19.000
 glue to start take a piece of paper and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:29.580
 draw a rectangle of width 20 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:29.580
 centimeters and 17 centimeters high 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:45.870
 now retreat from the edges of three 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:50.280
 centimeter and inside big 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:55.790
 rectangle draw small 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.820
 3 cm high rectangle 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.820
 round the corners 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.950
 Now about 4 centimeters from 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:18.080
 and above and draw here 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:22.900
 from the broken line is our back 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:26.500
 future crib cut out a rectangle 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.500
 folded detail in half 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:39.040
 we have such a pattern 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.840
 using the template cut out 5 parts from 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:48.130
 cardboard 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:50.940
 Now we take the pattern we fold it like this 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:50.940
 way 

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:58.890
 we have a shorter back 

00:02:55.070 --> 00:03:03.890
 using a shorter template cut out 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:08.430
 5 short parts now take pva glue 

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:11.370
 glue the parts together with a small 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.400
 little big big after 

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:17.280
 how the parts are glued dry and within 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:20.220
 a few hours under the press will not get 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.410
 quite dense strong and now their 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:27.150
 need to declare can be painted 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:28.140
 paint or you can glue the paper for 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:30.600
 scrapbooking 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:33.330
 scrapbooking paper is thin 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.520
 cardboard if there is no such paper 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:39.390
 glue the usual colored cardboard or 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.770
 we should get colored paper 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:43.920
 2 such details 

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:46.680
 more this will be the back of this headboard 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.110
 smaller back for legs from 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.310
 corrugated cardboard cut two rectangles 

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:55.290
 measuring 30 by 20 centimeters 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.870
 glue these rectangles together 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:59.760
 for gluing rectangles can 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.610
 hot glue can be used 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.769
 use pva glue if we use 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.519
 glue pva then give some time on 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:11.340
 drying if we use hot glue then 

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:12.780
 can continue to work right away also 

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:16.950
 cut small rectangles 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:20.010
 measuring 30 by 3 centimeters to us 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.390
 6 parts required glue them 

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:23.390
 three not among themselves 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:38.270
 Now the resulting long titans 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:41.470
 glue to the base now 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.570
 paste the sintepon 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.640
 if there is no sintepona you can use 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:49.870
 another soft cloth or for example 

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:54.010
 some dish sponge 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:54.010
 we will have a mattress 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:03.979
 paste the glue so it does not orzal 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.310
 now we take a piece of cloth we begin 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:16.250
 stick in 

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:30.060
 our mattress turn over work 

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:33.590
 glue first style now 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.590
 glue stels 

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:45.539
 after we pasted over the mattress 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:49.190
 we got here such a view now 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:52.020
 we need to finish backs 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:55.080
 if we pasted the backs with cardboard 

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.030
 turned out uneven edge it can be either 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.719
 paint it so it is 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.500
 prettier or pasted cord I want 

00:06:00.719 --> 00:06:07.169
 glue it and a cord like this 

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:11.759
 for this, I take the cord by adding a little bit 

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:14.539
 glue and neatly perimeter of it 

00:06:11.759 --> 00:06:14.539
 stick on 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:24.250
 when the backs are ready to glue them to 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.250
 mattress 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:45.340
 Well, that's all ready to bed 

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:45.340
