wouldn't catch any fish so it's just a

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.560 
wouldn't catch any fish so it's just a
little<00:02:00.560> art<00:02:00.800> of<00:02:00.979> teasing<00:02:01.430> them<00:02:01.550> it's<00:02:02.120> actually

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
in the UK as well barramundi Zander

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:15.790 
in the UK as well barramundi Zander
on<00:02:14.239> fish<00:02:14.480> in<00:02:14.599> Australia<00:02:15.050> it's<00:02:15.200> a<00:02:15.319> fish<00:02:15.530> that's

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
on fish in Australia it's a fish that's

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.009 
on fish in Australia it's a fish that's
not<00:02:15.980> one<00:02:16.340> of<00:02:16.370> those<00:02:16.700> easy<00:02:17.090> fish<00:02:17.420> to<00:02:17.599> catch

not one of those easy fish to catch

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:19.750 
not one of those easy fish to catch
now<00:02:18.290> we<00:02:18.530> spend<00:02:18.769> a<00:02:18.890> lot<00:02:18.920> of<00:02:19.069> time<00:02:19.340> trying<00:02:19.670> to

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
now we spend a lot of time trying to

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.850 
now we spend a lot of time trying to
teach<00:02:20.000> people<00:02:20.239> different<00:02:20.720> techniques<00:02:21.140> of<00:02:21.379> how

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
teach people different techniques of how

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.580 
teach people different techniques of how
to<00:02:21.890> catch<00:02:22.160> these<00:02:22.400> guys<00:02:22.700> and<00:02:23.030> as<00:02:24.019> well<00:02:24.470> as

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
to catch these guys and as well as

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.259 
to catch these guys and as well as
provide<00:02:24.920> an<00:02:25.040> experience<00:02:25.220> of<00:02:25.640> these<00:02:25.760> magic

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:26.269 
provide an experience of these magic

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:27.640 
provide an experience of these magic
wetlands<00:02:26.780> that<00:02:26.900> always<00:02:27.260> something

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:27.650 
wetlands that always something

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.350 
wetlands that always something
differently<00:02:27.950> happening<00:02:28.280> around<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.940> clock

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:29.360 
differently happening around the clock

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.550 
differently happening around the clock
so<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:30.799> barramundi<00:02:31.519> ZAR<00:02:31.970> a<00:02:32.269> predator<00:02:33.170> of<00:02:33.319> the

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
so the barramundi ZAR a predator of the

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.130 
so the barramundi ZAR a predator of the
wetlands<00:02:34.010> and<00:02:34.310> so<00:02:35.150> we<00:02:35.360> need<00:02:35.540> little<00:02:35.690> tricks<00:02:35.959> to

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:36.140 
wetlands and so we need little tricks to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:38.740 
wetlands and so we need little tricks to
tease<00:02:36.410> him<00:02:36.620> into<00:02:37.250> attacking<00:02:37.879> artificial

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
tease him into attacking artificial

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.119 
tease him into attacking artificial
baits<00:02:38.959> because<00:02:39.410> we're<00:02:39.560> not<00:02:39.650> allowed<00:02:39.830> to<00:02:39.950> use

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129 
baits because we're not allowed to use

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:43.809 
baits because we're not allowed to use
any<00:02:40.310> natural<00:02:40.940> baits<00:02:41.390> or<00:02:41.629> dead<00:02:42.110> baits<00:02:42.819> kakadu

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
any natural baits or dead baits kakadu

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.490 
any natural baits or dead baits kakadu
is<00:02:44.000> an<00:02:44.150> area<00:02:44.450> that's<00:02:44.480> got<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.260> many<00:02:45.410> different

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
is an area that's got so many different

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:47.500 
is an area that's got so many different
opportunities<00:02:45.980> there's<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:46.880> many<00:02:47.030> vast

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
opportunities there's so many vast

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.140 
opportunities there's so many vast
differences<00:02:48.410> around<00:02:49.099> the<00:02:49.280> area<00:02:49.579> you<00:02:50.000> can

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:50.150 
differences around the area you can

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:51.370 
differences around the area you can
drive<00:02:50.360> in<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.599> calculon<00:02:51.079> think<00:02:51.230> there's

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:51.380 
drive in the calculon think there's

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.199 
drive in the calculon think there's
nothing<00:02:51.799> to<00:02:52.010> it<00:02:52.130> you<00:02:52.549> must<00:02:52.760> get<00:02:52.970> off<00:02:53.000> the
