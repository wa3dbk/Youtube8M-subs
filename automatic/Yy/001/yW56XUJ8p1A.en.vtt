00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.280
 for the next year in the meantime we reopen the gates of 75 beautiful gardens in 14 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:14.739
 region 

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.279
 with the novelty is that there will be 3 gardens in the canton of ticino 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:21.609
 and a mortar garden 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:22.970
 15 kings to face 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.850
 the year after a particularly favorable season that was that of 2009 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.760
 where we recorded 3 seven million visitors to our group 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.900
 we reopen the gates with great confidence 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.130
 trust is based on the fact that it is not a fashion to visit gardens 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.080
 but it is part of Italy in the installation of museum visits 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.080
 they also visit open-air large gardens and it's a feat 

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.940
 in the feminine 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.940
 that is, an Interista is not an association 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.470
 ellam willingness to create an economic system of arturo 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.330
 which passes helping each garden to become a small business to its own 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.170
 time 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.840
 that is, to deal with good garden management 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:14.240
 with a market perspective 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.520
 women 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:18.180
 it's a bad word means market 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.750
 you are simply an owner 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.580
 decides to open subjects born anna uncertain id 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:28.460
 must provide services ranging from guided tours 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.910
 maybe done well and maybe in multiple languages ​​to create attractive brochures 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.549
 apnea create pay also for the vineyards of books oo dvd o 

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:42.050
 improvise a doing system 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.170
 hotels and restaurants 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.280
 it is a very positive impact on the territory 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.080
 beautiful first 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.810
 in absolute relapse and in terms of jobs because a garden itself 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.850
 is in the middle of the countryside 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.160
 it's not near a factory 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.179
 hence the fact that villa carlotta dpa22 

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:05.190
 workplaces and gardeners 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.179
 i'm at 12 people tiscali 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:09.540
 it means 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.450
 for on the territory we have created an induced for at least forty of 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.449
 family 

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:19.679
 ours is an example of sustainable development of a green enterprise that 

00:02:19.679 --> 00:02:20.449
 it works 

00:02:20.449 --> 00:02:23.419
 when we talk a lot about green economy 

00:02:23.419 --> 00:02:26.149
 I believe we are at the top of the list 

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:30.939
 because it is we have the most environmentally-friendly product 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:35.019
 even if our company is certainly not polluted 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.589
 eeeehm enhances the landscape indeed protects it because it happens 

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:43.099
 he is a man who has almost all the owners of large Italian gardens 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:45.390
 and the anti one 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:50.250
 is to be in the territory and to be very present all the discussions that 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.300
 concern 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.869
 any urban development on the territory 

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:59.219
 talked about teaching eeeehm also amused and reported the students 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.359
 it means there are traditional Italian demeter centers there are paths 

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.359
 didactic for middle schools 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:10.610
 and they are made rather well 

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:15.279
 and I must say that the teachers of the air schools 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:18.779
 they recognize in us. a certain still here 

00:03:19.729 --> 00:03:23.219
 in doing these educational paths then I sing you the situations for 

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:26.259
 example with the province of Como strictly but not only 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:32.139
 that was a fortuitous encounter between two great Italian gardens 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:35.179
 has moved its offices to como 

00:03:35.179 --> 00:03:39.679
 I went to introduce myself to the councilor for culture and tourism in the province 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:43.150
 of majolica as a doctorate 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.080
 which kindly welcomed our initiative 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:50.299
 indeed, there has been more than I am about to certify 

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:51.689
 I know 

00:03:51.689 --> 00:03:56.180
 an itinerary of Giadini that can be visited on Lake Como and in the province of Como 

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.400
 it will also be present now as the numbers 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.279
 the largest weather gardens in Italy 

00:04:02.279 --> 00:04:03.160
 sale 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.070
 linear numbers are 75 gardens in 14 regions 

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:14.039
 we had a 27% increase in Italian visitation we had a 

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:15.299
 increase 

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:19.849
 and the visitors from the emerging countries, however, the latest 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:25.219
 therefore czech republic hungary slovenia because they are countries bordering to 

00:04:25.219 --> 00:04:26.699
 cultural tourism 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:29.899
 thanks to the well-being just arrived in these countries 

00:04:30.509 --> 00:04:33.250
 for another important number 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.590
 which are 10 group gardens 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.030
 in lombardy 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:44.730
 11 in Tuscan 11 in the Veneto region which means that each region has its own heritage 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:47.569
 of gardens 

00:04:47.569 --> 00:04:52.230
 let's not say the exclusivity beautiful in Tuscany, even Lombardy is not there 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:56.860
 of the gardens of extraordinary beauty the current president of the Venetian doctor 

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.140
 matteo marzotto 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.730
 he is trained as an entrepreneur 

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:05.199
 not only because it is born in a family of entrepreneurs but because in turn 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:07.520
 other took this path 

00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:12.110
 then talk to him to have someone understand 

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.490
 that certain choices are needed 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.740
 re in the tourism sector 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:19.599
 hum 

00:05:19.599 --> 00:05:20.909
 then 

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:25.280
 he very well accepted my request to have more 

00:05:25.279 --> 00:05:27.400
 visibility of this sector 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.139
 and that the voice delano portico culturism was taken into consideration 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.879
 alax like all the other sectors of cultural tourism 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:42.979
 shooting at a person who has a particular sensitivity for 3d not 

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:43.970
 I think 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:49.370
 so it has not made us into the most wok sushi 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:53.040
 he understood that it was a good showpiece of Italian tourism 

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.110
 visiting the gardens abroad is also a form of increasing people 

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.259
 knowledge 

00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:01.169
 there are blackberries 

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:01.949
 Mountain 

00:06:01.949 --> 00:06:03.779
 in tourism 

00:06:03.779 --> 00:06:08.739
 there is the great tour of the late eighteenth century for very few offspring of the great 

00:06:08.739 --> 00:06:10.409
 rho-pero families 

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:14.210
 we arrived at mass tourism the hordes that arrive 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:15.780
 and the pits start again 

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:19.910
 they review piazza di siena only when they get home when they don't 

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.020
 photo 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.990
 now a form of tourism has arrived 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:25.789
 that 

00:06:25.789 --> 00:06:29.089
 it is part of psychological well-being 

00:06:29.089 --> 00:06:31.469
 ie hey d 

00:06:31.469 --> 00:06:34.050
 the individual lives longer 

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:37.050
 isidora than in her moments of freedom 

00:06:38.389 --> 00:06:41.389
 even parties in a form to enhance one's culture 

00:06:42.059 --> 00:06:45.419
 it is never in rapallo I am in an academic manner 

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:49.680
 poor we are not talking about a mass phenomenon we are talking about a 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:50.849
 lilac phenomenon 

00:06:50.849 --> 00:06:53.819
 argo consumption c is always more people 

00:06:53.819 --> 00:06:56.440
 they would like to visit a garden 

00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:00.919
 but again not to enter and leave tourism hit and run 

00:07:00.919 --> 00:07:03.979
 but because it can be a life experience 

00:07:03.979 --> 00:07:10.300
 hahaha I remember that day spent in that garden smells sounds 

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:11.259
 colors 

00:07:11.259 --> 00:07:14.930
 maybe a good concert maybe I ate well 

00:07:14.930 --> 00:07:21.580
 the absence of traffic noise becomes almost a life experience too 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:24.599
 because we increasingly feel the need for contact with nature 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.999
 yes absolutely loved him he needs you 

00:07:29.499 --> 00:07:32.039
 it is strange that we grow old 

00:07:32.039 --> 00:07:35.199
 the more one attaches to the species land and therefore 

00:07:35.199 --> 00:07:36.960
 to almost everyone 

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:40.830
 if the urge comes, you will sooner or later get your hands on the ground 

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:44.969
 pandaranol branigen in Italian means being in contact with the 

00:07:44.969 --> 00:07:45.660
 nature 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.970
 without the labors of gardening and on your own
