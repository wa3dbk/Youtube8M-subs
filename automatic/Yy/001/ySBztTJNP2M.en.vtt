00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.790
 for tomorrow, Saturday, the 6th, today, points, followed 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.990
 and like in a chemistry lab sa where I have 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.419
 All kinds of products that ccoo provides 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:14.129
 in general more 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:15.309
 but here 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.159
 the govern is halloween that for having me and my favorite computer 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:20.909
 aa 

00:00:20.909 --> 00:00:23.210
 the asus eee pc 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:26.970
 I'm not excited at all about the same idea that much worse 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.810
 and I have loved you boudou the retailer 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:34.409
 and by way of his tests he was comparing 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:36.900
 the south tanda 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.180
 deadpool 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:41.250
 with the fonera 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.340
 then diverse and the blue banking 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.420
 he is a paparazzo 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.780
 very good for one thing yes for cows 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.960
 It is very good for cows 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.510
 and this is because the La Fonera 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.690
 as a result of having sense that it has 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.940
 more ethernet ports 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.730
 not one input and three output 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.239
 and a port or sd 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.140
 but 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.060
 the fombera 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.710
 offers is much more possibilities because the La Fonera 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.840
 to the 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.560
 to the harp in capsule 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.050
 a bit like 

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.010
 the Iphone 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:23.450
 is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.660
 a normal phone what happened on the iphone that is that it opened to the 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:30.660
 applications and is full of applications 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:32.640
 percent 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.759
 I have a lot of applications here that look on the iphone 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.950
 I do not know if you can see 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.159
 that's what we have managed to strain to test what does not have age 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.470
 the south entrance 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.470
 so for example if we go 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.260
 the present 

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:53.260
 affects what we can add applications 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.190
 as youtube flicker picasa 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.200
 turn down currents 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.840
 download fast servera plo 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.850
 and all the applications to do 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:07.179
 people from the community are also the thirteen 

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:11.609
 if from here to send 

00:02:11.609 --> 00:02:14.650
 receive 13 and send wi-fi signals 

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:17.039
 adn 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.929
 instead the bread that in turn 

00:02:19.929 --> 00:02:21.999
 the only thing that allows to do 

00:02:21.999 --> 00:02:23.169
 is 

00:02:23.169 --> 00:02:24.629
 tied 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:26.679
 it's really a mine 

00:02:26.679 --> 00:02:30.939
 the bridge connects to the internet and he is also that one thing is because the 

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.209
 fonera and there will be funes that are little more than reach 

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:37.469
 but you need more and nothing more 

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:40.819
 we also make cow with this product with cow 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:45.009
 but let's spend a lot more things 

00:02:45.619 --> 00:02:48.889
 but there is also a very specific theme and this is 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.419
 the blue card 

00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:53.509
 it costs 259 in euros 

00:02:54.179 --> 00:02:57.229
 i the fonera 

00:02:57.229 --> 00:03:01.279
 xavier price of 49 leaves tomorrow the price of 49 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:06.700
 i good the also in most of the problems of the people 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:11.060
 Not only do you want more functionality, but you want it to be reasonably priced
