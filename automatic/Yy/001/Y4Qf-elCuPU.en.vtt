look<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.869> it's<00:00:22.740> very<00:00:23.070> similar<00:00:23.430> to<00:00:23.609> the<00:00:24.210> one

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
look and it's very similar to the one

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.630 
look and it's very similar to the one
that<00:00:24.359> she<00:00:24.660> wears<00:00:24.840> in<00:00:25.199> the<00:00:25.230> video<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.830> I'm

that she wears in the video and I'm

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:27.859 
that she wears in the video and I'm
going<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.849> say<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.119> inspired<00:00:27.539> look<00:00:27.750> because

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
going to say it's inspired look because

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:29.480 
going to say it's inspired look because
it's<00:00:28.080> very<00:00:28.260> difficult<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.740> get<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.070> exact

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it's very difficult to get the exact

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:30.859 
it's very difficult to get the exact
look<00:00:29.670> because<00:00:29.820> she's<00:00:30.090> kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> moving<00:00:30.660> all

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
look because she's kind of moving all

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.060 
look because she's kind of moving all
over<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.140> place<00:00:31.260> in<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.619> video<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:31.980> you
