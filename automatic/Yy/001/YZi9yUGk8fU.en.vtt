00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 good evening gentlemen co-creator season 

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.420
 thirty-one I'm going to do a little 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.179
 balance sheet compared to this first 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.710
 part of the seoul season because I 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.080
 am in seoul i'm leaving tomorrow in paris 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:14.610
 but here I come back from Japan and I did 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.550
 as seoul is not far from tokyo en 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.529
 done I could do three days 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:22.380
 of interview here and wonderful 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.630
 meetings including a small conference at 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.090
 seoul since my book the first book 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:28.500
 has been translated into Korean so it's a 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.890
 delight to be here but I wanted to do 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.779
 a review 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.030
 specifically compared to my parade 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.040
 his day the season 30 and one on the 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.430
 health compared to my rosacea find 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.120
 vitality solutions take over the 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.270
 sport etc 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.219
 so this is particularly relevant 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.110
 for me when I travel because 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:49.020
 regain your rhythm to eat healthy 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.110
 and that's super important so already 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.079
 down I'm trying to eat glass of 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.699
 salad fruit things as soon as 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.350
 I can because abroad it's not 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.350
 obviously obvious especially in Asia we do not 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:04.049
 slice ate a lot of rice from 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.960
 eat on the street or quickly and 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.369
 here I am not particularly 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.420
 attracted to meat I could eat 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.280
 sometimes fish but 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.140
 my eating habits are in 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.509
 very healthy general where there is a small 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:20.280
 blocking is taking over the sport even a 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:22.619
 big blockage because it really does 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.090
 three years more than three years that i do 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.270
 more of the sport regularly I do it 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.940
 from time to time I see there but no 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.460
 regularly and as I could have 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.869
 before I went maybe one to two times 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:38.039
 sometimes at the gym a day even that's me 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.430
 arrived at a time when we were doing 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:40.680
 Roller 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.580
 I was still active and that's 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.049
 important it is true that I move 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.310
 a lot in the ink travels with 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.619
 transporting these big ones 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.569
 suitcases somewhere it's exercise 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:52.220
 but really this desire to resume 

00:01:48.569 --> 00:01:55.619
 the sport and I realized that already 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.850
 it's a first observation it's since that 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.890
 beginning of this season it's already 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.479
 learned to accept my body without this 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.850
 physical effort whereas before I 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:05.039
 were playing sports to have a body that 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.500
 I loved and it's true that since then 

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:09.119
 I learned to accept me malaya returns 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.690
 still a huge way to go for 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.030
 accept my body as it is but I 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.560
 find that the reason I 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:19.410
 will resume the sport is really 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.230
 for me for for for a longevity 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.989
 to feel good for having this 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.920
 energy is really for others 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:27.230
 reasons that may be more 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.579
 deep 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.019
 I could re I could do for the 

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.720
 first time a gym session 

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:37.200
 with a friend with whom I was visiting 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:40.650
 by the way who was the man I 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.910
 attracted during season 30 and just by 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.769
 report to that a little note is that we 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:48.480
 has become friends again in fact ie 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.200
 that yet an extraordinary man who 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.820
 glue etc 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.739
 but it's true that it was more of a 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.450
 friendship than anything else in any case it's 

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.510
 the case for the moment this is what we have 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:59.659
 found and I pray 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.689
 to be free in my head and to be able to 

00:02:59.659 --> 00:03:04.900
 really attract a man who would 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:08.060
 is 100% suitable and then especially who even 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.959
 100% him too short that's a 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:10.970
 little parenthesis compared to the 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.129
 second before but in any case we were 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:15.230
 at the gym and that but I was tired 

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.269
 I did not want to go but the fact 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.879
 to be in this gym 

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:22.040
 and put myself to exercise and 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:24.260
 to go there it gave me a hell peach 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.060
 or 15 minutes the fatigue that was 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:30.019
 really present by the travels and 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:32.900
 cetera was no longer there so that it was his 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.639
 mass I liked it I liked it because 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.930
 it means that when we play sports 

00:03:34.639 --> 00:03:37.129
 we win in full but it became 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.720
 something concrete and not 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:41.690
 only something that were 

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:43.569
 so that's great 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.280
 for Marc aux and there have been huge 

00:03:43.569 --> 00:03:47.359
 fines had a huge stress since marc 

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.599
 to the aces and started to increase 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:52.370
 increased increased a week ago I 

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:55.159
 I arrived in Japan on May 13th so there 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:57.049
 we are the 22nd of May I am in 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:04:00.170
 korea but i was in tokyo and it was in 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:03.919
 full but then really blooming 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:05.690
 total and so I had met the 

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:08.000
 week before the left doctor and 

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:10.010
 thanks to a co-creator who gave it to me 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.510
 recommended for my skin and so I 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.419
 met the coach doctor who and 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:16.190
 homeopath and so that's I can take 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.030
 I take now besides morning 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:22.130
 evening of homeopathy 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.080
 but I must admit that yet I have 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:25.820
 been seeing energists just before 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.120
 I did a lot of sessions that made me 

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.440
 of 

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:32.150
 no but it will not solve the problem of 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.710
 the skin i had she prescribed me ten 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:35.180
 antibiotic days so there they are 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.010
 finished is foiled come from 

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:38.360
 finish 

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:41.600
 I did not want to start but 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:44.560
 given the intensity and the crisis ben here 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:47.200
 so already progress what I see 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.000
 I am not completely against 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.260
 classical medicine but it's true 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.640
 that antibiotics we know that 

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:55.900
 do a lot of other sores next 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.970
 but I was trying to take it in 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.530
 love in serenity and then tell me 

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:01.120
 that there was one it was ten days 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.340
 while normally normally it is 

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:04.570
 a month already had a progress and then she 

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.310
 she and she sees things so 

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:09.970
 holistic so it's all another 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:11.200
 support work at the end of the lease 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.430
 also made me a little bit of 

00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.960
 laser so I try different things 

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:18.400
 to help relieve it all by 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.400
 continuing to try to find the 

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.440
 reasons of course of this plot I think 

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.000
 that I think I 'm starting to 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.460
 to see that it's a discord it's 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.320
 something that is not how to say 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:30.310
 it's when I communicate 

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.680
 when there is something that is not 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:34.390
 communicated and this is one of the reasons for 

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:38.920
 which I communicated with this friend 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:41.050
 with whom so it was over 2 then 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.570
 of February we saw each other 

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:46.330
 together more or less and that's where he 

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:48.190
 there was a saga I think with 1 st 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:51.100
 triggered my rose stopped the fact that I 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.390
 did not communicate required and and there 

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:54.280
 had a trick that is games have 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:55.240
 communicated one every day but who 

00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:56.830
 had something that was not like 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.030
 he said who was not ok for me in 

00:05:56.830 --> 00:06:00.490
 this relationship that is not clear 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:02.470
 that they were not saying and I was not 

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:03.490
 in integrity and maybe that maybe 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.920
 that there was that too 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.810
 in any case to listen is a 

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:08.890
 season that starts slowly but where I 

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.680
 think there are a lot of things that 

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:13.810
 are settling I can not wait to 

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.070
 yes to redo the sport I have 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.800
 aches for three days to 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.949
 the outcome of this assignment of the gym but 

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:23.710
 I really appreciate the gym 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:25.600
 maybe maybe I'll go maybe 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.289
 to find one in Paris I do not know 

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.910
 same time i'm still in 

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:29.229
 displacement 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:30.880
 so here it is but delicious co creator 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:31.680
 but my faith is a season that 

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:35.560
 goes well 

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:37.530
 and then I would like to do some 

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:39.160
 interviews around topics there necessarily 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.280
 in any case 

00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:44.020
 listen I'll meet you again on May 26th if 

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:46.210
 you come to his live interviews 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.259
 that I'm doing theater in paris and then to 

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:48.610
 full of other things will go to 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:49.720
 Brussels and many other dates 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.759
 kill each other sets up below 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.009

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:56.800
 your definition is going very well 

00:06:54.009 --> 00:06:58.780
 the parade notebook are day comes out on the 12th 

00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:01.870
 June so that's because there was not bad 

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:06.250
 of cancellation finally two late but 

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:08.020
 these are the concerns with the printer but

 I kiss you very very very much and I 

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:12.840
