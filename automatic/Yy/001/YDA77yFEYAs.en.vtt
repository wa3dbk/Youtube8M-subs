the<00:02:08.820> manure<00:02:09.149> where<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.930> goes<00:02:10.170> into<00:02:10.649> a<00:02:10.890> gutter

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
the manure where it goes into a gutter

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:16.970 
the manure where it goes into a gutter
and<00:02:11.850> gets<00:02:12.120> pumped<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.540> the<00:02:12.570> digester<00:02:15.770> so<00:02:16.770> this

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
and gets pumped to the digester so this

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.920 
and gets pumped to the digester so this
is<00:02:17.100> what<00:02:17.220> a<00:02:17.250> digester<00:02:17.880> looks<00:02:18.090> like<00:02:18.330> it's

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:18.930 
is what a digester looks like it's

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.380 
is what a digester looks like it's
basically<00:02:19.080> just<00:02:19.410> a<00:02:19.620> concrete<00:02:20.160> in<00:02:21.030> ground

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
basically just a concrete in ground

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.360 
basically just a concrete in ground
swimming<00:02:21.600> pool<00:02:21.930> with<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.290> concrete<00:02:22.530> cover<00:02:23.070> and

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:23.370 
swimming pool with a concrete cover and

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:25.550 
swimming pool with a concrete cover and
all<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> manure<00:02:24.210> that<00:02:24.300> you<00:02:24.600> saw<00:02:24.870> being

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
all the manure that you saw being

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.860 
all the manure that you saw being
collected<00:02:25.920> in<00:02:26.160> the<00:02:26.280> olive<00:02:26.490> barns<00:02:26.850> comes<00:02:27.660> right

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
collected in the olive barns comes right

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:35.510 
collected in the olive barns comes right
into<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.170> digester

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.480 

and<00:02:36.110> from<00:02:37.110> there's<00:02:37.350> where<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.650> goes<00:02:37.830> into<00:02:38.190> the

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490 
and from there's where it goes into the

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:40.970 
and from there's where it goes into the
separator<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.690> then<00:02:40.050> the<00:02:40.140> separator<00:02:40.590> we

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
separator and then the separator we

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.100 
separator and then the separator we
squeeze<00:02:41.460> liquids<00:02:42.000> out<00:02:42.150> and<00:02:42.420> then<00:02:42.570> the<00:02:42.660> solids

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:43.110 
squeeze liquids out and then the solids

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.750 
squeeze liquids out and then the solids
are<00:02:43.620> effectively<00:02:44.070> what<00:02:44.280> you're<00:02:44.430> seeing<00:02:44.640> when

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
are effectively what you're seeing when

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
they mix them more comfortable and a cow

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.580 
they mix them more comfortable and a cow
that's<00:02:51.120> comfortable<00:02:51.570> is<00:02:51.810> gonna<00:02:52.020> be<00:02:52.230> happier

come into a manure pond just like this
in<00:03:01.200> this<00:03:01.770> liquid<00:03:01.950> manure<00:03:02.310> is<00:03:03.060> what<00:03:03.330> we<00:03:03.450> use<00:03:03.630> in

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:03.840 
in this liquid manure is what we use in

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:14.570 
in this liquid manure is what we use in
the<00:03:03.930> aerator<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.530> fertilize<00:03:04.980> all<00:03:05.190> our<00:03:05.340> fields

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.250 

then<00:03:15.580> we<00:03:15.880> pump<00:03:16.150> those<00:03:16.480> nutrients<00:03:16.990> when<00:03:17.110> we're

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
then we pump those nutrients when we're

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:18.480 
then we pump those nutrients when we're
ready<00:03:17.470> when<00:03:17.650> our<00:03:17.770> fields<00:03:18.040> are<00:03:18.100> ready<00:03:18.250> to<00:03:18.400> be

fertilized through a hose hose goes for

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.990 
fertilized through a hose hose goes for
several<00:03:21.220> miles<00:03:21.430> and<00:03:22.860> goes<00:03:23.860> to<00:03:24.250> the<00:03:24.580> aerator

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:25.000 
several miles and goes to the aerator

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.360 
several miles and goes to the aerator
which<00:03:25.270> is<00:03:25.450> just<00:03:25.870> little<00:03:26.110> wheels<00:03:26.500> that<00:03:26.950> pokes

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
which is just little wheels that pokes

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:29.820 
which is just little wheels that pokes
holes<00:03:27.730> into<00:03:28.060> the<00:03:28.240> ground<00:03:28.510> and<00:03:28.900> then<00:03:29.650> the

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
holes into the ground and then the

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:31.770 
holes into the ground and then the
manure<00:03:30.160> that's<00:03:30.640> going<00:03:31.060> through<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.240> hose<00:03:31.480> is

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
manure that's going through the hose is

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.780 
manure that's going through the hose is
just<00:03:31.960> being<00:03:32.410> sprayed<00:03:32.800> right<00:03:33.010> behind<00:03:33.310> that<00:03:33.580> so

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
just being sprayed right behind that so

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.850 
just being sprayed right behind that so
it<00:03:33.880> has<00:03:33.910> some<00:03:34.210> place<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.450> go<00:03:34.750> and<00:03:35.050> those<00:03:35.620> holes

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
it has some place to go and those holes

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:38.010 
it has some place to go and those holes
are<00:03:36.130> just<00:03:36.370> injecting<00:03:36.970> allowing<00:03:37.570> that<00:03:37.690> manure

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:38.020 
are just injecting allowing that manure

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.560 
are just injecting allowing that manure
to<00:03:38.200> flow<00:03:38.410> right<00:03:38.620> inside<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.220> soils<00:03:39.640> so<00:03:40.330> where

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:40.570 
to flow right inside the soils so where

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:42.420 
to flow right inside the soils so where
it's<00:03:40.660> going<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.840> stay<00:03:41.080> put<00:03:41.350> where<00:03:41.920> we<00:03:42.100> need<00:03:42.310> it

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
it's going to stay put where we need it

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.920 
it's going to stay put where we need it
so<00:03:42.580> that<00:03:42.760> we<00:03:42.850> can<00:03:42.940> grow<00:03:43.150> our<00:03:43.420> crops<00:03:43.600> for<00:03:43.870> our

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
so that we can grow our crops for our

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:55.040 
so that we can grow our crops for our
cows<00:03:44.140> for<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.440> next<00:03:44.680> year

between seven to eight thousand gallons
that<00:03:57.450> go<00:03:57.720> up<00:03:57.930> that's<00:03:58.680> a<00:03:58.830> little<00:03:58.860> heavy<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.310> I

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
that go up that's a little heavy so I

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:01.190 
that go up that's a little heavy so I
have<00:03:59.670> my<00:03:59.850> three<00:04:00.210> and<00:04:00.300> a<00:04:00.360> half<00:04:00.510> miles<00:04:00.840> an<00:04:01.050> hour

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
have my three and a half miles an hour

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.770 
have my three and a half miles an hour
got<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.800> we<00:04:02.340> capture<00:04:02.910> all<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.210> nutrients<00:04:03.660> on

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
got it we capture all the nutrients on

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.200 
got it we capture all the nutrients on
the<00:04:03.870> farm<00:04:04.080> and<00:04:04.590> we're<00:04:04.940> regulated<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:06.060> we're

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:06.210 
the farm and we're regulated and we're

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.570 
the farm and we're regulated and we're
watched<00:04:06.450> and<00:04:06.780> we<00:04:06.870> measure<00:04:07.140> and<00:04:07.590> it's<00:04:08.310> a

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
watched and we measure and it's a

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:11.630 
watched and we measure and it's a
scientific<00:04:09.390> process<00:04:09.630> it's<00:04:10.080> not<00:04:10.170> just<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.920> shoot

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
scientific process it's not just a shoot

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.120 
scientific process it's not just a shoot
from<00:04:11.790> the<00:04:11.910> hip<00:04:12.140> the<00:04:13.140> whole<00:04:13.350> idea<00:04:13.770> with<00:04:13.980> this

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
from the hip the whole idea with this

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.290 
from the hip the whole idea with this
type<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.340> fertilization<00:04:14.730> with<00:04:15.150> any

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
type of fertilization with any

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:17.720 
type of fertilization with any
fertilization<00:04:16.049> is<00:04:16.500> to<00:04:16.770> keep<00:04:16.980> the<00:04:17.190> nutrients

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
fertilization is to keep the nutrients

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.220 
fertilization is to keep the nutrients
where<00:04:18.000> they're<00:04:18.150> needed<00:04:18.360> right<00:04:18.959> where<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 
where they're needed right where the

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.590

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600

aeration<00:04:22.320> is<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.470> perfect<00:04:22.830> example<00:04:22.920> but<00:04:23.400> we

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
aeration is a perfect example but we

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.100 
aeration is a perfect example but we
