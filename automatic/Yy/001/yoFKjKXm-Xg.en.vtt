00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.640
 hello very good this I feel that being 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.369
 this one castilla with another always good in 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.840
 this case to talk about cos 2 if 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.820
 we keep containing here all the ship 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:26.529
 and remember one of the things that I wanted 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:28.840
 talk about commenting this campaign mode 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:30.189
 this game and good we are still people 

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.559
 when we bought a game like this aragon 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.720
 general ok I do not say neither a person nor 

00:00:32.559 --> 00:00:35.980
 this one but generally bought better for 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:38.860
 to be able to play online what is it 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.720
 lately we call attention and for 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.000
 they have not been created they do not stay 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.010
 games cooperatively and nothing is 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.800
 fact that the online is the same as 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:51.010
 that we are in the world can not 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.020
 say and well the campaign mode is based on 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:54.660
 a cold war supposedly in the 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.820
 21st century 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:59.800
 supposedly the game though as he said 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.629
 much tourist made of everything 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.699
 they are things that are almost all more 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.100
 food but good is a continuation 

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:07.210
 supposedly black ops is therefore the 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:08.730
 black horde a continuation of a 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.150
 spelling 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.860
 us and they do not come out 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.270
 the space if you have something pretty 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.900
 curious that I never think they had put 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.900
 not one game 

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:22.560
 and above all 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:26.140
 apart from making them in one of the cracks 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:30.340
 are the years as I said in 1980 and 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.350
 2025 is going to be based and good 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.060
 so I do not want to give you either 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.189
 so much and so much detail for people to 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.460
 who wants to placate do not know inside the 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.460
 all 

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.130
 Bell 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.320
 you'll see who to give so much more 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.620
 female protagonism is worth without giving 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:54.250
 much more prominence to women 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:56.620
 but yes to women in war no and 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.590
 good is something that never in any game 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.620
 decide uterus war had given 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:04.510
 much importance is to say was always 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:06.280
 I am I am without any store of 

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:08.140
 interest apart from having done something 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:12.000
 quite curious number expected ni 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.280
 even and well there will also be 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.140
 a lot of things to be able to drive from 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.150
 power the franc is we have been very 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.760
 well in the mode because the mode 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.710
 multiplayer lens in the movistar is going to 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.390
 be very well and that was proposed what 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:28.060
 you will be able to catch many many cars 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.290
 although this type is present, it is worth 

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.790
 also that's pretty good that 

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.650
 put in order to do the missions and 

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.980
 so good half of the supposed game 

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:38.650
 they are not said is not to rely more on the 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.570
 year 2025 that in the year 1980 the game 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.160
 that's why I tell you that it's going to be more 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:47.450
 young 2025 than 1980 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.120
 more little things in the campaign mode that are 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:53.130
 quite important they say at least 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.870
 they have said and have confirmed better 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.610
 everything is a lie and I tell you since 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.410
 with which they always say they say of 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.720
 beforehand and then with our game the 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.740
 They have changed because they did not like it 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.320
 although I change it for any 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:07.350
 story but hey they tell me he's going 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.390
 the game logically depends on how 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:10.770
 make alone depends on the decisions that 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.680
 take because if you are going to be able to take 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:15.750
 decisions I do not exist 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.880
 but good of them they confirm it in their 

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.620
 pages and they say that it depends on the 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:22.560
 decision that you make or depends on how 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.760
 do you the game based on a final 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.710
 Now I know you 're going to see several finals 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:27.330
 Let's say I can get the 

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:28.800
 platinum we're going to have to pass you what 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:30.780
 like I know all the games I do with in 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.820
 your health more times than you want 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.350
 pass it to you but good that is depends on 

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.570
 cost also know our lose 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.040
 almost nothing and well that's a part of the 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.020
 who wanted to talk for example other 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:43.720
 parts that I had talk is about 

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:45.280
 the totem chips if they are going to continue with the 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:48.490
 totem chips have confirmed it 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:51.250
 Totem will also have pizzas worth in 

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:54.790
 the game and well we take some we're going 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.800
 to cost the customers every success of 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:59.000
 go up as now they spend some three you 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.070
 they are going to give 

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:03.980
 a definite nap you will be able to use 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:06.110
 how we have been good Arabic now 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.030
 same supposedly for every game that 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.680
 have and raise a prestige 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:12.260
 procedurally in the account and what 

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:14.270
 I will support in the mode like premiere here 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:16.489
 that will be possible in the crazy everything 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:18.709
 You know, I was going to see that, there's going to be 

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:21.410
 Tote chips and what good in each 

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.630
 prestige when you normally upload the 

00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:25.420
 prestige you're going to have a record in the 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.500
 what will you be able to use it in what 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:33.850
 you want and also in the bank like the 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.500
 modern warfare 3 what you can have 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.910
 logically with the other games they give you 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:40.580
 other temple tokens at the moment he 

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:42.380
 they say they say they're going to try that 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:44.510
 be for each vestige an espicha tote 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:47.290
 you are going to have 10 in total and there is 

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:50.120
 this you and good for points for each 

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:52.460
 neighbor will be able to unlock an accessory 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.860
 or whatever they say them I will 

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.960
 I say this is what they have said in 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.570
 pages or if they want me not me when 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.120
 I speak or circus something was reported something not 

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.890
 I do not like tiger or say this 

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:05.050
 it was a vital signature but a new nation 

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:07.120
 because then logically 

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.569
 what happens because you can put the shrimp and 

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.569
 how not 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:18.610
 It's like bone 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.680
 totten but they are like points worthy is 

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:23.050
 as a point you will have 10 points worth 

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:25.509
 for unlocking to use it in what 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.490
 want if you want an accessory if 

00:05:25.509 --> 00:05:31.259
 you want in the weapon or in an advantage or in 

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:31.259
 something is as it is now what it is 

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:40.160
 logically they do not have to either put that 

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:42.590
 have nothing else to start the totem tracks 

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:46.100
 16 totem or those that are but as I have 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:48.110
 said every prestige of having vouchers 

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:50.389
 and unlocking because if you also 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.580
 you have all the struggles of the people not 

00:05:50.389 --> 00:05:54.080
 it's worth nothing not in a network directly 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:55.910
 with promises of networks that you want 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.230
 Well thank you very much people but 

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:59.230
 like we see each other
