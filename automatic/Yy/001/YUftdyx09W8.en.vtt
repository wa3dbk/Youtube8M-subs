it from here temperatures are supposed
to<00:02:57.099> stay<00:02:57.340> cold<00:02:57.700> for<00:02:57.909> the<00:02:58.090> next<00:02:58.329> few<00:02:58.480> days

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
to stay cold for the next few days

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.709 
to stay cold for the next few days
particularly<00:02:59.260> at<00:02:59.650> night<00:02:59.709> and<00:03:00.459> that's<00:03:01.030> perfect

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:01.719 
particularly at night and that's perfect

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:09.869 
particularly at night and that's perfect
ice<00:03:01.900> making<00:03:02.230> weather<00:03:08.129> we<00:03:09.129> only<00:03:09.280> drilled<00:03:09.639> one

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
ice making weather we only drilled one

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:11.670 
ice making weather we only drilled one
hole<00:03:10.150> at<00:03:10.329> the<00:03:10.359> seventh<00:03:10.810> line<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.439> that<00:03:11.500> was

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
hole at the seventh line and that was

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.770 
hole at the seventh line and that was
pretty<00:03:12.310> close<00:03:12.730> to<00:03:12.969> where<00:03:13.090> our<00:03:13.150> testing<00:03:13.629> point

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
pretty close to where our testing point

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.629 
pretty close to where our testing point
would<00:03:13.989> be<00:03:14.109> for<00:03:14.349> our<00:03:14.379> first<00:03:14.650> ice<00:03:14.829> contest<00:03:15.400> and

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:15.639 
would be for our first ice contest and

00:03:15.639 --> 00:03:23.399 
would be for our first ice contest and
here's<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.689> results<00:03:22.199> unfortunately<00:03:23.199> we

00:03:23.399 --> 00:03:23.409 
here's the results unfortunately we

00:03:23.409 --> 00:03:25.259 
here's the results unfortunately we
barely<00:03:23.709> had<00:03:23.980> three<00:03:24.280> inches<00:03:24.549> of<00:03:24.579> ice<00:03:24.790> and<00:03:25.090> it

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
barely had three inches of ice and it

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
barely had three inches of ice and it
wasn't<00:03:25.599> as<00:03:25.659> good<00:03:25.810> a<00:03:25.870> quality<00:03:26.169> as<00:03:26.530> the<00:03:26.560> iced<00:03:26.859> in

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
wasn't as good a quality as the iced in

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.490 
wasn't as good a quality as the iced in
shanty<00:03:27.370> bay<00:03:27.549> give<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.629> a<00:03:28.689> few<00:03:28.719> days<00:03:29.079> will<00:03:29.379> come

shanty bay give it a few days will come
back<00:03:29.650> and<00:03:29.829> test<00:03:30.010> it<00:03:30.129> again
