00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.880
 hello everyone with you lime and today I will 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.679
 to observe the wonderful from minecraft 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.370
 which adds belt items 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:16.740
 it looks like this, so I'll show 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:21.150
 what does he do lead we take the sword 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:23.820
 pickaxe potion torch and arrow 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.119
 let's see what has changed behind us 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:29.820
 there was an arrow in front of us also 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:31.650
 there remained a little chest a torch potion appeared and 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.390
 what tyunyachki 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.120
 uruk's pickaxe if i switch to 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.850
 something else to suit the sword 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.250
 pick we picked up this belt if 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.770
 I'll switch back to the pickaxe then the sword 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.660
 we were highlighted on the train guys this mod 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 principle does not add anything useful 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.610
 but I liked the guys like that 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.910
 small but really interesting 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.489
 Maud 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.620
 that is epic if you do n't want something 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.239
 epic stir up there I don't know then this 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.940
 quite a suitable mod which 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.859
 I may say no more like that 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.049
 closer to reality because maynkravt 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.000
 what if the inventory stupidly find 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.340
 items as it doesn’t look good 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.400
 so now it’s clear where the cobblestone is 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:13.500
 roll into that little little chest there 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:15.450
 tons of cobblestone did not get in principle 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
 nothing has changed my play only 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 visually I hope you this mod 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.750
 I liked it but I definitely 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.850
 like it if you want me to continue 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.950
