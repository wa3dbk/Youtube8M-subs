00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.010
 and fighting will also have a new 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.859
 center that is integrated with the function of 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.480
 live transmissions of exo font and the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.190
 players will be able to transmit 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.230
 his halo games of maastricht and 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.090
 collection and viewers will be able to see 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.950
 the game directly in the application 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:19.410
 of gilo channel and see the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.630
 updates the current score and 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:24.750
 much more really is the new mode 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.029
 good viewer I am 809 and I bring you 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.359
 another video on hd and without anything else that 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.230
 tell 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.169
 let us begin 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.480
 Well, if we have a viewer mode to 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.800
 halo of maastricht and collection and fight 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.140
 will not have a list of all 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.570
 halo transmissions through tweets 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:42.489
 that everyone can see this does things 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.470
 much easier for the organizers 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.690
 of tournaments or anyone who 

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:48.100
 want to launch some yale gameplay 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.960
 commentators will be able to change the 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:52.120
 players or transmissions with only 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.860
 press a button with the xbox one 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.989
 literally everyone can 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.610
 transmit in the game the commentators 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.140
 can interact with the sound of 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:01.150
 game and the microphones of the 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.370
 players like that can talk is to say be 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:05.649
 interrupted and even alternate players 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.000
 the only problem I see with this is 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:08.890
 that there may be advertising between 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 livestream and if there is not so cool 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.330
 now let's analyze the viewer mode of 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.830
 hello the master chief collection 

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:16.840
 first of all let's reproduce the 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.990
 normal video and then we put in part 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.990
 the video 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.940
 the video is about seven 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:29.950
 seconds long but too many 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.630
 things that you have to analyze first that 

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.180
 nothing is the full screen of the 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:36.880
 perspective of this player then passes 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:38.400
 a transition to the viewer mode in the 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.690
 which shows you the scores 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.180
 statistics ads and a chat 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.210
 Interactive neighbor of the blue team 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.920
 Take the first death and the score 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.960
 statistics and the ad are updated 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.970
 automatically and live at the same 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.190
 time the chat indicates that several 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.229
 people are seeing the perspectives 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:57.580
 of different players in which it is 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:01:59.590
 interesting if the player's name 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.270
 is on the yellow line is extremely 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.130
 likely to be the perspective that 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.660
 you are living live without mentioning that 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.759
 You can see who is talking in the 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.590
 team in the annals is amazing 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:11.140
 honestly and the potential that brings more 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.450
 of waiting tiptoe the channel and halo 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.700
 from master gym collection it shows that 343 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.380
 has worked quite a lot with twitch for 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.600
 have such a program for the community 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.520
 then what do you think they will throw him 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.830
 an eye to the new viewer mode of the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:25.360
 collection honestly I can not wait 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.910
