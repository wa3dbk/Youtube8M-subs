00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
that we're only going to be 5 parts to

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.410 
that we're only going to be 5 parts to
this<00:00:19.680> but<00:00:20.100> if<00:00:20.220> at<00:00:20.340> any<00:00:20.550> point<00:00:20.609> in<00:00:20.910> the<00:00:21.000> future<00:00:21.300> I

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
this but if at any point in the future I

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.090 
this but if at any point in the future I
find<00:00:21.720> a<00:00:21.810> new<00:00:22.050> way<00:00:22.199> of<00:00:22.230> running<00:00:22.439> up<00:00:22.680> first<00:00:22.920> I'll

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
are definitely a lot of challenges and

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.459

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
mostly you don't really track your

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.069 
mostly you don't really track your
challenges<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.449> they<00:01:00.629> just<00:01:00.809> happen<00:01:00.989> at

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
challenges and they just happen at

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.290 
challenges and they just happen at
random<00:01:01.379> times<00:01:01.590> which<00:01:02.219> is<00:01:02.399> good<00:01:02.640> but<00:01:03.090> if<00:01:03.180> you

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
random times which is good but if you

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.729 
random times which is good but if you
could<00:01:03.449> keep<00:01:03.539> a<00:01:03.600> really<00:01:03.899> close<00:01:03.989> eye<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.409> what

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
could keep a really close eye on what

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:06.230 
could keep a really close eye on what
you're<00:01:04.860> doing<00:01:05.220> you'd<00:01:05.549> be<00:01:05.700> able<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.909> get<00:01:06.000> much

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
you're doing you'd be able to get much

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.450 
you're doing you'd be able to get much
more<00:01:06.479> XP<00:01:06.930> so<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.710> go<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.920> your<00:01:08.040> challenges

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
more XP so you can go to your challenges

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.280 
more XP so you can go to your challenges
and<00:01:08.490> see<00:01:08.729> which<00:01:08.880> gives<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.210> more<00:01:09.360> XP<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.930> then

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
and see which gives you more XP and then

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020 
and see which gives you more XP and then
work<00:01:10.500> towards<00:01:10.979> them<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:11.549> there's<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.760> much

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
work towards them but there's a much

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:14.000 
work towards them but there's a much
faster<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.600> doing<00:01:12.869> that<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.200> it<00:01:13.710> gets<00:01:13.799> you

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010 
faster way of doing that and it gets you

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.070 
faster way of doing that and it gets you
more<00:01:14.159> XP<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> way<00:01:15.420> to<00:01:15.479> do<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.869> is

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
more XP now the way to do this is

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.230 
more XP now the way to do this is
