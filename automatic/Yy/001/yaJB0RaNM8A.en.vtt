check<00:00:00.989> it<00:00:01.140> out<00:00:01.350> it's<00:00:02.250> a<00:00:02.429> Canadian<00:00:03.120> silver

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
check it out it's a Canadian silver

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:10.310 
check it out it's a Canadian silver
quarter<00:00:04.370> from<00:00:06.830> 1952<00:00:07.970> here<00:00:08.970> it<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.210> here<00:00:09.510> pretty

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
quarter from 1952 here it is here pretty

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.770 
quarter from 1952 here it is here pretty
cool<00:00:11.870> so<00:00:12.870> I<00:00:13.880> saw<00:00:14.880> this<00:00:15.000> really<00:00:15.330> good<00:00:15.599> video

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
cool so I saw this really good video

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.590 
cool so I saw this really good video
from<00:00:16.529> number<00:00:16.800> file<00:00:17.100> and<00:00:17.400> it<00:00:18.150> got<00:00:18.359> me<00:00:18.390> thinking

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
from number file and it got me thinking

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.700 
from number file and it got me thinking
about<00:00:20.270> theories<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> economics<00:00:21.680> theories<00:00:22.680> of

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
about theories of economics theories of

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.800 
about theories of economics theories of
money<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:24.330> suppressed<00:00:24.840> ideas<00:00:25.789> so<00:00:26.789> I'm<00:00:27.390> sure

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
money and suppressed ideas so I'm sure

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.929 
money and suppressed ideas so I'm sure
everybody<00:00:28.320> has<00:00:28.769> heard<00:00:28.980> of<00:00:29.099> the<00:00:29.189> Pythagorean

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
everybody has heard of the Pythagorean

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.550 
everybody has heard of the Pythagorean
theorem<00:00:30.300> you<00:00:30.390> have<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.840> learn<00:00:30.960> it<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.199> like

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
theorem you have to learn it in like

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.030 
theorem you have to learn it in like
high<00:00:31.740> school<00:00:32.009> geometry<00:00:32.279> and<00:00:32.640> whatnot<00:00:33.030> and<00:00:34.040> one

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
high school geometry and whatnot and one

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.270 
high school geometry and whatnot and one
reason<00:00:35.460> why<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.610> think<00:00:36.120> that<00:00:36.329> there<00:00:37.110> are<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:38.040> lot

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
reason why I think that there are a lot

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.250 
reason why I think that there are a lot
of<00:00:38.309> people<00:00:38.430> who<00:00:38.760> have<00:00:38.790> trouble<00:00:39.540> with<00:00:39.690> math<00:00:39.930> is

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
of people who have trouble with math is

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.700 
of people who have trouble with math is
because<00:00:40.590> of<00:00:40.730> the<00:00:41.899> notations<00:00:42.899> in<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> symbol

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
because of the notations in the symbol

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.880 
because of the notations in the symbol
symbol<00:00:44.370> ology<00:00:44.969> we<00:00:45.090> use<00:00:45.360> right<00:00:45.739> stuff<00:00:46.739> in

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
symbol ology we use right stuff in

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.950 
symbol ology we use right stuff in
nature<00:00:47.250> right<00:00:47.460> you<00:00:47.850> you<00:00:48.059> look<00:00:48.270> at<00:00:48.390> nature<00:00:48.600> and

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
nature right you you look at nature and

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.750 
nature right you you look at nature and
people<00:00:49.500> are<00:00:49.739> trying<00:00:49.920> to<00:00:50.039> use<00:00:50.070> math<00:00:50.370> as<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> way

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
people are trying to use math as a way

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.360 
people are trying to use math as a way
of<00:00:50.789> describing<00:00:51.210> it<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.600> letters<00:00:51.899> numbers<00:00:52.370> so

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
of describing it with letters numbers so

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.270 
of describing it with letters numbers so
here<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.789> very<00:00:54.149> simple<00:00:54.449> way<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:55.280> understand

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
here is a very simple way of understand

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.610 
here is a very simple way of understand
the<00:00:56.399> Pythagorean<00:00:57.120> theorem<00:00:57.449> right<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.350> here<00:00:58.559> we

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
the Pythagorean theorem right so here we

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
the Pythagorean theorem right so here we
have<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.770> right<00:00:58.920> triangle<00:00:59.219> right<00:00:59.579> you<00:01:00.180> take<00:01:00.359> a

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
have a right triangle right you take a

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.049 
have a right triangle right you take a
right<00:01:00.629> triangle<00:01:00.920> you<00:01:01.920> make<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.160> square<00:01:02.609> on

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
right triangle you make a square on

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.770 
right triangle you make a square on
every<00:01:04.049> side<00:01:04.320> right<00:01:04.680> so<00:01:05.580> all<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.119> Pythagorean

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
every side right so all the Pythagorean

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.450 
every side right so all the Pythagorean
theorem<00:01:07.080> says<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.530> the<00:01:08.840> volume<00:01:09.840> of<00:01:10.460> the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
theorem says is that the volume of the

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.780 
theorem says is that the volume of the
bigger<00:01:11.700> square<00:01:12.180> is<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:13.320> sum<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.920> the<00:01:14.310> volumes

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
bigger square is the sum of the volumes

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.300 
bigger square is the sum of the volumes
of<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.150> other<00:01:15.330> square<00:01:15.860> this<00:01:16.860> right<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.189> is<00:01:17.220> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
of the other square this right here is a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.100 
of the other square this right here is a
Pythagorean<00:01:17.909> theorem<00:01:18.210> that's<00:01:18.479> all<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.900> you

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
Pythagorean theorem that's all it is you

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.190 
Pythagorean theorem that's all it is you
take<00:01:19.259> a<00:01:19.290> right<00:01:19.530> triangle<00:01:19.770> you<00:01:20.580> make<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.790> square

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:21.200 
take a right triangle you make a square

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.550 
take a right triangle you make a square
right<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:23.210> the<00:01:24.210> bigger<00:01:24.420> square<00:01:24.810> equals<00:01:25.320> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
right and the bigger square equals the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.380 
right and the bigger square equals the
volume<00:01:25.830> of<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.130> two<00:01:26.280> smaller<00:01:26.520> squares<00:01:26.820> that's

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
volume of the two smaller squares that's

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:28.640 
volume of the two smaller squares that's
it<00:01:27.659> and<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:27.840> course<00:01:28.049> we<00:01:28.200> use<00:01:28.380> all<00:01:28.530> this

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it and of course we use all this

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.170 
it and of course we use all this
numerology<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.700> use<00:01:29.880> words<00:01:30.119> like

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
numerology and use words like

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.480 
numerology and use words like
Pythagorean<00:01:30.990> theorem<00:01:31.350> right<00:01:31.560> they<00:01:32.009> use<00:01:32.189> words

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
Pythagorean theorem right they use words

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.310 
Pythagorean theorem right they use words
that<00:01:32.640> are<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.450> Greek<00:01:33.720> to<00:01:33.750> me<00:01:33.900> right<00:01:34.200> well

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
that are it's all Greek to me right well

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.880 
that are it's all Greek to me right well
they<00:01:34.380> use<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.560> Greek<00:01:34.799> right<00:01:34.979> so<00:01:35.369> anyhow<00:01:36.890> there's

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
they use a Greek right so anyhow there's

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.190 
they use a Greek right so anyhow there's
actually<00:01:38.310> a<00:01:38.340> cult<00:01:38.790> of<00:01:39.000> Pythagoras<00:01:39.840> right<00:01:40.079> what

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
actually a cult of Pythagoras right what

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.260 
actually a cult of Pythagoras right what
happened<00:01:40.350> in<00:01:40.650> ancient<00:01:40.860> Greece<00:01:41.280> was<00:01:41.909> this<00:01:42.119> kind

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
happened in ancient Greece was this kind

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.550 
happened in ancient Greece was this kind
of<00:01:42.360> information<00:01:42.540> was<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.140> known<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.380> the

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
of information was not known to the

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
of information was not known to the
public<00:01:43.880> so<00:01:44.880> it<00:01:45.720> was<00:01:45.869> kind<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.229> an

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
public so it was kind of like an

it's<00:02:04.799> how<00:02:04.890> our<00:02:04.979> universe<00:02:05.130> works<00:02:05.490> right<00:02:05.729> and<00:02:06.090> if

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it's how our universe works right and if

because<00:03:33.819> if<00:03:34.180> it<00:03:34.299> woman<00:03:34.509> knows<00:03:34.659> what<00:03:34.840> gold<00:03:35.139> is

00:03:35.309 --> 00:03:35.319 
because if it woman knows what gold is

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:37.770 
because if it woman knows what gold is
and<00:03:35.560> has<00:03:35.680> gold<00:03:36.129> jewelry<00:03:36.579> that's<00:03:37.419> kind<00:03:37.659> of<00:03:37.720> a

this<00:05:51.190> great<00:05:51.400> invention<00:05:51.550> but<00:05:52.270> the<00:05:52.389> guy<00:05:52.569> who<00:05:52.630> is

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:52.840 
this great invention but the guy who is

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.689 
this great invention but the guy who is
snuffed<00:05:53.199> out<00:05:53.409> right<00:05:54.060> so<00:05:55.060> I'm<00:05:55.360> just<00:05:55.539> saying<00:05:55.750> is

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
snuffed out right so I'm just saying is

00:05:56.699 --> 00:06:00.360 
snuffed out right so I'm just saying is
that<00:05:57.699> I<00:05:57.969> think<00:05:58.870> right<00:05:59.319> now<00:05:59.500> you<00:05:59.560> know<00:05:59.889> that

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:00.370 
that I think right now you know that

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:02.070 
that I think right now you know that
kind<00:06:00.580> of<00:06:00.669> thing<00:06:00.729> is<00:06:00.909> probably<00:06:01.060> hard<00:06:01.360> to<00:06:01.419> do<00:06:01.690> but

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:02.080 
kind of thing is probably hard to do but

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:04.589 
kind of thing is probably hard to do but
I<00:06:02.139> think<00:06:02.409> with<00:06:02.530> it<00:06:02.560> within<00:06:02.919> every<00:06:03.310> cult<00:06:03.610> you

00:06:04.589 --> 00:06:04.599 
I think with it within every cult you

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:07.740 
I think with it within every cult you
have<00:06:04.930> an<00:06:05.409> agenda<00:06:06.400> and<00:06:06.729> you<00:06:06.909> have<00:06:07.210> certain

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:07.750 
have an agenda and you have certain

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:09.839 
have an agenda and you have certain
things<00:06:07.900> you<00:06:08.080> can't<00:06:08.289> violate<00:06:08.800> right<00:06:09.159> and<00:06:09.610> I

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
things you can't violate right and I

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:11.070 
things you can't violate right and I
think<00:06:10.090> if<00:06:10.180> you<00:06:10.300> want<00:06:10.479> to<00:06:10.539> really<00:06:10.690> increase

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
think if you want to really increase

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.719 
think if you want to really increase
your<00:06:11.380> wealth<00:06:11.560> you<00:06:11.979> have<00:06:12.250> to<00:06:12.460> distance

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:12.729 
your wealth you have to distance

00:06:12.729 --> 00:06:14.969 
your wealth you have to distance
yourself<00:06:13.180> from<00:06:13.240> all<00:06:13.599> Colts<00:06:14.110> just<00:06:14.770> like<00:06:14.889> the

00:06:14.969 --> 00:06:14.979 
yourself from all Colts just like the

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.559 
yourself from all Colts just like the
Pythagorean<00:06:15.699> cult<00:06:15.969> could<00:06:16.180> teach<00:06:16.300> you<00:06:16.419> about

00:06:16.559 --> 00:06:16.569 
Pythagorean cult could teach you about

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:18.480 
Pythagorean cult could teach you about
some<00:06:16.930> of<00:06:17.020> this<00:06:17.110> cool<00:06:17.380> geometry<00:06:18.009> stuff<00:06:18.219> right

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:18.490 
some of this cool geometry stuff right

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:20.189 
some of this cool geometry stuff right
when<00:06:19.000> it<00:06:19.120> come<00:06:19.270> to<00:06:19.449> a<00:06:19.479> rational<00:06:19.900> numbers

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
when it come to a rational numbers

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:21.360 
when it come to a rational numbers
doesn't<00:06:20.440> compete<00:06:20.800> with<00:06:20.919> them<00:06:21.069> I<00:06:21.099> don't<00:06:21.250> want

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.370 
doesn't compete with them I don't want

doesn't compete with them I don't want
to<00:06:21.520> hear<00:06:21.669> it<00:06:21.819> so<00:06:22.509> when<00:06:23.199> it<00:06:23.289> comes<00:06:23.560> to<00:06:24.460> hearing

00:06:24.839 --> 00:06:24.849 
to hear it so when it comes to hearing

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:27.689 
to hear it so when it comes to hearing
about<00:06:24.940> the<00:06:25.360> theories<00:06:25.690> of<00:06:25.750> money<00:06:26.110> a<00:06:26.460> lot<00:06:27.460> of

00:06:27.689 --> 00:06:27.699 
about the theories of money a lot of

00:06:27.699 --> 00:06:29.100 
about the theories of money a lot of
