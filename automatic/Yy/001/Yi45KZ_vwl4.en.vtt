00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.970
 and technology and miracles 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.830
 or technology or miracles because I believe 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.180
 that should be asked like this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.920
 technology or miracles for us 

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:29.029
 20th century perhaps for most 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.029
 you are 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:37.520
 it's technology 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:40.910
 for others that is not the minority but the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:44.150
 Most especially the believers 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:46.760
 the ancient texts and sacred texts is 

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:50.720
 miracle but that is the difference between 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:53.480
 technology or miracle but there are things that 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:55.370
 nowadays 21st century we are starting to 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:59.210
 understand 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.040
 and I send a few words of at least 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110
 are written that I have not 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.100
 listened to but they are written like that 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:09.440
 Jesus said that in those 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.930
 Times says in those times 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.479
 in that era in that change from him to that 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.240
 will see or that we have already changed but in 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.670
 that Jesus was like he was prophesying 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.130
 that science would increase 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.250
 nowadays there is a technology that 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.470
 we can only reproduce 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.060
 and you are going to tell me which cristÃ³bal with 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:36.420
 this technology that we can nowadays 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:39.439
 play is very simple holography 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.820
 a holographic image we can 

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:44.820
 reproduce that we can reproduce what 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.850
 we want we can reproduce what 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.189
 we want with a holographic image today 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.180
 in day we can do it if it's a miracle 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:59.509
 nowadays not before then so that they 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:02:03.740
 and those who read that and 

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:06.990
 we can sin and been sin of 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:10.830
 mix the similarity of those things from 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:14.069
 today this seems like those of the 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:17.370
 Theorists of ancestral astronauts 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:19.400
 not that the astronaut theorists 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:23.750
 ancestral 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:26.269
 I mix everything or whatever it is 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.150
 symbology whatever that is so 

00:02:26.269 --> 00:02:30.799
 mix like everything comes from outside not 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.939
 today we're not going to talk about everything coming 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:35.180
 from outside but let's talk about the 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:40.260
 technology in which there was another prophet 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:43.459
 who says he saw a bronze mountain 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:47.330
 and that in that mountain of bronze they left 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:49.740
 four iron cars 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:52.980
 completely 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:57.030
 and you say a bronze mountain and four 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:59.430
 Iron cars and you say good 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.440
 it can be a bronze mountain that 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.750
 it looks like bronze, no, it's not telling 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:05.820
 a mountain that sees something that there was 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:08.250
 seen a bronze mountain and that from there 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:09.700
 four came out and well there appears the 

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.849
 story what 

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:15.519
 that man what he saw was something metal 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:19.680
 and he calls us mountain because he had to be very 

00:03:15.519 --> 00:03:23.440
 big and he called metal cars something that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:26.080
 maybe it was brightening or you could see that 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.000
 It was metal and he called it a car 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.410
 because there were no planes in that 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.080
 then and let us know that they were the 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.310
 cars had a cars cars came out 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.050
 of metal 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.340
 and half the expressions that sometimes 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.830
 many of you do in the 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:42.890
 comments and especially in these cases 

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:45.459
 biblical and miracles and faith and so on 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:51.110
 that are very respectable 

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:53.989
 but there is that I am to see me here I am not 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:55.819
 neutral I who am I speak for all 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.040
 for believers and non-believers 

00:03:55.819 --> 00:04:00.019
 because because if I were now in 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.060
 a pulpit in a church would speak 

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.190
 believers and would speak differently if 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:05.840
 I was in a forum for example 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:08.780
 of non-believers because he would talk about another 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:12.709
 way not so as we know an alga 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:16.519
 and a mass of people and that we believe and not 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:18.680
 we believe and such because it is one of the 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.769
 rules of the ethical omil when I 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:24.650
 I was studying homiletics of one of the things 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:27.680
 at the time of speaking in public and so on 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.750
 was that public I know you have then 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:31.490
 It depends on the audience that you have 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:34.100
 who are the people who are going to 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.140
 listening to that is how you have to direct 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.950
 because what is the subject is not in that case 

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:41.420
 the 

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:44.400
 this case when they prepared me for that 

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:46.320
 the family does not 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:49.470
 they are there as if to say that 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:54.440
 elite Satanist one thing is the istas 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:57.330
 the same not the Christianity the 

00:04:54.440 --> 00:05:00.539
 Satanism then all that is what 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.560
 they finish and same that is to return something else 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:07.470
 no but we who think that what 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.990
 same as there is black and white and the same 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:12.030
 that there is good there is bad because it can not 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.389
 exist the good but the sea and can not 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:17.370
 exist justice without mercy 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:20.180
 etcetera etcetera not because it would be all 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:23.180
 a never or would everything be something 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:27.300
 incomprehensible because once I said I 

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:30.570
 someone that justice is evil and 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:33.479
 we all ask for justice all 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.750
 we want to ask for justice and that it be done 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:38.970
 justice and if the universe is fair 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:41.020
 because he's in the world like that because I do not know 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.370
 what etcetera 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:50.020
 I said once or not if it applies 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.449
 justice with a hard hand all of you 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:55.599
 and I would be without arms and anger without 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:58.000
 mouth without legs without tongue because 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.669
 it makes your hand fall your cut that you 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.849
 It makes the eye fall you pulled it out 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.470
 does what you talk makes you any 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:07.060
 thing because we are going to exercise justice 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:09.039
 this cut the tongue is more we will be 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.849
 all dead because we would not deserve 

00:06:09.039 --> 00:06:14.919
 live because I say this because I say this 

00:06:12.849 --> 00:06:18.490
 because as Jesus said he who is 

00:06:14.919 --> 00:06:22.090
 guiltless is the first stone 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:26.500
 to a woman they were accusing of 

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:28.060
 adulteress and nobody has a stone because 

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.639
 they all looked inside no son no 

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:32.680
 if you exercise that justice you have got 

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:36.370
 that apply also to me by much 

00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:40.040
 hide it and have it hidden and the 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:43.250
 justice without mercy 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:46.940
 it would be nothing is in the other leg that 

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:50.360
 Needless life and many like saying 

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:52.490
 one of the proverbs that the sun rises 

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:54.620
 both for the just and for the 

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.600
 unfair people acted the good and the bad 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.860
 unfortunately the good and the bad 

00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:03.860
 breathe this air of the planet and live and 

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.500
 does business and prosper life at 

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:09.689
 bad as the good because because there 

00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:13.289
 something called mercy what is 

00:07:09.689 --> 00:07:15.959
 it is undeserved grace that is how it is 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:18.299
 mentioned in many moments of the 

00:07:15.959 --> 00:07:20.759
 cabalistic philosophy etcetera and about 

00:07:18.299 --> 00:07:24.479
 everything that jesus applied I 

00:07:20.759 --> 00:07:27.269
 I understand this is my way of seeing 

00:07:24.479 --> 00:07:29.309
 things do not or before asking 

00:07:27.269 --> 00:07:30.599
 justice I sometimes have to look is 

00:07:29.309 --> 00:07:32.249
 that I'm going to take off I'm also guilty of 

00:07:30.599 --> 00:07:34.319
 many things not to be there I will not be that 

00:07:32.249 --> 00:07:37.309
 that I fall also here by 

00:07:34.319 --> 00:07:40.319
 reason or done thank you very much friends 

00:07:37.309 --> 00:07:44.009
 many many many thanks we say hello 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:45.689
 Everyone from a strong hug I love you 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:46.589
 a lot and see you in the next 

00:07:45.689 --> 00:07:49.159
 video 

00:07:46.589 --> 00:07:49.159
 bye 

00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.480
 through the demonstration maybe the 

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:01.360
 research allows alenia so much 

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:04.080
 monster of many heads rule the 

00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:04.080
 world maingot
