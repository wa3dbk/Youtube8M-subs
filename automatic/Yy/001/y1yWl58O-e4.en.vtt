00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:17.689
 hello people how is this mode paulo and 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.320
 today I bring you a new video I bring you 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.839
 the most interesting template and more 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.359
 powerful according to what I was seeing in the 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.310
 america cup I'm using the four 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:30.529
 countries that went to the semifinal and 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:34.579
 we use Argentina in its great base 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:36.920
 chile perú and paraguay bueno let's go to 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.280
 show the template I wanted to play 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.879
 again the tournament of all 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:45.769
 gold but for the archer in the only 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:47.660
 silver that he was using could not well 

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:50.839
 I was playing there I put a couple of 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.300
 goals or goals in which I am 

00:00:50.839 --> 00:00:54.920
 making the only matches online like this 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.070
 that nothing shows them the template of a 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.070
 time 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.630
 in the arch we have rosemary rosemary that 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.330
 has proven to be a very good archer 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.930
 skillful to tackle the penalties so good 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.330
 we have the owner we have red like 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.740
 central defense 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.780
 Rodriguez that is true that he is not in 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.850
 list 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.220
 I wanted to give a little color to the 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.740
 template but on the other hand I had to 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.520
 do chemistry with the players that 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.990
 they know that I always upload template 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:31.320
 technique and that everyone has a good 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.930
 minimum 7 chemistry so I needed 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.550
 someone from italy and needed it to be 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:40.920
 Argentinian or Chilean so that there 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:42.650
 chemistry and reach 100 but there was not in 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:46.520
 the game 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.180
 from the series and good from other countries 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.220
 not so so the only thing left was 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:53.930
 do this central well or lower the 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.670
 chemistry so good we are using 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.310
 this central there is no problem 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.190
 we have left a helmet that is 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.980
 of the league of argentina that is inside 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:05.660
 of those on the list of Argentines 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.000
 we have vidal who is doing a 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:10.850
 good match a good fight a good 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.340
 tournament has three goals is one of the 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:15.170
 goleadores of the america cup we have the 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.420
 half obviously mamés and we had to 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:21.290
 have a great desire already di maríados 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:24.140
 great not and vidal that in this case then 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.450
 it would be a kind of msb not having in 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.940
 account that goes up a lot month and goes up a lot 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.450
 de maría by right alexis sanchez who 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:34.100
 I would like that a little more 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.990
 to give a lot more is a great 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.630
 player so I assume that in this 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:40.580
 match that continues today 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.950
 should be performing well 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:45.080
 against Peru we have left to 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.280
 Peruvian Juan Vargas who was in charge 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.670
 to give even more 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.400
 not a center but a pass-goal to paolo 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:53.959
 warrior and do the first against 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.569
 bolivia 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:58.520
 vargas that has a good foot the truth 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:01.040
 is that neither is food a 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:04.190
 good player but good there strata let's go 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.020
 to do the chemistry and try to use the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.840
 as many countries as possible and 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:11.840
 well in tip we have the kun aguero a 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.970
 grandfather that generates good chemistry have in 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.010
 account then alexis sanchez I have in 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.680
 account the nationality we put a 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:21.840
 Argentine coach and we change the league 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.360
 Italian to generate in the chemical 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.160
 within the alternates so to speak 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.170
 it would take all of them really 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:31.019
 I would like to put many more but good 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:33.510
 I can not this is the reservation and the 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:36.390
 substitutes were changing but almost 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.549
 always use the same change we have 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.180
 then the substitutes we have to bravo 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:43.620
 bravo that is a good archer used to take out 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.540
 to rosemary and put fertilizer now 

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.340
 constantly making changes me 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.310
 I would have liked to put bravo 

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:53.730
 maybe not from owner obviously because 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:56.430
 it's a top but for a chemistry subject there 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:58.769
 could not fernandez with his 5 skills that 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.340
 you know I like that a lot 

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:06.420
 santacruz forward of paraguay we have 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:09.000
 pizarro pastors have to Bayern 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.300
 forced by right and we have a cheek 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.570
 who is a great great great player 

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:18.540
 they are going to see there is a play where he has 

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:21.959
 a lot of physical power even if you say 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:25.650
 64 and has is very fast so I 

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.200
 seems to me this player seems excellent 

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:31.350
 I used it on the left I did not take vargas 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.420
 and came in cheek we have before we have 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:36.690
 to billiards another great archer who has 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:39.780
 demonstrated paraguay zambrano that is a 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:41.730
 great defense last I would have liked to 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.100
 owner to zambrano but for a theme of 

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:47.250
 chemistry is in the bundesliga is said 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.240
 that would come to the series a and you'll see 

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.710
 the other of a player and otamendi 

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:54.840
 he said again I would have liked to put 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.300
 many more players but I do not have 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.970
 the possibility of adding more and nothing 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.190
 let's go with some plays I hope that they 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.900
 like this template can make it the 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:06.660
 true that it is not that it is so expensive 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:09.060
 except for per month and that almost all 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:11.730
 they have all lowered the price a lot 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:14.880
 almost some those minimums so nothing 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:17.100
 I hope you try the template we will see 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.930
 a few plays more goals 

00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:22.040

00:05:18.930 --> 00:05:22.040
 liked subscribe to the channel 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.450
