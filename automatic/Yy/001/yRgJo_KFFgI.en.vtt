00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
then the following turn just do it you

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.540 
then the following turn just do it you
not<00:02:51.210> I<00:02:51.240> mean<00:02:51.480> like<00:02:51.740> he<00:02:52.740> has<00:02:52.860> to<00:02:53.040> rewind<00:02:53.370> up

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:53.550 
not I mean like he has to rewind up

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:55.880 
not I mean like he has to rewind up
factory<00:02:54.060> and<00:02:54.270> he<00:02:54.750> has<00:02:54.960> two<00:02:55.260> copies<00:02:55.470> of<00:02:55.770> duality

factory and he has two copies of duality

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:58.580 
factory and he has two copies of duality
so<00:02:56.190> it's<00:02:56.430> not<00:02:56.610> really<00:02:57.030> necessary<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:58.320> play

00:02:58.580 --> 00:02:58.590 
so it's not really necessary to play

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.560 
so it's not really necessary to play
three<00:02:58.980> copies<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.490> magician<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.000> mean<00:03:00.150> chances

gonna get at least a couple of searches

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.370 
gonna get at least a couple of searches
out<00:03:08.520> of<00:03:08.790> Factory<00:03:09.270> so<00:03:09.450> it's<00:03:09.600> not<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:09.900> he<00:03:10.110> can't

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380 
out of Factory so it's not like he can't

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:13.100 
out of Factory so it's not like he can't
get<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.830> the<00:03:11.400> magician<00:03:11.880> sharp<00:03:12.150> play<00:03:12.390> fairly

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:15.210 
easily the fact that he was running

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:17.780 
easily the fact that he was running
snowman<00:03:15.960> was<00:03:16.350> something<00:03:16.980> that<00:03:17.010> I<00:03:17.130> thought<00:03:17.610> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
snowman was something that I thought the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:20.390 
snowman was something that I thought the
deck<00:03:18.000> was<00:03:18.360> going<00:03:18.660> to<00:03:18.750> do<00:03:18.920> thunder<00:03:19.920> Kings<00:03:20.190> in

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
deck was going to do thunder Kings in

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.700 
deck was going to do thunder Kings in
the<00:03:20.610> main<00:03:20.760> obviously<00:03:21.420> he<00:03:22.140> wanted<00:03:22.440> to<00:03:22.560> have

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:22.710 
the main obviously he wanted to have

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.070 
the main obviously he wanted to have
that<00:03:22.860> same<00:03:23.250> lockdown<00:03:23.760> ability<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.780> other

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:25.080 
that same lockdown ability that other

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:26.900 
that same lockdown ability that other
decks<00:03:25.440> are<00:03:25.590> going<00:03:25.830> up<00:03:25.980> against<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.340> mean<00:03:26.490> you

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
decks are going up against I mean you

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:28.550 
decks are going up against I mean you
have<00:03:27.120> decks<00:03:27.420> in<00:03:27.600> the<00:03:27.660> format<00:03:28.080> that<00:03:28.110> aren't

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
have decks in the format that aren't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.230 
have decks in the format that aren't
going<00:03:28.740> to<00:03:28.860> be<00:03:28.950> running<00:03:29.280> snow<00:03:29.610> maneater

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:30.240 
going to be running snow maneater

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:32.180 
going to be running snow maneater
but<00:03:30.660> still<00:03:30.930> get<00:03:31.110> messed<00:03:31.380> up<00:03:31.530> by<00:03:31.680> Thunder<00:03:32.010> King

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.430 
the rest of the debt for the most part
looks<00:04:44.490> pretty<00:04:44.759> standard<00:04:45.360> I<00:04:45.690> just<00:04:46.259> I<00:04:46.379> think

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
looks pretty standard I just I think

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.260 
looks pretty standard I just I think
that<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.009> is<00:04:47.280> going<00:04:47.580> to<00:04:47.699> be<00:04:47.849> the<00:04:48.030> way<00:04:48.240> that

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
that this is going to be the way that

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.330 
that this is going to be the way that
wind-ups<00:04:49.020> is<00:04:49.199> constructed<00:04:49.830> when<00:04:49.949> I<00:04:49.979> look<00:04:50.220> at

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
wind-ups is constructed when I look at

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.540 
wind-ups is constructed when I look at
the<00:04:50.520> twelve<00:04:50.849> traps<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.599> see<00:04:52.379> a<00:04:52.409> deck<00:04:52.740> that<00:04:53.039> it

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:53.550 
the twelve traps I see a deck that it

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:55.790 
the twelve traps I see a deck that it
can<00:04:53.729> explode<00:04:54.090> off<00:04:54.300> of<00:04:54.479> two<00:04:54.629> cards<00:04:55.080> it<00:04:55.349> can<00:04:55.620> lock

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
can explode off of two cards it can lock

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.040 
can explode off of two cards it can lock
you<00:04:55.949> down<00:04:55.979> but<00:04:56.819> now<00:04:57.000> you<00:04:57.060> have<00:04:57.509> to<00:04:57.659> fight<00:04:57.840> back

00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.050 
you down but now you have to fight back

00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.809 
you down but now you have to fight back
row<00:04:58.259> against<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.770> and<00:04:58.919> it's<00:04:59.069> just<00:04:59.159> bike<00:04:59.490> man

00:04:59.809 --> 00:04:59.819 
row against it and it's just bike man

00:04:59.819 --> 00:05:02.210 
row against it and it's just bike man
windup<00:05:00.270> so<00:05:00.419> I<00:05:00.449> looking<00:05:00.750> really<00:05:01.259> really<00:05:01.830> scary

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
windup so I looking really really scary

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.670 
windup so I looking really really scary
so<00:05:02.460> I<00:05:02.789> think<00:05:03.240> that<00:05:03.539> there<00:05:03.720> are<00:05:03.750> a<00:05:03.810> class<00:05:04.139> in

00:05:04.670 --> 00:05:04.680 
so I think that there are a class in

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.140 
so I think that there are a class in
their<00:05:04.949> own<00:05:05.159> right<00:05:05.520> now<00:05:05.669> or<00:05:05.880> they're<00:05:06.000> in<00:05:06.090> a

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:06.150 
their own right now or they're in a

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.909 
their own right now or they're in a
class<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.539> their<00:05:06.599> own<00:05:06.720> I<00:05:07.110> think<00:05:07.169> that<00:05:07.680> when

00:05:07.909 --> 00:05:07.919 
class of their own I think that when

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:09.170 
class of their own I think that when
love<00:05:08.069> balls<00:05:08.340> come<00:05:08.610> out<00:05:08.759> it<00:05:08.909> might<00:05:09.000> be

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:09.180 
love balls come out it might be

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:12.080 
love balls come out it might be
different<00:05:09.599> because<00:05:09.690> I<00:05:10.110> see<00:05:10.949> a<00:05:10.979> quasar<00:05:11.759> being<00:05:12.030> a

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
different because I see a quasar being a

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.149 
different because I see a quasar being a
serious<00:05:12.389> problem<00:05:12.569> for<00:05:12.750> wine<00:05:13.050> ups<00:05:13.289> but<00:05:13.530> right

00:05:14.149 --> 00:05:14.159 
serious problem for wine ups but right

00:05:14.159 --> 00:05:15.890

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:15.900 
now definitely the best deck of the

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.290 
now definitely the best deck of the
floor<00:05:16.080> map<00:05:16.259> his<00:05:16.530> bill<00:05:16.800> was<00:05:17.130> definitely<00:05:18.120> good
