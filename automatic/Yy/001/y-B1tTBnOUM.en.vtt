 are well armed against climate change

 plant when I grow up 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.620
 become a legal teacher and the 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.900
 Teach other children 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:03.640
 there were already over 1000 children here and 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.250
 it will be several thousand more 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:07.780
 because only when you experience positive than 

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.500
 young person can be positive 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:10.810
 pass on 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.989
 so it's really nice that it is 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:12.989
