00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:09.030
 hello my name is gabriel 's team and this 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.019
 is our third video how to solve the 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.990
 Magic cube 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.299
 in this video our intention is to make the 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.430
 white side but only repair 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.810
 it's not any side it has all the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.150
 sides 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.529
 We call this a layer 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.260
 so our intention in this video is to make 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.470
 the white layer to make the layer 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.080
 white we will use the movement a 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.600
 name like see how it will do 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.500
 remembering our cross ready here 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.050
 down 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.750
 We are going to look for here are quinas 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.219
 fields of white color 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.050
 we will look for example any 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:44.149
 corner of white color this one by 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.640
 example 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:49.710
 Seeing the charge here we look at other 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.520
 two colors of the field 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:55.170
 in this case orange and blue and the same 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.910
 a form that does not pass before with the cross 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:00.629
 We will turn the screen upside down. 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.469
 near the two centers of orange and 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.700
 blue 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:07.080
 playing here is not close yet tac 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.320
 blue and red 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.340
 turning again now yes blue orange 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.110
 blue orange and we will always look 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.490
 Pro white we put the white ac on 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.930
 our front 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.580
 quiet to go down no movement is 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.830
 only you look if it was at his 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.960
 right side or not your left side 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.030
 if it is on the right side the movement 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.100
 11 with the right hand is on the side 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.259
 left is movement one by hand 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.880
 left account on our right side 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:42.979
 come recalls a move it out 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:47.119
 up inside 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:49.680
 below and the corner was 7 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.890
 After that, just repeat the vain process. 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.170
 look for another white machine is this 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.310
 here for example white than the others 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.040
 two colors orange green people spin 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.920
 until you find the orange green 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:09.599
 The show did not find it raining orange and 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.080
 People always put the block looking at 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:14.330
 people here in our 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:17.500
 Aquino is on which side to left side 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:24.770
 then the one movement with the left hand 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:27.590
 out up down down 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.590
 and what has been solved 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:34.310
 Let's find one more here, I see. 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.000
 here white and the other two colors green 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:39.220
 red rode the own red yet 

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.489
 did not find 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.410
 I think if you stop in this case you do not have 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.000
 white were in front of you because 

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.769
 The bank is missing up. 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.340
 In this case the panties are missing 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:54.830
 up is the same movement is the movement 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.019
 one only you'll do it three times 

00:02:54.830 --> 00:03:01.940
 so let's make the move 13 

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:06.680
 times out up inside to 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:11.540
 down once out up to 

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:17.150
 inside down twice twice to 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:20.660
 Up the wind down and those that the 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.500
 place already doing each one at a time will 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:26.150
 look for another white corner up here 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:28.459
 You did not find any here in the band at 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:30.440
 love up next to it still low 

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.140
 not ready when this happens 

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:36.100
 if it 's because it has a white machine 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.519
 wrong underneath let's look for a bitch 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.579
 here o 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:43.880
 This is the wrong white spot, when the 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:46.040
 White house is down but wrong to 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.110
 make her put on you too 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:49.670
 need to make a move with any 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:51.260
 Good you want 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.519
 good for example here leaving our 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:04:00.230
 right and make a move once to 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.120
 out up inside down 

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:04.700
 If you stop the machine, you came here to 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.220
 up goes to water 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:10.579
 it is now good that the other two colors 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.670
 blue and red she is lucky already 

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:16.640
 near the red and white blue was to 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.609
 people because he's on top of our 

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:21.760
 right side only make moves with 

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:26.200
 right hand out 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:29.380
 So come on down and we're done. 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:31.210
 the first layer of the magic cube is this 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:34.620
 then people only move 1 and I hope 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.620
 you and us next videos
