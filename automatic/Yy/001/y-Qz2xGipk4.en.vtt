00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.550
 yes his matches on the field at heerenveen no longer counts for weeks 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.269
 lots of talent 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:11.970
 never mind how good it feels 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:14.779
 first competition a fantastic entourage 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.779
 and there to see 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.349
 both play from the very good game and yet a merger with a 3 yes 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.419
 but then you stand that feeling 

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.299
 as long as that is of course a muscle tear vote is of course not good 

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:32.140
 but I have to say that we have shown nice competition for the 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.520
 fans is that whatever they were satisfied afterwards applause got that 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:38.030
 I greatly appreciate it 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.770
 but unfortunately two three points I think he first slow down anyway 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:43.820
 hold the upper hand 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.800
 and that hiding certainly one could shoot me myself also some him 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.190
 one wrong 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.030
 cumbria and the trainer still had us waiting for the next match in the set 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.820
 nevertheless a lot of energy in attacking and 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:00:58.690
 and sit briefly and put pressure on psv 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:02.710
 and they save energy by sinking and waiting for the counter and 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.000
 you saw that with deen 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.450
 yes, a bit like the way in which psv often hits on it last year 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:09.119
 this way 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.300
 wait wait wait almost broken for a goal 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.020
 yes indeed and that is the case again 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
 also with the second goal and 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.080
 what can we say I have I still have 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.720
 there you can blame something that you can blame something in the army because with psv 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.610
 flÃ¶z very beautiful 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:30.469
 yes i think i just can't join a shooting club 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:31.380
 but 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.670
 Anyway I think it makes me laugh a bit and whoever thinks she is 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.380
 certainly the first goal whatever it was optimistic and it was too many people 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.300
 for the ball 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:45.790
 ball loss and she runs a height was robbery situation that was had 4 to three 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.840
 and they just do that neatly and nicely straight away 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.210
 the hague i think there should be something on top of those situations 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.790
 If it were you a surprise that you would play today 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.320
 That is what this tells the app can be a week ago 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:04.799
 for us it was clear that the match selection against malaga 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.010
 or played art marjoke 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.249
 that shares the pg spread 

00:02:09.249 --> 00:02:12.519
 nice and safe to be played in the eye you are empty-handed 

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.349
 and we look ahead for that, I think it is also a nice competition for itself 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:17.559
 to prepare 

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.979
 yes indeed very good opponent 

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:22.969
 and let me show you 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.249
 With that, it would be a nice way for the public to look at you 

00:02:26.249 --> 00:02:28.200
 also played pretty well and that anyway 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.319
 fries immediately the riaa how does that feel 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.699
 yes but that of course annoying if you lose 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.999
 yes what you say is good for each other and for cooking 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:38.530
 all it all good the 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.379
 well for each other i think we were imminent 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.849
 not many opportunities but 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:45.609
 well i say threatening then the psv that was one 

00:02:45.609 --> 00:02:48.349
 there is not much to know yet 

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.089
 supporting Janus 

00:02:50.089 --> 00:02:53.300
 then you talk about it and then those types of psv say that 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.019
 when the weather is not so many people 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.569
 they don't get so nervous because they know the chance will eventually come 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:02:59.549
 a 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:01.949
 we went to live with the analysts 

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:05.109
 yes very sloppy I think I already have losses and 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.289
 there is of course possible 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.939
 Loss in midfield one after they do it with the tone for the second 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:13.369
 half and 

00:03:13.369 --> 00:03:16.799
 yes then the first goal finally falls and 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:20.099
 years even hours because you had control in a bad game and then 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:22.259
 get it anyway 

00:03:22.259 --> 00:03:26.119
 but all are actually well back a lot of choirs looked at it 

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:27.810
 the side and ultimately 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.609
 now there is a change in stones in the names 

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:33.719
 but you actually have the good feeling back 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.730
 yes then you think from a to a now we will continue or a point will be removed 

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:39.079
 to get 

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.539
 yes in the end it failed to 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:45.519
 Toivonen immediately gets a long ball touched to his chest and runs through one 

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:49.980
 yes he shoots one of he came five thermometers went another action 

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:50.909
 inside and 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.779
 yes that is two people one never one the last story I think one 

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:56.929
 we want if they try and 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:00.219
 already a bit forward and basically gambling 

00:04:00.219 --> 00:04:03.709
 yes that was not in score yet the three yemen 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.339
 yes without borrowing 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.179
 but we can think 

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:10.009
 but also look back on a reasonable match a very good first half 

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.609
 thinks 

00:04:10.609 --> 00:04:11.799
 and then we must 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.729
 but we have to think further with it 

00:04:13.729 --> 00:04:15.639
 positive things have also been done 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:17.930
 yes you can change something yourself 

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:19.669
 Yeah right 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:20.910
 one through 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.390
 the first images that apparently the second half says it's you sloppy 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.840
 that starts the 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.550
 yes those are things you can remove yourself and 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:32.030
 I have a loss of ball which makes the old painful that we might fall 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.980
 yes those are all things that 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:36.249
 we need a better one 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:39.699
 they are a great learning opportunity and also for next time because they are athletes 

00:04:39.699 --> 00:04:40.819
 should be 

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:43.190
 You can of course do that right away because they are the 

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:44.659
 are things that are not good 

00:04:44.659 --> 00:04:48.460
 yes psv a bit slower than even how you get to know it in the video 

00:04:48.459 --> 00:04:51.239
 then you have to be careful because they get stronger and we get more opportunities 

00:04:51.239 --> 00:04:52.779
 you have to arm us 

00:04:52.779 --> 00:04:56.180
 but yes you feel full of course well eleventh 

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.330
 well then 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:00.720
 yes the rear axle we played a lot of power of course by playing like this 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:03.279
 I think everyone was short of it 

00:05:03.279 --> 00:05:07.789
 yes the second half you will notice that you want this to come out of the dressing room 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:09.610
 that does not go entirely in the expected names 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.569
 you can feel it a bit that it comes to us and maybe a little less 

00:05:12.569 --> 00:05:13.000
 a 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000
 that psv anyway what we do more dangerous in a threatening tone 

00:05:17.449 --> 00:05:19.020
 in the end 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.199
 tess psv sun will have to say 

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.840
 but it is nevertheless goals part for creating opportunities maybe such a whole 

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:27.659
 play a good match 

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.349
 that is psv now knew in advance so that is also possible 

00:05:30.349 --> 00:05:30.959
 quality
