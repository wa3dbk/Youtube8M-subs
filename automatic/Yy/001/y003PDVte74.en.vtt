00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:01.500 
all right folks this time I'd like to

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.110 
all right folks this time I'd like to
talk<00:00:01.680> about<00:00:01.800> something<00:00:02.129> that<00:00:02.310> experienced

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
talk about something that experienced

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.869 
talk about something that experienced
hand<00:00:03.330> gun<00:00:03.480> shooters<00:00:03.870> already<00:00:04.410> know<00:00:04.589> but<00:00:05.160> that

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
hand gun shooters already know but that

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.880 
hand gun shooters already know but that
I<00:00:05.910> still<00:00:06.420> see<00:00:06.660> quite<00:00:07.080> often<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.440> video<00:00:07.620> games

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
I still see quite often in video games

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.669 
I still see quite often in video games
one<00:00:08.490> recent<00:00:09.059> example<00:00:09.150> would<00:00:09.690> be<00:00:09.719> nether<00:00:10.080> where

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
one recent example would be nether where

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.160 
one recent example would be nether where
I<00:00:10.710> saw<00:00:11.040> that<00:00:11.219> and<00:00:11.540> so<00:00:12.540> this<00:00:12.719> is<00:00:12.840> kind<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.080> a

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
I saw that and so this is kind of a

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.379 
I saw that and so this is kind of a
video<00:00:13.320> for<00:00:13.679> video<00:00:13.950> game<00:00:14.190> designers<00:00:14.820> and<00:00:14.849> for

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
video for video game designers and for

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.779 
video for video game designers and for
those<00:00:15.540> who<00:00:15.750> are<00:00:15.839> new<00:00:16.080> to<00:00:16.320> handguns<00:00:17.130> right<00:00:17.640> now

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:17.789 
those who are new to handguns right now

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:19.910 
those who are new to handguns right now
I<00:00:17.820> don't<00:00:18.119> own<00:00:18.359> any<00:00:18.660> I<00:00:18.779> only<00:00:19.050> have<00:00:19.350> rifles<00:00:19.619> and

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
I don't own any I only have rifles and

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.160 
I don't own any I only have rifles and
shotguns<00:00:20.160> but<00:00:20.730> this<00:00:21.180> air<00:00:21.390> pistol<00:00:21.810> will<00:00:21.960> do

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:22.170 
shotguns but this air pistol will do

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.439 
shotguns but this air pistol will do
same<00:00:22.949> fundamentals<00:00:23.609> it's<00:00:23.880> really<00:00:24.119> just<00:00:24.210> about

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
same fundamentals it's really just about

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.439 
same fundamentals it's really just about
the<00:00:24.539> grip<00:00:24.830> what<00:00:25.830> I<00:00:25.859> quote<00:00:26.099> but<00:00:26.490> often<00:00:26.760> see<00:00:27.180> in

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
the grip what I quote but often see in

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.150 
the grip what I quote but often see in
movies<00:00:27.779> and<00:00:27.900> video<00:00:28.080> games<00:00:28.320> instead<00:00:28.650> they<00:00:28.830> hold

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
movies and video games instead they hold

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.510 
movies and video games instead they hold
it<00:00:29.340> pretty<00:00:29.820> far<00:00:30.210> down<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.929> of<00:00:31.769> course<00:00:32.160> another

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
it pretty far down and of course another

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.580 
it pretty far down and of course another
thing<00:00:32.700> that<00:00:33.149> really<00:00:33.630> is<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.899> pet<00:00:34.110> peeve<00:00:34.380> of<00:00:34.530> mine

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
thing that really is a pet peeve of mine

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.000 
thing that really is a pet peeve of mine
is<00:00:35.070> when<00:00:36.030> they<00:00:36.149> always<00:00:36.510> show<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.530> finger<00:00:37.829> on

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
is when they always show the finger on

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.340 
is when they always show the finger on
the<00:00:38.160> trigger<00:00:38.309> you're<00:00:38.969> not<00:00:39.360> supposed<00:00:39.870> to<00:00:40.110> do

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
the trigger you're not supposed to do

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:43.280 
the trigger you're not supposed to do
this<00:00:40.649> I<00:00:40.860> only<00:00:41.100> do<00:00:41.579> that<00:00:41.879> for<00:00:42.300> demonstration

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
this I only do that for demonstration

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.000 
this I only do that for demonstration
you<00:00:44.570> are<00:00:45.570> supposed<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.140> always<00:00:46.649> keep<00:00:46.950> your

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you are supposed to always keep your

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.979 
you are supposed to always keep your
finger<00:00:47.550> out<00:00:47.730> of<00:00:47.789> the<00:00:48.090> trigger<00:00:48.210> guard<00:00:48.780> until

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
finger out of the trigger guard until

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.270 
finger out of the trigger guard until
you're<00:00:49.500> ready<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> shoot

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
you're ready to shoot

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.090 
you're ready to shoot
it's<00:00:50.579> basic<00:00:51.149> firearm<00:00:51.809> safety<00:00:52.079> you're<00:00:52.739> not

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
it's basic firearm safety you're not

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.790 
it's basic firearm safety you're not
supposed<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.789> do<00:00:54.000> this<00:00:54.030> again<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.989> not<00:00:55.020> do<00:00:55.559> this

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
supposed to do this again do not do this

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.180 
supposed to do this again do not do this
it's<00:00:56.039> just<00:00:56.129> for<00:00:56.610> demonstration<00:00:57.350> so<00:00:58.350> this<00:00:59.070> is

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
it's just for demonstration so this is

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.490 
it's just for demonstration so this is
what<00:00:59.370> you<00:00:59.460> very<00:00:59.760> often<00:01:00.059> see<00:01:00.210> they<00:01:01.140> were<00:01:01.199> very

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
what you very often see they were very

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.490 
what you very often see they were very
low<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:02.100> problem<00:01:02.730> with<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:04.290> higher

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
low the problem with that is the higher

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.710 
low the problem with that is the higher
the<00:01:04.530> bore<00:01:04.920> axis<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.760> more<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.270> have<00:01:06.390> to<00:01:06.450> deal

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
the bore axis the more you have to deal

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.679 
the bore axis the more you have to deal
with<00:01:06.869> muzzle<00:01:07.200> flip<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:09.299> reason<00:01:09.540> for<00:01:09.630> that

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
with muzzle flip and the reason for that

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.420 
with muzzle flip and the reason for that
is<00:01:10.049> as<00:01:11.000> the<00:01:12.000> recoil<00:01:12.450> kicks<00:01:12.900> in<00:01:13.170> so<00:01:13.860> as<00:01:14.100> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
is as the recoil kicks in so as the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.870 
is as the recoil kicks in so as the
bullet<00:01:15.180> is<00:01:15.270> leaving<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.990> barrel<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.590> have

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880 
bullet is leaving the barrel you have

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.969 
bullet is leaving the barrel you have
equal<00:01:17.880> force<00:01:18.240> pushing<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.200> so<00:01:19.560> if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.710> hold

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
equal force pushing back so if you hold

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.469 
equal force pushing back so if you hold
it<00:01:20.070> very<00:01:20.220> low<00:01:20.549> in<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.820> force<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.240> the<00:01:21.330> recoil

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
it very low in the force of the recoil

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.510 
it very low in the force of the recoil
pushes<00:01:22.380> along<00:01:23.310> this<00:01:23.580> line<00:01:24.000> it<00:01:24.619> has<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.920> pivot

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
pushes along this line it has to pivot

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.719 
pushes along this line it has to pivot
there<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.390> course<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.590> pivots<00:01:28.829> more<00:01:29.430> if

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
there of course and it pivots more if

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.760 
there of course and it pivots more if
you're<00:01:30.270> holding<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.750> further<00:01:31.049> down<00:01:31.409> if<00:01:31.619> you're

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
you're holding it further down if you're

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.569 
you're holding it further down if you're
holding<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.250> as<00:01:32.400> high<00:01:33.180> as<00:01:33.210> you<00:01:33.570> can<00:01:34.430> you<00:01:35.430> know

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
holding it as high as you can you know

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.749 
holding it as high as you can you know
the<00:01:35.759> ideal<00:01:36.329> would<00:01:36.659> be<00:01:36.689> if<00:01:37.470> the<00:01:38.159> barrel<00:01:38.579> was

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
the ideal would be if the barrel was

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
the ideal would be if the barrel was
directly<00:01:39.479> in<00:01:39.900> line<00:01:39.960> with<00:01:40.890> your<00:01:40.979> forearm

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
directly in line with your forearm

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.249 
directly in line with your forearm
because<00:01:41.880> then<00:01:42.060> it<00:01:42.150> would<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.420> straight<00:01:42.930> back

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
because then it would go straight back

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:45.260 
because then it would go straight back
and<00:01:43.590> then<00:01:44.040> you<00:01:44.100> would<00:01:44.250> have<00:01:44.399> no<00:01:44.640> muzzle<00:01:45.060> flip

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
and then you would have no muzzle flip

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.990 
and then you would have no muzzle flip
whatsoever<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.140> why<00:01:46.979> is<00:01:47.040> that<00:01:47.130> relevant<00:01:47.549> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
whatsoever and why is that relevant you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.460 
whatsoever and why is that relevant you
may<00:01:48.149> ask<00:01:48.390> well<00:01:49.140> if<00:01:50.240> the<00:01:51.240> muzzle<00:01:51.659> flips<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.290> you

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
may ask well if the muzzle flips up you

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.219 
may ask well if the muzzle flips up you
have<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.649> readjust<00:01:53.570> to<00:01:54.570> get<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.960> sight

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
have to readjust to get the sight

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.219 
have to readjust to get the sight
picture<00:01:55.740> back<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.280> always<00:01:57.000> want<00:01:57.479> the<00:01:57.689> front

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
picture back I always want the front

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.999 
picture back I always want the front
sight<00:01:59.030> to<00:02:00.030> be<00:02:00.479> centered<00:02:01.229> in<00:02:01.350> the<00:02:01.409> rear<00:02:01.680> sight

00:02:01.999 --> 00:02:02.009 
sight to be centered in the rear sight

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:04.789 
sight to be centered in the rear sight
so<00:02:02.579> you<00:02:02.670> can<00:02:02.820> imagine<00:02:02.969> if<00:02:03.360> the<00:02:03.960> recoil<00:02:04.380> goes<00:02:04.590> up

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
so you can imagine if the recoil goes up

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.010 
so you can imagine if the recoil goes up
your<00:02:05.159> sight<00:02:05.460> picture<00:02:05.490> is<00:02:06.030> destroyed<00:02:06.540> and<00:02:06.899> you

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
your sight picture is destroyed and you

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.790 
your sight picture is destroyed and you
have<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:07.290> move<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.160> back<00:02:08.340> down<00:02:08.399> if<00:02:08.879> it<00:02:09.869> were<00:02:10.530> to

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
have to move it back down if it were to

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.890 
have to move it back down if it were to
recoil<00:02:11.340> straight<00:02:11.970> back<00:02:12.330> you<00:02:12.569> could<00:02:12.720> actually

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
recoil straight back you could actually

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.430 
recoil straight back you could actually
may

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
may

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.000 
may
contain<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:13.980> site<00:02:14.220> picture<00:02:14.700> and<00:02:15.710> be<00:02:16.710> quicker

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
contain the site picture and be quicker

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.940 
contain the site picture and be quicker
with<00:02:17.250> follow-up<00:02:17.760> shots<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.960> yeah<00:02:19.680> that<00:02:19.890> would

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
with follow-up shots so yeah that would

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.880 
with follow-up shots so yeah that would
be<00:02:20.010> ideal<00:02:20.720> but<00:02:21.720> in<00:02:21.870> most<00:02:22.080> cases<00:02:22.410> it's<00:02:22.740> not

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:22.890 
be ideal but in most cases it's not

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:24.320 
be ideal but in most cases it's not
possible<00:02:23.430> especially<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:24.300> a

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
possible especially with a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.080 
possible especially with a
semi-automatic<00:02:25.320> handgun<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.910> have<00:02:27.060> a

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
semi-automatic handgun where you have a

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.200 
semi-automatic handgun where you have a
slide<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.630> actually<00:02:28.520> moves<00:02:29.520> back

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
slide that actually moves back

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.440 
slide that actually moves back
so<00:02:30.330> obviously<00:02:31.170> you<00:02:31.470> can't<00:02:31.830> do<00:02:32.040> that<00:02:32.330> but<00:02:33.330> you

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
so obviously you can't do that but you

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.870 
so obviously you can't do that but you
want<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:34.110> be<00:02:34.230> as<00:02:34.410> high<00:02:34.710> as<00:02:34.890> possible<00:02:35.010> and<00:02:35.670> a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
want to be as high as possible and a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.650 
want to be as high as possible and a
grip<00:02:36.570> like<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.010> which<00:02:38.010> is<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:38.850> unlike<00:02:39.120> a

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
grip like this which is not unlike a

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.750 
grip like this which is not unlike a
1911<00:02:40.320> grip<00:02:40.620> by<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:40.980> way<00:02:41.160> in<00:02:41.310> terms<00:02:41.460> of<00:02:41.610> the

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:41.760 
1911 grip by the way in terms of the

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.960 
1911 grip by the way in terms of the
angle<00:02:42.120> the<00:02:42.900> shape<00:02:43.110> here<00:02:43.550> this<00:02:44.550> actually

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
angle the shape here this actually

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.300 
angle the shape here this actually
facilitates<00:02:45.690> a<00:02:45.810> high<00:02:45.990> grip<00:02:46.320> it's<00:02:46.830> the<00:02:47.040> most

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
facilitates a high grip it's the most

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.820 
facilitates a high grip it's the most
comfortable<00:02:47.870> when<00:02:48.870> you're<00:02:49.050> all<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:49.470> way<00:02:49.620> up

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
comfortable when you're all the way up

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.820 
comfortable when you're all the way up
here<00:02:50.390> that's<00:02:51.390> how<00:02:51.990> you<00:02:52.050> want<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:52.500> to<00:02:52.590> be<00:02:53.210> so

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:54.830 
here that's how you want it to be so

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:57.350 
here that's how you want it to be so
especially<00:02:55.830> when<00:02:56.220> I<00:02:56.280> see<00:02:56.580> something<00:02:56.850> like<00:02:57.120> as

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
especially when I see something like as

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.570 
especially when I see something like as
I<00:02:57.390> mentioned<00:02:57.840> never<00:02:58.080> when<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:58.920> see<00:02:59.220> the<00:02:59.370> guy

00:02:59.570 --> 00:02:59.580 
I mentioned never when I see the guy

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.990 
I mentioned never when I see the guy
holding<00:02:59.910> a<00:03:00.500> desert<00:03:01.500> eagle<00:03:01.710> so<00:03:02.460> in<00:03:02.580> other<00:03:02.700> words

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
holding a desert eagle so in other words

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.980 
holding a desert eagle so in other words

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:06.990 
at least 357 Magnum if not 50 which is a

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:09.710 
at least 357 Magnum if not 50 which is a
very<00:03:07.470> powerful<00:03:07.800> caliber<00:03:08.640> that<00:03:09.090> kicks<00:03:09.450> like<00:03:09.660> a

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
very powerful caliber that kicks like a

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.310 
very powerful caliber that kicks like a
mule<00:03:10.580> if<00:03:11.580> I<00:03:11.730> see<00:03:12.000> him<00:03:12.090> hold<00:03:12.360> it<00:03:12.480> like<00:03:12.600> that<00:03:12.630> yeah

mule if I see him hold it like that yeah

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.440 
mule if I see him hold it like that yeah
that's<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.920> don't<00:03:14.130> like<00:03:14.400> that<00:03:14.550> that's<00:03:14.880> just

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
that's I don't like that that's just

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:18.140 
that's I don't like that that's just
kind<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:15.750> ridiculous<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.860> were<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.160> you

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
will just have to fight the recoil like

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.990 
will just have to fight the recoil like
crazy

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
crazy

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.130 
crazy
so<00:03:21.540> as<00:03:22.160> high<00:03:23.160> up<00:03:23.430> as<00:03:23.580> possible<00:03:23.730> folks<00:03:24.390> this<00:03:24.930> is

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
so as high up as possible folks this is

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.090 
so as high up as possible folks this is
how<00:03:25.920> it's<00:03:26.130> supposed<00:03:26.250> to<00:03:26.730> look<00:03:26.850> like<00:03:27.500> this<00:03:28.500> not

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
how it's supposed to look like this not

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.510 
how it's supposed to look like this not
here<00:03:29.610> not<00:03:30.300> here<00:03:30.780> right<00:03:31.470> up<00:03:31.770> there<00:03:32.010> as<00:03:32.190> high<00:03:32.459> as

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:32.520 
here not here right up there as high as

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:35.810 
here not here right up there as high as
it<00:03:32.730> goes<00:03:33.709> and<00:03:34.709> another<00:03:35.010> thing<00:03:35.310> while<00:03:35.550> talking

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
it goes and another thing while talking

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.050 
it goes and another thing while talking
about<00:03:36.030> the<00:03:36.270> grip<00:03:36.830> this<00:03:37.830> here<00:03:38.220> does<00:03:38.670> very

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
about the grip this here does very

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:40.280 
about the grip this here does very
little<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.540> help<00:03:39.690> you

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
little to help you

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:43.130 
little to help you
it<00:03:40.980> does<00:03:41.670> stabilize<00:03:42.269> a<00:03:42.300> little<00:03:42.420> bit<00:03:42.810> but<00:03:42.989> it's

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
it does stabilize a little bit but it's

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.880 
it does stabilize a little bit but it's
not<00:03:43.350> the<00:03:43.500> right<00:03:43.709> way<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.400> hold<00:03:44.580> it<00:03:44.790> it's<00:03:45.890> back

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:46.890 
not the right way to hold it it's back

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.360 
not the right way to hold it it's back
in<00:03:47.100> the<00:03:47.360> 70s<00:03:48.360> you<00:03:48.540> still<00:03:48.900> saw<00:03:49.230> even<00:03:49.980> policemen

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:50.370 
in the 70s you still saw even policemen

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.810 
in the 70s you still saw even policemen
doing<00:03:50.940> this<00:03:51.209> weird<00:03:51.750> kind<00:03:52.050> of<00:03:52.230> thing<00:03:52.410> but<00:03:53.160> it's

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:53.820 
doing this weird kind of thing but it's

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.729 
doing this weird kind of thing but it's
pretty<00:03:54.480> much<00:03:54.630> pointless<00:03:55.050> it<00:03:55.260> doesn't<00:03:55.590> do<00:03:55.709> that

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
pretty much pointless it doesn't do that

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:58.310 
pretty much pointless it doesn't do that
much<00:03:56.130> to<00:03:56.190> stabilize<00:03:57.000> your<00:03:57.690> arm<00:03:57.959> it<00:03:58.140> does

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
much to stabilize your arm it does

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.860 
much to stabilize your arm it does
nothing<00:03:58.920> to<00:03:59.100> help<00:03:59.580> of<00:04:00.440> manage<00:04:01.440> recoil<00:04:02.070> and<00:04:02.870> you

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
nothing to help of manage recoil and you

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.380 
nothing to help of manage recoil and you
still<00:04:04.140> see<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.769> very<00:04:05.250> often<00:04:05.489> in<00:04:05.790> games<00:04:05.940> but<00:04:06.360> I

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:06.390 
still see that very often in games but I

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.540 
still see that very often in games but I
do<00:04:06.480> see<00:04:06.930> that<00:04:06.959> it<00:04:07.440> just<00:04:07.500> tells<00:04:07.950> me<00:04:08.160> that<00:04:08.310> the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
do see that it just tells me that the

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.670 
do see that it just tells me that the
developers<00:04:09.060> didn't<00:04:09.390> bother<00:04:09.680> actually

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
developers didn't bother actually

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.580 
developers didn't bother actually
researching<00:04:11.160> into<00:04:11.810> shooting<00:04:12.810> techniques<00:04:13.380> and

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
researching into shooting techniques and

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:16.580 
researching into shooting techniques and
firearms<00:04:14.100> in<00:04:14.190> general<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:15.239> you<00:04:15.900> actually<00:04:16.260> want

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
firearms in general so you actually want

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.539 
firearms in general so you actually want
to<00:04:16.880> hold<00:04:17.880> it<00:04:18.000> like<00:04:18.180> that<00:04:18.799> because<00:04:19.799> that<00:04:19.830> way

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:20.549 
to hold it like that because that way

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:24.409 
to hold it like that because that way
you<00:04:21.390> actually<00:04:21.510> can<00:04:21.870> actually<00:04:21.900> push<00:04:22.470> here<00:04:23.419> you

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
you actually can actually push here you

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.990 
you actually can actually push here you
can<00:04:24.690> bait<00:04:25.020> or<00:04:25.229> I<00:04:25.440> should<00:04:25.680> say<00:04:25.800> pull<00:04:26.160> actually

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
can bait or I should say pull actually

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.910 
can bait or I should say pull actually
pull<00:04:27.330> with<00:04:27.570> this<00:04:27.810> hand<00:04:28.110> you<00:04:28.290> push<00:04:28.560> with<00:04:28.770> the

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:28.920 
pull with this hand you push with the

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.670 
pull with this hand you push with the
other<00:04:29.100> and<00:04:29.400> that<00:04:30.120> allows<00:04:30.450> you<00:04:30.750> a<00:04:30.780> very<00:04:31.290> firm

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
other and that allows you a very firm

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.640 
other and that allows you a very firm
grip<00:04:32.100> and<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.430> also<00:04:33.210> allows<00:04:33.510> you<00:04:33.750> to<00:04:33.780> manage

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
grip and that also allows you to manage

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.790 
grip and that also allows you to manage
recoil<00:04:35.430> and<00:04:35.730> bring<00:04:36.720> it<00:04:36.840> back<00:04:37.080> on<00:04:37.320> target

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800 
recoil and bring it back on target

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.500 
recoil and bring it back on target
quicker<00:04:38.280> so<00:04:39.320> this<00:04:40.320> is<00:04:41.220> how<00:04:41.910> it's<00:04:42.090> supposed<00:04:42.150> to

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
quicker so this is how it's supposed to

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:44.150 
quicker so this is how it's supposed to
look<00:04:42.720> not<00:04:43.440> like<00:04:43.710> that

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
look not like that

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.390 
look not like that
that<00:04:44.370> doesn't<00:04:44.670> really<00:04:45.060> do<00:04:45.210> much
