00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.300 
vehicle okay let's go for a little Drive
looks<00:00:20.760> like<00:00:20.970> we've<00:00:21.150> got<00:00:21.330> a<00:00:21.359> little<00:00:21.600> bit<00:00:21.869> of

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
looks like we've got a little bit of

summer shower on the way here but that

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.269 
summer shower on the way here but that
will<00:00:25.500> serve<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.340> demonstrate<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:28.279> rain

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
will serve to demonstrate the rain

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.099 
will serve to demonstrate the rain

sensing wipers that come standard on
this<00:00:31.320> vehicle<00:00:31.850> there's<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:32.940> sensor<00:00:33.360> in<00:00:33.480> the

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
this vehicle there's a sensor in the

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.709 
this vehicle there's a sensor in the
windshield<00:00:34.460> and<00:00:35.460> once<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.790> senses<00:00:36.000> rain<00:00:36.420> it

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
windshield and once it senses rain it

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.930 
windshield and once it senses rain it
engages<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.800> wipers<00:00:38.160> and<00:00:38.399> when<00:00:38.610> it<00:00:38.730> stops

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
engages the wipers and when it stops

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.390 
engages the wipers and when it stops
raining<00:00:39.090> the<00:00:39.510> wipers<00:00:40.050> will<00:00:40.200> stop

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:45.400 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.610 

I<00:00:45.430> love<00:00:46.060> the<00:00:46.180> way<00:00:46.330> that<00:00:46.360> math<00:00:46.780> is<00:00:47.080> laid<00:00:47.440> out

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
I love the way that math is laid out

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.490 
I love the way that math is laid out
this<00:00:47.830> -<00:00:48.130> it's<00:00:48.490> very<00:00:48.640> easy<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:49.060> figure<00:00:49.300> out<00:00:49.600> all

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
this - it's very easy to figure out all

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.020 
this - it's very easy to figure out all
the<00:00:50.740> knobs<00:00:50.920> and<00:00:51.130> buttons<00:00:51.220> are<00:00:51.640> different

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:52.030 
the knobs and buttons are different

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.760 
the knobs and buttons are different
sizes<00:00:52.270> and<00:00:52.570> shapes<00:00:52.660> so<00:00:53.200> you<00:00:53.230> can<00:00:53.440> reach<00:00:53.590> over

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:53.770 
sizes and shapes so you can reach over

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.460 
sizes and shapes so you can reach over
feel<00:00:54.190> what<00:00:54.760> it<00:00:54.880> is<00:00:55.000> you<00:00:55.180> need<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.470> adjust

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:56.470 
feel what it is you need to adjust

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.110 
feel what it is you need to adjust
without<00:00:57.430> taking<00:00:57.760> your<00:00:57.790> eyes<00:00:57.970> off<00:00:58.000> the<00:00:58.480> road<00:00:59.170> up

without taking your eyes off the road up
on<00:01:01.120> top<00:01:01.449> you've<00:01:01.750> got<00:01:03.089> outside<00:01:04.089> temperature

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:04.690 
on top you've got outside temperature

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.100 

it<00:01:23.670> looks<00:01:23.880> like<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.210> is<00:01:24.390> turned<00:01:24.630> into<00:01:24.810> quite

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
it looks like this is turned into quite

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.770 
it looks like this is turned into quite
a<00:01:25.230> little<00:01:25.530> downpour<00:01:25.740> but<00:01:26.400> you'll<00:01:27.180> notice<00:01:27.450> what

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
a little downpour but you'll notice what

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.990 
a little downpour but you'll notice what
happens<00:01:28.170> with<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.410> rain<00:01:28.560> sensing<00:01:28.980> wipers<00:01:29.040> is

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
happens with the rain sensing wipers is

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.940 
happens with the rain sensing wipers is
that<00:01:30.300> the<00:01:30.450> harder<00:01:30.810> range<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.440> fast<00:01:31.650> for<00:01:31.890> the

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
that the harder range the fast for the

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.510 
that the harder range the fast for the
wipers<00:01:32.310> go<00:01:32.520> just<00:01:33.450> like<00:01:33.630> you<00:01:33.750> would<00:01:33.900> use

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:34.520 
wipers go just like you would use

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.780 
wipers go just like you would use
manually

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
all these cars have a one touchdown and

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.720 
all these cars have a one touchdown and
a<00:02:14.330> one<00:02:14.480> touch<00:02:14.750> up<00:02:15.050> driver's<00:02:15.680> window<00:02:16.190> so<00:02:16.610> it

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
a one touch up driver's window so it

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.980 
a one touch up driver's window so it
makes<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.030> handy<00:02:17.210> if<00:02:17.480> you're<00:02:17.690> in<00:02:17.870> the
