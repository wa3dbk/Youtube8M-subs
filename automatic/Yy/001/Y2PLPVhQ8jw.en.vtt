on the edge you cannot do a quick rise
off<00:02:22.830> of<00:02:23.010> it<00:02:23.160> but<00:02:23.700> if<00:02:24.000> she<00:02:24.150> does<00:02:24.360> the<00:02:24.510> third<00:02:24.750> one

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050

off of it but if she does the third one
he<00:02:25.680> has<00:02:25.830> all<00:02:26.040> this<00:02:26.190> landing<00:02:26.670> animation<00:02:27.590> keep

he has all this landing animation keep
the<00:02:28.769> third<00:02:29.040> one<00:02:29.340> so<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.269> can<00:02:30.480> land<00:02:30.690> and<00:02:30.930> charge

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
the third one so you can land and charge

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.810 
the third one so you can land and charge
up<00:02:31.380> that<00:02:31.410> fireball<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.100> get<00:02:32.220> a<00:02:32.250> true<00:02:32.580> medium

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
up that fireball and get a true medium

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.780 
up that fireball and get a true medium
and<00:02:33.300> it's<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.890> can't<00:02:35.220> take<00:02:35.400> out<00:02:35.580> of<00:02:35.610> it

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
and it's a you can't take out of it

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:39.530 
and it's a you can't take out of it
that's<00:02:35.970> right<00:02:37.790> and<00:02:38.790> that's<00:02:38.970> kind<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.209> like<00:02:39.300> the

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:39.540 
that's right and that's kind of like the

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:41.509 
that's right and that's kind of like the
basis<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.989> our<00:02:40.140> okie<00:02:40.380> gamers<00:02:40.739> after<00:02:41.040> that<00:02:41.190> and

basis of our okie gamers after that and

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:44.120 
basis of our okie gamers after that and
then<00:02:41.700> she<00:02:41.850> could<00:02:41.970> high-low<00:02:42.420> copy<00:02:43.320> it<00:02:43.530> up<00:02:43.739> and

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
then she could high-low copy it up and

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.729 
then she could high-low copy it up and
he's<00:02:44.400> getting<00:02:44.550> counting<00:02:45.090> equal<00:02:45.390> more<00:02:45.739> just

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
he's getting counting equal more just

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:48.590 
he's getting counting equal more just
off<00:02:46.860> of<00:02:46.890> that<00:02:47.130> sort<00:02:47.400> merge<00:02:47.580> sort<00:02:48.330> although
