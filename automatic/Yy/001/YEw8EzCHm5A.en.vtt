all some do I mean Caspian board is
great<00:01:07.320> I<00:01:07.760> mean<00:01:08.760> on<00:01:08.909> Russia's<00:01:09.420> it's<00:01:10.020> reasonable

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
I don't like Grand Bazaar rush I think

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.550 
I don't like Grand Bazaar rush I think
the<00:01:15.090> first<00:01:15.270> set<00:01:15.450> of<00:01:15.479> em<00:01:15.630> comes<00:01:15.900> can<00:01:16.110> be<00:01:16.200> taken

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the first set of em comes can be taken

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.539 
the first set of em comes can be taken
by<00:01:16.740> too<00:01:16.799> quickly<00:01:17.220> for<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:18.420> attackers<00:01:19.549> there's

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
by too quickly for the attackers there's

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:23.600 
by too quickly for the attackers there's
no<00:01:20.700> real<00:01:20.909> chance<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.900> defend<00:01:22.470> a<00:01:22.710> mere<00:01:22.890> by<00:01:23.340> quick

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
no real chance to defend a mere by quick

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.310 
no real chance to defend a mere by quick
on<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.970> attackers<00:01:27.540> really<00:01:28.110> don't

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
on it and the attackers really don't

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.630 
on it and the attackers really don't
have<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.590> chance<00:01:29.070> on<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.060> last<00:01:30.329> two<00:01:30.960> sets<00:01:31.640> they

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
have a chance on the last two sets they

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:34.429 
have a chance on the last two sets they

going to get any of these mcom stations
well<00:02:49.200> I<00:02:49.290> might<00:02:49.470> get<00:02:49.590> one<00:02:49.800> like<00:02:50.310> they<00:02:50.459> have<00:02:50.610> here

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:50.820

well I might get one like they have here
they've<00:02:51.030> got<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:51.390> that's<00:02:52.290> because<00:02:52.709> we

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:52.860 
they've got one that's because we

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.360 
they've got one that's because we
focused<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.459> be<00:02:54.470> my<00:02:55.470> squad<00:02:55.769> now<00:02:56.010> I've<00:02:56.190> got<00:02:56.340> a

all<00:02:56.880> the<00:02:57.120> boys<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.390> here<00:02:57.720> at<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:57.989> moment<00:02:58.910> think

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
all the boys in here at the moment think

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.640 
all the boys in here at the moment think
of<00:03:00.090> someone's<00:03:00.630> missing<00:03:00.900> I<00:03:01.080> think<00:03:01.320> I<00:03:01.470> think

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
of someone's missing I think I think

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.770 
of someone's missing I think I think
it's<00:03:01.739> a<00:03:01.799> patchy<00:03:02.120> we<00:03:03.120> don't<00:03:03.269> really<00:03:03.540> care

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:03.780 
it's a patchy we don't really care

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:05.270 
it's a patchy we don't really care
though<00:03:03.989> because<00:03:04.200> you<00:03:04.470> know<00:03:04.560> it's<00:03:04.680> him<00:03:04.920> and<00:03:04.950> he

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
though because you know it's him and he

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.990 
though because you know it's him and he
would<00:03:05.400> have<00:03:05.489> been<00:03:05.580> on<00:03:05.700> top<00:03:05.820> of<00:03:05.940> the

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
would have been on top of the

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.340 
would have been on top of the
leaderboard<00:03:06.269> and<00:03:06.540> taken<00:03:06.810> all<00:03:06.900> the<00:03:07.049> glory

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:07.350 
leaderboard and taken all the glory

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:09.050 
leaderboard and taken all the glory
because<00:03:07.799> he's<00:03:08.010> a<00:03:08.040> little<00:03:08.280> fucking<00:03:08.640> freak<00:03:08.940> of

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
because he's a little fucking freak of

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.259 
because he's a little fucking freak of
nature<00:03:10.610> but<00:03:11.610> it<00:03:12.420> is<00:03:12.750> the<00:03:13.760> maps<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.030> the

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:15.269 
nature but it is the maps and the

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.229 
nature but it is the maps and the
players<00:03:15.540> which<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.799> typically<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.579> way<00:03:17.850> you

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
players which is typically the way you

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:21.199 
players which is typically the way you
know<00:03:19.280> first-person<00:03:20.280> shooters<00:03:20.670> go<00:03:20.940> it's

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
know first-person shooters go it's

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.740 
know first-person shooters go it's
always<00:03:21.480> the<00:03:21.630> players<00:03:21.900> that<00:03:22.019> seemed<00:03:22.350> to<00:03:22.380> make

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
always the players that seemed to make

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:26.600 
always the players that seemed to make
the<00:03:24.750> game<00:03:24.959> a<00:03:24.989> little<00:03:25.140> less<00:03:25.500> fun<00:03:25.860> after<00:03:26.370> a<00:03:26.400> while

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
the game a little less fun after a while

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.960 
the game a little less fun after a while
and<00:03:27.600> I'm<00:03:27.810> not<00:03:28.019> bagging<00:03:28.590> on<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.860> game<00:03:29.130> itself<00:03:29.730> I

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
and I'm not bagging on the game itself I

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.850 
and I'm not bagging on the game itself I
do<00:03:30.060> think<00:03:30.510> the<00:03:30.630> mechanics<00:03:30.780> are<00:03:31.230> solid<00:03:31.680> i

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:31.860 
do think the mechanics are solid i

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.780 
do think the mechanics are solid i
reckon<00:03:32.370> they've<00:03:32.519> got<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.790> down<00:03:33.000> nicely<00:03:34.790> the

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
reckon they've got it down nicely the

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.250 
reckon they've got it down nicely the
guns<00:03:36.000> handle<00:03:36.420> pretty<00:03:36.570> well<00:03:36.870> there<00:03:37.140> are<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
guns handle pretty well there are a

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.080 
guns handle pretty well there are a
couple<00:03:37.440> of<00:03:37.620> AP<00:03:37.950> guns<00:03:38.220> I<00:03:38.400> don't<00:03:38.579> like<00:03:38.700> the<00:03:38.850> sky

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090 
couple of AP guns I don't like the sky

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:40.970 
couple of AP guns I don't like the sky
this<00:03:39.329> guard<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.750> very<00:03:40.049> overpowered<00:03:40.590> in<00:03:40.829> my

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
this guard is very overpowered in my

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.880 
this guard is very overpowered in my
mind<00:03:41.250> it<00:03:42.090> does<00:03:42.450> feel<00:03:42.480> like<00:03:42.900> an<00:03:43.049> instant<00:03:43.560> kill

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
mind it does feel like an instant kill

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.940 
mind it does feel like an instant kill
after<00:03:44.820> time<00:03:45.170> and<00:03:47.299> the<00:03:48.299> mp7<00:03:48.600> which<00:03:49.530> I've<00:03:49.920> been

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
after time and the mp7 which I've been

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.330 
after time and the mp7 which I've been
cranking<00:03:50.790> over<00:03:50.940> the<00:03:51.090> last<00:03:51.239> few<00:03:51.450> days<00:03:52.160> if<00:03:53.160> you

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:53.340 
cranking over the last few days if you

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.180 
cranking over the last few days if you
don't<00:03:53.489> have<00:03:53.640> extended<00:03:54.150> mags<00:03:54.950> that<00:03:55.950> thing's

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
don't have extended mags that thing's

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.200 
don't have extended mags that thing's
virtually<00:03:56.670> useless

virtually useless

00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
virtually useless
it's<00:03:58.600> very<00:03:58.810> weak<00:03:59.140> and<00:03:59.440> also<00:04:00.600> 21<00:04:01.600> rounds<00:04:01.960> in<00:04:02.200> the

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:02.230 
it's very weak and also 21 rounds in the

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.640 
it's very weak and also 21 rounds in the
magazine<00:04:02.470> could<00:04:03.160> go<00:04:03.340> in<00:04:03.580> no<00:04:04.360> two<00:04:05.020> seconds<00:04:05.500> you

you're<00:04:05.920> out<00:04:06.130> of<00:04:06.160> ammunition<00:04:06.550> and<00:04:07.330> Daniel

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:07.780 
you're out of ammunition and Daniel

you're out of ammunition and Daniel
pistol<00:04:08.200> and<00:04:08.470> that<00:04:08.590> range<00:04:08.890> you're<00:04:09.250> screwed

which<00:04:11.290> kind<00:04:11.500> of<00:04:11.560> makes<00:04:11.680> a<00:04:11.770> little<00:04:11.890> sense

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:12.100 
which kind of makes a little sense

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:13.740 
which kind of makes a little sense
because<00:04:12.340> the<00:04:12.460> desert<00:04:12.760> you<00:04:13.210> know<00:04:13.330> it's<00:04:13.480> a<00:04:13.540> close

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
because the desert you know it's a close

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:17.490 
because the desert you know it's a close
quarter<00:04:14.050> combat<00:04:14.080> weapon<00:04:14.710> but<00:04:16.260> it<00:04:17.260> just

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
quarter combat weapon but it just

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.060 
quarter combat weapon but it just
doesn't<00:04:18.210> feel<00:04:19.210> right<00:04:19.270> that<00:04:19.480> gun<00:04:19.930> I<00:04:20.170> think<00:04:20.950> they

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
doesn't feel right that gun I think they

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.490 
doesn't feel right that gun I think they
need<00:04:21.250> to<00:04:21.430> either<00:04:22.300> give<00:04:22.540> it<00:04:22.660> a<00:04:22.750> damage<00:04:23.080> boost<00:04:23.350> or

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
need to either give it a damage boost or

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.750 
need to either give it a damage boost or
increase<00:04:23.800> the<00:04:23.920> magazine<00:04:24.370> size<00:04:26.220> 30<00:04:27.220> round<00:04:27.490> mag

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
increase the magazine size 30 round mag

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.840 
increase the magazine size 30 round mag
seems<00:04:28.150> a<00:04:28.210> lot<00:04:28.390> a<00:04:28.630> lot<00:04:29.050> more<00:04:29.260> feasible<00:04:29.850> but

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:30.850 
seems a lot a lot more feasible but

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:32.550 
seems a lot a lot more feasible but

a little tangent again now this is

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.140 
a little tangent again now this is

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.900 
coming from a rush player I mean I
primarily<00:04:37.960> played<00:04:38.290> brush<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.890> bad<00:04:39.220> company<00:04:39.460> 2
