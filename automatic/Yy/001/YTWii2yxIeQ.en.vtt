I've<00:01:49.079> measured<00:01:49.829> in<00:01:49.950> about<00:01:50.189> seven<00:01:50.609> inches<00:01:50.880> or

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
I've measured in about seven inches or

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.539 
I've measured in about seven inches or
so<00:01:51.270> so<00:01:51.630> that<00:01:51.780> it's<00:01:51.899> kind<00:01:52.740> of<00:01:52.799> balanced<00:01:53.310> and

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
so so that it's kind of balanced and

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:58.130 
so so that it's kind of balanced and
I'll<00:01:53.820> actually<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.390> attach<00:01:54.689> these<00:01:57.140> what

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
I'll actually then attach these what

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.630 
I'll actually then attach these what
I've<00:01:58.259> done<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.560> I've<00:01:58.710> actually<00:01:58.860> pre<00:01:59.369> measured

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
I've done is I've actually pre measured

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.090 
I've done is I've actually pre measured
and<00:02:00.060> marked<00:02:00.750> exactly<00:02:01.229> where<00:02:01.619> I<00:02:01.649> want<00:02:01.950> these

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
and marked exactly where I want these

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.490 
and marked exactly where I want these
supposed<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.549> be<00:02:02.670> so<00:02:02.939> it's<00:02:03.060> really<00:02:03.360> easy

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
supposed to be so it's really easy

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.050 
supposed to be so it's really easy
because<00:02:04.500> I'm<00:02:04.619> using<00:02:04.799> pine<00:02:05.130> wood<00:02:05.369> it's<00:02:05.520> soft<00:02:05.789> so

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
because I'm using pine wood it's soft so

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.869 
because I'm using pine wood it's soft so
it<00:02:06.210> makes<00:02:06.840> it<00:02:07.049> also<00:02:07.530> easy<00:02:08.039> to<00:02:08.190> actually<00:02:08.429> put

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
it makes it also easy to actually put

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:15.619 
it makes it also easy to actually put
the<00:02:09.000> screw<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:13.970> okay<00:02:14.970> so<00:02:15.030> I<00:02:15.180> just<00:02:15.209> put<00:02:15.540> the
