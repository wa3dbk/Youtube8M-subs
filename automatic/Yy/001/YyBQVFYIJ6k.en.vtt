00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
that I just don't have the money to

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.570 
that I just don't have the money to
finish<00:00:06.410> this<00:00:07.410> here<00:00:07.649> is<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.799> Granada<00:00:08.160> engine

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
finish this here is a Granada engine

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.520 
finish this here is a Granada engine
I've<00:00:09.269> got<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.599> the<00:00:09.719> parts<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:10.139> put<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.380> back

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
I've got all the parts to put it back

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.730 
I've got all the parts to put it back
together<00:00:10.769> but<00:00:11.550> I<00:00:11.870> don't<00:00:12.870> have<00:00:13.049> money<00:00:13.290> to<00:00:13.410> have

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
together but I don't have money to have

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.189 
together but I don't have money to have
the<00:00:13.920> crank<00:00:14.400> properly<00:00:15.000> fixed<00:00:15.240> on<00:00:15.599> the<00:00:15.809> journals

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:16.199 
the crank properly fixed on the journals

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.010 
the crank properly fixed on the journals
has<00:00:16.379> nicks<00:00:16.710> on<00:00:16.890> it<00:00:17.150> so<00:00:18.150> I<00:00:18.510> don't<00:00:18.750> have<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
has nicks on it so I don't have the

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.750 
has nicks on it so I don't have the
money<00:00:19.170> yet<00:00:19.410> turned<00:00:19.680> or<00:00:19.949> getting<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.250> crank<00:00:20.520> or

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
money yet turned or getting a crank or

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.300 
money yet turned or getting a crank or
do<00:00:21.090> new<00:00:21.240> engine<00:00:21.600> so<00:00:21.900> it's<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.010> to<00:00:23.100> sit<00:00:23.279> for

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
do new engine so it's going to sit for

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.870 
do new engine so it's going to sit for
now<00:00:24.260> the<00:00:25.260> transmission<00:00:25.680> I<00:00:26.070> can<00:00:26.369> put<00:00:26.550> together

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
now the transmission I can put together

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.679 
now the transmission I can put together
so<00:00:27.480> I<00:00:28.580> think<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.820> got<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.179> parts<00:00:30.330> for<00:00:30.539> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
so I think I got all the parts for that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.709 
so I think I got all the parts for that
so<00:00:30.900> I<00:00:30.929> go<00:00:31.140> ahead<00:00:31.349> and<00:00:31.500> probably<00:00:32.219> fix<00:00:32.430> that<00:00:32.610> up

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
so I go ahead and probably fix that up

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.479 
so I go ahead and probably fix that up
one<00:00:33.719> of<00:00:33.780> these<00:00:33.840> days<00:00:34.010> get<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.160> all<00:00:35.309> together

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
one of these days get that all together

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.840 
one of these days get that all together
at<00:00:35.760> least<00:00:37.100> going<00:00:38.100> to<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.309> to<00:00:38.370> buy<00:00:38.489> some<00:00:38.730> new

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
at least going to have to buy some new

at least going to have to buy some new

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.520

and<00:00:41.760> I've<00:00:41.850> got<00:00:42.000> a<00:00:42.290> transmission<00:00:43.290> cooler

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
and I've got a transmission cooler

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.040 
and I've got a transmission cooler
waiting<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.070> didn't<00:00:44.969> like<00:00:45.120> how<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.360> original

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
waiting I didn't like how the original

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.209 
waiting I didn't like how the original
ones<00:00:46.200> were<00:00:46.320> running<00:00:46.680> so<00:00:46.829> I'm<00:00:46.890> going<00:00:47.039> to<00:00:47.070> go

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
ones were running so I'm going to go

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.889 
ones were running so I'm going to go
ahead<00:00:47.250> and<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.780> make<00:00:48.780> new<00:00:48.989> ones<00:00:49.309> and<00:00:50.899> I've

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
ahead and just make new ones and I've

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:55.549 
ahead and just make new ones and I've
got<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.550> 63<00:00:53.550> oldsmobile<00:00:54.149> it's<00:00:55.110> got<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:55.320> burnt

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
got the 63 oldsmobile it's got a burnt

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.180 
got the 63 oldsmobile it's got a burnt
exhaust<00:00:56.190> valve<00:00:56.989> brake<00:00:57.989> booster<00:00:58.469> has<00:00:58.649> vacuum

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
exhaust valve brake booster has vacuum

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.090 
exhaust valve brake booster has vacuum
leak<00:00:59.399> and<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.020> choke<00:01:01.020> needs<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.379> be<00:01:01.500> fixed<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
leak and the choke needs to be fixed and

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.299 
leak and the choke needs to be fixed and
I<00:01:02.280> should<00:01:02.460> probably<00:01:02.670> look<00:01:03.439> at<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.890> steering

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
I should probably look at the steering

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.160 
I should probably look at the steering
because<00:01:05.700> it's<00:01:05.880> got<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.600> little<00:01:06.659> bit<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.869> play<00:01:07.110> in

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
because it's got a little bit of play in

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.200 
because it's got a little bit of play in
it<00:01:07.939> but<00:01:08.939> of<00:01:09.060> course<00:01:09.090> no<00:01:09.450> money<00:01:09.659> can't<00:01:09.960> fix<00:01:10.049> it

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210 
it but of course no money can't fix it

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.880 
it but of course no money can't fix it

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
stuck in four-wheel drive but I don't

want<00:01:16.770> to<00:01:16.830> tinker<00:01:17.009> with<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.340> until<00:01:17.610> I<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:18.259> be

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
want to tinker with it until I can be

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.370 
want to tinker with it until I can be
sure<00:01:19.439> i<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.770> afford<00:01:20.340> to<00:01:20.520> fix<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.850> because

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
sure i can afford to fix it because

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.050 
sure i can afford to fix it because

still using it to haul stuff around just
can't<00:01:24.299> go<00:01:24.450> backwards<00:01:26.240> and<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.840> course<00:01:28.080> the

tranny<00:01:31.409> that's<00:01:31.680> in<00:01:31.860> it<00:01:31.950> or<00:01:32.240> get<00:01:33.240> another

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
tranny that's in it or get another

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.069 
tranny that's in it or get another
transmission<00:01:34.020> for<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:35.360> also<00:01:36.360> needs<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.960> new

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
transmission for it also needs a new

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.380 
transmission for it also needs a new
exhaust<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:39.229> heater<00:01:40.229> hoses<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.970> a<00:01:41.970> tie<00:01:42.150> rod

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
exhaust and heater hoses and a tie rod

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.170 
exhaust and heater hoses and a tie rod
end<00:01:42.600> which<00:01:42.810> i<00:01:42.960> have<00:01:43.579> so<00:01:44.579> i<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.759> put<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:45.030> one

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
end which i have so i can put that one

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.109 
end which i have so i can put that one
in<00:01:45.210> for<00:01:45.479> free<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> if<00:01:47.579> i<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.759> going<00:01:47.880> to<00:01:47.970> drive

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
in for free and if i was going to drive

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:49.819 
in for free and if i was going to drive
on<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.479> road<00:01:48.659> i<00:01:48.899> should<00:01:49.049> probably<00:01:49.290> get<00:01:49.680> some

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
on the road i should probably get some

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.910 
on the road i should probably get some
new<00:01:50.009> tires<00:01:50.189> seasons<00:01:50.790> are<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:52.500> back<00:01:52.680> ones

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
new tires seasons are the back ones

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.700 
new tires seasons are the back ones
especially<00:01:53.130> are<00:01:53.610> completely<00:01:54.360> bald<00:01:55.290> in<00:01:55.590> the

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
especially are completely bald in the

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.719 
especially are completely bald in the
center<00:01:55.979> there<00:01:56.159> so<00:01:58.040> those<00:01:59.040> are<00:01:59.159> pretty<00:01:59.490> much

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
center there so those are pretty much

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.459 
center there so those are pretty much
all<00:01:59.939> my<00:02:00.090> big<00:02:00.479> projects<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.110> i<00:02:01.170> don't<00:02:01.350> have
