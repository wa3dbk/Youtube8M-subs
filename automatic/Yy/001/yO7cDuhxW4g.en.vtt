00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:16.400
 hey vines and welcome to 

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:18.410
 a new video of me 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.780
 it is as far as I'm back at a 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.340
 new magnolia videoreihe with maybe 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.200
 Have you already heard about it ? 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:26.029
 she is under the motto adorns herself 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.860
 pretty and so I gave me something small 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:30.110
 think about what I hope you like 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.900
 I was inspired by 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:34.579
 this picture i was super excited and 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.410
 I generally wear hair ornaments very much 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:37.850
 gladly and there I thought that 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.620
 It can not be that one does not 

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.210
 can copy and I think up 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.239
 I found a way out of that, so I hope 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:48.250
 that he likes you so everything you 

00:00:44.239 --> 00:00:48.250
 Needed of course are your bottom 

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:53.690
 Should you find refrigerated office doors in 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.340
 load any where there are also substances 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:56.750
 sometimes I even have them already 

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.700
 Just look at the bastallades 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.150
 in your environment for what you are there 

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:04.100
 you also need to find her 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:06.200
 a band which is best a color in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:10.100
 your bordure picks up in my case 

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:12.820
 if it is white then you need it too 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.229
 once needle and thread 

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.790
 I also have the color here 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:20.990
 chosen white because they are easy on 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:22.940
 at least I have now the 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.470
 Length measured on my head here 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.760
 you do not have to worry 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.710
 that you maybe measured more accurately 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.420
 have or too long or too short 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.370
 in that we later with the band 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.250
 you can work the length quite simply 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.510
 adjust 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.720
 Next I cut the modules 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.370
 Just picked up there for that 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.870
 I use a very normal pair of scissors 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.030
 can also use it all knife 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.680
 or whatever you're doing right now 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.420
 is in front of the hands so now comes 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.120
 the ride with the sewing as you end up 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:55.400
 your border simply this rope 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.530
 You want to work now 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.020
 if any of you have problems 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.659
 I'll just take this for this 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.130
 end of my brush put it around like that 

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:06.320
 that I can make sure that that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.780
 other banks get fit by and so 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.970
 put it around twice then pull it out 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.010
 I'll get this out and I'll be at the 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.690
 top edge once my bordure 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.550
 together 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.910
 so that loop afterwards received 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:17.910
 remains 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.019
 So one side you see now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.819
 I sewed when I get here 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.860
 still a little against mine 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.269
 bend where the ribbon comes from 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.319
 and that's exactly what I'm doing now 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.319
 on the other hand 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.600
 so when you're done with it 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.700
 now the part where the ribbon easy 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.050
 is pulled through the bend that at 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.730
 the materials always a bit 

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:18.970
 difficult I would like you as a tip 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.450
 just recommend taking your needle 

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.250
 and at the end of this ribbon edge 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:26.560
 You can also flip an office needle 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:30.900
 So or use a safety pin 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:33.730
 so I'm going around here now 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:36.360
 a little band, so to speak, firmly in the grip 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:41.140
 have and go through the bend here 

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:42.550
 nothing trying not to anything 

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:43.480
 Do not touch anything with a needle 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.530
 to begin 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.000
 so and now I just pull it off here 

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:51.010
 and you know that the ribbon is easy 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.510
 come along and do exactly the same 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.190
 I now again on the other 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.290
 side by that I here the rope 

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:57.970
 or the thread not fixed 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.320
 I can have them simply easy 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.320
 pull out again and exactly the same 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:04.990
 on the other side, therefore, make one 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:06.760
 Hair band is now ready for those 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:11.740
 that annoys or or that 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:14.320
 that bothers that at the end now this 22 

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:16.030
 namely, that ben can go there 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:18.520
 that then exactly on the head 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.489
 adjust and just end up here both 

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.310
 take together so that 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.660
 just this loop is created and 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:28.990
 that, so to speak 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.790
 yes these ribbons do not end anymore 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:32.200
 next to the head or on the hair 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:34.000
 I can actually see it 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.350
 quite a lot I then work them in mostly 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.490
 a weaving or in 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.930
 my hairstyle with one 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.930
 but each of you can do it that way 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:42.520
 decide which you would like so 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.560
 I love you, I hope it was good for you 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.360
 comprehensible if you like it 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.830
 get to make after 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.380
 I'm just pulling my two here 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.590
 end together and lay mine 

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.080
 hair accessories then a hair band once 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.090
 my head to what I do afterwards 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.660
 is just my loops together 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.940
 to draw 

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.500
 until I feel that it is close to 

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.200
 head rests and no longer slip 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:08.470
 and then I either make a knot 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.930
 or frieze these individual ribbons then 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.670
 so to speak, the office for change around it 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.920
 I hope you know what I mean 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:16.840
 That's how I always thought so 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:20.400
 just to wear that and I hope that 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.400
 you like it accordingly 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.980
 So you love that was it with my do 

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:34.480

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:35.920
 I hope you enjoyed it 

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:37.630
 I know in the comments whether we 

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:40.510
 like to watch such videos more often 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.730
 I do not care about which topic at home 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.260
 it was jewelery or just decoration 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:45.850

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:47.710
