here now once you try this you're gonna
see<00:01:54.480> right<00:01:54.720> away<00:01:54.900> that<00:01:55.290> your<00:01:55.530> core<00:01:55.860> starts

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
see right away that your core starts

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:58.700 
see right away that your core starts
firing<00:01:56.520> up<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:57.600> because<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.080> have<00:01:58.320> to<00:01:58.500> hold

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
firing up just because you have to hold

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.850 
firing up just because you have to hold
these<00:01:58.860> bands<00:01:59.220> down<00:01:59.960> onto<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.080> ground<00:02:01.260> right

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
these bands down onto the ground right

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.220 
these bands down onto the ground right
because<00:02:02.190> they<00:02:02.340> want<00:02:02.700> to<00:02:02.970> pull<00:02:03.300> me<00:02:03.510> up

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:04.230 
because they want to pull me up

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.300 
because they want to pull me up
that<00:02:04.470> way<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:04.980> have<00:02:05.730> to<00:02:06.030> flex<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.600> core<00:02:07.129> to<00:02:08.129> hold

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
that way I have to flex the core to hold

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.150 
that way I have to flex the core to hold
myself<00:02:08.489> in<00:02:08.849> position<00:02:09.269> now<00:02:09.769> let's<00:02:10.769> clear<00:02:11.129> up

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.949 
myself in position now let's clear up
one<00:02:11.519> sort<00:02:11.879> of<00:02:11.970> a<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:13.140> a<00:02:13.590> myth<00:02:13.830> that's<00:02:14.129> out<00:02:14.370> there

core<00:02:26.250> does<00:02:26.519> is<00:02:26.730> it

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
core does is it

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.410 
core does is it
is<00:02:27.470> the<00:02:27.650> spy<00:02:28.280> okay<00:02:28.880> so<00:02:28.940> whether<00:02:29.240> you're<00:02:29.390> on

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:33.770 
knees here and you're flexing your spine

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:35.140 
knees here and you're flexing your spine
and<00:02:33.980> that's<00:02:34.130> one<00:02:34.340> of<00:02:34.370> the<00:02:34.489> main<00:02:34.700> things<00:02:35.030> that

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150 
and that's one of the main things that

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.540 
and that's one of the main things that
the<00:02:35.330> ABS<00:02:35.510> are<00:02:35.750> responsible<00:02:36.380> for<00:02:36.560> so<00:02:36.800> if

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
the ABS are responsible for so if

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:38.979 
the ABS are responsible for so if
anybody<00:02:38.000> tells<00:02:38.180> you<00:02:38.239> stop<00:02:38.510> doing<00:02:38.660> crunches

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
anybody tells you stop doing crunches

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:41.320 
anybody tells you stop doing crunches

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330 
it's not that's that's a that's a minute

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:43.809 
it's not that's that's a that's a minute
now<00:02:41.560> just<00:02:42.560> crunches<00:02:43.130> would<00:02:43.430> be<00:02:43.550> the<00:02:43.640> worst

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:43.819 
now just crunches would be the worst

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:45.699 
now just crunches would be the worst
thing<00:02:44.030> you<00:02:44.120> can<00:02:44.239> do<00:02:44.420> but<00:02:44.959> stop<00:02:45.230> doing<00:02:45.560> crunches

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
thing you can do but stop doing crunches

control<00:03:44.359> rotation<00:03:44.690> that's<00:03:45.350> job<00:03:45.769> number<00:03:45.799> two

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:46.340 
control rotation that's job number two

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:49.750 
control rotation that's job number two
of<00:03:46.609> the<00:03:47.120> ABS<00:03:47.299> is<00:03:47.660> to<00:03:47.870> control<00:03:48.350> and<00:03:48.760> decelerate

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:49.760 
of the ABS is to control and decelerate

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:54.310 
of the ABS is to control and decelerate
this<00:03:50.660> rotation<00:03:51.620> here<00:03:52.340> why<00:03:52.940> because<00:03:53.269> as<00:03:53.810> it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
this rotation here why because as it

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.759 
this rotation here why because as it
takes<00:03:54.950> me<00:03:55.070> this<00:03:55.340> way<00:03:55.519> I<00:03:55.790> have<00:03:56.239> to<00:03:56.590> contract<00:03:57.590> the

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
takes me this way I have to contract the

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.849 
takes me this way I have to contract the
ABS<00:03:57.920> and<00:03:58.340> rotate<00:03:59.209> back<00:03:59.600> down<00:03:59.900> to<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.680> ground

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:00.859 
ABS and rotate back down to the ground

00:04:00.859 --> 00:04:03.970 
ABS and rotate back down to the ground
obviously<00:04:01.549> same<00:04:02.510> thing<00:04:02.750> here<00:04:03.079> and<00:04:03.290> I<00:04:03.680> have<00:04:03.829> to

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
obviously same thing here and I have to

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.970 
obviously same thing here and I have to
contract<00:04:04.459> back<00:04:05.450> down<00:04:05.690> in<00:04:05.870> the<00:04:05.959> ground<00:04:06.170> up<00:04:06.680> to

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
contract back down in the ground up to

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:10.569 
contract back down in the ground up to
the<00:04:07.250> side<00:04:08.260> track<00:04:09.260> down<00:04:09.470> to<00:04:09.590> the<00:04:09.680> ground<00:04:09.859> so<00:04:10.400> now

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:10.579 
the side track down to the ground so now

00:04:10.579 --> 00:04:14.400 
the side track down to the ground so now
you<00:04:11.269> can<00:04:11.480> lift<00:04:11.660> out<00:04:11.900> and<00:04:12.350> then<00:04:12.829> up<00:04:13.100> and<00:04:14.000> then
