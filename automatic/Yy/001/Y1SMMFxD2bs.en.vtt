00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
a Finnish anistar there's a little bit

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.240 
a Finnish anistar there's a little bit
of<00:00:18.930> the<00:00:19.020> transfer<00:00:19.439> between<00:00:19.590> the<00:00:19.800> every<00:00:20.010> state

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
of the transfer between the every state

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.490 
of the transfer between the every state
which<00:00:20.520> a<00:00:20.820> lot<00:00:21.270> of<00:00:21.300> the<00:00:21.449> riders<00:00:21.630> pot<00:00:21.930> might<00:00:22.320> not

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
which a lot of the riders pot might not

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.920

like<00:00:23.400> but<00:00:23.430> they're<00:00:24.180> not<00:00:24.359> really<00:00:24.689> big

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
like but they're not really big

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.240 
like but they're not really big
transfers<00:00:25.410> so<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.680> shouldn't<00:00:25.949> be<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.039> big<00:00:26.189> deal

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:26.250 
transfers so it shouldn't be a big deal

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
sort of featured as kind of like the

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.590

out of that and it just erupts it's

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:25.000 
out of that and it just erupts it's
pretty<00:02:19.580> amazing<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:20.860> did<00:02:21.860> the<00:02:23.800> how<00:02:24.800> are<00:02:24.920> the

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.010 
pretty amazing how did the how are the

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:27.310 
pretty amazing how did the how are the
crowds<00:02:25.280> I<00:02:25.610> guess<00:02:25.850> compared<00:02:26.300> to<00:02:26.450> the<00:02:26.840> races<00:02:27.200> in

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:27.320 
crowds I guess compared to the races in

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.460 
crowds I guess compared to the races in
Europe<00:02:27.620> in<00:02:27.800> terms<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.630> how<00:02:29.630> we<00:02:29.660> live<00:02:30.050> cycling

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470
