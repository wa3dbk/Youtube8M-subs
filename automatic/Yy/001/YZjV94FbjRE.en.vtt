carefully<00:00:53.940> cut<00:00:54.329> out<00:00:54.449> the<00:00:54.600> shape<00:00:56.090> be<00:00:57.090> sure<00:00:57.300> to

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
carefully cut out the shape be sure to

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.029 
carefully cut out the shape be sure to
try<00:00:57.539> out<00:00:57.750> lots<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:58.289> different<00:00:58.649> shapes<00:00:58.859> and

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
try out lots of different shapes and

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.799 
try out lots of different shapes and
sizes<00:01:01.850> put<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.940> disc<00:01:03.120> in<00:01:03.239> front<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.570> the<00:01:03.629> lens

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
sizes put the disc in front of the lens

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.840 
sizes put the disc in front of the lens
set<00:01:04.530> your<00:01:04.680> camera<00:01:04.979> into<00:01:05.189> aperture<00:01:05.610> priority

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
set your camera into aperture priority

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.690 
set your camera into aperture priority
or<00:01:06.270> manual<00:01:06.720> mode<00:01:06.799> you<00:01:07.799> want<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> aperture<00:01:08.580> to

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
or manual mode you want the aperture to

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.670 
or manual mode you want the aperture to
be<00:01:08.790> as<00:01:09.000> wide<00:01:09.390> as<00:01:09.630> possible<00:01:10.260> for<00:01:10.470> maximum

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
be as wide as possible for maximum

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.160 
be as wide as possible for maximum
blurriness<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.880> set<00:01:12.060> the<00:01:12.180> f-stop<00:01:12.600> number<00:01:13.020> as

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
blurriness so set the f-stop number as

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.520 
blurriness so set the f-stop number as
low<00:01:13.770> as<00:01:14.010> possible<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:15.240> lens<00:01:15.479> it's<00:01:15.750> a<00:01:15.840> 1.4

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:16.530 
low as possible on this lens it's a 1.4

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.249 
low as possible on this lens it's a 1.4
so<00:01:16.770> I'm<00:01:16.950> gonna<00:01:17.100> use<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:18.750> disc<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.110> gonna

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
so I'm gonna use that the disc is gonna

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.020 
so I'm gonna use that the disc is gonna
block<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.560> lot<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.950> light<00:01:20.159> so<00:01:20.189> you'll<00:01:20.729> need<00:01:20.939> to

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
block a lot of light so you'll need to

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.760 
block a lot of light so you'll need to
set<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> longer<00:01:21.659> exposure<00:01:21.869> time<00:01:22.350> in<00:01:22.500> order<00:01:22.619> to

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
set a longer exposure time in order to

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.380 
set a longer exposure time in order to
compensate<00:01:23.100> and<00:01:23.430> therefore<00:01:24.030> you'll<00:01:24.210> need<00:01:24.360> a

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
compensate and therefore you'll need a

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.179 
compensate and therefore you'll need a
tripod<00:01:24.990> or<00:01:25.020> something<00:01:25.500> else<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.799> stabilize

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
tripod or something else to stabilize

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.620 
tripod or something else to stabilize
the<00:01:26.369> camera<00:01:26.759> while<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.090> shutter<00:01:27.330> is<00:01:27.420> open

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the camera while the shutter is open

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.480 
the camera while the shutter is open
other<00:01:28.439> than<00:01:28.680> that<00:01:28.860> you<00:01:29.070> just<00:01:29.250> need<00:01:29.400> to

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
other than that you just need to

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.460 
other than that you just need to
experiment<00:01:29.939> any<00:01:30.360> small<00:01:30.960> point<00:01:31.290> of<00:01:31.409> light

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
experiment any small point of light

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.590 
experiment any small point of light
that's<00:01:31.950> out<00:01:32.220> of<00:01:32.280> focus<00:01:32.579> will<00:01:32.939> turn<00:01:33.210> into<00:01:33.390> the

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
that's out of focus will turn into the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
that's out of focus will turn into the
shape<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.079> you<00:01:34.170> cut<00:01:34.380> into<00:01:34.619> your<00:01:34.710> disc<00:01:35.009> if<00:01:35.280> you

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
shape that you cut into your disc if you

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.340 
shape that you cut into your disc if you
want<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:35.939> work<00:01:36.090> indoors<00:01:36.689> you<00:01:37.049> can<00:01:37.200> use<00:01:37.320> a

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
want to work indoors you can use a

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.620 
want to work indoors you can use a
strand<00:01:37.680> of<00:01:37.770> Christmas<00:01:38.220> lights<00:01:38.430> or<00:01:38.670> go<00:01:39.479> outside

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
strand of Christmas lights or go outside

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.160 
strand of Christmas lights or go outside
at<00:01:39.990> night<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.380> shoot<00:01:41.180> so<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.450> went<00:01:42.780> outside<00:01:42.899> and

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
at night and shoot so I went outside and
