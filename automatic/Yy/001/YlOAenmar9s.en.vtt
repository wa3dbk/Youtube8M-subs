vocabulary of strengths because good

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.450 
vocabulary of strengths because good
teachers<00:00:43.200> always<00:00:43.410> strengths-based<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.399> they

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
teachers always strengths-based and they

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.250 
teachers always strengths-based and they
have<00:00:44.579> always<00:00:44.700> been<00:00:44.969> strengths-based<00:00:45.360> and<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
have always been strengths-based and I

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.200 
have always been strengths-based and I
trained<00:00:46.590> as<00:00:46.710> a<00:00:46.739> special<00:00:47.160> needs<00:00:47.340> teacher<00:00:47.579> and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
trained as a special needs teacher and

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.060 
trained as a special needs teacher and
when<00:00:48.539> I<00:00:48.570> read<00:00:48.899> about<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.649> character

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
when I read about the character

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.260 
when I read about the character
strengths<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.489> thought<00:00:50.730> this<00:00:51.210> is

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
strengths I thought this is

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.910 
strengths I thought this is
instinctively<00:00:51.960> how<00:00:52.289> I've<00:00:52.440> always<00:00:52.590> always

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
instinctively how I've always always

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.340 
instinctively how I've always always
taught<00:00:53.520> but<00:00:53.879> these<00:00:54.210> 20<00:00:54.629> full<00:00:54.780> strengths<00:00:55.170> give

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
taught but these 20 full strengths give

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.220 
taught but these 20 full strengths give
me<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.710> vocabulary<00:00:56.520> language<00:00:57.390> that<00:00:58.109> will

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
me a vocabulary language that will

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.049 
me a vocabulary language that will
broaden<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.859> deepen<00:00:59.190> my<00:00:59.430> work<00:00:59.670> so<00:01:00.030> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
broaden and deepen my work so I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.119 
broaden and deepen my work so I
introduce<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:01.020> strengths<00:01:01.410> to<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.680> teachers

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
introduce the strengths to the teachers

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.850 
introduce the strengths to the teachers
and<00:01:02.309> we<00:01:03.030> wove<00:01:03.300> them<00:01:03.690> into<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.140> cycle<00:01:04.650> of

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
and we wove them into a cycle of

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.240 
and we wove them into a cycle of
festivals<00:01:05.519> so<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.119> linked<00:01:06.950> things<00:01:07.950> like

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
really encouraging is that the children

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.709 
really encouraging is that the children
have<00:01:55.229> picked<00:01:55.590> up<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.979> language<00:01:56.540> from<00:01:57.540> the

have picked up the language from the

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.580 
have picked up the language from the
teachers<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.770> now<00:01:58.979> you<00:01:59.040> hear<00:01:59.490> children<00:01:59.820> saying

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:00.590 
teachers so now you hear children saying

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
so then we got not only the teachers

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:10.270 
so then we got not only the teachers
using<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.660> language

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
using the language

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.070 
using the language
but<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:10.610> children<00:02:10.640> use<00:02:11.420> it<00:02:11.600> to<00:02:11.810> each<00:02:11.930> other

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
but the children use it to each other

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.710 
but the children use it to each other
and<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:12.920> has<00:02:13.100> a<00:02:13.130> really<00:02:13.430> positive<00:02:13.819> impact<00:02:14.510> on

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
and that has a really positive impact on

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.340 
and that has a really positive impact on
teamwork<00:02:15.410> and<00:02:16.390> citizenship<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.600> behavior<00:02:18.140> as

be looking with them at what does a

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:30.040 
be looking with them at what does a
strengths-based<00:05:28.520> personal<00:05:29.330> statement<00:05:29.779> look

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:30.050 
strengths-based personal statement look

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:33.040 
strengths-based personal statement look
like<00:05:31.000> why<00:05:32.000> are<00:05:32.060> you<00:05:32.180> applying<00:05:32.599> for<00:05:32.779> this

like why are you applying for this

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.290 
like why are you applying for this
subject<00:05:33.590> what<00:05:33.740> strengths<00:05:34.190> are<00:05:34.340> you<00:05:34.400> using<00:05:34.940> in

00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:35.300 
subject what strengths are you using in

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:36.999 
subject what strengths are you using in
that<00:05:35.599> subject<00:05:35.900> so<00:05:36.199> that's<00:05:36.379> a<00:05:36.589> piece<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.770> work

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:37.009 
that subject so that's a piece of work

00:05:37.009 --> 00:05:39.610 
that subject so that's a piece of work
is<00:05:37.190> coming<00:05:37.580> up<00:05:37.779> but<00:05:38.779> I'm<00:05:38.900> also<00:05:39.050> going<00:05:39.319> to<00:05:39.440> be

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:39.620 
is coming up but I'm also going to be

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:42.550 
is coming up but I'm also going to be
using<00:05:40.210> strengths<00:05:41.210> what<00:05:41.750> I'm<00:05:41.900> trying<00:05:42.229> to<00:05:42.349> do<00:05:42.529> is

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:42.560 
using strengths what I'm trying to do is

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:44.680 
using strengths what I'm trying to do is
to<00:05:42.740> embed<00:05:43.069> strengths<00:05:44.000> into<00:05:44.330> the<00:05:44.449> curriculum

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
to embed strengths into the curriculum

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.320 
to embed strengths into the curriculum
and<00:05:45.139> the<00:05:45.199> life<00:05:45.409> of<00:05:45.620> the<00:05:45.710> school<00:05:46.009> so<00:05:46.940> I'm<00:05:47.060> just

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:47.330 
and the life of the school so I'm just

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:50.200 
and the life of the school so I'm just
running<00:05:47.569> a<00:05:47.779> series<00:05:48.199> of<00:05:48.279> pilot<00:05:49.279> experimental

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
running a series of pilot experimental

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.659 
running a series of pilot experimental
lessons<00:05:50.599> where<00:05:51.469> we<00:05:51.680> take<00:05:52.159> particular

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:52.669 
lessons where we take particular

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:55.540 
lessons where we take particular
strengths<00:05:53.419> and<00:05:53.650> focus<00:05:54.650> on<00:05:54.860> them<00:05:55.039> with<00:05:55.430> the

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:55.550 
strengths and focus on them with the

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.700 
strengths and focus on them with the
students<00:05:56.120> on<00:05:56.330> how<00:05:56.569> they<00:05:56.900> use<00:05:57.110> those<00:05:57.349> strengths

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:57.710 
students on how they use those strengths

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:59.709 
students on how they use those strengths
in<00:05:57.800> the<00:05:57.889> lesson<00:05:58.370> but<00:05:58.940> also<00:05:59.120> where<00:05:59.449> they<00:05:59.479> can

00:05:59.709 --> 00:05:59.719 
in the lesson but also where they can

00:05:59.719 --> 00:06:01.240 
in the lesson but also where they can
find<00:05:59.750> those<00:06:00.289> strengths<00:06:00.710> in<00:06:00.800> the<00:06:00.889> subject

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:01.250 
find those strengths in the subject

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:03.309 
find those strengths in the subject
matter<00:06:01.400> of<00:06:01.520> the<00:06:01.699> lesson<00:06:02.000> so<00:06:02.629> I'm<00:06:02.659> taking

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:03.319 
matter of the lesson so I'm taking

00:06:03.319 --> 00:06:05.439 
matter of the lesson so I'm taking
history<00:06:03.469> as<00:06:04.370> a<00:06:04.430> subject<00:06:04.759> and<00:06:05.089> I'm<00:06:05.240> going<00:06:05.419> to

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:05.449 
history as a subject and I'm going to

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:07.930 
history as a subject and I'm going to
team<00:06:05.690> teach<00:06:05.990> it<00:06:06.229> with<00:06:07.159> the<00:06:07.339> history<00:06:07.699> teacher

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
team teach it with the history teacher

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.899 
team teach it with the history teacher
and<00:06:08.270> we've<00:06:08.900> taken<00:06:09.259> teamwork<00:06:10.009> and<00:06:10.279> creativity

00:06:10.899 --> 00:06:10.909 
and we've taken teamwork and creativity

00:06:10.909 --> 00:06:13.649 
and we've taken teamwork and creativity
and<00:06:11.360> curiosity<00:06:11.569> as<00:06:12.319> three<00:06:12.589> strengths<00:06:13.009> and

00:06:13.649 --> 00:06:13.659 
and curiosity as three strengths and

00:06:13.659 --> 00:06:16.390 
and curiosity as three strengths and
we're<00:06:14.659> looking<00:06:14.930> at<00:06:15.050> the<00:06:15.139> Romans<00:06:15.529> so<00:06:16.159> we<00:06:16.279> can

00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:16.400 
we're looking at the Romans so we can

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:17.950 
we're looking at the Romans so we can
have<00:06:16.550> the<00:06:16.669> central<00:06:17.029> story<00:06:17.389> we're<00:06:17.690> using<00:06:17.810> a

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:17.960 
have the central story we're using a

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.529 
have the central story we're using a
storytelling<00:06:18.500> approach<00:06:18.940> of<00:06:19.940> the<00:06:20.240> Roman

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:20.539 
storytelling approach of the Roman

00:06:20.539 --> 00:06:22.300 
storytelling approach of the Roman
invasion<00:06:20.779> of<00:06:21.020> Britain<00:06:21.379> and<00:06:21.529> then<00:06:22.039> we're<00:06:22.190> going

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.310 
invasion of Britain and then we're going

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:25.329 
invasion of Britain and then we're going
to<00:06:22.400> be<00:06:22.550> both<00:06:23.419> using<00:06:23.839> teamwork<00:06:24.229> in<00:06:24.710> the<00:06:24.949> lesson

00:06:25.329 --> 00:06:25.339 
to be both using teamwork in the lesson

00:06:25.339 --> 00:06:27.490 
to be both using teamwork in the lesson
and<00:06:25.460> looking<00:06:26.419> at<00:06:26.539> where<00:06:26.719> the<00:06:26.839> Romans<00:06:27.259> and<00:06:27.469> the

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:27.500 
and looking at where the Romans and the

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:30.999 
and looking at where the Romans and the
ancient<00:06:27.830> Britons<00:06:28.190> use<00:06:28.610> teamwork<00:06:29.020> so<00:06:30.020> my<00:06:30.500> my

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
ancient Britons use teamwork so my my

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:32.649 
ancient Britons use teamwork so my my
idea<00:06:31.430> is<00:06:31.490> and<00:06:31.849> I<00:06:31.909> don't<00:06:32.089> know<00:06:32.180> whether<00:06:32.419> it<00:06:32.569> will

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:32.659 
idea is and I don't know whether it will

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.490 
idea is and I don't know whether it will
work<00:06:32.690> yet<00:06:33.110> because

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:33.500 
work yet because

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:36.160 
work yet because
this<00:06:33.590> is<00:06:33.740> a<00:06:33.770> pilot<00:06:34.310> is<00:06:34.790> that<00:06:35.180> if<00:06:35.570> the<00:06:35.630> children

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:36.170 
this is a pilot is that if the children

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.110 
this is a pilot is that if the children
can<00:06:36.380> identify<00:06:36.530> their<00:06:37.160> own<00:06:37.280> strengths<00:06:37.970> of

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:38.120 
can identify their own strengths of

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:40.900 
can identify their own strengths of
teamwork<00:06:38.900> and<00:06:39.320> then<00:06:39.950> realize<00:06:40.520> that<00:06:40.790> the

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:40.910 
teamwork and then realize that the

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:43.630 
teamwork and then realize that the
Romans<00:06:41.360> had<00:06:41.630> those<00:06:42.320> strengths<00:06:42.830> as<00:06:42.950> well<00:06:42.980> it

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:43.640 
Romans had those strengths as well it

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:45.460 
Romans had those strengths as well it
gives<00:06:43.820> them<00:06:44.060> an<00:06:44.240> added<00:06:44.630> connection<00:06:45.200> to<00:06:45.380> the

00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:45.470 
gives them an added connection to the

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:46.840 
gives them an added connection to the
curriculum<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:46.160> that<00:06:46.190> it's<00:06:46.430> more<00:06:46.580> meaningful

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:46.850 
curriculum so that it's more meaningful

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.600 
curriculum so that it's more meaningful
for<00:06:47.540> them
