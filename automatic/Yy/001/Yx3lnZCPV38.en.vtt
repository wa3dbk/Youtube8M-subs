00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.890
 President of Ukraine signed an appeal to 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.110
 European Union about accommodation 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.340
 in the conflict zone in the Donbas peacekeepers 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.110
 such a move was approved by the council 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.179
 the country's national security is still 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.369
 February today blue helmets he 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.020
 present in 13 countries of their appearance 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:20.880
 means the conflict is not stopped but 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.680
 frozen and in that condition can 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.300
 continue for quite a long time for example 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.519
 the mission in Palestine lasts longer 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.480
 sixty years as practice shows 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.830
 here are blue helmets 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.720
 only effective in one case 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.030
 warring parties recognize 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.829
 the situation is so stalemate it was in western 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.450
 sugar the rebels of this league realized that 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.550
 unable to crush the moroccan 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.829
 the army and the military that defeat the partisans 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.110
 impossible on driving through moroccan 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.360
 the side on the other side the weapons already 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:48.690
 all old rusty on actually now 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:50.399
 no fighting efficiency stand for more here 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.949
 they are satisfied with such a weapon situation 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.530
 worth and cost me work it costs all 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.789
 get tired and they want to give way to another on and 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.699
 fight not even because visible 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:01.620
 expensive and you no longer make sense but on 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:03.480
 Donbass such conditions have not yet developed 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.129
 Kiev still hopes to win by blocking 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.320
 border with Russia in Donetsk and Lugansk 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.180
 enough willing to return the Slavic go 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.130
 further west peacekeepers force their 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.330
 specifics are not able to quickly stop 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.490
 large-scale offensive 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:16.950
 as it was in Lebanese and Yugoslavia or 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.630
 South Ossetia on the way peacekeepers Donbass 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.220
 quite a few obstacles this and the position of Peter 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.290
 Poroshenko who believes to supervise 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.729
 contingent should the European Union in 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.310
 Russia considers this approach unacceptable 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:28.020
 and insist watch from a friend from her so 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.790
 provide an international presence in 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.500
 conflict zone and when voting in 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.130
 UN Security Council Russia can use 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.869
 veto 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.360
 Yes, and time to collect contingent 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.640
 blue helmets are simply not enough 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.820
 order to lead the world of apartments from i think 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.369
 need at least six months . 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:47.790
 Print Poroshenko does everything to 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:52.290
 to delay time and I remember admit 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.860
 what am I late April early May 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:55.950
 when 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.770
 but the king will not dry up the mud 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.729
 quite possibly fighting 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.200
 initiative of Peter Poroshenko can 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.420
 prove to be just an attempt and an extra 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.829
 once demonstrate a peaceful spirit in 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.570
 the run-up to the board of directors vote 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:08.610
 international monetary fund 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.649
 which is expected to financial assistance but 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.209
 if he approves putting peacekeepers this 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.160
 will be true signal leading powers 

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:14.660
 recognize 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.730
 the warring parties have reached 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.410
 stalemate and conflict better 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.970
