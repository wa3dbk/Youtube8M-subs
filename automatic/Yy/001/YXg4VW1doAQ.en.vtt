 hi to all and welcome to showtime 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.220
 this tutorial you are with look for the 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.170
 generation of the master use bug of 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.269
 minecraft is really the must of the must 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:12.210
 the so much coveted youth buzz 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.559
 searched i imagine on youtube everything 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 I can already imagine your sentences 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:20.130
 how to destroy the tnt how to fart the 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:22.410
 tnt as in usb tnt as we blah blah 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.939
 blah blah blah blah blah blah 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.750
 piano and flute this is me I you 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.769
 proposes a concrete and real bug 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.050
 available on all versions of 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.489
 minecraft is fine he's going all 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.559
 simply allow us to place 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.090
 the tnt through the daily of power 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.360
 destroy the chests inside a 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.950
 basis that will have been claim beforehand and 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.120
 also to retrieve items that 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.460
 agree I think that's when 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:48.020
 even the most important is the purpose of 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:50.670
 this destruction massively brief here is 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:55.199
 so for the tutorial we need 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.940
 of a distributor of repeaters 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.430
 some red stone powder from a lamp 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.149
 redstone torch of a few blocks and 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.940
 of the TNT 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:05.430
 we will place henry peter in reverse 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:07.500
 each one so that's to say face here and 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.020
 in front of you there we place 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.450
 also on each side of that of 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.130
 light stone we will let exceed 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.110
 of a block a small net we will put 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.479
 a torch at the end where we will have everything 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.290
 this is our circuit is lit 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:24.509
 continuous circuit I will remove 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:26.610
 hastily this layer of red stone 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.380
 and replace it automatically using 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.060
 of my right click of a new layer 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.579
 of height which will allow us to 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.540
 make our circuit blink 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:38.970
 then well just here 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.560
 imagine that these claims so if these 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.610
 keys but well your area is going all 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.470
 just do that you know when 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.799
 scratching you there I see that there is nothing 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.439
 behind 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.700
 agree not to cheat you go 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.850
 forgive the blocks because 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.479
 objects sites auriel it does not 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.640
 when there 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:56.240
 excuse me but I kindly hand over the 

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:59.570
 blogs 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.579
 and that's it so that's fine 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.259
 has no block behind hop you see 

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:04.189
 here we imagine that it's only hands 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:06.590
 because it's not that I like the area 

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.929
 hop here you are going to have bruises that 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:09.440
 have generated up who are going to leave and who 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:12.470
 will come 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.959
 So here is the goal is well here we 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.390
 will create a little bit we will create a 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:19.120
 little man like that who will us 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.440
 allow to place our distributors 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.250
 it is necessary that the exit distributors do not 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.110
 not on your side 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.370
 it must be up the side 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:29.060
 inside we are like this 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.549
 the firm days 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:34.370
 I remove what has above I put 3 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:36.530
 below now I put my 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.840
 repeaters if sorry we will have to 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.120
 exactly 3 repeater I had you 2 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:42.709
 from the beginning I'm really sorry 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.750
 I had forgotten that we made one 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:46.640
 bout so here's so see if my 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:48.500
 circuit simply flashes more 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.160
 quickly thanks to those of the first bug 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.340
 you will allow me to send systems 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:58.010
 more quickly mix hop removes this 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.239
 i will place if tnt at least for 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:05.870
 can fart blocks six men 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:07.639
 we will be generous we see in m 7 and 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.859
 now I'm just doing it again 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.019
 start my tour and then watch 

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:13.250
 here already white while at the noise at 14 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.069
 october that means the block is 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.329
 passed alas the past tnt I'm stopped 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:19.579
 just a circuit because that makes 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:21.290
 toc tac tac tac scuttle their horrible 

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:23.329
 and sailboats who if they opt I farted 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:25.370
 the chests I may have a few 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:27.380
 too much but if it's not bad enough 5 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:29.030
 it can go diop and I get the 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.290
 items inside there so really I 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.850
 wanted to fart at the end well 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.549
 look at I just show you 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.840
 how should I do I'm going to put 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.579
 more after I will explain 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.410
 also how to get inside 

00:03:37.579 --> 00:03:41.510
 because you can not do without 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:45.319
 in the same way as me it's a 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.510
 certainty I will put in the ten ten 

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:48.859
 I think we can touch already I am 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.829
 not sure but I think we can touch 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:53.829
 the bottom there he no longer 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:59.980
 oh no it needs more well everything 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:01.440
 simply where you need more or so 

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:02.890
 you have to renew your circuit 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:05.020
 directly there 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.970
 yes yes if you have space at the end 

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:09.820
 renew ourselves behind to make 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.320
 farting this is so well everything 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.780
 just do not forget that through 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:17.049
 a blog that goes but if we imagine that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:19.870
 the person just comes to 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.930
 decorate your neighborhoods with the help of 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.700
 foliage like these up 

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:27.160
 well you can not do anything here 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:30.040
 here you can blow up anything of 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.900
 all you are grilled to the marrow 

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.760
 so this is n imagine that this 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.750
 nobody did that but there if she has 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:37.060
 do that on all the contours of 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.600
 chests well you can take 1 pt 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:43.020
 that's how you know it goes to 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.600
 through a block but not two here 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:47.770
 so here's after to recover so this 

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.150
 that there is inside and well it takes 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.770
 use another trio this bug that I do not 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:51.730
 could not go here but I 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.590
 think you can find on 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.080
 Internet is how teleported 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:57.370
 in a base thanks to the water bugs 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.250
 here I think some 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:02.260
 will recognize and others may not 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.000
 after actually there is always 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:09.130
 way one of the records he talks about under 

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.270
 so if ever it's hollow if 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:12.340
 never here we imagine that he is a 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:14.680
 gallery under the base you base is 

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.610
 not from the bottom up all the way up well 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.439
 there is always a way to pass 

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:23.419
 at the pearl so I think I 

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:26.830
 will quickly count where are the fears 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:29.810
 or without men's fathers 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:31.849
 I'll take a little stack 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:35.900
 I will throw everything on the ground and remove 

00:05:31.849 --> 00:05:41.930
 my game mode what I put on an armor 

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:44.960
 because I'm going to die a little month 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:51.590
 diamond friend are going very well done 

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:52.689
 to buy and so here is raymond object 

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.949
 gay fashion 

00:05:52.689 --> 00:05:57.560
 I take my hesitancy to eat not 

00:05:54.949 --> 00:05:58.939
 necessarily everything is there and well it takes 

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.740
 just that I lose and see here 

00:05:58.939 --> 00:06:02.870
 show on it and hop and I managed to 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:05.509
 simply pass through the bugs of the 

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:07.400
 of alberta this was showtime this 

00:06:05.509 --> 00:06:08.930
 tutorial for a few more videos I 'll be 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:11.810
 there very very soon with others 

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.819

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:18.729
 creation 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:20.779

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:22.969
 and what did I want to tell you 

00:06:20.779 --> 00:06:23.810
