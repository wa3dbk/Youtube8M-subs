00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.300

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.079
 in short, you must put yourself on the hill for 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.480
 get them killed to kill your friends 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:39.300
 well practically you will take many yes rp 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.180
 I'll put the notation in the video with a 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.399
 video well first what you have to be both 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.110
 subjects online or assisting 5 and you have to 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:51.690
 put break menu go online and 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.370
 go to the creator and in parenthesis there is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.219
 written beta 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.850
 we click and accept everything we wait 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.219
 loading is once we are 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:05.909
 entered the intricate king must allow 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:08.819
 race that you have to put the right galata 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.459
 well now i'm at michael's house but vi 

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:14.909
 I recommend a point where the road is 

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:17.639
 as much as possible any good 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.759
 the important point is that it is enough 

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:23.639
 wide or in this case you can 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.889
 choose others the bridge or this one 

00:01:23.639 --> 00:01:28.109
 here once we got to the 

00:01:25.889 --> 00:01:31.200
 bridge we have to go on race details 

00:01:28.109 --> 00:01:34.979
 or the first option of the garment lo 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.130
 we put a title in this case at random 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:40.619
 I put rp rp but you can put 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.209
 any other title well after we go 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.450
 south description and we put one 

00:01:42.209 --> 00:01:50.609
 description also at random after we go up 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:54.029
 photo and we take a photo at random is 

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:55.619
 once the photo goes out so much of 

00:01:54.029 --> 00:01:58.259
 search but of course nothing 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.840
 maximum of players put 16 more 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:03.929
 be better is and then put kind of 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:08.340
 race gta and type of route from point 

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:10.710
 precisely afterwards I suggest you put the 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:13.830
 motion or small grid size 

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:17.430
 because it's easier to kill yourself among you 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.940
 and then choose the various vehicles defined 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.740
 which will start with the val well once 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.530
 Once this is done, make it clear 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.980
 noon what you want and after 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.410
 just cut off traffic after exits 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:35.670
 went to the placement and put the 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:38.970
 place of activation 

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:40.920
 having done this, you have to get out of this 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.990
 selection and you have to take a picture of the 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.420
 waiting room 

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:46.470
 after put the check points is once 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.530
 that you are the check points 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:52.980
 I recommend putting the grill more 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.340
 small possible that is and will become 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.920
 getting narrower but longer will be more 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:59.340
 easy for the placement of the gods 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:04.250
 barriers 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.300
 you want to put critical size 2 x 18 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:09.450
 well once this is done you must 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:12.030
 put the simple checkpoints of the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.790
 race put the first checkpoint near 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:18.570
 and after the various checkpoints the farthest 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:20.269
 possible because you have to do a 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:23.970
 kilometer of race 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:26.250
 otherwise your build will be 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.380
 published so you won't even be able to 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:31.790
 use it once you have done a 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:35.250
 kilometer of road as checkpoints 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.709
 you must exit the cycle selection 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.940
 point and go on accessories and take 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.910
 the barriers 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:45.300
 you simply have to close the road 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:48.420
 after the first checkpoint and enclose 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.010
 all the way from the first to the end 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.519
 of the first set point at the beginning of 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:56.310
 race and then close everything well there 

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:59.400
 I recommend leaving a small one 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:02.790
 little space to go out so you have to 

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:06.480
 because you must also do the test e 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:10.200
 so you have to get to the end or 

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:15.690
 at the end of the race 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:17.489
 if you can't publish it well said 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.049
 this invites me to leave a nice video 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.970
 subscribe to the patri content channel 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.950
 past cities for citizen reforms 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.330
 to think description and convenient here 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.110
 below if you have any requests, you would have questions 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:27.110
 and bye bye
