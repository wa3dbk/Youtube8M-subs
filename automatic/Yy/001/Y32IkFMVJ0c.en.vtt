00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.969

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.719
 well, have fun 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.140
 so I hope there are still some 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.240
 interested and are not equal 

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.010
 jumped to the end of the video for all 

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.260
 who want to know how to pick 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.930
 Signs begin with a circle for 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.460
 his suitcase halves this circle 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.650
 each with a hot one 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.650
 horizontal and one vertical line 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.439
 on the horizontal, you distribute two 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.780
 small circles for its spicy 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.880
 but the details come 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.619
 Later, you put under the circle 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:22.679
 again a circle that is just as big 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:25.590
 like the circle of his head right 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:27.270
 pathos body as big as his head in 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.209
 we use the middle of the circle 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.399
 tiny triangle his nose and one 

00:01:30.209 --> 00:01:35.630
 happy smile is with a simple smile 

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.630
 to compare trick 

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:44.459
 his ears are one head long and 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.489
 be drawn pointed for 

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:50.129
 draw his right leg or quote 

00:01:47.489 --> 00:01:56.670
 we have a small oval at the bottom of the circle 

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:59.539
 Left to put his arms are straight 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.539
 under his head 

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:04.960
 for his left leg you call 

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.600
 one and a half price within the bottom 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:09.970
 circle in the right corner on it 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.730
 they are sketched so far no mobile 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.980
 as well as his right foot his cock 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.680
 runs jaggedly like a flash of lightning 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.610
 outside is getting wider 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.739
 His hands are not very elaborate 

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:23.769
 his fingers are like small spikes 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.900
 now only small details are drawn 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.370
 like his red cheeks and that 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.370
 reflected light in his eyes 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.299
 As you can see, it's slowly becoming a happy one 

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:03.760
 to recognize now we drive the 

00:03:01.299 --> 00:03:05.620
 Researcher with a fine long after in 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.900

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:50.610
