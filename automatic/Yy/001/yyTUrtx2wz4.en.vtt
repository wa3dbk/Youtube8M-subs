00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:09.240 
amount of water at high heat your goal
here<00:01:07.240> is<00:01:07.360> to<00:01:07.390> stop<00:01:07.750> conversion<00:01:08.380> and<00:01:08.590> to<00:01:08.619> rinse

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:09.250 
here is to stop conversion and to rinse

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.170 
here is to stop conversion and to rinse
the<00:01:09.430> remaining<00:01:09.820> sugars<00:01:10.090> from<00:01:10.210> the<00:01:10.390> grains<00:01:12.180> now

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the remaining sugars from the grains now

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.460 
the remaining sugars from the grains now
we're<00:01:13.330> going<00:01:13.450> to<00:01:13.509> rinse<00:01:13.690> the<00:01:13.869> grains<00:01:14.110> kind<00:01:14.380> of

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
we're going to rinse the grains kind of

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:23.660 
we're going to rinse the grains kind of
like<00:01:14.619> a<00:01:14.649> tea<00:01:14.860> bag

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.790 

discard<00:01:24.510> the<00:01:24.659> grains<00:01:24.900> and<00:01:25.170> now<00:01:25.560> you've

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
discard the grains and now you've

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.890 
discard the grains and now you've
essentially<00:01:26.190> created<00:01:26.670> work<00:01:26.850> bring<00:01:27.750> this

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
essentially created work bring this

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.930 
essentially created work bring this
liquid<00:01:28.110> to<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.470> boil<00:01:28.800> and<00:01:29.040> set<00:01:29.370> a<00:01:29.400> timer<00:01:29.640> for<00:01:29.909> 60

liquid to a boil and set a timer for 60
minutes<00:01:30.360> at<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.290> time<00:01:31.530> add<00:01:31.890> in<00:01:32.280> your<00:01:32.400> malted

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:32.760 
minutes at that time add in your malted

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.180 
minutes at that time add in your malted
barley<00:01:32.909> extract<00:01:33.570> and<00:01:33.840> your<00:01:34.080> hops<00:01:34.290> depending

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:35.190 
barley extract and your hops depending

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.830 
barley extract and your hops depending
on<00:01:35.280> your<00:01:35.369> recipe<00:01:35.520> you'll<00:01:35.909> be<00:01:36.030> adding<00:01:36.330> pops<00:01:36.570> at

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
on your recipe you'll be adding pops at

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:37.670 
on your recipe you'll be adding pops at
different<00:01:37.140> times

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
different times

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.010 
different times
typically<00:01:38.430> a<00:01:38.670> bittering<00:01:39.240> addition<00:01:39.570> at<00:01:39.660> 60

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
typically a bittering addition at 60

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.469 
typically a bittering addition at 60
minutes<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.470> flavor<00:01:41.040> addition<00:01:41.460> at<00:01:41.580> 30<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:42.060> then

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
minutes a flavor addition at 30 and then

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.270 
minutes a flavor addition at 30 and then
an<00:01:42.630> aroma<00:01:42.960> slash<00:01:43.500> flavor<00:01:43.860> at<00:01:44.160> 15<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.450> 0<00:01:45.479> minutes

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
an aroma slash flavor at 15 to 0 minutes

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.380 
an aroma slash flavor at 15 to 0 minutes
so<00:01:47.280> now<00:01:47.400> we're<00:01:47.520> going<00:01:47.610> to<00:01:47.670> add<00:01:47.820> our<00:01:47.850> extracts

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
so now we're going to add our extracts

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.719 
so now we're going to add our extracts
there's<00:01:48.810> two<00:01:49.050> main<00:01:49.290> types<00:01:49.500> of<00:01:49.680> extracts<00:01:50.130> here

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
there's two main types of extracts here

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.399 
there's two main types of extracts here
I'm<00:01:50.940> going<00:01:51.060> to<00:01:51.119> add<00:01:51.300> in<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.810> liquid<00:01:52.140> extract

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
I'm going to add in the liquid extract

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:57.469 
I'm going to add in the liquid extract
also<00:01:53.190> add<00:01:53.640> your<00:01:53.820> dry<00:01:53.970> extract<00:01:56.180> make<00:01:57.180> sure<00:01:57.360> to

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
also add your dry extract make sure to

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.810 
also add your dry extract make sure to
mix<00:01:57.600> it<00:01:57.810> in<00:01:57.869> really<00:01:57.930> well<00:01:58.460> bring<00:01:59.460> this<00:01:59.580> to<00:01:59.789> a

boil for 60 minutes and add your hops

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.490 
boil for 60 minutes and add your hops
depending<00:02:02.820> on<00:02:02.910> your<00:02:03.030> recipe<00:02:03.420> for<00:02:03.660> this<00:02:04.140> beer
