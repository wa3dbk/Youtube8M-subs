00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
box and then finally antenna I kind of

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.300 
box and then finally antenna I kind of
realized<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.350> didn't<00:01:52.530> show<00:01:52.680> that<00:01:52.710> so<00:01:52.979> well<00:01:53.130> and

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
realized I didn't show that so well and

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.789 
realized I didn't show that so well and
actually<00:01:53.990> review<00:01:54.990> video<00:01:55.140> this<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.560> the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
actually review video this is the

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.280 
actually review video this is the
antenna<00:01:56.070> and<00:01:56.369> yeah<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:57.240> screw<00:01:57.570> in<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.110> then

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
antenna and yeah to screw in and then

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.590 
antenna and yeah to screw in and then
it's<00:01:59.189> kind<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.460> compact<00:01:59.909> feels<00:02:00.299> a<00:02:00.479> little

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it's kind of compact feels a little

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.650 
it's kind of compact feels a little
heavy<00:02:00.840> and<00:02:00.960> then<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> can<00:02:01.469> actually

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:07.660 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:10.540 

extend<00:02:08.660> the<00:02:08.899> antenna<00:02:09.350> that<00:02:09.380> you<00:02:09.890> need<00:02:10.070> and<00:02:10.520> you

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
extend the antenna that you need and you

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.390 
extend the antenna that you need and you
might<00:02:11.030> need<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.330> because<00:02:11.540> it's<00:02:11.720> not<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:13.130> my

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
might need it because it's not in my

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.700 
might need it because it's not in my
experience<00:02:13.520> it<00:02:14.240> doesn't<00:02:14.720> work<00:02:14.870> as<00:02:15.170> well<00:02:15.500> but

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:15.710 
experience it doesn't work as well but

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:17.980 
experience it doesn't work as well but
it's<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.730> a<00:02:16.850> reasonably<00:02:17.240> working<00:02:17.570> antenna<00:02:17.900> I

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:17.990 
it's it's a reasonably working antenna I

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.070 
it's it's a reasonably working antenna I
guess<00:02:18.230> so<00:02:18.770> that's<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.240> no<00:02:20.240> other<00:02:20.450> extras<00:02:20.930> in

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
guess so that's it no other extras in

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.820 
guess so that's it no other extras in
the<00:02:21.110> box<00:02:21.350> here
