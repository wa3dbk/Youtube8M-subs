00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:29.720 
to point open it up and then we're going

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.140 
to point open it up and then we're going
to<00:02:29.780> fold<00:02:29.959> the<00:02:30.140> opposite<00:02:30.650> way<00:02:33.910> okay<00:02:34.910> so<00:02:34.970> then

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:35.150

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.600 

okay<00:02:52.170> so<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:52.560> we<00:02:52.620> should<00:02:53.070> have<00:02:53.130> a<00:02:53.310> piece<00:02:53.580> that

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
okay so now we should have a piece that

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.410 
okay so now we should have a piece that
looks<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.970> this

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
looks like this

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.660 
looks like this
now<00:02:55.260> we're<00:02:55.410> going<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:55.560> go<00:02:55.680> ahead<00:02:55.770> and<00:02:56.010> fold<00:02:56.250> the

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
now we're going to go ahead and fold the

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:00.230 
now we're going to go ahead and fold the
points<00:02:57.180> back<00:02:57.540> on<00:02:57.840> itself<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:58.860> I<00:02:59.760> like<00:03:00.030> taking

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:00.240 
points back on itself and I like taking

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:18.500 
points back on itself and I like taking
the<00:03:00.510> points<00:03:00.930> just<00:03:01.230> past<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:02.220> edge<00:03:02.400> there

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:18.510 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.090 

okay<00:03:19.540> so<00:03:19.840> it<00:03:19.900> should<00:03:20.050> look<00:03:20.170> like<00:03:20.230> that<00:03:20.380> it's

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
this is cut it one and a half by one and

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.210 
this is cut it one and a half by one and
a<00:03:27.790> half<00:03:28.230> and<00:03:29.230> this<00:03:29.410> is<00:03:29.470> just<00:03:29.830> pretty<00:03:30.040> much

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
a half and this is just pretty much

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:34.020 
a half and this is just pretty much
covering<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.270> inside<00:03:32.670> unless<00:03:33.670> you<00:03:33.850> want<00:03:34.000> to

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:34.030 
covering the inside unless you want to

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:36.120 
covering the inside unless you want to
keep<00:03:34.209> that<00:03:34.360> open<00:03:34.540> but<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:34.989> figured<00:03:35.500> I'd<00:03:35.650> cover
