00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:09.560
 yes yes the app now also the apple company 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.660
 in the trend of so-called smart switches 

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:13.580
 mixed in there is tough competition for 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.670
 the products of android rail about 

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:18.670
 the lg watch but why actually 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:27.650
 the design they pretty elegant 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.990
 processed from no it is even 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.820
 she has a full body made of aluminum 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.729
 which goes directly into the glass 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.319
 a pleasure for the eye and there is 

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:36.949
 not only by it but also by that 

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:39.229
 display 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:41.329
 Here you can not see something like pixel 

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:44.539
 is just totally awesome with 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:47.420
 incredible 326 pixels on every inch 

00:00:44.539 --> 00:00:49.159
 so towered over the competition extremely 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.449
 well thought out are the functions of the 

00:00:49.159 --> 00:00:53.449
 both sides buttons 

00:00:50.449 --> 00:00:55.999
 here is the digital crown she is 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.799
 Turning and dismantling usually one uses these 

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.379
 to select or scroll things 

00:00:57.799 --> 00:01:01.909
 the long button is reminiscent of the switch 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.190
 of the iphon but no 

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:07.540
 With him one has access at any time 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.540
 the most important contacts 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.900
 Induction charge as already mentioned that 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.670
 housing has no openings because of it 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:18.020
 had to integrate a technology 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.320
 Will that charge without 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.210
 carrier medium makes possible the induction 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.590
 but something plastically acting magnet 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.440
 can be easily at the rott 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:30.470
 click install and what is so 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.960
 actually on a battery of the one 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.190
 can accompany just two days and 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.910
 that only with a bit of luck 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.910
 what a shame 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:45.420
 the operating system roger it says something 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.620
 the thing makes it work and that 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.150
 Apple got pretty good too 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.730
 implemented it offers numerous 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.620
 functions about the possibility beside 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.260
 the specifications also own dials 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:57.390
 create so-called watch faces 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.160
 but also more restricted 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.870
 You can also set which 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.790
 notify her of your iphone 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.310
 wanted to show on the watch 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.130
 there is a very special one for ios 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.720
 In addition, app on the clock can not be 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.550
 only apple apps use others 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.560
 Developers have the opportunity of theirs 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.270
 iphone apps with an extension for 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:20.030
 to provide the device 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:20.030
 and by the way short apps were banned 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:28.890
 speakers and micro yes was very nice 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.420
 Also the idea of watch a speaker 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:32.190
 and a microphone to spend 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.170
 Here Apple has probably but a bit 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.330
 You can not do that so seriously 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.130
 often to take the phone is that 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:40.709
 talk too quiet and you hold yourself 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:43.610
 the clock on the ear that can hardly make sense 

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:43.610
 its purpose and the thing 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.600
 water compatibility 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.220
 what a topic that's why 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.620
 many rumors and even more 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.630
 unboxing came on youtube showed up 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.880
 videos online where people watch 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.200
 test under water 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:07.240
 amazingly the clock held in 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.670
 for more than an hour under water 

00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:11.680
 officially Apple says it with a maximum of 30 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.970
 minutes and that at half a meter 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.560
 but no matter 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:21.150
 Wash the hands and showering right 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:23.530
 completely out of the disadvantages 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:25.300
 next to the already mentioned battery there is 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.570
 a few other disadvantages to 

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:30.400
 example the onyx glass sounds great 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:32.470
 but nothing but normal gorilla 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.450
 Of course, the glass tea cracks wanted the 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.490
 stability test a link to his 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:38.170
 videos in the video description after 

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:41.230
 wear longer one falls on that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:43.420
 This sports bracelet made of rubber-like 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:45.280
 fabric is not that great it is 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:47.110
 actually a bit uncomfortable and then 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:48.820
 moved one or the other place 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:51.330
 Well, luckily enough 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:51.330
 alternative
