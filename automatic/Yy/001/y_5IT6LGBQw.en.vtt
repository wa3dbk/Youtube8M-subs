the<00:00:56.489> left<00:00:56.699> okay<00:00:57.660> now<00:00:58.350> for<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:58.949> particular

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
the left okay now for this particular

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.700 
the left okay now for this particular
pattern<00:01:00.120> we're<00:01:00.750> going<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.930> synchronize<00:01:01.410> the

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
pattern we're going to synchronize the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.179 
pattern we're going to synchronize the
feet<00:01:01.980> with<00:01:02.789> a<00:01:02.820> different<00:01:03.750> coordination<00:01:04.350> so

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
feet with a different coordination so

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:06.530 
feet with a different coordination so
you<00:01:05.280> might<00:01:05.580> be<00:01:05.700> used<00:01:05.909> to<00:01:06.000> doing<00:01:06.210> something

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
you might be used to doing something

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:13.270 
you might be used to doing something
like<00:01:06.840> this

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.620 

and<00:01:13.960> that's<00:01:14.960> where<00:01:15.229> the<00:01:15.380> first<00:01:15.619> right<00:01:15.920> is

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
and that's where the first right is

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.120 
and that's where the first right is
synchronized<00:01:17.630> with<00:01:17.869> the<00:01:18.229> bass<00:01:18.530> drum<00:01:18.770> and<00:01:19.100> the

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
synchronized with the bass drum and the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.910 
synchronized with the bass drum and the
first<00:01:19.640> left<00:01:19.940> is<00:01:20.330> synchronized<00:01:21.049> with<00:01:21.229> a<00:01:21.350> hi-hat

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:21.920 
first left is synchronized with a hi-hat

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.499 
first left is synchronized with a hi-hat
there<00:01:22.220> no<00:01:22.759> we're<00:01:22.940> not<00:01:23.090> going<00:01:23.299> to<00:01:23.360> do<00:01:23.479> that

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:23.509 
there no we're not going to do that

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:25.600 
there no we're not going to do that
we're<00:01:24.200> not<00:01:24.350> going<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:24.560> do<00:01:24.650> that<00:01:24.680> at<00:01:24.950> all<00:01:25.130> what

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:25.610 
we're not going to do that at all what

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.350 
we're not going to do that at all what
we're<00:01:25.700> going<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.880> do<00:01:25.970> is<00:01:26.090> we're<00:01:26.180> going<00:01:26.270> to

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.570 
we're going to do is we're going to
start<00:01:26.540> our<00:01:26.690> pattern<00:01:27.020> with<00:01:27.470> a<00:01:27.500> one<00:01:27.979> single

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:28.580 
start our pattern with a one single

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:30.790 
start our pattern with a one single
stroke<00:01:28.880> on<00:01:29.090> the<00:01:29.180> right<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:30.200> that's<00:01:30.590> going<00:01:30.740> to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:30.800 
stroke on the right and that's going to

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:32.590 
stroke on the right and that's going to
be<00:01:30.920> coordinated<00:01:31.159> with<00:01:31.610> the<00:01:31.759> bass<00:01:32.090> drum<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
be coordinated with the bass drum and

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.870 
be coordinated with the bass drum and
from<00:01:33.050> that<00:01:33.229> on<00:01:33.470> we're<00:01:34.070> gonna<00:01:34.190> do<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.520> double

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
from that on we're gonna do the double

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:37.300 
from that on we're gonna do the double
strokes<00:01:35.240> so<00:01:35.840> one<00:01:36.049> single<00:01:36.530> right<00:01:36.770> at<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.040> start

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
strokes so one single right at the start

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.399 
strokes so one single right at the start
and<00:01:37.580> that's<00:01:37.909> going<00:01:38.060> to<00:01:38.119> displace<00:01:38.409> that's

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
and that's going to displace that's

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:42.370 
and that's going to displace that's
going<00:01:39.619> to<00:01:39.680> displace<00:01:40.509> where<00:01:41.509> the<00:01:41.690> double<00:01:42.080> sits

00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:42.380 
going to displace where the double sits

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.639 
going to displace where the double sits
in<00:01:42.619> relation<00:01:43.070> to<00:01:43.190> the<00:01:43.310> feet<00:01:43.600> so<00:01:44.600> we<00:01:44.810> got<00:01:45.020> one

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
in relation to the feet so we got one

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:59.950 
in relation to the feet so we got one
single<00:01:46.250> and<00:01:46.899> then<00:01:47.899> from<00:01:48.229> that<00:01:48.289> on<00:01:48.759> doubles<00:01:58.960> so

00:01:59.950 --> 00:01:59.960 
single and then from that on doubles so

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.200 
single and then from that on doubles so
it's<00:02:00.110> the<00:02:00.170> second<00:02:00.679> stroke<00:02:01.000> that's<00:02:02.000> now

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:02.210 
it's the second stroke that's now

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:05.559 
it's the second stroke that's now
coordinated<00:02:03.110> with<00:02:03.710> the<00:02:03.770> foot<00:02:04.340> okay<00:02:05.179> let's<00:02:05.479> do

00:02:05.559 --> 00:02:05.569 
coordinated with the foot okay let's do

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:16.440 
coordinated with the foot okay let's do
that<00:02:05.690> again

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.690 

it<00:02:17.450> leads<00:02:17.810> us<00:02:18.170> to<00:02:18.439> focus<00:02:18.650> more<00:02:19.099> on<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:19.310> second

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
it leads us to focus more on the second

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.630 
it leads us to focus more on the second
stroke<00:02:19.970> which<00:02:20.750> is<00:02:20.930> what<00:02:21.110> you<00:02:21.230> need<00:02:21.349> to<00:02:21.530> do<00:02:21.709> okay

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
stroke which is what you need to do okay

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:32.920 
stroke which is what you need to do okay
one<00:02:23.120> single<00:02:23.599> then<00:02:23.959> doubles<00:02:31.510> okay<00:02:32.510> guys<00:02:32.720> you

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
one single then doubles okay guys you

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:35.819 
one single then doubles okay guys you
got<00:02:32.959> that<00:02:33.230> now<00:02:33.440> I'm<00:02:33.890> glad<00:02:34.069> to<00:02:34.250> hear<00:02:34.370> it<00:02:34.489> now

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:52.549 
we're going to use the toms in a minute

00:02:52.549 --> 00:03:06.640 
we're going to use the toms in a minute
but<00:02:52.670> let's<00:02:52.700> just<00:02:52.940> reinforce<00:02:53.720> that<00:03:05.379> okay<00:03:06.379> guys

very<00:03:13.849> very<00:03:13.940> first<00:03:14.269> note<00:03:14.540> which<00:03:14.959> displaces<00:03:15.349> the

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:15.829 
very very first note which displaces the

00:03:15.829 --> 00:03:17.619 
very very first note which displaces the
double<00:03:16.370> stroke<00:03:16.579> against<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.030> feet<00:03:17.239> so<00:03:17.599> it's

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:17.629
