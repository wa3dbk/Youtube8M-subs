00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.370
 it's very good all 63 

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:09.580
 in the William in by as you see in the 

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:12.850
 title this this video will be about 

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:14.620
 what the capital is like what you see 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:17.410
 in this case it's from a player who 

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:20.019
 call charge if you want to visit and what 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.390
 you will have the alliance of iron and fire 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:25.210
 I'm giving him advertising or anything 

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.189
 simply an example because this is 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.829
 one that has seemed very good I give 

00:00:27.189 --> 00:00:33.910
 Congratulations to get it 

00:00:29.829 --> 00:00:37.900
 the first thing I'm going to talk about is what 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:42.250
 that would be how it is physically and then already 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.160
 what they have important new and good to 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.920
 the best are others on the towers 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:51.250
 explain this and that's it because nothing is going to 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:54.010
 get out and I'm not going to do it very long 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.630
 roy and I want to do the other one not what 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.300
 we would have to start as 

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.860
 important the most shocking would be a 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:05.220
 palace even has its own well 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.140
 To do this you need a lot to go up 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.570
 and have a pretty powerful alliance 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.150
 what will I say later 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:15.850
 it's a building that is only level 1 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.060
 unless they know the updates 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:21.820
 the rest would be everything normal they will need 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.810
 many guard posts because if not 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.810
 people attack her 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:31.229
 and then also another very very cool thing 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.750
 is the real warehouse that is level 1 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.990
 although maybe they make updates 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.170
 I know I have two stores on 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:43.289
 real and the warehouse or the deposit 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.259
 you accept that you are the normal one then you would have 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.929
 naranjitas as always squares of 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.179
 festival that cost a paste and the 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.520
 tower as everywhere and then the 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:57.179
 I will explain what is important 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:00.149
 of this because having there is your achievement 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:02.310
 good treats pit for alliances is 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:05.700
 as your heart what matters most of 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.009
 everything and for example have the 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:11.060
 good alliances you see that it's iron and 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:14.849
 fire iron and fire is the repera go 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:18.299
 and all day with the alliances that are 

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:21.150
 in wars they were what is to say everything 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:24.959
 all the time attacking and also for 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.780
 avoid them to those of the allies of this 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.670
 player will not end they will always be 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.709
 defending 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.950
 and something quite shocking the truth 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:39.090
 I'm going to lie to you if you want to see it look 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.550
 some video is that they have come to attack 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.300
 with many soldiers because here in 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:48.750
 actually if I'm going to attack you only 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:52.290
 you leave with not many and that is how they are attacking 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:56.250
 constantly and you can arrive or you can 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:59.459
 have more when you get here to see 110 thousand 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:01.620
 soldiers that when I saw him I stayed and 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.200
 you can also get to see 10,000 just 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.190
 it's depends on the amount of people 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:10.799
 troops that this is what we send him and if 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:13.730
 I do not give to attack I get this that 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:16.799
 like a tower effect doctor joseph to 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.340
 or is that the towers means more 

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:23.700
 as to increase the video effect 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.459
 be it here puts it 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:29.250
 effect of real towers attack bonuses in 

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:31.290
 the cavities that give you more things to 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:34.470
 get captured a new tower as 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:38.430
 me better if chicken is good or I 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.640
 it is a good piece of clothing so that it works 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.950
 these towers I say it would be almost 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.090
 impossible to win with only one 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:49.530
 battle when you end up winning 

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.209
 I hope you liked it especially 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.220
 for those who are starting and who 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.980
 say oysters that every cool style 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:59.099
 is if you want to see it I 've already told you 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:03.120
 carbonell called this good uncle are 

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:04.950
 Congratulations and hopefully more than three and 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.980
 Well I hope you liked it later 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:11.120
 the best that video and until next time 

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.120
