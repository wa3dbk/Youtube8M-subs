00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.760 

back<00:00:00.960> we're<00:00:01.380> testing<00:00:01.770> the<00:00:01.920> stair<00:00:02.929> which<00:00:03.929> as

00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:04.770 
back we're testing the stair which as

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.190 
back we're testing the stair which as
you<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:04.950> see<00:00:05.130> the<00:00:05.490> sensor<00:00:05.879> is<00:00:06.029> right<00:00:06.240> here

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:09.200 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.749 

that's<00:00:10.200> the<00:00:10.290> most<00:00:10.710> sensitive<00:00:11.160> part<00:00:11.490> of<00:00:11.580> this

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that's the most sensitive part of this

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.150 
that's the most sensitive part of this
snare<00:00:12.000> but<00:00:12.320> really<00:00:13.320> that's<00:00:13.380> really<00:00:13.679> a<00:00:13.830> good

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
snare but really that's really a good

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:27.350 
snare but really that's really a good
sensitivity<00:00:14.630> overall

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:27.360 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.729 

then<00:00:28.360> the<00:00:28.510> room<00:00:28.690> sound<00:00:33.510> just<00:00:34.510> another<00:00:35.050> mistake

00:00:35.729 --> 00:00:35.739 
then the room sound just another mistake

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.210 
then the room sound just another mistake
is<00:00:35.920> for<00:00:36.220> my<00:00:36.340> finger<00:00:37.590> it's<00:00:38.590> a<00:00:38.650> little<00:00:38.860> harder<00:00:39.070> to

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
is for my finger it's a little harder to

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:43.830 
is for my finger it's a little harder to
get<00:00:39.340> the<00:00:39.489> continue<00:00:41.910> know<00:00:42.910> anybody<00:00:43.540> guys<00:00:43.660> when

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:43.840 
get the continue know anybody guys when

00:00:43.840 --> 00:01:14.370 
get the continue know anybody guys when
I<00:00:43.930> think<00:01:11.010> and<00:01:12.240> the<00:01:13.240> black<00:01:13.450> mesh<00:01:13.690> looks<00:01:14.020> a<00:01:14.229> lot

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
I think and the black mesh looks a lot

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.020 
I think and the black mesh looks a lot
better<00:01:14.590> on<00:01:14.740> those<00:01:14.920> drums<00:01:15.280> and<00:01:15.580> this<00:01:16.770> really

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
better on those drums and this really

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.170 
better on those drums and this really
really<00:01:19.030> really<00:01:19.180> strong

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:29.050 

this<00:01:22.600> is<00:01:22.780> the<00:01:22.900> regular<00:01:23.229> mesh

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.819 

as<00:01:30.060> you<00:01:30.210> can<00:01:30.390> see<00:01:30.570> it's<00:01:30.750> already<00:01:31.079> started<00:01:31.799> to

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
as you can see it's already started to

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:35.090 
as you can see it's already started to
trip<00:01:32.520> so<00:01:32.850> I'm<00:01:33.060> going<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.329> replace<00:01:33.979> the<00:01:34.979> other

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.490 
trip so I'm going to replace the other
drums<00:01:35.460> with<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.270> black<00:01:36.539> mesh<00:01:36.780> which<00:01:37.110> is<00:01:37.140> a<00:01:37.289> lot

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
drums with the black mesh which is a lot

00:01:37.500 --> 00:02:02.620 
drums with the black mesh which is a lot
