had girls with winged eyeliner so I

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.030

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
that I'm normally what I normally would

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.410 
that I'm normally what I normally would
just<00:01:22.170> do<00:01:22.350> like<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.590> little<00:01:22.970> swoop<00:01:23.970> but<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.270> you

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
just do like a little swoop but as you

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.020 
just do like a little swoop but as you
can<00:01:24.570> see<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:24.840> drew<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.470> out<00:01:25.650> as<00:01:25.950> far<00:01:26.280> as<00:01:26.340> I<00:01:26.670> wanted

to and then I started connecting the

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.700 
to and then I started connecting the
thin<00:01:30.030> line<00:01:30.299> that<00:01:30.570> I<00:01:30.600> had<00:01:30.780> already<00:01:30.990> made<00:01:31.380> and

thin line that I had already made and
then<00:01:32.040> I<00:01:32.070> also<00:01:32.520> decided<00:01:33.240> to<00:01:33.450> make<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.930> thicker<00:01:34.170> I

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
then I also decided to make it thicker I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.760 
then I also decided to make it thicker I
decided<00:01:36.270> to<00:01:36.450> also<00:01:36.659> keep<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> real<00:01:37.439> time

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
decided to also keep this in real time

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.270 
decided to also keep this in real time

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
eyelashes are definitely a must and I

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.850 
eyelashes are definitely a must and I
use<00:02:04.740> these<00:02:05.040> to<00:02:05.369> add<00:02:05.899> more<00:02:06.899> lashes<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.619> kind<00:02:07.799> of

use these to add more lashes and kind of

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.900 
use these to add more lashes and kind of
make<00:02:08.039> it<00:02:08.069> look<00:02:08.310> more<00:02:08.610> full<00:02:08.989> and<00:02:10.550> then<00:02:11.550> when

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
make it look more full and then when

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.430 
make it look more full and then when
that's<00:02:12.030> started<00:02:12.510> to<00:02:12.629> dry

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
that's started to dry

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.040 
that's started to dry
ahead<00:02:13.740> and<00:02:13.860> took<00:02:14.010> expresso<00:02:14.820> by<00:02:15.000> NYX<00:02:15.630> they

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
ahead and took expresso by NYX they

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.750 
ahead and took expresso by NYX they
almost<00:02:16.440> seems<00:02:16.620> like<00:02:16.740> a<00:02:16.890> bronzer<00:02:17.460> if<00:02:17.580> you<00:02:17.640> look

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:17.760 
almost seems like a bronzer if you look

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.730 
almost seems like a bronzer if you look
at<00:02:17.850> a<00:02:17.880> picture<00:02:18.060> of<00:02:18.270> Farrah<00:02:18.600> Fawcett<00:02:19.170> shoes<00:02:19.440> of

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
at a picture of Farrah Fawcett shoes of

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.340 
at a picture of Farrah Fawcett shoes of
almost<00:02:20.430> a<00:02:20.580> bronzer<00:02:21.030> as<00:02:21.210> like<00:02:21.480> her<00:02:21.690> blush

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
almost a bronzer as like her blush

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.460 
almost a bronzer as like her blush
so<00:02:22.830> this<00:02:23.160> expresso<00:02:23.730> it's<00:02:24.330> a<00:02:24.420> blush<00:02:24.720> but<00:02:25.290> it's

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
so this expresso it's a blush but it's

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.340 
so this expresso it's a blush but it's
also<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.980> darker<00:02:26.640> deep<00:02:26.940> brown<00:02:27.300> color<00:02:27.360> so<00:02:28.110> I<00:02:28.140> used

needs to start then I combed back where
that<00:03:33.330> extra<00:03:33.780> hair<00:03:34.140> was<00:03:34.380> because<00:03:34.800> this<00:03:35.070> is

where you're gonna tease you already
have<00:03:36.989> volume<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.500> guess<00:03:37.739> you<00:03:37.920> probably<00:03:38.100> don't

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550

need<00:03:38.670> to<00:03:38.730> do<00:03:38.910> this<00:03:39.090> but<00:03:39.540> I<00:03:40.280> really<00:03:41.280> don't<00:03:41.459> have

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
need to do this but I really don't have

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.880 
need to do this but I really don't have
volume<00:03:41.970> and<00:03:42.150> I<00:03:42.209> definitely<00:03:42.720> need<00:03:42.989> to<00:03:43.290> do<00:03:43.680> this

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
volume and I definitely need to do this

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.180 
volume and I definitely need to do this
step<00:03:44.130> and<00:03:44.660> I<00:03:45.660> went<00:03:45.900> ahead<00:03:46.019> and<00:03:46.470> that<00:03:46.800> combed

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
step and I went ahead and that combed

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.090 
step and I went ahead and that combed
kind<00:03:47.730> of<00:03:47.820> making<00:03:47.970> a<00:03:48.180> sea<00:03:48.450> motion<00:03:49.230> as<00:03:49.590> I<00:03:49.890> was

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
that combing and I went ahead and just

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.530

continue to tease the section until I

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.300 
continue to tease the section until I
thought<00:03:57.810> it<00:03:57.930> was<00:03:58.050> teased<00:03:58.350> enough<00:03:58.739> put<00:03:59.130> that

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
thought it was teased enough put that

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.729 
thought it was teased enough put that
forward<00:03:59.640> and<00:04:00.030> then<00:04:00.630> I<00:04:00.660> went<00:04:00.900> and<00:04:01.080> grabbed<00:04:01.320> the

00:04:01.729 --> 00:04:01.739 
forward and then I went and grabbed the

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:03.920 
forward and then I went and grabbed the
back<00:04:02.010> section<00:04:02.820> you<00:04:03.360> could<00:04:03.480> do<00:04:03.600> as<00:04:03.690> many

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
back section you could do as many

back section you could do as many
sections<00:04:04.230> as<00:04:04.590> you<00:04:04.769> want<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.250> would<00:04:05.310> chose<00:04:05.640> to<00:04:05.910> do

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:06.060 
sections as you want I would chose to do

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:08.660 
sections as you want I would chose to do
two<00:04:06.090> and<00:04:06.690> then<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.530> kind<00:04:07.890> of<00:04:07.950> cleaned<00:04:08.160> up<00:04:08.489> the

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
two and then I kind of cleaned up the

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:10.790 
two and then I kind of cleaned up the
teasing<00:04:09.180> by<00:04:09.390> adding<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:10.200> sections<00:04:10.650> that

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:10.800 
teasing by adding the sections that

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.130 
teasing by adding the sections that
didn't<00:04:11.160> get<00:04:11.220> teased<00:04:11.489> and<00:04:11.880> then<00:04:12.450> I<00:04:12.480> combed<00:04:12.989> it

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
didn't get teased and then I combed it

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.430 
didn't get teased and then I combed it
through<00:04:13.709> to<00:04:14.130> kind<00:04:14.310> of<00:04:14.430> smooth<00:04:14.730> it<00:04:14.820> out<00:04:15.230> now<00:04:16.230> I'm

bobby<00:05:13.889> pin<00:05:14.129> that<00:05:14.159> you<00:05:14.400> have<00:05:14.639> but<00:05:14.940> if<00:05:15.030> you<00:05:15.060> don't

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
bobby pin that you have but if you don't

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.480 
bobby pin that you have but if you don't
then<00:05:15.539> whatever<00:05:16.110> it's<00:05:16.650> not<00:05:16.680> a<00:05:16.800> big<00:05:17.009> deal<00:05:17.190> and

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
then whatever it's not a big deal and

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:18.830 
then whatever it's not a big deal and
then<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.639> went<00:05:17.849> ahead<00:05:18.000> and<00:05:18.150> tightened<00:05:18.659> it<00:05:18.719> a

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:18.840 
then I went ahead and tightened it a

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:21.110 
then I went ahead and tightened it a
little<00:05:18.990> bit<00:05:19.199> and<00:05:19.590> then<00:05:20.310> I<00:05:20.340> took<00:05:20.460> out<00:05:20.759> the<00:05:20.940> bobby

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
little bit and then I took out the bobby

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.879 
little bit and then I took out the bobby
pins<00:05:21.419> that<00:05:21.629> were<00:05:21.779> holding<00:05:22.199> in<00:05:22.319> my<00:05:22.560> pouf

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:22.889 
pins that were holding in my pouf

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:25.010 
pins that were holding in my pouf
because<00:05:23.400> now<00:05:23.580> I'm<00:05:23.789> pretty<00:05:23.969> sure<00:05:24.210> -<00:05:24.599> must<00:05:24.810> say

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:25.020 
because now I'm pretty sure - must say

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.959 
because now I'm pretty sure - must say
how<00:05:25.259> it<00:05:25.409> is<00:05:25.560> and<00:05:25.919> I<00:05:26.039> wanted<00:05:26.310> to<00:05:26.370> hide<00:05:26.639> my

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
how it is and I wanted to hide my

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:29.779 
how it is and I wanted to hide my
ponytail<00:05:27.479> so<00:05:28.139> I<00:05:28.169> wrapped<00:05:28.500> my<00:05:28.740> hair<00:05:29.069> around<00:05:29.580> it

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:29.789 
ponytail so I wrapped my hair around it

00:05:29.789 --> 00:05:32.390 
ponytail so I wrapped my hair around it
and<00:05:29.939> then<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.300> pinned<00:05:30.629> it<00:05:30.810> at<00:05:30.990> the<00:05:31.620> bottom<00:05:31.979> just

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
and then I pinned it at the bottom just

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.219 
and then I pinned it at the bottom just
to<00:05:32.550> hide<00:05:32.819> the<00:05:33.000> ponytail<00:05:33.479> and<00:05:33.659> make<00:05:33.779> sure<00:05:33.960> that

00:05:34.219 --> 00:05:34.229

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:42.439 
to hide the ponytail and make sure that
looks<00:05:34.590> a<00:05:34.830> little<00:05:34.979> bit<00:05:35.219> more<00:05:35.490> clean<00:05:40.099> and<00:05:41.419> then<00:05:42.419> I

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
looks a little bit more clean and then I

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.059 
looks a little bit more clean and then I
went<00:05:42.779> ahead<00:05:42.900> and<00:05:43.080> added<00:05:43.259> the<00:05:43.500> headband<00:05:43.889> you

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:46.100 
went ahead and added the headband you
definitely<00:05:44.520> don't<00:05:44.580> need<00:05:44.699> to<00:05:45.089> but<00:05:45.629> I<00:05:45.690> thought

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:46.110 
definitely don't need to but I thought

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:47.899 
definitely don't need to but I thought
it<00:05:46.289> would<00:05:46.379> look<00:05:46.440> cuter<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:47.250> it<00:05:47.370> comes<00:05:47.580> with<00:05:47.669> it

00:05:47.899 --> 00:05:47.909 
it would look cuter and it comes with it

00:05:47.909 --> 00:05:50.180 
it would look cuter and it comes with it
so<00:05:48.089> why<00:05:48.270> not<00:05:48.300> and<00:05:48.839> then<00:05:48.870> I<00:05:49.379> kind<00:05:49.680> of<00:05:49.740> pulled<00:05:50.009> up

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:50.190 
so why not and then I kind of pulled up

00:05:50.190 --> 00:05:51.980 
so why not and then I kind of pulled up
some<00:05:50.400> of<00:05:50.460> my<00:05:50.490> sections<00:05:51.120> smoothed<00:05:51.569> it<00:05:51.870> out

00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:51.990 
some of my sections smoothed it out

00:05:51.990 --> 00:05:54.140 
some of my sections smoothed it out
brought<00:05:52.800> my<00:05:53.129> bangs<00:05:53.400> a<00:05:53.639> little<00:05:53.669> bit<00:05:54.000> more

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
brought my bangs a little bit more

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.899 
brought my bangs a little bit more
forward<00:05:54.419> so<00:05:54.750> they're<00:05:54.900> not<00:05:55.050> hidden<00:05:55.409> and<00:05:55.909> that's

00:05:56.899 --> 00:05:56.909 
forward so they're not hidden and that's
