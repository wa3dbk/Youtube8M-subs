00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.789 
and yeah my fps is kind of dropping down
so<00:01:46.680> it's<00:01:47.220> maybe<00:01:47.460> slowing<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.530> little<00:01:49.530> bit<00:01:49.680> i

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
so it's maybe slowing a little bit i

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.620 
so it's maybe slowing a little bit i
don't<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.040> how<00:01:50.220> you<00:01:50.759> guys<00:01:50.939> can<00:01:51.149> see<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:51.420> but
