00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.569
 hello everyone in today's video os 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.399
 I will teach how to paint the nails type 

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:08.700
 leopard with these vivid colors that 

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.610
 you see here 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:16.860
 For this we will need three colors 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:20.369
 that I chose from it are these blue rose and 

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:23.250
 black and as you can see to do the 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:25.559
 nails used these special nail polishes 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.579
 that have this finite point that was like that 

00:00:25.559 --> 00:00:30.689
 we can make the drawings very easily 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.369
 we will start with the first step that is 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.369
 apply blue paint 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:37.379
 in the nail 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.820
 with a layer is usually enough because 

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.820
 later when making the drawings you do not notice 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:56.280
 ok then we apply a layer of blue 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:06.369
 and wait for the nail to dry 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.080
 Once the nail is dry we will apply the color 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.659
 pink 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:13.500
 we will make small 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.960
 circulitos 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.380
 what you like most the forms that 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380
 you prefer 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.970
 in the place you want, it's worth 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:31.120
 after doing this we will wait for 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:32.440
 new to dry and we will apply the color 

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:34.440
 black 

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:37.220
 once that color is pink 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.400
 we will apply the color black 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:42.390
 we must make some parallel stripes worth 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.620
 around 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:48.730
 of the little pink circles you do not need 

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:51.850
 that you follow 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:56.000
 the same the same way in all the 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:59.500
 you can make different rounds 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.500
 different ways 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.230
 and this would be more or less the result 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:12.800
 thank you very much for watching the video and 

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.800
 until next time
