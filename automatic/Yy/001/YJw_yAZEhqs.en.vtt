00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:11.790
 and so people who say that the beginning of 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.429
 the euro channel rose today and I just start to 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.260
 class at three thirty in the morning 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:19.770
 so I'll talk a little more 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.630
 I ask for the understanding of our 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.730
 problems with people who buy the 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:29.369
 sony player is like putting a touch 

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.920
 on the device 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.980
 then there was justice of the simple men 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.870
 to put a touch of the device through 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.180
 two applications the first 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:51.289
 application I'm going to use an application 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:55.440
 called se shop and active in this first 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:01:00.890
 black or quite free application 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:04.140
 take a small practice to install the 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.390
 application it will give you options of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.450
 some on monitors for you are 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.640
 putting as talks we have in all 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:16.159
 pretty funny 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.159
 so what do you have to download to display me? 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.830
 to continue here, I wanted to 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:34.960
 luxury of downloading some pictures put a 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.260
 bottom cell and such but the important 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:43.360
 is that today are the ringtones that I 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:47.920
 I have several of you all available. 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:51.540
 can see and for example I want to 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.540
 music, what is it here? 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 her teaching that you do not want to 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:23.200
 none of these songs are here anymore 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:24.040
 Like music, the music in your 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:46.570
 cell phone 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:50.550
 and think that he is the creator of the idea for 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:56.260
 the first one you click on it 

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:57.670
 I hope to find out we have to download 15 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.380
 thousand 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:06.459
 the application we need to know that such 

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.080
 represent here below and choose a 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.080
 music you just put on the screen 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:18.330
 if you click on the company screen all 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:27.370
 the songs available on your phone 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:35.350
 choose the music here would already have a 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:38.620
 point where I want touch start 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.780
 I want to end the toonz, so it's 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.360
 I need to pick the cute one you want. 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:47.680
 that begins to observe that ends search 

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.650
 Do you want to understand who saves the 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:59.620
 pressing on the contained music would be to use 

00:03:50.650 --> 00:04:03.340
 As for Tokyo, here it is, but it is 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:06.300
 basically this is not difficult in the 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 lots of space on your phone you can 

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:18.580
 use this application to place the 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:20.920
 after installing this video to 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:24.810
