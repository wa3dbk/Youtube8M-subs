 school of thai boxing and today i 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.460
 I will knock out Alexander 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.770
 in this series we will look at basic 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.700
 concepts clinch let's start with the right 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:29.640
 clinch grabs 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:33.200
 he is done surely our hands on 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:37.860
 nape elbows are placed on the chest 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.410
 rival stands right you make a move 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.070
 back sounds engine self properties 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.610
 knee kick 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:46.280
 what are the nuances here are sure many 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.100
 hold neck 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.090
 they nape why is it important to keep 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.590
 upper head 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.960
 they are gentle and because it is winter now 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:57.930
 tense and i started to pull down i 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:00.629
 just physically can not bend it but 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.270
 enough and put your hand over your head 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:05.640
 shove in father's chest put 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.130
 to the roller on top I can already bend it 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.009
 with one hand 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.990
 elementary second important aspect 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:16.590
 fighting in the clinch is correct 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:19.020
 leg position when fighting in clinch on 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.550
 legs need not stand on their toes because 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.810
 that so you are less resistant until 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.880
 it's easy to twist us 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:28.350
 and you need to stand firmly on the ground 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:31.140
 kicked up is also very important to become 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:34.170
 wide if we become an abalone up 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.939
 we also have unstable legs 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.439
 must stand either shoulder width or 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.650
 a little wider then the authorities lived to move with 

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:42.570
 locations when traveling to clinch as well 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.369
 it is very important to be all the time 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 rival in the front that is if 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:49.920
 rival shifts we tried time 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:51.630
 to face him if 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.090
 the moment we leave the leg he managed 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:56.610

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:16.110
 all the time we try to load it 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.799
 order from the opponent as well 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.079

00:02:22.079 --> 00:02:28.110
 when changing clinch grips we stand with 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:29.120
 one hand is on the back of your head 2 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.830

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.050
 out of the clinch 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:22.620

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:24.180
 nato strong I put weight on my feet 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.210
 my back is straight 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.380
 I put my hands on my opponent's face 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:32.040
 on the nose to the jaw 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.420
