00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.520
 and good we are here with wind of 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.980
 spinning 

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:10.690
 like elvis yesterday in the group stage the 

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.690
 skates for our sensation 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:18.380
 at the end of the day because if we wait for the 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.920
 3-1 victory 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.070
 3-0 and in the end almost cost us the 

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.070
 match 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.060
 that saved him 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.420
 the challenge practically expressive as very 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.900
 very well and we were 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.900
 Y 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:44.750
 two 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.120
 in this way and the other modes with a 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.780
 little more alone but we are not happy 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.820
 at the end with the victory of 3 to 1 as 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.820
 the team in no time 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:00.090
 and that's why we left happy 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.440
 we need that victory for our 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.680
 work 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:08.690
 I'm already thinking about cooking 

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.690
 and talking about today 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.230
 as you have seen in the game and 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.979
 especially that last video the comeback 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.360
 epic for the good title we already knew of 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.730
 first that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.100
 semifinal with suit 2 carries 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:30.690
 the final and chopped good steel nerves 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.650
 as always for tranquility 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:36.400
 we started quite like the truth 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.010
 then the 20 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:42.010
 is quite lucky enough that 

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:44.770
 us so 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:50.750
 we had the clearest idea of winning 

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:52.620
 fast lupine machine we start 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:56.790
 a little bit 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:02:02.390
 a little bad because we did not know 

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:04.620
 hold on to take the bad side well and then 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:06.570
 good 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.970
 has rebounded since that last dance 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:14.600
 leaving about five it seemed that everything 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.600
 It was finished but we managed to get there 

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:24.160
 going back to this game of two some 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.670
 in fact 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000
 historical 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:52.920
 the good aggressive ways as they were 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:03:03.420
 communities 

00:02:52.920 --> 00:03:06.459
 and me too and nothing simply 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:08.080
 basically it was between us not 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:10.239
 surrender in that video because how do you 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:14.160
 can and has already been seen in other events 

00:03:10.239 --> 00:03:14.160
 for example I was asked a 30 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:19.470
 Y 

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:21.000
 and simply that is never what 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.300
 we said and in the end we could take it out 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.060
 forward the four points 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:28.120
 and well I'm already in the end of the 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:31.319
 technique 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.700
 that as you see gray hair or end and how 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.170
 development of the party because with that 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:37.450
 without interviews we do not know aviation 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.330
 level the finalist who you think is going to 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:41.220
 to know 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.490
 If I get a little wet but it will go 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.320
 here 

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.810
 yesterday's match before two 

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:47.870
 outside 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:50.560
 with a smile 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:56.700
 the truth was mother repetition 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:04:00.830
 and I think the surprise 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:00.830
 after this anticipated final 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:11.270
 and one to go to the aforementioned 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:13.640
 interview of future plans you have in 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.180
 about tournaments both nationally 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.700
 as international and the good ones as the 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:23.300
 true that spinning has a project of 

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.599
 huge jazz a huge project 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:30.760
 still can not say anything but there 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:33.370
 is there this summer things 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.490
 to change Spanish music 

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.610
 if we say let's go let's give a 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:41.490
 Spanish revolution of hollywood and 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:43.870
 done this calculation is being quite 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.530
 pretty good a community of a 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:47.550
 heap 

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:50.110
 the help teams of level I believe and 

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:51.990
 really the spirit team so much 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.590
 with hello 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.790
 but we are focusing on Spain and 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.260
 It is inside the body I think 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:05.140
 Spaniards could 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:08.400
 europe really showed in america that 

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.400
 we have great level 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:12.250
 so far the colorados 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:16.600
 because they really do not 

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.560
 we can allow and almost always do 

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:22.360
 European events either for money etc 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:25.830
 they have in mind but it has been the moment 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:25.830
 of hitting the table 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.250
 and forward 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.740
 Hi, I already tried to be the activist of 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:36.180
