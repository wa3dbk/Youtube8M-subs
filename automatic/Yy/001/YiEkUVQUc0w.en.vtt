hey<00:00:06.590> folks<00:00:06.800> this<00:00:06.890> is

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:08.240 
hey folks this is

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:14.890 
hey folks this is
check<00:00:08.450> out<00:00:08.599> basketball

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:14.900 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.330 

like<00:00:15.019> this<00:00:15.139> in<00:00:15.379> the<00:00:15.500> arcade<00:00:15.860> it's<00:00:16.129> quite

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:16.340 
like this in the arcade it's quite

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:23.470 
like this in the arcade it's quite
simple<00:00:18.400> just<00:00:19.400> get<00:00:19.580> the<00:00:21.640> bust<00:00:22.640> balls<00:00:22.910> into<00:00:23.450> the

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:23.480 
simple just get the bust balls into the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:28.060 
simple just get the bust balls into the
basket<00:00:25.779> and<00:00:26.779> i<00:00:26.930> think<00:00:27.110> there's<00:00:27.410> about<00:00:27.470> seven

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:28.070 
basket and i think there's about seven

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:32.890 
basket and i think there's about seven
levels<00:00:30.220> so<00:00:31.220> the<00:00:31.699> basket<00:00:32.059> might<00:00:32.239> move<00:00:32.629> back<00:00:32.660> a

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:32.900 
levels so the basket might move back a

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:34.600 
levels so the basket might move back a
bit<00:00:33.019> it<00:00:33.470> might<00:00:33.650> start<00:00:33.860> moving<00:00:34.160> from<00:00:34.309> left<00:00:34.339> to

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
bit it might start moving from left to

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:50.160 
bit it might start moving from left to
right<00:00:46.900> basically<00:00:47.900> just<00:00:47.930> freaking<00:00:48.739> balls

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
right basically just freaking balls

00:00:50.170 --> 00:01:05.830 
right basically just freaking balls
