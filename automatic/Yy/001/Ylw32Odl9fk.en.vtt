 the nih directly influencing their 

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:46.940

 be able to realize their dreams and hopes 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:25.600
 the symbols that appear next to the 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.850
 windows of the apartments indicate the 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.740
 mood of the characters so 

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:32.350

 either feed them with their food 

00:03:55.690 --> 00:04:00.430
 favorite to give them advice to pass times 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.950

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.130
 help them make new friends 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:06.810
 finding many other options 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:08.640
 all this gives rise to relationships of 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:13.100
 friendship of anger or infatuation 

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:13.100
 coming even sharp and the thing goes more 

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:23.580
 the ruling that included the 

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.770
 Japanese version that allowed weddings 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.960
 homosexuals which we thought was a 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:30.290
 big mistake and in turn has raised a lot 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.290
 controversy 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.440
 I feel our 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:38.320
 Y 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:40.300
 and couples can have children 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:42.760
 growing these sooner or later and 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:44.740
 wanting its own space we can 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:46.450
 provide you with your own apartment or 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.640
 send them to travel the world to 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.690
 visit the islands of other players if 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.690
 we activate streetpass 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.060
 when activating it we can also receive 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:04.920
 visits from other players who will camp 

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:07.050
 on our lot, can accommodate up to 

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.380
 10 characters at the same time and interact with 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.720
 the residents of our island also 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:14.730
 allows you to occasionally receive letters or 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.590
 photos of someone who is traveling through 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.080
 the world as well as they go through the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:23.580
 island from time to time hello how are you 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:26.630
 watching the day I hope that phenomenal me 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.630
 I would like to wear new clothes 

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:30.280
 and we can share our best 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.259
 moments in the adventure through 

00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:34.849
 images that will be published on twitter 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.689
 tumblr or facebook 

00:05:34.849 --> 00:05:37.689
 they 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:44.229
 the graphical section is pretty good 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:46.389
 but we would have liked a city 

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:48.099
 better recreated and to be able to visit their 

00:05:46.389 --> 00:05:51.099
 streets instead of having to press 

00:05:48.099 --> 00:05:53.050
 about the place we travel to 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:54.819
 we would have liked to be able to customize 

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:58.500
 the city but as it is for 

00:05:54.819 --> 00:05:58.500
 make a new ip meets 

00:06:03.599 --> 00:06:07.629
 in the sonorous there are simple melodies and 

00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:10.150
 cheerful though where truly 

00:06:07.629 --> 00:06:12.159
 it stands out is in the voice editor that 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.379
 allows us to customize to our liking the 

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:16.330
 characters if they read accurately everything 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.099
 what we write with the possibility of 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.749
 compose the lyrics of songs 

00:06:18.099 --> 00:06:21.749
 interpret them at concerts 

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:32.420
 in conclusion tomodachi life is a game 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.730
 totally different from what is seen in others 

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:36.830
 titles the relationships between 

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:38.750
 characters that we incorporate to 

00:06:36.830 --> 00:06:40.550
 the island usually give very situations 

00:06:38.750 --> 00:06:43.610
 absurd and funny being 

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.260
 completely unpredictable there are many 

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:47.600
 options to customize to the 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.510
 inhabitants but not for the city something 

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:52.400
 that would have given a lot of variety according to 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.350
 the time and day change the events and 

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:58.360
 objects sold in shops which 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.360
 makes its duration almost infinite 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.930
 although the graphic section is very simple 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:04.640
 the nice designs of the thousands their 

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:07.220
 animations make us forget 

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:09.050
 quickly from it the voices in 

00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.820
 Castilian and who can read everything 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.980
 that we write give you a point in favor 

00:07:10.820 --> 00:07:15.940
 to sound all together with the fun and 

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:15.940
 varied melodies 

00:07:16.159 --> 00:07:20.099
 we recommend tomodachi live to all 

00:07:18.539 --> 00:07:22.139
 those players who want to try 

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:24.710
 something new even if it is not to the liking of 

00:07:22.139 --> 00:07:24.710
 all public
