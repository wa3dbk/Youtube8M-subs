00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
here and Siberia see all this cold air

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.750 
here and Siberia see all this cold air
pushing<00:03:03.960> down<00:03:04.170> here<00:03:04.500> towards<00:03:04.710> the<00:03:04.950> south<00:03:05.190> well

with<00:03:05.970> that<00:03:06.210> you're<00:03:06.450> going<00:03:06.570> to<00:03:06.630> be<00:03:06.720> seeing<00:03:06.870> that

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
with that you're going to be seeing that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.540 
with that you're going to be seeing that
increase<00:03:07.230> in<00:03:07.620> vertical<00:03:08.010> wind<00:03:08.130> shear<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.460> if

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
wind shear overlay on it you can see

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:15.680 
wind shear overlay on it you can see
these<00:03:13.650> extremely<00:03:14.310> high<00:03:14.640> numbers<00:03:15.090> pushing<00:03:15.540> in

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
these extremely high numbers pushing in

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.900 
these extremely high numbers pushing in
from<00:03:15.720> the<00:03:16.050> north<00:03:16.290> here<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.620> to<00:03:16.740> 40<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.250> 60<00:03:17.730> knots

tropical<00:03:18.540> systems<00:03:18.930> don't<00:03:19.470> want<00:03:19.710> anything

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
tropical systems don't want anything

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.430 
tropical systems don't want anything
more<00:03:20.340> than<00:03:20.490> 10<00:03:20.760> to<00:03:20.910> 15<00:03:21.420> knots<00:03:21.690> from<00:03:21.930> them<00:03:22.320> to

more than 10 to 15 knots from them to

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.840 
more than 10 to 15 knots from them to
really<00:03:22.620> develop<00:03:22.950> and<00:03:23.250> support<00:03:23.460> the

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:23.850 
really develop and support the

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:25.160 
really develop and support the
development<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.300> that<00:03:24.450> cyclonic<00:03:24.870> circulation

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
development of that cyclonic circulation

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.340 
development of that cyclonic circulation
so<00:03:25.950> really<00:03:26.730> fantastic<00:03:27.510> news<00:03:27.690> for<00:03:27.960> the<00:03:28.020> people

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
so really fantastic news for the people

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.930 
so really fantastic news for the people
down<00:03:28.380> in<00:03:28.530> Cambodia<00:03:29.130> Malaysia<00:03:29.520> and<00:03:29.700> Thailand

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
down in Cambodia Malaysia and Thailand

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.820 
down in Cambodia Malaysia and Thailand
because<00:03:30.240> the<00:03:30.480> system<00:03:30.840> was<00:03:31.290> likely<00:03:31.650> going<00:03:31.770> to

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:31.830 
because the system was likely going to

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:33.560 
because the system was likely going to
push<00:03:32.010> off<00:03:32.190> here<00:03:32.400> towards<00:03:32.730> the<00:03:32.820> south<00:03:33.030> bus<00:03:33.270> but

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
push off here towards the south bus but

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.360 
push off here towards the south bus but
right<00:03:33.840> now<00:03:34.080> it<00:03:34.350> looks<00:03:34.740> like<00:03:34.860> it's<00:03:35.130> going<00:03:35.310> to

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
right now it looks like it's going to

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
right now it looks like it's going to
disperse<00:03:35.940> you<00:03:36.180> may<00:03:36.450> see<00:03:36.510> this<00:03:36.870> broad<00:03:37.200> area

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
disperse you may see this broad area

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.050 
disperse you may see this broad area
convection<00:03:38.130> move<00:03:38.250> down<00:03:38.460> that<00:03:38.640> way<00:03:38.760> but<00:03:38.820> it's

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:39.060 
convection move down that way but it's

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.180 
convection move down that way but it's
not<00:03:39.270> going<00:03:39.570> to<00:03:39.720> be<00:03:39.810> a<00:03:39.840> developed<00:03:40.530> tropical

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
not going to be a developed tropical

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:42.800 
not going to be a developed tropical
storm<00:03:41.400> i<00:03:41.490> do<00:03:41.550> want<00:03:41.880> to<00:03:41.940> strongly<00:03:42.240> note<00:03:42.600> that

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
storm i do want to strongly note that

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.990 
storm i do want to strongly note that
but<00:03:43.320> with<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.590> you<00:03:44.190> still<00:03:44.640> has<00:03:44.820> already

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
but with that you still has already

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.340 
but with that you still has already
noted<00:03:45.480> you're<00:03:45.690> going<00:03:45.810> to<00:03:45.870> be<00:03:45.930> seeing<00:03:46.110> heavy

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
week and that is really still going to

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.980 
week and that is really still going to
start<00:03:50.700> by<00:03:50.880> Monday<00:03:51.360> and<00:03:51.510> out<00:03:51.600> towards

Malaysia and Thailand you're going to

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.280 
Malaysia and Thailand you're going to

eventually starts to recurve down
towards<00:04:16.799> the<00:04:16.890> southwest<00:04:17.130> you're<00:04:17.520> likely

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:17.760 
towards the southwest you're likely

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:19.039 
towards the southwest you're likely
going<00:04:17.970> to<00:04:18.090> get<00:04:18.239> some<00:04:18.390> of<00:04:18.450> these<00:04:18.540> outer<00:04:18.780> rain

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:19.049 
going to get some of these outer rain

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:20.960 
going to get some of these outer rain
bands<00:04:19.290> and<00:04:19.500> also<00:04:20.070> that<00:04:20.220> moisture<00:04:20.640> associated

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970
