 Hello, I'm Lukman 

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:17.619
 This time I will make tips 

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:19.570
 A little about how to change 

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:23.419
 Your Android phone becomes 3G Only 

00:00:23.419 --> 00:00:25.470
 I aimed this tutorial 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.179
 For newbies who have an Android cellphone 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.039
 related 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:35.980
 most new people use Android phones 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.140
 don't know how to change settings 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.420
 This 3G Only, so 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.110
 sometimes they are 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.820
 get an unstable internet connection 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.800
 as we know that 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.580
 in Indonesia has a network 

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.110
 GPRS 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.190
 and 3G, different from in Malaysia 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.830
 some locations there are only 3G networks available, so their connection is stable 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.080
 while we are in Indonesia 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.260
 we need to make the settings 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.230
 become 3G Only, so 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.040
 connection is stable 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.440
 ok, we start from 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.390
 this tablel 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:20.510
 The first step 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.500
 let's go into settings 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.780
 from the application 

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:32.780
 there is "Settings", tap ... then select Network 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:37.310
 Wireless 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.690
 here the writing 

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.890
 "Wireless and Network" 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.760
 then 

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:49.720
 find the "Cellular Network" tap ... 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.960
 select "Network Mode" then 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.840
 select "WCDMA Only" 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.610
 this means 3G Only ... 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.540
 Okay .. that's how to make settings 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.060
 Your Android becomes 3G Only
