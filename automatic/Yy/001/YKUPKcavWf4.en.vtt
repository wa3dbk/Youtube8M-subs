00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 hello and welcome to the studio I am 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.430
 jérôme not the photographers and trainer 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.529
 in photography and today I am 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:10.740
 with deborah model with whom we are going 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:12.360
 see how to pose for a portrait here 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.740
 finally today we are in the studio but 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.269
 it works all that I you 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:18.060
 explain today for the outdoors 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.770
 we will focus on the face so 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.380
 the face and the bust and we will see 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.250
 how to have the look that 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.570
 sparkle and have a relaxed face 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 the first thing to do for a look 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.619
 that sparkles is to try to make 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.230
 so that it does not sparkle everywhere 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.910
 we will avoid having too much jewelry 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.620
 seeing there in this case we have everything 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.180
 removed and the best actually it's 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.649
 to have the least possible the more you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.000
 will have things that sparkle and that 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.270
 will draw the eye to the right or to 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.649
 left 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.260
 - you will see what you really want 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.789
 to show in this case his eyes that 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.539
 this is the first element the second 

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:50.789
 it's makeup 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.590
 there also even logical actually he 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.629
 must smooth the skin effectively he 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.070
 try to raise a little bit 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:58.289
 will also look at it a little bit 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.000
 the face set but it takes 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.579
 especially not that it's too much light anymore 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.379
 it will be seeing - we will see the look of the 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:06.060
 model and suddenly we will miss 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.320
 its subject except of course if you have a 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.479
 special theme if you want 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.110
 really make a photo make-up there you 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.299
 can you let go 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.130
 but on a natural portrait it is worth 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.570
 better stay as nude as possible 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.950
 now we'll see how to do it for 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.250
 to have a sparkling look 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.710
 so the sparkling look is simple 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.450
 it's simply the reflection of the 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.340
 light in the look of the model 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.229
 we will have to make sure that the 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:34.890
 model and in his field of vision and 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.479
 the camera and the light so this 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:40.380
 we have to do is we go first 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.759
 see without light the effect that it gives 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.520
 in actually the look that 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.259
 relatively dull even though deborah has some 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.640
 very clear eyes there is no light 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.869
 in his field of vision which is reflected 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.090
 so suddenly she has her eyes a little 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.340
 little extinguished and now we are going to approach 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.470
 the light and we will light it and we will 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.850
 see that from the moment deborah 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.990
 will have in his field of vision and the 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.439
 light the camera everything is going 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.180
 illuminate 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:03.659
 so I start by approaching a small 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:05.189
 little light and I turned it on and there we 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:07.229
 sees that the first looks to light up 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:09.239
 it's not magic it's just 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.459
 makes a question of organizing the 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.459
 then light outside will require 

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.720
 make sure that you can 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.580
 to position your model is not the 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.680
 studio that will move is you who 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.900
 will move the model so as to 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.250
 steer so that in his field of 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.739
 vision she can have the source 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.349
 main light I'm going because you're 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.760
 a little bit of lighting so we 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:31.830
 can see now the second point 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:34.290
 the second point is how to do in 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.590
 kind of have a relaxed face on a 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.620
 picture 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.060
 it's very simple there too we tend 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:40.140
 to close a little bit when one is 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:41.310
 in front of a camera because we 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.080
 do not know what to do a little bit 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.730
 on the defensive and in fact 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:45.989
 on the contrary, we must avoid pinching 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.599
 the lips it is necessary to avoid tightening the 

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:49.230
 teeth it is necessary to release the jaw have 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:51.300
 loosened teeth 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:53.190
 already that will allow to release a 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.569
 little bit the face the face is going 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.750
 to lie down it will become a lot more 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.920
 sweet we're going to release the lips that's it 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.269
 works well for girls for 

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.459
 guys are a little bit less boys 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:03.750
 do less naturally but look 

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.430
 the magazines flip through the you go 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.510
 see girls tend to relax 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.400
 the jaw and leave the jaw 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.230
 lower lip slightly drooping 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.840
 and again it's going to be lengthened again 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:16.030
 the face again the m make him 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.430
 much sweeter and we will have some 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:19.900
 something much simpler after that 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.489
 still you have the right to smile there 

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:22.659
 do not force yourself but if 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.239
 you have a mouse naturally like 

00:03:22.659 --> 00:03:26.739
 knows to listen to the edges 

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.150
 these wonderful there is nothing else to 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.769
 only to let you go 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.480
 relax and smile if you have any 

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:33.400
 desire 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.560
 I hope this video will have you 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.140
 helped to be a little bit more a little 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.400
 little more comfortable with the goal 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.989
 I find you every Wednesday 

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.690
 for a new course a new video 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.590
 on my website www.info put back to shoot 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:46.599
 net point photographer 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.810
 in the meantime I say goodbye and
