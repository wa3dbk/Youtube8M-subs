00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
this is marina raccoon it makes no sense

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.720 
this is marina raccoon it makes no sense
for<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.710> to<00:00:40.829> be<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:40.950> new<00:00:41.070> character<00:00:41.399> in<00:00:41.520> my

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
book now again nothing has been

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.080 
book now again nothing has been
confirmed<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.860> I<00:00:44.129> understand<00:00:44.670> that<00:00:44.730> this<00:00:44.969> is

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
confirmed and I understand that this is

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.340 
confirmed and I understand that this is
just<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.360> character<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.930> shouldn't<00:00:46.170> really

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
just a character you shouldn't really

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.900 
just a character you shouldn't really
get<00:00:46.469> it<00:00:46.559> said<00:00:46.920> over<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.280> we<00:00:47.460> haven't<00:00:47.670> seen<00:00:47.820> this

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
get it said over it we haven't seen this

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.790 
get it said over it we haven't seen this
character's<00:00:48.329> personality<00:00:48.600> or<00:00:49.140> anything<00:00:49.410> so

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
character's personality or anything so

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.439 
character's personality or anything so
we<00:00:49.920> can't<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.340> judge<00:00:50.579> on<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.789> but<00:00:51.329> it

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
we can't really judge on that but it

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.060 
we can't really judge on that but it
makes<00:00:51.660> no<00:00:51.750> sense<00:00:51.870> that<00:00:52.350> this<00:00:52.530> isn't<00:00:52.710> marine

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
makes no sense that this isn't marine

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.400 
makes no sense that this isn't marine
looking<00:00:53.550> at<00:00:53.640> both<00:00:53.820> designs<00:00:54.329> they're<00:00:54.870> pretty

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
looking at both designs they're pretty

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.650 
looking at both designs they're pretty
similar<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:56.129> fact<00:00:56.520> if<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:56.850> had<00:00:57.059> never<00:00:57.300> seen

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
similar in fact if we had never seen

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.220 
similar in fact if we had never seen
this<00:00:57.840> picture

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this picture

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.650 
this picture
I'd<00:00:58.379> probably<00:00:58.910> reimagine<00:00:59.910> marine<00:01:00.270> looking

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
I'd probably reimagine marine looking

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.660 
I'd probably reimagine marine looking
just<00:01:00.989> like<00:01:01.230> this<00:01:01.289> in<00:01:01.710> sonic<00:01:02.070> boom<00:01:02.250> when<00:01:02.640> I

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
just like this in sonic boom when I

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.460 
just like this in sonic boom when I
first<00:01:03.000> saw<00:01:03.149> this<00:01:03.329> picture<00:01:03.539> of<00:01:03.930> course<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
first saw this picture of course I

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.289 
first saw this picture of course I
thought<00:01:04.650> it<00:01:04.769> was<00:01:04.860> marine<00:01:05.220> it<00:01:05.430> looks<00:01:05.670> exactly

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
thought it was marine it looks exactly

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.179 
thought it was marine it looks exactly
how<00:01:06.390> I<00:01:06.420> would<00:01:06.900> imagine<00:01:07.140> marine<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.830> raccoon

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
how I would imagine marine the raccoon

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:09.289 
how I would imagine marine the raccoon
and<00:01:08.490> sonic<00:01:08.820> boom

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
and sonic boom

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
and sonic boom
I<00:01:09.330> thought<00:01:09.600> Sega<00:01:10.020> had<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.170> really<00:01:10.619> good<00:01:10.799> thing

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
I thought Sega had a really good thing

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.679 
I thought Sega had a really good thing
going<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.340> them<00:01:11.640> take<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.030> character<00:01:12.420> that

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
going with them take a character that

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.810 
going with them take a character that
had<00:01:12.869> one<00:01:13.170> minor<00:01:13.500> role<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:14.040> didn't<00:01:14.400> affect

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
had one minor role that didn't affect

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.510 
had one minor role that didn't affect
anything<00:01:15.570> in<00:01:15.750> the<00:01:16.080> series<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.860> introduce<00:01:17.369> her

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
anything in the series not introduce her

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.370 
anything in the series not introduce her
in<00:01:17.640> anything<00:01:18.030> and<00:01:18.450> bring<00:01:18.810> her<00:01:18.930> back<00:01:18.960> as<00:01:19.350> a

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
in anything and bring her back as a

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
in anything and bring her back as a
recurring<00:01:19.740> character<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.580> new<00:01:20.729> series

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
recurring character in the new series

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.850 
recurring character in the new series
that<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.780> perfect<00:01:22.259> because<00:01:22.500> I've<00:01:22.650> always

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
that was perfect because I've always

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.530 
that was perfect because I've always
liked<00:01:23.220> the<00:01:23.369> concept<00:01:23.759> of<00:01:23.939> marine<00:01:24.299> she's<00:01:24.509> a

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
liked the concept of marine she's a

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.240 
liked the concept of marine she's a
young<00:01:24.869> girl<00:01:24.900> who<00:01:25.259> likes<00:01:25.500> to<00:01:25.680> experience

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
young girl who likes to experience

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:27.980 
young girl who likes to experience
things<00:01:26.520> she<00:01:26.700> likes<00:01:26.880> to<00:01:27.060> travel<00:01:27.240> even<00:01:27.869> though

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
things she likes to travel even though

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.350 
things she likes to travel even though
she's<00:01:28.229> naive<00:01:28.470> at<00:01:28.799> times<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.369> would<00:01:29.909> have<00:01:29.939> loved

my<00:01:38.520> thoughts<00:01:38.820> on<00:01:39.030> this<00:01:39.150> character<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:39.900> I

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
my thoughts on this character because I

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.990 
my thoughts on this character because I
just<00:01:40.530> knew<00:01:40.770> it<00:01:40.950> was<00:01:41.100> marine<00:01:41.430> it<00:01:41.610> looked<00:01:41.820> too

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
just knew it was marine it looked too

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.179 
just knew it was marine it looked too
much<00:01:42.030> like<00:01:42.240> her<00:01:42.630> for<00:01:43.140> not<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.500> be<00:01:43.530> here<00:01:43.950> but<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
much like her for not to be here but the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
much like her for not to be here but the
fact<00:01:44.399> that<00:01:44.520> this<00:01:44.700> might<00:01:45.270> not<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.750> her<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.200> just

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
fact that this might not be her is just

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.319 
fact that this might not be her is just
weird<00:01:46.860> to<00:01:47.130> me<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> I<00:01:47.790> have<00:01:47.939> to<00:01:47.970> question

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
weird to me and I have to question

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.120 
weird to me and I have to question
whoever<00:01:48.720> designed<00:01:49.290> her<00:01:49.409> because<00:01:49.740> I<00:01:49.829> felt<00:01:50.070> like

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
whoever designed her because I felt like

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.069 
whoever designed her because I felt like
they<00:01:50.340> looked<00:01:50.640> at<00:01:50.790> Marines<00:01:51.119> design<00:01:51.540> and<00:01:51.810> tried

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
they looked at Marines design and tried

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.719 
they looked at Marines design and tried
to<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> character<00:01:52.890> that<00:01:53.070> resembled<00:01:53.610> her

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
to make a character that resembled her

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.850 
to make a character that resembled her
there's<00:01:54.030> no<00:01:54.420> doubt<00:01:54.630> there<00:01:55.170> is<00:01:55.320> no<00:01:55.500> doubt<00:01:55.710> in<00:01:55.829> my

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
there's no doubt there is no doubt in my

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
there's no doubt there is no doubt in my
mind<00:01:55.950> that<00:01:56.280> they<00:01:56.520> looked<00:01:56.790> at<00:01:56.909> marine<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.509> get

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
mind that they looked at marine to get

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.209 
mind that they looked at marine to get
the<00:01:57.750> design<00:01:58.079> for<00:01:58.320> this<00:01:58.439> I<00:01:58.619> just<00:01:58.680> can't<00:01:59.040> believe

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the design for this I just can't believe

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.740 
the design for this I just can't believe
that<00:01:59.399> anyone<00:01:59.969> would<00:02:00.119> think<00:02:00.180> this<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.600> a

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
that anyone would think this is a

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.780 
that anyone would think this is a
coincidence<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.590> just<00:02:01.860> makes<00:02:02.159> no<00:02:02.250> sense<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.759> me

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
coincidence it just makes no sense to me

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:04.550 
coincidence it just makes no sense to me
and<00:02:03.030> if<00:02:03.180> you're<00:02:03.360> going<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.990> that<00:02:04.229> why<00:02:04.530> not

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and if you're going to do that why not

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.649 
and if you're going to do that why not
just<00:02:04.979> make<00:02:05.189> her<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.490> character<00:02:05.969> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.240> the

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
just make her the character you have the

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.109 
just make her the character you have the
name<00:02:06.899> why<00:02:07.229> not<00:02:07.469> just<00:02:07.740> use<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.340> you<00:02:08.640> know<00:02:08.819> this

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
name why not just use it you know this

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:10.999 
name why not just use it you know this
isn't<00:02:09.420> going<00:02:09.599> to<00:02:09.690> offend<00:02:09.929> anyone<00:02:10.319> really<00:02:10.770> this

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
isn't going to offend anyone really this

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:12.920 
isn't going to offend anyone really this
this<00:02:11.069> doesn't<00:02:11.730> really<00:02:11.819> even<00:02:11.970> offend<00:02:12.450> me<00:02:12.660> it's

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
this doesn't really even offend me it's

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.790 
this doesn't really even offend me it's
just<00:02:13.140> an<00:02:13.349> irritant

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
just an irritant

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.900 
just an irritant
to<00:02:13.890> me<00:02:14.010> that<00:02:14.190> this<00:02:14.370> could<00:02:14.640> have<00:02:14.730> been<00:02:14.880> a

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:14.910 
to me that this could have been a

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.000 
to me that this could have been a
promising<00:02:15.630> idea<00:02:15.930> and<00:02:16.170> it<00:02:16.290> just<00:02:16.320> leaves<00:02:16.710> a<00:02:16.860> bad

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
promising idea and it just leaves a bad

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.710 
promising idea and it just leaves a bad
taste<00:02:17.040> in<00:02:17.460> my<00:02:17.520> mouth<00:02:17.610> because<00:02:18.030> not<00:02:18.300> only<00:02:18.330> does

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
taste in my mouth because not only does

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.360 
taste in my mouth because not only does
does<00:02:18.900> not<00:02:19.080> make<00:02:19.260> sense<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> me<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:20.040> also

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
does not make sense to me it also

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.250 
does not make sense to me it also
degrades<00:02:20.880> the<00:02:21.120> quality<00:02:21.150> of<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:21.930> new

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
degrades the quality of this new

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.470 
degrades the quality of this new
character<00:02:22.530> when<00:02:23.130> a<00:02:23.160> new<00:02:23.400> character<00:02:23.760> looks<00:02:24.300> so

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
character when a new character looks so

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:26.450 
character when a new character looks so
really<00:02:24.870> similar<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.320> a<00:02:25.530> character<00:02:25.950> that<00:02:26.310> was

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:26.460 
really similar to a character that was

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:27.920 
really similar to a character that was
already<00:02:26.880> introduced<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.600> you've<00:02:27.720> done

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
already introduced and you've done

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.300 
already introduced and you've done
little<00:02:28.200> to<00:02:28.410> change<00:02:28.650> that<00:02:28.920> character

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
little to change that character

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.830 
little to change that character
aesthetically<00:02:29.880> that<00:02:30.150> makes<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.660> new

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
aesthetically that makes that new

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:32.960 
aesthetically that makes that new
character<00:02:31.290> just<00:02:31.530> look<00:02:31.740> bad<00:02:31.980> design<00:02:32.700> wise

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:32.970 
character just look bad design wise

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.430 
character just look bad design wise
again<00:02:33.360> we<00:02:33.540> know<00:02:33.690> nothing<00:02:34.080> about<00:02:34.200> this

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
again we know nothing about this

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.500 
again we know nothing about this
character<00:02:34.770> but<00:02:35.280> I<00:02:35.370> always<00:02:35.550> use<00:02:35.670> Eggman<00:02:36.240> naega

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
character but I always use Eggman naega

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.750 
character but I always use Eggman naega
as<00:02:36.720> an<00:02:36.840> example<00:02:37.170> terrible<00:02:37.950> design<00:02:38.280> probably

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
as an example terrible design probably

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.520 
as an example terrible design probably
the<00:02:38.880> worst<00:02:39.090> design<00:02:39.450> in<00:02:39.630> all<00:02:39.780> of<00:02:39.930> Sonic<00:02:40.290> and

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
the worst design in all of Sonic and

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.200 
the worst design in all of Sonic and
when<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.710> look<00:02:40.950> at<00:02:41.100> this<00:02:41.250> marine<00:02:41.820> looking

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
when I look at this marine looking

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:43.970 
when I look at this marine looking
character<00:02:42.600> I<00:02:42.780> think<00:02:43.230> it<00:02:43.350> looks<00:02:43.500> really<00:02:43.680> cool

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
character I think it looks really cool

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980 
character I think it looks really cool
she<00:02:44.310> fits<00:02:44.640> with<00:02:44.850> sonic<00:02:45.150> boom<00:02:45.360> and<00:02:45.690> really

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
she fits with sonic boom and really

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.720 
she fits with sonic boom and really
that's<00:02:46.110> all<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:46.740> should<00:02:46.950> matter<00:02:47.010> but<00:02:47.640> the

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
that's all that should matter but the

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.340 
that's all that should matter but the
fact<00:02:47.760> that<00:02:48.000> she<00:02:48.210> looks<00:02:48.390> so<00:02:48.600> close<00:02:48.840> to<00:02:49.050> marine

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 
fact that she looks so close to marine

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.290 
fact that she looks so close to marine
the<00:02:49.470> raccoon<00:02:49.860> that<00:02:50.310> puts<00:02:50.640> her<00:02:50.790> load<00:02:51.000> that's

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
the raccoon that puts her load that's

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.510 
the raccoon that puts her load that's
just<00:02:51.570> in<00:02:51.750> my<00:02:52.050> book<00:02:52.260> that<00:02:52.440> just<00:02:52.920> puts<00:02:53.190> her<00:02:53.310> load

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
just in my book that just puts her load
