he was praying last year Theo I said to
him<00:01:58.479> the<00:01:58.900> prayer<00:01:59.350> he<00:01:59.799> is<00:01:59.979> doing<00:02:00.430> is<00:02:00.700> making<00:02:01.030> a

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:01.509 
him the prayer he is doing is making a

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:11.850 
him the prayer he is doing is making a
difference<00:02:01.810> to<00:02:02.560> our<00:02:02.799> school

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:11.860 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.430 

and<00:02:12.160> the<00:02:13.030> difference<00:02:13.360> they<00:02:13.600> are<00:02:13.630> making<00:02:14.230> at

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
and the difference they are making at

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:17.480 
and the difference they are making at
Kalia<00:02:14.970> secondary<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.210> on<00:02:16.480> a<00:02:16.510> spiritual<00:02:17.200> level

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
Kalia secondary is on a spiritual level

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.860 
Kalia secondary is on a spiritual level
because<00:02:18.490> everything<00:02:18.880> else<00:02:19.030> has<00:02:19.330> been<00:02:19.570> tried

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
because everything else has been tried

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.130 
because everything else has been tried
and<00:02:20.530> but<00:02:21.400> if<00:02:21.610> people<00:02:21.850> are<00:02:22.240> not<00:02:22.450> willing<00:02:22.870> to

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
and but if people are not willing to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.860 
and but if people are not willing to
change<00:02:23.470> inside<00:02:24.240> then<00:02:25.240> nothing<00:02:25.660> will<00:02:25.810> change

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
change inside then nothing will change

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:28.740 
change inside then nothing will change
and<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.650> think<00:02:26.890> that<00:02:27.100> is<00:02:27.310> part<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.120> the<00:02:28.300> success

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
and I think that is part of the success

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.650 
and I think that is part of the success
and<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.110> tremendous<00:02:29.620> increase<00:02:30.220> in<00:02:31.090> the<00:02:31.390> past

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660 
and the tremendous increase in the past

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.600 
and the tremendous increase in the past
right<00:02:31.960> of<00:02:32.200> that<00:02:32.440> school<00:02:32.800> which<00:02:33.340> was<00:02:33.550> a

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
right of that school which was a

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:48.050 
right of that school which was a
dysfunctional<00:02:34.360> school<00:02:34.660> for<00:02:34.870> 15<00:02:35.290> years

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.089
