00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
your system partition so before I used

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.830 
your system partition so before I used
to<00:00:41.129> only<00:00:41.280> have<00:00:41.579> about<00:00:42.469> 98<00:00:43.469> megs<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:44.070> space<00:00:44.430> free

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
to only have about 98 megs of space free

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.290 
to only have about 98 megs of space free
but<00:00:45.840> now<00:00:45.989> with<00:00:46.230> him<00:00:46.440> there<00:00:46.710> 1.5<00:00:47.129> as<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.120> right

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
that's a huge difference from a handler

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.950 
that's a huge difference from a handler
one<00:00:54.570> point<00:00:54.780> forward<00:00:55.110> a<00:00:55.170> hand<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.469> 1.5<00:00:56.039> in<00:00:56.399> space

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:56.960 
one point forward a hand on 1.5 in space

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.369 
one point forward a hand on 1.5 in space
not<00:00:57.960> sure<00:00:58.079> how<00:00:58.320> we<00:00:58.379> did<00:00:58.649> that<00:00:58.800> but<00:00:59.489> it's<00:00:59.699> great

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:00.379 
not sure how we did that but it's great

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.579 
not sure how we did that but it's great

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:56.690 
you click it you just get a force close
so<00:01:53.369> i'm<00:01:53.640> not<00:01:53.820> sure<00:01:53.880> why<00:01:54.720> that's<00:01:54.960> there<00:01:55.320> or<00:01:55.799> what

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
so i'm not sure why that's there or what

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.450 
so i'm not sure why that's there or what
causing<00:01:57.299> a<00:01:57.390> problem<00:01:57.770> but<00:01:58.770> that's<00:01:59.310> something

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
causing a problem but that's something

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.830 
causing a problem but that's something
probably<00:01:59.790> could<00:01:59.969> be<00:02:00.060> fixed<00:02:00.360> with<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.600> small

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
probably could be fixed with the small

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.700 
probably could be fixed with the small
update<00:02:02.420> next<00:02:03.420> thing<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> that<00:02:04.140> in<00:02:04.290> this<00:02:04.409> rom

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
update next thing is that in this rom

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.789 
update next thing is that in this rom
handler<00:02:05.610> added<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.270> terminal<00:02:06.869> emulator<00:02:07.500> app

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
handler added the terminal emulator app

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.339 
handler added the terminal emulator app
so<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.300> have<00:02:09.360> to<00:02:09.509> install<00:02:09.780> it<00:02:09.989> from<00:02:10.200> the

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
so you don't have to install it from the

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.190 
so you don't have to install it from the
market<00:02:10.530> anymore<00:02:10.920> if<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.340> use<00:02:11.459> turbulent

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
market anymore if you use turbulent

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.160 
market anymore if you use turbulent
terminal<00:02:12.560> emulator<00:02:13.300> you<00:02:14.300> could<00:02:14.480> just<00:02:14.720> open<00:02:14.930> it

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
terminal emulator you could just open it

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.050 
terminal emulator you could just open it
up<00:02:15.319> because<00:02:15.470> it's<00:02:15.709> included<00:02:16.040> in<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.519> wrong

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.210 

next<00:02:20.060> thing<00:02:20.269> is<00:02:20.480> that<00:02:20.900> the<00:02:21.200> camera<00:02:21.680> is<00:02:21.709> fixed

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
next thing is that the camera is fixed

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.640 
next thing is that the camera is fixed
