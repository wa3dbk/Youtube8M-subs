00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
they are later configured and modify to

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:35.210 
they are later configured and modify to
look<00:01:30.840> like<00:01:30.990> this<00:01:31.200> okay<00:01:32.210> this<00:01:33.210> rifle<00:01:33.509> is<00:01:34.220> made

look like this okay this rifle is made

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.749 
look like this okay this rifle is made
from<00:01:35.520> a<00:01:35.729> Bulgarian<00:01:36.720> surplus<00:01:37.409> parts<00:01:37.829> kit<00:01:38.100> from

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
from a Bulgarian surplus parts kit from

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.179 
from a Bulgarian surplus parts kit from
a<00:01:38.880> real<00:01:39.180> AK<00:01:39.659> 74<00:01:40.460> so<00:01:41.460> in<00:01:42.320> my<00:01:43.320> opinion<00:01:43.530> I<00:01:44.159> think

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
a real AK 74 so in my opinion I think

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:45.859 
a real AK 74 so in my opinion I think
this<00:01:44.430> would<00:01:44.610> be<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:44.820> better<00:01:44.939> gun<00:01:45.240> because<00:01:45.630> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
this would be the better gun because the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.789 
this would be the better gun because the
parts<00:01:46.259> are<00:01:46.439> made<00:01:46.649> from<00:01:47.369> a<00:01:47.549> legit<00:01:48.060> AK<00:01:48.600> 74<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.470> a
