00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
one of the things I always like when I

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.360 
one of the things I always like when I
go<00:00:06.090> to<00:00:06.149> different<00:00:06.750> model<00:00:07.230> railroads<00:00:07.770> is<00:00:08.069> that

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:08.370 
go to different model railroads is that

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.220 
go to different model railroads is that
we<00:00:08.700> have<00:00:08.790> these<00:00:08.940> little<00:00:09.090> modelers<00:00:09.660> tips<00:00:09.990> and

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
we have these little modelers tips and

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.260 
we have these little modelers tips and
ideas<00:00:10.379> and<00:00:11.010> Roberts<00:00:11.850> got<00:00:12.030> a<00:00:12.059> really

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:12.270 
ideas and Roberts got a really

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:13.789 
ideas and Roberts got a really
interesting<00:00:12.869> one<00:00:13.020> here<00:00:13.049> he's<00:00:13.379> going<00:00:13.530> to<00:00:13.619> talk

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
interesting one here he's going to talk

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.820 
interesting one here he's going to talk
about<00:00:13.949> today<00:00:14.480> well<00:00:15.480> on<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.379> railroad<00:00:16.710> I

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
about today well on the railroad I

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:19.450 
about today well on the railroad I
wanted<00:00:17.130> to<00:00:17.220> use<00:00:17.369> manual<00:00:18.090> turnout<00:00:18.660> controls

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
wanted to use manual turnout controls

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:22.430 
wanted to use manual turnout controls
but<00:00:20.460> I<00:00:20.490> didn't<00:00:20.790> want<00:00:20.940> to<00:00:21.060> be<00:00:21.240> having<00:00:21.990> my<00:00:22.110> hands

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:22.440 
but I didn't want to be having my hands

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.870 
but I didn't want to be having my hands
up<00:00:22.530> on<00:00:22.620> the<00:00:22.680> bench<00:00:22.890> or<00:00:23.100> too<00:00:23.250> much<00:00:23.430> I'm<00:00:23.670> going<00:00:23.820> to

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
up on the bench or too much I'm going to

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.770 
up on the bench or too much I'm going to
use<00:00:24.030> these<00:00:24.270> Blue<00:00:24.540> Point<00:00:24.810> turnout<00:00:25.620> controllers

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:26.780 
use these Blue Point turnout controllers

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.660 
use these Blue Point turnout controllers
to<00:00:27.780> operate<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.160> switches<00:00:29.400> on<00:00:29.640> the

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
to operate all the switches on the

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.790 
to operate all the switches on the
railroad<00:00:30.119> and<00:00:30.300> that<00:00:31.110> will<00:00:31.289> allow<00:00:31.560> me<00:00:31.770> to

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
railroad and that will allow me to

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.180 
railroad and that will allow me to
control<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.930> power<00:00:33.930> polarity<00:00:34.649> that's<00:00:34.920> going

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
control the power polarity that's going

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.470 
control the power polarity that's going
to<00:00:35.340> the<00:00:35.489> switch<00:00:36.000> frogs<00:00:36.650> and<00:00:37.910> I'm<00:00:38.910> using<00:00:39.180> these

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
to the switch frogs and I'm using these

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.290 
to the switch frogs and I'm using these
do<00:00:39.960> Perl<00:00:40.200> Quick<00:00:40.500> Links<00:00:40.710> with<00:00:41.220> the<00:00:41.489> threaded

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
do Perl Quick Links with the threaded

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.020 
do Perl Quick Links with the threaded
end<00:00:42.390> on<00:00:42.630> them<00:00:43.100> to<00:00:44.100> connect<00:00:44.430> to<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> blue<00:00:44.730> point

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.220 
end on them to connect to the blue point
control<00:00:45.329> so<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.690> they'll<00:00:45.780> fit<00:00:45.989> underneath

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
control so and they'll fit underneath

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.990 
control so and they'll fit underneath
the<00:00:46.380> railway<00:00:46.829> with<00:00:47.220> the<00:00:47.340> rod<00:00:47.520> coming<00:00:47.790> out

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the railway with the rod coming out

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.400 
the railway with the rod coming out
through<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.450> fascia<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.020> bench<00:00:49.200> work

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
through the fascia and the bench work

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.520 
through the fascia and the bench work
and<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.390> just<00:00:51.780> a<00:00:51.930> mock-up<00:00:52.230> of<00:00:52.470> the

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
and so this is the just a mock-up of the

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.740 
and so this is the just a mock-up of the
fascia<00:00:52.860> with<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.149> control<00:00:54.510> rod

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
fascia with the with the control rod

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.470 
fascia with the with the control rod
going<00:00:55.020> back<00:00:55.290> and<00:00:55.559> I've<00:00:56.460> installed<00:00:57.239> these

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
going back and I've installed these

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.920 
going back and I've installed these
little<00:00:57.780> knobs<00:00:58.350> that<00:00:58.620> I<00:00:58.680> get<00:00:58.890> from<00:00:59.899> Lee<00:01:00.899> Valley

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
little knobs that I get from Lee Valley

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.999 
little knobs that I get from Lee Valley
on<00:01:01.469> them<00:01:01.710> now<00:01:02.129> they<00:01:02.280> are<00:01:02.550> threaded<00:01:03.120> for<00:01:03.450> a<00:01:04.009> much

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
on them now they are threaded for a much

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.190 
on them now they are threaded for a much
larger<00:01:05.579> size<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.850> bolt<00:01:06.270> so<00:01:06.479> I<00:01:06.509> use<00:01:06.780> a<00:01:06.810> piece<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
larger size a bolt so I use a piece of

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.539 
larger size a bolt so I use a piece of
wire<00:01:08.069> insulation<00:01:09.020> as<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.530> fill<00:01:10.740> between<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
wire insulation as the fill between the

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:15.349 
wire insulation as the fill between the
small<00:01:12.179> push<00:01:12.450> rod<00:01:12.719> and<00:01:13.219> the<00:01:14.219> knob<00:01:14.369> itself<00:01:14.789> and

00:01:15.349 --> 00:01:15.359 
small push rod and the knob itself and

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:20.120 
small push rod and the knob itself and
I'm<00:01:15.509> using<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:17.209> pop<00:01:18.209> rivet<00:01:18.560> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.679> the<00:01:19.859> sleeve

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
I'm using a pop rivet to be the sleeve

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.999 
I'm using a pop rivet to be the sleeve
to<00:01:20.549> go<00:01:20.700> through<00:01:21.090> the<00:01:22.609> 1/8<00:01:24.590> masonite<00:01:25.590> sheathing

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
to go through the 1/8 masonite sheathing

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.889 
to go through the 1/8 masonite sheathing
so<00:01:26.759> one<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:26.939> the<00:01:27.060> things<00:01:27.179> I<00:01:27.270> wanted<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.600> do<00:01:27.749> with

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:27.899 
so one of the things I wanted to do with

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:29.690 
so one of the things I wanted to do with
the<00:01:28.079> manual<00:01:28.590> turnout<00:01:28.920> controls<00:01:29.279> was<00:01:29.490> to<00:01:29.609> be

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
the manual turnout controls was to be

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.510 
the manual turnout controls was to be
able<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.909> keep<00:01:30.060> the<00:01:30.270> knobs<00:01:30.799> in<00:01:31.799> a<00:01:32.009> position

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
able to keep the knobs in a position

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.359 
able to keep the knobs in a position
that<00:01:33.270> would<00:01:33.479> allow<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:34.069> turnout<00:01:35.069> to<00:01:35.219> be<00:01:35.310> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
that would allow the turnout to be in

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.339 
that would allow the turnout to be in
its<00:01:35.549> normal<00:01:35.819> position<00:01:36.090> all<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.479> time<00:01:36.599> so<00:01:37.319> I

00:01:37.339 --> 00:01:37.349 
its normal position all the time so I

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.649 
its normal position all the time so I
decided<00:01:37.529> to<00:01:38.039> use<00:01:38.130> these<00:01:38.459> small<00:01:38.759> locks<00:01:39.090> to<00:01:39.450> hold

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
decided to use these small locks to hold

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.349 
decided to use these small locks to hold
the<00:01:39.779> turnouts<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.529> to<00:01:41.429> hold<00:01:41.639> the<00:01:41.819> knobs<00:01:41.999> in<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.349 --> 00:01:42.359 
the turnouts in to hold the knobs in the

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:44.179 
the turnouts in to hold the knobs in the
fixed<00:01:42.630> position<00:01:42.749> so<00:01:43.170> that<00:01:43.200> they<00:01:43.469> couldn't<00:01:44.099> be

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
fixed position so that they couldn't be

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.519 
fixed position so that they couldn't be
pushed<00:01:44.429> in<00:01:44.639> and<00:01:44.819> that<00:01:45.689> will<00:01:45.840> mean<00:01:46.259> that<00:01:46.289> the

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:46.529 
pushed in and that will mean that the

00:01:46.529 --> 00:01:47.989 
pushed in and that will mean that the
turnout<00:01:46.919> when<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.219> turnouts<00:01:47.549> out<00:01:47.729> like<00:01:47.880> that

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:47.999 
turnout when the turnouts out like that

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:49.489 
turnout when the turnouts out like that
with<00:01:48.179> a<00:01:48.209> lock<00:01:48.450> in<00:01:48.659> is<00:01:48.810> in<00:01:48.929> the<00:01:49.020> normal<00:01:49.380> position

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
with a lock in is in the normal position

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.139 
with a lock in is in the normal position
so<00:01:49.889> if<00:01:49.979> you're<00:01:50.099> going<00:01:50.310> down<00:01:50.459> to<00:01:50.639> fishing<00:01:50.999> you

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
so if you're going down to fishing you

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.609 
so if you're going down to fishing you
see<00:01:51.329> that<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.599> locks<00:01:51.840> in<00:01:52.049> place<00:01:52.139> you<00:01:52.349> know<00:01:52.469> the

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
see that the locks in place you know the

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.429 
see that the locks in place you know the
turn<00:01:52.829> turnout<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.249> normal<00:01:53.840> if<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.049> lock<00:01:55.229> has

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
turn turnout is normal if the lock has

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.919 
turn turnout is normal if the lock has
been<00:01:55.619> removed<00:01:56.240> then<00:01:57.240> the<00:01:57.270> turnout<00:01:57.630> can<00:01:57.810> be
