me um only thing that I can complain
about<00:01:59.579> I<00:01:59.969> guess<00:02:00.240> would<00:02:00.479> be<00:02:00.570> battery<00:02:01.049> life<00:02:01.290> but

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
about I guess would be battery life but

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.130 
about I guess would be battery life but
you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.950> I<00:02:02.250> when<00:02:02.880> I<00:02:02.909> got<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.210> camera<00:02:03.600> I<00:02:03.780> just

charging for the first time today really

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:09.280 
and I guess it's not that bad but I've

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.100 
and I guess it's not that bad but I've
been<00:02:09.520> taking<00:02:09.819> videos<00:02:10.209> taken<00:02:10.750> a<00:02:10.869> lot<00:02:11.050> of

been taking videos taken a lot of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.260 
been taking videos taken a lot of

pictures and stuff and trying out
everything<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:13.780> maybe<00:02:14.020> that's<00:02:14.170> why<00:02:14.319> the

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
everything so maybe that's why the

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.720 
everything so maybe that's why the
better<00:02:14.620> life<00:02:14.800> when<00:02:14.950> they're<00:02:15.069> so<00:02:15.250> good<00:02:15.459> but<00:02:15.700> I
