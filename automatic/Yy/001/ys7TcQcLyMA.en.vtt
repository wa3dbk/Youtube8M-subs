00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.170
 and 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.780
 and 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.890
 and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.620
 yes 

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:35.480
 we read what you always write and I think 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:38.940
 that there were new articles especially 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.290
 maybe because it was published in more places what 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:44.650
 we saw in more places and it did not arrive more 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:48.550
 what were you talking about 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.860
 of many things many topics that 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.350
 coming from you they stop being clichÃ©s and you 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:57.520
 they gave at least from my point of view 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.540
 in the sense that they have to give it what 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.110
 that they have always taught us since 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.610
 little ones 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:04.900
 the phrase of no minutes of garbage 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:05.970
 or while life and hope come from 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.550
 you 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:11.600
 they charged a totally different meaning 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:15.200
 very very real 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:17.150
 it came to me it came to me a lot because they are 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.740
 topics when they are said as topics 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.049
 when they are said from a reality 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.899
 like yours are incredible and if you 

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:30.610
 you know how to read is amazing of the message 

00:01:25.899 --> 00:01:34.350
 so thanks for that article to you 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.350
 what makes you feel proud 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.210
 i 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:46.130
 because when you think something like 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.600
 it has happened to me the most reassuring is 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.600
 I take you feeling good with you 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.979
 same and that has happened to me so 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.390
 proud to have been doing the 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:55.009
 things according to what I wanted to do or 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.049
 understood even if that was not very 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:58.430
 understood by many people I have come to 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.990
 this point I am very proud of 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:04.119
 feel so loved and valued at the 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.119
 human for all the people that matter to me 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.879
 yes
