his<00:04:35.570> foot<00:04:35.870> here<00:04:36.200> and<00:04:36.530> then<00:04:36.710> he's<00:04:36.830> going<00:04:36.980> to<00:04:37.040> try

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:37.310 
his foot here and then he's going to try

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.950 
his foot here and then he's going to try
and<00:04:37.340> do<00:04:37.640> a<00:04:37.670> little<00:04:37.940> bit<00:04:38.090> of<00:04:38.150> a<00:04:38.300> tug-of-war<00:04:38.570> with

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:38.960 
and do a little bit of a tug-of-war with

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:41.170 
and do a little bit of a tug-of-war with
the<00:04:39.170> Stegosaurus<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:40.100> let's<00:04:40.790> see<00:04:40.970> if<00:04:41.060> the

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
the Stegosaurus here let's see if the

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:44.910 
the Stegosaurus here let's see if the
dinosaur<00:04:41.780> or<00:04:42.080> the<00:04:42.230> trainer<00:04:42.500> struck<00:04:42.860> and<00:04:43.310> go<00:04:44.240> oh

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:44.920 
dinosaur or the trainer struck and go oh

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:22.310 
little bit smaller than him but I think

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:23.710 
little bit smaller than him but I think
the<00:05:22.610> trainer's<00:05:22.970> might<00:05:23.150> be<00:05:23.300> a<00:05:23.330> little<00:05:23.510> bit

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
the trainer's might be a little bit

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:25.540 
the trainer's might be a little bit
scared<00:05:24.080> of<00:05:24.290> him<00:05:24.440> so<00:05:24.680> he's<00:05:24.920> gonna<00:05:25.130> put<00:05:25.430> the

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:25.550 
scared of him so he's gonna put the

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.030 
scared of him so he's gonna put the
clamps<00:05:26.000> around<00:05:26.090> his<00:05:26.390> neck<00:05:26.630> and<00:05:27.320> do<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.830> little

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:28.040 
clamps around his neck and do a little

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:29.920

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:29.930
