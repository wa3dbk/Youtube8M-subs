00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.069
 Hi, I 'm samantha chagas costume designer. 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
 that would not only be okay with you 

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:09.389
 today we have our series of 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.360
 tutorials already announced by 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:15.089
 face and other social media 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.520
 today we will learn how to put 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.039
 to have been on the wall without glue is 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.769
 technique that I developed because I 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:24.359
 I really like to change things 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:27.180
 You can see that he's already a little bit 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:31.890
 different rather messy going 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.870
 explain why and the glue technique that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.680
 it's a technique with the head on the wall 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.800
 It's a lot of hard work and there 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:44.040
 as the law of least effort 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.890
 I decided to create this putting technique 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.360
 to the fabric in the machine without glue then I go 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.640
 explain why the studio is still 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 messy he was quite swayed 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:56.550
 so I decided to move to this new phase 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.829
 of the atelier that will be only pieces of 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.100
 medieval style people stopped doing 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.480
 the tribal dance costumes 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.000
 unfortunately it is a health issue 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.460
 my I have a rheumatic disease 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
 I was not allowing more than forest 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.840
 Your Orient Style 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:16.740
 so we took some advantage of it 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.960
 make the best of the worst and do only the 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.659
 you me I even or are thinking 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.570
 that's precisely why every single thing I 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.369
 I'm making every comic a form of 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.650
 organize different I'll're showing 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.470
 To you because suddenly you are 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.869
 wanting his studio too or wants to 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.810
 set up a place in your room to 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.180
 produce your things and you have no idea 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:42.119
 so I hope you have the law and that the street is 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:45.899
 coming from eight inspiration for you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:48.420
 you are also at this stage its okay 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.360
 Okay, so I'm going to show the environment now. 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.579
 that we have already modified and will put 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.350
 this video was recorded by another 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:59.439
 canal is called invested cans 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.630
 is a channel on wedding marriage 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:04.420

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:08.050
 my sister and we took many experiences 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:10.119
 from there to rock has several videos 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.300
 I'll put the link to this video here 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:16.600
 of the technique where we put the text 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.480
 on the wall if here the old wall of the 

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.489
 I finished with a cap I had made 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.560
 all messed up to have been a point 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.080
 Norman everyone to any machine 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.480
 for here my longboard I'm not 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.760
 learning the wall the computer 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.459
 frame does digital marketing study 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.340
 have to talk about it made the galley 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:39.580
 It's going to be a closed cabinet and you like it. 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:41.739
 of this new idea totally here in the blog 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.989
 or where you're earning video 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.090
 I will be very happy to know your 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:48.340
 opinion I love receiving messages 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.709
 always party does not encourage much 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:54.040
 work is a job 

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:57.000
 complicated with a lot of physical and 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.370
 also because creation is not soft 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.440
 so when I get a message 1 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.790
 600m all very value to it always 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:08.980
 I never answer the automatic response 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.810
 I'm waiting for this to know the 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.030
 that you found so much of the technique if you had 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.359
 some difficulty with a doubt only 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.359
 speak
