00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
because my audio likes to be sync if I

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:39.059 
because my audio likes to be sync if I
record<00:01:34.960> too<00:01:35.170> long<00:01:35.319> so<00:01:36.009> at<00:01:36.630> this<00:01:37.630> point<00:01:37.899> and<00:01:38.259> I

00:01:39.059 --> 00:01:39.069 
record too long so at this point and I

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:40.859 
record too long so at this point and I
realized<00:01:39.460> I<00:01:39.670> didn't<00:01:39.939> have<00:01:40.060> my<00:01:40.210> up<00:01:40.450> button

mapped<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:41.860> any<00:01:41.890> channel<00:01:42.310> my<00:01:42.429> controller<00:01:42.819> I

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
mapped to any channel my controller I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.699 
mapped to any channel my controller I
also<00:01:43.990> realized<00:01:44.500> that<00:01:44.590> I<00:01:44.740> absolutely<00:01:45.250> hate<00:01:45.759> the

xbox360<00:01:47.709> keypad<00:01:48.159> it<00:01:48.520> is<00:01:49.679> probably<00:01:50.679> one<00:01:50.830> of<00:01:50.860> the

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
xbox360 keypad it is probably one of the

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.410 
xbox360 keypad it is probably one of the
worst<00:01:51.159> I've<00:01:51.819> ever<00:01:51.939> used<00:01:52.299> it's<00:01:52.599> very<00:01:52.810> loose<00:01:54.420> not

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
made for a game like this maybe for

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.410 
made for a game like this maybe for
fighting<00:01:57.459> games<00:01:57.640> it<00:01:57.849> would<00:01:57.909> be<00:01:58.060> more<00:01:58.270> ideal

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420

faster and you can keep that extra
movement<00:02:42.130> speed<00:02:42.160> if<00:02:42.639> you<00:02:43.600> morph<00:02:43.989> into<00:02:44.139> a<00:02:44.230> ball

you're going to be using him to get this
energy<00:03:47.580> tank<00:03:47.940> okay

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
energy tank okay

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.230 
energy tank okay
so<00:03:49.020> what<00:03:49.110> you're<00:03:49.230> going<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.380> want<00:03:49.530> to<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.740> is

so what you're going to want to do is
shoot<00:03:51.240> the<00:03:51.450> energy<00:03:51.720> lock<00:03:51.930> here<00:03:52.170> duck<00:03:52.740> down<00:03:52.980> a

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:53.010 
shoot the energy lock here duck down a

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:58.880 
shoot the energy lock here duck down a
little<00:03:53.250> bit<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.880> jump<00:03:54.300> right<00:03:54.930> into<00:03:55.200> him<00:03:57.890> doing

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
little bit and jump right into him doing

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:01.310 
little bit and jump right into him doing
so<00:03:59.100> will<00:03:59.340> propel<00:03:59.760> you<00:03:59.880> backwards<00:04:00.330> as<00:04:01.050> you<00:04:01.110> can

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
to duck down first because one sails

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.340 
to duck down first because one sails
ducks<00:04:08.070> she<00:04:08.610> actually<00:04:09.000> jumps<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.840> little<00:04:10.200> bit

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:10.350 
ducks she actually jumps a little bit

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.310 
ducks she actually jumps a little bit
higher<00:04:10.820> the<00:04:11.820> extra<00:04:12.210> height<00:04:12.390> is<00:04:12.600> just<00:04:12.870> ready<00:04:13.170> to

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:47.270 
toes I'm doing here to get up these

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.100 
toes I'm doing here to get up these
walls<00:04:49.210> wall<00:04:50.210> jump<00:04:50.650> simple<00:04:51.650> as<00:04:51.740> that<00:04:52.030> this<00:04:53.030> is

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
walls wall jump simple as that this is

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.630 
walls wall jump simple as that this is
without<00:04:54.110> a<00:04:54.350> doubt<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.860> most<00:04:55.070> important

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:55.640 
without a doubt the most important

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:58.150 
without a doubt the most important
technique<00:04:56.030> if<00:04:56.540> you<00:04:57.080> are<00:04:57.320> planning<00:04:57.740> on<00:04:57.950> doing

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
technique if you are planning on doing

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.490 
technique if you are planning on doing
any<00:04:58.400> kind<00:04:58.610> of<00:04:58.700> sequence<00:04:59.090> breaking<00:04:59.510> in<00:05:00.230> this

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
any kind of sequence breaking in this

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.550 
any kind of sequence breaking in this
game<00:05:00.710> um<00:05:01.360> it<00:05:02.360> lets<00:05:02.660> your<00:05:02.840> to<00:05:02.990> so<00:05:03.380> many

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
game um it lets your to so many

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.190 
game um it lets your to so many
different<00:05:03.980> areas<00:05:04.130> you<00:05:05.090> do<00:05:05.210> a<00:05:05.240> speed<00:05:05.570> run<00:05:05.600> it

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
different areas you do a speed run it

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:10.560 
different areas you do a speed run it
saves<00:05:06.650> a<00:05:07.270> ridiculous<00:05:08.270> amount<00:05:08.540> of<00:05:08.630> time

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
saves a ridiculous amount of time

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.360 
saves a ridiculous amount of time
it<00:05:11.570> just<00:05:11.780> allows<00:05:12.140> for<00:05:12.320> huge<00:05:12.860> amounts<00:05:13.340> of

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
it just allows for huge amounts of

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.820 
it just allows for huge amounts of
mobility<00:05:13.910> getting<00:05:14.180> out<00:05:14.300> places<00:05:14.830> obviously

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
mobility getting out places obviously

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:18.900 
mobility getting out places obviously
I'm<00:05:15.920> kind<00:05:16.700> of<00:05:16.760> rusty<00:05:16.970> at<00:05:17.270> it<00:05:17.450> but<00:05:18.170> you<00:05:18.350> can

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:18.910 
I'm kind of rusty at it but you can

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.550 
I'm kind of rusty at it but you can
easily<00:05:19.910> have<00:05:20.390> been<00:05:20.540> out<00:05:20.720> of<00:05:20.750> this<00:05:20.960> room<00:05:21.170> by<00:05:21.350> now

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
easily have been out of this room by now

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.950 
easily have been out of this room by now
halfway<00:05:22.100> through<00:05:22.310> the<00:05:22.610> other<00:05:22.760> if<00:05:23.600> you're<00:05:23.810> good

halfway through the other if you're good

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:25.960 
halfway through the other if you're good
at<00:05:24.110> it<00:05:24.140> you<00:05:24.290> don't<00:05:24.530> need<00:05:24.590> use<00:05:24.800> platforms<00:05:25.460> for

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:25.970 
at it you don't need use platforms for

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:30.520 
at it you don't need use platforms for
any<00:05:26.120> reason<00:05:26.510> pretty<00:05:26.720> much<00:05:26.840> all<00:05:28.750> go<00:05:29.750> anywhere

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:30.530 
any reason pretty much all go anywhere

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.420 
any reason pretty much all go anywhere
it's<00:05:30.860> it's<00:05:31.670> pretty<00:05:31.940> sweetness<00:05:33.250> without<00:05:34.250> it

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:34.430 
it's it's pretty sweetness without it

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.430 
it's it's pretty sweetness without it
Super<00:05:34.850> Metroid<00:05:35.000> would<00:05:35.420> not<00:05:35.570> be<00:05:35.750> the<00:05:35.900> game<00:05:36.080> it

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
Super Metroid would not be the game it

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.930 
Super Metroid would not be the game it
is<00:05:36.590> today<00:05:36.860> it<00:05:37.010> would<00:05:37.100> have<00:05:37.130> lost<00:05:37.370> it<00:05:37.610> for<00:05:37.760> a

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:37.940 
is today it would have lost it for a

00:05:37.940 --> 00:05:40.570 
is today it would have lost it for a
long<00:05:38.060> time<00:05:38.240> ago<00:05:38.510> because<00:05:39.190> so<00:05:40.190> much<00:05:40.310> more<00:05:40.490> not

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:40.580 
long time ago because so much more not

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:46.360 
long time ago because so much more not
be<00:05:40.670> possible<00:05:41.410> but<00:05:43.900> to<00:05:44.900> do<00:05:45.050> those<00:05:45.260> wall<00:05:45.830> jumps

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
be possible but to do those wall jumps

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:51.120 
be possible but to do those wall jumps
I<00:05:46.400> hear<00:05:47.120> do<00:05:47.300> is<00:05:47.510> be<00:05:48.130> spin<00:05:49.130> jumping<00:05:49.580> into<00:05:49.940> a<00:05:50.150> wall

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:51.130 
I hear do is be spin jumping into a wall

00:05:51.130 --> 00:05:54.010 
I hear do is be spin jumping into a wall
then<00:05:52.130> you<00:05:52.160> want<00:05:52.520> to<00:05:52.640> impress<00:05:53.120> the<00:05:53.450> opposite

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:54.020 
then you want to impress the opposite

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:56.610 
then you want to impress the opposite
direction<00:05:54.140> that<00:05:54.440> you're<00:05:54.650> going<00:05:54.680> on<00:05:55.130> the<00:05:55.550> d-pad

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:56.620 
direction that you're going on the d-pad

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:01.500 
direction that you're going on the d-pad
and<00:05:56.920> jump<00:05:57.720> soon<00:05:58.720> thereafter<00:05:59.700> and<00:06:00.700> by<00:06:01.120> doing<00:06:01.390> so

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:01.510 
and jump soon thereafter and by doing so

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.880 
and jump soon thereafter and by doing so
you<00:06:01.750> will<00:06:03.630> jump<00:06:04.630> off<00:06:04.810> the<00:06:04.960> wall<00:06:05.080> away<00:06:05.470> from<00:06:05.560> it

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:05.890 
you will jump off the wall away from it

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:08.970 
you will jump off the wall away from it
however<00:06:06.670> you<00:06:07.000> can<00:06:07.180> quickly<00:06:07.770> move<00:06:08.770> your

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:08.980 
however you can quickly move your

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:11.820 
however you can quickly move your
direction<00:06:09.280> of<00:06:09.610> movement<00:06:10.000> back<00:06:10.960> into<00:06:11.290> the<00:06:11.680> wall

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:11.830 
direction of movement back into the wall

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.970 
direction of movement back into the wall
and<00:06:12.400> just<00:06:12.790> keep<00:06:13.000> scaling<00:06:13.300> the<00:06:13.540> same<00:06:13.690> wall<00:06:13.980> and

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:14.980 
and just keep scaling the same wall and

00:06:14.980 --> 00:06:17.760 
and just keep scaling the same wall and
so<00:06:15.340> I<00:06:15.700> did<00:06:15.850> that<00:06:15.970> a<00:06:16.840> couple<00:06:16.870> times

00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:17.770 
so I did that a couple times

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:24.590 
so I did that a couple times
sorry<00:06:18.400> about<00:06:18.460> the<00:06:18.700> skipping<00:06:20.970> this<00:06:21.970> guy<00:06:22.180> i

this fantastic picture remember if
you're<00:06:31.000> doing<00:06:31.210> a<00:06:31.360> speed<00:06:31.600> run<00:06:31.810> is<00:06:32.050> we<00:06:32.950> don't

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.100 
you're doing a speed run is we don't

00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.420 
you're doing a speed run is we don't
want<00:06:33.310> to<00:06:33.490> just<00:06:33.700> plow<00:06:34.710> once<00:06:35.710> you're<00:06:36.040> gonna<00:06:36.190> want

want to just plow once you're gonna want

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:38.640 
want to just plow once you're gonna want
to<00:06:36.490> wait<00:06:36.670> about<00:06:37.390> a<00:06:37.540> second<00:06:38.020> in<00:06:38.110> between<00:06:38.230> each

00:06:38.640 --> 00:06:38.650 
to wait about a second in between each

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.280 
to wait about a second in between each
missile<00:06:39.070> and<00:06:39.250> then<00:06:39.720> there's<00:06:40.720> five<00:06:40.900> missiles

00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:42.570 
you should be able to finish them off

00:06:42.570 --> 00:06:49.770 
you should be able to finish them off
pretty<00:06:43.570> easily<00:06:48.060> however<00:06:49.060> in<00:06:49.330> the<00:06:49.450> PAL<00:06:49.750> version

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:49.780 
pretty easily however in the PAL version

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:53.400 
pretty easily however in the PAL version
if<00:06:50.530> you<00:06:50.590> really<00:06:51.370> really<00:06:52.090> want<00:06:52.180> to<00:06:52.450> you<00:06:53.380> can

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:53.410 
if you really really want to you can

00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:55.950 
if you really really want to you can
just<00:06:53.980> barely<00:06:54.460> make<00:06:54.880> it<00:06:54.910> out<00:06:55.150> of<00:06:55.480> the<00:06:55.750> door

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
just barely make it out of the door

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:00.570 
just barely make it out of the door
before<00:06:56.230> it<00:06:56.470> closes<00:06:56.770> and<00:06:58.890> give<00:06:59.890> you<00:07:00.010> a<00:07:00.040> little<00:07:00.190> a

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580 
before it closes and give you a little a

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:05.520 
before it closes and give you a little a
little<00:07:01.450> extra<00:07:01.840> time<00:07:02.020> shaved<00:07:02.590> off<00:07:02.860> there<00:07:04.530> over

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:05.530 
little extra time shaved off there over

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.300 
little extra time shaved off there over
to<00:07:05.650> play<00:07:05.830> the<00:07:06.010> NTSC<00:07:06.700> version<00:07:07.590> the<00:07:08.590> reason<00:07:09.010> for

00:07:09.300 --> 00:07:09.310 
to play the NTSC version the reason for

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:10.560 
to play the NTSC version the reason for
that<00:07:09.400> change<00:07:09.640> is<00:07:09.880> because<00:07:10.270> the<00:07:10.450> different

00:07:10.560 --> 00:07:10.570 
that change is because the different

00:07:10.570 --> 00:07:15.180 
that change is because the different
frame<00:07:10.990> rates<00:07:11.020> I<00:07:11.650> guess<00:07:11.950> in<00:07:12.190> a<00:07:13.770> land<00:07:14.770> ESC

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:15.190

frame rates I guess in a land ESC
television<00:07:15.760> so<00:07:15.970> that<00:07:16.000> game<00:07:16.690> designers<00:07:17.730> change

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:18.730 
television so that game designers change

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:21.630 
television so that game designers change
the<00:07:18.910> speeds<00:07:19.210> a<00:07:19.420> little<00:07:19.660> bit<00:07:19.810> of<00:07:20.530> Samus<00:07:20.980> to<00:07:21.490> make

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:21.640 
the speeds a little bit of Samus to make

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.190 
the speeds a little bit of Samus to make
up<00:07:21.790> for<00:07:21.940> that<00:07:21.970> however<00:07:22.330> the<00:07:22.870> game<00:07:23.170> world<00:07:23.500> is

00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:25.200 
up for that however the game world is

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:29.520 
up for that however the game world is
slower<00:07:26.200> because<00:07:27.870> change<00:07:28.870> the<00:07:29.020> rest<00:07:29.200> of<00:07:29.350> stuff

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:29.530 
slower because change the rest of stuff

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:31.620 
slower because change the rest of stuff
just<00:07:29.680> Samus<00:07:30.160> so<00:07:30.370> everything<00:07:31.330> else<00:07:31.480> a<00:07:31.540> little

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:31.630 
just Samus so everything else a little

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:34.110 
just Samus so everything else a little
slower<00:07:31.990> in<00:07:32.170> the<00:07:32.230> PAL<00:07:32.440> version<00:07:32.850> now<00:07:33.850> what<00:07:33.970> we're

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:34.120 
slower in the PAL version now what we're

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.650 
slower in the PAL version now what we're
doing<00:07:34.390> here<00:07:34.660> is<00:07:35.130> BOM<00:07:36.130> jumping<00:07:36.610> up<00:07:36.820> to<00:07:37.270> what's

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:37.660 
doing here is BOM jumping up to what's

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:39.589 
doing here is BOM jumping up to what's
called<00:07:37.870> the<00:07:38.320> gauntlet

00:07:39.589 --> 00:07:39.599 
called the gauntlet

00:07:39.599 --> 00:07:42.589 
called the gauntlet
you're<00:07:39.899> really<00:07:40.080> not<00:07:40.349> supposed<00:07:40.619> to<00:07:41.369> I<00:07:41.879> guess

00:07:42.589 --> 00:07:42.599 
you're really not supposed to I guess

00:07:42.599 --> 00:07:44.829 
you're really not supposed to I guess
get<00:07:43.349> to<00:07:43.499> this<00:07:43.619> area<00:07:44.009> until<00:07:44.159> you<00:07:44.369> have<00:07:44.520> the

00:07:44.829 --> 00:07:44.839 
get to this area until you have the

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:47.239 
get to this area until you have the
ScrewAttack<00:07:45.869> which<00:07:46.499> just<00:07:46.710> doesn't<00:07:46.889> come<00:07:47.129> till

00:07:47.239 --> 00:07:47.249 
ScrewAttack which just doesn't come till

00:07:47.249 --> 00:07:49.519 
ScrewAttack which just doesn't come till
very<00:07:47.460> late<00:07:47.580> the<00:07:47.879> game<00:07:48.059> however<00:07:48.330> we<00:07:49.319> want<00:07:49.469> to

00:07:49.519 --> 00:07:49.529 
very late the game however we want to

00:07:49.529 --> 00:07:51.739 
very late the game however we want to
get<00:07:49.649> as<00:07:49.800> many<00:07:50.009> energy<00:07:50.429> tanks<00:07:50.819> as<00:07:50.999> possible

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:51.749 
get as many energy tanks as possible

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:55.249 
get as many energy tanks as possible
that's<00:07:51.990> pretty<00:07:52.199> imperative<00:07:52.679> so<00:07:53.839> Bob<00:07:54.839> jumping

00:07:55.249 --> 00:07:55.259 
that's pretty imperative so Bob jumping

00:07:55.259 --> 00:07:55.959 
that's pretty imperative so Bob jumping
up<00:07:55.379> here

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:55.969 
up here

00:07:55.969 --> 00:07:57.980

don't<00:07:56.969> worry<00:07:57.119> bombs<00:07:57.449> up<00:07:57.659> we've<00:07:57.779> done<00:07:57.899> to

00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:57.990 
don't worry bombs up we've done to

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:02.329 
don't worry bombs up we've done to
heaven<00:07:58.259> too<00:07:58.860> often<00:07:59.279> and<00:08:00.949> you<00:08:01.949> don't<00:08:02.129> have<00:08:02.219> to

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740 
watch me do that for twenty seconds or

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:12.320 
watch me do that for twenty seconds or
so<00:08:06.319> anymore<00:08:09.499> anyway<00:08:10.499> going<00:08:11.129> here<00:08:11.369> catching
