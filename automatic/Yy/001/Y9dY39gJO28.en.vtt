definitely a welcoming new feature it
also<00:01:52.200> has<00:01:52.409> built-in<00:01:52.680> storage<00:01:53.189> so<00:01:53.640> it's<00:01:53.969> only

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
also has built-in storage so it's only

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.870 
also has built-in storage so it's only
one<00:01:54.570> gigabyte<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.320> internal<00:01:56.100> storage<00:01:56.189> however

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
one gigabyte of internal storage however

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.300 
one gigabyte of internal storage however
that's<00:01:57.090> still<00:01:57.329> better<00:01:57.509> than<00:01:57.659> nothing<00:01:58.439> that

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
that's still better than nothing that

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.609 
that's still better than nothing that
they<00:01:59.729> had<00:01:59.939> for<00:02:00.240> the<00:02:00.329> previous<00:02:00.750> PS<00:02:00.990> Vita<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.439> now

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
they had for the previous PS Vita so now

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:03.469 
they had for the previous PS Vita so now
you<00:02:01.680> can<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:02.340> get<00:02:02.520> your<00:02:02.610> PS<00:02:02.880> Vita<00:02:03.090> and<00:02:03.270> play

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
you can just get your PS Vita and play

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
you can just get your PS Vita and play
some<00:02:03.539> standard<00:02:04.140> games<00:02:04.380> on<00:02:04.619> it<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.920> course<00:02:05.549> you

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
some standard games on it of course you

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.980 
some standard games on it of course you
wouldn't<00:02:05.880> be<00:02:06.090> able<00:02:06.180> to<00:02:06.390> play<00:02:06.509> too<00:02:06.600> many<00:02:06.869> games

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
wouldn't be able to play too many games

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.710 
wouldn't be able to play too many games
because<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.890> could<00:02:08.430> see<00:02:08.460> you<00:02:08.670> filling<00:02:09.300> your<00:02:09.330> one

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
because I could see you filling your one

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.330 
because I could see you filling your one
gig<00:02:09.960> storage<00:02:10.380> pretty<00:02:11.039> fast<00:02:11.340> so<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:14.130> would

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
gig storage pretty fast so you would

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.950 
gig storage pretty fast so you would
probably<00:02:14.850> still<00:02:15.090> need<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.420> purchase<00:02:15.630> one<00:02:15.930> of

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
probably still need to purchase one of

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:16.550 
probably still need to purchase one of

eighty n R that's about 190 US dollars
so<00:02:41.480> it's<00:02:42.480> actually<00:02:42.599> unclear<00:02:43.140> if<00:02:43.260> this<00:02:43.410> is

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
so it's actually unclear if this is

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.170 
so it's actually unclear if this is
going<00:02:43.709> to<00:02:43.800> be<00:02:43.920> launching<00:02:44.459> in<00:02:44.640> the<00:02:44.700> United

States or any other country for that

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.250 
States or any other country for that
matter<00:02:47.340> but<00:02:48.150> if<00:02:48.300> it<00:02:48.420> is<00:02:48.450> probably<00:02:48.989> going<00:02:49.140> to<00:02:49.200> be

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
matter but if it is probably going to be
