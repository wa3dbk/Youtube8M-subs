00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:33.600 
gadget a double-oh-seven something I was

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.420 
gadget a double-oh-seven something I was
making<00:02:33.930> sure<00:02:34.110> wasn't<00:02:34.380> an<00:02:34.650> alien<00:02:35.010> ship<00:02:35.040> that

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
making sure wasn't an alien ship that

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.910 
making sure wasn't an alien ship that
was<00:02:35.520> going<00:02:35.670> to<00:02:35.730> abduct<00:02:36.300> me<00:02:36.510> first<00:02:37.290> and<00:02:37.560> then<00:02:37.860> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
was going to abduct me first and then I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:40.790 
was going to abduct me first and then I
realized<00:02:38.430> it<00:02:38.640> was<00:02:38.700> just<00:02:39.000> another<00:02:39.500> art<00:02:40.500> piece

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
realized it was just another art piece

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.150 
realized it was just another art piece
and<00:02:41.540> then<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.590> presumed<00:02:43.590> that<00:02:43.739> it<00:02:43.830> was<00:02:43.980> probably

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
and then I presumed that it was probably
