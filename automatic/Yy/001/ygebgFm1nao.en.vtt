00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
gets per second we have a driver utility

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.410 
gets per second we have a driver utility
disk<00:02:28.890> for<00:02:29.190> the<00:02:29.280> main<00:02:29.430> drivers<00:02:29.910> and<00:02:30.180> for<00:02:30.360> the

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
disk for the main drivers and for the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:32.360 
disk for the main drivers and for the
chips<00:02:30.660> etc<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:31.260> we<00:02:31.320> also<00:02:31.530> have<00:02:31.800> a<00:02:31.830> separate

disc for the LAN and bluetooth drivers

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.160 
disc for the LAN and bluetooth drivers
and<00:02:35.180> obviously<00:02:36.180> as<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.390> mentioned<00:02:36.840> before<00:02:36.870> this

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and obviously as I mentioned before this

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
is an AC model so it comes with 20 and

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.180 
is an AC model so it comes with 20 and
10<00:02:39.390> and<00:02:39.540> so<00:02:39.660> it's<00:02:39.810> double<00:02:40.110> antenna<00:02:40.410> which

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
10 and so it's double antenna which

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.160 
10 and so it's double antenna which
support<00:02:41.610> 25<00:02:41.940> gigahertz<00:02:42.180> now<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> really<00:02:43.020> do

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
support 25 gigahertz now I really do

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.100 
support 25 gigahertz now I really do

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:09.930 
recommendations based on the type of

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:11.870 
recommendations based on the type of
cooling<00:03:10.410> and<00:03:10.950> as<00:03:11.190> well<00:03:11.340> if<00:03:11.430> we<00:03:11.550> gonna<00:03:11.730> all<00:03:11.850> the

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 
cooling and as well if we gonna all the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.240 
cooling and as well if we gonna all the
clocks<00:03:12.150> so<00:03:12.360> obviously<00:03:13.290> it<00:03:13.410> recommends<00:03:13.980> power

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
clocks so obviously it recommends power

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.940 
clocks so obviously it recommends power
coolers<00:03:14.760> and<00:03:15.380> doesn't<00:03:16.380> really<00:03:16.530> recommend

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
coolers and doesn't really recommend

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.310 
coolers and doesn't really recommend
stockers<00:03:17.340> poor<00:03:17.880> performance<00:03:18.450> but<00:03:19.260> the

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 
stockers poor performance but the

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:20.990 
stockers poor performance but the
interesting<00:03:19.590> thing<00:03:19.950> is<00:03:19.980> it<00:03:20.190> gives<00:03:20.370> you<00:03:20.520> an<00:03:20.700> emd

taken of course look at move but as you

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:58.660 
taken of course look at move but as you
can<00:05:55.460> see<00:05:55.700> is<00:05:56.200> primarily<00:05:57.200> aimed<00:05:57.500> for<00:05:57.920> budget

00:06:51.559 --> 00:06:53.929 
say what's what water is going to be
it's<00:06:52.559> not<00:06:52.679> an<00:06:52.770> expensive<00:06:53.339> it's<00:06:53.520> not<00:06:53.669> going<00:06:53.819> to

00:06:53.929 --> 00:06:53.939 
it's not an expensive it's not going to

00:06:53.939 --> 00:06:57.139 
it's not an expensive it's not going to
cost<00:06:54.089> you<00:06:54.240> i<00:06:54.330> would<00:06:54.659> say<00:06:54.839> around<00:06:54.929> 50<00:06:55.349> pound<00:06:56.149> top

00:06:57.139 --> 00:06:57.149 
cost you i would say around 50 pound top

00:06:57.149 --> 00:06:59.299 
cost you i would say around 50 pound top
of<00:06:57.300> the<00:06:57.360> pus<00:06:58.199> including<00:06:58.619> premium<00:06:59.069> that<00:06:59.189> you'll

00:06:59.299 --> 00:06:59.309

00:06:59.309 --> 00:07:01.219 
of the pus including premium that you'll
pay<00:06:59.429> for<00:06:59.459> ATX<00:06:59.939> because<00:07:00.209> smaller<00:07:00.539> usually

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
pay for ATX because smaller usually

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:04.399 
pay for ATX because smaller usually
means<00:07:01.439> more<00:07:01.679> expensive<00:07:02.159> and<00:07:03.229> especially<00:07:04.229> if

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:04.409 
means more expensive and especially if

00:07:05.929 --> 00:07:05.939 
you take what the existed would be

00:07:05.939 --> 00:07:08.869 
you take what the existed would be
impact<00:07:06.240> on<00:07:06.419> these<00:07:06.569> m87<00:07:07.169> Haswell<00:07:07.709> chipset<00:07:08.129> but
