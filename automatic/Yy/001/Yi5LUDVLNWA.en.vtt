00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:18.510
 hessel go all here jo I find you 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.260
 for a new tutorial and yes a 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.119
 tutorial 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.380
 it was a long time since I had not 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.060
 made tutorials I made only one 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.470
 currently on the channel that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.860
 obviously the one to create his style in 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.050
 minecraft 1.8 and today I'm going in 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.710
 to do another so I'm this 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.450
 video on September 2nd at 2:07 pm 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.890
 precisely and I will show you 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.410
 how to add more ram to minecraft 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.160
 then this asus is valid with the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.930
 new launcher 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.360
 what does it matter the version of minecraft that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:51.710
 this is the 1.6 there a point it's all the 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.960
 1.8 it will work in all cases so 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.060
 to add more ram you choose 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.740
 one of your minecraft profiles any 

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:00.840
 which one you want for example 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.439
 I will take my low profile vanilla to 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.920
 the association you click on edit 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:10.770
 profile and you go in java setting 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.950
 at 27 and you'll have an option with a 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:17.969
 hookable clickable box called 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.510
 jvm 1 normally starts you will not have 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:21.040
 Nothing at all 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:24.490
 or then presets can be 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.690
 presets internet case so for 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.460
 allocate more ram to scratch you 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.980
 just write what I wrote there 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.480
 ie you make a shot is so 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.140
 a few signs - in someone 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:39.160
 was shooting to add xfx with the first 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.840
 x in uppercase and then add you back 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.930
 the number of trains that you want to 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.600
 played for rent in giga and 1 g uppercase 

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:49.720
 for giga for example you and I 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.960
 added 4g so that's 4 gigas allocated to 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:56.560
 this profile minecraft to know that you do not 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:02:00.160
 absolutely must not put more of the 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.650
 half of the gigas that you have in 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:03.610
 your pc for example - in my pc I 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:06.010
 8 gigas of ram 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.540
 so I do not have to put more than 4 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:09.429
 gigas since hadji kassé half of 8 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.490
 so to find out how much you have drama 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:15.490
 in your pc you go to your menu 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.300
 start that part in this windows 8 itself 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.760
 present in this form 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:21.690
 you right click you go on 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.980
 system and that you open this window 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.830
 in this vein system you will see 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.470
 the number of installed memory ram 8 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.190
 gigas another method to do this 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.290
 and launch an xdrive dice so for 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.580
 know how much drain do you have so for 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.060
 do this you go back to the menu 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.280
 start 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:45.930
 you right click executed and 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.769
 you type dxdiag 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.769
 click on ok 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:59.489
 so after that you open a little 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 window i do yes so here is a throw 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.250
 a direct diagnosis x and in this 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.150
 diagnostic 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:08.760
 we can see that memory 8192 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:11.069
 megabit of ram so 8 giga drama 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:12.959
 so basically once you've seen 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.549
 how long do you have the 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.319
 trouble to let the diagnosis continue 

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:18.359
 you close that and you can 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:19.500
 put half you want for example 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.870
 I can put at least I can be that 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.040
 two gigas her hair or so 3 gigabytes 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:26.849
 to try to balance a little more 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:30.200
 his performances so hop once you 

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:32.849
 have selected you put by whose 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.470
 how many j.ayew do you want 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.689
 can do this five profile as well 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:41.190
 launch your game you will see that in the 

00:03:36.689 --> 00:03:43.290
 game you will then have the number of 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:46.590
 2 gigas that you put in memory 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:49.290
 used to know that if you want 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:51.210
 apply this setting to all your profiles 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.540
 you select it you do 

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:56.310
 control is to copy it and then you 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.950
 go to another profile down this one 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:00.510
 a little profile and you do in 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:02.760
 account by selecting everything that is 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:04.290
 so glad to meet to stick it as 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:06.780
 I already had 4 gigas and if that makes 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.470
 his brand olay 4 gigas so now 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.370
 we will start the game to see how many giga 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.610
 my game 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:20.199
 now that I have set the givet 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.549
 margut men's re so I started 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:23.320
 minecraft simply clicking 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.300
 play so here is the game started 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.910
 launcher is closed we will create a 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:30.220
 new map in creative that's new 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.229
 concrete world that I'm going to show you 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:38.199
 that the name of 2 gigas is valid here 

00:04:35.229 --> 00:04:40.419
 the secret world quietly that's it 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.360
 y is the mab well of those generated so 

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:46.389
 this at prices the most a little bit of time 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.010
 and if I support maintenance on f3 tac on 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.810
 realizes at the top right of 

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:51.760
 the screen so look closely at this part 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:54.100
 there of the screen once China leads 

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:55.510
 make the inventory will be gone here it is 

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.440
 realizes that in even so 

00:04:55.510 --> 00:05:02.919
 memory I have 3641 megabit because 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.260
 jealous and 4 gigabytes of memory dram to 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:08.350
 Minecraft 

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:09.310
 so here's adding more gia 

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:10.690
 so ram 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:12.910
 you will obviously increase 

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:15.250
 minecraft performance and we could 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:17.650
 do more things for example if you 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:19.479
 have a medium bc config and you 

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:21.070
 can not use shaders a 

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:22.479
 maybe by adding a little bit 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:24.450
 of ram you will be able to use the shaders 

00:05:22.479 --> 00:05:27.220
 more suitably for example 

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:28.479
 obviously the ram blades that will 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:29.620
 during against it must obviously have 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:30.970
 a good graphic card to my 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.800
 processor etc etc 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:34.120
 lara gut but will still 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.760
 to increase in weight performance 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.020
 for example to increase the distance 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.930
 display beyond 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:43.039
 of sèze each for example really 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:45.169
 have a longer display distance 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:47.680
 optimized and therefore have a better 

00:05:45.169 --> 00:05:51.979
 quality of play 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.139
 so here on this thank you you to watch 

00:05:51.979 --> 00:05:56.810
 this tutorial of a little tutorial that 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:06:00.050
 explained clearly I think how 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.759
 allocate more memory to minecraft so 

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.000
 remember not to allocate 

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:06.470
 more than half of what you have 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.150
 like ram in your pc so not in me 

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:10.250
 as I have 8 gigas it is not necessary that 

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.509
 I would have more than 4 gigas simply 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.889
 because my pc mac consume 

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:14.030
 resources not even that I launch my 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.250
 serious which obviously consumes the 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:21.889
 queen to be able to manage activities 

00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:24.409
 others so really avoid to allocate 

00:06:21.889 --> 00:06:26.180
 too much memory to minecraft anyway 

00:06:24.409 --> 00:06:29.229
 I had more than half of the ram 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:31.789
 total that you have in your pc here is 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.590
 so on this thank you for watching 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:35.750
 this tutorial was not yours 

00:06:33.590 --> 00:06:38.509
 subscribe to the channel to put a small 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.129
 blue thumbs to pau it's a a poster a 

00:06:38.509 --> 00:06:43.190
 comment if ever you have any 

00:06:40.129 --> 00:06:45.349
 something to add to say 'this is the fact 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:47.150
 always pleasure and I tell you to the 

00:06:45.349 --> 00:06:51.190
