bees flying in and out of the chimney

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:11.449 
bees flying in and out of the chimney
and<00:00:09.900> they<00:00:10.500> weren't<00:00:10.709> particularly<00:00:11.010> keen<00:00:11.340> on

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:11.459 
and they weren't particularly keen on

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:13.720 
and they weren't particularly keen on
that<00:00:11.519> they<00:00:11.820> didn't<00:00:12.000> want<00:00:12.180> bees<00:00:13.020> flying<00:00:13.440> around

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:13.730 
that they didn't want bees flying around

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.400 
that they didn't want bees flying around
potentially<00:00:14.730> stinging<00:00:15.150> or<00:00:15.330> terrifying<00:00:16.230> their

potentially stinging or terrifying their

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.010

children<00:00:16.770> so<00:00:17.010> they<00:00:17.760> said<00:00:18.029> two<00:00:18.480> options<00:00:18.869> we

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
children so they said two options we

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.320 
children so they said two options we
could<00:00:19.140> either<00:00:19.289> kill<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.130> bees<00:00:20.280> or<00:00:20.550> we<00:00:21.180> could

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:21.330 
could either kill the bees or we could

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.820 
could either kill the bees or we could
try<00:00:21.450> and<00:00:21.510> capture<00:00:21.690> the<00:00:21.870> life<00:00:22.110> as<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.440> said<00:00:22.650> well

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
try and capture the life as I said well

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.170 
try and capture the life as I said well
it's<00:00:23.070> much<00:00:23.250> better<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.520> try<00:00:23.700> and<00:00:23.789> capture<00:00:23.910> them

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
it's much better to try and capture them

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.029 
it's much better to try and capture them
alive<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.630> they'll<00:00:25.350> be<00:00:25.530> a<00:00:25.560> really<00:00:25.830> strong

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
alive and they'll be a really strong

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.640 
alive and they'll be a really strong
colony<00:00:26.430> we<00:00:26.640> can<00:00:26.789> set<00:00:27.030> them<00:00:27.330> up<00:00:27.510> so<00:00:27.840> I'm<00:00:28.500> going

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
colony we can set them up so I'm going

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.040 
colony we can set them up so I'm going
to<00:00:28.680> establish<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.340> nucleus<00:00:29.880> box<00:00:30.119> on<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.840> wall

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
to establish a nucleus box on the wall

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.900 
to establish a nucleus box on the wall
and<00:00:31.320> get<00:00:31.890> the<00:00:32.009> bees<00:00:32.160> to<00:00:32.340> come<00:00:32.489> out<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.759> wall

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
and get the bees to come out of the wall

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.970

and go into the box here's what I mean

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.770 
and go into the box here's what I mean
by<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.160> new<00:00:35.280> face<00:00:35.430> box<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.879> a<00:00:35.940> very<00:00:36.030> small<00:00:36.359> half

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780

plans is how to make these in the
dimensions<00:00:50.729> etc<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.809> I'm<00:00:52.440> going<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.679> mount

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:53.159 
dimensions etc so I'm going to mount

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:55.299 
dimensions etc so I'm going to mount
this<00:00:53.280> on<00:00:53.429> the<00:00:53.460> wall<00:00:53.550> I'll<00:00:53.819> do<00:00:54.210> that<00:00:54.300> right<00:00:54.449> now

00:00:55.299 --> 00:00:55.309 
this on the wall I'll do that right now

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:57.259 
this on the wall I'll do that right now
okay<00:00:56.309> as<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.460> can<00:00:56.579> see<00:00:56.699> I<00:00:56.729> just<00:00:56.789> mounted<00:00:57.179> this

00:00:57.259 --> 00:00:57.269 
okay as you can see I just mounted this

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:58.759 
okay as you can see I just mounted this
board<00:00:57.569> at<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:57.780> back<00:00:57.960> of<00:00:58.109> the<00:00:58.199> nucleus<00:00:58.559> box

00:00:58.759 --> 00:00:58.769 
board at the back of the nucleus box

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:00.139 
board at the back of the nucleus box
just<00:00:58.979> using<00:00:59.219> a<00:00:59.280> couple<00:00:59.399> of<00:00:59.609> screws<00:00:59.879> there

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149

that's going to allow us to fix the

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:04.310 
that's going to allow us to fix the
nucleus<00:01:02.940> box<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.209> the<00:01:03.299> wall<00:01:03.510> above<00:01:03.870> where<00:01:04.170> this

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
nucleus box to the wall above where this

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.670 
nucleus box to the wall above where this
opening<00:01:04.680> is<00:01:04.830> and<00:01:05.630> I'm<00:01:06.630> out<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.409> just<00:01:07.530> right

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
opening is and I'm out it's just right

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.480 
opening is and I'm out it's just right
up<00:01:07.799> there<00:01:08.039> always<00:01:08.369> when<00:01:08.640> there's<00:01:08.820> a<00:01:08.880> cavity

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490 
up there always when there's a cavity

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.520 
up there always when there's a cavity
there's<00:01:11.490> often<00:01:11.820> more<00:01:11.969> than<00:01:12.030> one<00:01:12.270> entrance<00:01:12.570> at

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
there's often more than one entrance at

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:14.840 
there's often more than one entrance at
the<00:01:13.590> bees<00:01:13.799> can<00:01:14.009> go<00:01:14.039> in<00:01:14.159> and<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.520> now<00:01:14.640> here

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
the bees can go in and out of now here

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.889 
the bees can go in and out of now here
you<00:01:14.939> can<00:01:15.030> see<00:01:15.950> loads<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.219> these<00:01:17.600> going<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.659> not

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:18.899 
you can see loads of these going in not

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:21.319 
you can see loads of these going in not
right<00:01:19.200> here<00:01:19.500> it's<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.070> main<00:01:20.219> space<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.299> a

00:01:21.319 --> 00:01:21.329 
right here it's the main space but a

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.520 
right here it's the main space but a
pulpit<00:01:21.659> in<00:01:22.649> that<00:01:22.799> corner<00:01:23.159> at<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.340> very<00:01:23.490> back

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
pulpit in that corner at the very back

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.170 
pulpit in that corner at the very back
there<00:01:24.770> this<00:01:24.860> bucket<00:01:25.190> they're<00:01:25.310> going<00:01:25.460> tiny

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:26.180 
there this bucket they're going tiny

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.230 
there this bucket they're going tiny
little<00:01:26.360> cavity<00:01:26.840> so<00:01:27.800> that's<00:01:28.010> it<00:01:28.150> we're<00:01:29.150> going

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
little cavity so that's it we're going

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:31.830 
little cavity so that's it we're going
to<00:01:29.300> have<00:01:29.420> to<00:01:29.570> do

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.270 

some<00:01:32.320> sort<00:01:32.500> of<00:01:32.530> screening<00:01:32.770> in<00:01:32.950> front<00:01:33.130> of<00:01:33.220> that

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
some sort of screening in front of that

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.610 
some sort of screening in front of that
as<00:01:33.430> well<00:01:33.700> so<00:01:33.940> we're<00:01:34.090> going<00:01:34.210> to<00:01:34.380> block<00:01:35.380> that<00:01:35.560> out

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:35.620 
as well so we're going to block that out

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:37.110 
as well so we're going to block that out
and<00:01:35.860> there<00:01:35.980> may<00:01:36.070> be<00:01:36.100> even<00:01:36.250> spaces<00:01:36.760> further<00:01:36.970> up

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120 
and there may be even spaces further up

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.330 
and there may be even spaces further up
the<00:01:37.210> chimneys<00:01:37.510> who<00:01:37.720> knows

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
the chimneys who knows

so<00:01:41.590> I'm<00:01:42.100> going<00:01:42.250> to<00:01:42.280> make<00:01:42.400> a<00:01:42.430> wired<00:01:42.730> screen<00:01:43.180> that

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
so I'm going to make a wired screen that

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.500 
so I'm going to make a wired screen that
forms<00:01:44.230> a<00:01:44.320> cone<00:01:44.670> outside<00:01:45.670> of<00:01:45.760> this<00:01:45.910> area<00:01:46.240> here

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
forms a cone outside of this area here

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:48.750 
forms a cone outside of this area here
and<00:01:47.200> comes<00:01:47.500> out<00:01:47.650> projecting<00:01:48.220> outwards<00:01:48.640> like

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:48.760 
and comes out projecting outwards like

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:50.970 
and comes out projecting outwards like
this<00:01:49.090> towards<00:01:49.990> the<00:01:50.170> other<00:01:50.290> box<00:01:50.530> which<00:01:50.740> is<00:01:50.860> up

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:50.980 
this towards the other box which is up

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.970 
this towards the other box which is up
here<00:01:51.010> and<00:01:51.820> then<00:01:52.410> next<00:01:53.410> thing<00:01:53.530> I'm<00:01:53.680> going<00:01:53.830> to<00:01:53.890> do

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:53.980 
here and then next thing I'm going to do

00:01:53.980 --> 00:01:59.700 
here and then next thing I'm going to do
that<00:01:54.070> is<00:01:54.250> put<00:01:54.930> some<00:01:56.280> old<00:01:57.280> Beco<00:01:58.440> from<00:01:59.440> another

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
that is put some old Beco from another

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.270 
that is put some old Beco from another
hive<00:01:59.950> that<00:01:59.980> I<00:02:00.250> have<00:02:00.810> and<00:02:01.810> this<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.100> just<00:02:03.100> old

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 
hive that I have and this is just old

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.270 
hive that I have and this is just old
comb<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.880> has<00:02:04.500> been<00:02:05.500> used<00:02:05.680> by<00:02:05.740> bees<00:02:05.950> in<00:02:06.160> the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280 
comb that has been used by bees in the

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.040 
comb that has been used by bees in the
past<00:02:06.490> it's<00:02:06.760> kind<00:02:07.060> of<00:02:07.090> dark<00:02:07.300> in<00:02:07.420> color<00:02:07.660> and<00:02:07.900> it

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
past it's kind of dark in color and it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.080 
past it's kind of dark in color and it
smells<00:02:08.260> nice<00:02:08.440> and<00:02:08.500> sweet<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.010> so<00:02:09.790> the<00:02:09.940> bees

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.090 
smells nice and sweet and so the bees

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.940 
smells nice and sweet and so the bees
that<00:02:10.119> come<00:02:10.570> are<00:02:10.869> left<00:02:11.140> outside<00:02:11.320> will<00:02:11.680> smell

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:11.950 
that come are left outside will smell

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:13.680 
that come are left outside will smell
this<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.400> then<00:02:12.550> go<00:02:12.760> realize<00:02:13.150> that's<00:02:13.360> a<00:02:13.540> good

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
this and then go realize that's a good

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.890 
this and then go realize that's a good
place<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:14.080> bees<00:02:14.200> to<00:02:14.320> be<00:02:14.440> and<00:02:14.700> go<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.850> and<00:02:16.030> start

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
place for bees to be and go in and start

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.070 
place for bees to be and go in and start
hanging<00:02:17.680> out<00:02:17.770> there<00:02:18.360> okay<00:02:19.360> so<00:02:19.420> here<00:02:19.750> I<00:02:19.780> rigged

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:20.080 
hanging out there okay so here I rigged

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.270 
hanging out there okay so here I rigged
up<00:02:20.170> this<00:02:20.350> comb<00:02:20.680> thing<00:02:20.950> it<00:02:21.070> looks<00:02:21.220> like

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
up this comb thing it looks like

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.890 
up this comb thing it looks like
something<00:02:21.730> out<00:02:21.820> of<00:02:21.880> The<00:02:22.030> Wizard<00:02:22.300> of<00:02:22.390> Oz<00:02:22.510> and

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
something out of The Wizard of Oz and

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:24.540 
something out of The Wizard of Oz and
the<00:02:23.290> bees<00:02:23.440> are<00:02:23.620> supposed<00:02:23.860> to<00:02:23.920> be<00:02:24.010> able<00:02:24.100> to<00:02:24.220> fly

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
the bees are supposed to be able to fly

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.250 
the bees are supposed to be able to fly
out<00:02:24.790> of<00:02:24.850> the<00:02:25.150> cavity<00:02:25.450> but<00:02:25.660> not<00:02:25.840> be<00:02:26.020> able<00:02:26.170> to

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
out of the cavity but not be able to

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.770 
out of the cavity but not be able to
find<00:02:26.470> their<00:02:26.620> way<00:02:26.680> back<00:02:26.709> in<00:02:27.190> as<00:02:28.030> you<00:02:28.209> can<00:02:28.360> see

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
find their way back in as you can see

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.510 
find their way back in as you can see
here<00:02:29.020> they're<00:02:29.230> pouring<00:02:29.920> out<00:02:30.010> of<00:02:30.040> the<00:02:30.160> very<00:02:30.310> tip

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.520 
here they're pouring out of the very tip

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.490 
here they're pouring out of the very tip
of<00:02:30.550> it<00:02:30.730> there's<00:02:31.000> drones<00:02:31.300> and<00:02:31.570> workers<00:02:31.930> coming

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
of it there's drones and workers coming

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.199 
of it there's drones and workers coming
right<00:02:32.709> out<00:02:32.740> there<00:02:33.070> and<00:02:33.670> they're<00:02:33.910> having<00:02:34.120> an

00:02:34.199 --> 00:02:34.209 
right out there and they're having an

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.270 
right out there and they're having an
easy<00:02:34.930> time<00:02:35.050> getting<00:02:35.200> out<00:02:35.590> but<00:02:36.070> they're<00:02:36.250> not

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
easy time getting out but they're not

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.070 
easy time getting out but they're not
going<00:02:36.700> into<00:02:36.850> the<00:02:37.000> nucleus<00:02:37.390> box<00:02:37.660> which<00:02:37.930> is<00:02:38.050> a

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
going into the nucleus box which is a

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.009 
going into the nucleus box which is a
bit<00:02:38.260> of<00:02:38.320> a<00:02:38.380> problem<00:02:38.560> so<00:02:39.450> we'll<00:02:40.450> see<00:02:40.630> what<00:02:40.780> I<00:02:40.810> can

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
bit of a problem so we'll see what I can

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:43.140 
bit of a problem so we'll see what I can
do<00:02:41.140> well<00:02:41.350> I<00:02:41.380> thought<00:02:41.620> this<00:02:41.830> cone<00:02:42.310> solution<00:02:42.970> was

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
do well I thought this cone solution was

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.460 
do well I thought this cone solution was
going<00:02:43.330> to<00:02:43.390> be<00:02:43.480> a<00:02:43.510> great<00:02:43.810> idea<00:02:43.840> but

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
going to be a great idea but

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.199 
going to be a great idea but
unfortunately<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.430> bees<00:02:45.610> didn't<00:02:45.970> really

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:46.209 
unfortunately the bees didn't really

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:48.240 
unfortunately the bees didn't really
like<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.959> idea<00:02:47.410> of<00:02:47.500> walking<00:02:47.739> up<00:02:47.980> that<00:02:48.100> little

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
like the idea of walking up that little

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.220 
like the idea of walking up that little
ladder<00:02:48.550> into<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> new<00:02:49.060> box<00:02:49.269> and<00:02:49.510> the<00:02:49.989> duct

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.230 
ladder into the new box and the duct

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.170 
ladder into the new box and the duct
tape<00:02:50.440> started<00:02:50.800> coming<00:02:51.010> off<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.310> wall<00:02:51.489> and<00:02:51.940> so

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
tape started coming off the wall and so

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.229 
tape started coming off the wall and so
all<00:02:52.420> in<00:02:52.540> all<00:02:52.660> it<00:02:52.870> wasn't<00:02:53.230> the<00:02:53.500> best<00:02:53.680> solution

00:02:54.229 --> 00:02:54.239 
all in all it wasn't the best solution

00:02:54.239 --> 00:02:59.460 
all in all it wasn't the best solution
so<00:02:55.239> what<00:02:55.390> to<00:02:55.540> do<00:02:57.810> okay<00:02:58.810> so<00:02:58.840> I<00:02:58.989> rigged<00:02:59.230> up<00:02:59.320> a

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
so what to do okay so I rigged up a

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.020 
so what to do okay so I rigged up a
completely<00:02:59.980> different<00:03:00.340> system<00:03:00.489> here<00:03:00.820> with

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
completely different system here with

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.560 
completely different system here with
the<00:03:02.019> same<00:03:02.489> jukeboxes<00:03:03.489> before<00:03:03.940> but<00:03:04.360> with<00:03:04.480> the

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:04.570 
the same jukeboxes before but with the

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:06.180 
the same jukeboxes before but with the
entrance<00:03:04.870> towards<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.500> left<00:03:05.799> side<00:03:05.890> of<00:03:06.130> the

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
entrance towards the left side of the

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:08.610 
entrance towards the left side of the
box<00:03:06.310> as<00:03:06.489> you<00:03:06.580> see<00:03:06.760> it<00:03:06.850> in<00:03:06.940> the<00:03:07.170> movie<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.470> out

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
box as you see it in the movie and out

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.289 
box as you see it in the movie and out
of<00:03:08.680> the<00:03:08.769> back<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.190> built<00:03:10.180> a<00:03:10.830> tube<00:03:12.030> that<00:03:13.030> allows

00:03:13.289 --> 00:03:13.299 
of the back I built a tube that allows

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:15.330 
of the back I built a tube that allows
the<00:03:13.660> beads<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.230> walk<00:03:14.440> out<00:03:14.590> of<00:03:14.620> the<00:03:14.799> old<00:03:14.920> cavity

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the beads to walk out of the old cavity

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.789 
the beads to walk out of the old cavity
in<00:03:15.430> the<00:03:15.519> wall<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.540> up<00:03:16.690> into<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:17.080> back<00:03:17.320> of<00:03:17.590> the

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
in the wall and up into the back of the

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.910 
in the wall and up into the back of the
nuke<00:03:18.730> box<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:19.360> lot<00:03:20.290> of<00:03:20.380> them<00:03:20.470> have<00:03:20.620> been<00:03:20.739> doing

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
nuke box a lot of them have been doing

take some frames out of the nuke box now
and<00:03:25.640> bring<00:03:25.820> them<00:03:25.970> back<00:03:26.000> to<00:03:26.180> my<00:03:26.860> AP<00:03:27.860> which<00:03:28.130> is<00:03:28.250> a

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
and bring them back to my AP which is a

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.670 
and bring them back to my AP which is a
couple<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.700> miles<00:03:28.910> away<00:03:29.320> okay<00:03:30.320> so<00:03:30.380> here<00:03:30.560> we<00:03:30.590> are

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:30.680 
couple of miles away okay so here we are

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.900 
couple of miles away okay so here we are
this<00:03:30.860> is<00:03:30.920> the<00:03:31.010> tube<00:03:31.250> going<00:03:31.430> into<00:03:31.610> the<00:03:31.700> back<00:03:31.880> of

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
this is the tube going into the back of

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.690 
this is the tube going into the back of
the<00:03:32.350> nuke<00:03:33.350> box<00:03:33.560> and<00:03:33.830> I'm<00:03:33.890> gonna<00:03:33.980> just<00:03:34.190> open<00:03:34.430> the

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
the nuke box and I'm gonna just open the

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.180 
the nuke box and I'm gonna just open the
roof<00:03:34.850> of<00:03:35.000> it<00:03:35.060> now<00:03:35.320> open<00:03:36.320> the<00:03:36.380> lid<00:03:36.530> and<00:03:36.740> let<00:03:37.100> you

roof of it now open the lid and let you
see<00:03:38.980> back<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.160> this<00:03:40.280> you<00:03:40.490> can<00:03:40.670> see<00:03:40.850> that

see back for this you can see that

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.260 
see back for this you can see that
there's<00:03:41.210> actually<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:42.130> lot<00:03:43.130> to<00:03:43.280> be<00:03:43.460> hearing<00:03:43.820> I

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:44.270 
there's actually a lot to be hearing I

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:48.620 
there's actually a lot to be hearing I
can<00:03:45.200> open<00:03:45.440> this<00:03:45.530> up

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.010 

frame<00:03:49.050> at<00:03:49.260> a<00:03:49.320> time<00:03:50.480> we<00:03:51.480> are<00:03:51.600> there's<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:51.840> bees

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:52.020 
frame at a time we are there's the bees

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.870 
frame at a time we are there's the bees
in<00:03:52.170> the<00:03:52.230> Box<00:03:52.380> opposite<00:03:52.770> crown<00:03:53.100> full<00:03:53.370> so<00:03:53.790> I'm

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
in the Box opposite crown full so I'm

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.700 
in the Box opposite crown full so I'm
going<00:03:54.000> to<00:03:54.030> take<00:03:54.200> several<00:03:55.200> of<00:03:55.350> these<00:03:55.440> frames

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:55.710 
going to take several of these frames

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:58.610 
going to take several of these frames
away<00:03:55.950> yeah<00:03:56.960> try<00:03:57.960> and<00:03:58.080> establish<00:03:58.200> from

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
away yeah try and establish from

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.890 
away yeah try and establish from
somewhere<00:03:58.890> else<00:03:59.420> so<00:04:00.420> that's<00:04:00.510> going<00:04:00.720> to<00:04:00.780> be<00:04:00.870> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
somewhere else so that's going to be a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:04.440 
somewhere else so that's going to be a
little<00:04:01.050> tricky

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.930 

so<00:04:04.990> there's<00:04:05.170> the

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
so there's the

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.190 
so there's the
the<00:04:07.180> frame<00:04:07.360> that<00:04:07.450> I've<00:04:07.570> just<00:04:07.750> removed<00:04:08.050> from

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:08.200 
the frame that I've just removed from

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:11.910 
the frame that I've just removed from
absolutely<00:04:09.160> practical<00:04:09.910> reason

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:11.920

and establish as a new colony or that's

and establish as a new colony or that's
going<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:42.920> prove<00:04:43.070> difficult<00:04:43.310> unless<00:04:43.700> I've

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:43.970 
going to prove difficult unless I've

going to prove difficult unless I've
option<00:04:44.360> actually<00:04:44.810> captured<00:04:45.260> the<00:04:45.380> Queen<00:04:45.530> and

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:45.860 
option actually captured the Queen and

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:47.110 
option actually captured the Queen and
it's<00:04:45.980> really<00:04:46.160> unlikely<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.700> that<00:04:46.880> was<00:04:47.000> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
it's really unlikely that that was the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.760 
it's really unlikely that that was the
case<00:04:47.270> she's<00:04:47.600> more<00:04:47.780> than<00:04:47.930> likely<00:04:48.080> back<00:04:48.530> behind

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:48.770 
case she's more than likely back behind

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.030 
case she's more than likely back behind
that<00:04:49.010> chimney<00:04:49.490> still<00:04:49.730> laying<00:04:49.970> eggs<00:04:50.650> so<00:04:51.650> what

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.040 
that chimney still laying eggs so what

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.470 
that chimney still laying eggs so what
are<00:04:52.130> my<00:04:52.160> options<00:04:52.250> I<00:04:52.640> could<00:04:52.700> introduce<00:04:52.970> a<00:04:53.240> new

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:53.480 
are my options I could introduce a new

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.080 
are my options I could introduce a new
queen<00:04:53.750> to<00:04:53.960> this<00:04:54.110> colony<00:04:54.620> or<00:04:55.160> perhaps<00:04:55.610> I<00:04:55.910> could

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:56.090 
queen to this colony or perhaps I could

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.700 
queen to this colony or perhaps I could
introduce<00:04:56.240> a<00:04:56.540> queen<00:04:56.810> cell<00:04:57.140> which<00:04:57.410> I've<00:04:57.560> read

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:57.710 
introduce a queen cell which I've read

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:59.650 
introduce a queen cell which I've read
is<00:04:57.860> actually<00:04:58.370> raising<00:04:58.850> another<00:04:59.210> high<00:04:59.480> and

00:04:59.650 --> 00:04:59.660 
is actually raising another high and

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:02.110 
is actually raising another high and
back<00:04:59.810> at<00:05:00.020> my<00:05:00.170> house<00:05:00.710> here<00:05:01.670> is<00:05:01.820> some<00:05:02.000> examples

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
back at my house here is some examples

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:03.700 
back at my house here is some examples
of<00:05:02.450> Queen<00:05:02.630> cells<00:05:02.900> they<00:05:03.080> look<00:05:03.200> like<00:05:03.290> peanuts

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:03.710 
of Queen cells they look like peanuts

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:05.500 
of Queen cells they look like peanuts
and<00:05:04.010> each<00:05:04.160> one<00:05:04.310> of<00:05:04.400> those<00:05:04.460> contains<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:05.060> virgin

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.510 
and each one of those contains a virgin

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.750 
and each one of those contains a virgin
queen<00:05:05.780> of<00:05:06.590> course<00:05:06.770> the<00:05:06.950> third<00:05:07.220> option<00:05:07.430> that<00:05:07.550> is

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:07.760 
queen of course the third option that is

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.240 
queen of course the third option that is
to<00:05:07.850> just<00:05:07.880> give<00:05:08.210> the<00:05:08.780> colony<00:05:09.470> here<00:05:09.680> just<00:05:10.190> a

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
to just give the colony here just a

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.580 
to just give the colony here just a
frame<00:05:10.550> of<00:05:10.760> eggs<00:05:11.240> or<00:05:11.600> very<00:05:11.840> young<00:05:12.020> larvae<00:05:12.440> and

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
frame of eggs or very young larvae and

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:14.320 
frame of eggs or very young larvae and
then<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.130> particular<00:05:13.400> colony<00:05:13.880> will<00:05:14.000> be<00:05:14.120> able

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:14.330 
then this particular colony will be able

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:15.820 
then this particular colony will be able
to<00:05:14.390> make<00:05:14.540> their<00:05:14.720> own<00:05:14.750> queen<00:05:15.140> from<00:05:15.410> that<00:05:15.590> it'll

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:15.830 
to make their own queen from that it'll

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:17.380
