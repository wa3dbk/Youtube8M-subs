00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
with these string Christmas trees I just

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.229 
with these string Christmas trees I just
took<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.410> foam<00:01:01.770> cone<00:01:02.160> and<00:01:02.430> just<00:01:02.760> stuck<00:01:03.000> some

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
took a foam cone and just stuck some

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:05.060 
took a foam cone and just stuck some
little<00:01:03.510> pins<00:01:03.780> all<00:01:04.080> over<00:01:04.410> it<00:01:04.500> so<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.920> wool

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
little pins all over it so the wool

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.440 
little pins all over it so the wool
would<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.369> something<00:01:05.610> to<00:01:05.850> sit<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.360> one

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
would have something to sit on and one

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:08.719 
would have something to sit on and one
just<00:01:06.660> slide<00:01:06.869> straight<00:01:07.140> off<00:01:07.410> I<00:01:07.619> then<00:01:08.280> took<00:01:08.550> a

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
just slide straight off I then took a

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.760 
just slide straight off I then took a
length<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.270> wall<00:01:09.390> and<00:01:09.659> I<00:01:10.110> decided<00:01:10.470> to<00:01:10.650> use

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
length of wall and I decided to use

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.770 
length of wall and I decided to use
white<00:01:11.040> wall<00:01:11.280> and<00:01:11.550> then<00:01:12.060> mix<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.420> with<00:01:12.570> some

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
white wall and then mix it with some

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.840 
white wall and then mix it with some
glue<00:01:12.960> and<00:01:13.259> water<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:13.680> make<00:01:13.800> a<00:01:13.830> paste<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.640> then

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
glue and water to make a paste and then

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.760 
glue and water to make a paste and then
took<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.270> wall<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.690> began<00:01:15.900> wrapping<00:01:16.650> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
took the wall and began wrapping it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.370 
took the wall and began wrapping it
around<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:17.280> tree<00:01:17.610> now<00:01:17.940> there's<00:01:18.180> no<00:01:18.360> right<00:01:19.140> or

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
around the tree now there's no right or

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
around the tree now there's no right or
wrong<00:01:19.410> way<00:01:19.590> to<00:01:19.770> do<00:01:20.070> this<00:01:20.220> just<00:01:20.520> go<00:01:20.640> crazy<00:01:20.910> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
wrong way to do this just go crazy and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.880 
wrong way to do this just go crazy and
do<00:01:21.360> all<00:01:21.570> different<00:01:21.899> kinds<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> patterns<00:01:22.680> and

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
do all different kinds of patterns and

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.980 
do all different kinds of patterns and
Criss<00:01:23.130> crosses<00:01:23.580> and<00:01:23.759> whatever<00:01:23.910> you<00:01:24.240> want

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:29.960 

once<00:01:28.680> I<00:01:28.830> was<00:01:28.979> happy<00:01:29.220> with<00:01:29.400> how<00:01:29.580> the<00:01:29.640> tree

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
once I was happy with how the tree

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.260 
once I was happy with how the tree
looked<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.420> just<00:01:30.750> set<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> aside<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.500> dry<00:01:32.270> once

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
looked I just set it aside to dry once

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450 
looked I just set it aside to dry once
the<00:01:33.479> tree<00:01:33.720> is<00:01:33.750> dry<00:01:34.110> I<00:01:34.320> just<00:01:34.650> removed<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.280> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
the tree is dry I just removed all the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.399 
the tree is dry I just removed all the
pins<00:01:35.670> from<00:01:35.970> the<00:01:36.150> cone<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.750> just<00:01:37.170> carefully

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
pins from the cone and just carefully

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:40.100 
pins from the cone and just carefully
removed<00:01:38.010> it<00:01:38.280> now<00:01:39.210> it's<00:01:39.390> time<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.720> decorate<00:01:39.930> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
removed it now it's time to decorate the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.719 
removed it now it's time to decorate the
tree<00:01:40.470> you<00:01:40.619> can<00:01:40.770> leave<00:01:40.890> it<00:01:41.009> plain<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.400> you<00:01:41.490> want

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729 
tree you can leave it plain if you want

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.480 
tree you can leave it plain if you want
but<00:01:42.150> I<00:01:42.420> wanted<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:43.110> use<00:01:43.440> these<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:44.070> pearls

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
but I wanted to use these little pearls

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.969 
but I wanted to use these little pearls
that<00:01:44.790> I<00:01:44.820> got<00:01:45.119> from<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.450> craft<00:01:45.840> store<00:01:45.990> and<00:01:46.409> I<00:01:46.950> just

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
that I got from a craft store and I just

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.830 
that I got from a craft store and I just
glue<00:01:47.340> these<00:01:47.520> on<00:01:47.580> using<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.210> hot<00:01:48.390> glue<00:01:48.420> gun<00:01:48.810> and

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
glue these on using a hot glue gun and

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.899 
glue these on using a hot glue gun and
some<00:01:49.229> tweezers<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:49.979> wouldn't<00:01:50.250> burn<00:01:50.430> myself

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
some tweezers so I wouldn't burn myself

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.980 
some tweezers so I wouldn't burn myself
I<00:01:52.340> love<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.490> these<00:01:53.640> trees<00:01:54.060> turned<00:01:54.390> out<00:01:54.630> and<00:01:54.899> I

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
I love how these trees turned out and I

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.300 
I love how these trees turned out and I
think<00:01:55.170> I'm<00:01:55.259> going<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.440> do<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> few<00:01:55.860> more<00:01:56.040> in

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
think I'm going to do a few more in

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.219 
think I'm going to do a few more in
maybe<00:01:56.520> different<00:01:56.820> colors<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:57.570> maybe<00:01:57.810> even

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
maybe different colors and maybe even

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.690 
maybe different colors and maybe even
different<00:01:58.409> size<00:01:58.740> cones<00:01:59.130> because<00:01:59.430> I<00:01:59.640> think

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
different size cones because I think

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.370 
different size cones because I think
they'd<00:02:00.030> look<00:02:00.270> really<00:02:00.690> cool<00:02:00.840> sitting<00:02:01.229> together

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
they'd look really cool sitting together

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.130 
they'd look really cool sitting together
on<00:02:01.770> a<00:02:01.800> shelf

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:08.219 

now<00:02:05.890> these<00:02:06.040> super<00:02:06.670> sparkly<00:02:07.150> pinecones<00:02:08.080> are

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
now these super sparkly pinecones are

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.859 
now these super sparkly pinecones are
really<00:02:08.740> easy<00:02:08.920> to<00:02:09.250> make<00:02:09.460> so<00:02:09.850> I<00:02:10.119> just<00:02:10.360> begun<00:02:10.630> by

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
really easy to make so I just begun by

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:14.130 
really easy to make so I just begun by
taking<00:02:11.500> a<00:02:11.740> normal<00:02:12.130> pinecone<00:02:12.820> and<00:02:13.120> some<00:02:13.720> silver

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
taking a normal pinecone and some silver

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.050 
taking a normal pinecone and some silver
spray<00:02:14.440> paint<00:02:14.470> I'm<00:02:14.950> just<00:02:15.190> going<00:02:15.340> to<00:02:15.370> coat<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
spray paint I'm just going to coat the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.510 
spray paint I'm just going to coat the
entire<00:02:16.090> pinecone<00:02:17.050> in<00:02:17.080> spray<00:02:17.530> paint<00:02:17.560> then

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:18.520 
entire pinecone in spray paint then

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.950 
entire pinecone in spray paint then
while<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.880> spray<00:02:19.090> paints<00:02:19.420> still<00:02:19.660> wet

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 
while the spray paints still wet

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:22.350 
while the spray paints still wet
I<00:02:20.140> took<00:02:20.230> some<00:02:20.800> silver<00:02:21.430> chunky<00:02:21.820> glitter<00:02:22.030> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
I took some silver chunky glitter and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:24.840 
I took some silver chunky glitter and
just<00:02:22.780> cover<00:02:22.960> the<00:02:23.260> entire<00:02:23.860> pinecone<00:02:24.580> in

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:24.850 
just cover the entire pinecone in

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:27.720 
just cover the entire pinecone in
glitter<00:02:25.830> so<00:02:26.830> that's<00:02:27.010> how<00:02:27.190> simple<00:02:27.220> these<00:02:27.700> are

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
glitter so that's how simple these are

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:29.550 
glitter so that's how simple these are
to<00:02:28.090> make<00:02:28.270> you<00:02:28.540> can<00:02:28.690> make<00:02:28.870> them<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.170> heaps<00:02:29.410> of

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
to make you can make them in heaps of

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.890 
to make you can make them in heaps of
different<00:02:29.650> colors<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.430> went<00:02:30.910> for<00:02:31.090> red<00:02:31.300> gold<00:02:31.690> and

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:03.280 
out so I just begun by taking a material

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:06.479 
out so I just begun by taking a material
doily<00:03:03.760> and<00:03:03.790> a<00:03:04.360> small<00:03:04.870> glass<00:03:05.200> bowl<00:03:05.530> and<00:03:05.769> I<00:03:06.280> just

covered<00:03:06.760> the<00:03:06.849> bowl<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.300> plastic<00:03:07.900> now<00:03:08.890> taking

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
covered the bowl in plastic now taking

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.860 
covered the bowl in plastic now taking
the<00:03:09.280> doily<00:03:09.610> I<00:03:09.640> just<00:03:09.940> mixed<00:03:10.239> it<00:03:10.330> in<00:03:10.420> a<00:03:10.450> glue<00:03:10.840> and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
the doily I just mixed it in a glue and

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:14.160 
the doily I just mixed it in a glue and
water<00:03:11.319> paste<00:03:11.799> and<00:03:12.190> then<00:03:12.629> ringed<00:03:13.629> it<00:03:13.750> out<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.080> it

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:14.170 
water paste and then ringed it out so it

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.490 
water paste and then ringed it out so it
wasn't<00:03:14.560> too<00:03:14.950> grupe<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:15.760> then<00:03:16.390> I<00:03:16.720> spread<00:03:17.349> out

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
wasn't too grupe and then I spread out

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.660 
wasn't too grupe and then I spread out
the<00:03:17.650> doily<00:03:18.010> over<00:03:18.430> the<00:03:18.700> bottom<00:03:19.569> of<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:20.170> bowl

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the doily over the bottom of the bowl

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.580 
the doily over the bottom of the bowl
then<00:03:21.670> I<00:03:21.700> just<00:03:22.090> place<00:03:22.269> it<00:03:22.299> aside<00:03:22.569> for<00:03:22.780> it<00:03:23.200> to<00:03:23.319> dry

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
then I just place it aside for it to dry

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:25.650 
then I just place it aside for it to dry
and<00:03:23.620> then<00:03:24.129> once<00:03:24.370> it<00:03:24.489> was<00:03:24.519> dry<00:03:24.940> I<00:03:24.970> removed<00:03:25.540> it

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
and then once it was dry I removed it

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:28.170 
and then once it was dry I removed it
from<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> bowl<00:03:26.200> and<00:03:26.440> that<00:03:27.220> is<00:03:27.430> it<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:27.910> how

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:28.180 
from the bowl and that is it that's how

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.000 
from the bowl and that is it that's how
simple<00:03:28.239> these<00:03:28.780> are<00:03:28.989> to<00:03:29.110> make<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.560> I<00:03:29.769> think

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
simple these are to make and I think

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.610 
simple these are to make and I think
they<00:03:30.160> look<00:03:30.400> so<00:03:30.880> amazing<00:03:31.540> with<00:03:31.750> little<00:03:32.410> tiny

started<00:03:51.069> by<00:03:51.190> taking<00:03:51.400> a<00:03:51.760> foam<00:03:52.120> cone<00:03:52.569> and<00:03:52.989> taking

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
started by taking a foam cone and taking

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:55.380 
started by taking a foam cone and taking
some<00:03:53.920> masking<00:03:54.400> tape<00:03:54.430> I'm<00:03:54.819> going<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.060> wrap<00:03:55.239> this

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
some masking tape I'm going to wrap this

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.539 
some masking tape I'm going to wrap this
around<00:03:55.450> the<00:03:55.989> bottom<00:03:56.260> of<00:03:56.440> the<00:03:56.590> cone<00:03:56.799> so<00:03:57.280> that

00:03:57.539 --> 00:03:57.549 
around the bottom of the cone so that

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:00.059 
around the bottom of the cone so that
won't<00:03:57.819> get<00:03:58.090> any<00:03:58.359> paint<00:03:58.690> on<00:03:58.870> it<00:03:59.079> and<00:03:59.230> then<00:03:59.920> going

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:00.069 
won't get any paint on it and then going

00:04:00.069 --> 00:04:02.759 
won't get any paint on it and then going
to<00:04:00.100> take<00:04:00.280> some<00:04:00.639> red<00:04:00.970> paint<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.540> paint<00:04:02.109> the

00:04:02.759 --> 00:04:02.769 
to take some red paint and paint the

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:04.379 
to take some red paint and paint the
cone<00:04:03.069> and<00:04:03.459> it's<00:04:03.670> okay<00:04:03.880> if<00:04:03.910> you<00:04:04.030> go<00:04:04.150> over<00:04:04.299> the

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:04.389 
cone and it's okay if you go over the

00:04:04.389 --> 00:04:06.180 
cone and it's okay if you go over the
masking<00:04:04.750> tape<00:04:04.780> because<00:04:05.319> that<00:04:05.530> part<00:04:05.859> is<00:04:06.040> going

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
masking tape because that part is going

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.039 
masking tape because that part is going
to<00:04:06.250> stay<00:04:06.459> white<00:04:06.760> while<00:04:07.540> the<00:04:07.690> paint<00:04:07.900> is<00:04:07.989> still

00:04:08.039 --> 00:04:08.049 
to stay white while the paint is still

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.349 
to stay white while the paint is still
wet<00:04:08.290> I<00:04:08.680> just<00:04:08.950> sprinkled<00:04:09.459> lots<00:04:09.670> and<00:04:09.940> lots<00:04:10.180> of

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
wet I just sprinkled lots and lots of

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:13.839 
wet I just sprinkled lots and lots of
red<00:04:10.630> glitter<00:04:10.959> onto<00:04:11.260> the<00:04:11.650> cone

00:04:13.839 --> 00:04:13.849 
red glitter onto the cone

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:17.140 
red glitter onto the cone
I<00:04:14.530> then<00:04:15.530> carefully<00:04:16.040> remove<00:04:16.250> the<00:04:16.669> masking<00:04:17.090> tape

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
I then carefully remove the masking tape

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.090 
I then carefully remove the masking tape
from<00:04:17.479> the<00:04:17.720> bottom<00:04:17.989> of<00:04:18.139> the<00:04:18.290> cone<00:04:18.500> I<00:04:20.829> then<00:04:21.829> took

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:22.100 
from the bottom of the cone I then took

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.950 
from the bottom of the cone I then took
some<00:04:22.160> glue<00:04:22.610> and<00:04:22.880> being<00:04:23.360> careful<00:04:23.660> not<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:23.810> apply

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
some glue and being careful not to apply

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:25.719 
some glue and being careful not to apply
too<00:04:24.139> much<00:04:24.350> so<00:04:24.710> it<00:04:24.770> doesn't<00:04:24.979> go<00:04:25.040> all<00:04:25.070> gluggy

00:04:25.719 --> 00:04:25.729 
too much so it doesn't go all gluggy

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:27.670 
too much so it doesn't go all gluggy
I<00:04:25.910> applied<00:04:26.600> some<00:04:26.630> to<00:04:26.960> the<00:04:27.050> bottom<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.350> the<00:04:27.470> cone

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680
