00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
gotten that far so we can set that aside

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.830 
gotten that far so we can set that aside
for<00:03:28.140> just<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.739> moment<00:03:28.860> we<00:03:29.760> will<00:03:29.790> take<00:03:30.180> our<00:03:30.390> four

we'll<00:03:38.280> go<00:03:38.400> ahead<00:03:38.549> and<00:03:39.769> just<00:03:40.769> doing<00:03:40.920> both<00:03:41.220> sides

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:41.549 
we'll go ahead and just doing both sides

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:44.479 
we'll go ahead and just doing both sides
of<00:03:41.730> it<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.330> then<00:03:43.290> once<00:03:43.500> again<00:03:43.830> I'm<00:03:44.100> just<00:03:44.280> going

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:44.489 
of it and then once again I'm just going

00:03:44.489 --> 00:03:52.789 
of it and then once again I'm just going
to<00:03:44.519> go<00:03:44.670> ahead<00:03:44.760> and<00:03:46.010> put<00:03:47.010> adhesive<00:03:47.130> on<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:51.799> in

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
to go ahead and put adhesive on it in

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:54.710 
to go ahead and put adhesive on it in
the<00:03:52.860> middle<00:03:53.220> and<00:03:53.489> so<00:03:54.150> it<00:03:54.209> would<00:03:54.330> come<00:03:54.510> around

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
the middle and so it would come around

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.199 
the middle and so it would come around
to<00:03:54.930> the<00:03:55.049> front<00:03:55.230> now<00:03:55.590> on<00:03:56.250> this<00:03:56.459> piece<00:03:56.790> here<00:03:57.060> what

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.670 
to the front now on this piece here what
I'm<00:03:57.330> going<00:03:57.600> to<00:03:57.840> use<00:03:58.019> somewhere<00:03:58.410> under<00:03:58.650> here

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:08.820 
good bit of this with adhesive and I

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:11.030 
good bit of this with adhesive and I
tried<00:05:09.180> to<00:05:09.330> make<00:05:09.360> sure<00:05:09.690> that<00:05:09.930> all<00:05:10.170> the<00:05:10.680> pressure

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
tried to make sure that all the pressure

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.400 
tried to make sure that all the pressure
points<00:05:11.550> were<00:05:11.700> covered<00:05:12.060> with<00:05:12.090> adhesive<00:05:15.410> well

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:16.410 
points were covered with adhesive well

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:18.050 
points were covered with adhesive well
we'll<00:05:16.650> deal<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:16.830> that<00:05:16.950> in<00:05:17.160> a<00:05:17.190> minute<00:05:17.340> the

we'll deal with that in a minute the

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:19.250 
we'll deal with that in a minute the
little<00:05:18.300> center<00:05:18.570> from<00:05:18.750> the<00:05:18.870> hole<00:05:19.020> that<00:05:19.140> I

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:19.260 
little center from the hole that I
