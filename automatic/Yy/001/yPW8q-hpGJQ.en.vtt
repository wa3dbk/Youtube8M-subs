00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
you have proven your skill a lot of

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.649 
you have proven your skill a lot of
times<00:02:06.430> already<00:02:06.700> so<00:02:07.000> you<00:02:07.330> had<00:02:07.450> many

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:07.659 
times already so you had many

world-first<00:02:08.590> skills<00:02:08.979> so<00:02:09.789> what<00:02:10.629> do<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.810> think

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:11.080 
world-first skills so what do you think

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.899 
world-first skills so what do you think
is<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.200> key<00:02:11.440> to<00:02:11.620> your<00:02:11.650> success<00:02:11.980> as<00:02:12.459> a<00:02:12.580> builder

00:02:12.899 --> 00:02:12.909 
is a key to your success as a builder

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:14.610 
is a key to your success as a builder
it's<00:02:13.060> a<00:02:13.150> friendship<00:02:13.599> or<00:02:13.989> just<00:02:14.470> good

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:14.620 
it's a friendship or just good

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.720 
it's a friendship or just good
organization<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.909> is<00:02:16.030> it<00:02:16.150> well

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
organization what is it well

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.030 
organization what is it well
I<00:02:16.819> think<00:02:17.690> the<00:02:17.780> first<00:02:18.260> most<00:02:18.590> important<00:02:19.010> thing

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
I think the first most important thing

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.789 
I think the first most important thing
is<00:02:19.340> how<00:02:19.519> will<00:02:19.700> you<00:02:19.819> organize<00:02:19.970> yourselves<00:02:20.799> if

00:02:21.789 --> 00:02:21.799 
is how will you organize yourselves if

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:23.440 
is how will you organize yourselves if
you<00:02:21.890> compare<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.310> to<00:02:22.430> other<00:02:22.549> games<00:02:22.879> like<00:02:23.060> quake

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
you compare it to other games like quake

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.320 
you compare it to other games like quake
or<00:02:23.870> counter-strike<00:02:24.680> that's<00:02:25.370> really<00:02:25.819> you<00:02:26.299> know

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330 
or counter-strike that's really you know

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.809 
or counter-strike that's really you know
it's<00:02:26.599> it's<00:02:26.959> a<00:02:27.110> small<00:02:27.409> amount<00:02:27.500> of<00:02:27.680> players<00:02:27.950> that

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:28.819 
it's it's a small amount of players that

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:31.990 
it's it's a small amount of players that
requires<00:02:29.720> probably<00:02:30.620> a<00:02:30.709> higher<00:02:30.920> skill<00:02:31.250> cap<00:02:31.489> but

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
requires probably a higher skill cap but

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.900 
requires probably a higher skill cap but
when<00:02:32.120> you're<00:02:32.239> 25<00:02:32.959> 35<00:02:33.650> people<00:02:33.920> you<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.700> to<00:02:34.819> be

you try it so when it comes to live
raiding<00:03:17.420> I<00:03:17.540> mean<00:03:17.690> we<00:03:18.230> wake<00:03:18.440> up<00:03:18.620> early<00:03:19.519> in<00:03:19.549> the

get up when the server starts we're

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.599 
get up when the server starts we're
basically<00:03:24.109> right<00:03:24.380> there<00:03:24.590> trying<00:03:25.069> to<00:03:25.130> get<00:03:25.310> into

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:18.620 
lacking anything but it's a game where

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:19.710 
lacking anything but it's a game where
you're<00:05:18.770> always<00:05:18.950> on<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.280> lookout<00:05:19.640> for

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:19.720 
you're always on the lookout for

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.360 
you're always on the lookout for
exceptional<00:05:20.720> players<00:05:20.990> it's<00:05:21.860> very<00:05:22.190> it's

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
exceptional players it's very it's

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.830 
exceptional players it's very it's
actually<00:05:22.700> very<00:05:22.940> very<00:05:23.240> difficult<00:05:23.419> for<00:05:23.660> us<00:05:23.750> to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
actually very very difficult for us to

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.300 
actually very very difficult for us to
recruit<00:05:24.110> and<00:05:24.380> I<00:05:24.680> think<00:05:24.919> people<00:05:25.130> probably

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
recruit and I think people probably

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.430 
recruit and I think people probably
think<00:05:25.550> oh<00:05:25.730> you<00:05:25.850> know<00:05:26.180> they're<00:05:26.419> Rank<00:05:26.990> 1<00:05:27.050> and

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
think oh you know they're Rank 1 and

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.680 
think oh you know they're Rank 1 and
everybody<00:05:28.430> knows<00:05:28.580> who<00:05:28.730> they<00:05:28.790> are<00:05:28.880> so<00:05:29.360> they

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:29.690 
everybody knows who they are so they

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.060 
everybody knows who they are so they
must<00:05:29.870> have<00:05:29.930> loads<00:05:30.260> of<00:05:30.350> members<00:05:30.650> flooding<00:05:30.950> in

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:31.070 
must have loads of members flooding in

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:33.940 
must have loads of members flooding in
but<00:05:31.340> the<00:05:32.150> reality<00:05:32.600> is<00:05:32.780> that<00:05:32.810> if<00:05:33.260> you're<00:05:33.620> not<00:05:33.650> at

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
but the reality is that if you're not at

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.830 
but the reality is that if you're not at
the<00:05:33.980> same<00:05:34.250> level<00:05:34.280> as<00:05:34.640> everybody<00:05:35.000> else<00:05:35.180> then

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:35.840 
the same level as everybody else then

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:37.600 
the same level as everybody else then
you<00:05:35.960> won't<00:05:36.140> be<00:05:36.230> accepted<00:05:36.830> and<00:05:37.010> it's<00:05:37.220> really

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:37.610 
you won't be accepted and it's really

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:38.950 
you won't be accepted and it's really
hard<00:05:37.820> to<00:05:37.970> find<00:05:38.150> players<00:05:38.419> that<00:05:38.630> will<00:05:38.810> be

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
hard to find players that will be

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:41.200 
hard to find players that will be
accepted<00:05:39.440> by<00:05:39.560> the<00:05:39.620> rest<00:05:39.830> of<00:05:39.980> our<00:05:40.100> guild<00:05:40.640> it's

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:41.210 
accepted by the rest of our guild it's

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.540 
accepted by the rest of our guild it's
those<00:05:41.630> kind<00:05:41.900> of<00:05:41.930> people<00:05:42.140> usually<00:05:43.010> they're

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:43.550 
those kind of people usually they're

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.790 
those kind of people usually they're
very<00:05:44.479> very<00:05:44.570> difficult<00:05:44.780> to<00:05:45.020> find<00:05:45.229> either<00:05:45.500> they

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:45.800 
very very difficult to find either they

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:47.440 
very very difficult to find either they
either<00:05:46.310> we<00:05:46.550> have<00:05:46.669> to<00:05:46.790> go<00:05:46.880> out<00:05:47.090> and<00:05:47.270> look

know<00:05:53.960> top<00:05:54.470> guilds<00:05:54.800> and<00:05:54.979> then<00:05:55.520> they're<00:05:55.669> secure

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060 
know top guilds and then they're secure
