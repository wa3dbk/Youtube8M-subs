00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.170
 hello youtube welcome to 

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:07.220
 a present day fashion show today 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.929
 I ask you the discount to k 97 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.750
 this trailer is about 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.340
 a multifunctional device in which we 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.070
 the possibility have him as a low loader 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.460
 to use and also say as both 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.900
 you see here is already 168 10 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.730
 on it works fine we can 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.019
 look at us with textures beforehand 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:29.099
 but one has information of murder 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:32.149
 of course known from the abo world 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.739
 one would almost say by his study 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:37.950
 mls 13 sits down here with his 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:41.820
 supernodes away yes we have texture 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:43.829
 moderately 1 5 stars word it is never different 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.050
 with him you already know that before 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.879
 you have ever seen that he was great 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:49.110
 and the world will be easy 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:53.489
 quality, too, we have one here 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.000
 top texture and that just makes it 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.010
 fun 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.590
 and yes I would say we give that 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.879
 already the in and look something for 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.320
 possibilities we have the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:06.210
 possibility with shift button so 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:10.140
 shift left and iks here in front of the yes 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.549
 what is it once the grid off 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.229
 make that the nld has in the case 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.490
 probably as a flatbed trailer as reeder 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.439
 stop the wheels that are the 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.350
 Do not tire at the front or the tractors 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:21.060
 Of course, do not roll past for 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.140
 that work that way and that is 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.729
 but in principle the temple for that 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.200
 ballenberg for the bales 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:33.270
 because now the left mouse button 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.570
 We can hold down with with 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.909
 push up the flaps of 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.290
 Start the low loader and drive down 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.000
 until the end 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.380
 I think that's very cool but that 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.790
 Just join in if you would 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:47.399
 just really every deep every height 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.020
 can adjust and thus at uneven 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.000
 terrain or terrain or even at 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.619
 mountains that can be awesome as you like 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.530
 it just needs to go too 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.000
 support is that is very nice that 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.409
 here is from this certain time 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.229
 the support also go up with it 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:03.990
 it is really brilliant lights he has 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.810
 installed the wonderful look blinker 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.950
 Of course ours we know well relapsing 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.539
 you can not test it but that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.610
 also to go out that all one 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.079
 builds i want to say stones 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.760
 We try ours already here 

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:15.920
 a few bales to accentuate stress 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.329
 try on 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.340
 I myself am not the king for that 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.459
 but I like to imagine this one 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:25.109
 Challenge 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 that means we have the changeover room 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:28.680
 every case also like to try 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:29.790
 We stack twice on top of each other 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.379
 have four -test two here 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.579
 disposal 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:36.060
 I would have to say now actually 

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:39.959
 So I have to fit exactly but 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:42.959
 drive in x3 and then the bale 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:45.450
 already question is now if I the 

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:47.370
 Choosing the edge to recognize whether the 

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.049
 be automatic patches or if the 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.549
 as loosely on it as for example 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:57.169
 at 11 11 or 113 so we see 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:57.169
 here in any case that works ever 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:05.849
 The bales are actually now 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.439
 Let it go wonderful says the 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:09.680
 first ball is already on it 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:12.450
 I say get the second one right away 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.680
 look that in turn I believe 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:19.680
 the other side just take us 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:22.739
 to test this one here shortly if that 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:28.199
 because everything really fits perfectly with me 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:30.769
 go once pressed down and the 

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:33.299
 ball is tuned 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:35.669
 By the way, a very nice bonus verdi 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:39.139
 wants to just search for the robert 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:43.379
 Both offer on motors outlook 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:45.019
 because then we try the second one too 

00:03:43.379 --> 00:03:48.470
 to get 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:48.470
 try it 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.319
 yes that's a little ugly me 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.040
 Just wanted to test if that then 

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:58.040
 also stays that way 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.760
 oh well guess which holds now as then 

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:08.670
 Let's try switching off the engine 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:15.930
 okay if you say we do that 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:18.840
 planner for that too, so that's up 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.729
 every turn now I say drive 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.919
 or just around and I see that 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.190
 the bale virtually no 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.190
 move 

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.770
 it's cool friends you can do 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.479
 what you want to become the two 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.440
 automatically disappointed the move 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.240
 not a millimeter 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.350
 Here he can say top again 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.510
 even worker makes tenant 

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:38.580
 Baltic states fun because has a 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.320
 really do not fall down this is real 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.449
 a dream 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:44.070
 maybe it's because try it 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:48.810
 if that is open in the deep nena 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:49.770
 or it must be the same thing first 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.930
 is really a dream 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.310
 five-star fashion by argo da macht 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.530
 even like the start with fun and 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:58.650
 that is also the emphasis for the mod 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:00.450
 that means bombs are part of everyone 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.020
 fall five stars and that's it for me 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.880
 friends 

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:05.990
 we'll see you soon at a latz play 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.990
 it will be good by then
