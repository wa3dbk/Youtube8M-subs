00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
going up top of the cliff I have a

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:07.010 
going up top of the cliff I have a
little<00:00:05.160> tool<00:00:05.370> called<00:00:05.640> a<00:00:05.970> rangefinder<00:00:06.359> with<00:00:06.870> me

00:00:07.010 --> 00:00:07.020 
little tool called a rangefinder with me

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.080 
little tool called a rangefinder with me
which<00:00:07.740> is<00:00:07.799> what<00:00:08.010> hunter<00:00:08.340> use<00:00:08.519> generally<00:00:08.940> to

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
calculate distances so I'm going to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.220 
calculate distances so I'm going to
laser<00:00:11.340> straight<00:00:11.910> from<00:00:12.059> the<00:00:12.179> top<00:00:12.360> down<00:00:12.389> so<00:00:13.110> I'll

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
laser straight from the top down so I'll

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.129 
laser straight from the top down so I'll
get<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.830> pretty<00:00:14.639> precise<00:00:15.120> idea<00:00:15.389> of<00:00:15.690> how<00:00:15.809> big<00:00:15.839> the
