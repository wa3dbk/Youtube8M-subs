 bringing you another video consumption 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.170
 energy and today the people will do the 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:13.469
 sl energy consumption test type 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.770
 x feeling 60 of the brand accent 2 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:19.109
 gigabytes 192 bit right 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:22.289
 good this model that we will think and 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.769
 live.com 993 megahertz on base clock and 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.570
 1.059 hs in the coke mode all right 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.689
 Good, I'll leave you the settings 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.880
 and we will use it and there we go 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.239
 start there computer off with 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.300
 1.6-liter non-volt consumption flap 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:42.420
 Vote by pressing the button on the machine. 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:44.750
 slightly there goes up to 67 votes and 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:47.940
 it stays more or less in this range and even 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.160
 open in the case of the work area until the 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.640
 start windows it will consume one 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.890
 little more than 80 others depending 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:59.160
 of the video card consume over 100 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.050
 a thousand votes is not good is is still going to stay 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.090
 It's basically all the ones I 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.780
 I'm testing so far is getting the 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.670
 track of 40 or another 50 this is the track 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.860
 that is getting in module ii worked out 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.490
 good guys this video card according to 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:17.250
 zotac own right site zotac it 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:20.310
 You need a source of 600 votes to 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.530
 to get it to work 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.450
 see that in the case I'm talking about a 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:29.670
 Solution two right one that consumed 

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:33.210
 190 talbot more or less then a font 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:37.200
 450 watts works perfectly 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:40.590
 on the basis of 14 430 votes in the 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.890
 color case if it has to operate the window 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.250
 of 32 years standing nor to the line of 12 volts 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:50.009
 so she needs 24 foot will work 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:54.899
 quietly already for the sl would need 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:56.520
 of 48 feet then a source of 430 450 already 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.750
 it will not work right 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:02.670
 from 500 600 lots already provides 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.460
 more than 40 pieces on the market with over 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.220
 500 votes is 500 votes already provides more than 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.440
 40 the employee there already operates the sl 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.020
 You see that the plate is 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:18.150
 consuming 300 and a little 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.470
 leh 330 I'm going to use 50 per 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.180
 cent 400 votes 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.710
 They'll keep watching there guys. 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:24.990
 Thank you to everyone who's watching there. 

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:29.090
 that in this new series a and consumption of 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.090
 energy and even more
