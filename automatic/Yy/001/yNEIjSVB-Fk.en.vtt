apartments it also has beautiful parks
schools<00:03:34.519> and<00:03:34.819> its<00:03:35.239> own<00:03:35.359> solar<00:03:35.629> plant<00:03:35.989> on<00:03:36.199> the

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
schools and its own solar plant on the

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.849 
schools and its own solar plant on the
roof<00:03:37.629> ok<00:03:38.629> it<00:03:38.930> looks<00:03:39.139> like<00:03:39.260> my<00:03:39.379> fusion<00:03:39.590> power

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:39.859 
roof ok it looks like my fusion power

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.399 
roof ok it looks like my fusion power
research<00:03:40.280> is<00:03:40.430> complete<00:03:41.049> hi-tech<00:03:42.049> buildings

00:03:42.399 --> 00:03:42.409 
research is complete hi-tech buildings

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.379 
research is complete hi-tech buildings
require<00:03:42.560> a<00:03:42.769> lot<00:03:43.040> more<00:03:43.189> power<00:03:43.430> so<00:03:44.120> I'm<00:03:44.180> going<00:03:44.329> to

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:44.389 
require a lot more power so I'm going to

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.849 
require a lot more power so I'm going to
add<00:03:44.480> a<00:03:44.510> fusion<00:03:44.870> power<00:03:45.049> plant<00:03:45.139> to<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:45.620> city

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
add a fusion power plant to this city

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:48.129 
add a fusion power plant to this city
this<00:03:46.730> is<00:03:46.849> a<00:03:46.879> non<00:03:47.120> polluting<00:03:47.419> power<00:03:47.750> plant

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:48.139 
this is a non polluting power plant

00:03:48.139 --> 00:03:49.330 
this is a non polluting power plant
which<00:03:48.379> outputs<00:03:48.739> a<00:03:48.799> large<00:03:49.010> amount<00:03:49.280> of

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:49.340 
which outputs a large amount of

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.280 
which outputs a large amount of
electricity<00:03:49.750> I'll<00:03:50.750> have<00:03:50.930> more<00:03:51.079> than<00:03:51.230> enough

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
electricity I'll have more than enough

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.439 
electricity I'll have more than enough
electricity<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:52.040> power<00:03:52.159> the<00:03:52.519> city<00:03:52.760> and<00:03:53.299> the

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:53.449 
electricity to power the city and the

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:55.030 
electricity to power the city and the
excess<00:03:53.810> can<00:03:53.989> be<00:03:54.109> sold<00:03:54.319> to<00:03:54.439> other<00:03:54.650> cities<00:03:55.010> in

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
excess can be sold to other cities in

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.640 
excess can be sold to other cities in
the<00:03:55.219> region<00:03:55.599> but<00:03:56.599> first<00:03:56.870> I<00:03:57.109> have<00:03:57.290> to<00:03:57.439> ignite

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 
the region but first I have to ignite

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:59.860 
the region but first I have to ignite
the<00:03:57.799> fusion<00:03:58.129> power<00:03:58.280> plant<00:03:58.449> it<00:03:59.449> takes<00:03:59.629> a<00:03:59.689> lot<00:03:59.840> of

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
the fusion power plant it takes a lot of

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.050 
the fusion power plant it takes a lot of
energy<00:04:00.259> to<00:04:00.349> start<00:04:00.530> a<00:04:00.620> fusion<00:04:00.949> reaction<00:04:01.220> so<00:04:01.970> in

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:02.060 
energy to start a fusion reaction so in

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:03.580 
energy to start a fusion reaction so in
order<00:04:02.180> to<00:04:02.299> jumpstart<00:04:02.900> it<00:04:03.019> I've<00:04:03.169> built<00:04:03.439> it<00:04:03.530> near

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
order to jumpstart it I've built it near

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.189 
order to jumpstart it I've built it near
my<00:04:03.799> oil<00:04:04.009> power<00:04:04.280> plant

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
my oil power plant

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:07.330 
my oil power plant
this<00:04:06.199> will<00:04:06.379> cause<00:04:06.530> a<00:04:06.560> temporary<00:04:06.979> disruption

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
this will cause a temporary disruption

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.520 
this will cause a temporary disruption
in<00:04:07.669> the<00:04:07.729> power<00:04:07.909> flow<00:04:08.150> but<00:04:08.810> it's<00:04:08.930> worth<00:04:09.079> it<00:04:09.319> once

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:09.530 
in the power flow but it's worth it once

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:10.960 
in the power flow but it's worth it once
I<00:04:09.620> get<00:04:09.739> an<00:04:09.829> endless<00:04:10.069> supply<00:04:10.220> of<00:04:10.519> clean<00:04:10.669> power

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
I get an endless supply of clean power

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.960 
I get an endless supply of clean power
