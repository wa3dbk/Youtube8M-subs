00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.610
 per day youtube philipp from ramos here 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.800
 I warmly welcome a new one 

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.110
 in sweden we had to do that 

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:10.190
 really horny for you considering it 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.799
 Do not get bored anymore 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.030
 dry we will do in the back of the honey 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:16.030
 sauce bodybuilding style 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:25.720
 and that's what you need for the recipe 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:26.550
 baking tray alufoil honey salt and 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.869
 lemon juice 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.910
 do not forget to pay your stove 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:32.739
 190 degrees that spares you later 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.650
 wait and take a little one 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.150
 bowl and gives the very ingredients the 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.860
 The bowl started with the honey 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.480
 The recipe could be either with or 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.690
 make two teaspoons of honey 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:46.360
 depending on how much to your recipe 

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:48.190
 wanted to have the then one 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.370
 teaspoon we roll juice one 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:55.300
 teaspoon of lemon juice and a pinch 

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:57.399
 salt betrayed the whole well about between 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:58.570
 You also need 30 and 60 seconds 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.340
 Do not worry that the honey 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:01.950
 someday sticking again for that 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.479
 is then unnecessary during the glory and 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:07.560
 occurs so long until all the a 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.840
 Mass is afterwards with your baking sheet and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.850
 the aluminum foil makes sure that he 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.160
 about twice as much aluminum foil 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.390
 Take as the sheet wide is easy 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.570
 so that you fold it all over later 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.729
 may be due to your chicken 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:26.020
 possibility relative to cut 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:28.110
 on a sheet metal and gives the sauce about it 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.909
 after that, the the email for about 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:33.070
 10 to 15 minutes in call if yours 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:34.780
 similar slightly thicker cut 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.490
 then 15 minutes if it's thinner 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.740
 cut her 10 complete 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.119
 Make sure that you pay close attention 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.560
 also that it is not right here 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.240
 this is left and right 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.330
 wide enough is the spring 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.549
 sauce can not run out of life 

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:56.170
 Ten minutes out, the send turns 

00:01:51.549 --> 00:01:58.990
 once and stroke again practically 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:00.520
 then almost all the rest of the sauce over 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.920
 send a bit for all the time 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:04.780
 end left represents the furnace in 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:07.270
 center out like here is on the 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.170
 plate and again with the 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:13.690
 small right-hander to the left of the 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.400
 eat just send this one again 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 striking taste of these striking 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.829
 honey taste of this soft now 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.870
 really soft to bring out 

00:02:20.829 --> 00:02:24.639
 and a little tip at the very end 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.650
 which is extremely good 

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:27.940
 for example provence herbs in the 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:30.940
 whole both visually and 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:40.510
 give a good note and that is then 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:41.920
 Our final result one that was so 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.500
 again I hope the recipe has 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.200
 you liked turnover prefer watching 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.150

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.739
 clean but delicious too 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.560
 feed and that does not exclude 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:52.760
