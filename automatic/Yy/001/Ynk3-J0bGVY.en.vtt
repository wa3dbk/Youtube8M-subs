science refrigerant oh ye this episode

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.459 
science refrigerant oh ye this episode
is<00:00:11.820> about<00:00:11.849> the<00:00:12.630> Earth's<00:00:12.780> early<00:00:13.440> atmosphere

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:13.469 
is about the Earth's early atmosphere

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:16.849 
is about the Earth's early atmosphere
and<00:00:14.190> the<00:00:14.340> sea<00:00:14.750> there<00:00:15.750> were<00:00:15.900> three<00:00:16.170> stages<00:00:16.500> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
and the sea there were three stages to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:19.340 
and the sea there were three stages to
the<00:00:16.980> Earth's<00:00:17.220> atmosphere<00:00:17.460> in<00:00:18.119> stage<00:00:18.690> 1<00:00:18.960> the

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
the Earth's atmosphere in stage 1 the

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.410 
the Earth's atmosphere in stage 1 the
Earth's<00:00:19.500> surface<00:00:19.830> was<00:00:20.220> molten<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.820> volcanoes

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
Earth's surface was molten and volcanoes

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.630 
Earth's surface was molten and volcanoes
spewed<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.840> carbon<00:00:22.680> dioxide<00:00:23.220> and<00:00:23.400> water

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
spewed out carbon dioxide and water

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.109 
spewed out carbon dioxide and water
vapor

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:26.119 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:28.730 

eventually<00:00:27.119> the<00:00:27.750> temperature<00:00:28.230> dropped<00:00:28.529> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
eventually the temperature dropped and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.980 
eventually the temperature dropped and
the<00:00:28.920> vapor<00:00:29.130> condensed<00:00:29.730> which<00:00:30.060> formed<00:00:30.929> the

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
the vapor condensed which formed the

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:41.869 
the vapor condensed which formed the
Seas

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.880 

in<00:00:42.879> the<00:00:43.149> first<00:00:43.360> stage<00:00:43.629> there<00:00:44.140> was<00:00:44.260> no<00:00:44.469> oxygen

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:44.890 
in the first stage there was no oxygen

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.189 
in the first stage there was no oxygen
whatsoever<00:00:45.699> so<00:00:46.329> don't<00:00:46.539> make<00:00:46.719> that<00:00:46.780> mistake

00:00:47.189 --> 00:00:47.199 
whatsoever so don't make that mistake

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:55.680 
whatsoever so don't make that mistake
and<00:00:47.590> say<00:00:48.250> it<00:00:48.610> was<00:00:49.090> full<00:00:49.329> of<00:00:49.829> oxygen<00:00:53.940> stage<00:00:54.940> 2<00:00:55.420> in

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:55.690 
and say it was full of oxygen stage 2 in

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.560 
and say it was full of oxygen stage 2 in
this<00:00:56.620> stage<00:00:56.890> the<00:00:57.250> co2<00:00:57.550> dissolved<00:00:58.269> into<00:00:58.420> the

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
this stage the co2 dissolved into the

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.450 
this stage the co2 dissolved into the
Seas<00:01:04.049> marine<00:01:05.049> plants<00:01:05.409> evolved<00:01:05.860> they

Seas marine plants evolved they

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.870 
Seas marine plants evolved they
photosynthesize<00:01:06.880> and<00:01:07.860> took<00:01:08.860> in<00:01:09.009> co2<00:01:09.580> and

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:09.880 
photosynthesize and took in co2 and

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.109 
photosynthesize and took in co2 and
produced<00:01:11.310> oxygen<00:01:14.220> when<00:01:15.220> these<00:01:15.369> plants<00:01:15.850> died

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
produced oxygen when these plants died

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.830 
produced oxygen when these plants died
the<00:01:16.660> co2<00:01:17.340> was<00:01:18.340> locked<00:01:18.640> up<00:01:18.850> in<00:01:19.060> the<00:01:19.270> in<00:01:19.479> layers

gas<00:03:21.200> which<00:03:22.190> are<00:03:22.370> trapped<00:03:22.639> in<00:03:22.849> every<00:03:23.209> layer<00:03:23.419> of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
gas which are trapped in every layer of

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:26.680 
gas which are trapped in every layer of
ice<00:03:23.900> every<00:03:24.139> year<00:03:24.739> from<00:03:25.639> this<00:03:25.880> scientists<00:03:26.450> can

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
ice every year from this scientists can

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:29.559 
ice every year from this scientists can
analyze<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:28.430> concentration<00:03:29.209> of<00:03:29.359> carbon

00:03:29.559 --> 00:03:29.569 
analyze the concentration of carbon

00:03:29.569 --> 00:03:32.199 
analyze the concentration of carbon
dioxide<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:30.560> other<00:03:30.680> gases<00:03:31.010> from<00:03:31.970> these

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:32.209 
dioxide and other gases from these

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:37.979 
dioxide and other gases from these
bubbles<00:03:32.630> and<00:03:32.989> how<00:03:33.049> do<00:03:33.560> we<00:03:33.769> know<00:03:33.980> this<00:03:34.690> to<00:03:36.880> 20%

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
bubbles and how do we know this to 20%

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:42.190 
bubbles and how do we know this to 20%
oxygen<00:03:38.989> in<00:03:39.169> the<00:03:39.470> air<00:03:40.389> well<00:03:41.389> there<00:03:41.930> is<00:03:42.079> an

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:42.200 
oxygen in the air well there is an

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.259 
oxygen in the air well there is an
experiment<00:03:42.829> for<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.160> when<00:03:43.849> it's<00:03:44.000> heated

00:03:44.259 --> 00:03:44.269 
experiment for it when it's heated

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:47.199 
experiment for it when it's heated
copper<00:03:45.079> reacts<00:03:45.560> with<00:03:45.739> oxygen<00:03:46.040> in<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.519> air<00:03:46.670> to

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
copper reacts with oxygen in the air to

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.880 
copper reacts with oxygen in the air to
make<00:03:47.360> copper<00:03:47.840> oxide

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
make copper oxide

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:54.880 
make copper oxide
so<00:03:49.550> the<00:03:50.060> reaction<00:03:50.660> uses<00:03:51.200> up<00:03:51.350> oxygen<00:03:53.440> if<00:03:54.440> you

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
so the reaction uses up oxygen if you

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:57.730 
so the reaction uses up oxygen if you
heat<00:03:55.130> copper<00:03:55.970> in<00:03:56.120> a<00:03:56.210> tube<00:03:56.540> and<00:03:56.720> pass<00:03:57.050> air<00:03:57.380> over

00:03:57.730 --> 00:03:57.740 
heat copper in a tube and pass air over

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:00.220 
heat copper in a tube and pass air over
it<00:03:57.860> using<00:03:58.310> two<00:03:58.490> syringes<00:03:58.820> you<00:03:59.750> can<00:03:59.900> use<00:04:00.080> the

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:00.230 
it using two syringes you can use the

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.200 
it using two syringes you can use the
markers<00:04:00.590> on<00:04:00.740> the<00:04:00.860> syringes<00:04:01.370> to<00:04:01.580> tell<00:04:01.880> how<00:04:02.060> much

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.210 
markers on the syringes to tell how much

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:07.090 
markers on the syringes to tell how much
the<00:04:02.450> oxygen<00:04:03.110> has<00:04:03.680> been<00:04:03.710> used<00:04:04.160> up<00:04:05.200> so<00:04:06.200> if<00:04:06.860> we

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:07.100 
the oxygen has been used up so if we

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.060 
the oxygen has been used up so if we
start<00:04:07.430> with<00:04:07.490> 100<00:04:08.420> centimeters<00:04:08.930> cube<00:04:09.200> of<00:04:09.410> air

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
start with 100 centimeters cube of air

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.330 
start with 100 centimeters cube of air
you<00:04:10.400> end<00:04:11.120> up<00:04:11.330> with<00:04:11.630> about<00:04:11.930> 80<00:04:12.860> centimeters

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:13.340 
you end up with about 80 centimeters

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:15.640 
you end up with about 80 centimeters
cubes<00:04:13.970> when<00:04:14.630> the<00:04:14.750> reactions<00:04:15.230> are<00:04:15.350> finished

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:15.650 
cubes when the reactions are finished

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:19.900 
cubes when the reactions are finished
and<00:04:15.890> the<00:04:16.370> air<00:04:16.519> has<00:04:16.760> cooled<00:04:17.170> if<00:04:18.310> 20<00:04:19.310> centimeters

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:19.910 
and the air has cooled if 20 centimeters

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.230 
and the air has cooled if 20 centimeters
cubed<00:04:20.660> of<00:04:20.900> air<00:04:21.260> has<00:04:21.590> gone<00:04:21.859> then<00:04:22.550> around<00:04:22.790> 20

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
cubed of air has gone then around 20

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.500 
cubed of air has gone then around 20
percent<00:04:23.390> of<00:04:23.720> the<00:04:23.870> air<00:04:24.050> must<00:04:24.770> be<00:04:24.890> oxygen<00:04:27.400> well

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:28.510 
percent of the air must be oxygen well

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.560 
percent of the air must be oxygen well

actually<00:04:57.800> I<00:04:58.040> don't<00:04:58.130> think<00:04:58.310> anyone's<00:04:58.850> going<00:04:59.000> to

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
actually I don't think anyone's going to

actually I don't think anyone's going to
put<00:04:59.210> any<00:04:59.390> comments<00:04:59.740> because<00:05:00.740> this<00:05:01.130> is<00:05:01.220> my

put any comments because this is my
first<00:05:01.610> video<00:05:01.820> I'm<00:05:02.419> probably<00:05:02.780> going<00:05:03.080> to<00:05:03.169> get

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:03.410
