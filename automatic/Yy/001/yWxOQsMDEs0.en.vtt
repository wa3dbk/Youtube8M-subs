hours notice how the front kind of kinks

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:40.070 
hours notice how the front kind of kinks

push it back a little bit then it

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.780

morning in the mid to upper 20s and then
Wednesday<00:04:11.400> afternoon<00:04:12.209> we<00:04:12.480> moderate<00:04:12.990> a<00:04:13.050> little

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:13.470 
Wednesday afternoon we moderate a little

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:15.710 
Wednesday afternoon we moderate a little
bit<00:04:13.680> but<00:04:14.160> it<00:04:14.280> will<00:04:14.430> continue<00:04:14.640> to<00:04:15.120> get<00:04:15.300> colder

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
bit but it will continue to get colder

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.840 
bit but it will continue to get colder
after<00:04:15.930> Wednesday<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:16.890> that<00:04:17.070> will<00:04:17.250> lead<00:04:17.459> up<00:04:17.670> to

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:17.850 
after Wednesday and that will lead up to

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.729 
after Wednesday and that will lead up to
the<00:04:17.970> weekend<00:04:18.450> and<00:04:18.660> we<00:04:18.870> have<00:04:19.080> some<00:04:19.260> interesting

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
the weekend and we have some interesting

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:22.190 
the weekend and we have some interesting
stuff<00:04:20.250> happening<00:04:20.670> over<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.060> weekend<00:04:21.480> me

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
stuff happening over the weekend me

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:23.690 
stuff happening over the weekend me
personally<00:04:22.830> I<00:04:22.860> think<00:04:23.040> we<00:04:23.430> do<00:04:23.669> see

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
personally I think we do see

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:26.300 
personally I think we do see
precipitation<00:04:24.620> some<00:04:25.620> of<00:04:25.740> that<00:04:25.830> will<00:04:26.100> be<00:04:26.130> in

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
precipitation some of that will be in

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.210 
precipitation some of that will be in
the<00:04:26.520> form<00:04:26.820> of<00:04:27.030> a

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
the form of a

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.160 
the form of a
wintry<00:04:27.610> mix<00:04:27.940> including<00:04:28.540> the<00:04:28.660> potential<00:04:28.990> for

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:29.170 
wintry mix including the potential for

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:31.380 
wintry mix including the potential for
freezing<00:04:29.650> rain<00:04:30.070> sleet<00:04:30.100> and<00:04:30.700> snow<00:04:30.880> obviously

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:31.390 
freezing rain sleet and snow obviously

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:34.950 
freezing rain sleet and snow obviously
were<00:04:32.320> six<00:04:32.710> days<00:04:32.950> out<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:33.280> a<00:04:33.610> lot<00:04:34.030> as<00:04:34.360> you<00:04:34.840> know

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
were six days out so a lot as you know

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:37.710 
were six days out so a lot as you know
has<00:04:35.170> to<00:04:35.350> be<00:04:35.700> ironed<00:04:36.700> out<00:04:36.790> the<00:04:37.030> fine-scale

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:37.720 
has to be ironed out the fine-scale

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.190 
has to be ironed out the fine-scale
details<00:04:38.440> have<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.890> be<00:04:39.040> refined<00:04:39.940> however<00:04:40.900> as

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:41.200 
details have to be refined however as

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.350 
details have to be refined however as
you<00:04:41.710> will<00:04:41.740> see<00:04:42.100> Monday<00:04:42.850> night<00:04:43.030> and<00:04:43.270> into

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
you will see Monday night and into

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.450 
you will see Monday night and into
Tuesday<00:04:43.540> there's<00:04:44.170> that<00:04:44.380> Jetstream<00:04:44.950> taking<00:04:45.400> a

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:45.460 
Tuesday there's that Jetstream taking a

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:47.220 
Tuesday there's that Jetstream taking a
dip<00:04:45.670> and<00:04:45.850> essentially<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.450> is<00:04:46.510> the<00:04:46.690> strength

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:47.230 
dip and essentially this is the strength

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:49.170 
dip and essentially this is the strength
of<00:04:47.440> the<00:04:47.500> Jetstream<00:04:48.160> and<00:04:48.190> how<00:04:48.370> strong<00:04:48.820> it<00:04:48.850> is

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
of the Jetstream and how strong it is

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.720 
of the Jetstream and how strong it is
and<00:04:49.390> you<00:04:49.930> can<00:04:50.080> see<00:04:50.140> that<00:04:50.560> jet<00:04:50.860> really<00:04:51.250> taking<00:04:51.640> a

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
and you can see that jet really taking a

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:54.450 
and you can see that jet really taking a
dip<00:04:52.000> across<00:04:52.450> the<00:04:52.690> area<00:04:53.020> so<00:04:53.290> that's<00:04:53.920> what<00:04:54.340> the

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
dip across the area so that's what the

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.220 
dip across the area so that's what the
Jetstream<00:04:54.940> is<00:04:55.030> looking<00:04:55.300> like<00:04:55.420> Tuesday<00:04:55.780> night

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
Jetstream is looking like Tuesday night

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:58.500 
Jetstream is looking like Tuesday night
as<00:04:56.500> that<00:04:56.710> front<00:04:56.980> comes<00:04:57.280> in<00:04:57.580> now<00:04:58.060> watch<00:04:58.300> what

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
as that front comes in now watch what

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:00.870 
as that front comes in now watch what
happens<00:04:58.990> on<00:04:59.200> Friday<00:04:59.740> and<00:05:00.100> into<00:05:00.220> Saturday<00:05:00.340> a

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
happens on Friday and into Saturday a

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.140 
happens on Friday and into Saturday a
very<00:05:01.480> large<00:05:02.070> low-pressure<00:05:03.070> system<00:05:03.730> starts<00:05:04.090> to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
very large low-pressure system starts to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:06.390 
very large low-pressure system starts to
develop<00:05:04.510> off<00:05:04.870> the<00:05:05.110> west<00:05:05.320> coast<00:05:05.470> obviously<00:05:06.280> the

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:06.400 
develop off the west coast obviously the

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.400 
develop off the west coast obviously the
timing<00:05:06.850> of<00:05:06.970> this<00:05:07.120> system<00:05:07.570> still<00:05:07.900> has<00:05:07.930> to<00:05:08.260> be

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
timing of this system still has to be

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:10.440 
timing of this system still has to be
refined<00:05:08.830> but<00:05:09.310> it<00:05:09.370> does<00:05:09.580> appear<00:05:09.940> over<00:05:10.360> the

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:10.450 
refined but it does appear over the

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:13.050 
refined but it does appear over the
weekend<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.110> very<00:05:11.680> large<00:05:11.980> low<00:05:12.250> pressure<00:05:12.280> system

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:13.060 
weekend a very large low pressure system

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.240 
weekend a very large low pressure system
will<00:05:13.090> march<00:05:13.510> eastward<00:05:14.140> there<00:05:14.710> you<00:05:14.830> can<00:05:15.010> see

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:15.250 
will march eastward there you can see

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.190 
will march eastward there you can see
the<00:05:15.430> big<00:05:15.640> dip<00:05:15.880> in<00:05:16.000> the<00:05:16.060> Jetstream<00:05:16.390> look<00:05:17.050> at

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:17.200 
the big dip in the Jetstream look at

00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:18.870 
the big dip in the Jetstream look at
that<00:05:17.380> jet<00:05:17.650> stream<00:05:17.770> energy<00:05:18.160> we're<00:05:18.520> talking

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880 
that jet stream energy we're talking

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.320 
that jet stream energy we're talking
over<00:05:19.240> a<00:05:19.770> 150<00:05:20.770> mile<00:05:21.040> an<00:05:21.070> hour<00:05:21.280> sustained<00:05:21.940> winds

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.330 
over a 150 mile an hour sustained winds

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.860 
over a 150 mile an hour sustained winds
in<00:05:22.750> the<00:05:22.870> jet<00:05:23.110> that's<00:05:23.410> about<00:05:24.450> 30,000<00:05:25.450> feet<00:05:25.480> up

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
in the jet that's about 30,000 feet up

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:27.960 
in the jet that's about 30,000 feet up
in<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.080> air<00:05:26.200> and<00:05:26.650> so<00:05:27.190> there<00:05:27.400> is<00:05:27.580> your<00:05:27.700> jet

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
in the air and so there is your jet

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:29.850 
in the air and so there is your jet
stream<00:05:28.270> nosing<00:05:28.900> in<00:05:29.050> now<00:05:29.230> this<00:05:29.380> is<00:05:29.560> going<00:05:29.740> to

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:29.860 
stream nosing in now this is going to

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.770 
stream nosing in now this is going to
create<00:05:30.070> several<00:05:30.520> ripples<00:05:31.150> of<00:05:31.360> low<00:05:31.540> pressure

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:31.780 
create several ripples of low pressure

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:34.620 
create several ripples of low pressure
to<00:05:32.050> move<00:05:32.410> into<00:05:32.680> the<00:05:32.860> area<00:05:33.070> from<00:05:33.970> Saturday

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:34.630 
to move into the area from Saturday

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:36.570 
to move into the area from Saturday
afternoon<00:05:35.440> all<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:35.860> way<00:05:36.130> through<00:05:36.430> about

00:05:36.570 --> 00:05:36.580 
afternoon all the way through about

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:38.790 
afternoon all the way through about
Sunday<00:05:37.240> night<00:05:37.270> and<00:05:37.750> into<00:05:37.840> Monday<00:05:38.050> then<00:05:38.650> the

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:38.800 
Sunday night and into Monday then the

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.980 
Sunday night and into Monday then the
system<00:05:39.250> swings<00:05:39.550> east<00:05:39.850> but<00:05:40.120> look<00:05:40.330> at<00:05:40.480> this

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
system swings east but look at this

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.560 
system swings east but look at this
the<00:05:41.440> jet<00:05:41.710> stream<00:05:41.740> still<00:05:42.490> is<00:05:42.850> in<00:05:43.450> a

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:43.570 
the jet stream still is in a

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:46.050 
the jet stream still is in a
northwesterly<00:05:43.840> to<00:05:44.680> southeasterly<00:05:45.490> pattern

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:46.060 
northwesterly to southeasterly pattern

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:48.719 
northwesterly to southeasterly pattern
that's<00:05:46.300> going<00:05:46.540> to<00:05:46.600> continue<00:05:47.080> to<00:05:47.860> pour<00:05:48.130> in<00:05:48.430> that

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
that's going to continue to pour in that

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:51.000 
that's going to continue to pour in that
cold<00:05:49.120> air<00:05:49.419> so<00:05:49.720> cold<00:05:49.990> air<00:05:50.200> really<00:05:50.440> isn't<00:05:50.680> going

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
cold air so cold air really isn't going

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.520 
cold air so cold air really isn't going
anywhere<00:05:51.400> for<00:05:52.180> the<00:05:52.300> next<00:05:52.570> several<00:05:52.780> days<00:05:52.960> and

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
anywhere for the next several days and

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.010 
anywhere for the next several days and
we're<00:05:53.979> including<00:05:54.280> possibly<00:05:55.210> as<00:05:55.450> long<00:05:55.750> as

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:56.020 
we're including possibly as long as

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.770 
we're including possibly as long as
maybe<00:05:56.380> 14<00:05:57.100> days<00:05:57.460> of<00:05:57.790> cold<00:05:58.000> weather<00:05:58.300> this<00:05:58.540> is

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
maybe 14 days of cold weather this is

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.020 
maybe 14 days of cold weather this is
going<00:05:58.930> to<00:05:58.990> be<00:05:59.140> a<00:05:59.169> prolonged<00:06:00.010> cold<00:06:00.430> snap<00:06:00.760> and

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:01.030 
going to be a prolonged cold snap and

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:02.580 
going to be a prolonged cold snap and
the<00:06:01.390> jet<00:06:01.570> stream<00:06:01.870> really<00:06:02.050> doesn't<00:06:02.560> change

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:02.590 
the jet stream really doesn't change

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:06.300 
the jet stream really doesn't change
much<00:06:03.130> now<00:06:03.490> as<00:06:03.760> we<00:06:04.240> look<00:06:04.390> at<00:06:04.540> Saturday<00:06:04.840> notice<00:06:05.650> 6

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310

much now as we look at Saturday notice 6
o'clock<00:06:06.580> Saturday<00:06:07.210> evening<00:06:07.570> this<00:06:07.690> is

o'clock Saturday evening this is

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.440 
o'clock Saturday evening this is
according<00:06:08.110> to<00:06:08.380> one<00:06:08.590> computer<00:06:09.220> model<00:06:09.400> and<00:06:09.820> this

00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.450 
according to one computer model and this

00:06:10.450 --> 00:06:12.330 
according to one computer model and this
is<00:06:10.630> one<00:06:10.840> that<00:06:10.990> I<00:06:11.080> definitely<00:06:11.590> trust<00:06:11.950> a<00:06:12.130> lot

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:12.340 
is one that I definitely trust a lot

00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.400 
is one that I definitely trust a lot
more<00:06:12.520> often<00:06:12.729> than<00:06:13.090> what<00:06:13.240> we<00:06:13.360> call<00:06:13.600> the<00:06:13.810> GFS

00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:14.410 
more often than what we call the GFS
