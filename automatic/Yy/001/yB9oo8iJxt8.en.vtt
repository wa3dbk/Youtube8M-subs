00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.760
 would like to record in this case 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:59.129
 minecraft in version 1.7 10 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.660
 just click on ok and that's it 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.210
 even for the whole thing too 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.860
 Check once on preview 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.610
 States, I have it right now 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.560
 had started and if you have now 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.770
 means with black screen what now 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.070
 here the case is just once 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:19.259
 open minecraft here in the background and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:22.170
 do not minimize but open obs 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.979
 then it will be displayed to you if you 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.140
 minecraft minimizes then he does not take 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.140
 continue on then you have, so to speak 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.000
 enter screen or your black screen 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.439
 screen because he has not yet brought 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.720
 here comes new signal 

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.570
 and then the screen stays black 

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:45.000
 so once open and in the 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:47.189
 Let the background run so well in life 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.350
 window and then you can control 

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:53.430
 if everything is right if you the biggest 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.280
 is still surrounded here then changes 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.110
