guys very strange object now I know that

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.440 
guys very strange object now I know that
stereo<00:00:42.300> a<00:00:42.629> and<00:00:43.200> B<00:00:43.379> are<00:00:43.590> in<00:00:44.100> different<00:00:44.340> orbits<00:00:44.820> I

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
stereo a and B are in different orbits I

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.040 
stereo a and B are in different orbits I
believe<00:00:45.960> from<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.890> Soho<00:00:47.340> satellites<00:00:48.180> however

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
believe from the Soho satellites however

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.260 
believe from the Soho satellites however
I<00:00:49.350> wanted<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.860> have<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> look<00:00:50.280> at<00:00:50.460> the<00:00:50.610> Soho<00:00:51.000> data

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
I wanted to have a look at the Soho data

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.049 
I wanted to have a look at the Soho data
because<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.140> can<00:00:52.350> use<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> website<00:00:52.890> on<00:00:53.370> soho<00:00:53.670> a

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
because I can use the website on soho a

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.200 
because I can use the website on soho a
lot<00:00:54.270> more<00:00:54.420> easier<00:00:54.980> so<00:00:55.980> i'm<00:00:56.670> going<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.030> show<00:00:57.180> you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
lot more easier so i'm going to show you

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:01.790 
lot more easier so i'm going to show you
the<00:00:58.050> images<00:00:58.500> on<00:00:58.859> let's<00:00:59.489> go<00:00:59.699> c<00:00:59.969> 3<00:01:00.329> and<00:01:00.510> c<00:01:00.600> 2<00:01:00.840> so

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
the images on let's go c 3 and c 2 so

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.229 
the images on let's go c 3 and c 2 so
first<00:01:02.039> off<00:01:02.280> we're<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.579> have<00:01:02.730> a<00:01:02.760> look<00:01:02.879> at<00:01:03.030> the

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
like Venus to me but I find it quite

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.420 
like Venus to me but I find it quite
strange<00:01:42.570> that<00:01:42.780> this<00:01:42.930> is<00:01:43.110> coming<00:01:43.409> in<00:01:43.560> at<00:01:44.280> the

strange that this is coming in at the

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:45.710 
strange that this is coming in at the
same<00:01:44.460> place<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.880> this<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.270> coming<00:01:45.570> in

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
perhaps who knows i'll let you guys

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:52.069 
perhaps who knows i'll let you guys
decide<00:01:49.079> that<00:01:49.350> one<00:01:50.030> so<00:01:51.030> anyway<00:01:51.329> if<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:51.570> look<00:01:51.810> at

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079

the<00:01:52.740> day<00:01:52.950> sir<00:01:53.280> on<00:01:53.750> soho<00:01:54.750> here<00:01:55.229> we<00:01:55.350> can<00:01:55.470> see

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
the day sir on soho here we can see

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:58.179 
the day sir on soho here we can see
venus<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.159> coming<00:01:56.430> into<00:01:56.640> orbit<00:01:57.030> yet<00:01:57.240> again<00:01:57.600> and

00:01:58.179 --> 00:01:58.189 
venus is coming into orbit yet again and

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:00.830 
venus is coming into orbit yet again and
which<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.340> find<00:01:59.549> quite<00:01:59.670> strange<00:02:00.180> but<00:02:00.540> if<00:02:00.659> we

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
which I find quite strange but if we

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.569 
which I find quite strange but if we
step<00:02:01.200> through<00:02:02.360> we<00:02:03.360> can<00:02:03.540> actually<00:02:03.780> see<00:02:04.579> that

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
step through we can actually see that

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:11.710 
step through we can actually see that
there<00:02:05.820> is<00:02:05.850> a<00:02:06.030> bit<00:02:06.390> if<00:02:07.110> we<00:02:07.590> keep<00:02:07.770> going

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.559 

keep<00:02:12.720> going<00:02:13.020> there<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:14.000> then<00:02:15.000> pulling<00:02:15.300> look

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
keep going there is a then pulling look

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:18.110
