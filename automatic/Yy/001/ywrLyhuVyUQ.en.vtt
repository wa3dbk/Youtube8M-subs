make<00:00:23.699> maps<00:00:24.359> key<00:00:24.779> maps<00:00:25.019> and<00:00:25.439> then<00:00:25.619> make<00:00:25.920> your

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
make maps key maps and then make your

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.400 
make maps key maps and then make your
own<00:00:26.220> samples<00:00:26.609> and<00:00:27.210> then<00:00:27.330> load<00:00:27.869> them<00:00:28.050> into<00:00:28.230> the

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
own samples and then load them into the

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:30.710 
own samples and then load them into the
instrument<00:00:28.830> as<00:00:28.949> well<00:00:29.160> there's<00:00:30.000> also<00:00:30.269> now<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720 
instrument as well there's also now the

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.260 
instrument as well there's also now the
ability<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> splitter<00:00:31.740> layer<00:00:32.040> so<00:00:32.940> we<00:00:33.090> made

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
ability to splitter layer so we made

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.479 
ability to splitter layer so we made
some<00:00:33.540> patches<00:00:33.989> in<00:00:34.170> here<00:00:34.410> we<00:00:34.590> can<00:00:34.860> take<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> group

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
some patches in here we can take a group

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.880 
some patches in here we can take a group
of<00:00:35.700> sometimes<00:00:36.239> there's<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> representative<00:00:37.770> of

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
of sometimes there's a representative of

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.850 
of sometimes there's a representative of
a<00:00:38.010> wurlitzer<00:00:38.610> roads<00:00:39.079> stage<00:00:40.079> brand<00:00:40.530> some

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
a wurlitzer roads stage brand some

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.530 
a wurlitzer roads stage brand some
samples<00:00:41.340> that<00:00:41.370> we<00:00:41.550> load<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:41.879> in<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.239> to<00:00:42.329> show

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:42.540 
samples that we load it in just to show

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:44.660 
samples that we load it in just to show
the<00:00:42.750> sample<00:00:43.170> side<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:44.129> then<00:00:44.250> you<00:00:44.370> can<00:00:44.489> put

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
the sample side and then you can put

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.150 
the sample side and then you can put
loops<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.390> you<00:00:46.020> can<00:00:46.170> split<00:00:46.710> and<00:00:46.980> have

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
loops in and you can split and have

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.130 
loops in and you can split and have
loops<00:00:47.399> hope<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:48.059> a<00:00:48.090> pedal<00:00:48.480> on<00:00:48.629> the<00:00:48.660> left<00:00:48.899> side

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
loops hope with a pedal on the left side

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.590 
loops hope with a pedal on the left side
so<00:00:49.920> the<00:00:50.070> pedal<00:00:50.370> do<00:00:50.489> ignore<00:00:50.760> the<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.120> side<00:00:51.390> is

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
so the pedal do ignore the right side is

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.650 
so the pedal do ignore the right side is
what<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.199> jam<00:00:52.770> along<00:00:53.039> with<00:00:53.250> grooves<00:00:53.579> or<00:00:53.940> you

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
what and jam along with grooves or you

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.619 
what and jam along with grooves or you
can<00:00:54.809> do<00:00:55.129> layering<00:00:56.129> as<00:00:56.489> well<00:00:56.699> they<00:00:57.510> have<00:00:57.600> a

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
can do layering as well they have a

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.510 
can do layering as well they have a
unique<00:00:57.930> way<00:00:57.989> of<00:00:58.199> doing<00:00:58.710> this<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.219> you<00:00:59.340> want

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
unique way of doing this so if you want

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.910 
unique way of doing this so if you want
to<00:00:59.579> split<00:00:59.850> go<00:01:00.090> hold<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.390> note<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:01.500> tells<00:01:01.770> you

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
to split go hold a note that tells you

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.470 
to split go hold a note that tells you
the<00:01:02.010> split<00:01:02.280> point<00:01:02.520> to<00:01:02.760> scroll<00:01:03.030> to<00:01:03.210> another

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
the split point to scroll to another

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.719 
the split point to scroll to another
program<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.320> now<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:04.920> instrument<00:01:05.549> has<00:01:05.700> a

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
program and now the instrument has a

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.570 
program and now the instrument has a
split<00:01:06.240> that's<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.720> at<00:01:06.869> that<00:01:06.960> point<00:01:07.229> yeah<00:01:07.590> you

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
split that's it at that point yeah you

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.520 
split that's it at that point yeah you
want<00:01:08.790> to<00:01:08.850> layer<00:01:09.060> your<00:01:09.090> hole<00:01:09.510> to<00:01:09.780> nose<00:01:10.020> and

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
want to layer your hole to nose and

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.780 
want to layer your hole to nose and
scroll<00:01:10.920> to<00:01:10.950> the<00:01:11.159> program<00:01:11.610> you

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
scroll to the program you

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.370 
scroll to the program you
want<00:01:11.910> to<00:01:11.970> layer<00:01:12.120> what<00:01:12.360> makes<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.690> certain<00:01:12.900> kind

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
want to layer what makes a certain kind

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.170 
want to layer what makes a certain kind

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
Waldorf yes exactly and I guess one

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.840 
Waldorf yes exactly and I guess one
thing<00:01:30.060> that<00:01:30.360> I<00:01:30.510> am<00:01:30.780> really<00:01:31.740> noticed<00:01:32.130> with<00:01:32.160> and

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
thing that I am really noticed with and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.910 
thing that I am really noticed with and
I<00:01:32.910> wanted<00:01:33.150> was<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.300> sign<00:01:33.600> yet<00:01:34.170> ma<00:01:34.440> P<00:01:34.620> is<00:01:34.770> now

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
I wanted was the sign yet ma P is now

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.940 
I wanted was the sign yet ma P is now
down<00:01:35.100> to<00:01:35.250> 999<00:01:35.729> that's<00:01:36.240> correct<00:01:36.479> from<00:01:36.950> 1999's

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
down to 999 that's correct from 1999's
