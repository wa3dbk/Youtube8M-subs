00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 welcome to this coffee break day leave 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.790
 that today we share with Carlos 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.380
 credentials director of the sector 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.549
 intel business iberia many 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.170
 thank you carlos for sharing with 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.369
 us this coffee in which we are going to 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.410
 talk about the third generation of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:21.029
 v pro core processors from intel that 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.949
 you just launched and the first thing that 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.359
 raises when a company launches a 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.250
 new generation of products is that the 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:27.900
 difference from the previous one above all that 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.670
 performance that performance improvements 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.619
 you are offering and what applications 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.480
 they will notice if indeed with the 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.940
 output of this new processor the 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.920
 third generation of intel core we have 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.420
 exploited the manufacturing change in 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.129
 a manufacturing process very novel 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.559
 they are 22 nanometers with transistors 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.840
 three-dimensional would perhaps be for the 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.550
 interview we have used as I said 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.289
 to slightly change the architecture 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.550
 and we not only have the process improvement 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.440
 of manufacture but we have 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.910
 incorporated some improvements in the 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.379
 architecture that give us a performance 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.310
 approximately 20 percent 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.350
 superior to its predecessors 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.150
 what is most important with 20% 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.920
 less consumption which allows us 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.990
 open the range of designs as it is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.290
 doing etcetera mainly it 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:11.210
 focuses on multi-threaded applications and 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.590
 multitasking and graphics applications 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.500
 where the largest increase will be noticed 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.370
 where we can have up to 40 per 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.720
 one hundred and fifty percent of 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.430
 increase also in this generation 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.680
 Intel has put a lot of emphasis on the 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.330
 security issue that front are going to 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.790
 shield with these technologies that you have 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:27.830
 introduced apart from the performance that 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:29.930
 we have already seen that it is substantial is not 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.790
 the focus of this release since 

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.380
 we have added so many capabilities 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.560
 around the processor that we 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:38.060
 allow you to make security one of 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.220
 the pillars we think that security 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.350
 with the amount devices that 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.030
 they are propagating each one is going to have 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.530
 different devices the safety of 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.790
 the data is important the security and 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:48.979
 identity is important security 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:50.930
 of the device is important then 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.360
 we have incorporated technologies that are going 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.850
 to allow to attack 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.130
 to malware or antivirus or to 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.570
 virus in a much more effective way 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:03.020
 working below the system 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.460
 operative we have incorporated technologies 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.960
 of identity protection for 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.790
 authenticate the user who is 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:11.180
 accessing some service and we have 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:13.580
 Built -in protection technologies 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.900
 data that will allow us to 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.540
 data at a given time in a 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.980
 device that is stolen or lost 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.510
 can be disabled if you do not have 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:22.459
 access to that data 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.049
 automation and remote management is 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.280
 another of the capacities that have been 

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.540
 introduced in this family of 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.120
 processors how are they going to 

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:32.959
 take advantage if we come pushing the 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.450
 remote management technologies and the 

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:37.340
 web technology pro for some 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.620
 years in this case we have simplified 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.060
 very much what is the implementation to 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:43.010
 when making the provisioning of the 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.269
 hardware the whole solution is a lot 

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:46.250
 simpler we have a buy some 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.690
 improvements in terms of functionality and 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.299
 what we allow is to make a 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.680
 automation would not say complete but 

00:02:50.299 --> 00:02:53.629
 pretty good of all that is a 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:56.299
 fleet management system 

00:02:53.629 --> 00:02:58.790
 we have a major improvement in the 

00:02:56.299 --> 00:03:00.950
 customer service center where 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.139
 we can put virtually a 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.810
 engineer a system specialist 

00:03:03.139 --> 00:03:07.159
 directly connected to the system that 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.340
 has the problem wherever the 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:11.019
 user and the most typical example 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.489
 the worker is traveling with his 

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:14.379
 cover has an airport is 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:15.740
 a problem because you could with your phone 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.730
 mobile 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:21.290
 and synchronize the information with the pc and 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:23.330
 directly transfer the image of your 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.800
 pc to the technician who is attending in the 

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:26.540
 another phone what kind of 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.100
 devices are going to introduce all 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.420
 these improvements and with which manufacturers 

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:30.320
 you are already working to launch 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:32.960
 products to the market 

00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.420
 as I said at the beginning that reduction 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.940
 consumption has allowed us to enter 

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:40.280
 much more efficient designs in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:43.820
 regarding the duration of batteries in 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.470
 how much device size then 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:46.970
 we are seeing a very strong trend 

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:48.980
 by the manufacturers in doing 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:52.100
 innovation in what is design we carry 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.470
 many years with a pc that the image was 

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:56.180
 the same one screen keyboard 

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.070
 we are seeing a lot of innovation in 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.290
 all kinds of device devices 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:01.760
 all-in-one portable exhibitions we have 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.290
 removed the new category of 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.390
 devices that we call it 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.100
 ultrabook where we define the 

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:11.090
 width characteristics that you have to 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.860
 have the weight the quick start the 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.330
 battery life and we are seeing 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.610
 a very strong innovation that we are going to 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:18.890
 have during this year all the 

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.970
 manufacturers are adopting our 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.280
 technology 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.740
 in a very quick way you can comment 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.090
 we some of the most applications 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.860
 in which you are going to take advantage of 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.930
 this kind of capabilities offered by the 

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:31.400
 good third-generation processors 

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.010
 what we are seeing from the entry of 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.110
 these devices in sectors where no 

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.240
 we imagined that we could be 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:41.480
 a few years ago for example in every issue 

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.250
 of digital signage given the 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:44.540
 remote management capabilities as a 

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.600
 very interesting topic when you have a 

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:48.680
 poster displayed in a remote site with 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.320
 the intelligence that we are putting 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:52.700
 we are able to do for example 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:54.680
 recognition of images we know the 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.020
 audience that we have how much time do you spend 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:59.810
 looking at the male 6 audience type 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:01.930
 female the age the interest rate and 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.310
 we can adjust for example that 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.870
 digital signage the message that 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:07.640
 We are giving according to the audience 

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:09.620
 that we are having in real time 

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:11.000
 thank you very much Carlos for telling us how 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.460
 from this third generation of 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.660
 Intel core v pro processors and 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:16.190
 thank you very much also for you 

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:19.450
 share these minutes with us 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:19.450
 until the next coffee break
