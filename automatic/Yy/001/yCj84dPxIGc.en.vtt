00:00:00.439 --> 00:00:02.360 

okay<00:00:01.439> this<00:00:01.680> time<00:00:01.860> we're<00:00:02.070> going<00:00:02.190> to<00:00:02.250> make<00:00:02.310> a

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
okay this time we're going to make a

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.780 
okay this time we're going to make a
snowflake<00:00:02.669> with<00:00:03.240> fivefold<00:00:03.629> symmetry<00:00:04.790> we

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
snowflake with fivefold symmetry we

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.839 
snowflake with fivefold symmetry we
start<00:00:06.060> with<00:00:06.810> a<00:00:06.839> square<00:00:07.280> by<00:00:08.280> folding<00:00:08.790> the

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
start with a square by folding the

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:14.150 
start with a square by folding the
bottom<00:00:09.240> edge<00:00:09.360> up<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.690> the<00:00:09.809> side<00:00:10.050> and<00:00:12.769> being<00:00:13.769> as

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
bottom edge up to the side and being as

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.679 
bottom edge up to the side and being as
accurate<00:00:14.880> as<00:00:15.059> we<00:00:15.240> can<00:00:18.380> find<00:00:19.380> the<00:00:19.500> midpoint<00:00:20.689> by

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
accurate as we can find the midpoint by

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.269 
accurate as we can find the midpoint by
pulling<00:00:22.289> this<00:00:22.650> edge<00:00:22.890> in<00:00:23.220> half<00:00:24.050> and<00:00:25.279> then

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
pulling this edge in half and then

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.950 
pulling this edge in half and then
pinching<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.210> end<00:00:27.800> to<00:00:28.800> highlight<00:00:29.310> it<00:00:29.460> a

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:29.960 
pinching the end to highlight it a

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.410 
pinching the end to highlight it a
little<00:00:30.960> line<00:00:31.170> there<00:00:31.460> this<00:00:32.460> time<00:00:32.489> instead<00:00:33.180> of

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
little line there this time instead of

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.450 
little line there this time instead of
using<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.230> 60-degree<00:00:34.800> angle<00:00:34.950> we're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
using a 60-degree angle we're going to

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.979 
using a 60-degree angle we're going to
use<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.579> 36<00:00:36.210> we<00:00:37.110> bring<00:00:37.380> our<00:00:38.570> intersection<00:00:39.570> point

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
use a 36 we bring our intersection point

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.150 
use a 36 we bring our intersection point
to<00:00:40.110> the<00:00:40.230> midpoint<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.969> we<00:00:41.969> lie<00:00:42.149> it<00:00:42.210> along<00:00:42.600> this

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
to the midpoint and we lie it along this

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:50.209 
to the midpoint and we lie it along this
straight<00:00:44.160> line<00:00:46.280> and<00:00:47.280> now<00:00:48.000> we<00:00:48.059> bring<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:50.010> other

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
straight line and now we bring the other

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.720 
straight line and now we bring the other
half<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.760> this<00:00:50.910> edge<00:00:51.180> all<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.809> way<00:00:51.840> up<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.730> our

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
half of this edge all the way up to our

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:07.250 
half of this edge all the way up to our
other<00:00:54.180> edge<00:01:01.520> and<00:01:02.520> now<00:01:03.320> we<00:01:04.320> fold<00:01:05.570> what<00:01:06.570> we<00:01:06.750> just

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
other edge and now we fold what we just

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:26.890 
other edge and now we fold what we just
made<00:01:07.530> here<00:01:08.040> in<00:01:08.189> half

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:38.630 

and<00:01:27.900> then<00:01:28.020> we<00:01:28.140> fold<00:01:28.350> this<00:01:28.500> last<00:01:28.740> section<00:01:29.100> back

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.460 

and<00:01:40.320> voila<00:01:41.320> we<00:01:41.860> get<00:01:42.070> our<00:01:42.370> wedge<00:01:42.960> so<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.110> cut<00:01:44.320> off

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:44.470 
and voila we get our wedge so we cut off

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:50.070 
and voila we get our wedge so we cut off
the<00:01:44.500> excess<00:01:46.140> and<00:01:47.430> now<00:01:48.430> the<00:01:49.270> fun<00:01:49.510> begins<00:01:49.540> which

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:50.080 
the excess and now the fun begins which

00:01:50.080 --> 00:03:37.940 
the excess and now the fun begins which
is<00:01:50.640> chopping<00:01:51.640> like<00:01:52.210> mad

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:58.650 

ok<00:03:38.950> think<00:03:39.569> we<00:03:40.569> have<00:03:40.810> a<00:03:41.080> winner<00:03:55.650> wha
