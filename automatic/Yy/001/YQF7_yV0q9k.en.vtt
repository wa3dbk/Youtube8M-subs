now<00:00:10.080> I<00:00:10.380> have<00:00:10.920> noticed<00:00:11.280> that<00:00:11.580> I<00:00:11.820> have<00:00:12.450> some

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
now I have noticed that I have some

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.279 
now I have noticed that I have some
friends<00:00:13.219> who<00:00:14.360> really<00:00:15.360> like<00:00:15.540> ice<00:00:15.750> in<00:00:16.080> their

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
friends who really like ice in their

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.529 
friends who really like ice in their
wines<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:16.830> I<00:00:17.010> often<00:00:17.279> catch<00:00:17.699> them<00:00:18.029> and<00:00:18.180> I<00:00:18.270> say

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
wines and I often catch them and I say

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.390 
wines and I often catch them and I say
don't<00:00:18.840> do<00:00:19.080> that<00:00:19.289> don't<00:00:19.710> don't<00:00:20.010> you<00:00:20.310> know

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
don't do that don't don't you know

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.640 
don't do that don't don't you know
because<00:00:20.730> one<00:00:20.880> of<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.090> things<00:00:21.119> that<00:00:21.570> ice<00:00:22.230> does

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
because one of the things that ice does

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.950 
because one of the things that ice does
is<00:00:22.949> if<00:00:23.160> you<00:00:23.250> actually<00:00:23.369> add<00:00:23.670> an<00:00:23.789> ice<00:00:23.910> cube<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.930> a

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
is if you actually add an ice cube to a

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.920 
is if you actually add an ice cube to a
glass<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.769> white<00:00:25.949> wine<00:00:25.980> let's<00:00:26.430> say<00:00:26.779> it<00:00:27.779> will

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
glass of white wine let's say it will

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.720

dilute<00:00:28.230> all<00:00:28.470> the<00:00:28.590> aromas<00:00:28.680> it'll<00:00:29.250> dilute<00:00:29.429> all

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
dilute all the aromas it'll dilute all

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.400 
dilute all the aromas it'll dilute all
the<00:00:29.880> flavors<00:00:30.269> and<00:00:30.300> it<00:00:30.599> will<00:00:30.689> dilute<00:00:31.019> your<00:00:31.170> wine

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410

in a freezer for about a couple of hours

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.130 
in a freezer for about a couple of hours
it'll<00:01:44.850> turn<00:01:45.119> it'll<00:01:45.390> harden<00:01:45.780> and<00:01:45.899> will<00:01:46.020> you

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140
