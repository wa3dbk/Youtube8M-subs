00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.469 
one is rotten that's weird
that<00:04:16.229> is<00:04:16.349> completely<00:04:17.220> unexpected<00:04:17.699> I<00:04:18.090> thought

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
that is completely unexpected I thought

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.029 
that is completely unexpected I thought
it<00:04:18.630> would<00:04:18.750> be<00:04:18.900> worse

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:20.039 
it would be worse

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.900 
it would be worse
I<00:04:20.070> mean<00:04:21.860> kind<00:04:22.860> of<00:04:22.949> messed<00:04:23.250> up<00:04:23.400> this<00:04:23.550> problem

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
I mean kind of messed up this problem

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:29.659 
I mean kind of messed up this problem
this<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.270> really<00:04:25.550> unscientific<00:04:26.550> but<00:04:27.020> I<00:04:28.669> see

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
this is really unscientific but I see

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:32.420 
this is really unscientific but I see
that<00:04:30.030> it<00:04:30.570> feels<00:04:30.870> like<00:04:31.169> they're<00:04:31.830> they<00:04:32.190> don't

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
that it feels like they're they don't

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.830 
that it feels like they're they don't
look<00:04:32.610> really<00:04:33.030> the<00:04:33.150> same<00:04:33.449> it's<00:04:33.870> it's<00:04:34.710> a<00:04:34.860> really

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
look really the same it's it's a really

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:40.870 
look really the same it's it's a really
definitely<00:04:36.840> different<00:04:37.259> kind<00:04:37.620> of<00:04:37.710> bread<00:04:37.979> and

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:52.029 

and<00:04:41.930> it<00:04:42.930> feels<00:04:43.199> different

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:52.039 

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:54.710 

okay<00:04:53.039> I'm<00:04:53.160> gonna<00:04:53.340> finish<00:04:53.789> it<00:04:54.000> off<00:04:54.120> on<00:04:54.660> that

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720
