00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.030 
and in some environments you can barely

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:25.090 
fine but sometimes you can honestly

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.280 
fine but sometimes you can honestly
think<00:02:25.300> that<00:02:25.360> you're<00:02:25.540> out<00:02:25.629> of<00:02:25.660> bullets<00:02:26.170> they

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290
