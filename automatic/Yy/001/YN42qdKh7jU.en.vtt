00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:09.400
 In Tamura City, it is better because the place where you fly and the course you hit are decided 

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.370
 Or likely to play smoothly 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:21.230
 You can pretend Without easy situation 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:26.480
 However, the rally and the game are the situation that does not know where it will fly first and I hit 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:29.310
 Making the play quite smoothly because there is a situation where the course is also not determined clearly 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:35.820
 Will be difficult 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:41.680
 First of all, yes, in order to do a rally with the feeling of a ball out as much as possible 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:46.600
 With early judgment whether ball flying from opponent is fore or bag 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:52.510
 The other course I hit when I found that fore 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:55.810
 It is more by deciding the course to strike straight cross etc. firmly and hitting the ball 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.579
 It feels like a racket dash 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:05.500
 It will be able to carry out even in La 

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:05.500
 Make important decisions and decisions as soon as possible

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:51.870
 It is increased Yes decisiveness with it in the early judgment 

00:01:46.569 --> 00:01:54.470
 I think that I want to the description as an exercise method 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:57.830
 The ball flying from the opponent 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:01.070
 First to fore back as soon as possible 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.580
 Fore that I have done on their own 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.000
 First of all at the moment I understand 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.880
 Please have a solid fan 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.380
 I will shake 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.380
 At first it becomes one of the practice to take an early judgment 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.520
 Then yeah 

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:23.520
 I think that I want to practice to take quickly the course of decision 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:30.569
 Early judgment seat foreback 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:32.640
 The ball Once you make a fast decision 

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:36.170
 Straight cross 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:41.680
 Which is a declaration you will hit the ball from 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:44.800
 The opponent's ball is net as much as possible when the ball comes 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:48.010
 Straight cross already before exceeding 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:54.849
 I'm turning around firmly with the course decided 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:56.280
 You can swing more smoothly by swinging the course in that state 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.490
 I will do it 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:05.620
 As much as possible 

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:05.620
 Let's make the decision of the fore bag and the decision of the course earlier 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:26.959
