tall throughout the mid early game as
well<00:05:00.380> the<00:05:00.620> consistency<00:05:01.400> in<00:05:01.640> lanes<00:05:01.970> but<00:05:02.390> we're

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.170 
well the consistency in lanes but we're

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:05.260 
well the consistency in lanes but we're
seeing<00:05:03.410> that<00:05:03.590> against<00:05:04.580> the<00:05:04.640> team<00:05:04.820> that<00:05:04.850> wants

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
seeing that against the team that wants

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:06.430 
seeing that against the team that wants
to<00:05:05.360> put<00:05:05.510> the<00:05:05.600> pressure<00:05:05.840> on<00:05:05.990> it's<00:05:06.260> the

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
to put the pressure on it's the

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.110 
to put the pressure on it's the
consistency<00:05:06.620> isn't<00:05:07.160> enough<00:05:07.520> you<00:05:07.940> actually

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
consistency isn't enough you actually

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.660 
consistency isn't enough you actually
have<00:05:08.420> to<00:05:08.540> make<00:05:08.690> the<00:05:08.810> moves<00:05:09.020> and<00:05:09.260> not<00:05:10.160> to<00:05:10.430> pick

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:10.670 
have to make the moves and not to pick

00:05:10.670 --> 00:05:13.630 
have to make the moves and not to pick
on<00:05:10.820> Callie<00:05:11.150> because<00:05:11.750> he's<00:05:12.410> done<00:05:12.650> so<00:05:12.890> well<00:05:13.160> but

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:13.640 
on Callie because he's done so well but

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.760 
on Callie because he's done so well but
the<00:05:13.730> Malachi<00:05:14.060> pick<00:05:14.330> wasn't<00:05:15.230> enough<00:05:15.440> power<00:05:15.650> for

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:15.770 
the Malachi pick wasn't enough power for

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:17.170 
the Malachi pick wasn't enough power for
them<00:05:15.980> I<00:05:16.070> think<00:05:16.100> of<00:05:16.340> the<00:05:16.400> top<00:05:16.580> link<00:05:16.790> it<00:05:16.970> works

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
them I think of the top link it works

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.870 
them I think of the top link it works
for<00:05:17.270> a<00:05:17.330> lot<00:05:17.450> of<00:05:17.510> teams<00:05:17.780> but<00:05:17.990> not<00:05:18.170> that<00:05:18.320> style

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.880
