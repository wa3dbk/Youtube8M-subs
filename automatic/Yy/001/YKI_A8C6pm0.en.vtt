00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.980
 the potential for rainfall and a 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840
 intensification of the wind in sonora 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.690
 this because of the cold front 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.670
 number 17 of the season joined this 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.370

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:49.469
 and this system will cause rainfall 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:51.179
 intermittent light to strong 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:52.800
 like wind in intense gusts and 

00:00:51.179 --> 00:00:55.679
 marked decreases in temperature 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.329
 mainly in the north in the center 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.010

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:18.810
