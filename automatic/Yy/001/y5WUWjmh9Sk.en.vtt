that firearm I think salido has trouble

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.090 
that firearm I think salido has trouble
with<00:02:44.850> speed<00:02:45.239> you<00:02:45.690> know<00:02:45.810> but<00:02:46.680> then<00:02:46.950> again

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
with speed you know but then again

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.350 
with speed you know but then again
gamboa<00:02:47.730> has<00:02:48.030> you<00:02:48.510> know<00:02:49.430> speed<00:02:50.430> beyond<00:02:50.790> speed

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
gamboa has you know speed beyond speed

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.509 
gamboa has you know speed beyond speed
you<00:02:51.540> know<00:02:51.660> so<00:02:51.959> anybody<00:02:52.890> will<00:02:53.220> have<00:02:53.310> trouble

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
you know so anybody will have trouble

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.060 
you know so anybody will have trouble
with<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:53.820> kind<00:02:54.150> of<00:02:54.180> speed<00:02:54.560> but<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.620> still<00:02:55.829> feel

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070 
with that kind of speed but I still feel

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.090 
with that kind of speed but I still feel
that<00:02:56.100> you<00:02:56.519> know<00:02:56.640> speed<00:02:56.940> is<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.390> factor<00:02:58.380> that

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
that you know speed is a factor that

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.229 
that you know speed is a factor that
study<00:02:59.459> though<00:02:59.640> has<00:03:00.060> trouble<00:03:00.450> with<00:03:01.130> so<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.519> think

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:03.239 
study though has trouble with so I think

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:04.640 
study though has trouble with so I think
you<00:03:03.570> know<00:03:03.660> those<00:03:03.840> are<00:03:03.959> the<00:03:04.019> things<00:03:04.140> that<00:03:04.260> you

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you know those are the things that you

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:06.460 
you know those are the things that you
know<00:03:04.769> we<00:03:05.370> could<00:03:05.519> probably<00:03:05.640> take<00:03:05.940> advantage<00:03:06.299> of

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:06.470 
know we could probably take advantage of

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.130 
know we could probably take advantage of
now<00:03:07.470> do<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.519> think<00:03:08.579> it's<00:03:08.880> unfair<00:03:09.420> of<00:03:09.750> the

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
now do you think it's unfair of the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.310 
now do you think it's unfair of the
media<00:03:10.470> and<00:03:10.709> most<00:03:11.370> boxing<00:03:11.910> fans<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.540> say<00:03:13.290> that

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.320 
media and most boxing fans that say that

00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.020 
media and most boxing fans that say that
you're<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.709> boring<00:03:14.010> fighter<00:03:14.370> because<00:03:14.700> you're

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
you're a boring fighter because you're

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.270 
you're a boring fighter because you're
patient<00:03:15.209> because<00:03:16.049> if<00:03:16.200> if<00:03:16.500> they<00:03:16.709> look<00:03:16.890> at<00:03:17.070> your

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
patient because if if they look at your

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.900 
patient because if if they look at your
boxrec<00:03:17.760> or<00:03:18.269> your<00:03:18.930> record<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.440> general<00:03:19.980> you
