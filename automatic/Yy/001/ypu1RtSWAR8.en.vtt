 we say almost habitable indeed habitable on the mac 

00:02:43.869 --> 00:02:47.229
 places a lot of light because in these two windows that 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:50.299
 I'm showing the first one

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.669
 overlooks

 if the garden of the lower is precisely at the entrance we have 

00:02:58.999 --> 00:03:01.999

 also the other buying and selling boars 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:18.099
 and this is the whole salon where the beautiful one is in the background 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:21.089
 window that we will see you offers a panorama 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:23.889
 very very pleasant 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:26.509
 pigeon that has the particularity of having 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:28.059
 one side 

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:32.749
 very high I seem to try meditating beyond 5 meters but then level 

00:03:32.749 --> 00:03:35.579
 on the spot black way to deepen 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:37.619
 and those two windows 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.129
 the first 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.579
 it's the second with the balance in colorado 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.309

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.379
 much more 

00:03:49.379 --> 00:03:52.379
 probably a nice study 

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:56.089
 a saloon of the second me 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.089

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.989
 of a really important panorama 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:09.119

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.270
 girl 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.620
 I remember coming from Rome, the ideal 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.620
 it is to make Rome the eagle coming out of Gazzoli 

00:04:28.129 --> 00:04:30.180
 with the arrival directly 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.210
 at this green valley residence 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.210

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:44.189
 clear window

 I always do on the garden 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:49.469
 here it is 

00:04:49.469 --> 00:04:54.019
 and that connects the zanotti card with this important go lido, design +1 here 

00:04:54.019 --> 00:04:57.019

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.319
 or rather the bathroom sorry 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:08.439
 bathroom that definitely 

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:12.659
 common of great of today measures its face 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:16.270
 at the back of the house in the garden 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.909

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:23.210

 there is even a French window that allows you to go out onto the garden 

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:30.860
 so if you don't need 2 rooms 3 rooms 

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:33.860
 here one goes to the studio the hobby room that gives directly 

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:37.189
 on the garden 

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:40.409
 It is clear that I did it here tonight 

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:43.069
 the partition 

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:45.409
 we cook the visit 

00:05:45.409 --> 00:05:48.409
 with the third and last room certainly the brightest 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:50.680
 why at 2 o'clock 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:52.150
 windows 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:55.150
 and the highest because it has 

00:05:55.659 --> 00:05:57.689

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:00.749
 chebba over 5 meters here you can certainly go upstairs 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:05.919
 writing the price you saw it indicated
