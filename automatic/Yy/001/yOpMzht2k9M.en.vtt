00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.470 
make a battery for the MSR a lot of guys
have<00:00:08.189> been<00:00:08.309> talking<00:00:08.490> about<00:00:08.700> the<00:00:09.440> 240<00:00:10.440> milliamp

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:11.480 
have been talking about the 240 milliamp

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.539 
have been talking about the 240 milliamp
Zippy's<00:00:12.480> that<00:00:12.599> are<00:00:12.719> available<00:00:13.549> they're

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549 
Zippy's that are available they're

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.140 
Zippy's that are available they're
rather<00:00:14.730> thin<00:00:15.120> as<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.750> can<00:00:15.870> see<00:00:17.150> they're

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
rather thin as you can see they're

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:26.929 
rather thin as you can see they're
rather<00:00:19.080> light<00:00:22.160> okay<00:00:23.180> just<00:00:24.180> show<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.449> here<00:00:25.939> for

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
rather light okay just show you here for

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.750 
rather light okay just show you here for
what<00:00:27.090> they<00:00:27.240> are<00:00:27.449> that's<00:00:27.840> five<00:00:28.830> point<00:00:29.310> five

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
what they are that's five point five

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.130 
what they are that's five point five
seven<00:00:30.330> three<00:00:30.960> point<00:00:31.289> six<00:00:32.840> so<00:00:33.840> you'll<00:00:34.020> get

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:34.140 
seven three point six so you'll get

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.880 
seven three point six so you'll get
basically<00:00:34.559> double<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.160> capacity<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:36.390> any

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:36.890 
basically double the capacity for any

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.940 
basically double the capacity for any
two<00:00:37.890> grams<00:00:38.219> more<00:00:38.579> in<00:00:38.730> weight<00:00:39.739> you're<00:00:40.739> probably

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
two grams more in weight you're probably

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.580 
two grams more in weight you're probably
saying<00:00:41.250> ah<00:00:41.460> there's<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:42.140> lead<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.219> forth

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
saying ah there's the lead and so forth

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:55.569 
saying ah there's the lead and so forth
well<00:00:46.590> here's<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.760> lead<00:00:50.510> and<00:00:53.570> that<00:00:54.570> weighs

00:00:55.569 --> 00:00:55.579 
well here's the lead and that weighs

00:00:55.579 --> 00:01:00.020 
well here's the lead and that weighs
point<00:00:56.579> one<00:00:56.940> of<00:00:57.090> a<00:00:57.210> gram<00:00:58.550> now<00:00:59.550> you'll<00:00:59.879> need

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
point one of a gram now you'll need

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.090 
point one of a gram now you'll need
yourself<00:01:00.210> some<00:01:00.660> captain<00:01:01.109> tape<00:01:01.829> which<00:01:02.070> is

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
yourself some captain tape which is

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.500 
yourself some captain tape which is
basically<00:01:02.670> high<00:01:02.940> temperature<00:01:03.420> tape<00:01:05.510> its

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
basically high temperature tape its

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:14.230 
basically high temperature tape its
foremost<00:01:08.810> transparent

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:16.490 

okay<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.299> you<00:01:15.570> just<00:01:15.780> basically<00:01:15.930> need<00:01:16.290> your

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
okay so you just basically need your

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.310 
okay so you just basically need your
soldering<00:01:16.830> iron<00:01:17.180> and<00:01:20.060> battery<00:01:21.060> so<00:01:21.330> first

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
soldering iron and battery so first

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.530 
soldering iron and battery so first
thing<00:01:22.470> you<00:01:22.560> need<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.740> do<00:01:23.009> is<00:01:23.220> strip<00:01:24.000> back<00:01:24.210> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
thing you need to do is strip back the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.710 
thing you need to do is strip back the
leads<00:01:25.470> a<00:01:25.680> little<00:01:25.920> bit<00:01:26.040> basically<00:01:27.030> twist<00:01:27.509> the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
leads a little bit basically twist the

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
leads a little bit basically twist the
wires<00:01:30.530> clean<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.680> soldering<00:01:32.040> iron

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:57.220 

to<00:01:46.340> trim<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:46.729> wires<00:01:46.939> back<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.390> little<00:01:47.689> bit

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:57.230 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.780 

now<00:01:58.230> you'll<00:01:58.440> notice<00:01:58.680> there's<00:01:59.040> a<00:01:59.130> positive<00:01:59.640> and

00:01:59.780 --> 00:01:59.790 
now you'll notice there's a positive and

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.930 
now you'll notice there's a positive and
a<00:01:59.850> negative<00:02:00.560> symbol<00:02:01.560> there's<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.460> positives

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:02.940 
a negative symbol there's the positives

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:06.500 
a negative symbol there's the positives
on<00:02:03.240> this<00:02:03.720> side<00:02:04.460> so<00:02:05.460> when<00:02:05.580> you<00:02:05.670> turn<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.000> over

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:06.510 
on this side so when you turn that over

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:27.080 
on this side so when you turn that over
just<00:02:07.020> remember<00:02:07.470> insides<00:02:08.190> positive

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.610 

that<00:02:28.090> basically<00:02:28.450> takes<00:02:28.720> care<00:02:28.900> of<00:02:29.110> that<00:02:29.290> side

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
that basically takes care of that side

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:31.860 
that basically takes care of that side
of<00:02:29.769> it<00:02:29.829> so<00:02:30.069> now<00:02:30.099> you've<00:02:30.430> got<00:02:30.640> your<00:02:30.849> plug<00:02:31.689> which

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
of it so now you've got your plug which

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:35.039 
of it so now you've got your plug which
is<00:02:31.900> soldered<00:02:32.500> on<00:02:33.030> there<00:02:34.030> just<00:02:34.420> make<00:02:34.629> sure<00:02:34.840> that

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:35.049 
is soldered on there just make sure that

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:36.960 
is soldered on there just make sure that
your<00:02:35.230> still<00:02:35.470> got<00:02:35.620> positive<00:02:35.920> a<00:02:36.220> positive<00:02:36.760> and

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
your still got positive a positive and

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.930 
your still got positive a positive and
negative<00:02:37.000> at<00:02:37.390> negative<00:02:38.549> next<00:02:39.549> thing<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.790> do

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:39.940 
negative at negative next thing you do

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.990 
negative at negative next thing you do
is<00:02:39.970> you<00:02:40.299> fold<00:02:40.510> your<00:02:40.659> tabs<00:02:40.959> back<00:02:41.799> over<00:02:42.250> in<00:02:42.459> this

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
is you fold your tabs back over in this

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:52.979 
is you fold your tabs back over in this
fashion<00:02:48.030> push<00:02:49.030> them<00:02:49.209> in<00:02:51.329> so<00:02:52.329> if<00:02:52.569> there's<00:02:52.810> any

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
fashion push them in so if there's any

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:54.720 
fashion push them in so if there's any
excess<00:02:53.409> just<00:02:53.680> fold<00:02:54.010> them<00:02:54.099> all<00:02:54.250> back<00:02:54.430> down

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
excess just fold them all back down

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:00.330 
excess just fold them all back down
again<00:02:55.060> like<00:02:56.400> that<00:02:58.650> so<00:02:59.650> now<00:02:59.799> we<00:02:59.859> just<00:02:59.950> get<00:03:00.250> the

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
again like that so now we just get the

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:54.260 
again like that so now we just get the
kaplan<00:03:00.730> tape<00:03:01.079> we'll<00:03:02.079> have<00:03:02.290> to<00:03:04.680> cut<00:03:05.680> some<00:03:05.950> up

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:54.270 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.380 

I'm<00:03:54.840> now<00:03:55.020> going<00:03:55.170> to<00:03:55.230> run<00:03:55.470> a<00:03:56.150> loop<00:03:57.150> of<00:03:57.270> the

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
I'm now going to run a loop of the

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:20.840 
I'm now going to run a loop of the
Kapton<00:03:57.810> tape<00:03:58.340> across<00:03:59.340> that

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:24.180 

okay

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:29.870 

so<00:04:24.760> it<00:04:24.820> takes<00:04:25.060> care<00:04:25.390> of<00:04:25.420> that<00:04:25.540> across<00:04:26.410> there

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.380 

now<00:04:30.880> I<00:04:31.210> mean<00:04:31.840> that<00:04:32.110> would<00:04:32.740> be<00:04:32.770> fine<00:04:33.160> just<00:04:33.490> like

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:34.390 
now I mean that would be fine just like

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:37.860 
now I mean that would be fine just like
that<00:04:35.820> shouldn't<00:04:36.820> be<00:04:36.970> any<00:04:37.090> dramas<00:04:37.510> at<00:04:37.630> all<00:04:37.720> with

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:37.870 
that shouldn't be any dramas at all with

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.030 
that shouldn't be any dramas at all with
it<00:04:38.070> and<00:04:39.990> that<00:04:40.990> will<00:04:41.200> fit<00:04:41.410> straight<00:04:41.740> into<00:04:41.950> your

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:42.040 
it and that will fit straight into your

00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:45.360 
it and that will fit straight into your
normal<00:04:42.160> charger<00:04:42.760> and<00:04:42.940> charge<00:04:43.840> up<00:04:44.080> now<00:04:45.070> we<00:04:45.190> need

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:45.370 
normal charger and charge up now we need

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:48.300 
normal charger and charge up now we need
some<00:04:45.610> way<00:04:45.790> of<00:04:46.030> securing<00:04:46.630> that<00:04:46.920> to<00:04:47.920> the<00:04:48.040> actual

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
some way of securing that to the actual

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.760 
some way of securing that to the actual
helicopter<00:04:50.040> so<00:04:51.040> my<00:04:51.220> suggestion<00:04:51.670> would<00:04:51.940> be

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:52.770 
helicopter so my suggestion would be

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:54.930 
helicopter so my suggestion would be
across<00:04:53.770> here<00:04:54.130> would<00:04:54.280> put<00:04:54.460> a<00:04:54.490> bit<00:04:54.640> of<00:04:54.670> velcro

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:54.940 
across here would put a bit of velcro

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:58.980 
across here would put a bit of velcro
and<00:04:56.730> then<00:04:57.730> on<00:04:58.000> the<00:04:58.120> underneath<00:04:58.510> side<00:04:58.780> of<00:04:58.840> the

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
and then on the underneath side of the

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.590 
and then on the underneath side of the
battery<00:04:59.350> will<00:04:59.440> put<00:04:59.560> a<00:04:59.590> bit<00:04:59.770> of<00:04:59.860> velcro<00:04:59.980> and

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
battery will put a bit of velcro and

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.150 
battery will put a bit of velcro and
that<00:05:01.600> way<00:05:01.720> we<00:05:01.870> can<00:05:02.020> adjust<00:05:02.110> it<00:05:02.530> back<00:05:03.430> and<00:05:03.670> forth

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:05.160 
that way we can adjust it back and forth

00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.240 
that way we can adjust it back and forth
where<00:05:06.160> we<00:05:06.190> want<00:05:06.550> it<00:05:06.730> and<00:05:07.830> of<00:05:08.830> course<00:05:09.040> about

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
where we want it and of course about

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.910 
where we want it and of course about
your<00:05:09.460> doodle<00:05:09.730> just<00:05:09.880> go<00:05:10.030> up<00:05:10.180> and<00:05:10.410> join<00:05:11.410> onto<00:05:11.770> the

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
your doodle just go up and join onto the

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.410 
your doodle just go up and join onto the
connector<00:05:12.900> so<00:05:14.100> what<00:05:15.100> I've<00:05:15.220> done<00:05:15.340> now<00:05:15.400> is<00:05:15.910> I've

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
connector so what I've done now is I've

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.560 
connector so what I've done now is I've
basically<00:05:16.660> cut<00:05:17.020> a<00:05:17.050> piece<00:05:17.230> of<00:05:17.380> velcro<00:05:18.570> that'll

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
basically cut a piece of velcro that'll

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.900 
basically cut a piece of velcro that'll
sit<00:05:20.020> in<00:05:20.140> there<00:05:20.410> like<00:05:20.880> so<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.890> cut<00:05:26.890> a<00:05:27.610> piece<00:05:27.850> of

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:27.910 
sit in there like so and cut a piece of

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:31.740 
sit in there like so and cut a piece of
velcro<00:05:29.700> that<00:05:30.700> will<00:05:30.760> sit<00:05:31.090> over<00:05:31.300> the<00:05:31.390> battery

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
velcro that will sit over the battery

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:39.420 
velcro that will sit over the battery
just<00:05:32.170> there<00:05:33.360> okay<00:05:34.590> now<00:05:37.800> what<00:05:38.800> I'm<00:05:38.920> doing<00:05:39.280> is

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
just there okay now what I'm doing is

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.880 
just there okay now what I'm doing is
I'm<00:05:39.640> preparing<00:05:40.630> some<00:05:40.810> five<00:05:41.050> minute<00:05:41.500> epoxy

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:43.890 

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:53.230 

download<00:05:44.890> a<00:05:44.920> small<00:05:45.100> amount

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:53.240 

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:55.740 

since<00:05:53.900> the<00:05:53.990> batteries<00:05:54.350> you<00:05:54.530> just<00:05:54.770> want<00:05:54.980> to<00:05:55.010> do

00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:55.750 
since the batteries you just want to do

00:05:55.750 --> 00:05:59.560 
since the batteries you just want to do
take<00:05:56.750> care<00:05:57.020> of<00:05:57.170> doing<00:05:57.350> that<00:05:57.500> one<00:05:57.680> first<00:05:58.570> just

00:05:59.560 --> 00:05:59.570 
take care of doing that one first just

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:03.960 
take care of doing that one first just
put<00:05:59.750> a<00:05:59.780> light<00:06:00.110> coating<00:06:01.390> across<00:06:02.390> the<00:06:02.870> battery

00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:03.970 
put a light coating across the battery

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:09.780 
put a light coating across the battery
like<00:06:04.970> so<00:06:05.240> on<00:06:06.280> the<00:06:07.280> back<00:06:07.460> of<00:06:07.670> the<00:06:07.820> actual<00:06:08.300> Lum

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:09.790 
like so on the back of the actual Lum

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:15.550 
like so on the back of the actual Lum
velcro<00:06:11.230> put<00:06:12.230> a<00:06:12.260> bit<00:06:12.470> more<00:06:13.960> so<00:06:14.960> that<00:06:14.990> presses

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:15.560 
velcro put a bit more so that presses

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:18.700 
velcro put a bit more so that presses
into<00:06:15.710> the<00:06:16.240> material<00:06:17.240> basically<00:06:17.720> it's<00:06:18.530> what

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 
into the material basically it's what
