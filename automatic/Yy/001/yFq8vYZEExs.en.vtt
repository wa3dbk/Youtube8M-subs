00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:31.459 
is that I thought that this is just what

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.340 
is that I thought that this is just what
everybody<00:02:31.910> had<00:02:32.120> been<00:02:32.150> talking<00:02:32.630> about<00:02:32.750> this<00:02:33.170> is

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
everybody had been talking about this is

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.970 
everybody had been talking about this is
what<00:02:33.560> happens<00:02:33.950> when<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.610> quiet<00:02:35.510> your<00:02:35.840> mind

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
what happens when you quiet your mind

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.790 
what happens when you quiet your mind
and<00:02:36.980> you<00:02:37.400> become<00:02:38.000> centered<00:02:38.780> and<00:02:39.140> as<00:02:39.410> soon<00:02:39.620> as<00:02:39.709> I

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:39.800 
and you become centered and as soon as I

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.800 
and you become centered and as soon as I
heard<00:02:40.430> the<00:02:40.489> word<00:02:40.730> tingles

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
heard the word tingles

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.660

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
I thought it's the perfect word to

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.310 
I thought it's the perfect word to
describe<00:02:43.820> it<00:02:44.270> it's<00:02:44.480> almost<00:02:44.690> like<00:02:44.870> an<00:02:44.959> ethereal

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
describe it it's almost like an ethereal

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.420 
describe it it's almost like an ethereal
like<00:02:46.600> kind<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.660> feeling<00:02:48.080> it<00:02:48.290> genuinely<00:02:48.950> feels

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
like kind of feeling it genuinely feels

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.780 
like kind of feeling it genuinely feels
good<00:02:49.850> like<00:02:50.270> an<00:02:50.420> electric<00:02:50.989> particularly<00:02:51.830> bolt
