00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.610

 I do not know how else to say it 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.050
 He is like that 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.050
 if you knew him 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:34.540
 if you would expect a sheep say a daughter in the bushes of life 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:38.040
 you think that the father is going to stay calm in the comfort of his 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.080
 Imperial Palace 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.090
 the father dies of nostalgia for his daughter 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.090
 Pole sidewalk but dear also 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:52.630
 and before a public prostitute is a beloved and favorite daughter 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.470
 and he dies of nostalgia for his daughter and they can not stand far from her 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:04.420
 and jump out of the world behind her and climb the mountain ranges and descend to the 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.890
 hollows a record of the valleys looks out over the precipices 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.779

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:25.989
 whistling and saying 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:30.450
 that daughter gave her more joy than the whole world 

00:02:31.899 --> 00:02:34.979
 I do not know how else to tell them 

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:39.189
