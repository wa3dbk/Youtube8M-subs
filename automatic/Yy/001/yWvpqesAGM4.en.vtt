00:00:01.599 --> 00:00:03.489
Hello everyone today
are we going to do

00:00:03.489 --> 00:00:07.370
salt is very
very tasty fat

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:10.299
the fat in the Bank salt

00:00:10.299 --> 00:00:12.270
fat is really very tasty

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.059
easily done

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:15.909
and let's try that

00:00:15.909 --> 00:00:18.029
try not
regret it

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.369
we need the very
fat - slice

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.089
3 - 4 cloves of garlic

00:00:24.089 --> 00:00:26.789
allspice,
black pepper

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.560
and a bit of coriander

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:31.759
I always add coriander
a little bit

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.329
coriander powder and peas

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.090
Bay leaf, salt, water

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.490
take about

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:42.790
500 - 600

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:47.400
milliliters of water

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.110
this is for quart jar

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.040
add 3 to 4 tablespoons of salt

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:58.350
fat in a lot of salt will not take

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.350
so I pour 4 tablespoons

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.570
add

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:18.570
5 coriander seeds, 2 grains allspice,

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:26.200
some grains of black pepper

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.300
and a little ground black pepper

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:37.400
and a pinch of coriander

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:47.600
coriander can be added, but it tastes better.

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.440
and add 1 Bay leaf

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.480
you can use dried, I use fresh,green.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.620
As it is growing on my windowsill, and it is more aromatic.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.290
here is a Laurel tree

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.050
therefore it is easier for me

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.190
it is enough to take

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:08.719
and tear off the leaf

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:11.189
fresh turns
much tastier

00:02:11.189 --> 00:02:15.129
you can also add a pinch of Svan mixture

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:24.280
Svan mix I like too

00:02:24.809 --> 00:02:29.969
wait when the water boils

00:02:29.969 --> 00:02:33.879
meanwhile chop the bacon

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:39.059
cut the fat into small pieces

00:02:39.059 --> 00:02:40.749
and garlic

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:42.099
and now it's all

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.319
we put in a jar

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.059
on the bottom is a little bit of garlic

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:51.089
and then stacked
our fat

00:02:51.089 --> 00:02:54.399
well, we put our
fat in a jar

00:02:54.399 --> 00:02:56.309
fat was 600 grams

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:59.049
it was a little bit little

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.789
I usually Lodge more

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:05.509
the brine has boiled

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:08.519
and here's a little trick:

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:13.429
immediately pour hot!

00:03:13.429 --> 00:03:16.069
you can pour cold, then the fat will pray

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.609
about

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:22.559
7 days

00:03:22.559 --> 00:03:25.279
but I tried
pour the hot and

00:03:25.279 --> 00:03:27.889
I liked it so much
more. Its taste

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:30.479
even better. Do not say,

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:33.289
that cold water is worse

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:37.339
it's just different. We liked it more.

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:39.269
And salted it

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.159
much faster

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:44.019
a day later
you can eat.

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.099
The day after tomorrow can
there

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:48.729
try with a spoon
here below, this

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:50.249
pepper

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.559
to choose to we all

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.789
left in a jar of fat.

00:03:57.789 --> 00:04:00.359
All, fill the jar with brine and close

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:06.129
cover

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.029
And the day after our bacon
ready.

00:04:09.029 --> 00:04:11.479
and in our fat can
add

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:15.489
1 tea
a spoonful of sugar

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:16.829
then it will be

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:18.780
even better
try not

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.659
regret it very very
delicious

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:25.080
all all the while.
Next time we

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.860
will

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.040
to smoke the bacon.
