now<00:00:41.270> you<00:00:41.960> saw<00:00:42.170> me<00:00:42.350> cut<00:00:42.560> this<00:00:42.770> way<00:00:43.010> and<00:00:43.340> then

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
now you saw me cut this way and then

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.240 
now you saw me cut this way and then
drop<00:00:44.570> in<00:00:44.780> this<00:00:44.989> way<00:00:45.170> kind<00:00:45.590> of<00:00:45.680> a<00:00:45.739> plunge<00:00:45.980> cut

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
drop in this way kind of a plunge cut

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.460 
drop in this way kind of a plunge cut
here<00:00:46.550> we<00:00:47.150> can<00:00:47.329> actually<00:00:47.660> come<00:00:47.870> in<00:00:48.020> from<00:00:48.170> both

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
here we can actually come in from both

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.590 
here we can actually come in from both
directions<00:00:48.760> it's<00:00:49.760> just<00:00:49.940> a<00:00:50.000> little<00:00:50.210> harder<00:00:50.480> to

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:50.600 
directions it's just a little harder to

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.510 
directions it's just a little harder to
see<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:50.930> blade<00:00:51.140> or<00:00:51.440> the<00:00:51.680> line<00:00:52.100> when<00:00:52.370> we're

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
see the blade or the line when we're

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.220 
see the blade or the line when we're
cutting<00:00:52.730> I'll<00:00:53.210> do<00:00:53.480> that<00:00:53.629> in<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.050> next

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.230 
cutting I'll do that in the next

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:14.539 
cutting I'll do that in the next
demonstration

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:57.090 

and<00:01:15.549> now<00:01:15.700> we'll<00:01:15.880> come<00:01:16.030> in<00:01:16.149> this<00:01:16.329> way

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.100 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.640 

all<00:01:58.100> right<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:58.460> that<00:01:58.760> we<00:01:58.880> have<00:01:59.320> cut<00:02:00.320> out<00:02:00.440> the

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
all right now that we have cut out the

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.250 
all right now that we have cut out the
run<00:02:00.830> and<00:02:01.010> a<00:02:01.070> rise<00:02:01.250> on<00:02:01.700> our<00:02:02.030> skirt<00:02:02.300> boards<00:02:02.690> this

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:03.260 
run and a rise on our skirt boards this

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:06.430 
run and a rise on our skirt boards this
is<00:02:03.440> how<00:02:03.560> it<00:02:03.680> should<00:02:03.890> look<00:02:03.920> when<00:02:05.290> they're<00:02:06.290> all

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
is how it should look when they're all

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.639 
is how it should look when they're all
cut<00:02:06.650> out<00:02:06.680> like<00:02:06.950> this<00:02:07.660> skirt<00:02:08.660> board<00:02:08.869> rough<00:02:09.410> cut

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
cut out like this skirt board rough cut

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.650 
cut out like this skirt board rough cut
out<00:02:09.830> I'm<00:02:10.310> going<00:02:10.520> to<00:02:10.580> slide<00:02:10.789> it<00:02:10.970> into<00:02:11.120> place<00:02:11.330> now

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:11.660 
out I'm going to slide it into place now

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:13.780 
out I'm going to slide it into place now
notice<00:02:11.990> that<00:02:12.020> it's<00:02:12.230> not<00:02:12.380> bottoming<00:02:13.370> out<00:02:13.520> where

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
notice that it's not bottoming out where

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.250 
notice that it's not bottoming out where
we<00:02:13.970> want<00:02:14.180> it<00:02:14.270> to<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.540> just<00:02:14.840> yet

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
we want it to go just yet

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.930 
we want it to go just yet
there's<00:02:15.620> a<00:02:15.709> couple<00:02:15.980> things<00:02:16.160> we<00:02:16.400> have<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.700> do<00:02:16.820> to

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
there's a couple things we have to do to

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.330 
there's a couple things we have to do to
custom<00:02:17.330> fit<00:02:17.450> this<00:02:17.630> into<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:18.110> into<00:02:18.860> following

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:19.340 
custom fit this into the into following

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.860 
custom fit this into the into following
the<00:02:19.430> shape<00:02:19.670> of<00:02:19.820> the<00:02:19.940> run<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:20.270> the<00:02:20.330> rise<00:02:20.510> here

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
the shape of the run and the rise here

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:23.170 
the shape of the run and the rise here
so<00:02:21.440> first<00:02:22.190> thing<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:22.550> going<00:02:22.670> to<00:02:22.730> do<00:02:22.880> is<00:02:23.060> I'm
