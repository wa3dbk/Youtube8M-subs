00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:11.110 
choppers comes after all the chaos that

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:21.700 
choppers comes after all the chaos that
you<00:05:11.919> caused<00:05:12.279> a<00:05:18.360> construction<00:05:19.360> crew<00:05:19.599> comes

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
you caused a construction crew comes

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:27.970 
you caused a construction crew comes
you

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:27.980 

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:37.400 

and<00:05:29.630> fixes<00:05:30.630> everything

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:40.250 

but<00:05:38.410> this<00:05:38.560> takes<00:05:38.800> a<00:05:38.949> while<00:05:38.980> so<00:05:39.400> if<00:05:39.520> you<00:05:39.669> disrupt

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:40.260 
but this takes a while so if you disrupt

00:05:40.260 --> 00:05:43.470 
but this takes a while so if you disrupt
construction<00:05:41.260> little<00:05:42.130> bit<00:05:42.400> even<00:05:42.699> longer<00:05:43.060> so

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:43.480 
construction little bit even longer so

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:45.659 
construction little bit even longer so
that<00:05:43.510> closed<00:05:43.840> off<00:05:44.020> streets<00:05:44.500> because<00:05:45.490> of

00:05:45.659 --> 00:05:45.669 
that closed off streets because of

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.000 
that closed off streets because of
everything<00:05:46.000> so<00:05:46.990> both<00:05:47.350> what<00:05:47.680> you<00:05:47.860> have

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.010 
everything so both what you have

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:52.110 
everything so both what you have
destroyed<00:05:49.139> so<00:05:50.139> I<00:05:50.169> shot<00:05:50.500> the<00:05:50.650> guy<00:05:50.860> it<00:05:51.790> takes<00:05:52.000> a

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:52.120 
destroyed so I shot the guy it takes a

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.270 
destroyed so I shot the guy it takes a
step<00:05:52.330> back<00:05:52.360> and<00:05:52.600> someone<00:05:53.440> else<00:05:53.680> blow<00:05:53.919> the<00:05:54.070> rim

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:54.280 
step back and someone else blow the rim

00:05:54.280 --> 00:06:01.439 
step back and someone else blow the rim
is<00:05:54.550> that<00:05:54.790> my<00:05:55.030> fault<00:05:55.350> I<00:06:00.210> really<00:06:01.210> got<00:06:01.330> excited

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:01.449 
is that my fault I really got excited

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.469 
is that my fault I really got excited
