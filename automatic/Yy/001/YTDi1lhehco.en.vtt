really<00:01:31.979> important<00:01:32.340> because<00:01:32.400> a<00:01:32.579> lot<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> people

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
really important because a lot of people

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.420 
really important because a lot of people
from<00:01:33.590> just<00:01:34.590> anywhere<00:01:34.950> don't<00:01:35.220> really

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
from just anywhere don't really

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.190 
from just anywhere don't really
understand<00:01:35.820> tennis<00:01:36.180> I<00:01:36.299> mean<00:01:36.479> we<00:01:36.780> got<00:01:36.900> sick<00:01:37.110> in

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
understand tennis I mean we got sick in

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.630 
understand tennis I mean we got sick in
our<00:01:37.229> freshman<00:01:37.590> year<00:01:37.619> so<00:01:37.890> though<00:01:38.009> they<00:01:38.549> were

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
our freshman year so though they were

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.670 
our freshman year so though they were
all<00:01:38.729> expecting<00:01:39.030> us<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.420> do<00:01:39.509> great<00:01:39.689> software<00:01:40.500> or

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
all expecting us to do great software or

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.440 
all expecting us to do great software or
maybe<00:01:40.890> like<00:01:41.040> win<00:01:41.220> it<00:01:41.369> but<00:01:41.579> we<00:01:41.970> beat<00:01:42.119> them<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
maybe like win it but we beat them I

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:43.969 
maybe like win it but we beat them I
think<00:01:42.540> one<00:01:42.840> in<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.079> last<00:01:43.259> year<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.710> we<00:01:43.950> just

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
think one in one last year and we just

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.289 
think one in one last year and we just
beat<00:01:44.250> him<00:01:44.369> four<00:01:44.549> and<00:01:44.640> four<00:01:44.790> so<00:01:45.060> they<00:01:45.149> obviously

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
beat him four and four so they obviously

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.020 
beat him four and four so they obviously
improved<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.350> don't<00:01:47.189> know<00:01:47.250> as<00:01:47.520> long<00:01:47.820> as<00:01:47.939> we

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030 
improved but I don't know as long as we

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.090 
improved but I don't know as long as we
play<00:01:48.270> our<00:01:48.390> best<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.750> think<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.200> don't<00:01:49.439> really<00:01:49.619> I

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
play our best I think I don't really I

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.740 
play our best I think I don't really I
mean<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:50.520> matters<00:01:50.640> what<00:01:50.880> place<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.180> get<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:51.509> I

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
mean it matters what place we get but I

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.230 
mean it matters what place we get but I
just<00:01:52.079> want<00:01:52.229> to<00:01:52.290> play<00:01:52.350> my<00:01:52.560> best<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.979> see

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
just want to play my best and see

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.510 
just want to play my best and see
I<00:01:53.780> mean<00:01:54.170> they<00:01:54.290> are<00:01:54.410> sisters<00:01:54.830> in<00:01:55.010> the<00:01:55.100> herd<00:01:55.250> twin

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:55.520 
I mean they are sisters in the herd twin

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.430 
I mean they are sisters in the herd twin
so<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:55.790> mean<00:01:55.970> either<00:01:56.150> way<00:01:56.390> it's<00:01:56.630> it's<00:01:56.990> gonna<00:01:57.230> be

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
so I mean either way it's it's gonna be

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.070 
so I mean either way it's it's gonna be
tough<00:01:58.040> they<00:01:58.550> just<00:01:58.760> had<00:01:58.880> really<00:01:59.120> solid<00:01:59.600> Serbs<00:01:59.960> I

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:00.080 
tough they just had really solid Serbs I

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.290 
tough they just had really solid Serbs I
mean<00:02:00.290> the<00:02:00.950> rest<00:02:01.160> we<00:02:01.370> did<00:02:01.550> fine<00:02:01.790> but<00:02:02.090> you<00:02:02.180> know

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
mean the rest we did fine but you know

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.820 
mean the rest we did fine but you know
they<00:02:02.480> just<00:02:02.510> served<00:02:02.870> a<00:02:02.990> lot<00:02:03.140> better<00:02:03.350> than<00:02:03.560> us<00:02:03.680> I

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
they just served a lot better than us I

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.410 
they just served a lot better than us I
would<00:02:03.950> say<00:02:04.070> she's<00:02:04.460> more<00:02:04.640> aggressive<00:02:05.210> with<00:02:05.270> her

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:05.420 
would say she's more aggressive with her

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.499 
would say she's more aggressive with her
forehand<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.590> stuff<00:02:06.890> it's<00:02:07.400> more<00:02:07.610> more<00:02:08.360> of<00:02:08.390> her

00:02:08.499 --> 00:02:08.509 
forehand and stuff it's more more of her

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.719 
forehand and stuff it's more more of her
strength<00:02:08.810> in<00:02:09.050> my<00:02:09.200> foreign<00:02:09.560> is<00:02:09.740> she's<00:02:10.550> more

00:02:10.719 --> 00:02:10.729 
strength in my foreign is she's more

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.220 
strength in my foreign is she's more
consistent<00:02:11.270> than<00:02:11.420> I<00:02:11.660> am<00:02:11.840> and<00:02:12.020> I'm<00:02:12.080> probably

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
consistent than I am and I'm probably

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.100 
consistent than I am and I'm probably
more<00:02:12.520> powerful<00:02:13.520> our<00:02:14.090> school<00:02:14.360> has<00:02:14.720> probably

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
more powerful our school has probably

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.040 
more powerful our school has probably
two<00:02:15.440> 80<00:02:15.650> or<00:02:16.010> less<00:02:16.040> kids<00:02:16.670> so<00:02:17.630> we<00:02:17.840> don't<00:02:17.990> have

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:18.050 
two 80 or less kids so we don't have

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:19.360 
two 80 or less kids so we don't have
that<00:02:18.110> room<00:02:18.320> many<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.680> we<00:02:18.830> struggle<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.190> get

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370 
that room many and we struggle to get

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:20.920 
that room many and we struggle to get
six<00:02:19.610> people<00:02:19.790> for<00:02:19.970> our<00:02:20.060> tennis<00:02:20.300> team<00:02:20.480> because

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
six people for our tennis team because

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:22.270 
six people for our tennis team because
there's<00:02:21.110> not<00:02:21.230> usually<00:02:21.410> a<00:02:21.650> lot<00:02:21.770> of<00:02:21.890> downstate

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
there's not usually a lot of downstate

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.479 
there's not usually a lot of downstate
teams<00:02:22.490> that<00:02:22.700> do<00:02:22.820> well<00:02:23.030> here<00:02:23.570> so<00:02:24.340> everyone<00:02:25.340> at

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
teams that do well here so everyone at

started<00:03:14.810> off<00:03:14.900> the<00:03:15.110> little<00:03:15.260> stone

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:15.830 
started off the little stone

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.530 
started off the little stone
both<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.430> first<00:03:16.670> sets<00:03:16.910> and<00:03:17.120> I<00:03:17.150> think<00:03:17.330> that's

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
both the first sets and I think that's

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.570 
both the first sets and I think that's
what<00:03:17.840> kind<00:03:18.049> of<00:03:18.140> end<00:03:18.230> up<00:03:18.320> losing<00:03:18.530> that<00:03:19.310> first

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
what kind of end up losing that first

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.759 
what kind of end up losing that first
set<00:03:19.760> for<00:03:19.910> us<00:03:20.000> because<00:03:20.180> we<00:03:20.299> were<00:03:20.390> down<00:03:20.540> 4-1<00:03:20.870> came

00:03:21.759 --> 00:03:21.769 
set for us because we were down 4-1 came

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:25.060 
set for us because we were down 4-1 came
back<00:03:21.950> to<00:03:22.100> 5-4<00:03:22.580> and<00:03:22.760> came<00:03:23.269> out<00:03:23.480> second<00:03:24.170> set<00:03:24.350> down

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:25.070 
back to 5-4 and came out second set down

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.640 
back to 5-4 and came out second set down
4-1<00:03:25.430> again<00:03:25.850> came<00:03:26.570> back<00:03:26.780> pumped<00:03:27.320> up<00:03:27.470> and<00:03:27.620> I

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
4-1 again came back pumped up and I

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.020 
4-1 again came back pumped up and I
think<00:03:27.830> we<00:03:27.920> really<00:03:28.190> came<00:03:28.400> together<00:03:28.549> well<00:03:28.940> in

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
think we really came together well in

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:30.400 
think we really came together well in
that<00:03:29.120> second<00:03:29.480> set<00:03:29.660> third<00:03:29.900> set

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
that second set third set

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.740 
that second set third set
we<00:03:30.769> came<00:03:30.980> back<00:03:31.100> broke<00:03:31.459> back<00:03:31.640> from<00:03:31.880> down<00:03:32.540> one

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
we came back broke back from down one

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.600 
we came back broke back from down one
and<00:03:32.900> two<00:03:33.049> and<00:03:33.380> we<00:03:33.799> were<00:03:33.890> up<00:03:33.950> 3-2<00:03:34.370> and

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
and two and we were up 3-2 and

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.130 
and two and we were up 3-2 and
definitely<00:03:35.120> had<00:03:35.299> our<00:03:35.330> chance<00:03:35.630> at<00:03:35.780> 4<00:03:35.959> to

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:36.140 
definitely had our chance at 4 to

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:38.289 
definitely had our chance at 4 to
serving<00:03:36.590> but<00:03:36.769> I<00:03:37.040> think<00:03:37.579> overall<00:03:37.820> they<00:03:38.090> did

00:03:38.289 --> 00:03:38.299 
serving but I think overall they did

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:40.210 
serving but I think overall they did
really<00:03:38.989> well<00:03:39.110> staying<00:03:39.470> together<00:03:39.620> and<00:03:39.890> stay

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
really well staying together and stay

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.370 
really well staying together and stay
positive<00:03:40.459> and<00:03:40.850> really<00:03:41.720> played<00:03:41.930> the<00:03:42.049> net<00:03:42.200> wall

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
positive and really played the net wall

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.990 
positive and really played the net wall
and<00:03:42.500> I<00:03:42.560> think<00:03:42.769> if<00:03:42.890> I<00:03:43.130> could<00:03:43.459> do<00:03:43.519> that<00:03:43.640> again<00:03:43.700> I

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:44.000 
and I think if I could do that again I

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:44.920 
and I think if I could do that again I
think<00:03:44.030> we<00:03:44.329> could

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:44.930 
think we could

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:46.660 
think we could
isn't<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.230> a<00:03:45.319> little<00:03:45.379> bit<00:03:45.560> more<00:03:45.739> yeah<00:03:46.640> I

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
isn't that a little bit more yeah I

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.580 
isn't that a little bit more yeah I
think<00:03:46.969> it<00:03:47.239> came<00:03:47.420> down<00:03:47.599> to<00:03:47.900> just<00:03:48.049> a<00:03:48.290> couple<00:03:48.469> of

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:48.590 
think it came down to just a couple of

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:50.800 
think it came down to just a couple of
points<00:03:48.829> that<00:03:49.609> they<00:03:50.000> played<00:03:50.269> better<00:03:50.420> than<00:03:50.629> we

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
points that they played better than we

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:52.990 
points that they played better than we
did<00:03:50.989> we<00:03:51.650> needed<00:03:51.950> to<00:03:52.040> keep<00:03:52.219> moving<00:03:52.609> and<00:03:52.819> they

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000 
did we needed to keep moving and they

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.580 
did we needed to keep moving and they
really<00:03:53.359> you<00:03:53.599> know<00:03:53.629> covered<00:03:54.079> each<00:03:54.170> other<00:03:54.379> and

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
really you know covered each other and

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:55.990 
really you know covered each other and
moved<00:03:54.769> really<00:03:55.040> well<00:03:55.310> and<00:03:55.519> finished<00:03:55.849> off

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.000 
moved really well and finished off

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.030 
moved really well and finished off
points<00:03:56.420> which<00:03:56.569> I<00:03:56.719> think<00:03:56.930> I<00:03:57.140> ended<00:03:57.769> up<00:03:57.829> losing

00:03:58.030 --> 00:03:58.040 
points which I think I ended up losing

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.349 
points which I think I ended up losing
it<00:03:58.340> for<00:03:58.519> us<00:03:58.700> we<00:03:58.969> couldn't<00:03:59.180> finish<00:03:59.480> the<00:03:59.659> points
