00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.950
 PSV is the leader in the league for 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.569
 a-juniors the team of Pascal Jansen 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.580
 received FC Groningen 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.559
 that is trained by this old psv 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.059
 peter hoekstra 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.710
 hoekstra played from one and has to 6 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:15.870
 9 for psv 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.270
 because up to 90 matches and 21 goals 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.699
 to have 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.109
 psv a1 is the best at this duel that what 

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:28.189
 makes pretty pretty 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.189
 my will ate back again 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.110
 you handle that debt with the pass on sambo 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 dumbbell down to searching for Hamada 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.000
 but that promise was taken out and so on 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.739
 First chance for PSV lost was 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.739
 said the opening of psv was good 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:49.800
 arias a sheet duel with jordi de wise him 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.329
 loose 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.280
 the cross on oldenburg and then good 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.809
 come out of joyce and was late 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.809
 prevent with which a big hit 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.410
 last Tuesday, the game was played by psv 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.270
 a1 against ajax still canceled 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.689
 because of the fog now where the 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.710
 weather conditions well so well 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.180
 strong on the ball his uncle with the shot 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.159
 that goes long and so hears again 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:19.350
 it all preece hit for psv that the 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:21.330
 actually well-deserved mahmoud 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:27.270
 with the space on the left 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:29.430
 sander heesakkers he will teach you with jim 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.869
 the lions that duel the pass of as 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.810
 otherwise we always intended to walk that ball 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.259
 then the chance for rommens is your no 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.259
 hit 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:48.680
 full of pain but left after another psv 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:50.869
 can it quickly go into vogue now what 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.210
 and nobody has room for themselves 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:53.869
 nice move now what a shot at 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:57.470
 level 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:03.049
 the rebound than full of cars there is ps a lot 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:05.720
 public good chance for the team 

00:02:03.049 --> 00:02:09.350
 from Pascal Jansen 

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.930
 so again a hit rommens corner 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.090
 determined you build up there is error with the 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.280
 truck laying on there is we who hits the 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.170
 fists of sytsma 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.080
 mountain wine that entered the team for the 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.780
 massaged at will he too 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:28.489
 so not accurate 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.190
 then to rest with alberto rommens 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:33.019
 deep care at sauna and has time and 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.670
 space 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:36.890
 they call it the overview comes there 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.799
 one towards the ball around nicely 

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.820
 off by earning in 48 minutes 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:44.660
 lead for psv a1 so what rest so 

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.720
 failed 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:53.359
 club directly home the boss of 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:55.010
 rommens would still be all excellent 

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:56.930
 the defenders cut it out 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.310
 put back 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:00.440
 and now what with the dry slider in the 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.670
 short angle 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.739
 so something but for the first time 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.920
 knocked 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:09.880
 van vlerken again with the depth in front 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:12.410
 such a high to be with boss in front of him 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.030
 but he rips off his to the 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:15.230
 put in typing per per lost 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:17.350
 that ball goes on the pole 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.819
 that someone from rubbish estimates high about 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:25.910
 my there psv yes you really away 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:30.019
 especially this mountain of wine or works 

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:33.190
 Trade unions are fond of your power needs in 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:35.540
 you come out of psv very nicely via rommens 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:42.860
 teach something like that in that attack 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:45.520
 the shot from salon still 2 0 to the 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:47.730
 joy that goes with it 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.080
 [Music] 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.950
 [Applause] 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:54.580
 by will of sano 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.730
 I will get rid of you 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.950
 passes sytsma innovate 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:02.190
 psv so at 2 0 and so must groningen 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.190
 to buy 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.200
 substitute jasper finds here arias i had 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.380
 that ball through also a substitute on the 

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.690
 and over it's relief when taken care of 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:28.090
 lab had escaped psv so we exist 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:30.780
 let my video be jasper again and that now 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:34.090
 arias also has room to shoot 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.990
 my good chance for the groningers may 

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.990
 now is not a success 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:46.080
 in the final phase then praise mountain wine again 

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:46.080
 foliage 

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.000
 must come forward by chance 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.909
 at the second pole and has its still 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.159
 something very beautiful in his mind's shot 

00:04:52.909 --> 00:04:58.490
 goes wrong 

00:04:55.159 --> 00:05:00.379
 psv does win the well with 2 0 and the 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:01.879
 fifth win in a row 

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:05.919
 it is always a leader in the 

00:05:01.879 --> 00:05:05.919
 national league for juniors to
