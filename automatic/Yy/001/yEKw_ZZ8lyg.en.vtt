of<00:02:02.120> these<00:02:02.180> fundamentals<00:02:02.930> and<00:02:03.140> in<00:02:03.200> turn

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:03.470 
of these fundamentals and in turn

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:05.950 
of these fundamentals and in turn
improve<00:02:03.920> your<00:02:04.400> photos<00:02:04.700> dramatically<00:02:05.360> will

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
improve your photos dramatically will

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.570 
improve your photos dramatically will
also<00:02:06.380> give<00:02:06.560> you<00:02:06.650> different<00:02:07.070> tricks<00:02:07.370> that

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:07.580 
also give you different tricks that

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.310 
also give you different tricks that
professionals<00:02:08.119> use<00:02:08.179> to<00:02:08.600> make<00:02:09.020> sure<00:02:09.170> they

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
professionals use to make sure they

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.800 
professionals use to make sure they
always<00:02:09.530> have<00:02:09.890> that

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
always have that

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.600 
always have that
getting<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:12.900> right<00:02:13.020> exposure<00:02:13.500> is<00:02:13.950> up<00:02:14.280> to<00:02:14.430> you

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
getting the right exposure is up to you

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.010 
getting the right exposure is up to you
and<00:02:14.880> what<00:02:15.120> you<00:02:15.150> want<00:02:15.390> to<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.540> doing<00:02:15.690> with<00:02:15.900> your

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
and what you want to be doing with your

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.310 
and what you want to be doing with your
exposures<00:02:16.800> creatively<00:02:17.900> here<00:02:18.900> I'm<00:02:19.140> going<00:02:19.260> to

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:19.320 
exposures creatively here I'm going to

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.430 
exposures creatively here I'm going to
be<00:02:19.410> shooting<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:20.010> couple<00:02:20.460> of<00:02:20.550> different

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
be shooting a couple of different

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.580 
be shooting a couple of different
exposures<00:02:22.730> using<00:02:23.730> a<00:02:23.910> wide<00:02:24.570> aperture<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.320> a

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
exposures using a wide aperture and a

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.580 
exposures using a wide aperture and a
small<00:02:25.950> aperture<00:02:26.690> taking<00:02:27.690> photos<00:02:28.080> in<00:02:28.290> a<00:02:28.350> bright

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
small aperture taking photos in a bright

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.200 
small aperture taking photos in a bright
sunny<00:02:28.890> day<00:02:28.980> it's<00:02:29.310> not<00:02:29.430> the<00:02:29.550> ideal<00:02:30.030> situation

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
sunny day it's not the ideal situation

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:32.390 
sunny day it's not the ideal situation
but<00:02:31.140> it's<00:02:31.290> a<00:02:31.320> common<00:02:31.590> event<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.950> most<00:02:32.100> of<00:02:32.280> us

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
but it's a common event for most of us

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.490 
but it's a common event for most of us
so<00:02:33.210> let's<00:02:33.240> look<00:02:33.540> at<00:02:33.690> some<00:02:33.840> ways<00:02:33.990> that<00:02:34.050> we<00:02:34.320> can

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
so let's look at some ways that we can

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.060 
so let's look at some ways that we can

composition<00:03:00.959> looks<00:03:01.110> better<00:03:01.350> and<00:03:01.650> you<00:03:01.770> can

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
composition looks better and you can

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.710 
composition looks better and you can
really<00:03:02.100> focus<00:03:02.580> in<00:03:02.730> on<00:03:02.760> the<00:03:03.120> expression<00:03:03.540> of<00:03:03.630> the

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:12.570 
middle of the frame but you want to move

middle of the frame but you want to move
across<00:03:12.930> to<00:03:13.620> use<00:03:13.770> composition<00:03:14.519> rules<00:03:14.730> like<00:03:15.300> the

rules before taking it further you will

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.440 
rules before taking it further you will
see<00:03:20.010> a<00:03:20.040> massive<00:03:20.370> improvement<00:03:20.670> in<00:03:21.300> your

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
see a massive improvement in your

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.479 
see a massive improvement in your
photography<00:03:21.600> straightaway<00:03:22.470> if<00:03:23.010> we<00:03:23.160> know<00:03:23.280> how

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
photography straightaway if we know how

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.940 
photography straightaway if we know how
the<00:03:23.550> system<00:03:23.940> works<00:03:24.180> then<00:03:25.170> we<00:03:25.260> can<00:03:25.440> really<00:03:25.650> push

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
the system works then we can really push

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:36.610 
the system works then we can really push
it

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.430 

camera<00:03:37.580> modes<00:03:38.150> I<00:03:38.180> like<00:03:38.510> your<00:03:38.720> gears<00:03:38.959> in<00:03:39.140> a<00:03:39.230> car

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:39.440 
camera modes I like your gears in a car

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.080 
camera modes I like your gears in a car
you<00:03:39.980> wouldn't<00:03:40.130> know<00:03:40.280> how<00:03:40.430> to<00:03:40.459> drive<00:03:40.760> if<00:03:41.000> you

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
you wouldn't know how to drive if you

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.089 
you wouldn't know how to drive if you
didn't<00:03:41.360> know<00:03:41.420> how<00:03:41.540> to<00:03:41.569> shift<00:03:41.870> gears<00:03:41.989> so<00:03:42.890> let's

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:43.099 
didn't know how to shift gears so let's

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:44.530 
didn't know how to shift gears so let's
look<00:03:43.250> at<00:03:43.400> what<00:03:43.550> each<00:03:43.580> different<00:03:44.060> mode<00:03:44.239> does

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
look at what each different mode does

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.500 
look at what each different mode does
and<00:03:44.780> how<00:03:45.170> we<00:03:45.230> can<00:03:45.440> use<00:03:45.650> it<00:03:46.000> once<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.150> have<00:03:47.180> that

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
and how we can use it once you have that

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.690 
and how we can use it once you have that
perfect<00:03:48.050> photo<00:03:48.230> then<00:03:48.950> you<00:03:49.069> need<00:03:49.220> the<00:03:49.340> story

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:49.700 
perfect photo then you need the story

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.780 
perfect photo then you need the story
there<00:03:50.510> are<00:03:50.569> three<00:03:50.810> main<00:03:51.020> formats<00:03:51.550> JPEG<00:03:52.550> raw

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:52.790 
there are three main formats JPEG raw

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:55.900 
there are three main formats JPEG raw

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910
