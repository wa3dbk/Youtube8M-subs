00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
for 36,000 i'm not sure what he's going

for 36,000 i'm not sure what he's going
for<00:05:24.819> now<00:05:25.060> but<00:05:25.300> at<00:05:25.419> the<00:05:25.449> time<00:05:25.539> that<00:05:25.900> was<00:05:26.050> a

00:05:26.279 --> 00:05:26.289 
for now but at the time that was a

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:28.890 
for now but at the time that was a
pretty<00:05:26.650> good<00:05:26.889> price<00:05:27.039> for<00:05:27.159> him<00:05:27.550> and<00:05:27.729> he<00:05:28.690> does

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
pretty good price for him and he does

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.260 
pretty good price for him and he does
have<00:05:29.139> 97<00:05:29.740> speed<00:05:29.979> 95<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.460> sale<00:05:30.789> I<00:05:30.819> think<00:05:31.120> he<00:05:31.180> has

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
have 97 speed 95 a sale I think he has

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
like 87 spec he's not that much worse

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.260 
like 87 spec he's not that much worse
than<00:05:34.330> the<00:05:34.389> 97<00:05:35.020> DRC<00:05:36.009> and<00:05:36.159> he's<00:05:36.610> a<00:05:36.789> lot<00:05:37.060> better

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:37.270 
than the 97 DRC and he's a lot better

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.589
