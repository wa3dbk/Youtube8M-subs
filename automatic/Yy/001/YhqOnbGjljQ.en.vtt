00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 you have to know one thing is that 

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.890
 the school class hypothesis is 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:06.540
 more rare but on the other hand we have very 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:08.040
 very frequently damage that is 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.599
 caused by minor children the 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.710
 d510 in barns or things 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.190
 like that of children playing with 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.840
 matches 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.130
 these are fairly frequent events 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.179
 on which occasion strong 

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.470
 luckily by the way 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.699
 parents are assured because this 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.410
 are they who are declared responsible 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.880
 by law this is what I was going to 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.439
 you ask vandals are minors 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.180
 so automatically it's the parents 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.670
 who are responsible then the law 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.019
 provides in an article that we are 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.269
 responsible for the things we have under his 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.070
 guard and a number of people 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.360
 this is the case of an employer with respect to 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.040
 its employees this is the case of parents to 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.270
 with regard to their minor children to 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.739
 condition that they live at home 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.090
 and that they have laggarded the notion of 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.590
 seem to be a strong law concept 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.120
 old that we know pretty well 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.809
 since the children were under the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.070
 custody of their parents 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.170
 he was not in school 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.270
 under the responsibility of the teachers 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.320
 but he was during the periods of 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.030
 holidays therefore they are 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.739
 returned to their parents' care 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.539
 parents are by will the law 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.800
 it's article 13 184 of the civil code 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.270
 they are the parents are responsible 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.680
 of all faults and all 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.090
 mistakes that may have been made by the 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.219
 children 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.660
 important clarification responsibility 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.140
 imputed to each child or in a manner 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.339
 collective 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.689
 so that's a little bit more 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:08.460
 complicated since it will belong to 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.260
 judge who will try to reconstruct the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.729
 circumstances to know what were 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 what was the respective share of 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.630
 each of the children to determine if 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.970
 this responsibility will be individual 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.350
 collective and the reconstitution of 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.430
 facts will know it is clear 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.830
 only if 5-year-olds have 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.180
 participated in these wishes to this event on 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.680
 can not imagine that it's them who 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.600
 either the leaders who have 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.430
 caused the most damage or even a 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.509
 part of them we can imagine that 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.590
 it's the older ones who have a little 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.030
 trained the weaker he 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.770
 will belong to the police services 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.820
 make an investigation to determine the 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.909
 specific circumstances in which 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:40.680
 vandalism was perpetrated and from 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:42.899
 from there the judge will decide by stating that 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.640
 some of them individually or 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.329
 collectively can be declared 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.070
 responsible 

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:49.020
 he does not have a better precision 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.610
 since these are the parents theory that 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.079
 are responsible it means that this 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.939
 are the parents who will pay the 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.920
 bill where it also depends on their 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:57.090
 own insurance then from this point of 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.680
 see there all the multi-risk contracts 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.420
 house has a guarantee 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.680
 Liability Insurance 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.100
 parents on behalf of their children 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.590
 minors 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.930
 that is to say that this provision 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.610
 allows all parents to 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.750
 to be able to turn to their company 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.489
 insurance to make a declaration of 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.569
 And these are the experts of 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:13.560
 this nation company what they 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:15.630
 meet with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.250
 this father of the town hall owner of 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.569
 school that has been damaged or has 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.290
 is the subject of scandals of these acts 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.670
 vandalism 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.890
 once the experts have proceeded 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:24.120
 to these assessments and well the share of 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:25.980
 each will be determined in terms of 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:27.239
 responsibility by ensuring them at the threshold 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.920
 and procrastinate a bit for 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.269
 technical reasons for trying to 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.650
 not take care of all the 

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.480
 claims because there assumptions 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.700
 in which where some parents do not 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.319
 are not insured and the responsibility 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.640
 as sometimes collective it can happen 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:42.260
 that some parents have to pay 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.260
 on behalf of others
