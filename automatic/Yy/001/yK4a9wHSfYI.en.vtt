00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.790
 of receipt since it is almost impossible 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:09.729
 but 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:11.790
 there is a trick to be able to do it 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.020
 this is in case your secret departure year after your pc is bad and they want it 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:16.680
 formative 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.710
 with whom to play that game we have behaved 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.890
 in this buoys video tutorial 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.539
 demonstrate what files we have that keep 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.130
 in the next tutorial I'm going to show 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.809
 creating a game isern and andorra 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:36.239
 so they can see that this game that I saved serves I hope to see it all 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.500
 tutorials friends and comment good 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.680
 percent the first thing I'm going to do is create a living document rather a 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.050
 ki-moon card 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:47.230
 we are going to live 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:50.550
 ap documents in the documents is found 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.450
 a folder that is macaque that was created by default when we installed the 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.370
 game 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.590
 then country c 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.000
 created a folder 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.590
 good in this folder are the data that debuted organ but these 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.740
 data was supplemented 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:12.240
 another most important file is that we give the border not only this 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.409
 these files that we must remember that we are important are those that help 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:19.660
 that these two was bought 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:21.050
 they can work 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.160
 but cook this is not shown is present this one of a folder hide what 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.370
 what we have to do is 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.960
 put folder options and show those folders hide 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:34.190
 that's why I'm going to go ap khar 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:37.690
 of all of them and I'm going to put quinteros to look like an option is 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.440
 the folder options 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.890
 and this menu does not appear 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:44.610
 here in the option see 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.600
 camagüey ain here files and folders or hidden and I will select the option 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.799
 show folders files and hidden drives 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.920
 here I give you click here I put you apply and accept 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.280
 now I will see the folder that is hidden that contains 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.480
 the 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.560
 records 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.470
 that are going to make me work these well I will minimize this because after 

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:12.150
 let's copy we're going to go now well our pc 

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:14.120
 to the team 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.409
 mikkelsen 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:16.759
 panty 

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:17.799
 playful 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:19.110
 to a folder 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.159
 call users 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.849
 in the folder called users we are going to go 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.319
 to a folder with the name of our administrator herminio this knows 

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:34.209
 now in that folder we are going to look like a folder that was not there 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:39.499
 hidden but there it is we are not going to click here now a folder that 

00:02:39.499 --> 00:02:40.759
 local flame 

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.629
 then 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:45.650
 in that place we are going to find a folder that is mom and I 

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:47.819
 and what is wrong but we do not act 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.909
 now at this higher cost in that part so we're going to go to a folder that 

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.119
 be x 

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:55.539
 pixar law 

00:02:55.539 --> 00:02:58.029
 this is called exp 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:00.589
 where the information is quartered 

00:03:00.589 --> 00:03:03.739
 more important to be able to save the game 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.139
 if you for being cured case 

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.629
 it does not affect them 

00:03:08.629 --> 00:03:10.109
 the match 

00:03:10.109 --> 00:03:12.329
 After all I'm going to give you 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.859
 I suggest that 

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.779

00:03:15.779 --> 00:03:17.759

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:19.919
 I can paste it after 

00:03:19.919 --> 00:03:22.919
 holland crazy account

 the file that we are going to save highlight 3 we are going to go to the folder 

00:03:28.179 --> 00:03:30.229
 of complete content 

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:35.229
 and this is the most important file these files we can have that 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:36.309
 rescue 

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:39.459
 this is what is in this part 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:41.809
 good as a retina 

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:44.809
 let's go there accompanied 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.859
 and this afternoon we have to keep this folder 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:52.109
 we keep it 

00:03:52.109 --> 00:03:54.059
 put copy 

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.059
 i 2 polanski 

00:03:59.389 --> 00:04:02.389
 I copy of that we are going to go with these documents 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.149
 in these documents let's copy this 

00:04:06.149 --> 00:04:09.349
 the two previous files 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.649
 the eighth 

00:04:10.649 --> 00:04:12.769
 here is my car 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:14.059
 there is already 

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.870
 for here 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:19.079
 we can save our game eye this takes goats that I have stuck here the 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.560
 you have to put back where you got it from and this file also has 

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:27.809
 where it causes expensive so much eye to where they put them park work well 

00:04:29.469 --> 00:04:31.800
 now friends 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.819
 eye if by chance 

00:04:34.819 --> 00:04:37.069
 yes because I do case mills 

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:38.659
 yes ported case 

00:04:38.659 --> 00:04:44.689
 I did not give them these files when they already fulfilled this, I suggest 

00:04:44.689 --> 00:04:48.150
 copy all the folder that is I wanted to law 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:50.870
 I wanted to give him a foot where he is 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:52.699
 and it was to explain again 

00:04:52.699 --> 00:04:56.139
 in this sense josé d the user 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.969
 you are right arteta is called tolosa 

00:04:58.969 --> 00:05:01.719
 rocha carpetita that were not shown tata 

00:05:01.719 --> 00:05:05.110
 then the local the country course 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.509
 in the sea and crossed until this 

00:05:07.509 --> 00:05:11.469
 and then the court folder that is dispensable by his deputy k are 

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:12.009
 annoying 

00:05:12.009 --> 00:05:16.199
 this works with this because this is tested as windows view and 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.379
 windows 7 

00:05:17.379 --> 00:05:21.960
 peron not so 100% with stories xp but good 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.960
 in fact their way is always going to work for them somewhere good case 

00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:28.960
 friends this first corrals tutorial 

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:33.900
 he said he sees in the other so that pitiot complements that I'm going to create 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.779
 a new departure 

00:05:35.779 --> 00:05:38.599
 to show them that it works 

00:05:38.599 --> 00:05:39.530
 or what good
