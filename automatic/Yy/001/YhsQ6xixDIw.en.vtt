00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:07.259
 hi fishermen today i want you 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.309
 show how to make winter gear 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.339
 for perch fishing 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:12.210
 titled noodle today we will 

00:00:11.339 --> 00:00:15.599
 to make notions 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.290
 with a double here I already put beads on 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:19.260
 hook 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:20.150
 wound a red thread can be worn 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.160
 cambric 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:27.390
 I had a brighter thread I wound 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:29.490
 no that's what beads beads i think not 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.100
 worth showing how to wear it very 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:39.449
 just made the weights through the hole 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.910
 Side weights can be used differently. 

00:00:39.449 --> 00:00:45.690
 you can use large weights 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:51.149
 less and so let's start here I have 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.230
 such winter spinning explain il how 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:59.659
 who calls homemade now we have it 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:03.390
 we will equip we take the main line 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:03.870
 we put on it here is such a 100 threshold 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.570
 such 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.290
 me dinner stop lesson worn as before 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:13.460
 there was a noodle with a double unfortunately 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:21.690
 I cut off the threshold 

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:25.670
 Now we put on our twin here and 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.350
 diesel double dress up bead 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.740
 so that the double does not slide off on itself 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.740
 noodle 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:48.840
 in this money we have a bead thats all now 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.900
 100 threshold twins bead pulling 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:58.460
 a little bit towards eve I need 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.460
 Now we dress the hook like this 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:12.649
 chok we dress our shit 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.649
 and dress the second hook 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:25.510
 This is what we should design 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:30.090
 get the noodle itself can be done and 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.090
 without double well with double more efficient 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:43.230
 now we make a knot we take the line twice 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:43.230
 and tie a double knot sofa 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:54.300
 disintegration pain noodle 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:57.880
 once again we go there 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:03:00.400
 2 here is the node 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.240
 it tightens somewhere in two or three 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:12.730
 centimeter from the very baldy this is so 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:16.420
 we get a node and you need to moisten 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:18.220
 I tightened the wet and tightened the knot like this 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:23.880
 somewhere through centimeter 3 we 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.880
 turned out noodle no need end cut off 

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:36.310
 that's all tackle ready now we look like 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.730
 our hook will look here 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.760
 bead and double double 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:45.850
 on the noodle itself does not fall when fishing 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.870
 we move our 100 rocks away somewhere on 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:55.440
 30 centimeters from our bullshit 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:57.700
 so I pushed the tactic of catching this we 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:04:01.210
 hit our noodle on the bottom 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:02.950
 she raised the dregs and this dregs very 

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:06.990
 strongly reacts okay 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:09.240
 and at this time when we raised the noodle and 

00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:13.780
 knocked 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:16.090
 the hooks will fall like this and that 

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:18.340
 will attract the perch in the same way 

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.989
 this double hook will be lowered by 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.190
 fishing line 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:27.400
 this attract the perch here we knocked 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:30.760
 handles play dregs rose five seconds 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.960
 we pause the line accordingly we hold 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:34.750
 stretch on the noodle 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.330
 leave at the bottom here but five passed 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.830
 seconds did not hit 

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:42.420
 5 seconds pause, and again still caught 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.950
 perch 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:51.960
 perch is caught very well the main thing on 

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:55.550
 bang the hole all 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.770
