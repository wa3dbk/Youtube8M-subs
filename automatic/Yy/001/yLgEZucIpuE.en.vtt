Wilson<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.600> 93<00:01:41.229> overall<00:01:41.770> since<00:01:42.670> he's<00:01:42.970> 511

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:44.180 
Wilson the 93 overall since he's 511

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:45.790 
Wilson the 93 overall since he's 511
but<00:01:44.330> doesn't<00:01:44.510> respect<00:01:44.960> him<00:01:45.170> for<00:01:45.590> and

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
but doesn't respect him for and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.130 
but doesn't respect him for and
tell<00:01:45.950> me<00:01:46.100> here<00:01:46.340> that<00:01:46.580> they<00:01:47.540> don't<00:01:47.720> feel<00:01:47.900> like

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
tell me here that they don't feel like

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.410

he's<00:01:48.410> gonna<00:01:48.560> be<00:01:48.680> good<00:01:49.100> i<00:01:49.130> guess<00:01:49.520> so<00:01:49.700> he<00:01:49.850> has<00:01:49.970> 86

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
he's gonna be good i guess so he has 86

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.090 
he's gonna be good i guess so he has 86
feet<00:01:50.750> so<00:01:50.930> he's<00:01:51.050> gonna<00:01:51.170> be<00:01:51.320> one<00:01:51.470> of<00:01:51.500> the<00:01:51.620> fastest

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
feet so he's gonna be one of the fastest

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.040 
feet so he's gonna be one of the fastest
