00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in legal 152 we are going to start 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:07.109
 practice the capital letter s for 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:08.639
 begin to practice our is 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.440
 capital letter let's take into account the 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.269
 next recommendation 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:16.020
 the first scale s part of the line 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 of the screed co with a long curved line 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.199
 and as beautiful as possible 3 so long 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.550
 curve and pronounced 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.189
 that is the line with which it begins 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.289
 our our s s make our first 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.000
 let's say let's do it in 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.030
 several times s do the first of 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.309
 those the second time the second line 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:39.860
 it's a curve up here we should have 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:42.410
 special care that we left was like this 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:44.690
 we must be careful that this part 

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.700
 superior, we do not have too much 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.370
 the first line for example should not 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:51.470
 stay neither too high nor too 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.170
 lying down and once we make the curve 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.559
 up there should not be too much 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.020
 big must try to stay 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:03.620
 more or less with that shape neither so 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.170
 thin with one from Libya but yes with 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:08.720
 this way with this form we can avoid 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:10.580
 make these mistakes once we make 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.690
 our second time you should have 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:13.250
 this inclination or inclination 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.770
 characteristic of our letters 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.840
 we must do everything possible to prevent 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.820
 that second time we left too much or 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:23.930
 vertical or that we stay too 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.040
 too much lying our second 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.600
 time then it must be with that 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:28.970
 tilt one we got here we're going to 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:32.509
 do four more times until the sixth 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:34.040
 we have 12 and we are going to complete six 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:36.310
 times counting four points then 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.310
 we make 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:47.540
 23 same is our law erpin has a 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:51.050
 time two three four five and six 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:54.200
 times to our exercise 52 we should 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:56.479
 perform 16 times that exercise of the 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.580
 letter forgiveness 18 times is exceptional 

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.580
 letter s in 60 seconds
