the xc70 this is really a designer's

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.180 
the xc70 this is really a designer's
dream<00:00:34.490> when<00:00:35.090> you're<00:00:35.360> working<00:00:35.780> with<00:00:35.990> cars<00:00:36.350> to

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
dream when you're working with cars to

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:39.430 
dream when you're working with cars to
take<00:00:37.460> a<00:00:37.490> car<00:00:37.970> and<00:00:38.000> just<00:00:38.390> blow<00:00:38.750> up<00:00:38.960> all<00:00:39.200> the

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
take a car and just blow up all the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.980 
take a car and just blow up all the
strong<00:00:39.860> features<00:00:40.430> the<00:00:40.940> fridges<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:41.690> front

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
strong features the fridges of the front

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:44.140 
strong features the fridges of the front
the<00:00:42.350> big<00:00:42.560> wheels<00:00:42.890> and<00:00:43.430> everything<00:00:43.850> we<00:00:43.970> have<00:00:44.120> on

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:44.150 
the big wheels and everything we have on

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.510 
the big wheels and everything we have on
the<00:00:44.420> exit<00:00:44.660> 70<00:00:45.110> I<00:00:45.230> think<00:00:45.740> it<00:00:45.980> adds<00:00:46.160> a<00:00:46.250> lot<00:00:46.370> of

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
the exit 70 I think it adds a lot of

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:48.460 
the exit 70 I think it adds a lot of
emotion<00:00:47.000> to<00:00:47.180> it<00:00:47.210> I<00:00:47.420> think<00:00:47.450> during<00:00:48.110> the<00:00:48.290> normal

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
emotion to it I think during the normal

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.800 
emotion to it I think during the normal
engineering<00:00:49.070> process<00:00:49.610> sometimes<00:00:50.570> we'll<00:00:50.690> have

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:50.810 
engineering process sometimes we'll have

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.080 
engineering process sometimes we'll have
the<00:00:50.900> emotional<00:00:51.080> is<00:00:51.560> lost<00:00:51.920> or<00:00:52.220> it's<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:52.760> then

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:53.090 
the emotional is lost or it's and then

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.430 
the emotional is lost or it's and then
having<00:00:53.330> a<00:00:53.390> project<00:00:53.750> like<00:00:53.810> this<00:00:53.870> that's<00:00:54.200> very

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
having a project like this that's very

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.740 
having a project like this that's very
exciting<00:00:54.740> it<00:00:55.460> reminds<00:00:55.970> us<00:00:56.090> of<00:00:56.120> you<00:00:56.450> know<00:00:56.540> how

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:56.750 
exciting it reminds us of you know how

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.500 
exciting it reminds us of you know how
fun<00:00:57.050> it<00:00:57.170> is<00:00:57.260> to<00:00:57.320> design<00:00:57.590> a<00:00:57.740> car<00:00:58.150> and<00:00:59.150> it's<00:00:59.360> no

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
fun it is to design a car and it's no

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.420 
fun it is to design a car and it's no
coincidence<00:00:59.750> that<00:01:00.440> it<00:01:00.740> actually<00:01:00.860> became<00:01:01.370> a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:01.430 
coincidence that it actually became a

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.359 
coincidence that it actually became a
surf<00:01:01.760> rescue<00:01:02.000> safety<00:01:02.690> when<00:01:03.350> I<00:01:03.590> started<00:01:04.250> the

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
surf rescue safety when I started the

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.910 
surf rescue safety when I started the
research<00:01:04.580> about<00:01:05.150> what's<00:01:05.420> emma<00:01:05.720> is<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:06.710> how<00:01:06.860> we

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
research about what's emma is and how we

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.190 
research about what's emma is and how we
could<00:01:07.189> stand<00:01:07.430> out<00:01:07.670> there<00:01:07.939> I<00:01:08.150> also<00:01:08.689> tried<00:01:09.080> to

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:09.200 
could stand out there I also tried to

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.470 
could stand out there I also tried to
find<00:01:09.440> a<00:01:09.590> theme<00:01:09.620> that<00:01:10.190> would<00:01:10.730> really<00:01:10.940> help<00:01:11.210> us

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
find a theme that would really help us

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:14.350 
find a theme that would really help us
to<00:01:11.810> to<00:01:12.530> bring<00:01:12.770> out<00:01:12.980> everything<00:01:13.520> in<00:01:13.670> the<00:01:13.760> xc70

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:14.360 
to to bring out everything in the xc70

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.190 
to to bring out everything in the xc70
we<00:01:14.660> have<00:01:14.870> this<00:01:15.490> off-road<00:01:16.490> yshkar<00:01:17.200> combination

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
we have this off-road yshkar combination

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.010 
we have this off-road yshkar combination
in<00:01:18.380> the<00:01:18.590> Indy<00:01:19.070> xc70<00:01:19.730> and<00:01:20.090> we<00:01:20.690> have<00:01:20.870> this

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:21.020 
in the Indy xc70 and we have this

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.390 
in the Indy xc70 and we have this
connection<00:01:21.230> to<00:01:21.590> surfing<00:01:22.370> and<00:01:22.820> adventure<00:01:23.540> and

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
connection to surfing and adventure and

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.160 
connection to surfing and adventure and
then<00:01:25.400> I<00:01:25.430> started<00:01:25.820> looking<00:01:25.940> for<00:01:26.450> professions

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
then I started looking for professions

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.520 
then I started looking for professions
that<00:01:27.409> could<00:01:27.830> be<00:01:28.810> connected<00:01:29.810> to<00:01:30.140> volvo

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
that could be connected to volvo

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.530 
that could be connected to volvo
something<00:01:31.250> that<00:01:31.370> would<00:01:31.490> feel<00:01:31.760> positive<00:01:32.330> and

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
something that would feel positive and

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
cool and lifeguards and self-rescue felt

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.380 
cool and lifeguards and self-rescue felt
like<00:01:36.770> a<00:01:36.800> really<00:01:37.100> cool<00:01:37.430> and<00:01:37.670> positive<00:01:38.060> theme

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
like a really cool and positive theme

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.930 
like a really cool and positive theme
that<00:01:38.630> works<00:01:38.900> well<00:01:39.140> with<00:01:39.350> volvo<00:01:40.070> slogan<00:01:40.580> volvo

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
the xc70 surf rescue safety was a pretty

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.899 
the xc70 surf rescue safety was a pretty
fast<00:01:46.940> process<00:01:47.890> we<00:01:48.890> collaborated<00:01:49.760> with

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:49.909 
fast process we collaborated with

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:52.930 
fast process we collaborated with
Volvo's<00:01:50.810> designers<00:01:51.409> in<00:01:51.740> Sweden<00:01:52.340> and<00:01:52.520> also

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:52.940 
Volvo's designers in Sweden and also

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:56.260 
Volvo's designers in Sweden and also
here<00:01:53.210> in<00:01:53.470> California<00:01:54.470> and<00:01:54.880> they<00:01:55.880> came<00:01:56.060> up<00:01:56.120> with

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
here in California and they came up with

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.630 
here in California and they came up with
a<00:01:56.390> concept<00:01:56.479> of<00:01:57.080> being<00:01:57.260> a<00:01:57.409> surf<00:01:57.680> rescue<00:01:57.979> vehicle

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
a concept of being a surf rescue vehicle

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.020 
a concept of being a surf rescue vehicle
our<00:01:59.110> part<00:02:00.110> in<00:02:00.320> the<00:02:00.470> program<00:02:00.860> was<00:02:01.100> to<00:02:01.400> help<00:02:01.729> them

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
our part in the program was to help them

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.469 
our part in the program was to help them
execute<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:03.140> concept<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.820> the<00:02:04.940> fact<00:02:05.119> is<00:02:05.299> that

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:05.479 
execute the concept and the fact is that

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:07.359 
execute the concept and the fact is that
many<00:02:05.869> people<00:02:06.290> have<00:02:06.380> already<00:02:06.530> said<00:02:06.950> that<00:02:07.250> this
