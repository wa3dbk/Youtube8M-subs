00:00:48.744 --> 00:00:50.464
Wait, Ven!

00:00:52.493 --> 00:00:54.773
Oh, no! We must stop Ven!

00:00:59.188 --> 00:01:00.828
Bring Ven back!

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:03.289
I give you my word.

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.820
Mademoiselle! Senorita!

00:03:02.885 --> 00:03:04.285
Please wait!

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.029
Aqua!

00:03:08.933 --> 00:03:10.013
Terra!

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.210
Ven has left on a journey.

00:03:15.303 --> 00:03:16.383
Ven has?

00:03:17.021 --> 00:03:19.621
It seems he was trying to follow you. 

00:03:19.694 --> 00:03:21.094
Have you seen him around?

00:03:21.175 --> 00:03:22.175
No.

00:03:24.423 --> 00:03:29.823
Now that you mention it, it seemed like he wanted to tell me something when I was leaving.

00:03:30.561 --> 00:03:33.041
I should have listened to him...

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:34.229
I see...

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:40.037
By the way, have you found Master Xehanort yet?

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:45.490
It seems he's investigating the princesses of pure heart.

00:03:45.853 --> 00:03:49.093
Princesses of pure heart?

00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:53.525
It doesn't look like Master Xehanort is in this world.

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.080
Oh.

00:03:56.077 --> 00:03:58.677
Well, I'm going to investigate this world a bit more.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.160
Then, you should try speaking with the prince in the main hall.

00:04:04.692 --> 00:04:05.772
Got it.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:07.773
Aqua.

00:04:09.166 --> 00:04:11.846
Do you remember our dream?

00:04:12.821 --> 00:04:15.421
Uh, yeah.

00:04:16.418 --> 00:04:25.018
There's a girl in this world named Cinderella who taught me how strong the heart can be when it believes in dreams.

00:04:25.056 --> 00:04:28.616
We all have to keep believing in our dreams.

00:04:28.874 --> 00:04:31.474
They'll become our strength to destroy the darkness.

00:04:31.485 --> 00:04:33.125
Yeah.

00:04:34.576 --> 00:04:37.256
If you see Cinderella, thank her for me.

00:04:37.272 --> 00:04:38.592
I will.

00:04:43.474 --> 00:04:47.114
Just as I thought, there's no way Terra will fall to darkness.
