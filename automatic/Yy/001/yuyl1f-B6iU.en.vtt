the<00:03:42.670> only<00:03:43.000> downside<00:03:43.480> to<00:03:43.720> this<00:03:43.840> brush<00:03:44.170> is<00:03:44.470> that

the only downside to this brush is that

00:03:44.799 --> 00:03:47.070 
the only downside to this brush is that
it's<00:03:45.099> pretty<00:03:45.459> small<00:03:45.879> so<00:03:46.209> it<00:03:46.330> may<00:03:46.510> take<00:03:46.540> a<00:03:46.810> while

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:47.080 
it's pretty small so it may take a while

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
to do your entire face but it's also

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:51.899 
to do your entire face but it's also
great<00:03:50.110> for<00:03:50.319> getting<00:03:50.379> in<00:03:50.830> the<00:03:51.220> corners<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.760> your

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:51.909

great for getting in the corners of your
nose<00:03:52.269> and<00:03:52.299> small<00:03:52.959> areas<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:58.599> strobe<00:03:58.930> cream
