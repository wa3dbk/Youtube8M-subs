00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.460
 disguised outside a party 

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.510
 surely it was a cosplay cosplay in the 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.940
 sum of the words 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.310
 costume play and you want to say 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.660
 interpretation of kraft 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.660
 and j 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.330
 already 

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:40.540
 very large universe is used because it 

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.130
 we have another name to put it but in 

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:45.480
 actually the word otaku in japan 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.480
 it means sick 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.510
 attorney 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.260
 as an extra kill character he built that 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.260
 what trips do 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.719
 on the street 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.719
 because they tell you 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.369
 because they chose that form 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.400
 but because there were no vision problems 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.780
 other 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.780
 many people like it 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:28.350
 what the fuck is happening 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.490
 now 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.150
 they are parts 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:53.490
 take a picture then the others 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.090
 of the transition 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:02.680
 when when I came here for example 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:06.530
 to the event see this group has been 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.479
 because there are many intolerant people and you 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.360
 they can do has happened to me even 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:13.800
 being with 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:18.590
 normal clothes for me and what 

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.590
 it bothers me that they have tried to give me 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:27.990
 and why not 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:31.710
 also a very old video game the 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.280
 videogame 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:36.390
 and it's a night game 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.950
 how 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:39.569
 street workers by a 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.600
 way but they fight or defend their 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:41.600
 territory 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:55.930
 I come with my passion 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.680
 to that big pressure 

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.480
 that 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.430
 a whole family of the entire passage 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.109
 meteor 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.799
 to buscats and if your mom when they see you 

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.799
 with all that costume 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.790
 they already know 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:16.480
 I have a hobby in which what I do 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:16.480
 I do for dads' sake too 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:23.880
 some take themselves too seriously 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:25.500
 character like this girl that you think 

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.640
 noting me in a book can have the 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.640
 power to cause death 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.260
 I'm going to die 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:49.959
 heart attack
