00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440
 Hello everyone, this time we are going to 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.510
 study the first skin shirt 

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:12.480
 thermal alpha blanket because it's a 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.500
 first skin shirt because it has the 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.109
 following qualities that are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.690
 fundamental for this layer in the first 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.010
 place they have to be soft to the touch if 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.800
 It is a garment that is in contact with 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:26.010
 the skin and it has to be comfortable in this 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.260
 case we can see that it is a plain garment 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.109
 soft that does not generate any kind of 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.260
 discomfort in contact with the skin in 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:37.440
 second place a first skin garment 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.329
 as in this case this shirt has 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.450
 to be breathable because breathable 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.700
 because he has to evacuate the 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.490
 perspiration that is generated in 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.000
 activity 

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:52.100
 and thirdly it has to be a 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.920
 fast drying garment yes and in this 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:57.020
 case this shirt has fibers 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.600
 synthetics that absorb very little 

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:04.910
 humidity or do not do it so that it 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:07.310
 they dry very quickly this one avoids the 

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:10.640
 moisture contact with the skin or what 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.860
 minimizes avoiding the consequent 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.310
 cold sensation that generates humidity 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:17.540
 last and this is a property 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.760
 important to add to the properties 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:27.200
 thermal as we can see is its texture 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.820
 is made up of small cells that 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.190
 they generate a small film of air and 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:36.140
 protective that the air to be a very bad 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.330
 thermal conductor what it does is 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.220
 maximize the thermal properties by 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.810
 Therefore , this is a quality that do not have 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.410
 all thermal shirts first 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.080
 skin and that is very important this for 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.869
 to maximize the thermal properties 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.300
 finally this is a very garment 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:56.110
 versatile 

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.940
 for for author use on the mountain in 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:02:01.410
 trekking in cold places but also 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:05.110
 It is a garment that is very advisable 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:07.840
 for urban use under shirts below 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:10.720
 of clothing clothes given with very little 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:16.300
 opened with a very light garment one 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:19.410
 It increases the power of shelter a lot 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.150
 in the clothes that are wearing many 

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:24.970
 executives use them under their 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.220
 many shirts will wear them under their 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:29.590
 divers and also uses it of course the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.980
 people who go out to the middle to develop 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.980
 the activities
