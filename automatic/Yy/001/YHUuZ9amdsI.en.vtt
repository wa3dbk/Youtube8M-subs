00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
to expand and just break the entire

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:34.399 
to expand and just break the entire
building<00:06:32.370> that<00:06:32.909> to<00:06:33.090> me<00:06:33.240> that<00:06:33.750> was<00:06:33.930> just<00:06:34.050> a<00:06:34.259> bit

00:06:34.399 --> 00:06:34.409 
building that to me that was just a bit

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.709 
building that to me that was just a bit
redundant<00:06:34.620> but<00:06:35.099> okay<00:06:35.580> i<00:06:35.610> can<00:06:35.759> understand<00:06:36.360> why

00:06:36.709 --> 00:06:36.719 
redundant but okay i can understand why

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:38.959 
redundant but okay i can understand why
they<00:06:36.990> did<00:06:37.169> it<00:06:37.199> they<00:06:37.500> don't<00:06:38.009> really<00:06:38.370> trust<00:06:38.639> him

00:06:38.959 --> 00:06:38.969 
they did it they don't really trust him

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:43.430 
they did it they don't really trust him
at<00:06:39.060> this<00:06:39.210> point<00:06:39.539> he<00:06:40.380> did<00:06:41.039> help<00:06:41.639> them<00:06:41.880> in<00:06:42.440> Creole

II<00:06:43.560> helped<00:06:44.520> them<00:06:44.669> in<00:06:45.300> that<00:06:45.509> fight<00:06:45.810> but<00:06:46.409> still

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:46.770 
II helped them in that fight but still

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:49.839 
II helped them in that fight but still
that<00:06:47.070> they<00:06:47.280> need<00:06:47.729> to<00:06:47.759> take<00:06:48.030> some<00:06:48.330> precautions

00:06:49.839 --> 00:06:49.849 
that they need to take some precautions

00:06:49.849 --> 00:06:53.029 
that they need to take some precautions
also<00:06:50.849> what<00:06:51.030> I<00:06:51.360> really<00:06:51.630> like<00:06:51.840> is<00:06:52.110> when<00:06:52.650> he<00:06:52.889> was

this and then you see that that face

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.350 
this and then you see that that face
then<00:06:58.409> that<00:06:58.590> face<00:06:58.889> you<00:06:59.310> would<00:06:59.460> say<00:06:59.580> like<00:06:59.729> a<00:06:59.969> face

00:07:28.129 --> 00:07:28.139 
judging from the preview of the next

00:07:28.139 --> 00:07:29.870 
judging from the preview of the next
episode<00:07:28.620> it<00:07:28.800> seems<00:07:29.099> that<00:07:29.190> it's<00:07:29.460> going<00:07:29.610> to<00:07:29.729> be

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:29.880 
episode it seems that it's going to be

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.800 
episode it seems that it's going to be
like<00:07:30.630> a<00:07:30.690> you<00:07:31.259> can<00:07:31.440> say<00:07:31.560> like<00:07:31.710> a<00:07:31.740> flashback

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:32.810 
like a you can say like a flashback

00:07:32.810 --> 00:07:36.379 
like a you can say like a flashback
episode<00:07:33.810> so<00:07:34.800> I<00:07:35.009> probably<00:07:35.610> won't<00:07:35.789> do<00:07:36.060> a<00:07:36.090> review

00:07:36.379 --> 00:07:36.389 
episode so I probably won't do a review

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.480

00:07:40.850 --> 00:07:40.860 
like filler episodes or flashback

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:43.400 
like filler episodes or flashback
