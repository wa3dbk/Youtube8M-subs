00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:11.670 
by using another object okay so

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.180 
by using another object okay so
everything<00:00:11.880> inside<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.990> need<00:00:13.200> to<00:00:13.440> make<00:00:13.950> the

this tutorial I'm going to make my own

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.029 
this tutorial I'm going to make my own
object<00:00:19.670> but<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.699> can<00:00:21.000> just<00:00:21.270> use<00:00:21.510> any<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:22.529> the

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
object but you can just use any of the

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.470 
object but you can just use any of the
default<00:00:23.580> objects<00:00:24.420> so<00:00:25.289> if<00:00:25.769> you<00:00:25.949> are<00:00:26.430> not<00:00:27.090> going

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.460 
default objects so if you are not going
to<00:00:27.570> use<00:00:28.849> my<00:00:29.849> object<00:00:30.300> then<00:00:30.689> you<00:00:30.929> can<00:00:31.109> skip<00:00:31.349> the

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
to use my object then you can skip the

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.380 
to use my object then you can skip the
video<00:00:31.610> to<00:00:32.610> the<00:00:32.790> main<00:00:32.940> part<00:00:33.829> okay<00:00:34.829> so<00:00:35.760> first<00:00:36.210> of
