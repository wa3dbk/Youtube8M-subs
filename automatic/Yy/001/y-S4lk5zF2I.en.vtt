00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
put it back in it you have to line it up

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.970 
put it back in it you have to line it up
and<00:05:41.330> then<00:05:42.330> you<00:05:42.450> have<00:05:42.570> to<00:05:42.690> push<00:05:43.410> this<00:05:43.650> thing

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:47.900 
and then you have to push this thing
back<00:05:44.150> and<00:05:45.590> then<00:05:46.590> plus<00:05:47.040> for<00:05:47.460> that<00:05:47.610> that

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:47.910 
back and then plus for that that

00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:52.250 
back and then plus for that that
adjustment<00:05:48.510> on<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.980> right<00:05:50.430> here<00:05:51.050> there's<00:05:52.050> a

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260 
adjustment on the right here there's a

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:57.290 
adjustment on the right here there's a
little<00:05:52.560> knob<00:05:53.520> thing<00:05:54.110> and<00:05:55.190> that<00:05:56.190> leads<00:05:57.000> for

00:05:57.290 --> 00:05:57.300 
little knob thing and that leads for

00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:59.540
