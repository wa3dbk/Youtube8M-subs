00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.770
 the garden video point comes my name 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.730
 Markus is planed and had our theme 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:11.099
 Japanese azalea königstein 

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.190
 now it is a kind of something else 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:15.990
 style she is not light pink dark pink 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.750
 like other Japanese stocks but 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.570
 This has this beautiful purple 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.640
 Violet color in blooming something else 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.260
 is more intense and then a little lighter 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:27.900
 will be in april 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.510
 Also , the leaves are slightly larger 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.679
 fresh leaves like now in the spring 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.600
 be formed and are soft 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.340
 and also the older leaves in the 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.110
 last summer were formed and over 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.629
 helped the winter and now then 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.480
 are slowly disappearing one speaks 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.340
 therefore also with the japanese shares 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.020
 from half evergreen plants or from 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.829
 winter green plants because it's just that 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.140
 change foliage 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.739
 unlike the normal rollbar 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.129
 or where the leaves are several years old 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:57.719
 outlast special sure the 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:59.670
 the bell-shaped flowers are also something 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.100
 is larger than other Japanese 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:08.060
 tell and as with many others 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.250
 it has a purple in red 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.200
 intensive drawing one partially 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.780
 but he does not see it 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.090
 this japanese a10 is this one 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.799
 drawing there on the top chrome sheet 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.799
 to see very clearly 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.600
 like other japanese stocks is too 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.280
 something prone to winter sun should 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.170
 they planted in shadow household 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.060
 will protect in the winter with times 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.110
 30 against the all too strong 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:36.510
 solar radiation 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.700
 because that can lead to different 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.380
 why because the ground is frozen and 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.720
 the few leaves that still remained 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.000
 These leathery leaves are her down 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.470
 the water continues to evaporate and 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.410
 can damage the plants as 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.360
 correspond to sunlight in the 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.920
 Winter protect most winter 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.990
 Divorces do not come from the cold 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.550
 but from the heat and from the sun 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.190
 This also applies to the Japanese 

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:00.240
 stocks and in particular for the variety 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.790
 königstein 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.250
 It is about 50 60 centimeters high 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.440
 slightly wider than high 60 70 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:10.229
 centimeters and is for under limit 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:12.360
 The bog is considered the most suitable 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.230
 because you have another intense color 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.490
 brings in as the other Japanese 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.050
 parcels try it out in their 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:20.640
 garden write your experience and 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.620
 into the video if you already 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.660
 experience with the kind of king stone 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.340
 the other garden friends did 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.690
 be thankful if you have yours 

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.580
 Tell us your experiences are the 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.250
 Specialist victory has the experience 

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.930
 and believe she does not have all that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.269
 i trust you on yours 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.880

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:41.239
 with other encounters they will 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.239
 continue
