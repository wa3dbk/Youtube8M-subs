00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:06.029
 hello for the fanatic he wants to tell you 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.510
 that only in the comments analysis of 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.250
 celtics match 0 maribor 1 in the party 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.080
 of description in this same video that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.900
 you are listening to us now you have the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.930
 link below to enter to see the goal of the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 match the goal scored by marcos magno 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:24.600
 morals 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.670
 Tabarez scored the goal of the match 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:32.579
 while the seventh I felt that there was 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:35.190
 tied 1 to 1 the first match and 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.540
 I had to go find the result because 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.870
 I was home and it's a big team 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:42.570
 there is a ball that takes out blue in 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.300
 the defender of the maribor as soon as he started 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.219
 the match on the line practically by 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.960
 the central marker while the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:52.800
 maribor warned with a shot from 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.570
 outside ibrahim and a strong finish that 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.570
 took out the left-handed 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.550
 and it passes near the stick it keeps responding 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.590
 the maribor that attacked and did not stop 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.950
 attack but is still standing in defense 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:11.770
 the celtic but worried with auction 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:14.050
 from outside the visiting team 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.180
 while he tried to Celtic 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.570
 hit with a header that were not very 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.570
 clear 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:26.009
 and they could not specify the centers that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.009
 they arrived 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:33.539
 I'm not going to specify the ambrus player 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:36.630
 neither virgil by the good ones 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.270
 centers that stretched quiet and johansen 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.920
 not among other anthony video games 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:45.030
 stokes that is the best player of the 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 celtic at number 10 in the figure does 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.649
 several seasons later there was a for 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.229
 I brought you a chromatic ine in the 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.119
 left out ben gordon is very good 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.909
 that the celtic that had been told to 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 Earlier this transfer market that 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:03.000
 could the goalkeeper get to Barcelona 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:09.020
 number 26 finishes the auction that came 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.020
 from the left and hit the ball 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.960
 mÃ©ndy and could not enter after the 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.790
 rebound and had a double reaction the 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.860
 archer afterwards through a center that 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:21.070
 came from the tops they could not lash out 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.440
 the centers now under a good hairstyle 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.370
 and again the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.940
 central marker 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.490
 virgin 

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:30.710
 and it was all all decent and that the 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.110
 clearer moves were of the sense with 

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:35.300
 a shot that grows on the crossbar and 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:38.270
 the maribor was going to save the party 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.070
 was tied in the overall 11 from 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:42.320
 a good move stocks that you are going 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.540
 to see what a crack was 

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.760
 crossbar 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.200
 and could not convert the both of 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.359
 match 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:53.810
 mcgregor who had noticed the first 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:55.760
 both in the first leg and already as they 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.219
 I said it was all outside the celtic 

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.329
 they were getting nervous because they were not 

00:02:58.219 --> 00:03:04.939
 could stretch the global and the maribor the 

00:03:02.329 --> 00:03:08.819
 first I had I could not leave out 

00:03:04.939 --> 00:03:11.400
 the first chance on the planet 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.770
 I could leave the celtic outside, so 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.350
 they had tied in 1 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:20.380
 and the celtic was looking 

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:22.540
 with much impetus to score the goal for 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.210
 stay much calmer but when going 

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:26.500
 to look for it and be deconcentrated in 

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:28.840
 defending 

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:31.420
 mcgregor saved his parents two or three 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.190
 sometimes with auctions from outside and with a 

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.170
 serious error in the defense that the 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.620
 central marker went out of the 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.810
 area to mark the forward who is a 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.780
 space inside the midfielder and you 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:47.260
 break the bow to mcgregor can not 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:49.690
 express the defense they were trying to get it out 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.390
 the marker is removed from the marker 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.310
 he puts her in the middle of the area they could not 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.830
 the midfielders until the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:03.730
 friend of the front frames magnos him 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.670
 He hits the ball and puts the goal of the 

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:09.280
 maribor that leaves it out the celtic one 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.100
 by zero you want to kill the celtic the 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.410
 largest team in your country is 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.290
 expressed more the ball with the hairstyle 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.220
 they could not get the midfielders and 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.220
 came the both 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.139
 great frame that gave the result 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.010
 definitive to the match the 1 for 0 we 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:32.860
 it marked the 74 minutes of the match it 

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.000
 we wanted to kill the fans of the 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.310
 chelsea players 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.200
 mcgregor all the whores hugged 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.639
 those of the maribor could not believe the 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.310
 story that they were doing although not 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:45.430
 Barcelona is clearly much more 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:47.830
 superior the celtic that the maribor the 

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:50.470
 players were practically crying 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.570
 celebrating after the goal and the coach 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.840
 of the celtic was like crazy and said let's go 

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:57.330
 forward nothing happened here come 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:05:01.240
 we were only we need to specify 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:04.389
 we have to go forward but we 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.610
 they could cut with could not tie 

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:08.950
 the result and not even go to the 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.280
 criminal the celtic that in this way 

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.280
 it is outside 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.919
 it is a loss of an important team 

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:17.900
 from that country that was always 

00:05:15.919 --> 00:05:21.499
 contesting the uefa champions league and 

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.749
 I continue until it has arrived from the hand of 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:25.069
 nakamura it seems to me that the southpaw if not 

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:27.050
 will come out when he shares freestyle 

00:05:25.069 --> 00:05:28.849
 perfect 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:30.470
 and I do not only know what will happen as 

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:32.720
 mcgregor will surely sell it in 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:34.280
 these days and with stocks because if for 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.110
 something stays in feeling was for 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.759
 face the champions league to try 

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:39.979
 of making history and now with this 

00:05:37.759 --> 00:05:41.300
 totally negative result will have to be 

00:05:39.979 --> 00:05:43.699
 see what will happen to both players 

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.370
 good guys down there have the link 

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:48.740
 to bring the goal of the maribor we 

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:50.690
 we find in the instants to follow 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.699
 with the summaries the comments and 

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:55.419
 analysis of the champions a hug 

00:05:52.699 --> 00:05:55.419
 big chau
