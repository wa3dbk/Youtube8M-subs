00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
spend on the neon lights a lot there is

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.699 
spend on the neon lights a lot there is
an<00:02:08.910> emotion<00:02:09.450> but<00:02:09.899> i<00:02:09.959> think<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.290> the<00:02:10.410> emotion

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
an emotion but i think that the emotion

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.570 
an emotion but i think that the emotion
is<00:02:11.100> just<00:02:11.430> kind<00:02:11.670> of<00:02:11.760> like<00:02:12.110> the<00:02:13.110> fun

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
is just kind of like the fun

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.260 
is just kind of like the fun
free-spirited<00:02:14.580> you<00:02:14.850> know<00:02:14.970> if<00:02:15.060> you're<00:02:15.180> not

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
free-spirited you know if you're not

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:16.699 
free-spirited you know if you're not
having<00:02:15.420> a<00:02:15.540> good<00:02:15.660> time<00:02:15.870> making<00:02:16.140> it<00:02:16.410> that<00:02:16.650> you

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
having a good time making it that you

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:17.710 
having a good time making it that you
shouldn't<00:02:16.950> be<00:02:17.100> making<00:02:17.280> it

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
shouldn't be making it

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.890 
shouldn't be making it
I<00:02:18.140> think<00:02:18.530> that<00:02:18.800> is<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.060> best<00:02:20.300> way<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.660> get

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:20.900 
I think that is like the best way to get

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.720 
I think that is like the best way to get
the<00:02:21.020> best<00:02:21.140> creative<00:02:21.500> out<00:02:21.740> of<00:02:21.860> people<00:02:22.190> they

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the best creative out of people they

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.240 
the best creative out of people they
really<00:02:23.390> do<00:02:23.510> kind<00:02:23.690> of<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.080> let<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:24.350> go<00:02:24.500> nuts<00:02:24.920> I

really do kind of just let you go nuts I

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:27.990 
really do kind of just let you go nuts I
think<00:02:25.610> most<00:02:25.820> artists<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:26.540> they're<00:02:26.750> being

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
think most artists if they're being

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.420 
think most artists if they're being
totally<00:02:29.000> honest<00:02:29.380> will<00:02:30.380> will<00:02:30.860> tell<00:02:31.070> you<00:02:31.220> that

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
totally honest will will tell you that

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.260 
totally honest will will tell you that
the<00:02:31.580> fear<00:02:31.850> of<00:02:32.560> creativity<00:02:33.560> is<00:02:33.740> that<00:02:33.980> it's<00:02:34.760> a

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:35.270 
the fear of creativity is that it's a

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:37.570 
the fear of creativity is that it's a
lot<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.630> it<00:02:35.720> is<00:02:35.810> really<00:02:36.050> just<00:02:36.260> a<00:02:36.440> lucky<00:02:37.010> sort<00:02:37.520> of

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
lot of it is really just a lucky sort of

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.110 
lot of it is really just a lucky sort of
cosmic<00:02:37.850> accident<00:02:38.450> we<00:02:39.140> did<00:02:39.380> a<00:02:39.820> 80-foot<00:02:40.820> clock

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
