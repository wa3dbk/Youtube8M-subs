second generation of the boot made for

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.939 
second generation of the boot made for
the<00:00:18.029> engine<00:00:18.600> on<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.020> team<00:00:19.289> which<00:00:19.680> is<00:00:19.830> the

the engine on the team which is the

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.640 
the engine on the team which is the
player<00:00:20.220> who<00:00:20.449> tirelessly<00:00:21.449> runs<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.230> runs<00:00:22.320> and

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
player who tirelessly runs and runs and

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.070 
player who tirelessly runs and runs and
tackles<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.519> chases<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.119> ball<00:00:24.150> for<00:00:25.019> the

entire 90 minutes and obviously the
second<00:00:28.500> generation<00:00:29.039> is<00:00:29.460> not<00:00:29.760> a<00:00:30.029> complete

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
second generation is not a complete

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.659 
second generation is not a complete
makeover<00:00:31.019> from<00:00:31.560> the<00:00:31.740> first<00:00:32.009> generation<00:00:32.550> of

makeover from the first generation of
the<00:00:32.790> nitrocharge<00:00:33.149> but<00:00:33.930> then<00:00:34.050> again<00:00:34.320> there

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
the nitrocharge but then again there

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.000 
the nitrocharge but then again there
have<00:00:34.800> been<00:00:35.070> some<00:00:35.969> changes<00:00:36.270> made<00:00:36.809> so<00:00:37.290> let's<00:00:37.739> pop

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
have been some changes made so let's pop

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:45.440 
have been some changes made so let's pop
the<00:00:38.219> hood<00:00:38.390> take<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> bit<00:00:39.690> of<00:00:39.870> a<00:00:40.020> closer<00:00:40.379> look<00:00:44.450> now

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
the hood take a bit of a closer look now

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.060 
the hood take a bit of a closer look now
the<00:00:45.510> concept<00:00:46.020> behind<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.440> nitrocharge

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
the concept behind the nitrocharge

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:49.310 
the concept behind the nitrocharge
is<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.460> give<00:00:47.640> the<00:00:47.850> player<00:00:47.969> wearing<00:00:48.539> them<00:00:48.690> more

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
is to give the player wearing them more

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.400 
is to give the player wearing them more
energy<00:00:49.500> throughout<00:00:50.489> the<00:00:51.030> match<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.809> actually

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
energy throughout the match and actually

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
energy throughout the match and actually
adidas<00:00:52.860> spent<00:00:53.100> two<00:00:53.430> years<00:00:53.660> identifying<00:00:54.660> this

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
adidas spent two years identifying this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.740 
adidas spent two years identifying this
new<00:00:55.079> engine<00:00:55.770> type<00:00:56.070> of<00:00:56.340> player<00:00:56.579> runs<00:00:57.360> and

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
new engine type of player runs and

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.349 
new engine type of player runs and
tackles<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.410> kind<00:00:58.710> of<00:00:58.829> like<00:00:58.980> drives<00:00:59.670> the<00:01:00.180> team

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
tackles and kind of like drives the team

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:03.709 
tackles and kind of like drives the team
forward<00:01:00.780> throughout<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.010> match<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:02.730> for

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
forward throughout the match and for

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.960 
forward throughout the match and for
that<00:01:03.840> what<00:01:04.589> would<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:04.979> need<00:01:05.129> any<00:01:05.309> you<00:01:05.580> need<00:01:05.909> a

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
that what would you need any you need a

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.490 
that what would you need any you need a
lot<00:01:06.240> of<00:01:06.390> energy<00:01:06.750> but<00:01:06.900> you<00:01:06.960> also<00:01:07.200> need

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
lot of energy but you also need

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.950 
lot of energy but you also need
protection<00:01:08.130> which<00:01:08.640> is<00:01:08.670> exactly<00:01:09.299> what<00:01:09.570> adidas

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
protection which is exactly what adidas

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.429 
protection which is exactly what adidas
say<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.830> nitrocharge<00:01:11.250> will<00:01:11.970> offer<00:01:12.210> you<00:01:12.439> so

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
say the nitrocharge will offer you so

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:14.660 
say the nitrocharge will offer you so
the<00:01:13.560> biggest<00:01:13.740> change<00:01:14.100> on<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.549> new

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
the biggest change on the new

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.570 
the biggest change on the new
nitrocharge<00:01:15.090> has<00:01:15.600> to<00:01:15.840> be<00:01:16.049> on<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:17.009> energy

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
nitrocharge has to be on the energy

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.399 
nitrocharge has to be on the energy

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
sling which is this iconic rubberband

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.999 
sling which is this iconic rubberband
going<00:01:20.159> across<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:21.210> top<00:01:21.240> of<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.930> boom<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.470> the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
concept behind the energy sling is to

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.899 
concept behind the energy sling is to
keep<00:01:25.110> your<00:01:25.290> foot<00:01:25.560> locked<00:01:25.860> down<00:01:26.070> on<00:01:26.369> the

keep your foot locked down on the

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:29.510 
keep your foot locked down on the
soleplate<00:01:27.180> at<00:01:27.720> all<00:01:28.229> times<00:01:28.680> simply<00:01:29.189> because

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
soleplate at all times simply because

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.190 
soleplate at all times simply because
when<00:01:29.790> your<00:01:29.909> foot<00:01:30.119> is<00:01:30.150> not<00:01:30.479> locked<00:01:30.750> down<00:01:30.840> on<00:01:31.110> the

when your foot is not locked down on the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.410 
when your foot is not locked down on the
soleplate<00:01:31.500> you<00:01:32.040> risk<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.700> might<00:01:32.729> slip

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
soleplate you risk that you might slip

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.270 
soleplate you risk that you might slip
around<00:01:33.780> in<00:01:33.990> your<00:01:34.079> boom<00:01:34.320> when<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:34.710> twist<00:01:35.009> and

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
around in your boom when you twist and

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.120 
around in your boom when you twist and
turn<00:01:35.579> or<00:01:35.909> accelerate<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.110> thus<00:01:37.259> waste<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:38.009> lot

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
turn or accelerate and thus waste a lot

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.580 
turn or accelerate and thus waste a lot
of<00:01:38.189> energy<00:01:38.610> which<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> energy<00:01:39.810> that<00:01:40.259> you<00:01:40.380> could

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
of energy which is energy that you could

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.460 
of energy which is energy that you could
have<00:01:40.680> otherwise<00:01:41.040> put<00:01:41.549> into<00:01:41.790> use<00:01:42.030> later<00:01:42.930> on<00:01:43.170> in

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
have otherwise put into use later on in

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.130 
have otherwise put into use later on in
the<00:01:43.950> match<00:01:44.130> so<00:01:45.060> by<00:01:45.210> actually<00:01:45.360> keeping<00:01:45.990> your

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
the match so by actually keeping your

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.440 
the match so by actually keeping your
foot<00:01:46.439> locked<00:01:47.070> on<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:47.610> soleplate<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.240> get<00:01:48.420> a

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
foot locked on the soleplate you get a

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.450 
foot locked on the soleplate you get a
more<00:01:48.750> efficient<00:01:49.439> power<00:01:49.649> transfer<00:01:50.220> from<00:01:50.369> your

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
more efficient power transfer from your

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.420 
more efficient power transfer from your
foot<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.360> the<00:01:51.509> soleplate<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.170> ultimately<00:01:52.740> to

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
foot to the soleplate and ultimately to

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.969 
foot to the soleplate and ultimately to
the<00:01:53.579> ground<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.270> preserve<00:01:54.659> more<00:01:55.020> of<00:01:55.259> your

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
the ground to preserve more of your

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:57.920 
the ground to preserve more of your
energy<00:01:56.430> that<00:01:56.939> you<00:01:57.030> can<00:01:57.149> then<00:01:57.329> use<00:01:57.360> later<00:01:57.840> on

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
energy that you can then use later on

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.080 
energy that you can then use later on
and<00:01:58.290> if<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:58.530> compared<00:01:58.920> to<00:01:59.159> the<00:01:59.280> older<00:01:59.820> with

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
and if we compared to the older with

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.730 
and if we compared to the older with
nitrocharge<00:02:00.570> you<00:02:00.990> can<00:02:01.110> see<00:02:01.320> that<00:02:01.500> the<00:02:01.590> energy

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
nitrocharge you can see that the energy

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.830 
nitrocharge you can see that the energy
slain<00:02:02.159> has<00:02:02.310> been<00:02:02.460> made<00:02:02.610> slightly<00:02:03.030> wider<00:02:03.270> it's

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
slain has been made slightly wider it's

quite<00:03:40.500> a<00:03:40.650> few<00:03:41.160> changes<00:03:41.790> but<00:03:42.720> it's<00:03:42.840> perhaps

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
quite a few changes but it's perhaps

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:44.960 
quite a few changes but it's perhaps
also<00:03:43.410> more<00:03:43.769> an<00:03:43.860> expression<00:03:44.400> of<00:03:44.489> adidas

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
also more an expression of adidas

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.210 
also more an expression of adidas
improving<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:46.230> current<00:03:46.620> concept<00:03:47.040> and

improving the current concept and
technologies<00:03:47.880> instead<00:03:48.540> of<00:03:48.720> just<00:03:48.930> rewriting

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:49.560 
technologies instead of just rewriting

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.130 
technologies instead of just rewriting
and<00:03:49.860> reinventing<00:03:50.579> the<00:03:51.150> whole<00:03:51.390> thing<00:03:51.750> and<00:03:51.989> it's

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
and reinventing the whole thing and it's

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.170 
and reinventing the whole thing and it's
based<00:03:52.410> on<00:03:52.590> player<00:03:53.040> feedback<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.880> give<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.150> a

more comfortable and more efficient ride

00:03:57.299 --> 00:03:59.690 
more comfortable and more efficient ride
and<00:03:57.630> basically<00:03:58.200> make<00:03:58.470> it<00:03:58.590> a<00:03:58.680> better<00:03:58.890> football

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
and basically make it a better football

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.270 
and basically make it a better football
boom<00:04:00.090> all<00:04:00.329> in<00:04:00.810> all<00:04:00.959> and<00:04:01.380> if<00:04:01.860> you're<00:04:01.980> thinking

perform<00:04:04.709> well<00:04:04.980> luckily<00:04:05.220> our<00:04:05.880> review<00:04:06.480> is<00:04:06.660> not
