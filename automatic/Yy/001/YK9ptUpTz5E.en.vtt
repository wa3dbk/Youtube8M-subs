00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:10.080
 so today we will learn how to remove the system 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.639
 cooling with a video card and it doesnâ€™t 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:15.710
 losing warranty we have asus 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.630
 gtx770 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:21.690
 very good graphics card need memory 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:24.660
 not enough 2 gigabytes for 4 gigabyte 

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:26.970
 the version was no regret here in principle 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.940
 in principle, it is not so much 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.940
 It is heated in a simple tablet there 34 

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:37.679
 degrees so that then but in severe 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:40.199
 toy type but i'll feel 43 to 80 

00:00:37.679 --> 00:00:43.850
 it is even taller than a room hot 

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:48.960
 suppose it even happens because of 80 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:50.089
 Of course there are two coolers but not enough 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.190
 of course 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:59.280
 baby blades the thing is to take 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.920
 all this canoe cooling system 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:06.469
 need to unscrew 4 bolts on one of them 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:10.110
 as we see seals 

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:11.149
 if you break it already all the guarantees we 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.990
 we lose 

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:18.890
 new card she does not have another six months 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.939
 warranty up to a total of three years 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:25.530
 So I decided to change the thermal paste was 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 at least see what is there if 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.149
 any 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.539
 thermal interface that heat like a sponge 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:40.500
 you don't know better of course change here i am 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:46.289
 bought arctic mx-4 but how much did it come out 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:49.109
 320 rubles 4 grams time as qpt-8 20 

00:01:46.289 --> 00:01:51.359
 grams that for rubles 60 but here too 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:55.710
 Interesting thing by the way I tried 

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:58.079
 Smeared precisely process mx-4 temperature 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.399
 I got up that is downtime somewhere now 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:04.520
 shows degrees 35 when on the same 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.579
 kpt-8 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:12.469
 showed 27 i.e. difference 

00:02:09.579 --> 00:02:15.469
 I do not know what is the reason 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:17.859
 not enough and imposed the opposite though 

00:02:15.469 --> 00:02:22.700
 put a little okay 

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:24.829
 here, too, well, I want to put here the matter is 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:30.590
 that here there is such a cover of aluminum 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:33.799
 and and not take a shot yet mt 4 bolts 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:36.590
 but between the cap and the bolt are you here 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.569
 around the distance I bought these 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.030
 long nose pliers but it's very big 

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:43.340
 if much less sold and thinner 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.099
 here and the buff it is desirable just for 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.430
 the lack of another I bought these edges 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:51.530
 we wrap with insulating tape so as not to 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.370
 damage do not scratch so servicemen 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.799
 if something suddenly 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:58.459
 wild field that here she was hiding 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:04.750
 everything is neatly inserted between 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:09.590
 bolt screw and here is this plate skill 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:12.310
 clips grow unscrewed in 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:15.290
 easy principle 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:19.310
 with due care and everything will be 

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:23.569
 nothing is scratched late 

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:29.379
 I see I hope the video that's all bolt u 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:33.349
 us hands pam bacillus all if the game is what 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:37.430
 service - to excuse me the filling is all intact 

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:44.049
 questions are not steel 4 usually 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:44.049
 screwdriver neatly in nonsense 

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:50.069
 lighting is not very certainly visible here 

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:53.670
 everything is very good 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:56.969
 Well, in general, if I think nothing is clear here 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:59.999
 difficult then so easy life hacking you know 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:04.590
 This head came as it looked like 

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:08.579
 it is possible and so here a little bit our brothers 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:14.909
 Chinese parties did not think that they could 

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:18.720
 do it all hide all they're here 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:21.239
 some kind of compound 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.099
 This you on the first I reveal now 

00:04:21.239 --> 00:04:25.099
 I did not see anywhere inside 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:54.020
 pretty massive 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:58.480
 direct cu his course yes surface 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:05:03.080
 very so adam stripes and on 

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:10.450
 to polish and for good but little given 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:13.270
 hard it is completely like a stone has not dried 

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:20.680
 understandable heat up of course it will warm up 

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:20.680
 all under the replacement strip all so 

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:35.630
 this one even cooler is turned off and also 

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:39.680
 of course the chip plate itself is over 

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:44.860
 memory and phone but well, in general, the principle 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:48.979
 it is clear here that everything would be visible 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.639
 it was used to him a layer 

00:05:48.979 --> 00:05:57.320
 plasticine just cement of course it is 

00:05:52.639 --> 00:06:00.080
 you have to change everything will in mix 4 not 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.360
 start or guarantee that during 

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.060
 there who writes who gave races eight 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:09.199
 years even almost no this pasta 

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:09.680
 dries out nothing well let's see well that's how 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:12.490
 so 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:15.050
 including a radiator'll see 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.080
 say goodbye if there is enough space for 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.889
 I will be in time 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.889
 know what is there 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.880
 here 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:42.580
 and oh here here is this hat 

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:45.720
 here it is called 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:45.720
 on the phillip plan sometime 

00:06:46.349 --> 00:06:53.259
 thermo gasket is called 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.680
 I am filled well, I think mine will change too 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:07:00.069
 although well, it will be seen well, in general, like 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:03.159
 so everything is nothing complicated if neat 

00:07:00.069 --> 00:07:04.810
 no rush no rush all you can 

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:07.719
 make the best thing when you're 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:12.629
 twist neatly twist it 

00:07:07.719 --> 00:07:16.500
 rush to the end face is good at catching on 

00:07:12.629 --> 00:07:16.500
 force of all
