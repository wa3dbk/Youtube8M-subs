00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:18.670 
for now I think it's really nice just be
careful<00:03:16.400> with<00:03:16.609> really<00:03:17.060> loud<00:03:17.780> sounds<00:03:18.440> because

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
careful with really loud sounds because

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.160 
careful with really loud sounds because
I<00:03:18.799> think<00:03:18.859> it<00:03:19.069> might<00:03:19.250> hurt<00:03:19.459> a<00:03:19.670> little<00:03:19.849> bit

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
I think it might hurt a little bit

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.379 
I think it might hurt a little bit
then<00:03:21.409> the<00:03:21.829> three<00:03:22.129> it's<00:03:22.250> not<00:03:22.430> that<00:03:22.790> loud<00:03:23.060> but

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
then the three it's not that loud but

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.800 
then the three it's not that loud but
with<00:03:23.599> computers<00:03:24.260> or<00:03:25.030> your<00:03:26.030> normal<00:03:26.420> sound

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:26.810 
with computers or your normal sound

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.470 
with computers or your normal sound
player<00:03:27.109> I<00:03:27.139> think<00:03:27.590> it<00:03:27.709> can<00:03:27.889> be<00:03:28.040> really<00:03:28.639> loud<00:03:29.090> and

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
player I think it can be really loud and

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:33.150 
player I think it can be really loud and
may<00:03:29.599> hurt<00:03:30.079> a<00:03:30.169> little<00:03:30.199> bit<00:03:30.530> but<00:03:31.750> overall

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
may hurt a little bit but overall

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:37.269 
may hurt a little bit but overall
