00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
hi everybody I'm going to make a video

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.089 
hi everybody I'm going to make a video
how<00:00:06.960> I<00:00:06.990> replaced<00:00:07.560> my<00:00:07.830> spark<00:00:08.370> plugs<00:00:08.610> on<00:00:10.099> 2007

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
how I replaced my spark plugs on 2007

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.750 
how I replaced my spark plugs on 2007
Subaru<00:00:11.969> Outback<00:00:13.490> XD<00:00:14.490> I<00:00:15.170> didn't<00:00:16.170> find<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.410> video

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
Subaru Outback XD I didn't find a video

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.759 
Subaru Outback XD I didn't find a video
maybe<00:00:17.760> that's<00:00:18.060> because<00:00:18.560> it's<00:00:19.560> too<00:00:19.830> easy<00:00:20.330> to<00:00:21.330> do

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:21.769 
maybe that's because it's too easy to do

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:24.759 
maybe that's because it's too easy to do
but<00:00:22.769> I'm<00:00:22.920> going<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.189> make<00:00:23.310> a<00:00:23.340> video<00:00:23.730> on<00:00:23.850> my<00:00:23.880> own

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:24.769 
but I'm going to make a video on my own

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.650 
but I'm going to make a video on my own
just<00:00:25.769> because<00:00:27.500> here's<00:00:28.500> a<00:00:29.150> some<00:00:30.150> of<00:00:30.300> the<00:00:30.390> tools

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
just because here's a some of the tools

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:36.010 
just because here's a some of the tools
I<00:00:30.779> used<00:00:31.019> I<00:00:31.460> used<00:00:32.460> two<00:00:32.969> screwdrivers<00:00:34.489> five<00:00:35.489> a

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
I used I used two screwdrivers five a

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.799 
I used I used two screwdrivers five a
spark<00:00:37.020> plug<00:00:37.050> socket<00:00:38.809> size<00:00:39.809> 12<00:00:41.090> socket<00:00:42.090> wrench

spark plug socket size 12 socket wrench

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.440 
spark plug socket size 12 socket wrench
and<00:00:44.059> a<00:00:45.059> clamp

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and a clamp

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.600 
and a clamp
I'll<00:00:45.660> show<00:00:45.960> you<00:00:46.020> what<00:00:46.260> that's<00:00:46.410> used<00:00:46.649> for<00:00:47.190> not<00:00:47.579> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I'll show you what that's used for not a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.750 
I'll show you what that's used for not a
little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.980> this<00:00:49.980> is<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.250> spark<00:00:50.520> plug<00:00:50.670> I

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
little bit this is the spark plug I

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.779 
little bit this is the spark plug I
already<00:00:50.969> took<00:00:51.120> out<00:00:51.590> so<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.520> it<00:00:53.699> is

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
already took out so you know it is

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.920 
already took out so you know it is
doable<00:00:56.960> the<00:00:57.960> harnesses<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:59.660> marked<00:01:00.660> them<00:01:00.719> so<00:01:00.899> I

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
doable the harnesses I marked them so I

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.000 
doable the harnesses I marked them so I
know<00:01:01.109> where<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.500> go<00:01:03.409> this<00:01:04.409> one's<00:01:04.650> kind<00:01:04.920> of

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
know where they go this one's kind of

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.390 
know where they go this one's kind of
bad<00:01:05.630> it's<00:01:06.630> rusted<00:01:07.140> out<00:01:07.200> I<00:01:07.619> don't<00:01:08.070> know<00:01:08.159> if<00:01:08.280> I'm

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
bad it's rusted out I don't know if I'm

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.859 
bad it's rusted out I don't know if I'm
going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:08.640> have<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.880> replace<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.360> or<00:01:09.450> not<00:01:09.600> I

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
going to have to replace it or not I

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.050 
going to have to replace it or not I
will<00:01:10.830> find<00:01:11.100> out<00:01:11.280> in<00:01:11.549> a<00:01:11.640> little<00:01:11.670> bit<00:01:11.970> here<00:01:14.060> now

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
will find out in a little bit here now

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:33.870 
will find out in a little bit here now
let's<00:01:15.450> go<00:01:15.630> underneath

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.100 

okay<00:01:34.880> if<00:01:35.030> you're<00:01:35.150> going<00:01:35.270> to<00:01:35.360> look<00:01:35.540> this<00:01:35.900> is

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
okay if you're going to look this is

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.140 
okay if you're going to look this is
what<00:01:36.320> you're<00:01:36.470> going<00:01:36.560> to<00:01:36.650> find<00:01:39.880> that's<00:01:40.880> fully

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
what you're going to find that's fully

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:47.070 
what you're going to find that's fully
assembled<00:01:41.920> there<00:01:42.920> is<00:01:43.100> that<00:01:43.310> black<00:01:44.000> clip<00:01:46.000> that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.080 
assembled there is that black clip that

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:57.850 
assembled there is that black clip that
if<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.320> press<00:01:48.650> with<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.400> screwdriver<00:01:56.590> on<00:01:57.590> this

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
if you press with a screwdriver on this

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.450 
if you press with a screwdriver on this
clip<00:01:58.220> here<00:01:58.550> you<00:01:59.210> will<00:01:59.480> slide<00:02:00.080> out<00:02:00.470> really

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
clip here you will slide out really

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.160 
clip here you will slide out really
easily<00:02:01.730> towards<00:02:02.180> the<00:02:02.270> back<00:02:02.740> this<00:02:04.330> and<00:02:05.330> then

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:06.170 
easily towards the back this and then

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.410 
easily towards the back this and then
you'll<00:02:06.860> just<00:02:06.980> have<00:02:07.220> to<00:02:07.340> take<00:02:07.460> care<00:02:07.670> of<00:02:07.700> the

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
you'll just have to take care of the

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.660 
you'll just have to take care of the
little<00:02:08.600> bolt<00:02:08.930> there<00:02:09.399> and<00:02:12.250> I'm<00:02:13.250> going<00:02:13.430> to<00:02:13.490> show

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
little bolt there and I'm going to show

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:25.360 
little bolt there and I'm going to show
you<00:02:13.700> the<00:02:13.910> rest<00:02:14.800> on<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:16.100> other<00:02:16.280> side<00:02:24.370> this

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
you the rest on the other side this

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:34.510 
you the rest on the other side this
pop-up<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:26.150> already<00:02:26.570> out<00:02:29.110> you<00:02:30.110> can<00:02:30.320> see<00:02:33.370> it<00:02:34.370> is

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:34.520 
pop-up is already out you can see it is

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.310 
pop-up is already out you can see it is
really<00:02:34.670> good<00:02:35.030> you<00:02:35.450> have<00:02:35.959> to<00:02:36.080> do<00:02:36.200> with

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:36.320 
really good you have to do with

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.660 
really good you have to do with
underneath<00:02:36.680> you<00:02:36.950> don't<00:02:37.100> have<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> take<00:02:37.490> out

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
underneath you don't have to take out

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.710 
underneath you don't have to take out
any<00:02:37.880> batteries<00:02:38.450> or<00:02:38.480> any<00:02:39.100> intake<00:02:40.100> boxes<00:02:40.720> but

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:41.720 
any batteries or any intake boxes but

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.310 
any batteries or any intake boxes but
there<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:41.989> a<00:02:42.020> frame<00:02:42.470> in<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> way<00:02:43.450> but<00:02:44.450> it<00:02:44.930> is

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:45.320 
there is a frame in a way but it is

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.210 
there is a frame in a way but it is
really<00:02:45.709> manageable<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.880> work<00:02:47.830> what<00:02:48.830> I<00:02:48.860> did<00:02:49.070> is

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
really manageable to work what I did is

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:54.610 
really manageable to work what I did is
I<00:02:50.590> threw<00:02:51.590> in<00:02:51.770> a<00:02:51.950> 5/8<00:02:52.870> spark<00:02:53.870> plug<00:02:54.050> socket<00:02:54.080> in

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
I threw in a 5/8 spark plug socket in

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.180 
I threw in a 5/8 spark plug socket in
there<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:55.390> then<00:02:56.390> I<00:02:56.570> followed<00:02:56.989> by<00:02:57.230> this

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190 
there and then I followed by this

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:05.290 
there and then I followed by this
extension<00:02:58.930> and<00:03:00.190> I<00:03:01.190> put<00:03:01.459> a<00:03:01.489> wrench<00:03:01.940> and<00:03:04.300> you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
extension and I put a wrench and you

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:10.290 
extension and I put a wrench and you
know<00:03:05.450> when<00:03:05.720> I<00:03:05.750> start<00:03:06.050> unscrewing<00:03:08.530> this

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:10.300 
know when I start unscrewing this

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:17.170 
know when I start unscrewing this
exhaust<00:03:11.350> shield<00:03:12.350> and<00:03:14.140> this<00:03:15.140> part<00:03:15.500> here<00:03:16.180> were

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
exhaust shield and this part here were

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.880 
exhaust shield and this part here were
not<00:03:17.959> allowing<00:03:18.320> me<00:03:18.680> to<00:03:19.540> do<00:03:20.540> anything<00:03:21.020> it<00:03:21.709> was

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:21.890 
not allowing me to do anything it was

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:26.979 
not allowing me to do anything it was
really<00:03:24.670> unmanageable<00:03:25.670> so<00:03:26.270> what<00:03:26.540> I<00:03:26.570> did<00:03:26.660> is<00:03:26.959> uh

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:26.989 
really unmanageable so what I did is uh

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.180 
really unmanageable so what I did is uh
I<00:03:27.380> cheated<00:03:27.830> a<00:03:28.130> little<00:03:28.340> bit<00:03:29.650> what<00:03:30.650> I<00:03:30.680> did<00:03:30.980> is<00:03:31.160> uh

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:31.190 
I cheated a little bit what I did is uh

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.790 
I cheated a little bit what I did is uh
I<00:03:31.959> didn't

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:35.800 

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:41.490 

I<00:03:38.220> didn't<00:03:39.220> put<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:40.600> socket<00:03:40.900> all<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.260> way<00:03:41.380> in

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:41.500 
I didn't put the socket all the way in

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.360 
I didn't put the socket all the way in
the<00:03:41.710> extender<00:03:42.520> I<00:03:42.760> left<00:03:43.480> it<00:03:43.720> just<00:03:44.340> like<00:03:45.340> that

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
the extender I left it just like that

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.650 
the extender I left it just like that
and<00:03:45.930> that<00:03:46.930> gave<00:03:47.290> me<00:03:47.460> just<00:03:48.460> enough<00:03:48.670> room<00:03:49.360> to

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:49.660 
and that gave me just enough room to

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.110 
and that gave me just enough room to
clear<00:03:50.530> the<00:03:51.130> shield<00:03:51.520> and<00:03:52.800> I<00:03:54.600> got<00:03:55.600> it<00:03:55.780> opened<00:03:57.120> and

00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:58.120 
clear the shield and I got it opened and

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.850 
clear the shield and I got it opened and
then<00:03:58.570> the<00:03:58.750> tricky<00:03:59.410> part<00:03:59.650> was<00:04:00.030> separating<00:04:01.860> the

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
then the tricky part was separating the

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:07.140 
then the tricky part was separating the
socket<00:04:03.630> from<00:04:04.710> the<00:04:05.710> extension<00:04:06.370> while<00:04:06.730> it's<00:04:06.970> in

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
socket from the extension while it's in

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:14.400 
socket from the extension while it's in
there<00:04:07.980> that's<00:04:08.980> why<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:11.040> use<00:04:12.040> the<00:04:12.220> pliers<00:04:13.410> kind

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:14.410 
there that's why I use the pliers kind

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:16.410 
there that's why I use the pliers kind
of<00:04:14.530> clamping<00:04:15.130> pliers<00:04:15.430> that<00:04:15.580> I<00:04:15.760> showed<00:04:16.390> you

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
of clamping pliers that I showed you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:23.150 
of clamping pliers that I showed you
earlier

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:40.560 

get<00:04:24.160> out<00:04:24.250> of<00:04:24.340> here<00:04:24.520> I<00:04:32.040> clamped<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.570> then

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:40.570 
get out of here I clamped and then

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.840 
get out of here I clamped and then
Wireless<00:04:40.990> it<00:04:41.260> still<00:04:41.530> was<00:04:41.680> in<00:04:41.830> there<00:04:42.010> I<00:04:42.220> was

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:42.850 
Wireless it still was in there I was

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.890 
Wireless it still was in there I was
being<00:04:43.060> able<00:04:43.120> to<00:04:43.390> use<00:04:43.510> a<00:04:43.540> screwdriver<00:04:44.050> and<00:04:45.900> push

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
being able to use a screwdriver and push

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.790 
being able to use a screwdriver and push
the<00:04:47.470> socket<00:04:47.920> out<00:04:48.100> and<00:04:49.260> that<00:04:50.260> was<00:04:50.410> it

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:50.800 
the socket out and that was it

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:52.860 
the socket out and that was it
it's<00:04:51.370> almost<00:04:51.610> as<00:04:51.910> easy<00:04:52.090> as<00:04:52.210> replacing<00:04:52.420> spark

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
it's almost as easy as replacing spark

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.170 
it's almost as easy as replacing spark
plugs<00:04:53.200> on<00:04:53.290> a<00:04:53.380> civic<00:04:53.680> I<00:04:53.920> hope<00:04:54.850> you<00:04:55.000> have<00:04:55.150> a
