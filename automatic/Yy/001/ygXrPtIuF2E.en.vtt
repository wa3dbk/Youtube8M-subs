00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:19.060
 how will friends come back this time? 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.090
 another minecraft video to that 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.920
 plug in book 11 bookshelf is called 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.630
 the whole and very very exciting because 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:26.890
 you all his books you 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.619
 maybe also wrote here for 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.300
 for example a great chef backbuch 

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.040
 wants come from minecraft the eu of 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.720
 minecraft pact in today's days it is 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.309
 a plug in with the name 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.900
 I can write this book here 

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:39.160
 Sort it just like that 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.379
 show we have here quite whole 

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.540
 many different bookshelves all over 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.220
 so professionally built 

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.010
 I would say big library now 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.600
 You can use this to a library 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.629
 lead and maybe write on the 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:53.559
 server people like what can theirs then 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.260
 put books in it 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:58.150
 If you bookshelves here we take 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.710
 For example, we can click it 

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.239
 and then you stand in the bookshelf that has 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.299
 I can set such a config you can 

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.860
 but also enroll 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:10.619
 hmm library 25 s-300 and then you can 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:12.790
 because the books sort 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.500
 and if that's the case, then simply 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.150
 The rows are now in the 

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.860
 case two rows he could specify 

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:20.200
 You can also set one or five 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.439
 or six or seven as well as her that 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.409
 Just want truck then just here 

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:28.659
 a book is ready and out 

00:01:26.409 --> 00:01:30.340
 can go away now says then i want 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:31.780
 come back the next day goes to the 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.640
 Bookshelf if I can do it again 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:38.250
 tie and yes destroyed or yes as well 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.380
 that is always when he is the bookshelf 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.399
 has sorted back in rechtsweg 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.390
 you can make the book easy 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.329
 take out again 

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:48.249
 in the case of this book and co if yes 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:50.499
 then book in it have the bookshelf 

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:52.240
 also destroyed then comes the book 

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:55.630
 also out again so it is not lost 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.859
 forever and ever so now we have 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.600
 the whole but of course there are 

00:01:56.859 --> 00:02:00.369
 libraries where you now fixed books 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.079
 and you do not want to do that 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:03.460
 player that takes it easy and it 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.759
 just lost no 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:08.590
 You can also adjust that if 

00:02:06.759 --> 00:02:12.250
 he should just put the book in one 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.650
 Person that the bookshelf automatically 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.210
 refilled result ps was a 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.340
 and you will become like that even now 

00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.750
 see at unlimited we take this 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.310
 book out can go back in 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:23.950
 the book again so get out take 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:26.580
 a free copy, so to speak 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.990
 now you are hf can 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:29.610
 So of course I can also as crate 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.770
 I am a very clever person 

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.810
 stallion but no that will not 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:37.170
 work if select now then 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.710
 I have no idea I can 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.880
 not reinziehen 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.530
 yes, you just can not do that 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.740
 not reinziehen the only 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.020
 possible and thus could the iphone only 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.400
 enter the appropriate books 

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.660
 you can even normal config 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.040
 set whether you just too 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.550
 described or textbooks 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.100
 impression can or unwritten books 

00:02:56.550 --> 00:03:01.440
 So there are some possibilities where 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.940
 you then free your creativity 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.440
 so can let the huge 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.160
 use libraries and then simply 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:09.630
 to do the books and then 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.360
 just go back in and sanader 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.140
 Now I say in books to read that 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.440
 is fun 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:19.230
 yes that was it to the plug-in in short though 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.060
 Fine, I would say very practical 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:22.890
 So that always makes plugins like that 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.380
 Just keep the details on 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.110
 server out with such plugins on it has 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.690
 the mac man and he has some sense 

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:33.600
 for details and these are plugins 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:35.700
 just there beside the big ones 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:38.100
 of course, world cup s angels or 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.780
 other things but I thank you 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.420
 to look a beautiful 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.650
 pleasant evening and say once to 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:45.650
 dennis people
