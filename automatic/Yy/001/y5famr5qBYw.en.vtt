00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:53.520 
that we had flipped over so this was the

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.640

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
hard to determine exactly how long it

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:05.030 
hard to determine exactly how long it
takes<00:03:02.910> sometimes<00:03:03.480> I'll<00:03:03.690> rotate<00:03:04.200> the<00:03:04.530> crackers

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040

while they're baking so I'm going to
check<00:03:07.140> it<00:03:07.290> after<00:03:07.440> 20<00:03:07.860> minutes<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.580> how<00:03:08.610> to

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
check it after 20 minutes to see how to

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.880 
check it after 20 minutes to see how to
do<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.300> these<00:03:09.840> crackers<00:03:10.380> have<00:03:10.530> been<00:03:10.680> baking

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:13.410 
for a good 45 minutes I've rotated them

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:15.350
