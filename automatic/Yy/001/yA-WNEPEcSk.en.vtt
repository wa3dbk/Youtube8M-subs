00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.519
 here NRW TV is watching the program 12 22 with the Medion 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:10.670
 and this time I will show you percent of some tricks with songs this time 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.349
 few settings how to use Windows 7 Starter 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.949
 a bit user friendly can set what is better around and 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.170
 For example, we have a more supple running basic equipment 

00:00:20.169 --> 00:00:21.970
 chosen here now with these young 

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:24.269
 around 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.130
 in the 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.310
 Power set, for example, that the window is displayed when 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.089
 move and then I notice here already at the end 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:31.910
 changing is being postponed 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:34.020
 there are no streaks around 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.400
 and yes 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.830
 the device he is generally or netbooks on in general but more 

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:40.600
 Windows are open and that's why you should 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.980
 relieve the memory a bit what each time do 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.690
 As far as I can get it around that Windows break through the Roderick 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.200
 Spread the city but look under Windows break 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.510
 otherwise, he might get the percent off the system settings 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.490
 before start 

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:56.450
 and after advanced 

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.610
 to search system settings 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.780
 but I just go with the windows button and pause 

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.580
 also for systems then advanced system settings and down performance 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.380
 For example, the visual effects could set us today 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.549
 a mouse shadow belly certainly not 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.850
 this requires up to five percent power new computer system 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:16.860
 not impossible 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:19.830
 then it would be my smallest shadow to keep it up 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.450
 You can confidently put something like this behind the visual effects 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.930
 System and the subject properties could be the visual settings 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.490
 Exhibit your here 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:32.060
 these simple ones are very many 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:35.979
 he can has and pretty much all would have to fend off or not yet 

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:38.820
 is always so for example Amazon while minimizing and maximizing completely 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:39.990
 unnecessary 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.380
 the word also fits an animation 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.610
 to get through the background for symbol signatures quite nicely 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.730
 so it looks quite ugly and robs a test 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.500
 otherwise percentage added "content displayed while dragging window 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.690
 neither 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.320
 not to shade either 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.930
 Menus on the objections I generally do not smile around 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.870
 and here we could easily like it 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.100
 under settings from lee and so I'm actually always know 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.729
 around 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.729
 War in the pre-program not around 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:14.009
 and 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:16.100
 yes Jordan take over press 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.999
 then it will be taken over pretty well 

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.909
 and already, for example, forgiving over a window only such an office 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.899
 appropriate 

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:24.709
 which is not necessarily 

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:27.729
 But working makes it harder for the computer 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:29.829
 relieved a lot 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:34.099
 then another trick of the middle, for example, could start ordering 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.149
 yes, just down at the start then bring it there 

00:02:37.149 --> 00:02:40.679
 Enter RMS conflict and then you can start watching 

00:02:40.679 --> 00:02:43.759
 and then hit enter a conflict but we can also 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.759
 read more about van der Pütten com in the corresponding article 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:52.000
 and Sabine m I could not do that is the system configuration 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.879
 and then system start jubiliert then you can look 

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:58.569
 which programs paint when booting 

00:03:00.219 --> 00:03:03.219
 Percent interfering in the high experience procedure we have here now 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:04.119
 just 

00:03:04.119 --> 00:03:07.689
 about 8 pieces that's okay he's not here at all 

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:10.709
 superfluous agree with it for such things as 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:15.619
 So the shortcut to the Intel Graphics Driver Audio Driver Hot Key is short 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:18.439
 Niki is for the pension for the f-keys 

00:03:18.439 --> 00:03:21.450
 um and the bluetooth driver are very important 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.129
 the Windows sidebar I would generally advise you anyway in general 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.899
 make out of the netbooks that drops are okay if with the 

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:30.639
 one and two, it was continued 

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.879
 but it does not really work for a PUK 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.169
 You can also exhibit that 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:38.639
 I've left it on the motto Zion purposes yet 

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:42.169
 and here we can see at Medion I have it at times things yes 

00:03:42.169 --> 00:03:44.049
 and issued Audi 4 d 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:47.369
 and state more here we do not need for Yuki 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:50.429
 because if I want to watch with DVD Geläuf im then wants 

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:52.059
 I'll probably know 

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:55.429
 You do not have to start the program every time you start the program 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:03:58.149
 log in here 

00:03:58.149 --> 00:03:59.909
 if you have done that 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:02.059
 I'm doing a penalty 

00:04:02.059 --> 00:04:04.499
 here those who - durable 

00:04:04.499 --> 00:04:07.629
 then Pretre 4 take over okay 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:11.599
 and sometimes when asked so I issued a system 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.889
 if it wants to have some time then just borrow and borrow 

00:04:15.889 --> 00:04:18.739
 not just states but instead of having it 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:21.669
 and then we could see how much faster it is 

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:25.070
 Every now and then I look around, for example, mini-kids 

00:04:25.069 --> 00:04:28.770
 installed then there are a few things percent on how is this 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.939
 Automatically Rhine and most of the drummers do not follow freedom here 

00:04:31.939 --> 00:04:34.430
 if you wanted that, come automatically 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:37.789
 a last tip for the Trophy users among you 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:41.530
 because there is a program that is, and NATO Windows Street is completely it 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.379
 lose for free at Mosaic MOS 

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:46.379
 what was downloaded under the link he found punk and finds 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:51.819
 and if something calls, then you have a general and systems 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.220
 Setting everything up so once the system information as you already know 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:58.889
 quite normal and then everything could really stop everything they have 

00:04:58.889 --> 00:05:00.430
 and what she does not want 

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.620
 Percent of an erotic I features you can make out 

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:08.550
 to adjust a child pretty much anything both persons relation 

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.270
 in the 

00:05:10.270 --> 00:05:13.589
 Percent in the User Councils Formula 1 system 

00:05:13.589 --> 00:05:16.650
 Lüthi SZ fears Turkish Izmir 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:19.880
 Internet Explorer also did a lot of re-setting or it's cold 

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.939
 Rinse off should also be for other users 

00:05:21.939 --> 00:05:24.849
 who have no customer Count if the mortician concerns world is natural 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:26.430
 then Terhalle stations can 

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:29.400
 Below average are also quite practical 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.729
 because here you can make out half people, for example, the Windows Taterf 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.800
 Make songs so skarn general, you can do many of those things as well 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.360
 NLA - recruitment but with this program he has it as a three-hour 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:43.800
 For example, Lusthaus did not have to hire Swan Songs 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.450
 this is the system-performance Dawani guard in it can sometimes play a game 

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:49.430
 nice that one 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:52.749
 the Kathy Liebert tend to little but build a map series 

00:05:52.749 --> 00:05:55.520
 the percent 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.680
 I see that, for example, a basic percent 

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.650
 in this society can have 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.749
 and yes 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:05.879
 the Wars with the little tips about Windows NT 7 Starter or Windows 7 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.019
 In general, the year can change so that your right is No this place 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:13.770
 I'm bayer-star from Mandela TV for that, there are more 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:14.860
 interesting 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.270
 around 

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.520
 News about nature fast buying MIDs Chavez also meanwhile 

00:06:20.119 --> 00:06:22.589
 and of course gadget and programs 

00:06:22.589 --> 00:06:25.389
 which are also relevant in this regard 

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:26.330
 thank you for watching
