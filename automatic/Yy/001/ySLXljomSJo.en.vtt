here<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.319> have<00:00:01.589> another<00:00:01.740> shirt<00:00:02.250> that<00:00:02.490> has<00:00:02.580> been

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
here I have another shirt that has been

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.070 
here I have another shirt that has been
tie-dyed<00:00:03.240> with<00:00:03.419> bleach

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:04.080 
tie-dyed with bleach

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:05.720 
tie-dyed with bleach
I<00:00:04.110> used<00:00:04.589> a<00:00:04.710> stencil<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.160> a<00:00:05.250> brush<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.549> apply

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:05.730 
I used a stencil and a brush to apply

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.150 
I used a stencil and a brush to apply
the<00:00:06.000> discharge<00:00:06.450> paste<00:00:06.779> now<00:00:07.649> when<00:00:07.799> you<00:00:07.919> drip

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
the discharge paste now when you drip

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.100 
the discharge paste now when you drip
Dynaflow<00:00:08.790> it<00:00:08.940> spreads<00:00:09.330> in<00:00:09.450> all<00:00:09.570> directions<00:00:09.690> on

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
Dynaflow it spreads in all directions on

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.780 
Dynaflow it spreads in all directions on
the<00:00:10.200> fabric<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.740> is<00:00:10.800> called<00:00:11.160> wicking

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
the fabric this is called wicking

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.549 
the fabric this is called wicking
you<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.420> use<00:00:12.570> this<00:00:12.690> to<00:00:12.870> your<00:00:12.900> advantage<00:00:13.049> and

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
you can use this to your advantage and

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:15.259 
you can use this to your advantage and
still<00:00:13.740> get<00:00:13.889> clear-cut<00:00:14.280> areas<00:00:14.580> of<00:00:14.730> color<00:00:14.969> by

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:15.269 
still get clear-cut areas of color by

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:17.330 
still get clear-cut areas of color by
creating<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:15.809> barrier<00:00:16.049> with<00:00:16.470> water-based

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
creating a barrier with water-based

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.599 
creating a barrier with water-based
resist<00:00:18.650> applying<00:00:19.650> the<00:00:19.800> water-based<00:00:20.189> resist

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
resist applying the water-based resist

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:22.040 
resist applying the water-based resist
is<00:00:20.789> probably<00:00:21.300> easiest<00:00:21.630> out<00:00:21.840> of<00:00:21.960> the

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
is probably easiest out of the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
is probably easiest out of the
applicator<00:00:22.560> bottle<00:00:22.769> make<00:00:23.220> sure<00:00:23.369> it's<00:00:23.519> well

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
applicator bottle make sure it's well

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.990 
applicator bottle make sure it's well
mixed<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.359> then<00:00:25.350> outline<00:00:26.010> your<00:00:26.310> areas<00:00:26.789> that

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
mixed and then outline your areas that

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.460 
mixed and then outline your areas that
you<00:00:27.119> want<00:00:27.300> filled<00:00:27.630> with<00:00:27.840> color

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
you want filled with color

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.339 
you want filled with color
I<00:00:28.500> have<00:00:29.460> already<00:00:29.699> outlined<00:00:30.330> each<00:00:30.900> image

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
I have already outlined each image

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.170 
I have already outlined each image
except<00:00:31.949> for<00:00:32.130> this<00:00:32.250> last<00:00:32.520> one<00:00:32.700> here<00:00:33.000> at<00:00:33.090> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
except for this last one here at the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.810 
except for this last one here at the
bottom<00:00:33.649> the<00:00:34.649> barrier<00:00:34.950> works<00:00:35.219> best<00:00:35.520> if<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
bottom the barrier works best if you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.930 
bottom the barrier works best if you
allow<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.149> resist<00:00:36.750> to<00:00:36.930> dry<00:00:37.280> so<00:00:38.280> now<00:00:38.489> I'm<00:00:38.610> going

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
allow the resist to dry so now I'm going

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.060 
allow the resist to dry so now I'm going
to<00:00:39.090> outline<00:00:39.450> this<00:00:39.660> last<00:00:39.960> image<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.620> then<00:00:40.860> I

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
to outline this last image and then I

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.150 
to outline this last image and then I
will<00:00:41.280> show<00:00:41.430> you<00:00:41.489> how<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.700> apply<00:00:41.910> the<00:00:42.149> Dynaflow

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:43.160 
will show you how to apply the Dynaflow

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:46.700 
will show you how to apply the Dynaflow
when<00:00:44.160> you<00:00:44.399> are<00:00:44.670> applying<00:00:45.149> the<00:00:45.750> water-based

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
when you are applying the water-based

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.369 
when you are applying the water-based
resist<00:00:47.250> give<00:00:47.969> it<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.210> little<00:00:48.390> bit<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.750> space<00:00:49.140> it

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
resist give it a little bit of space it

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.860 
resist give it a little bit of space it
does<00:00:49.590> spread<00:00:49.920> a<00:00:50.039> tiny<00:00:50.430> bit<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.300> don't<00:00:51.539> want

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
does spread a tiny bit so you don't want

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.170 
does spread a tiny bit so you don't want
to<00:00:51.930> get<00:00:52.020> exactly<00:00:52.559> on<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.190> line<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.000> want

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to get exactly on the line that you want

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.639 
to get exactly on the line that you want
to<00:00:54.300> encompass<00:00:55.190> then<00:00:56.570> make<00:00:57.570> sure<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:57.899> go<00:00:58.109> get

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
to encompass then make sure you go get

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.229 
to encompass then make sure you go get
all<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> way<00:00:59.070> around<00:00:59.370> and<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.670> connects<00:01:00.059> on

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
all the way around and it connects on

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.080 
all the way around and it connects on
both<00:01:00.420> sides<00:01:00.719> if<00:01:00.989> there's<00:01:01.170> any<00:01:01.350> space<00:01:01.980> left<00:01:02.219> the

both sides if there's any space left the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.520 
both sides if there's any space left the
Dynaflow<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:03.690> spread<00:01:03.989> out<00:01:04.140> through<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
Dynaflow will spread out through the

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.130 
Dynaflow will spread out through the
little<00:01:04.769> gaps<00:01:05.580> in<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.540> lines<00:01:06.750> that<00:01:06.900> you've

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
little gaps in the lines that you've

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.980 
little gaps in the lines that you've
made<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.680> best<00:01:08.490> part<00:01:08.970> of<00:01:09.090> the<00:01:09.210> next<00:01:09.479> step<00:01:09.750> is

the design in this example I want to

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:45.260 
the design in this example I want to
show<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.040> how<00:01:44.280> well<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.729> can<00:01:44.880> blend

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
show you how well you can blend

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.600

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
different colors you can see here that

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.170 
different colors you can see here that
my<00:01:47.939> resist<00:01:48.780> lines<00:01:49.170> were<00:01:49.590> not<00:01:49.619> perfect<00:01:50.340> and<00:01:50.579> I
