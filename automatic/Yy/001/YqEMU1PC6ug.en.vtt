00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.500
 one person but how glad I am of the seven pontocom reactors with tobey 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.030
 traveling shows for you how to ride a positive requiem the cost 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.129
 first of all I'll introduce you here to the blog for those who do not know 

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:19.920
 here we have from the author where I talk a little about myself 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.789
 we have here the score that is of blog imposes explained 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.400
 here end 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.769
 This blog is half 

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.210
 which is actually demystify a little this world detectors 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:34.710
 which is you install the co-operation system from the app or on a machine 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.710
 not possible on mounted machine 

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.840
 where space 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.690
 we are everyone who collaborates with this blog we have people who write 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.720
 articles other team taking other than 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.140
 This brings us 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.360
 if you understand the subject and want to collaborate with us 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:58.360
 you can also get in touch with us and here 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.250
 be part of our team 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.700
 clue 

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:05.539
 I do not even know if this one really wants to exist or not 

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.550
 but it was a term that is the hair year of the world beautiful 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:11.420
 so the truth was what I did a lot of people talk 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.400
 the insider and etinho linked some point 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.480
 or in option is the system kernel by professional 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.480
 is what relates to the radio and does low level functions 

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:25.170
 so there are several companies that say pay is even the work itself not in 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.220
 he make improvements 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:29.079
 added other packages 

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.220
 and it's not just with their brands 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:33.970
 different then has a different date 

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 has or the line of Islam is short 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.380
 the only thing that oranges are up to date 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.280
 so in a boy-filled world that people do it in various groups 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.360
 technical 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.180
 who said the man who knows his apple operating system 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.260
 and they work on that operating system can make it work in 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.409
 of a brand is not with that of a common mounted machine 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:00.350
 the great butt of what or any other machine 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.160
 then we customized all part of a booty 

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:07.969
 they put the sound card drivers video card network card 

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:12.820
 it seems that those years that fixed the disconnection of the mark that corrects 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:14.790
 as you can imagine imagine 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.189
 So he knows with that. 

00:02:17.189 --> 00:02:21.530
 the needs of each indicated distribution will 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.090
 so you have there the leiria and swimming pool eb 

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:26.170
 I go there 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.210
 there was this you were on torrent sites if you will stay 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.480
 I think until December the data and distributions and compatible 

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:36.960
 we have here the basis 

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.960
 will never be a very important part by the following 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.340
 hcl it is a Hindu term 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.340
 d for hardware compatibility analysis 

00:02:46.919 --> 00:02:49.209
 there is a website that I will open that in parallel 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.719
 kate alencar lula on the blog 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:55.410
 whenever you are thinking of being between 5th place do not waste time 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.169
 taking any distribution 

00:02:57.169 --> 00:03:00.659
 and playing on your machine first and foremost you 

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:02.339
 have to see this site 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:06.169
 fills in case if the defendant would have compatible or not if it is not minimally 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:09.149
 compatible your process is wasting time 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:12.649
 because you may have managed to install the cpi will not stay stable 

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:17.810
 or you will not network you will not have the aefa yet the sony 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.480
 the video will load 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.480
 so first of all you have to go to this site 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:28.109
 here you can consult worried of the laptops of this stolen total 

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:32.369
 component items and radiates 

00:03:32.369 --> 00:03:35.689
 we have here motherboards here motherboard manufacturers 

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:37.949
 processors 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:41.150
 video cards and sound cards 

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:46.620
 if you want to look for something and do not stay here 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.089
 listing you may not have bought the fqm socas and search 

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:54.559
 and then I'll look for example that we use here that is a yamaha 

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:57.829
 945 

00:03:57.829 --> 00:04:02.259
 so here you will be, you will see if it is compatible or not 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:05.939
 If you're going to have any kind of problem 

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:09.429
 here I'm talking that it's going to turn everything right they'll get another plate 

00:04:09.429 --> 00:04:13.079
 look only from the settings that you will have to book for you 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:14.799
 cool little round 

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:19.840
 then leader within that site today the beat to 4 what is the dose that 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.300
 that recommends that you are the musician. 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.260
 I wanted you to customize it 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.410
 What's the fancy video 7 

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.990
 and we want to see if everything works fine 

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:32.740
 you will have some restriction of not being able to turn off the machine 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:36.689
 megawatts so it sounded the without network card something like this 

00:04:37.789 --> 00:04:43.069
 the very discussed item and the 5th lot is the 'performance' of the machines a lot 

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.710
 people say year because it's a mac it's expensive because at the local time it has to 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.460
 best 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 and so it's expensive 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.710
 It's not like that at the time, I add good things, but she got a 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.330
 little outdated you get very tied up 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:59.479
 if you want to increase a memory suddenly you do not have those batches or 

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:01.710
 the motherboard is not compatible 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:05.699
 is that the more HD places have to be given this year because 20 on the card and finally 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:08.699
 the cade like on my own mac 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.669
 so we set up your beijing thorax and you can use software called 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.320
 is also here that will do and I will give a battery of tests will test seven 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:20.320
 marriage or video card 

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:22.870
 the hard drive 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.730
 created for a score that your set we have here are very small 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:28.990
 or the bald little in the next video 

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:33.259
 is a real decent attendance already achieved 138 points a machine 

00:05:33.259 --> 00:05:35.469
 legitimacy and with the remake 

00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:40.319
 it is the 131 points seventh mark of a thousand reais is hitting the mark of 4 thousand 

00:05:40.319 --> 00:05:41.809
 real 

00:05:41.809 --> 00:05:46.840
 and if you want to subscribe to one of our order you come here in acesa 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:49.840
 You'll have to get the patient to sign the feed. 

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.100
 and here in the corner you have here categories of few 

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.410
 every time we take a course trying to categorize it in a way that 

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:59.340
 you can 

00:05:59.340 --> 00:06:01.650
 the key what you that is easier 

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:03.939
 components tokens for example 

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.869
 has several texts that we made using memory card video board 

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:09.100
 very scary 

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.729
 which are compatible with the actors 

00:06:11.729 --> 00:06:13.050
 experiences 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:14.589
 everything that we go through 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:16.599
 Emilio 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.389
 - I intend to put one or he towers and not 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:21.419
 the time 

00:06:21.419 --> 00:06:25.969
 hp he goes there and does a course have to put on my start at 5 00 ball 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:29.050
 has gone through this will only generate experiences 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:32.190
 in complete models 

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:34.439
 using these components up here 

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:37.879
 we assemble here some models because if you 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.439
 I went looking for several models 

00:06:41.439 --> 00:06:45.989
 it will end up going crazy and why right the motherboard does not work with a 

00:06:45.989 --> 00:06:47.240
 memory so beautiful 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.089
 different 

00:06:48.089 --> 00:06:52.909
 to the socket in a socket on the motherboard because the frequency is not the same 

00:06:52.909 --> 00:06:57.289
 so we tried to reduce that we made that choice of supereconomic 

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:00.089
 woman cheeses now in the next video 

00:07:00.089 --> 00:07:04.399
 and we have a range of models fitted if you're on a budget 

00:07:04.399 --> 00:07:05.229
 loose 

00:07:05.229 --> 00:07:09.499
 you can take a look at this post and here that this is not so agreements 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:13.809
 frame if you want it has man and follow this new core i7 of intel 

00:07:14.389 --> 00:07:16.979
 only they are machines there that you fine 

00:07:16.979 --> 00:07:18.169
 boil 

00:07:18.169 --> 00:07:22.740
 six hundred reais up to 4 5 thousand reais at the end of the video card perforation 

00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:24.370
 hd cabinet 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:25.990
 with the title if it is to be used 

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:27.530
 so go there pro video
