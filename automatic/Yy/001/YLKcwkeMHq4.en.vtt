with the contracted heals because one of

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.549 
with the contracted heals because one of

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
the best ways to help that is by putting

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.799 
the best ways to help that is by putting
an<00:00:54.889> impression<00:00:55.489> material<00:00:55.609> in<00:00:56.030> the<00:00:56.420> sole<00:00:56.780> of

00:00:56.799 --> 00:00:56.809 
an impression material in the sole of

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.160 
an impression material in the sole of
the<00:00:57.019> foot<00:00:57.199> and<00:00:57.579> and<00:00:58.579> that<00:00:59.299> helps<00:00:59.629> put<00:00:59.869> pressure

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
the foot and and that helps put pressure

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:01.840 
the foot and and that helps put pressure
on<00:01:00.379> the<00:01:00.469> Frog<00:01:00.709> which<00:01:00.920> helps<00:01:01.219> keep<00:01:01.369> those<00:01:01.549> hills

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:01.850 
on the Frog which helps keep those hills

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.389 
on the Frog which helps keep those hills
fresh<00:01:02.179> also<00:01:02.719> putting<00:01:03.170> a<00:01:03.499> hill<00:01:03.829> spring<00:01:04.159> in<00:01:04.309> it

00:01:04.389 --> 00:01:04.399 
fresh also putting a hill spring in it

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:07.539 
fresh also putting a hill spring in it
but<00:01:05.030> in<00:01:05.329> the<00:01:05.869> great<00:01:06.350> wisdom<00:01:06.680> of<00:01:06.979> the<00:01:07.130> USDA

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:07.549

they've made it illegal to put Hill
Springs<00:01:09.829> in<00:01:10.119> they've<00:01:11.119> made<00:01:11.329> it<00:01:11.450> illegal<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
Springs in they've made it illegal to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.289 
Springs in they've made it illegal to
put<00:01:12.200> certain<00:01:12.380> types<00:01:12.710> of<00:01:13.240> impression<00:01:14.240> material

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
put certain types of impression material

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:16.630 
put certain types of impression material
in<00:01:14.750> so<00:01:15.049> these<00:01:15.590> guys<00:01:15.829> have<00:01:16.070> sort<00:01:16.250> of<00:01:16.340> handicap

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:16.640 
in so these guys have sort of handicap

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:19.990 
in so these guys have sort of handicap
to<00:01:16.969> what<00:01:17.119> they<00:01:17.270> can<00:01:17.450> do<00:01:18.310> I'm<00:01:19.310> gonna<00:01:19.460> palpate<00:01:19.670> in

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
first than the move will work it

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.249 
first than the move will work it
backwards<00:01:22.310> and<00:01:22.460> do<00:01:22.579> the<00:01:25.000> look<00:01:26.000> at<00:01:26.149> his
