00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.019 

now<00:00:25.950> as<00:00:26.100> I<00:00:26.220> mentioned<00:00:26.640> in<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.790> previous

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
now as I mentioned in the previous

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.510 
now as I mentioned in the previous
tutorial<00:00:27.840> as<00:00:28.170> well<00:00:28.500> as<00:00:28.619> the<00:00:28.740> luma<00:00:29.130> corrector

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:29.520 
tutorial as well as the luma corrector

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:31.640 
tutorial as well as the luma corrector
and<00:00:29.610> the<00:00:29.700> luma<00:00:29.970> curves<00:00:30.240> there<00:00:31.020> are<00:00:31.200> actually

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
and the luma curves there are actually

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.930 
and the luma curves there are actually
RGB<00:00:32.400> color<00:00:32.880> correctors<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:34.190> RGB<00:00:35.190> curves<00:00:35.520> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
RGB color correctors and RGB curves and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:38.960 
RGB color correctors and RGB curves and
they<00:00:36.540> work<00:00:36.810> in<00:00:37.050> this<00:00:37.230> way<00:00:37.470> the<00:00:38.010> luma<00:00:38.520> ones<00:00:38.730> are

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
they work in this way the luma ones are

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.270 
they work in this way the luma ones are
just<00:00:39.300> interested<00:00:40.020> in<00:00:40.079> the<00:00:40.140> luminance<00:00:40.860> of<00:00:41.010> a

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
just interested in the luminance of a

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.150 
just interested in the luminance of a
shot<00:00:41.750> allowing<00:00:42.750> you<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:43.050> then<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.410> separate

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
shot allowing you to then as separate

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.490 
shot allowing you to then as separate
effects<00:00:44.610> to<00:00:44.850> control<00:00:45.300> the<00:00:45.480> color<00:00:45.870> of<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.260> shot

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
effects to control the color of a shot

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.970 
effects to control the color of a shot
later<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.300> whereas<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.420> RGB<00:00:48.960> effects<00:00:49.530> will

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
later on whereas the RGB effects will

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.740 
later on whereas the RGB effects will
affect<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> luminance<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.090> a<00:00:51.149> certain<00:00:51.449> extent

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
affect the luminance to a certain extent

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.619 
affect the luminance to a certain extent
and<00:00:51.899> the<00:00:52.320> color<00:00:52.620> channels<00:00:53.269> allowing<00:00:54.269> you<00:00:54.480> to

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
and the color channels allowing you to

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.420 
and the color channels allowing you to
change<00:00:54.960> or<00:00:55.260> boost<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.680> color<00:00:55.920> channels<00:00:56.309> as

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
change or boost the color channels as

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:59.599 
change or boost the color channels as
they<00:00:56.789> are<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.870> if<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.079> use<00:00:58.320> a<00:00:58.350> luminance<00:00:59.039> control

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
they are so if I use a luminance control

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.729 
they are so if I use a luminance control
luminance<00:01:00.179> corrector<00:01:00.719> or<00:01:00.899> luminance<00:01:01.440> curve

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
luminance corrector or luminance curve

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.250 
luminance corrector or luminance curve
luma<00:01:02.280> curve<00:01:02.519> then<00:01:03.359> I<00:01:03.449> have<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> opportunity

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
luma curve then I have the opportunity

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.080 
luma curve then I have the opportunity
to<00:01:04.410> colorize<00:01:04.890> this<00:01:05.070> separately<00:01:05.640> with<00:01:06.060> a

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
to colorize this separately with a

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.080 
to colorize this separately with a
separate<00:01:06.630> colorizing<00:01:07.290> effect<00:01:07.680> whereas<00:01:08.400> RGB

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
separate colorizing effect whereas RGB

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.670 
separate colorizing effect whereas RGB
is<00:01:09.240> pretty<00:01:09.540> much<00:01:09.630> going<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.960> do<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.440> color

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
is pretty much going to do all the color

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:12.620 
is pretty much going to do all the color
correcting<00:01:11.100> taking<00:01:11.760> what<00:01:11.940> is<00:01:12.090> there<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
correcting taking what is there and

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
correcting taking what is there and
boosting<00:01:13.380> it<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.620> accordance<00:01:13.890> or<00:01:14.310> in<00:01:14.520> line

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
boosting it in accordance or in line

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.060 
boosting it in accordance or in line
with<00:01:15.120> the<00:01:15.240> luminance<00:01:15.660> changes<00:01:16.230> so<00:01:16.830> if<00:01:16.950> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
with the luminance changes so if you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:18.590 
with the luminance changes so if you
feel<00:01:17.280> that<00:01:17.430> overall<00:01:17.910> the<00:01:18.030> color<00:01:18.240> was<00:01:18.420> good

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
feel that overall the color was good

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:19.490 
feel that overall the color was good
enough<00:01:18.780> to<00:01:18.840> start<00:01:19.229> with

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
enough to start with

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.039 
enough to start with
then<00:01:20.009> you<00:01:20.159> might<00:01:20.369> then<00:01:20.579> say<00:01:20.850> RGB<00:01:21.570> curves<00:01:21.840> are

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
then you might then say RGB curves are

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.230 
then you might then say RGB curves are
going<00:01:22.079> to<00:01:22.259> sue<00:01:22.409> me<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.619> little<00:01:22.770> bit<00:01:22.950> better

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
going to sue me a little bit better

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.249 
going to sue me a little bit better
anyway<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.390> I'm<00:01:24.479> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.689> do<00:01:24.750> is<00:01:24.840> turn<00:01:25.049> off

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
anyway what I'm going to do is turn off

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.380 
anyway what I'm going to do is turn off
the<00:01:25.409> luma<00:01:25.650> corrector<00:01:26.100> and<00:01:26.970> I'm<00:01:27.119> gonna<00:01:27.210> make

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the luma corrector and I'm gonna make

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.179 
the luma corrector and I'm gonna make
sure<00:01:27.450> my<00:01:27.689> footage<00:01:28.259> is<00:01:28.380> selected<00:01:28.829> which<00:01:28.920> it<00:01:29.070> is

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
sure my footage is selected which it is

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.280 
sure my footage is selected which it is
very<00:01:29.579> mind<00:01:29.790> I've<00:01:29.909> moved<00:01:30.180> this<00:01:30.329> layout<00:01:30.750> around

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
very mind I've moved this layout around

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.170 
very mind I've moved this layout around
just<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> sake<00:01:32.009> of<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:32.189> tutorial<00:01:32.369> I've

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
just for the sake of the tutorial I've

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.940 
just for the sake of the tutorial I've
got<00:01:33.420> my<00:01:33.540> reference<00:01:33.990> monitor<00:01:34.170> here<00:01:34.619> with<00:01:34.799> the

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
got my reference monitor here with the

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.700 
got my reference monitor here with the
YC<00:01:35.340> waveform<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.479> the<00:01:36.600> Seal<00:01:36.869> chroma<00:01:37.530> turned

YC waveform with the Seal chroma turned

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.770 
YC waveform with the Seal chroma turned
off<00:01:37.890> such<00:01:38.070> just<00:01:38.280> luminance<00:01:38.759> my<00:01:39.329> program

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
off such just luminance my program

monitor here and I got to the color
corrector<00:01:42.270> workspace<00:01:42.720> is<00:01:42.930> what<00:01:43.049> we're

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
corrector workspace is what we're

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.800 
corrector workspace is what we're
working<00:01:43.350> in<00:01:43.680> so<00:01:44.100> I<00:01:44.130> click<00:01:44.399> effects<00:01:44.880> and<00:01:45.240> I

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
working in so I click effects and I

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.260 
working in so I click effects and I
typed<00:01:46.140> in<00:01:46.380> RGB<00:01:47.009> and<00:01:47.520> you'll<00:01:47.939> see<00:01:48.090> they've<00:01:48.240> got

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
typed in RGB and you'll see they've got

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.359 
typed in RGB and you'll see they've got
RGB<00:01:49.049> color<00:01:49.380> corrector<00:01:49.829> which<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.100> like<00:01:50.250> the

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
RGB color corrector which is like the

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
RGB color corrector which is like the
luma<00:01:50.729> corrector<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.780> I've<00:01:52.079> got<00:01:52.200> RGB<00:01:52.770> curves

luminance or or item that you want to
work<00:02:14.340> on<00:02:14.610> and<00:02:14.730> just<00:02:15.360> change<00:02:15.690> that<00:02:15.930> with<00:02:16.080> these

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
work on and just change that with these

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.340 
work on and just change that with these
curves<00:02:16.700> but<00:02:17.700> we<00:02:17.880> are<00:02:18.060> going<00:02:18.270> to<00:02:18.360> work<00:02:18.630> on<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
curves but we are going to work on the

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.699 
curves but we are going to work on the
master<00:02:19.590> one<00:02:19.980> here<00:02:20.390> we<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:21.660> accessed<00:02:22.440> note

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:22.709 
master one here we do have accessed note

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.180 
master one here we do have accessed note
to<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.069> RGB<00:02:23.700> channel<00:02:24.360> separately<00:02:24.890> so<00:02:25.890> that<00:02:26.069> if

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
to the RGB channel separately so that if

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.340 
to the RGB channel separately so that if
we<00:02:26.370> feel<00:02:26.640> that<00:02:26.670> we<00:02:26.879> play<00:02:27.300> with<00:02:27.540> the<00:02:27.750> bass

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
we feel that we play with the bass

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:30.320 
we feel that we play with the bass
here<00:02:28.590> and<00:02:28.830> the<00:02:28.980> RGB<00:02:29.340> are<00:02:29.700> not<00:02:29.850> quite<00:02:30.120> correct

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
here and the RGB are not quite correct

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.300 
here and the RGB are not quite correct
or<00:02:30.750> perhaps<00:02:31.380> we're<00:02:31.590> looking<00:02:31.920> at<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.130> RGB

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:32.310 
or perhaps we're looking at the RGB

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.240 
or perhaps we're looking at the RGB
parade<00:02:33.410> now<00:02:34.410> actually<00:02:34.710> these<00:02:34.860> are<00:02:35.010> very<00:02:35.190> well

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
parade now actually these are very well

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.460 
parade now actually these are very well
balanced<00:02:35.790> but<00:02:35.880> if<00:02:36.030> they<00:02:36.180> were<00:02:36.240> imbalanced<00:02:37.050> you

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
balanced but if they were imbalanced you

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.710 
balanced but if they were imbalanced you
could<00:02:37.680> go<00:02:37.830> in<00:02:38.010> and<00:02:38.160> change<00:02:38.430> your<00:02:38.760> are<00:02:38.970> your<00:02:39.420> G

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
could go in and change your are your G

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.140 
could go in and change your are your G
and<00:02:39.870> you'll<00:02:39.990> be<00:02:40.170> separately<00:02:40.980> red<00:02:41.670> green<00:02:41.940> blue

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
and you'll be separately red green blue

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.210 
and you'll be separately red green blue
separately<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:43.230> make<00:02:43.380> them<00:02:43.560> more<00:02:43.680> balanced<00:02:44.130> if

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
separately to make them more balanced if

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.730 
separately to make them more balanced if
you<00:02:44.310> want<00:02:44.550> to<00:02:44.760> so<00:02:45.450> what<00:02:45.660> we<00:02:45.780> can<00:02:45.930> do<00:02:46.140> is<00:02:46.350> we<00:02:46.560> can

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
you want to so what we can do is we can

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.620 
you want to so what we can do is we can
look<00:02:46.770> at<00:02:47.130> how<00:02:47.550> this<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:47.880> going<00:02:48.000> to<00:02:48.090> affect<00:02:48.420> all

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:48.630 
look at how this is going to affect all

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.990 
look at how this is going to affect all
three<00:02:48.960> channels<00:02:49.200> if<00:02:49.560> I<00:02:49.860> want<00:02:50.160> to<00:02:50.400> of<00:02:50.610> course<00:02:50.640> I

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
three channels if I want to of course I

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.220 
three channels if I want to of course I
can<00:02:51.150> affect<00:02:51.390> each<00:02:51.540> one<00:02:51.750> of<00:02:51.810> them<00:02:51.930> separately

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
can affect each one of them separately

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.500 
can affect each one of them separately
so<00:02:52.590> let's<00:02:53.220> do<00:02:53.490> what<00:02:53.700> we<00:02:53.820> did<00:02:54.000> with<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.240> luma

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 
so let's do what we did with the luma

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:55.730 
so let's do what we did with the luma
curve<00:02:54.690> let's<00:02:54.930> just<00:02:55.080> have<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.230> look<00:02:55.350> at<00:02:55.470> the<00:02:55.530> luma

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
curve let's just have a look at the luma

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:57.590 
curve let's just have a look at the luma
curve<00:02:55.920> we<00:02:56.100> pull<00:02:56.370> the<00:02:56.520> top<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.090> we<00:02:57.180> force

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
curve we pull the top in so we force

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.960 
curve we pull the top in so we force
more<00:02:57.900> pixels<00:02:58.260> towards<00:02:58.680> pure<00:02:58.890> white<00:02:59.130> and<00:02:59.430> more

00:02:59.960 --> 00:02:59.970 
more pixels towards pure white and more

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:02.000 
more pixels towards pure white and more
of<00:03:00.030> the<00:03:00.120> dark<00:03:00.390> pixels<00:03:00.810> towards<00:03:01.290> pure<00:03:01.560> black

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
of the dark pixels towards pure black

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.760 
of the dark pixels towards pure black
and<00:03:02.340> we<00:03:03.210> change<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.750> contrast<00:03:04.200> slightly<00:03:04.650> so

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
and we change the contrast slightly so

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:06.500 
and we change the contrast slightly so
let's<00:03:04.920> do<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> very<00:03:05.160> similar<00:03:05.580> thing<00:03:05.820> with<00:03:06.360> the

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
let's do a very similar thing with the

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.740 
let's do a very similar thing with the
master<00:03:07.020> so<00:03:07.470> let's<00:03:07.620> pull<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:07.890> across<00:03:08.430> and<00:03:09.210> you

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
master so let's pull that across and you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.780 
master so let's pull that across and you
can<00:03:09.870> see<00:03:10.080> that<00:03:10.350> looking<00:03:10.800> at<00:03:10.890> my<00:03:11.040> RGB<00:03:11.550> parade

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
can see that looking at my RGB parade

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:14.390 
can see that looking at my RGB parade
let's<00:03:12.780> just<00:03:13.050> pull<00:03:13.260> them<00:03:13.350> so<00:03:13.500> just<00:03:13.890> touching

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
let's just pull them so just touching

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880 
let's just pull them so just touching
that<00:03:14.520> 100%<00:03:14.970> line<00:03:15.380> there<00:03:16.380> we<00:03:16.470> go

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
that 100% line there we go

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.250 
that 100% line there we go
got<00:03:17.190> those<00:03:17.340> pretty<00:03:17.640> much<00:03:17.730> at<00:03:18.000> the<00:03:18.060> top<00:03:18.330> and

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
got those pretty much at the top and

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:21.140 
got those pretty much at the top and
let's<00:03:19.710> do<00:03:19.860> the<00:03:20.010> dark<00:03:20.340> pixel<00:03:20.760> see<00:03:20.880> if<00:03:20.970> we<00:03:21.060> can

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
let's do the dark pixel see if we can

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:22.820 
let's do the dark pixel see if we can
pull<00:03:21.300> that<00:03:21.390> down<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.750> it<00:03:21.840> gets<00:03:21.990> the<00:03:22.200> zero<00:03:22.530> line

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
pull that down so it gets the zero line

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.520 
pull that down so it gets the zero line
at<00:03:22.950> the<00:03:23.010> bottom<00:03:23.780> so<00:03:24.780> pulling<00:03:25.050> them<00:03:25.170> down<00:03:25.320> to

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
at the bottom so pulling them down to

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:28.910 
at the bottom so pulling them down to
about<00:03:25.790> there<00:03:26.790> just<00:03:27.230> about<00:03:28.230> to<00:03:28.380> touch<00:03:28.590> there

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
about there just about to touch there

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.800 
about there just about to touch there
you<00:03:29.040> go<00:03:29.250> so<00:03:29.700> we've<00:03:29.790> got<00:03:29.910> quite<00:03:30.150> a<00:03:30.210> nice<00:03:30.390> wide

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:30.810 
you go so we've got quite a nice wide

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.470 
you go so we've got quite a nice wide
range<00:03:31.230> and<00:03:31.610> now<00:03:32.610> I<00:03:32.640> can<00:03:32.910> pull<00:03:33.180> down<00:03:33.420> the

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
range and now I can pull down the

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.970 
range and now I can pull down the
contrast<00:03:34.080> a<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:34.170> bit<00:03:34.410> in<00:03:34.500> the<00:03:34.590> middle<00:03:34.680> to

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
contrast a little bit in the middle to

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:38.540 
contrast a little bit in the middle to
give<00:03:35.100> myself<00:03:35.220> a<00:03:35.430> very<00:03:35.580> similar<00:03:36.000> look<00:03:36.210> but<00:03:37.550> you

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
give myself a very similar look but you

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.370 
give myself a very similar look but you
will<00:03:38.670> notice<00:03:38.970> there's<00:03:39.360> quite<00:03:39.630> a<00:03:39.660> significant

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
will notice there's quite a significant

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.010 
will notice there's quite a significant
difference<00:03:40.920> between<00:03:41.160> the<00:03:41.820> RGB<00:03:42.420> curves<00:03:42.720> and

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
difference between the RGB curves and

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.500 
difference between the RGB curves and
the<00:03:43.320> luma<00:03:43.680> curves<00:03:43.920> because<00:03:44.550> RGB<00:03:45.150> is<00:03:45.240> working

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
the luma curves because RGB is working

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.120 
the luma curves because RGB is working
on<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.660> color<00:03:45.900> channels<00:03:46.350> and<00:03:46.530> not<00:03:46.650> just<00:03:47.010> the

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
on the color channels and not just the

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:49.700 
on the color channels and not just the
luminance<00:03:47.520> so<00:03:48.210> if<00:03:48.300> I<00:03:48.390> turn<00:03:48.450> off<00:03:48.870> RGB<00:03:49.470> curves

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:49.710 
luminance so if I turn off RGB curves

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.490 
luminance so if I turn off RGB curves
and<00:03:50.040> turn<00:03:50.340> on<00:03:50.610> luma<00:03:50.970> curves<00:03:51.330> you'll<00:03:52.110> see<00:03:52.350> that

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
and turn on luma curves you'll see that

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.970 
and turn on luma curves you'll see that
that<00:03:52.710> looks<00:03:52.980> quite<00:03:53.310> muted<00:03:53.970> in<00:03:54.150> comparison<00:03:55.020> now

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
that looks quite muted in comparison now

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.800 
that looks quite muted in comparison now
this<00:03:56.280> might<00:03:56.520> be<00:03:56.550> exactly<00:03:56.820> what<00:03:57.360> you<00:03:57.540> want

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
this might be exactly what you want

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.930 
this might be exactly what you want
because<00:03:58.080> you<00:03:58.380> intend<00:03:58.770> to<00:03:58.890> colorize<00:03:59.340> the<00:03:59.700> shot

00:03:59.930 --> 00:03:59.940 
because you intend to colorize the shot

00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:02.390 
because you intend to colorize the shot
at<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.420> end<00:04:00.630> with<00:04:01.230> a<00:04:01.260> separate<00:04:01.770> colorizing

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
at the end with a separate colorizing

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:04.790 
at the end with a separate colorizing
effect<00:04:02.810> so<00:04:03.810> what<00:04:04.020> you<00:04:04.140> want<00:04:04.320> to<00:04:04.410> do<00:04:04.500> is<00:04:04.620> go

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
effect so what you want to do is go

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:06.860 
effect so what you want to do is go
through<00:04:04.830> make<00:04:05.430> sure<00:04:05.640> that<00:04:05.820> the<00:04:05.940> luma<00:04:06.450> ranges

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
through make sure that the luma ranges

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.900 
through make sure that the luma ranges
are<00:04:06.990> all<00:04:07.140> perfect<00:04:07.650> for<00:04:07.770> your<00:04:07.920> shot<00:04:08.190> and<00:04:08.460> then

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
are all perfect for your shot and then

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.640 
are all perfect for your shot and then
put<00:04:09.090> an<00:04:09.180> adjustment<00:04:09.570> layer<00:04:09.720> over<00:04:10.140> the<00:04:10.170> top<00:04:10.290> or

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
put an adjustment layer over the top or

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.130 
put an adjustment layer over the top or
nest<00:04:10.950> them<00:04:11.160> in<00:04:11.280> a<00:04:11.340> separate<00:04:11.700> sequence<00:04:12.210> and<00:04:12.480> add

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:13.140 
nest them in a separate sequence and add

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.110 
nest them in a separate sequence and add
a<00:04:13.500> single<00:04:14.100> effect<00:04:14.550> which<00:04:14.790> is<00:04:14.820> going<00:04:15.060> to

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
a single effect which is going to

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.760 
a single effect which is going to
colorize<00:04:15.450> the<00:04:15.720> whole<00:04:15.930> thing<00:04:16.200> to<00:04:16.320> give<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.620> the

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
colorize the whole thing to give you the

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:18.620 
colorize the whole thing to give you the
sort<00:04:17.010> of<00:04:17.070> look<00:04:17.280> or<00:04:17.489> feel<00:04:18.060> that<00:04:18.239> you<00:04:18.390> want

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
sort of look or feel that you want

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:21.080 
sort of look or feel that you want
however<00:04:19.440> if<00:04:19.859> you<00:04:20.190> feel<00:04:20.400> that<00:04:20.520> your<00:04:20.670> footage<00:04:20.970> is

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:21.090 
however if you feel that your footage is

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:23.480 
however if you feel that your footage is
ok<00:04:21.450> in<00:04:21.540> the<00:04:21.630> first<00:04:21.900> place<00:04:22.260> and<00:04:22.530> you<00:04:23.130> want<00:04:23.370> to

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
ok in the first place and you want to

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.310 
ok in the first place and you want to
work<00:04:23.640> with<00:04:23.700> those<00:04:24.120> instead<00:04:24.630> you<00:04:24.930> can<00:04:25.080> use<00:04:25.200> the

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:25.320 
work with those instead you can use the

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.040 
work with those instead you can use the
RGB<00:04:25.920> which<00:04:26.640> is<00:04:26.850> actually<00:04:27.240> pushing<00:04:27.450> the<00:04:27.630> pixels

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
RGB which is actually pushing the pixels

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.660 
RGB which is actually pushing the pixels
in<00:04:28.200> the<00:04:28.320> red<00:04:28.500> green<00:04:28.830> and<00:04:28.890> blue<00:04:29.250> channel

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670 
in the red green and blue channel

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:31.760 
in the red green and blue channel
separately<00:04:30.060> which<00:04:30.750> is<00:04:30.930> boosted<00:04:31.380> the<00:04:31.470> colours

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
separately which is boosted the colours

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.230 
separately which is boosted the colours
as<00:04:31.920> you<00:04:32.040> can<00:04:32.220> see<00:04:32.370> so<00:04:32.550> we've<00:04:32.640> got<00:04:32.760> a<00:04:32.790> richer

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:33.240 
as you can see so we've got a richer

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.510 
as you can see so we've got a richer
looking<00:04:33.510> colour<00:04:33.780> in<00:04:33.990> this<00:04:34.170> now<00:04:34.980> you<00:04:35.040> do<00:04:35.340> this

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
looking colour in this now you do this

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.430 
looking colour in this now you do this
if<00:04:35.700> you<00:04:35.790> think<00:04:36.030> your<00:04:36.150> colors<00:04:36.540> are<00:04:36.660> ok<00:04:37.080> you're

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
if you think your colors are ok you're

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.320 
if you think your colors are ok you're
happy<00:04:37.740> to<00:04:37.860> work<00:04:38.040> with<00:04:38.250> them<00:04:38.460> but<00:04:38.970> if<00:04:39.060> you<00:04:39.090> want

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:39.330 
happy to work with them but if you want

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:41.300 
happy to work with them but if you want
to<00:04:39.390> colorize<00:04:39.750> them<00:04:40.080> separately<00:04:40.620> that's<00:04:41.100> when

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
to colorize them separately that's when

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.970 
to colorize them separately that's when
you<00:04:41.430> use<00:04:41.610> the

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:41.980 
you use the

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:44.130 
you use the
the<00:04:42.190> curve<00:04:42.400> workflow<00:04:43.030> so<00:04:43.720> they're<00:04:43.900> two

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:44.140 
the curve workflow so they're two

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:46.320 
the curve workflow so they're two
separate<00:04:44.650> workflows<00:04:45.220> now<00:04:45.850> you<00:04:45.910> might<00:04:46.150> turn

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.330 
separate workflows now you might turn

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:47.490 
separate workflows now you might turn
around<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.690> say<00:04:46.810> you<00:04:46.840> know<00:04:47.080> what<00:04:47.230> I've<00:04:47.380> got

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
around and say you know what I've got

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.710 
around and say you know what I've got
plenty<00:04:47.710> on<00:04:47.890> the<00:04:48.070> red<00:04:48.280> and<00:04:48.490> green<00:04:49.180> there<00:04:49.420> okay

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
plenty on the red and green there okay

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.630 
plenty on the red and green there okay
but<00:04:49.780> I<00:04:49.900> want<00:04:50.110> to<00:04:50.200> boost<00:04:50.410> more<00:04:50.770> of<00:04:50.860> the<00:04:50.950> blue<00:04:51.160> so

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:51.640 
but I want to boost more of the blue so

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.420 
but I want to boost more of the blue so
I<00:04:51.670> can<00:04:52.090> if<00:04:52.270> I<00:04:52.390> want<00:04:52.420> to<00:04:52.750> go<00:04:52.900> in<00:04:53.110> and<00:04:53.320> boost<00:04:54.040> more

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
I can if I want to go in and boost more

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.100 
I can if I want to go in and boost more
of<00:04:54.550> those<00:04:54.670> blues<00:04:55.060> up<00:04:55.300> if<00:04:55.480> I<00:04:55.630> want<00:04:55.900> to

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:56.110 
of those blues up if I want to

00:04:56.110 --> 00:04:58.650 
of those blues up if I want to
separately<00:04:56.710> because<00:04:57.610> I've<00:04:57.790> got<00:04:58.030> this<00:04:58.180> ability

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:58.660 
separately because I've got this ability

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:01.410 
separately because I've got this ability
to<00:04:58.840> get<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.380> the<00:04:59.530> separate<00:04:59.920> channels<00:05:00.340> with<00:05:00.910> RGB

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
to get to the separate channels with RGB

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:02.280 
to get to the separate channels with RGB
and<00:05:01.480> you<00:05:01.570> can<00:05:01.690> see<00:05:01.750> that's<00:05:01.930> actually<00:05:02.020> brought

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
and you can see that's actually brought

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:04.650 
and you can see that's actually brought
a<00:05:02.320> bit<00:05:02.500> of<00:05:02.590> blue<00:05:02.860> into<00:05:03.760> this<00:05:03.970> beam<00:05:04.270> of<00:05:04.480> light

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:04.660 
a bit of blue into this beam of light

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.300 
a bit of blue into this beam of light
here<00:05:04.960> which<00:05:05.110> is<00:05:05.260> quite<00:05:05.560> an<00:05:05.650> interesting<00:05:06.130> look

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:06.310 
here which is quite an interesting look

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.880 
here which is quite an interesting look
might<00:05:06.910> not<00:05:07.090> be<00:05:07.240> what<00:05:07.390> you<00:05:07.480> want<00:05:07.530> but<00:05:08.530> you<00:05:08.740> can

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:08.890 
might not be what you want but you can

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:10.200 
might not be what you want but you can
see<00:05:09.100> that<00:05:09.250> you've<00:05:09.340> got<00:05:09.370> access<00:05:09.760> to<00:05:10.120> those

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
see that you've got access to those

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:11.880 
see that you've got access to those
color<00:05:10.510> channels<00:05:10.900> to<00:05:11.020> play<00:05:11.230> around<00:05:11.500> with<00:05:11.680> them

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:11.890 
color channels to play around with them

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:14.070 
color channels to play around with them
and<00:05:11.920> change<00:05:12.760> them<00:05:13.000> as<00:05:13.120> you<00:05:13.420> want<00:05:13.660> to<00:05:13.810> get<00:05:13.930> them

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.080 
and change them as you want to get them

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:16.050 
and change them as you want to get them
a<00:05:14.110> lot<00:05:14.260> more<00:05:14.290> balanced<00:05:14.950> so<00:05:15.730> that's<00:05:15.910> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
a lot more balanced so that's the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.940 
a lot more balanced so that's the
difference<00:05:16.480> between<00:05:16.540> the<00:05:16.900> RGB<00:05:17.230> curves<00:05:17.680> and

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:17.950 
difference between the RGB curves and

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.040 
difference between the RGB curves and
the<00:05:18.040> luma<00:05:18.370> curves<00:05:18.640> luma<00:05:19.510> curves<00:05:19.750> you<00:05:19.930> would

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
the luma curves luma curves you would

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.530 
the luma curves luma curves you would
use<00:05:20.290> if<00:05:20.470> you<00:05:20.500> intend<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.010> colorize<00:05:21.540> separately
