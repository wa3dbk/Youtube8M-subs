00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:07.839
 Yes Hello Thank always thank you for watching videos 

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:08.559
 Now we have to talk about the post-pre-main amplifier and analog record player ever 

00:00:07.839 --> 00:00:12.480
 Was 

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:19.050
 I would like to talk about speakers today 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:24.029
 The speakers are really full when you go to a mass retailer and there are various manufacturers 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:30.240
 I'm sorry I'm sorry today because it is so hard to explain each one 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:32.470
 Well, I would like to talk about the speakers I am using right now 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.270
 Listen and plant in reference 

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:39.430
 After that, please go to the store and try to insist on various speakers 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.320
 Well then 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:46.140
 It is a speaker I use, but 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:51.390
 9 Qi Storr after to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.559
 Kind to Peter now using to play that record player in the living room 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.990
 I have myself 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:59.750
 The speaker using cheese here is here 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:07.790
 I Ron at 8 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:12.710
 This is a model number that says scn 8 I bought for about 12000 yen in a pair 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:17.260
 And this gives me that good for the usual 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:22.840
 It 's that saying that it will make Marby sound 

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:28.299
 Each sound has a thick and hearty sound . 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:32.619
 Just as a piece of that one, it's the first 2000 yen 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:39.540
 Or the Well cheap because such of either acoustic guitar 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:44.470
 I got the impression I wonder if not a little rely on the after stringed instruments whether such raw function 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:50.590
 Pantene wonder that acoustic guitar and selfish row 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.430
 Chords-I wonder if the sound of each chord is a bit messy 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.360
 I mean 

00:01:51.430 --> 00:02:03.130
 I got the impression it 's such a want to clear something or rather felt was the other 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.030
 Not a Well most 2000 So never bad speakers Do But if it can not be helped 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:09.340
 is 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:15.250
 If the people who listen to rock whether Poppo main think this even Ikeru enough 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:17.340
 Do not little faces just to Toka that classic Toka jazz Toka such delicate music 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.180
 I felt that 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:25.650
 continue 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:29.630
 The speaker used when playing a record player is here 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:32.860
 In manufacturers say say the Haiocha exclamation 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:35.950
 It's called fusion r 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.420
 I bought this for around 30,000 in the air 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.800
 Hmm 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.319
 Even Well also I'd have become in particular discontinued another in this new model is now 

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:48.020
 Selling has in the year retailers 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:53.930
 This is why there are thirty thousand 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:55.020
 The Tteyuu raw oysters, the better that will be extremely well without 's or the volume 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:58.320
 that 

00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:04.620
 Guitar chord or violin 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:11.280
 Such fine that kind of vibrato's creation is quite often that 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:13.560
 Us is of course that a snail nor Toka Toka Appendix hop even during such a popular music 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:15.010
 Because it will be enough 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.930
 The all genres 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:18.370
 I do correspond 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.340
 Just 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.620
 Speaking of the decision 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.099
 I wonder if the direction is unsuitable by cd 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:35.150
 For example this cg is awesome 

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:38.760
 Tonight I bass has become another of the thickness of the What Is that sound Once you have played in this cd a little 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:43.290
 There was a feel to Fu it 's such a no problem 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:50.400
 I wonder I say kana by Te' I mean Well the song depending on the genre 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:51.390
 A little orientation unsuitable felt that I wish or the place that clearly there, depending on the song 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.090
 But 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.970
 I think that oneself is enough if it comes out so much for 30,000 yen 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:02.540
 In the future 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:06.840
 It does If you are thinking of buying a speaker 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:10.440
 It is not about 12,000 yen and it is about this 30,000 yen 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:17.190
 It is recommended to buy about the third garden 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:19.370
 Conversely, it is not recommended to buy something higher than 30,000 yen personally too much 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:21.500
 I wonder why 

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:26.780
 that 

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:29.860
 Even if it is 30,000 yen, stand up after the place where the speaker puts it 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:34.200
 Position to put It depends on the position to put 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:38.460
 You'll be able me to issue 30,000 yen or more of sound 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:42.980
 Well, it's a little careless, so today's of that speaker 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.980
 Well I would like to talk about placement etc 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:46.370
