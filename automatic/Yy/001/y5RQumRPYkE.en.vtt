and there's neutral pyramids and temples
surrounding<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> area<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.670> it<00:01:03.030> really<00:01:03.260> blocks

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
surrounding the area so it really blocks

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
early game and I feel like it gives an

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.170 
early game and I feel like it gives an
advantage<00:01:09.150> to<00:01:09.450> turn<00:01:10.130> any<00:01:11.130> case<00:01:11.280> here<00:01:11.580> is<00:01:11.790> not<00:01:12.150> a

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
advantage to turn any case here is not a

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.580 
advantage to turn any case here is not a

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.609 
spawning at the seminole clock position
in<00:01:13.920> Terran<00:01:14.220> and<00:01:14.400> green<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.330> Savior<00:01:16.259> is<00:01:16.439> that

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
in Terran and green and Savior is that

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:21.130 
in Terran and green and Savior is that
the<00:01:16.740> one<00:01:17.580> o'clock<00:01:17.790> position<00:01:18.210> and<00:01:19.020> yellow<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
yeah if favors Terran I feel because

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.910 
yeah if favors Terran I feel because
Terran<00:01:24.030> can<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.479> defend<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.200> temples<00:01:25.770> and

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
Terran can really defend the temples and

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.289 
Terran can really defend the temples and
the<00:01:26.070> the<00:01:26.310> neutral<00:01:26.610> buildings<00:01:26.880> very<00:01:27.090> well

he<00:01:45.090> build<00:01:45.270> an<00:01:45.360> overlord<00:01:45.720> and<00:01:45.930> then<00:01:46.140> a<00:01:46.350> spawning

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
he build an overlord and then a spawning

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.530 
he build an overlord and then a spawning

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
saber could be going for either early

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.069 
saber could be going for either early
tech<00:01:50.189> or<00:01:50.430> perhaps<00:01:50.670> some<00:01:51.299> early<00:01:51.630> zerglings<00:01:52.020> to
