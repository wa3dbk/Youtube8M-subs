00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
 because 

00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:20.289
 In this segment, I have something else to deal with normally 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.170
 we're not considered a hero with Android though 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:25.460
 because the segment touched on it means 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.570
 Percent Schaumburgs of course other manufacturers and in this case 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:32.510
 I would like to see the WeTab from Germany the food 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:35.400
 an alternative to me well explained 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.210
 what I really class I think I've been from the beginning again and again 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.940
 have followed and always with one 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.770
 luckily he wanted to work for that 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.710
 was initially referred to as an ipad killer 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:50.910
 I do not think much of that stuff that you really do 

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.140
 Comparisons hires because that is not a year out of the white is not an Android 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.060
 Device 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:58.240
 if Germany approaches in more ways 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:03.180
 and that works is based on MeeGo and the third some possibilities 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.310
 do something under charm bonds 

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:11.290
 the song heart is integrated on the Intel Atom architecture is a 1 point 6 

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:15.970
 6 of the heart boarding schools and n450 pineview 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.310
 It device has a horse comma 6 inches at Scream multi-touch display with one 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.330
 Resolution of a thousand 366 times 768 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.290
 The device has a gigabyte of memory and delivers inputs and outputs once 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.159
 two usb ports a scom card reader 3com to five mm 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:38.620
 Stereo audio output input 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:43.540
 Percame a sim-card slot as far as the model is concerned and he is tough 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:49.050
 a mini hdmi output Lecter one of them parents stereo speakers and a 

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:51.130
 internal microphone 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.560
 Furthermore, the device has an acceleration sensor on sensors 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.460
 Ambient light sensor and Skibbe it in Tikrit 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.060
 as operating system MeeGo is preinstalled that is one 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.829
 linux variant the Fritzi 11 was developed for tablets 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:12.280
 In addition to the pure level applications you can normal applications on 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.009
 Installing the device year was the senior doctors Dube understood us 

00:02:17.009 --> 00:02:21.799
 html5 will support the future, there will also be the possibility 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.089
 Android applications to run on the device 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:29.049
 yes, that was such a rough overview of the relief organization 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.749
 For those who may be interested, there are certainly people 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:35.400
 saying the song is listening is not for me at all here i have to get in 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.279
 Read things in here I have to work now in terms of things like yes 

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:42.699
 too many freedoms, I may well too many mistakes 

00:02:42.699 --> 00:02:46.089
 Then there are people who say that's exactly the freedom I want 

00:02:46.089 --> 00:02:50.169
 Here I have the opportunity on the one hand Linux based Nico 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:53.869
 Application to be optimized specifically for tablets 

00:02:53.869 --> 00:03:00.049
 as well as Anette Dupper he applications I can percent in the future 

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:05.459
 Iran full applications I have the option of flash application 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.060
 on the device what he also optimized for too soon Flash 10 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.179
 Point two is also supported and the whole uses the graphics processor 

00:03:13.179 --> 00:03:17.089
 So here are many many areas that make the device very interesting 

00:03:17.089 --> 00:03:19.509
 Everyone has to decide for themselves 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:23.589
 whether that is something for him, they are definitely different areas again 

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.479
 a little closer look I want Marko Kon what is it all in that 

00:03:26.479 --> 00:03:27.719
 Ego market 

00:03:27.719 --> 00:03:32.299
 because they are running applications from Adobe Air on the Cup is pretty good 

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.849
 and of course the area android world I am exactly 

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:38.419
 because I'm an enthusiastic android user here and then I want to 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:42.670
 look closely what's up and what's not on the rent yes that was so 

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:45.669
 far to beat Zberg for today 

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:51.829
 Regardless of where you and her, I hope the flirting Scarponi SPD had and around 

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:54.829
 Develop the channel accordingly 

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:02.039
 on 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:06.029
 on 

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:16.029
 DAPD 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:17.049
