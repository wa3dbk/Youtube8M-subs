00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
this door on the right now all these

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.240 
this door on the right now all these

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
pieces are on this map in this area they

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.729 
pieces are on this map in this area they
can't<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.610> anywhere<00:00:42.090> else<00:00:42.300> your<00:00:43.079> pieces<00:00:43.320> may

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
can't be anywhere else your pieces may

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
be in a different location because they

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.020 
be in a different location because they
randomized<00:00:46.050> it<00:00:46.260> so<00:00:46.860> if<00:00:47.190> you<00:00:47.309> don't<00:00:47.489> see<00:00:47.640> an<00:00:47.730> arm

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
randomized it so if you don't see an arm

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.240 
randomized it so if you don't see an arm
the<00:00:48.809> arm<00:00:49.020> is<00:00:49.230> the<00:00:49.350> only<00:00:49.469> thing<00:00:49.680> that<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:50.100> might

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
the arm is the only thing that you might

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.889 
the arm is the only thing that you might
not<00:00:50.460> see<00:00:50.489> if<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> don't<00:00:51.059> see<00:00:51.239> an<00:00:51.329> arm<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.719> need

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
not see if you don't see an arm you need

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.590 
not see if you don't see an arm you need
to<00:00:51.960> restart<00:00:52.680> another<00:00:53.129> round<00:00:53.430> and<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:54.420> should

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
to restart another round and you should

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.970 
to restart another round and you should
see<00:00:54.780> an<00:00:54.840> arm<00:00:54.989> laying<00:00:55.260> on<00:00:55.410> the<00:00:55.530> ground<00:00:55.770> if<00:00:55.920> you

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
see an arm laying on the ground if you

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:57.350 
see an arm laying on the ground if you
don't<00:00:56.190> you<00:00:56.430> know<00:00:56.550> I<00:00:56.579> know<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:56.850> kind<00:00:57.030> of<00:00:57.059> sucks

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
don't you know I know that kind of sucks

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.599 
don't you know I know that kind of sucks
but<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:58.500> third<00:00:58.739> and<00:00:58.770> final<00:00:59.010> piece<00:00:59.280> is<00:00:59.489> the

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
but the third and final piece is the

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.910 
but the third and final piece is the
switchboard<00:01:00.149> right<00:01:00.329> here<00:01:00.600> take<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.710> to<00:01:01.890> the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
switchboard right here take that to the

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.100 
switchboard right here take that to the
table<00:01:02.160> add<00:01:02.579> it<00:01:02.789> as<00:01:02.940> well<00:01:03.180> and<00:01:03.510> you<00:01:03.840> can<00:01:03.870> turn

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:04.110
