because the you know what he did was
took<00:00:28.470> place<00:00:28.710> 2500<00:00:29.340> years<00:00:29.609> ago<00:00:29.869> he<00:00:30.869> might<00:00:31.109> have

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
took place 2500 years ago he might have

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:34.040 
took place 2500 years ago he might have
run<00:00:31.410> further<00:00:31.740> than<00:00:32.040> that<00:00:32.450> without<00:00:33.450> without

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
run further than that without without

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.950 
run further than that without without
stopping<00:00:34.680> and<00:00:34.860> even<00:00:35.579> engaging<00:00:36.000> in<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.420> battle

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
stopping and even engaging in a battle

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:40.670 
stopping and even engaging in a battle
with<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.290> Persians<00:00:37.829> on<00:00:38.100> at<00:00:39.030> marathon<00:00:39.660> in<00:00:39.930> the

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
with the Persians on at marathon in the

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.119 
with the Persians on at marathon in the
midst<00:00:41.010> of<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.129> run<00:00:41.579> so<00:00:42.000> Wow<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.989> don't<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.860> think

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
midst of that run so Wow I don't I think

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:46.100 
midst of that run so Wow I don't I think
humans<00:00:44.550> can<00:00:44.910> go<00:00:45.059> further<00:00:45.390> than<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.750> think<00:00:45.930> we

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
humans can go further than we think we

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:48.139 
humans can go further than we think we
can<00:00:46.140> and<00:00:46.770> we're<00:00:47.280> better<00:00:47.460> than<00:00:47.550> we<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:47.940> we

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
can and we're better than we think we

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.619 
can and we're better than we think we
are<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:49.320> think<00:00:49.410> that<00:00:49.620> you<00:00:50.039> know<00:00:50.629> sleep

rejuvenated and I just kept going one of

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.620 
rejuvenated and I just kept going one of
our<00:01:31.619> we<00:01:32.400> one<00:01:32.729> of<00:01:32.820> things<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.000> experience<00:01:33.479> or

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
our we one of things we experience or

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.030 
our we one of things we experience or
see<00:01:33.840> all<00:01:33.960> the<00:01:34.079> times<00:01:34.290> there's<00:01:34.650> no<00:01:34.799> off<00:01:35.009> button

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
see all the times there's no off button

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.560 
see all the times there's no off button
we're<00:01:35.579> seeing<00:01:35.820> that<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.210> more<00:01:36.360> that

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
we're seeing that more and more that

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.960 
we're seeing that more and more that
people<00:01:36.630> can<00:01:37.259> go<00:01:37.530> as<00:01:37.920> far<00:01:38.280> as<00:01:38.369> they<00:01:38.490> want<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.820> go

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
people can go as far as they want to go

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.569 
people can go as far as they want to go
we<00:01:39.630> see<00:01:39.810> if<00:01:39.869> it<00:01:39.960> run<00:01:40.439> through<00:01:40.770> broken<00:01:41.189> bones

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
we see if it run through broken bones

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:43.609 
we see if it run through broken bones
and<00:01:41.880> play<00:01:42.119> football<00:01:42.360> with<00:01:42.810> bone<00:01:43.020> sticking<00:01:43.320> out

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
and play football with bone sticking out

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.190 
and play football with bone sticking out
and<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.100> so<00:01:44.670> it<00:01:45.210> ends<00:01:45.420> up<00:01:45.659> becoming<00:01:45.869> an

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
and and so it ends up becoming an

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.530 
and and so it ends up becoming an
intellectual<00:01:46.710> process<00:01:47.640> how<00:01:47.820> what<00:01:48.119> are<00:01:48.329> your

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
intellectual process how what are your

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.080 
intellectual process how what are your
strategies<00:01:48.979> you<00:01:49.979> know<00:01:50.130> I<00:01:50.159> think<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.700> you

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
strategies you know I think that you

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.670 
strategies you know I think that you
have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.509> push<00:01:51.689> yourself<00:01:51.720> to<00:01:52.140> failure<00:01:52.500> and

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
have to push yourself to failure and

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.880 
have to push yourself to failure and
only<00:01:53.460> when<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.180> fail<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:54.990> find<00:01:55.259> out<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
only when you fail do you find out you

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:57.289 
only when you fail do you find out you
know<00:01:55.920> how<00:01:56.159> far<00:01:56.490> you<00:01:56.640> can<00:01:56.759> go<00:01:56.939> if<00:01:57.090> you're<00:01:57.210> not

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
know how far you can go if you're not

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.609 
know how far you can go if you're not
pushing<00:01:57.600> yourself<00:01:57.960> to<00:01:58.049> failure<00:01:58.380> you're<00:01:58.500> not

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
pushing yourself to failure you're not

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.499 
pushing yourself to failure you're not
trying<00:01:58.860> hard<00:01:58.979> enough<00:01:59.189> right<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.030> through

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
trying hard enough right so through

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.450 
trying hard enough right so through
failure<00:02:00.780> I've<00:02:01.140> learned<00:02:01.380> a<00:02:01.560> lot<00:02:01.890> more<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.430> a

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
failure I've learned a lot more than a

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.580 
failure I've learned a lot more than a
half<00:02:02.700> do<00:02:02.880> any<00:02:03.119> success<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.840> mean<00:02:04.020> success<00:02:04.409> is

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
half do any success I mean success is

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.499 
half do any success I mean success is
celebrated<00:02:05.070> right<00:02:05.219> yeah<00:02:05.490> we<00:02:05.729> pull<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.390> off

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
celebrated right yeah we pull it off

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.719 
celebrated right yeah we pull it off
where<00:02:06.750> we<00:02:06.780> won<00:02:07.049> this<00:02:07.200> race<00:02:07.439> whatever<00:02:07.950> you

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
where we won this race whatever you

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.729 
where we won this race whatever you
don't<00:02:08.849> learn<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.239> much<00:02:09.390> when<00:02:09.780> you<00:02:09.929> fail<00:02:10.319> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
don't learn that much when you fail you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:13.070 
don't learn that much when you fail you
go<00:02:10.890> through<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.129> lot<00:02:11.400> of<00:02:11.540> self-analysis<00:02:12.540> you

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
go through a lot of self-analysis you

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.400 
go through a lot of self-analysis you
really

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
really

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.310 
really
look<00:02:13.650> at<00:02:13.770> things<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.220> dissect<00:02:15.020> for<00:02:16.020> instance

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
look at things and dissect for instance

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:18.020 
look at things and dissect for instance
to<00:02:16.470> sleep<00:02:16.710> running<00:02:17.010> I<00:02:17.070> mean<00:02:17.190> intriguing<00:02:17.700> like

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
to sleep running I mean intriguing like

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.960 
to sleep running I mean intriguing like
if<00:02:18.240> I<00:02:18.540> could<00:02:18.990> train<00:02:19.230> myself<00:02:19.440> to<00:02:19.710> sleep<00:02:19.950> run<00:02:20.340> you

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
if I could train myself to sleep run you

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.700 
if I could train myself to sleep run you
know<00:02:21.090> how<00:02:21.270> far<00:02:21.540> could<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.870> go<00:02:22.050> so<00:02:22.290> I<00:02:22.320> started

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
know how far could I go so I started

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.490 
know how far could I go so I started
studying<00:02:23.540> migratory<00:02:24.540> birds<00:02:24.870> and<00:02:25.290> there's

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
studying migratory birds and there's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.490 
studying migratory birds and there's
actually<00:02:25.860> some<00:02:26.070> a<00:02:26.250> bird<00:02:26.940> that<00:02:27.180> travels<00:02:27.750> 6,000

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
actually some a bird that travels 6,000

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.890 
actually some a bird that travels 6,000
miles<00:02:28.710> without<00:02:28.950> stopping<00:02:29.340> and<00:02:29.820> what<00:02:30.600> it<00:02:30.720> does

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
miles without stopping and what it does

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.440 
miles without stopping and what it does
it<00:02:31.110> flies<00:02:31.380> to<00:02:31.590> a<00:02:31.620> very<00:02:31.920> high<00:02:32.010> altitude<00:02:32.910> which

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
it flies to a very high altitude which

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.050 
it flies to a very high altitude which
induces<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.050> drowsiness<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.730> falls

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
induces a drowsiness it actually falls

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.630 
induces a drowsiness it actually falls
asleep<00:02:36.570> and<00:02:36.810> glides<00:02:37.320> downward<00:02:38.100> and<00:02:38.310> then<00:02:38.520> when

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
asleep and glides downward and then when

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.300 
asleep and glides downward and then when
it<00:02:38.730> gets<00:02:38.880> into<00:02:39.180> a<00:02:39.210> lower<00:02:39.540> more<00:02:40.290> oxygen<00:02:40.890> rich

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:41.310 
it gets into a lower more oxygen rich

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:44.330 
it gets into a lower more oxygen rich
altitude<00:02:42.270> it<00:02:42.480> wakes<00:02:42.960> back<00:02:43.200> up<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.710> that's<00:02:44.190> how

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
altitude it wakes back up and that's how

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.270 
altitude it wakes back up and that's how
it<00:02:44.490> sleeps<00:02:44.850> doesn't<00:02:45.690> stop<00:02:45.990> for<00:02:46.040> 6,000<00:02:47.040> miles

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
it sleeps doesn't stop for 6,000 miles

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.870 
it sleeps doesn't stop for 6,000 miles
and<00:02:48.090> I<00:02:48.210> thought<00:02:48.450> that's<00:02:49.290> just<00:02:49.650> incredible<00:02:50.580> can

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
and I thought that's just incredible can

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:54.740 
and I thought that's just incredible can
I<00:02:51.030> find<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:51.390> he'll<00:02:52.700> live<00:02:53.700> i'm<00:02:54.030> depressed<00:02:54.510> towns

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
I find it he'll live i'm depressed towns

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.720 
I find it he'll live i'm depressed towns
pass<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.410> then<00:02:55.500> just<00:02:55.650> fall<00:02:55.890> down<00:02:55.920> i<00:02:56.310> just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
pass and then just fall down i just

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.130 
pass and then just fall down i just
think<00:02:56.820> of<00:02:56.910> the<00:02:57.000> implications<00:02:57.210> on<00:02:57.690> my<00:02:57.810> long

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
think of the implications on my long

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.790 
think of the implications on my long
distance<00:02:58.290> driving<00:02:58.770> for<00:02:59.040> myself<00:03:00.440> wow<00:03:01.440> that's

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
distance driving for myself wow that's

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.130 
distance driving for myself wow that's
amazing
