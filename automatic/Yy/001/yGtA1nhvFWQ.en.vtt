00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:08.160
 someday clash of titans will come 

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.160
 ride dragons 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.730
 ah 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.779
 to me 

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.580
 hello very good to all people 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.870
 welcome to a new gameplay in clash 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.969
 of plants and good 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.730
 already as you can see we have already advanced 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.640
 we have raised quite a level we are already 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.519
 an average height in this game with what 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:53.930
 which I'm going to start a little bit more 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:57.199
 take some advice to give some 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:59.809
 the odd occasion 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:02.850
 good before you start with the video 

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.790
 let's say the village as I have it now 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.800
 same here is a farming village worth 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.680
 basically that I have the castle outside 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:13.920
 and if I'm not mistaken in any comment 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.679
 you have put hey max mete the castle 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.780
 inside I do not leave it out because I want 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:21.179
 protect resources I care a 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.280
 I drank the glasses basically because their 

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:26.150
 very low almost always 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.360
 good 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:31.910
 as the title says 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.960
 the most fail attack that has been 

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:38.200
 to do is never mine yes sir is mine 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:43.070
 in this war we are right now 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:47.000
 against the revolution ers or something like that 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:50.210
 Well, basically, I've made some fails 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.970
 but I do not know how to explain it sincerely 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.940
 that is, there is a fail 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.280
 but faith is worth a star 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.750
 at least but good that attack let's say 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.070
 that I'm not going to teach it because it's a 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:08.240
 foolishness now yes the film more let's say the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.340
 up until I wanted to mourn 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:12.530
 when I was attacking and I saw that it did not 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.690
 that did not give that did not give good step 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.260
 They are attacking but anyway it 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.950
 good 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:22.799
 as it is let's say before we start 

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:25.470
 the war was missing a lot of time 

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:27.840
 put it that way where we had 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:30.799
 to decide who we attack what we do 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.959
 the blah blah blah good basically 

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:37.260
 let's say that this village number 4 was 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.910
 the most easy to win with attacks or 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:44.200
 be attacking with dragons 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:46.270
 and well I said look you know I'm going to 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.920
 attack him total I say I'm going to make sure 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:51.370
 three stars and then already the second 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.890
 gameplay and I 'll go somewhere else 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:57.200
 Well basically I'm going to teach you 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.610
 the attack that has been totally 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.470
 what a fac because I've been 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:05.150
 fucking fucked basically when 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.010
 you attack with dragons the most important thing is 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.590
 destroy the defenses as soon as possible 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.810
 airs and this guy had the defenses 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:17.630
 super super air outside the bony center 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:20.920
 of the circle of defense basically with 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.959
 which the dragons supposed they were going to 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.690
 let's say to destroy the camp the 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.550
 tower of archers were going for the defense 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.280
 aerial as also here the same 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:34.340
 Well without further ado let's 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.610
 put the repeat click as if your 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.610
 mother 

00:03:38.819 --> 00:03:43.920
 good automatically loose 45 dragons 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:46.319
 for this part because this journal is 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.019
 something more difficult but without realizing 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.719
 without coming to mind I have gone to the other 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.569
 part to drop the 4 dragons for the 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:55.609
 other side 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.859
 but the surprise when I came back here 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:00.379
 the surprise is that no dragon pinche 

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:03.079
 has not gone for the anti-aircraft of the 

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:05.709
 balls as in the other part happened what 

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:07.879
 same and how you have observed 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:12.349
 basically until my dragons 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.629
 they arrived at Atlas air late 

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:19.459
 another one did not even destroy them 

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.560
 and that was the end of my fucking attack more 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.509
 I do not tell you how well you know dragons 

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.090
 they go for buildings they do not go for the 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:28.400
 defenses that is not going to exactly 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:31.070
 by defenses and do not go by buildings 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.479
 whereupon what is found in 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.270
 that's what's going to destroy 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:38.060
 Well basically that's what 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:40.070
 happened with my attack the attack more 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.139
 easy that I could do until the 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:46.000
 today's good time there has been one more 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.040
 but that let's say not 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.200
 I've lost and you have forgotten me 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.900
 record it with pigs but do not 

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:57.370
 worry you will come surely 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:59.800
 well basically this was the file that is 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.990
 the attack plus fail I could do and 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:04.620
 if I'm not wrong the attack more fail of 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.600
 all the fucking clan with what guys 

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:10.240
 I hope you liked to learn from 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:12.910
 I'm worth taking an example of this for the 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.940
 who play at 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:19.150
 the resort clans and never ever of the 

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:21.670
 never care when you are attacking 

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:24.160
 safe states for you and have a 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:26.080
 second a second plan in case of 

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:28.840
 any problem 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.259
 basically I'm lucky because 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:35.199
 let's say that the boys of my clan have 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:37.150
 taken quite a few glasses and although the 

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:39.380
 others win us in fact they are already 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.560
 continuing to attack 

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.860
 where are they attacking 

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:47.680
 I do not know but they are finishing attacking we are going to 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:50.529
 see who attacked kratos made a hundred 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.419
 per hundred with which as you are seeing 

00:05:50.529 --> 00:05:55.100
 I'm lucky my boys have not 

00:05:52.419 --> 00:05:57.860
 done the same thing that I shit on the whore 

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:59.570
 so you guys swim when you go to 

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.220
 attack with dragons we are sure of 

00:05:59.570 --> 00:06:04.070
 what do you loose the dragons where you have to 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:07.430
 drop them and let go of the rage where there 

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:10.540
 that let's go to say let's destroy the 

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:15.020
 antiaircraft if you do not do that if you do not have 

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:18.080
 spells of rage then the council number 

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:20.240
 one is to go with lightning spells and to 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:22.900
 least destroy one of the anti-aircraft with 

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:25.400
 the rays good guys without more to say 

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:29.410
 I send you a strong greeting from 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:29.410
 ghd max and up to the next gameplay 

00:06:33.889 --> 00:06:37.909
 and good
