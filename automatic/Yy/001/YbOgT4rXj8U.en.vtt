00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:01.640 

the<00:00:00.630> next<00:00:01.050> thing<00:00:01.140> I'm<00:00:01.230> going<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.380> show<00:00:01.439> you<00:00:01.560> to

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:01.650 
the next thing I'm going to show you to

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:04.460 
the next thing I'm going to show you to
make<00:00:01.800> is<00:00:02.010> the<00:00:02.190> track<00:00:02.929> it's<00:00:03.929> just<00:00:04.110> something

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
make is the track it's just something

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.539 
make is the track it's just something
that<00:00:04.500> the<00:00:04.650> marble<00:00:04.920> can<00:00:05.040> roll<00:00:05.220> down<00:00:05.250> and

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
that the marble can roll down and

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.880 
that the marble can roll down and
there's<00:00:05.879> not<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.480> single<00:00:06.960> way<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.140> do<00:00:07.379> this<00:00:07.560> but

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
there's not a single way to do this but

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.839 
there's not a single way to do this but
an<00:00:08.099> easy<00:00:08.760> way<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.000> do<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:09.360> is<00:00:09.510> I<00:00:10.230> take<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.519> slip

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
an easy way to do it is I take the slip

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.829 
an easy way to do it is I take the slip
of<00:00:11.940> paper<00:00:12.410> when<00:00:13.410> I<00:00:13.440> fold<00:00:13.799> it<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.630> fold<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:15.719> into

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
of paper when I fold it I fold it into

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.529 
of paper when I fold it I fold it into
thirds<00:00:16.289> basically<00:00:16.859> but<00:00:16.980> when<00:00:17.940> I<00:00:17.970> fold<00:00:18.300> it<00:00:18.420> the

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
thirds basically but when I fold it the

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.540 
thirds basically but when I fold it the
first<00:00:18.779> fold<00:00:19.080> its<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.890> to<00:00:19.949> come<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.340> about

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
first fold its going to come to about

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.120 
first fold its going to come to about
here<00:00:20.779> and<00:00:22.550> so<00:00:23.550> if<00:00:23.670> I<00:00:23.789> were<00:00:23.910> to<00:00:24.029> measure<00:00:25.130> the

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
here and so if I were to measure the

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.970 
here and so if I were to measure the
distance<00:00:26.930> distance<00:00:27.930> from<00:00:28.109> here<00:00:28.289> to<00:00:28.349> here<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
distance distance from here to here and

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.230 
distance distance from here to here and
the<00:00:29.130> distance<00:00:29.429> from<00:00:29.460> here<00:00:29.670> to<00:00:29.730> here<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.939> want

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:30.240 
the distance from here to here I want

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:38.959 
the distance from here to here I want
them<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.449> be<00:00:30.539> about<00:00:30.750> equal

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:42.799 

and<00:00:39.480> then<00:00:39.600> I<00:00:39.629> put<00:00:39.840> grease<00:00:40.109> in<00:00:40.260> there<00:00:41.629> I'll<00:00:42.629> hold

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
and then I put grease in there I'll hold

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.290 
and then I put grease in there I'll hold
it<00:00:42.899> up<00:00:43.019> a<00:00:43.079> little<00:00:43.170> closer<00:00:43.500> you<00:00:43.620> see<00:00:43.829> then<00:00:44.300> it's

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
it up a little closer you see then it's

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.439 
it up a little closer you see then it's
like<00:00:45.449> I<00:00:45.539> said<00:00:46.370> the<00:00:47.370> distance<00:00:47.789> from<00:00:48.000> here<00:00:48.390> to

00:00:48.439 --> 00:00:48.449 
like I said the distance from here to

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:50.450 
like I said the distance from here to
here<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> distance<00:00:49.559> from<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.370> here

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
here the distance from here to here

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.459 
here the distance from here to here
should<00:00:50.940> be<00:00:51.030> about<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> same<00:00:51.539> so<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.199> next

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
should be about the same so the next

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.000 
should be about the same so the next
thing<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.739> is<00:00:52.829> I<00:00:53.010> open<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:54.799> I'm<00:00:55.799> going<00:00:55.920> to

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
thing I do is I open it up I'm going to

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.009 
thing I do is I open it up I'm going to
take<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.309> edge<00:00:56.640> and<00:00:57.000> fold<00:00:57.269> it<00:00:57.629> in<00:00:57.750> to<00:00:57.870> that

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
take this edge and fold it in to that

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:11.300 
take this edge and fold it in to that
crease

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.600 

really<00:01:11.940> the<00:01:12.090> goal<00:01:12.270> here<00:01:14.810> would<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.869> to<00:01:16.080> have

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
really the goal here would be to have

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.800 
really the goal here would be to have
sort<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.700> a<00:01:17.790> squared<00:01:18.240> you<00:01:18.600> and<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:20.190> want<00:01:20.430> both

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
sort of a squared you and you want both

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.050 
sort of a squared you and you want both
of<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:21.979> sides<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.159> be<00:01:23.310> about<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.610> same<00:01:23.790> height

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
of the sides to be about the same height

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:26.539 
of the sides to be about the same height
and<00:01:24.380> then<00:01:25.380> what<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.590> can<00:01:25.680> do<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.009> I'll<00:01:26.159> add<00:01:26.310> this

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
and then what I can do is I'll add this

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.460 
and then what I can do is I'll add this
to<00:01:27.150> the<00:01:27.240> roller-coaster<00:01:27.479> put<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.080> marble<00:01:28.380> in

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
to the roller-coaster put the marble in

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.430 
to the roller-coaster put the marble in
there<00:01:28.619> rolls<00:01:29.520> down<00:01:29.759> nice<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.000> easy<00:01:30.290> you<00:01:31.290> can

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
there rolls down nice and easy you can

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.010 
there rolls down nice and easy you can
add<00:01:31.590> one<00:01:32.190> track<00:01:32.430> to<00:01:32.580> another<00:01:32.640> if<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.780> wanted

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
add one track to another if you wanted

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.960 
add one track to another if you wanted
to<00:01:34.110> add<00:01:34.229> turns<00:01:34.619> to<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> track<00:01:35.280> like<00:01:35.520> this<00:01:35.729> you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
to add turns to a track like this you

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:41.359 
to add turns to a track like this you
can<00:01:37.190> so<00:01:38.190> all<00:01:38.369> you'd<00:01:38.520> have<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:38.700> do<00:01:40.130> open<00:01:41.130> it<00:01:41.159> up<00:01:41.280> a

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
can so all you'd have to do open it up a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.730 
can so all you'd have to do open it up a
little<00:01:41.399> bit<00:01:41.610> like<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:41.990> you<00:01:42.990> cut<00:01:43.259> through<00:01:43.590> the

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
little bit like this you cut through the

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.940 
little bit like this you cut through the
first<00:01:43.920> crease<00:01:44.340> and<00:01:44.640> right<00:01:45.360> up<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:46.470> the<00:01:46.590> second

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
first crease and right up to the second

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.510 
first crease and right up to the second
crease<00:01:47.160> I<00:01:47.429> don't<00:01:48.060> want<00:01:48.179> to<00:01:48.240> go<00:01:48.300> past<00:01:48.509> it<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:49.520> can

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
crease I don't want to go past it I can

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:53.149 
crease I don't want to go past it I can
do<00:01:50.610> it<00:01:50.729> again<00:01:50.789> like<00:01:51.090> this<00:01:51.770> right<00:01:52.770> through<00:01:53.009> the

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
do it again like this right through the

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:56.270 
do it again like this right through the
first<00:01:53.399> crease<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:54.140> up<00:01:55.140> for<00:01:55.950> the<00:01:56.009> second

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280 
first crease and up for the second

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:58.550 
first crease and up for the second
crease<00:01:56.750> if<00:01:57.750> I<00:01:57.869> wanted<00:01:58.080> to<00:01:58.140> turn<00:01:58.319> it<00:01:58.440> the<00:01:58.530> other

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
crease if I wanted to turn it the other

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.820 
crease if I wanted to turn it the other
way<00:01:58.740> I<00:01:59.119> do<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.330> this<00:02:00.420> way<00:02:00.600> through<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.619> first

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:01.830 
way I do it this way through the first

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.510 
way I do it this way through the first
crease<00:02:02.190> and<00:02:03.830> right<00:02:04.830> up<00:02:04.950> to<00:02:05.039> that<00:02:05.190> second

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
crease and right up to that second

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.790 
crease and right up to that second
crease<00:02:05.700> now<00:02:05.970> when<00:02:06.600> I<00:02:06.630> tape<00:02:06.990> it<00:02:07.200> let's<00:02:07.590> say<00:02:07.710> I'm

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
crease now when I tape it let's say I'm

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.009 
crease now when I tape it let's say I'm
gonna<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.100> marble<00:02:08.660> rolling<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.869> this

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:10.019 
gonna have the marble rolling in this

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.220 
gonna have the marble rolling in this
direction<00:02:10.370> I'll<00:02:11.370> probably<00:02:11.910> want<00:02:12.420> when<00:02:13.140> I

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
direction I'll probably want when I

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.180 
direction I'll probably want when I
overlap<00:02:13.709> it<00:02:13.920> to<00:02:14.069> make<00:02:14.220> the<00:02:14.370> turn<00:02:15.980> have<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
overlap it to make the turn have this

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:20.390 
overlap it to make the turn have this
one<00:02:17.370> on<00:02:17.459> top<00:02:17.730> if<00:02:18.329> it<00:02:18.480> was<00:02:18.630> like<00:02:18.750> this<00:02:19.400> the

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
one on top if it was like this the

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.699 
one on top if it was like this the

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
little bump so I want to fall down that

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.960 
little bump so I want to fall down that
bump<00:02:25.950> instead<00:02:26.280> of<00:02:26.370> trying<00:02:26.579> to<00:02:26.610> get<00:02:26.790> up<00:02:26.880> and

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:26.970 
bump instead of trying to get up and

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.240 

put<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.120> turn<00:02:32.360> that<00:02:32.570> way<00:02:32.780> I<00:02:33.020> go<00:02:33.920> the<00:02:34.040> other<00:02:34.130> way

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
put a turn that way I go the other way

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.820 
put a turn that way I go the other way
like<00:02:34.820> I<00:02:34.910> said<00:02:35.120> up<00:02:35.450> this<00:02:35.690> way<00:02:35.870> I<00:02:35.900> want<00:02:36.170> in<00:02:36.680> this

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:36.830 
like I said up this way I want in this

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:47.860 
like I said up this way I want in this
way<00:02:38.920> put<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.010> piece<00:02:40.190> of<00:02:40.220> tape<00:02:40.430> on<00:02:40.520> the<00:02:40.640> back

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.390 

if<00:02:48.290> I<00:02:48.380> wanted<00:02:48.620> you<00:02:48.890> to<00:02:49.069> turn<00:02:49.250> in<00:02:49.370> that

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:49.400 
if I wanted you to turn in that

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.610 
if I wanted you to turn in that
direction

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:58.120 
so you can also put the tape in the

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:00.809 
so you can also put the tape in the
inside<00:02:58.480> because<00:02:58.599> in<00:02:58.780> advantage<00:02:59.610> that's<00:03:00.610> a<00:03:00.700> how

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
front and the back it's going to be

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.040 
front and the back it's going to be
stronger<00:03:06.269> track<00:03:07.269> than<00:03:07.480> if<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:07.660> just<00:03:07.690> put<00:03:07.959> it

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050 
stronger track than if you just put it

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:14.970 
stronger track than if you just put it
on<00:03:08.080> one<00:03:08.170> side<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:13.080> that's<00:03:14.080> how<00:03:14.290> to<00:03:14.349> make<00:03:14.739> a

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
on one side and that's how to make a

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.480 
on one side and that's how to make a
curve<00:03:15.700> in<00:03:15.970> your<00:03:16.120> track
