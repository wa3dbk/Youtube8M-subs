about starcraft 2 the beta is already
been<00:00:06.150> out<00:00:06.240> for<00:00:06.420> a<00:00:06.480> month<00:00:06.509> and<00:00:06.899> we've<00:00:07.049> already

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
been out for a month and we've already

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:08.870 
been out for a month and we've already
seen<00:00:07.529> some<00:00:07.740> really<00:00:07.980> strong<00:00:08.340> and<00:00:08.400> interesting

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
seen some really strong and interesting

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.220 
seen some really strong and interesting
strategies<00:00:09.240> being<00:00:09.420> posted<00:00:09.750> around<00:00:09.840> the<00:00:09.990> web

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:12.230 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:14.480 

but<00:00:13.230> what<00:00:13.349> we<00:00:13.500> want<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.740> know<00:00:13.799> is<00:00:14.009> will<00:00:14.400> these

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
but what we want to know is will these

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.220 
but what we want to know is will these
strategies<00:00:14.940> actually<00:00:15.509> work<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.049> average

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
strategies actually work for the average

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.670 
strategies actually work for the average
Starcraft<00:00:16.830> player<00:00:17.750> put<00:00:18.750> the<00:00:18.840> top<00:00:19.020> here<00:00:19.289> it's

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
Starcraft player put the top here it's

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:20.599 
Starcraft player put the top here it's
going<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.949> testing<00:00:20.310> some<00:00:20.340> of<00:00:20.520> these

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
going to be testing some of these

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:21.620 
going to be testing some of these
strategies<00:00:20.910> and<00:00:21.180> we're<00:00:21.270> going<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.449> see<00:00:21.539> what

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
strategies and we're going to see what

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.529 
strategies and we're going to see what
happens<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:23.430> this<00:00:23.550> works<00:00:23.789> is<00:00:23.970> we're<00:00:24.420> going

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
happens so how this works is we're going

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.359 
happens so how this works is we're going
to<00:00:24.600> play<00:00:24.720> the<00:00:24.840> same<00:00:25.109> strategy<00:00:25.650> 3<00:00:26.130> times

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
to play the same strategy 3 times

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.679 
to play the same strategy 3 times
against<00:00:26.730> three<00:00:27.000> different<00:00:27.240> opponents<00:00:27.599> in

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689 
against three different opponents in

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.540 
against three different opponents in
battle<00:00:27.990> map<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.920> especially<00:00:29.039> we're<00:00:29.340> gonna<00:00:29.460> be

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
battle map but especially we're gonna be

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.389 
battle map but especially we're gonna be
trying<00:00:29.789> out<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.150> the<00:00:30.449> Terran<00:00:30.840> Rico<00:00:31.170> rush<00:00:31.399> this

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
trying out is the Terran Rico rush this

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.889 
trying out is the Terran Rico rush this
is<00:00:32.520> an<00:00:32.610> early<00:00:32.700> game<00:00:32.940> strategy<00:00:33.450> that<00:00:33.660> involves

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
is an early game strategy that involves

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.600 
is an early game strategy that involves
quickly<00:00:34.290> building<00:00:34.590> barracks<00:00:34.950> and<00:00:35.100> upgrading

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
quickly building barracks and upgrading

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
quickly building barracks and upgrading
them<00:00:35.730> with<00:00:35.850> techlabs<00:00:36.210> so<00:00:36.450> you<00:00:36.540> can<00:00:36.690> build

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
them with techlabs so you can build

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.990 
them with techlabs so you can build
Reapers<00:00:37.399> Reapers<00:00:38.399> are<00:00:38.430> really<00:00:38.790> effective

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
Reapers Reapers are really effective

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.369 
Reapers Reapers are really effective
against<00:00:39.450> buildings<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:40.020> they<00:00:40.110> have<00:00:40.230> really

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
against buildings and they have really

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.590 
against buildings and they have really
good<00:00:40.469> mobility<00:00:40.710> as<00:00:41.160> well<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:42.149> when<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.480> have

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
good mobility as well so when you have

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.700 
good mobility as well so when you have
about<00:00:42.719> eight<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.079> them<00:00:43.200> you<00:00:43.350> can<00:00:43.440> just<00:00:43.620> go

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
about eight of them you can just go

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
about eight of them you can just go
straight<00:00:43.950> for<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.129> enemy<00:00:44.399> base<00:00:44.870> so<00:00:45.870> let's

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
straight for the enemy base so let's

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:53.330 
straight for the enemy base so let's
take<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> look<00:00:46.410> at<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> top<00:00:46.860> did<00:00:50.780> great<00:00:52.340> all

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
take a look at the top did great all

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.830 
take a look at the top did great all
right<00:00:53.489> so<00:00:53.699> I<00:00:53.730> really<00:00:54.030> build<00:00:54.300> two<00:00:54.480> barracks

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
right so I really build two barracks

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.010 
right so I really build two barracks
equip<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.500> techlabs<00:00:55.920> for<00:00:56.280> each<00:00:56.430> of<00:00:56.610> them<00:00:56.730> and

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:57.020 
equip the techlabs for each of them and

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.189 
equip the techlabs for each of them and
this<00:00:58.020> will<00:00:58.170> enable<00:00:58.500> me<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.829> build<00:00:59.699> Reapers<00:01:00.199> so

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
this will enable me to build Reapers so

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
this will enable me to build Reapers so
I'm<00:01:01.320> gonna<00:01:01.469> get<00:01:01.710> eight<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:01.949> them<00:01:02.160> ready<00:01:02.370> and

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
I'm gonna get eight of them ready and

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.260 
I'm gonna get eight of them ready and
I'm<00:01:02.820> going<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:03.059> rush<00:01:03.210> straight<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> his<00:01:03.780> base

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.270 
I'm going to rush straight to his base

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:07.820 
I'm going to rush straight to his base
for<00:01:06.270> maximum<00:01:06.689> damage<00:01:06.869> I'm<00:01:07.320> going<00:01:07.590> straight

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
for maximum damage I'm going straight

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:18.220 
for maximum damage I'm going straight
for<00:01:08.070> the<00:01:08.130> enemy<00:01:08.520> command<00:01:08.850> center

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:18.230 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:26.950 

oh<00:01:20.950> I'm<00:01:21.950> gonna<00:01:22.070> creep<00:01:22.310> I<00:01:22.430> rushed

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:30.070 

Oh<00:01:27.430> No<00:01:28.430> mirada<00:01:28.970> is<00:01:29.150> still<00:01:29.540> gonna<00:01:29.659> rape<00:01:29.930> by

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.080 
Oh No mirada is still gonna rape by

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.930 
Oh No mirada is still gonna rape by
Reapers

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:32.940 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:36.860 

I<00:01:34.130> mean<00:01:35.130> you<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.370> one<00:01:35.580> victory<00:01:35.940> you<00:01:36.600> had<00:01:36.720> one

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:36.870 
I mean you had one victory you had one

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:38.900 
I mean you had one victory you had one
where<00:01:37.170> I<00:01:37.440> believe<00:01:38.040> you<00:01:38.190> got<00:01:38.370> Reaper<00:01:38.700> rushed

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:38.910 
where I believe you got Reaper rushed

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.170 
where I believe you got Reaper rushed
and<00:01:39.180> one<00:01:40.110> failure<00:01:40.820> what<00:01:41.820> do<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:41.910> think<00:01:41.970> that's

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
and one failure what do you think that's

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.550 
and one failure what do you think that's
roughly<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.810> righteous<00:01:43.170> all<00:01:43.380> right

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
roughly this righteous all right

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.040 
roughly this righteous all right
although<00:01:43.830> it's<00:01:44.160> a<00:01:44.250> 50-50<00:01:45.000> risk<00:01:45.360> because<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
although it's a 50-50 risk because the

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:47.600 
although it's a 50-50 risk because the
Reapers<00:01:46.560> now<00:01:46.800> they<00:01:46.980> take<00:01:47.190> a<00:01:47.220> little<00:01:47.400> longer

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
Reapers now they take a little longer

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:49.850 
Reapers now they take a little longer
the<00:01:47.850> bill<00:01:48.000> it's<00:01:48.300> like<00:01:48.420> 40<00:01:49.170> seconds<00:01:49.560> right<00:01:49.680> in

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
the bill it's like 40 seconds right in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.620 
the bill it's like 40 seconds right in
30<00:01:50.010> seconds<00:01:50.460> last<00:01:50.640> time<00:01:50.880> yeah<00:01:51.150> before<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
30 seconds last time yeah before the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.720 
30 seconds last time yeah before the
update<00:01:51.780> and<00:01:52.140> plus<00:01:52.800> if<00:01:53.010> your<00:01:53.130> opponent<00:01:53.310> spies

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:53.730 
update and plus if your opponent spies

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
strategy involves building an

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.650 
strategy involves building an
engineering<00:02:14.220> Bay<00:02:14.520> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:14.940> flying<00:02:15.390> your

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
engineering Bay and then flying your

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.410 
engineering Bay and then flying your
command<00:02:16.020> center<00:02:16.350> right<00:02:16.560> into<00:02:16.770> the<00:02:16.890> enemy<00:02:17.190> base

00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:17.420 
command center right into the enemy base

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.330 
command center right into the enemy base
you<00:02:18.420> then<00:02:18.600> land<00:02:19.050> it<00:02:19.230> and<00:02:19.350> upgrade<00:02:19.830> it<00:02:19.980> into<00:02:20.310> our

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
you then land it and upgrade it into our

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.130 
you then land it and upgrade it into our
planetary<00:02:20.880> fortress<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.480> then<00:02:21.600> it's<00:02:21.750> canon

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
planetary fortress and then it's canon

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.380 
planetary fortress and then it's canon
destroy<00:02:22.470> everything<00:02:22.830> it's<00:02:23.670> kind<00:02:23.880> of<00:02:23.910> a<00:02:24.000> risky

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
destroy everything it's kind of a risky

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.750 
destroy everything it's kind of a risky
strategy<00:02:24.450> because<00:02:25.410> that's<00:02:25.890> chance<00:02:26.340> that

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
strategy because that's chance that

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.040 
strategy because that's chance that
while<00:02:27.060> you're<00:02:27.240> upgrading<00:02:27.390> you'll<00:02:27.900> be

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
while you're upgrading you'll be

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:30.260 
while you're upgrading you'll be
destroyed<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:29.400> if<00:02:29.670> you<00:02:29.760> can<00:02:29.910> pull<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.150> off

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
destroyed but if you can pull it off

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.910 
destroyed but if you can pull it off
it's<00:02:30.510> pretty<00:02:30.780> high<00:02:30.900> reward<00:02:33.470> all<00:02:34.470> right<00:02:34.710> for

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:34.920 
it's pretty high reward all right for

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.560 
it's pretty high reward all right for
this<00:02:35.010> tactic<00:02:35.490> I'm<00:02:35.670> just<00:02:35.940> going<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.210> need<00:02:36.420> an

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
this tactic I'm just going to need an

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.090 
this tactic I'm just going to need an
engineering<00:02:36.959> Bay<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:37.470> I<00:02:37.500> can<00:02:37.680> get<00:02:37.800> the<00:02:37.920> upgrade

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.100 
engineering Bay so I can get the upgrade

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.699 
engineering Bay so I can get the upgrade
ready<00:02:38.550> as<00:02:38.790> soon<00:02:39.239> as<00:02:39.360> I<00:02:39.480> amass<00:02:39.780> enough<00:02:39.810> cash<00:02:40.350> and

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
ready as soon as I amass enough cash and

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:44.090 
ready as soon as I amass enough cash and
guess<00:02:41.489> just<00:02:42.450> lift<00:02:42.810> off<00:02:42.989> my<00:02:43.200> command<00:02:43.709> center

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:44.100 
guess just lift off my command center

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.910 
guess just lift off my command center
park<00:02:44.820> at<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.000> Holden's<00:02:45.390> base<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.870> get<00:02:46.709> ready

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
park at the Holden's base and get ready

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:56.390 
park at the Holden's base and get ready
the<00:02:47.130> upgrade

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.259 

Oh<00:02:57.500> mance<00:02:58.500> is<00:02:58.769> taking<00:02:59.099> forever<00:02:59.430> that's<00:03:00.150> not

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
Oh mance is taking forever that's not

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.640 
Oh mance is taking forever that's not
much<00:03:00.450> you<00:03:00.569> can<00:03:00.720> do<00:03:00.870> all<00:03:00.900> waiting<00:03:01.349> for<00:03:01.530> the

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
much you can do all waiting for the

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:13.120 
much you can do all waiting for the
upgrade<00:03:02.720> crap<00:03:03.720> I'm<00:03:04.019> a<00:03:04.079> sitting<00:03:04.500> duck<00:03:04.590> here

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:22.010 

okay<00:03:14.130> this<00:03:14.550> guy<00:03:14.700> knows<00:03:14.760> why<00:03:15.090> it's<00:03:15.210> doing<00:03:21.020> hmm

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
okay this guy knows why it's doing hmm

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.590 
okay this guy knows why it's doing hmm
didn't<00:03:22.590> see<00:03:22.710> this<00:03:22.860> true<00:03:23.240> apparently<00:03:24.240> I<00:03:24.270> can't

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
didn't see this true apparently I can't

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.620 
didn't see this true apparently I can't
park<00:03:24.840> my<00:03:25.020> base<00:03:25.230> on<00:03:25.470> creep<00:03:25.920> so<00:03:26.640> this<00:03:26.910> kind<00:03:27.570> of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
park my base on creep so this kind of

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:40.979 
park my base on creep so this kind of
makes<00:03:27.750> my<00:03:27.960> plan<00:03:28.290> very<00:03:28.860> useless<00:03:32.270> so<00:03:33.270> slow<00:03:33.630> ah

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:43.839 

so<00:03:41.989> that<00:03:42.500> one<00:03:42.620> didn't<00:03:42.920> go<00:03:43.010> too<00:03:43.069> well<00:03:43.189> huh<00:03:43.430> you<00:03:43.730> n

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
so that one didn't go too well huh you n

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.589 
so that one didn't go too well huh you n
0<00:03:44.510> for<00:03:44.659> 3<00:03:44.870> yeah<00:03:45.620> it's<00:03:46.280> pretty<00:03:46.459> bad<00:03:46.700> why<00:03:47.329> do<00:03:47.569> you

00:03:47.589 --> 00:03:47.599 
0 for 3 yeah it's pretty bad why do you

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.509 
0 for 3 yeah it's pretty bad why do you
think<00:03:47.720> it<00:03:47.840> was<00:03:47.959> well<00:03:48.319> hey<00:03:48.620> this<00:03:49.129> is<00:03:49.250> work<00:03:49.400> on

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:49.519 
think it was well hey this is work on

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:51.309 
think it was well hey this is work on
zerks<00:03:49.790> because<00:03:50.209> he<00:03:50.299> had<00:03:50.390> creep<00:03:50.689> and<00:03:50.959> you<00:03:51.140> can

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:51.319 
zerks because he had creep and you can

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:54.130 
zerks because he had creep and you can
plant<00:03:51.739> your<00:03:51.799> based<00:03:52.040> on<00:03:52.159> creep<00:03:52.569> be<00:03:53.569> it<00:03:53.989> only

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
plant your based on creep be it only
