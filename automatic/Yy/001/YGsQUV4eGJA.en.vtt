00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.100 
after reading some reviews about these I
think<00:01:10.770> these<00:01:10.860> were<00:01:11.540> one<00:01:12.540> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.689> models<00:01:12.840> that

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
think these were one of the models that

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.240 
think these were one of the models that
might<00:01:13.260> not<00:01:13.409> use<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:13.890> kind<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.070> introduce

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
might not use to kind of introduce

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:15.950 
might not use to kind of introduce
themselves<00:01:14.610> into<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.150> US<00:01:15.360> market<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.780> little

themselves into the US market a little
bit<00:01:16.049> better<00:01:16.170> so<00:01:17.060> what<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.090> read<00:01:18.390> was<00:01:18.420> these<00:01:19.049> were

like<00:03:24.060> i've<00:03:24.720> been<00:03:24.930> using<00:03:25.080> like<00:03:25.320> a<00:03:25.350> 24<00:03:25.920> or<00:03:26.160> 32<00:03:26.519> but

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:26.970 
like i've been using like a 24 or 32 but

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.090 
like i've been using like a 24 or 32 but
42<00:03:27.720> or<00:03:27.930> 40s<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:28.470> I<00:03:28.500> was<00:03:28.590> looking<00:03:28.799> for<00:03:28.950> these

42 or 40s where I was looking for these
are<00:03:29.250> 42<00:03:29.700> will<00:03:30.600> pick<00:03:30.720> up<00:03:30.840> a<00:03:30.930> lot<00:03:31.080> more<00:03:31.230> light<00:03:31.410> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
are 42 will pick up a lot more light you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.470 
are 42 will pick up a lot more light you
can<00:03:31.650> go<00:03:31.739> up<00:03:31.860> to<00:03:31.980> 50<00:03:32.310> or<00:03:32.459> 56<00:03:32.910> but<00:03:33.180> then<00:03:33.299> they<00:03:33.390> get

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480 
can go up to 50 or 56 but then they get

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:35.960 
can go up to 50 or 56 but then they get
kind<00:03:33.690> of<00:03:33.720> big<00:03:33.900> and<00:03:33.930> bulky<00:03:34.709> these<00:03:35.100> are<00:03:35.250> not<00:03:35.850> the

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
perfect size they're not really compact

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.880 
perfect size they're not really compact
but<00:03:39.120> they're<00:03:39.239> not<00:03:39.330> huge<00:03:39.690> either<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.260> they

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
but they're not huge either and they

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.240 
but they're not huge either and they
weigh<00:03:41.070> in<00:03:41.250> at<00:03:41.400> one<00:03:41.850> pound<00:03:42.120> in<00:03:42.390> 10<00:03:42.600> ounces<00:03:43.250> so

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
weigh in at one pound in 10 ounces so

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:47.750 
weigh in at one pound in 10 ounces so
they<00:03:44.670> come<00:03:44.850> with<00:03:45.000> a<00:03:46.160> sling<00:03:47.160> to<00:03:47.310> go<00:03:47.400> around<00:03:47.579> your

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
they come with a sling to go around your

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.190 
they come with a sling to go around your
neck<00:03:47.910> I'll<00:03:48.420> probably<00:03:48.630> eventually<00:03:48.840> get<00:03:49.170> a

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
neck I'll probably eventually get a

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.830 
neck I'll probably eventually get a
harness<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:50.160> holds<00:03:50.820> them<00:03:51.000> closer<00:03:51.420> to<00:03:51.690> your

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
harness that holds them closer to your

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:53.780 
harness that holds them closer to your
body<00:03:51.870> so<00:03:52.290> not<00:03:52.769> flopping<00:03:53.040> around<00:03:53.280> if<00:03:53.640> you're

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
body so not flopping around if you're

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.180 
body so not flopping around if you're
walking<00:03:54.000> or<00:03:54.329> climbing<00:03:54.450> the<00:03:54.810> running<00:03:55.190> like

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
walking or climbing the running like

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.910 
walking or climbing the running like
they<00:03:56.489> do<00:03:56.610> with<00:03:56.730> this<00:03:56.850> sling<00:03:57.680> their<00:03:58.680> rubber

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920 
they do with this sling their rubber

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.030 
they do with this sling their rubber
armored<00:03:59.340> so<00:03:59.579> they're<00:03:59.790> very<00:03:59.820> durable<00:04:00.570> and<00:04:01.040> so

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
armored so they're very durable and so

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:03.620 
armored so they're very durable and so
far<00:04:02.280> there's<00:04:02.489> really<00:04:02.610> nothing<00:04:03.000> about<00:04:03.239> these<00:04:03.450> I

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
far there's really nothing about these I

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.140 
far there's really nothing about these I
could<00:04:03.810> find<00:04:04.049> that<00:04:04.200> I<00:04:04.260> don't<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.970> again<00:04:05.970> for

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:06.150 
could find that I don't like again for

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.030 
could find that I don't like again for
the<00:04:06.239> price<00:04:06.450> I'm<00:04:06.750> just<00:04:07.019> incredibly<00:04:07.230> impressed

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
the price I'm just incredibly impressed

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:09.650 
the price I'm just incredibly impressed
I<00:04:08.280> was<00:04:08.340> thinking<00:04:08.880> else<00:04:09.030> with<00:04:09.150> a<00:04:09.209> bi<00:04:09.329> pair<00:04:09.540> of

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
I was thinking else with a bi pair of

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.740 
I was thinking else with a bi pair of
nikon's<00:04:10.610> because<00:04:11.610> for<00:04:12.120> the<00:04:12.180> price<00:04:12.390> I<00:04:12.570> thought

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
nikon's because for the price I thought

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.090 
nikon's because for the price I thought
they<00:04:12.959> were<00:04:13.049> probably<00:04:13.200> be<00:04:13.440> the<00:04:13.530> best<00:04:13.650> quality

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
they were probably be the best quality

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.280 
they were probably be the best quality
but<00:04:14.130> I<00:04:14.459> don't<00:04:14.820> think<00:04:14.880> nikon<00:04:15.269> has<00:04:15.299> nearly<00:04:16.140> the

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:16.290 
but I don't think nikon has nearly the

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:19.599 
but I don't think nikon has nearly the
quality<00:04:16.620> of<00:04:17.030> glass<00:04:18.030> or<00:04:18.390> optics<00:04:18.750> at<00:04:18.900> least<00:04:19.079> have

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
quality of glass or optics at least have

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.130 
quality of glass or optics at least have
these<00:04:20.609> have<00:04:20.940> I<00:04:21.209> do<00:04:21.270> some<00:04:21.510> research<00:04:21.660> on<00:04:21.959> them

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
these have I do some research on them

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.960 
these have I do some research on them
and<00:04:22.260> they<00:04:22.349> have<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> twilight<00:04:23.520> factor<00:04:23.910> of

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
and they have a twilight factor of

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.190 
and they have a twilight factor of
cloning<00:04:24.300> which<00:04:24.390> is<00:04:24.510> very<00:04:24.690> high<00:04:24.840> so<00:04:24.870> they're

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
cloning which is very high so they're

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.480 
cloning which is very high so they're
going<00:04:25.289> to<00:04:25.380> pick<00:04:25.500> up<00:04:25.590> a<00:04:25.710> lot<00:04:25.830> of<00:04:25.890> light

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:26.490 
going to pick up a lot of light

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:27.950 
going to pick up a lot of light
under<00:04:26.849> low-light<00:04:27.000> conditions<00:04:27.300> and<00:04:27.840> a

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
under low-light conditions and a

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.350 
under low-light conditions and a
brightness<00:04:28.229> factor<00:04:28.650> of<00:04:28.740> 19.4<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.789> that

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
brightness factor of 19.4 and that

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.460 
brightness factor of 19.4 and that
compares<00:04:30.750> very<00:04:31.039> favorably<00:04:32.039> to<00:04:32.280> some<00:04:32.669> of<00:04:32.759> the

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:33.470 
compares very favorably to some of the

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.020 
compares very favorably to some of the
better-known<00:04:34.470> brands<00:04:35.069> of<00:04:35.550> high<00:04:35.970> quality

better-known brands of high quality

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.210 
better-known brands of high quality
