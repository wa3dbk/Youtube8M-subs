00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:04.699
 or not 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.049
 this afternoon 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.049
 and I do not 

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:26.380
 to me 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 hello friends I'm an earthquake for the web 

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:37.780
 point is and today we are going to bring you 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.329
 the unboxing of a product that we believe 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.930
 that can be a must for 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:46.059
 get the most out of the upside is a 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.879
 classic and it's nothing less than a 

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.220
 dock and well a better dock for 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:54.129
 desk is this everything is a little bit 

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:56.470
 special if we compare it with others 

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:59.019
 because it has a built-in 

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:02.079
 hdmi output which will allow us 

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:05.530
 can connect it to a television or to 

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:07.539
 any means of output is valid for 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.520
 reflect them does not have any other kind of 

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.619
 screen so good if we would have a 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.050
 screen that I have as sim hangs then 

00:01:11.619 --> 00:01:17.200
 the limit would be in quotes in the 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:18.009
 infinite so if we enjoy 15.5 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.960
 with this product 

00:01:18.009 --> 00:01:22.060
 let's enjoy it even more and we're going to 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.070
 get much more out of our 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:26.950
 terminal that is a terminal focused 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:30.760
 mainly to productivity let's 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.740
 to perform the unboxing and there is no other 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:36.060
 there is no other more comfortable way than 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.060
 do it work 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.100
 the box that we take out has obtained 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:46.820
 is still protected by what 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.460
 that we must open 

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:52.250
 this is the case and here we are 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.160
 well with a thrower making 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.140
 current from the American connectors 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:58.970
 Americans to the European so 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:01.690
 logically it will come is transformer in 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.690
 the American version 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.190
 here is the transformer as we have already 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.649
 said and it was easy to intuit well in 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:12.750
 america we will not adapt it anymore 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:15.970
 European that simple 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:18.880
 only fitting that connector 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:23.970
 here we would have 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.970
 a second we have the HDMI cable 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.550
 to be able to connect the power to the 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:34.420
 2 tell you how good I imagine that 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.100
 be brace all the 2 that apart from 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:39.140
 allow us to see the image on the screen 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
 they will also allow us to load 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.940
 our terminal so let's have 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.770
 always the battery ready to 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:50.770
 any any emergency 

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.390
 and well inside we continue with 

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:55.000
 an instruction manual but that is 

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:58.300
 so simple to handle that we are going to ignore 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.020
 its reading we finish we see that there is no 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.020
 nothing else in the box 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:06.450
 so 

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.450
 let's take out the green 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:14.470
 here we have is a high product 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:19.209
 quality is a product that is anchored to 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.580
 samsung dock so no forgiveness of a 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.380
 excellent way although it is not official is 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:28.920
 of one of my favorite brands and that 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:32.080
 has a creation as simple as 

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:33.849
 connect it to the back 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:36.549
 food that we have here 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:38.769
 of the connector and have it connect the 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:42.610
 action connector to inah this is so 

00:03:38.769 --> 00:03:46.230
 simple as you see connect the 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:50.579
 feeder the power cables and 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.579
 the other end to the transformer 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:58.760
 and the hdmi connector but with this 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:02.150
 I'm going to apologize for a second that I'm going to 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:04.810
 be in the form 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:04.810
 electric 

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.170
 all right 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.680
 and good 

00:04:10.530 --> 00:04:17.220
 only 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:20.299
 we have to anchor our 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.299
 our terminal 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:30.600
 I will focus the image slightly higher 

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.220
 now my television is going to stabilize the 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:34.740
 image so for a second 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.619
 well it is possible that it disappears but it is 

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.899
 the my television that offers it 

00:04:37.619 --> 00:04:42.580
 those who comment have already passed so 

00:04:40.899 --> 00:04:46.249
 worry us face turns to 

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:50.330
 stabilize and return returns to actions 

00:04:46.249 --> 00:04:52.750
 this type of accessories allow us 

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:55.039
 they allow us a series of 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.210
 productivities to our terminal that 

00:04:55.039 --> 00:05:02.830
 with others maybe they would not have 

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:02.830
 from putting it horizontal 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:08.590
 from putting it to be here until even 

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:11.320
 inverted because it has such a hold 

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:14.470
 so strong that the terminal will not fall 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:15.860
 It is never a support with much 

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:18.620
 stability 

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:22.849
 and that will allow us a 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:25.529
 extreme productivity as you see is 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:30.319
 snapshot the screen 

00:05:25.529 --> 00:05:33.950
 if we are watching in hd at 1080p 

00:05:30.319 --> 00:05:36.350
 we would have been able to navigate 

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:38.910
 the whole screen would have an end 

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:41.930
 all our 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:44.750
 our our potential 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.560
 of 55 inches we would have them in a 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:50.710
 screen in this case can be 42 

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.710
 so 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:57.210
 I hope you liked it and thank 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:06:00.599

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:02.839
 product that as I say is one of my 

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:05.870
 preferred and that does not have a price 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:07.189
 prohibitive we are talking about 31.99 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:10.979
 euros 

00:06:07.189 --> 00:06:13.229

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:20.339
 with mobile fan is zero problems and 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:22.860
 infinite satisfaction so friends 

00:06:20.339 --> 00:06:24.930

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:27.319

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:27.319
