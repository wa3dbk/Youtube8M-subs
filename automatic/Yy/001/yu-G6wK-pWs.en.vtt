00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.960

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.869
 singed ampelous petunias now spend 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.150

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.090
 February 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.630
 I sat down in the snow just spilled 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.500
 It turned out very very thick here and here I 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:46.559
 cooked cups from cups 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:50.280
 the cup the holes made holes I 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:57.629
 I will do this very apple 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:01:01.670
 convenient fast the breaching 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:06.540
 holes now we will repot 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.510
 pre-moistened soil I straits 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:16.310

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:23.840
 here I have a container with petunias because 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:29.180
 rented on the phone 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:34.140
 so try to do it with one hand 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:38.369
 so hooked on dryhli Lupi instrumental 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.939
 also the capacity where it grows 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:45.590
 seedlings 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:50.610
 and we will also shed in order 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 in order to make it easier in order to 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.170
 it was easier to replace it and here 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:06.130
 a little bit like this toothpick under 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:10.430
 Loosen here here we have such here 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:26.540

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:43.250

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:08.040
 quiet and very important moment 

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:13.050
 definitely need a python from all sides 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:19.360
 so press countryman to the roots 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:22.030

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:26.890

 pencil take for leaf turned out 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:40.709
 moved 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.190
 and put in the dimple our Christmas tree 

00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:07.930
 so neatly and we press 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.930

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:24.930

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:30.680

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:35.660
 replace others are now portable 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:40.620
 cups with these seedlings 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.710
 to a place not a sunny place I will transfer 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:46.980
 to the north window and a few days there 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:50.550
 will get stronger and after that I'm again 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:53.430
 I will transfer them to the south window and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:54.870
 as if not to climb further pete not 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.160
 love to transfer 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:05:02.310
 and already later when behind the walls 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.640
 will be seen and will start about the brilliance because 

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.990
 the lid is a sign that you need a petunia 

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:12.770
 already transplant to another container 

00:05:08.990 --> 00:05:12.770
 Thank you for your attention goodbye
