00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:11.230
 watch the know eos 600d one 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.590
 compact slr with a lot of handy 

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.590
 features 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.090
 a carrying strap is supplied with a battery 

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:21.099
 and battery charger and a usb cable the camera 

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:23.320
 what we see here is the kit with the 18 to 

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:25.360
 55 mm kit lens 

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.239
 the 600d is a beloved camera among 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:31.419
 both photos and video we dig 18 

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:33.670
 megapixel apsc sensor and thick 4 processor 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.559
 he delivers good performance he is 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:38.109
 of course completely manually adjustable 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.000
 as we are used to from sls but on the 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.160
 model, we find various scene modes 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.620
 so that it can also be used for the 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.719
 less experienced photographer except 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.550
 scene modes 600d also had one 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:50.260
 number of filter effects to your photos just 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.550
 to give that little bit more 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.170
 the 3 is display has a high 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.390
 resolution so that you can judge well 

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.829
 whether that photo is sharp 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.600
 in addition, it is tiltable and 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.510
 rotatable so that you can easily 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:02.920
 shooting from tricky angles 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.839
 the camera can also be used as 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.760
 namely a studio camera 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.530
 about a built-in flash that is capable of 

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.100
 is it really the flashes are wireless 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.590
 to trigger 

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.090
 The great thing is that this flash is also like this 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.950
 Set that he didn't 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.710
 simultaneously with the external flash 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.480
 and you do not see him in the photo 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.460
 the camera is also very good for videographers 

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:23.380
 suitable because he offers complete 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:25.660
 control over the frame rates 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.490
 exposure and sound through the microphone 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.110
 You can also connect an external connection 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:31.300
 connect the microphone for the less 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.550
 experienced photographer also had 600d 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.140
 about a creative car booth where you 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.650
 easily achieve the effect whatever 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.370
 you are looking for 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.320
 without messing with the 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:43.330
 600d is a fine SLR with which 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.430
 the novice photographer can easily 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.050
 experiment with the settings and the 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:48.580
 advanced photographer equal a good one 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.690
 camera that does what he does 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.890
 asks 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.260
 the only drawback I think is that he doesn't 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 has a thick 5 processor this 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.460
 would ensure even better driving performance 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:59.200
 do you want to be able to take great photos and 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:00.790
 can make crazy videos with this one 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.560
 eos 600d 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:04.510
 order man on workdays at coolblue one 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.680
