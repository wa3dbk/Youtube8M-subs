00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:21.980
 Arrived at the knee, the muscle of the thigh is prolonged, at the level of the patella, by the tendon 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:26.700
 quadricipital and continues with the patellar tendon that fits on the bump 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:33.140
 of the tibia, called anterior tibial tuberosity. The ball joint is stabilized by two stays 

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:37.100
 Lateral baptized external fin and inner fin. 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.220
 In the event of excessive retraction of the outer wing, the ball joint exerts external pressures 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.910
 too much on the cartilage of the femur, called the trochlea. 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.989
 The surgical procedure performed under arthroscopy, ie thanks to two small incisions 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:59.020
 and a camera, is to cut the outer wing to remove the hyperpressure 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:04.000
 and thus reduce the friction between the outer part of the patella and the trochlea. 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:10.800
 The flap will then heal but more loosely 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.159
 Often the retraction of the outer wing is associated with a lateral overhang of the 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.420
 patella which is explained by the off-center insertion of the patellar tendon due to 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:43.780
 the position of the tuberter hump, itself too much on the outer side. 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.040
 This situation also generates excessive friction on the lateral part of the trochlea and 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.260
 causes patella pain and sometimes its dislocation. 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.700
 In addition to the fin section, the therapeutic gesture consists of moving the tuberosity 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.160
 which will have been cut beforehand thanks to an incision of a few centimeters. 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.860
 This one will be repositioned well in the middle of the knee, fixed by 2 screws so as to 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.860
 refocus the patellar tendon and therefore the patella in the middle of the trochlea. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:31.379
 The patella is now well balanced. The exaggerated friction that engendered 

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.699
 Patella pain and cartilaginous lesions are removed. 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.480
 These interventions may be associated with a specific treatment of the lesions 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.129
 cartilaginous at the same time. It is often useful to remove the screws 

00:02:50.129 --> 00:02:52.949
 once the consolidation is acquired
