00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:32.360 
you're doing maybe a little bit of a

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.290 
you're doing maybe a little bit of a
delay<00:02:32.660> that's<00:02:33.230> all<00:02:33.380> right<00:02:33.610> it's<00:02:34.610> generally

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
delay that's all right it's generally

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.460 
delay that's all right it's generally
pretty<00:02:35.330> fast<00:02:35.840> over<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.320> 3g<00:02:36.590> connection<00:02:37.330> I

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
pretty fast over the 3g connection I

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.930 
pretty fast over the 3g connection I
don't<00:02:39.470> know<00:02:39.530> if<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.800> could<00:02:40.010> hear<00:02:40.430> or<00:02:40.610> see<00:02:40.760> that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
good but it had like a three second

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.890 
good but it had like a three second
delay<00:02:42.819> and<00:02:43.819> right<00:02:44.000> now<00:02:44.120> I'm<00:02:44.209> still<00:02:44.540> streaming

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
delay and right now I'm still streaming
