again you just get we cocoa beans and a
little<00:02:00.180> bit<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.540> string<00:02:00.689> I<00:02:00.810> mean<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:01.079> guess<00:02:01.290> you

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
little bit of string I mean I guess you

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.200 
little bit of string I mean I guess you
could<00:02:01.500> make<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.649> boat<00:02:01.950> without<00:02:02.640> a<00:02:02.759> string<00:02:03.030> which

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
could make a boat without a string which

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.270 
could make a boat without a string which
would<00:02:03.450> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.990> be<00:02:04.140> useful<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.009> then<00:02:05.159> you've

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
would kind of be useful and then you've

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:06.319 
would kind of be useful and then you've
got<00:02:05.399> the<00:02:05.490> village<00:02:05.820> which<00:02:05.969> unfortunately

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:06.329 
got the village which unfortunately

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:09.199 
got the village which unfortunately
doesn't<00:02:06.780> have<00:02:07.020> a<00:02:07.049> blacksmith<00:02:08.000> but<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.119> know

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
doesn't have a blacksmith but you know

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:10.729 
doesn't have a blacksmith but you know
it<00:02:09.330> is<00:02:09.420> fairly<00:02:09.720> nice<00:02:09.989> it's<00:02:10.259> right<00:02:10.410> next<00:02:10.530> to<00:02:10.679> a

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
it is fairly nice it's right next to a

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.350 
it is fairly nice it's right next to a
jungle<00:02:10.979> biome<00:02:11.280> um<00:02:11.640> you've<00:02:11.910> got<00:02:12.000> plenty<00:02:12.180> of

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
jungle biome um you've got plenty of

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.550 
jungle biome um you've got plenty of
cave<00:02:12.569> systems<00:02:13.020> around

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
cave systems around

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040 
cave systems around
so<00:02:14.100> yeah<00:02:14.280> that<00:02:14.730> is<00:02:14.880> like<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.270> main<00:02:15.480> portion<00:02:15.900> of

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
so yeah that is like the main portion of

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.430 
so yeah that is like the main portion of
the<00:02:16.110> seat<00:02:16.350> guys<00:02:16.590> now<00:02:16.980> a<00:02:17.010> believe<00:02:17.459> it<00:02:17.610> or<00:02:17.670> not<00:02:18.440> if

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
the seat guys now a believe it or not if

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.890 
the seat guys now a believe it or not if
you<00:02:19.650> fly<00:02:20.010> off<00:02:20.310> in<00:02:20.580> this<00:02:20.760> direction<00:02:20.970> for<00:02:21.540> a<00:02:21.600> good

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
you fly off in this direction for a good

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.680 
you fly off in this direction for a good
maybe<00:02:22.319> a<00:02:22.440> minute<00:02:22.650> to<00:02:22.980> two<00:02:23.430> minutes<00:02:23.540> you<00:02:24.540> will

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
maybe a minute to two minutes you will

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.080 
maybe a minute to two minutes you will
eventually<00:02:25.410> come<00:02:25.590> to<00:02:25.740> a<00:02:25.770> Plains<00:02:26.190> biome<00:02:26.670> now

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
eventually come to a Plains biome now

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.610 
eventually come to a Plains biome now
I'm<00:02:27.209> not<00:02:27.360> gonna<00:02:27.480> go<00:02:27.660> ahead<00:02:27.720> and<00:02:27.930> spoil<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.500> for

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
I'm not gonna go ahead and spoil it for

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:29.750 
I'm not gonna go ahead and spoil it for
you<00:02:28.770> guys<00:02:28.800> I'm<00:02:29.100> just<00:02:29.160> gonna<00:02:29.310> go<00:02:29.520> ahead<00:02:29.580> and

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
quickly fly over there and hopefully

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.650 
quickly fly over there and hopefully
this<00:02:31.770> shouldn't<00:02:32.370> take<00:02:32.430> too<00:02:32.580> long<00:02:32.790> again<00:02:33.480> if

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
this shouldn't take too long again if

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.210 
this shouldn't take too long again if
you're<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.870> survival<00:02:34.290> mode<00:02:34.319> you<00:02:34.890> could<00:02:35.040> just

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
you're in survival mode you could just

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.220 
you're in survival mode you could just
make<00:02:35.340> a<00:02:35.370> boat<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.300> actually<00:02:36.630> travel<00:02:36.930> on<00:02:37.050> this

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
make a boat and actually travel on this

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.690 
make a boat and actually travel on this
River<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:37.709> will<00:02:37.860> actually<00:02:38.010> take<00:02:38.310> you<00:02:38.370> there

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
River it will actually take you there

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.520 
River it will actually take you there
and<00:02:38.970> there's<00:02:39.480> I<00:02:39.630> mean<00:02:39.690> there's<00:02:39.900> a<00:02:40.080> slight

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
and there's I mean there's a slight

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:42.559 
and there's I mean there's a slight
diversion<00:02:40.800> yeah<00:02:41.459> I<00:02:41.700> guess<00:02:41.910> you<00:02:42.060> have<00:02:42.360> to<00:02:42.390> get

00:02:42.559 --> 00:02:42.569 
diversion yeah I guess you have to get

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:44.630 
diversion yeah I guess you have to get
out<00:02:42.660> anyway<00:02:43.050> you<00:02:43.650> just<00:02:43.680> keep<00:02:43.980> flying<00:02:44.310> I

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
out anyway you just keep flying I

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.120 
out anyway you just keep flying I
believe<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.060> West<00:02:45.330> but<00:02:45.600> I'm<00:02:45.690> going<00:02:46.050> on<00:02:46.260> you

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
should eventually get here guys um and

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:50.390 
should eventually get here guys um and
like<00:02:49.170> I<00:02:49.230> said<00:02:49.410> it<00:02:49.560> really<00:02:49.709> isn't<00:02:50.100> that

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
like I said it really isn't that

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.250 
like I said it really isn't that
difficult<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:51.180> not<00:02:51.239> too<00:02:51.690> far<00:02:51.989> away<00:02:52.140> from

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
difficult and it's not too far away from

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:54.920 
difficult and it's not too far away from
spawn<00:02:52.709> you<00:02:52.860> know<00:02:52.950> it<00:02:53.070> is<00:02:53.190> definitely<00:02:54.180> easy<00:02:54.480> to

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:54.930 
spawn you know it is definitely easy to

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.430 
spawn you know it is definitely easy to
do<00:02:55.080> so<00:02:55.560> yeah<00:02:55.850> as<00:02:56.850> you<00:02:56.940> can<00:02:57.000> see<00:02:57.230> eventually<00:02:58.230> you

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
do so yeah as you can see eventually you

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:01.610 
do so yeah as you can see eventually you
can't<00:02:58.650> do<00:02:58.769> a<00:02:58.920> Plains<00:02:59.220> biome<00:02:59.610> with<00:03:00.150> an<00:03:00.620> 10-piece

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620
