00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:23.520
 I am aimar navarro I am from the valley of Aran 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.460
 I dedicate myself to the world of freeride and 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:28.800
 we are here in andorra in the test of 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.660
 the golden freeride belonging to 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.660
 ferrari world qualifier circuit 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.250
 sometimes people the image that the 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.950
 free rider is the crazy one that will serve 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:45.480
 here and there who do not think and I 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.480
 I think it's totally the opposite 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.239
 what I usually do is visualize the 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.710
 line of the day before and you can after 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.320
 if you have already studied your line is 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.670
 take photos and then at night or 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.350
 late when you arrive at the hotel you are already 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.619
 more relaxed to visualize those images 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:12.440
 calmly in the room and give 

00:01:09.619 --> 00:01:16.210
 turns to the head to know where 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.210
 you're going to happen and what we're going to do 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:31.510
 we did not get here to the griffin for the 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:34.250
 tomorrow we meet with colleagues 

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:36.440
 the talk of the conditions that 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:39.350
 there will be that day 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:41.270
 the time that we are going to have sometimes if 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.650
 sectors have been modified or has 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:45.920
 there was some last minute change 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:49.960
 then we went up to the chair before the 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.960
 Last visualization of the face 

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:12.880
 in moments before the exit is 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.880
 important to be very active without 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.530
 hot many times what happens is that 

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.270
 with the heat you fall a bit like that in 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.070
 middle of the nest it's okay to take some 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.630
 energetic drink or you make an agreement 

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:24.630
 of the face to activate you a little 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.739
 and a little nervous when you're in the 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:46.739
 3 21 Aug 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:59.330
 my philosophy in our competitions 

00:02:55.820 --> 00:03:03.850
 It is a very fast and very smooth descent 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.850
 do three or four large jumps equal 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.370
 best 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.800
 go looking a little in front and go 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.800
 thinking what looks good on top 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:22.540
 life 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:36.080
 at the moment when the 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:38.310
 line the moment of relaxation of the body 

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.790
 hit a slump after all the 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.020
 nerves tension concentration of all the 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.120
 day 

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:47.120
 that you stay to taste
