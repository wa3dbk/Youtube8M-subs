00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
in a light from 4j Studios it's not like

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.600 
in a light from 4j Studios it's not like
a<00:00:33.680> fact<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.920> it<00:00:35.040> could<00:00:35.160> have<00:00:35.250> come<00:00:35.340> out<00:00:35.489> on

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a fact that it could have come out on

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.030 
a fact that it could have come out on
these<00:00:35.730> moms<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.300> days<00:00:36.480> weather<00:00:36.780> and<00:00:37.140> but

these moms and days weather and but

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.459 
these moms and days weather and but
there<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.700> like<00:00:38.879> estimations<00:00:39.540> guesses<00:00:40.200> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
there it's like estimations guesses but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.590 
there it's like estimations guesses but
they're<00:00:40.680> most<00:00:41.160> likely<00:00:41.250> probably<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.510> be

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
they're most likely probably going to be

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.799 
they're most likely probably going to be
accurate<00:00:42.750> from<00:00:43.620> my<00:00:43.829> likings<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:45.090> I<00:00:45.329> don't

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
accurate from my likings but I don't

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.950

maybe<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> middle<00:01:47.820> I<00:01:48.030> would<00:01:48.299> say<00:01:48.479> the<00:01:48.630> middle

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.300 
maybe the middle I would say the middle
maybe<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.460> it<00:01:51.180> could<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:52.229> could<00:01:52.290> be<00:01:52.770> late

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
maybe but it could it could be late

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:55.730 
maybe but it could it could be late
October<00:01:54.030> just<00:01:54.270> because<00:01:54.630> of<00:01:54.930> all<00:01:55.259> like<00:01:55.500> the

00:01:55.730 --> 00:01:55.740 
October just because of all like the

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:58.580 
October just because of all like the
testing<00:01:56.329> xbox<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.509> light<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:57.960> you<00:01:58.020> have<00:01:58.229> to<00:01:58.350> do

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
testing xbox and light so you have to do

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.469 
testing xbox and light so you have to do
before<00:01:59.340> it<00:01:59.430> actually<00:01:59.520> gets<00:01:59.729> published<00:02:00.090> and

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
before it actually gets published and

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.630 
before it actually gets published and
sent<00:02:00.719> out<00:02:00.810> to<00:02:00.990> all<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.200> consoles<00:02:01.920> because<00:02:02.579> it

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
sent out to all the consoles because it

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
sent out to all the consoles because it
takes<00:02:02.790> like<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.149> week<00:02:03.180> on<00:02:03.630> a<00:02:03.780> bit<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.439> do<00:02:04.590> that

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 
takes like a week on a bit to do that

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.310 
takes like a week on a bit to do that
for<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.520> actual<00:02:05.820> companies<00:02:06.149> when<00:02:06.299> my<00:02:07.049> craft

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
for the actual companies when my craft

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.800 
for the actual companies when my craft
send<00:02:07.740> them<00:02:07.860> out<00:02:07.979> to<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:09.090> actual<00:02:09.179> and

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
send them out to the actual and

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.260 
send them out to the actual and
Microsoft<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.590> Sony<00:02:10.739> in<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> so<00:02:11.730> probably

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
Microsoft and Sony in that so probably

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.520 
Microsoft and Sony in that so probably
late<00:02:12.569> October<00:02:13.110> mid

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
late October mid

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
for it cooks and ps3 like try an

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.910 
for it cooks and ps3 like try an
estimate<00:03:31.260> around<00:03:32.870> October<00:03:33.870> of<00:03:34.079> course<00:03:34.560> cuz

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
estimate around October of course cuz

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.860 
estimate around October of course cuz
that's<00:03:35.100> probably<00:03:35.610> the<00:03:35.790> most<00:03:35.910> likely<00:03:36.329> when

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
that's probably the most likely when

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:39.020 
that's probably the most likely when
it's<00:03:37.049> going<00:03:37.170> to<00:03:37.230> come<00:03:37.320> out<00:03:37.380> so<00:03:37.680> I'm<00:03:38.310> do<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:38.880> I

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
it's going to come out so I'm do it I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.440

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
guess I would have a guess as I said

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.270 
guess I would have a guess as I said
probably<00:03:42.690> mid<00:03:43.049> October<00:03:43.680> so<00:03:43.920> I'm<00:03:44.010> gonna<00:03:44.100> go
