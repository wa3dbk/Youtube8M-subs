00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
natural looking as well they're fairly

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:22.959

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:22.969 
comfortable for 1425 diameters but I

00:05:22.969 --> 00:05:24.550 
comfortable for 1425 diameters but I
find<00:05:23.360> that<00:05:23.449> I<00:05:23.569> can't<00:05:23.870> leave<00:05:24.050> them<00:05:24.139> in<00:05:24.289> for<00:05:24.439> too
