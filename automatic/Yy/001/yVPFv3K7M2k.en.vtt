00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:52.969 
I'm sorry I'm friends but you know what
you're<00:01:51.450> coming<00:01:51.750> crap<00:01:51.930> and<00:01:52.170> we're<00:01:52.350> just<00:01:52.619> really

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
you're coming crap and we're just really

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.980 
you're coming crap and we're just really
bad<00:01:53.189> at<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.430> moment<00:01:53.460> but<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.720> thing<00:01:54.869> that's

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
bad at the moment but the thing that's

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.749 
bad at the moment but the thing that's
more<00:01:55.229> aware<00:01:55.500> that<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> wound<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.159> it's<00:01:56.549> not<00:01:56.700> a

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
more aware that the wound is it's not a

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:58.760 
more aware that the wound is it's not a
lot<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> they<00:01:57.180> want<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.810> worse<00:01:58.020> idea

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
lot that they want a worse idea

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.100 
lot that they want a worse idea
themes<00:01:59.770> could<00:02:00.070> go<00:02:00.219> down<00:02:00.719> it's<00:02:01.719> like<00:02:01.869> dude

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
themes could go down it's like dude

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:04.020 
themes could go down it's like dude
County<00:02:02.439> much<00:02:02.590> those<00:02:03.100> are<00:02:03.250> 11<00:02:03.549> teams<00:02:03.729> there

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.030 
County much those are 11 teams there

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.999 
County much those are 11 teams there
they're<00:02:04.240> all<00:02:04.360> separated<00:02:04.840> by<00:02:05.020> like<00:02:05.200> six<00:02:05.619> points

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:06.009 
they're all separated by like six points

00:02:06.009 --> 00:02:07.469 
they're all separated by like six points
so<00:02:06.399> any<00:02:06.549> three<00:02:06.759> of<00:02:06.789> those<00:02:06.939> teams<00:02:07.000> could<00:02:07.270> go

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:07.479 
so any three of those teams could go

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:09.719 
so any three of those teams could go
down<00:02:07.659> so<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.229> reckon<00:02:08.860> that<00:02:09.009> it's<00:02:09.160> possibly<00:02:09.550> one

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
down so I reckon that it's possibly one

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.100 
down so I reckon that it's possibly one
of<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.819> big<00:02:09.970> teams<00:02:10.149> this<00:02:10.360> year<00:02:10.569> it's<00:02:10.929> out<00:02:11.050> of

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
of the big teams this year it's out of

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:12.720 
of the big teams this year it's out of
them<00:02:11.260> disperse<00:02:11.650> it's<00:02:11.980> going<00:02:12.099> to<00:02:12.160> be<00:02:12.220> Newcastle

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
them disperse it's going to be Newcastle

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.040 
them disperse it's going to be Newcastle
or<00:02:13.000> it's<00:02:13.150> gonna<00:02:13.269> be<00:02:13.420> black<00:02:13.599> from<00:02:13.780> the<00:02:13.810> closed

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.050 
or it's gonna be black from the closed

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.900 
or it's gonna be black from the closed
down<00:02:14.200> I<00:02:14.470> can<00:02:14.920> possibly<00:02:15.280> as<00:02:15.400> far<00:02:15.580> as<00:02:15.670> good<00:02:15.790> but

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
down I can possibly as far as good but

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.460 
down I can possibly as far as good but
I'd<00:02:16.030> love<00:02:16.120> to<00:02:16.269> see<00:02:16.420> Blackburn<00:02:16.900> going<00:02:17.140> on<00:02:17.260> is

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
I'd love to see Blackburn going on is

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.110 
I'd love to see Blackburn going on is
