so<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> wanted<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.630> make<00:01:12.780> sure<00:01:12.810> I<00:01:12.960> would<00:01:13.110> be<00:01:13.290> able

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so I wanted to make sure I would be able

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.170 
so I wanted to make sure I would be able
to<00:01:13.680> secure<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.230 

so<00:01:20.180> when<00:01:20.270> you<00:01:20.360> first<00:01:20.600> open<00:01:20.930> it<00:01:21.020> up<00:01:21.610> has<00:01:22.610> kifaru

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
so when you first open it up has kifaru

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.090 
so when you first open it up has kifaru
I<00:01:23.390> have<00:01:23.750> no<00:01:23.900> idea<00:01:24.140> what<00:01:24.290> these<00:01:24.410> are<00:01:24.590> called<00:01:24.620> but

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840 
the same system anyway they're not in

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.840 
the same system anyway they're not in
there<00:01:38.960> right<00:01:39.110> now<00:01:39.260> so<00:01:39.500> just<00:01:39.740> starting<00:01:40.580> here
