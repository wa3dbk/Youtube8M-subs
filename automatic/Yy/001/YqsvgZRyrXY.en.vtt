00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.799
 here we have a little acid 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.960
 very concentrated nitrate of 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.260
 it has nothing in it enough diluted either 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.809
 say that the diluted action this coloring 

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.690
 brown is because it is already full of 

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:17.609
 nitrate of iron 3 then already the same but 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.510
 basically very nitric acid 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:25.130
 diluted place a small amount of 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.130
 right iron for steel 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 They can see that this is going on worldwide 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:49.839
 our best place nitrogen is 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.829
 synthesized within our own 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:52.239
 body 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.309
 it causes some interesting things 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.260
 like a penis erection 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:01:03.519
 excessive cigarette stimulation 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:11.649
 customer interaction or turn on the light 

00:01:03.519 --> 00:01:16.350
 becoming clearer who says he has 

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:16.350
 for steel was part of the 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.729
 people going to produce and treat you 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 producing nitrate what iron you 3 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.979
 this time reacting well 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:38.200
 You see , they do not spend there and also in this 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.789
 case is nitrogen dioxide and since 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:44.280
 remain very fast 

00:01:39.789 --> 00:01:44.280
 the monocle rapidly oxidizes optimally 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.210
 and here I am preparing a bath Maria 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.210
 to accelerate this reaction 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.050
 terrible crap 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:35.760
 and now the index still has for steel 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.540
 that has no oxidation is taboo 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.930
 House 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:42.049
 it's cold here so let's go 17 degrees 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.049
 Celsius
