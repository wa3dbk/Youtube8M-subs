 and today in background gameplay a 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.150
 fucking nuclear on black ops 2 in 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.240
 league 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.309
 ctf standoff realized by dry rage a 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.480
 fucking monstrous gameplay but I 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.860
 do not go on for a longer time 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.449
 if you just want to see 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.980
 other massacres like this one you 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:39.090
 just check the description is 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.070
 went to see the channel 2 sec 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.629
 it has tons nasa like that and I 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.399
 let you have fun 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.840
 well short friends as I wanted said 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:47.550
 it's my first gameplay commented 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.539
 on the chain is necessarily you 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.489
 start to get used to 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:52.140
 as soon as a new commentator integrates 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.329
 the team must present themselves 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.980
 during a commentary course a small 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.780
 gameplay like this one and that's what 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.199
 I will do all of this 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.879
 video 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.649
 so first of all i'll start with 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:02.910
 who I am on youtube since how much 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.649
 of time i'm on youtube why 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.930
 I wanted to join the rage team and I 

00:01:04.649 --> 00:01:09.000
 will finish very briefly on who I 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.580
 I'm here to give you the 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.780
 information we will say the most 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.330
 interesting at least those who 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.890
 might want to interest you the most 

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.880
 so first of all who I am on 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.009
 youtube I do not think that much 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.140
 of you know the pseudo woum 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.009
 finally at least know me 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 maybe some of you 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.420
 have already seen me for the day's team 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.830
 qg code where the top 5 of the ncaa 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.360
 I will introduce you a little bit 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:32.789
 chain and when did I start 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.130
 youtube and why so I started 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.840
 youtube in september 2011 so yes that 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.239
 do a hell of a lot of time I 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.770
 started simply because bayer 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:42.869
 the one college buddies I who were doing 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:45.479
 already that and I thought why not 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:46.800
 me so I tried and I started a 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.660
 little bit like everyone with 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.060
 commented gameplay on call of duty on 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.020
 on other games later but 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.090
 I did not do anything 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.979
 really exceptional it was just 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.750
 little commentary like that enough 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.160
 basic with a commentary really not 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.479
 good we must tell the truth today 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.259
 when I watch my old videos 

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:06.720
 it's catastrophic and then I continue 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.580
 like that and after a year I tried 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.590
 recruitment for the clip of the day of 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.450
 subject code and luckily I was 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.530
 selected it is also for that 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.700
 that today I continued 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.400
 comment because it's true that I have 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.850
 I always had this love between 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.170
 quotation marks from common tahri mai 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:23.060
 I find myself I found myself more too 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.480
 on my channel have to tell the truth to 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:28.910
 more than two years ago from youtube's 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.250
 three years you begin a little has 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.150
 saturated with just commentary 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.980
 all the time all the time all the 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.420
 time and I thought why not 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.490
 open a new channel or pop game 

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:39.170
 I will propose a concept that will 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.580
 corresponde is a little bit more and 

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.870
 that's what I did today so 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.580
 it's been about five months since I 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.220
 hold this chain and it's a chain 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.050
 own you your best of here is a chain 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.790
 which I do not think will interest you 

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.770
 so I absolutely do not invite you to 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.000
 see it was just to make you to 

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:57.500
 give you a little anecdote 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.730
 and it's true that from there came 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.410
 envied to join the rage team 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.360
 why because it's true 

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.220
 I had saturated for a while 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.520
 to make that commentary commentary 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:09.530
 common tahri but it's been five months since 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.640
 I do not propose any more and I 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.590
 begins to have a little lack 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:14.630
 the problem is that my channel is not there 

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:18.170
 lend more at the moment and I am 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.360
 am saying because I saw that the nar 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.780
 wage recruit I told myself why 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:23.840
 not me 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.790
 and why not reconnect with gasoline 

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.710
 even from my first videos it's up to 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.270
 say the classic commentary with a 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.770
 gameplay do not do that I'm not going 

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:32.090
 lie to you today certainly I 

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.910
 command of the day clips was top 5 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:38.180
 but it's not the same exercise at all 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.680
 in my eyes a quinquin commentary 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.850
 a classic cast gameplay 

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.920
 the simple and good reason that when you 

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.630
 comment on a clip of the day when a top 5 

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:46.850
 it's on a much shorter time 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:47.810
 and cuts you most of the 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.150
 time finally at least that's what I 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.240
 do I make cuts so I have 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:54.590
 I do not have this job that you can 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.370
 do on a commentary that last 

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:57.110
 much longer 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:58.160
 good there it is true that today I have 

00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.660
 not taken good examples since the 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:01.370
 gameplay actually does about six 

00:03:59.660 --> 00:04:03.560
 minutes because I cut them and but 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.240
 that's true I missed it 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.400
 to be able to practice what 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:10.520
 like that on a gameplay really 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.680
 euros and rabies allowed me to be able to 

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:15.260
 start to comment on gameplay 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:18.080
 as long and it makes me super happy 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:20.060
 in short that's why I entered 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.310
 the rage team or douala then I'm on 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.200
 youtube and now i will tell you 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:25.340
 a little bit who i am in iran 

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:28.700
 at least information that could 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:31.760
 so maybe you're interested already in the 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:33.140
 base my name is julien I'm 19 years old and 

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.540
 I am currently in the second year 

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:37.250
 of license in bc st so I know that 

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.560
 many of you do not know what 

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:41.750
 what is the cstb bay simply cftc 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.090
 biology chemistry and earth sciences 

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:46.220
 basically it's the svt 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.540
 but after the bac and have a lot more 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.730
 relou must tell the truth 

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:51.440
 these broken balls if you're a fan of 

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.210
 biology maybe you can have fun 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:55.370
 I was a fan before but I confess that I 

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.600
 saturated good I do not sin epiloguer on 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:57.650
 but here I warn you everything from 

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.140
 next if you want to study 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.520
 in biology hang in there 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:01.790
 because it's not at all like 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:04.100
 high school 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.240
 that's what it says afterwards 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.910
 about my extracurricular activities 

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:12.020
 I played volleyball for eight years 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:12.950
 since I'm in sixth it's been 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.030
 maybe not eight because I have 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:15.950
 stopped counting for a while but 

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:17.690
 short ride my bike since follows 

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:19.730
 sixth I'm going to stop just this 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:22.240
 year for a lot of reasons that I have 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:25.160
 not want to explain during this video 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:27.080
 next to that beats for those who want 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:29.720
 know which platform I am on 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:31.820
 am on xbox 360 and playstation 3 i 

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:33.170
 do not have the new generations of 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:34.820
 consoles simply because it does not 

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:36.080
 I'm not interested at all and that the 

00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:38.140
 most of my friends are on the 

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.220
 old consoles 

00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.540
 I also have the wiiu but I do not play 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.730
 not on it even though I have call of duty 

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:45.710
 calls on it I admit that I 'm not going 

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:46.870
 too much bleeding the game there because that 

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:49.040
 I do not like it too much 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:50.660
 and then that's pretty much all that 

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:51.410
 I have to tell you about me because it's 

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:54.560
 true that I do not want too much 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:55.520
 to epilogate in this video for fear of 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:57.110
 go beyond the gameplay 

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:59.150
 so if you just do not have 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:00.200
 a lot of questions I know it will not be 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.090
 actually the case but if you have any 

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.650
 questions about me do not hesitate to them 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:04.370
 ask in comment I will strive to 

00:06:03.650 --> 00:06:05.870
 read comments 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.330
 three four days after publication 

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.740
 of this video story of homework 

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:12.440
 close all comments and all 

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.360
 questions that may have been all of me 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:16.850
 the questions you may have asked me 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:18.410
 here I have a little bit buggy about this 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:19.670
 friends by then it is reaching the end of 

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:22.460
 gameplay I sincerely hope that 

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:24.230
 this one pleased you I wish you to 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.700
 all to take care of you and to very 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:27.260
 fast for a new commented gameplay 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:30.130
 on the chain of the rage team these lands 

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:30.130
 or ciao
