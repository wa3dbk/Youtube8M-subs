00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
 hello alex pieri spaghetti gaming tube by 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.330
 return with a slightly different video 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.469
 this time I'll talk 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.700
 I will give you five quick tips on how 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:16.160
 to climb of divisions into red by 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.600
 curry according to my personal 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:21.660
 experience I started at the beginning 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:26.070
 season 3 from bronze 1 and I arrived at 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:29.730
 gold 5 playing really little done 200 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:33.239
 games in total and not playing more than 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.829
 one or two games a day 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.800
 then the first advice about 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.670
 what I give you is to play to the maximum 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.399
 of concentration 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.469
 makes them a very game environment 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:47.160
 competitive and for this reason they can 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.379
 easily become frustrating of 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:51.770
 I recommend what I did and of 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.699
 play at maximum concentration 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:59.850
 so just play being right 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:02.820
 state of mind having that tension that 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.150
 just some tension to keep you more 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.040
 concentrate of normal and try to 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.530
 give all your everything all self 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.570
 same in short in the game 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:15.090
 this means that from curly you have to 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:18.119
 have a farm more than perfect if not 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:20.939
 nothing happens online does not have 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.280
 excuses and you have to pay 200 euros 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.080
 millions to 20 minutes if they are not 203 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.070
 vanessa 180 and I 'm already wide 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:36.520
 otherwise equivalent or 140 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:39.820
 millions 6 kill 174 kg to say these 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:43.890
 things here is easy to be curry of 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.630
 match with the marx man glue of carrie 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.730
 when you have a good farm this 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.250
 means that there is the initial twenty minutes 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.500
 they are fundamental but fundamental 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.470
 also all the minutes following the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.240
 second advice I give you is not 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:00.160
 wasting time ever you always go to 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.570
 look for something to do sea controlled 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.000
 as long as he lives them together forever 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:06.040
 in both top and mid push that bots 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.360
 yours mainly but also that 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:08.020
 of others if you see that others do not 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:10.300
 they go there 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.100
 the jungle also I realized that yellow 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:16.930
 there must go but you too 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.790
 in short, neither do you benefit then just there 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:21.459
 it happens you're turning maybe you see 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.200
 that my opponent's opponents are 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.730
 go mid to try to force the 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.440
 tower you pass by if you see that 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.720
 nothing happens you walk around 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:31.500
 wolves or ghosts you make me is then back 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.500
 again myth to show you 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:39.620
 third advice I give you is that more in 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:41.270
 is lower and lower both 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:47.200
 divisions is easier than the morale of the 

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:50.270
 team be destroyed by few things from 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.100
 nonsense in short because people with 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.010
 people tend to become demoralized 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.380
 comes into play with the idea of ​​not so much 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.670
 to have a good game but to have 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:01.250
 a game ruined by one's companions 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.709
 so he's looking forward to 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:07.510
 have a teammate who is wrong 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:11.330
 who dies etc. to be able to do it 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:14.900
 remark and begin to ruin everything 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.489
 the environment all the gaming environment 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:19.730
 this means that it is more for you 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:21.410
 easy to maintain high morale because 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.790
 if you know how to play you can form 

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.260
 you know how to keep yourself under pressure 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.540
 the opponent and kill him and whatever 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.130
 you are already happy with your sa board e 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.600
 so there are already two people out of five 

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:32.860
 plus the gender that is added 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.510
 when it is hooked you make kill 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:40.310
 take assists take tower take 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:42.950
 dragon what you like so I'm already 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:44.720
 three people out of five high morale is 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.220
 the obviously says good 

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.049
 coordination because people will start 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.250
 to follow you when you begin to 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:51.260
 ask to go to one side 

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.820
 rather than the other and is already 3 out of 5 

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.200
 maybe they will also be added later 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:56.200
 two others very easily 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:04.290
 in any case, however, the initial twenty minutes 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:06.960
 They are essential if he wanted to try in 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.760
 files with more data than others 

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:10.710
 you have to use ok this is the fourth 

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:13.650
 advice you must use your companions 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.720
 as a human shield 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.160
 you are the ones you do and those you 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.950
 do the damage you have your objects 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.150
 from your face and therefore you must 

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:22.500
 stay behind 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
 you don't have to go and save yours 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.920
 comrades if they do fish or 

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:27.660
 whatever else you need to stay behind and 

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.010
 try to do damage if possible on 

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:30.390
 what has succeeded not that you owe 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.450
 ignore the tango to go on their di 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:34.290
 ps if there is a tank nearby 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.890
 move away from the tank to the enemy 

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:39.570
 continue to attach it however in this 

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.560
 in short, if you have more damage than yours 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.390
 right times of the other caravans 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:46.680
 however English is better too 

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.260
 while the opponent will not have enough 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:51.480
 objects to be able to contrast yours 

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.370
 damage and therefore will be forced to die or 

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:57.930
 however withdraw if the tanque disappears 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.610
 of ps opponents are will be discovered e 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:02.430
 therefore the team files will be won because 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:04.980
 they will have no protection and will die in 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.960
 last but not least the 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:10.550
 important important communication that 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:13.950
 you always keep your spirits up 

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:17.580
 maybe when mistakes are made 

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:20.100
 you are not too we say petulant not 

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:22.620
 don't keep telling yourself why you did it 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:24.390
 this perfect and smog limited areas 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:26.310
 do we avoid going there are not 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.790
 world and let 's go and do something 

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:29.010
 guard 

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:30.270
 let's avoid these things, however, every 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.460
 whenever something positive happens 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.170
 for ours for your team that was 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.080
 a clinic a tower that a dragon with 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.550
 good job barons always write gj 

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:43.360
 two letters are very easy 

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.310
 they are important for maintaining morale 

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:48.280
 high 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:50.770
 in addition, communication also means in 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.210
 races so when you don't want that 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:54.870
 your sports engagement line because 

00:05:52.210 --> 00:06:00.790
 you are back because you don't feel it 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:06:02.410
 ping ping alert in blink yellow not 

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.860
 to go 

00:06:02.410 --> 00:06:08.530
 when you see an opponent on the map 

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:11.170
 that maybe tightening the tiring the 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:14.500
 mid you already start pushing that 

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:18.430
 maybe even you saw it before him 

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:20.440
 so he already knows that there is something there or the 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:22.590
 your yellow and pink or anyone else 

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:22.590
 I know 

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:26.560
 so look at the map and do a 

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:32.230
 little work of your support than in the 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:34.780
 times you know more or less than 2 minutes

 blue is made red at 7 minutes 

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:40.320
 blue and red or dragon appear 

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:44.860
 every six minutes the cheating sets 

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.260
 keep your mind and buy world if 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:49.720
 there are no help for the taste because

 businesses are now one can take to 

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:54.880
 maximum between world and an invisible world 

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:57.930
 is a world to discover the 

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.910

 to help with viewing the map 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:17.190
 that the ears are very important 

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:17.190
 spaghetti gaming to the next
