so<00:00:13.690> what<00:00:13.930> I'll<00:00:14.019> do<00:00:14.170> is<00:00:14.200> I'll<00:00:14.380> walk<00:00:14.620> look<00:00:15.580> we'll

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:15.730 
so what I'll do is I'll walk look we'll

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:17.370 
so what I'll do is I'll walk look we'll
look<00:00:15.820> at<00:00:15.970> the<00:00:16.059> map<00:00:16.269> will<00:00:16.570> go<00:00:16.720> through<00:00:17.080> the

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:17.380 
look at the map will go through the

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.980 
look at the map will go through the
course<00:00:17.650> on<00:00:17.920> the<00:00:18.189> map<00:00:18.400> with<00:00:19.150> my<00:00:19.330> students<00:00:19.749> and

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:19.990 
course on the map with my students and

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.450 
course on the map with my students and
then<00:00:20.859> we'll<00:00:21.669> go<00:00:21.849> out<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.240> course<00:00:22.480> walk<00:00:22.779> and

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
then we'll go out to the course walk and

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.679 
then we'll go out to the course walk and
see<00:00:24.460> what<00:00:24.579> it<00:00:24.669> actually<00:00:24.820> looks<00:00:25.060> like<00:00:25.329> in<00:00:25.539> real

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:25.689 
see what it actually looks like in real

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:28.620 
see what it actually looks like in real
life<00:00:26.069> this<00:00:27.069> is<00:00:27.130> a<00:00:27.249> metre<00:00:27.489> twenty<00:00:27.699> competition

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 
life this is a metre twenty competition

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.360 
life this is a metre twenty competition
and<00:00:28.929> we<00:00:29.679> look<00:00:29.859> at<00:00:29.980> the<00:00:30.069> map<00:00:30.279> first<00:00:31.050> to<00:00:32.250> see<00:00:33.250> if

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:33.370 
and we look at the map first to see if

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:35.460 
and we look at the map first to see if
there's<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:33.670> jump<00:00:33.940> off<00:00:34.230> what<00:00:35.230> kind<00:00:35.410> of

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:35.470 
there's a jump off what kind of

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.189 
there's a jump off what kind of
competition<00:00:35.829> it<00:00:36.219> is<00:00:36.250> where<00:00:37.210> the<00:00:37.480> obstacles

00:00:38.189 --> 00:00:38.199 
competition it is where the obstacles

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:41.189 
competition it is where the obstacles
are<00:00:38.469> located<00:00:39.100> on<00:00:39.219> the<00:00:39.340> field<00:00:39.960> this<00:00:40.960> particular

00:00:41.189 --> 00:00:41.199 
are located on the field this particular

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:45.900 
are located on the field this particular
competition<00:00:42.100> today<00:00:42.460> is<00:00:42.940> a<00:00:43.840> one<00:00:44.170> rounder<00:00:44.910> it

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
competition today is a one rounder it

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.819 
competition today is a one rounder it
does<00:00:46.149> not<00:00:46.329> have<00:00:46.629> a<00:00:46.660> jump<00:00:46.989> off<00:00:47.170> so<00:00:47.350> there's<00:00:47.530> one

00:00:47.819 --> 00:00:47.829 
does not have a jump off so there's one

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:50.910 
does not have a jump off so there's one
course<00:00:48.609> plan<00:00:48.910> to<00:00:49.059> walk<00:00:49.269> because<00:00:50.050> the<00:00:50.230> idea<00:00:50.469> of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
course plan to walk because the idea of

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.459 
course plan to walk because the idea of
this<00:00:51.160> competition<00:00:51.969> is<00:00:52.120> to<00:00:52.660> be<00:00:52.780> the<00:00:52.929> fastest

00:00:53.459 --> 00:00:53.469 
this competition is to be the fastest

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:55.410 
this competition is to be the fastest
with<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.679> fewest<00:00:54.010> amount<00:00:54.250> of<00:00:54.519> false<00:00:54.760> it'll<00:00:55.329> be

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:55.420 
with the fewest amount of false it'll be

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.239 
with the fewest amount of false it'll be
a<00:00:55.449> related<00:00:55.960> distance<00:00:56.379> so<00:00:56.589> we'll<00:00:56.739> walk<00:00:56.949> how

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:57.249 
a related distance so we'll walk how

00:00:57.249 --> 00:00:58.979 
a related distance so we'll walk how
many<00:00:57.429> strides<00:00:57.820> we're<00:00:58.149> going<00:00:58.269> to<00:00:58.329> do<00:00:58.480> from<00:00:58.809> one

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
many strides we're going to do from one

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.040 
many strides we're going to do from one
to<00:00:59.199> two<00:00:59.379> so<00:01:00.160> when<00:01:01.089> we're<00:01:01.179> walking<00:01:01.300> related

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:02.050 
to two so when we're walking related

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:05.399 
to two so when we're walking related
distance<00:01:02.559> we<00:01:03.460> take<00:01:03.730> into<00:01:03.909> account<00:01:04.360> where<00:01:05.260> the

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:05.409 
distance we take into account where the

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:07.080 
distance we take into account where the
horse<00:01:05.620> will<00:01:05.800> be<00:01:05.890> landing<00:01:06.100> that's<00:01:06.880> usually

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:07.090 
horse will be landing that's usually

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:09.890 
horse will be landing that's usually
about<00:01:07.360> six<00:01:07.840> feet<00:01:08.140> so<00:01:08.800> to<00:01:08.860> be<00:01:09.040> about<00:01:09.250> here<00:01:09.670> and

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:09.900 
about six feet so to be about here and

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790 
about six feet so to be about here and
then<00:01:10.900> each<00:01:11.370> step<00:01:12.370> I<00:01:12.790> walk<00:01:13.690> is<00:01:13.990> three<00:01:14.260> feet<00:01:14.500> and

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:14.800 
then each step I walk is three feet and

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.180 
then each step I walk is three feet and
a<00:01:15.490> natural<00:01:15.900> size<00:01:16.900> of<00:01:17.080> a<00:01:17.140> horse's<00:01:17.380> stride<00:01:17.740> is<00:01:17.890> 12

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:18.190 
a natural size of a horse's stride is 12

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:20.370 
a natural size of a horse's stride is 12
feet<00:01:18.460> so<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:18.970> would<00:01:19.240> be<00:01:19.270> four<00:01:19.630> steps<00:01:19.960> three

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
feet so that would be four steps three

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
feet so that would be four steps three
times<00:01:20.590> four<00:01:20.890> so<00:01:21.520> one<00:01:21.910> two<00:01:22.660> three<00:01:23.500> four<00:01:24.130> that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:24.400 
times four so one two three four that

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.100 
times four so one two three four that
would<00:01:24.550> be<00:01:24.670> one<00:01:24.880> stride<00:01:25.300> away<00:01:25.570> from<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.870> jump

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
would be one stride away from the jump

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.100 
would be one stride away from the jump
the<00:01:26.980> riders<00:01:27.430> have<00:01:27.700> to<00:01:27.850> negotiate<00:01:28.150> the<00:01:28.600> size<00:01:28.870> of

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
the riders have to negotiate the size of

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.230 
the riders have to negotiate the size of
the<00:01:29.200> horses<00:01:29.470> stride<00:01:29.860> so<00:01:30.430> it<00:01:30.640> should<00:01:30.850> be<00:01:30.970> just<00:01:31.000> a

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
the horses stride so it should be just a

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.600 
the horses stride so it should be just a
