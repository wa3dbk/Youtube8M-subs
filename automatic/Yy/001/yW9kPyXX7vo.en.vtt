a<00:00:07.049> short<00:00:07.560> video<00:00:07.710> because<00:00:08.220> uh<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.700> guess<00:00:09.210> it's

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
a short video because uh I guess it's

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.370 
a short video because uh I guess it's
special<00:00:09.780> order<00:00:10.080> now<00:00:10.230> and<00:00:10.530> somehow<00:00:11.160> I<00:00:11.250> got<00:00:11.790> one

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:12.380 
special order now and somehow I got one

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.720 
special order now and somehow I got one
when<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> wasn't<00:00:13.740> supposed<00:00:13.860> to<00:00:14.160> because<00:00:14.700> I

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
when I wasn't supposed to because I

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.810 
when I wasn't supposed to because I
guess<00:00:15.179> I<00:00:15.299> ordered<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.520> probably<00:00:17.520> one<00:00:17.609> of<00:00:17.640> the

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
guess I ordered it probably one of the

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.450 
guess I ordered it probably one of the
first<00:00:17.970> days<00:00:18.090> that<00:00:18.359> they<00:00:18.510> listed<00:00:18.869> it<00:00:19.020> but

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:19.460 
first days that they listed it but

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:23.599 
first days that they listed it but
here's<00:00:20.460> the<00:00:20.520> box<00:00:21.170> it<00:00:22.170> is<00:00:22.320> an<00:00:22.529> oval<00:00:22.680> seven<00:00:23.100> elf<00:00:23.340> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
here's the box it is an oval seven elf I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:24.980 
here's the box it is an oval seven elf I
guess<00:00:23.789> there<00:00:24.180> were<00:00:24.269> some<00:00:24.420> questions<00:00:24.539> whether

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
guess there were some questions whether

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:28.370 
guess there were some questions whether
or<00:00:25.170> not<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.650> was<00:00:26.480> called<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.570> elf<00:00:27.840> but<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.260> is

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
or not it was called the elf but it is

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:36.910 
or not it was called the elf but it is
and<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.400> is<00:00:29.519> pretty<00:00:29.670> much<00:00:29.760> what<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.090> comes<00:00:30.269> in
