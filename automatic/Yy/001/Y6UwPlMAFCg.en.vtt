again<00:00:36.390> and<00:00:37.350> again<00:00:37.500> there's<00:00:37.680> only<00:00:37.770> one<00:00:37.920> more

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
again and again there's only one more

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.910 
again and again there's only one more
zone<00:00:38.250> so<00:00:39.170> it's<00:00:40.170> not<00:00:40.260> like<00:00:40.410> he<00:00:40.500> has<00:00:40.590> many<00:00:40.770> more
