when<00:01:13.100> they<00:01:13.220> think<00:01:13.250> of<00:01:13.490> preserving<00:01:14.030> Tomatoes

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
when they think of preserving Tomatoes

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.060 
when they think of preserving Tomatoes
they<00:01:14.630> think<00:01:14.810> of<00:01:14.900> canning<00:01:15.350> I'll<00:01:15.560> be<00:01:15.770> honest

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:16.070 
they think of canning I'll be honest

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:17.679 
they think of canning I'll be honest
I've<00:01:16.220> never<00:01:16.280> canned<00:01:16.850> anything<00:01:17.240> a<00:01:17.330> day<00:01:17.450> in<00:01:17.570> my

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:17.689 
I've never canned anything a day in my

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.359 
I've never canned anything a day in my
life<00:01:17.869> I<00:01:18.140> don't<00:01:18.259> even<00:01:18.500> know<00:01:18.770> how<00:01:19.040> to<00:01:19.070> can

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:19.369 
life I don't even know how to can

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:21.999 
life I don't even know how to can
something<00:01:19.820> so<00:01:20.060> what<00:01:20.780> I<00:01:20.810> do<00:01:20.960> is<00:01:21.320> basically<00:01:21.680> just

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:22.009 
something so what I do is basically just

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:23.950 
something so what I do is basically just
remove<00:01:22.460> the<00:01:22.640> stem<00:01:22.880> give<00:01:23.299> them<00:01:23.450> a<00:01:23.540> wash<00:01:23.720> and

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:23.960 
remove the stem give them a wash and

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.990 
remove the stem give them a wash and
throw<00:01:24.170> them<00:01:24.350> into<00:01:24.530> a<00:01:24.650> zipper<00:01:24.950> bag<00:01:25.220> into<00:01:25.970> the

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
throw them into a zipper bag into the

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.580 
throw them into a zipper bag into the
freezer<00:01:26.360> they<00:01:26.510> go<00:01:26.690> and<00:01:26.900> then<00:01:27.110> I<00:01:27.200> use<00:01:27.410> them

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:27.590 
freezer they go and then I use them

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.530 
freezer they go and then I use them
throughout<00:01:27.830> the<00:01:28.040> year<00:01:28.220> in<00:01:28.370> soups<00:01:28.790> sauces<00:01:29.150> and

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
throughout the year in soups sauces and

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.330 
throughout the year in soups sauces and
stews<00:01:29.900> they<00:01:30.230> will<00:01:30.470> lose<00:01:30.710> their<00:01:30.860> texture

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:31.340 
stews they will lose their texture

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.680 
stews they will lose their texture
through<00:01:31.520> it<00:01:31.610> so<00:01:31.760> you<00:01:31.820> can<00:01:32.060> never<00:01:32.150> eat<00:01:32.270> them<00:01:32.510> raw

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
through it so you can never eat them raw

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.870 
through it so you can never eat them raw
again<00:01:32.990> but<00:01:33.200> they<00:01:33.350> are<00:01:33.500> ideal<00:01:33.740> for<00:01:34.160> peeling

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
again but they are ideal for peeling

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.610 
again but they are ideal for peeling
because<00:01:35.300> the<00:01:35.390> peel<00:01:35.630> actually<00:01:35.960> comes<00:01:36.140> right

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:36.620 
because the peel actually comes right
