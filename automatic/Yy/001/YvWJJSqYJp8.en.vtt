 Hello I am the type from the 3d circle 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:13.230
 today we want our cows on the 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.139
 leave pasture 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.970
 the first time it is nice weather 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.789
 Temperatures are now almost 20 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.590
 degree and the well-being temperature of a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.720
 Cow prefers 10 degrees 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.640
 and we think and find that we 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.990
 formerly a christ tool that we are 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.929
 can walk on the scales 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.430
 the freshness taste to do 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.960
 You can also see the door like the door 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.960
 Cows are happy that they can get out 

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.280
 so now we are here on the parcours 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.450
 are still in the stall yes of course are 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.060

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.970
 you have a green area here though 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.440
 not a bit blatant but a good outlet 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.900
 can be represented by the feet 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.700
 comfortably lie there again and have 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.980
 also the possibility at any time again 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.320
 to go back to the stable 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.240
 they think they are now the 23 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.740
 stop for hours and then the 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.200
 Most for again in the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:04.170
 stall come because there is the lining there 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.550

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:08.540
