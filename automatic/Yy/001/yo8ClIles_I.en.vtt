00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:09.350
 today the recipe from 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:10.010
 tonight is spaghetti alle 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:13.730
 clams 

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:14.690
 but reds not white if the clams are 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.759
 good 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.550
 I usually prefer the recipe of the 

00:00:16.759 --> 00:00:22.220
 white spaghetti but it can happen that yes 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.439
 add a guest at the last moment e 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.240
 of course with the tomato they will make 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.010
 a little more 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.330
 let's start by preparing a nice mix of 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:31.580
 parsley and garlic 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:36.379
 today I feel like a traditionalist 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:38.680
 doing with the half moon how much done 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:41.900
 two minutes and the grinder from the grandmother 

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.220
 he prepared the chopped parsley e 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.409
 garlic 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.989
 at this point I had the clams 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.229
 already made to open as always after having them 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.500
 we bleed faces let's have a nice ride 

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:58.780
 of oil in a pan and begin a 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.780
 prepare the chopped parsley and garlic 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.490
 so much so that our oil with the 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.750
 parsley and garlic is settling 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.050
 I excuse the clams we create the water of 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:17.330
 clam cooking always leaving 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.100
 aside the last drop to avoid 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:24.620
 sand but you told me the pot is 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:29.380
 very clean this point and prepare 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:32.720
 fine our cooking fund when 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.230
 the fund of 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.470
 cylinders let's add a little bit of 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:41.390
 tomato sauce do not overdo it because 

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:43.370
 otherwise it will cover the taste of 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:46.220
 clams 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.800
 the recipe is really fast in this 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:51.440
 in case the pass will have to be very good 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.659
 and sweet so better if you did it 

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.080
 in home 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:02:00.620
 if you like, add a bit of 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:03.500
 chili pepper and check the salt of 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.530
 this sauce is very simple because 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.810
 clams could be very tasty 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.970
 and therefore not 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.150
 need no junta like almost 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:17.110
 always or a little less and so it's worth 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.940
 worth not remembering spaghetti 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:27.489
 we are cooked our bottles we join them to 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:30.190
 tomato sauce a nice mix and 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:33.030
 so let's add the pasta 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.599
 to make it jump 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:40.930
 spaghetti that as always we have cooked 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:43.900
 in abundant salt water 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:46.480
 if you had so much clam water 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.310
 too much for the sauce you can add one 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:49.690
 as I did 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:52.110
 also to the cooking water of the 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:57.160
 spaghetti in that case obviously 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:59.010
 watch out for a quick stirring of salt 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:03.549
 we skip spaghetti with clams 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.590
 red and we are ready to take it in 

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.910
 table decorated with clams that 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.910
 we got it aside
