00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:08.570
 fight announcement from corian the new hyundai 

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.280
 Coupe wants to be taken seriously and 

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.940
 that's what it stays for a while 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:15.290
 impressive 214 ps 79 seconds in 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.500
 our test from zero to one hundred and 

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.060
 that for just under 30,000 euros something 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.120
 disappointing but what is he from it 

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:25.700
 makes only 222 km h tip and one 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.580
 test consumption of just under ten meters 

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.680
 less pointed the landing gear is that tough 

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:32.390
 However, gold sportiness is suggestive 

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.370
 just a little annoying the 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.040
 Gear shift is hakelig and the engine 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.540
 is above all one loud that one likes on 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.710
 maybe still nice at the beginning 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:44.720
 but in the long run annoying just just to 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.940
 but something comes this hyundai 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.190
 makes it unique compared to the audi 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 he has rear-wheel drive and that makes it 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.640
 of course fun if you have the esp here 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:54.800
 Exhibits then that is possible 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.610
 and whoever values â€‹â€‹it has to 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.309
 to grab 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:00.559
 the hyundai is 9000 euros cheaper than 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.030
 the a5 can do some drifts 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.930
 lie down and even the more consumption 

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.689
 finance 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.069
 in the price is the genesis coupe 

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:08.890
 inviolable but that is unfortunately too 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:12.230
 that 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:12.740
 the audi a5 the sporty business 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.630
 suit 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.090
 it belongs to the type of car that one 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.680
 performance he hides he has four ps 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.180
 less than the hyundai and creates the 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.080
 still sprint almost a second 

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:24.080
 more quickly 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.750
 Add to that a top speed of 250 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.350
 only unfortunately he is just 9000 euro 

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.810
 expensive 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.430
 but you get the most modern technology 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.280
 with standard start-stop automatic 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.229
 consumes the 508 liters in our test 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:39.229
 to get best processing and 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.300
 you hear the finest materials that you 

00:01:39.229 --> 00:01:43.580
 not if you're in here then know 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.500
 for which you spent more money 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.810
 namely for the sound insulation for the 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:49.670
 rolling comfort for the steering for the 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.050
 switch precisely and for the quiet 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.450
 engine this is still one 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.619
 athletes but just less excited than 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.110
 the korean 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.000
 the audi is more expensive but for that too 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.590
 much better hyundai is 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.970
 Anyway loose in his over 100 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.970
 liter larger trunk
