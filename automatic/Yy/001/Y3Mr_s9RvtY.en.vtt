00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:04.960
 Hi hello 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:10.590
 Well this time on the left hand 

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:12.190
 I will talk about how to practice stretching 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.160
 stretch 

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:22.190
 I'm just spreading coaches in the dark 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:27.560
 If it is boring and your neck hurts, there is not much good thing about c 

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:33.090
 While pulling the code that seems to be usable also in practice 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.360
 To synthesize the practice method to train the left hand 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.600
 Good 

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.600
 It's to this kind of behavior and I actually played Un'n 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.040
 Good 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:47.730
 Good 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.720
 It advanced but called Eemaa after 9 states 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:55.440
 It is not important here what kind of coat is drawn 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:59.960
 Say you are playing if First it is the left hand of how to use 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:03.290
 The 3rd fret of the string forefinger 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:08.540
 5 fret Pollet of in 4-string 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:13.530
 You can use your ring finger instead of your middle finger . 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:17.530
 When I go to usually I say also pulling the middle finger but 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.549
 I am sure to train the stretch this time 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.260
 Let's pull the 5th fret of 4 strings with your ring finger 

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:27.640
 Hmm 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.510
 Reduces in 3 of 7 fret little finger I'm even gone in 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:30.890
 ua 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:33.159
 Good 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:40.030
 ana 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:45.330
 That's beautiful do not think that a sound or likely Do not followed Ne practice gold that it is this 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.220
 If I go out, I 'm not just playing around here, but I'm going to shift this, but variously 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:51.290
 yeah 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.150
 Here Tsu sure that the important or first molecule 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:59.440
 I think the middle finger is probably easier if you hold the ring finger 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:05.650
 Hold down with black finger 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:08.770
 I played the open string of 12 strings just before, but this is also really important 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:10.460
 We do and are making a finger 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.670
 hey 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:17.300
 The open strings become beautiful 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.170
 If the house where this is done is tight and your finger is sleeping 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.860
 Hmm 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:28.280
 You can not get fired 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:29.930
 In this exercise, you need to hold your finger firmly and finish the open strings . 

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.530
 Hm 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:34.450
 Hmm 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:37.599
 If I pull here this time 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.400
 1 fret minutes as it is 

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:41.400
 Up Masuso Then 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:48.180
 Hold your finger firmly so that the open string can be cast here as well 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:58.340
 For another 1 I fret worth is 2 fret I'm sorry 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.340
 2 frets up and boo 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.450
 It is said that it is on the top 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.990
 the first 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:06.700
 Good good 

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:08.160
 Hmm 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.610
 Good good 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.420
 Good good 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:16.300
 Eee yeah 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:22.990
 There is no one that does not get used let's be repeated many times the movement say this 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:24.000
 When the left hand becomes stronger gradually, let's move in various ways without breaking this shape next time 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.430
 Let's go 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:33.000
 It's right hand picking is a variety to the kind to say even with Hey's me 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:35.340
 This time, as I have drawn a 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.790
 Even if I play down, all at once 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.900
 Good good 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.600
 hey ni 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:45.010
 Good good 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.230
 car 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:48.409
 ani 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.409
 yeah yeah 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.890
 Good 

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:59.460
 me 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:04.820
 Absolutely I and has attracted many points this phrase will be strengthening of the left hand 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:04.820
 Stretching will be stronger and your fingers will be firm. 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:14.260
 It's full of good things , and if you do too much before you get along 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:16.760
 In moderation since 7 would do it or would be Teka with wrist gold 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.079
 To the extent that it does not hurt that wrist 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:23.939
 Let's continue this every day 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:31.919
 This is actually it is important to play slowly I was playing slowly now in 

00:04:23.939 --> 00:04:34.430
 Even if painful way Dene and are playing slowly and there is no left hand of power will be useless this 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.430
 About slowly 

00:04:35.079 --> 00:04:40.240
 Yes 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:40.240
 You don't have to go all over 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:44.860
 ani 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.860
 me 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:47.099
 yeah yeah 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:52.050
 Good good 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.050
 Yeah yeah Eee 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:05:01.740
 The left arm should be much stronger if you are alone 

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:03.830
 Finger also to have become it open to it Nari 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:03.830
 a 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:10.510
 So this time it's a simple stretch 

00:05:08.849 --> 00:05:14.100
 Probably strengthening method 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.100
 Thank you for not associating
