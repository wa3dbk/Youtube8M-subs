00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.969 
do and there are graded lines on the
pattern<00:01:20.820> and<00:01:21.030> we<00:01:21.119> just<00:01:21.360> want<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.869> bend<00:01:22.500> the

pattern and we just want to bend the
paper<00:01:23.930> up<00:01:24.930> along<00:01:25.290> those<00:01:25.500> dotted<00:01:25.770> lines<00:01:26.070> and

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
paper up along those dotted lines and

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.940 
paper up along those dotted lines and
then<00:01:26.369> run<00:01:26.640> your<00:01:26.670> nail<00:01:27.060> or<00:01:27.360> something<00:01:27.950> along

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
then run your nail or something along

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.179 
then run your nail or something along
the<00:01:29.310> back<00:01:29.490> just<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:29.970> break<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.950> edge<00:01:31.950> of<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
the back just to break the edge of the

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.490 
the back just to break the edge of the
paper<00:01:32.400> so<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.909> fold<00:01:33.150> eventually<00:01:33.810> each<00:01:34.259> of

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
paper so we can fold eventually each of

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.140 
paper so we can fold eventually each of
these<00:01:34.650> folds<00:01:35.070> are<00:01:35.159> going<00:01:35.310> to<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.490> folding<00:01:35.909> back

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
these folds are going to be folding back

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:41.090 
these folds are going to be folding back
on<00:01:36.360> themselves<00:01:36.710> okay<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:39.350> just<00:01:40.350> get<00:01:40.560> along<00:01:40.829> for

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
on themselves okay so just get along for

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.539 
on themselves okay so just get along for
the<00:01:41.189> time<00:01:41.430> being<00:01:41.759> and<00:01:41.970> each<00:01:43.040> that<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.189> dotted

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
the time being and each that the dotted

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.810 
the time being and each that the dotted
lines<00:01:44.869> the<00:01:45.869> grade<00:01:46.110> of<00:01:46.140> headlines<00:01:46.710> just<00:01:47.579> fold

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
lines the grade of headlines just fold

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.350 
lines the grade of headlines just fold
them<00:01:47.939> back<00:01:48.210> on<00:01:48.390> themselves<00:01:50.090> you'll<00:01:51.090> need<00:01:51.210> to

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
them back on themselves you'll need to

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.660 
them back on themselves you'll need to
turn<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.689> around<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.189> do<00:01:53.189> it<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.399> other<00:01:53.430> way

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
turn it around and do it the other way

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:55.520 
turn it around and do it the other way
as<00:01:53.939> well<00:01:54.149> so<00:01:54.450> we're<00:01:54.570> doing<00:01:54.720> vertically<00:01:55.320> and

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
as well so we're doing vertically and

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.550 
as well so we're doing vertically and
horizontally<00:01:56.719> okay<00:01:57.719> when<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.110> complete

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
horizontally okay when that's complete

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.569 
horizontally okay when that's complete
all<00:01:59.100> of<00:01:59.159> the<00:02:00.710> vertical<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.829> horizontal<00:02:01.950> lines

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579 
all of the vertical and horizontal lines

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:05.060 
all of the vertical and horizontal lines
will<00:02:02.790> have<00:02:02.939> a<00:02:02.969> crease<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.799> now<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.860> next

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
will have a crease in them now the next

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.490 
will have a crease in them now the next
stage<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.640> you'll<00:02:06.090> notice<00:02:06.509> on<00:02:06.750> these

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
stage that you'll notice on these

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.350 
stage that you'll notice on these
corners<00:02:08.129> there's<00:02:08.459> a<00:02:08.520> blank

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
corners there's a blank

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.110 
corners there's a blank
line<00:02:09.570> and<00:02:10.280> they<00:02:11.280> don't<00:02:11.460> go<00:02:11.610> all<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.090> way

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
line and they don't go all the way

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.590 
line and they don't go all the way
across<00:02:12.360> so<00:02:12.870> we<00:02:12.990> just<00:02:13.170> want<00:02:13.440> to<00:02:13.650> fold<00:02:14.370> those<00:02:14.700> in

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
across so we just want to fold those in

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.290 
across so we just want to fold those in
and<00:02:15.930> just<00:02:16.110> crease<00:02:16.440> them<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:17.130> far<00:02:17.490> as<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.910> black

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
and just crease them as far as the black

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:23.300 
and just crease them as far as the black
dotted<00:02:18.570> line<00:02:18.930> is<00:02:19.710> and<00:02:20.280> you<00:02:20.400> can<00:02:20.430> do<00:02:22.160> there<00:02:23.160> are

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
dotted line is and you can do there are

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:25.460 
dotted line is and you can do there are
only<00:02:23.460> four<00:02:23.850> of<00:02:23.940> them<00:02:24.090> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.930> do<00:02:25.080> them<00:02:25.230> both

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
only four of them you can do them both

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.560 
only four of them you can do them both
if<00:02:25.800> you<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.100> across<00:02:26.280> dangling<00:02:27.090> like<00:02:27.210> that<00:02:27.420> with

if you go across dangling like that with
your<00:02:27.690> ruler<00:02:27.990> you<00:02:28.080> can<00:02:28.140> do<00:02:28.410> both<00:02:28.620> of<00:02:28.680> them<00:02:28.920> in

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
your ruler you can do both of them in

your ruler you can do both of them in
one<00:02:29.070> hit<00:02:30.560> okay<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:32.070> we<00:02:32.130> turn<00:02:32.520> our<00:02:32.730> paper<00:02:33.000> the

one hit okay now we turn our paper the

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.090 
one hit okay now we turn our paper the
other<00:02:33.540> way<00:02:33.720> up<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.110> your<00:02:34.320> Lotus<00:02:34.710> you've<00:02:34.890> got

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100

all<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.580> lines<00:02:36.390> there<00:02:36.870> and<00:02:38.600> now<00:02:39.600> we're<00:02:39.750> just

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
all the lines there and now we're just

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.540 
all the lines there and now we're just
going<00:02:39.990> to<00:02:40.230> fold<00:02:40.940> the<00:02:41.940> four<00:02:42.180> sides<00:02:42.510> up<00:02:43.400> so<00:02:44.400> now

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
going to fold the four sides up so now

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.370 
going to fold the four sides up so now
as<00:02:44.700> we<00:02:44.880> bring<00:02:45.120> these<00:02:45.360> two<00:02:45.720> corners<00:02:46.200> together

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
as we bring these two corners together

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.699 
as we bring these two corners together
the<00:02:47.130> little<00:02:47.430> fold<00:02:47.750> you<00:02:48.750> see<00:02:48.989> that<00:02:49.140> little<00:02:49.380> fold

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
the little fold you see that little fold

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:51.860 
the little fold you see that little fold
there<00:02:49.950> just<00:02:50.220> pulls<00:02:50.520> in<00:02:50.820> to<00:02:51.330> get<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.600> edge<00:02:51.690> of

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
there just pulls in to get the edge of

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:55.460 
there just pulls in to get the edge of
the<00:02:52.020> box<00:02:52.230> now<00:02:53.160> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.180> do<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.540> on<00:02:54.720> all<00:02:54.750> four

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
the box now you can do that on all four

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.000 
the box now you can do that on all four
corners<00:02:56.180> and<00:02:57.180> there<00:02:57.660> we've<00:02:57.810> got<00:02:58.050> the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
corners and there we've got the

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.130 
corners and there we've got the
beginnings<00:02:59.160> of<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> box<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.750> get<00:03:00.989> these

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
beginnings of the box just get these

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:05.510 
beginnings of the box just get these
tabs<00:03:01.560> here<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.160> fold<00:03:03.030> them<00:03:03.209> inside<00:03:03.660> and<00:03:04.520> then

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:05.520 
tabs here and fold them inside and then

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.460 
tabs here and fold them inside and then
just<00:03:06.030> bring<00:03:06.209> the<00:03:06.450> box<00:03:06.660> once<00:03:07.080> you've<00:03:07.200> got<00:03:07.350> all

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
just bring the box once you've got all

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:09.979 
just bring the box once you've got all
the<00:03:07.620> all<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:08.000> corners<00:03:09.000> fold<00:03:09.180> it<00:03:09.420> we<00:03:09.780> just

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
the all the corners fold it we just

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.590 
the all the corners fold it we just
bring<00:03:10.170> the<00:03:10.320> box<00:03:10.500> together<00:03:10.800> like<00:03:11.220> that<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:11.730> you

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:12.600 
bring the box together like that and you

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.460 
bring the box together like that and you
can<00:03:12.840> sort<00:03:13.080> of<00:03:13.230> just<00:03:13.560> pull<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.070> heart<00:03:14.340> a<00:03:14.700> half

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
can sort of just pull the heart a half

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.660 
can sort of just pull the heart a half
interlocking<00:03:16.470> will<00:03:17.430> start<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:19.400> pull<00:03:20.400> the<00:03:20.489> box

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
interlocking will start to pull the box

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.150 
interlocking will start to pull the box
together<00:03:20.940> nicely<00:03:21.620> doesn't<00:03:22.620> matter<00:03:22.920> if<00:03:23.010> it

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
together nicely doesn't matter if it

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.590 
together nicely doesn't matter if it
collapses<00:03:23.340> a<00:03:23.760> little<00:03:23.970> bit<00:03:24.120> and<00:03:24.330> get<00:03:24.450> your

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
collapses a little bit and get your

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.229 
collapses a little bit and get your
fingers<00:03:24.930> in<00:03:24.959> there<00:03:25.290> and<00:03:25.440> just<00:03:26.060> start<00:03:27.060> to

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
fingers in there and just start to

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:31.370 
fingers in there and just start to
reshape<00:03:27.690> the<00:03:27.900> box<00:03:28.140> and<00:03:28.580> initially<00:03:30.200> you<00:03:31.200> may

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
reshape the box and initially you may

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.500 
reshape the box and initially you may
have<00:03:31.560> to<00:03:31.769> fiddle<00:03:32.430> around<00:03:32.580> a<00:03:33.000> little<00:03:33.120> bit<00:03:33.330> just

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
have to fiddle around a little bit just

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.039 
have to fiddle around a little bit just
to<00:03:33.720> get<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:33.989> for<00:03:34.140> there<00:03:34.350> you<00:03:34.380> go<00:03:34.620> and<00:03:36.049> that

00:03:37.039 --> 00:03:37.049 
to get it for there you go and that

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.860 
to get it for there you go and that
comfortably<00:03:37.830> that<00:03:38.489> little<00:03:38.730> box<00:03:38.940> there<00:03:39.269> like

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
comfortably that little box there like

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:42.530 
comfortably that little box there like
this<00:03:40.049> one<00:03:40.320> comfortably<00:03:41.100> takes<00:03:41.400> four<00:03:42.360> biscuits

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
this one comfortably takes four biscuits

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.650

thing I probably won't be doing a great
deal<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.540> box<00:03:54.780> making<00:03:55.049> this<00:03:55.320> channel<00:03:55.680> really

deal of box making this channel really

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.070 
deal of box making this channel really
is<00:03:56.040> just<00:03:56.340> about<00:03:56.610> nonsense<00:03:57.239> and<00:03:57.540> gobbly<00:03:57.870> gook

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080
