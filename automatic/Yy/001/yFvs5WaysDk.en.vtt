00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:10.420
 a program to show us the best applications and the best games for 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:14.990
 android that's what every Tuesday we all appreciate here in configurarequipos 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.440
 puntocom today we have selected a series of applications and games that we 

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.439
 they have seemed very interesting so saying that we started to see it 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.960
 begin to arrive the first games for android and quality today all 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.010
 we are talking about samurai 22 2 a game in which we go to the field 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.780
 more ancestral and where we put ourselves in the shoes of a samurai who will have to 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.360
 remove and roll heads of enemy samurai 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.300
 I loved the mechanics it's pretty simple to mark all the enemies here 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.570
 that cross our path 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:01:00.060
 is one of the first that makes it seem that instead of having a mobile we have 

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:04.670
 a portable console because if something stands out is honey are its graphics 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.480
 the downside is that you can only run, we understand that at least they have a 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.740
 processor of a gigahercio although fortunately it is no longer exclusive to 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.400
 the six lived of life without doubt its installation between the 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:24.710
 so many but so many environmental 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.900
 intendants with graphics of less quality but equally attractive comes 

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.780
 also programmed a game that seemed to be a crude copy of the popular mirror 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.310
 has made it responds very well to its purpose the goal of the game is to reach 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.520
 a character from point a to the penal point the difficulty lies in the 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.359
 obstacles and distances between buildings 2nd 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.670
 with your finger saying we activate the punch to eliminate obstacles that 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.970
 let's find ahead with the right though 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.950
 we can jump from one building to another robbery slide on the floor to pass 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:08.360
 below fixed elements at least as late as possible to complete the race 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.979
 more together we will get 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.459
 There are several levels and challenges that we will have to overcome during Thursday indicated 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.750
 Ponce said before when you start running you can not wait anymore so much 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:23.149
 important 

00:02:23.149 --> 00:02:24.990
 also quite attractive 

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:31.050
 people now we leave the fueros and show you a new internal blow out 

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.310
 of the conventional 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.910
 it is called debugging and philadelphia volpe that argentina has as a peculiarity the 

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.800
 possibility of playing using a physics engine 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:44.350
 after this the elements that are displayed on the desktop of your android mobile 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.889
 I also love we have different configuration profiles 

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:56.719
 for example we can use square bubbles as background elements 

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.979
 flowers snow we can also modify the gratuity the properties of the 

00:03:01.979 --> 00:03:06.159
 material after all this panel is used to change 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:10.370
 the reaction of the gravity elements in the sport is to see when 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.019
 we turn the phone today interrupted two with your finger on the screen 

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:20.159
 two 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.329
 end so seeing how he reacts is that at the box office try 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.329
 benefits for the financial sector 

00:03:30.399 --> 00:03:32.159
 they are also cut 

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:40.109
 but the application star river and that undoubtedly sweet redskins imagine what 

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:44.930
 you make a picture and something get out of here we do not like anything with this 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.499
 application we can remove any item in the photo 

00:03:48.499 --> 00:03:56.319
 my career as if I had never existed also in gaza by stripes 

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:59.189
 important oranges 

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.139
 upta 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:07.699
 to use places similar to the rhythm of photos and offer tours three turns 

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:12.090
 allows you to select an element of any photo in several ways and 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:14.660
 replace it with the background of it 

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:19.940
 since it collects samples of the surrounding pixels and replace empty space with 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:23.039
 delete the object by said pixels 

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:29.270
 the result is incredible and allows us to leave our shots as if from a 

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.680
 professional 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.569
 good guys paty finished our show today but few memories 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:41.499
 the power is in the news every day on video in configurarequipos 

00:04:41.499 --> 00:04:45.909
 along with other programs where we talk about the best games 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:51.949
 says analysis of the best products the last details of the market said 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:54.949
 what happens is that one good day 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.599
 p
