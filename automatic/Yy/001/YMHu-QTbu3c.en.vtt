enough of the chemicals that actually

generate normal appetite the problem

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.150 
generate normal appetite the problem
here<00:00:57.420> is<00:00:57.510> very<00:00:57.750> similar<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.559> the<00:00:59.010> brain

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
here is very similar to the brain

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.279 
here is very similar to the brain
chemistry<00:00:59.340> problems<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.300> underlie<00:01:00.840> alcohol

and<00:01:01.440> drug<00:01:01.620> addictions<00:01:02.510> so<00:01:03.510> this<00:01:03.690> means<00:01:03.989> that

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
and drug addictions so this means that

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.950 
and drug addictions so this means that
food<00:01:05.220> addicts<00:01:05.580> are<00:01:05.880> at<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.420> mercy<00:01:06.750> of<00:01:06.780> a

food addicts are at the mercy of a

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.600 
food addicts are at the mercy of a
biological<00:01:07.799> imperative<00:01:08.420> they<00:01:09.420> can't<00:01:09.780> say<00:01:10.140> no

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
biological imperative they can't say no

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.820 
biological imperative they can't say no
this<00:01:11.610> is<00:01:11.790> the<00:01:11.909> reason<00:01:12.299> that<00:01:12.330> willpower<00:01:13.170> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
this is the reason that willpower and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:15.499 
this is the reason that willpower and
psychotherapy<00:01:14.700> fail<00:01:15.000> even<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.390> most

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.630 
away from these drug like carbohydrates
through<00:01:25.680> my<00:01:25.799> years<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.250> clinical<00:01:26.400> experience

through my years of clinical experience

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.260 
through my years of clinical experience
I've<00:01:27.479> found<00:01:27.540> that<00:01:27.960> there<00:01:28.200> are<00:01:28.229> keys<00:01:28.740> to

I've found that there are keys to

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:31.660 
I've found that there are keys to
eliminating<00:01:30.270> these<00:01:30.450> carbohydrate<00:01:31.079> cravings

eliminating these carbohydrate cravings
those<00:01:32.670> keys<00:01:32.970> are<00:01:33.119> very<00:01:33.150> specific<00:01:33.900> nutrients
