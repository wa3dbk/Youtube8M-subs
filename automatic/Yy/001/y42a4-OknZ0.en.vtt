last through friday morning in some
places<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.910> we<00:00:23.910> have<00:00:24.119> going<00:00:24.269> to<00:00:24.359> start<00:00:24.510> off

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
places and we have going to start off

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.759 
places and we have going to start off
with<00:00:24.660> an<00:00:24.779> am<00:00:24.960> here<00:00:25.260> we're<00:00:25.410> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.619> start

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
with an am here we're going to start

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
with an am here we're going to start
with<00:00:25.859> the<00:00:25.949> models<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.550> do<00:00:26.820> not<00:00:27.060> agree<00:00:27.420> with

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
with the models that do not agree with

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.480 
with the models that do not agree with
our<00:00:27.630> forecast<00:00:28.140> first<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> then<00:00:28.830> we<00:00:29.189> don't

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
our forecast first and then we don't

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.030 
our forecast first and then we don't
think<00:00:29.730> that<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.480> name<00:00:30.660> is<00:00:30.689> correct<00:00:31.019> and<00:00:31.410> we'll

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
think that the name is correct and we'll

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.729 
think that the name is correct and we'll
show<00:00:32.189> you<00:00:32.219> why<00:00:32.460> here<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.790> a<00:00:32.850> second<00:00:33.649> this<00:00:34.649> is

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
show you why here in a second this is

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.740 
show you why here in a second this is
actually<00:00:35.010> looking<00:00:35.250> at<00:00:35.399> Wednesday<00:00:36.270> afternoon

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
actually looking at Wednesday afternoon

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.119 
actually looking at Wednesday afternoon
you<00:00:36.930> can<00:00:36.989> see<00:00:37.200> this<00:00:37.290> area<00:00:37.530> of<00:00:37.620> energy<00:00:37.950> down

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
you can see this area of energy down

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.100 
you can see this area of energy down
south<00:00:38.430> here<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.149> Gulf<00:00:39.360> states<00:00:39.690> so<00:00:39.840> this<00:00:39.989> is

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
south here in the Gulf states so this is

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.770 
south here in the Gulf states so this is
what<00:00:40.440> we're<00:00:40.590> following<00:00:41.489> here<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.940> you'll<00:00:42.570> see

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
what we're following here and you'll see

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.350 
what we're following here and you'll see
that<00:00:43.020> it<00:00:43.530> does<00:00:43.829> in<00:00:44.070> fact<00:00:44.100> make<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> turn<00:00:45.180> up

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
that it does in fact make the turn up

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.540 
that it does in fact make the turn up
the<00:00:45.450> coast<00:00:45.690> here<00:00:45.809> actually<00:00:46.770> not<00:00:46.950> in<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.370> pretty

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
the coast here actually not in a pretty

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.850 
the coast here actually not in a pretty
bad<00:00:47.760> position<00:00:48.270> here<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.680> everything<00:00:49.680> looked

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
bad position here the everything looked

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.619 
bad position here the everything looked
like<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.129> was<00:00:50.309> going<00:00:50.700> okay<00:00:51.120> here<00:00:51.360> at<00:00:51.510> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
like it was going okay here at this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
like it was going okay here at this
point<00:00:51.930> and<00:00:52.230> then<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.129> after<00:00:53.820> this<00:00:53.940> point<00:00:54.210> low

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
point and then it after this point low

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.709 
point and then it after this point low
pressure<00:00:54.570> sitting<00:00:54.899> right<00:00:55.110> over<00:00:55.140> hatteras<00:00:55.739> and

00:00:56.709 --> 00:00:56.719 
pressure sitting right over hatteras and

00:00:56.719 --> 00:00:59.090 
pressure sitting right over hatteras and
as<00:00:57.719> some<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> doesn't<00:00:58.649> want<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> close

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
as some reason it doesn't want to close

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.529 
as some reason it doesn't want to close
off<00:00:59.280> as<00:00:59.430> low<00:00:59.609> as<00:00:59.730> only<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.969> thousand<00:01:00.390> for

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
off as low as only a thousand for

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.529 
off as low as only a thousand for
millibars<00:01:01.250> at<00:01:02.250> this<00:01:02.460> point<00:01:02.730> here<00:01:02.969> but<00:01:03.210> that<00:01:03.359> in

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
millibars at this point here but that in

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.530 
millibars at this point here but that in
part<00:01:03.870> is<00:01:04.019> because<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.790> phase<00:01:05.790> comes<00:01:06.180> in<00:01:06.360> too

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
part is because the phase comes in too

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.320 
part is because the phase comes in too
late<00:01:06.840> and<00:01:07.250> the<00:01:08.250> precipitation<00:01:08.760> down<00:01:09.060> south

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
late and the precipitation down south

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.760 
late and the precipitation down south
seems<00:01:09.659> very<00:01:09.840> long<00:01:10.049> consolidate<00:01:10.680> and

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
seems very long consolidate and

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.310 
seems very long consolidate and
unorganized<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.580> did<00:01:12.150> not<00:01:12.270> match<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.570> upper

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
unorganized and did not match the upper

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.590 
unorganized and did not match the upper
air<00:01:13.470> pattern<00:01:13.890> so<00:01:14.070> when<00:01:14.220> we<00:01:14.280> look<00:01:14.430> at<00:01:14.570> you<00:01:15.570> know

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
air pattern so when we look at you know

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.289 
air pattern so when we look at you know
what<00:01:16.049> goes<00:01:16.259> into<00:01:16.470> a<00:01:16.650> storm<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.520> making<00:01:17.850> of<00:01:18.240> a

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
what goes into a storm and making of a

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.050 
what goes into a storm and making of a
storm<00:01:18.570> you<00:01:18.630> have<00:01:18.960> to<00:01:19.200> look<00:01:19.350> at<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:20.060> 500

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
storm you have to look at the 500

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.080 
storm you have to look at the 500
millibar<00:01:21.420> charts<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.020> have<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.320> see<00:01:22.500> what

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
millibar charts and you have to see what

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.830 
millibar charts and you have to see what
exactly<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.180> going<00:01:24.240> on<00:01:24.450> in<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.630> upper

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
exactly is going on in the upper

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.060 
exactly is going on in the upper
atmosphere<00:01:24.960> because<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.530> is<00:01:25.619> going<00:01:25.680> to<00:01:25.830> tell

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
atmosphere because that is going to tell

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.410 
atmosphere because that is going to tell
what's<00:01:26.340> going<00:01:26.400> to<00:01:26.610> happen<00:01:26.909> what<00:01:27.090> down<00:01:27.240> to<00:01:27.330> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
what's going to happen what down to the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.179 
what's going to happen what down to the
surface<00:01:27.600> and<00:01:28.110> we're<00:01:28.560> able<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.799> look<00:01:28.920> at<00:01:29.070> that

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
surface and we're able to look at that

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.980 
surface and we're able to look at that
and<00:01:29.430> see<00:01:29.670> that<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> namm<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.270> not<00:01:30.420> following

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
and see that the namm is not following

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.170 
and see that the namm is not following
the<00:01:31.290> upper<00:01:31.500> air<00:01:31.590> pattern<00:01:31.979> so<00:01:32.250> what<00:01:32.850> it<00:01:32.970> does

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
the upper air pattern so what it does

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.600 
the upper air pattern so what it does
here<00:01:33.590> is<00:01:34.590> kind<00:01:34.829> of<00:01:34.890> little<00:01:35.100> strange<00:01:35.460> here

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
here is kind of little strange here

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.160 
here is kind of little strange here
actually<00:01:36.030> takes<00:01:36.390> it<00:01:36.509> a<00:01:36.600> little<00:01:36.630> bit<00:01:36.900> further

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
actually takes it a little bit further

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.870 
actually takes it a little bit further
to<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> east<00:01:37.619> here<00:01:38.220> just<00:01:38.460> shuts<00:01:38.640> everything

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
to the east here just shuts everything

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.060 
to the east here just shuts everything
East<00:01:39.329> not<00:01:39.930> sure<00:01:40.079> if<00:01:40.140> this<00:01:40.259> is<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.470> convective

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
this is going to be a very weak weak

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.039

event<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.610> it<00:02:21.000> was<00:02:21.120> on<00:02:21.299> its<00:02:21.450> own<00:02:21.629> with<00:02:21.870> this

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
event and it was on its own with this

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:24.410 
event and it was on its own with this
idea<00:02:22.310> until<00:02:23.310> the<00:02:23.459> man<00:02:23.640> came<00:02:23.939> in<00:02:24.120> and<00:02:24.150> just

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
idea until the man came in and just

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:25.850 
idea until the man came in and just
agreed<00:02:24.750> with<00:02:24.780> it<00:02:24.930> a<00:02:25.079> little<00:02:25.200> bit<00:02:25.439> but<00:02:25.620> now<00:02:25.799> the

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
agreed with it a little bit but now the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:29.000 
agreed with it a little bit but now the
gfs<00:02:26.370> has<00:02:26.489> gone<00:02:26.670> the<00:02:26.760> other<00:02:26.819> direction<00:02:28.010> here's

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
gfs has gone the other direction here's

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.729 
gfs has gone the other direction here's
the<00:02:29.390> system<00:02:30.390> here<00:02:30.599> now<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.780> see<00:02:31.109> it's<00:02:31.260> still

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
the system here now you see it's still

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.410 
the system here now you see it's still
east<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.189> Hatteras<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> think<00:02:32.909> this<00:02:33.209> is

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
east of Hatteras here I think this is

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.360 
east of Hatteras here I think this is
incorrect<00:02:34.019> I<00:02:34.260> think<00:02:34.890> it<00:02:34.980> actually<00:02:35.069> their

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
incorrect I think it actually their

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.610 
incorrect I think it actually their
tracks<00:02:35.640> over<00:02:36.090> Hatteras<00:02:36.629> or<00:02:36.810> just<00:02:37.170> to<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:37.409> west

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
tracks over Hatteras or just to the west

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.020 
tracks over Hatteras or just to the west
this<00:02:37.859> is<00:02:38.010> where<00:02:38.159> the<00:02:38.220> euro<00:02:38.400> has<00:02:38.489> it<00:02:38.849> right

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
this is where the euro has it right

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.410 
this is where the euro has it right
about<00:02:39.209> here<00:02:39.500> okay<00:02:40.500> and<00:02:40.879> euro<00:02:41.879> takes<00:02:42.150> along<00:02:42.359> a

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
about here okay and euro takes along a

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.220 
about here okay and euro takes along a
path<00:02:42.659> kind<00:02:43.530> of<00:02:43.590> like<00:02:43.739> this<00:02:44.010> just<00:02:44.430> over

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
path kind of like this just over

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.569 
path kind of like this just over
southeastern<00:02:46.230> Delaware<00:02:46.530> just<00:02:46.950> south<00:02:47.220> of<00:02:47.370> Cape

southeastern Delaware just south of Cape
May<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:48.150> then<00:02:48.810> heads<00:02:49.049> up<00:02:49.230> like<00:02:49.409> this<00:02:49.680> okay<00:02:50.670> and

00:02:50.899 --> 00:02:50.909 
May and then heads up like this okay and

00:02:50.909 --> 00:02:52.819 
May and then heads up like this okay and
because<00:02:51.629> the<00:02:51.690> euro<00:02:51.870> takes<00:02:52.200> that<00:02:52.349> track<00:02:52.680> you

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
because the euro takes that track you

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.039 
because the euro takes that track you
got<00:02:52.980> some<00:02:53.129> really<00:02:53.579> big<00:02:53.879> snows<00:02:54.209> here<00:02:54.510> back<00:02:54.780> here

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:31.399 
eight inch snow storm up in this area
here<00:03:28.680> but<00:03:28.889> it<00:03:29.010> could<00:03:29.370> be<00:03:29.609> a<00:03:29.849> lot<00:03:30.180> more<00:03:30.209> if<00:03:30.780> this

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
here but it could be a lot more if this

of<00:03:54.359> Hatteras<00:03:54.569> here<00:03:55.049> and<00:03:55.169> burly<00:03:55.500> amped<00:03:55.769> up

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
of Hatteras here and burly amped up

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:58.009 
of Hatteras here and burly amped up
already<00:03:56.159> 993<00:03:56.849> millibars<00:03:57.329> at<00:03:57.479> this<00:03:57.599> point<00:03:57.870> and

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
already 993 millibars at this point and

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.649 
already 993 millibars at this point and
again<00:03:58.620> it<00:03:58.769> takes<00:03:58.919> a<00:03:59.069> path<00:03:59.280> just<00:03:59.699> like<00:04:00.000> this<00:04:00.359> and

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:00.659 
again it takes a path just like this and

00:04:00.659 --> 00:04:02.750 
again it takes a path just like this and
then<00:04:01.349> heads<00:04:01.560> up<00:04:01.769> here<00:04:02.069> to<00:04:02.220> the<00:04:02.310> Gulf<00:04:02.489> of<00:04:02.609> Maine

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
then heads up here to the Gulf of Maine

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.000 
then heads up here to the Gulf of Maine
eventually<00:04:03.359> we're<00:04:03.959> really<00:04:04.199> bombs<00:04:04.500> out<00:04:04.739> but

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
eventually we're really bombs out but

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.890 
eventually we're really bombs out but
because<00:04:05.340> it<00:04:05.459> takes<00:04:05.639> that<00:04:05.819> path<00:04:06.090> closer<00:04:06.540> and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
because it takes that path closer and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.839 
because it takes that path closer and
it's<00:04:07.049> more<00:04:07.229> amped<00:04:07.530> up<00:04:07.590> to<00:04:07.739> that<00:04:07.889> point<00:04:08.069> you<00:04:08.699> get

00:04:08.839 --> 00:04:08.849 
it's more amped up to that point you get

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:11.449 
it's more amped up to that point you get
a<00:04:08.909> some<00:04:09.389> seriously<00:04:10.260> heavy<00:04:10.470> snowfall<00:04:11.099> back<00:04:11.280> in

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
a some seriously heavy snowfall back in

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.059 
a some seriously heavy snowfall back in
this<00:04:11.579> area<00:04:11.790> here<00:04:12.150> and<00:04:12.709> reason<00:04:13.709> we're<00:04:13.829> going

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
this area here and reason we're going

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.360 
this area here and reason we're going
with<00:04:14.220> it<00:04:14.370> we<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:14.669> the<00:04:15.120> European<00:04:15.449> model<00:04:15.690> has<00:04:15.840> a

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370 
with it we have the European model has a

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.580 
with it we have the European model has a
51<00:04:17.370> member<00:04:17.699> individual<00:04:18.359> ensembles<00:04:19.199> that<00:04:19.409> run

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
51 member individual ensembles that run

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.129 
51 member individual ensembles that run
with<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.010> European<00:04:20.430> model<00:04:21.299> itself<00:04:21.659> so<00:04:21.989> it's

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:22.139 
with the European model itself so it's

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.600 
with the European model itself so it's
almost<00:04:22.349> like<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.740> you<00:04:23.190> know<00:04:23.279> take<00:04:23.520> the

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
almost like the you know take the

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.670 
almost like the you know take the
European<00:04:24.029> operational<00:04:24.690> run<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.289> main<00:04:25.500> URL

this<00:04:40.560> entire<00:04:40.830> time<00:04:41.100> it's<00:04:41.340> very<00:04:41.550> difficult<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:42.120 
this entire time it's very difficult to

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:43.700 
this entire time it's very difficult to
argue<00:04:42.330> against<00:04:42.690> at<00:04:42.810> your<00:04:42.930> European<00:04:43.500> model

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
argue against at your European model

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.140 
argue against at your European model
with<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:43.919> much<00:04:44.100> support<00:04:44.550> with<00:04:44.790> both

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:45.150 
with that much support with both

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:49.689 
with that much support with both
Canadian<00:04:45.720> model<00:04:45.870> and<00:04:46.199> the<00:04:47.060> UK<00:04:48.060> met<00:04:48.510> same<00:04:49.199> thing

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:49.699 
Canadian model and the UK met same thing

00:04:49.699 --> 00:04:51.890 
Canadian model and the UK met same thing
they're<00:04:50.699> all<00:04:50.850> showing<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.180> very<00:04:51.389> big<00:04:51.570> storm

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
they're all showing a very big storm

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.870 
they're all showing a very big storm
here<00:04:51.960> along<00:04:52.290> the<00:04:52.410> coast<00:04:52.620> so<00:04:52.889> we're<00:04:53.699> going<00:04:53.790> to

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
here along the coast so we're going to

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.610 
here along the coast so we're going to
stick<00:04:54.120> with<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.330> kind<00:04:55.020> of<00:04:55.080> ride<00:04:55.290> the<00:04:55.410> bull

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
stick with it kind of ride the bull

00:04:55.620 --> 00:04:58.460 
stick with it kind of ride the bull
mentally<00:04:56.550> buckshaw<00:04:56.940> here<00:04:57.180> and<00:04:57.389> see<00:04:58.199> where<00:04:58.380> it

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.470 
mentally buckshaw here and see where it

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.050 
mentally buckshaw here and see where it
goes<00:04:58.500> but<00:04:58.889> we're<00:04:59.070> very<00:04:59.250> aggressive<00:04:59.760> with<00:04:59.880> that

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:00.060 
goes but we're very aggressive with that

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:02.510 
goes but we're very aggressive with that
because<00:05:00.389> that<00:05:00.530> because<00:05:01.530> of<00:05:01.680> that<00:05:01.830> we<00:05:02.280> think

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:02.520 
because that because of that we think

snowfall<00:05:36.210> now<00:05:36.780> that<00:05:36.960> we<00:05:37.080> are<00:05:37.200> going<00:05:37.350> to<00:05:37.440> look

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
snowfall now that we are going to look

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.350 
snowfall now that we are going to look
and<00:05:37.770> see<00:05:37.979> if<00:05:38.100> they<00:05:38.250> have<00:05:38.550> any<00:05:38.669> ships<00:05:39.060> in<00:05:39.270> the

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
and see if they have any ships in the

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.779 
and see if they have any ships in the
track<00:05:39.600> hero<00:05:39.900> like<00:05:40.800> I<00:05:40.889> said<00:05:40.950> anything<00:05:41.280> it's

00:05:41.779 --> 00:05:41.789 
track hero like I said anything it's

00:05:41.789 --> 00:05:43.790 
track hero like I said anything it's
going<00:05:42.030> to<00:05:42.090> be<00:05:42.150> further<00:05:42.389> east<00:05:42.660> here<00:05:42.990> is<00:05:43.139> going

00:05:43.790 --> 00:05:43.800 
going to be further east here is going

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:45.230 
going to be further east here is going
to<00:05:43.860> make<00:05:43.950> a<00:05:43.979> big<00:05:44.070> difference<00:05:44.220> here<00:05:44.820> I<00:05:45.000> don't

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
to make a big difference here I don't

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.300 
to make a big difference here I don't
know<00:05:45.300> what<00:05:45.389> I<00:05:45.419> just<00:05:45.479> did<00:05:45.690> there<00:05:46.220> then<00:05:47.220> you

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:47.310 
know what I just did there then you

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:49.670 
know what I just did there then you
think<00:05:47.460> it<00:05:47.610> makes<00:05:47.760> it<00:05:47.970> just<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.539> shift<00:05:49.260> just<00:05:49.470> to

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
think it makes it just a shift just to

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.379 
think it makes it just a shift just to
this<00:05:49.860> point<00:05:50.130> right<00:05:50.280> here<00:05:50.430> instead<00:05:51.030> of<00:05:51.090> being

00:05:51.379 --> 00:05:51.389 
this point right here instead of being

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:53.240 
this point right here instead of being
right<00:05:51.539> along<00:05:51.810> Cape<00:05:52.050> May<00:05:52.229> here<00:05:52.530> will<00:05:53.039> now<00:05:53.190> shift

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.250 
right along Cape May here will now shift

00:05:53.250 --> 00:05:54.770 
right along Cape May here will now shift
this<00:05:53.610> access<00:05:54.000> a<00:05:54.030> little<00:05:54.300> bit<00:05:54.419> further<00:05:54.539> to<00:05:54.630> the

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
this access a little bit further to the

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690 
this access a little bit further to the
south<00:05:55.020> east<00:05:55.289> so<00:05:55.530> you<00:05:56.039> might<00:05:56.220> have<00:05:56.340> a<00:05:56.400> cutoff

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
south east so you might have a cutoff

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.810 
south east so you might have a cutoff
rate<00:05:57.660> about<00:05:57.870> here<00:05:58.200> instead<00:05:58.560> so<00:05:59.280> that's

00:05:59.810 --> 00:05:59.820 
rate about here instead so that's

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:01.400 
rate about here instead so that's
something<00:06:00.030> we<00:06:00.210> have<00:06:00.360> to<00:06:00.450> watch<00:06:00.599> for<00:06:00.630> there's

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
something we have to watch for there's

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:02.839 
something we have to watch for there's
gonna<00:06:01.620> be<00:06:01.710> a<00:06:01.740> pretty<00:06:01.919> tight<00:06:02.220> grading<00:06:02.700> of<00:06:02.789> the

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:02.849 
gonna be a pretty tight grading of the

00:06:02.849 --> 00:06:04.430 
gonna be a pretty tight grading of the
wet<00:06:03.000> on<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:03.180> northwest<00:06:03.570> side<00:06:03.660> here<00:06:04.080> so<00:06:04.289> we're

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:04.440 
wet on the northwest side here so we're

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.440 
wet on the northwest side here so we're
going<00:06:04.530> to<00:06:04.650> narrow<00:06:05.550> that<00:06:05.700> down<00:06:05.760> when<00:06:06.030> we<00:06:06.060> get<00:06:06.270> to

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
going to narrow that down when we get to

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.050
