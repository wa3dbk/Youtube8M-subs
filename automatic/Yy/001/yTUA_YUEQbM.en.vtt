the question reads epitopes are the

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:06.040 
the question reads epitopes are the
molecular<00:00:03.860> regions<00:00:04.490> of<00:00:04.670> antigens<00:00:05.240> that<00:00:05.840> can

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:06.050

hydrophobic<00:00:26.060> bonds<00:00:26.289> so<00:00:27.289> this<00:00:27.859> question

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:28.429 
hydrophobic bonds so this question

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.130 
hydrophobic bonds so this question
actually<00:00:29.240> appears<00:00:29.630> to<00:00:29.779> be<00:00:29.900> a<00:00:29.929> lot<00:00:30.109> more

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
actually appears to be a lot more

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.230 
actually appears to be a lot more
difficult<00:00:30.439> than<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:30.949> is<00:00:31.099> it's<00:00:31.669> just<00:00:31.939> a<00:00:32.029> very

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:32.240 
difficult than it is it's just a very

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.390 
difficult than it is it's just a very
clever<00:00:32.509> way<00:00:32.840> of<00:00:32.990> asking<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.590> about<00:00:33.710> protein

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:34.400 
clever way of asking you about protein

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.520 
clever way of asking you about protein
protein<00:00:34.850> interactions<00:00:35.140> let's<00:00:36.140> think<00:00:36.260> about

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
protein interactions let's think about

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:38.680 
protein interactions let's think about
it<00:00:36.680> we<00:00:37.160> have<00:00:37.310> an<00:00:37.460> antigen<00:00:38.000> and<00:00:38.210> we<00:00:38.420> have<00:00:38.570> an

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
it we have an antigen and we have an

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:41.560 
it we have an antigen and we have an
epitope<00:00:39.140> antigens<00:00:40.010> can<00:00:40.880> be<00:00:41.000> proteins<00:00:41.390> and

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:41.570 
epitope antigens can be proteins and

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.630 
epitope antigens can be proteins and
epitopes<00:00:42.410> are<00:00:42.530> generally<00:00:42.860> proteins<00:00:43.310> as<00:00:43.460> well

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:43.640 
epitopes are generally proteins as well

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.850 
epitopes are generally proteins as well
so<00:00:44.300> we're<00:00:44.480> looking<00:00:44.750> at<00:00:44.870> two<00:00:45.020> proteins<00:00:45.590> and

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
so we're looking at two proteins and

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.280 
so we're looking at two proteins and
inside<00:00:46.550> of<00:00:46.730> the<00:00:46.850> diagram<00:00:47.300> here<00:00:47.690> on<00:00:47.840> the<00:00:47.930> figure

acid side chains that belong to these
proteins<00:00:55.010> that<00:00:55.220> are<00:00:55.280> involved<00:00:55.640> in<00:00:56.090> these

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:56.270 
proteins that are involved in these

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.810 
proteins that are involved in these
interactions<00:00:56.920> remember<00:00:57.920> D<00:00:58.160> is<00:00:58.460> the

abbreviation for aspartic acid and if

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.950 
abbreviation for aspartic acid and if
you<00:01:01.340> recall<00:01:01.610> your<00:01:01.790> biochemistry<00:01:02.360> remember

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
you recall your biochemistry remember

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:05.529 
you recall your biochemistry remember
that<00:01:03.200> aspartic<00:01:03.830> acid<00:01:04.339> has<00:01:04.939> a<00:01:04.969> negatively

00:01:05.529 --> 00:01:05.539 
that aspartic acid has a negatively

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:08.830 
that aspartic acid has a negatively
charged<00:01:06.020> sidechain<00:01:06.740> n<00:01:07.189> of<00:01:08.000> course<00:01:08.479> is<00:01:08.659> for

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
charged sidechain n of course is for

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.719 
charged sidechain n of course is for
asparagine<00:01:09.439> which<00:01:09.859> has<00:01:10.039> a<00:01:10.070> positively

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:10.729 
asparagine which has a positively

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:13.330 
asparagine which has a positively
charged<00:01:11.149> sidechain<00:01:11.840> and<00:01:12.049> RS<00:01:12.770> for<00:01:12.920> arginine

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:13.340 
charged sidechain and RS for arginine

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.099 
charged sidechain and RS for arginine
which<00:01:13.490> also<00:01:13.700> has<00:01:14.000> a<00:01:14.030> positively<00:01:14.630> charged

00:01:15.099 --> 00:01:15.109 
which also has a positively charged

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:17.529 
which also has a positively charged
sidechain<00:01:15.979> so<00:01:16.549> we<00:01:16.729> see<00:01:16.969> that<00:01:17.240> we<00:01:17.390> have

00:01:17.529 --> 00:01:17.539 
sidechain so we see that we have

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:20.139 
sidechain so we see that we have
interactions<00:01:18.320> between<00:01:18.499> negative<00:01:18.880> here<00:01:19.880> and

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
interactions between negative here and

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:22.630 
interactions between negative here and
positive<00:01:20.560> positively<00:01:21.560> charged<00:01:22.009> side<00:01:22.579> chains

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
positive positively charged side chains

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880 
positive positively charged side chains
so<00:01:23.270> we<00:01:23.420> are<00:01:23.570> actually<00:01:23.990> looking<00:01:24.109> at<00:01:24.380> lecture

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
so we are actually looking at lecture

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.429 
so we are actually looking at lecture
static<00:01:25.399> interactions<00:01:26.149> these<00:01:26.719> of<00:01:26.990> course<00:01:27.170> are

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:27.439 
static interactions these of course are

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:30.309 
static interactions these of course are
a<00:01:27.499> type<00:01:27.799> of<00:01:27.829> intermolecular<00:01:28.729> force<00:01:29.390> so<00:01:30.140> let's

00:01:30.309 --> 00:01:30.319 
a type of intermolecular force so let's

00:01:30.319 --> 00:01:32.200 
a type of intermolecular force so let's
take<00:01:30.499> a<00:01:30.530> look<00:01:30.740> at<00:01:30.859> this<00:01:31.039> diagram<00:01:31.310> just<00:01:31.729> to

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
take a look at this diagram just to

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.389 
take a look at this diagram just to
refresh<00:01:32.450> our<00:01:32.719> memory<00:01:33.020> here<00:01:33.619> is<00:01:33.740> lysine<00:01:34.189> which

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
refresh our memory here is lysine which

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:36.819 
refresh our memory here is lysine which
is<00:01:34.520> also<00:01:34.939> an<00:01:35.329> example<00:01:35.749> of<00:01:35.960> amino<00:01:36.350> acid<00:01:36.679> with<00:01:36.799> a

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:36.829 
is also an example of amino acid with a

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:38.380 
is also an example of amino acid with a
charged<00:01:37.520> sidechain

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:38.390 
charged sidechain

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.649 
charged sidechain
notice<00:01:38.990> that<00:01:39.229> the<00:01:39.560> nitrogen<00:01:40.189> here<00:01:40.969> in<00:01:41.119> lysine

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 
notice that the nitrogen here in lysine

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.379 
notice that the nitrogen here in lysine
has<00:01:41.929> a<00:01:41.960> positive<00:01:42.499> charge<00:01:42.670> that's<00:01:43.670> capable<00:01:43.969> of

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:44.389 
has a positive charge that's capable of

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:47.200 
has a positive charge that's capable of
interact<00:01:45.139> with<00:01:45.409> glutamate<00:01:46.039> or<00:01:46.249> glutamic<00:01:46.670> acid

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
interact with glutamate or glutamic acid

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.510 
interact with glutamate or glutamic acid
or<00:01:47.499> specifically<00:01:48.499> the<00:01:48.619> oxygen<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.490> that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:49.520 
or specifically the oxygen in that

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.059 
or specifically the oxygen in that
molecule<00:01:50.329> so<00:01:50.869> we<00:01:50.990> have<00:01:51.170> an<00:01:51.289> intermolecular

00:01:52.059 --> 00:01:52.069 
molecule so we have an intermolecular

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:55.149 
molecule so we have an intermolecular
force<00:01:52.819> or<00:01:53.119> an<00:01:53.210> intermolecular<00:01:53.719> attraction<00:01:54.590> so

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159 
force or an intermolecular attraction so

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.069 
force or an intermolecular attraction so
this<00:01:55.340> of<00:01:55.520> course<00:01:55.549> is<00:01:55.939> electrostatic<00:01:56.389> because

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:57.079 
this of course is electrostatic because

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:59.529 
this of course is electrostatic because
of<00:01:57.229> the<00:01:57.350> opposite<00:01:57.859> charges<00:01:58.219> so<00:01:58.939> going<00:01:59.119> back<00:01:59.359> to

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
of the opposite charges so going back to

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:02.020 
of the opposite charges so going back to
our<00:01:59.569> question<00:02:00.200> we<00:02:00.380> see<00:02:00.649> that<00:02:01.249> the<00:02:01.700> type<00:02:01.999> of

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
our question we see that the type of

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.819 
our question we see that the type of
interaction<00:02:02.479> that's<00:02:03.020> formed<00:02:03.469> or<00:02:03.649> bond

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:03.829 
interaction that's formed or bond

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:07.300 
interaction that's formed or bond
between<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:05.380> epitope<00:02:06.380> and<00:02:06.530> the<00:02:06.709> antigen<00:02:07.130> is

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:07.310 
between the epitope and the antigen is

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:09.490 
between the epitope and the antigen is
an<00:02:07.459> electrostatic<00:02:07.939> interaction<00:02:08.840> now<00:02:09.470> I

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:09.500 
an electrostatic interaction now I

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.560 
an electrostatic interaction now I
stress<00:02:09.950> here<00:02:10.250> that<00:02:10.460> this<00:02:10.670> question<00:02:11.300> is<00:02:11.420> really

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
stress here that this question is really

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.360 
stress here that this question is really
asking<00:02:11.810> us<00:02:12.140> about<00:02:12.260> protein<00:02:12.890> protein

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
asking us about protein protein

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.460 
asking us about protein protein
interactions

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
interactions

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.110 
interactions
and<00:02:14.590> I<00:02:14.650> keep<00:02:14.860> using<00:02:15.100> the<00:02:15.310> word<00:02:15.340> intermolecular

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and I keep using the word intermolecular

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.200 
and I keep using the word intermolecular
to<00:02:16.510> remind<00:02:16.840> you<00:02:17.050> that<00:02:17.110> :<00:02:17.830> covalent<00:02:18.490> bonds<00:02:18.940> here

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:19.210 
to remind you that : covalent bonds here

00:02:19.210 --> 00:02:23.040 
to remind you that : covalent bonds here
in<00:02:19.360> choice<00:02:19.570> C<00:02:19.900> are<00:02:20.740> intra<00:02:21.690> molecular<00:02:22.690> forces

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
in choice C are intra molecular forces

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.320 
in choice C are intra molecular forces
that<00:02:23.560> means<00:02:23.770> they<00:02:24.010> are<00:02:24.130> within<00:02:24.610> the<00:02:24.820> molecule

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
that means they are within the molecule

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.540 
that means they are within the molecule
but<00:02:25.780> here<00:02:26.050> we<00:02:26.170> have<00:02:26.380> two<00:02:26.620> separate<00:02:26.980> molecules

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
but here we have two separate molecules

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.680 
but here we have two separate molecules
so<00:02:27.850> we<00:02:27.880> should<00:02:28.180> not<00:02:28.390> choose<00:02:29.230> choice<00:02:29.650> C<00:02:30.010> also

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
so we should not choose choice C also

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.260 
so we should not choose choice C also
notice<00:02:31.690> that<00:02:31.720> nonpolar<00:02:32.560> interactions<00:02:33.550> can

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
notice that nonpolar interactions can

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.230 
notice that nonpolar interactions can
also<00:02:34.480> be<00:02:34.780> referred<00:02:35.080> to<00:02:35.110> as<00:02:35.320> hydrophobic

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
also be referred to as hydrophobic

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.760 
also be referred to as hydrophobic
interactions<00:02:37.240> so<00:02:37.750> choice<00:02:37.960> of<00:02:38.170> a<00:02:38.320> and<00:02:38.500> B<00:02:38.620> are

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
interactions so choice of a and B are

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.470 
interactions so choice of a and B are
actually<00:02:39.670> the<00:02:39.790> same<00:02:40.000> thing

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:40.480 
actually the same thing

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.960 
actually the same thing
remember<00:02:41.200> if<00:02:41.320> you<00:02:41.530> recall<00:02:41.890> for<00:02:42.640> instance

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
remember if you recall for instance

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.420 
remember if you recall for instance
hydrocarbons<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.960> oils<00:02:44.290> lipids<00:02:44.710> those<00:02:45.130> form

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:45.430 
hydrocarbons and oils lipids those form

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:47.910 
hydrocarbons and oils lipids those form
nonpolar<00:02:45.940> interactions<00:02:46.810> and<00:02:46.990> we<00:02:47.500> know<00:02:47.680> that

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:47.920 
nonpolar interactions and we know that

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.520 
nonpolar interactions and we know that
lipids<00:02:48.370> are<00:02:48.490> also<00:02:48.700> hydrophobic<00:02:49.660> so<00:02:50.140> choices

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
lipids are also hydrophobic so choices

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.520 
lipids are also hydrophobic so choices
indeed<00:02:51.010> we<00:02:51.190> should<00:02:51.250> have<00:02:51.580> eliminated<00:02:51.880> and

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
indeed we should have eliminated and

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.840 
indeed we should have eliminated and
remembering<00:02:53.530> that<00:02:53.650> covalent<00:02:54.430> bonds<00:02:54.760> are

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
remembering that covalent bonds are

00:02:54.850 --> 00:02:56.760 
remembering that covalent bonds are
intramolecular<00:02:55.810> we<00:02:56.380> should<00:02:56.560> eliminate

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
intramolecular we should eliminate

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:59.580 
intramolecular we should eliminate
choice<00:02:57.310> C<00:02:57.580> because<00:02:58.150> we<00:02:58.300> were<00:02:58.390> asked<00:02:58.810> about<00:02:58.870> the

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
choice C because we were asked about the

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:01.980 
choice C because we were asked about the
forces<00:02:59.950> or<00:03:00.220> interactions<00:03:00.910> between<00:03:01.120> one

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
forces or interactions between one

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.990 
forces or interactions between one
protein<00:03:02.530> which<00:03:02.800> is<00:03:02.830> an<00:03:03.040> epitope<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.640> another

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
protein which is an epitope and another

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.930 
protein which is an epitope and another
which<00:03:04.270> is<00:03:04.300> an<00:03:04.540> antigen<00:03:05.020> so<00:03:05.620> in<00:03:05.740> this<00:03:05.920> case<00:03:06.640> the

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
which is an antigen so in this case the

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.270 
which is an antigen so in this case the
correct<00:03:07.180> response<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.810> B<00:03:08.280> electrostatic

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
correct response is B electrostatic

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.540 
correct response is B electrostatic
interactions<00:03:10.090> are<00:03:10.270> responsible<00:03:11.260> for<00:03:11.550> the

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:12.550 
interactions are responsible for the

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:15.180 
interactions are responsible for the
interaction<00:03:13.209> between<00:03:13.240> the<00:03:14.080> epitope<00:03:14.500> and<00:03:14.709> the
