00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:30.630
There is some lag when playing too fast.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.720
The minecart generates the notes by passing detector rails.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.720
This button sends a new minecart.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.820
Each white key has a separate input that
powers a noteblock as well as the pistons.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:40.960
Each row has 8 detector rails.
They are spaced so that you can play the same
note again if you skip at least one detector.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.960
And yes, the wiring is a mess.

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.250
Let's see how a key works.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.710
Powering the input activates the note block
and retracts the pistons.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.740
The electricity moves down the stair.
In the middle row it powers each piston as usual.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.100
Each wire also powers the block beneath it.
Pistons are activated by being adjacent to
a powered block, so the side rows are also
activated.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:22.610
Then we just add more sticky pistons
on the top of the first ones until we
have a level surface.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.020
Once more.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.560
It's too slow, but not much to do about that.
