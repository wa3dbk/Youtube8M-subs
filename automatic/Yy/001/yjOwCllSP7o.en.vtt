the<00:02:11.740> old<00:02:12.040> 20<00:02:12.580> year<00:02:12.730> old<00:02:12.880> unit<00:02:13.270> I<00:02:13.420> think<00:02:13.450> it's

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
the old 20 year old unit I think it's

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.150 
the old 20 year old unit I think it's
time<00:02:13.900> for<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.320> go<00:02:14.470> boo<00:02:14.709> bye

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:15.160 
time for it to go boo bye

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:16.860 
time for it to go boo bye
and<00:02:15.700> I'll<00:02:15.820> clean<00:02:16.000> it<00:02:16.030> up<00:02:16.240> a<00:02:16.330> little<00:02:16.390> bit<00:02:16.690> to

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
and I'll clean it up a little bit to

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.670 
and I'll clean it up a little bit to
know<00:02:17.500> so<00:02:17.830> like<00:02:17.890> shit<00:02:18.550> although<00:02:19.320> what's<00:02:20.320> better

know so like shit although what's better
who<00:02:21.370> needs<00:02:21.550> ABS<00:02:22.620> especially<00:02:23.620> rear<00:02:23.860> wheel<00:02:24.100> ABS

who needs ABS especially rear wheel ABS

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.250 
who needs ABS especially rear wheel ABS
is<00:02:24.970> bullshit<00:02:26.130> but<00:02:27.130> uh<00:02:27.600> what<00:02:28.600> the<00:02:28.780> hell<00:02:28.900> Kevin

he<00:02:29.530> has<00:02:29.709> that<00:02:29.980> um<00:02:31.050> way<00:02:32.050> to<00:02:32.110> hear<00:02:32.350> structures<00:02:32.860> we

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
he has that um way to hear structures we

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.810 
he has that um way to hear structures we
have<00:02:33.310> the<00:02:33.519> vortex<00:02:34.800> the<00:02:35.800> big<00:02:36.010> UN<00:02:36.340> on<00:02:36.459> the<00:02:36.580> side

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
have the vortex the big UN on the side

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.390 
have the vortex the big UN on the side
apparently<00:02:37.630> you<00:02:37.989> can<00:02:38.140> put<00:02:38.260> this<00:02:38.440> whole<00:02:39.070> setup

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
apparently you can put this whole setup

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.060 
apparently you can put this whole setup
on<00:02:39.790> a<00:02:40.050> Vortech<00:02:41.050> error<00:02:41.320> trunk<00:02:41.739> and<00:02:43.530> every<00:02:44.530> 95<00:02:45.040> I

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
on a Vortech error trunk and every 95 I

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:47.460 
on a Vortech error trunk and every 95 I
think<00:02:45.550> they<00:02:45.670> had<00:02:45.820> it<00:02:45.850> 295<00:02:46.660> still<00:02:46.989> throttle

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:47.470 
think they had it 295 still throttle

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.000 
think they had it 295 still throttle
body<00:02:47.650> but<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.810> can<00:02:49.959> put<00:02:50.110> all<00:02:50.230> this<00:02:50.380> stuff<00:02:50.530> on<00:02:50.950> a

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
body but you can put all this stuff on a

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.860 
body but you can put all this stuff on a
96<00:02:51.730> if<00:02:51.880> you<00:02:52.000> get<00:02:52.150> all<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.330> parts<00:02:52.660> then

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:52.870 
96 if you get all the parts then

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:55.170 
96 if you get all the parts then
fortunately<00:02:53.350> well<00:02:53.620> everything<00:02:54.070> it<00:02:54.190> works<00:02:54.370> so

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
fortunately well everything it works so

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.979 
fortunately well everything it works so
this<00:02:55.959> is<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.200> trick<00:02:56.620> for<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:58.360> older<00:02:58.690> trucks

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
this is a trick for the older trucks

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:01.259 
this is a trick for the older trucks
that's<00:02:59.709> it<00:03:00.010> you<00:03:00.190> get<00:03:00.370> a<00:03:00.400> union<00:03:00.730> right<00:03:01.030> over

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:01.269 
that's it you get a union right over

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.030 
that's it you get a union right over
there<00:03:01.390> -<00:03:01.630> you<00:03:01.959> can<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.230> probably<00:03:02.470> plumb<00:03:02.860> all

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
there - you can just probably plumb all

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.850 
there - you can just probably plumb all
this<00:03:03.250> um<00:03:03.959> all<00:03:04.959> these<00:03:05.140> hard<00:03:05.410> lines<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:05.860 
this um all these hard lines and

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.810 
this um all these hard lines and
everything<00:03:06.220> get<00:03:06.370> it<00:03:06.459> right<00:03:06.580> from<00:03:06.730> the

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
everything get it right from the

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:08.940 
everything get it right from the
junkyard<00:03:07.120> it's<00:03:07.450> in<00:03:07.570> good<00:03:07.810> shape<00:03:08.049> put<00:03:08.860> them

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:08.950 
junkyard it's in good shape put them

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:11.880 
junkyard it's in good shape put them
right<00:03:09.100> to<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.340> Union<00:03:09.760> then<00:03:10.269> the<00:03:10.480> fron<00:03:10.890> the

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
right to that Union then the fron the

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.560 
right to that Union then the fron the
front<00:03:12.190> goes<00:03:12.489> over<00:03:12.730> here<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.060> splits<00:03:13.390> right

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:13.570 
front goes over here it splits right

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.090 
front goes over here it splits right
over<00:03:13.780> there<00:03:13.959> and<00:03:14.140> to<00:03:14.760> this<00:03:15.760> three-way<00:03:16.630> block

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
over there and to this three-way block

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.949 
over there and to this three-way block
so<00:03:18.100> you<00:03:18.130> just<00:03:18.459> tap<00:03:18.670> into<00:03:19.000> there<00:03:19.180> there<00:03:19.630> it's

00:03:19.949 --> 00:03:19.959 
so you just tap into there there it's

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:22.890 
so you just tap into there there it's
pretty<00:03:20.140> simple<00:03:20.530> but<00:03:21.540> thinking<00:03:22.540> about<00:03:22.720> getting

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
pretty simple but thinking about getting

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.180 
pretty simple but thinking about getting
rid<00:03:23.110> of<00:03:23.140> that<00:03:24.540> same<00:03:25.540> simple<00:03:25.930> to<00:03:26.410> earlier<00:03:26.860> model

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:27.190 
rid of that same simple to earlier model

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:32.030 
rid of that same simple to earlier model
trucks<00:03:27.489> like<00:03:27.850> early<00:03:28.680> like<00:03:29.680> that<00:03:29.950> really<00:03:30.430> nice

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:42.879 
yeah it has a little different setup and

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:44.849 
yeah it has a little different setup and
you<00:03:43.150> need<00:03:43.299> an<00:03:43.450> adapter<00:03:43.810> for<00:03:44.079> the<00:03:44.349> portioning

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
you need an adapter for the portioning

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.309 
you need an adapter for the portioning
valve<00:03:45.159> one<00:03:45.569> this<00:03:46.569> thing<00:03:46.840> -<00:03:47.049> biggest

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
valve one this thing - biggest

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:51.270 
valve one this thing - biggest
quarter-inch<00:03:47.939> goes<00:03:48.939> right<00:03:49.180> in<00:03:49.359> so<00:03:49.859> that<00:03:50.859> is

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:51.280 
quarter-inch goes right in so that is

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.380 
quarter-inch goes right in so that is
what<00:03:51.489> we're<00:03:51.670> up<00:03:51.700> against

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
what we're up against

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:55.800 
what we're up against
maybe<00:03:53.079> we'll<00:03:53.260> get<00:03:53.409> rid<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.650> the<00:03:53.769> shit<00:03:54.450> valve<00:03:55.450> -

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
maybe we'll get rid of the shit valve -

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.449 
maybe we'll get rid of the shit valve -
they<00:03:56.500> don't<00:03:56.650> make<00:03:56.859> it<00:03:57.010> anymore

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
they don't make it anymore

00:04:11.399 --> 00:04:11.409 
Yeah right I was thinking this too is

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.129 
Yeah right I was thinking this too is
you<00:04:12.400> know<00:04:12.489> that<00:04:12.730> I<00:04:12.790> was<00:04:12.939> could<00:04:13.060> edit<00:04:13.239> I<00:04:13.659> was

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
you know that I was could edit I was

00:04:14.139 --> 00:04:16.610 
you know that I was could edit I was
just<00:04:14.260> thinking<00:04:14.530> about<00:04:14.680> again<00:04:14.859> a<00:04:14.920> Union<00:04:15.340> Union

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
just thinking about again a Union Union

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.680 
just thinking about again a Union Union
line<00:04:17.620> Union<00:04:18.519> and<00:04:18.820> then<00:04:19.030> I<00:04:19.060> could<00:04:19.269> delete<00:04:19.479> this

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:19.690 
line Union and then I could delete this

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.439 
line Union and then I could delete this
