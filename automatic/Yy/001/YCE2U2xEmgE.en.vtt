00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
I'm but it all ended well and my

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.609 
I'm but it all ended well and my
decision<00:01:31.590> like<00:01:31.770> I<00:01:31.799> said<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.400> hurts<00:01:33.560> right<00:01:34.560> now

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
decision like I said it hurts right now

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.410 
decision like I said it hurts right now
we<00:01:35.430> put<00:01:36.150> polysporin<00:01:36.990> on<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.770> we<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.130> like

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
we put polysporin on it and we have like

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.539 
we put polysporin on it and we have like
massive<00:01:39.420> amount<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.930> God's<00:01:40.229> on<00:01:40.619> it<00:01:40.799> because<00:01:41.400> it

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
massive amount to God's on it because it

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:43.310 
massive amount to God's on it because it
hurts<00:01:41.759> to<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.090> anything<00:01:42.390> rub<00:01:42.780> against<00:01:43.200> it

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
hurts to have anything rub against it

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:48.139 
hurts to have anything rub against it
and<00:01:44.750> so<00:01:45.750> I'm<00:01:46.590> not<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.890> very<00:01:47.220> happy<00:01:47.579> camper<00:01:47.909> right

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
and so I'm not a very happy camper right

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.690 
and so I'm not a very happy camper right
now<00:01:48.530> but<00:01:49.530> that's<00:01:49.680> what<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:49.979> told<00:01:50.040> you<00:01:50.310> I<00:01:50.460> would

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
really tired so it's probably good that

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.100
