today<00:00:14.740> on<00:00:14.890> science<00:00:15.130> you<00:00:15.370> stuff<00:00:15.580> you're<00:00:15.820> going

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
today on science you stuff you're going

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.910 
today on science you stuff you're going
to<00:00:16.269> be<00:00:16.420> picking<00:00:16.630> up<00:00:16.840> an<00:00:17.050> ice<00:00:17.170> cube<00:00:17.410> with<00:00:17.680> piece

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
to be picking up an ice cube with piece

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.849 
to be picking up an ice cube with piece
of<00:00:18.279> string<00:00:19.710> so<00:00:21.210> for<00:00:22.210> picking<00:00:22.779> up<00:00:22.900> our<00:00:23.320> ice<00:00:23.529> cube

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:23.859 
of string so for picking up our ice cube

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.569 
of string so for picking up our ice cube
with<00:00:24.220> a<00:00:24.489> piece<00:00:24.849> of<00:00:24.880> string<00:00:25.179> we<00:00:25.539> need<00:00:25.810> salt

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
with a piece of string we need salt

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:31.950 
with a piece of string we need salt
some<00:00:27.579> string<00:00:27.849> a<00:00:29.220> plate<00:00:30.220> and<00:00:30.579> some<00:00:31.419> ice<00:00:31.539> cubes

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:31.960 
some string a plate and some ice cubes

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:42.310 
some string a plate and some ice cubes
I<00:00:31.989> shall<00:00:32.829> go<00:00:32.950> get<00:00:33.100> those<00:00:33.250> now

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.780 

you<00:00:43.320> have<00:00:43.470> Arsenal's<00:00:45.050> slight<00:00:46.050> leak<00:00:46.230> nothing

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:46.790 
you have Arsenal's slight leak nothing

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.940 
you have Arsenal's slight leak nothing
okay<00:00:48.650> listen<00:00:49.650> to<00:00:50.130> melki<00:00:50.930> this<00:00:51.930> one<00:00:52.140> so<00:00:52.890> you

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:52.950 
okay listen to melki this one so you

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.840 
okay listen to melki this one so you
have<00:00:53.160> an<00:00:53.280> ice<00:00:53.400> cube

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
have an ice cube

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.190 
have an ice cube
I'm<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.080> to<00:00:55.170> place<00:00:55.620> it<00:00:55.650> on<00:00:55.890> our<00:00:55.980> plate<00:00:57.200> get

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:58.200 
I'm going to place it on our plate get

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:07.700 
I'm going to place it on our plate get
some<00:00:58.530> string<00:01:00.140> and<00:01:01.140> I<00:01:01.410> can<00:01:02.010> get<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.310> wet

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.069 

and<00:01:08.710> we<00:01:09.100> placed<00:01:09.340> it<00:01:09.490> on<00:01:09.549> our<00:01:09.759> ice<00:01:09.880> cube<00:01:10.119> and<00:01:10.810> we

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:11.079 
and we placed it on our ice cube and we

00:01:11.079 --> 00:01:18.810 
and we placed it on our ice cube and we
get<00:01:11.229> some<00:01:11.439> of<00:01:11.470> our<00:01:12.600> salt<00:01:16.860> salt<00:01:17.860> on<00:01:18.130> top<00:01:18.520> of<00:01:18.670> our

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
get some of our salt salt on top of our

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:26.500 
get some of our salt salt on top of our
ice<00:01:19.270> cube<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.070> wait<00:01:21.750> about<00:01:22.750> a<00:01:22.869> minute

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:26.510 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.710 

okay<00:01:27.510> about<00:01:27.690> one<00:01:27.840> and<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.020> half<00:01:28.050> minutes

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:32.720 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:39.400 

Oh<00:01:32.800> stuck<00:01:33.800> to<00:01:33.950> the<00:01:34.070> plate<00:01:35.260> there<00:01:36.260> we<00:01:36.440> go<00:01:38.410> and

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:39.410 
Oh stuck to the plate there we go and

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:41.650 
Oh stuck to the plate there we go and
we've<00:01:39.590> successfully<00:01:39.980> picked<00:01:40.850> up<00:01:41.030> an<00:01:41.240> ice<00:01:41.420> cube

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
we've successfully picked up an ice cube

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:47.950 
we've successfully picked up an ice cube
with<00:01:42.050> a<00:01:42.080> piece<00:01:42.290> of<00:01:42.320> string<00:01:46.420> the<00:01:47.420> reason<00:01:47.690> we<00:01:47.780> can

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:47.960 
with a piece of string the reason we can

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.840 
with a piece of string the reason we can
pick<00:01:48.110> up<00:01:48.230> our<00:01:48.470> ice<00:01:48.800> cube<00:01:49.100> with<00:01:49.430> a<00:01:49.640> piece<00:01:49.820> of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:49.850 
pick up our ice cube with a piece of

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.870 
pick up our ice cube with a piece of
string<00:01:50.260> is<00:01:51.260> it's<00:01:51.740> an<00:01:52.240> endothermic<00:01:53.240> reaction

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:54.880 
string is it's an endothermic reaction

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.050 
string is it's an endothermic reaction
meaning<00:01:55.880> that<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:56.840> salt<00:01:57.680> takes<00:01:58.430> heat<00:01:58.760> from

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
meaning that the salt takes heat from

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.330 
meaning that the salt takes heat from
its<00:01:59.300> surroundings<00:01:59.930> and<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:01.670> it<00:02:02.720> um<00:02:03.220> like<00:02:04.220> the

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:04.340 
its surroundings and it it um like the

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.550 
its surroundings and it it um like the
string<00:02:04.670> the<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.750> salt<00:02:05.990> will<00:02:06.110> take<00:02:06.290> the<00:02:06.410> heat

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
string the the salt will take the heat

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:09.220 
string the the salt will take the heat
from<00:02:06.710> the<00:02:06.860> string<00:02:07.220> of<00:02:07.610> the<00:02:08.149> wet<00:02:08.390> spring<00:02:08.690> that's

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:09.230 
from the string of the wet spring that's

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:11.470 
from the string of the wet spring that's
because<00:02:09.500> we've<00:02:09.679> wetted<00:02:09.980> it<00:02:10.100> so<00:02:10.970> now<00:02:11.030> this<00:02:11.240> room

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
because we've wetted it so now this room

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.780 
because we've wetted it so now this room
is<00:02:11.510> wet<00:02:11.750> so<00:02:12.200> in<00:02:12.320> that<00:02:12.440> it's<00:02:12.590> wet<00:02:12.860> it<00:02:13.220> loses<00:02:13.610> heat

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:13.790 
is wet so in that it's wet it loses heat

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.970 
is wet so in that it's wet it loses heat
and<00:02:13.970> then<00:02:14.060> it<00:02:14.150> starts<00:02:14.450> to<00:02:14.510> freeze<00:02:14.870> so<00:02:15.800> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and then it starts to freeze so the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.290 
and then it starts to freeze so the
string<00:02:16.280> starts<00:02:16.400> to<00:02:16.640> freeze<00:02:16.910> because<00:02:17.090> those

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:17.300 
string starts to freeze because those

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.710 
string starts to freeze because those
water<00:02:17.660> in<00:02:17.900> it<00:02:18.050> it'll<00:02:18.350> stick<00:02:18.770> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.920> ice<00:02:19.130> cube

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
water in it it'll stick to the ice cube

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.690 
water in it it'll stick to the ice cube
and<00:02:20.720> that<00:02:20.780> is<00:02:21.110> why<00:02:21.230> we<00:02:21.380> can<00:02:21.530> pick<00:02:21.680> up<00:02:21.830> our<00:02:22.490> ice

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
and that is why we can pick up our ice

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.730 
and that is why we can pick up our ice
cube<00:02:22.940> with<00:02:23.060> a<00:02:23.090> piece<00:02:23.270> of<00:02:23.300> string<00:02:23.560> stay<00:02:24.560> to<00:02:24.620> your

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:24.740 
cube with a piece of string stay to your

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:26.710 
cube with a piece of string stay to your
net<00:02:24.980> next<00:02:25.430> week<00:02:25.700> when<00:02:25.880> I'm<00:02:26.000> going<00:02:26.240> to<00:02:26.300> make<00:02:26.510> a
