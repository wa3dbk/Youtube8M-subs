guys it is time once again to revisit a
beautiful<00:00:05.370> car<00:00:05.549> but<00:00:05.759> this<00:00:05.910> time<00:00:06.150> we're<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.569> the

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
beautiful car but this time we're in the

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.870 
beautiful car but this time we're in the
Perth<00:00:07.049> tuna<00:00:07.620> the<00:00:08.099> first<00:00:08.460> time<00:00:08.730> I've<00:00:08.820> actually

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:08.880 
Perth tuna the first time I've actually

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.600 
Perth tuna the first time I've actually
bought<00:00:09.330> this<00:00:09.510> car<00:00:09.809> in<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.320> game<00:00:10.559> it's<00:00:11.370> the

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
bought this car in the game it's the

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.190 
bought this car in the game it's the
Ford<00:00:11.849> GT<00:00:12.210> I<00:00:12.240> mean<00:00:12.630> you<00:00:12.929> should<00:00:13.049> probably

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
Ford GT I mean you should probably

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.480 
Ford GT I mean you should probably
already<00:00:13.380> know<00:00:13.620> that<00:00:13.799> so<00:00:14.070> let's<00:00:14.099> see<00:00:14.309> what

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
already know that so let's see what

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.010 
already know that so let's see what
happens<00:00:14.759> when<00:00:14.969> we<00:00:15.150> upgrade<00:00:15.299> this<00:00:15.599> thing<00:00:15.809> to

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
happens when we upgrade this thing to

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.950 
happens when we upgrade this thing to
this<00:00:16.260> Strauss<00:00:17.190> is<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.520> circuit<00:00:17.910> spec<00:00:18.119> man<00:00:18.330> perf

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
this Strauss is a circuit spec man perf

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.099 
this Strauss is a circuit spec man perf
spec<00:00:19.529> that's<00:00:20.430> what<00:00:20.699> we're<00:00:20.850> doing<00:00:21.090> today<00:00:21.180> be

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
spec that's what we're doing today be

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:25.429 
spec that's what we're doing today be
true<00:00:22.500> I<00:00:22.740> want<00:00:23.340> to<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:23.970> how<00:00:24.660> we<00:00:24.720> can<00:00:24.960> customize

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
true I want to see how we can customize

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.170 
true I want to see how we can customize
this<00:00:25.650> thing<00:00:25.859> because<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:26.220> know<00:00:26.279> already<00:00:26.910> what

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
this thing because I know already what

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.480 
this thing because I know already what
it<00:00:27.300> looks<00:00:27.449> like<00:00:27.570> in<00:00:27.750> circuit<00:00:28.170> spec<00:00:28.349> so<00:00:28.590> kind<00:00:29.429> of

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:29.490 
it looks like in circuit spec so kind of

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.310 
it looks like in circuit spec so kind of
makes<00:00:29.699> sense<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:30.119> go<00:00:30.269> in<00:00:30.449> perf<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:31.140> then

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
makes sense to go in perf because then

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.260 
makes sense to go in perf because then
we<00:00:31.470> can<00:00:31.650> customize<00:00:32.399> it<00:00:32.610> and<00:00:32.730> have<00:00:32.910> a<00:00:32.940> little

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
we can customize it and have a little

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.389 
we can customize it and have a little
bit<00:00:33.660> fun<00:00:34.079> what<00:00:34.350> G<00:00:34.469> C's<00:00:34.649> are<00:00:34.770> good<00:00:34.890> in<00:00:34.980> every

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
bit fun what G C's are good in every

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.010 
bit fun what G C's are good in every
color<00:00:35.610> like<00:00:35.850> blue<00:00:36.090> red<00:00:36.480> yellow<00:00:36.809> white

anything anything at all in the Ford GT
will<00:00:39.570> fit<00:00:39.719> in<00:00:39.899> what<00:00:40.559> I'm<00:00:40.620> gonna<00:00:40.710> do<00:00:40.860> is<00:00:41.010> save<00:00:41.309> it

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
will fit in what I'm gonna do is save it

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.190 
will fit in what I'm gonna do is save it
I'm<00:00:41.640> gonna<00:00:41.820> wait<00:00:42.059> and<00:00:42.090> we'll<00:00:42.390> go<00:00:42.480> to<00:00:42.540> the<00:00:42.750> tuner

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
I'm gonna wait and we'll go to the tuner

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.709 
I'm gonna wait and we'll go to the tuner
the<00:00:43.440> HQ<00:00:43.860> even<00:00:44.250> to<00:00:44.670> sort<00:00:44.850> that<00:00:44.940> out<00:00:45.000> after<00:00:45.480> and

those seats are something else what what
is<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.739> uncomfortable<00:00:50.600> are<00:00:51.600> those<00:00:51.780> speakers

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
is that uncomfortable are those speakers

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.990 
is that uncomfortable are those speakers
I<00:00:52.620> don't<00:00:52.829> even<00:00:52.920> know<00:00:53.219> I'm<00:00:53.460> not<00:00:53.640> gonna<00:00:53.760> question

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
I don't even know I'm not gonna question

I don't even know I'm not gonna question
it<00:00:54.270> we're<00:00:54.420> gonna<00:00:54.510> leave<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.870> interior<00:00:55.230> as<00:00:55.350> it

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
it we're gonna leave the interior as it

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.319 
it we're gonna leave the interior as it
is<00:00:55.590> and<00:00:55.860> now<00:00:56.129> it's<00:00:56.309> diam<00:00:56.579> for<00:00:57.000> some<00:00:57.120> actual

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
is and now it's diam for some actual

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.500 
is and now it's diam for some actual
parts<00:00:58.020> to<00:00:58.170> change<00:00:58.500> it's<00:00:59.489> good<00:00:59.760> being<00:01:00.149> back

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
parts to change it's good being back

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.619 
parts to change it's good being back
from<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.899> circuit<00:01:01.350> cars<00:01:01.670> but<00:01:02.670> I<00:01:02.940> do<00:01:03.180> kind<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
from the circuit cars but I do kind of

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.509 
from the circuit cars but I do kind of
miss<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.840> wide<00:01:04.140> body<00:01:04.350> at<00:01:04.589> the<00:01:04.710> same<00:01:04.920> time<00:01:05.220> I

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
miss the wide body at the same time I

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.399 
miss the wide body at the same time I
have<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> say<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.299> best<00:01:06.510> is<00:01:06.840> probably<00:01:07.200> one<00:01:07.380> of

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
have to say the best is probably one of

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.289 
have to say the best is probably one of
the<00:01:07.560> early<00:01:07.860> ones<00:01:08.010> it<00:01:08.640> Leslie<00:01:08.939> quite<00:01:09.119> difficult

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:09.299 
the early ones it Leslie quite difficult

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.880 
the early ones it Leslie quite difficult
because<00:01:09.600> they're<00:01:09.810> a<00:01:09.840> little<00:01:09.990> bit<00:01:10.140> weird<00:01:10.500> but<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
because they're a little bit weird but I

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
wing we got a bigger wing I don't know

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.859 
wing we got a bigger wing I don't know
is<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:03.030> bigger<00:02:04.909> let's<00:02:05.909> let's<00:02:06.149> go<00:02:06.270> back<00:02:06.299> to<00:02:06.720> it

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
is that bigger let's let's go back to it

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.759 
is that bigger let's let's go back to it
you<00:02:07.399> know<00:02:08.399> that's<00:02:08.610> lower<00:02:09.000> but<00:02:09.929> it<00:02:10.050> looks<00:02:10.259> nicer

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
you know that's lower but it looks nicer

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.160 
you know that's lower but it looks nicer
I'm<00:02:11.160> gonna<00:02:11.310> go<00:02:11.430> with<00:02:11.550> that<00:02:11.700> deal<00:02:12.690> with<00:02:13.080> the

I'm gonna go with that deal with the
technically<00:02:13.739> smaller<00:02:14.190> wing<00:02:14.550> what<00:02:15.300> is<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
technically smaller wing what is this is

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.900 
technically smaller wing what is this is
this<00:02:16.290> some<00:02:16.560> voodoo<00:02:16.769> magic<00:02:17.160> girl<00:02:17.550> it's<00:02:17.790> time

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
for some carbon do we got look at the

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.470 
for some carbon do we got look at the
bunny<00:02:19.739> carbon<00:02:20.010> on<00:02:20.099> here<00:02:20.310> are<00:02:21.000> we<00:02:21.090> gonna<00:02:21.209> botany

bunny carbon on here are we gonna botany
carbon<00:02:21.810> on<00:02:21.930> the<00:02:21.959> bonnets<00:02:22.849> no<00:02:23.989> we're<00:02:24.989> not<00:02:26.300> we're

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
carbon on the bonnets no we're not we're

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.660 
carbon on the bonnets no we're not we're
sticking<00:02:27.630> with<00:02:27.750> that<00:02:27.900> I've<00:02:28.280> amazed<00:02:29.280> you<00:02:29.549> of

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
sticking with that I've amazed you of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:31.490 
sticking with that I've amazed you of
and<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.940> have<00:02:30.180> amazed<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.840> how<00:02:31.049> else<00:02:31.230> could<00:02:31.440> we

go I mean this car just needs a normal

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:35.900 
go I mean this car just needs a normal
stripe<00:02:34.380> on<00:02:34.620> it<00:02:34.650> it's<00:02:35.010> it's<00:02:35.370> just<00:02:35.580> one<00:02:35.730> of<00:02:35.819> those

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
stripe on it it's it's just one of those

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:37.520 
stripe on it it's it's just one of those
cars<00:02:36.239> that<00:02:36.420> needs<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.959> we<00:02:37.110> could<00:02:37.230> go<00:02:37.349> with<00:02:37.470> a

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
cars that needs it we could go with a

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.039 
cars that needs it we could go with a
double<00:02:37.890> stripe<00:02:38.250> I<00:02:38.400> quite<00:02:38.700> like<00:02:39.000> that<00:02:39.269> but<00:02:40.019> I

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
double stripe I quite like that but I

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.930 
double stripe I quite like that but I
also<00:02:40.260> like<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.590> single<00:02:41.099> stripe<00:02:41.580> that<00:02:41.760> goes

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
also like the single stripe that goes

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.690 
also like the single stripe that goes
through<00:02:42.299> here<00:02:42.650> that's<00:02:43.650> a<00:02:43.769> hard<00:02:44.010> one<00:02:44.190> I<00:02:44.370> think

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
through here that's a hard one I think

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.930 
through here that's a hard one I think
we'll<00:02:45.030> go<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:45.510> double<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:46.799> screams<00:02:47.579> Ford

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
we'll go with the double it screams Ford

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
odds not having the wide-body the front

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.009 
odds not having the wide-body the front
of<00:03:04.620> it's<00:03:04.739> fine<00:03:05.010> but<00:03:06.000> the<00:03:06.180> rear<00:03:06.390> end<00:03:06.660> looks<00:03:06.780> a

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
of it's fine but the rear end looks a

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.110 
of it's fine but the rear end looks a
little<00:03:07.140> bit<00:03:07.350> different<00:03:07.500> now<00:03:08.069> I<00:03:08.340> want<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:08.880> see

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:09.120 
little bit different now I want to see

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.059 
little bit different now I want to see
how<00:03:09.390> this<00:03:09.630> thing<00:03:09.930> is<00:03:10.140> in<00:03:10.350> the<00:03:10.470> cockpit<00:03:10.709> view

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
how this thing is in the cockpit view

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
all my lord you don't need a circuit

full<00:03:19.650> so<00:03:19.859> go<00:03:19.980> buy<00:03:20.100> baby<00:03:20.340> circuits<00:03:20.700> back<00:03:20.910> anywho

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
full so go buy baby circuits back anywho

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.900 
full so go buy baby circuits back anywho
so<00:03:22.440> let's<00:03:22.620> see<00:03:22.769> how<00:03:22.829> this<00:03:22.950> thing<00:03:23.190> handles<00:03:23.639> it

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:23.910 
so let's see how this thing handles it

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150 
so let's see how this thing handles it
is<00:03:24.269> quite<00:03:24.600> heavy<00:03:24.840> on<00:03:25.079> the<00:03:25.170> force<00:03:25.380> feedback<00:03:25.650> so

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
is quite heavy on the force feedback so

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.460 
is quite heavy on the force feedback so
it<00:03:26.459> feels<00:03:26.940> a<00:03:27.090> bit<00:03:27.120> slow<00:03:27.660> as<00:03:27.870> well<00:03:28.019> because<00:03:28.350> of

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
it feels a bit slow as well because of

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.500 
it feels a bit slow as well because of
the<00:03:28.560> heaviness<00:03:28.829> is<00:03:29.609> this<00:03:29.850> actually<00:03:30.239> a<00:03:30.269> heavy

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
the heaviness is this actually a heavy

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.960 
the heaviness is this actually a heavy
car<00:03:30.750> I<00:03:30.900> never<00:03:31.200> thought<00:03:31.470> it<00:03:31.650> was<00:03:31.859> so<00:03:32.760> that's

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
car I never thought it was so that's

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
English let's learn to English before we

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740 
English let's learn to English before we
actually<00:03:38.250> try<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:38.459> comment<00:03:38.880> it<00:03:39.000> on<00:03:39.030> videos<00:03:39.450> vo

the<00:03:39.989> Mon<00:03:40.139> I<00:03:40.290> this<00:03:40.530> colour<00:03:40.769> is<00:03:40.859> actually

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
the Mon I this colour is actually

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.390 
the Mon I this colour is actually
surprisingly<00:03:41.850> good<00:03:42.090> to<00:03:42.329> drive<00:03:42.660> it's<00:03:43.620> it<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
surprisingly good to drive it's it the

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.330 
surprisingly good to drive it's it the
force<00:03:44.940> feedbacks<00:03:45.389> like<00:03:45.600> probably<00:03:46.290> half<00:03:47.010> as

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:47.340 
force feedbacks like probably half as

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.309 
force feedbacks like probably half as
heavy<00:03:47.549> as<00:03:47.880> say<00:03:48.150> yer<00:03:48.329> or<00:03:48.870> let's<00:03:49.139> do<00:03:49.260> this

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
heavy as say yer or let's do this

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:51.710 
heavy as say yer or let's do this
challenge<00:03:49.560> but<00:03:49.980> half<00:03:50.310> as<00:03:50.459> heavy<00:03:50.609> is<00:03:50.940> like<00:03:51.180> I

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
challenge but half as heavy is like I

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:53.599 
challenge but half as heavy is like I
don't<00:03:51.930> know<00:03:51.989> a<00:03:52.019> Hummer<00:03:52.349> or<00:03:52.470> something<00:03:53.099> it's<00:03:53.459> up

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
don't know a Hummer or something it's up

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:55.879 
don't know a Hummer or something it's up
there<00:03:53.880> feels<00:03:54.510> heavier<00:03:54.870> than<00:03:55.049> the<00:03:55.170> Merc<00:03:55.380> in<00:03:55.739> the

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
there feels heavier than the Merc in the

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.800 
there feels heavier than the Merc in the
wheel<00:03:56.099> itself<00:03:56.609> that's<00:03:56.970> not<00:03:57.209> actually<00:03:57.510> like

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
wheel itself that's not actually like

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:01.400 
wheel itself that's not actually like
play<00:03:58.230> saying<00:03:58.680> how<00:03:59.010> the<00:03:59.069> car<00:03:59.430> moves<00:04:00.389> around<00:04:00.630> I'm

talking<00:04:01.680> about<00:04:01.709> the<00:04:01.859> force<00:04:02.040> feedback<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.430> can

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:02.579 
talking about the force feedback I can

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:04.699 
talking about the force feedback I can
both<00:04:02.790> it<00:04:03.120> just<00:04:03.599> feels<00:04:03.750> heavy<00:04:03.959> okay<00:04:04.350> so<00:04:04.410> if<00:04:04.620> we

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
both it just feels heavy okay so if we

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.990 
both it just feels heavy okay so if we
can<00:04:04.739> actually<00:04:04.949> get<00:04:05.250> Blackmun<00:04:05.729> warmest

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
can actually get Blackmun warmest

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.120 
can actually get Blackmun warmest

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
only somehow what do we got weight

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.870 
only somehow what do we got weight
reduction<00:04:18.650> I<00:04:18.890> think<00:04:19.760> not<00:04:20.360> I<00:04:21.370> would<00:04:22.370> like<00:04:22.640> the

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
reduction I think not I would like the

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.880 
reduction I think not I would like the
weight<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.240> stay<00:04:23.300> on<00:04:23.600> the<00:04:23.750> car<00:04:23.900> that's<00:04:24.500> one

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:24.890 
weight to stay on the car that's one

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:27.370 
weight to stay on the car that's one
thing<00:04:25.130> I'm<00:04:25.250> wondering<00:04:25.610> now<00:04:25.640> if<00:04:26.000> we<00:04:26.840> actually

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:27.380 
thing I'm wondering now if we actually

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:30.160 
thing I'm wondering now if we actually
went<00:04:27.680> to<00:04:27.890> a<00:04:28.120> safe<00:04:29.120> weight<00:04:29.570> reduction<00:04:29.960> on<00:04:30.050> this

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:30.170 
went to a safe weight reduction on this

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:32.230 
went to a safe weight reduction on this
car<00:04:30.380> but<00:04:30.890> it<00:04:31.040> instantly<00:04:31.490> become<00:04:31.820> oh<00:04:31.970> my<00:04:32.090> god

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
car but it instantly become oh my god

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:33.850 
car but it instantly become oh my god
don't<00:04:32.420> hit<00:04:32.510> me<00:04:32.600> don't<00:04:32.720> hit<00:04:32.810> me<00:04:33.020> Oh

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
don't hit me don't hit me Oh

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:35.740 
don't hit me don't hit me Oh
will<00:04:34.340> it<00:04:34.430> instantly<00:04:34.820> become<00:04:35.120> ridiculously

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:35.750 
will it instantly become ridiculously

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.720 
will it instantly become ridiculously
light<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.230> be<00:04:36.380> terrible<00:04:36.800> driving<00:04:37.130> then<00:04:37.520> again

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
light and be terrible driving then again

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:41.170 
light and be terrible driving then again
it<00:04:37.850> does<00:04:38.180> feel<00:04:38.690> heavier<00:04:39.170> than<00:04:39.830> the<00:04:40.010> SLS<00:04:40.520> so<00:04:40.910> I

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
it does feel heavier than the SLS so I

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:43.570 
it does feel heavier than the SLS so I
doubt<00:04:41.570> it<00:04:41.930> I<00:04:42.110> needed<00:04:42.530> a<00:04:42.590> few<00:04:42.800> more<00:04:42.950> calls<00:04:43.280> and

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
doubt it I needed a few more calls and

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.510 
doubt it I needed a few more calls and
cesses<00:04:43.970> out<00:04:44.150> on<00:04:44.360> just<00:04:44.600> to<00:04:44.750> see<00:04:45.020> what<00:04:45.200> it's<00:04:45.350> like

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
cesses out on just to see what it's like

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:48.520 
cesses out on just to see what it's like
because<00:04:46.520> it<00:04:47.030> does<00:04:47.360> feel<00:04:47.690> plunging<00:04:48.290> I'm<00:04:48.410> in

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
because it does feel plunging I'm in

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.800 
because it does feel plunging I'm in
sport<00:04:48.980> mode<00:04:49.040> look<00:04:49.460> this<00:04:49.700> is<00:04:49.880> all<00:04:50.090> the<00:04:50.270> way<00:04:50.420> turn

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:55.130 
the wheel all the way full throttle full

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:57.400 
the wheel all the way full throttle full
throttle<00:04:55.190> and<00:04:55.700> it<00:04:55.820> still<00:04:56.030> comes<00:04:56.300> out<00:04:56.450> of<00:04:56.570> us

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:57.410 
throttle and it still comes out of us

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:00.250 
throttle and it still comes out of us
that's<00:04:57.890> really<00:04:58.490> good<00:04:58.760> okay<00:04:59.210> mostly<00:05:00.080> quite

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:00.260 
that's really good okay mostly quite

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:01.600 
that's really good okay mostly quite
impressed<00:05:00.590> with<00:05:00.680> that<00:05:00.770> I<00:05:00.890> thought<00:05:01.130> that<00:05:01.160> the

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:01.610 
impressed with that I thought that the

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:04.260 
impressed with that I thought that the
car<00:05:02.180> would<00:05:02.330> be<00:05:02.480> quite<00:05:02.750> light<00:05:03.140> and<00:05:03.380> slide<00:05:03.740> a<00:05:03.770> bit

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
car would be quite light and slide a bit

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.960 
car would be quite light and slide a bit
but<00:05:05.270> it<00:05:06.200> doesn't<00:05:06.680> it<00:05:06.830> why<00:05:07.130> those<00:05:07.430> slide<00:05:07.700> but

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:07.970 
but it doesn't it why those slide but

00:05:07.970 --> 00:05:11.230 
but it doesn't it why those slide but
you<00:05:08.090> stay<00:05:08.480> in<00:05:08.630> control<00:05:09.110> of<00:05:09.290> it<00:05:09.940> there<00:05:10.940> are<00:05:11.030> many

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:11.240 
you stay in control of it there are many

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.430 
you stay in control of it there are many
cars<00:05:11.450> to<00:05:11.570> do<00:05:11.720> that<00:05:11.870> on<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.050> crew

we've got no assists on one hard core

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:35.089 
we've got no assists on one hard core
here<00:06:32.669> and<00:06:32.940> it's<00:06:33.720> light<00:06:34.050> if<00:06:34.259> you<00:06:34.379> wanted<00:06:34.650> to<00:06:34.889> but

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
you've still got the control look at how

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.830 
you've still got the control look at how
much<00:06:36.780> that<00:06:36.840> wheels<00:06:37.229> turning<00:06:37.860> ah<00:06:38.599> too<00:06:39.599> much

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:39.840 
much that wheels turning ah too much

00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:42.439 
much that wheels turning ah too much
throttle<00:06:40.110> but<00:06:40.949> you<00:06:41.610> get<00:06:41.789> the<00:06:41.940> idea

00:06:42.439 --> 00:06:42.449 
throttle but you get the idea

this<00:06:43.289> is<00:06:43.470> a<00:06:43.500> bloody<00:06:43.860> brilliant<00:06:44.129> car<00:06:44.520> move<00:06:45.479> and

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:45.930 
this is a bloody brilliant car move and

00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.379 
this is a bloody brilliant car move and
I<00:06:46.050> think<00:06:46.289> I<00:06:46.379> would<00:06:46.530> suggest<00:06:46.680> this<00:06:47.190> over<00:06:47.729> a<00:06:47.970> lot

00:06:48.379 --> 00:06:48.389 
I think I would suggest this over a lot

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:49.909 
I think I would suggest this over a lot
of<00:06:48.509> cars<00:06:48.780> now<00:06:48.900> this<00:06:49.229> is<00:06:49.379> probably<00:06:49.500> one<00:06:49.740> of<00:06:49.770> the

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:49.919 
of cars now this is probably one of the

00:06:49.919 --> 00:06:52.820 
of cars now this is probably one of the
best<00:06:50.129> perk<00:06:50.430> cos<00:06:50.729> I'm<00:06:50.940> actually<00:06:51.120> driven<00:06:51.830> it

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
best perk cos I'm actually driven it

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.040 
best perk cos I'm actually driven it
seems<00:06:53.159> the<00:06:53.370> perf<00:06:53.610> cars<00:06:53.940> are<00:06:54.210> like<00:06:54.509> the<00:06:54.810> best

00:06:55.040 --> 00:06:55.050 
seems the perf cars are like the best

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:58.760 
seems the perf cars are like the best
spec<00:06:56.479> handling<00:06:57.479> wise<00:06:57.659> a<00:06:57.990> lot<00:06:58.050> of<00:06:58.349> them<00:06:58.590> just

00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:58.770 
spec handling wise a lot of them just

spec handling wise a lot of them just
feel<00:06:58.949> amazing<00:06:59.789> and<00:06:59.879> this<00:07:00.060> just<00:07:00.360> lets<00:07:00.719> just
