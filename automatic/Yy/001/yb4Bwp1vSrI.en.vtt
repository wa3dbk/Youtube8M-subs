00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
and it went to Claudia well I think you

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.020 
and it went to Claudia well I think you
know<00:02:34.680> your<00:02:34.709> Foreman<00:02:35.520> is<00:02:35.670> a<00:02:35.700> junior

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
know your Foreman is a junior

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.320 
know your Foreman is a junior
middleweight<00:02:36.600> that's<00:02:36.950> another<00:02:37.950> step<00:02:38.580> up<00:02:38.850> he's

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
middleweight that's another step up he's

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.960 
middleweight that's another step up he's
a<00:02:39.360> hundred<00:02:39.840> and<00:02:39.900> fifty<00:02:40.290> four<00:02:40.560> pounds<00:02:41.130> and<00:02:41.430> he's

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
a hundred and fifty four pounds and he's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.910 
a hundred and fifty four pounds and he's
almost<00:02:42.209> 6<00:02:42.600> feet<00:02:42.690> all<00:02:43.489> and<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.730> think<00:02:45.209> that<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
almost 6 feet all and I think that that

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.430 
almost 6 feet all and I think that that

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
it would be better if he fought a

it would be better if he fought a
welterweight<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:52.560> know<00:02:52.680> rather<00:02:52.950> than<00:02:53.160> a

00:02:53.509 --> 00:02:53.519 
welterweight you know rather than a

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.280

negotiations went incredibly fast then
well<00:03:23.370> I<00:03:23.400> think<00:03:23.549> so<00:03:23.970> i<00:03:24.000> think<00:03:24.239> that<00:03:24.630> uh<00:03:24.829> you<00:03:25.829> know

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
well I think so i think that uh you know

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.620 
well I think so i think that uh you know
I<00:03:25.980> don't<00:03:26.310> know<00:03:26.519> if<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.850> contracts<00:03:27.329> are<00:03:27.600> signed

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
I don't know if the contracts are signed

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:31.160 
I don't know if the contracts are signed
yet<00:03:28.470> they've<00:03:28.709> agreed<00:03:29.070> in<00:03:29.280> principle<00:03:29.910> and<00:03:30.170> and

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
yet they've agreed in principle and and

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:32.750 
yet they've agreed in principle and and
just<00:03:31.530> like<00:03:31.709> Bob<00:03:31.950> Arum<00:03:32.250> is<00:03:32.340> agreed<00:03:32.640> in

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
just like Bob Arum is agreed in

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.789 
just like Bob Arum is agreed in
principle<00:03:33.359> with<00:03:33.540> the<00:03:33.780> Jerry<00:03:34.049> Jones<00:03:34.350> the<00:03:34.620> owner

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
principle with the Jerry Jones the owner

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.960 
principle with the Jerry Jones the owner
of<00:03:34.950> the<00:03:35.130> Dallas<00:03:35.280> Cowboys<00:03:36.000> uh<00:03:37.100> Bob<00:03:38.100> watched<00:03:38.609> the

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
of the Dallas Cowboys uh Bob watched the

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:44.820 
game is the the playoff game against the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.990 
game is the the playoff game against the
philadelphia<00:03:45.450> eagles<00:03:45.540> in<00:03:46.140> jerry<00:03:46.500> jones<00:03:47.000> box

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
philadelphia eagles in jerry jones box

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.150 
philadelphia eagles in jerry jones box
and<00:03:48.480> they<00:03:48.570> had<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.750> good<00:03:48.959> time<00:03:49.230> together<00:03:49.470> and

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:50.160 
and they had a good time together and

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.130 
and they had a good time together and
that<00:03:50.400> was<00:03:50.579> Saturday<00:03:51.150> and<00:03:51.299> then<00:03:51.450> Sunday<00:03:51.510> I

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
that was Saturday and then Sunday I

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.699 
that was Saturday and then Sunday I
think<00:03:52.680> they<00:03:52.829> ironed<00:03:53.040> out<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.489> details<00:03:53.940> and

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:54.709 
think they ironed out the details and

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:58.250 
think they ironed out the details and
I'm<00:03:55.709> sure<00:03:56.310> that<00:03:56.340> the<00:03:56.819> contracts<00:03:57.510> have<00:03:57.959> not

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
I'm sure that the contracts have not

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.890 
I'm sure that the contracts have not
been<00:03:58.470> completed<00:03:58.920> and<00:03:59.069> signed<00:03:59.459> but<00:03:59.790> but<00:04:00.359> they

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
been completed and signed but but they

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:02.479 
been completed and signed but but they
have<00:04:01.079> it<00:04:01.200> again<00:04:01.590> have<00:04:01.829> an<00:04:01.950> agreement<00:04:02.190> in

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
have it again have an agreement in

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:04.490 
have it again have an agreement in
principle<00:04:02.670> I<00:04:03.180> expect<00:04:03.600> they'll<00:04:03.750> make<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.959> formal

00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:04.500 
principle I expect they'll make a formal

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.650 
principle I expect they'll make a formal
