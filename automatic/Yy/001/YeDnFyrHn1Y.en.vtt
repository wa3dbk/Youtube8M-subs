Chrissy Lea is annoying but I know it's
not<00:01:29.340> nearly<00:01:29.579> as<00:01:29.700> threatening<00:01:30.030> after<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.450> told

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
not nearly as threatening after I told

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.080 
not nearly as threatening after I told
it<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.110> I<00:01:31.140> decided<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.650> taunt<00:01:31.920> it<00:01:32.070> and<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.939> does

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
it so I decided to taunt it and he does

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.030 
it so I decided to taunt it and he does
try<00:01:33.299> to<00:01:33.360> go<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.689> call<00:01:33.930> mind<00:01:34.200> so<00:01:34.860> it's<00:01:35.009> a

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
try to go for the call mind so it's a

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.010 
try to go for the call mind so it's a
good<00:01:35.159> thing<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:35.369> decided<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.759> taunt<00:01:35.909> it<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.750> I<00:01:36.780> go

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
good thing I decided to taunt it so I go

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:38.300 
good thing I decided to taunt it so I go
for<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.259> second<00:01:37.530> dragon<00:01:37.710> dance<00:01:38.040> I<00:01:38.130> don't

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
for the second dragon dance I don't

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:39.890 
for the second dragon dance I don't
think<00:01:38.520> he<00:01:38.640> can<00:01:38.790> do<00:01:38.909> a<00:01:38.939> whole<00:01:39.150> lot<00:01:39.210> to<00:01:39.420> me<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.810> know

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
think he can do a whole lot to me I know

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.980 
think he can do a whole lot to me I know
his<00:01:40.170> to<00:01:40.350> attack<00:01:40.650> moves<00:01:40.950> or<00:01:41.850> probably<00:01:42.299> psychic

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
his to attack moves or probably psychic

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.300 
his to attack moves or probably psychic
and<00:01:43.140> some<00:01:43.380> other<00:01:43.530> thing<00:01:43.799> I'm<00:01:43.979> just<00:01:44.009> hoping

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:44.310 
and some other thing I'm just hoping

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:46.100 
and some other thing I'm just hoping
it's<00:01:44.460> not<00:01:44.490> thunderbolt<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.450> he<00:01:45.720> has<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.990> ice

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it's not thunderbolt and he has the ice

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.109 
it's not thunderbolt and he has the ice
beam<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:46.950> I<00:01:46.979> know<00:01:47.100> it's<00:01:47.340> not<00:01:47.399> the<00:01:47.640> Thunderbolt

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
beam so I know it's not the Thunderbolt

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.039 
beam so I know it's not the Thunderbolt
and<00:01:48.240> that's<00:01:48.390> pretty<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:48.869> that's<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.560> good

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
and that's pretty and that's pretty good

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.800 
and that's pretty and that's pretty good
so<00:01:52.520> about<00:01:53.520> Thunder<00:01:54.090> she's<00:01:54.420> going<00:01:54.600> for<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> ice

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
so about Thunder she's going for the ice

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.090 
so about Thunder she's going for the ice
beam<00:01:55.049> instead<00:01:55.200> of<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.439> psychic<00:01:55.799> because<00:01:55.920> he's

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
beam instead of the psychic because he's

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.469 
beam instead of the psychic because he's
hoping<00:01:56.310> for<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.520> freeze<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.119> is<00:01:57.210> kind<00:01:57.420> of

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
hoping for the freeze which is kind of

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:58.910 
hoping for the freeze which is kind of
lame<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.079> don't<00:01:58.290> really<00:01:58.439> blame<00:01:58.740> him

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
lame but I don't really blame him

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:00.530 
lame but I don't really blame him
because<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.579> is<00:01:59.820> pretty<00:02:00.030> much<00:02:00.149> his<00:02:00.299> best

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
because that is pretty much his best

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:02.630 
because that is pretty much his best
chance<00:02:00.899> to<00:02:01.140> be<00:02:01.350> able<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.619> take<00:02:01.890> down<00:02:01.920> Gyarados

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
chance to be able to take down Gyarados

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.090 
chance to be able to take down Gyarados
so<00:02:03.450> I<00:02:03.840> just<00:02:03.990> keep<00:02:04.140> going<00:02:04.290> for<00:02:04.560> the<00:02:04.649> waterfall

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
so I just keep going for the waterfall

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.740 
so I just keep going for the waterfall
unfortunately<00:02:05.729> for<00:02:05.909> me<00:02:06.000> the<00:02:06.030> waterfall<00:02:06.509> looks

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
unfortunately for me the waterfall looks

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.619 
unfortunately for me the waterfall looks
to<00:02:06.869> be<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> three<00:02:07.320> hit<00:02:07.469> ko<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.520> I'm<00:02:08.759> not<00:02:09.300> going<00:02:09.539> to

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
Christie Lea now with waterfall and

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:27.080 
Christie Lea now with waterfall and
that's<00:02:25.689> going<00:02:25.900> to<00:02:25.989> be<00:02:26.110> able<00:02:26.349> to<00:02:26.470> take<00:02:26.739> it<00:02:26.860> out

that's going to be able to take it out

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.930 
that's going to be able to take it out
so<00:02:28.090> he<00:02:28.690> goes<00:02:28.900> into<00:02:29.170> Salamence<00:02:30.010> not<00:02:30.459> knowing

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
so he goes into Salamence not knowing

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.890 
so he goes into Salamence not knowing
the<00:02:31.599> second<00:02:31.900> move<00:02:32.019> I<00:02:32.200> carry<00:02:32.440> on<00:02:32.590> Gyarados<00:02:33.099> and

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
the second move I carry on Gyarados and

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.149 
the second move I carry on Gyarados and
unfortunately<00:02:34.900> for<00:02:34.989> him<00:02:35.200> I<00:02:35.470> do<00:02:35.530> carry<00:02:35.980> the

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:36.159 
unfortunately for him I do carry the

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.050 
unfortunately for him I do carry the
stone<00:02:36.400> edge<00:02:36.579> now<00:02:37.859> really<00:02:38.859> the<00:02:38.980> only<00:02:39.099> three

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
stone edge now really the only three

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.330 
stone edge now really the only three
moves<00:02:40.299> it<00:02:40.450> can<00:02:40.599> be<00:02:40.750> a<00:02:40.780> stone<00:02:41.109> edge<00:02:41.340> earthquake

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
moves it can be a stone edge earthquake

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.819 
moves it can be a stone edge earthquake
and<00:02:42.549> ice<00:02:42.670> Fang<00:02:43.290> not<00:02:44.290> many<00:02:44.440> people<00:02:44.680> run

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:44.829 
and ice Fang not many people run

00:02:44.829 --> 00:02:46.530 
and ice Fang not many people run
earthquake<00:02:45.159> anymore<00:02:45.549> so<00:02:45.940> I<00:02:46.180> really<00:02:46.420> don't

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
earthquake anymore so I really don't

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.089 
earthquake anymore so I really don't
know<00:02:46.629> what<00:02:46.720> he's<00:02:46.870> hoping<00:02:46.989> for<00:02:47.140> they're<00:02:47.500> just

00:02:48.089 --> 00:02:48.099 
know what he's hoping for they're just

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.800 
know what he's hoping for they're just
attempt<00:02:48.430> next<00:02:48.700> time<00:02:48.849> it's<00:02:49.239> either<00:02:49.420> ice<00:02:49.540> Fang

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
attempt next time it's either ice Fang

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:51.420 
attempt next time it's either ice Fang
or<00:02:50.019> stone<00:02:50.230> edge<00:02:50.409> I<00:02:50.680> wouldn't<00:02:51.099> send<00:02:51.250> out<00:02:51.400> a

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
or stone edge I wouldn't send out a

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.119 
or stone edge I wouldn't send out a
Salamence<00:02:52.000> against<00:02:52.359> either<00:02:52.480> so<00:02:53.349> Salamence

00:02:54.119 --> 00:02:54.129 
Salamence against either so Salamence

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:55.860 
Salamence against either so Salamence
goes<00:02:54.280> down<00:02:54.519> he<00:02:54.819> goes<00:02:54.970> out<00:02:55.150> into<00:02:55.269> a<00:02:55.359> Tentacruel

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
goes down he goes out into a Tentacruel

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.259 
goes down he goes out into a Tentacruel
which<00:02:56.379> is<00:02:56.590> um<00:02:56.799> kind<00:02:57.519> of<00:02:57.639> annoying<00:02:57.909> since<00:02:58.180> I

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
which is um kind of annoying since I

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.270 
which is um kind of annoying since I
can't<00:02:58.810> super<00:02:59.109> effective<00:02:59.530> it<00:02:59.650> and<00:02:59.859> stone<00:03:00.129> edge

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
can't super effective it and stone edge

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.699 
can't super effective it and stone edge
I<00:03:00.430> don't<00:03:00.670> think<00:03:00.879> will<00:03:01.000> ko<00:03:01.180> out<00:03:01.560> even<00:03:02.560> though

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:02.709 
I don't think will ko out even though

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.140 
I don't think will ko out even though
Tentacruel<00:03:03.250> doesn't<00:03:03.549> have<00:03:03.639> great<00:03:03.970> defense

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
Tentacruel doesn't have great defense

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.449 
Tentacruel doesn't have great defense
he's<00:03:04.569> only<00:03:04.720> a<00:03:04.810> great<00:03:05.019> special<00:03:05.470> wall<00:03:05.650> but<00:03:06.430> I

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:06.459 
he's only a great special wall but I

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:08.220 
he's only a great special wall but I
don't<00:03:06.849> quite<00:03:07.000> kill<00:03:07.209> it<00:03:07.359> he<00:03:07.480> sludge<00:03:07.720> bombs<00:03:07.989> me

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
don't quite kill it he sludge bombs me

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.309 
don't quite kill it he sludge bombs me
and<00:03:08.500> gets<00:03:08.980> a<00:03:09.099> poison<00:03:09.430> hax<00:03:09.639> and<00:03:10.000> that's<00:03:10.840> not<00:03:11.049> too

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
and gets a poison hax and that's not too

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:11.819 
and gets a poison hax and that's not too
great

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:11.829 
great

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:14.309 
great
because<00:03:12.220> Gyarados<00:03:13.030> being<00:03:13.239> poisoned<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.870> a<00:03:13.900> bad

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:14.319 
because Gyarados being poisoned is a bad

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.680 
because Gyarados being poisoned is a bad
thing<00:03:14.590> obviously<00:03:14.829> and<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:16.329> means<00:03:16.510> he's

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:16.690 
thing obviously and that means he's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.539 
thing obviously and that means he's
probably<00:03:16.959> going<00:03:17.319> to<00:03:17.410> be<00:03:17.560> able<00:03:17.680> to<00:03:17.829> wall<00:03:18.280> out<00:03:18.430> my

00:03:18.539 --> 00:03:18.549 
probably going to be able to wall out my

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:20.729 
probably going to be able to wall out my
Gyarados<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.449> KO<00:03:19.660> eventually<00:03:20.290> but<00:03:20.500> i<00:03:20.560> am

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
Gyarados for the KO eventually but i am

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:21.960 
Gyarados for the KO eventually but i am
going<00:03:20.980> to<00:03:21.010> be<00:03:21.280> able<00:03:21.370> to<00:03:21.519> take<00:03:21.699> out<00:03:21.849> his

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
going to be able to take out his

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:23.909 
going to be able to take out his
tentacle<00:03:22.510> in<00:03:22.629> the<00:03:22.720> meantime<00:03:22.930> with<00:03:23.440> waterfall

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:23.919 
tentacle in the meantime with waterfall

00:03:23.919 --> 00:03:27.720 
tentacle in the meantime with waterfall
and<00:03:24.190> that's<00:03:25.000> pretty<00:03:25.239> nifty<00:03:25.709> and<00:03:26.769> poison<00:03:27.489> is

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
and that's pretty nifty and poison is

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.520 
and that's pretty nifty and poison is
starting<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.329> rack<00:03:28.510> up<00:03:28.540> some<00:03:28.750> damage<00:03:29.199> I<00:03:29.379> mean

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530 
starting to rack up some damage I mean

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.890 
starting to rack up some damage I mean
basically<00:03:30.099> I'm<00:03:30.459> losing<00:03:30.819> 1/16<00:03:31.419> of<00:03:31.569> my<00:03:31.660> health

00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:31.900 
basically I'm losing 1/16 of my health

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:33.830 
basically I'm losing 1/16 of my health
every<00:03:32.230> turn<00:03:32.410> now<00:03:32.620> instead<00:03:32.859> of<00:03:32.949> gaining<00:03:33.160> it

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
every turn now instead of gaining it

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.289 
every turn now instead of gaining it
because<00:03:34.840> the<00:03:35.410> leftovers<00:03:36.160> heals<00:03:36.370> 1/16<00:03:37.030> and

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 
because the leftovers heals 1/16 and

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.379 
because the leftovers heals 1/16 and
then<00:03:37.569> the<00:03:37.810> poison<00:03:38.199> takes<00:03:38.319> 1/8<00:03:38.739> so<00:03:39.609> I<00:03:39.970> go<00:03:40.239> for

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:40.389 
then the poison takes 1/8 so I go for

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:41.909 
then the poison takes 1/8 so I go for
the<00:03:40.449> waterfall<00:03:40.840> on<00:03:40.870> Gliscor<00:03:41.440> it's<00:03:41.650> super

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:41.919 
the waterfall on Gliscor it's super

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.339 
the waterfall on Gliscor it's super
effective<00:03:42.099> and<00:03:42.519> I<00:03:42.549> still<00:03:42.849> have<00:03:43.060> +1<00:03:43.629> attack<00:03:43.870> due

00:03:44.339 --> 00:03:44.349 
effective and I still have +1 attack due

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:46.170 
effective and I still have +1 attack due
to<00:03:44.379> the<00:03:44.739> dragon<00:03:45.129> dance<00:03:45.310> and<00:03:45.699> that's<00:03:46.060> gonna

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.180 
to the dragon dance and that's gonna

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:47.550 
to the dragon dance and that's gonna
take<00:03:46.389> out<00:03:46.510> the<00:03:46.629> Gliscor<00:03:47.019> which<00:03:47.199> is<00:03:47.319> really

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560 
take out the Gliscor which is really

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:50.309 
take out the Gliscor which is really
good<00:03:47.709> for<00:03:47.889> me<00:03:48.010> and<00:03:49.000> poison<00:03:49.480> will<00:03:49.870> kill<00:03:49.900> me<00:03:50.199> in

00:03:50.309 --> 00:03:50.319 
good for me and poison will kill me in

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:52.650 
good for me and poison will kill me in
one<00:03:50.349> more<00:03:50.650> turn<00:03:50.889> so<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.340> pretty<00:03:52.269> much<00:03:52.359> death

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
one more turn so I pretty much death

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:56.129 
one more turn so I pretty much death
fodders<00:03:52.989> his<00:03:53.290> is<00:03:54.269> what's<00:03:55.269> called<00:03:55.659> smeargle

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
fodders his is what's called smeargle

00:03:56.139 --> 00:03:59.069 
fodders his is what's called smeargle
and<00:03:56.579> that's<00:03:57.579> going<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.419> take<00:03:58.659> out<00:03:58.780> the<00:03:58.870> smear

00:03:59.069 --> 00:03:59.079 
and that's going to take out the smear

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:01.379 
and that's going to take out the smear
goal<00:03:59.260> and<00:03:59.500> that<00:03:59.680> also<00:03:59.799> takes<00:04:00.069> out<00:04:00.190> Gyarados<00:04:00.669> so

00:04:01.379 --> 00:04:01.389 
goal and that also takes out Gyarados so

00:04:01.389 --> 00:04:03.720 
goal and that also takes out Gyarados so
he's<00:04:01.540> down<00:04:01.690> to<00:04:01.959> one<00:04:02.290> last<00:04:02.530> Pokemon<00:04:03.159> one<00:04:03.459> last

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
he's down to one last Pokemon one last

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:05.399 
he's down to one last Pokemon one last
guy<00:04:04.030> he<00:04:04.239> kind<00:04:04.449> of<00:04:04.480> has<00:04:04.629> to<00:04:04.810> hope<00:04:04.959> will<00:04:05.139> win<00:04:05.290> it

00:04:05.399 --> 00:04:05.409 
guy he kind of has to hope will win it

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:08.490 
guy he kind of has to hope will win it
for<00:04:05.620> him<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:06.579> it<00:04:07.540> happens<00:04:07.870> to<00:04:07.930> be<00:04:07.959> a<00:04:08.049> he<00:04:08.260> train

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
for him and it happens to be a he train

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.930 
for him and it happens to be a he train
which<00:04:08.680> kind<00:04:09.040> of<00:04:09.099> sucks<00:04:09.340> because<00:04:09.489> I<00:04:09.669> went<00:04:09.849> into

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:09.940 
which kind of sucks because I went into

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.369 
which kind of sucks because I went into
scizor<00:04:10.359> because<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.780> figured<00:04:11.019> I<00:04:11.079> could<00:04:11.109> you

00:04:11.369 --> 00:04:11.379 
scizor because I figured I could you

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:14.099 
scizor because I figured I could you
turn<00:04:11.530> against<00:04:11.859> anything<00:04:12.099> but<00:04:13.030> uh<00:04:13.060> I<00:04:13.599> guess<00:04:13.959> the

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
turn against anything but uh I guess the

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.020 
turn against anything but uh I guess the
heat<00:04:14.260> ran<00:04:14.470> so<00:04:15.190> I'm<00:04:15.459> just<00:04:15.729> going<00:04:15.879> to<00:04:15.909> switch

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
heat ran so I'm just going to switch

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.399 
heat ran so I'm just going to switch
because<00:04:16.419> I<00:04:16.539> don't<00:04:16.690> want<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.870> risk<00:04:17.019> getting<00:04:17.229> a

00:04:17.399 --> 00:04:17.409 
because I don't want to risk getting a

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.009 
because I don't want to risk getting a
fire-type<00:04:18.310> move<00:04:18.549> on<00:04:18.789> me<00:04:18.969> so<00:04:19.479> I<00:04:19.510> go<00:04:19.659> in<00:04:19.750> my<00:04:19.870> own

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
fire-type move on me so I go in my own

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.420 
fire-type move on me so I go in my own
heat<00:04:20.200> ran<00:04:20.380> hoping<00:04:20.769> he'd<00:04:20.919> go<00:04:21.039> for<00:04:21.070> the<00:04:21.250> fire

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
heat ran hoping he'd go for the fire

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:22.740 
heat ran hoping he'd go for the fire
type<00:04:21.700> move<00:04:21.880> but<00:04:22.120> he<00:04:22.180> said<00:04:22.330> he<00:04:22.389> goes<00:04:22.510> for<00:04:22.659> the

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
type move but he said he goes for the

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:23.910 
type move but he said he goes for the
sub

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:23.920 
sub

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.220 
sub
and<00:04:24.010> this<00:04:24.610> is<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.880> really<00:04:25.510> strange<00:04:25.840> Heatran

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
and this is a really strange Heatran

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.080 
and this is a really strange Heatran
that<00:04:26.500> he<00:04:26.590> says<00:04:26.770> it's<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.040> really<00:04:27.400> cool<00:04:27.580> sweeper

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:28.090 
that he says it's a really cool sweeper

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:30.780 
that he says it's a really cool sweeper
that<00:04:28.660> he<00:04:28.780> runs<00:04:29.050> a<00:04:29.260> lot<00:04:29.440> and<00:04:29.680> he<00:04:29.920> basically<00:04:30.220> was

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
that he runs a lot and he basically was

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.670 
that he runs a lot and he basically was
trying<00:04:31.120> to<00:04:31.240> put<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.810> agility<00:04:32.170> onto<00:04:32.530> this

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
trying to put the agility onto this

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.290 
trying to put the agility onto this
thing<00:04:32.860> in<00:04:32.980> the<00:04:33.040> beginning<00:04:33.130> and<00:04:33.610> it<00:04:34.180> just

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
thing in the beginning and it just

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.210 
thing in the beginning and it just
basically<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.870> really<00:04:35.200> powerful<00:04:35.500> Heatran

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 
basically a really powerful Heatran

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:38.970 
basically a really powerful Heatran
sweeper<00:04:36.730> with<00:04:36.910> life<00:04:37.150> orb<00:04:37.390> so<00:04:38.110> I<00:04:38.140> use<00:04:38.500> earth

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980
