00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:06.070 
for a long time because it'll take a few

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.830 
for a long time because it'll take a few
years<00:01:06.400> to<00:01:06.520> pay<00:01:06.790> back<00:01:07.030> the<00:01:07.210> investment<00:01:07.300> but

this can be done on the fly even when

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:31.920 
this can be done on the fly even when
traveling<00:03:28.810> down<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:29.110> freeway<00:03:30.750> so<00:03:31.750> we're

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
traveling down the freeway so we're

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.750 
traveling down the freeway so we're
gonna<00:03:32.050> run<00:03:32.350> it<00:03:32.620> when<00:03:32.890> I<00:03:32.920> start<00:03:33.310> this<00:03:33.520> it's

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
gonna run it when I start this it's

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.670 
gonna run it when I start this it's
gonna<00:03:33.850> start<00:03:34.180> a<00:03:34.270> gasoline<00:03:34.930> yeah<00:03:35.350> it's<00:03:35.530> going

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:35.680 
gonna start a gasoline yeah it's going

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.710 
gonna start a gasoline yeah it's going
to<00:03:35.770> start<00:03:36.010> on<00:03:36.100> gasoline<00:03:36.310> until<00:03:37.210> it<00:03:37.330> gets<00:03:37.510> up<00:03:37.660> to

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
to start on gasoline until it gets up to

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.050 
to start on gasoline until it gets up to
operational<00:03:38.560> temperature<00:03:41.310> that's<00:03:42.310> off<00:03:42.580> gets

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
operational temperature that's off gets

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.760 
operational temperature that's off gets
off<00:03:43.270> and<00:03:43.540> it's<00:03:43.630> running<00:03:43.959> on<00:03:44.050> gasoline<00:03:44.320> right

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:44.770 
off and it's running on gasoline right

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:46.470 
off and it's running on gasoline right
now<00:03:44.920> and<00:03:45.220> that's<00:03:45.550> what<00:03:45.820> that<00:03:45.970> little<00:03:46.120> orange

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
now and that's what that little orange

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.120 
now and that's what that little orange
lights<00:03:46.720> indicating<00:03:47.320> that<00:03:47.350> the<00:03:47.530> systems<00:03:47.920> off

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.130 
lights indicating that the systems off

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.220 
lights indicating that the systems off
so<00:03:48.580> basically<00:03:48.730> on<00:03:49.180> these<00:03:49.330> biofuel<00:03:49.840> systems

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
so basically on these biofuel systems

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.930 
so basically on these biofuel systems
all<00:03:50.440> we're<00:03:50.590> really<00:03:50.620> doing<00:03:51.130> is<00:03:51.250> adding<00:03:51.280> a<00:03:51.730> whole

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
all we're really doing is adding a whole

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.000 
all we're really doing is adding a whole
other<00:03:52.120> fuel<00:03:52.480> system<00:03:52.900> on<00:03:53.020> top<00:03:53.230> but<00:03:53.709> I<00:03:53.770> don't

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:54.010 
other fuel system on top but I don't

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.010 
other fuel system on top but I don't
want<00:03:54.190> to<00:03:54.280> touch<00:03:54.490> or<00:03:54.790> tamper<00:03:55.330> the<00:03:55.360> feel<00:03:55.660> of<00:03:55.690> the

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
want to touch or tamper the feel of the

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:58.230 
want to touch or tamper the feel of the
original<00:03:56.620> fuel<00:03:56.860> system<00:03:57.220> vehicle<00:03:57.580> is<00:03:57.670> expected

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:58.240 
original fuel system vehicle is expected

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:01.530 
original fuel system vehicle is expected
to<00:03:58.330> get<00:03:58.450> the<00:03:58.600> same<00:03:58.810> amount<00:03:59.050> of<00:03:59.200> mileage<00:04:00.540> per

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:01.540 
to get the same amount of mileage per

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.960 
to get the same amount of mileage per
gas<00:04:01.780> gallon<00:04:02.260> equivalent<00:04:02.560> on<00:04:03.040> natural<00:04:03.490> gas<00:04:03.670> as
