00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:10.450
 Lets put 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:14.860
 two cups approximately 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:18.490
 of bean already cooked just like this we go 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:22.330
 to calculate here the detail is to make a 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:26.009
 bean sauce so that we're going to 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.700
 be using cooked beans 

00:00:26.009 --> 00:00:29.700
 preferably drain what 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.870
 finish 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.020
 ezkurra no and finally you say this 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:42.270
 It requires a little broth 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.020
 put the necessary calcium to make 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.780
 a sauce remember that the bean 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:50.270
 forgiveness is much 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.760
 it has a lot of consistency so you have to 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:55.120
 put enough the caldito let's 

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.120
 put 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.980
 preferably that it stays like this 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.610
 now we put some oil we are going to 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.860
 put it to khan 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:24.550
 because this sauce we have to laugh is 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.490
 a delicious bean sauce goes well 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.380
 flavored and these enchiladas 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 enfrijoladas as I said to them already makes a 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.920
 moment we call them are so easy 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:38.200
 to prepare and in Mexico surely 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:41.680
 you already know that we consume the beans 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.280
 let's put tortillas with little oil 

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:47.710
 do not put too much is little oil I'll 

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:50.619
 to turn off the bean sauce then 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.260
 we put the tortilla inside the sauce 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.659
 bean and 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.120
 A) Yes 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:00.930
 we will take 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:05.340
 thus 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.840
 we put another one back and before putting it 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.760
 about the first one then we doubled 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.560
 just our omelet of this 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:18.890
 shape 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:23.270
 and I'm going to bathe these tickets 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.580
 in this way that is well exalted 

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.580
 they are really delicious 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:34.790
 we can sprinkle cheese
