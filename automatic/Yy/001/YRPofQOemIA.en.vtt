00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
going to randomize a number there'll be

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:06.300 
going to randomize a number there'll be
one<00:03:04.000> lucky<00:03:04.270> comment<00:03:04.930> number<00:03:05.080> which<00:03:05.860> will<00:03:05.890> win

the<00:03:06.490> entire<00:03:06.610> sealed<00:03:07.300> box<00:03:08.520> so<00:03:09.520> let's<00:03:10.180> head<00:03:10.330> over

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
the entire sealed box so let's head over

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.740 
the entire sealed box so let's head over
there<00:03:10.930> what<00:03:11.620> we're<00:03:11.800> going<00:03:11.890> to<00:03:11.980> use<00:03:12.010> is<00:03:12.460> this

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
there what we're going to use is this

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.440 
there what we're going to use is this
random<00:03:13.750> randomizer<00:03:14.410> number<00:03:15.070> here<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:16.000> you<00:03:16.300> can

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
random randomizer number here as you can

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.020 
random randomizer number here as you can
see<00:03:16.720> there<00:03:17.250> so<00:03:18.250> it's<00:03:18.370> going<00:03:18.520> to<00:03:18.580> be<00:03:18.730> really

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
see there so it's going to be really

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:21.570 
see there so it's going to be really
great<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.690> we're<00:03:20.680> going<00:03:20.710> to<00:03:20.830> put<00:03:20.890> the<00:03:21.160> numbers

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:21.580 
great and we're going to put the numbers

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.550 
great and we're going to put the numbers
in<00:03:21.610> so<00:03:22.000> the<00:03:22.150> first<00:03:22.450> comment<00:03:23.050> number<00:03:23.320> is

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:23.560 
in so the first comment number is

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.200 
in so the first comment number is
obviously<00:03:23.890> number<00:03:24.220> one<00:03:24.430> which<00:03:24.670> doesn't<00:03:25.060> need

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:25.210 
obviously number one which doesn't need

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:27.960 
obviously number one which doesn't need
to<00:03:25.330> be<00:03:25.450> changed<00:03:25.750> there<00:03:26.490> followed<00:03:27.490> by<00:03:27.640> the<00:03:27.700> next

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
to be changed there followed by the next

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:31.560 
to be changed there followed by the next
comment<00:03:28.480> number<00:03:28.920> which<00:03:29.920> is<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.910> last<00:03:31.180> one

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:31.570 
comment number which is the last one

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:35.280 
comment number which is the last one
possible<00:03:32.080> which<00:03:32.290> is<00:03:32.850> 720<00:03:33.850> and<00:03:34.110> then<00:03:35.110> we're

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
possible which is 720 and then we're

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:37.680 
possible which is 720 and then we're
going<00:03:35.380> to<00:03:35.440> randomize<00:03:36.040> the<00:03:36.370> number<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:36.910> see

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:37.690 
going to randomize the number and see

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.080 
going to randomize the number and see
who<00:03:37.870> wins<00:03:38.080> the<00:03:38.290> competition<00:03:39.900> so<00:03:40.900> here<00:03:41.470> we<00:03:41.650> go

we're<00:03:43.090> now<00:03:43.270> ready<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.690> randomize<00:03:44.380> that<00:03:44.680> number

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
we're now ready to randomize that number

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.470 
we're now ready to randomize that number
as<00:03:47.110> very<00:03:47.860> there's<00:03:48.220> just<00:03:48.490> one<00:03:48.730> number<00:03:48.970> out<00:03:49.330> of

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:49.480 
as very there's just one number out of

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.580 
as very there's just one number out of
those<00:03:50.040> 1720<00:03:51.040> will<00:03:51.250> be<00:03:51.430> selected<00:03:52.030> so<00:03:52.470> here<00:03:53.470> we
