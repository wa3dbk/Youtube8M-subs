hey there guys so this right here is one

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:17.510 
hey there guys so this right here is one
of<00:00:14.160> those<00:00:14.340> moves<00:00:14.700> that<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:15.470> always<00:00:16.470> take<00:00:17.220> for

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
of those moves that I always take for

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.200 
of those moves that I always take for
granted<00:00:17.760> as<00:00:18.199> something<00:00:19.199> that<00:00:19.699> people<00:00:20.699> need<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
granted as something that people need to

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:22.880 
granted as something that people need to
work<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.660> this<00:00:21.810> is<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.199> is<00:00:22.350> an<00:00:22.470> extension

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
work on this is this is an extension

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.820 
work on this is this is an extension
right<00:00:23.330> and<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.510> reason<00:00:24.689> that<00:00:24.900> I<00:00:25.050> usually<00:00:25.680> take

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
right and the reason that I usually take

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.670 
right and the reason that I usually take
that<00:00:26.070> for<00:00:26.250> granted<00:00:26.279> is<00:00:26.880> because<00:00:27.390> it<00:00:28.199> is<00:00:28.349> such<00:00:28.650> a

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
that for granted is because it is such a

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.009 
that for granted is because it is such a
simple<00:00:29.099> move<00:00:29.369> it<00:00:29.609> literally<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.150> just<00:00:30.179> your

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
simple move it literally is just your

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.069 
simple move it literally is just your
arm<00:00:31.289> and<00:00:31.619> your<00:00:31.740> poi<00:00:32.040> forming<00:00:32.790> one<00:00:33.149> continuous

arm and your poi forming one continuous

arm and your poi forming one continuous
line<00:00:34.399> that<00:00:35.399> goes<00:00:35.520> around<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:36.000> a<00:00:36.059> circle<00:00:36.090> right

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
line that goes around in a circle right

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.260 
line that goes around in a circle right
and<00:00:37.410> it's<00:00:38.160> it's<00:00:38.610> one<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.910> those<00:00:39.000> things<00:00:39.210> like

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
and it's it's one of those things like

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.670 
and it's it's one of those things like
static<00:00:39.780> spend<00:00:40.020> that<00:00:40.200> you<00:00:40.260> almost<00:00:40.410> have<00:00:40.559> to

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
static spend that you almost have to

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.319 
static spend that you almost have to
wonder<00:00:40.980> why<00:00:41.100> there's<00:00:41.309> a<00:00:41.370> name<00:00:41.550> for<00:00:41.790> it<00:00:41.879> but<00:00:42.059> I

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
wonder why there's a name for it but I

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.110 
wonder why there's a name for it but I
was<00:00:42.690> recently<00:00:43.079> reminded<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:44.120> why

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
was recently reminded of why

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.060 
was recently reminded of why
specifically<00:00:45.960> it's<00:00:46.079> helpful<00:00:46.530> which<00:00:46.680> is<00:00:46.860> that

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
specifically it's helpful which is that

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.950 
specifically it's helpful which is that
a<00:00:47.309> lot<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.910> us<00:00:48.030> in<00:00:48.210> the<00:00:48.300> first<00:00:48.510> couple<00:00:48.930> years

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
a lot of us in the first couple years

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450 
a lot of us in the first couple years
that<00:00:49.320> we're<00:00:49.469> spinning<00:00:49.710> we're<00:00:50.309> learning

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
that we're spinning we're learning

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.600 
that we're spinning we're learning
tricks<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.210> weaves<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:52.460> thread<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
tricks like weaves and thread the

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.049 
tricks like weaves and thread the
needles<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:55.190> crossers<00:00:56.190> and<00:00:56.730> things<00:00:56.910> like

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
needles and crossers and things like

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.750 
needles and crossers and things like
that<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.859> while<00:00:58.859> these<00:00:58.980> are<00:00:59.039> all<00:00:59.250> beautiful

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
that and while these are all beautiful

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.209 
that and while these are all beautiful
moves<00:01:00.059> they<00:01:00.600> haven't<00:01:01.020> unintended<00:01:01.649> and

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:02.219 
moves they haven't unintended and

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
moves they haven't unintended and
sometimes<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.210> negative<00:01:03.420> side<00:01:03.899> effects<00:01:04.379> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
sometimes the negative side effects and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:06.350 
sometimes the negative side effects and
I<00:01:04.860> see<00:01:05.309> this<00:01:05.460> popping<00:01:05.850> up<00:01:05.939> time<00:01:06.150> and<00:01:06.299> time

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
I see this popping up time and time

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.490 
I see this popping up time and time
again<00:01:06.600> with<00:01:06.780> beginners<00:01:07.140> which<00:01:08.040> is<00:01:08.280> that<00:01:08.610> they

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
again with beginners which is that they

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.770 
again with beginners which is that they
train<00:01:10.500> you<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:10.920> a<00:01:11.159> kind<00:01:11.790> of<00:01:11.909> bad<00:01:12.150> habit<00:01:12.750> that

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
train you into a kind of bad habit that

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.719 
train you into a kind of bad habit that
you<00:01:13.110> have<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.650> break<00:01:13.830> later<00:01:14.130> on<00:01:14.340> and<00:01:14.610> I<00:01:14.670> know

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
you have to break later on and I know

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:16.760 
you have to break later on and I know
this<00:01:14.970> because<00:01:15.210> they<00:01:16.049> trained<00:01:16.350> me<00:01:16.530> in<00:01:16.560> this

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
this because they trained me in this

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.289 
this because they trained me in this
habit<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.220> I<00:01:17.340> had<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.640> break<00:01:17.759> this<00:01:17.909> habit<00:01:18.090> it

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
habit and I had to break this habit it

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.719 
habit and I had to break this habit it
took<00:01:18.420> me<00:01:18.540> a<00:01:18.570> couple<00:01:18.630> years<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.140> get<00:01:19.259> there

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
took me a couple years to get there

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:22.969 
took me a couple years to get there
namely<00:01:20.729> when<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.630> think<00:01:21.960> of<00:01:22.080> point<00:01:22.380> in<00:01:22.860> this

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
namely when you think of point in this

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:23.510 
namely when you think of point in this
way

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
way

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.160 
way
what's<00:01:24.150> happening<00:01:24.659> is<00:01:24.810> that<00:01:24.840> you're

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
what's happening is that you're

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.399 
what's happening is that you're
minimizing<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.950> movements<00:01:26.369> in<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.700> arms<00:01:27.409> it

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
minimizing the movements in your arms it

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:29.690 
minimizing the movements in your arms it
almost<00:01:28.680> gets<00:01:28.860> to<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.130> point<00:01:29.340> where<00:01:29.579> you<00:01:29.670> think

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
almost gets to the point where you think

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.480 
almost gets to the point where you think
so<00:01:30.329> much<00:01:30.540> about<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.680> movement<00:01:32.100> of<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.250> poi

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
so much about the movement of the poi

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.510 
so much about the movement of the poi
that<00:01:33.479> your<00:01:33.900> arms<00:01:34.200> get<00:01:34.439> folded<00:01:34.890> into<00:01:34.979> your<00:01:35.280> body

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
that your arms get folded into your body

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.880 
that your arms get folded into your body
like<00:01:35.700> a<00:01:35.909> birds<00:01:36.420> do<00:01:36.750> when<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.439> walking

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
like a birds do when they're walking

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.870 
like a birds do when they're walking
around<00:01:38.220> on<00:01:38.280> the<00:01:38.340> ground<00:01:38.490> when<00:01:38.670> they're<00:01:38.759> not

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
around on the ground when they're not

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:40.609 
around on the ground when they're not
flying<00:01:39.240> right<00:01:39.479> and<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:40.110> actually<00:01:40.470> like

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
flying right and you're actually like

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.260 
flying right and you're actually like
trying<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.070> minimize<00:01:41.490> the<00:01:41.670> presence<00:01:42.030> of<00:01:42.150> your

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
trying to minimize the presence of your

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.240 
trying to minimize the presence of your
arms<00:01:42.509> entirely<00:01:42.899> as<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.200> do<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.560> and<00:01:43.799> this

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
arms entirely as you do this and this

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.760 
arms entirely as you do this and this
trends<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.820> start<00:01:45.200> working<00:01:46.200> at<00:01:46.439> moving

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
trends you to start working at moving

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.889 
trends you to start working at moving
the<00:01:46.860> poi<00:01:47.100> almost<00:01:47.880> completely<00:01:48.299> from<00:01:48.570> your<00:01:48.630> hand

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
the poi almost completely from your hand

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.420 
the poi almost completely from your hand
in<00:01:49.049> your<00:01:49.079> wrist<00:01:49.409> now<00:01:49.950> don't<00:01:50.159> get<00:01:50.250> me<00:01:50.369> wrong

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
in your wrist now don't get me wrong

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.100 
in your wrist now don't get me wrong
there's<00:01:50.820> many<00:01:51.119> many<00:01:51.270> cases<00:01:51.540> where<00:01:51.869> you<00:01:51.930> do

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
there's many many cases where you do

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.840 
there's many many cases where you do
have<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.439> move<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.829> poi<00:01:53.040> centrally<00:01:53.549> from<00:01:53.670> your

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
have to move the poi centrally from your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.580 
have to move the poi centrally from your
hand<00:01:54.030> in<00:01:54.149> your<00:01:54.270> wrist<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> good<00:01:55.350> plane

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.050 
hand in your wrist and good plane
control<00:01:55.979> really<00:01:56.189> does<00:01:56.399> come<00:01:56.670> from<00:01:56.820> there

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
control really does come from there

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.480 
control really does come from there
however<00:01:57.689> once<00:01:58.439> you<00:01:58.560> start<00:01:58.590> getting<00:01:59.070> into<00:01:59.219> more

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
however once you start getting into more

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.580 
however once you start getting into more
like<00:01:59.969> immediate<00:02:00.479> level<00:02:00.600> tricks<00:02:00.960> like<00:02:01.200> say

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
like immediate level tricks like say

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.130 
like immediate level tricks like say
getting<00:02:02.369> into<00:02:02.549> poi<00:02:02.790> flowers<00:02:03.390> and<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.689> like<00:02:03.869> or

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
getting into poi flowers and the like or

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.119 
getting into poi flowers and the like or
you<00:02:04.920> know<00:02:05.040> things<00:02:05.369> like<00:02:05.490> anti<00:02:05.909> spend<00:02:06.270> flowers

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:07.129 
you know things like anti spend flowers

00:02:07.129 --> 00:02:10.270 
you know things like anti spend flowers
caps<00:02:08.129> etc<00:02:08.489> all<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.539> sudden<00:02:09.869> something

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
caps etc all of a sudden something

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.470 
caps etc all of a sudden something
different<00:02:11.280> happens<00:02:11.700> with<00:02:11.940> how<00:02:12.090> you're<00:02:12.239> trying

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
different happens with how you're trying

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.760 
different happens with how you're trying
to<00:02:12.540> get<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.720> poi<00:02:12.930> to<00:02:13.080> move

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
to get the poi to move

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.890 
to get the poi to move
which<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.070> that<00:02:14.310> the<00:02:14.760> basis<00:02:15.240> of<00:02:15.360> movement<00:02:15.780> is

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
which is that the basis of movement is

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:17.510 
which is that the basis of movement is
no<00:02:16.080> longer<00:02:16.350> in<00:02:16.620> getting<00:02:16.890> your<00:02:16.980> hand<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.490> your

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
no longer in getting your hand in your

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.570 
no longer in getting your hand in your
wrist<00:02:18.000> to<00:02:18.810> move<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.320> poi<00:02:19.560> but<00:02:20.190> getting<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
wrist to move the poi but getting the

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:22.820 
wrist to move the poi but getting the
poi<00:02:20.820> to<00:02:21.090> be<00:02:21.210> an<00:02:21.300> extension<00:02:21.960> of<00:02:22.080> your<00:02:22.350> hand<00:02:22.410> and

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830 
poi to be an extension of your hand and

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.760 
poi to be an extension of your hand and
wrist<00:02:23.040> yeah<00:02:23.370> which<00:02:24.330> is<00:02:24.360> is<00:02:24.780> part<00:02:25.530> of<00:02:25.590> what's

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
wrist yeah which is is part of what's

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.350 
wrist yeah which is is part of what's
interesting<00:02:25.860> about<00:02:26.220> the<00:02:26.490> name<00:02:26.670> I<00:02:26.700> think<00:02:27.240> when

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:27.360 
interesting about the name I think when

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.270 
interesting about the name I think when
we<00:02:27.450> talk<00:02:27.660> about<00:02:27.690> extensions<00:02:28.530> we<00:02:28.950> usually

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
we talk about extensions we usually

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.250 
we talk about extensions we usually
think<00:02:29.460> about<00:02:29.730> extending<00:02:30.060> them<00:02:30.480> the<00:02:30.930> movement

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.260 
think about extending them the movement

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.720 
think about extending them the movement
of<00:02:31.350> the<00:02:31.410> poi<00:02:31.590> as<00:02:31.800> far<00:02:32.070> as<00:02:32.160> we<00:02:32.280> can<00:02:32.460> in<00:02:32.520> all

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
of the poi as far as we can in all

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.240 
of the poi as far as we can in all
directions<00:02:33.020> when<00:02:34.020> really<00:02:34.620> from<00:02:34.950> kind<00:02:35.130> of<00:02:35.160> a

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
directions when really from kind of a

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.640 
directions when really from kind of a
biomechanical<00:02:35.640> standpoint<00:02:36.600> this<00:02:37.170> is<00:02:37.380> all

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
biomechanical standpoint this is all

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.920 
biomechanical standpoint this is all
about<00:02:37.860> making<00:02:38.580> the<00:02:38.850> movement<00:02:39.060> to<00:02:39.360> the<00:02:39.390> poi<00:02:39.690> an

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
about making the movement to the poi an

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.840 
about making the movement to the poi an
extension<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.770> the<00:02:40.890> movement<00:02:41.280> of<00:02:41.430> your<00:02:41.550> hand

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
extension of the movement of your hand

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.510 
extension of the movement of your hand
and<00:02:42.000> arm<00:02:42.180> right<00:02:42.570> so<00:02:43.230> any<00:02:43.500> kind<00:02:43.800> of<00:02:43.920> movements

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
and arm right so any kind of movements

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:47.000 
and arm right so any kind of movements
that<00:02:45.030> you<00:02:45.240> can<00:02:45.480> do<00:02:45.720> with<00:02:46.080> your<00:02:46.260> hands<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.800> arms

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
that you can do with your hands and arms

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.090 
that you can do with your hands and arms
then<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:48.300> poi<00:02:48.570> wind<00:02:49.020> up<00:02:49.200> being<00:02:49.500> kind<00:02:49.770> of<00:02:49.920> an

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
then the poi wind up being kind of an

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.820 
then the poi wind up being kind of an
exaggerated<00:02:50.850> version<00:02:51.180> of<00:02:51.630> and<00:02:51.960> just<00:02:52.530> about

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:52.830 
exaggerated version of and just about

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:56.990 
exaggerated version of and just about
any<00:02:53.070> kind<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.490> movement<00:02:53.730> you<00:02:54.000> can<00:02:54.210> do<00:02:56.000> where

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
any kind of movement you can do where

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.970 
any kind of movement you can do where
you're<00:02:57.120> taking<00:02:57.360> up<00:02:57.690> more<00:02:57.900> room<00:02:58.230> these<00:02:58.710> really

00:02:58.970 --> 00:02:58.980 
you're taking up more room these really

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.580 
you're taking up more room these really
beautiful<00:02:59.190> flowers<00:03:00.090> and<00:03:00.170> hybrids<00:03:01.170> and<00:03:01.380> things

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:01.590 
beautiful flowers and hybrids and things

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.600 
beautiful flowers and hybrids and things
like<00:03:01.770> that<00:03:01.830> they<00:03:02.670> all<00:03:02.910> require<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.950> treat

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
like that they all require you to treat

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:08.360 
like that they all require you to treat
the<00:03:05.760> poi<00:03:06.000> as<00:03:06.330> an<00:03:06.540> extension<00:03:06.900> of<00:03:07.170> your<00:03:07.500> of<00:03:08.160> your

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
the poi as an extension of your of your

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.450 
the poi as an extension of your of your
hands<00:03:08.580> in<00:03:08.760> your<00:03:08.790> arms<00:03:09.120> right<00:03:09.650> so<00:03:10.650> basically

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
hands in your arms right so basically

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.010 
hands in your arms right so basically
this<00:03:12.180> is<00:03:12.240> one<00:03:12.450> of<00:03:12.510> those<00:03:12.630> things<00:03:12.870> that<00:03:12.930> I

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
this is one of those things that I

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.480 
this is one of those things that I
recommend<00:03:13.230> you<00:03:13.620> all<00:03:13.710> start<00:03:14.040> training

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.490 
recommend you all start training

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:16.130 
recommend you all start training
yourself<00:03:14.820> out<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.030> almost<00:03:15.540> as<00:03:15.750> soon<00:03:15.930> as<00:03:16.050> you

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
yourself out of almost as soon as you

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.560 
yourself out of almost as soon as you
possibly<00:03:16.350> can<00:03:16.860> even<00:03:17.610> as<00:03:17.760> your<00:03:17.910> beginner<00:03:18.300> when

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
possibly can even as your beginner when

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:19.880 
possibly can even as your beginner when
you're<00:03:18.690> doing<00:03:18.990> things<00:03:19.260> like<00:03:19.320> a<00:03:19.470> thread<00:03:19.770> the

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
you're doing things like a thread the

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.050 
you're doing things like a thread the
needle<00:03:20.220> a<00:03:20.370> lot<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:20.910> us<00:03:21.030> learn<00:03:21.240> this<00:03:21.480> as<00:03:21.660> say<00:03:23.060> big

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
needle a lot of us learn this as say big

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.420 
needle a lot of us learn this as say big
arm<00:03:24.300> movements<00:03:25.230> that<00:03:25.410> we<00:03:25.560> then<00:03:25.740> shrink<00:03:26.220> down

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
arm movements that we then shrink down

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:28.070 
arm movements that we then shrink down
into<00:03:26.670> smaller<00:03:27.000> movements<00:03:27.600> and<00:03:27.720> that's<00:03:27.840> fine

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:28.080 
into smaller movements and that's fine

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:29.570 
into smaller movements and that's fine
the<00:03:28.260> smaller<00:03:28.500> movements<00:03:29.010> look<00:03:29.070> quite

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
the smaller movements look quite

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:31.670 
the smaller movements look quite
beautiful<00:03:29.760> and<00:03:30.090> of<00:03:30.240> themselves<00:03:30.390> but<00:03:30.990> to<00:03:31.500> not

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
beautiful and of themselves but to not

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.360 
beautiful and of themselves but to not
let<00:03:31.920> go<00:03:32.130> that<00:03:32.490> big<00:03:32.700> arm<00:03:33.030> place<00:03:33.360> you<00:03:33.990> know<00:03:34.370> in

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
let go that big arm place you know in

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.460 
let go that big arm place you know in
fact<00:03:35.760> what<00:03:36.270> I<00:03:36.300> would<00:03:36.540> say<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:36.840> a<00:03:36.870> great<00:03:37.080> way<00:03:37.410> to

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
fact what I would say is a great way to

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.170 
fact what I would say is a great way to
begin<00:03:37.890> to<00:03:38.040> train<00:03:38.280> yourself<00:03:38.370> out<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.850> this<00:03:39.030> is

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
begin to train yourself out of this is

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:40.699 
begin to train yourself out of this is
actually<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.020> take<00:03:40.260> each<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.650> the

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
actually just to take each of the

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:41.780 
actually just to take each of the
different<00:03:40.860> timing<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.459> Direction

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
different timing and Direction

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.140 
different timing and Direction

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:53.180 
and of course split time same direction
and<00:03:51.120> just<00:03:51.690> begin<00:03:52.050> drilling<00:03:52.530> those<00:03:52.860> in<00:03:53.100> an

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
and just begin drilling those in an

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.770 
and just begin drilling those in an
extension<00:03:53.550> kind<00:03:53.880> of<00:03:53.970> place<00:03:54.209> and<00:03:54.480> it's<00:03:54.600> easy

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
extension kind of place and it's easy

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.540 
extension kind of place and it's easy
enough<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.080> start<00:03:55.440> off<00:03:55.620> you<00:03:55.800> just<00:03:55.950> have<00:03:56.520> your

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:56.550 
enough to start off you just have your

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:58.970 
enough to start off you just have your
hands<00:03:56.970> do<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.240> actions<00:03:57.750> that<00:03:57.840> is<00:03:58.140> you<00:03:58.320> kind<00:03:58.920> of

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
hands do the actions that is you kind of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.520 
hands do the actions that is you kind of
imagine<00:03:59.190> you're<00:03:59.520> holding<00:03:59.670> a<00:03:59.910> bowl<00:04:00.150> and<00:04:00.530> you

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
imagine you're holding a bowl and you

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.140 
imagine you're holding a bowl and you
turn<00:04:02.010> your<00:04:02.190> hands<00:04:02.430> around<00:04:02.550> in<00:04:02.760> a<00:04:02.820> big<00:04:02.970> circle

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
turn your hands around in a big circle

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.090 
turn your hands around in a big circle
like<00:04:03.360> this<00:04:03.570> 44<00:04:04.470> together<00:04:05.130> same<00:04:05.430> time<00:04:05.700> and<00:04:07.100> then

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:08.100 
like this 44 together same time and then

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.220 
like this 44 together same time and then
you<00:04:08.430> do<00:04:08.820> the<00:04:08.970> same<00:04:09.180> thing<00:04:09.450> with<00:04:09.570> the<00:04:09.690> poi<00:04:09.930> and

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:10.230 
you do the same thing with the poi and

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:11.900 
you do the same thing with the poi and
what<00:04:10.680> will<00:04:10.770> inevitably<00:04:10.980> happen<00:04:11.610> the<00:04:11.700> first

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
what will inevitably happen the first

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:13.640 
what will inevitably happen the first
few<00:04:12.120> times<00:04:12.330> you<00:04:12.480> do<00:04:12.660> this<00:04:12.690> is<00:04:13.080> you're<00:04:13.560> gonna

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 
few times you do this is you're gonna

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.620 
few times you do this is you're gonna
find<00:04:14.040> something<00:04:14.430> wonky<00:04:14.910> happening<00:04:15.360> either

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
find something wonky happening either

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.770 
find something wonky happening either
the<00:04:16.230> point<00:04:16.500> ever<00:04:16.770> quite<00:04:17.160> gets<00:04:17.489> across<00:04:18.330> the<00:04:18.540> top

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
the point ever quite gets across the top

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.430 
the point ever quite gets across the top
like<00:04:19.080> that<00:04:19.320> or<00:04:19.890> you'll<00:04:20.400> do<00:04:20.580> something<00:04:20.850> like

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:21.440 
like that or you'll do something like

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:23.930 
like that or you'll do something like
making<00:04:22.440> an<00:04:22.560> extra<00:04:22.860> circle<00:04:23.310> because<00:04:23.610> your<00:04:23.729> hand

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:23.940 
making an extra circle because your hand

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:25.820 
making an extra circle because your hand
just<00:04:24.090> cannot<00:04:24.660> believe<00:04:24.930> for<00:04:25.260> the<00:04:25.320> life<00:04:25.500> of<00:04:25.680> it

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:25.830 
just cannot believe for the life of it

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:27.620 
just cannot believe for the life of it
that<00:04:26.370> its<00:04:26.520> job<00:04:26.760> is<00:04:26.940> not<00:04:27.060> to<00:04:27.120> make<00:04:27.450> the

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
that its job is not to make the

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.540 
that its job is not to make the
boy<00:04:27.840> keep<00:04:28.110> on<00:04:28.290> turning<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:28.860> it's<00:04:29.010> not<00:04:29.220> it's

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
boy keep on turning but it's not it's

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.760 
boy keep on turning but it's not it's
now<00:04:29.730> coming<00:04:30.090> from<00:04:30.210> your<00:04:30.360> shoulder<00:04:30.720> so<00:04:31.440> if

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
now coming from your shoulder so if

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.350 
now coming from your shoulder so if
you're<00:04:32.190> having<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.580> problem<00:04:32.790> the<00:04:33.150> poise

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:33.360 
you're having that problem the poise

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.780 
you're having that problem the poise
going<00:04:33.660> limp<00:04:33.900> up<00:04:34.110> top<00:04:34.350> then<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.400> you<00:04:35.490> need<00:04:35.670> to

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:35.790 
going limp up top then what you need to

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:40.160 
going limp up top then what you need to
do<00:04:35.970> is<00:04:36.240> I<00:04:37.190> guess<00:04:38.190> turn<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.760> a<00:04:38.850> bit<00:04:39.090> faster<00:04:39.450> so

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
do is I guess turn it a bit faster so

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:43.100 
do is I guess turn it a bit faster so
that<00:04:40.500> the<00:04:40.920> centrifugal<00:04:41.580> force<00:04:41.640> from<00:04:42.540> the<00:04:42.870> poi

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
that the centrifugal force from the poi

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.200 
that the centrifugal force from the poi
going<00:04:43.440> outward<00:04:43.890> is<00:04:44.070> always<00:04:44.400> keeping<00:04:44.730> it<00:04:44.850> rigid

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:45.210 
going outward is always keeping it rigid

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.420 
going outward is always keeping it rigid
like<00:04:45.390> this<00:04:45.630> if<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.530> slow<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:46.800> down<00:04:46.980> what

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:47.430 
like this if you slow it down what

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.420 
like this if you slow it down what
happens<00:04:47.850> is<00:04:48.150> it<00:04:48.690> goes<00:04:48.990> limp<00:04:49.710> over<00:04:50.130> the<00:04:50.220> top

00:04:50.420 --> 00:04:50.430 
happens is it goes limp over the top

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.460 
happens is it goes limp over the top
right<00:04:50.700> and<00:04:50.850> likewise<00:04:51.660> if<00:04:51.900> you<00:04:52.080> find<00:04:52.380> yourself

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
right and likewise if you find yourself

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:55.970 
right and likewise if you find yourself
doing<00:04:53.430> extra<00:04:53.910> circle<00:04:54.360> with<00:04:55.200> your<00:04:55.440> hand<00:04:55.680> try

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:55.980 
doing extra circle with your hand try

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.910 
doing extra circle with your hand try
relaxing<00:04:56.820> it<00:04:57.110> try<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.350> letting<00:04:58.650> it<00:04:58.770> go

00:04:58.910 --> 00:04:58.920 
relaxing it try just letting it go

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.390 
relaxing it try just letting it go
slower<00:04:59.400> and<00:05:00.020> really<00:05:01.020> really<00:05:01.260> figure<00:05:01.800> out<00:05:01.830> how

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:02.400 
slower and really really figure out how

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.730 
slower and really really figure out how
slow<00:05:03.030> you<00:05:03.090> can<00:05:03.390> possibly<00:05:03.870> get<00:05:04.080> this<00:05:04.290> movement

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
slow you can possibly get this movement

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.040 
slow you can possibly get this movement
across<00:05:04.920> the<00:05:05.040> top<00:05:05.460> before<00:05:06.420> it<00:05:06.540> does<00:05:06.720> start<00:05:06.960> to

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
across the top before it does start to

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.080 
across the top before it does start to
get<00:05:07.200> limp<00:05:07.470> and<00:05:07.650> there<00:05:08.400> you'll<00:05:08.550> find<00:05:08.820> that<00:05:08.940> kind

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
get limp and there you'll find that kind

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.370 
get limp and there you'll find that kind
of<00:05:09.180> comfortable<00:05:09.630> range<00:05:09.810> where<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:10.170> you<00:05:10.230> can

00:05:10.370 --> 00:05:10.380 
of comfortable range where and you can

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.280 
of comfortable range where and you can
do<00:05:10.620> those<00:05:10.830> extensions<00:05:11.400> right<00:05:11.580> so<00:05:12.330> again<00:05:12.450> we

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
do those extensions right so again we

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.560 
do those extensions right so again we
practice<00:05:13.680> that<00:05:13.710> in<00:05:14.070> together<00:05:14.490> same<00:05:15.440> and<00:05:17.090> we<00:05:18.090> go

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:18.570 
practice that in together same and we go

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:19.940 
practice that in together same and we go
back<00:05:18.780> to<00:05:18.930> our<00:05:18.960> thread<00:05:19.290> the<00:05:19.410> needles<00:05:19.680> and<00:05:19.860> do

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
back to our thread the needles and do

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.980 
back to our thread the needles and do
them<00:05:20.100> from<00:05:20.190> a<00:05:20.310> fully<00:05:20.520> extended<00:05:20.970> place<00:05:21.210> in

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
them from a fully extended place in

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:28.400 
them from a fully extended place in
together<00:05:22.350> opposite<00:05:26.600> then<00:05:27.600> we<00:05:27.690> do<00:05:27.810> split<00:05:28.200> time

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:28.410 
together opposite then we do split time

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:30.740 
together opposite then we do split time
opposites<00:05:28.920> right<00:05:29.160> which<00:05:29.610> a<00:05:30.150> lot<00:05:30.540> of<00:05:30.570> people

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:30.750 
opposites right which a lot of people

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:32.750 
opposites right which a lot of people
when<00:05:31.470> I<00:05:31.500> first<00:05:31.740> show<00:05:31.920> them<00:05:32.100> this<00:05:32.220> they<00:05:32.460> want<00:05:32.670> to

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:32.760 
when I first show them this they want to

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.670 
when I first show them this they want to
kind<00:05:32.940> of<00:05:33.030> minimize<00:05:33.900> it<00:05:34.050> down<00:05:34.170> to<00:05:34.320> this<00:05:34.410> place

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
kind of minimize it down to this place

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.870 
kind of minimize it down to this place
once<00:05:34.920> again<00:05:35.040> where<00:05:35.370> their<00:05:35.490> hands<00:05:35.730> are

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
once again where their hands are

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:37.280 
once again where their hands are

the only way that you're practicing it

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.720 
the only way that you're practicing it
really<00:05:43.080> really<00:05:43.350> really<00:05:43.380> reach<00:05:43.980> out<00:05:44.190> and<00:05:44.430> try

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
really really really reach out and try

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
you know it's gonna be hard at first

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:52.190 
you know it's gonna be hard at first
especially<00:05:49.500> if<00:05:49.710> you're<00:05:49.980> used<00:05:50.970> to<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.390> my

use so many favors to be able to get to

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.640 
use so many favors to be able to get to
this<00:05:57.900> place<00:05:58.080> sooner<00:05:58.530> and<00:05:59.100> of<00:05:59.280> course<00:05:59.460> finally

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
this place sooner and of course finally

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:02.480 
this place sooner and of course finally
coming<00:06:01.650> at<00:06:01.740> it<00:06:01.770> from<00:06:01.860> a<00:06:02.010> place<00:06:02.190> where<00:06:02.370> you're

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:02.490 
coming at it from a place where you're

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:03.800 
coming at it from a place where you're
doing<00:06:02.610> the<00:06:02.670> crawl<00:06:02.880> stroke<00:06:03.000> with<00:06:03.300> your<00:06:03.420> poi<00:06:03.630> you

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:03.810 
doing the crawl stroke with your poi you

00:06:03.810 --> 00:06:07.430 
doing the crawl stroke with your poi you
know<00:06:03.930> in<00:06:04.130> split<00:06:05.130> time<00:06:05.310> same<00:06:05.610> direction<00:06:06.440> so

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:07.440 
know in split time same direction so

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:09.350 
know in split time same direction so
start<00:06:08.280> drilling<00:06:08.520> these<00:06:08.700> sooner<00:06:09.120> rather<00:06:09.270> than

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:09.360 
start drilling these sooner rather than

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:11.780 
start drilling these sooner rather than
later<00:06:09.450> and<00:06:09.750> what<00:06:10.020> you'll<00:06:10.140> find<00:06:10.170> is<00:06:10.770> that<00:06:11.130> moves

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
later and what you'll find is that moves

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:13.370 
later and what you'll find is that moves
that<00:06:11.970> tend<00:06:12.180> to<00:06:12.240> eat<00:06:12.390> up<00:06:12.540> more<00:06:12.750> room<00:06:12.990> and<00:06:13.230> have

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:13.380 
that tend to eat up more room and have

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.530 
that tend to eat up more room and have
more<00:06:13.530> freedom<00:06:13.920> of<00:06:14.040> movement<00:06:14.190> to<00:06:14.520> them<00:06:14.700> such<00:06:15.510> as

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:15.540 
more freedom of movement to them such as

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:19.460 
more freedom of movement to them such as
flowers<00:06:16.350> or<00:06:17.060> hybrids<00:06:18.060> like<00:06:18.150> this<00:06:18.630> will<00:06:19.290> come

00:06:19.460 --> 00:06:19.470 
flowers or hybrids like this will come

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.380 
flowers or hybrids like this will come
to<00:06:19.650> you<00:06:19.740> much<00:06:19.950> easier<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.850> you<00:06:20.910> won't<00:06:21.240> have

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:21.390 
to you much easier that you won't have

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:23.300 
to you much easier that you won't have
to<00:06:21.600> force<00:06:21.930> them<00:06:22.170> in<00:06:22.290> order<00:06:22.440> to<00:06:22.500> make<00:06:22.710> them<00:06:22.890> come

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:23.310 
to force them in order to make them come

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:26.090 
to force them in order to make them come
out<00:06:23.490> in<00:06:23.850> fact<00:06:24.210> one<00:06:24.840> of<00:06:24.930> the<00:06:25.020> beauties<00:06:25.410> of<00:06:25.590> using

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:26.100 
out in fact one of the beauties of using

00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:27.200 
out in fact one of the beauties of using
poi<00:06:26.340> in<00:06:26.520> this<00:06:26.640> way<00:06:26.790> is<00:06:26.850> that<00:06:26.940> it<00:06:27.030> actually

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
poi in this way is that it actually

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:29.470 
poi in this way is that it actually
takes<00:06:27.540> a<00:06:27.660> lot<00:06:27.900> less<00:06:28.050> energy<00:06:28.230> to<00:06:28.620> spin<00:06:28.890> over<00:06:29.100> all

00:06:29.470 --> 00:06:29.480 
takes a lot less energy to spin over all

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:32.660 
takes a lot less energy to spin over all
it<00:06:30.480> takes<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.170> lot<00:06:31.410> less<00:06:31.530> concentration<00:06:32.220> and

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:32.670 
it takes a lot less concentration and

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.790 
it takes a lot less concentration and
ultimately<00:06:33.360> I<00:06:33.720> think<00:06:34.080> it<00:06:34.440> looks<00:06:34.620> more

00:06:34.790 --> 00:06:34.800 
ultimately I think it looks more

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:37.820 
ultimately I think it looks more
beautiful<00:06:34.980> in<00:06:35.310> the<00:06:35.370> long<00:06:35.550> run<00:06:35.790> so<00:06:36.380> yeah<00:06:37.380> that

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:37.830 
beautiful in the long run so yeah that

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.830 
beautiful in the long run so yeah that
is<00:06:37.940> extensions<00:06:38.940> that<00:06:39.060> are<00:06:39.150> nutshell<00:06:39.540> if<00:06:39.750> you

guys are in your first year second year
spinning<00:06:41.759> POI<00:06:41.970> I<00:06:42.240> cannot<00:06:43.110> recommend<00:06:43.470> getting

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:43.830 
spinning POI I cannot recommend getting

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.820 
spinning POI I cannot recommend getting
into<00:06:44.069> this<00:06:44.190> early<00:06:44.580> enough<00:06:44.910> it<00:06:45.840> will<00:06:46.110> prepare

00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:49.770 
down the road and ways that you can't

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:50.600 
down the road and ways that you can't
possibly<00:06:49.979> imagine

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
possibly imagine

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:53.029
