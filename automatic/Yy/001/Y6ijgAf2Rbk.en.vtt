00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:09.280
 to begin I trace the line of 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:11.290
 horizon I think my camera is a 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.130
 little inclined and that's why the line 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.350
 see Czech 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:17.350
 then I make the silhouette of the cliff 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.530
 and then lines that are all going to join 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:25.780
 the same vanishing point to give the 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.820
 illusion of perspective and with a rule 

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.670
 longer or rather a stick in this 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.040
 case traced the cliff lines that 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:35.230
 all are going to be joined about one meter 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.699
 distance from the paper where it will be 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.699
 the person watching a drawing 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.350
 now after the silhouette of my little angel 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.690
 they have too long legs 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.030
 because when you see him from the point 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:55.570
 of correct view by the inclination of the 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:57.660
 paper if they would not seem very short 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:57.660
 ah 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.449
 ah 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.440
 let's check how you are seeing from 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.240
 the angle at which I was saying 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:15.960
 from here as he already begins to take 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:15.960
 some perspective 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.530
 I start to give you from country 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.090
 he drew a cloudy and somewhat dramatic sky 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.179
 and then he blurred them with the brush 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.179
 Y 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:42.930
 with the moldable eraser I take out 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.930
 some lights to the clouds 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:06.690
 I start to shade I want the 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.690
 depth be intensely dark 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.630
 ah 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:17.920
 the list of materials is in the 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.920
 information under the video 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.290
 I make the shadow of the angel 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:32.290
 ah 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.330
 ah 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.379
 to help it stand out I'm going to 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:43.830
 make the background darker and I'm going to 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.830
 delineate 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.769
 ah 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.459
 very well let 's see it from here 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:02.230
 ok I'll do one more thing I hope not 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.590
 ruin everything 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.760
 I'm going to fold the sheet exactly in 

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.510
 where is the horizon 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.510
 carefully 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:30.460
 well now we do see the final result 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:34.980
 Y 

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.980
 and please tell me what you think
