00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
fiberglass mounting plate that I made

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.280 
fiberglass mounting plate that I made
from<00:02:35.440> a<00:02:35.620> mold<00:02:35.799> I'll<00:02:36.310> show<00:02:36.489> you<00:02:36.549> how<00:02:36.700> to<00:02:36.760> make

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
from a mold I'll show you how to make

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.400 
from a mold I'll show you how to make
that<00:02:38.290> attaches<00:02:38.620> very<00:02:39.040> securely<00:02:39.630> this<00:02:40.630> is<00:02:40.870> the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
that attaches very securely this is the

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.949 
that attaches very securely this is the
lens<00:02:41.769> cradle<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.370> it's<00:02:43.120> also<00:02:43.360> something<00:02:43.750> I

00:02:43.949 --> 00:02:43.959 
lens cradle and it's also something I

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.059 
lens cradle and it's also something I
fabricated<00:02:44.470> but<00:02:45.190> it's<00:02:45.340> very<00:02:45.700> easy<00:02:45.940> to<00:02:46.030> do

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:48.069 
fabricated but it's very easy to do

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:53.800 
fabricated but it's very easy to do
it<00:02:49.069> comes<00:02:49.340> off<00:02:49.750> easily<00:02:51.250> this<00:02:52.250> is<00:02:52.459> the<00:02:52.810> acrylic

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:53.810 
it comes off easily this is the acrylic

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.170 
it comes off easily this is the acrylic
lens<00:02:53.959> I<00:02:54.230> left<00:02:54.409> the<00:02:54.500> paper<00:02:54.709> on<00:02:54.950> this<00:02:55.939> is<00:02:56.090> the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:56.180 
lens I left the paper on this is the

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.179 
lens I left the paper on this is the
front<00:02:56.420> of<00:02:56.629> the<00:02:56.810> camera<00:02:56.989> housing<00:02:57.439> this<00:02:57.980> is<00:02:58.159> a

00:02:58.179 --> 00:02:58.189 
front of the camera housing this is a

00:02:58.189 --> 00:02:59.920 
front of the camera housing this is a
little<00:02:58.459> mounting<00:02:58.849> board<00:02:59.120> that<00:02:59.390> slides<00:02:59.629> in<00:02:59.840> and

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
little mounting board that slides in and

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.069 
little mounting board that slides in and
out<00:03:00.049> you<00:03:00.890> can<00:03:00.950> fit<00:03:01.310> many<00:03:02.269> types<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.689> cameras

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:03.079 
out you can fit many types of cameras

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.559 
out you can fit many types of cameras
you<00:03:03.590> can<00:03:03.620> make<00:03:03.950> these<00:03:04.189> as<00:03:04.430> long<00:03:04.670> or<00:03:04.939> short<00:03:05.450> as

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
you can make these as long or short as

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:06.069 
you can make these as long or short as
you<00:03:05.629> want

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
you want

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:08.080 
you want
also<00:03:06.590> this<00:03:06.769> PVC<00:03:07.159> pipe<00:03:07.549> comes<00:03:07.849> in<00:03:08.000> different

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
also this PVC pipe comes in different

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.580 
also this PVC pipe comes in different
diameters<00:03:08.390> so<00:03:08.840> if<00:03:08.930> you<00:03:08.989> have<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.140> much<00:03:09.379> larger

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
diameters so if you have a much larger

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.039 
diameters so if you have a much larger
camera<00:03:10.099> you<00:03:10.640> can<00:03:10.819> use<00:03:11.000> this<00:03:11.239> design<00:03:11.599> and<00:03:11.840> make

00:03:12.039 --> 00:03:12.049 
camera you can use this design and make

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:14.800 
camera you can use this design and make

these materials for everything is about

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.040 
these materials for everything is about
$60<00:04:35.539> so<00:04:36.139> it's<00:04:36.320> very<00:04:36.560> low<00:04:36.710> cost

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.050
