let's see what she does at 20 yards it's

00:01:52.590 --> 00:02:06.250 
let's see what she does at 20 yards it's
not<00:01:52.770> get<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.280> we<00:01:53.369> can<00:01:55.219> dive<00:01:56.219> every<00:01:56.610> day

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260

there all right so that gives you a good

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:19.190 
there all right so that gives you a good
example<00:02:15.780> of<00:02:16.550> what<00:02:17.550> 20<00:02:17.880> yards<00:02:18.180> will<00:02:18.300> do<00:02:18.480> let's

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
example of what 20 yards will do let's

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.120 
example of what 20 yards will do let's
see<00:02:19.440> what<00:02:19.680> 15<00:02:20.310> yards<00:02:20.820> does<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:22.320> know<00:02:22.560> if<00:02:22.740> you

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
see what 15 yards does you know if you

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:24.350
