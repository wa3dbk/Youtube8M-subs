stage as the bull versus hole so what

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.120 
stage as the bull versus hole so what
you<00:00:09.389> say<00:00:09.510> this<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.719> a<00:00:09.860> pretty<00:00:10.860> good<00:00:11.040> Pro

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:11.130

station<00:00:11.370> ryoshu<00:00:11.719> a<00:00:12.719> little<00:00:13.320> bit<00:00:13.440> I<00:00:13.650> think

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
station ryoshu a little bit I think

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.980 
station ryoshu a little bit I think
just<00:00:14.759> cuz<00:00:14.880> he<00:00:15.030> can<00:00:15.240> space<00:00:15.509> out<00:00:15.630> with<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:15.870> eggs

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
just cuz he can space out with the eggs

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.750 
just cuz he can space out with the eggs
but<00:00:16.230> guess<00:00:16.470> to<00:00:16.590> be<00:00:16.680> really<00:00:16.859> careful<00:00:17.130> about<00:00:17.160> -<00:00:17.520> I

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
but guess to be really careful about - I

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:20.240 
but guess to be really careful about - I
was<00:00:17.940> great<00:00:18.180> spot<00:00:18.390> dodge<00:00:18.890> yeah<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.920> think<00:00:20.070> this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
was great spot dodge yeah I think this

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.800 
was great spot dodge yeah I think this
is<00:00:20.400> like<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.670> mean<00:00:20.699> this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.029> like<00:00:21.150> before<00:00:21.510> glory

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
is like I mean this is like before glory

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.009 
is like I mean this is like before glory
like<00:00:22.050> max-age<00:00:22.560> see<00:00:23.369> it<00:00:23.490> quite<00:00:23.910> often<00:00:24.119> did<00:00:24.840> so

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
like max-age see it quite often did so

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:25.550 
like max-age see it quite often did so
much<00:00:25.140> damage

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
much damage

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.450 
much damage
yeah<00:00:26.099> I<00:00:27.529> mean<00:00:28.529> I<00:00:28.590> think<00:00:28.769> this<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.039> a<00:00:29.160> fairly

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
yeah I mean I think this is a fairly

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.009 
yeah I mean I think this is a fairly
even<00:00:29.670> matchup<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.330> be<00:00:30.420> honest

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
even matchup to be honest

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.990 
even matchup to be honest
Jack<00:00:31.470> can't<00:00:31.679> go<00:00:31.800> super<00:00:32.279> super<00:00:32.430> far<00:00:32.730> off<00:00:32.820> the
