00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.510 

I<00:00:00.680> think<00:00:01.680> that<00:00:01.829> was<00:00:01.979> one<00:00:02.159> of<00:00:02.190> the<00:00:02.340> most

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:02.520 
I think that was one of the most

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:04.849 
I think that was one of the most
informative<00:00:02.790> interviews<00:00:03.480> that<00:00:03.659> we've<00:00:03.840> had<00:00:04.589> so

00:00:04.849 --> 00:00:04.859 
informative interviews that we've had so

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:08.629 
informative interviews that we've had so
without<00:00:05.700> very<00:00:06.569> much<00:00:06.720> oh<00:00:07.049> good<00:00:07.859> I'm<00:00:08.040> glad<00:00:08.519> to

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
without very much oh good I'm glad to

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:10.910 
without very much oh good I'm glad to
hear<00:00:08.730> that<00:00:08.880> yeah<00:00:09.750> you<00:00:09.809> guys<00:00:10.050> act<00:00:10.380> you<00:00:10.590> actually

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
hear that yeah you guys act you actually

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.160 
hear that yeah you guys act you actually
sent<00:00:11.099> some<00:00:11.250> really<00:00:11.429> good<00:00:11.519> questions<00:00:12.170> because

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
sent some really good questions because

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.400 
sent some really good questions because
I<00:00:13.440> mean<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.160> never<00:00:14.340> even<00:00:14.429> pay<00:00:14.759> attention<00:00:14.790> to<00:00:15.410> the

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
I mean I never even pay attention to the

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.730 
I mean I never even pay attention to the
hormone<00:00:16.890> sensitive<00:00:17.100> lipase<00:00:17.730> just<00:00:18.210> because

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:18.740 
hormone sensitive lipase just because

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.140 
hormone sensitive lipase just because
there<00:00:19.740> was<00:00:19.859> no<00:00:20.010> data<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.369> make<00:00:20.580> me<00:00:20.760> wonder<00:00:21.119> and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
there was no data to make me wonder and

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:22.609 
there was no data to make me wonder and
then<00:00:21.449> you<00:00:21.570> ask<00:00:21.779> that<00:00:22.050> now<00:00:22.230> it's<00:00:22.350> like<00:00:22.439> oh<00:00:22.590> I

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
then you ask that now it's like oh I

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:23.810 
then you ask that now it's like oh I
wonder<00:00:22.980> if<00:00:23.010> there's<00:00:23.220> something<00:00:23.580> new<00:00:23.609> that

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
wonder if there's something new that

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.410 
wonder if there's something new that
I've<00:00:24.150> missed<00:00:25.519> if<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.730> want<00:00:26.880> I<00:00:26.939> can<00:00:27.090> send<00:00:27.150> you

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:27.420 
I've missed if you want I can send you

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.019 
I've missed if you want I can send you
the<00:00:27.480> thing<00:00:27.840> which<00:00:28.019> I<00:00:28.170> found<00:00:28.410> but<00:00:28.560> I<00:00:28.619> think<00:00:29.609> from

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
the thing which I found but I think from

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.820 
the thing which I found but I think from
what<00:00:30.150> you<00:00:30.269> said<00:00:30.480> it<00:00:30.630> seems<00:00:30.810> like<00:00:31.320> you've<00:00:31.529> read

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
into it a lot more but it was an article

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.080 
into it a lot more but it was an article
on<00:00:35.760> insulin<00:00:36.149> from<00:00:36.420> weight<00:00:36.719> or<00:00:36.899> energy<00:00:38.090> I'll

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
on insulin from weight or energy I'll

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.430 
on insulin from weight or energy I'll
see<00:00:39.300> I'll<00:00:39.510> find<00:00:39.719> the<00:00:39.780> references<00:00:40.140> for<00:00:40.320> you

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
see I'll find the references for you

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.770 
see I'll find the references for you
yeah<00:00:41.040> that'd<00:00:41.760> be<00:00:41.790> great<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.120> like<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.510> look<00:00:42.600> into

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
yeah that'd be great I like to look into

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
since all this came out like I've been

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.410 
since all this came out like I've been
bombarded<00:00:49.950> with<00:00:49.980> all<00:00:50.370> of<00:00:50.550> these<00:00:50.640> quote

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
bombarded with all of these quote

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.750 
bombarded with all of these quote
unquote<00:00:51.539> facts<00:00:52.170> that<00:00:52.559> I<00:00:52.590> didn't<00:00:53.280> know<00:00:53.399> and<00:00:53.640> one

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
unquote facts that I didn't know and one

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.340 
unquote facts that I didn't know and one
of<00:00:53.850> them<00:00:53.940> was<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.090> well<00:00:54.420> do<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.230> know

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
of them was like well do you know

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.479 
of them was like well do you know
caffeine<00:00:55.620> shuts<00:00:56.190> off<00:00:56.340> mTOR<00:00:56.820> oh<00:00:58.039> I<00:00:59.039> like<00:00:59.340> if

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
caffeine shuts off mTOR oh I like if

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.939 
caffeine shuts off mTOR oh I like if
that's<00:00:59.730> the<00:01:00.059> case<00:01:00.329> then<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> really<00:01:01.620> I<00:01:01.680> need<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
that's the case then I really I need to

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.359 
that's the case then I really I need to
rewrite<00:01:02.100> the<00:01:02.370> whole<00:01:02.460> book<00:01:03.769> looked<00:01:04.769> it<00:01:04.920> up<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
rewrite the whole book looked it up and

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:06.980 
rewrite the whole book looked it up and
there's<00:01:05.610> there's<00:01:05.909> actually<00:01:06.090> a<00:01:06.299> few<00:01:06.479> studies

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
there's there's actually a few studies

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.050 
there's there's actually a few studies
they're<00:01:07.200> all<00:01:07.350> reviews<00:01:07.920> they're<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.729> studies

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
they're all reviews they're not studies

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.640 
they're all reviews they're not studies
they're<00:01:09.240> just<00:01:09.420> reviews<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.049> information<00:01:10.530> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
they're just reviews of information and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.020 
they're just reviews of information and
they<00:01:10.740> mention<00:01:11.189> it<00:01:11.340> and<00:01:11.750> then<00:01:12.750> all<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.650> them

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
they mention it and then all of them

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.170 
they mention it and then all of them
reference<00:01:15.030> one<00:01:16.189> study<00:01:17.189> and<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.670> study<00:01:17.700> was

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
reference one study and the study was

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.140 
reference one study and the study was
done<00:01:18.360> in<00:01:18.420> isolated<00:01:19.170> yeast<00:01:19.470> cells<00:01:19.920> in<00:01:20.700> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
done in isolated yeast cells in the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.929 
done in isolated yeast cells in the
presence<00:01:21.689> of<00:01:21.840> rapamycin<00:01:22.200> which<00:01:22.770> also<00:01:23.130> shuts

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
presence of rapamycin which also shuts

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.719 
presence of rapamycin which also shuts
off<00:01:24.350> mTOR<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.189> didn't<00:01:26.430> show<00:01:26.549> that

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
off mTOR and it didn't show that

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.399 
off mTOR and it didn't show that
caffeine<00:01:27.119> shut<00:01:27.390> off<00:01:27.540> mTOR<00:01:27.960> it<00:01:28.049> just<00:01:28.229> shows

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
caffeine shut off mTOR it just shows

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.460 
caffeine shut off mTOR it just shows
that<00:01:28.439> with<00:01:29.310> caffeine<00:01:29.700> present<00:01:30.270> rapamycin<00:01:30.840> is

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
that with caffeine present rapamycin is

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.480 
that with caffeine present rapamycin is
more<00:01:32.689> it<00:01:33.689> has<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> stronger<00:01:34.770> influence<00:01:35.100> on

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
more it has a stronger influence on

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.700 
more it has a stronger influence on
down-regulating<00:01:36.360> mTOR<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:36.930> I'm<00:01:37.020> like<00:01:37.140> how

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
down-regulating mTOR and I'm like how

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.560 
down-regulating mTOR and I'm like how
the<00:01:37.740> hell<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.400> that's<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.729> only<00:01:39.030> study<00:01:39.270> that

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
the hell and that's the only study that

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140 
the hell and that's the only study that
is<00:01:39.720> the<00:01:39.869> only<00:01:40.020> one<00:01:40.320> in<00:01:40.439> existence<00:01:40.970> I'm<00:01:41.970> like

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
is the only one in existence I'm like

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.789 
is the only one in existence I'm like
how<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.390> hell<00:01:42.689> did<00:01:42.810> somebody<00:01:43.079> make<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.560> leap

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
how the hell did somebody make the leap

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.560 
how the hell did somebody make the leap
from<00:01:44.420> yeast<00:01:45.420> cells<00:01:46.460> to<00:01:47.460> O<00:01:47.490> caffeine<00:01:48.210> shuts<00:01:48.450> off

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
from yeast cells to O caffeine shuts off

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.370 
from yeast cells to O caffeine shuts off
mTOR<00:01:48.960> in<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.110> body<00:01:50.180> it's<00:01:51.180> just<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.899> amazes<00:01:52.350> me

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
mTOR in the body it's just it amazes me

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.990 
mTOR in the body it's just it amazes me
and<00:01:52.530> I'm<00:01:53.009> not<00:01:53.159> saying<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.430> that's<00:01:53.579> not<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and I'm not saying that that's not the

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.359 
and I'm not saying that that's not the
case<00:01:54.030> but<00:01:54.540> at<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.840> moment<00:01:55.369> there's

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
case but at the moment there's

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.270 
case but at the moment there's
absolutely<00:01:57.000> no<00:01:57.180> reason<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.689> believe<00:01:58.530> that<00:01:58.740> and

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
absolutely no reason to believe that and

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.340 
absolutely no reason to believe that and
there's<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.180> kinds<00:02:00.450> of<00:02:00.509> results<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.200> the

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
there's all kinds of results to the

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.270 
there's all kinds of results to the
contrary<00:02:01.829> so

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.130 

it's<00:02:05.280> been<00:02:05.490> an<00:02:05.610> interesting<00:02:05.880> exercise<00:02:06.479> for<00:02:06.960> me

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
it's been an interesting exercise for me

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.559 
it's been an interesting exercise for me
for<00:02:07.740> what<00:02:08.069> people<00:02:08.399> will<00:02:08.580> read<00:02:08.880> and<00:02:09.330> what

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
for what people will read and what

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.670 
for what people will read and what
they'll<00:02:09.750> do<00:02:09.929> with<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:12.050> well<00:02:13.050> I<00:02:13.080> mean<00:02:13.319> at<00:02:13.500> least

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
they'll do with it well I mean at least

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:14.990 
they'll do with it well I mean at least
there<00:02:13.860> was<00:02:13.950> some<00:02:14.130> research<00:02:14.459> behind<00:02:14.640> it<00:02:14.970> I

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
there was some research behind it I

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.660 
there was some research behind it I
think<00:02:15.239> yeah<00:02:16.050> you<00:02:16.800> know<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.220> sure<00:02:17.400> you<00:02:17.550> have

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
think yeah you know I'm sure you have

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.240 
think yeah you know I'm sure you have
bro<00:02:17.970> scientists<00:02:18.569> coming<00:02:18.750> in<00:02:18.930> making<00:02:19.530> clear

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:20.250 
bro scientists coming in making clear

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:23.840 
bro scientists coming in making clear
any<00:02:21.090> kind<00:02:21.390> of<00:02:21.620> backing<00:02:22.620> us<00:02:23.190> to<00:02:23.310> very<00:02:23.459> annoying

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
any kind of backing us to very annoying

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:26.990 
any kind of backing us to very annoying
oh<00:02:24.060> yeah<00:02:24.569> yeah<00:02:25.410> those<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.040> just<00:02:26.069> try<00:02:26.550> to<00:02:26.580> tend<00:02:26.880> to

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
oh yeah yeah those I just try to tend to

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.270 
oh yeah yeah those I just try to tend to
ignore<00:02:27.330> or<00:02:27.630> I'm<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:27.959> total<00:02:28.470> asshole<00:02:28.830> to<00:02:29.069> you

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
ignore or I'm a total asshole to you

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.470 
ignore or I'm a total asshole to you
so<00:02:29.540> it's<00:02:30.540> entertaining<00:02:31.050> with<00:02:31.950> just<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.819> got

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
so it's entertaining with just I got

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.180 
so it's entertaining with just I got
this<00:02:33.599> question<00:02:33.750> an<00:02:34.019> awful<00:02:34.319> lot<00:02:34.500> people<00:02:34.680> people

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
this question an awful lot people people

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.300 
this question an awful lot people people
tend<00:02:35.370> to<00:02:35.430> say<00:02:36.350> so<00:02:37.350> I<00:02:37.620> know<00:02:37.709> natural

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
tend to say so I know natural

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:41.570 
tend to say so I know natural

breakfast I needs carbs in the morning

breakfast I needs carbs in the morning
how'd<00:02:45.930> you<00:02:46.080> explain<00:02:46.350> that<00:02:48.290> good<00:02:49.290> genetics<00:02:50.269> I

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
how'd you explain that good genetics I

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.400 
how'd you explain that good genetics I
mean<00:02:52.680> I<00:02:52.709> know<00:02:52.890> people<00:02:53.220> like<00:02:53.459> that<00:02:53.640> too<00:02:53.910> and<00:02:54.410> the

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
mean I know people like that too and the

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.910 
mean I know people like that too and the
fact<00:02:55.769> that<00:02:56.630> they're<00:02:57.630> obvious<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.769> know<00:02:58.890> I

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
fact that they're obvious you know I

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.370 
fact that they're obvious you know I
know<00:02:59.160> people<00:02:59.790> who<00:03:00.030> eat<00:03:00.810> a<00:03:01.140> ton<00:03:01.350> of

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
know people who eat a ton of

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.460 
know people who eat a ton of
calories<00:03:01.620> and<00:03:02.190> go<00:03:02.459> out<00:03:02.610> and<00:03:02.819> run<00:03:03.180> 20<00:03:04.019> miles<00:03:04.319> a

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:04.470 
calories and go out and run 20 miles a

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:08.569 
calories and go out and run 20 miles a
day<00:03:04.500> and<00:03:05.239> they<00:03:06.650> they<00:03:07.650> just<00:03:07.890> always<00:03:08.070> stay<00:03:08.340> lean

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
day and they they just always stay lean

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:11.360 
day and they they just always stay lean
and<00:03:08.690> I<00:03:09.690> know<00:03:10.079> other<00:03:10.380> people<00:03:10.769> that<00:03:10.799> try<00:03:11.160> that

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
and I know other people that try that

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:15.020 
and I know other people that try that
and<00:03:11.579> they<00:03:11.820> look<00:03:11.970> like<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:13.730> those<00:03:14.730> people

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
and they look like so those people

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.240 
and they look like so those people
are<00:03:15.269> the<00:03:15.420> anomaly<00:03:16.019> and<00:03:16.260> that's<00:03:16.410> why<00:03:16.620> I<00:03:16.950> don't

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
are the anomaly and that's why I don't

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:18.680 
are the anomaly and that's why I don't
understand<00:03:17.609> why<00:03:17.760> people<00:03:18.120> will<00:03:18.239> pick<00:03:18.540> an

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
understand why people will pick an

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.390 
understand why people will pick an
anomaly<00:03:19.230> and<00:03:19.470> say<00:03:19.620> well<00:03:19.769> that<00:03:19.799> must<00:03:20.070> be<00:03:20.160> true

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
anomaly and say well that must be true

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:24.620 
anomaly and say well that must be true
for<00:03:20.549> everything<00:03:20.959> yeah<00:03:21.959> but<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.280> mean<00:03:23.880> one<00:03:24.180> just

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
for everything yeah but I mean one just

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:29.330 
for everything yeah but I mean one just
so<00:03:25.590> we<00:03:25.769> have<00:03:26.030> for<00:03:27.030> example<00:03:27.060> -<00:03:27.829> two<00:03:28.829> genes<00:03:29.190> that

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
so we have for example - two genes that

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.449 
so we have for example - two genes that
encode<00:03:29.640> for<00:03:29.820> myostatin<00:03:30.720> and<00:03:30.810> human<00:03:31.200> and<00:03:31.459> a

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
encode for myostatin and human and a

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.890 
encode for myostatin and human and a
mutation<00:03:33.030> in<00:03:33.329> just<00:03:33.540> one<00:03:33.810> of<00:03:33.959> those<00:03:34.109> genes

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
mutation in just one of those genes

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.479 
mutation in just one of those genes
makes<00:03:36.900> it<00:03:37.109> very<00:03:37.350> difficult<00:03:37.709> to<00:03:37.980> store<00:03:38.280> body

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:38.489 
makes it very difficult to store body

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:40.759 
makes it very difficult to store body
fat<00:03:38.820> and<00:03:39.000> very<00:03:39.570> easy<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.079> grow<00:03:40.200> muscle<00:03:40.440> mass

00:03:40.759 --> 00:03:40.769 
fat and very easy to grow muscle mass

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:44.750 
fat and very easy to grow muscle mass
and<00:03:41.070> that<00:03:41.820> mutation<00:03:42.030> is<00:03:42.480> not<00:03:42.540> uncommon<00:03:43.519> so<00:03:44.519> if

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
and that mutation is not uncommon so if

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.670 
and that mutation is not uncommon so if
you<00:03:44.910> find<00:03:45.120> one<00:03:45.239> of<00:03:45.390> those<00:03:45.600> people<00:03:46.350> they<00:03:46.470> have<00:03:46.650> a

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
you find one of those people they have a

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.650 
you find one of those people they have a
genetic<00:03:47.130> advantage<00:03:47.579> that's<00:03:47.819> better<00:03:48.090> than<00:03:48.329> any

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
genetic advantage that's better than any

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:54.530 
genetic advantage that's better than any
amount<00:03:48.959> of<00:03:49.190> steroids<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.489> person<00:03:50.940> could<00:03:51.090> take<00:03:53.540> I

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:54.540 
amount of steroids a person could take I

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:56.569 
amount of steroids a person could take I
mean<00:03:55.290> I<00:03:55.350> would<00:03:55.650> give<00:03:55.829> anything<00:03:56.100> for<00:03:56.310> that

00:03:56.569 --> 00:03:56.579 
mean I would give anything for that

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:59.599 
mean I would give anything for that
mutation<00:03:57.090> that<00:03:57.239> would<00:03:57.329> be<00:03:57.480> awesome<00:03:58.130> and<00:03:59.130> those

00:03:59.599 --> 00:03:59.609 
mutation that would be awesome and those

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:01.759 
mutation that would be awesome and those
are<00:03:59.819> the<00:03:59.910> people<00:04:00.060> that<00:04:00.530> you<00:04:01.530> know<00:04:01.620> they've

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
are the people that you know they've

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.379 
are the people that you know they've
they've<00:04:02.040> tested<00:04:02.459> bodybuilders<00:04:03.030> in<00:04:03.060> quite<00:04:03.359> a

00:04:03.379 --> 00:04:03.389 
they've tested bodybuilders in quite a

00:04:03.389 --> 00:04:05.300 
they've tested bodybuilders in quite a
few<00:04:03.450> professional<00:04:04.260> bodybuilders<00:04:04.769> have<00:04:05.069> that

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
few professional bodybuilders have that

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:08.690 
few professional bodybuilders have that
mutation<00:04:05.489> which<00:04:06.030> means<00:04:06.299> there<00:04:07.260> is<00:04:07.470> no<00:04:07.709> way<00:04:07.980> any

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
mutation which means there is no way any

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.849 
mutation which means there is no way any
normal<00:04:08.880> person<00:04:09.540> could<00:04:10.049> ever<00:04:10.290> get<00:04:10.500> on<00:04:10.590> stage

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
normal person could ever get on stage

normal person could ever get on stage
and<00:04:10.889> compete<00:04:11.280> against<00:04:11.549> them<00:04:11.730> I<00:04:11.909> don't<00:04:12.209> care

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
and compete against them I don't care

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.360 
and compete against them I don't care
what<00:04:12.629> they're<00:04:12.810> taking<00:04:13.170> or<00:04:13.260> what<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:13.650> it

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
what they're taking or what they do it

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.629 
what they're taking or what they do it
just<00:04:14.819> wouldn't<00:04:15.090> be<00:04:15.150> possible<00:04:15.349> well

00:04:17.629 --> 00:04:17.639 
just wouldn't be possible well

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:19.789 
just wouldn't be possible well
and<00:04:18.479> those<00:04:18.690> are<00:04:18.840> the<00:04:18.930> ones<00:04:19.109> you<00:04:19.259> get<00:04:19.380> compared

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
and those are the ones you get compared

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:21.170 
and those are the ones you get compared
to<00:04:19.919> it's<00:04:20.070> like<00:04:20.160> oh<00:04:20.280> well<00:04:20.579> I<00:04:20.609> know<00:04:20.699> this<00:04:20.910> guy<00:04:21.120> who

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:21.180 
to it's like oh well I know this guy who

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.540 
to it's like oh well I know this guy who
does<00:04:21.479> this<00:04:21.600> well<00:04:21.840> good<00:04:22.109> for<00:04:22.290> you<00:04:22.410> it's<00:04:23.100> not<00:04:23.340> me

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
does this well good for you it's not me

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.249 
does this well good for you it's not me
and<00:04:23.699> it's<00:04:23.850> not<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.240> because<00:04:24.570> if<00:04:24.690> it<00:04:24.810> was<00:04:25.020> you

and it's not you because if it was you

00:04:25.259 --> 00:04:26.870 
and it's not you because if it was you
you<00:04:25.500> wouldn't<00:04:25.770> be<00:04:25.889> talking<00:04:26.039> to<00:04:26.280> me<00:04:26.430> about<00:04:26.550> how

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:26.880 
you wouldn't be talking to me about how

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:38.719 
you wouldn't be talking to me about how
you<00:04:26.940> could<00:04:27.210> look<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:37.430> that's<00:04:38.430> a<00:04:38.550> great

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
you could look like that's a great

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.270 
you could look like that's a great
response<00:04:39.120> no<00:04:39.900> it's<00:04:40.080> the<00:04:40.800> thing<00:04:41.009> you<00:04:41.100> said

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:41.280 
response no it's the thing you said

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.629 
response no it's the thing you said
about<00:04:41.400> mTOR<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.150> just<00:04:42.600> blowing<00:04:43.530> my<00:04:43.710> mind

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
about mTOR is just blowing my mind

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.840 
about mTOR is just blowing my mind
so<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.600> can't<00:04:46.139> wait<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.350> read<00:04:46.440> the<00:04:46.590> article<00:04:47.009> yeah

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:47.850 
so I can't wait to read the article yeah

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:51.110 
so I can't wait to read the article yeah
we've<00:04:48.449> just<00:04:48.479> finished<00:04:48.750> a<00:04:49.020> series<00:04:49.620> on<00:04:49.970> the<00:04:50.970> day

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:51.120 
we've just finished a series on the day

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:59.150 
we've just finished a series on the day
fasting<00:04:51.570> they<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:52.080> ruined<00:04:52.229> it<00:04:57.860> it<00:04:58.860> doesn't

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
fasting they just ruined it it doesn't

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.860 
fasting they just ruined it it doesn't
take<00:04:59.280> a<00:04:59.310> lot<00:04:59.520> of<00:04:59.580> food<00:04:59.850> but<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.300> know<00:05:00.419> it<00:05:00.570> that

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
take a lot of food but you know it that

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.980 
take a lot of food but you know it that
14<00:05:01.380> hour<00:05:01.500> mark<00:05:01.919> and<00:05:02.130> even<00:05:02.430> at<00:05:03.060> 14<00:05:03.660> hours

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 
14 hour mark and even at 14 hours

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.340 
14 hour mark and even at 14 hours
there's<00:05:04.229> some<00:05:04.560> down-regulation<00:05:05.840> but<00:05:06.840> at<00:05:06.960> 24

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:07.350 
there's some down-regulation but at 24

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:08.719 
there's some down-regulation but at 24
hours<00:05:07.650> it's<00:05:07.830> just<00:05:08.039> shut<00:05:08.250> off<00:05:08.280> and

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:08.729 
hours it's just shut off and

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:10.490 
hours it's just shut off and
downregulated<00:05:09.090> which<00:05:09.630> means<00:05:09.870> your<00:05:10.110> your

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
downregulated which means your your

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:11.600 
downregulated which means your your
body's<00:05:10.770> more<00:05:10.919> than<00:05:11.099> happy<00:05:11.310> to<00:05:11.340> start

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
body's more than happy to start

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:16.670 
body's more than happy to start
destroying<00:05:11.940> muscle<00:05:12.330> tissue<00:05:15.349> fasts<00:05:16.349> although

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:16.680 
destroying muscle tissue fasts although

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:18.439 
destroying muscle tissue fasts although
there<00:05:16.860> are<00:05:17.009> sort<00:05:17.250> of<00:05:17.340> additional<00:05:18.090> health

00:05:18.439 --> 00:05:18.449 
there are sort of additional health

00:05:18.449 --> 00:05:20.029 
there are sort of additional health
benefits<00:05:18.900> associated<00:05:19.110> with<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.650> we<00:05:19.770> tend<00:05:19.949> to

00:05:20.029 --> 00:05:20.039 
benefits associated with it we tend to

00:05:20.039 --> 00:05:23.839 
benefits associated with it we tend to
stop<00:05:20.280> at<00:05:20.460> 24<00:05:21.560> for<00:05:22.560> adherence<00:05:22.979> reasons<00:05:23.280> and<00:05:23.460> for

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:23.849 
stop at 24 for adherence reasons and for

00:05:23.849 --> 00:05:27.110 
stop at 24 for adherence reasons and for
sort<00:05:24.210> of<00:05:24.270> muscle<00:05:25.229> retention<00:05:25.800> but<00:05:26.340> that<00:05:26.910> thing

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:27.120 
sort of muscle retention but that thing

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.290 
sort of muscle retention but that thing
about<00:05:27.330> just<00:05:27.780> having<00:05:28.050> some<00:05:28.349> rate<00:05:28.500> isolate<00:05:28.919> to

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
about just having some rate isolate to

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.140 
about just having some rate isolate to
to<00:05:30.300> start<00:05:30.570> and<00:05:31.560> to<00:05:31.740> a<00:05:31.770> down<00:05:31.979> regulation<00:05:32.520> is<00:05:32.669> is

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
to start and to a down regulation is is

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.689 
to start and to a down regulation is is
very<00:05:33.389> interesting<00:05:33.930> yeah<00:05:34.860> yeah<00:05:35.250> well<00:05:35.490> it

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:35.699 
very interesting yeah yeah well it

00:05:35.699 --> 00:05:37.550 
very interesting yeah yeah well it
doesn't<00:05:36.210> seem<00:05:36.570> to<00:05:36.720> take<00:05:36.870> much<00:05:37.080> food<00:05:37.320> and

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:37.560 
doesn't seem to take much food and

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:41.240 
doesn't seem to take much food and
especially<00:05:38.010> if<00:05:38.370> you<00:05:38.520> add<00:05:39.650> the<00:05:40.650> component<00:05:41.190> of

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:41.250 
especially if you add the component of

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.040 
especially if you add the component of
the<00:05:41.340> way<00:05:41.490> that<00:05:41.699> works<00:05:41.880> very<00:05:42.449> well<00:05:42.539> is<00:05:42.900> the

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.050 
the way that works very well is the

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:45.670 
the way that works very well is the
leucine<00:05:43.500> component<00:05:44.070> so<00:05:44.250> you<00:05:44.340> could

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:45.680 
leucine component so you could

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:50.570 
leucine component so you could
technically<00:05:46.680> just<00:05:47.070> add<00:05:47.400> leucine<00:05:49.280> I'm<00:05:50.280> not

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
technically just add leucine I'm not

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.210 
technically just add leucine I'm not
sure<00:05:50.820> how<00:05:51.000> that<00:05:51.060> would<00:05:51.300> fare<00:05:51.690> I<00:05:52.220> haven't

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:53.220 
sure how that would fare I haven't

00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.860 
sure how that would fare I haven't
experimented<00:05:53.610> with<00:05:53.970> that<00:05:54.270> but<00:05:54.479> if<00:05:54.630> you<00:05:54.750> guys

00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:54.870 
experimented with that but if you guys

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:56.180 
experimented with that but if you guys
want<00:05:55.050> to<00:05:55.199> experiment<00:05:55.500> with<00:05:55.830> it<00:05:55.860> and<00:05:56.039> tell<00:05:56.130> me

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
want to experiment with it and tell me

00:05:56.190 --> 00:06:00.320 
want to experiment with it and tell me
what<00:05:56.400> happens<00:05:56.729> go<00:05:56.970> for<00:05:57.180> it<00:05:57.530> has<00:05:58.530> been<00:05:59.300> he<00:06:00.300> said

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:00.330 
what happens go for it has been he said

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:02.510 
what happens go for it has been he said
he<00:06:00.570> it<00:06:00.810> bumped<00:06:01.320> himself<00:06:01.620> into<00:06:01.800> ketosis<00:06:02.010> very

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
he it bumped himself into ketosis very

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.600 
he it bumped himself into ketosis very
rapidly<00:06:03.139> he<00:06:04.139> was<00:06:04.289> testing<00:06:04.620> his<00:06:04.740> blood<00:06:05.190> sugar

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:05.610 
rapidly he was testing his blood sugar

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:08.149 
rapidly he was testing his blood sugar
mm-hm<00:06:06.120> and<00:06:06.440> he<00:06:07.440> said<00:06:07.620> that<00:06:07.740> he<00:06:07.830> just<00:06:07.860> felt

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
mm-hm and he said that he just felt

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:08.600 
mm-hm and he said that he just felt
horrible

00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:08.610 
horrible

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.439 
horrible
having<00:06:09.030> leucine<00:06:09.510> on<00:06:09.599> its<00:06:09.750> own<00:06:11.449> actually

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:12.449 
having leucine on its own actually

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:13.790 
having leucine on its own actually
doesn't<00:06:12.840> surprise<00:06:13.110> me<00:06:13.139> because<00:06:13.440> it'll<00:06:13.590> give

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:13.800 
doesn't surprise me because it'll give

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:15.529 
doesn't surprise me because it'll give
you<00:06:13.889> a<00:06:13.949> decent<00:06:14.340> little<00:06:14.610> influence<00:06:14.970> pike<00:06:15.330> to

00:06:15.529 --> 00:06:15.539 
you a decent little influence pike to

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:19.909 
you a decent little influence pike to
you<00:06:15.630> okay<00:06:16.970> so<00:06:17.970> I<00:06:18.630> can't<00:06:19.229> imagine<00:06:19.320> that<00:06:19.590> that's

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:19.919 
you okay so I can't imagine that that's
