00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.180
 Hi guys 

00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.439
 I'm a teacher, I'm naive, this is my first tutorial 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.250
 let's start bolivia is to show you how to change the homonymous name first 

00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:14.300
 nothing should have many and do not download some and watch this video step 1 you will know 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.460
 his folder of grand theft auto san andreas and his folder stated this is 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:22.490
 useful if they have many much maybe they are reversed some keys declared 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.210
 despite its success 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.460
 administrator 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.460
 go eat and look for san diego and denver 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.430
 download the first file them 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.910
 I do not do it because I already have it installed 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.520
 xddd 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.330
 installed will have something like this 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.330
 lea downtown 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.420
 how this was going to be 

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:26.420
 pizarro create his own writings 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.150
 step 3 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.000
 ap in your folder from today 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
 mention between maxwell 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.720
 today, what will be the same? 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.720
 you can not avoid this 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.490
 I love you the white space and appear 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:51.490
 and now we have to avoid it 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.590
 difficult to avoid just look for a hotel and the mandatory 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.310
 look in the description 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.420
 if you download from a text file that's the code is the first and 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.670
 type of numbers that represent each letter of the keyboard 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.550
 here you will see that there are many different varieties of numbers that represent 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.760
 something in Cuba etcetera selection in which they are given the gift wins and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.760
 you will keep an eye on the number 

00:02:19.289 --> 00:02:22.069
 the mayor 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.150
 I select in alestra which is marked with the number 111 of the code 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:30.090
 Ascii starts with the number 32 and ends with 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.090
 the number 127 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:36.879
 this code contains 

00:02:43.309 --> 00:02:46.309
 look here 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:49.509
 we draw 

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:52.509
 is after the psc 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.159
 as well as correct a manuscript text 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:11.309
 bernanke substituted 

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:13.219
 it's not as difficult as they are 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:17.189
 so we can start after we can finish creating our own 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:22.629
 it's hard to think that replacing something can do such a thing as doing more 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 easy to build english 

00:03:26.889 --> 00:03:31.499
 the favorable to a guy to do is install only 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:33.879
 the genocide 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:36.169
 now it's backed up and installed 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:39.169
 now they can have fun improved consumption 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.370
 good friends I think that has been all comment 

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.489

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:52.450
