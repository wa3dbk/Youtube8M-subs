allows you to well on your network you
may<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.309> different<00:00:14.759> computers<00:00:15.120> like<00:00:15.299> i<00:00:15.420> have

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540 
may have different computers like i have

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.200 
may have different computers like i have
a<00:00:15.570> macbook<00:00:15.900> pro<00:00:16.350> in<00:00:16.619> an<00:00:16.949> imac<00:00:17.310> you<00:00:17.580> can

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
a macbook pro in an imac you can

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.140 
a macbook pro in an imac you can
wirelessly<00:00:18.510> over<00:00:19.050> your<00:00:19.770> one<00:00:20.369> phone<00:00:20.670> network

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
wirelessly over your one phone network

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.720 
wirelessly over your one phone network
the<00:00:21.630> same<00:00:21.840> network<00:00:22.170> i'm<00:00:22.439> using<00:00:23.130> between<00:00:23.580> both

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
the same network i'm using between both

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.599 
the same network i'm using between both
computers<00:00:24.350> transfer<00:00:25.350> files<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:26.010> it<00:00:26.430> works

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
computers transfer files and it works

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.490 
computers transfer files and it works
with<00:00:26.760> small<00:00:27.150> big<00:00:27.420> whatever<00:00:27.960> kind<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.260> files

going<00:00:36.329> to<00:00:36.420> be<00:00:36.570> able<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.809> show<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.020> both

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
going to be able to show you both

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.020 
going to be able to show you both
computers<00:00:37.770> but<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.700> gonna<00:00:38.820> have<00:00:38.969> to

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
computers but you just gonna have to

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:40.850 
computers but you just gonna have to
trust<00:00:39.059> me<00:00:39.360> I'll<00:00:39.510> kind<00:00:39.750> of<00:00:39.840> show<00:00:40.050> proof<00:00:40.559> in<00:00:40.739> this

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
trust me I'll kind of show proof in this

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.610 
trust me I'll kind of show proof in this
way<00:00:41.040> so<00:00:41.610> there's<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.270> little<00:00:42.450> circle<00:00:43.260> here

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
way so there's this little circle here

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.229 
way so there's this little circle here
you<00:00:43.829> can<00:00:43.950> move<00:00:44.070> it<00:00:44.190> wherever<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.520> want<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.000> just

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
you can move it wherever you want I just

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.479 
you can move it wherever you want I just
like<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.420> up<00:00:45.600> there<00:00:45.780> and<00:00:46.280> it's<00:00:47.280> pretty

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
like it up there and it's pretty

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.840 
like it up there and it's pretty
transparent<00:00:48.860> but<00:00:49.860> you<00:00:49.980> drag<00:00:50.219> a<00:00:50.250> file<00:00:50.520> in<00:00:50.730> there

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
transparent but you drag a file in there

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.639 
transparent but you drag a file in there
and<00:00:51.120> it'll<00:00:51.300> show<00:00:51.360> show<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.410> different

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and it'll show show the different

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:53.840 
and it'll show show the different
computers<00:00:52.920> on<00:00:53.100> your<00:00:53.129> network<00:00:53.250> so<00:00:53.610> if<00:00:53.670> you<00:00:53.730> had

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
computers on your network so if you had

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.180 
computers on your network so if you had
many<00:00:54.090> you<00:00:54.270> could<00:00:54.420> kind<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:55.010> drag<00:00:56.010> it<00:00:56.160> to

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
many you could kind of drag it to

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.939 
many you could kind of drag it to
whatever<00:00:56.489> computer<00:00:57.000> you<00:00:57.149> want<00:00:57.420> but<00:00:58.350> I<00:00:58.379> want<00:00:58.739> my

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
whatever computer you want but I want my

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:03.619 
whatever computer you want but I want my
my<00:00:59.879> iMac<00:01:00.270> and<00:01:01.699> there<00:01:02.699> we<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.120> it<00:01:03.300> makes<00:01:03.420> a

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
my iMac and there we go it makes a

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.740 
my iMac and there we go it makes a
pretty<00:01:03.840> cool<00:01:04.110> sound<00:01:04.439> and<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.369> on<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:06.000> imac<00:01:06.479> it

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
pretty cool sound and it's on my imac it

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.870 
pretty cool sound and it's on my imac it

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
just copies the file leaves it on your

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.250 
just copies the file leaves it on your

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:21.510 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.510 

and<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:22.230> I<00:01:22.260> just<00:01:22.410> sent<00:01:22.770> it<00:01:22.830> from<00:01:22.920> my<00:01:23.010> iMac<00:01:23.370> and

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
and now I just sent it from my iMac and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.220 
and now I just sent it from my iMac and
there<00:01:24.060> we<00:01:24.180> go<00:01:24.300> this<00:01:24.510> is<00:01:24.660> what<00:01:24.780> it<00:01:24.870> looks<00:01:25.050> like

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:25.230 
there we go this is what it looks like

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:27.700 
there we go this is what it looks like
when<00:01:25.470> you<00:01:25.590> drag<00:01:25.830> file<00:01:26.190> onto<00:01:26.490> your<00:01:26.760> computer

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
when you drag file onto your computer

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:34.460 
when you drag file onto your computer
this<00:01:28.710> is<00:01:28.890> pretty<00:01:29.370> damn<00:01:29.940> cool<00:01:31.790> yeah<00:01:33.320> shows<00:01:34.320> up

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
this is pretty damn cool yeah shows up

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.260 
this is pretty damn cool yeah shows up
on<00:01:34.590> your<00:01:34.620> desktop<00:01:35.040> I<00:01:35.310> think<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.000> can<00:01:36.150> actually

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
on your desktop I think you can actually

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.240 
on your desktop I think you can actually
change<00:01:36.570> the<00:01:36.720> file<00:01:37.080> destination<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:37.890> not<00:01:38.070> it's

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
change the file destination if not it's

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.800 
change the file destination if not it's
not<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> big<00:01:38.700> of<00:01:38.760> a<00:01:38.880> deal<00:01:39.060> at<00:01:39.330> all<00:01:41.060> but<00:01:42.060> yeah<00:01:42.510> I

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
not that big of a deal at all but yeah I

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.990 
not that big of a deal at all but yeah I
definitely<00:01:43.620> recommend<00:01:44.190> getting<00:01:44.550> this<00:01:44.760> it's

called<00:02:14.160> that<00:02:14.310> but<00:02:14.730> with<00:02:15.090> the<00:02:15.390> original<00:02:15.600> drop
