00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:15.720 
ones and I thought about these ones but

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:17.839 
ones and I thought about these ones but
I'm<00:04:16.440> not<00:04:16.620> a<00:04:16.650> hundred<00:04:16.829> percent<00:04:17.039> sure<00:04:17.310> yet<00:04:17.669> so

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
I'm not a hundred percent sure yet so

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.129 
I'm not a hundred percent sure yet so
these<00:04:17.970> are<00:04:18.090> kind<00:04:18.209> of<00:04:18.269> like<00:04:18.450> gonna<00:04:18.780> be<00:04:18.900> on<00:04:19.019> my

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:19.139 
these are kind of like gonna be on my

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.779 
these are kind of like gonna be on my
maybe<00:04:19.410> less<00:04:19.709> filling<00:04:20.130> most<00:04:20.280> this<00:04:20.459> all<00:04:20.639> of

00:04:20.779 --> 00:04:20.789 
maybe less filling most this all of

00:04:20.789 --> 00:04:22.490 
maybe less filling most this all of
stuff<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.090> I<00:04:21.150> don't<00:04:21.209> like<00:04:21.719> or<00:04:21.989> maybe<00:04:22.140> taking

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
stuff that I don't like or maybe taking

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:24.770 
stuff that I don't like or maybe taking
back<00:04:22.680> but<00:04:23.190> and<00:04:23.430> I<00:04:23.849> guess<00:04:24.270> it's<00:04:24.450> going<00:04:24.599> to<00:04:24.690> kind

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:24.780 
back but and I guess it's going to kind

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:26.089 
back but and I guess it's going to kind
of<00:04:24.900> a<00:04:24.930> good<00:04:25.080> way<00:04:25.200> to<00:04:25.260> show<00:04:25.440> you<00:04:25.620> the<00:04:25.860> things

00:04:26.089 --> 00:04:26.099 
of a good way to show you the things

00:04:26.099 --> 00:04:26.970 
of a good way to show you the things
that<00:04:26.280> I<00:04:26.310> kind<00:04:26.789> of

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:26.980 
that I kind of

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.010 
that I kind of
pic<00:04:27.070> online<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.700> then<00:04:27.820> maybe<00:04:28.540> don't<00:04:28.780> keep

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
pic online and then maybe don't keep

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.290 
pic online and then maybe don't keep
because<00:04:29.530> I<00:04:29.740> don't<00:04:29.980> know<00:04:30.040> no<00:04:30.730> that's<00:04:31.030> the<00:04:31.120> rules

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
because I don't know no that's the rules

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.390 
because I don't know no that's the rules
of<00:04:31.450> doing<00:04:31.660> a<00:04:31.750> whole<00:04:31.930> video<00:04:32.110> but<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.800> don't<00:04:33.340> know

of doing a whole video but I don't know

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.950 
of doing a whole video but I don't know
guess<00:04:33.580> we<00:04:33.700> can<00:04:33.850> make<00:04:33.970> up<00:04:34.090> our<00:04:34.210> own<00:04:34.240> rules<00:04:34.600> but

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960
