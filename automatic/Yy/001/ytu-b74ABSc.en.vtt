 do not 

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:12.110
 hello all welcome to roxanne art 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.540
 this time I want to show you how 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.670
 make some very decorative squares 

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.430
 beautiful so that you can give away 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.460
 or decorate in your house first of all 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:24.140
 let's get some small canvases 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:26.300
 they can be the size they like / 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.060
 they can be tiny, not the problem 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:33.039
 we are going to use acrylics of which 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.039
 you like brushes 

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.500
 and a little water to mix the 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:41.680
 acrylic good first of all dilute 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.150
 a little paint and we started to cover 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.150
 very good our canvases 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.920
 you have to paint the edges too 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.700
 and some colors may stay a little 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.850
 of course you have to wait for it to dry 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.420
 give you two good passes since we have 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.380
 our canvases ready well painted and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.080
 dry we are going to place them on a table and 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.440
 I collected some plants some branches 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.360
 that cut and flatten them previously with 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.460
 I placed some books on top of them 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.800
 table and I put some books so that 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.230
 they were a bit flat 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.950
 we already select the ones that we like the most 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:29.520
 we place them on our canvas 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:32.130
 and we are going to paste them with a little tape 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.800
 this tape does not mistreat acrylic well 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:39.180
 that I recommend them 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:43.110
 they already paste it very well they place it on their 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:46.110
 canvas that is very well accommodated 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:49.170
 then in a place that is ventilated 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.380
 let's apply it on top of me I put a 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.010
 acrylic enamel spray enamel 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.820
 golden tone 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.450
 we already cover it well be careful not to 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.980
 breathe a lot this spray and do it 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.980
 in a place with a lot of ventilation 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:11.950
 since we cover our four canvases 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:14.350
 they will be more or less like that and I 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.140
 then with some black acrylic and 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.420
 a thin brush delineates each of 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.480
 the leaves sometimes I had to improvise a 

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:25.450
 little because you did not notice much but this 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.160
 it gives more presence it gives as a highlight 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.330
 the figure 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:33.010
 and it makes it look very beautiful and original 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:35.800
 and also as the form is already 

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.250
 you are not going to battle so much in power 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.250
 to draw 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.440
 you can do two or three or the 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.800
 who want I made four in this 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.800
 chance 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:53.280
 and see how pretty they are left with 

00:02:50.519 --> 00:02:55.680
 very bright colors the gold gives a lot 

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:58.500
 a lot of elegance and I hope there will be 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.140
