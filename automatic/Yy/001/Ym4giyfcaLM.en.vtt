00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:11.400
 we talk about the saddle we talk about 

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:15.160
 thirst adjustment the height of the 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:19.550
 saddle and of his 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.949
 there is a mathematical rule that you give us 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:24.770
 an indication of the saddle height e 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.750
 measure your horse and height 

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:30.770
 of your horse you multiply 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:33.829
 this of height for 0.885 and this there 

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:35.930
 gives an indication of the height of the 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:38.690
 saddle that will then amaze some 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:40.100
 small variation depending on the 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.280
 feelings and preferences 

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.280
 individual 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:49.550
 obviously it's not so comfortable to measure e 

00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:52.190
 improve your horse because 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.350
 actually requires equipment 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.719
 that normally at home is not why 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.120
 there is a rule of thumb that in general 

00:00:56.719 --> 00:01:01.429
 it works quite well and therefore 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.040
 may be suitable for the use of a 

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:07.610
 city â€‹â€‹bike bikes on which anyway 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:11.690
 we wo n't stay for hours and that's about 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:14.900
 get in the saddle meters stallion on the south 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:18.550
 on the pedal and putting the pedal in 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:21.740
 continuation of the tube in the frame 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:25.010
 with the leg must be must be 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:27.230
 expanse this or vidali sauna first is 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.450
 acceptable indication of correct 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.130
 seat height checked then 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.250
 at the same time with this 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.640
 can you rest your feet for 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.130
 land 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.160
 if not in itself not so if it were not so 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.710
 and reduce slightly the height of the 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:46.130
 saddle so you can avoid falling 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.770
 in the event of sudden braking braking 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.500
 obviously who uses a racing bike 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:53.510
 and remains remains on the racing bike for 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.120
 a few hours will have to do a correct one 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:58.760
 measurement of your horse and not from 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:02:01.400
 precise measurement of the height of the 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:05.240
 saddle that we won't even do with a 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.110
 meter but with even more tools 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.209
 more precise than they give us 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.670
 an indication with a margin of error 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:15.660
 really wine 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.610
 we said we verify the height 

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.970
 multiply their horse by 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.819
 0.085 once we did this 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.080
 measure we can then verify with m ci 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.640
 they are also professional tools 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:32.770
 that allow you to position the saddle 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.180
 with more precision you see this 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.230
 tool a centimeter scale 

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:40.239
 graduated if supported by the center 

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.670
 of the pedals we can go to 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:46.209
 check that the saddle height is 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:49.060
 corrected once verified 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:52.000
 correct height we must verify the 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.959
 correct inclination the apex obviously 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:57.780
 must be level and with a level 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:03:00.510
 we're going to check that the saddle is 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.400
 slightly tilted forward or 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.450
 perfectly flat and will never have to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.769
 be the highest point of the point 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:10.390
 of support because otherwise the 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:14.440
 position to results extremely 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:16.780
 uncomfortable and also and also painful for 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.150
 adjust the correct application 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.860
 we act on google and in this case one 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.070
 alone in another of lg if I am 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:27.100
 can be two positioned and below 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.360
 the carriage will loosen the Allen screw 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:32.890
 this will allow you to move the more 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.250
 of the clamp asking who asks 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.980
 locked the saddle and then to adjust 

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:40.840
 you believe its correct inclination 

00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:43.450
 also realize that the saddle can also 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.850
 move slightly forward e 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.430
 back so if you have the feeling 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.890
 to be too close 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:55.609
 you can slightly away from the saddle 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:58.730
 or vice versa you can approach and hold 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:04:03.500
 account that they are small adjustments and 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:06.739
 not on the 6s, so here on the chairs 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.389
 we say technical and always indicated in the 

00:04:06.739 --> 00:04:11.090
 ski nation is mild maximum that it is 

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:14.120
 can be done to be able to use 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.039
 the security office one last 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.720
 recommendation regarding the 

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:19.940
 saddle position 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:22.039
 check that it is correct 

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:24.830
 align that therefore it is truth 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:26.690
 if you see that the tip tends 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.630
 slightly on one side from the other i 

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:31.580
 give up the register life 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:32.479
 position it 6 correctly and a 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:35.120
 this point 

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.639
 close the resistent screw and I would say 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:40.030
 that on the saddle of the fundamental things 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:40.030
 the devils
