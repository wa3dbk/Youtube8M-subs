and gradually lift off into this wet
paint<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.070> this<00:01:17.220> will<00:01:17.430> just<00:01:17.640> really<00:01:18.060> give<00:01:18.450> us

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
paint and this will just really give us

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:24.490 
paint and this will just really give us
a<00:01:18.689> nice<00:01:20.240> smooth<00:01:21.240> finish

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.840 

see<00:01:25.500> how<00:01:25.619> I<00:01:25.650> rotate<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.250> brush<00:01:26.400> a<00:01:26.520> little<00:01:26.610> bit

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
see how I rotate the brush a little bit

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.940 
see how I rotate the brush a little bit
just<00:01:27.030> get<00:01:27.210> those<00:01:27.360> bristles<00:01:27.799> lay<00:01:28.799> them<00:01:28.920> flat

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
just get those bristles lay them flat

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.330 
just get those bristles lay them flat
down<00:01:29.610> in<00:01:29.820> that<00:01:29.970> channel<00:01:30.710> nice<00:01:31.710> long<00:01:32.009> even

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
down in that channel nice long even

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.550 
down in that channel nice long even
stroke<00:01:36.590> flat<00:01:38.540> so<00:01:39.540> we're<00:01:39.659> just<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.200> doing

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
stroke flat so we're just really doing

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.370 
stroke flat so we're just really doing
those<00:01:40.799> small<00:01:41.250> sections<00:01:41.990> keeping<00:01:42.990> this<00:01:43.140> wet

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
those small sections keeping this wet

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:51.040 
those small sections keeping this wet
edge

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.050 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.240 

and<00:01:52.050> we're<00:01:52.229> not<00:01:52.380> worried<00:01:52.680> about<00:01:52.740> getting<00:01:53.159> it

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
and we're not worried about getting it

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:55.219 
and we're not worried about getting it
up<00:01:53.340> on<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> walls<00:01:53.880> here<00:01:54.300> because<00:01:55.020> we're<00:01:55.140> gonna

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
up on the walls here because we're gonna

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.399 
up on the walls here because we're gonna
mask<00:01:55.620> this<00:01:55.860> base<00:01:56.190> off<00:01:56.900> and<00:01:57.900> we<00:01:57.990> talked<00:01:58.260> about

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
mask this base off and we talked about

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.320 
mask this base off and we talked about
sequencing<00:01:59.190> you<00:01:59.520> know<00:01:59.670> painting<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.150> trim

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
sequencing you know painting the trim

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.240 
sequencing you know painting the trim
I'm<00:02:00.930> asking<00:02:01.320> it<00:02:01.440> off<00:02:01.560> and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:01.860> painting<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
I'm asking it off and then painting the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.940 
I'm asking it off and then painting the
walls<00:02:02.690> some<00:02:03.690> people<00:02:04.020> do<00:02:04.170> choose<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.619> do<00:02:04.770> their
