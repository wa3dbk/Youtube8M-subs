00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
original case which is always a plus and

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.589 
original case which is always a plus and
two<00:03:40.319> more<00:03:40.500> things<00:03:40.769> in<00:03:41.010> the<00:03:41.099> box<00:03:41.340> this<00:03:42.239> is<00:03:42.419> the

00:03:42.589 --> 00:03:42.599 
two more things in the box this is the

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:46.369 
two more things in the box this is the
tap<00:03:42.840> for<00:03:43.340> the<00:03:44.340> PSP<00:03:44.720> which<00:03:45.720> is<00:03:45.930> pretty<00:03:46.139> awesome

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
tap for the PSP which is pretty awesome

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.119 
tap for the PSP which is pretty awesome
it<00:03:46.769> resembles<00:03:47.489> a<00:03:47.930> little<00:03:48.930> sackboy<00:03:49.680> body<00:03:50.010> I

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:50.129 
it resembles a little sackboy body I

00:03:50.129 --> 00:03:52.129 
it resembles a little sackboy body I
guess<00:03:50.459> so<00:03:51.209> that's<00:03:51.389> pretty<00:03:51.660> cool

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
guess so that's pretty cool

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:58.360 
guess so that's pretty cool
and<00:03:52.940> there's<00:03:53.940> one<00:03:54.150> more<00:03:54.329> item<00:03:54.540> in<00:03:54.959> the<00:03:55.290> box

00:03:58.360 --> 00:03:58.370 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:02.150 

which<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.730> the<00:04:00.239> little<00:04:01.160> LittleBigPlanet

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
which is the little LittleBigPlanet

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.129 
which is the little LittleBigPlanet
screen<00:04:02.549> white<00:04:02.730> which<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.239> guess<00:04:03.449> just<00:04:03.750> connects

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
screen white which I guess just connects

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:07.430 
screen white which I guess just connects
to<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.530> side<00:04:04.799> of<00:04:04.919> the<00:04:04.980> PSP<00:04:06.019> so<00:04:07.019> that's<00:04:07.199> pretty

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
to the side of the PSP so that's pretty

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.170 
to the side of the PSP so that's pretty
cool<00:04:07.739> I<00:04:07.889> probably<00:04:08.129> won't<00:04:08.370> attach<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:08.970> to<00:04:09.090> the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
cool I probably won't attach it to the

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.479 
cool I probably won't attach it to the
PSP<00:04:09.510> but<00:04:10.169> still<00:04:10.470> that's<00:04:10.590> pretty<00:04:10.799> awesome<00:04:11.129> to

00:04:11.479 --> 00:04:11.489 
PSP but still that's pretty awesome to

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:13.430 
PSP but still that's pretty awesome to
have<00:04:11.669> all<00:04:12.180> right<00:04:12.239> so<00:04:12.599> I<00:04:12.629> have<00:04:12.870> unwrapped

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
have all right so I have unwrapped

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:15.319 
have all right so I have unwrapped
everything<00:04:13.919> so<00:04:14.250> we'll<00:04:14.400> take<00:04:14.609> a<00:04:14.639> closer<00:04:15.150> look

00:04:15.319 --> 00:04:15.329 
everything so we'll take a closer look

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:19.339 
everything so we'll take a closer look
before<00:04:15.660> we<00:04:15.930> get<00:04:16.049> into<00:04:16.470> the<00:04:16.739> system<00:04:17.099> itself<00:04:18.349> so

00:04:19.339 --> 00:04:19.349 
before we get into the system itself so

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:21.080 
before we get into the system itself so

it's just the screen wire which attaches

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:53.280 
it's just the screen wire which attaches
to<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.740> PSP<00:04:49.780> so<00:04:50.780> that's<00:04:50.960> pretty<00:04:51.260> cute<00:04:52.090> and
