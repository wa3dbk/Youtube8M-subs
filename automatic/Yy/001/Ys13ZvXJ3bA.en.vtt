00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.540

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:22.919
 so here is this server mercy for diana lim 

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:25.519
 we are loading the server like this 

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:29.579
 intraosseous server 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:33.949
 on let's go in to write 

00:00:29.579 --> 00:00:33.949
 lucky and your password 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:58.790
 this moment will cost me only 4 4 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:01:04.430
 mark so here we are now so here we are 

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:07.610
 moved on it became so screaming from 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:11.600
 there are commands we can go to 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:17.840
 creative mode desires and mode 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:22.660
 adventures so oh well let's choose 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:30.530
 all ace smoothly go to mode 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:39.979
 creative so on need to wait 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:46.000
 gay fashion and one so it passed 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:46.000
 creative so 

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:53.170
 well, well, well 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.780
 there is some dude and why is it worth 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:06.340
 just pete 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:08.740
 whether I have the beat since on the server 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.000
 a lot of buildings for and for that you 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.390
 perhaps it will be required 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:16.230
 maybe on the internet so well let's 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.230
 the smallest 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:25.930
 be able to break here but again not 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.750
 we see almost everywhere he considers private so 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:37.540
 Here is definitely not in privat can see 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:39.580
 so let's just dynamite so on just 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.050
 These blocks put the protection more precisely on 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.060
 these blocks put up protection 

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:49.510
 yes and small too okay what is it like 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:50.230
 We see Richardson minutes to give 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:58.080
 just stupid 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:03:01.570
 break very stupidly smash the building on 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:05.950
 the building is very stupid and glass is acceptable 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:11.950
 to litter the server to yesterday's stage 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:15.400
 clogged to give them as we could 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:19.959
 would have been looking for construction not for 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.709
 habitual breaking them but it was a bottle 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:27.700
 plan let's just try so 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:31.209
 put on hot so many things you 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:33.510
 with her glass blocks very very 

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.510
 lot 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:43.590
 try to make the portal both trick 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:49.299
 all will not forget it 

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:57.400
 it is done like so here 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:59.870
 so so there seems to be gold starring 

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:02.829
 maybe the portal to hell is also worth 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.829
 kant protection 

00:04:03.159 --> 00:04:07.689
 so mid you can post the reactor 

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:20.120
 like so 

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:22.570
 cottage is not exactly saying so let's 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.570
 we press 

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:30.860
 yes I did it wrong 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.860
 portal 

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:45.000
 like an eye husband 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:51.360
 converted so so so so what 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:55.169
 about walks on the radio so yes there from above 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:58.080
 we cover with yellow 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:04.380
 not that seems to me the first portal was 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:05.360
 rather than this when there is no reason 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:10.440
 manage to enter 

00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:12.930
 okay what you saw folders cut 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:15.180
 mills managed lancet and just 

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:18.260
 take a walk on the server 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:18.260
