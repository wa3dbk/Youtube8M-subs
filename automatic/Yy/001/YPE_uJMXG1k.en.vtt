and he comes in on the left you have to
make<00:00:29.810> sense<00:00:30.140> I<00:00:30.439> said<00:00:30.769> look<00:00:31.720> who<00:00:32.720> cares<00:00:33.170> that

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:33.970 
make sense I said look who cares that

00:00:33.970 --> 00:00:37.060 
make sense I said look who cares that
non<00:00:34.970> sequitur<00:00:35.600> nature<00:00:35.990> of<00:00:36.110> play<00:00:36.410> is<00:00:36.800> something

infinity

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.670 

and<00:00:55.210> we're<00:00:55.450> probably<00:00:55.600> gonna<00:00:55.810> punch<00:00:56.140> on<00:00:56.290> this<00:00:56.470> I

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:56.680 
and we're probably gonna punch on this I

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.800 
and we're probably gonna punch on this I
think<00:00:56.830> back<00:00:57.100> the<00:00:57.580> genesis<00:00:58.030> of<00:00:58.180> the<00:00:58.300> toy<00:00:58.630> box

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:58.810 
think back the genesis of the toy box

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.350 
think back the genesis of the toy box
that<00:00:59.350> came<00:00:59.500> from<00:00:59.620> the<00:00:59.770> Toy<00:00:59.920> Story<00:01:00.190> 3<00:01:00.250> we<00:01:01.060> wanted

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:01.360 
that came from the Toy Story 3 we wanted

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:02.760 
that came from the Toy Story 3 we wanted
to<00:01:01.450> do<00:01:01.600> something<00:01:02.020> that<00:01:02.140> was<00:01:02.230> much<00:01:02.350> more<00:01:02.620> than

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:02.770 
to do something that was much more than

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:04.710 
to do something that was much more than
just<00:01:03.010> kind<00:01:03.460> of<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.670> see<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.089> movie<00:01:04.360> play<00:01:04.570> the

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:04.720 
just kind of that see the movie play the

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.500 
just kind of that see the movie play the
game<00:01:04.930> mentality<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:06.000> with<00:01:07.000> Toy<00:01:07.180> Story<00:01:07.240> 3

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:07.510 
game mentality and with Toy Story 3

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:09.630 
game mentality and with Toy Story 3
showed<00:01:07.990> us<00:01:08.170> is<00:01:08.320> that<00:01:08.620> all<00:01:08.890> these<00:01:09.100> characters

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
showed us is that all these characters

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.850 
showed us is that all these characters
could<00:01:10.030> coexist<00:01:10.360> because<00:01:10.960> they<00:01:11.110> were<00:01:11.170> toys<00:01:11.440> and

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:11.860 
could coexist because they were toys and

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.340 
could coexist because they were toys and
that<00:01:12.400> just<00:01:12.640> blew<00:01:12.940> the<00:01:13.150> doors<00:01:13.360> open<00:01:13.750> for<00:01:13.930> us

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:14.350 
that just blew the doors open for us

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:16.530 
that just blew the doors open for us

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
all just discovering what each toy to do

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.270 
all just discovering what each toy to do
when<00:01:28.570> we<00:01:28.660> put<00:01:28.930> that<00:01:29.110> early<00:01:29.470> prototype<00:01:30.010> in

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
when we put that early prototype in

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.870 
when we put that early prototype in
front<00:01:30.520> of<00:01:30.610> kids<00:01:30.910> it<00:01:31.840> went<00:01:32.260> crazy<00:01:32.650> you<00:01:33.370> see<00:01:33.670> this

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
front of kids it went crazy you see this

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.910 
front of kids it went crazy you see this
emergent<00:01:34.390> gameplay<00:01:34.540> coming<00:01:35.170> about<00:01:35.410> because

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:35.920 
emergent gameplay coming about because

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.600 
emergent gameplay coming about because
they<00:01:36.370> start<00:01:36.730> figuring<00:01:37.120> out<00:01:37.450> combinations<00:01:38.290> oh

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
they start figuring out combinations oh

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.060 
they start figuring out combinations oh
that<00:01:39.610> toy<00:01:39.910> with<00:01:40.540> this<00:01:40.810> toy<00:01:41.080> could<00:01:41.680> do<00:01:41.860> this

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:42.070 
that toy with this toy could do this

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.370 
that toy with this toy could do this
that<00:01:43.000> was<00:01:43.210> the<00:01:43.360> moment<00:01:43.510> where<00:01:43.840> we<00:01:43.870> really<00:01:44.230> knew

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
that was the moment where we really knew

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.340 
that was the moment where we really knew
hey<00:01:44.680> something<00:01:45.640> special<00:01:46.000> here<00:01:46.150> but<00:01:46.810> we<00:01:47.140> wanted

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:47.350 
hey something special here but we wanted

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:48.900 
hey something special here but we wanted
to<00:01:47.410> give<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.620> player<00:01:47.800> even<00:01:47.980> more<00:01:48.220> freedom<00:01:48.580> so

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
to give the player even more freedom so

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.760 
to give the player even more freedom so
we<00:01:49.240> took<00:01:49.420> that<00:01:49.480> idea<00:01:49.870> one<00:01:50.140> step<00:01:50.170> further<00:01:50.560> and

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
we took that idea one step further and

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:52.530 
we took that idea one step further and
just<00:01:50.950> said<00:01:51.220> let's<00:01:51.520> go<00:01:51.640> outside<00:01:51.940> toy<00:01:52.180> sir<00:01:52.300> let's

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
just said let's go outside toy sir let's

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.630 
just said let's go outside toy sir let's
make<00:01:52.690> toys<00:01:52.990> out<00:01:53.170> of<00:01:53.290> everything<00:01:53.560> and<00:01:54.430> that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
make toys out of everything and that

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.730 
make toys out of everything and that
project<00:01:54.910> shifted<00:01:55.480> into<00:01:55.630> what<00:01:56.050> we<00:01:56.170> now<00:01:56.260> know<00:01:56.470> as

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
project shifted into what we now know as

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.970 
project shifted into what we now know as
the<00:01:56.800> toy<00:01:57.250> box<00:01:57.430> is<00:01:57.760> infinity<00:01:58.420> the<00:01:59.140> name<00:01:59.380> toy<00:01:59.710> box

00:01:59.970 --> 00:01:59.980 
the toy box is infinity the name toy box

00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:02.820 
the toy box is infinity the name toy box
is<00:02:00.220> really<00:02:00.400> apt<00:02:00.700> because<00:02:01.270> it<00:02:01.900> is<00:02:02.140> essentially

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:02.830 
is really apt because it is essentially

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.610 
is really apt because it is essentially
a<00:02:02.980> modern<00:02:03.580> digital<00:02:04.030> form<00:02:04.630> of<00:02:04.870> what<00:02:05.080> to<00:02:05.320> me<00:02:05.470> was

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:05.620 
a modern digital form of what to me was

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.250
