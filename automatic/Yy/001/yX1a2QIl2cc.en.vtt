to work under linux so we have to use

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
to work under linux so we have to use
wine<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.980> I<00:01:02.010> thought<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.309> was<00:01:02.520> a<00:01:02.579> little

play<00:02:13.950> game<00:02:15.020> okay<00:02:16.020> I<00:02:17.750> was<00:02:18.750> a<00:02:18.840> little<00:02:19.140> tricky<00:02:19.380> to

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:19.620 
play game okay I was a little tricky to

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.440 
play game okay I was a little tricky to
kind<00:02:20.190> of<00:02:20.340> like<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.670> think<00:02:21.030> you<00:02:21.120> have<00:02:21.240> to<00:02:21.270> use

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
kind of like I think you have to use

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.300 
kind of like I think you have to use
some<00:02:22.550> restraints<00:02:23.550> like<00:02:23.910> patience<00:02:24.600> hey<00:02:24.920> now<00:02:25.920> um

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.310 
some restraints like patience hey now um

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.080 
some restraints like patience hey now um
right<00:02:27.210> now<00:02:27.240> be<00:02:27.690> noticed<00:02:27.960> here<00:02:28.490> let<00:02:29.490> me<00:02:29.580> zoom<00:02:29.850> in

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
right now be noticed here let me zoom in

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.810 
right now be noticed here let me zoom in
well<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.690> can't<00:02:30.900> really<00:02:30.960> see<00:02:31.290> it<00:02:31.320> anyway<00:02:31.820> but

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
well you can't really see it anyway but

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.800 
well you can't really see it anyway but
it<00:02:32.970> says<00:02:33.150> uh<00:02:33.740> okay<00:02:34.740> maybe<00:02:34.980> can<00:02:35.280> blue<00:02:36.270> blizzard

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
it says uh okay maybe can blue blizzard

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:38.720 
it says uh okay maybe can blue blizzard
background<00:02:37.680> downloader<00:02:38.220> I<00:02:38.310> guess<00:02:38.490> you<00:02:38.610> would

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:38.730 
background downloader I guess you would

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:41.420

Warcraft<00:02:42.500> it's<00:02:43.500> running<00:02:43.920> in<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.190> background

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
Warcraft it's running in the background

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.850 
Warcraft it's running in the background
which<00:02:44.880> is<00:02:45.120> fine<00:02:45.960> because<00:02:46.170> it<00:02:46.410> needs<00:02:46.590> to<00:02:46.740> be

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:46.860 
which is fine because it needs to be

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.250 
which is fine because it needs to be
patched<00:02:47.360> now<00:02:48.360> I<00:02:48.390> don't<00:02:48.630> know<00:02:48.840> this<00:02:49.020> is<00:02:49.140> going

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
patched now I don't know this is going

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.510 
patched now I don't know this is going
to<00:02:49.350> run<00:02:51.050> since<00:02:54.440> I've<00:02:55.440> already<00:02:55.800> exited<00:02:56.340> the

to run since I've already exited the
game<00:02:56.760> it<00:02:57.600> seems<00:02:57.930> a<00:02:58.050> kind<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.650> a<00:02:58.770> game<00:02:59.670> where<00:02:59.970> I

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
game it seems a kind of a game where I

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.070 
game it seems a kind of a game where I
off<00:03:00.210> to<00:03:01.280> stop<00:03:02.280> all<00:03:02.490> the<00:03:02.670> wine<00:03:03.150> services<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:04.080 
off to stop all the wine services and

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:09.020 
off to stop all the wine services and
stop<00:03:04.290> all<00:03:04.500> the<00:03:07.250> background<00:03:08.250> downloading<00:03:08.910> or

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
stop all the background downloading or

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.450 
stop all the background downloading or
just<00:03:09.270> basically<00:03:09.570> restart<00:03:10.200> the<00:03:10.320> computer<00:03:10.460> and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
just basically restart the computer and

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:16.040 
just basically restart the computer and
run<00:03:12.120> and<00:03:14.000> apparently<00:03:15.000> that's<00:03:15.270> what<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.870> have

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
run and apparently that's what you have

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.310 
run and apparently that's what you have
to<00:03:16.080> do<00:03:19.310> so<00:03:20.310> I'll<00:03:20.430> pause<00:03:20.670> this<00:03:20.880> video<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.330> I'll

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
to do so I'll pause this video and I'll

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.460 
to do so I'll pause this video and I'll
be<00:03:22.470> back<00:03:22.820> okay<00:03:23.820> turns<00:03:24.600> out<00:03:24.780> I<00:03:24.959> didn't<00:03:25.260> have<00:03:25.350> to

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:25.470 
be back okay turns out I didn't have to

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.830 
be back okay turns out I didn't have to
restart<00:03:25.890> I<00:03:26.070> had<00:03:26.310> to<00:03:26.520> go<00:03:26.880> into<00:03:27.090> system<00:03:28.730> manada

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:29.840

system<00:03:30.840> monitor<00:03:31.290> I<00:03:31.820> went<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:32.850> processes<00:03:33.690> and

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
system monitor I went to processes and

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.850 
system monitor I went to processes and
there<00:03:34.410> were<00:03:34.590> two<00:03:34.920> that<00:03:35.220> were<00:03:35.510> running<00:03:36.590> I'm<00:03:37.590> not

background<00:03:46.200> it's<00:03:46.860> been<00:03:47.130> might<00:03:47.489> come<00:03:47.670> up<00:03:47.820> at

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
background it's been might come up at

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.240 
background it's been might come up at
the<00:03:48.120> background<00:03:48.630> downloader<00:03:49.200> I<00:03:49.440> mentioned

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
the background downloader I mentioned

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.770 
the background downloader I mentioned

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:53.780 
once I stopped those two processes just

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.610 
once I stopped those two processes just
came<00:03:54.780> up<00:03:54.959> to<00:03:55.410> say<00:03:55.590> play<00:03:56.239> and<00:03:57.239> I<00:03:57.930> noticed<00:03:58.260> us

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
I have an answer world um yeah I thought

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:27.110 
I have an answer world um yeah I thought
the<00:04:25.380> result<00:04:25.770> and<00:04:25.979> it<00:04:26.070> doesn't<00:04:26.280> matter<00:04:26.580> so

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
the result and it doesn't matter so

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.900 
the result and it doesn't matter so
enter<00:04:27.570> we're

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 
enter we're

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.650 
enter we're
old<00:04:28.080> and<00:04:29.580> sometimes<00:04:30.580> just<00:04:30.850> takes<00:04:31.150> a<00:04:31.270> while<00:04:31.300> as

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
old and sometimes just takes a while as

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:36.000 
old and sometimes just takes a while as
you<00:04:31.780> probably<00:04:32.050> know<00:04:32.380> I<00:04:32.710> don't<00:04:33.400> know<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:35.010> guess

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
you probably know I don't know I guess

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.070 
you probably know I don't know I guess
because<00:04:36.460> the<00:04:36.640> background<00:04:36.850> downloader<00:04:37.600> but

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
because the background downloader but

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:41.130 
because the background downloader but
yeah<00:04:38.830> it's<00:04:39.070> doing<00:04:39.400> more<00:04:39.640> I<00:04:39.910> guess<00:04:40.900> whatever

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:41.140 
yeah it's doing more I guess whatever

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:44.220 
yeah it's doing more I guess whatever

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:04.860 
using an AMD 6870 it's it's adequate I

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:07.110 
using an AMD 6870 it's it's adequate I
mean<00:05:05.860> that<00:05:06.010> the<00:05:06.190> video<00:05:06.370> card<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.700> pretty<00:05:06.910> good

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
mean that the video card is pretty good

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.590 
mean that the video card is pretty good
but<00:05:07.690> I<00:05:07.720> mean<00:05:07.960> adequate<00:05:08.470> under<00:05:08.890> ubuntu<00:05:09.820> her

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:10.600 
but I mean adequate under ubuntu her

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.900 
but I mean adequate under ubuntu her
linux<00:05:13.530> so<00:05:14.530> this<00:05:15.190> shouldn't<00:05:15.430> take<00:05:15.580> too<00:05:15.730> much

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:15.910 
linux so this shouldn't take too much

00:05:15.910 --> 00:05:20.910 
linux so this shouldn't take too much
