00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:06.690
 hi friends today we decided to take off 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.360
 for now let's leave a little Tyumen cork 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.920
 On decided to remove a small video reviews about 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.299
 peugeot 408 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.830
 and here we bought this car on credit 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.440
 a program that we completely 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:22.290
 returns all credit sounds absurd 

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:26.540
 but it's so okay and we'll talk about it later 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.340
 talk here look at the counter 

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:32.430
 1700 kilometers 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:36.450
 project and we drove for two and a half 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.910
 months what can i say i am 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.720
 I saw some reviews about this car 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:48.660
 car of course very cool car 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:51.170
 dynamic very very manageable 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.670
 very good on the road 

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:57.240
 esp works great on 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.420
 slippery roads 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.970
 the car is very warm in almost 30 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:06.290
 degree frost machine is very fast 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.600
 warming up in not very comfortable ride 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:14.150
 a lot of space in it behind me 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:18.540
 the kids there are just satisfied even 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.640
 battles arrange in the back seat which 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.890
 maybe a small minus i can 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:25.560
 say i don't really like this 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.320
 car this is the only heating 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.570
 rear window 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.220
 works poorly works weakly i.e. 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.950
 to warm the rear window 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:37.530
 must pass some time but on the other 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.900
 hand visibility of the machine is very good 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.270
 on hyundai getz i have 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:45.450
 previous car visibility much 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.760
 worse here is very comfortable my wife 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.880
 rides just delighted very quickly 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:54.660
 got on the car started to drive fast 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 mastered a very powerful engine for me 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:03.899
 engine 16 150 horses can take off with 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.580
 places on literally clicking on the gas again 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.390
 Consumption here if you see consumption 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:13.890
 fuel it showed 18 average consumption for 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:16.680
 in fact, somewhere 12-13 liters in the city 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.080
 I am looking for, that is, I believe that for such 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.150
 cars it is more than normal well in 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:23.820

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.930
