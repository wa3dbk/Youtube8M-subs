kind star collectors here one of you
commented<00:00:09.540> uh<00:00:10.219> asking<00:00:11.219> if<00:00:11.490> you<00:00:12.059> could<00:00:12.210> simply

commented uh asking if you could simply
put<00:00:12.960> a<00:00:13.170> collector<00:00:14.150> in<00:00:15.150> place<00:00:15.630> of<00:00:15.960> the

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
put a collector in place of the

star<00:00:19.590> that<00:00:19.800> way<00:00:19.949> the<00:00:20.430> answer<00:00:20.699> is<00:00:20.910> yes<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
star that way the answer is yes and it

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
star that way the answer is yes and it
actually<00:00:21.720> turns<00:00:22.109> out<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.350> be<00:00:22.500> the<00:00:22.800> fastest<00:00:23.340> way

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
actually turns out to be the fastest way

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.500 
actually turns out to be the fastest way
to<00:00:23.580> charge<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> single<00:00:24.869> client<00:00:25.109> star<00:00:26.510> starting

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
down here most basic set up five one

down here most basic set up five one
five<00:00:33.690> collectors<00:00:34.680> one<00:00:35.570> relay<00:00:36.570> once<00:00:37.290> again

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
five collectors one relay once again

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.610 
five collectors one relay once again
I've<00:00:37.920> used<00:00:38.690> Tier<00:00:39.690> three<00:00:39.750> items<00:00:41.840> in<00:00:42.840> building

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:43.620 
I've used Tier three items in building

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.150 
I've used Tier three items in building
these<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.370> the<00:00:44.579> times<00:00:44.969> are<00:00:45.480> going<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.660> be

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
these so the the times are going to be

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.299 
these so the the times are going to be
based<00:00:47.160> on<00:00:47.340> tier<00:00:47.640> 3<00:00:47.940> items<00:00:48.329> they'll<00:00:48.600> be<00:00:48.780> slower

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
based on tier 3 items they'll be slower

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:52.869 
based on tier 3 items they'll be slower
if<00:00:50.309> you're<00:00:50.489> using<00:00:50.670> Tier<00:00:51.090> one<00:00:51.149> or<00:00:51.329> two<00:00:51.660> items<00:00:51.840> so

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
if you're using Tier one or two items so

00:00:52.879 --> 00:01:00.279 
if you're using Tier one or two items so
tier<00:00:54.289> or<00:00:55.730> single<00:00:57.050> relay<00:00:58.050> surrounded<00:00:58.859> by<00:00:59.039> five

tier or single relay surrounded by five
collectors<00:01:01.289> you<00:01:01.890> could<00:01:02.190> uh<00:01:02.480> since<00:01:03.480> they're

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
collectors you could uh since they're

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.950 
collectors you could uh since they're
pretty<00:01:03.870> easy<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.619> you<00:01:05.129> wanted<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:06.090> could<00:01:06.390> put

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
pretty easy if you wanted you could put

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.330 
pretty easy if you wanted you could put
a<00:01:07.490> one<00:01:08.490> more<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.510> on<00:01:09.720> the<00:01:10.020> front<00:01:10.170> here<00:01:10.650> a

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
a one more on the on the front here a

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.570 
a one more on the on the front here a
walk<00:01:12.240> away<00:01:12.540> I'll<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.290> build<00:01:13.590> stuff<00:01:13.890> Explorer

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
walk away I'll go build stuff Explorer

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.179 
walk away I'll go build stuff Explorer
or<00:01:14.760> whatever<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.810> when<00:01:15.990> you<00:01:16.110> come<00:01:16.320> back<00:01:16.530> it

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
or whatever and when you come back it

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.830 
or whatever and when you come back it
will<00:01:17.369> have<00:01:17.520> charged<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.030> little<00:01:18.240> bit<00:01:18.360> faster

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
will have charged a little bit faster

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.130 
will have charged a little bit faster
than<00:01:19.020> that<00:01:20.600> unfortunately<00:01:21.600> when<00:01:21.810> you<00:01:21.900> do<00:01:22.020> it

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
than that unfortunately when you do it

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.789 
than that unfortunately when you do it
that<00:01:22.290> way<00:01:22.350> I<00:01:22.560> can't<00:01:23.310> see<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.360> charge<00:01:24.720> on<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
that way I can't see the charge on the

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.710 
that way I can't see the charge on the
client<00:01:26.159> star<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.670> it'd<00:01:26.790> be<00:01:26.820> very<00:01:26.939> difficult<00:01:27.600> to

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
client star so it'd be very difficult to

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.670 
client star so it'd be very difficult to
actually<00:01:27.869> time<00:01:29.420> but<00:01:30.420> any<00:01:30.600> rate<00:01:30.840> five<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.470> one

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
actually time but any rate five and one

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:33.770 
actually time but any rate five and one
will<00:01:31.979> give<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.280> charge<00:01:32.640> a<00:01:33.060> single<00:01:33.600> client

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
will give you a charge a single client

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.810 
will give you a charge a single client
star<00:01:35.540> at<00:01:36.540> a<00:01:36.600> rate<00:01:36.900> of<00:01:36.930> six<00:01:37.350> point<00:01:37.650> five<00:01:37.920> seconds

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
per 1000 DMC on the client star also I'm

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
a little bit of energy so here I was

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.110 
a little bit of energy so here I was
testing<00:02:19.860> out<00:02:20.040> a<00:02:20.070> little<00:02:20.580> bit<00:02:20.790> different

testing out a little bit different
design<00:02:23.420> this<00:02:24.420> one<00:02:24.690> is<00:02:24.930> great<00:02:25.620> for<00:02:26.130> charging

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
design this one is great for charging

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.710 
design this one is great for charging
multiple<00:02:27.480> Kline<00:02:27.840> stars<00:02:29.090> it's<00:02:30.090> a<00:02:30.210> little<00:02:30.570> bit

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
multiple Kline stars it's a little bit

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.400 
multiple Kline stars it's a little bit
slower<00:02:31.230> overall<00:02:32.420> for<00:02:33.420> charging<00:02:33.780> a<00:02:33.870> single

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
slower overall for charging a single

slower overall for charging a single
client<00:02:34.830> star<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:36.440> it<00:02:37.440> does<00:02:37.710> use<00:02:37.920> 17:5<00:02:38.700> just

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
client star the it does use 17:5 just

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.330 
client star the it does use 17:5 just
like<00:02:39.270> our<00:02:40.880> our<00:02:41.880> set<00:02:42.180> up<00:02:42.270> over<00:02:42.420> there

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
like our our set up over there

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.430 
like our our set up over there
so<00:02:45.330> seventeen

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
so seventeen

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.520 
so seventeen
it<00:02:46.620> just<00:02:47.040> happens<00:02:47.400> to<00:02:47.870> seventeen<00:02:48.870> collectors

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
it just happens to seventeen collectors

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.570 
it just happens to seventeen collectors
and<00:02:49.830> five<00:02:50.370> relays<00:02:51.560> you<00:02:52.560> can<00:02:52.680> see<00:02:52.830> I've<00:02:52.950> popped

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:53.580 
and five relays you can see I've popped

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:56.390 
and five relays you can see I've popped
them<00:02:53.760> on<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:53.970> back<00:02:54.209> and<00:02:54.930> once<00:02:55.200> again<00:02:55.400> you

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
them on the back and once again you

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.150 
them on the back and once again you
could<00:02:56.640> pop<00:02:57.000> them<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.360> the<00:02:57.510> front<00:02:57.840> you<00:02:58.530> know<00:02:58.800> if

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
could pop them on the front you know if

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.550 
could pop them on the front you know if
you<00:02:59.310> have<00:02:59.490> the<00:02:59.700> extra<00:03:00.030> ones<00:03:00.270> you<00:03:01.260> could<00:03:01.380> pop

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you have the extra ones you could pop

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.040 
you have the extra ones you could pop
them<00:03:01.740> on<00:03:01.890> there<00:03:02.420> give<00:03:03.420> yourself<00:03:03.720> a<00:03:03.780> little<00:03:03.870> bit

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:04.050 
them on there give yourself a little bit

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.010 
them on there give yourself a little bit
more<00:03:04.110> booze<00:03:04.470> to<00:03:05.070> go<00:03:05.340> build<00:03:05.640> stuff<00:03:06.030> hey<00:03:06.660> the

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
more booze to go build stuff hey the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:10.250 
more booze to go build stuff hey the
rain<00:03:07.260> is<00:03:07.470> stopping<00:03:07.770> hey<00:03:08.310> oh<00:03:09.050> and<00:03:10.050> then<00:03:10.170> when

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
rain is stopping hey oh and then when

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:13.220 
rain is stopping hey oh and then when
you<00:03:10.380> come<00:03:10.560> back<00:03:10.770> you<00:03:11.610> know<00:03:11.900> pickaxe<00:03:12.900> break

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
you come back you know pickaxe break

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.400 
you come back you know pickaxe break
them<00:03:13.380> down<00:03:14.240> and<00:03:15.240> then<00:03:15.390> put<00:03:15.570> them<00:03:15.660> back<00:03:15.780> up<00:03:15.840> at

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
them down and then put them back up at

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.090 
them down and then put them back up at
any<00:03:16.620> rate<00:03:17.540> this<00:03:18.540> can<00:03:18.780> also<00:03:18.959> be<00:03:19.110> expanded<00:03:19.470> you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
any rate this can also be expanded you

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:22.460 
any rate this can also be expanded you
could<00:03:20.489> I<00:03:20.850> don't<00:03:21.750> have<00:03:21.870> a<00:03:21.900> whole<00:03:22.080> lot<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.320> room

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
could I don't have a whole lot of room

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.050 
could I don't have a whole lot of room
to<00:03:22.500> show<00:03:22.739> you<00:03:22.800> but<00:03:23.010> you<00:03:23.160> could<00:03:23.370> plop<00:03:23.760> another

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
to show you but you could plop another

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.820 
to show you but you could plop another
one<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.390> there<00:03:24.630> it's<00:03:25.350> like<00:03:25.470> the<00:03:25.560> middle<00:03:25.800> one

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
one in there it's like the middle one

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.360 
one in there it's like the middle one
and<00:03:26.810> there<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.930> go<00:03:28.940> at<00:03:29.940> any<00:03:30.120> rate<00:03:30.830> your<00:03:31.830> two

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
and there you go at any rate your two

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.840 
and there you go at any rate your two
outer<00:03:32.700> ones<00:03:33.120> each<00:03:34.110> charge<00:03:34.620> recline<00:03:35.010> star<00:03:35.400> at

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
outer ones each charge recline star at

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.030 
outer ones each charge recline star at
eight<00:03:36.239> point<00:03:36.600> eight<00:03:36.750> seconds<00:03:37.290> per<00:03:37.470> a<00:03:37.500> thousand

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
eight point eight seconds per a thousand

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.430 
eight point eight seconds per a thousand
so<00:03:38.430> that's<00:03:38.550> not<00:03:38.700> too<00:03:38.850> bad<00:03:39.090> this<00:03:40.019> one's<00:03:40.230> doing

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:40.440 
so that's not too bad this one's doing

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.340 
so that's not too bad this one's doing
6.5<00:03:41.450> this<00:03:42.450> one's<00:03:42.600> doing<00:03:42.690> eight<00:03:42.959> point<00:03:43.230> eight

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
6.5 this one's doing eight point eight

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:45.590 
6.5 this one's doing eight point eight
and<00:03:43.620> these<00:03:44.340> two<00:03:44.580> over<00:03:44.820> here<00:03:44.850> also<00:03:45.150> doing<00:03:45.480> eight

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
and these two over here also doing eight

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.930 
and these two over here also doing eight
point<00:03:45.870> eight<00:03:45.959> seconds<00:03:46.580> the<00:03:47.580> one<00:03:47.760> in<00:03:47.850> the

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
point eight seconds the one in the

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.430 
point eight seconds the one in the
middle<00:03:48.090> is<00:03:48.269> significantly<00:03:48.870> slower<00:03:49.230> and

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
middle is significantly slower and

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.290 
middle is significantly slower and
that's<00:03:49.590> because<00:03:51.620> it's<00:03:52.730> so<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.060> way<00:03:54.150> this

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:54.300 
that's because it's so the way this

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.440 
that's because it's so the way this
works<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.840> this<00:03:55.410> collector<00:03:56.070> is<00:03:56.610> splitting<00:03:57.180> its

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
works is this collector is splitting its

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:03.770 
works is this collector is splitting its
energy<00:03:57.870> three<00:03:58.800> ways<00:04:00.950> so<00:04:01.950> this<00:04:02.700> condenser<00:04:03.600> is

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
energy three ways so this condenser is

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.530 
energy three ways so this condenser is
really<00:04:04.290> only<00:04:04.500> getting<00:04:05.360> four<00:04:06.360> thirds<00:04:07.519> output

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
really only getting four thirds output

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:10.789 
really only getting four thirds output
alright<00:04:09.540> because<00:04:09.630> each<00:04:09.900> each<00:04:10.290> one<00:04:10.350> of<00:04:10.709> these

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
alright because each each one of these

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:14.180 
alright because each each one of these
collectors<00:04:11.510> is<00:04:12.510> splitting<00:04:13.170> its<00:04:13.320> output<00:04:13.709> three

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
collectors is splitting its output three

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:17.180 
collectors is splitting its output three
ways<00:04:14.400> one<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.690> collector<00:04:16.049> one<00:04:16.320> two<00:04:16.650> three

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
ways one so this collector one two three

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:19.610 
ways one so this collector one two three
collector<00:04:17.790> one<00:04:18.000> two<00:04:18.239> three<00:04:18.780> so<00:04:19.260> this

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
collector one two three so this

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.409 
collector one two three so this
collector<00:04:20.040> is<00:04:20.130> only<00:04:20.220> getting<00:04:20.489> four<00:04:20.910> thirds<00:04:21.269> of

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419 
collector is only getting four thirds of

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:26.010 
collector is only getting four thirds of
an<00:04:21.540> output<00:04:22.520> a<00:04:23.840> little<00:04:24.840> bit<00:04:25.020> more

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
an output a little bit more

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:27.450 
an output a little bit more
because<00:04:26.470> there's<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> one<00:04:26.889> on<00:04:26.979> the<00:04:27.069> back<00:04:27.220> that

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
because there's the one on the back that

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.100 
because there's the one on the back that
it's<00:04:27.580> solely<00:04:27.880> dedicated<00:04:28.060> to<00:04:28.569> it<00:04:28.690> so<00:04:28.810> four

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:29.110 
it's solely dedicated to it so four

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.870 
it's solely dedicated to it so four
thirds<00:04:29.319> plus<00:04:29.530> one<00:04:29.949> if<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.940> will<00:04:31.620> output<00:04:32.880> per

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
thirds plus one if you will output per

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.920 
thirds plus one if you will output per
second<00:04:34.360> whereas<00:04:35.169> this<00:04:35.410> collector<00:04:35.919> is<00:04:36.930> getting

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:37.930 
second whereas this collector is getting

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:43.770 
second whereas this collector is getting
to<00:04:39.030> three<00:04:40.650> dedicated<00:04:41.650> to<00:04:41.800> it<00:04:41.949> plus<00:04:42.780> it's

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
to three dedicated to it plus it's

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.170 
to three dedicated to it plus it's
getting<00:04:44.050> uh<00:04:45.720> another<00:04:46.720> two<00:04:47.080> thirds<00:04:47.759> so<00:04:48.759> it's

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
getting uh another two thirds so it's

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.839 
getting uh another two thirds so it's
got<00:04:49.389> three<00:04:50.289> and<00:04:50.470> two<00:04:50.770> thirds<00:04:51.130> collectors

00:04:51.839 --> 00:04:51.849 
got three and two thirds collectors

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:55.050 
got three and two thirds collectors
giving<00:04:52.720> it<00:04:52.840> energy<00:04:53.220> whereas<00:04:54.220> this<00:04:54.430> one<00:04:54.699> only

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
giving it energy whereas this one only

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.279 
giving it energy whereas this one only
has<00:04:55.590> two<00:04:56.590> and<00:04:56.919> one<00:04:57.220> thirds<00:04:57.900> collectors<00:04:58.900> giving

00:04:59.279 --> 00:04:59.289 
has two and one thirds collectors giving

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:01.830 
has two and one thirds collectors giving
it<00:04:59.409> energy<00:04:59.590> therefore<00:05:00.370> it<00:05:00.759> is<00:05:00.909> significantly

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
it energy therefore it is significantly

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:08.960 
it energy therefore it is significantly
slower<00:05:02.229> on<00:05:02.530> charging<00:05:03.130> it<00:05:04.800> overall<00:05:05.800> excuse<00:05:06.370> me

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.060 

overall<00:05:09.690> charge<00:05:10.020> rate<00:05:10.260> is<00:05:10.410> significantly

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
overall charge rate is significantly

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:13.460 
overall charge rate is significantly
reduced<00:05:11.250> on<00:05:12.060> the<00:05:12.630> client<00:05:12.990> start<00:05:13.200> and<00:05:13.290> you<00:05:13.350> can

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:13.470 
reduced on the client start and you can

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:16.340 
reduced on the client start and you can
see<00:05:13.710> it's<00:05:13.860> it's<00:05:14.400> a<00:05:14.580> lot<00:05:14.760> slower<00:05:15.150> than<00:05:16.050> if<00:05:16.230> we

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:16.350 
see it's it's a lot slower than if we

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:21.650 
see it's it's a lot slower than if we
were<00:05:16.380> to<00:05:16.530> look<00:05:16.650> at<00:05:16.800> this<00:05:16.920> one<00:05:17.100> here<00:05:19.880> and<00:05:20.880> just

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
were to look at this one here and just

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.880 
were to look at this one here and just
reference<00:05:23.060> if<00:05:24.060> we<00:05:24.180> look<00:05:24.300> at<00:05:24.420> this<00:05:24.540> one<00:05:24.810> you<00:05:25.740> can

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
reference if we look at this one you can

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:30.230 
reference if we look at this one you can
see<00:05:27.320> all<00:05:28.320> right<00:05:28.440> so<00:05:28.650> so<00:05:29.220> so<00:05:29.550> far<00:05:29.730> this<00:05:29.970> is<00:05:30.090> our

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:30.240 
see all right so so so far this is our

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:34.490 
see all right so so so far this is our
fastest<00:05:30.750> one<00:05:30.960> now<00:05:31.640> uh<00:05:32.840> once<00:05:33.840> again<00:05:34.020> someone

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:34.500 
fastest one now uh once again someone

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:38.600 
fastest one now uh once again someone
asked<00:05:34.950> okay<00:05:35.280> well<00:05:35.550> can<00:05:36.330> I<00:05:36.390> take<00:05:36.840> my<00:05:37.610> 17:5

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
asked okay well can I take my 17:5

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:41.570 
asked okay well can I take my 17:5
flower<00:05:39.000> that<00:05:39.360> I'm<00:05:39.510> I've<00:05:40.500> got<00:05:40.650> my<00:05:40.740> collector<00:05:41.280> my

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
flower that I'm I've got my collector my

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.690 
flower that I'm I've got my collector my
condenser<00:05:42.120> going<00:05:42.480> uh<00:05:42.980> can<00:05:43.980> I<00:05:44.190> pull<00:05:44.670> that

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:44.700 
condenser going uh can I pull that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.630 
condenser going uh can I pull that
condenser<00:05:45.360> out<00:05:45.480> of<00:05:45.630> there<00:05:45.750> and<00:05:46.220> plop<00:05:47.220> another

00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:47.640 
condenser out of there and plop another

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.150 
condenser out of there and plop another
collector<00:05:48.420> in<00:05:48.570> and<00:05:48.840> charge<00:05:49.230> a<00:05:49.380> Cline<00:05:49.620> star<00:05:50.010> and

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:50.160 
collector in and charge a Cline star and

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.120 
collector in and charge a Cline star and
that<00:05:50.310> the<00:05:50.520> answer<00:05:50.760> is<00:05:50.880> yes<00:05:51.410> it<00:05:52.410> becomes<00:05:52.950> an

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.130 
that the answer is yes it becomes an

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.520 
that the answer is yes it becomes an
18-5<00:05:53.850> flower<00:05:54.210> then<00:05:54.510> instead<00:05:54.750> of<00:05:54.810> a<00:05:54.900> 17:5

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:55.530 
18-5 flower then instead of a 17:5

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:59.780 
18-5 flower then instead of a 17:5
flower<00:05:56.000> but<00:05:57.000> check<00:05:57.240> this<00:05:57.360> out<00:05:58.130> 1.75<00:05:59.130> seconds

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
flower but check this out 1.75 seconds

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.660 
flower but check this out 1.75 seconds
per<00:06:00.060> a<00:06:00.090> thousand<00:06:00.750> k<00:06:00.990> and<00:06:01.290> you<00:06:01.590> can<00:06:01.800> see<00:06:02.400> that

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
per a thousand k and you can see that

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.200 
per a thousand k and you can see that
baby<00:06:03.030> go<00:06:03.360> I<00:06:03.710> wasn't<00:06:04.710> actually<00:06:04.830> evil<00:06:05.370> to<00:06:05.490> time<00:06:05.820> a

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:14.790 
accurate timing for this thing so

00:06:14.790 --> 00:06:17.540 
accurate timing for this thing so
charging<00:06:15.660> a<00:06:15.720> single<00:06:16.140> client<00:06:16.500> star<00:06:16.740> this<00:06:17.490> is

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:17.550 
charging a single client star this is

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.350 
charging a single client star this is
the<00:06:17.820> fastest<00:06:18.330> way<00:06:18.480> to<00:06:18.510> do<00:06:18.780> it<00:06:19.970> this<00:06:20.970> is<00:06:21.210> the

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:21.360 
the fastest way to do it this is the

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.720 
the fastest way to do it this is the
cheapest<00:06:21.810> because<00:06:22.500> you<00:06:22.830> only<00:06:22.980> need<00:06:23.070> five

00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:23.730 
cheapest because you only need five

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:28.070 
cheapest because you only need five
collectors<00:06:24.270> and<00:06:24.600> one<00:06:25.160> one<00:06:26.160> relay<00:06:27.080> it's

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:28.080 
collectors and one one relay it's

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:35.120 
collectors and one one relay it's
reasonably<00:06:28.620> fast<00:06:30.170> 17<00:06:31.170> and<00:06:31.440> 5<00:06:31.650> I<00:06:33.710> would<00:06:34.710> say<00:06:34.980> an

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
reasonably fast 17 and 5 I would say an

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:39.710 
reasonably fast 17 and 5 I would say an
overall<00:06:35.910> average<00:06:36.470> pure<00:06:37.470> machine<00:06:38.270> if<00:06:39.270> you<00:06:39.510> will

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:39.720 
overall average pure machine if you will

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:43.160 
overall average pure machine if you will
is<00:06:40.020> nine<00:06:40.950> point<00:06:41.370> three<00:06:41.460> seconds<00:06:42.210> per<00:06:42.480> thousand

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:43.170 
is nine point three seconds per thousand

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:49.040 
is nine point three seconds per thousand
k<00:06:43.410> um<00:06:44.510> and<00:06:46.550> please<00:06:47.550> don't<00:06:47.820> comment<00:06:48.390> on<00:06:48.720> me<00:06:48.930> if

00:06:49.040 --> 00:06:49.050 
k um and please don't comment on me if

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:51.200 
k um and please don't comment on me if
that's<00:06:49.320> wrong<00:06:49.740> because<00:06:50.640> I<00:06:50.880> didn't<00:06:51.120> actually

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:51.210 
that's wrong because I didn't actually

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:53.030 
that's wrong because I didn't actually
calculate<00:06:51.840> it<00:06:51.870> I<00:06:52.020> was<00:06:52.140> just<00:06:52.290> approximating<00:06:52.950> it

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:53.040 
calculate it I was just approximating it

00:06:53.040 --> 00:07:00.020 
calculate it I was just approximating it
haha<00:06:53.430> and<00:06:56.330> but<00:06:57.330> it<00:06:57.510> offers<00:06:58.110> you<00:06:58.350> the<00:06:59.030> ability

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:00.030 
haha and but it offers you the ability

00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:02.240 
haha and but it offers you the ability
to<00:07:00.270> charge<00:07:00.600> multiple<00:07:01.260> client<00:07:01.650> stars<00:07:01.890> at<00:07:02.040> once

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:02.250 
to charge multiple client stars at once

00:07:02.250 --> 00:07:04.490 
to charge multiple client stars at once
although<00:07:02.550> it<00:07:02.910> is<00:07:03.030> the<00:07:03.180> slowest<00:07:03.690> charge<00:07:04.200> rate

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
although it is the slowest charge rate

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.940 
although it is the slowest charge rate
for<00:07:05.310> each<00:07:05.430> individual<00:07:06.240> star<00:07:06.770> and<00:07:07.770> then

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:07.950 
for each individual star and then

00:07:07.950 --> 00:07:12.230 
for each individual star and then
finally<00:07:08.820> we've<00:07:09.510> got<00:07:09.590> this<00:07:10.590> setup<00:07:11.520> here<00:07:12.000> which

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:12.240 
finally we've got this setup here which

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.010 
finally we've got this setup here which
is<00:07:12.450> merely<00:07:12.870> recycling<00:07:14.180> one<00:07:15.180> of<00:07:15.300> these<00:07:15.540> and

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:16.020 
is merely recycling one of these and

00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.890 
is merely recycling one of these and
turning<00:07:16.470> it<00:07:16.590> into<00:07:17.270> something<00:07:18.270> that<00:07:18.480> has

00:07:19.890 --> 00:07:19.900 
turning it into something that has

00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.980 
turning it into something that has
all<00:07:20.140> right<00:07:20.230> that's<00:07:20.610> their<00:07:21.690> something<00:07:22.690> that

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:22.990 
all right that's their something that

00:07:22.990 --> 00:07:26.790 
all right that's their something that
