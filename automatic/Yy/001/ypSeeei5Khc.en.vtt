00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:13.039 
many our viewers are adding LED lighting

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:15.249 
many our viewers are adding LED lighting
to<00:00:13.219> their<00:00:13.610> coach<00:00:13.910> to<00:00:14.539> reduce<00:00:14.869> the<00:00:15.080> power

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:15.259 
to their coach to reduce the power

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.560 
to their coach to reduce the power
consumption<00:00:15.889> and<00:00:16.250> improve<00:00:16.669> the<00:00:17.090> quality<00:00:17.359> of

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
consumption and improve the quality of

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.839 
consumption and improve the quality of
the<00:00:17.750> lighting<00:00:18.050> on<00:00:18.230> the<00:00:18.710> inside<00:00:18.740> rather<00:00:19.610> than

00:00:19.839 --> 00:00:19.849 
the lighting on the inside rather than

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:21.670 
the lighting on the inside rather than
replacing<00:00:20.360> light<00:00:20.810> fixtures<00:00:21.439> which

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:21.680 
replacing light fixtures which

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.670 
replacing light fixtures which
oftentimes<00:00:22.340> is<00:00:22.579> a<00:00:22.610> very<00:00:22.970> big<00:00:23.599> job<00:00:23.869> we

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:24.680 
oftentimes is a very big job we

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.010 
oftentimes is a very big job we
recommend<00:00:25.369> replacing<00:00:25.550> the<00:00:26.119> actual<00:00:26.390> bulbs

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:27.020 
recommend replacing the actual bulbs

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.109 
recommend replacing the actual bulbs

light fixtures that are installed at the

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:52.920 
light fixtures that are installed at the
factory<00:00:49.660> often<00:00:50.660> come<00:00:50.960> with<00:00:51.320> an<00:00:51.440> 11<00:00:51.770> 56<00:00:52.160> ball

are<00:01:01.430> installed<00:01:02.030> in<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.390> areas<00:01:02.660> where<00:01:02.989> they're

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:03.500 
are installed in the areas where they're

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.090 
are installed in the areas where they're
really<00:01:03.800> not<00:01:04.219> that<00:01:04.630> visible<00:01:05.630> after<00:01:06.380> you<00:01:06.890> put

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:07.100 
really not that visible after you put

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.090 
really not that visible after you put
your<00:01:07.280> cargo<00:01:08.030> in<00:01:08.240> those<00:01:08.600> bins<00:01:08.899> so<00:01:09.649> our

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
your cargo in those bins so our

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:12.550 
your cargo in those bins so our
recommendation<00:01:10.939> is<00:01:11.119> to<00:01:11.420> replace<00:01:11.780> the<00:01:12.020> fixture

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:12.560 
recommendation is to replace the fixture

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:17.649 
recommendation is to replace the fixture
with<00:01:13.189> a<00:01:14.229> actual<00:01:15.229> new<00:01:16.130> fixture<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.149> in<00:01:17.389> fact

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 
with a actual new fixture and in fact

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:19.330 
with a actual new fixture and in fact
what<00:01:17.899> we<00:01:17.929> suggest<00:01:18.499> is<00:01:18.679> that<00:01:18.709> you<00:01:18.859> take<00:01:19.189> the

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340 
what we suggest is that you take the

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.849 
what we suggest is that you take the
fixture<00:01:19.729> and<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.329> add<00:01:20.630> another<00:01:21.109> fixture<00:01:21.649> into

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
fixture and and add another fixture into

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:24.699 
fixture and and add another fixture into
the<00:01:22.310> system<00:01:22.729> if<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:23.539> have<00:01:23.569> a<00:01:23.780> master<00:01:24.380> switch

00:01:24.699 --> 00:01:24.709 
the system if you have a master switch

00:01:24.709 --> 00:01:28.510 
the system if you have a master switch
on<00:01:25.279> all<00:01:25.639> of<00:01:25.880> your<00:01:26.060> lighting<00:01:27.020> you<00:01:27.709> can<00:01:27.950> turn<00:01:28.279> the

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:28.520 
on all of your lighting you can turn the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:30.999 
on all of your lighting you can turn the
whole<00:01:28.840> incandescent<00:01:29.840> lighting<00:01:30.319> the<00:01:30.560> original

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
whole incandescent lighting the original

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:33.519 
whole incandescent lighting the original
factory<00:01:31.399> equipment<00:01:31.670> lighting<00:01:31.969> off<00:01:32.329> and<00:01:33.170> add

00:01:33.519 --> 00:01:33.529 
factory equipment lighting off and add

00:01:33.529 --> 00:01:37.419 
factory equipment lighting off and add
the<00:01:34.240> LED<00:01:35.240> lighting<00:01:35.630> as<00:01:35.749> the<00:01:36.469> primary<00:01:36.950> lighting

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
the LED lighting as the primary lighting

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:38.859 
the LED lighting as the primary lighting
source<00:01:37.670> and<00:01:37.939> that<00:01:38.149> would<00:01:38.359> be<00:01:38.450> the<00:01:38.569> one<00:01:38.719> that

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:38.869 
source and that would be the one that

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:41.469 
source and that would be the one that
you<00:01:38.990> would<00:01:39.109> leave<00:01:39.319> on<00:01:39.560> most<00:01:40.399> of<00:01:40.609> the<00:01:40.729> time<00:01:40.969> and

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
you would leave on most of the time and

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.120 
you would leave on most of the time and
in<00:01:41.599> fact<00:01:41.810> we've<00:01:42.079> every<00:01:42.349> bulb<00:01:42.590> on<00:01:42.799> and<00:01:43.039> then

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
in fact we've every bulb on and then

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.219 
in fact we've every bulb on and then
flip<00:01:43.340> them<00:01:43.520> off<00:01:43.700> with<00:01:43.939> your<00:01:44.119> master<00:01:44.479> switch<00:01:44.749> if

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
flip them off with your master switch if

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:47.319 
flip them off with your master switch if
you<00:01:45.499> have<00:01:45.709> no<00:01:45.920> lighting<00:01:46.249> down<00:01:46.579> there<00:01:46.909> then

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
you have no lighting down there then

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.209 
you have no lighting down there then
running<00:01:47.719> one<00:01:47.929> additional<00:01:48.469> wire<00:01:48.679> and<00:01:48.920> using

running one additional wire and using

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:50.739 
running one additional wire and using
the<00:01:49.310> ground<00:01:49.579> is<00:01:49.759> your<00:01:49.909> second<00:01:50.270> conductor

00:01:50.739 --> 00:01:50.749 
the ground is your second conductor

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.569 
the ground is your second conductor
gives<00:01:51.259> you<00:01:51.439> the<00:01:51.590> ability<00:01:51.709> to<00:01:52.069> put<00:01:52.310> lighting

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
gives you the ability to put lighting

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:55.059 
gives you the ability to put lighting
where<00:01:52.880> you<00:01:53.270> need<00:01:53.450> it<00:01:53.630> and<00:01:53.840> in<00:01:54.469> areas<00:01:54.859> where

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
where you need it and in areas where

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:56.810 
there are no lights currently you can

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.609 
there are no lights currently you can
additionally<00:01:57.590> add<00:01:57.950> a<00:01:58.399> bulb<00:01:59.319> socket<00:02:00.319> at<00:02:00.469> least

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
additionally add a bulb socket at least

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.899 
additionally add a bulb socket at least
a<00:02:00.770> LED<00:02:01.459> fixture<00:02:01.969> to<00:02:02.539> give<00:02:02.719> you<00:02:02.840> the<00:02:02.990> lighting

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
a LED fixture to give you the lighting

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:07.020 
a LED fixture to give you the lighting
so<00:02:04.450> in<00:02:04.750> all<00:02:04.960> three<00:02:04.990> of<00:02:05.439> those<00:02:05.560> situations<00:02:06.030> end

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:07.030 
so in all three of those situations end

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.359 
so in all three of those situations end
up<00:02:07.240> with<00:02:07.390> better<00:02:07.780> lighting<00:02:08.080> better<00:02:08.979> placement

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
up with better lighting better placement

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.339 
up with better lighting better placement
of<00:02:09.640> the<00:02:09.729> lighting<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.209> probably<00:02:11.080> a<00:02:11.110> lower

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
of the lighting and probably a lower
