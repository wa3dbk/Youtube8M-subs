00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
ago you can see how it really rose quite

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.470 
ago you can see how it really rose quite
nicely<00:00:52.579> I'm<00:00:53.579> going<00:00:53.789> to<00:00:53.850> put<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.059> little<00:00:54.300> flour

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
nicely I'm going to put a little flour

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.439 
nicely I'm going to put a little flour
onto<00:00:55.110> my<00:00:55.469> countertop<00:00:56.430> and<00:00:56.760> just<00:00:57.120> pull<00:00:57.420> that

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
onto my countertop and just pull that

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:03.979 
onto my countertop and just pull that
bread<00:00:58.199> out<00:00:58.680> as<00:00:58.890> my<00:00:59.129> maker<00:00:59.730> or<00:01:00.180> machine<00:01:02.989> and

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
bread out as my maker or machine and

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:05.179 
bread out as my maker or machine and
then<00:01:04.110> I'm<00:01:04.229> just<00:01:04.350> going<00:01:04.650> to<00:01:04.710> turn<00:01:04.979> it<00:01:05.100> around

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
then I'm just going to turn it around

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:07.820 
then I'm just going to turn it around
and<00:01:05.640> then<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.090> flour<00:01:06.360> and<00:01:06.900> what<00:01:07.049> I<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.439> to<00:01:07.650> do

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
and then the flour and what I like to do

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.770 
and then the flour and what I like to do
is<00:01:08.010> I<00:01:08.040> actually<00:01:08.310> like<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.760> cut<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.330> right<00:01:09.540> in

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
is I actually like to cut it right in

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.050 
is I actually like to cut it right in
half

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:11.060 
half

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.850 
half
and<00:01:12.060> then<00:01:12.180> you<00:01:12.299> two<00:01:12.570> equal<00:01:13.080> pieces

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
and then you two equal pieces

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.590 
and then you two equal pieces
now<00:01:14.220> you<00:01:14.310> can<00:01:14.760> bake<00:01:15.060> this<00:01:15.479> with<00:01:16.409> just<00:01:17.090> one<00:01:18.090> one

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
now you can bake this with just one one

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.380 
now you can bake this with just one one
large<00:01:19.020> loaf<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:19.979> want<00:01:20.310> but<00:01:20.640> I<00:01:20.880> tend<00:01:21.240> to

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
large loaf if you want but I tend to

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.100 
large loaf if you want but I tend to
like<00:01:22.049> to<00:01:22.250> separate<00:01:23.250> them<00:01:23.549> and<00:01:23.820> then<00:01:24.299> just

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
like to separate them and then just

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.980 
like to separate them and then just
braid<00:01:25.560> it<00:01:25.830> and<00:01:26.070> I'll<00:01:26.369> show<00:01:26.729> you<00:01:27.390> in<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.750> moment

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
braid it and I'll show you in a moment

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.859 
braid it and I'll show you in a moment
why<00:01:28.380> I<00:01:28.409> do<00:01:28.650> that<00:01:29.189> so<00:01:29.850> just<00:01:29.880> start<00:01:30.360> stretching

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
why I do that so just start stretching

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:37.410 
why I do that so just start stretching
out<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:31.680> dough<00:01:32.240> rounding<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.659> edges

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.540 

and<00:01:37.930> you<00:01:38.080> want<00:01:38.290> them<00:01:38.500> of<00:01:38.650> course<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:39.250> same

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:39.550 
and you want them of course the same

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.910 
and you want them of course the same
length<00:01:41.940> stretch<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.180> out<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.770> you're

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
length stretch it out and you're

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.820 
length stretch it out and you're
probably<00:01:45.130> stretching<00:01:45.880> it<00:01:46.080> to<00:01:47.080> about<00:01:47.409> 12

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:47.830 
probably stretching it to about 12

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.590 
probably stretching it to about 12
inches<00:01:48.280> or<00:01:48.490> so<00:01:50.190> this<00:01:51.190> Jo<00:01:51.430> is<00:01:51.610> quite<00:01:51.970> it's<00:01:52.270> very

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:52.600 
inches or so this Jo is quite it's very

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.830 
inches or so this Jo is quite it's very
nice<00:01:52.900> and<00:01:53.200> elastic<00:01:53.410> so<00:01:54.100> it<00:01:54.280> will<00:01:54.759> handle<00:01:55.330> well

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
nice and elastic so it will handle well

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.440 
nice and elastic so it will handle well
for<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:57.070> then<00:01:57.310> once<00:01:57.580> you<00:01:57.759> have<00:01:57.970> your<00:01:58.180> two

00:01:58.440 --> 00:01:58.450 
for you and then once you have your two

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.560 
for you and then once you have your two
pieces<00:01:58.500> lined<00:01:59.500> up<00:01:59.800> and<00:02:00.070> they're<00:02:00.909> relatively

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:01.570 
pieces lined up and they're relatively

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.670 
pieces lined up and they're relatively
the<00:02:01.900> same<00:02:02.610> on<00:02:03.610> the<00:02:03.850> edges<00:02:04.420> and<00:02:04.780> on<00:02:04.990> lengthened

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
the same on the edges and on lengthened

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.210 
the same on the edges and on lengthened
rift<00:02:06.300> then<00:02:07.300> I<00:02:07.330> just<00:02:07.690> actually<00:02:08.289> go<00:02:08.530> ahead<00:02:08.709> and<00:02:08.950> I

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220 
rift then I just actually go ahead and I

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:16.170 
rift then I just actually go ahead and I
just<00:02:09.250> put<00:02:09.850> one<00:02:10.739> over<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:11.890> other<00:02:15.090> tighten<00:02:16.090> it

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
just put one over the other tighten it

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.580 
just put one over the other tighten it
up<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.450> little<00:02:16.600> bit<00:02:17.019> and<00:02:17.500> once<00:02:17.739> I<00:02:17.950> do<00:02:18.010> that<00:02:19.590> then

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
up a little bit and once I do that then

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.190 
up a little bit and once I do that then
I<00:02:20.769> like<00:02:21.010> to<00:02:21.160> just<00:02:21.459> tuck<00:02:22.090> it<00:02:22.269> under<00:02:22.660> and<00:02:22.959> then

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:23.200 
I like to just tuck it under and then

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.310 
I like to just tuck it under and then
seal<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.980> together<00:02:24.550> so<00:02:24.940> that<00:02:24.970> it<00:02:25.269> doesn't<00:02:25.690> come

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:26.320 
seal it together so that it doesn't come

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:29.729 
seal it together so that it doesn't come
apart<00:02:26.440> when<00:02:27.370> you<00:02:27.400> want<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.060> bake<00:02:28.360> it<00:02:28.660> and<00:02:29.590> I'll

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
apart when you want to bake it and I'll

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:33.150 
apart when you want to bake it and I'll
do<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.070> other<00:02:30.220> side<00:02:30.580> to<00:02:31.120> pull<00:02:31.930> the<00:02:32.160> sides

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160 
do the other side to pull the sides

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.800 
do the other side to pull the sides
