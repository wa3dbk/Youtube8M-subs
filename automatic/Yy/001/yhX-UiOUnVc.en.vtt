thing that she does with her foot and it
just<00:01:51.820> has<00:01:51.910> to<00:01:52.030> be<00:01:52.120> sharp<00:01:53.970> not<00:01:54.970> first<00:01:55.240> I<00:01:55.450> was

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.780 
the biggest part isn't just learning it
it's<00:02:07.990> just<00:02:08.200> perfecting<00:02:08.860> it<00:02:09.040> and<00:02:09.070> putting<00:02:09.670> your
