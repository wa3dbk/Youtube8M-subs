00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:17.400
 so be it people welcome 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.760
 back to a new gta 5 video today 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:23.970
 I want to show you where you are 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.029
 hidden car and that too 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:30.119
 known as bugatti veyron finds and 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.009
 Although a gta 5 for free normally 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.320
 is it so this car costs one 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.760
 million dollars and that is 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.790
 Of course, a whole bar 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.579
 money and I want to show you today 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.079
 we can spare you that it is so 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.640
 the car is not always at this 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.399
 Of course it also goes around so 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.289
 the car also belongs to someone of that 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.550
 I would suggest it best 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.590
 always at different times of the day 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.239
 to watch 

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.230
 I usually have the car at noon 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.579
 found around 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.649
 So say if you like the 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.840
 At lunch time you can find it there 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.820
 regularly files directly there so from 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.960
 michael's house is really right 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.869
 really close 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.650
 that means we just drive these 

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.049
 road along here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.479
 the best directly in all the cars 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.799
 by the way, rhein has been noticed 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.259
 The cars do not go on the side 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.420
 and then I already confessed 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.220
 I'll make a nice meet here 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.380
 the lawn and then I'll show you the 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.689
 careggi stands here 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.880
 there is the beautiful things so really 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.070
 not bad the cart that's it 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.229
 fastest car in gta there is no 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.900
 faster car and it really costs 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.909
 a mille i'll show you now again 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.130
 on the map where you find the part 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.479
 so that's right here it is in 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.000
 rich quarter there you will also find 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:44.340
 several audi r8 for example the chambers 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.619
 so get the replica of the 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.829
 audi r8 but this bugatti is 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:51.570
 of course, more of a matter for yourself 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.329
 the part looks cool and first 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.790
 Second , it had really fat speed 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:58.140
 Of course you have to do that too 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.450
 say the very best is natural 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.280
 this part is also tune so that was 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.409
 means you can at the part a lot around 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:06.540
 I want to tune that, of course 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.989
 Now let's show that means we 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.479
 driving good times in here'm westcoast 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.489
 crass 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.680
 I think he is a bit different here 

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:17.080
 as an experienced nice and clean then 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.670
 Let's do the car full crack what 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.379
 stop is currently available i have 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.409
 Unfortunately, not all switched freely 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.239
 but quite a lot 

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:27.340
 So that's a little tip though 

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:31.239
 Being followed by the bulls is easy 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:32.980
 drive here in our workshop so 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:35.260
 there is no problem here 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.989
 just go santos customs 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.980
 drive then are the want history 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.200
 works relatively easy I know 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:42.849
 not why that worked is 

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.769
 actually much more than coincidence 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.090
 thought and that we one the whole time 

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:49.000
 bit in the fast-forward I have 

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.980
 now almost 700,000 and do it now 

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.450
 Full in the armor sport brake 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:54.340
 series engine the best thing just now 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.980
 currently available from my side 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.629
 I want that black one, of course 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.150
 license plate looks really cool 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:03.220
 and I think the colors fit 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.900
 actually, that's how you could of course 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:07.329
 now also a fully stripped down 

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.799
 take color but basically think 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.450
 I think it's best to go black 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.700
 somehow black metallic or something like that 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:13.900
 looks really good in it 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.400
 You start doing eight good ones 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.810
 take a little bit different though 

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.049
 somehow I'm on my own after all 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:21.340
 end then for the strip in orange 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:22.209
 decided that I just think 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.900
 most 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:28.299
 and just like this mature smokes 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.950
 just a really cool thing so 

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:30.910
 a lot of custom as you feel in again 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.730
 the time of need for speed 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.840
 set back and you can give me so times 

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:37.090
 write it under me whether that part already 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.919
 have bought somewhere so speak so 

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:40.780
 he really spent a mille 

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:42.370
 for the thing or if it really is 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.720
 coincidentally found 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:46.150
 write me again in the comments 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:49.750
 what is your favorite car in gta 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:51.130
 5 until now and then I would 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:52.480
 If you like this video of course 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.700
 also commented on 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.200
 and if you did not know that yet 

00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:57.669
 write me again if now 

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:00.280
 knew or not 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.900
 and as I said thank you for seeing 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:06.030
 hopefully you liked it until the 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.030
 next time different juul servus 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.180
 8th
