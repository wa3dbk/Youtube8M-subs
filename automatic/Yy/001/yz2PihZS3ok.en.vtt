00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
fascinated with his Steadicam shots and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.920 
fascinated with his Steadicam shots and
when<00:00:22.680> we<00:00:22.769> talking<00:00:23.070> about<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.939> hand<00:00:24.480> held<00:00:24.660> steady

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
when we talking about a hand held steady

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.130 
when we talking about a hand held steady
cam<00:00:25.199> and<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:25.529> it<00:00:25.710> works<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.779> what<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.810> bought

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
cam and how it works and what I bought

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.320 
cam and how it works and what I bought
and<00:00:28.550> also<00:00:29.550> show<00:00:29.820> you<00:00:29.849> a<00:00:29.939> little<00:00:30.060> bit<00:00:30.150> of

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:30.330 
and also show you a little bit of

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.120 
and also show you a little bit of
footage<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.170> just<00:00:31.439> carrying<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:31.800> camera

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
footage of just carrying the camera

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.479 
footage of just carrying the camera
handheld<00:00:32.430> and<00:00:33.000> then<00:00:33.300> also<00:00:33.450> video<00:00:33.930> with<00:00:34.920> using

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
handheld and then also video with using

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.119 
handheld and then also video with using
the<00:00:35.640> inhale<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.420> became<00:00:36.690> so<00:00:37.559> what<00:00:37.829> this<00:00:37.950> is

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
the inhale that became so what this is

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.510 
the inhale that became so what this is
this<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> a<00:00:38.489> high<00:00:39.329> camp<00:00:39.629> 5000<00:00:40.290> I<00:00:40.850> got<00:00:41.850> this<00:00:42.059> from

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
this is a high camp 5000 I got this from

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.850 
this is a high camp 5000 I got this from
ebay<00:00:44.520> i<00:00:44.550> think<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:44.879> was<00:00:44.940> about<00:00:45.030> 150<00:00:45.660> 150<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.230> 170

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
ebay i think it was about 150 150 to 170

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
ebay i think it was about 150 150 to 170
somewhere<00:00:47.190> in<00:00:47.250> that<00:00:47.309> ballpark<00:00:47.399> it<00:00:48.000> comes<00:00:48.210> with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
somewhere in that ballpark it comes with

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.869 
somewhere in that ballpark it comes with
different<00:00:48.629> weights<00:00:48.840> on<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.020> bottom<00:00:49.440> and<00:00:49.879> this

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
different weights on the bottom and this

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.799 
different weights on the bottom and this
balance<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.190> whole<00:00:53.190> contraption<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:54.059> how

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
balance and whole contraption and how

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.229 
balance and whole contraption and how
this<00:00:54.960> supposed<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.379> work<00:00:55.410> is<00:00:55.860> that<00:00:56.309> if<00:00:56.940> you're

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
this supposed to work is that if you're

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.500 
this supposed to work is that if you're
just<00:00:57.539> holding<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.379> camera<00:00:58.620> regular<00:00:59.510> walking

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
just holding the camera regular walking

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.959 
just holding the camera regular walking
with<00:01:00.870> it<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.770> know<00:01:01.890> the<00:01:02.219> moves<00:01:02.489> around<00:01:02.699> quite

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
with it you know the moves around quite

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.609 
with it you know the moves around quite
a<00:01:03.000> bit<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.329> it's<00:01:03.539> just<00:01:03.600> bouncing<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:04.170> the

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
a bit because it's just bouncing on the

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.050 
a bit because it's just bouncing on the
end<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.949> your<00:01:05.010> hand<00:01:05.309> your<00:01:05.460> hand<00:01:05.489> just<00:01:05.820> trying

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
end of your hand your hand just trying

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.679 
end of your hand your hand just trying
to<00:01:06.150> keep<00:01:06.299> it<00:01:06.479> keep<00:01:07.110> it<00:01:07.229> now<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.950> guess<00:01:08.460> steady<00:01:09.450> so

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
to keep it keep it now I guess steady so

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.410 
to keep it keep it now I guess steady so
to<00:01:09.750> speak<00:01:09.990> and<00:01:10.260> in<00:01:10.710> one<00:01:11.369> particular<00:01:11.520> location

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
to speak and in one particular location

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.330 
to speak and in one particular location
so<00:01:13.409> what<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.250> does<00:01:14.610> is<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.450> it<00:01:16.189> gives<00:01:17.189> you<00:01:17.310> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
so what this does is that it gives you a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.270 
so what this does is that it gives you a
handle<00:01:17.970> to<00:01:18.000> hold<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.509> the<00:01:18.659> bottom<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.409> what

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
handle to hold on to the bottom and what

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.700 
handle to hold on to the bottom and what
you<00:01:20.369> want<00:01:20.610> to<00:01:20.729> do<00:01:20.820> is<00:01:20.939> you<00:01:20.970> want<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.270> try<00:01:21.479> to<00:01:21.710> set

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
you want to do is you want to try to set

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.130 
you want to do is you want to try to set
the<00:01:22.830> weights<00:01:23.009> here<00:01:23.369> on<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.060> bottom<00:01:24.210> to

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
the weights here on the bottom to

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
the weights here on the bottom to
balance<00:01:25.590> out<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> inertia<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.700> the<00:01:27.119> camera

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
balance out the inertia of the camera

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.550 
balance out the inertia of the camera
that's<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.869> be<00:01:27.960> sitting<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.259> the<00:01:28.350> town

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
that's going to be sitting out the town

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.770 
that's going to be sitting out the town
so<00:01:28.860> with<00:01:29.490> the<00:01:29.579> camera<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.939> top<00:01:30.119> it's<00:01:30.600> going<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
so with the camera on top it's going to

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.620 
so with the camera on top it's going to
want<00:01:30.960> to<00:01:30.990> Teeter<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.470> fall<00:01:32.430> off<00:01:32.549> kilter<00:01:32.939> so

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
want to Teeter and fall off kilter so

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.960 
want to Teeter and fall off kilter so
the<00:01:34.140> top<00:01:34.380> piece<00:01:34.650> here<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.400> can<00:01:35.549> actually<00:01:35.700> move

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the top piece here you can actually move

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.719 
the top piece here you can actually move
it<00:01:36.180> forward<00:01:36.479> backwards<00:01:37.140> and<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:38.009> and<00:01:38.340> left<00:01:38.549> to

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
it forward backwards and out and left to

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.870 
it forward backwards and out and left to
right<00:01:38.909> so<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.409> center<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:40.979> gravity<00:01:41.250> of<00:01:41.759> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
right so the center of gravity of the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:47.660 
right so the center of gravity of the
camera<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.420> hopefully<00:01:42.979> on<00:01:44.840> this<00:01:45.840> this<00:01:46.770> axis<00:01:47.520> of

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
camera is hopefully on this this axis of

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.700 
camera is hopefully on this this axis of
the<00:01:47.880> of<00:01:48.149> the<00:01:49.200> game

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
the of the game

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.560 
the of the game
and<00:01:49.799> then<00:01:50.400> based<00:01:50.729> on<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.030> weight<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.450> the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
and then based on the weight of the

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.410 
and then based on the weight of the
camera<00:01:52.049> you<00:01:52.799> want<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.280> move<00:01:53.940> these<00:01:54.119> weights

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
camera you want to move these weights

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.030 
camera you want to move these weights
are<00:01:54.540> on<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.810> bottom<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.200> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.560> add

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
are on at the bottom a little bit add

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.160 
are on at the bottom a little bit add
weights<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.760> if<00:01:56.970> you<00:01:57.060> have<00:01:57.270> to<00:01:57.479> also<00:01:57.659> pull

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
weights and if you have to also pull

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.530 
weights and if you have to also pull
pull<00:01:58.590> this<00:01:58.710> down<00:01:58.860> farther<00:01:59.250> when<00:02:00.210> I<00:02:00.240> first

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
pull this down farther when I first

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.020 
pull this down farther when I first
bought<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.140> thing<00:02:01.409> I<00:02:01.680> planned<00:02:02.400> on<00:02:02.580> using<00:02:02.790> it

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
bought this thing I planned on using it

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:06.620 
bought this thing I planned on using it
from<00:02:03.210> an<00:02:03.330> XL<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:04.020> which<00:02:05.180> it<00:02:06.180> shows<00:02:06.420> in<00:02:06.540> the

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
from an XL to which it shows in the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.780 
from an XL to which it shows in the
picture<00:02:06.990> but<00:02:08.179> it<00:02:09.179> could<00:02:09.840> work<00:02:10.080> with<00:02:10.259> it<00:02:10.440> oh

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:10.790 
picture but it could work with it oh

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.180 
picture but it could work with it oh
just<00:02:11.790> hand<00:02:12.180> holding<00:02:12.510> it<00:02:12.630> with<00:02:12.720> your<00:02:12.900> arm<00:02:13.190> just

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
just hand holding it with your arm just

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.150 
just hand holding it with your arm just
seeing<00:02:14.430> with<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.239> xl2<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.890> incredibly<00:02:16.890> heavy

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
seeing with the xl2 is incredibly heavy

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.460 
seeing with the xl2 is incredibly heavy
so<00:02:17.970> actually<00:02:18.270> it's<00:02:19.200> not<00:02:19.560> going<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:19.860> work<00:02:20.150> so

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
so actually it's not going to work so

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.160 
so actually it's not going to work so
this<00:02:22.470> is<00:02:22.590> what<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> bought<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.580> so<00:02:24.540> once<00:02:25.080> you

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:25.170 
this is what I bought and so once you

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.259 
this is what I bought and so once you
have<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.470> weights<00:02:25.680> in<00:02:25.830> the<00:02:25.860> bottom<00:02:26.250> what<00:02:27.120> your

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:27.269 
have the weights in the bottom what your

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:29.750 
have the weights in the bottom what your
goal<00:02:27.690> is<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.989> once<00:02:28.350> again<00:02:28.470> to<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.890> the<00:02:29.160> moment

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
goal is to once again to have the moment

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.120 
goal is to once again to have the moment
of<00:02:29.850> inertia<00:02:30.150> of<00:02:30.330> the<00:02:30.420> same<00:02:30.630> so<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.260> smaller

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
of inertia of the same so the smaller

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.310 
of inertia of the same so the smaller
weights<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.730> the<00:02:32.820> bottom<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.080> will<00:02:34.230> be

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
weights on the bottom and this will be

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.420 
weights on the bottom and this will be
bouncing<00:02:34.769> up<00:02:34.830> the<00:02:35.280> bottom<00:02:35.640> area<00:02:36.830> of<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.220> time

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
bouncing up the bottom area of the time

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.880 
bouncing up the bottom area of the time
so<00:02:38.730> I<00:02:38.760> mean<00:02:39.000> this<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.269> the<00:02:39.750> difference<00:02:39.959> of<00:02:40.410> the

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
so I mean this is the difference of the

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.680 
so I mean this is the difference of the
distances<00:02:41.489> from<00:02:41.610> the<00:02:41.760> middle<00:02:42.030> the<00:02:42.420> center

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
distances from the middle the center

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.509 
distances from the middle the center
point<00:02:42.840> of<00:02:42.959> the<00:02:43.019> hand<00:02:43.290> so<00:02:44.040> this<00:02:44.220> one's<00:02:44.400> already

00:02:44.509 --> 00:02:44.519 
point of the hand so this one's already

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:47.030 
point of the hand so this one's already
not<00:02:45.120> perfect<00:02:45.750> not<00:02:46.080> perfectly<00:02:46.500> balanced<00:02:46.890> but

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
not perfect not perfectly balanced but

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.220 
not perfect not perfectly balanced but
awfully<00:02:47.459> close<00:02:47.760> so<00:02:48.269> if<00:02:48.360> you<00:02:48.480> move<00:02:48.780> it<00:02:48.989> it's

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
awfully close so if you move it it's

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.890 
awfully close so if you move it it's
sort<00:02:49.620> of<00:02:49.890> you<00:02:50.760> know<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:51.060> left<00:02:51.239> eye<00:02:51.390> so<00:02:51.690> you<00:02:51.780> can

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
sort of you know the left eye so you can

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.470 
sort of you know the left eye so you can
see<00:02:52.050> a<00:02:52.080> sort<00:02:52.290> of<00:02:52.350> tilt<00:02:52.590> oh<00:02:52.709> so<00:02:53.430> move<00:02:54.209> around

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
see a sort of tilt oh so move around

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.509 
see a sort of tilt oh so move around
like<00:02:54.630> that<00:02:54.840> and<00:02:55.590> when<00:02:55.620> you're<00:02:55.950> using<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.430> you

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:56.519 
like that and when you're using it you

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:58.190 
like that and when you're using it you
want<00:02:56.700> to<00:02:56.790> kind<00:02:56.880> of<00:02:56.970> keep<00:02:57.150> this<00:02:57.299> hand<00:02:57.570> close<00:02:57.959> to

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
want to kind of keep this hand close to

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.920 
want to kind of keep this hand close to
sort<00:02:58.500> of<00:02:58.850> steady<00:02:59.850> the<00:03:00.329> other<00:03:00.450> movement<00:03:00.900> a

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
sort of steady the other movement a

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:03.949 
sort of steady the other movement a
little<00:03:00.959> bit<00:03:02.000> and<00:03:03.000> then<00:03:03.209> also<00:03:03.360> up<00:03:03.690> the<00:03:03.810> down

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
little bit and then also up the down

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.890 
little bit and then also up the down
left<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.380> right<00:03:04.590> but<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:06.239> know<00:03:06.360> it's<00:03:06.750> supposed

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
left to right but you know it's supposed

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:10.270 
left to right but you know it's supposed
to<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.410> able<00:03:07.470> to<00:03:07.650> move<00:03:07.769> around<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.660> really

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:10.280 
to be able to move around and not really

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.850 
to be able to move around and not really
sway<00:03:11.280> a<00:03:11.310> lot<00:03:11.610> and<00:03:12.079> then<00:03:13.079> you'll<00:03:13.500> use<00:03:13.709> your

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
sway a lot and then you'll use your

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:18.170 
sway a lot and then you'll use your
other<00:03:13.920> hand<00:03:14.160> to<00:03:14.280> pan<00:03:15.170> and<00:03:16.640> this<00:03:17.640> isn't<00:03:17.970> so<00:03:18.150> bad

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
other hand to pan and this isn't so bad

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.030 
other hand to pan and this isn't so bad
useful<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.959> know<00:03:19.019> for<00:03:19.260> a<00:03:19.290> little<00:03:19.410> while<00:03:19.650> for

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
useful you know for a little while for

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.880 
useful you know for a little while for
some<00:03:20.100> shots<00:03:20.579> and<00:03:20.790> stuff<00:03:21.000> but<00:03:21.750> if<00:03:22.079> you're<00:03:22.620> using

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
some shots and stuff but if you're using

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:25.550 
some shots and stuff but if you're using
it<00:03:23.190> for<00:03:23.610> a<00:03:23.820> lot<00:03:24.090> of<00:03:24.299> shots<00:03:24.510> in<00:03:24.720> a<00:03:24.750> row<00:03:24.810> with<00:03:25.350> not

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
it for a lot of shots in a row with not

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.270 
it for a lot of shots in a row with not
a<00:03:25.590> lot<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.799> cuts<00:03:26.450> it<00:03:27.450> your<00:03:27.900> arm<00:03:28.110> does<00:03:28.590> get<00:03:28.920> tired

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
a lot of cuts it your arm does get tired

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:30.890 
a lot of cuts it your arm does get tired
your<00:03:29.640> wrist<00:03:29.880> so<00:03:30.000> skill<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.329> type<00:03:30.540> from

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
your wrist so skill to type from

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.069 
your wrist so skill to type from
upholding<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.590> area<00:03:32.120> but<00:03:33.120> i<00:03:33.450> think<00:03:33.660> it's

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:34.079 
upholding in this area but i think it's

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:38.720 
upholding in this area but i think it's
still<00:03:34.970> 450<00:03:35.970> bucks<00:03:36.239> it<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.230> it<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.310> nothing<00:03:38.609> day

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:38.730 
still 450 bucks it is it is nothing day

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:40.910 
still 450 bucks it is it is nothing day
better<00:03:39.060> than<00:03:39.420> just<00:03:40.140> hand<00:03:40.350> holding<00:03:40.590> the<00:03:40.650> camera

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
better than just hand holding the camera

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:43.819 
better than just hand holding the camera
so<00:03:41.390> check<00:03:42.390> out<00:03:42.450> the<00:03:42.600> other<00:03:42.660> videos<00:03:43.019> of<00:03:43.290> before

sled but there's a whole big contraption

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.020 
sled but there's a whole big contraption
for<00:04:00.019> Hollywood<00:04:00.590> city<00:04:00.830> camps<00:04:01.190> but<00:04:01.640> those<00:04:01.790> range

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.030 
for Hollywood city camps but those range

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.970 
for Hollywood city camps but those range
somewhere<00:04:02.269> around<00:04:02.420> five<00:04:03.260> to<00:04:03.470> eight<00:04:03.590> thousand

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:03.980 
somewhere around five to eight thousand

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.550 
somewhere around five to eight thousand
dollars<00:04:04.280> and<00:04:04.569> you<00:04:05.569> know<00:04:05.690> they're<00:04:06.019> clearly

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
dollars and you know they're clearly

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:09.850 
dollars and you know they're clearly
much<00:04:06.830> better<00:04:07.099> but<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.910> difference<00:04:08.000> is<00:04:08.860> eight

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860 
much better but the difference is eight

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.020 
much better but the difference is eight

about the 5km five thousand it does take
some<00:04:36.860> effort<00:04:37.040> it<00:04:37.250> takes<00:04:37.340> some<00:04:37.580> practice<00:04:37.820> so<00:04:38.720> if

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810

camera on top it's it's not going to

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:46.990 
camera on top it's it's not going to
work<00:04:45.530> it's<00:04:45.740> going<00:04:45.830> to<00:04:45.919> look<00:04:46.070> terrible<00:04:46.310> but<00:04:46.760> it

takes some time work on trying to bounce
this<00:04:49.250> out<00:04:49.600> try<00:04:50.600> to<00:04:50.660> find<00:04:50.990> the<00:04:51.110> access<00:04:51.530> point

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
this out try to find the access point

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.820 
this out try to find the access point
and<00:04:52.070> then<00:04:52.850> also<00:04:53.120> get<00:04:53.960> used<00:04:54.200> to<00:04:54.320> walking<00:04:54.440> around

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
and then also get used to walking around

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.680 
and then also get used to walking around
with<00:04:55.010> it<00:04:55.130> and<00:04:55.250> trying<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.060> keep<00:04:56.180> it<00:04:56.270> a<00:04:56.389> level

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
with it and trying to keep it a level

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.170 
with it and trying to keep it a level
point<00:04:56.990> and<00:04:57.169> try<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.380> keep<00:04:57.620> be<00:04:58.340> able<00:04:58.580> to<00:04:58.669> pan<00:04:58.970> and

00:04:59.170 --> 00:04:59.180 
point and try to keep be able to pan and

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.060 
point and try to keep be able to pan and
move<00:04:59.360> the<00:04:59.539> thing<00:04:59.750> without<00:05:00.560> really<00:05:00.830> screwing

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
move the thing without really screwing

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.310 
move the thing without really screwing
up<00:05:01.220> too<00:05:01.400> bad<00:05:01.580> but<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.660> does<00:05:02.840> take<00:05:03.020> some<00:05:03.139> effort

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
up too bad but it does take some effort

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.020 
up too bad but it does take some effort
take<00:05:03.680> some<00:05:03.830> time<00:05:04.010> but<00:05:04.220> it's<00:05:04.370> definitely<00:05:04.639> worth

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:05.030 
take some time but it's definitely worth

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:07.540 
take some time but it's definitely worth
it<00:05:05.210> and<00:05:05.389> definitely<00:05:05.630> the<00:05:06.590> time<00:05:07.100> is<00:05:07.220> spent<00:05:07.400> to

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:07.550 
it and definitely the time is spent to

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.879 
it and definitely the time is spent to
be<00:05:07.639> familiar<00:05:08.060> with<00:05:08.090> it<00:05:08.360> is<00:05:08.780> well<00:05:09.050> spent<00:05:09.229> and<00:05:09.590> I

00:05:09.879 --> 00:05:09.889 
be familiar with it is well spent and I

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:11.409 
be familiar with it is well spent and I
think<00:05:10.130> that<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.610> can<00:05:10.760> find<00:05:10.970> some<00:05:11.120> pretty<00:05:11.300> good

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:11.419 
think that you can find some pretty good

00:05:11.419 --> 00:05:12.909 
think that you can find some pretty good
results<00:05:11.479> if<00:05:11.930> you<00:05:12.020> spend<00:05:12.229> more<00:05:12.350> you<00:05:12.560> know<00:05:12.650> if

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
results if you spend more you know if

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:14.800 
results if you spend more you know if
you<00:05:13.039> use<00:05:13.190> a<00:05:13.220> lot<00:05:13.550> and<00:05:13.820> get<00:05:14.060> used<00:05:14.270> to<00:05:14.419> using<00:05:14.539> it

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:14.810 
you use a lot and get used to using it

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:18.070 
you use a lot and get used to using it
so<00:05:16.180> there<00:05:17.180> you<00:05:17.210> go<00:05:17.270> check<00:05:17.510> out<00:05:17.600> check<00:05:17.840> out<00:05:17.960> the
