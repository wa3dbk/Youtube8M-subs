put<00:00:16.139> on<00:00:16.230> backward<00:00:16.740> okay<00:00:17.039> I'm<00:00:17.490> sitting<00:00:17.880> here

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
put on backward okay I'm sitting here

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.660 
put on backward okay I'm sitting here
obsessing<00:00:18.270> over<00:00:19.020> that<00:00:19.289> no<00:00:19.920> throttle<00:00:20.250> body

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
obsessing over that no throttle body

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.820 
obsessing over that no throttle body
then<00:00:21.090> I<00:00:21.300> look<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.720> I<00:00:21.840> see<00:00:22.080> all<00:00:22.260> right<00:00:22.500> back

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
then I look and I see all right back

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.939 
then I look and I see all right back
here<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.460> believe<00:00:24.029> this<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.330> the<00:00:24.480> lq9<00:00:25.470> which<00:00:25.830> is

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
here I believe this is the lq9 which is

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.540 
here I believe this is the lq9 which is
like<00:00:26.119> 345<00:00:27.119> horsepower<00:00:27.800> aluminum<00:00:28.800> head<00:00:29.010> steel

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
like 345 horsepower aluminum head steel

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.720 
like 345 horsepower aluminum head steel
block<00:00:29.939> he<00:00:30.599> basically<00:00:31.050> came<00:00:31.500> in<00:00:31.949> some<00:00:32.579> of<00:00:32.669> the

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
block he basically came in some of the

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.270 
block he basically came in some of the
later<00:00:32.940> Denalis<00:00:33.510> and<00:00:33.870> basically<00:00:34.680> was<00:00:34.860> made<00:00:35.070> for

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
later Denalis and basically was made for

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.700 
later Denalis and basically was made for
the<00:00:35.340> Escalade<00:00:35.940> and<00:00:36.540> what's<00:00:37.380> with<00:00:37.530> the

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
the Escalade and what's with the

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.830 
the Escalade and what's with the
throttle<00:00:37.920> body<00:00:38.160> that's<00:00:38.399> not<00:00:38.550> fly<00:00:39.000> by<00:00:39.239> cable

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
throttle body that's not fly by cable

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.220 
throttle body that's not fly by cable
what<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> fly<00:00:40.379> by<00:00:40.590> wire<00:00:41.000> okay<00:00:42.000> what<00:00:42.899> year<00:00:43.110> is

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
what to fly by wire okay what year is

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.750 
what to fly by wire okay what year is
that<00:00:43.260> setup<00:00:43.739> I<00:00:43.980> see<00:00:44.129> it's<00:00:44.250> a<00:00:44.309> little<00:00:44.550> different

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
that setup I see it's a little different

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.229 
that setup I see it's a little different
than<00:00:45.059> my<00:00:45.210> o2<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.140> is<00:00:46.350> a<00:00:46.379> no.3<00:00:46.920> okay<00:00:47.879> so<00:00:47.940> they

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
than my o2 this is a no.3 okay so they

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.000 
than my o2 this is a no.3 okay so they
change<00:00:48.539> that<00:00:48.780> throttle<00:00:49.200> body<00:00:49.410> connector

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010 
change that throttle body connector

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.529 
change that throttle body connector
right<00:00:50.750> oh<00:00:51.750> to<00:00:52.440> as<00:00:52.680> a<00:00:52.710> stand-alone<00:00:53.430> year<00:00:54.090> okay

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
right oh to as a stand-alone year okay

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.240 
right oh to as a stand-alone year okay
and<00:00:54.809> why<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.020> you<00:00:55.199> put<00:00:55.440> these<00:00:55.590> on<00:00:55.649> there<00:00:56.070> since

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and why do you put these on there since

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.529 
and why do you put these on there since
they're<00:00:56.340> just<00:00:56.520> one<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.820> these<00:00:56.879> on<00:00:57.149> a<00:00:57.180> normal

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539

the<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.390> ECM<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.500> light<00:01:25.799> up<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> mi<00:01:26.729> L<00:01:27.000> or

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
the the ECM to light up the mi L or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.800 
the the ECM to light up the mi L or
check<00:01:27.900> engine<00:01:28.110> light<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:29.340> sends<00:01:30.030> power<00:01:30.360> or

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
check engine light it sends power or

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:31.429 
check engine light it sends power or
ground

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
ground

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.679 
ground
shinza<00:01:32.040> grind<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> sends<00:01:32.850> a<00:01:32.909> ground<00:01:33.210> so<00:01:33.509> what

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
shinza grind it sends a ground so what

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:34.999 
shinza grind it sends a ground so what
they<00:01:33.840> would<00:01:34.020> do<00:01:34.170> to<00:01:34.200> make<00:01:34.439> their<00:01:34.590> check<00:01:34.799> engine

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
they would do to make their check engine

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.410 
they would do to make their check engine
light<00:01:35.369> work<00:01:35.579> with<00:01:35.759> one<00:01:35.939> of<00:01:35.970> these<00:01:36.150> harnesses

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
light work with one of these harnesses

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.440 
light work with one of these harnesses
is<00:01:37.250> hook<00:01:38.250> that<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.700> the<00:01:39.000> check<00:01:39.240> engine

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
is hook that up to the check engine

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.990 
is hook that up to the check engine
light<00:01:39.810> wire<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.619> we<00:01:40.740> provide<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.549> then<00:01:41.790> run

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
light wire that we provide and then run

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.880 
light wire that we provide and then run
it<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> power<00:01:42.600> source<00:01:42.930> constant<00:01:43.710> power

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
it to a power source constant power

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.460 
it to a power source constant power
source<00:01:44.220> like<00:01:44.310> okay<00:01:44.880> so<00:01:45.210> we're<00:01:45.509> happy<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:46.140> like

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
familiar with a tough truck basically

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.719 
familiar with a tough truck basically
it's<00:02:07.500> a<00:02:07.649> truck<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.069> take<00:02:08.340> around<00:02:08.550> an

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
it's a truck that you take around an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.449 
it's a truck that you take around an
obstacle<00:02:09.090> course<00:02:09.450> and<00:02:09.720> hold<00:02:10.080> on<00:02:10.500> it<00:02:11.009> is

00:02:11.449 --> 00:02:11.459 
obstacle course and hold on it is

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:13.940 
obstacle course and hold on it is
brutal<00:02:11.819> on<00:02:12.030> man<00:02:12.420> and<00:02:12.719> equipment<00:02:13.560> but<00:02:13.829> it's

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
brutal on man and equipment but it's

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:15.110 
brutal on man and equipment but it's
very<00:02:14.159> fun<00:02:14.430> to<00:02:14.549> watch

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
very fun to watch

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:16.910 
very fun to watch
I<00:02:15.150> believe<00:02:15.780> he's<00:02:15.989> turned<00:02:16.290> his<00:02:16.469> around<00:02:16.709> like

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
I believe he's turned his around like

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.679 
I believe he's turned his around like
this<00:02:17.069> too<00:02:17.310> so<00:02:17.519> he<00:02:17.670> could<00:02:17.819> suck<00:02:18.060> from<00:02:18.269> the<00:02:18.359> cabs

00:02:18.679 --> 00:02:18.689 
this too so he could suck from the cabs

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:20.209 
this too so he could suck from the cabs
who<00:02:18.900> doesn't<00:02:19.140> have<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.349> worry<00:02:19.560> about<00:02:19.709> water<00:02:20.069> or

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:20.219 
who doesn't have to worry about water or

00:02:20.219 --> 00:02:23.209 
who doesn't have to worry about water or
mud<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:21.540> no<00:02:21.780> it<00:02:21.930> looks<00:02:22.109> like<00:02:22.290> a<00:02:22.319> great<00:02:22.590> job<00:02:22.890> and

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:23.219 
mud so no it looks like a great job and

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.619 
mud so no it looks like a great job and
then<00:02:23.310> down<00:02:23.519> here<00:02:23.819> I<00:02:23.849> take<00:02:24.150> it<00:02:24.299> that's<00:02:24.420> the

00:02:24.619 --> 00:02:24.629 
then down here I take it that's the

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.860 
then down here I take it that's the
reprogrammed<00:02:25.260> ECM<00:02:25.829> look<00:02:26.659> okay

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:27.870 
reprogrammed ECM look okay

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.599 
reprogrammed ECM look okay
I<00:02:27.900> see<00:02:28.409> you've<00:02:28.560> labeled<00:02:28.829> everything<00:02:29.250> juice

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:29.609 
I see you've labeled everything juice

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.619 
I see you've labeled everything juice
that<00:02:29.760> makes<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:30.120> see<00:02:32.060> that<00:02:33.060> makes<00:02:33.269> it<00:02:33.450> nice<00:02:33.569> and

00:02:33.619 --> 00:02:33.629 
that makes it see that makes it nice and

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:34.250 
that makes it see that makes it nice and
easy

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
easy

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.530 
easy
I<00:02:34.290> don't<00:02:35.250> even<00:02:35.340> have<00:02:35.489> glasses<00:02:35.730> on<00:02:36.000> I<00:02:36.209> can<00:02:36.359> read

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
I don't even have glasses on I can read

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.280 
I don't even have glasses on I can read
that<00:02:37.010> and<00:02:38.010> oh<00:02:38.579> yeah<00:02:38.939> this<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.150> fly-by-wire<00:02:39.750> so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
that and oh yeah this is fly-by-wire so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.240 
that and oh yeah this is fly-by-wire so
you've<00:02:40.500> included<00:02:42.200> the<00:02:43.200> attack<00:02:43.530> module<00:02:44.069> would

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
you've included the attack module would

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.759 
you've included the attack module would
be<00:02:44.519> right<00:02:44.939> there<00:02:45.180> right<00:02:45.629> and<00:02:45.840> of<00:02:46.470> course<00:02:46.500> the

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
be right there right and of course the

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:48.830 
be right there right and of course the
pedal<00:02:47.129> is<00:02:47.310> the<00:02:47.609> pedal<00:02:47.909> and<00:02:48.389> that'll<00:02:48.659> mount

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
pedal is the pedal and that'll mount

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.240 
pedal is the pedal and that'll mount
which<00:02:48.959> is<00:02:49.049> pretty<00:02:49.439> much<00:02:49.590> anywhere<00:02:49.980> on<00:02:50.159> the

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
which is pretty much anywhere on the

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.409 
which is pretty much anywhere on the
firewall<00:02:50.669> and<00:02:50.849> away<00:02:51.030> you<00:02:51.060> go

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:51.419 
firewall and away you go

00:02:51.419 --> 00:02:55.069 
firewall and away you go
yep<00:02:52.069> okay<00:02:53.069> great<00:02:53.609> and<00:02:53.760> then<00:02:54.030> I<00:02:54.359> guess<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> one

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
yep okay great and then I guess this one

00:02:55.079 --> 00:02:58.129 
yep okay great and then I guess this one
is<00:02:55.230> getting<00:02:55.439> a<00:02:55.939> mechanical<00:02:56.939> fan<00:02:57.209> but<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:57.810> have

00:02:58.129 --> 00:02:58.139 
is getting a mechanical fan but you have

00:02:58.139 --> 00:03:00.770 
is getting a mechanical fan but you have
also<00:02:58.319> come<00:02:58.530> up<00:02:58.919> with<00:02:59.129> a<00:02:59.159> method<00:02:59.609> of<00:02:59.790> running<00:03:00.299> a

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
also come up with a method of running a

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.670 
also come up with a method of running a
wire<00:03:01.909> so<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.000> can<00:03:03.269> have<00:03:03.419> a<00:03:03.450> relay<00:03:04.079> if<00:03:04.379> I've<00:03:04.500> got

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
wire so you can have a relay if I've got

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.089 
wire so you can have a relay if I've got
this<00:03:04.799> correct<00:03:05.129> to<00:03:05.370> run<00:03:05.959> electric<00:03:06.959> fans<00:03:07.319> okay

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 
this correct to run electric fans okay

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.089 
this correct to run electric fans okay
now<00:03:08.549> I've<00:03:08.790> gotta<00:03:09.000> ask<00:03:09.439> that<00:03:10.439> wire<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:10.980> comes

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
now I've gotta ask that wire that comes

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:14.569 
now I've gotta ask that wire that comes
out<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.430> the<00:03:11.489> ECM<00:03:12.000> is<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:13.169> power<00:03:13.620> nope<00:03:14.370> bitch

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:14.579 
out of the ECM is that power nope bitch

00:03:14.579 --> 00:03:17.330 
out of the ECM is that power nope bitch
ground<00:03:14.939> provides<00:03:15.900> a<00:03:16.109> ground<00:03:16.500> or<00:03:16.889> the<00:03:17.010> relay

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:17.340 
ground provides a ground or the relay

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.509 
ground provides a ground or the relay
okay<00:03:18.000> so<00:03:18.269> the<00:03:18.419> relays<00:03:18.780> are<00:03:18.989> run<00:03:19.290> hot<00:03:19.889> and<00:03:20.220> then

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
okay so the relays are run hot and then

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:23.119 
okay so the relays are run hot and then
it<00:03:20.790> provides<00:03:21.329> a<00:03:21.510> ground<00:03:21.870> close<00:03:22.379> as<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.620> circuit

00:03:23.119 --> 00:03:23.129 
it provides a ground close as a circuit

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.710 
it provides a ground close as a circuit
and<00:03:23.190> sends<00:03:23.489> the<00:03:23.639> big<00:03:23.849> amperage<00:03:24.329> to<00:03:24.629> the

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:24.720 
and sends the big amperage to the

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:27.319 
and sends the big amperage to the
electric<00:03:25.109> fans<00:03:25.379> right<00:03:25.889> okay<00:03:26.519> we<00:03:26.939> like<00:03:27.090> to<00:03:27.209> make

00:03:27.319 --> 00:03:27.329 
electric fans right okay we like to make

00:03:27.329 --> 00:03:30.379
