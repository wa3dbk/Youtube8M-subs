cams are very hard to keep steady

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.869 
cams are very hard to keep steady
because<00:00:46.379> of<00:00:46.500> their<00:00:46.590> small<00:00:46.860> size<00:00:46.890> but<00:00:47.760> this

00:00:47.869 --> 00:00:47.879

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
really handy for protecting the

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.920 
really handy for protecting the
stabilizer<00:01:11.790> especially<00:01:12.270> when<00:01:12.659> you<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.840> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
stabilizer especially when you have it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.510 
stabilizer especially when you have it
in<00:01:13.020> your<00:01:13.110> backpack<00:01:13.590> so<00:01:13.619> it's<00:01:13.920> not<00:01:14.040> banging

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
in your backpack so it's not banging

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.810 
in your backpack so it's not banging
around<00:01:14.790> and<00:01:15.259> twisting<00:01:16.259> it<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.409> wrong<00:01:16.619> way

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
around and twisting it the wrong way

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.920 
around and twisting it the wrong way
anyways<00:01:17.820> it<00:01:18.000> comes<00:01:18.210> with<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.570> sets<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
anyways it comes with two sets of

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.420 
anyways it comes with two sets of
rechargeable<00:01:19.500> batteries<00:01:19.860> which<00:01:20.070> is<00:01:20.220> nice

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
rechargeable batteries which is nice

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:21.890 
rechargeable batteries which is nice
because<00:01:20.670> you<00:01:20.880> always<00:01:21.060> have<00:01:21.210> a<00:01:21.240> fresh<00:01:21.570> pair

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
because you always have a fresh pair

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
because you always have a fresh pair
ready<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.229> go<00:01:22.380> I'd<00:01:22.950> estimate<00:01:23.130> they<00:01:23.549> last<00:01:24.030> for

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
ready to go I'd estimate they last for

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.179 
ready to go I'd estimate they last for
about<00:01:24.420> two<00:01:24.750> hours<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:25.259> continuous<00:01:25.710> use<00:01:25.740> but

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
about two hours of continuous use but

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.770 
about two hours of continuous use but
much<00:01:26.430> longer<00:01:26.850> because<00:01:26.939> I<00:01:27.119> turn<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> off<00:01:27.540> and<00:01:27.689> on

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
much longer because I turn it off and on

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.690 
much longer because I turn it off and on
all<00:01:28.020> the<00:01:28.110> time<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.740> one<00:01:28.920> downside<00:01:29.400> is<00:01:29.549> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
all the time the one downside is that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.890 
all the time the one downside is that
you've<00:01:29.790> got<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.060> recharge<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> batteries

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
you've got to recharge the batteries

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.929 
you've got to recharge the batteries
outside<00:01:31.350> of<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.590> unit<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.070> it's<00:01:32.490> not<00:01:32.729> too<00:01:32.880> bad

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
outside of the unit but it's not too bad

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.370 
outside of the unit but it's not too bad
because<00:01:33.390> if<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.600> do<00:01:33.720> run<00:01:33.840> out<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.140> can<00:01:34.259> just

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
because if you do run out you can just

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.080 
because if you do run out you can just
pop<00:01:34.560> in<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:34.829> second<00:01:35.189> set<00:01:35.310> of<00:01:35.340> batteries<00:01:35.579> and

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
almost ready to go the camera doesn't

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.080 
almost ready to go the camera doesn't
need<00:02:18.740> to<00:02:18.860> be<00:02:18.950> perfectly<00:02:19.400> balanced<00:02:19.970> because

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
need to be perfectly balanced because

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.640 
need to be perfectly balanced because
the<00:02:20.390> motors<00:02:20.660> will<00:02:20.780> make<00:02:20.930> up<00:02:21.080> for<00:02:21.350> it<00:02:21.410> when<00:02:21.560> the

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
the motors will make up for it when the

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.710 
the motors will make up for it when the
power<00:02:21.830> is<00:02:21.950> turned<00:02:22.040> on<00:02:22.460> this<00:02:23.060> is<00:02:23.210> nice<00:02:23.390> because

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:23.720 
power is turned on this is nice because

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:24.760 
power is turned on this is nice because
then<00:02:23.930> it<00:02:24.050> can<00:02:24.110> take<00:02:24.260> several<00:02:24.590> different

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
then it can take several different

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.400 
then it can take several different
models<00:02:25.250> of<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.460> sony<00:02:25.670> action<00:02:25.910> cam<00:02:26.180> one<00:02:27.140> small

watch the live video off my Sony camera
I<00:03:19.730> don't<00:03:20.270> use<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.690> that<00:03:20.840> often<00:03:21.050> but<00:03:21.410> in<00:03:21.530> certain

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:21.830 
I don't use it that often but in certain

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:23.710 
I don't use it that often but in certain
situations<00:03:22.430> it<00:03:22.580> does<00:03:22.790> come<00:03:23.060> in<00:03:23.090> very<00:03:23.450> handy

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
situations it does come in very handy

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.390 
situations it does come in very handy
like<00:03:24.440> if<00:03:24.590> you<00:03:24.680> really<00:03:25.010> need<00:03:25.160> to<00:03:25.190> make<00:03:25.340> sure

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:25.400 
like if you really need to make sure

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.280 
like if you really need to make sure
you're<00:03:25.700> centered<00:03:26.030> on<00:03:26.239> your<00:03:26.480> subject<00:03:26.870> or<00:03:26.989> in

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:27.290 
you're centered on your subject or in

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:28.840 
you're centered on your subject or in
this<00:03:27.380> situation<00:03:27.530> where<00:03:27.950> I<00:03:27.980> want<00:03:28.430> to<00:03:28.520> have<00:03:28.640> two

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
this situation where I want to have two

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.780 
this situation where I want to have two
cameras<00:03:29.360> mounted<00:03:29.510> on<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.870> same<00:03:30.110> object<00:03:30.790> so

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
cameras mounted on the same object so

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.699 
cameras mounted on the same object so
here<00:03:32.120> I<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.300> it<00:03:32.540> set<00:03:32.720> up<00:03:32.750> so<00:03:32.870> that<00:03:33.230> I<00:03:33.260> can<00:03:33.470> see

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
here I have it set up so that I can see

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.470 
here I have it set up so that I can see
what<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> camera<00:03:34.160> sees<00:03:34.340> so<00:03:35.090> this<00:03:35.180> is<00:03:35.330> very

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
what the camera sees so this is very

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.820 
what the camera sees so this is very
nice<00:03:35.690> because<00:03:35.870> sometimes<00:03:35.989> you'll<00:03:36.380> shoot<00:03:36.739> a

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
nice because sometimes you'll shoot a

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:37.870 
nice because sometimes you'll shoot a
bunch<00:03:36.950> of<00:03:37.070> video<00:03:37.310> and<00:03:37.430> you'll<00:03:37.550> be<00:03:37.580> just

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:37.880 
bunch of video and you'll be just

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.550 
bunch of video and you'll be just
slightly<00:03:38.030> pointing<00:03:38.660> down<00:03:38.870> or<00:03:39.140> pointing<00:03:39.440> up

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
slightly pointing down or pointing up

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.500 
slightly pointing down or pointing up
the<00:03:39.590> whole<00:03:39.890> time<00:03:40.130> and<00:03:40.430> this<00:03:41.060> way<00:03:41.209> you<00:03:41.270> know

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the whole time and this way you know

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:42.850 
the whole time and this way you know
you're<00:03:41.720> right<00:03:41.989> on<00:03:42.170> so<00:03:42.410> you<00:03:42.500> could<00:03:42.620> at<00:03:42.709> least

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
you're right on so you could at least

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:44.860 
you're right on so you could at least
check<00:03:43.130> it<00:03:43.310> this<00:03:43.459> way<00:03:43.700> but<00:03:43.970> what<00:03:44.330> I'm<00:03:44.480> using<00:03:44.660> it

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
check it this way but what I'm using it

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.449 
check it this way but what I'm using it
for<00:03:44.900> is<00:03:45.410> I'll<00:03:45.590> show<00:03:45.770> you<00:03:45.830> in<00:03:45.950> a<00:03:45.980> minute<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:46.310> to

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
for is I'll show you in a minute just to

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.070 
for is I'll show you in a minute just to
do<00:03:46.580> comparisons<00:03:46.940> between<00:03:47.300> a<00:03:47.510> camera<00:03:47.870> with<00:03:47.959> no

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:48.080 
do comparisons between a camera with no

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.270 
do comparisons between a camera with no
stabilization<00:03:48.739> and<00:03:48.830> a<00:03:48.920> camera<00:03:49.160> with

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
stabilization and a camera with

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.020 
stabilization and a camera with
stabilization<00:03:51.220> okay<00:03:52.220> I'm<00:03:52.370> here<00:03:52.550> in<00:03:52.700> the<00:03:52.820> north

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
stabilization okay I'm here in the north

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.550 
stabilization okay I'm here in the north
end<00:03:53.239> of<00:03:53.300> Boise<00:03:53.660> and<00:03:53.690> I'm<00:03:53.840> here<00:03:53.959> to<00:03:54.050> test<00:03:54.350> out

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
end of Boise and I'm here to test out

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.400 
end of Boise and I'm here to test out
the<00:03:54.830> action<00:03:55.340> cam<00:03:55.580> with<00:03:55.910> this<00:03:56.060> gimbal<00:03:56.450> and<00:03:56.630> for

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:57.410 
the action cam with this gimbal and for

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:58.930 
the action cam with this gimbal and for
comparison<00:03:57.950> I've<00:03:58.070> hooked<00:03:58.190> it<00:03:58.370> up<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.520> my<00:03:58.700> cell

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:58.940 
comparison I've hooked it up to my cell

00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:00.850 
comparison I've hooked it up to my cell
phone<00:03:59.360> which<00:03:59.510> is<00:03:59.630> on<00:03:59.780> the<00:03:59.930> base<00:04:00.170> of<00:04:00.440> the<00:04:00.530> gimbal

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:00.860 
phone which is on the base of the gimbal

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:02.860 
phone which is on the base of the gimbal
so<00:04:01.250> I'm<00:04:01.340> going<00:04:01.459> to<00:04:01.489> record<00:04:01.910> video<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.450> both<00:04:02.660> of

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:02.870 
so I'm going to record video on both of

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.229 
so I'm going to record video on both of
these<00:04:02.989> and<00:04:03.260> then<00:04:03.860> we'll<00:04:04.100> compare<00:04:04.790> them<00:04:05.000> I'll

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:05.239 
these and then we'll compare them I'll

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.460 
these and then we'll compare them I'll
show<00:04:05.270> you<00:04:05.480> the<00:04:05.630> video<00:04:05.720> and<00:04:06.020> we'll<00:04:06.110> compare

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
show you the video and we'll compare

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.660 
show you the video and we'll compare
them<00:04:06.560> and<00:04:06.680> see<00:04:06.770> which<00:04:06.860> one's<00:04:07.070> more<00:04:07.190> stable<00:04:07.550> now

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
them and see which one's more stable now

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:10.120 
them and see which one's more stable now
the<00:04:08.000> phone<00:04:08.450> actually<00:04:09.110> this<00:04:09.320> is<00:04:09.440> a<00:04:09.470> galaxy<00:04:09.709> s6

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130 
the phone actually this is a galaxy s6

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:11.830 
the phone actually this is a galaxy s6
it<00:04:10.340> actually<00:04:10.760> has<00:04:10.940> electronic<00:04:11.600> image

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:11.840 
it actually has electronic image

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.259 
it actually has electronic image
stabilization<00:04:12.230> for<00:04:12.680> the<00:04:12.739> video<00:04:12.920> and<00:04:13.220> the<00:04:13.670> Sony

00:04:14.259 --> 00:04:14.269 
stabilization for the video and the Sony

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:16.030 
stabilization for the video and the Sony
camera<00:04:14.720> also<00:04:14.959> has<00:04:15.110> electronic<00:04:15.680> image

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.040 
camera also has electronic image

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.860 
camera also has electronic image
stabilization<00:04:16.370> so<00:04:16.850> since<00:04:17.450> they<00:04:17.540> both<00:04:17.660> have

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:17.870 
stabilization so since they both have

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.509 
stabilization so since they both have
the<00:04:18.049> image<00:04:18.470> stabilization<00:04:18.769> I<00:04:19.190> think<00:04:19.400> the

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:19.519 
the image stabilization I think the

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:21.279 
the image stabilization I think the
gimbal<00:04:19.910> will<00:04:20.570> be<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.840> difference<00:04:21.229> between

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:21.289 
gimbal will be the difference between

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:23.080 
gimbal will be the difference between
the<00:04:21.650> two<00:04:21.830> and<00:04:22.039> it'll<00:04:22.220> make<00:04:22.340> a<00:04:22.370> good<00:04:22.700> comparison

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.090 
the two and it'll make a good comparison

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:24.290 
the two and it'll make a good comparison
video

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
video

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.000 
video
this<00:04:25.300> stabilizer<00:04:25.840> works<00:04:26.140> great<00:04:26.500> for<00:04:26.530> lots<00:04:26.890> of

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
this stabilizer works great for lots of

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.010 
this stabilizer works great for lots of
different<00:04:27.070> shots<00:04:27.550> too<00:04:27.970> for<00:04:28.660> this<00:04:28.750> movement

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
different shots too for this movement

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
different shots too for this movement
you'd<00:04:29.320> normally<00:04:29.500> need<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:29.890> jib<00:04:30.310> to<00:04:30.340> move<00:04:30.670> the

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
you'd normally need a jib to move the

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:32.610 
you'd normally need a jib to move the
camera<00:04:31.150> up<00:04:31.180> and<00:04:31.330> down<00:04:31.420> but<00:04:32.110> instead<00:04:32.230> all<00:04:32.500> you

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
camera up and down but instead all you

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.050 
camera up and down but instead all you
need<00:04:32.740> to<00:04:32.830> do<00:04:32.950> is<00:04:33.070> hold<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.340> stabilizer<00:04:33.790> by<00:04:34.000> the

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:34.060 
need to do is hold the stabilizer by the

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.820 
need to do is hold the stabilizer by the
ground<00:04:34.330> and<00:04:34.600> then<00:04:34.720> reach<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.200> slowly<00:04:35.470> up<00:04:35.620> in

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
ground and then reach it slowly up in

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.260 
ground and then reach it slowly up in
the<00:04:35.920> air<00:04:36.040> as<00:04:36.160> high<00:04:36.460> as<00:04:36.520> your<00:04:36.790> arm<00:04:36.940> can<00:04:37.090> reach

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
the air as high as your arm can reach

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.570 
the air as high as your arm can reach
and<00:04:37.630> since<00:04:38.350> the<00:04:38.470> stabilizer<00:04:38.920> is<00:04:39.100> so<00:04:39.280> light

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
and since the stabilizer is so light

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:41.400 
and since the stabilizer is so light
it's<00:04:40.090> easy<00:04:40.300> to<00:04:40.480> hold<00:04:40.660> it<00:04:40.780> high<00:04:40.930> in<00:04:41.080> there<00:04:41.230> as

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
it's easy to hold it high in there as

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.710 
it's easy to hold it high in there as
long<00:04:41.650> as<00:04:41.830> you<00:04:41.920> need<00:04:42.040> to<00:04:42.280> probably<00:04:43.270> one<00:04:43.540> of<00:04:43.570> the

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:43.720 
long as you need to probably one of the

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.050 
long as you need to probably one of the
very<00:04:43.750> best<00:04:44.140> uses<00:04:44.620> of<00:04:44.740> this<00:04:44.890> stabilizer<00:04:45.430> is<00:04:45.790> the

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:46.060 
very best uses of this stabilizer is the

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:48.270 
very best uses of this stabilizer is the
ability<00:04:46.210> to<00:04:46.390> walk<00:04:46.690> and<00:04:46.750> shoot<00:04:47.170> video<00:04:47.500> and<00:04:47.770> have

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
ability to walk and shoot video and have

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.210 
ability to walk and shoot video and have
it<00:04:48.400> be<00:04:48.520> very<00:04:48.550> easy<00:04:49.120> to<00:04:49.240> watch<00:04:49.510> if<00:04:50.040> you're<00:04:51.040> going

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
it be very easy to watch if you're going

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:52.950 
it be very easy to watch if you're going
down<00:04:51.460> a<00:04:51.490> straight<00:04:51.850> path<00:04:52.090> you<00:04:52.330> can<00:04:52.480> even<00:04:52.630> lock

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:52.960 
down a straight path you can even lock

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.870 
down a straight path you can even lock
it<00:04:53.230> in<00:04:53.380> one<00:04:53.620> direction<00:04:53.800> and<00:04:54.250> make<00:04:54.370> really<00:04:54.580> cool

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
it in one direction and make really cool

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.420 
it in one direction and make really cool
time<00:04:55.120> lapses<00:04:55.600> of<00:04:55.630> your<00:04:55.960> path<00:04:56.290> another<00:04:57.160> cool

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:57.430 
time lapses of your path another cool

00:04:57.430 --> 00:04:59.580 
time lapses of your path another cool
effect<00:04:57.700> you<00:04:57.820> can<00:04:58.030> do<00:04:58.180> is<00:04:58.420> lock<00:04:58.810> the<00:04:59.050> stabilizer

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
effect you can do is lock the stabilizer

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.680 
effect you can do is lock the stabilizer
in<00:04:59.860> position<00:05:00.310> and<00:05:00.460> then<00:05:00.550> walk<00:05:00.850> backwards<00:05:01.480> with

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:01.690 
in position and then walk backwards with

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.210 
in position and then walk backwards with
the<00:05:01.780> camera<00:05:02.080> behind<00:05:02.380> you<00:05:02.620> and<00:05:02.800> get<00:05:02.950> a<00:05:03.010> nice

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
the camera behind you and get a nice

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:05.210 
the camera behind you and get a nice
effect<00:05:03.400> like<00:05:03.820> this<00:05:04.030> one<00:05:04.210> right<00:05:04.390> here<00:05:04.450> and

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:05.220 
effect like this one right here and

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.320 
effect like this one right here and
finally<00:05:06.220> I<00:05:06.370> wanted<00:05:06.610> to<00:05:06.700> show<00:05:06.850> you<00:05:06.880> just<00:05:07.210> how

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
finally I wanted to show you just how

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:09.480 
finally I wanted to show you just how
awesome<00:05:07.840> the<00:05:07.960> stabilizer<00:05:08.440> works<00:05:08.800> so<00:05:09.400> I'm

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
awesome the stabilizer works so I'm

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.010 
awesome the stabilizer works so I'm
running<00:05:09.610> full<00:05:10.000> speed<00:05:10.330> and<00:05:10.570> carrying<00:05:10.960> the

00:05:11.010 --> 00:05:11.020 
running full speed and carrying the

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.900 
running full speed and carrying the
stabilizer<00:05:11.440> and<00:05:11.560> camera<00:05:12.100> and<00:05:12.280> you<00:05:12.640> can<00:05:12.760> see

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:12.910 
stabilizer and camera and you can see

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:14.670 
stabilizer and camera and you can see
that<00:05:13.030> the<00:05:13.150> footage<00:05:13.390> is<00:05:13.600> still<00:05:13.960> very<00:05:14.230> smooth

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
that the footage is still very smooth

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.830 
that the footage is still very smooth
and<00:05:14.890> usable<00:05:15.340> so<00:05:16.090> this<00:05:16.240> would<00:05:16.390> be<00:05:16.450> great<00:05:16.690> to

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:16.840 
and usable so this would be great to

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.750 
and usable so this would be great to
film<00:05:17.110> from<00:05:17.320> within<00:05:17.590> a<00:05:17.830> race<00:05:18.040> or<00:05:18.340> even<00:05:18.670> a

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:18.760 
film from within a race or even a

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.740 
film from within a race or even a
sporting<00:05:19.150> event<00:05:19.360> where<00:05:19.420> you're<00:05:19.600> running

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:19.750 
sporting event where you're running

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:22.350 
sporting event where you're running
amongst<00:05:20.290> the<00:05:20.380> players<00:05:20.820> anyway<00:05:21.820> I<00:05:21.940> think<00:05:22.060> these

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:22.360 
amongst the players anyway I think these

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.880 
amongst the players anyway I think these
stabilizers<00:05:22.780> are<00:05:23.050> going<00:05:23.170> to<00:05:23.230> be<00:05:23.350> very<00:05:23.620> popular

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:23.890 
stabilizers are going to be very popular

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.740 
stabilizers are going to be very popular
in<00:05:24.160> the<00:05:24.340> future<00:05:24.490> because<00:05:24.940> they're<00:05:25.090> so<00:05:25.330> easy<00:05:25.630> to

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
in the future because they're so easy to

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.660 
in the future because they're so easy to
use<00:05:26.020> I<00:05:26.260> mean<00:05:26.620> you've<00:05:26.770> got<00:05:26.950> a<00:05:26.980> handle<00:05:27.460> to<00:05:27.550> hold

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:27.670 
use I mean you've got a handle to hold

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:29.220 
use I mean you've got a handle to hold
your<00:05:27.880> camera<00:05:28.060> and<00:05:28.420> it<00:05:28.600> keeps<00:05:28.750> it<00:05:28.900> steady<00:05:29.080> for

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:29.230 
your camera and it keeps it steady for

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:31.860 
your camera and it keeps it steady for
you<00:05:29.560> I'll<00:05:29.710> add<00:05:30.370> a<00:05:30.400> link<00:05:30.760> to<00:05:30.850> the<00:05:31.060> stabilizer<00:05:31.540> my
