00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.660 
fairly cut my finger in there I had my
tail<00:02:45.850> light<00:02:46.090> up<00:02:46.750> on<00:02:46.989> top<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.230> here<00:02:47.500> but<00:02:47.769> when<00:02:48.640> I

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
tail light up on top of here but when I

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.720 
tail light up on top of here but when I
bent<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.060> bracket<00:02:49.600> it<00:02:50.290> kind<00:02:50.650> of<00:02:50.799> cracked<00:02:51.370> and

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
bent the bracket it kind of cracked and

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.550 
bent the bracket it kind of cracked and
I<00:02:52.000> guess<00:02:52.360> while<00:02:52.540> I<00:02:52.570> was<00:02:52.720> riding<00:02:52.989> it<00:02:53.079> completely

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:53.560 
I guess while I was riding it completely

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:58.830 
I guess while I was riding it completely
broke<00:02:55.799> but<00:02:56.799> uh<00:02:56.829> I<00:02:57.250> guess<00:02:58.209> the<00:02:58.390> holes<00:02:58.630> that<00:02:58.780> I

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
broke but uh I guess the holes that I

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:04.140 
broke but uh I guess the holes that I
had<00:02:59.280> drilled<00:03:00.280> I<00:03:00.579> used<00:03:01.060> those<00:03:01.299> to<00:03:02.200> mount<00:03:03.150> Mitel

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
had drilled I used those to mount Mitel

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.860 
had drilled I used those to mount Mitel
light<00:03:04.299> which<00:03:04.510> actually<00:03:05.320> looks<00:03:05.470> pretty<00:03:05.680> good

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
light which actually looks pretty good

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.050 
light which actually looks pretty good
as<00:03:07.870> you<00:03:07.930> can<00:03:08.170> see<00:03:08.380> I<00:03:08.410> mean

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
as you can see I mean

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:13.830 
as you can see I mean
not<00:03:11.050> too<00:03:11.260> far<00:03:11.530> out<00:03:11.560> there<00:03:11.980> I<00:03:12.540> actually<00:03:13.540> like

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
not too far out there I actually like

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.060 
not too far out there I actually like
the<00:03:13.960> way<00:03:14.080> it<00:03:14.200> looks<00:03:14.410> so<00:03:14.650> I<00:03:16.590> guess<00:03:17.590> if<00:03:17.770> you<00:03:17.860> run

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
the way it looks so I guess if you run

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:19.650 
the way it looks so I guess if you run
turn<00:03:18.520> signals<00:03:18.940> you<00:03:19.030> could<00:03:19.180> probably<00:03:19.330> do<00:03:19.540> the

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 
turn signals you could probably do the

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.940 
turn signals you could probably do the
same<00:03:19.690> put<00:03:20.530> one<00:03:20.710> you<00:03:20.980> know<00:03:21.970> on<00:03:22.120> top<00:03:22.360> one<00:03:22.770> and<00:03:23.770> it

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:23.950 
same put one you know on top one and it

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.820 
same put one you know on top one and it
look<00:03:24.100> pretty<00:03:24.280> good<00:03:24.490> I<00:03:25.200> guess<00:03:26.200> that's

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:26.830 
look pretty good I guess that's

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:28.560 
look pretty good I guess that's
everything<00:03:26.980> I've<00:03:27.340> done<00:03:27.520> to<00:03:27.700> it<00:03:27.730> have<00:03:28.330> you<00:03:28.360> got

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:28.570 
everything I've done to it have you got

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:31.170 
everything I've done to it have you got
any<00:03:28.750> questions<00:03:29.170> hit<00:03:29.350> me<00:03:29.410> up<00:03:29.880> right<00:03:30.880> now<00:03:31.060> I'm

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
any questions hit me up right now I'm

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.380 
any questions hit me up right now I'm
looking<00:03:31.480> for<00:03:31.540> some<00:03:31.750> tea<00:03:31.930> bars<00:03:33.209> haven't<00:03:34.209> found

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
looking for some tea bars haven't found

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:36.750 
looking for some tea bars haven't found
the<00:03:34.450> right<00:03:34.510> ones<00:03:34.870> maybe<00:03:35.290> some<00:03:35.680> four-inch<00:03:36.520> tea

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
the right ones maybe some four-inch tea

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:42.240 
the right ones maybe some four-inch tea
bars<00:03:37.920> and<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.760> think<00:03:40.330> that'll<00:03:40.600> be<00:03:40.630> it<00:03:40.930> for<00:03:41.890> a

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
bars and I think that'll be it for a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:47.489 
bars and I think that'll be it for a
while<00:03:42.340> I<00:03:43.230> guess<00:03:44.230> hit<00:03:44.590> me<00:03:44.709> up<00:03:44.830> some<00:03:45.010> comments
