00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.380
 concerned about the future of sport in the

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.840

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.710
 I wanted to have one or two or three 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:30.980
 big companies that would play me and 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.989
 I was serving the market by making 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.190
 the activations of their events do not 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.660
 best possible way 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.520
 tt too much sponsorship is also 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.010
 complicated and ends up getting enough 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.989
 training and mail to a proposal 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.640
 millionaire from Corinthians who wanted to use 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:46.800
 I like advertisement boy 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.780
 a month later the club announced the 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.059
 hiring of thiago pereira 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.730
 He is a player who is doing there. 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.030
 Olympic final since 2004 final and 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.090
 world monitors who then roy his 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.770
 Yes, you have luggage and knowledge. 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.190
 to know what is good for him that is not 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.899
 good 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.150
 thiago will not be able to swim through 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.430
 corinthians on the maria lenk trophy but 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:11.040
 he 's just a few hours away from the long-awaited 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.970
 debut by Flemish in territory 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.860
 national 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
 the last time you swam in Brazil in the 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.369
 last year 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.420
 cession broke the world record of 50 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.640
 meters free 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.979
 This time it will not happen for 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.930
 three reasons in the first place is just the 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.450
 beginning of the season the beginning of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.939
 preparation of the athlete after swimming 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.020
 is adapting to the end of the costumes 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.960
 technological 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.869
 those supermasses and finally cease heaven 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:38.520
 criticized the pool in which he is going to swim in the 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.270
 trophy maria lenk this year the people 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:45.149
 really did not like swimming 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.820
 but to do what he can not swim 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.860
 a year ago after two years of 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.720
 glory there we really need 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.939
 change our policy a little 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.829
 while politics does not change heaven cease 

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:59.060
 takes care of changing the history of swimming 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.409
 one more time swimming without the supermaids 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.469
 believes that it will be faster than 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.960
 the last supercars who swam only 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:10.259
 with the traditional Dutch champion swimwear 

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.760
 peter morgan band and the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.610
 last world record holder 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.920
 alexander popov 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
 we have been doing so far 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 bigger is not making so much difference 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.610
 logical that one detail or another to 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.590
 We end up feeling but basically the 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.050
 I think it will be possible to sign 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.720
 below plan popov nÃ© systems 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:33.050
 without reason has a peculiar way of dealing 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:35.900
 with the pressure never called her you 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.430
 will manage all this this week I 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:40.240
 I 'm going to win I 'm going to win everything I 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.070
 to send is basically this 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:45.320
 confident the sportv2 transmits the trophy 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.860
