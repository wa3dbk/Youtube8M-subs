00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
people talk in English so I was thinking

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:26.039 
people talk in English so I was thinking
that<00:01:23.729> it<00:01:24.729> would<00:01:24.850> be<00:01:24.909> a<00:01:25.030> slight<00:01:25.240> problem<00:01:25.270> but

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
that it would be a slight problem but

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.530 
that it would be a slight problem but
then<00:01:26.280> most<00:01:27.280> of<00:01:27.400> the<00:01:27.490> people<00:01:27.520> they<00:01:28.030> spoke

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
then most of the people they spoke

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:33.530 
then most of the people they spoke
really<00:01:28.990> good<00:01:29.260> English<00:01:29.560> and<00:01:29.590> they<00:01:29.890> often<00:01:31.049> they

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
really good English and they often they

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.620 
really good English and they often they
reply<00:01:34.540> you<00:01:34.600> back<00:01:34.900> in<00:01:35.080> English<00:01:35.320> also<00:01:35.500> and<00:01:36.630> the

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:50.410 
everything so one of the professor she

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.380 
everything so one of the professor she
replied<00:02:50.739> that<00:02:51.010> I'm<00:02:52.019> like<00:02:53.019> a<00:02:53.050> very<00:02:53.800> traditional

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
replied that I'm like a very traditional

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.680 
replied that I'm like a very traditional
Swedish<00:02:55.390> so<00:02:55.870> I<00:02:55.900> I<00:02:56.290> don't<00:02:56.410> like<00:02:56.849> you<00:02:57.849> call<00:02:58.180> me<00:02:58.420> as

Swedish so I I don't like you call me as
a<00:02:59.160> respected<00:03:00.160> professor<00:03:00.549> you<00:03:00.910> should<00:03:01.090> just

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
a respected professor you should just

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.809 
a respected professor you should just
call<00:03:02.019> me<00:03:02.140> by<00:03:02.290> my<00:03:02.440> name<00:03:02.799> and<00:03:03.220> you<00:03:03.310> can<00:03:03.340> just<00:03:03.670> say

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
dear and you can put my name there but

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.620 
dear and you can put my name there but
then<00:03:06.549> the<00:03:06.700> difference<00:03:07.090> is<00:03:07.180> that<00:03:07.239> we<00:03:07.600> have

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
then the difference is that we have

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.059 
then the difference is that we have
classes<00:03:08.170> along<00:03:08.380> with<00:03:08.440> the<00:03:08.680> Batchelor

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
classes along with the Batchelor

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.640 
classes along with the Batchelor
students<00:03:09.459> and<00:03:09.580> also<00:03:09.670> PhD<00:03:10.150> students<00:03:10.480> so<00:03:11.290> it's<00:03:11.530> a

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
students and also PhD students so it's a

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.940 
students and also PhD students so it's a
nice<00:03:11.799> mix<00:03:11.860> so<00:03:12.730> if<00:03:13.060> we<00:03:13.269> have<00:03:13.540> it's<00:03:14.319> nice<00:03:14.680> to

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
nice mix so if we have it's nice to

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.100 
nice mix so if we have it's nice to
study<00:03:15.700> with<00:03:15.970> people<00:03:16.330> from<00:03:16.480> all<00:03:16.720> different

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
study with people from all different

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:19.470 
study with people from all different
backgrounds<00:03:17.709> and<00:03:18.160> learning<00:03:18.910> the<00:03:19.000> same<00:03:19.180> course

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
backgrounds and learning the same course

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:22.100 
backgrounds and learning the same course
so<00:03:20.319> that<00:03:20.769> thing<00:03:20.980> is<00:03:21.040> not<00:03:21.280> common<00:03:21.610> in<00:03:21.670> India

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
so that thing is not common in India

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.800 
so that thing is not common in India
yeah<00:03:23.110> I<00:03:23.709> mean<00:03:24.130> the<00:03:24.489> lads<00:03:24.700> here<00:03:24.970> are<00:03:25.209> really

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810 
yeah I mean the lads here are really

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.530 
yeah I mean the lads here are really
quick<00:03:26.080> they<00:03:26.349> have<00:03:27.299> everything<00:03:28.299> which<00:03:28.510> is

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
quick they have everything which is

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.099 
quick they have everything which is
required<00:03:29.349> like<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:30.700> perform<00:03:30.910> experiment<00:03:31.870> like

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:32.109 
required like to perform experiment like

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:38.640 
required like to perform experiment like
and<00:03:35.700> the<00:03:36.700> teachers<00:03:37.090> they<00:03:37.239> made<00:03:37.390> us<00:03:37.540> make<00:03:38.049> us<00:03:38.230> do

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
and the teachers they made us make us do

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:41.400 
and the teachers they made us make us do
the<00:03:38.890> experiment<00:03:39.640> by<00:03:39.790> ourselves<00:03:40.060> like<00:03:40.780> they

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
the experiment by ourselves like they

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.170 
the experiment by ourselves like they
can<00:03:41.590> guide<00:03:41.799> they<00:03:42.130> give<00:03:42.310> us<00:03:42.400> the<00:03:42.549> protocol<00:03:42.880> and

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:43.180 
can guide they give us the protocol and

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:45.840 
can guide they give us the protocol and
they<00:03:43.329> can<00:03:43.480> guide<00:03:43.690> us<00:03:43.959> so<00:03:44.500> it's<00:03:44.950> like<00:03:45.220> we

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
they can guide us so it's like we

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.520 
they can guide us so it's like we
learned<00:03:46.090> from<00:03:46.329> that<00:03:46.390> a<00:03:46.569> lot<00:03:46.959> because<00:03:47.109> we<00:03:47.410> have

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
learned from that a lot because we have

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.890 
learned from that a lot because we have
to<00:03:47.680> put<00:03:47.859> our<00:03:48.069> brains<00:03:48.459> in<00:03:48.670> that<00:03:48.910> and<00:03:49.420> we<00:03:49.660> are<00:03:49.750> to

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
to put our brains in that and we are to

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.960 
to put our brains in that and we are to
plan<00:03:50.230> we<00:03:50.650> have<00:03:50.739> to<00:03:50.859> do<00:03:51.010> everything<00:03:51.579> according

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
plan we have to do everything according

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.050 
plan we have to do everything according
to<00:03:52.420> ISIL<00:03:53.489> Salah<00:03:54.489> university<00:03:55.209> itself<00:03:55.989> has<00:03:56.290> its
