been working on is display technology

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.639 
been working on is display technology
and<00:00:32.270> what<00:00:32.450> they've<00:00:32.599> actually<00:00:32.840> done<00:00:33.050> this<00:00:33.440> time

00:00:33.639 --> 00:00:33.649 
and what they've actually done this time

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:36.010 
and what they've actually done this time
around<00:00:33.800> is<00:00:34.190> instead<00:00:34.880> of<00:00:34.940> using<00:00:35.180> to<00:00:35.540> brightness

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020

enhancing films they've reduced it down
to<00:00:38.059> one<00:00:38.359> and<00:00:38.660> what<00:00:39.199> that<00:00:39.230> does<00:00:39.500> it

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:39.739 
to one and what that does it

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:42.099 
to one and what that does it
significantly<00:00:40.730> or<00:00:41.210> not<00:00:41.510> significantly<00:00:41.989> it

significantly or not significantly it

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:45.819 
significantly or not significantly it
just<00:00:42.469> reduces<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.640> thickness<00:00:44.500> or<00:00:45.500> the

00:00:45.819 --> 00:00:45.829 
just reduces the thickness or the

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:47.950 
just reduces the thickness or the
heaviness<00:00:46.309> of<00:00:46.429> the<00:00:46.730> display<00:00:47.449> so<00:00:47.510> now<00:00:47.840> the

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
heaviness of the display so now the

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.299 
heaviness of the display so now the
display<00:00:48.410> is<00:00:48.530> going<00:00:48.649> to<00:00:48.710> be<00:00:48.769> thinner<00:00:49.010> which

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
display is going to be thinner which

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:50.950 
display is going to be thinner which
means<00:00:49.609> in<00:00:49.820> tower<00:00:50.059> over<00:00:50.359> all<00:00:50.480> smartphones

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:50.960 
means in tower over all smartphones

going<00:00:51.170> to<00:00:51.230> be<00:00:51.289> thinner<00:00:51.500> another<00:00:52.280> very

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
going to be thinner another very

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.400 
going to be thinner another very
exciting<00:00:52.940> feature<00:00:53.149> is<00:00:53.449> that<00:00:53.480> it's<00:00:53.929> going<00:00:54.170> to

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:54.410 
exciting feature is that it's going to

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.889 
exciting feature is that it's going to
be<00:00:54.559> a<00:00:54.589> curved<00:00:55.219> display<00:00:55.789> so<00:00:56.390> you<00:00:56.449> can<00:00:56.719> if<00:00:56.809> you

00:00:56.889 --> 00:00:56.899 
be a curved display so you can if you

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:58.540 
be a curved display so you can if you
look<00:00:57.050> carefully<00:00:57.199> from<00:00:57.739> the<00:00:57.859> images<00:00:58.249> you<00:00:58.399> see

00:00:58.540 --> 00:00:58.550 
look carefully from the images you see

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:01.360 
look carefully from the images you see
how<00:00:58.609> the<00:00:58.670> edges<00:00:59.269> are<00:00:59.890> curved<00:01:00.890> and<00:01:01.100> you<00:01:01.219> can

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:01.370 
how the edges are curved and you can

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:02.979 
how the edges are curved and you can
definitely<00:01:01.670> see<00:01:01.789> this<00:01:01.999> even<00:01:02.300> the<00:01:02.390> corner<00:01:02.780> so

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
definitely see this even the corner so

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.329 
definitely see this even the corner so
it<00:01:03.109> goes<00:01:03.260> through<00:01:03.559> the<00:01:03.679> corners<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:04.280> the

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
it goes through the corners and the

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.120 
it goes through the corners and the
edges<00:01:04.430> of<00:01:04.760> the<00:01:04.940> display<00:01:05.390> are<00:01:06.350> curved<00:01:06.740> you<00:01:06.920> see

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:07.130 
edges of the display are curved you see

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.430 
edges of the display are curved you see
the<00:01:07.460> feed<00:01:07.760> that<00:01:07.940> feature<00:01:08.210> on<00:01:08.630> the<00:01:09.140> design

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
the feed that feature on the design

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.960 
the feed that feature on the design
feature<00:01:09.650> on<00:01:09.830> the<00:01:09.980> white<00:01:10.220> along<00:01:10.670> with<00:01:10.880> the

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
inch panel as well just because they

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.840 
inch panel as well just because they
want<00:01:18.530> to<00:01:18.620> keep<00:01:18.740> a<00:01:18.890> similar<00:01:19.250> design<00:01:19.490> language

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:19.850 
want to keep a similar design language

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:21.700 
want to keep a similar design language
but<00:01:20.630> they<00:01:20.750> read<00:01:21.110> they're<00:01:21.320> just<00:01:21.530> going<00:01:21.650> to

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
but they read they're just going to

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:23.290 
but they read they're just going to
change<00:01:22.040> the<00:01:22.460> internal<00:01:22.970> specifications

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:23.300 
change the internal specifications

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.560 
change the internal specifications
between<00:01:24.200> the<00:01:24.350> two<00:01:24.500> devices<00:01:24.650> and<00:01:25.280> a<00:01:26.060> lot<00:01:26.330> of<00:01:26.360> the

noticeable and now that we're finally
getting<00:01:33.230> a<00:01:33.290> chance<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.650> see<00:01:33.800> the<00:01:34.040> display

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:34.550 
getting a chance to see the display

getting a chance to see the display
panel<00:01:34.580> itself<00:01:35.350> we<00:01:36.350> actually<00:01:36.740> get<00:01:36.860> to<00:01:36.890> see<00:01:37.160> the

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
panel itself we actually get to see the

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.730 
panel itself we actually get to see the
details<00:01:37.760> on<00:01:38.450> how<00:01:38.720> that<00:01:38.780> curved<00:01:39.230> display<00:01:39.620> is

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:39.740 
details on how that curved display is

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.110 
details on how that curved display is
going<00:01:39.860> to<00:01:39.920> look<00:01:40.100> and<00:01:40.340> of<00:01:40.610> course<00:01:40.820> this<00:01:40.970> is<00:01:41.090> a

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
going to look and of course this is a

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.530 
going to look and of course this is a
sharp<00:01:41.570> turnaround<00:01:42.050> from<00:01:42.490> the<00:01:43.490> iphone<00:01:43.850> 5s<00:01:44.300> and

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
sharp turnaround from the iphone 5s and
