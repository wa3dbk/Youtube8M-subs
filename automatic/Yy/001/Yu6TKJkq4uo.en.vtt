00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
junior that's the sort really like stood

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560 
junior that's the sort really like stood
out<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.890> me<00:01:52.950> being<00:01:53.850> tough<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.210> play<00:01:54.329> against

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
it on the board down low and I guess I

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.370 
it on the board down low and I guess I
just<00:01:56.820> kept<00:01:57.180> working<00:01:57.329> at<00:01:57.630> it<00:01:57.659> and<00:01:57.960> getting
