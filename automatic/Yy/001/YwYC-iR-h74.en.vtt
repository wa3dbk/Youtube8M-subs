00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
the best I couldn't really possibly tell

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.270 
the best I couldn't really possibly tell
you<00:03:56.750> because<00:03:57.050> I<00:03:57.260> haven't<00:03:57.440> unlocked<00:03:57.800> all<00:03:58.070> of

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
you because I haven't unlocked all of

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.940 
you because I haven't unlocked all of
them<00:03:58.460> just<00:03:58.760> yet<00:03:59.030> but<00:03:59.240> two<00:03:59.360> qbs<00:03:59.840> is<00:04:00.170> is<00:04:00.500> a<00:04:00.530> beast

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
them just yet but two qbs is is a beast

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.890 
them just yet but two qbs is is a beast
up<00:04:01.250> close<00:04:01.550> and<00:04:01.910> because<00:04:02.360> you<00:04:02.450> have<00:04:02.540> that<00:04:02.690> fast

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
up close and because you have that fast

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:05.440 
up close and because you have that fast
fire<00:04:03.140> rate<00:04:03.460> but<00:04:04.460> I<00:04:04.520> have<00:04:04.820> begun<00:04:05.120> to<00:04:05.300> really

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:05.450 
fire rate but I have begun to really

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:08.530 
fire rate but I have begun to really
like<00:04:05.750> the<00:04:05.900> 870<00:04:06.470> as<00:04:06.560> well<00:04:06.830> because<00:04:07.340> it's<00:04:07.910> the

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:08.540 
like the 870 as well because it's the

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.740 
like the 870 as well because it's the
870<00:04:09.140> and<00:04:09.230> it's<00:04:09.350> a<00:04:09.500> damn<00:04:09.770> sexy<00:04:10.280> shotgun<00:04:10.790> but<00:04:11.630> it

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:11.750 
870 and it's a damn sexy shotgun but it

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:13.240 
870 and it's a damn sexy shotgun but it
also<00:04:11.900> performs<00:04:12.290> really<00:04:12.500> well<00:04:12.650> although<00:04:13.040> I

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
also performs really well although I

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.700 
also performs really well although I
would<00:04:13.610> still<00:04:13.880> suggest<00:04:14.060> the<00:04:14.420> qbs<00:04:14.900> for<00:04:15.530> real

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:15.710 
would still suggest the qbs for real

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:17.470 
would still suggest the qbs for real
close<00:04:16.040> quarter<00:04:16.400> situations<00:04:17.030> because<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.390> the

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
close quarter situations because of the

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.960 
close quarter situations because of the
fire<00:04:17.690> rate<00:04:17.930> but<00:04:18.440> the<00:04:18.530> 870<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.340> more<00:04:19.520> effective

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
fire rate but the 870 is more effective

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:21.580 
fire rate but the 870 is more effective
at<00:04:20.090> range<00:04:20.420> i<00:04:20.660> believe<00:04:20.960> so<00:04:21.109> it<00:04:21.200> all<00:04:21.290> comes<00:04:21.470> down

00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:21.590 
at range i believe so it all comes down

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.130 
at range i believe so it all comes down
to<00:04:21.739> personal<00:04:22.160> preference<00:04:22.730> as<00:04:23.330> far<00:04:23.960> as

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:24.140 
to personal preference as far as

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:26.110 
to personal preference as far as
attachments<00:04:24.950> go<00:04:25.070> on<00:04:25.280> this<00:04:25.490> weapon<00:04:25.670> I<00:04:25.820> usually

00:04:26.110 --> 00:04:26.120 
attachments go on this weapon I usually

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.820 
attachments go on this weapon I usually
go<00:04:26.240> with<00:04:26.270> the<00:04:26.480> laser<00:04:26.720> sights<00:04:27.140> and<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:27.470> full

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
go with the laser sights and the full

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.830 
go with the laser sights and the full
choke<00:04:28.220> now<00:04:28.700> I<00:04:28.730> haven't<00:04:28.970> really<00:04:29.330> taken<00:04:29.480> a<00:04:29.690> good

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
choke now I haven't really taken a good

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.290 
choke now I haven't really taken a good
in-depth<00:04:30.440> look<00:04:30.650> at<00:04:31.100> all<00:04:31.310> of<00:04:31.340> the<00:04:31.580> shotguns<00:04:32.090> and

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
in-depth look at all of the shotguns and

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.060 
in-depth look at all of the shotguns and
their<00:04:32.510> attachments<00:04:33.140> but<00:04:33.230> I<00:04:33.260> definitely<00:04:33.440> will

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:34.070 
their attachments but I definitely will

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.740 
their attachments but I definitely will
