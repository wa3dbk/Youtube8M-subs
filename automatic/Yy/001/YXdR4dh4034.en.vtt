 enrico meanwhile I wanted to tell you immediately that 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.369
 here there was a bit of tension towards the 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.470
 end of the match in the stands 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.779
 meanwhile we know that this was considered 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.160
 a match at risk 13 years face 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.740
 the last one was always there 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.170
 big rivalry numberone naples tonight 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.730
 two Austrians were attacked with 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.710
 the jersey of naples here in verona e 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.149
 during the last few minutes of the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.030
 match a television colleague 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.230
 sender who was doing the so-called 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.300
 commentary of the fan 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 at the time of the third goal it has been is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.739
 been attacked we say from objects that 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.090
 they were launched right from dai 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.980
 stands exactly over the stand 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:51.870
 also print on ourselves that 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.940
 we really felt a big one 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.460
 flickering over our heads 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.989
 however things things I hope things 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.420
 negative things I want to hear about too 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.800
 marcello nicchi but let's go first if if 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.140
 he wants to talk about it too if he does 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.479
 obviously if we want to comment 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.710
 this year in the international football of the 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.290
 Spanish football these things do not 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.560
 benitez happen unfortunately good evening 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:15.540
 they look like it's not good news but me 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.189
 I have not seen believe we must 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.740
 behave in football 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.689
 each has its own responsibility and 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.580
 authorities must do what they have to do 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.090
 indeed, in fact , the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.740
 Digos 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.970
 among other things to quell this one 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.710
 situation however we talk about the 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:31.170
 match set because you are ha 

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.310
 practically at an average of 4 goals in the 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.950
 last 6 games 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.630
 today he returned to mark his distinguished 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.490
 first Italian first goal goal 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:41.280
 I ask her why 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.140
 in the collective imagination only the 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.850
 Rome can be considered the eventual 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:46.860
 anti juve and not even napoli because 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.960
 she always says that you are at 75 for 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.079
 hundred of yours of yours 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:54.509
 possibility if you will arrive adopt it 80 o 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.930
 90 to one hundred percent what happens 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.829
 I said last time at 76 a little 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.079
 better 

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.180
 no but I still believe that some are missing 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.430
 players who are injured who they are 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:08.250
 quality players who can do the 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:11.550
 difference and believe what is true that 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.530
 the championship a spectacular championship 

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.110
 he is also doing the juve that he is 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.390
 doing the rome and we don't the same 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.570
 we can do more than try to win 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.770
 our games see that they do 

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:24.870
 ministry what francesca the same 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.510
 francesca consecutive yes no I wanted 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.680
 ask you something in benitez showing 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:30.780
 our title the first time of 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.520
 lorenzo because today he confirmed a 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.290
 mertens in great shape fifth net in 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.540
 championship four in the last three 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.580
 matches but assigned lorenzo teaches him 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.440
 we said just last week is 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.180
 the fact that this is unlocked 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.590
 is the first Italian goal of Naples that 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.940
 can mean for the championship of 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.620
 naples for the championship teaches that a 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.989
 player also important for the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.150
 national prandelli 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:53.100
 or we think that good in china is important 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.530
 because we don't talk about this anymore 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:57.959
 let's talk about his performance that I believe 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.090
 that even more important for us is 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.390
 play well and score goals 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.850
 all happy safe but i think for 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:08.370
 him and the team 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.260
 yes he always plays a point well 

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.459
 reference always a helps 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:14.160
 and always difficult for opponents 

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:16.560
 check it one last thing and then the 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:18.959
 we say goodbye and the same question I asked 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.690
 let's say before you flourish so many points 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.250
 so far from juventus and staying in 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.070
 only two points from the second place can not 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:28.140
 also how to say psychologically 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:29.760
 take you to the idea of ​​aiming for that guy 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.530
 in short, a goal to give already for 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.180
 finished the scudetto speech beyond 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:35.970
 what will come on the market of which 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:38.280
 she doesn't want to talk images no 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.590
 clearly no we have to think 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.900
 always the next game is the most 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.030
 important to be prepared we win 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.519
 our parts of them win not 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.410
 we can do nothing but yes they do 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.329
 some mistake we must be more 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:53.250
 close as possible and this means 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:54.930
 be concentrated in every game 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:56.640
 giorgi was not liked by a player from 

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:58.799
 Verona today has got a chance and watching 

00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.019
 all very panda that was close to him 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:02.970
 I liked panda news a lot more and 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:03.990
 come on quickly 

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.970
 when to ask the coach if he is 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.440
 worried about behrami because from that 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:09.540
 that I understand this injury is a 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.800
 complicated than it seemed 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.480
 the beginning no 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:15.240
 the only thing is the communication that is 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:17.040
 been a little changed than that of us 

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:18.720
 we wait but now must do 

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:19.769
 the appointment with the doctor later 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.670
 we decide what we do 

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:22.670
 thank you
