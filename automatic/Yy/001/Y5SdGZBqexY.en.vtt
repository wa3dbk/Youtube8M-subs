00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
we've had our fun with sci-fi strategy

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.279 
we've had our fun with sci-fi strategy
with<00:00:23.490> the<00:00:23.519> sins<00:00:23.850> of<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.029> solar<00:00:24.060> empire<00:00:24.330> series

with the sins of a solar empire series

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.769 
with the sins of a solar empire series
and<00:00:25.590> now<00:00:26.189> we're<00:00:26.400> moving<00:00:26.550> into<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.150> sins<00:00:27.480> of<00:00:27.660> a

Dark Age series so I take it we're

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:31.880 
Dark Age series so I take it we're
moving<00:00:30.150> away<00:00:30.240> from<00:00:30.390> the<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.170> grand<00:00:31.470> outer

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
moving away from the the grand outer

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.000 
moving away from the the grand outer
space<00:00:33.170> spaceship<00:00:34.170> battles<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.829> have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
space spaceship battles and what have

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.010 
space spaceship battles and what have
you<00:00:35.040> yet<00:00:35.460> moving<00:00:35.910> into<00:00:36.030> something<00:00:36.360> more<00:00:36.540> yeah

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
you yet moving into something more yeah

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.290 
you yet moving into something more yeah
now<00:00:37.380> we're<00:00:37.680> dealing<00:00:38.070> in<00:00:38.190> to<00:00:38.370> land<00:00:38.730> battles

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:39.300 
now we're dealing in to land battles

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.560 
now we're dealing in to land battles
with<00:00:39.660> mass<00:00:39.989> carnage<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:41.070> magic<00:00:41.790> spells<00:00:42.149> and

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
with mass carnage and magic spells and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.680 
with mass carnage and magic spells and
cavalry<00:00:43.260> flanks<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:44.450> resource<00:00:45.450> acquisition

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
cavalry flanks and resource acquisition

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.819 
cavalry flanks and resource acquisition
and<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:47.250> know<00:00:47.660> maneuvers<00:00:48.660> around<00:00:48.899> forests

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
and you know maneuvers around forests

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.790 
and you know maneuvers around forests
and<00:00:50.100> around<00:00:50.780> difficult<00:00:51.780> cliffs<00:00:52.110> and<00:00:52.440> whatnot

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
and around difficult cliffs and whatnot

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.290 
and around difficult cliffs and whatnot
so<00:00:53.190> are<00:00:53.309> you<00:00:53.399> still<00:00:53.670> going<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.910> attempt<00:00:54.239> to

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
so are you still going to attempt to

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.630 
so are you still going to attempt to
have<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.629> same<00:00:54.930> sense<00:00:55.469> of<00:00:55.620> grand<00:00:56.160> scale

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
have the same sense of grand scale

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.520 
have the same sense of grand scale
that's<00:00:57.180> seen<00:00:57.449> in<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.960> sins<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.500> solar

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that's seen in the sins of a solar

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.860 
that's seen in the sins of a solar
empire<00:00:58.770> game<00:00:59.160> no<00:00:59.370> we're<00:00:59.670> we're<00:01:00.210> toning<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.690> way

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
empire game no we're we're toning it way

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.540 
empire game no we're we're toning it way
back<00:01:01.109> because<00:01:01.440> we<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:01.739> our<00:01:01.890> play<00:01:02.100> sessions

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
back because we want our play sessions

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.090 
back because we want our play sessions
to<00:01:02.760> play<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> much<00:01:03.300> shorter<00:01:03.510> time<00:01:03.660> frame<00:01:04.199> so

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
to play on a much shorter time frame so

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.000 
to play on a much shorter time frame so
our<00:01:05.729> approach<00:01:06.240> is<00:01:06.540> really<00:01:06.930> kind<00:01:07.590> of<00:01:07.740> what<00:01:07.890> we

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
our approach is really kind of what we

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.460 
our approach is really kind of what we
did<00:01:08.250> with<00:01:08.430> sins<00:01:08.700> where<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.030> hybridized<00:01:09.600> real

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
did with sins where we hybridized real

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.920 
did with sins where we hybridized real
time<00:01:10.740> strategy<00:01:11.010> with<00:01:11.549> four<00:01:11.790> x<00:01:12.000> games<00:01:12.299> now

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
time strategy with four x games now

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.380 
time strategy with four x games now
we're<00:01:13.140> taking<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:14.189> traditional<00:01:14.939> realtime

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
we're taking the traditional realtime

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.120 
we're taking the traditional realtime
strategy<00:01:15.540> game<00:01:16.049> and<00:01:16.259> hybridizing<00:01:16.619> it<00:01:16.920> with

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
strategy game and hybridizing it with

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:20.109 
strategy game and hybridizing it with
what<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.180> lot<00:01:18.360> of<00:01:18.390> people<00:01:18.479> call<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.960> action<00:01:19.409> RTS

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:20.119 
what a lot of people call the action RTS

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.330 
what a lot of people call the action RTS
so<00:01:21.119> when<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.390> say<00:01:21.630> action<00:01:22.320> RTS<00:01:22.799> does<00:01:23.159> that

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
so when you say action RTS does that

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.390 
so when you say action RTS does that
mean<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.210> do<00:01:24.270> you<00:01:24.299> mean<00:01:24.450> by<00:01:24.509> that<00:01:24.720> exactly

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
mean what do you mean by that exactly

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.969 
mean what do you mean by that exactly
action<00:01:26.400> RTS<00:01:26.820> a<00:01:27.150> lot<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.540> people<00:01:27.659> know<00:01:27.810> as<00:01:28.320> the

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
action RTS a lot of people know as the

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.730 
action RTS a lot of people know as the
DOTA<00:01:29.280> clone<00:01:29.549> style<00:01:30.090> type<00:01:30.840> stuff<00:01:31.140> or<00:01:31.380> league<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
DOTA clone style type stuff or league of

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:33.260 
DOTA clone style type stuff or league of
legends<00:01:32.130> and<00:01:32.280> whatnot<00:01:32.610> but<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.119> have<00:01:33.240> a

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
legends and whatnot but we have a

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.080 
legends and whatnot but we have a
completely<00:01:33.720> new<00:01:33.840> approach<00:01:33.990> and<00:01:34.680> how<00:01:35.490> that<00:01:35.790> is

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
completely new approach and how that is

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.330 
completely new approach and how that is
going<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.689> integrate<00:01:37.020> into<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> real<00:01:38.100> time

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
going to integrate into a real time

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.840 
going to integrate into a real time
strategy<00:01:39.320> type<00:01:40.320> game<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.549> there<00:01:41.670> going<00:01:41.790> to

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
strategy type game so is there going to

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.810 
strategy type game so is there going to
be<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.689> is<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:42.930> focused<00:01:43.350> on<00:01:43.530> like<00:01:43.770> combat<00:01:44.579> and

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
be so is it focused on like combat and

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.249 
be so is it focused on like combat and
tactics<00:01:45.299> or<00:01:45.450> is<00:01:45.570> there<00:01:45.720> still<00:01:45.780> going<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.140> be

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
tactics or is there still going to be

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:47.840 
tactics or is there still going to be
base<00:01:46.619> building<00:01:46.920> resource<00:01:47.490> management

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
base building resource management

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:50.420 
base building resource management
involved<00:01:48.329> it's<00:01:48.720> again<00:01:49.470> we're<00:01:49.979> looking<00:01:50.250> at<00:01:50.340> the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
involved it's again we're looking at the

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.069 
involved it's again we're looking at the
philosophy<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.060> took<00:01:51.210> in<00:01:51.390> since<00:01:51.659> there<00:01:51.960> was<00:01:52.049> a

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
philosophy we took in since there was a

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:54.380 
philosophy we took in since there was a
high-level<00:01:52.680> strategy<00:01:53.270> component<00:01:54.270> of<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
high-level strategy component of the

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.560 
high-level strategy component of the
