that i'm wearing now is the skin finish

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:52.170 
that i'm wearing now is the skin finish
which<00:03:50.409> is<00:03:50.440> what<00:03:50.739> makes<00:03:50.919> it<00:03:51.129> look<00:03:51.370> so<00:03:51.400> nice<00:03:51.819> I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
which is what makes it look so nice I

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:56.189 
which is what makes it look so nice I
think<00:03:52.810> that<00:03:54.209> the<00:03:55.209> estee<00:03:55.510> lauder<00:03:55.720> double<00:03:55.870> wear

00:03:56.189 --> 00:03:56.199 
think that the estee lauder double wear

00:03:56.199 --> 00:04:01.140 
think that the estee lauder double wear
and<00:03:57.629> the<00:03:58.629> new<00:03:58.870> one<00:03:59.079> is<00:03:59.260> just<00:03:59.530> absolutely<00:04:00.150> come

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:01.150

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:03.270 
and the new one is just absolutely come
it's<00:04:01.479> completely<00:04:02.079> different<00:04:02.260> it<00:04:02.739> you<00:04:03.099> might

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
it's completely different it you might

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280 
it's completely different it you might
as<00:04:03.340> well<00:04:03.669> call<00:04:03.909> it<00:04:03.970> the<00:04:04.269> new<00:04:04.720> double<00:04:05.109> well

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
as well call it the new double well

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.229 
as well call it the new double well
light<00:04:05.560> because<00:04:06.129> that's<00:04:06.400> what<00:04:06.609> I<00:04:06.639> feel<00:04:06.970> it<00:04:07.120> is

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:07.239 
light because that's what I feel it is

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:09.149 
light because that's what I feel it is
it's<00:04:07.419> quite<00:04:07.659> watery<00:04:07.900> it's<00:04:08.409> nothing<00:04:08.859> like<00:04:09.010> the

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
it's quite watery it's nothing like the

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:11.250 
it's quite watery it's nothing like the
coverage<00:04:09.549> that<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:09.849> used<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.180> have<00:04:10.359> I<00:04:10.659> think

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
coverage that you used to have I think

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.990 
coverage that you used to have I think
if<00:04:11.379> you're<00:04:11.530> wanting<00:04:11.889> a<00:04:12.310> light<00:04:12.519> coverage

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.580 
if you're wanting a light coverage
foundation<00:04:13.659> you'd<00:04:13.810> be<00:04:13.900> better<00:04:14.169> off<00:04:14.260> buying

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
foundation you'd be better off buying

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:16.920 
foundation you'd be better off buying
full<00:04:14.949> coverage<00:04:15.280> foundation<00:04:15.630> because<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.840> will

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
full coverage foundation because it will

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:18.360 
full coverage foundation because it will
last<00:04:17.109> you<00:04:17.380> longer<00:04:17.620> because<00:04:18.010> you<00:04:18.099> can<00:04:18.250> then

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
last you longer because you can then

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.250 
last you longer because you can then
