00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.639
 Hi, I'm Sandra from my mix media and the 

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.650
 Today's tutorial is to learn the use 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.080
 basic gel and blake 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.650
 The gel plate or the jailbreaking plate is 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:21.169
 a printing plate is treated as 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.359
 you see from this surface 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:26.869
 which is similar to gelatin but is 

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:29.150
 resistant is flexible is made of a 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:31.820
 mineral oil and it's a little sticky 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.949
 on top of this surface we usually 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:36.110
 work with paintings i go to work 

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:38.239
 with the acrylic paints that are the 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.580
 paintings that are most commonly 

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:42.920
 used on the plate scioli plate 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:44.989
 let's see some example of how it is used 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.879
 the basic material that we need to 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.510
 use with the gel and play is the 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.610
 following 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.559
 On the one hand we need a roller to 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.739
 extend the paint 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:56.350
 we need a surface that is 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.129
 plastic 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.809
 or glass that is not porous that has 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.720
 the pore totally closed to put 

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:06.970
 above and plate and we need to 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.220
 Of course, acrylic paints and 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.560
 we also need paper for 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.140
 to be able to make the impression of the painting 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:16.659
 can be cardboard can be paper of 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.580
 watercolor can be like this a role of 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.350
 80 grams of normal photocopy and 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.090
 current also serves us we go to 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.720
 put paint on the gel and play for 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.569
 see how it is used it simply gets 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.179
 so a little paint and what not and with 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:35.310
 the roller extends above the 

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:38.780
 huaca can be only a part can be 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.780
 on top of all the terrible 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.780
 and now we will see 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.940
 like the painting that we have extended 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:54.290
 on top of the plate as it was printed 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.290
 on top of the paper 

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.840
 we can push a little paper 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:00.840
 capture the paint well 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.230
 and we have a totally surface 

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.660
 smooth because we have extended 

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.450
 completely the painting that happens that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.820
 This plate is special because it is 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.710
 plate is very sensitive and any brand 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.820
 what we do on the plate when 

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:20.410
 there is the painting is left marked we are going to 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.680
 see him 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:27.610
 I'm going to put paint again this time 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.980
 I'm going to put two colors to see that 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:32.550
 we can also combine colors over 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:32.550
 of the plate 

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:41.470
 if the roller is too full of 

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:45.280
 paint we can clean it up 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:47.270
 another surface and we take advantage to 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.400
 make funds 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.810
 and what can we do then we can do 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.720
 brands 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:55.730
 when any material that I'm going to use 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.520
 my hand and as you see has been 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.599
 totally marked my hand on top of the 

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.150
 plate jelly plate 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:06.849
 I have removed some paint we are going to 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.849
 do the printing with another paper 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:13.880
 here we have a first impression but 

00:03:11.409 --> 00:03:16.220
 as I have put a lot of paint 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:17.480
 I still have paint on the sil and plate 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:19.900
 and can go back to do a second 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:19.900
 Print 

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:29.420
 and this time they still look more because 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:32.450
 as I have removed the paint the thickness of 

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:36.020
 painting that was on top as it stands out 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.670
 more to the brand and the painting I have a 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.250
 second impression what you have of 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:43.580
 special the plate of heddy plate is that 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:46.370
 its surface is extremely sensitive 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.410
 and any brand made with any 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:51.470
 type of material because it is not 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.290
 marked above the surface and with 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.430
 paint and a paper then we can 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:00.530
 capture it and therefore use the 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:02.840
 chili plate and brands to create 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:06.430
 shapes and to create textures and to 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.930
 get then decorated papers or backgrounds 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.970
 for our jobs he believes he has a 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.520
 tutorial today we're going to see a way 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:15.710
 very easy to have very impressions 

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.080
 pretty with the gel and plate we're going to 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:22.980
 then use templates with shapes and 

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:26.370
 defined that give us already an image 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:29.450
 that allows us to use it directly 

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.450
 in our jobs 

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.139
 if I put the template directly 

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.310
 on top of the plate 

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:44.310
 with the roller 

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:52.940
 the pressure or I take out the template as 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:56.080
 we see it has been marked to the form 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:59.740
 over the gel and plate and with a paper 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.740
 we capture the image 

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:13.130
 and here we have an impression 

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.260
 with the form of the template that already 

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:17.180
 We can use directly in 

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:19.729
 any of our nobel here I have 

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.010
 some cards made with impressions 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.199
 of gel and plate that is simply treated 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:26.260
 to catch 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:30.470
 as a part of our impression 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:33.229
 cut it out and make a card for very 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.030
 fast and with a very nice effect 

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:38.030
 start and take care of the shell plate and 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:39.860
 play that is very simple and you can 

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:44.300
 clean directly with a wipe 

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:46.220
 baby as you see it cleans very easily 

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:48.349
 the marks that may have standing 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:52.060
 although I already have it clean I teach you that 

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:52.060
 we can also spray with water 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.599
 and with a cotton cloth also 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.580
 clean badly clean lukewarm 

00:05:57.599 --> 00:06:01.919
 important also for the care of the 

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.349
 plate is that we should not use in your 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:06.229
 surface no material that can 

00:06:04.349 --> 00:06:09.300
 damage the plate or that can perforate it 

00:06:06.229 --> 00:06:11.639
 that has a point and that can pierce 

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:14.460
 because then we will have the brand of 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:16.050
 permanently on top of the square as 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.180
 I said at the beginning it's important 

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.780
 put it on top of a surface 

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:24.479
 glass plastic a tray that does not 

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:27.599
 be porous and make it cocktail that has the 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:30.000
 closed pore it is important to know that 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.729
 on top of the plate we can not use 

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.979
 papers containing glitter neither 

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:37.770
 bright papers no papers either 

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.270
 photographic because we can 

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:42.350
 damage the plate can we 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.660
 spoil the sensitivity of silver 

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:46.760
 once we have finished the work with 

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:49.640
 the plate then we clean it and the 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:52.660
 we keep in their protective plastics and 

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:52.660
 we keep it in its case 

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.470
 and until here this first jelly video 

00:06:55.490 --> 00:06:59.470
 play for beginners see you soon
