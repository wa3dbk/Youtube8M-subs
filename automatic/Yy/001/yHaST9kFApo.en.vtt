00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.850 
and then it would blow up the high
voltage<00:02:00.540> unit<00:02:00.840> so<00:02:00.990> you<00:02:01.020> know<00:02:01.200> what<00:02:01.350> I<00:02:01.380> did<00:02:01.680> I

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
voltage unit so you know what I did I

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.190 
voltage unit so you know what I did I
took<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:02.399> out<00:02:02.640> I<00:02:02.909> dropped<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.049> the

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
took them out I dropped them in the

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.350 
took them out I dropped them in the
trash<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.920> I<00:02:05.130> put<00:02:05.310> a<00:02:05.340> tempest<00:02:05.850> monitoring

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
trash and I put a tempest monitoring

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
trash and I put a tempest monitoring
thank<00:02:06.600> goodness<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.200> plot<00:02:07.530> plugs<00:02:08.280> in<00:02:08.520> funny

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
thank goodness the plot plugs in funny

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:09.550 
thank goodness the plot plugs in funny

only<00:02:09.739> downside<00:02:10.399> is<00:02:10.970> there's<00:02:11.540> a<00:02:11.599> stretch<00:02:12.080> here

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
only downside is there's a stretch here

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.070 
only downside is there's a stretch here
so<00:02:13.400> unless<00:02:13.700> you<00:02:13.880> have<00:02:14.030> an<00:02:14.150> extender<00:02:14.690> you<00:02:14.810> have

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
so unless you have an extender you have

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.440 
so unless you have an extender you have
to<00:02:15.319> use<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.800> filter<00:02:16.190> board<00:02:16.459> oh<00:02:16.700> I<00:02:16.819> hate

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
to use the filter board oh I hate

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.120 
to use the filter board oh I hate
filtered<00:02:17.900> words<00:02:18.140> but<00:02:18.319> in<00:02:18.410> this<00:02:18.530> case<00:02:18.739> I<00:02:18.950> had<00:02:19.099> to

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
filtered words but in this case I had to

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.520 
filtered words but in this case I had to
use<00:02:19.370> it<00:02:19.550> so<00:02:20.360> we<00:02:20.390> got<00:02:20.660> the<00:02:20.810> filter<00:02:21.140> board<00:02:21.380> in

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
use it so we got the filter board in

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.620 
use it so we got the filter board in
here<00:02:21.709> so<00:02:21.950> we<00:02:22.459> can<00:02:22.640> get<00:02:22.730> this<00:02:22.940> plugged<00:02:23.209> in<00:02:23.450> and

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
here so we can get this plugged in and

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.290 
here so we can get this plugged in and
there's<00:02:23.780> still<00:02:24.260> a<00:02:24.290> little<00:02:24.530> slack<00:02:24.830> Bob<00:02:25.760> Roberts
