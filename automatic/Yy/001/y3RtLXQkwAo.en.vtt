in a second alright guys we're back on

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.499 
in a second alright guys we're back on
bead<00:01:26.009> bomb<00:01:26.250> we<00:01:26.880> were<00:01:27.000> going<00:01:27.119> to<00:01:27.210> just<00:01:27.360> cover

00:01:27.499 --> 00:01:27.509 
bead bomb we were going to just cover

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:29.660 
bead bomb we were going to just cover
the<00:01:27.659> basic<00:01:28.020> bong<00:01:28.200> pipe<00:01:28.409> bomb<00:01:28.920> plants<00:01:29.220> first<00:01:29.460> so

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the basic bong pipe bomb plants first so

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.039 
the basic bong pipe bomb plants first so
we're<00:01:29.790> going<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.970> go<00:01:30.090> into<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.420> corner<00:01:30.720> again

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
we're going to go into this corner again

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:34.160 
we're going to go into this corner again
obviously<00:01:31.829> this<00:01:31.950> corner<00:01:32.310> isn't<00:01:32.520> as<00:01:32.880> a<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.659> much

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
obviously this corner isn't as a as much

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.899 
obviously this corner isn't as a as much
of<00:01:34.290> an<00:01:34.380> advantage<00:01:34.500> you<00:01:35.220> can't<00:01:35.460> actually<00:01:35.610> see

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
of an advantage you can't actually see

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.789 
of an advantage you can't actually see
the<00:01:36.060> bomb<00:01:36.210> from<00:01:36.240> this<00:01:36.570> one<00:01:36.750> you<00:01:37.380> can't<00:01:37.619> cover

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
the bomb from this one you can't cover

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.890 
the bomb from this one you can't cover
from<00:01:38.100> down<00:01:38.280> here<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> you<00:01:39.240> can<00:01:39.390> come<00:01:39.570> over<00:01:39.689> to

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
from down here and you can come over to

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.870 
from down here and you can come over to
this<00:01:39.990> point<00:01:40.200> and<00:01:40.439> see<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> bomb<00:01:40.920> and<00:01:41.130> but<00:01:41.790> the

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
this point and see the bomb and but the

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.670 
this point and see the bomb and but the
only<00:01:42.000> problem<00:01:42.210> with<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.630> too<00:01:43.290> exposed

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
only problem with that is too exposed

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.620 
only problem with that is too exposed
here<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.369> if<00:01:44.520> someone<00:01:45.060> comes<00:01:45.270> running<00:01:45.600> down

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
here so if if someone comes running down

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:46.789 
here so if if someone comes running down
here<00:01:45.960> they're<00:01:46.140> going<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.320> see<00:01:46.439> you<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> that

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
here they're going to see you in that

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.010 
here they're going to see you in that
corner<00:01:47.189> relatively<00:01:47.700> easy<00:01:47.909> so<00:01:48.659> I<00:01:48.689> wouldn't

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
corner relatively easy so I wouldn't

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.450 
corner relatively easy so I wouldn't
suggest<00:01:49.140> doing<00:01:49.500> that<00:01:49.619> what<00:01:49.920> I'd<00:01:50.009> suggest<00:01:50.340> is

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
suggest doing that what I'd suggest is

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.039 
suggest doing that what I'd suggest is
coming<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:50.820> here<00:01:51.119> and<00:01:51.240> watch<00:01:51.659> him<00:01:51.840> from<00:01:51.960> this

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
coming over here and watch him from this

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.889 
coming over here and watch him from this
direction<00:01:52.350> you<00:01:53.159> can<00:01:53.340> kind<00:01:53.909> of<00:01:54.060> see<00:01:54.240> up<00:01:54.390> top<00:01:54.630> to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
direction you can kind of see up top to

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.219 
direction you can kind of see up top to
the<00:01:55.590> train<00:01:55.890> tracks<00:01:56.189> but<00:01:56.399> not<00:01:56.969> too<00:01:57.210> much<00:01:57.240> again

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the train tracks but not too much again

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.990 
the train tracks but not too much again
there's<00:01:58.649> this<00:01:58.770> spot<00:01:59.399> here<00:01:59.670> which<00:01:59.850> is

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
there's this spot here which is

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.310 
there's this spot here which is
impenetrable<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.840> know<00:02:00.960> the<00:02:01.049> coming<00:02:01.229> from

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
impenetrable if you know the coming from

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.109 
impenetrable if you know the coming from
spawn<00:02:01.590> these<00:02:02.159> glass<00:02:02.490> parts<00:02:02.880> here

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
spawn these glass parts here

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.940 
spawn these glass parts here
impenetrable<00:02:03.420> so<00:02:04.170> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.380> watch<00:02:04.530> from<00:02:04.740> this

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
impenetrable so you can watch from this

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.010

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.449 
over here easily take them out and what
they're<00:04:19.260> going<00:04:19.410> to<00:04:19.500> think<00:04:19.560> is<00:04:19.830> is<00:04:20.010> using

00:04:20.449 --> 00:04:20.459 
they're going to think is is using

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:22.130 
they're going to think is is using
either<00:04:20.669> in<00:04:20.910> lower<00:04:21.180> trains<00:04:21.570> and<00:04:21.930> they're<00:04:22.020> not

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:22.140 
either in lower trains and they're not

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:23.870 
either in lower trains and they're not
going<00:04:22.260> to<00:04:22.320> realize<00:04:22.710> so<00:04:23.280> you<00:04:23.340> can<00:04:23.550> do<00:04:23.640> after

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
going to realize so you can do after

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:25.190 
going to realize so you can do after
that<00:04:23.910> is<00:04:24.030> you<00:04:24.210> can<00:04:24.360> come<00:04:24.510> down<00:04:24.539> into<00:04:24.870> trains

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
that is you can come down into trains

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:27.440 
that is you can come down into trains
and<00:04:25.620> obviously<00:04:25.950> cover<00:04:26.220> it<00:04:26.340> from<00:04:26.460> over<00:04:26.729> here

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
and obviously cover it from over here

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.270 
and obviously cover it from over here
through<00:04:27.690> and<00:04:27.960> come<00:04:28.410> through<00:04:28.650> here<00:04:28.890> and<00:04:29.130> then

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:29.280 
through and come through here and then

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:31.820 
through and come through here and then
basically<00:04:30.000> wind<00:04:30.450> around<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:31.410> better<00:04:31.560> to<00:04:31.710> do

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
basically wind around it's better to do

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:34.490 
basically wind around it's better to do

sometimes enemies across the train track
from<00:05:13.200> be<00:05:13.350> just<00:05:13.980> jump<00:05:14.220> straight<00:05:14.280> inside<00:05:14.880> there
