but anyways in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.870 
but anyways in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:12.690> teach<00:00:12.780> you<00:00:12.870> guys<00:00:13.110> how<00:00:13.170> to<00:00:13.380> control<00:00:13.950> styles

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.660 
to teach you guys how to control styles
by<00:00:15.360> using<00:00:15.599> something<00:00:15.960> called<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.440> class<00:00:16.890> now

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
by using something called a class now

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.990 
by using something called a class now
what<00:00:18.210> a<00:00:18.240> class<00:00:18.690> is<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.380> it's<00:00:20.070> similar<00:00:20.670> to<00:00:20.970> a

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
what a class is is it's similar to a

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.290 
what a class is is it's similar to a
span<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:22.080> sense<00:00:22.320> that<00:00:22.439> we<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.430> affect<00:00:23.850> the

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
span in the sense that we can affect the

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.870 
span in the sense that we can affect the
same<00:00:24.600> element<00:00:25.230> in<00:00:25.350> different<00:00:25.740> ways<00:00:25.920> so<00:00:26.250> let<00:00:26.789> me

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
same element in different ways so let me

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.580 
same element in different ways so let me
break<00:00:27.060> this<00:00:27.210> down<00:00:27.390> for<00:00:27.449> you<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> little<00:00:28.170> more

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
break this down for you a little more

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:32.150 
break this down for you a little more
clear<00:00:28.949> before<00:00:29.869> we've<00:00:30.869> been<00:00:31.050> using<00:00:31.320> elements

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
clear before we've been using elements

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.940 
clear before we've been using elements
to<00:00:32.489> apply<00:00:32.790> styles<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.540> everything<00:00:34.440> on<00:00:34.680> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
to apply styles to everything on the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.740 
to apply styles to everything on the
webpage<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.340> was<00:00:35.790> the<00:00:35.880> same<00:00:36.120> element<00:00:36.570> for

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
webpage that was the same element for

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.979 
webpage that was the same element for
example<00:00:37.200> if<00:00:37.380> we<00:00:38.040> had<00:00:38.280> eight<00:00:38.910> paragraphs<00:00:39.450> and

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
example if we had eight paragraphs and

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.709 
example if we had eight paragraphs and
we<00:00:40.379> applied<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.710> style<00:00:41.190> to<00:00:41.550> the<00:00:41.879> paragraph<00:00:42.420> tag

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
we applied a style to the paragraph tag

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.709 
we applied a style to the paragraph tag
it<00:00:43.140> would<00:00:43.290> affect<00:00:43.620> all<00:00:43.829> eight<00:00:44.309> paragraphs<00:00:45.149> but

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
it would affect all eight paragraphs but

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:48.020 
it would affect all eight paragraphs but

refresh and see what we got

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.240 
refresh and see what we got
now<00:04:30.160> this<00:04:30.520> paragraph<00:04:31.090> is<00:04:31.510> the<00:04:32.380> only<00:04:32.560> paragraph

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070 
that belongs to the class read text so

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.520 
that belongs to the class read text so
this<00:04:36.370> is<00:04:36.610> the<00:04:36.760> only<00:04:36.940> paragraph<00:04:37.480> that's<00:04:38.260> going

belong to the class green Goblin's go

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.770 
belong to the class green Goblin's go
ahead<00:04:53.500> and<00:04:53.680> save<00:04:53.890> this<00:04:54.130> in<00:04:54.430> refresh<00:04:55.120> we<00:04:55.750> can

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
ahead and save this in refresh we can

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.590 
ahead and save this in refresh we can
see<00:04:56.080> that<00:04:56.260> this<00:04:56.530> text<00:04:56.890> is<00:04:57.100> now<00:04:57.370> green<00:04:57.700> so

00:04:58.590 --> 00:04:58.600 
see that this text is now green so

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.440 
see that this text is now green so
before<00:04:59.170> this<00:04:59.380> tutorial<00:04:59.950> we<00:05:00.850> really<00:05:01.240> had<00:05:01.420> no

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:01.450 
before this tutorial we really had no

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.340 
before this tutorial we really had no
way<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:02.910> segregating<00:05:03.910> the<00:05:04.270> two<00:05:04.870> paragraphs

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:05.350 
way of segregating the two paragraphs

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.010 
way of segregating the two paragraphs
and<00:05:05.880> you<00:05:06.880> can<00:05:07.030> make<00:05:07.180> them<00:05:07.270> any<00:05:07.480> color<00:05:07.720> you<00:05:07.900> want

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
and you can make them any color you want

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.080 
and you can make them any color you want
I<00:05:08.230> chose<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.560> red<00:05:08.710> and<00:05:08.860> green<00:05:09.070> don't<00:05:09.880> choose

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:10.090 
I chose the red and green don't choose

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:11.610 
I chose the red and green don't choose
black<00:05:10.390> and<00:05:10.420> white<00:05:10.690> because<00:05:10.930> that's<00:05:11.290> just

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
black and white because that's just

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.880 
black and white because that's just
racist<00:05:11.830> and<00:05:12.600> anyways<00:05:13.600> like<00:05:13.780> I<00:05:13.930> was<00:05:13.960> saying<00:05:14.260> we

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:14.890 
racist and anyways like I was saying we

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:17.640 
racist and anyways like I was saying we
can<00:05:15.070> now<00:05:15.450> segregate<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.660> classes<00:05:17.200> and<00:05:17.410> add

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
can now segregate the classes and add

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.940 
can now segregate the classes and add
more<00:05:18.180> customization<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.870> the<00:05:19.900> same<00:05:20.440> element

00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:20.950 
more customization to the same element

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:23.430 
more customization to the same element
whereas<00:05:21.520> before<00:05:22.060> when<00:05:22.630> we<00:05:22.840> add<00:05:22.960> one<00:05:23.200> element

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
whereas before when we add one element

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:26.490 
whereas before when we add one element
we<00:05:23.980> had<00:05:24.160> one<00:05:24.430> rule<00:05:24.700> where<00:05:25.510> affected<00:05:26.200> all<00:05:26.470> the

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
we had one rule where affected all the

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.580 
we had one rule where affected all the
elements<00:05:27.220> on<00:05:27.370> the<00:05:27.480> page<00:05:28.480> all<00:05:28.780> the<00:05:28.840> paragraphs

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
elements on the page all the paragraphs

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:32.220 
elements on the page all the paragraphs
on<00:05:29.770> page<00:05:30.040> all<00:05:30.280> the<00:05:30.340> headers<00:05:31.060> on<00:05:31.270> page<00:05:31.540> they<00:05:32.020> got

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:32.230 
on page all the headers on page they got

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:34.230 
on page all the headers on page they got
the<00:05:32.410> same<00:05:32.650> rule<00:05:32.919> well<00:05:33.370> now<00:05:33.550> we<00:05:33.610> can<00:05:33.880> split<00:05:34.120> them

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:34.240 
the same rule well now we can split them

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:37.230 
the same rule well now we can split them
up<00:05:34.390> and<00:05:34.720> for<00:05:35.620> this<00:05:35.800> example<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.610> wasn't<00:05:37.000> really

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:37.240 
up and for this example it wasn't really

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:39.480 
up and for this example it wasn't really
useful<00:05:37.630> because<00:05:38.020> I<00:05:38.050> mean<00:05:38.530> we<00:05:38.919> could<00:05:39.040> just<00:05:39.280> use

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:39.490 
useful because I mean we could just use

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:42.780 
useful because I mean we could just use
span<00:05:39.880> or<00:05:40.300> anything<00:05:40.870> we<00:05:41.740> could<00:05:41.890> even<00:05:42.130> use<00:05:42.250> div

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:42.790 
span or anything we could even use div

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:47.100 
span or anything we could even use div
