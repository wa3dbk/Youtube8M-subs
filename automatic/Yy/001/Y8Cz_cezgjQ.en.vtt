00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.310
 this game was a smashing one last year 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.960
 opening play or one it was one of 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:08.790
 the seven smooth victories in a row that 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.440
 Kruburg meanwhile counts against locks 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.719
 although it is often difficult 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.549
 then it was competitions this time too 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.500
 so a lot of changes for the wall 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.240
 the basic elf of michel preud'homme 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.980
 striking the starting place for cloud that 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.810
 way that cannot be used in a European way 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.789
 forms is saved 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.099
 bad is that the fragile knee victor 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.650
 vazquez again ensure pair your box is 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.210
 Here is his substitute for that source 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.460
 for its good backup performance 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.860
 rewarded with his first base site 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.660
 in this competition peter ma she has 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.700
 Friday night is well cursed at the 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.620
 later winning goal of racing genk on 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.780
 westerlo he seemed like you manage them 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.920
 both wing defenders galitsios and 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.450
 already through 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.430
 And of course the eyes will be focused again 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:50.399
 are on hans vanaken 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
 still a target of club Brugge 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.430
 the referee a Jan tonight 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.430
 breydel and I have a closer look at them 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:58.000
 Yes 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:05.950
 how the timing of hans live for today 

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:08.230
 Patosi otto see past inside 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.930
 aduard had not come before does that 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.479
 excellent with the foot but it remains 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:15.820
 also what the clock beats here the bridge and 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:18.130
 eye at no time or way 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.050
 been dangerous and does is again 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.960
 threat of walking without a real big one 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.960
 chances to goal the ball back 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.240
 light sometimes directly to bolingoli by 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.620
 care by which is put off the ball 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.170
 by in gassel 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
 he still comes in as gifts 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:39.549
 the box gifts 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.740
 deviated ball through the ears 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.500
 davino conceals 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:47.439
 first moment from petty bourgeois direction 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.390
 Lure target to ran out after the outbreak of 

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:51.579
 the pole where Ryan had to intervene 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:54.250
 come 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:56.470
 fantasy is good seen now that is possible through 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.030
 make her into politics like fog 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:00.399
 a little speed 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.170
 looks at him busy Hans vanaken red 

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:04.170
 glow of burning mechelen 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 high corner number 6 for locks 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:12.599
 every blemish potosi 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:20.190
 water purchase for only something 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.920
 yes that's not out of the blue that lead 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.650
 for luring that he picks like 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.300
 started the party 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:29.220
 the two central defenders now roof 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.620
 here is ingersoll 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:34.050
 and then there is only something and then them 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.280
 top shooter of running that are in between 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.720
 sixth goal 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.370
 of course we also have penalties 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:42.080
 because he is the regular take 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:42.080
 goal one after 21 minutes 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.819
 come along for another counter attack 

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:56.740
 loo tap here is all that you get 

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:59.590
 from patosi comes 28 we are now with this 

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:02.320
 what once badly suspected now first against 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:06.330
 your box and then the place ball is not there 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.330
 by a surprising panna 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.150
 your book 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:17.380
 is carol 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.490
 bob and the left arm and then you lock 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.550
 of this cable 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:22.570
 a good shot is needed then it is 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.590
 most dangerous of 

00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:29.620
 use this competition 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:32.590
 34 minutes we are five or six times up 

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:34.920
 handful of the lost he is useful he is 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.920
 required 

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.250
 so turn it on 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:44.150
 are you well done thoma mediate 

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:48.230
 Outside of the foot 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:50.090
 also a good time to fail 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:50.750
 to close the first half at club 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.510
 bruges 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.640
 but on the stroke of rest by mamma mia 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.230
 but verulststraat good goal to keep 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.849
 half way 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.530
 change at the start of the second half 

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:02.000
 maybe a bit surprisingly crochet 

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:04.970
 by going out 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:08.239
 maybe not the least liora file or 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:10.189
 by then surely already met and you must 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.970
 take care of the ideas without him and 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:12.680
 victor vazquez 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:18.739
 so it's a bit of a rudder 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:21.799
 ship so far of that oil 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:25.410
 gets that ball just like lecturer 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.580
 into the bass and the polder 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.580
 no the washing accident 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:35.250
 he insisted 

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:35.250
 offside indeed of body oil 

00:04:37.249 --> 00:04:39.849
 cloud in here 

00:04:41.869 --> 00:04:48.199
 the file or are more of the ball 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:52.159
 who stop playing 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:56.209
 the shooter would equalize and heats up 

00:04:52.159 --> 00:04:58.069
 user on the hour to visit 

00:04:56.209 --> 00:05:00.919
 seventh 

00:04:58.069 --> 00:05:03.409
 it is true that more than half an hour was possible 

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.619
 to keep all of them at home 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.389
 the pressure seemed to be reduced so a ball 

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:10.789
 conquests then loss of the ball 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:13.219
 overmeire who dances or the player 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:14.869
 pass from cloud that is more suitable and 

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:17.899
 then both are 

00:05:14.869 --> 00:05:19.519
 but something as though through as it conceals 

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:21.789
 for the effort 

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:21.789
 one one 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:33.400
 did you get from jaws for traffic jams or 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:34.270
 is also growing the file or has one 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:35.800
 wide 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.800
 diddl city nice 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:41.020
 good rescue from davino 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:44.169
 how the beautiful ball of his foot 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:48.629
 jump to get the perfect out of it 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:48.629
 take the foil this was the best action 

00:05:49.259 --> 00:05:52.569
 must has been the last ten fifteen 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.379
 minutes no longer in danger 

00:05:52.569 --> 00:05:56.590
 been 

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:57.580
 Leader Brian dissolves around and he becomes 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.539
 at the line 

00:05:57.580 --> 00:06:02.440
 assisted there was almost the 

00:06:01.539 --> 00:06:06.190
 one two 

00:06:02.440 --> 00:06:08.259
 for locating winegums improperly 

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:11.280
 out is nikola storm who hit the ball for the 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:11.280
 line turns away 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.169
 do you know what he does make it grab it 

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.169
 almost with it 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:25.700
 that was close 

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:26.870
 Tomorrow was another catastrophic side there 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.270
 arrive 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:31.060
 malfunction web style nicolaas storms 

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:33.610
 moment 

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:37.260
 safely prevents two in the 

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:40.940
 injury time meanwhile another storm 

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:43.490
 cloud put it here 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.730
 just next to that it must have been 

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.730
 to be 

00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:52.580
 there is the final whistle 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:54.860
 happened has avoided the defeat 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.720
 but it is nice 10th draw on 

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.310
 here comes the losers one in six and 

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.000
 lokeren picks up a point from jan 

00:06:58.310 --> 00:07:01.010
 breydel 

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.370
 and on the whole it certainly isn't 

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:03.370
 stolen
