 Performance like many motorcycles 

00:00:27.089 --> 00:00:30.659
 the test center with thought that every improvement 

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:35.159
 Join this holiday day or that percent the wings just years here 

00:00:35.159 --> 00:00:40.890
 Organize as an impression gets like the other motorcycles 4 around tongues themselves 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.820
 Behavior means that each of these participants year has its own 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.359
 Motorcycle was from this test field and now of course has the 

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:50.730
 Possibility of her death is to drive each other's motorcycle 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.430
 "Yes we can" shares this test drive in Stuttgart are then about see

 that means we chill on me 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.479
 beautiful routes selected the way 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.119
 for example, his son was so important in a natural death 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.370
 how they turned when he was out there dark it went 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:16.320
 the individual drivers 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.970
 could drive forward could 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.690
 I think it's important that we already said before have the opportunity 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.740
 so drive on other motorcycles and the respective categories here 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.040
 Although presented are the different categories, we have a triumph 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.200
 Rocket out floor why the BBS learn from it 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.620
 Havel has 

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.690
 I was also crucial, but this story is percent we have 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:41.830
 trying not only to select the individual drivers of this category 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:45.670
 but we have also tried different groups speaking professional groups 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 interesting people from the world 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.550
 again and his threatening to give 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:55.590
 Wiegand all of these vehicles work or what the vehicles are 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.590
 give to respective persons 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.700

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:16.109
 the forward directly 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:19.650
 so I could be a second goalie with a friend like that 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.129
 Purchases because the story of what comes around 

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:29.189
