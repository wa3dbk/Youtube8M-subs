00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:17.800
 Of something 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.800
 we have it mounted on a base 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:20.880
 rotating 

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:27.490
 It is very functional 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.880
 then true because 

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:34.510
 is mounted on a base 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:37.210
 fixed round and here carries a whaling 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.200
 about which -accordingly then the 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:43.960
 induced can be moved to the next 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:50.460
 and at the same time also rode in two 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:50.460
 hairpins here to look at it at will 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.940
 the whole set that we have put together in 

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:57.039
 this work table 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.100
 this is one of the work tables that 

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:01.640
 here in my electro brakes workshop 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.950
 very functional 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.990
 because you can first of all after 

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.830
 tell it so you do not want me because it 's 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.830
 on wheels 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.579
 you can also by 

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:18.399
 this lever that you see here keep the 

00:01:14.579 --> 00:01:20.289
 description and the system is going down 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.630
 to take him up that 

00:01:20.289 --> 00:01:24.789
 need even when you are not going to ride 

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.770
 some heavy something a heavy engine 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.870
 lacrosse 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.760
 totally 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:33.830
 and then to work on it 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.830
 simply with this wait 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:43.909
 and mischief then you may need 

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.909
 It is a very functional work table 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:49.680
 of these connections 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.640
 of these 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.050
 of these platinum 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.640
 is united each one is united to one mile 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.670
 internally 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:04.810
 I removed a piece to show 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.050
 exactly the stage that enters by 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:12.869
 below and goes under the rings 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.869
 without making contact with them to 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:22.140
 and similarly to the engines we're going 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:25.290
 pulling out a portion of wire 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.970
 we put it inside the slot like this 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:30.800
 exactly the engines were moving 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:30.800
 also basic pri 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:10.810
 he organizes he is tapped with a 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.810
 hammer to give it the form 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.990
 here we place again 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:19.990
 the number of turns needed 

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:19.990
 we continue 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:31.030
 we are here too 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.360
 we saw the complete doors
