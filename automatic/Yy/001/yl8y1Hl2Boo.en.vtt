00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:03.780
 pinging seems to be the latest craze in mobile telephony 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.940
 Pinging is a cross between SMS and MSN 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:09.070
 the new means of communication responds to the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.730
 growing needs of young people to be in contact with anytime, anywhere 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:13.859
 their friends 

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:17.099
 many american celebrity they have been around for a while 

00:00:17.099 --> 00:00:19.999
 And now the phenomenon is also on the rise in the Netherlands 

00:00:19.999 --> 00:00:24.919
 2010 is expected to be the year that Kinin finally breaks through, he finds 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:27.050
 it's a whole life with it's saleh 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:29.699
 van is unfortunately being refused 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.699
 it is a nice plan one of his many applications 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:36.560
 now very quickly very well that after seven people go there 

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:40.970
 it is very nice because its all good to talk to when it works 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.810
 everyone with a blackberry smartphone has a clinic scoop 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.510
 if someone comes to know you can with your own device unlimited expert is the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.560
 control photos and sound 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.050
 such a message appears directly on the screen of others and just such a device 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.050
 shots with a distinctive design 

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:03.720
 but this yields the plotting and texting actually merged into one another 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.040
 and you are now going to do that on his cell phone 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.020
 so we used to share everything on your laptop online 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.390
 but not yet on your cell phone so you can now actually do with pinging 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:13.860
 to do 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.990
 so seems to set up and in the barracks but then on your cell phone that is so 

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:19.420
 roggel handed over 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.000
 and young people find that very attractive 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.960
 furthermore you can read the image and text you actually combine a kind 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.520
 and can also see services in between 

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.760
 and where someone else is and where you are that brings all kinds of benefits 

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.180
 and they actually entered the first convergence of computer and mobile telephony 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.060
 a thing 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.240
 that is really the strength of the team including telephone providers but you notice that 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.060
 Things are becoming increasingly popular we are constantly talking to ours 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.689
 customers 

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:50.229
 and those conversations show that pinging the new lives beneath a good one 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.150
 group of young people 

00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:54.760
 But you have people who want more and therefore precisely for this form of high speed 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.420
 people now too because we believe that communication should be as easy as possible 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:01:59.720
 to be 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.010
 touch cards to look and pin every day 

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.940
 so we have all taken a blackberry and to the world cup 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.439
 none at all it's a free and that's super fast 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:12.450
 its actually kind of very of especially the front street is in the 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:13.249
 cinema 

00:02:13.249 --> 00:02:14.359
 nice pinging 

00:02:14.359 --> 00:02:17.799
 and every day and much lower than fast 

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.060
 as yet you cannot get to know the general public 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.300
 however, it is expected that this will change in 2010
