00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:05.109

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:09.940
 the little girl especially the beautiful area 32 teams are so come 

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:11.929
 Ghosts aliens down 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:14.990
 and at the same time still fast most of them soldiers get that 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:17.269
 she had the phelps 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:18.869
 the power is that we 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.419
 practically inconspicuous in part are the adjust and so we can 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:25.150
 and some stuff over weaknesses Hal 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:29.970
 Let's start now is 32 and Sam Bird will inspire snowfall 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.190
 but that starts 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.390
 because now they come over high 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.800
 I'm not upset again and I hope I can do it 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.070
 because and if I am stupid 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.420
 q-cells understaffed 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240
 completely um 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.090
 the 4% first team here this is annoying 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.250
 the photo was shot 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.080
 Rockwell around 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.080
 and that changes quickly change again 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:06.460
 there is no one 

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.460
 and here come the 2 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.390
 I definitely have to 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.500
 be quick 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.490
 and one i think i'm pretty concrete when we start 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.490
 not as much 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:26.410
 Unterrainer is already quite mau again 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:30.120
 it has to be careful 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.700
 Schiller, for example, just went straight to the consumers 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:40.040
 and around 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.780
 I hate it in time 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.780

 Xing calculator 

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960
 and it would have been dangerously close 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.729
 the son or daughter Scottish 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.799

00:02:15.279 --> 00:02:18.279

 Romehome and romabed will come why it is not currently 

00:02:28.639 --> 00:02:31.639

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:45.379

 Source gather if this coverage and I already have 

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:22.819

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:34.779
 very satisfied as well 

00:04:34.779 --> 00:04:37.779

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.949

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:46.069
 already funny that I know great still where they are 

00:04:46.069 --> 00:04:47.620
 we have to 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.930
 they also protect them or ready meals transport them 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.930

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.180

00:05:38.099 --> 00:05:41.080
 the chase and also should be different

 Companies how long that takes 

00:06:26.869 --> 00:06:28.990

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.229
 wishes to the topic newspaper 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:34.229

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.319
 8 or leave 

00:06:37.319 --> 00:06:40.110
 For a while I just have trouble 

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:42.589
 Showers Obinna gathering and boys heard 

00:06:42.589 --> 00:06:44.389
 then learn 

00:06:44.389 --> 00:06:48.259
 I do the next part so the pursuit is practical 

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.550
 Machnig from it trade fair rounds back which is all better I have no idea 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:53.259
 how long it will take 

00:06:53.259 --> 00:06:56.949
 and if it's going to take a little longer or he's still listening well 

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:58.059
 and 

00:06:58.059 --> 00:07:00.889
 unusual sounds 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:03.889
 I come and how museums would have to go crazy about vegetables 

00:07:05.069 --> 00:07:08.069
 Try it out and forget about the robes 

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.210
 I will 

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.009
 that wants to stop now 

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:14.050
 and I am here 

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:16.110
 from a fighting game Schumer 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.389
 Topic it used to 

00:07:18.389 --> 00:07:22.120
 what was probably already wanted I was still remains that is just like that 

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:25.120
 a bit hectic and draped and messed up 

00:07:25.699 --> 00:07:26.819
 but well 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:28.419
 today like that 

00:07:28.419 --> 00:07:31.619
 the game is always the same pattern 

00:07:31.619 --> 00:07:34.050
 Berger 

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:37.119
 Do you still believe in crutches? 

00:07:37.119 --> 00:07:39.139
 a very good tournament 

00:07:39.139 --> 00:07:41.219
 and then the weather does it all 

00:07:41.219 --> 00:07:42.789
 and 

00:07:42.789 --> 00:07:45.360
 she is already standing here with her car 

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.619
 So people in the next video we continue here 

00:07:48.619 --> 00:07:51.040
 and then you protected your car 

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.020
 So especially in the video goodbye
