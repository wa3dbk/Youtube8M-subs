00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:17.860
 in gold and purple that I hope you 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.860
 like then let's start 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.380
 Pressure 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.880
 as a basis for the area 

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.660
 one 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:35.590
 I'm going to apply with mine this parador 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.590
 all the eyelid mobile 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.650
 and a little bit in the bottom 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:07.950
 now let's chop a little and I'm 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:10.460
 applying with 1 224 on our entire foot 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.570
 but we need this to be 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.570
 all around 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.560
 at the beginning 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.509
 and final so we will go covering 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.229
 that only the gold remains in the 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.229
 center 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:39.810
 Now I'm going to give some love now 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:44.690
 give me a little more or cover a little more 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.690
 here on the banks showing with him 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.330
 and a little more at the beginning 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.960
 here 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:22.940
 we mark a little more with the gold more 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:26.150
 intense 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:28.540
 I'm going to soften this purple a bit with 

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.540
 cork 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.500
 very light 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.500
 of the foot 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.370
 to highlight 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.670
 we will outline extends some 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.670
 silver 

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.910
 adelina well well our eyelid 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.020
 we had very good our for our 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:07.020
 calmed 

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:53.550
 and as a child my eye inside 

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.550
 and consumption of any black pencil 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:04.940
 so let's leave the eyes that look the 

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:06.770
 golden with very beautiful flight and going to 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.330
 add this exhibition but I think that 

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.370
 the good ones to the fine ones is going to add 

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:13.280
 a lot of mascara right now we go with our 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:17.410
 Stressful urbani base that I have left 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:19.540
 de sion in number 4 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:23.250
 and now let's paint with my life and 

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:23.250
 turn on original 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.360
 Now let's apply a little bit of 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.430
 makeup 

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:41.110
 phillips the fire 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:41.110
 to seal this makeup 

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:54.220
 and now let's do some of this 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:54.220
 knicks 

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.979
 number 2 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:00.210
 let's apply right where they give light 

00:04:58.979 --> 00:05:01.590
 of the sun 

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.110
 this is to see that all the 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.430
 degree eyes effect that is where 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:08.039
 comes to give us the light that is in the 

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:11.069
 front this is not going to be like outline is 

00:05:08.039 --> 00:05:13.729
 just like bronzer on the nose and on 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:13.729
 this zone 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:19.990
 it will light up our 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:34.990
 today about this is going to add a little 

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.990
 plus 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:38.570
 French optics 

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.870
 Y 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:45.870
 we do not determine backwards 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:53.280
 for my eyebrows I can do with cork 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.280
 as well 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:08.400
 let's add 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:08.400
 add a lot of rhyme stressing microblogs 

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:19.950
 and for the last one it can be a bit of 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:21.030
 step and books are from the books of 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:23.310
 El Secreto de Victoria 

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.410
 this is the backup boom that also 

00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:28.250
 they have a little golden sparkle 

00:06:25.410 --> 00:06:28.250
 direct 

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:38.320
 this is the finished one is a look at 

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.460
 purple with gold that looks super nice 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.750
 I hope you like it and put it in 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.750
 practice until everything 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.260
 always a little better the eye
