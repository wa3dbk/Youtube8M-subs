probably cut a strip about an inch long
I<00:00:41.629> would<00:00:42.629> go<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:43.260> long<00:00:43.860> ways<00:00:44.100> so<00:00:44.899> you<00:00:45.899> have<00:00:46.020> the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
I would go the long ways so you have the

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.490 
I would go the long ways so you have the
longest<00:00:46.469> possible<00:00:46.770> but<00:00:47.870> not<00:00:48.870> as<00:00:49.020> big<00:00:49.200> as<00:00:49.320> your

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
longest possible but not as big as your

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.119

index finger or whatever finger and

00:00:52.129 --> 00:00:55.910 
index finger or whatever finger and
you're<00:00:53.129> going<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.309> wrap<00:00:53.850> it<00:00:54.090> around<00:00:54.559> this<00:00:55.559> part

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:12.500 
also going to want to do is maybe about

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.790 
also going to want to do is maybe about
half<00:02:13.500> as<00:02:13.709> big<00:02:13.920> as<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.370> paper<00:02:14.610> is<00:02:15.320> and<00:02:16.320> by<00:02:16.770> the

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
half as big as the paper is and by the

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.900 
half as big as the paper is and by the
way<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.100> episode<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:17.490> going<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.640> be<00:02:17.700> quite

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
way this episode is going to be quite

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:20.060 
way this episode is going to be quite
short<00:02:18.410> pretty<00:02:19.410> much<00:02:19.530> just<00:02:19.650> going<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.860> want<00:02:20.010> to

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
short pretty much just going to want to

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:22.630 
short pretty much just going to want to
cut<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.340> paper<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.760> half<00:02:20.940> long<00:02:21.420> ways<00:02:21.450> though

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
cut the paper in half long ways though

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.570 
cut the paper in half long ways though
so<00:02:24.230> it's<00:02:25.230> good<00:02:25.380> enough<00:02:25.590> as<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.950> can<00:02:26.040> see<00:02:26.220> long

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
so it's good enough as you can see long

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.710 
so it's good enough as you can see long
ways<00:02:26.820> not<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.480> if<00:02:28.410> we<00:02:28.620> cut<00:02:28.830> it<00:02:28.950> like<00:02:29.720> like

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:30.720 
ways not like if we cut it like like

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.790 
ways not like if we cut it like like
this<00:02:31.020> way<00:02:31.340> if<00:02:32.340> it<00:02:32.520> was<00:02:32.580> like<00:02:32.850> this<00:02:33.720> we<00:02:34.590> didn't

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
this way if it was like this we didn't

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.479 
this way if it was like this we didn't
we<00:02:35.070> we<00:02:35.250> don't<00:02:35.520> we<00:02:35.940> don't<00:02:36.180> want<00:02:36.360> to<00:02:36.600> cut<00:02:36.780> it<00:02:37.489> this

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
we we don't we don't want to cut it this

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:41.420 
we we don't we don't want to cut it this
way<00:02:38.550> we<00:02:39.180> want<00:02:39.360> to<00:02:39.450> cut<00:02:39.600> long<00:02:39.840> ways<00:02:40.080> and<00:02:40.430> then

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
way we want to cut long ways and then

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.490 
way we want to cut long ways and then
