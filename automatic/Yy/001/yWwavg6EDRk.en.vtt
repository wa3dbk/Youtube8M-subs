00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:17.320
 greetings to all 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:21.619
 and today we have such an interesting one 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:24.800
 the device gets to unpack this mini 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.369
 Hessa 6 screws six motors 500 miles to 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.500
 1 battery here costs 6 system power 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.570
 stabilize so he will now unpack 

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.409
 and see what we have included 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:41.809
 and try to start this thing started 

00:00:36.409 --> 00:00:43.000
 so our mini lecture examine not x6 from 

00:00:41.809 --> 00:00:44.930
 firms art-p 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:55.729
 cool it opens more precisely 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:58.369
 opens now all the boxes bigger 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:00.619
 there's nothing here so interesting here 

00:00:58.369 --> 00:01:04.309
 pultik means we get right away 

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:09.890
 battery on 500 milliamps and we 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:14.990
 instruction packed usually instructions 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:20.030
 lying there in the box is not clear how we 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:23.510
 there are many useful things you can read there 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:25.790
 still hanging on the tape and zaryazochka 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.420
 charging immediately power outlet everywhere charging 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.420
 there is no 

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:35.960
 everything is tied up means I can also remind you 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.590
 do 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:47.610
 lip &amp; steve vai stabilization system 2 and 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.710
 4 gigahertz fell really not 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:02:07.310
 probably really fell off 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:07.310
 fell off so interesting little ball okay and 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:17.190
 forward rolling pin here is a couple more often 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:20.580
 plastic such plastic matte let's say 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:24.260
 so well, yes it is so open battery 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:28.140
 on income laughs we have food 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:31.020
 own bridge there all here probably 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.120
 The camera is probably not connected 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.620
 signed but I think the camera because that 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:39.620
 and there was a version with the camera given 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.620
 hexakopter 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:59.489
 still see spare 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:03:04.420
 6 pieces and correctly tray it will remove and 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:11.650
 really stick the speedy broken in half 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:18.599
 this is not removed is removed reached 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:18.599
 broken you can see how we approximate 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:24.489
 there broke in this place don't know about 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.890
 tanos in this place where there he could it 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:33.489
 do but generally without it 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:35.470
 I'll start like that so much so pen on them too 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:40.659
 canceled is the transition from fashion one 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.609
 module 2 is so trendy here 

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:48.459
 switch in short need instructions 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:52.590
 view is powered by four 

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:52.590
 finger batteries with us 

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.790
 supply 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:10.440
 They lived like a leaf insultingly insulting 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.030
 the process went some 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:18.550
 I learned right we look like it is muddy 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:21.330
 fashion 2 we turned on happily broken 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:25.600
 only stick it all works for us 

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:27.610
 strong then we have an expert by day 

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.750
 in here we switch here we could 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:33.760
 Immediately visible trimmers trimmers 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:37.510
 so well understood Trimmer to 

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.500
 on top of all the fashion lived key try 

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:40.500
 often run it 

00:04:51.949 --> 00:04:56.389
 with difficulties 

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:58.340
 need to get used so well, respectively, I 

00:04:56.389 --> 00:05:05.169
 I understand what we have in front of it for us 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:08.860
 all of their contact is before filing clean 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.860
 I feel it will be fun now 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:23.750
 something the equipment doesn't like my not 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:28.660
 I understand that the seal begins to cut down so 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:39.919
 why do you cut down the spell church number 2 

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:50.990
 find suffered incurred me like but here 

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:55.159
 this is byte I can not introduction not sawing 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:58.220
 check and immediately found the reason why he 

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:59.780
 something tupit I push that is 

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.539
 get out side of us goes left up 

00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:05.210
 press down to the right 

00:06:02.539 --> 00:06:07.610
 he doesn't go on show fashion one 

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:09.169
 switches shorter than some cant 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.960
 inside the remote probably need 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.690
 disassemble watch that's why me 

00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.699
 tupit and and I could not turn on it 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:17.210
 I will understand everything right 

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:22.630
 then 

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:25.849
 review a little later and about a miracle I defeated him 

00:06:22.630 --> 00:06:28.610
 Now there's this on the Pericles ie 

00:06:25.849 --> 00:06:30.050
 I now have fashion 2 and everything is clear 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.169
 works but grandfather's uniqueness and 

00:06:30.050 --> 00:06:35.419
 outdated and then everything is clear and now it is not 

00:06:33.169 --> 00:06:37.430
 automatically goes mod one what 

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:41.199
 I did watch the slideshow 

00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:44.479
 Well , firstly we disassemble our equipment 

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:46.340
 open this top cover this here 

00:06:44.479 --> 00:06:49.909
 stick sticking this is the culprit 

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:51.949
 our switch he stands over 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:54.620
 button here here we see 

00:06:51.949 --> 00:06:57.139
 a little button here 

00:06:54.620 --> 00:07:00.229
 a button is pressed here is that sticking out 

00:06:57.139 --> 00:07:02.659
 stick somehow goes happening 

00:07:00.229 --> 00:07:03.650
 So I re-stitched the button accordingly 

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.150
 took unsoldered 

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:09.230
 I just checked it 

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:12.260
 closure leads to the installation of mod 2 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:14.010
 Opening contact data is a fashion 1 

00:07:12.260 --> 00:07:16.560
 accordingly we entertained with 

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:20.220
 contact went into fashion one set 

00:07:16.560 --> 00:07:22.940
 there conductor roughly speaking and soldered and 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:25.110
 Now I have an eternal fashion 2 

00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:26.700
 accordingly, now I am in fashion one 

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.510
 never switch in my life 

00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:33.990
 only if from solder accordingly 

00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:34.980
 so we flip over here so and 

00:07:33.990 --> 00:07:36.750
 module 2 left 

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:41.280
 In short, no, I do not bother 

00:07:36.750 --> 00:07:43.080
 the main thing is that I worked at home fashion all 

00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:46.440
 so here is such a joint 

00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:48.480
 discovered which factory came don't know 

00:07:46.440 --> 00:07:50.160
 Why can you rate it so far with the remote control ? 

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:54.470
 Okay, I will continue to fly and test 

00:07:50.160 --> 00:07:54.470
 do a review before meeting
