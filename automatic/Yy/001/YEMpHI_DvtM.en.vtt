the<00:01:11.560> roundness<00:01:11.860> other<00:01:12.100> buttock<00:01:12.460> then<00:01:13.300> there's

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
the roundness other buttock then there's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.990 
the roundness other buttock then there's
a<00:01:13.570> group<00:01:13.900> who<00:01:14.470> is<00:01:14.860> maybe<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.280> older<00:01:15.700> and<00:01:15.850> has

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.000 
a group who is maybe the older and has

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.600 
a group who is maybe the older and has
more<00:01:16.240> laxity<00:01:16.870> of<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:16.990> skin<00:01:17.470> and<00:01:17.800> we<00:01:18.340> lean<00:01:18.580> a

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
more laxity of the skin and we lean a

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.270 
more laxity of the skin and we lean a
little<00:01:18.760> more<00:01:19.150> towards<00:01:19.890> procedures<00:01:20.890> which<00:01:21.100> are

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
little more towards procedures which are

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:23.640 
little more towards procedures which are
lifting<00:01:21.850> the<00:01:21.970> buttock<00:01:22.300> and<00:01:22.450> also<00:01:23.290> maybe

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:23.650 
lifting the buttock and also maybe

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:26.070 
lifting the buttock and also maybe
adding<00:01:24.190> some<00:01:24.370> volume<00:01:24.700> in<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:25.420> couple<00:01:25.960> different

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.080 
adding some volume in a couple different

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:28.680 
adding some volume in a couple different
ways<00:01:26.410> as<00:01:26.680> well<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.850> Brazilian<00:01:28.450> butt<00:01:28.660> lift

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:28.690 
ways as well the Brazilian butt lift

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:30.540 
ways as well the Brazilian butt lift
which<00:01:29.140> is<00:01:29.290> the<00:01:29.440> classical<00:01:29.980> procedure<00:01:30.310> here

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:30.550 
which is the classical procedure here

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.780 
which is the classical procedure here
most<00:01:30.790> about<00:01:31.120> is<00:01:31.540> a<00:01:31.630> combination<00:01:32.280> we're<00:01:33.280> number

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 
most about is a combination we're number

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.720 
most about is a combination we're number
one<00:01:34.090> you're<00:01:34.420> reducing<00:01:35.410> fat<00:01:35.710> in<00:01:36.010> the<00:01:36.160> periphery

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
one you're reducing fat in the periphery

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.750 
one you're reducing fat in the periphery
of<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.030> buttock<00:01:37.330> area<00:01:37.540> but<00:01:38.110> to<00:01:38.710> recontra<00:01:39.610> the

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:39.760 
of the buttock area but to recontra the

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:41.640 
of the buttock area but to recontra the
area<00:01:40.060> and<00:01:40.180> then<00:01:40.390> you<00:01:40.510> can<00:01:40.720> save<00:01:40.990> that<00:01:41.230> fast

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:41.650 
area and then you can save that fast

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.130 
area and then you can save that fast
andrey<00:01:42.220> concentrate<00:01:42.940> it<00:01:43.120> in<00:01:43.270> a<00:01:43.630> special<00:01:43.810> way

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:44.140 
andrey concentrate it in a special way

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.530 
andrey concentrate it in a special way
and<00:01:44.410> then<00:01:44.980> reintroduce<00:01:45.610> and<00:01:45.850> re-inject<00:01:46.120> it

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:46.540 
and then reintroduce and re-inject it

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.260 
and then reintroduce and re-inject it
into<00:01:46.660> the<00:01:46.990> central<00:01:47.470> buttock<00:01:47.800> area<00:01:48.010> to<00:01:48.640> augment

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
into the central buttock area to augment

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.390 
into the central buttock area to augment
and<00:01:49.420> lift<00:01:49.750> and<00:01:49.960> round<00:01:50.800> out<00:01:50.980> and<00:01:51.130> fill<00:01:51.250> out<00:01:51.370> the

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:51.400 
and lift and round out and fill out the

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.000 
and lift and round out and fill out the
buttock<00:01:51.760> it's<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.300> nice<00:01:52.420> procedure<00:01:52.900> it's<00:01:53.710> done

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
buttock it's a nice procedure it's done

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.060 
buttock it's a nice procedure it's done
as<00:01:54.340> an<00:01:54.490> outpatient<00:01:55.240> and<00:01:55.560> minimal<00:01:56.560> incisions

as an outpatient and minimal incisions

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.080 
as an outpatient and minimal incisions
and<00:01:57.340> a<00:01:57.760> pretty<00:01:58.060> easy<00:01:58.240> recovery<00:01:59.190> because<00:02:00.190> it's

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.090 
and a pretty easy recovery because it's

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:04.170 
and a pretty easy recovery because it's
minimally<00:02:01.720> invasive<00:02:02.520> what<00:02:03.520> are<00:02:03.640> some<00:02:03.909> of<00:02:04.060> the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
minimally invasive what are some of the

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:07.590

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
characteristics of the second group the

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.570 
characteristics of the second group the
other<00:02:07.750> group<00:02:07.960> of<00:02:08.140> patients<00:02:08.319> has<00:02:08.739> more<00:02:09.009> laxity

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
other group of patients has more laxity

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.030 
other group of patients has more laxity
in<00:02:09.610> their<00:02:09.759> buttock<00:02:10.119> and<00:02:10.239> it's<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.470> much<00:02:11.650> bigger

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:12.040 
in their buttock and it's a much bigger

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:14.160 
in their buttock and it's a much bigger
procedure<00:02:12.340> it<00:02:12.849> involves<00:02:13.269> larger<00:02:13.629> incisions

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
procedure it involves larger incisions

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.289 
procedure it involves larger incisions
but<00:02:14.920> it's<00:02:15.069> very<00:02:15.159> effective<00:02:15.700> in<00:02:15.819> improving<00:02:15.939> the

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
but it's very effective in improving the

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:17.660 
but it's very effective in improving the
buttock<00:02:16.540> instead<00:02:16.870> of

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
buttock instead of

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.460

the<00:02:17.880> bud<00:02:18.060> up<00:02:18.270> like<00:02:18.569> a<00:02:18.599> Brazilian<00:02:19.230> butt<00:02:19.410> lift

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
the bud up like a Brazilian butt lift

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.830 
the bud up like a Brazilian butt lift
you're<00:02:19.890> actually<00:02:20.099> pulling<00:02:20.700> it<00:02:20.910> up<00:02:21.030> so<00:02:21.599> tissue

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
you're actually pulling it up so tissue

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.290 
you're actually pulling it up so tissue
is<00:02:22.110> removed<00:02:22.260> above<00:02:22.950> the<00:02:23.099> buttock<00:02:23.370> area<00:02:23.520> it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
is removed above the buttock area it

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
little bit as well so we can sometimes

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.500 
little bit as well so we can sometimes

is introduced into a higher level which

is introduced into a higher level which
is<00:02:32.459> rounder<00:02:32.910> and<00:02:32.940> floor<00:02:34.130> what<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.400> an<00:02:35.760> auto

augmentation<00:02:36.840> in<00:02:37.640> some<00:02:38.640> patients<00:02:38.940> instead<00:02:39.450> of

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
augmentation in some patients instead of

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:42.080

just removing the upper buttock tissue

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.509 
just removing the upper buttock tissue
we<00:02:42.870> can<00:02:43.080> retain<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> as<00:02:43.769> what's<00:02:43.980> called<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.280> flat

we can retain it as what's called a flat

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:46.699 
we can retain it as what's called a flat
but<00:02:44.760> we<00:02:44.880> can<00:02:45.060> rotate<00:02:45.540> that<00:02:45.780> tissue<00:02:46.080> down<00:02:46.440> into

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:46.709 
but we can rotate that tissue down into

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.770 
but we can rotate that tissue down into
the<00:02:46.830> buttock<00:02:47.160> but<00:02:47.670> as<00:02:47.790> we<00:02:47.910> pull<00:02:48.239> the<00:02:48.450> skin<00:02:48.660> up

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
the buttock but as we pull the skin up

the buttock but as we pull the skin up
over<00:02:49.050> the<00:02:49.140> top<00:02:49.319> we<00:02:49.560> can<00:02:49.680> be<00:02:50.010> fat<00:02:50.220> tissue<00:02:50.430> down

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
over the top we can be fat tissue down

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.059 
over the top we can be fat tissue down
lower<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.209> rat<00:02:51.420> out<00:02:51.450> details<00:02:52.019> about<00:02:52.260> it<00:02:52.410> I<00:02:52.590> call

and<00:02:58.350> the<00:02:58.470> auto<00:02:58.680> augmentation<00:02:59.160> because<00:02:59.880> we're

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
and the auto augmentation because we're

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.570 
and the auto augmentation because we're
using<00:03:00.269> only<00:03:00.690> your<00:03:00.870> own<00:03:01.110> tissue<00:03:01.410> very<00:03:02.250> safe

implants<00:03:13.440> placed<00:03:13.769> it's<00:03:14.519> not<00:03:14.790> a<00:03:14.819> procedure<00:03:15.299> I'm

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 
implants placed it's not a procedure I'm

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:18.559 
implants placed it's not a procedure I'm
really<00:03:15.989> crazy<00:03:16.290> about<00:03:16.610> because<00:03:17.610> the<00:03:18.150> quality

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
really crazy about because the quality

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.330 
really crazy about because the quality
of<00:03:18.840> implant<00:03:19.350> we<00:03:19.500> have<00:03:19.650> available<00:03:19.890> here<00:03:20.190> in
