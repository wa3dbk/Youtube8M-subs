00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
anything she makes I still don't

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.960 
anything she makes I still don't
understand<00:01:38.710> that<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.100> put<00:01:39.430> my<00:01:39.520> finger<00:01:39.790> right<00:01:39.820> in

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.970 
understand that I put my finger right in

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.340 
understand that I put my finger right in
there<00:01:41.550> definitely<00:01:42.550> needs<00:01:42.820> salt<00:01:43.240> but<00:01:44.140> it's<00:01:44.260> a

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
there definitely needs salt but it's a

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.830 
there definitely needs salt but it's a
good<00:01:44.470> consistency<00:01:44.800> so<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.760> scrape<00:01:46.630> down<00:01:46.780> the

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:46.840 
good consistency so I scrape down the

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:48.810 
good consistency so I scrape down the
sides<00:01:46.960> and<00:01:47.470> it<00:01:47.770> needs<00:01:47.950> quite<00:01:48.190> a<00:01:48.220> bit<00:01:48.310> of<00:01:48.520> salt

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:48.820 
sides and it needs quite a bit of salt

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:51.660 
sides and it needs quite a bit of salt
whenever<00:01:49.750> I<00:01:49.840> do<00:01:49.930> two<00:01:50.260> cans<00:01:50.590> I'm<00:01:51.190> usually<00:01:51.460> doing

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
whenever I do two cans I'm usually doing

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.090 
whenever I do two cans I'm usually doing
one<00:01:52.119> I<00:01:52.390> kind<00:01:52.930> of<00:01:52.990> always<00:01:53.170> underestimate<00:01:53.890> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
one I kind of always underestimate the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.560 
one I kind of always underestimate the
amount<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.310> olive<00:01:54.490> oil<00:01:54.729> it<00:01:54.940> needs<00:01:55.150> and<00:01:55.420> mount

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
amount of olive oil it needs and mount

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.109 
amount of olive oil it needs and mount
of<00:01:55.660> salt<00:01:56.130> so<00:01:57.130> we're<00:01:57.280> going<00:01:57.340> to<00:01:57.460> process<00:01:57.850> again

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
of salt so we're going to process again

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:02.370 
of salt so we're going to process again
and<00:01:58.510> processes<00:01:59.440> again<00:01:59.680> real<00:01:59.860> quick<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
and processes again real quick it's

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:04.230 
and processes again real quick it's
