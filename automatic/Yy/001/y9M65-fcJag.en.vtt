00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:18.580
 where youtube helps us your friend 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.070
 AdriÃ¡n and this time we will analyze 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.510
 a very interesting application which 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.600
 It is completely free in the 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.820
 marketplace that is with times that we 

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.400
 will be useful to download some 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.110
 Such topics and others do not but that right now 

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.660
 I'll explain, remember, it 's 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.930
 totally free there is another version that 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.379
 I hope or that it is complete and that 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 contains more options not good there are 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:44.160
 open it first 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.780
 it takes a little 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.510
 let's wait, there they are or how they see 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.240
 I have already downloaded two issues of halo 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.620
 and this is not very good metro but you have to 

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.970
 see a little more the interface 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:09.450
 this is where we are going to be able to download 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:12.570
 the themes in dunlop themes create themes 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:15.119
 We will not create issues so very Now 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.759
 that very good but they will be 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.159
 functional and they will look great in 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.950
 our phone does not create the time or 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.110
 the squares these we want these from 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.360
 here these squares we will be able to 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.539
 create not the color we want and everything 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.090
 not the app review part in 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:36.030
 other side we rate it and all that in the 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.810
 marketplace contacts and a wood quit 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.959
 you are not very well we are going to download a 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.400
 theme for you to see not all 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:49.000
 themes will be compatible 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:52.060
 as you will know it is the free version and not 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.220
 contains many of the options very well 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:57.970
 but here I will show you how 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:59.680
 download one a subject here already marks me 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:02.650
 the popcorn because this already unloads it 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.010
 very well we are going to this for example from 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.010
 spider-man 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.080
 here a subject appears we give it 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.720
 in sweet 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:18.020
 and this signage appears 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:20.390
 this is the signage will appear 

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.850
 because we do not have the full version and 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.400
 This theme can not be downloaded without 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:28.970
 have this version without having it activated 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:31.310
 very well then we have to go back 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:34.450
 you have to go checking what topics 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.560
 are possible to download and compatible not 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:38.360
 This application is compatible with 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.200
 any phone that has windows 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:45.200
 phones 7.88 very well now we must see 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.260
 about the issues and all that he wants 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.420
 let's try better 1 and 11 of milestone and 1 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.420
 subway very well 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:01.690
 we wait for him to load 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:04.230
 and here we choose the workshop as 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.310
 come here there are many images as type 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.850
 puzzle and this we put 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.850
 any 

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.030
 here we will look like we can 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:19.180
 change the icon 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:22.299
 the color what is going to say here 

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:24.599
 everything we want the 

00:03:22.299 --> 00:03:24.599
 animation 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:31.930
 everything involves us we are going to put 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.300
 any icon in this case I'm going 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:39.650
 to occupy for messages I put you yes 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.650
 what are we going to change 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.459
 messages 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.060
 we are going to put in save 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.130
 and all those that we believe or that 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:02.680
 let say 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:05.400
 save is going to be put here not in this 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:05.400
 case is here 

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.540
 is this one here 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:12.850
 and we're going to give you anchor to start 

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.350
 pin to start to remember that 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:18.170
 shows on our home screen 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:19.530
 once done that we will see that here 

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:23.989
 is 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.989
 and it is fully functional not 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.730
 we can put you google mail 

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:33.190
 facebook the logo that we and we 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.130
 is going to open that application now you have to 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.480
 try with the other not the other issue that 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.220
 unload 

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:41.220
 ok let's go to the other 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.380
 this application is very good which we 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:50.070
 allows customize 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.810
 there are not many of these applications and 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.810
 I recommend them not completely 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:05:00.220
 we are going to put us right now here 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.380
 are going to come out the different we can 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:04.760
 put in this case I'm going to choose the 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:07.300
 of the camera 

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.930
 we give to that 

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:12.490
 and we give in anchor and started has the 

00:05:10.930 --> 00:05:14.379
 same function 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:17.050
 we can change you remember 

00:05:14.379 --> 00:05:19.420
 remember that if in this case I have 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:22.120
 the gray subject as you see 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:24.960
 and we here appear green 

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.440
 we can change the animation 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.920
 the logo 

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:33.310
 the letters that go here 

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:34.420
 the background color and many more things already 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:36.910
 it's a matter of you going 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:38.740
 checking nothing I give them the name and a 

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:41.140
 small revised of the application 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.150
 we give you here and it works 

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:46.569
 equally that the original works 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:48.550
 the one that comes with the phone and see 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:51.819
 very interesting this application the 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.610
 it's really good I think it's already clear your doubts 

00:05:51.819 --> 00:05:57.610
 I hope you have liked to subscribe to 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:59.729
