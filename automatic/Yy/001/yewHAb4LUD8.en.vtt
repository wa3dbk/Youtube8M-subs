00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
a hole out there and above it and you

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.740 
a hole out there and above it and you
can<00:00:49.739> easily<00:00:49.860> open<00:00:50.370> the<00:00:50.489> chest<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.030> see<00:00:51.360> I've

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
can easily open the chest and see I've

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.569

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
and then all all you need to close it is

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.569 
and then all all you need to close it is
just<00:00:56.699> seal<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.449> back<00:00:57.570> up<00:00:57.719> with<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.079> block<00:00:58.579> it

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
just seal it back up with the block it

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:06.950 
just seal it back up with the block it
doesn't<00:00:59.940> take<00:01:00.059> too<00:01:00.090> long<00:01:04.610> ok<00:01:05.610> now<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.570> second

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
doesn't take too long ok now the second

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.920 
doesn't take too long ok now the second
hiding<00:01:07.260> spots<00:01:07.530> to<00:01:07.770> put<00:01:07.950> your<00:01:08.100> chest<00:01:08.340> are<00:01:08.930> you

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
probably wouldn't really guess it that

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.429 
probably wouldn't really guess it that
much<00:01:11.640> but<00:01:11.880> you<00:01:12.240> think<00:01:12.600> their<00:01:12.810> beds<00:01:13.080> used<00:01:13.290> for

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439

one is you can put it anywhere but I
decided<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.799> put<00:01:52.979> it<00:01:53.100> straight<00:01:53.280> ahead<00:01:53.490> from

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
decided to put it straight ahead from

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.510 
decided to put it straight ahead from
the<00:01:53.939> entrance<00:01:54.240> so<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.600> just<00:01:54.899> go<00:01:55.049> in<00:01:55.399> dig<00:01:56.399> out

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
the entrance so you just go in dig out

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.149 
the entrance so you just go in dig out
the<00:01:56.670> hole<00:01:56.820> I've<00:01:57.750> got<00:01:58.049> covered<00:01:58.619> up<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> bit<00:01:58.979> and

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
the hole I've got covered up a bit and

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.639 
the hole I've got covered up a bit and
that's<00:01:59.820> my<00:01:59.969> home<00:02:02.869> so<00:02:03.869> at<00:02:03.930> the<00:02:04.110> end<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.350> just<00:02:04.530> have

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
that's my home so at the end I just have

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.830 
that's my home so at the end I just have
some<00:02:04.799> water<00:02:04.829> and<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.240> don't<00:02:06.420> really<00:02:06.689> know

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
some water and you don't really know

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.600 
some water and you don't really know
that's<00:02:07.140> there<00:02:07.500> but<00:02:07.680> you<00:02:07.950> can<00:02:08.129> see<00:02:08.340> it<00:02:08.459> and

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
that's there but you can see it and

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.660 
that's there but you can see it and
that's<00:02:09.060> what<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.330> chest<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.780> water<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
that's what the chest in the water and

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
that's what the chest in the water and
they<00:02:11.670> are<00:02:11.819> pretty<00:02:12.090> easy<00:02:12.209> to<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.599> but<00:02:12.870> it's<00:02:13.200> a

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
they are pretty easy to see but it's a

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.470 
they are pretty easy to see but it's a
good

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
good

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.869 
good
spot<00:02:13.720> if<00:02:13.840> no<00:02:14.170> one<00:02:14.319> knows<00:02:14.349> exactly<00:02:14.760> that<00:02:15.760> you've

00:02:15.869 --> 00:02:15.879 
spot if no one knows exactly that you've

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:22.979 
spot if no one knows exactly that you've
got<00:02:16.060> a<00:02:16.379> secret<00:02:17.379> passage<00:02:17.709> there<00:02:20.250> anyway<00:02:21.250> so<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
got a secret passage there anyway so the

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.070 
got a secret passage there anyway so the
best<00:02:23.170> idea<00:02:23.590> for<00:02:23.700> making<00:02:24.700> on<00:02:25.150> places<00:02:25.930> for

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
best idea for making on places for

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.509 
best idea for making on places for
chests<00:02:26.470> are<00:02:26.590> probably<00:02:26.890> just<00:02:27.069> to<00:02:27.220> make<00:02:27.370> it

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:27.519 
chests are probably just to make it

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:30.539 
chests are probably just to make it
creative<00:02:27.760> and<00:02:28.299> hard<00:02:29.260> the<00:02:29.440> spots<00:02:29.769> I'll<00:02:30.310> just

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
creative and hard the spots I'll just

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.520 
creative and hard the spots I'll just
seal<00:02:30.849> it<00:02:30.879> back<00:02:31.000> up<00:02:31.299> and<00:02:33.480> now<00:02:34.480> probably<00:02:35.200> come

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
seal it back up and now probably come

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.619 
seal it back up and now probably come
one<00:02:35.680> really<00:02:35.950> knows<00:02:36.099> where<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.459> is<00:02:36.549> so<00:02:37.480> you<00:02:37.540> just

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
one really knows where it is so you just

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:41.369 
one really knows where it is so you just
go<00:02:37.930> out<00:02:38.110> and<00:02:39.480> probably<00:02:40.480> for<00:02:40.569> the<00:02:40.750> best<00:02:41.110> way<00:02:41.319> to

00:02:41.369 --> 00:02:41.379 
go out and probably for the best way to

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:43.140 
go out and probably for the best way to
hide<00:02:41.829> it<00:02:42.069> is<00:02:42.190> just<00:02:42.459> get<00:02:42.730> rid<00:02:42.819> of<00:02:42.909> all<00:02:43.000> the

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
hide it is just get rid of all the

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.140 
hide it is just get rid of all the
torches<00:02:43.629> on<00:02:44.379> do<00:02:44.620> no<00:02:45.280> need<00:02:45.519> to<00:02:45.610> do<00:02:45.730> that<00:02:45.760> but<00:02:46.090> you

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
torches on do no need to do that but you

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.410 
torches on do no need to do that but you
can<00:02:46.709> it's<00:02:47.709> just<00:02:47.890> easier<00:02:48.280> so<00:02:48.790> no<00:02:49.000> one<00:02:49.150> knows

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
can it's just easier so no one knows

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:53.809 
can it's just easier so no one knows
it's<00:02:49.599> there<00:02:49.840> I'm<00:02:50.799> just<00:02:50.980> um<00:02:51.220> it's<00:02:51.849> back<00:02:52.030> here
