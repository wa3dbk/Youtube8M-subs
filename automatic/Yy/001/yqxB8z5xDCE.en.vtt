the playa which is this funky trick

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.980 
the playa which is this funky trick
which<00:00:25.920> it<00:00:26.099> really<00:00:26.369> is<00:00:26.490> alternating<00:00:26.990> which

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
which it really is alternating which

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.080 
which it really is alternating which
hand<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.380> doing<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.680> top<00:00:28.920> salt<00:00:29.279> in<00:00:29.460> which<00:00:29.789> hand

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
hand is doing a top salt in which hand

hand is doing a top salt in which hand
is<00:00:30.269> doing<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.630> pendulum<00:00:31.019> so<00:00:31.560> if<00:00:31.710> you're<00:00:31.830> on<00:00:31.949> the

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980 
is doing a pendulum so if you're on the

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.620 
is doing a pendulum so if you're on the
left<00:00:32.219> side<00:00:32.430> you<00:00:33.149> left<00:00:33.300> hand<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.600> doing

pendulum if you're on the right site
grant<00:00:35.579> head<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.850> doing<00:00:36.090> pendulum<00:00:36.510> and<00:00:37.260> your

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
grant head is doing pendulum and your

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:42.440 
grant head is doing pendulum and your
other<00:00:37.590> hand<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.670> doing<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:38.969> Tom<00:00:39.149> stall<00:00:39.450> yes<00:00:41.450> so

other hand is doing a Tom stall yes so

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.600 
other hand is doing a Tom stall yes so
as<00:00:42.809> I<00:00:43.110> was<00:00:43.140> in<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.379> Reno<00:00:43.559> Airport<00:00:43.800> and<00:00:44.309> playing

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
as I was in the Reno Airport and playing

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.270 
as I was in the Reno Airport and playing
with<00:00:44.760> this<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.180> realized<00:00:45.890> that<00:00:46.890> you<00:00:47.039> could<00:00:47.219> use

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
with this I realized that you could use

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.880 
with this I realized that you could use
it<00:00:47.489> to<00:00:47.850> go<00:00:48.090> back<00:00:48.120> and<00:00:48.420> forth<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.200> these

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
it to go back and forth out of these

00:00:49.890 --> 00:01:05.760 
it to go back and forth out of these
standards<00:00:50.399> dulces<00:00:50.930> like<00:00:51.930> so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:05.770 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.529 

as<00:01:06.280> I<00:01:06.490> started<00:01:06.729> coming<00:01:06.850> around<00:01:07.090> with<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:07.390> in

00:01:07.529 --> 00:01:07.539 
as I started coming around with this in

00:01:07.539 --> 00:01:11.459 
as I started coming around with this in
bulk<00:01:07.780> in<00:01:07.899> town<00:01:08.909> we<00:01:09.909> started<00:01:10.659> adding<00:01:10.960> all<00:01:11.079> kinds

00:01:11.459 --> 00:01:11.469 
bulk in town we started adding all kinds

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:14.190 
bulk in town we started adding all kinds
of<00:01:11.560> other<00:01:11.649> fun<00:01:11.950> stuff<00:01:11.979> to<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.899> never<00:01:13.899> I'll<00:01:13.990> put

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
of other fun stuff to it never I'll put

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.859 
of other fun stuff to it never I'll put
together<00:01:14.350> that<00:01:14.860> you<00:01:15.070> could<00:01:15.479> stick<00:01:16.479> and<00:01:16.750> I

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
together that you could stick and I

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:21.800 
together that you could stick and I
salute<00:01:17.079> pendulum<00:01:17.770> on<00:01:18.610> either<00:01:18.880> side<00:01:19.210> and

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.719 

change<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:23.020> orientation<00:01:23.170> of<00:01:23.979> the<00:01:24.280> point

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:24.729 
change the orientation of the point

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.809 
change the orientation of the point
hands<00:01:25.060> back<00:01:25.299> towards<00:01:25.509> each<00:01:25.719> other<00:01:25.869> right<00:01:26.819> like

00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:27.819 
hands back towards each other right like

00:01:27.819 --> 00:01:39.380 
hands back towards each other right like
so

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.500 

we<00:01:39.930> also<00:01:40.080> realize<00:01:40.760> that<00:01:41.760> you<00:01:41.880> could<00:01:42.090> use<00:01:42.270> this

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.510 
we also realize that you could use this

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.660 
we also realize that you could use this
as<00:01:42.960> a<00:01:43.170> transition<00:01:43.830> for<00:01:44.010> getting<00:01:44.220> across<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
as a transition for getting across the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.790 
as a transition for getting across the
top<00:01:44.880> as<00:01:45.150> that<00:01:45.810> you're<00:01:45.900> treating<00:01:46.229> it<00:01:46.320> like<00:01:46.530> a

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:46.800 
top as that you're treating it like a

00:01:46.800 --> 00:02:11.470 
top as that you're treating it like a
mountain<00:01:47.190> right

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.500 

then<00:02:12.110> we<00:02:12.230> started<00:02:12.470> playing<00:02:12.650> around<00:02:12.800> floats

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 
then we started playing around floats

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.630 
then we started playing around floats
namely<00:02:14.739> you<00:02:15.739> can

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.360 

rather<00:02:20.330> than<00:02:20.750> just<00:02:21.500> straight<00:02:21.830> up<00:02:21.860> doing<00:02:22.250> a

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370 
rather than just straight up doing a

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.220 
rather than just straight up doing a
nice<00:02:22.580> little<00:02:22.790> pendulum<00:02:23.360> in<00:02:23.569> the<00:02:23.630> middle<00:02:24.080> to

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
nice little pendulum in the middle to

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:26.860 
nice little pendulum in the middle to
change<00:02:24.470> the<00:02:24.620> orientation<00:02:24.770> employ<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:26.690> can

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
change the orientation employ you can

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:47.780 
change the orientation employ you can
instead<00:02:27.850> drop<00:02:28.850> on<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.270> float<00:02:29.569> up<00:02:30.010> like<00:02:31.010> so

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:47.790 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.699 

to<00:02:48.420> which<00:02:48.569> we<00:02:48.719> also<00:02:48.870> had<00:02:49.110> a<00:02:49.140> new<00:02:49.319> variant

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:49.709 
to which we also had a new variant

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.830 
to which we also had a new variant
wherein<00:02:50.159> you<00:02:50.909> can<00:02:50.939> drop<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.750> floats<00:02:52.079> on<00:02:53.840> both

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
wherein you can drop the floats on both

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.440 
wherein you can drop the floats on both
the<00:02:55.500> contact<00:02:56.040> with<00:02:56.219> boy<00:02:56.400> heads<00:02:56.670> and<00:02:56.939> the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
the contact with boy heads and the

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:11.309 
the contact with boy heads and the
contact<00:02:57.930> of<00:02:58.079> hands

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:14.990 

like<00:03:11.920> so

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.220 

finally<00:03:16.000> we<00:03:16.330> serve<00:03:16.600> playing<00:03:16.870> around<00:03:17.080> with

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
finally we serve playing around with

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.420 
finally we serve playing around with
plain<00:03:17.560> beds<00:03:17.830> off<00:03:18.070> of<00:03:18.220> it<00:03:18.690> the<00:03:19.690> first<00:03:19.930> one<00:03:20.170> is<00:03:20.430> a

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:21.430 
plain beds off of it the first one is a

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.050 
plain beds off of it the first one is a
variant<00:03:21.850> on<00:03:22.290> the<00:03:23.290> G<00:03:23.890> style<00:03:24.220> asterisk<00:03:24.730> clean

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:25.060 
variant on the G style asterisk clean

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.060 
variant on the G style asterisk clean
bed<00:03:25.270> where<00:03:26.170> n<00:03:28.380> where<00:03:29.380> it<00:03:29.470> wants<00:03:29.680> you<00:03:29.770> in<00:03:29.860> the

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
bed where n where it wants you in the

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.050 
bed where n where it wants you in the
middle<00:03:30.270> you<00:03:31.270> switch<00:03:31.690> it<00:03:31.720> around<00:03:31.900> like<00:03:32.230> so<00:03:32.560> into

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
middle you switch it around like so into

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:37.670 
middle you switch it around like so into
horizontal<00:03:34.060> plane

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:51.980 

Mike<00:03:38.310> said<00:03:38.670> all<00:03:38.760> right

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:51.990 

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.820 

which<00:03:52.560> I<00:03:52.680> suppose<00:03:52.710> you<00:03:53.040> can<00:03:53.190> also<00:03:53.310> get<00:03:53.580> into

00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:54.830 
which I suppose you can also get into

00:03:54.830 --> 00:04:08.360 
which I suppose you can also get into
battle<00:03:55.830> float<00:03:56.780> or<00:03:57.780> the<00:03:57.960> isolate<00:03:58.320> pension

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.210

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:12.220 
anyways last but not least we did a

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:14.580 
anyways last but not least we did a
variant<00:04:12.730> where<00:04:12.910> in<00:04:13.150> keep<00:04:13.600> it<00:04:13.720> low<00:04:13.780> and<00:04:14.170> keep

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
variant where in keep it low and keep

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:21.509 
variant where in keep it low and keep
the<00:04:14.740> poor<00:04:14.980> short<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.700> can<00:04:19.030> use<00:04:19.330> a<00:04:19.360> buzzsaw<00:04:20.519> to

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
the poor short you can use a buzzsaw to

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:28.500 
the poor short you can use a buzzsaw to
transition<00:04:22.090> across
