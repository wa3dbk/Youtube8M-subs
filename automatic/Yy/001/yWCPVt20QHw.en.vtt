without changing the team's bounds too
much<00:03:40.230> I<00:03:40.500> expected<00:03:41.190> a<00:03:41.340> lot<00:03:41.700> more<00:03:41.760> from<00:03:42.210> Blair<00:03:42.480> of

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:46.350 
this caliber and this price however he

00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:49.130 
this caliber and this price however he
did<00:03:46.530> score<00:03:46.680> a<00:03:46.860> few<00:03:47.100> goals<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.790> have<00:03:48.630> some<00:03:48.930> nice

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:49.140
