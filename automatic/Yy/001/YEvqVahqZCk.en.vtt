00:00:05.140 --> 00:00:13.820
 jia is now hello today 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:16.460
 we are exhausted if auvergne with the 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.560
 snails to have done so have his 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:21.039
 exploitation 

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.039
 the story from one goal to another 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.579
 little lesson on the harbor of the snail 

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.739
 the burgundy snail unlike 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.329
 his name does not necessarily come from 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.399
 the Burgundy region is the name of the 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:51.260
 breed of lescar so the snail day on 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.930
 found everywhere in France everywhere 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.360
 the world and as it was picked up 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.010
 way a little bit abusive one in 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.839
 find less and less in France 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.789
 so all snails of burgundy 

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:04.879
 we will find in the trade are 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.590
 often pick up and import 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:08.240
 country is it is necessary to know that the snail 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.860
 of burgundy does not rise they do not 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:11.509
 do not support captivity every 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.700
 snail breeders pupils either from 

00:01:11.509 --> 00:01:15.080
 group b like the caring little guy 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.909
 there we have some of our most 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:19.100
 beautiful specimens so-called 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:20.810
 breeding snails then we know 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.819
 a snail producers because the 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.979
 edge of the shell is edged this is at 

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:26.569
 to say that it is slightly curved like 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:27.590
 a gutter the snail is 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:30.590
 hermaphrodite 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:32.810
 that is, all snails are 

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.970
 wrong they will mate will get put 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.700
 by two vents both become 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.340
 females in the snail masts 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:42.500
 lay her eggs in the ground so we 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.509
 will add in this box a box 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.520
 with earth the wood that is ready 

00:01:44.509 --> 00:01:48.409
 breakthrough to make the job easier is to 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.329
 the snail or the scammer has simply 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:53.570
 when they want I want to feel the 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.920
 earth will come deposited c edition 

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.899
 we can see that there are two holes 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.310
 who have been rebouched with the earth 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:59.119
 and in some great odds that if 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.259
 we raise the plate 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:02.259
 We find there 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:13.810
 here the end for death because of guys like 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.940
 and institute an aboriginal so that's 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:20.920
 a hundred of seems sincere so 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:23.080
 here and there we try in a box 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.840
 kneaded like that and in about twenty 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.640
 days we love little babies 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.580
 snails so we go 

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.580
 and to have 1500 tons of snails 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:48.590
 once out the nursery direction the 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:50.060
 great outdoors he has a lot of snails there 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.740
 there is more vegetation because 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.280
 that it's getting cold so the 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.530
 vegetation will begin 

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.720
 to fade what suits us well 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.000
 simplifies their a massage us for the 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.459
 amateur pickup take a board 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.440
 and they signed select the 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:07.600
 snails convergence and against and 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.430
 then next spring tillers 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.560
 we're going to get throws actions in everything 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.180
 nine who own remedies takes 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.690
 clean boards allow 

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:19.330
 birth of gestations something 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.550
 that then the visitation to put some 

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.950
 hard clover with alfalfa rapeseed 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:25.510
 there is nothing very very specific 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.080
 the goal is this way that his 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.489
 easy to eat leaf for the snail 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.930
 which is a plant cover during the 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:34.600
 six months of presence of the snail in 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:36.850
 the parks and then different heights 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.380
 since the vegetation will serve as 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.050
 food at lescar a lot but there 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.150
 also keep the moisture and protect from 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.650
 the light 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.209
 and when there is no big but tri 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:47.650
 natural necessary 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.560
 we have a watering system in the 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.680
 parks 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.510
 so watering on the way so that 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.549
 are going to eat 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.950
 it's a scene but it's the main 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.049
 asus actually ranching since in 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.319
 nature if it does not rain for two 

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:03.670
 month 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:06.310
 the snail will stay in their 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.680
 shell and are not going to eat after a 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:10.780
 ten days two young people up to 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.930
 hibernation before moving on to 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.930
 pan 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.290
 sk really wanted not too 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.680
 make funds 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.459
 it 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.090
 instead of 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:27.550
 and that's the screening the cooking 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:30.139
 but unfortunately we do not go out enough 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.270
 stressed out and a lot of people staying 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.530
 on the bad memories of tasting 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.690
 snails they feel like they have 

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:37.740
 something I'm an eraser in 

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.810
 America and 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:41.940
 elastic is hard to chew to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.270
 swallow it really is really 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.910
 past a snail to avoid was 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.750
 also installed 

00:04:46.910 --> 00:04:52.400
 thank in salads a salad just 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.340
 pan-fried with a touch of butter from all 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:55.540
 but hardly 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:57.190
 we can classify them with a touch of 

00:04:55.540 --> 00:05:01.139
 champagne on the fire or a hint of 

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:02.560
 vinegar if I have old wine vinegar 

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:03.550
 since in salad 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.710
 what does one learn from the rose a little 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.790
 on the slightly warm salad that goes 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.669
 call to lightly make the salad 

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:12.040
 who will welcome him after leather and 

00:05:09.669 --> 00:05:13.529
 pieces of bacon to add a little 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:15.539
 prunes 

00:05:13.529 --> 00:05:17.459
 like here or there we will attack the family 

00:05:15.539 --> 00:05:20.249
 hato a blanquette 

00:05:17.459 --> 00:05:22.289
 so we will get the court bouillon 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:25.049
 we're going to heat it up there was one 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.239
 little cream in it we put them 

00:05:25.049 --> 00:05:28.619
 snails foot ceps in soon 

00:05:27.239 --> 00:05:30.089
 September a bit and previously and we 

00:05:28.619 --> 00:05:32.939
 will always put on then we will cook 

00:05:30.089 --> 00:05:34.079
 his ten minutes Housing Complex 

00:05:32.939 --> 00:05:37.649
 I try why not in a 

00:05:34.079 --> 00:05:40.639
 sales pane in a crisp it changes 

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:40.639
 a bit of the ordinary
