00:00:00.029 --> 00:00:04.780
 and the high technology applied to medicine has said it pays its contributions in 

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:10.830
 many specialties but certainly one of the most notable and the application of 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.129
 the arts 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.550
 2 in this video you will know that it is a chickenpox what is the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.140
 treatment in varicose veins with laser and because it has become 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.279
 few years in the preferred of patients from around the world 

00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:30.429
 but let's see what a chickenpox is 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:36.050
 dpa in this picture you can see a healthy vein along with an artery 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.050
 and its corresponding collateral vessels 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.600
 and the arteries carry blood from the heart to the extremities 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.710
 while the pain returns the blood from the extremities 

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.970
 up to the heart 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.860
 let's concentrate now 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.700
 in what happens in the vein 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
 and let's see a longitudinal section of it 

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:02.620
 we see the valves working properly in a healthy vein 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.660
 and the function of these valves and that of opening when blood rises and closes 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.030
 when the blood tried to stop the flow in the direction 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.040
 contrary 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.040
 at the beginning of the process of forming a 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.840
 in this way and the valves that follow the same size 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.420
 can not help more to retain the blood that falls and falls or 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.450
 there is a reflux 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.680
 of inverse luxury that blood that falls and that which causes chicken pox and its 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.940
 consequences 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:47.400
 as you wash and you advance the vein continues to increase its diameter continues 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.600
 dilating 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.920
 and the walls become tortuous 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.500
 in this state the varices are in many cases painful and can 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.110
 wrong nara provoking thrombophlebitis you will be darkening 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.560
 of the legs 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.520
 there were other serious problems 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.639
 In addition to those known in desired aesthetic effects 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:10.740
 isÃ¡bena is no longer functional 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:13.419
 and it becomes insufficient 

00:02:13.419 --> 00:02:18.719
 those valves can not be repaired and the only way to solve the problem 

00:02:18.719 --> 00:02:21.719
 and dolabella are eliminated 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:24.000
 p 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.510
 until not long ago 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.709
 there was a treatment to eliminate large varicose veins 

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.689
 called sweeting 

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:37.290
 this was to introduce a metal hook called tripolar inside 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.199
 from the vein remove 

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:42.309
 make a cut on it at one end 

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:44.239
 hook her with the writer 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.239
 and start it by pulling from the other end 

00:02:47.809 --> 00:02:52.079
 how can it occur in this visibly traumatic process 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:56.950
 both the main vein and all the collateral steps are broken due to the 

00:02:56.949 --> 00:02:58.069
 attraction 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:02.249
 causing important bruises and traumas throughout the segment 

00:03:02.249 --> 00:03:04.499
 venous treated 

00:03:04.499 --> 00:03:08.760
 these important effusions trigger complicated and long postoperative 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:13.369
 in which patients usually have to stop their usual tasks 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:19.489
 stays at rest and maintain a series of costly and uncomfortable care 

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:24.739
 let's see now what happens in the treatment of high areas 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.899
 this intervention 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:32.899
 minimally invasive and ambulatory is resolved with a puncture in the area of 

00:03:32.899 --> 00:03:36.199
 ankle and in some cases the necessary disarmament 

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:39.199
 a very small cut level of the inguinal area 

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:44.899
 Through this function, an optical fiber of similar thickness is introduced 

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:49.320
 of a hair that transmits the laser light emitted by a medical team 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.179
 high power 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:55.109
 once the tip of the optical fiber is located in the section to be treated 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:58.889
 and the active lazar light will make the blood inside the vein 

00:03:58.889 --> 00:04:03.329
 causing the closure of the same without affecting even the walls of the 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:04.239
 Queen 

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.509
 and even less their collateral vessels 

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:08.850
 thanks to this 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.830
 there are no bruises or side effects 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:16.530
 The patient can retire in a few minutes to his home and resume his activity 

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.559
 usual the next day 

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.160
 let's see now from inside the mine 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:26.530
 as the light shot lazard causes the instantaneous contraction of the walls 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:27.439
 of the Queen 

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:33.189
 closing this to the passage of the blood without affecting absolutely albazo collateral 

00:04:34.749 --> 00:04:39.339
 as simply as the treatment of varicose veins with laser is explained 

00:04:39.339 --> 00:04:42.450
 allows to convert a traumatic surgery 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.740
 with a prolonged postoperative period 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.800
 in an ambulatory and minimally invasive intervention 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.119
 that allows the patient to return to normal activity in a few hours 

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.139
 consult your doctor about this treatment 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.270
 to solve your varicose veins problems in the most convenient way and 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:02.360
 simple 

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:06.460
 with an ambulatory and minimally invasive intervention 

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:10.139
 without bearing long and painful postoperative 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:13.279
 and resuming his normal activities the next day 

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.659
 the pact 

00:05:16.659 --> 00:05:18.200
 6 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.550
