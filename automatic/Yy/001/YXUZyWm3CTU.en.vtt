00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:29.590 
compression if any a nice leave doesn't

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:31.409 
compression if any a nice leave doesn't
really<00:05:29.860> do<00:05:30.070> much<00:05:30.099> of<00:05:30.310> anything<00:05:30.669> for<00:05:31.090> you<00:05:31.240> in

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:38.620 
mine or somebody else's but the

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.990 
mine or somebody else's but the
compression<00:05:39.130> cuff<00:05:39.310> is<00:05:39.460> actually<00:05:39.789> going<00:05:39.909> to

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:40.000 
compression cuff is actually going to

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:41.550 
compression cuff is actually going to
give<00:05:40.180> you<00:05:40.300> a<00:05:40.330> little<00:05:40.539> boost<00:05:40.780> because<00:05:41.080> it's

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
give you a little boost because it's

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:42.960 
give you a little boost because it's
kind<00:05:41.800> of<00:05:41.830> made<00:05:42.010> it<00:05:42.159> more<00:05:42.370> like<00:05:42.550> near<00:05:42.789> at

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
kind of made it more like near at

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.760 
kind of made it more like near at
material<00:05:43.510> you<00:05:44.199> get<00:05:44.289> a<00:05:44.320> little<00:05:44.500> extra

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:44.770 
material you get a little extra

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:46.920 
material you get a little extra
compression<00:05:45.130> there<00:05:45.490> so<00:05:45.699> you<00:05:45.760> kind<00:05:46.479> of<00:05:46.539> mix<00:05:46.780> the

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
compression there so you kind of mix the

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.290 
compression there so you kind of mix the
two<00:05:47.110> together<00:05:47.229> and<00:05:47.820> you<00:05:48.820> get<00:05:49.030> good

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:49.300 
two together and you get good

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:50.640 
two together and you get good
compression<00:05:49.900> mixed<00:05:50.169> with<00:05:50.289> some<00:05:50.440> mild

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:50.650 
compression mixed with some mild

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:52.589 
compression mixed with some mild
compression<00:05:51.310> and<00:05:51.490> some<00:05:51.849> comfort<00:05:52.270> of<00:05:52.389> a<00:05:52.449> knee

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
compression and some comfort of a knee

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.000 
compression and some comfort of a knee
sleeve<00:05:52.900> and<00:05:53.020> the<00:05:53.080> warmth<00:05:53.409> of<00:05:53.500> me<00:05:53.680> sleeve<00:05:53.979> and

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:54.010 
sleeve and the warmth of me sleeve and

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.820 
sleeve and the warmth of me sleeve and
you<00:05:54.220> get<00:05:54.840> some<00:05:55.840> really<00:05:56.080> good<00:05:56.199> compression

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
you get some really good compression

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:58.680 
you get some really good compression
some<00:05:57.009> good<00:05:57.159> warmth<00:05:57.550> and<00:05:57.669> you're<00:05:57.820> a<00:05:58.090> little<00:05:58.599> bit

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
some good warmth and you're a little bit

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:02.070
