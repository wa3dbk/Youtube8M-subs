00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:03.300
 if not to the truth that 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.339
 what to say 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.339
 which schedule does not have much to gain to return and more when 

00:00:08.229 --> 00:00:10.139
 when they leave equipment 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.919
 candy like racing avellaneda and good 

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:16.880
 very happy was because the percent staying one wants you abi 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:19.529
 but good for now everything is 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:22.250
 the police tried still says too 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.169
 to fix the raw issue 

00:00:24.169 --> 00:00:26.789
 but good with a lot of arrival and 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.679
 There is a lot of expectation to see what will happen if a proposal 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:33.679
 formal on the part of arras 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.789
 p for what I feel like saying 

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:43.400
 but omit as an object then let's see what happens the last hour 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.270
 why all iguana street entrance out the representative 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:52.460
 the face of kane in Argentina a greeting both are working 

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.400
 to see how with a lot of heart but one and that is in expectation because 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.010
 has never fixed in these cases 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.520
 a year before ivonne complicated his exit of the racing of santander johnson 

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:05.519
 time 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.060
 the club has given very good training 

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.360
 everything all everything what 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.470
 when the jury wants 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 wants to leave started like that a little against said car 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.510
 You can leave but good as I told you before 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.730
 is the thing and I can say that we were going to see what 

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.750
 what happened the same and decision that eta 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.070
 it has been confirmed that he did not have much wood 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.340
 but it was really the Argentinian he was a thorn that was stuck 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.770
 I want to get it out and and the truth is that this proposal comes 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.210
 I love to go ibm building mike 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.990
 two windows I already have a lot of desire 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.700
 A lot of confidence in coming back but today, the banking stand out 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.370
 you never know because what he did final only run it nation 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:57.360
 remembering his time in the youth team 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.620
 a player as a link 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.840
 ee in that same position I was playing these last years in Spain 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.730
 I expected 

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:08.800
 the power 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.909
 I was hooked as if I was going 

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.739
 but here and that is not used much in that position in Tangier they put me 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:17.349
 left band as left but 

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:19.409
 the recent direct attack 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.249
 manageable in any position because it was the one to each block 

00:02:23.779 --> 00:02:25.969
 can the variation of 9 

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:28.729
 then taking that left right hand drive 

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:31.129
 mediapunta vote the opposition 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:34.129
 brazenas post before not 

00:02:35.039 --> 00:02:37.109
 take it away 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:38.859
 that according 

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:40.999
 that the decision murcia 

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:45.639
 good bad not on my part was very young student mohamed malha who is going to go 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:48.139
 and the truth that 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:51.839
 what is clearly repeating a bit but now pd 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:56.379
 I only know that Chile is stunned where the thing made of SMEs 

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.269
 the first moment but 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.629
 tests until past the now what 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:02.900
 that the pp 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.480
 will have to continue baer warned with honor advanced to analyze the thing 

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:09.600
 p was not good 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:14.000
 ii who advised at that time with a carol in time 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
 of good was not right for you 

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.829
 p 

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:21.829
 Don Álvaro grandson something less than that moment ibor 

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:24.539
 the truth that 

00:03:24.539 --> 00:03:27.829
 that praises as endorsement cofrade 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:30.210
 p other than another 

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.949
 expectation and the truth that no 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:33.489
 clear that things did well 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.059
 but good you will see 

00:03:36.059 --> 00:03:41.009
 a boy the boy like similar in santomera mouth was very small and the 

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.909
 true that 

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.680
 it's not that it's bad and good 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.859
 but 

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:49.410
 ps for that is the radio wave to know how to admit it and I apologize 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:52.569
 dpa another the people who had before 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.569
 it will be decided in truth that kirk institutes vain 

00:03:57.599 --> 00:04:00.619
 mashaal of bad advice by counties 

00:04:00.619 --> 00:04:05.249
 from the one of honduras tumbling bandundu could convince or could not be brought to the 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.249
 eei or he also agreed representatives 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:10.799
 the increase apaza 

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.549
 according to the moment 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:17.039
 and is that a curtain was emitting peacock or one wants the best for him and 

00:04:17.039 --> 00:04:18.340
 safe 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.729
 when it is and gtb that eats your head 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.139
 the goal of san 

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:25.150
 somoza of these people believe 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:28.310
 I was like in the head and and what can you take out 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.760
 a black shirt you can see as a white player in tennessee 

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.690
 england states patient who did the best for me 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.410
 and the smn indicates or why I did not know anything was at that time I saw the demand 

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:44.569
 everything will be better if it were out of it 

00:04:44.569 --> 00:04:45.909
 and luckily 

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:47.870
 we are a little better things 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:50.479
 Now I have the cholo simeone 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:52.150
 and now they will be able to 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:54.479
 the apostille of the conade all 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:57.529
 all comfortable and cited the October 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:04:58.729
 in the serious 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:00.319
 I think that although they have received 

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.150
 he also rushed into the fifth 

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.729
 this activity that everyone 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:08.050
 my father was a thing of not counting on him because 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.520
 at stake like him and how to trader the bull debacle 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:12.589
 two fridays 

00:05:12.589 --> 00:05:15.069
 very green and the experience you have 

00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.660
 some tries to jorge bosca absorb all the coast that 

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.469
 I can give you keko and what 

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:24.749
 I said today that you agree that it becomes true that for me 

00:05:24.749 --> 00:05:25.240
 is 

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:26.770
 us as they were 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:29.080
 brayan lluy or stay with this he 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.970
 I decided to apologize to the people I was before 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.460
 well still your young 

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:38.990
 the ok to another serious one can serve the example and at the same time as a kind of 

00:05:38.990 --> 00:05:42.750
 advice for other players younger than you than for being in your 

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:46.870
 same situation and wanted or could happen another Andean player side of 

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:49.060
 representative as investment 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:53.840
 as he said he eats the head of the player and I guys are influenced 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:56.570
 and the father for him does not have much knowledge 

00:05:56.570 --> 00:06:00.040
 crespi we would say taking advantage of this opportunity well live 

00:06:01.629 --> 00:06:04.150
 nothing is left 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.670
 every situation is not different every evening and night was different and every 

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.189
 player is different 

00:06:09.189 --> 00:06:12.029
 p the only thing that I can tell you that 

00:06:12.029 --> 00:06:14.610
 think about the thing and what 

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:18.620
 and that transcend pastor has leaked to wikileaks one never knows what can 

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.099
 pass but 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.069
 p the skeleton of chris weitz opposes arid land 

00:06:24.069 --> 00:06:28.240
 ishihara may pass another mild adagio and piélagos that speaks to me because I already 

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:29.699
 desired but 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.939
 what is done is done and science 

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:32.819
 I take 

00:06:32.819 --> 00:06:36.139
 it does not matter if it is won and because only now it is advanced to the whole world 

00:06:36.139 --> 00:06:37.789
 it is not worth doing then 

00:06:37.789 --> 00:06:40.989
 what has been cool to think well think that the corteidh 

00:06:41.669 --> 00:06:44.020
 and who not everything is the day of kings 

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:48.830
 the sásabe with two old Argentines have tickets for the next few hours 

00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.159
 another day I have to say it 

00:06:51.159 --> 00:06:52.789
 given the opposition of 

00:06:52.789 --> 00:06:54.499
 j 

00:06:54.499 --> 00:06:56.069
 in the expectation of seeing 

00:06:56.069 --> 00:07:00.819
 town that its citizens and if I'm not wrong tony couple of that 

00:07:00.819 --> 00:07:02.350
 I would travel for that 

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.669
 we have a battery than expected 

00:07:04.669 --> 00:07:07.490
 this body in charge of the nba have 

00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:08.629
 time 

00:07:08.629 --> 00:07:11.490
 in his power min then 

00:07:11.490 --> 00:07:15.869
 it is to be expected that you see things well and hit it right away as 

00:07:15.869 --> 00:07:17.580
 as appropriate and 

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:20.860
 and if it requires it to travel tomorrow or the past when
