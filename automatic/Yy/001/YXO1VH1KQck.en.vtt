00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
pure pigment and this is how they made

pure pigment and this is how they made
your<00:02:42.450> pigment<00:02:42.930> I<00:02:43.020> took<00:02:43.350> pure<00:02:43.590> pigment<00:02:44.040> and

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
your pigment I took pure pigment and

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.160 
your pigment I took pure pigment and
mixed<00:02:45.090> it<00:02:45.180> with<00:02:45.300> some<00:02:45.480> other<00:02:45.600> things<00:02:45.720> I'm<00:02:46.050> not

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170 
mixed it with some other things I'm not

what<00:02:49.680> they<00:02:49.830> stored<00:02:50.220> their<00:02:50.510> pigments<00:02:51.510> in

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
what they stored their pigments in

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:54.410 
what they stored their pigments in
there's<00:02:52.709> some<00:02:52.920> small<00:02:53.280> Polk<00:02:53.640> cream<00:02:53.940> ones<00:02:54.180> where

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
there's some small Polk cream ones where

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.870 
there's some small Polk cream ones where
they<00:02:54.890> keep<00:02:55.890> their<00:02:56.100> pigment<00:02:56.459> and<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.700> is<00:02:56.850> a

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
they keep their pigment and this is a

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.920 
they keep their pigment and this is a
little<00:02:57.030> easier<00:02:57.360> for<00:02:57.570> handling<00:02:57.900> it<00:02:59.720> back<00:03:00.720> then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:00.930 
little easier for handling it back then

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.180 
little easier for handling it back then
they<00:03:01.050> actually<00:03:01.380> used<00:03:01.530> to<00:03:01.650> thing<00:03:01.830> called<00:03:02.070> an

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:02.190 
they actually used to thing called an

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.000 
they actually used to thing called an
acetate<00:03:02.790> stencil<00:03:04.100> there's<00:03:05.100> one<00:03:05.310> up<00:03:05.459> in<00:03:05.610> here

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
you can't see a real goodness I put some
