00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.019
I hate my friends.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.500
Do you remember how Sakura Spirit ended saying
that it was just a prologue of things to come

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.090
for the protagonist?

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.230
Well turns out Sakura Angels isn't a sequel
and has seemingly no relation to the first

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.550
game, so so much for that.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:31.780
The game starts with you waking up from a
nightmare that's far too ominous for its own

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:32.780
good.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.800
The main character complains that he has these
every night, and also wakes up with a piercing

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:37.829
headache.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.870
You then heads downstairs to the kitchen,
where you learn that you apparently live in

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.700
the fucking stratosphere.

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.640
No wonder you wake up with headaches every
day, you're not getting enough oxygen to your

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.640
brain at that altitude.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.990
Heading out onto the streets of the city,
you're surrounded by "waves of students" as

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:55.410
you head to school.

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.920
However after not paying attention for a short
while, you notice the streets have become

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.620
"suddenly deserted".

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.289
This change is very obvious and very disconcerting.

00:01:05.289 --> 00:01:07.130
Just look at the difference.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:11.030
Before you can fully cope with this jarring
change in population, you're attacked by the

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.240
most horrifying thing known to man: art from
a 12-year-old's DeviantArt account.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.990
You're clearly no match for this eldritch
horror, so you high-tail it.

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:24.299
Right before it can kill you, you're saved
by two "angels".

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.630
Well, alleged angels, at least.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.240
They say that you need to be protected because
reasons, so they then proceed to follow you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.070
around and annoy the shit out of you the entire
game.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.869
Except those times where they let you walk
in on them while they're naked.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:39.950
Yes, they do confirm that it was intentional.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:43.130
Well, at least the bathroom ones.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.720
It might just be the most passive-aggressive
approach ever done.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.380
They even take turns each day.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.909
One day when heading home from classes, Best
Girl- I mean Yuzuki shows up to kidnap or

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:54.640
kill you or something.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:57.880
There's also a tentacle monster, because of
course there is.

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.450
Unfortunately Sayaka and Hikari manage to
fend her off with the power of teamwork.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:03.450
Somehow.

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:09.000
To celebrate, you all decide to head to the
beach, where very important plot happens.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.920
The next day you head to class as usual.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:15.260
However, on your way to lunch you think you
spot Best Girl- I mean Yuzuki in the crowd,

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.660
and manage to follow her to the school's roof.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.141
She ignores the rain beating down on her as
she explains how she doesn't feel like she

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:22.390
has anywhere she belongs.

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.690
Cliques had formed before she even had a chance
to do anything about it.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:33.260
She feels completely invisible, as if nobody
knows nor cares that she exists.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.900
You've been in the same class with her for
five years, and you never even noticed.

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:43.790
This runs so deeply with her that she was
even willing to listen to and serve a clearly

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.700
evil entity, and probably even knows that
she's just being used, but doesn't care because

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:56.599
it still means that at least someone will
be acknowledging her.

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:00.900
You then ignore this extremely blatant cry
for help and decide to ask your angel guardians

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.920
for answers finally, because you're just a
selfish dickhead who clearly only cares about

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:05.920
himself.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.840
They finally divulge that your ancestor was
the one who sealed some great evil witch in

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.660
a crystal... thing.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.680
Now that the seal is weakening, you have to
go restrengthen it in order to stop her, which

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:21.140
seems like a bit of a short-sighted conclusion
considering that eventually the seal will

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:25.340
just weaken again like it is right now, but
hey.

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.599
You eventually reach the cave where the crystal
is, touch it, and wish really hard for the

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:31.740
mean witch to shut the hell up.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:38.480
Congratulations, you've saved... uh, all those
people you got to see before?

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.150
You might be wondering how I've already finished
my ever so witty and sarcastic summary of

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:47.700
the game despite it taking about as long to
beat as Sakura Spirit, and the simple answer

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.409
is that Sakura Angels was a pretty huge improvement.

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:53.769
Sakura Spirit was... well, it was bad.

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:59.100
While the spiritual sequel isn't exactly great,
it improved on some of the major issues the

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:00.100
first one had.

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:06.819
There was a more credible threat than just
"uhh, some slime girls are gonna do bad things...

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:13.260
maybe?"; the sense of humor was better; the
pacing felt better; and possibly most importantly,

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.769
your decisions actually matter!

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.711
Admittedly the choices amount to "which of
the two girls do you want to talk to/hang

00:04:19.711 --> 00:04:25.740
out with/etc.", so not exactly the most riveting
of decisions, but there's one of three endings

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:27.620
you'll get based on what you pick.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.279
I mean overall, I'd say the game is pretty-

00:04:30.279 --> 00:04:33.140
10/10, would recommen-

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:36.469
Wait, Best Girl doesn't have her own ending?

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:39.979
0/10, would uninstall and never touch again.
