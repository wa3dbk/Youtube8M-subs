00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:15.970 
my thought the obliteration mode takes

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:18.240 
my thought the obliteration mode takes
like<00:04:16.120> 30<00:04:16.269> minutes<00:04:16.630> to<00:04:16.750> finish<00:04:16.979> what<00:04:17.979> it<00:04:18.070> needs

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
like 30 minutes to finish what it needs

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.009 
like 30 minutes to finish what it needs
is<00:04:18.370> some<00:04:18.579> kind<00:04:18.760> of<00:04:18.820> like<00:04:18.970> it<00:04:19.600> needs<00:04:19.810> some<00:04:19.930> kind

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
is some kind of like it needs some kind

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.960 
is some kind of like it needs some kind
of<00:04:20.139> time<00:04:20.380> limit<00:04:20.709> so<00:04:20.859> that<00:04:21.100> the<00:04:21.370> game<00:04:21.579> modes<00:04:21.820> can

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:21.970 
of time limit so that the game modes can

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:22.680 
of time limit so that the game modes can
finish<00:04:22.150> faster

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
finish faster

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.129
