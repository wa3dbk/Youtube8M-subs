this<00:00:18.300> is<00:00:18.600> a<00:00:18.630> busy<00:00:19.260> steam<00:00:19.710> railway<00:00:20.210> just<00:00:21.210> like

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
this is a busy steam railway just like

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.759 
this is a busy steam railway just like
the<00:00:21.930> one<00:00:22.289> on<00:00:22.500> Sodor<00:00:22.949> and<00:00:24.019> this<00:00:25.019> is<00:00:25.289> a<00:00:25.320> steam

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
the one on Sodor and this is a steam

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.089 
the one on Sodor and this is a steam
engine<00:00:26.660> this<00:00:27.660> steam<00:00:28.109> engine<00:00:28.320> is<00:00:28.830> a<00:00:28.890> little

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
engine this steam engine is a little

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.110 
engine this steam engine is a little
like<00:00:29.760> Thomas<00:00:30.890> it's<00:00:31.890> called<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.550> steam<00:00:32.850> engine

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
like Thomas it's called a steam engine

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:39.170 
like Thomas it's called a steam engine
because<00:00:33.870> steam<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.980> what<00:00:35.040> makes<00:00:35.640> it<00:00:35.940> go<00:00:38.180> steam

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
because steam is what makes it go steam

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.220 
because steam is what makes it go steam
is<00:00:39.540> made<00:00:39.840> from<00:00:40.320> water<00:00:40.850> which<00:00:41.850> is<00:00:42.120> heated<00:00:42.480> by<00:00:42.690> a

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
is made from water which is heated by a

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.930 
is made from water which is heated by a
very<00:00:43.800> hot<00:00:44.190> fire<00:00:45.500> when<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.739> water<00:00:47.039> is<00:00:47.520> bubbling

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
very hot fire when the water is bubbling

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.630 
very hot fire when the water is bubbling
and<00:00:48.480> boiling<00:00:48.780> it<00:00:49.649> turns<00:00:50.280> to<00:00:50.730> steam<00:00:52.309> the<00:00:53.309> water

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
and boiling it turns to steam the water

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.139 
and boiling it turns to steam the water
is<00:00:54.120> kept<00:00:54.570> in<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.899> very<00:00:55.440> big<00:00:55.890> tank<00:00:56.399> at<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.850> front

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
is kept in a very big tank at the front

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.250 
is kept in a very big tank at the front
of<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.510> engine<00:00:58.219> this<00:00:59.219> tank<00:00:59.730> holds<00:01:00.300> lots<00:01:00.780> and

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
of the engine this tank holds lots and

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.140 
of the engine this tank holds lots and
lots<00:01:01.620> of<00:01:01.859> water<00:01:03.350> the<00:01:04.350> bigger<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.979> tank<00:01:05.339> the

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
lots of water the bigger the tank the

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.969 
lots of water the bigger the tank the
more<00:01:06.479> water<00:01:06.869> the<00:01:07.140> engine<00:01:07.950> can<00:01:08.189> hold<00:01:09.380> but<00:01:10.380> even

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
more water the engine can hold but even

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.810 
more water the engine can hold but even
very<00:01:11.549> very<00:01:11.909> big<00:01:12.659> engines<00:01:13.229> need<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.369> be<00:01:14.520> filled

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
very very big engines need to be filled

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.140 
very very big engines need to be filled
with<00:01:14.970> water<00:01:15.259> often<00:01:17.900> an<00:01:18.900> engine<00:01:19.650> uses<00:01:20.280> a<00:01:20.310> lot<00:01:20.939> of

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
with water often an engine uses a lot of

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.060 
with water often an engine uses a lot of
water<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.960> make<00:01:22.229> steam<00:01:24.140> this<00:01:25.140> fireman<00:01:25.830> is

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
water to make steam this fireman is

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.469 
water to make steam this fireman is
filling<00:01:27.000> up<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.450> tank<00:01:27.750> on<00:01:27.960> his<00:01:27.990> engine<00:01:29.479> he

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
filling up the tank on his engine he

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.270 
filling up the tank on his engine he
does<00:01:30.840> this<00:01:31.170> every<00:01:31.409> time<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.759> water<00:01:32.970> runs<00:01:33.540> low

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
does this every time the water runs low

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.120 
does this every time the water runs low
this<00:01:35.280> can<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.759> every<00:01:36.390> journey<00:01:36.869> if<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.710> engine

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
this can be every journey if the engine

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.999 
this can be every journey if the engine
is<00:01:38.280> working<00:01:38.310> very<00:01:39.030> hard<00:01:44.000> every<00:01:45.290> steam<00:01:46.290> railway

the engine is ready to make more steam
the<00:02:43.220> fire<00:02:43.580> in<00:02:43.970> the<00:02:44.090> firebox<00:02:44.420> eats<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.500> new

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
the fire in the firebox eats the new

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.380 
the fire in the firebox eats the new
water<00:02:46.130> until<00:02:46.760> it's<00:02:46.970> bubbling<00:02:47.600> and<00:02:47.870> boiling<00:02:48.230> a

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
water until it's bubbling and boiling a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:53.500 
water until it's bubbling and boiling a
boiling<00:02:50.390> water<00:02:50.690> turns<00:02:51.200> into<00:02:51.410> steam<00:02:52.030> lots<00:02:53.030> and

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
boiling water turns into steam lots and

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.090 
boiling water turns into steam lots and
lots<00:02:53.930> of<00:02:54.200> steam

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:55.100 
lots of steam

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:02.200 
lots of steam
the<00:02:56.100> steam<00:02:56.630> turns<00:02:57.630> the<00:02:58.050> wheels<00:02:58.350> around<00:03:00.890> and

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:02.210 
the steam turns the wheels around and

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:06.020 
the steam turns the wheels around and
soon<00:03:03.210> the<00:03:03.510> engine<00:03:04.080> is<00:03:04.290> proudly<00:03:04.850> puffing<00:03:05.850> up

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
soon the engine is proudly puffing up

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:08.810 
soon the engine is proudly puffing up
and<00:03:06.240> down<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:06.780> railway<00:03:07.350> track<00:03:07.680> taking<00:03:08.430> its

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
and down the railway track taking its

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:13.070 
and down the railway track taking its
passengers<00:03:09.540> where<00:03:09.840> they<00:03:09.870> want<00:03:10.590> to<00:03:10.860> go
