intend to do before say bulking out have
a<00:00:09.280> look<00:00:09.430> down<00:00:09.610> in<00:00:09.850> your<00:00:10.030> seat

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
the bulk of wiring loom that's the one

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.620 
the bulk of wiring loom that's the one
that<00:00:13.570> goes<00:00:13.690> over<00:00:13.929> to<00:00:14.139> the<00:00:14.340> Y<00:00:15.340> promoter<00:00:15.700> in<00:00:16.509> the

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:16.630 
that goes over to the Y promoter in the

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:21.330 
that goes over to the Y promoter in the
speaker<00:00:18.390> this<00:00:19.390> was<00:00:19.570> hidden<00:00:19.750> in<00:00:19.960> one<00:00:20.140> piece<00:00:20.410> two

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:21.340 
speaker this was hidden in one piece two

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.880 
speaker this was hidden in one piece two
volts<00:00:24.930> piece<00:00:25.930> of<00:00:26.080> wire<00:00:26.260> that<00:00:26.439> goes<00:00:26.500> through

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
volts piece of wire that goes through

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:29.060 
volts piece of wire that goes through
there<00:00:27.160> that<00:00:27.310> goes<00:00:27.519> through<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:28.029> heater

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
there that goes through the heater

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.560 
there that goes through the heater
heater<00:00:30.070> box<00:00:30.310> and<00:00:30.550> his<00:00:30.640> multi<00:00:30.939> plugs<00:00:31.180> on<00:00:31.359> there

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:31.570 
heater box and his multi plugs on there

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.030 
heater box and his multi plugs on there
so<00:00:31.779> we'll<00:00:31.900> undo<00:00:32.110> that<00:00:32.260> from<00:00:32.410> the<00:00:32.500> outside<00:00:32.830> and

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:33.040 
so we'll undo that from the outside and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:34.830 
so we'll undo that from the outside and
that<00:00:33.100> could<00:00:33.309> come<00:00:33.430> back<00:00:33.640> through<00:00:33.970> so<00:00:34.570> don't

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
that could come back through so don't

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.650 
that could come back through so don't
need<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:35.079> chocolate<00:00:35.440> anything<00:00:35.800> for<00:00:35.920> that<00:00:36.010> one

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
need to chocolate anything for that one

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.600 
need to chocolate anything for that one
this<00:00:37.660> one<00:00:37.719> goes<00:00:38.079> through<00:00:38.260> the<00:00:38.410> bulkhead<00:00:38.860> so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.610 
this one goes through the bulkhead so

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:41.790 
this one goes through the bulkhead so
we're<00:00:40.270> level<00:00:40.510> at<00:00:40.570> the<00:00:40.660> other<00:00:40.780> side<00:00:41.050> and<00:00:41.410> under

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:41.800 
we're level at the other side and under

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.240 
we're level at the other side and under
the<00:00:41.920> e/m<00:00:43.200> multi<00:00:44.200> plugs<00:00:44.440> the<00:00:44.559> other<00:00:44.680> side<00:00:44.920> see

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:45.250 
the e/m multi plugs the other side see

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:46.440 
the e/m multi plugs the other side see
what's<00:00:45.430> there<00:00:45.610> when<00:00:45.790> we<00:00:45.879> get<00:00:46.030> down<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.239> front

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:46.450 
what's there when we get down the front

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.850 
what's there when we get down the front
so<00:00:46.870> that's<00:00:46.989> that<00:00:47.289> and<00:00:47.350> that<00:00:47.469> should<00:00:47.590> release

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:47.860 
so that's that and that should release

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:49.020 
so that's that and that should release
that<00:00:48.010> hope<00:00:48.399> that's<00:00:48.640> that<00:00:48.789> would<00:00:48.879> come<00:00:49.000> through

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
that hope that's that would come through

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.180 
that hope that's that would come through
this<00:00:49.270> way<00:00:49.329> you<00:00:49.539> should<00:00:49.629> do<00:00:49.960> as<00:00:50.800> I<00:00:50.890> said<00:00:51.010> before

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
this way you should do as I said before

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.380 
this way you should do as I said before
I<00:00:51.370> haven't<00:00:51.550> done<00:00:51.640> one<00:00:51.789> of<00:00:51.820> these<00:00:51.940> before<00:00:52.000> so

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
I haven't done one of these before so

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:56.930 
I haven't done one of these before so
I'm<00:00:52.750> attack<00:00:53.050> me<00:00:53.200> as<00:00:53.289> a<00:00:53.320> learner<00:00:53.590> as<00:00:53.860> well<00:00:54.039> and

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:04.400 

fan<00:00:57.940> plug<00:00:58.829> Master<00:00:59.829> bei<00:01:00.070> on<00:01:00.520> and<00:01:00.910> hooked<00:01:02.190> fan

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
fan plug Master bei on and hooked fan

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.870 
fan plug Master bei on and hooked fan
takes<00:01:05.410> your<00:01:05.649> meter<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.009> heater<00:01:06.190> control<00:01:06.610> so

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
takes your meter and heater control so

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.149 
takes your meter and heater control so
that's<00:01:07.060> that<00:01:07.240> undone<00:01:07.659> the<00:01:07.780> cable<00:01:08.170> or<00:01:08.260> net<00:01:08.470> I've

00:01:09.149 --> 00:01:09.159 
that's that undone the cable or net I've

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.010 
that's that undone the cable or net I've
not<00:01:09.430> pushed<00:01:09.729> all<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:09.970> cables<00:01:10.450> back<00:01:10.510> through

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
not pushed all the cables back through

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.289 
not pushed all the cables back through
because<00:01:11.680> we<00:01:11.830> don't<00:01:12.010> need<00:01:12.189> to<00:01:12.430> the<00:01:13.060> plate

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:13.299 
because we don't need to the plate

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:14.789 
because we don't need to the plate
through<00:01:13.510> there<00:01:13.750> it's<00:01:13.960> got<00:01:14.080> four<00:01:14.320> screws<00:01:14.650> on

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
through there it's got four screws on

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:16.440 
through there it's got four screws on
the<00:01:14.950> outside<00:01:15.310> I<00:01:15.340> went<00:01:15.640> under<00:01:15.850> the<00:01:15.939> four<00:01:16.119> screws

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:16.450 
the outside I went under the four screws

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.719 
the outside I went under the four screws
take<00:01:17.439> the<00:01:17.560> plate<00:01:17.799> back<00:01:18.009> but<00:01:18.310> hopefully<00:01:18.580> that

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
take the plate back but hopefully that

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.120 
take the plate back but hopefully that
will<00:01:18.820> take<00:01:19.000> it<00:01:19.180> we<00:01:19.299> think<00:01:19.860> everything<00:01:20.860> back

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:21.130 
will take it we think everything back

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.440 
will take it we think everything back
through<00:01:21.340> with<00:01:21.549> it<00:01:21.670> and<00:01:21.820> then<00:01:21.939> we<00:01:22.030> can<00:01:22.119> keep<00:01:22.270> it

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
through with it and then we can keep it

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.480 
through with it and then we can keep it
all<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.930> roughly<00:01:23.500> at<00:01:23.590> the<00:01:23.619> right<00:01:23.860> length<00:01:24.070> and

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
all and roughly at the right length and

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.630 
all and roughly at the right length and
in<00:01:25.000> the<00:01:25.119> right<00:01:25.240> positions<00:01:25.659> of<00:01:25.869> where<00:01:26.110> it<00:01:26.200> goes

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
in the right positions of where it goes

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.740 
in the right positions of where it goes
have<00:01:27.640> a<00:01:27.700> cup<00:01:27.850> of<00:01:27.880> pieces<00:01:28.210> of<00:01:28.299> wire<00:01:28.450> that<00:01:28.600> go

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
have a cup of pieces of wire that go

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.870 
have a cup of pieces of wire that go
through<00:01:29.080> there<00:01:29.259> so<00:01:29.979> they<00:01:30.130> will<00:01:30.280> probably<00:01:30.369> and

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
through there so they will probably and

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.609 
through there so they will probably and
unplug<00:01:31.630> the<00:01:31.659> other<00:01:31.900> side<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.350> come<00:01:32.380> back

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
unplug the other side and come back

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:33.990 
unplug the other side and come back
through<00:01:32.799> this<00:01:32.920> way<00:01:32.979> haven't<00:01:33.490> had<00:01:33.579> a<00:01:33.640> look<00:01:33.759> yet

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 
through this way haven't had a look yet

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.319 
through this way haven't had a look yet
speedo<00:01:34.840> cable<00:01:34.869> that<00:01:35.380> can<00:01:35.500> stay<00:01:35.710> there<00:01:35.770> for<00:01:36.130> now

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
speedo cable that can stay there for now

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.800 
speedo cable that can stay there for now
that<00:01:37.329> big<00:01:37.509> plate<00:01:37.720> will<00:01:37.869> come<00:01:38.020> through<00:01:38.229> and

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
that big plate will come through and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.969 
that big plate will come through and
otherwise<00:01:40.810> hear<00:01:41.140> that<00:01:41.409> that<00:01:41.590> should<00:01:41.799> get<00:01:41.920> us

00:01:41.969 --> 00:01:41.979 
otherwise hear that that should get us

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.070 
otherwise hear that that should get us
even<00:01:42.400> where<00:01:42.520> you<00:01:42.640> are

three four wires going on it and don't
forget<00:01:54.260> take<00:01:54.650> a<00:01:54.680> picture<00:01:55.220> and<00:01:55.460> I've<00:01:55.550> put<00:01:55.730> a<00:01:55.760> bit

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
forget take a picture and I've put a bit

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.400 
forget take a picture and I've put a bit
of<00:01:55.940> Thai<00:01:56.150> ground<00:01:56.390> if<00:01:56.510> it<00:01:56.600> says<00:01:56.810> ignition

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.410 
of Thai ground if it says ignition

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:59.050 
of Thai ground if it says ignition
so<00:01:57.770> those<00:01:57.920> four<00:01:58.160> wires<00:01:58.400> go<00:01:58.670> on<00:01:58.790> the<00:01:58.880> ignition

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.060 
so those four wires go on the ignition

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:01.120 
so those four wires go on the ignition
and<00:01:59.360> know<00:01:59.480> that<00:01:59.720> I've<00:02:00.470> took<00:02:00.680> a<00:02:00.740> picture<00:02:00.980> of

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
and know that I've took a picture of

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:02.680 
and know that I've took a picture of
them<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:01.490> we've<00:02:01.610> got<00:02:01.730> the<00:02:01.820> color-coded<00:02:02.540> and

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:02.690 
them so we've got the color-coded and

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:05.980 
them so we've got the color-coded and
the<00:02:03.140> wire<00:02:03.910> I've<00:02:04.910> done<00:02:05.150> done<00:02:05.300> this<00:02:05.420> bracket<00:02:05.870> yet

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:05.990 
the wire I've done done this bracket yet

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.210 
the wire I've done done this bracket yet
because<00:02:06.140> I'm<00:02:06.230> hoping<00:02:06.470> to<00:02:06.590> take<00:02:06.740> that<00:02:06.890> off<00:02:06.980> with

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:07.220 
because I'm hoping to take that off with

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.460 
because I'm hoping to take that off with
um<00:02:08.410> they<00:02:09.410> can<00:02:09.470> just<00:02:09.770> carefully<00:02:10.280> feed<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:11.470> push

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470 
um they can just carefully feed and push

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:25.060 
um they can just carefully feed and push
all<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:12.830> relays<00:02:13.760> and<00:02:14.000> plug<00:02:14.230> through<00:02:24.070> keeping

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
all the relays and plug through keeping

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.360 
all the relays and plug through keeping
that<00:02:25.310> tight<00:02:25.550> there<00:02:25.900> the<00:02:26.900> wiring<00:02:27.290> loom<00:02:27.370> is

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:28.370 
that tight there the wiring loom is

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:30.850 
that tight there the wiring loom is
ready<00:02:28.550> to<00:02:28.700> be<00:02:28.820> pulled<00:02:29.030> free<00:02:29.650> so<00:02:30.650> I'm<00:02:30.709> gonna
