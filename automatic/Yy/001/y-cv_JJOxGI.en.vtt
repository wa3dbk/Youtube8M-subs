we<00:00:02.850> were<00:00:02.909> flat<00:00:03.149> on<00:00:03.179> our<00:00:03.330> backs<00:00:03.689> and<00:00:04.080> I<00:00:04.620> recall

couple of seagulls and I've often

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.100 
couple of seagulls and I've often
wondered<00:00:09.090> what<00:00:09.360> happened<00:00:09.660> to<00:00:09.719> those<00:00:09.840> seagulls

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110

I<00:01:07.260> thought<00:01:08.260> we'd<00:01:08.530> had<00:01:08.740> it<00:01:08.920> during<00:01:09.670> launch

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:15.270 

I<00:01:13.210> was<00:01:13.840> hoping<00:01:14.140> that<00:01:14.200> Frank<00:01:14.590> Borman<00:01:15.010> didn't

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
I was hoping that Frank Borman didn't

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.360 
I was hoping that Frank Borman didn't
have<00:01:15.460> his<00:01:15.640> hand<00:01:15.910> on<00:01:16.120> the<00:01:16.330> abort<00:01:16.660> controller<00:01:17.370> he

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
have his hand on the abort controller he

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.610 
have his hand on the abort controller he
said<00:01:18.880> he<00:01:18.970> took<00:01:19.120> his<00:01:19.270> hand<00:01:19.510> off<00:01:19.660> brother<00:01:20.320> die

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:20.620 
said he took his hand off brother die

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:24.150 
said he took his hand off brother die
than<00:01:21.040> make<00:01:21.250> a<00:01:21.280> false<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.790> burger<00:01:22.770> one<00:01:23.770> minute

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
than make a false a burger one minute

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:32.320 
the most powerful machine that man has

seven and a half million pounds of

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:39.340

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.820 
thrust I think we were all surprised at
how<00:01:39.430> strong<00:01:39.790> that<00:01:40.090> thing<00:01:40.300> was

two or three if emissions before ours

two or three if emissions before ours
but<00:01:47.310> it<00:01:47.430> was<00:01:47.550> a<00:01:47.580> piece<00:01:47.850> of<00:01:47.880> cake<00:01:48.120> just<00:01:48.420> worked

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
but it was a piece of cake just worked

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.250
