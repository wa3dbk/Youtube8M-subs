00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.330
 if you are going to fill a 

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.440
 the enchiladas of which they are can add water 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.280
 simoncelli have been twisted makes necessary 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.660
 as a first step we go to both 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.550
 put to cook the tomatoes with chilies 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.490
 once they are ready let's move 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:59.520
 so I'm going to put to the equator the tomatoes the green chilies and the tooth of 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.010
 garlic with a little chicken broth 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:05.590

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.820

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.720
 fry the onion 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.720

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:17.640
 Season with powdered chicken broth 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.590
 and as in this case I start that the chicken broth I will not deny saint 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.590
 excesses add water can be inherited message 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.670
 let's say it takes about ten minutes 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.670
 and it's ready 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.690
 on the other hand we are going to give hostilities 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.600
 on both sides 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.980
 We were going to keep them 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:41.980
 having the tortillas ready 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.180
 let's fill this to the tortilla with a little support 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.440
 as its combustion 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.070
 can roll up regrets quito 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:55.070

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.029
 the cream and the fresh cheese 

00:02:30.029 --> 00:02:31.069
