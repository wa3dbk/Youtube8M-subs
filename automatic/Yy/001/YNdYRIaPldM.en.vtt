00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:10.410
 hello today let's see what the 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:14.889
 white piece that comes with the cameras 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:16.250
 but it's a piece called a stopper 

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.720
 closing 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:19.250
 and it is a piece that is used to 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.030
 secure the camera in the fixings 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.030
 where are you going 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.050
 its assembly is very simple 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.530
 we remove the screw that 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:36.310
 fix the camera 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:38.560
 we put the circular part 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:43.200
 inside the screw so you do not leave 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:48.470
 the piece we use again 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:50.390
 and now we have the subject piece 

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.780
 Amen 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.890
 how it works or what it is used for 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.530
 Well now you are going to see it is very 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.469
 easy 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.230
 we take a fixation and usually what 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.760
 what do we do 

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:07.159
 is to put the camera 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.049
 here is the camera tucked 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.180
 and to get it out, what we do is 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:13.350
 enable here 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.689
 to me 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.600
 so that this piece is used 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.600
 precisely so that you can not go the 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:26.290
 camera if there is a blow that we make 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.130
 we put this piece inside the holes 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.130
 what has 

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.229
 a list 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.229
 t 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.810
 we have left 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:44.210
 and what happens with this, since it is no longer 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.190
 we can move it 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:48.650
 you can not move you can not tighten the 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.700
 camera is impossible from this time to 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:57.300
 remove it then the piece is removed 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:02:00.510
 you tighten your eyelashes and you know 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:02.360
 good as you see is very simple to 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:06.150
 take it off 

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:08.399
 we do the opposite process and this one 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:11.940
 this piece what happens is that only 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.530
 used by three where there may be a lot 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.940
 movement and can make the camera if 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.670
 will come out if not then it is not necessary 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.380
 Well, I hope you have been worth this 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.160
 explanation for its use 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.160
 until next time
