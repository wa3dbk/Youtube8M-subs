00:00:01.759 --> 00:00:04.759
 good afternoon and welcome to the movement avoid 

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:11.300
 with the arrival of book s5 I was going to iTunes 10 5 one of the most 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.449
 demanded by users finally arrives 

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:16.769
 the ability to synchronize 

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:19.019
 via wifi our devices 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:21.880
 I totally do without carmen 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.599
 with this one was post pc 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:27.099
 there are another 10 5 puts us in front of the possibility of synchronizing 

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.560
 our iphone is missing two cakes 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:33.050
 via wi-fi 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.750
 so we would not be here we just have to check the corresponding option 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.800
 will appear 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.310
 in the tab 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.310
 where information of bishops and thymus was shown 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:47.960
 once marked that option 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.970
 our device will pass if it is not like that and to me yes with which we are going to 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.870
 be able to mark content from a computer 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:55.930
 agreement 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:57.110
 Lets put 

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.760
 access applications 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.170
 and this will be shown in this case 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.320
 we are showing all this information via wi-fi ie the device is 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.979
 connected in no time to the team and we can perform the same actions 

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:15.140
 but without carmen 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.230
 yes we get moving 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.980
 for all sections and mark what we want to synchronize 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.700
 time 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.800
 synchronization 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.850
 greater with less depending on the contents that we had marked and on 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
 everything depending on the speed demonstrated 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.790
 If we look 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.460
 we no longer have an ideal option to update measures to restore 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.040
 for this we just have to go with our device physically to 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.290
 equipment and connect them with the cable move 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.660
 it is not necessary to mark any option 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.350
 our something that in this case you are doing view prevents or which 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.980
 if we pay agreed but yes 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.740
 we need to restore 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.670
 for making an update 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.590
 I do not know alicante from the device 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.029
 we are warned that we have in door 

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:13.170
 As you can see, this option allows us to have the device in 

00:02:13.169 --> 00:02:17.889
 any Arab club the house of the office and power has marking the 

00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:20.959
 content that interests us 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:26.030
 once we select the content we click on apply and it is that 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.669
 will synchronize 

00:02:28.669 --> 00:02:31.189
 we also have another option 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:32.180
 It can 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:34.099
 that is Tuesday 

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:37.019
 we have 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:38.379
 our iphone 

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:42.330
 I remember it is not configured for if it is not like that via wi-fi 

00:02:43.609 --> 00:02:48.010
 when what we have connected down an electrical outlet with sestÃ¡k singing 

00:02:48.009 --> 00:02:49.619
 we can do 

00:02:49.619 --> 00:02:52.790
 that the contents are simply entity legally 

00:02:53.449 --> 00:02:54.669
 that is to say 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.129
 as you can see in the capture 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:02.189
 we have the possibility that once you are winning then all these news 

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:05.169
 after those discarded house weights 

00:03:05.169 --> 00:03:09.419
 without advertising automatically on both traditional devices 

00:03:09.419 --> 00:03:11.840
 Syria another way to synchronize 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:17.599
 via wi-fi but yes use the option and always being private here the 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.599
 device has to be at home 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.549
 please be alone new options that allows us yesterday the 10 5 together 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:28.050
 gordillo s5 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:32.760
 and that they are released to some extent from the use of such were to answer 

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.559
 permanently linked though 

00:03:35.559 --> 00:03:39.439
 well then this is all we'll see in a next visit our web team 

00:03:39.439 --> 00:03:40.529
