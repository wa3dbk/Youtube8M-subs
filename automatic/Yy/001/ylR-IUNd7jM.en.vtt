such a wonderful sight first couple of
fences<00:00:16.209> are<00:00:16.420> fairly<00:00:16.810> straightforward

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:17.199 
fences are fairly straightforward

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.130 
fences are fairly straightforward
they're<00:00:18.190> big<00:00:18.460> and<00:00:18.699> wide<00:00:18.910> the<00:00:19.390> maximum<00:00:19.960> height

they're big and wide the maximum height

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.070 
they're big and wide the maximum height
being<00:00:20.500> 3<00:00:20.710> through<00:00:20.890> 11<00:00:20.980> or<00:00:21.430> 1<00:00:21.460> meter<00:00:21.760> 20<00:00:22.420> they

know what part of the world you come
from<00:00:25.080> and<00:00:26.080> then<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.070> lovely<00:00:27.910> grass<00:00:28.619> going

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:29.619 
from and then the lovely grass going

again and a maximum height but again
straightforward<00:00:39.610> it's<00:00:39.730> just<00:00:39.880> to<00:00:39.940> get<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:40.149 
straightforward it's just to get the

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.799 
straightforward it's just to get the
horses<00:00:40.450> into<00:00:40.809> a<00:00:40.840> flow<00:00:41.140> and<00:00:41.440> the<00:00:42.809> confidence

horses into a flow and the confidence
built<00:00:44.140> up<00:00:44.350> at<00:00:44.500> the<00:00:44.530> beginning<00:00:44.680> of<00:00:45.040> the<00:00:45.100> track

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
built up at the beginning of the track

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.720 
built up at the beginning of the track
and<00:00:46.450> then<00:00:46.840> we<00:00:46.989> come<00:00:47.230> to<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.950> chicane<00:00:48.370> er<00:00:48.399> which

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:48.730 
and then we come to the chicane er which

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:52.260 
and then we come to the chicane er which
is<00:00:48.850> a<00:00:48.879> big<00:00:49.059> log<00:00:49.540> over<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.020> ditch<00:00:50.399> at<00:00:51.399> four<00:00:51.910> and

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:52.270 
is a big log over a ditch at four and

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:55.139 
is a big log over a ditch at four and
then<00:00:53.230> the<00:00:53.559> first<00:00:54.129> of<00:00:54.280> the<00:00:54.399> combinations<00:00:55.030> we

00:00:55.139 --> 00:00:55.149 
then the first of the combinations we

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:58.020 
then the first of the combinations we
wiggle<00:00:55.480> down<00:00:55.870> through<00:00:56.770> the<00:00:56.890> dip<00:00:57.070> here<00:00:57.430> quick

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.030 
wiggle down through the dip here quick

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:00.720 
wiggle down through the dip here quick
turn<00:00:58.300> and<00:00:58.600> then<00:00:58.809> through<00:00:59.110> the<00:00:59.350> keyhole<00:00:59.920> the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
turn and then through the keyhole the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:03.569 
turn and then through the keyhole the
very<00:01:01.570> narrow<00:01:01.870> two<00:01:02.260> meter<00:01:02.469> 40<00:01:02.829> across<00:01:03.219> in<00:01:03.520> a

00:01:03.569 --> 00:01:03.579 
very narrow two meter 40 across in a

very narrow two meter 40 across in a
meter<00:01:03.730> is<00:01:03.879> 60<00:01:04.239> high<00:01:04.420> and<00:01:04.749> then<00:01:05.199> a<00:01:05.229> quick<00:01:05.560> sharp

00:01:05.849 --> 00:01:05.859 
meter is 60 high and then a quick sharp

00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:08.429 
meter is 60 high and then a quick sharp
turn<00:01:06.189> right<00:01:06.549> over<00:01:06.819> the<00:01:07.420> natural<00:01:07.600> hedge<00:01:08.139> and

00:01:08.429 --> 00:01:08.439 
turn right over the natural hedge and

00:01:08.439 --> 00:01:11.660 
turn right over the natural hedge and
then<00:01:09.179> gallop<00:01:10.179> off<00:01:10.359> so<00:01:10.600> quite<00:01:11.049> a<00:01:11.079> difficult

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
then gallop off so quite a difficult

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:14.399 
then gallop off so quite a difficult
turning<00:01:12.670> question<00:01:13.060> there<00:01:13.299> early<00:01:14.200> on<00:01:14.289> the

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:14.409 
turning question there early on the

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:17.660 
turning question there early on the
track<00:01:14.679> then<00:01:15.490> we<00:01:15.609> let<00:01:15.729> the<00:01:15.819> horses<00:01:16.119> gallop<00:01:16.479> on

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
track then we let the horses gallop on

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.050 
track then we let the horses gallop on
with<00:01:18.670> another<00:01:18.999> big<00:01:19.770> wide<00:01:20.770> table<00:01:21.249> fence<00:01:21.700> on<00:01:21.939> the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:22.060 
with another big wide table fence on the

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.179 
with another big wide table fence on the
turn<00:01:22.299> here<00:01:22.749> go<00:01:23.259> too<00:01:23.319> slow<00:01:23.560> the<00:01:23.679> horses<00:01:24.009> down

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
turn here go too slow the horses down

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.010 
turn here go too slow the horses down
for<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.579> corners<00:01:25.060> and<00:01:25.299> so<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:25.539> a<00:01:25.599> good<00:01:25.779> place

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
for the corners and so it's a good place

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.589 
for the corners and so it's a good place
to<00:01:26.049> put<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.349> jump<00:01:26.649> and<00:01:26.829> it<00:01:27.819> stops<00:01:28.060> people<00:01:28.270> going

00:01:28.589 --> 00:01:28.599 
to put a jump and it stops people going

00:01:28.599 --> 00:01:31.349 
to put a jump and it stops people going
around<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.869> bend<00:01:29.020> too<00:01:29.919> fast<00:01:30.249> and<00:01:30.639> then

00:01:31.349 --> 00:01:31.359 
around the bend too fast and then

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:32.669 
around the bend too fast and then
they've<00:01:31.569> got<00:01:31.689> to<00:01:31.719> get<00:01:31.869> back<00:01:32.079> into<00:01:32.349> a<00:01:32.499> rhythm

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
they've got to get back into a rhythm

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.129 
they've got to get back into a rhythm
good<00:01:33.039> gallop<00:01:33.310> and<00:01:33.609> coming<00:01:34.569> along<00:01:34.689> towards<00:01:35.079> the

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
good gallop and coming along towards the

00:01:35.139 --> 00:01:37.319 
good gallop and coming along towards the
barn<00:01:35.409> here<00:01:35.770> and<00:01:35.950> then<00:01:36.609> we've<00:01:36.759> got<00:01:36.880> a<00:01:36.939> couple<00:01:37.179> of

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:37.329 
barn here and then we've got a couple of

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.589 
barn here and then we've got a couple of
offset<00:01:38.109> barns<00:01:38.619> painted<00:01:39.069> blue<00:01:39.310> and<00:01:39.639> here<00:01:40.450> it's

00:01:40.589 --> 00:01:40.599 
offset barns painted blue and here it's

00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.510 
offset barns painted blue and here it's
a<00:01:40.689> question<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.049> getting<00:01:41.139> the<00:01:41.409> line<00:01:41.770> right<00:01:42.130> you

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
a question of getting the line right you

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.099 
a question of getting the line right you
need<00:01:42.700> to<00:01:42.789> be<00:01:42.880> on<00:01:42.969> the<00:01:43.060> left<00:01:43.359> of<00:01:43.539> the<00:01:43.630> first<00:01:43.840> one

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:44.109 
need to be on the left of the first one

the right of the second one to get one

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.059 
the right of the second one to get one
fairly<00:01:46.029> forward<00:01:46.630> stride<00:01:46.929> through<00:01:47.169> if<00:01:47.770> they

fairly forward stride through if they

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:50.789 
fairly forward stride through if they

you<00:04:01.310> go<00:04:01.430> around<00:04:01.520> the<00:04:01.730> course<00:04:01.970> you<00:04:02.150> have<00:04:02.240> to<00:04:02.390> ask

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:03.230 
you go around the course you have to ask

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:05.020 
you go around the course you have to ask
the<00:04:03.590> question<00:04:03.980> at<00:04:04.070> combinations<00:04:04.400> and<00:04:04.880> then

00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:05.030 
the question at combinations and then

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:07.570 
the question at combinations and then
you've<00:04:05.180> got<00:04:05.360> to<00:04:05.480> allow<00:04:05.680> let-up<00:04:06.680> fair<00:04:07.070> sources

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
you've got to allow let-up fair sources

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.700 
you've got to allow let-up fair sources
to<00:04:07.700> keep<00:04:07.880> their<00:04:08.060> confidence<00:04:08.540> if<00:04:08.960> you<00:04:09.290> put

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:09.710 
to keep their confidence if you put

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:11.170 
to keep their confidence if you put
combination<00:04:10.250> after<00:04:10.340> combination<00:04:10.640> all<00:04:11.090> the

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
combination after combination all the

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:12.490 
combination after combination all the
way<00:04:11.300> through<00:04:11.570> it<00:04:11.720> becomes<00:04:12.020> very<00:04:12.230> difficult

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
way through it becomes very difficult

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:15.690 
way through it becomes very difficult
and<00:04:13.010> here<00:04:13.520> we've<00:04:13.700> got<00:04:13.730> a<00:04:14.120> couple<00:04:14.840> of<00:04:15.110> hedges

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
and here we've got a couple of hedges

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.150 
and here we've got a couple of hedges
narrow<00:04:16.700> fences<00:04:17.299> on<00:04:17.750> a<00:04:17.810> bending<00:04:18.500> three<00:04:18.769> strides

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:19.160 
narrow fences on a bending three strides

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.790 
narrow fences on a bending three strides
and<00:04:19.459> so<00:04:20.209> again<00:04:20.450> accuracy<00:04:21.080> required<00:04:21.440> there

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:23.800 
and so again accuracy required there

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:28.440 
and so again accuracy required there
along<00:04:24.800> the<00:04:24.980> track<00:04:25.220> here<00:04:25.550> racing<00:04:26.330> the<00:04:26.420> cars<00:04:27.310> and

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
along the track here racing the cars and

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:31.240 
along the track here racing the cars and
then<00:04:29.450> we've<00:04:29.600> got<00:04:29.810> this<00:04:29.960> new<00:04:30.260> combination<00:04:30.560> down

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:31.250 
then we've got this new combination down

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.920 
then we've got this new combination down
in<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.520> bottom<00:04:31.820> corner<00:04:32.240> here<00:04:32.270> downhill

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
in the bottom corner here downhill

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.020 
in the bottom corner here downhill
approach<00:04:33.290> and<00:04:33.560> it's<00:04:33.980> too<00:04:34.190> big<00:04:34.370> ditches<00:04:34.850> with

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.030 
approach and it's too big ditches with

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:37.840 
approach and it's too big ditches with
upright<00:04:35.690> rails<00:04:35.990> behind<00:04:36.470> and<00:04:36.740> I<00:04:37.340> expect<00:04:37.760> the

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:37.850 
upright rails behind and I expect the

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.060 
upright rails behind and I expect the
horses<00:04:38.300> and<00:04:38.510> riders<00:04:38.720> here<00:04:39.080> to<00:04:39.290> angle<00:04:39.800> with

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
horses and riders here to angle with

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.280 
horses and riders here to angle with
those<00:04:40.340> two<00:04:40.490> fences<00:04:41.000> and<00:04:41.210> go<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:41.960> three

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:42.290 
those two fences and go on three

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:44.350 
those two fences and go on three
committed<00:04:42.740> strides<00:04:43.100> we'll<00:04:43.760> see<00:04:43.910> the<00:04:44.030> odd<00:04:44.150> one

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:44.360 
committed strides we'll see the odd one

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:46.530 
committed strides we'll see the odd one
that<00:04:44.570> might<00:04:44.720> do<00:04:44.900> a<00:04:44.930> bending<00:04:45.380> line<00:04:45.530> of<00:04:45.710> four<00:04:45.980> but

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
that might do a bending line of four but

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.030 
that might do a bending line of four but
again<00:04:47.540> you're<00:04:47.690> concentrating<00:04:48.230> on<00:04:48.620> the<00:04:48.770> clock

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:49.040 
again you're concentrating on the clock

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.190 
again you're concentrating on the clock
and<00:04:49.250> trying<00:04:49.490> to<00:04:49.640> save<00:04:49.910> time<00:04:50.210> so<00:04:50.510> I<00:04:50.810> would

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
and trying to save time so I would

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.659 
and trying to save time so I would
imagine<00:04:51.380> that<00:04:51.650> most<00:04:52.010> of<00:04:52.130> the<00:04:52.190> riders<00:04:52.370> will<00:04:52.640> go

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:52.669 
imagine that most of the riders will go

00:04:52.669 --> 00:04:54.970 
imagine that most of the riders will go
and<00:04:52.940> through<00:04:53.150> there<00:04:53.419> and<00:04:54.290> then<00:04:54.440> again<00:04:54.710> through

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:54.980 
and through there and then again through

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:58.510 
and through there and then again through
the<00:04:55.130> canola<00:04:56.020> now<00:04:57.020> the<00:04:57.080> letter<00:04:57.380> fence<00:04:57.800> is<00:04:58.130> a<00:04:58.250> big

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:58.520 
the canola now the letter fence is a big

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:00.850 
the canola now the letter fence is a big
box<00:04:58.730> with<00:04:58.880> some<00:04:59.180> brush<00:04:59.450> on<00:04:59.600> the<00:04:59.720> top<00:04:59.750> and<00:05:00.200> then

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
box with some brush on the top and then

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.060 
box with some brush on the top and then
a<00:05:00.890> nice<00:05:01.510> meandering<00:05:02.510> line<00:05:03.260> down<00:05:03.650> through<00:05:03.680> the

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
a nice meandering line down through the

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.270 
a nice meandering line down through the
crops<00:05:04.340> the<00:05:05.210> track<00:05:06.050> here<00:05:06.290> is<00:05:06.410> new<00:05:06.650> grass<00:05:06.919> so

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
crops the track here is new grass so

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.040 
crops the track here is new grass so
it's<00:05:07.790> only<00:05:08.000> had<00:05:08.240> since<00:05:08.450> April<00:05:08.810> to<00:05:08.900> get

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:09.050 
it's only had since April to get

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:11.170 
it's only had since April to get
developed<00:05:09.530> but<00:05:10.190> it's<00:05:10.310> already<00:05:10.550> looking<00:05:11.000> good

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
developed but it's already looking good

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.330 
developed but it's already looking good
but<00:05:11.419> it's<00:05:11.570> I<00:05:11.900> think<00:05:12.169> next<00:05:12.740> year<00:05:12.860> will<00:05:13.040> be<00:05:13.070> even

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
but it's I think next year will be even

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.730 
but it's I think next year will be even
better<00:05:13.520> and<00:05:13.880> then<00:05:13.970> we<00:05:14.060> turn<00:05:14.270> over<00:05:14.600> the<00:05:14.750> crop

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:15.740 
better and then we turn over the crop

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:19.390 
better and then we turn over the crop
trailer<00:05:16.250> to<00:05:17.090> the<00:05:17.210> votes<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:17.810> then<00:05:18.370> what<00:05:19.370> I

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
trailer to the votes and then what I

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.920 
trailer to the votes and then what I
think<00:05:19.700> is<00:05:19.790> the<00:05:19.910> most<00:05:20.090> difficult<00:05:20.270> fence<00:05:20.660> in<00:05:20.840> the

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
think is the most difficult fence in the

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.550 
think is the most difficult fence in the
course<00:05:21.140> the<00:05:21.290> coffin<00:05:21.680> a<00:05:21.880> big<00:05:22.880> log<00:05:23.750> land<00:05:24.320> and<00:05:24.500> a

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
course the coffin a big log land and a

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.220 
course the coffin a big log land and a
very<00:05:24.860> steep<00:05:25.130> downhill<00:05:25.669> over<00:05:25.880> four<00:05:26.810> foot<00:05:27.020> six

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:27.230 
very steep downhill over four foot six

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.770 
very steep downhill over four foot six
ditch<00:05:27.950> two<00:05:28.550> strides<00:05:28.850> back<00:05:29.180> up<00:05:29.390> the<00:05:29.510> hill<00:05:29.630> to

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
ditch two strides back up the hill to

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:32.560 
ditch two strides back up the hill to
this<00:05:29.900> very<00:05:30.230> skinny<00:05:30.590> sea<00:05:30.890> element<00:05:31.340> I<00:05:31.700> think

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
this very skinny sea element I think

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.940 
this very skinny sea element I think
what<00:05:32.780> probably<00:05:33.230> will<00:05:33.380> be<00:05:33.530> one<00:05:33.560> of<00:05:33.800> the<00:05:33.860> most

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:33.950 
what probably will be one of the most

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.770 
what probably will be one of the most
influential<00:05:34.430> fences<00:05:35.060> on<00:05:35.210> the<00:05:35.300> course<00:05:35.540> and

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
influential fences on the course and

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.390 
influential fences on the course and
certainly<00:05:35.990> one<00:05:36.710> that's<00:05:36.740> gonna<00:05:37.040> give<00:05:37.280> the

00:05:37.390 --> 00:05:37.400 
certainly one that's gonna give the

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.950 
certainly one that's gonna give the
riders<00:05:37.700> a<00:05:37.730> bit<00:05:37.880> of<00:05:37.970> a<00:05:38.030> headache<00:05:38.210> the<00:05:38.780> night

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
riders a bit of a headache the night

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:40.400 
riders a bit of a headache the night
before<00:05:39.110> cross<00:05:39.470> country

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:40.410 
before cross country

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:42.980 
before cross country
and<00:05:40.590> then<00:05:41.040> we<00:05:41.190> galloped<00:05:41.790> back<00:05:42.060> up<00:05:42.630> the<00:05:42.810> hill

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 
and then we galloped back up the hill

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:45.140 
and then we galloped back up the hill
and<00:05:43.530> another<00:05:43.980> lesser<00:05:44.250> fence<00:05:44.670> in<00:05:44.880> between

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
and another lesser fence in between

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:46.790 
and another lesser fence in between
these<00:05:45.300> beautiful<00:05:45.780> trees<00:05:45.960> but<00:05:46.380> you<00:05:46.410> can<00:05:46.620> see

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:46.800 
these beautiful trees but you can see

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.130 
these beautiful trees but you can see
the<00:05:47.070> shadow<00:05:47.340> on<00:05:47.610> this<00:05:47.790> fence<00:05:48.030> depends<00:05:48.960> on<00:05:49.050> the

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:49.140 
the shadow on this fence depends on the

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:50.990 
the shadow on this fence depends on the
time<00:05:49.320> of<00:05:49.350> day<00:05:49.680> when<00:05:49.920> you're<00:05:50.130> going<00:05:50.490> and<00:05:50.730> then

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:51.000 
time of day when you're going and then
