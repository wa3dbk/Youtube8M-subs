00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:12.599
 saha him the geeks and the geekettes these 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.540
 videos was I hope you're fine 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:18.990
 this part point that we go ppp between na 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:21.869
 master key elliott 199 of croco furio 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.960
 against and ferrade who were there at 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.029
 level 200 of the handsome server hoist so I 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.449
 think it's going to be a pretty fight 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:32.130
 naughty as the yop 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:34.500
 of course it's the class nag 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.790
 par excellence but did it when I 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:41.070
 think that those in the state is 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:45.030
 nag also the iop that boosts with 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:49.010
 mastery of the sword and petty fine he has 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.010
 launched as thick of fate 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:56.970
 we capture destiny that will be boosted in 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.950
 two rounds when he will have the damage 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.780
 extra in two rounds when he 

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.180
 will raise ep of the destiny that you can do 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.240
 badly enough did it when it happened 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.720
 in mummified mode directly from the beginnings 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:12.420
 portion 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:14.130
 mummification so it gives him 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:17.810
 additional damage and it reduces 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:21.750
 13 damage for two rounds 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.230
 on the other hand he can no longer teleport oh 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.630
 the la 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.940
 keystrokes Xelor it's 300 damage 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.650
 though the slowdown that bodega 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:29.970
 allows to remove two pairs to his 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.700
 opponent followed by a sword stroke 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:34.260
 swindler I told you a zephyr had 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.300
 his strong hit there he did it anyway 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.900
 very big damages 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:42.119
 so we have a fire iop apparently 

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:46.250
 rainfall to squarely cast olala 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.250
 550 damage with his putsch 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.130
 sorry for the update of 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:56.240
 the antivirus I do not even know if I have 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.560
 dreamed threshold is to disable that but good 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.890
 it may not work where he 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.230
 there is an update I know more finally 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:06.060
 short so the gop on the other hand who will 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:08.210
 find with at least father turn 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.210
 following 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.760
 because of his rush there he has more 

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:18.970
 that 2000 points of life 300 damage with 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:23.200
 the strike was aimed at gold zephyr had who 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.670
 at 2200 points of life a little 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.520
 slowdown that does not pass that 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.590
 so remove no pea or yop and occe 

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:34.000
 as soon as they go to the other end 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:37.410
 of the map and the yacht that would recover 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.410
 800 health points with its vitality 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.090
 by the way it's weird the xsara 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:47.250
 may have been able to stay there and do it 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.740
 teleportation to the tower after just the 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.560
 iop did not have a lot of pea because 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.210
 of the loss of po in fact when he years 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.580
 rush for those who know 

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:59.400
 not good when he throws ilian dpa 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:01.470
 but in the next lap, he loses some 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.820
 knows that if a iop launches rainfall 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.150
 in the next lap it will not be big 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.430
 thing 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.430
 he loses 4 pea I believe in the lap after 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.960
 good after that and who can still 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:12.750
 can still hit it's true that 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.200
 even if they lost father he 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.630
 rest 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.670
 it's not there as a tale either 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:23.340
 with zero point oh there there the iop that goes 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.650
 at the top with his good next to the 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:33.420
 museum from then on 2740 points of life 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:36.710
 we have the iop at 2350 good good strength of 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.710
 knock diop anyway 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:40.599
 the gas is gold can not unseal it 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.769
 it is that if they could unseat him 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.099
 it would change a lot of things 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:50.280
 since there is the vitality the vitality that 

00:03:45.099 --> 00:03:56.440
 make him 823 points of life 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:04:00.190
 extra sword 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:02.970
 second 310 and 340 damage there barely 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.970
 at 1700 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:10.510
 by accessing 1200 watts 1200 of the rest 

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:12.760
 five pairs the opposite their good so he 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:15.640
 can do stuff a tp I think that 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.470
 it is not available but he can he can 

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:19.000
 to leave in any case he can 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:21.370
 to go to avoid listening to body at 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.030
 body he relieves justin peace with his 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.910
 slow-down 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.680
 in my opinion it will not be enough 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:30.790
 second vitality diop which is 

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:33.130
 now at 2500 points of life a 

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:38.530
 small power to boost 350 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:42.910
 additional power but the 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:44.500
 gunner is still there he at 1170 he does 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:49.290
 a little dedication to boost yourself 

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:54.940
 level of pea a mastery of the sword 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:57.250
 he remains eight pea I would be him I 

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.940
 will flee but hey we'll see how he 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:02.410
 do it there it stays in me to mummify 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.360
 is a blow of the sword the bear in blow 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.690
 criticism that makes 430 damage on his 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:06.690
 opponent 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.180
 he takes himself 240 with a sword stroke 280 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:16.360
 a second sword stroke and maybe a 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.100
 little third no rush he 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.850
 remain eight lose or yop 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:24.880
 it is ep of fate 530 damage very 

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:27.460
 beautiful sword of destiny it remains more than 

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.720
 120 health on the wings and I 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.290
 think it's going to be the end for him 

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:36.070
 cut dionne 75 damage 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:38.920
 he stays 40 7 health ok so he 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.980
 gets out he gets out he is still 

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.980
 living 

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:47.320
 even though he has bigger things at the same 

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.020
 time there it is reached at the pas de bol it 

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:52.990
 made a critical failure with his sword there 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:56.860
 the yacht which has only 1200 points of 

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:58.120
 life is a pity for exor if he had 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.480
 Critically hits each shot 

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:00.130
 sword 

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:03.190
 he might have been able to kill 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:06.670
 yop saw that with the turn before with his shot 

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:07.900
 of sword he had made 430 and well into 

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.570
 three sword strikes he could have killed 

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:13.030
 llop there that was at 1100 1200 points of 

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.740
 life so the shrine that must be well 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:17.229
 disappointed to have made his purchase critical 

00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:18.580
 the osm at that moment pile on last 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:21.550
 tower where he was trying to kill his 

00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:23.009
 adversary when it happens we start 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:25.589
 sometimes fight 

00:06:23.009 --> 00:06:27.479
 he will catch up later but there 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:29.669
 when it happens at that moment it does not 

00:06:27.479 --> 00:06:31.499
 do not forgive but good after it's true 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:33.990
 critical failures are part of the game 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:36.719
 so you have to expect it happens 

00:06:33.990 --> 00:06:38.849
 regularly even though it must be good 

00:06:36.719 --> 00:06:41.219
 still a little annoying to guide him 

00:06:38.849 --> 00:06:44.539
 then on this one there thanks to you for having 

00:06:41.219 --> 00:06:44.539
 follow the video and see you soon
