00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.660
 it was very quiet on Monday morning 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.250
 future after losing points at home 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.440
 the mood is of course always something 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.700
 printed but ajax 8 to 0 0 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.859
 a large part of the selection from 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.420
 fly to their national team 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.160
 the players who were there had the 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.670
 time to think back 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.320
 Sunday also ricardo van rhijn 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.840
 the disappointment was absolutely there 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.880
 of course bacon and a good team 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.019
 what you say and have indeed 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.059
 the last few times it was difficult but 

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:34.890
 does not mean that you are in your own 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:36.480
 arena just then make sure you get the 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.399
 boss and don't let it start there 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.129
 and that is one for that matter 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:43.410
 good night and offered the chance to be one 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.059
 make short that absence and that and then 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.020
 you can look your best even made himself 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.820
 don't draw 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.039
 why ajax did not score was perhaps 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.370
 the 38th minute and attack in which the 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.559
 assumption and the pass just fell short 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.850
 at that moment the choice is a burden 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.219
 think good let had the wrong 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.530
 assumption therefore had to think of something else 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:03.510
 and then the police just came to me 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.430
 my sentence zumba adorn something too hard 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.170
 making it no longer well behind 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.450
 balconies that can't get out of it 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.220
 and there I would said at that time 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.689
 always the rusty one of it 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.130
 him race in between 

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.290
 well that is indeed a shame that was 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.520
 been a great possibility 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.990
 if you offered because the right one 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.790
 I would have speed 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.110
 but we can place better 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.909
 I think there it was just difficult 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.380
 because we build with speed in mind 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:26.700
 can actually approach me 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.200
 it is that typical of that competition 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.600
 up to just that little alignment is that 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.530
 maybe yes a goal not late 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.299
 to happen 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:34.890
 yes maybe it's a small detail 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.119
 indeed once again if like that 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.950
 receipt might be a bit softer 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:39.299
 then it is better to place it 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.369
 maybe a goal maybe not that 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.960
 Of course you never know that well 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:44.070
 they had the little things that those 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.340
 just make the difference 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.229
 I think it was missing there 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.790
 through the international matches last weekend 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.590
 trains van rijn this week with only one 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:55.590
 handful of fellow players but whether that is 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:58.530
 annoying is no, I think a good sign 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.360
 means we have a lot of guys with 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.640
 who are away with the national team 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.320
 that is a good thing in this it is then 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.119
 after 100 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.619
 great that everyone is gone or is that 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.629
 annoying 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.400
 well i guess for most it 

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:13.520
 what is nice to get back in one 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.040
 to be a different environment of course 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.630
 at also very soon back with with 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.880
 the group together but well i guess 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:21.470
 eventually a rest period at 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:23.090
 Ajax teeth with the players moving away 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.220
 that is just as good for that 

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.870
 for those who are gone and that is 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.130
 just for one 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.750
 being able to work in a different environment 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.190
 can focus and play matches and 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.710
 finally with again next week 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.290
 fresh and fruity can come back and 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.030
 how is that there is period for you 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.710
 well i just train of course 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.410
 this would futures with those 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.020
 yet those that are left behind and good for it 

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.360
 it just matters to me to be tasty 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.040
 continue to train hard and 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.990
 ultimately focus on 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.160
 on upcoming matches of course that 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:53.270
 who shave for the 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.380
 schedule 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:56.360
 we through it it was safe for you we 

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:58.190
 go by well gone after it is it is 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:00.140
 certainly nice to sit in it rip 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:02.650
 of two games at least a week 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.640
 anyway i must honestly say with 

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:05.900
 because he may have complaints that I am in 

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.850
 the beginning of season that it had 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:09.620
 also very tasty for how one 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.990
 nothing to have no competition for a weekend 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:13.490
 so that is a super nice for 

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:16.390
 the body I think comes anything 

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.390
 quieter program
