00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.469
 here so 3d what is that behind it 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.469
 the head series 

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.070
 Hello and welcome to one 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:25.160
 new app review i want you today 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.900
 snapshot 13 38 before 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.000
 hm that's a snapshot of a lot 

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:34.790
 the graphic has changed so some 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.449
 graphic bugs has also fixed the bucks 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:42.800
 So what shadow As some also 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:49.370
 is now live at superstars 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:53.239
 function and indeed and now comes 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:57.290
 different sounds and yes we can see 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.769
 the graphics changed so it 

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:02.839
 you can argue how to do that 

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:06.409
 I should not find it though 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:09.229
 but it may be necessary 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:10.760
 a step into an integrated shay 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:14.600
 todd then do not know 

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:24.140
 because shaders are going to be as good as possible 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:30.350
 could be so 3d this is the theater 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:34.340
 On the head Schiris does not love me 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:38.649
 Age yes then there is still here 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.170
 this solar wants to play with it well 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:44.539
 I do not think so bad 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:47.210
 this this is going on here 

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:50.079
 you could be a shepherd 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.509
 pretty cool to use in the recording 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:57.590
 it's so blurry or god I 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:01:58.850
 just test them here as well 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:00.799
 by yes that's a bit sharper 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:05.469
 I think that's not so bad 

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:10.990
 I have to say rain he wanted to go ahead 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:10.990
 Forest like many, yes, yes 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:19.190
 okay that's why 8 build like that is 

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:22.220
 so people without glasses without visual strength 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:25.350
 which also still blurry 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.890
 yes it is normal again 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:32.160
 now this a successful system 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:34.020
 Little improved and though you look 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:37.190
 now a success or if you are now 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:42.060
 a success beckons which do with him 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.100
 it seems in the chat all messages and 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.210
 Feast the entire equipment to the five 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:47.970
 weapons and if you by car 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.980
 over-rated success is still almost 4 1 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:52.340
 maybe for the multiple thought 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.570
 in future give it more successes 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.890
 the attitude has changed as well 

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.780
 and if we are in the 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.000
 Graphics settings go here 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.340
 something new with map levels and 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.440
 entropic filtering that you know 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.240
 probably from other games and 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.470
 So that's why it's the graphics 

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:09.780
 little hard to do 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.910
 here, too, something has changed here 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.590
 now stands view to the chance 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.050
 board hear the distance or 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.430
 sight was and so on and so forth 

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.670
 now you can do that depending on the 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.470
 flippers want to show is whether 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:24.810
 the possibility of maps to the wall too 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:27.450
 pack now is necessary I know unfortunately 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:29.430
 not yet there are pictures and the 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.710
 show that a card is at one 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.080
 block and there is larger but 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.880
 unfortunately I still have a chance 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.860
 not figured out I do not know if it 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.420
 already integrated in this snapshot 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.070
 has been 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.720
 yes so much for the snapshot if you 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.890
 something else in this snapshot 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:45.960
 noticed and the others 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:47.430
 then information about the snapshot has 

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.200
 Write it in the comments there 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.190
 I would be very happy 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:52.190
 see you, bye
