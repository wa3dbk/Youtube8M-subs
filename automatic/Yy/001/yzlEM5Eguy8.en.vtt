00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.960
 very good everyone 

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:15.950
 and good we have here 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:30.449
 the first also the third tells us not 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.580
 you catch it, take something else and good to 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.379
 obviously he takes the minstrel 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 they catch warwick jungle clear that yes 

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:38.760
 we have two jungle terol and they put 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.979
 obviously the all up complains but of course 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.260
 says hello I have a great idea something I will do 

00:00:40.979 --> 00:00:45.330
 Of course I'm going, I'm also jungle and what 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.159
 yes well done because we do not have three 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:48.900
 jungles and the other one that is going to play and I 

00:00:47.159 --> 00:00:51.900
 I shit on the fucking mother of the three and 

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:57.260
 then the enemy tetris is macho 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.260
 why the fuck but with this 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:10.230
 assholes that is above 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:12.600
 and not only that, but that they win us 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:14.340
 we are three jungles that do not 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.260
 they have gone down not even a damn time to the 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.630
 boat line to help the least 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.820
 surprisingly at minute nine he decides 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.860
 down to create a damn time so 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:26.369
 less winds although I could have 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:27.750
 left to the downside since at least 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.340
 we got a death but we already know 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:30.300
 that this game to throw towers not because 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.619
 well at least we are 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.600
 doing well we are pulling all the 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.369
 zones of them so at least something 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.130
 well we are doing but good then 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.420
 we caught once prevented area that 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.940
 I thought it looks red but then 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.229
 obviously the wolf catches her always as 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.820
 it was requested that it has appeared red all not 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:46.290
 we know the story although we always 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.060
 they count badly you always have to present them 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.050
 it ends up dying we all know that good 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:53.970
 so it kills sonar we start killing them 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:55.020
 surprisingly I do not know how I do not know how 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.649
 the formula is 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.329
 of a metal in this starts to work 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.399
 are falling as sought after are 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:05.219
 falling all the towers we get 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:07.950
 kill everyone or it is working 3 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:09.209
 You must know that I expect it to be the same 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.860
 these you have some geniuses have been 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:13.530
 invented a new goal that you invented to 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.690
 know and good again we caught a 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.110
 Little Red Riding Hood after coming to where 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:20.040
 you go for god and of course this average 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.049
 we take advantage we also catch here 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.900
 a few we already take advantage to finish 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.519
 with them tell Harvard that he throws himself 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.650
 die because he dies to death because he does not 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.060
 will feel something else and from afar come 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.620
 trying to save the game tomorrow not 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:34.410
 they can do nothing because this is over 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:37.620
 already surprisingly we have won with 

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.170
 three jungles and for my part at least 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.360
 on my part because on the part of the 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.709
 list will not be isolated from the record 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.630
 because there you see it as you want 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:47.069
 import them but for my part they are going to 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:49.620
 get rid of the report because they have 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:53.970
 surprised the three jungles and I know what 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.299
 deserve a greeting to all and even the 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.299
 next 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:04.070
 the diet 

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.480
 to load cillian one minute after 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:07.070
 that they kill their partner they go to a 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.450
 death per minute is that you are 

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:10.450
 torpedoes but good
