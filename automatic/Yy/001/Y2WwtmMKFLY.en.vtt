measured and sized is literally by the

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.380 
measured and sized is literally by the
inches<00:00:55.590> around<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.129> wet<00:00:56.309> wrist<00:00:56.730> you<00:00:57.180> take<00:00:57.360> a

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
inches around your wet wrist you take a

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:58.670 
inches around your wet wrist you take a
tape<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.780> you<00:00:57.840> measure<00:00:58.020> the<00:00:58.230> circumference

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
tape and you measure the circumference

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
of your wrist and that is the band that

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.580 
of your wrist and that is the band that
you<00:01:00.600> order<00:01:00.870> you<00:01:01.199> want<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.410> get<00:01:01.500> a<00:01:01.530> little

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
you order you want to get a little

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.160 
you order you want to get a little
looser<00:01:01.890> by<00:01:02.789> one<00:01:03.030> inch<00:01:03.210> above<00:01:03.480> because<00:01:03.840> as<00:01:04.019> they

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
looser by one inch above because as they

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719 
looser by one inch above because as they
get<00:01:04.379> wet<00:01:04.589> they<00:01:04.860> will<00:01:05.040> shrink<00:01:05.280> a<00:01:05.369> little<00:01:05.489> bit

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
get wet they will shrink a little bit

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:07.100 
get wet they will shrink a little bit
supposedly<00:01:06.090> they<00:01:06.240> will<00:01:06.390> stretch<00:01:06.600> out<00:01:06.810> again

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
supposedly they will stretch out again

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.530 
supposedly they will stretch out again
but<00:01:07.890> I<00:01:07.950> would<00:01:08.400> just<00:01:08.610> go<00:01:08.729> for<00:01:08.939> the<00:01:09.000> size<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
but I would just go for the size that

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.560 
but I would just go for the size that
you<00:01:09.600> know<00:01:09.869> one<00:01:10.700> step<00:01:11.700> up<00:01:11.939> so<00:01:12.119> if<00:01:12.180> you're<00:01:12.299> seven
