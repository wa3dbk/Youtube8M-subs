the thing that makes this game very
special<00:03:14.250> to<00:03:14.370> me<00:03:14.400> is<00:03:14.549> because<00:03:15.560> when<00:03:16.560> you<00:03:16.650> get

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
special to me is because when you get

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:18.380 
special to me is because when you get
energy<00:03:17.250> tech<00:03:17.400> we're<00:03:17.549> here<00:03:17.700> is<00:03:17.880> we<00:03:17.910> find<00:03:18.209> you

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
energy tech we're here is we find you

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:19.789 
energy tech we're here is we find you
make<00:03:18.540> it<00:03:18.660> and<00:03:18.810> each<00:03:18.900> other<00:03:19.079> it<00:03:19.170> doesn't<00:03:19.260> reset

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
make it and each other it doesn't reset

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.830 
make it and each other it doesn't reset
the<00:03:19.920> board<00:03:20.130> so<00:03:20.970> how<00:03:21.060> much<00:03:21.180> air<00:03:21.390> is<00:03:21.420> no<00:03:21.570> draft

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the board so how much air is no draft

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.660 
the board so how much air is no draft
board<00:03:22.140> it's<00:03:22.470> all<00:03:22.620> going<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:22.799> be<00:03:22.859> a<00:03:22.920> rare<00:03:23.190> car<00:03:23.459> or

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
board it's all going to be a rare car or

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.990 
board it's all going to be a rare car or
a<00:03:23.730> boost<00:03:24.000> card<00:03:24.590> someone<00:03:25.590> picks<00:03:25.769> up<00:03:25.890> two<00:03:26.040> cards

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:29.000 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.849 

yeah<00:03:30.000> so<00:03:30.690> the<00:03:30.810> energy<00:03:30.989> one<00:03:31.200> doesn't<00:03:31.470> reset<00:03:31.769> the

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:31.859 
yeah so the energy one doesn't reset the

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:34.569 
yeah so the energy one doesn't reset the
board<00:03:32.299> so<00:03:33.299> that's<00:03:33.750> why<00:03:33.900> i<00:03:33.930> like<00:03:34.109> about<00:03:34.380> this
