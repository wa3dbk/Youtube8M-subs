pretty challenging and especially in the

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:28.800 
pretty challenging and especially in the

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.210 
honest I did have this game when I was a
kid<00:04:38.080> so<00:04:38.320> there<00:04:38.470> might<00:04:38.650> be<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:38.860> bit<00:04:39.070> of<00:04:39.160> a

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:39.220 
kid so there might be a bit of a

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.480 
kid so there might be a bit of a
nostalgia<00:04:39.880> factor<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.620> think<00:04:42.039> that<00:04:42.280> pretty

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
nostalgia factor but I think that pretty
