how to make this very simple model of a
jet<00:00:05.700> plane<00:00:09.559> first<00:00:10.559> thing<00:00:10.740> I'm<00:00:10.860> going<00:00:10.980> to<00:00:11.040> do<00:00:11.219> is

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
jet plane first thing I'm going to do is

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:16.160 
jet plane first thing I'm going to do is
delete<00:00:12.179> the<00:00:12.690> default<00:00:12.929> cube<00:00:14.630> then<00:00:15.630> I'm<00:00:15.960> going

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
delete the default cube then I'm going

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.929 
delete the default cube then I'm going
to<00:00:16.199> change<00:00:16.560> the<00:00:16.890> view<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.330> view<00:00:18.690> and
