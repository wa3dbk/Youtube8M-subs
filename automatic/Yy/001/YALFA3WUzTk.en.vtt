00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.420
 one 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.660
 hello kids welcome one more day 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.920
 play is for our chest 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.470
 good first of all what we need 

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:31.470
 they are pliers to cut 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 scissors 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:39.930
 plastic plate 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.750
 a metal mesh or a piece a piece 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.750
 metal mesh 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.350
 a punch 

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.809
 and a plastic bottle 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:06.270
 well we take the metal mesh and the 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.920
 we wind up so we cut it and roll it up 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.490
 this way we can hook it two 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:14.210
 doing some folds 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.210
 and here we have it 

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.650
 then we count the bottle on top 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:23.650
 and below 

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:27.850
 let's stay like a kind of tube 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:39.560
 if we cut the little step slowly 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.560
 and now below 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:48.110
 we already have the bottle 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.110
 inside the mesh 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:55.560
 and we leave 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:58.240
 well we make the holes in 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.259
 the bottle for 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:06.470
 put leftover kebabs us 

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:08.330
 on both sides of the mesh 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.530
 with the punch with the help of the punch 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.530
 carefully 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.959
 If I'm children, always do it with the 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.959
 presence of a greater 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:24.250
 he is an adult 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:28.290
 of an adult because this seems like 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.290
 find a danger like that 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:34.220
 Well, we're going to make some holes 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.220
 slowly 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.110
 efe 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.110
 we keep making holes 

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.640
 and good always with care 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:58.069
 and above all good memory 

00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.680
 we adjust the 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.280
 metal mesh around 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:06.849
 always leaving 22 spaces good a 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.849
 space to come out of the seed 

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.849
 evidently 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.320
 well we wind up like this around the 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.320
 bottle 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.730
 we adjusted it pretty much 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:30.000
 whenever they have left 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.180
 a square for the seed to come out 

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.890
 then with a marker we mark 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.310
 the points to make the holes in the 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.310
 plate 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:40.830
 with careful 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:48.400
 that is centered as well as possible 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.400
 in centered 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.499
 and we are marking 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:59.910
 we are marking the points 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.260
 and there it is 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.630
 more or less so it was a little bit 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:15.710
 regular but good 

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:20.079
 well then we make the holes 

00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:23.980
 on the plate with the help of the punch 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:27.550
 and very carefully this requires 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:30.390
 please pray silence for 

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.390
 concentration 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:40.279
 It seems silly to 

00:04:36.529 --> 00:04:43.580
 to ramÃ³n the holes and here we have 

00:04:40.279 --> 00:04:48.700
 how is the invention 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.540
 at the end more about holes of 4 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.540
 more or less 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:57.420
 all right 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:59.280
 so I have hooked down they get 

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:02.190
 the 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:05.970
 the little pieces of wire below 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.250
 and it hooks up and in the the bottle too 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.650
 they are making little holes with the same 

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:13.260
 wire skewer 

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:16.760
 it is better to do them because with the punch 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:16.760
 it's not a little more complicated 

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:20.500
 Finally, we must give 

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:25.580
 and it remains forgiving introduction that 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.340
 is receiving messages the tip shovel 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:30.030
 for the guayas la cne ni chula rolling 

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.930
 it was good 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:37.740
 good thing we are in this case in my 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.990
 son since for the nymphs and he 

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:41.810
 congratulated by experts 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:46.180
 we miss 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:46.180
 we have we are in my son 

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:53.080
 and here we have you going to spread what 

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.080
 little by little we already see how it comes out 

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:57.940
 we see how it comes out there we fill them 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:01.380
 and this is 

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:10.110
 it is like water in a drinker according to 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:13.740
 they are going to eat it will effectively go down 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:16.350
 according to drink the water then according to eat then 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.660
 the birdseed goes down even 

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:20.850
 take more advantage 

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:25.070
 with some seeds the birdseed my son 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:26.870
 whatever it is here we have it as mercy 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.530
 then he also puts some hooks 

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:29.530
 above 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:37.650
 in this case I have not put a hook 

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:37.650
 up because I do not know 

00:06:38.260 --> 00:06:45.289
 but good so it was put at the beginning 

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:47.930
 here we have pulled out 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:51.430
 Julie Julia is out there lost because 

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:56.200
 has been scared and is fluttering 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:58.620
 and then it's up to the next video 

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.620
 bye Bye
