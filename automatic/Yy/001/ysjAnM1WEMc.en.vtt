00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 and people are back with fifth 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.029
 chapter of our video series on 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:08.220
 the most misunderstood verses of the 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.230
 holy bible and today I bring it to you 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.290
 a special for me that Romans chapter 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.690
 8 verse 28 that says so we know 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.119
 for all things work together for the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.400
 well of those who love God and are 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.350
 called according to their purpose 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.510
 with the intention of seeing if what the 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.580
 apostle Paul wrote in the letter to 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.500
 Romans wants to teach us here 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.730
 will it be that all things truly 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.009
 cooperate for our good 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.270
 will the tire stuck last week 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.800
 cooperated for my good 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.079
 is it that a more serious situation as a 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.149
 cancer discovered in the family a friend 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.469
 dear in my own life can 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.629
 cooperate for my sake 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 Is it superfluous what the team 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.960
 falling to the second division can 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.239
 cooperate for my sake 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.430
 Good I guess not but the truth is that 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.590
 Yes, but what is the intention? 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.660
 purpose for which you bet is 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.280
 writing this verse for this we 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.109
 we have to look at the previous verses 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.329
 the context by which this verse 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.160
 fits in previous years 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.470
 we discovered something phenomenal that 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.110
 there is a helper someone who 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.880
 intercede for us that translates our 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.290
 prayers even when we are in the midst of 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.880
 the perplexity says 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.640
 even when we are afraid of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.560
 of the causes of life there is someone who 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.590
 help in our weaknesses that is the 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:21.090
 holy spirit and also with moans 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.610
 when we 're groaning 

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:25.920
 inexpressible before God and translates 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.290
 our prayer that our prayer will be 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.540
 aligns with God's will and then when we 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.159
 we are there all things cooperate to 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.079
 The good thing now is that the flat tire 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:37.140
 cooperated that in what form the 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.299
 purpose that flat tire or this 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.740
 difficult situation in my life today is 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.979
 cooperating for my good 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:47.790
 verse 29 is the key and I would say that 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:50.670
 god in the 3 destined and did not call and 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.759
 beforehand met us so that we may 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.140
 through the situation across all 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.770
 things with workers be 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.680
 transformed into the image of the 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.880
 son or in the tire bored the team fall 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.820
 to the second division 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:08.610
 or accept anything in our life 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:11.610
 is cooperating so that we are each 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.120
 day more like jesus christ as 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.190
 is that the flat tire treats 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:17.830
 as this good shepherd maybe you had 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.980
 which is to work your patience on that 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:23.200
 At that point, perhaps the domain itself was 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:26.260
 something that you needed at that moment and 

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.090
 that situation made you more 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.340
 similar to jesus through a 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.110
 Perplexed situation as a cancer can 

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.209
 bring more trust, more faith 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.709
 faithfulness and the fruit of the spirit is 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.909
 being generated in your life 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.709
 This is what I can paulo is in 

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.530
 teaching that each situation of our 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:43.329
 life we are transforming ourselves according to 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.160
 the image of Christ today this situation 

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.170
 What are you living doing to you? 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.599
 more like jesus and she is 

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.489
 truly cooperating because you 

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.660
 He loves God and something else too 

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:55.810
 important here 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.090
 this word is for this word son 

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.709
 for disciples of Jesus Christ is not 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.349
 for people who do not know God that 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.069
 promise is only stated on the 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:05.319
 children 

00:03:03.069 --> 00:03:06.819
 those who love God and live from 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:09.459
 according to its purpose 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.940
 God bless you and see you next time. 

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.940
 jesus name
