00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.089
 hi to you friends and welcome to 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.760
 facebook cooking for the recipe 

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:11.370
 apples of love you will need two 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.920
 Chinese chopsticks of apples wash well 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.550
 two tablespoons of water a little 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.650
 little red dye of lemon and 200 g 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.529
 of sugar the first step 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:24.810
 it's going to be just poking your 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.439
 apples just like these in the 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.300
 pan 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:32.070
 we will add sugar and water and there we 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.860
 will cook up to a small 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:37.320
 amber color that comes out at 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:43.770
 caramel level and you can pour 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.420
 5 drops of red dye once 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.370
 caramel is well cooked we will come 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:52.199
 stop cooking with lemon juice 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:55.590
 you will then take the apple and 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.960
 to make her fool in the caramel and 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:00.710
 then you turn well for it 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.870
 be well coated with sugar 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:06.900
 so here is the result we have a beautiful 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.159
 love apple that is really good 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.960
 colored the sugar is hard enough what 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:13.950
 I like it allows to lick a small 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.380
 little like a lollipop 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.240
