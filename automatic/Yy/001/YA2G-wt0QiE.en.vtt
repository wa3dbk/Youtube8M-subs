00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.250
 yes 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.650
 is already very far from 2007 but that was 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.420
 the year that the witcher came into the world 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:25.450
 of video games to conquer us 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.340
 now after two deliveries a great 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.529
 fidelity with respect to the books of 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.390
 andrzej sapkowski and lots of fun 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:33.730
 it's time to finish the 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.190
 history of geralt de rivia this is what 

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.019
 what the witcher 3 proposes to us but not what 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.030
 unique the premiere of a world 

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:42.879
 completely open a graphic engine 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:45.160
 adapted to the nextgen and more than 100 hours 

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:48.629
 of play are the other bets of this 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.629
 hulking action rpg 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.239
 but there are more aspects to mention for 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.040
 course without going any further the story 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.260
 promises to be the most personal until the 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.030
 date bringing back the ghosts 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.610
 from the past that have tormented our 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.500
 protagonist in previous games that and 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:11.510
 the wild hunt that is what 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.510
 precisely gives name to this production 

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.220
 the argument is still one of 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 the most important aspects although there 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.810
 another plus the concept of open world 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.000
 narrative and freedom merge in the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.310
 witcher 3 giving rise to that experience 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.970
 rpg that the study of 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.970
 Polish origin 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.190
 Y 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.340
 the creation of a wider environment and 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:14.290
 With so many possibilities, it helps us see 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:16.690
 the saga in a more realistic way 

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.730
 the players will feel more connected 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.410
 with the environment that surrounds you without those 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.020
 narrow corridors and blocked roads 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.540
 that abounded in past titles all 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.740
 it without the script losing interest 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.630
 keeping users attached to the 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.610
 plot regardless of what they do 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.890
 play and for which it was 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.390
 asking that we do not fear we will return to 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.390
 have the capacity to decide 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:57.250
 and those consequences will have to do with 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.590
 the up to 36 final scheduled for this 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.360
 delivery so we will understand more than ever 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.610
 that the universe of the witcher is not 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.890
 white or black but full of nuances 

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:08.230
 almost as many as those present in the 

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.209
 battle system which becomes more 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.459
 intense and exciting with a camera 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:15.090
 better positioned closer to our 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.090
 protagonist 

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:28.170
 acz 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:39.540
 and pension 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:48.250
 we can not forget the possibility 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.620
 to create our own potions that 

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:52.540
 will remain valid in this work as well as the 

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.790
 opportunity to build weapons through 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.320
 the help of npcs but certainly the 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.300
 most striking aspect of all the 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.450
 together we will find it in the section 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:04.300
 vast graphic amazing and new 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:06.520
 generation red engine 3 is here and 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.360
 promises to make this rpg the biggest 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.360
 never created 

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.980

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.040
 ming 

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:40.230
 antoni esteve in short and having 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:42.420
 consider everything said and seen 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:44.700
 listened to the witcher 3 can finish 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.710
 becoming not only worthy conclusion 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.320
 of the saga but also in one of the 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.300
 best rpg of recent years the 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.100
 geralt's story of rivia reaches its 

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:54.990
 end and contemplate to the next 

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:57.630
 generation in a release that without 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:01.380

 emotions and why not up

 revolutionary
