correct position and it's usable the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.500 
correct position and it's usable the
only<00:03:06.130> issue<00:03:06.250> is<00:03:06.400> that<00:03:06.550> its<00:03:06.850> background<00:03:07.090> is

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
only issue is that its background is

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.510 
only issue is that its background is
forcedly<00:03:08.020> transparent<00:03:08.770> making<00:03:09.220> everything

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:09.520 
forcedly transparent making everything

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.990 
forcedly transparent making everything
behind<00:03:09.790> the<00:03:10.060> transparent<00:03:10.570> as<00:03:10.690> well<00:03:12.000> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
behind the transparent as well the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.580 
behind the transparent as well the
biggest<00:03:13.210> issue<00:03:13.510> I<00:03:13.900> could<00:03:14.110> find<00:03:14.380> is<00:03:14.560> that

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
biggest issue I could find is that

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.010 
biggest issue I could find is that
screen<00:03:15.040> rotation<00:03:15.340> isn't<00:03:15.700> working<00:03:16.270> but<00:03:16.900> I'm

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
screen rotation isn't working but I'm

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.500 
screen rotation isn't working but I'm
sure<00:03:17.260> it's<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:17.740> get<00:03:17.920> fixed<00:03:18.160> really<00:03:18.370> soon

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:22.510 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:24.729

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:24.739 
everything else is working and I don't

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:26.229 
everything else is working and I don't
really<00:03:24.890> think<00:03:24.980> it's<00:03:25.280> worth<00:03:25.430> losing<00:03:25.849> more<00:03:25.970> time

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
really think it's worth losing more time
