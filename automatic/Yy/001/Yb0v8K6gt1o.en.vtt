00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
go on the inner part of the lid with a

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.220 
go on the inner part of the lid with a
white<00:02:51.430> flat<00:02:53.010> powder<00:02:54.010> shadow<00:02:54.820> now<00:02:55.510> when<00:02:55.960> I<00:02:55.990> say

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
white flat powder shadow now when I say

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.020 
white flat powder shadow now when I say
why<00:02:56.440> it's<00:02:56.680> not<00:02:56.860> pure<00:02:57.100> white<00:02:57.340> it<00:02:57.490> still<00:02:57.820> has<00:02:58.000> a

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
why it's not pure white it still has a

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:59.970 
why it's not pure white it still has a
little<00:02:58.240> bit<00:02:58.510> more<00:02:58.750> warmth<00:02:59.170> in<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.500> like<00:02:59.770> the

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
little bit more warmth in it like the

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:03.030 
little bit more warmth in it like the
honey<00:03:00.630> without<00:03:01.630> the<00:03:01.780> shimmer<00:03:02.020> and<00:03:02.320> so<00:03:02.710> now<00:03:02.890> I'm

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:03.040 
honey without the shimmer and so now I'm

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.300 
honey without the shimmer and so now I'm
here<00:03:03.430> I'm<00:03:03.580> putting<00:03:03.820> a<00:03:04.440> sandy<00:03:05.440> Brown<00:03:05.800> knot<00:03:06.130> and

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
here I'm putting a sandy Brown knot and

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:08.700 
here I'm putting a sandy Brown knot and
when<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.430> say<00:03:06.670> sandy<00:03:07.180> it's<00:03:07.330> very<00:03:07.600> sandy<00:03:08.230> muted

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:08.710 
when I say sandy it's very sandy muted

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:11.970 
when I say sandy it's very sandy muted
neutral<00:03:09.400> it's<00:03:10.000> not<00:03:10.210> like<00:03:10.450> a<00:03:10.480> deep<00:03:10.810> brown<00:03:11.170> so

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:11.980 
neutral it's not like a deep brown so

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:13.980 
neutral it's not like a deep brown so
because<00:03:12.490> I<00:03:12.580> really<00:03:12.940> want<00:03:13.180> to<00:03:13.240> make<00:03:13.450> sure<00:03:13.480> that

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
because I really want to make sure that

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:16.830 
because I really want to make sure that
we're<00:03:14.170> using<00:03:14.200> this<00:03:14.680> as<00:03:14.890> a<00:03:14.920> gradiation<00:03:15.490> and<00:03:16.060> a

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
we're using this as a gradiation and a

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.660 
we're using this as a gradiation and a
way<00:03:17.050> to<00:03:17.110> really<00:03:17.590> just<00:03:17.980> pull<00:03:18.400> everything

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
way to really just pull everything

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:22.140 
way to really just pull everything
together<00:03:19.680> without<00:03:20.680> making<00:03:21.280> it<00:03:21.340> look<00:03:21.400> so<00:03:21.850> heavy

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
together without making it look so heavy

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.360 
together without making it look so heavy
and<00:03:22.600> it<00:03:23.110> should<00:03:23.320> still<00:03:23.680> come<00:03:24.010> off<00:03:24.040> very

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
and it should still come off very

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:27.210 
and it should still come off very
neutral<00:03:24.820> or<00:03:24.880> natural<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.990> so<00:03:26.620> I'm<00:03:26.710> only<00:03:26.920> adding

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:27.220 
neutral or natural so so I'm only adding

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.700 
neutral or natural so so I'm only adding
the<00:03:27.520> darker<00:03:28.000> on<00:03:28.210> the<00:03:28.240> outer<00:03:28.540> lid<00:03:28.990> and<00:03:29.290> I'm<00:03:29.470> just

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:29.710 
the darker on the outer lid and I'm just

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:32.580 
the darker on the outer lid and I'm just
doing<00:03:30.070> sort<00:03:30.370> of<00:03:30.520> like<00:03:30.700> a<00:03:30.730> Halfmoon<00:03:31.170> shadow<00:03:32.170> and

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
doing sort of like a Halfmoon shadow and

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.949 
doing sort of like a Halfmoon shadow and
then<00:03:33.130> pulling<00:03:33.459> everything<00:03:33.970> together<00:03:34.420> just

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
then pulling everything together just

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.290 
then pulling everything together just
blending<00:03:35.440> it<00:03:35.590> all<00:03:35.709> together<00:03:35.920> it<00:03:36.400> looks<00:03:36.670> really

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:37.300 
blending it all together it looks really

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:41.670 
blending it all together it looks really
beautiful<00:03:37.450> so<00:03:39.180> so<00:03:40.180> now<00:03:40.390> what<00:03:40.780> I'm<00:03:40.900> doing<00:03:41.290> here
