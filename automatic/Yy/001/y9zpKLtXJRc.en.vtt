tippet<00:00:59.089> even<00:01:00.049> when<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.199> first<00:01:00.470> started<00:01:00.860> and

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:00.979 
tippet even when I first started and

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:03.640 
tippet even when I first started and
fluorocarbon<00:01:01.670> wasn't<00:01:02.030> really<00:01:02.930> perfected<00:01:03.589> I

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:03.650 
fluorocarbon wasn't really perfected I

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:04.960 
fluorocarbon wasn't really perfected I
guess<00:01:03.860> you<00:01:03.979> could<00:01:04.100> say<00:01:04.250> we<00:01:04.430> would<00:01:04.549> use<00:01:04.670> mono

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:04.970 
guess you could say we would use mono

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:08.140 
guess you could say we would use mono
and<00:01:05.330> we<00:01:05.869> would<00:01:06.020> use<00:01:06.229> four<00:01:06.680> pound<00:01:06.950> three<00:01:07.880> pound

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
and we would use four pound three pound

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:10.450 
and we would use four pound three pound
mono<00:01:08.450> to<00:01:09.350> fish<00:01:09.560> for<00:01:09.710> these<00:01:09.770> fish<00:01:10.010> and<00:01:10.159> we<00:01:10.220> lose

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
mono to fish for these fish and we lose

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.250 
mono to fish for these fish and we lose
a<00:01:10.520> lot<00:01:10.820> of<00:01:10.850> them<00:01:11.060> but<00:01:11.659> with<00:01:11.810> the<00:01:11.930> modern

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 
a lot of them but with the modern

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.289 
a lot of them but with the modern
technology<00:01:12.520> you're<00:01:13.520> able<00:01:13.760> to<00:01:13.850> put<00:01:14.000> the<00:01:14.119> boots

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299 
technology you're able to put the boots

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:17.520 
technology you're able to put the boots
to<00:01:14.479> these<00:01:14.630> fish<00:01:14.869> and<00:01:15.110> land<00:01:15.860> them<00:01:16.040> fairly<00:01:16.460> quick

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
to these fish and land them fairly quick

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.560 
to these fish and land them fairly quick
so<00:01:18.530> we're<00:01:18.680> running<00:01:18.799> a<00:01:19.130> float<00:01:19.670> that<00:01:19.909> suspends

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
so we're running a float that suspends

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:22.630 
so we're running a float that suspends
our<00:01:20.689> flies<00:01:20.979> vertically<00:01:21.979> through<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.460> water

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
our flies vertically through the water

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.149 
our flies vertically through the water
column<00:01:22.729> so<00:01:23.390> what<00:01:23.570> this<00:01:23.719> does<00:01:23.930> for<00:01:23.960> us<00:01:24.350> it<00:01:24.950> keeps

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:25.159 
column so what this does for us it keeps

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:26.920 
column so what this does for us it keeps
us<00:01:25.310> really<00:01:25.670> tight<00:01:25.880> to<00:01:26.030> our<00:01:26.090> flies<00:01:26.359> and<00:01:26.630> we<00:01:26.689> know

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
us really tight to our flies and we know

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.950 
us really tight to our flies and we know
where<00:01:27.259> the<00:01:27.920> flies<00:01:28.189> are<00:01:28.490> at<00:01:28.609> all<00:01:28.729> times<00:01:29.060> so<00:01:29.899> you

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
where the flies are at all times so you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.419 
where the flies are at all times so you
can<00:01:30.079> kind<00:01:30.259> of<00:01:30.380> sometimes<00:01:30.679> just<00:01:30.950> walk<00:01:31.159> your

00:01:31.419 --> 00:01:31.429 
can kind of sometimes just walk your

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.849 
can kind of sometimes just walk your
flies<00:01:31.670> through<00:01:32.179> a<00:01:32.270> certain<00:01:32.570> area<00:01:32.750> fish<00:01:33.590> tight

00:01:33.849 --> 00:01:33.859 
flies through a certain area fish tight

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.889 
flies through a certain area fish tight
up<00:01:34.009> against<00:01:34.369> the<00:01:34.460> log<00:01:34.700> and<00:01:35.179> you<00:01:35.509> really<00:01:35.869> you

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:35.899 
up against the log and you really you

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:37.419 
up against the log and you really you
know<00:01:36.229> where<00:01:36.560> your<00:01:36.740> flies<00:01:36.950> are<00:01:37.159> at<00:01:37.250> at<00:01:37.369> all

00:01:37.419 --> 00:01:37.429 
know where your flies are at at all

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.849 
know where your flies are at at all
times<00:01:38.109> now<00:01:39.109> that<00:01:39.140> we<00:01:39.320> have<00:01:39.409> the<00:01:39.500> complete<00:01:39.829> set

00:01:39.849 --> 00:01:39.859 
times now that we have the complete set

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:42.249 
times now that we have the complete set
up<00:01:40.189> here's<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:40.549> we<00:01:40.700> have<00:01:40.850> up<00:01:41.539> top<00:01:41.929> here<00:01:42.109> we've

up here's what we have up top here we've

00:01:42.259 --> 00:01:45.639 
up here's what we have up top here we've
got<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.439> 40-pound<00:01:42.829> section<00:01:43.429> of<00:01:43.549> butt<00:01:44.649> followed
