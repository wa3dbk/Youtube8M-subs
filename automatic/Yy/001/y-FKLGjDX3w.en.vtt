00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.629
 okay we are men around new series a to a student who just that 

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.029
 as Louis van Gaal Card has participated and ask them how they like it 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:08.769
 Has 

00:00:08.769 --> 00:00:09.969
 the transmitters 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:13.749
 Hernandez is great I currently visit there in Austria Wool 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:18.020
 and so i found it very interesting today and i also have a lot 

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:19.949
 Get more information 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.300
 Fleischer himself would like to go to the health sector 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:28.250
 and even if and percent yes and I found that good for us today 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.500
 Once again he has informed that it is so and what they do there 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.840
 and we choose the chances so stand 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.570
 so I am a Christian at Sikorsky bundling at the time on Ulmer 

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.530
 Realschule Okt 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:41.160
 in the ninth grade 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.570
 Breker swiftly selects a meaningful question of law revision into sound 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.790
 artificially also polling Kaswin maybe 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.740
 you could still try it 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.990
 and I mean that does not hurt 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.200
 then why not play anymore 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.950
 with aquarists too so Cordes looks awkward 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.010
 Animal keepers today are also keen in the direction of UN 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.240
 So what you should do with a leash in the direction of bus lines is if he could 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.310
 since it has been done more concretely, it is also an internship in the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.870
 direction 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:13.550
 So I have manufacturing and not in the zoo and there have no release 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.120
 but I have and shelter OsnabrÃ¼ck 1 made 

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.890
 For two weeks and I really liked it as full of the ff in the 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.260
 LehrstellenbÃ¶rse ever heard something heard because for the first time I will have 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.730
 never had the law to do so 

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.530
 protest 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.150
 cooking is clear then I will log out 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.790
 APA his tirades 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:36.710
 I'm not sure if it works 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.570
 it will be replaced 

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.649
 it's always a newspaper now 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:44.149
 Ben is written that it would not hit like simple centers though 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.600
 thrown out again Visits for you Table is short 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.440
 So before graduation that she is afraid to find a job so completely 

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:51.540
 optimistic 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.710
 but i believe that i am for the kids 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.760
 Of course it's hard I have to move right away if I want something 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:01.470
 Want to go and there's not much zoo that's not Kl zol the 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.230
 world 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.380
 and yes, I have to see if I'm exactly what but I think that I what 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:09.049
 something concretely under pressure and last question around 

00:02:09.049 --> 00:02:12.469
 and that was an incredible dreary Schaefers looking around you somewhere 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:16.260
 what she already concretely percent the selected pieces to still very much on 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.939
 Beginning 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:19.079
 So I still have the time at the beginning 

00:02:19.079 --> 00:02:20.949
 and Bavaria 

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:25.049
 he is currently secured ninth grade and I'm already trying after 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:28.799
 to send the summer holidays to apply and future 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:30.059
