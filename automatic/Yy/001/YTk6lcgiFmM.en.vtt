there's<00:00:02.790> only<00:00:03.000> one<00:00:03.419> reason<00:00:03.720> why<00:00:04.680> we<00:00:04.980> would<00:00:05.189> mow

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
there's only one reason why we would mow

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.839 
there's only one reason why we would mow
grass<00:00:05.460> and<00:00:06.359> that's<00:00:07.229> two<00:00:07.769> reasons<00:00:08.189> one<00:00:08.460> reason

00:00:08.839 --> 00:00:08.849 
grass and that's two reasons one reason

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:11.270 
grass and that's two reasons one reason
is<00:00:09.000> to<00:00:09.270> allow<00:00:09.690> colorful<00:00:10.500> run<00:00:10.680> the<00:00:10.800> fruit<00:00:11.010> as

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
is to allow colorful run the fruit as

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.970 
is to allow colorful run the fruit as
its<00:00:11.610> maturing<00:00:12.150> by<00:00:12.960> not<00:00:13.170> shading<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.740> with<00:00:13.890> the

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
its maturing by not shading it with the

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.790 
its maturing by not shading it with the
grass<00:00:14.190> and<00:00:14.610> secondly<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.960> make<00:00:16.139> it<00:00:16.289> easy<00:00:16.470> for

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
grass and secondly to make it easy for

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.880 
grass and secondly to make it easy for
the<00:00:16.890> workers<00:00:17.099> to<00:00:17.430> harvest<00:00:17.789> the<00:00:17.910> fruit<00:00:18.890> by

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
the workers to harvest the fruit by

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.070 
the workers to harvest the fruit by
serendipity<00:00:20.280> I<00:00:20.730> discovered<00:00:21.420> that<00:00:21.539> by<00:00:21.750> bending

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
serendipity I discovered that by bending

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.640 
serendipity I discovered that by bending
grass<00:00:22.470> in<00:00:22.860> the<00:00:22.949> middle<00:00:23.220> of<00:00:23.310> the<00:00:23.400> season<00:00:23.610> once
