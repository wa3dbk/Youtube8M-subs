of it to get the right thickness now you
I<00:00:28.260> don't<00:00:28.529> know<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:28.980> can<00:00:29.160> see<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.580> purple

there's this little guide my chainsaw

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.700 
there's this little guide my chainsaw
bar<00:00:43.250> so<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.640> can<00:00:44.879> keep<00:00:45.090> it<00:00:45.329> an<00:00:45.710> even

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
bar so that I can keep it an even

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.830 
bar so that I can keep it an even
thickness<00:00:47.250> all<00:00:47.940> the<00:00:48.000> way<00:00:48.360> through<00:00:49.070> and<00:00:50.840> here

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
thickness all the way through and here

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:58.220 
thickness all the way through and here
we<00:00:52.050> go<00:00:54.949> you<00:00:55.949> can<00:00:56.160> see<00:00:56.430> the<00:00:56.670> wood<00:00:57.390> chips<00:00:57.750> coming

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
we go you can see the wood chips coming

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.349 
we go you can see the wood chips coming
out<00:00:59.870> it's<00:01:00.870> really<00:01:01.590> getting<00:01:01.980> getting<00:01:02.760> into<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
out it's really getting getting into the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.260 
out it's really getting getting into the
thicker<00:01:03.660> part<00:01:04.019> of<00:01:04.229> it<00:01:04.350> right<00:01:04.589> now<00:01:05.720> and<00:01:08.270> where

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
thicker part of it right now and where

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:18.200 
thicker part of it right now and where
we<00:01:09.510> go<00:01:12.290> now<00:01:14.240> you<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> down<00:01:16.070> one<00:01:17.070> side<00:01:17.490> and<00:01:18.030> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
we go now you go down one side and I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.510 
we go now you go down one side and I
mean<00:01:18.540> one<00:01:18.990> end<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:19.470> end<00:01:19.619> down<00:01:19.890> on<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.400> other

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
mean one end and end down on the other

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:24.730 
mean one end and end down on the other
end<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.140> keeps<00:01:22.140> it<00:01:22.350> from<00:01:22.880> cutting<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.270> hole

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:24.740 
end it keeps it from cutting the hole

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.320 
end it keeps it from cutting the hole
with<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.070> blade<00:01:26.310> which<00:01:26.670> puts<00:01:26.970> a<00:01:27.119> lot<00:01:27.299> of

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
with the blade which puts a lot of

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.719 
with the blade which puts a lot of
strain<00:01:27.720> on<00:01:27.990> it<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.320> you'll<00:01:28.979> see<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.250> will<00:01:29.400> come

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
strain on it and you'll see it will come

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.210 
strain on it and you'll see it will come
to<00:01:29.909> a<00:01:29.939> point<00:01:30.299> where<00:01:30.689> right<00:01:31.170> now<00:01:31.200> I'm<00:01:31.590> into<00:01:32.070> the

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
to a point where right now I'm into the

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.660 
to a point where right now I'm into the
thickest<00:01:32.729> part<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.770> you'll<00:01:34.770> maybe<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.490> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
thickest part and you'll maybe see the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.679 
thickest part and you'll maybe see the
change<00:01:36.000> slow<00:01:36.630> down<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.590> it's<00:01:38.689> cutting

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
change slow down because it's cutting

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:44.179 
change slow down because it's cutting
full<00:01:40.229> length<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.040> bar<00:01:42.049> which<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.130> okay<00:01:44.130> but

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
full length of the bar which is okay but

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.719 
full length of the bar which is okay but
so<00:01:45.140> I'll<00:01:46.140> switch<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.500> the<00:01:46.770> other<00:01:46.979> end<00:01:47.369> and<00:01:47.549> go

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
so I'll switch to the other end and go

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.600 
so I'll switch to the other end and go
up<00:01:47.880> and<00:01:48.090> down<00:01:48.180> a<00:01:48.329> few<00:01:49.009> till<00:01:50.009> we<00:01:50.189> get<00:01:50.399> through

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
up and down a few till we get through

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.789 
up and down a few till we get through
the<00:01:50.880> thickest<00:01:51.390> part<00:01:51.920> and<00:01:52.920> that's<00:01:53.880> that's<00:01:54.390> just

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
the thickest part and that's that's just

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.520 
the thickest part and that's that's just
how<00:01:55.799> it<00:01:56.009> has<00:01:56.189> to<00:01:56.369> be<00:01:56.490> done<00:01:58.610> because<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.850> is

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
how it has to be done because that is

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.090 
how it has to be done because that is
maple<00:02:01.530> which<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.520> a<00:02:02.729> very<00:02:03.149> hard<00:02:03.450> wood<00:02:03.719> and<00:02:04.100> it's

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
maple which is a very hard wood and it's

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.050 
maple which is a very hard wood and it's
a<00:02:05.219> maple<00:02:05.610> burl

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
a maple burl

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:10.580 
a maple burl
part<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.170> the<00:02:07.259> root<00:02:07.530> of<00:02:07.799> a<00:02:08.280> big<00:02:08.520> tree<00:02:08.879> that<00:02:09.590> has

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
part of the root of a big tree that has

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.610 
part of the root of a big tree that has
been<00:02:10.619> out<00:02:11.009> of<00:02:11.039> the<00:02:11.220> ground<00:02:11.489> for<00:02:11.819> years

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
been out of the ground for years

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.580 
been out of the ground for years
and<00:02:14.620> here<00:02:15.250> we<00:02:15.459> go<00:02:15.670> with<00:02:15.970> all<00:02:16.480> my<00:02:16.720> almost<00:02:17.290> I

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
and here we go with all my almost I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.030 
and here we go with all my almost I
don't<00:02:17.950> quite<00:02:18.879> cut<00:02:19.510> all<00:02:19.780> the<00:02:19.989> way<00:02:20.200> because<00:02:20.830> I

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
don't quite cut all the way because I

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.800 
don't quite cut all the way because I
want<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.430> to<00:02:21.489> be<00:02:23.129> not<00:02:24.129> be<00:02:24.430> loose<00:02:24.760> and<00:02:25.030> Wiggly<00:02:25.390> on

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
want it to be not be loose and Wiggly on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.420 
want it to be not be loose and Wiggly on
one<00:02:26.260> end<00:02:26.530> while<00:02:26.890> I<00:02:26.950> cut<00:02:27.370> the<00:02:27.550> other<00:02:27.580> end<00:02:29.430> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
one end while I cut the other end and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.479 
one end while I cut the other end and
now<00:02:30.819> we're<00:02:31.060> in<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.540> smaller<00:02:32.530> part<00:02:32.980> of<00:02:33.190> it<00:02:33.340> and

00:02:33.479 --> 00:02:33.489 
now we're in the smaller part of it and

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:37.860 
now we're in the smaller part of it and
it's<00:02:33.640> going<00:02:33.790> pretty<00:02:34.060> good<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:36.790> again<00:02:37.180> I<00:02:37.209> stop

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
it's going pretty good and again I stop

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.479 
it's going pretty good and again I stop
before<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.530> get<00:02:38.830> all<00:02:39.010> the<00:02:39.129> way<00:02:39.280> through<00:02:41.129> and<00:02:42.129> I

00:02:42.479 --> 00:02:42.489 
before I get all the way through and I
