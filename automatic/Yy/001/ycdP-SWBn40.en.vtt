00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.940
 I greet everyone and again with you mr 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:13.710
 as I continued to look 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.529
 games transformers hoping to find a new 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:21.480
 group through made by 4 of the film 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:25.980
 nothing could find there are any 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:30.390
 or for playstation but you can't write them 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:35.309
 not buying and I'm looking for free games in 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:39.110
 which can be played and pounded here 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:41.090
 found a game called transform and sometimes 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:46.379
 rally 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:52.230
 as we see on the main picture autobot 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:01:01.910
 two dunce i'm not mistaken he can 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:01:06.619
 transform racing kama bye 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.369
 no one has ever played records recorded 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:18.350
 this is understandable as I started the game and immediately 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.350
 included recording click play 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:25.290
 in the picture we see this is our main 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:31.290
 hero 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:33.290
 up on. top over point down i mean 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.659
 if we the better of him on 

00:01:33.290 --> 00:01:46.009
 transform into motorsport when down 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:46.009
 in the machine stop the car that 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:02:03.869
 We see that you can play the discipline 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:02:03.869
 drift brow bambolbi bambolbi 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:22.739
 choosing one only fly icon 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:22.739
 autobot is 10 seconds started to sit 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:41.920
 difficult and immediately understand how to play 

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.470
 Basically the graphics are pretty beautiful to me. 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.890
 It seems the game is complex Dinka at first 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:55.230
 well maybe saltpeter go on top 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:55.230
 it's hard to get used to go through all the levels 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:13.720
 like here so far the Decepticon is not 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:18.920
 could run away 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:23.230
 what we see is a black screen either game 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:28.160
 loaded or it until the end of the matter 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:30.370
 nailed another game lookin did they 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.350
 not over player 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:41.000
 she new technology then mild 5 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:46.310
 so you can play with her backup 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:50.750
 background or on and party where the flash drive can not 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:53.210
 I need to install the driver 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.730
 update any more so you see 

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:59.090
 black screen 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:01.550
 nothing happens on it my 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:04.570
 I'll finish the review now 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.660
 install update drivers 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:10.960
 either sleep learn what it is connected with all 

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:10.960
 until
