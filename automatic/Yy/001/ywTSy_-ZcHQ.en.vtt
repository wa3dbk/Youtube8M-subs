00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:19.949
 MT in this tutorial we'll talk about speed control 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.179
 and adjust options 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:24.279
 Rank weaker with death 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:28.439
 we have grown in the story two equal 14 acres with 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.079
 the arms ultra precise control is possible 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:33.540
 in the middle position, according to a study 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:36.680
 who composes an overjoyed piece 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.140
 no means a performance is for me to find 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.530
 so finding an enemy percent does not pose a problem 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.500
 The patch range is a tractor passing from 8 to 9% adjustable 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.960
 find employment 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.450
 the deadline is 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:51.830
 Wreath there 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.800
 other points 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.810
 and his comrades are the PET Shop Boys after all, the title looks like 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:01.060
 well positioned 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.960
 hereby is an amusing pleasure or playful 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.530
 Speed ​​remains 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.140
 this is very useful and second strongest of the speed 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.439
 Juergen are adapted to rejoice 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.390
 About the PTB around 50 kilos 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:18.690
 also known as a new car 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.300
 If this function is activated, the tempo can be increased without change 

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.240
 for example, very useful for chats with very distant 

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.020
 Carpet are 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.110
 Last but not least does not like this feature 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.310
 an absolutely practical feature to quickly and easily the second weakest 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.030
 then synchronize 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.860
 a lot of time to come 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.900
 a simple push of a button is high and that Rückpass would have the assessment 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:44.690
 reinforce the opposite side 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.700
 The highly flexible and pouring process shifts for these projects
