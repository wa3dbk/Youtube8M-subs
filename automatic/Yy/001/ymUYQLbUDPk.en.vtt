00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:20.810 
with another RC review this one is
actually<00:00:11.460> for<00:00:11.940> the<00:00:15.109> jet<00:00:16.109> set<00:00:16.440> in<00:00:17.449> blue<00:00:19.640> if<00:00:20.640> any

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
actually for the jet set in blue if any

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.509 
actually for the jet set in blue if any
of<00:00:20.970> you<00:00:21.090> noticed<00:00:21.660> um<00:00:21.930> this<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.500> my<00:00:22.740> second

of you noticed um this is my second
video<00:00:24.140> reviewing<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.380> same<00:00:25.619> plane<00:00:25.949> I'm

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
video reviewing the same plane I'm

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.580 
video reviewing the same plane I'm
actually<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:27.029> to<00:00:27.150> delete<00:00:27.390> my<00:00:27.570> last<00:00:28.170> video

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
actually going to delete my last video

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.310 
actually going to delete my last video
because<00:00:29.039> I<00:00:29.750> didn't<00:00:30.750> know<00:00:30.840> much<00:00:30.960> about<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
because I didn't know much about the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.170 
because I didn't know much about the
plane<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> was<00:00:31.859> messing<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.340> on<00:00:32.520> much<00:00:32.910> of<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
plane I was messing up on much of the

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.450 
plane I was messing up on much of the
details<00:00:33.600> and<00:00:33.840> I<00:00:33.930> am<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:34.320> I<00:00:34.530> hadn't<00:00:34.890> flown<00:00:35.280> it

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
details and I am and I hadn't flown it

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.410 
details and I am and I hadn't flown it
yet<00:00:35.660> but<00:00:36.660> I<00:00:37.040> I<00:00:38.040> actually<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.790> fly<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.090> and

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
yet but I I actually got to fly it and

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.930 
yet but I I actually got to fly it and
now<00:00:39.690> i'm<00:00:39.840> going<00:00:39.960> to<00:00:40.020> do<00:00:40.579> i'm<00:00:41.579> just<00:00:41.640> going<00:00:41.879> to

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
post a more detailed more accurate

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
post a more detailed more accurate
review<00:00:45.860> so<00:00:46.860> anyway<00:00:47.190> here<00:00:47.730> we<00:00:47.820> go<00:00:47.940> we<00:00:48.090> have<00:00:48.800> the

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
review so anyway here we go we have the

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.319 
review so anyway here we go we have the
transmitter<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:52.730> we<00:00:53.730> have<00:00:54.590> the<00:00:55.590> plane<00:00:56.010> itself

00:00:56.319 --> 00:00:56.329 
transmitter and we have the plane itself

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.619 
transmitter and we have the plane itself
and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.870> also<00:00:58.020> you<00:00:58.199> get<00:00:59.629> manuals

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
and then also you get manuals

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.189 
and then also you get manuals
instructions<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.530> flying<00:01:02.309> tips<00:01:03.019> that's<00:01:04.019> not

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
instructions and flying tips that's not

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.660 
instructions and flying tips that's not
important<00:01:04.760> first<00:01:05.760> I'm<00:01:05.970> going<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.119> go<00:01:06.240> over<00:01:06.590> the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:07.670 
important first I'm going to go over the

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.660 
important first I'm going to go over the
transmitter<00:01:11.150> not<00:01:12.150> much<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.479> say<00:01:12.720> it<00:01:13.110> has

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:13.670 
transmitter not much to say it has

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.210 
transmitter not much to say it has
antenna<00:01:14.670> and<00:01:15.590> then<00:01:16.590> has<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> built-in<00:01:17.159> charger

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
antenna and then has a built-in charger

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.260 
antenna and then has a built-in charger
and<00:01:18.200> is<00:01:19.200> this<00:01:19.619> thing<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.070> pops<00:01:20.759> open<00:01:20.970> like<00:01:21.240> that

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
and is this thing up pops open like that

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.240 
and is this thing up pops open like that
I<00:01:21.689> like<00:01:22.170> keeping<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:22.590> close<00:01:22.799> and<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.070> I<00:01:23.189> could

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
I like keeping it close and then I could

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.770 
I like keeping it close and then I could
just<00:01:23.490> charge<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.880> through<00:01:24.060> this<00:01:24.240> mini<00:01:24.540> jack

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
just charge it through this mini jack

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.780 
just charge it through this mini jack
right<00:01:24.960> here<00:01:25.549> without<00:01:26.549> unplugging<00:01:27.049> anything

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
right here without unplugging anything

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.170 
right here without unplugging anything
not<00:01:29.790> unplugging<00:01:30.180> but<00:01:30.509> opening<00:01:31.320> this<00:01:31.759> and<00:01:32.759> you

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
not unplugging but opening this and you

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.600 
not unplugging but opening this and you
have<00:01:33.329> yours<00:01:33.860> steering<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:36.619> up<00:01:37.619> up<00:01:38.400> and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
have yours steering and the up up and

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.460 
have yours steering and the up up and
down<00:01:38.670> throttle<00:01:40.130> and<00:01:41.130> you<00:01:41.600> have<00:01:42.600> a<00:01:42.630> B<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:43.079> C<00:01:43.140> so

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:43.470 
down throttle and you have a B and C so

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.109 
down throttle and you have a B and C so
you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.649> fly<00:01:43.799> up<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.280> three<00:01:44.610> planes<00:01:44.880> at<00:01:45.030> the

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
you can fly up to three planes at the

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:47.060 
you can fly up to three planes at the
same<00:01:45.270> time<00:01:45.450> it's<00:01:46.110> pretty<00:01:46.320> cool<00:01:46.500> I<00:01:46.560> tried<00:01:46.860> that

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
same time it's pretty cool I tried that

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:51.050 
same time it's pretty cool I tried that
with<00:01:47.280> my<00:01:47.460> friends<00:01:48.060> plane<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:49.200> then<00:01:50.040> I<00:01:50.310> could

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
with my friends plane and then I could

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.359 
with my friends plane and then I could
um<00:01:52.670> here's<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.909> on<00:01:54.390> switch<00:01:55.100> and<00:01:56.100> you<00:01:56.310> have<00:01:56.490> a

lose that's all the details on the

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:13.860 
lose that's all the details on the
transmitter<00:02:09.229> and<00:02:11.480> had<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.599> actual<00:02:12.959> plane

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:13.870 
transmitter and had the actual plane

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.210 
transmitter and had the actual plane
it's<00:02:14.650> just<00:02:15.430> it's<00:02:15.940> foam<00:02:16.239> styrofoam<00:02:17.040> the<00:02:18.040> whole

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
it's just it's foam styrofoam the whole

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.030 
it's just it's foam styrofoam the whole
bottom<00:02:18.580> is<00:02:18.730> white<00:02:19.170> and<00:02:20.170> then<00:02:20.349> the<00:02:20.440> top<00:02:20.650> is

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:21.040 
bottom is white and then the top is

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.240 
bottom is white and then the top is
black<00:02:21.909> blue<00:02:22.569> and<00:02:22.810> it's<00:02:23.409> got<00:02:23.680> all<00:02:23.830> these<00:02:23.980> crazy

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
black blue and it's got all these crazy

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:30.960 
black blue and it's got all these crazy
stickers<00:02:26.040> um<00:02:28.170> after<00:02:29.170> flying<00:02:29.470> this<00:02:29.769> I<00:02:30.010> think

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
stickers um after flying this I think

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.960 
stickers um after flying this I think
that<00:02:31.510> it<00:02:32.019> flies<00:02:32.349> pretty<00:02:32.620> well<00:02:32.890> flies<00:02:33.730> better

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
that it flies pretty well flies better

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.069 
that it flies pretty well flies better
than<00:02:34.239> the<00:02:34.569> jet<00:02:35.459> styles<00:02:36.459> I<00:02:36.810> think<00:02:37.810> if<00:02:37.900> I<00:02:38.019> is

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:38.079 
than the jet styles I think if I is

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:40.080 
than the jet styles I think if I is
better<00:02:38.349> because<00:02:38.560> it<00:02:38.860> has<00:02:39.280> these<00:02:39.459> two

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
better because it has these two

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.020 
better because it has these two
elevators<00:02:40.540> right<00:02:40.870> here<00:02:41.110> and<00:02:41.549> back<00:02:42.549> here<00:02:42.909> these

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
elevators right here and back here these

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:49.140 
elevators right here and back here these
two<00:02:43.090> tail<00:02:43.510> ones<00:02:44.040> um<00:02:46.260> also<00:02:47.260> I<00:02:47.440> think<00:02:47.769> it<00:02:48.090> goes<00:02:49.090> a

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
two tail ones um also I think it goes a

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.809 
two tail ones um also I think it goes a
little<00:02:49.450> bit<00:02:49.780> I<00:02:50.079> think<00:02:50.680> it<00:02:50.799> it's<00:02:51.069> better<00:02:51.280> going

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
little bit I think it it's better going

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.599 
little bit I think it it's better going
against<00:02:52.239> the<00:02:52.329> wind<00:02:52.480> because<00:02:53.099> the<00:02:54.099> propellers

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
against the wind because the propellers

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.729 
against the wind because the propellers
don't<00:02:54.819> have<00:02:54.940> anything<00:02:55.150> blocking<00:02:55.629> it<00:02:56.019> one<00:02:56.650> of

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
don't have anything blocking it one of

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.069 
don't have anything blocking it one of
my<00:02:56.859> blood<00:02:57.280> to<00:02:57.459> jet<00:02:57.730> if<00:02:58.420> you<00:02:58.569> saw<00:02:58.750> my<00:02:58.900> other

00:02:59.069 --> 00:02:59.079 
my blood to jet if you saw my other

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:02.819 
my blood to jet if you saw my other
video<00:02:59.470> it's<00:02:59.799> the<00:02:59.950> orange<00:03:00.159> jet<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:02.290> has<00:03:02.560> these

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
video it's the orange jet it has these

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.319 
video it's the orange jet it has these
little<00:03:03.010> like<00:03:03.310> foam<00:03:03.579> blocks<00:03:04.170> right<00:03:05.170> there

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
little like foam blocks right there

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:09.360 
little like foam blocks right there
anyway<00:03:07.329> it's<00:03:07.599> pretty<00:03:07.840> stable<00:03:08.170> it's<00:03:08.950> his<00:03:09.099> crash

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
anyway it's pretty stable it's his crash

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:13.349 
anyway it's pretty stable it's his crash
resistant<00:03:09.970> I<00:03:10.150> agree<00:03:10.680> eighty<00:03:11.680> percent<00:03:12.359> crash

00:03:13.349 --> 00:03:13.359 
resistant I agree eighty percent crash
