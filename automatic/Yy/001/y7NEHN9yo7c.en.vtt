00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
think was episode 2 wasn't it something

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.690 
think was episode 2 wasn't it something
like<00:02:39.450> that<00:02:39.600> leave<00:02:40.500> this<00:02:40.650> as<00:02:40.830> normal<00:02:40.980> and<00:02:41.400> Coe

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
like that leave this as normal and Coe

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.570 
like that leave this as normal and Coe
done<00:02:41.940> you<00:02:42.660> can<00:02:42.810> leave<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:43.140> as<00:02:43.290> that<00:02:43.740> but<00:02:44.250> I'm

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
done you can leave it as that but I'm

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:47.120 
done you can leave it as that but I'm
not<00:02:44.730> import<00:02:45.060> mine<00:02:45.210> as<00:02:45.540> above<00:02:46.080> normal<00:02:46.350> for<00:02:47.040> the
