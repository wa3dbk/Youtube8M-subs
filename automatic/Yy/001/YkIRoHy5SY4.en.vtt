00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
pops out all the way around

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.630 
pops out all the way around
and<00:02:09.899> once<00:02:10.470> we've<00:02:10.679> worked<00:02:10.920> our<00:02:11.129> way<00:02:11.160> around<00:02:11.400> the

in the logic board that will have to
come<00:03:02.430> out<00:03:02.459> you<00:03:02.610> can<00:03:02.730> see<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.880> started<00:03:03.209> to<00:03:03.269> pry

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:03.450 
come out you can see I started to pry

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:04.940 
come out you can see I started to pry
this<00:03:03.630> but<00:03:03.810> it<00:03:03.900> is<00:03:03.930> actually<00:03:04.590> situated

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
this but it is actually situated

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:07.940 
this but it is actually situated
underneath<00:03:05.880> the<00:03:06.090> PCB<00:03:06.570> so<00:03:06.900> you<00:03:07.470> will<00:03:07.680> need<00:03:07.890> to

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
underneath the PCB so you will need to

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.530 
underneath the PCB so you will need to
take<00:03:08.190> the<00:03:08.250> board<00:03:08.550> out<00:03:08.700> in<00:03:08.730> order<00:03:09.120> to<00:03:09.269> remove

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
take the board out in order to remove

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:14.060 
take the board out in order to remove
the<00:03:09.690> headset<00:03:10.019> jack<00:03:10.260> and<00:03:11.239> I'm<00:03:12.239> still<00:03:12.630> not<00:03:13.070> quite

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
the headset jack and I'm still not quite

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:15.530 
the headset jack and I'm still not quite
getting<00:03:14.310> this<00:03:14.489> out<00:03:14.670> with<00:03:14.910> the<00:03:15.000> tweezers<00:03:15.180> that

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
getting this out with the tweezers that

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.630 
getting this out with the tweezers that
I'm<00:03:15.630> using<00:03:15.840> right<00:03:16.140> now<00:03:16.170> if<00:03:16.680> I<00:03:17.070> switch<00:03:17.310> to<00:03:17.430> a

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
I'm using right now if I switch to a

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.250 
I'm using right now if I switch to a
wider<00:03:17.940> pair<00:03:18.269> I<00:03:18.300> might<00:03:18.720> be<00:03:18.870> able<00:03:19.050> to<00:03:19.110> get<00:03:19.230> a

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
wider pair I might be able to get a

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:25.550 
wider pair I might be able to get a
better<00:03:19.440> angle<00:03:19.680> here<00:03:23.840> but<00:03:24.840> I'm<00:03:25.019> just<00:03:25.320> going<00:03:25.470> to

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
better angle here but I'm just going to

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.530 
better angle here but I'm just going to
go<00:03:25.680> ahead<00:03:25.739> and<00:03:25.950> show<00:03:26.100> you<00:03:26.160> the<00:03:26.370> full<00:03:26.610> board

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
place make sure you take that out before

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.680 
place make sure you take that out before
you<00:03:52.660> start<00:03:52.750> prying<00:03:53.170> anything<00:03:55.650> and<00:03:57.600> that<00:03:58.600> will

00:03:58.680 --> 00:03:58.690 
you start prying anything and that will

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:00.810 
you start prying anything and that will
just<00:03:58.870> kind<00:03:59.020> of<00:03:59.080> lift<00:03:59.320> up<00:03:59.530> and<00:03:59.830> rout<00:04:00.130> out<00:04:00.400> from

adhesive underneath that holds us into
place<00:04:10.170> so<00:04:11.170> if<00:04:11.320> you<00:04:11.440> heat<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.620> up<00:04:11.770> a<00:04:11.860> little<00:04:11.950> bit

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
place so if you heat it up a little bit

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.410 
place so if you heat it up a little bit
you<00:04:12.250> can<00:04:12.370> usually<00:04:12.580> take<00:04:12.910> something<00:04:13.270> like<00:04:13.360> a

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:13.420 
you can usually take something like a

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:14.880 
you can usually take something like a
screwdriver<00:04:14.050> or<00:04:14.260> an<00:04:14.350> ice<00:04:14.470> pick<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.860> just

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
screwdriver or an ice pick and just

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.710 
screwdriver or an ice pick and just
gently<00:04:15.340> pry<00:04:15.670> from<00:04:15.700> inside<00:04:16.420> and<00:04:16.630> it<00:04:16.690> should

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
gently pry from inside and it should

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:18.509 
gently pry from inside and it should
pull<00:04:17.109> right<00:04:17.320> off<00:04:17.470> the<00:04:17.650> board<00:04:17.799> just<00:04:17.950> like<00:04:18.280> that

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
pull right off the board just like that

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:21.390 
pull right off the board just like that
and<00:04:18.989> there<00:04:19.989> is<00:04:20.140> a<00:04:20.169> rubber<00:04:20.500> gasket<00:04:20.769> that<00:04:21.100> kind

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:21.400 
and there is a rubber gasket that kind

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.490 
and there is a rubber gasket that kind
of<00:04:21.430> goes<00:04:21.640> around<00:04:21.880> the<00:04:22.030> outside<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:22.780> if<00:04:23.380> you

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:23.500 
of goes around the outside and if you

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.990 
of goes around the outside and if you
move<00:04:23.770> that<00:04:23.800> out<00:04:24.190> of<00:04:24.340> the<00:04:24.400> way<00:04:24.550> you'll<00:04:24.760> have<00:04:24.820> a

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.000 
move that out of the way you'll have a

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.110 
move that out of the way you'll have a
little<00:04:25.419> more<00:04:25.630> access<00:04:26.490> if<00:04:27.490> you're<00:04:27.700> trying<00:04:28.000> to

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
little more access if you're trying to

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.640 
little more access if you're trying to
remove<00:04:28.330> a<00:04:28.450> foreign<00:04:28.720> object<00:04:28.840> which<00:04:29.290> is<00:04:29.470> what's

going<00:04:29.830> on<00:04:30.010> here<00:04:30.490> so<00:04:31.150> you<00:04:31.180> can<00:04:31.330> just<00:04:31.450> kind<00:04:31.600> of

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:31.660 
going on here so you can just kind of

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:34.230 
going on here so you can just kind of
peel<00:04:31.870> that<00:04:32.050> back<00:04:32.110> a<00:04:32.320> little<00:04:32.680> bit<00:04:32.830> or<00:04:33.090> all<00:04:34.090> the

one I was able to get a grip here on the

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:49.080 
one I was able to get a grip here on the
inside<00:04:47.500> now<00:04:48.040> you<00:04:48.280> see<00:04:48.520> I'm<00:04:48.610> pushing<00:04:48.910> down<00:04:49.060> on
