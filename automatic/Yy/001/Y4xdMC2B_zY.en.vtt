for you to focus on losing fat not just

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
weight for example if you're exercising

weight for example if you're exercising
with<00:00:36.570> weights<00:00:36.899> at<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.170> same<00:00:37.410> time<00:00:37.710> that

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
with weights at the same time that

with weights at the same time that
you're<00:00:38.160> dieting<00:00:38.489> you<00:00:38.910> could<00:00:39.390> be<00:00:39.540> gaining<00:00:39.780> some

00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
you're dieting you could be gaining some

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:41.600 
you're dieting you could be gaining some
muscle<00:00:40.469> weight<00:00:40.680> at<00:00:40.829> the<00:00:40.890> same<00:00:41.160> time<00:00:41.430> that

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:41.610 
muscle weight at the same time that

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:43.340 
muscle weight at the same time that
you're<00:00:41.730> burning<00:00:41.910> off<00:00:42.210> unwanted<00:00:42.629> fat<00:00:42.930> pounds

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you're burning off unwanted fat pounds

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.369 
you're burning off unwanted fat pounds
in<00:00:43.469> this<00:00:44.160> case<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> added<00:00:45.149> muscle<00:00:45.450> might

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
in this case the added muscle might

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.440 
in this case the added muscle might
offset<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:47.100> pounds<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> fat<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.059> you<00:00:48.120> lost

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
offset the pounds of fat that you lost

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.450 
offset the pounds of fat that you lost
and<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.960> scale<00:00:49.350> would<00:00:49.620> not<00:00:49.829> show<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.100> change

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
and the scale would not show a change

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.270 
and the scale would not show a change
but<00:00:51.149> that's<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.780> necessarily<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.559> bad<00:00:52.770> thing

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
but that's not necessarily a bad thing

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.760 
but that's not necessarily a bad thing
you<00:00:53.670> see<00:00:53.879> muscle<00:00:54.329> tissue<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.930> metabolically

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
you see muscle tissue is metabolically

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.130 
you see muscle tissue is metabolically
more<00:00:56.219> active<00:00:56.670> than<00:00:56.789> fat<00:00:57.090> tissue<00:00:57.420> and<00:00:57.660> it's

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
more active than fat tissue and it's

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.049 
more active than fat tissue and it's
common<00:00:58.620> knowledge<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:59.010> the<00:00:59.219> more<00:00:59.670> muscle

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
common knowledge that the more muscle

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.420 
common knowledge that the more muscle
you<00:01:00.090> carry<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:01.020> more<00:01:01.379> fat<00:01:01.680> you'll<00:01:01.859> burn<00:01:02.070> even

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
you carry the more fat you'll burn even

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.600 
you carry the more fat you'll burn even
at<00:01:02.550> rest<00:01:02.820> and<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.539> leaner<00:01:03.809> that<00:01:04.140> you<00:01:04.260> look

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
at rest and the leaner that you look

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.130 
at rest and the leaner that you look
regardless<00:01:05.610> of<00:01:05.790> how<00:01:05.939> much<00:01:06.150> you<00:01:06.299> weigh<00:01:06.479> so
