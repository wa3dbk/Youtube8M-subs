00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:10.230
 First of all , before going into battle with after effects this time 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:15.680
 The start and the goal when producing with aftereffects 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:18.800
 At first I think that I want you to keep setting 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.310
 First, start the after effects in the first to the No. 1 first 

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:24.280
 It 's about creating a composition from the composition tab 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.610
 New composition 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:32.980
 It is the size of the planning video of the video made here 

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:36.690
 I have to decide to Osaki, but first I will decide from the name 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:43.620
 This time it is a test so body s and so on 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:45.510
 I will put in, and then there is a setting of the size of this picture, but here comes the moon ahead 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.199
 What do you use the picture for 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:54.390
 In is Toka dvd 3 or after youtube to flow of Taso say to Blu-ray 

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:56.590
 I have to set according to the plan, but I have to know what I want to do 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.200
 At first it is understandable which plan is what 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:06.340
 If not this hdv htv 72029.97 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:11.500
 I'm planning to be referred to as Well generally 720 p It is a chestnut set to say but this 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:16.580
 Since Well after roughly If you use a no matter how legitimate flexibility brat 4 or rather support the house 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:22.310
 I think that I should use this in duration 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:24.170
 This is the length of the video image This is a test video this time only 5 seconds 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:30.960
 I will leave 5 seconds 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:35.250
 In This is a high-seconds of the video I 5 seconds composition of the image has been created 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:40.290
 I 'm working on adding animation to this composition at 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:44.270
 Because how to attach animation becomes explanation in the application practice section, now 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:44.270
 I will skip the explanation 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.469
 I will add animation easily 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.049
 Follow 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:09.950
 That it will come out at one second 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.950
 It disappears in 0 seconds 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.520
 So array just this 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.220
 Blur 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.569
 It is Bokashi to multiple families 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:36.689
 I feel a little blurred when coming out 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.500
 Something like this 

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:43.890
 To to 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:43.890
 The state of displaying up to 4 seconds 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.770
 Keep it 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.770
 If it returns to the initial state in 5 seconds and returns to the 0 second knob state 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:05.690
 Now that you have a video like this, you have completed the task of applying the video animation . 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:08.950
 Last composition when it became 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:08.950
 Add to render suddenly 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.430
 Output module settings 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:22.840
 Model Select the format of the picture here, but it is also obvious which format to choose 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:27.670
 If there is no later conversion to the desired format, then for the time being quicktime 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:32.080
 Well it It is a stop machine options animation I really is better uncompressed 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:32.600
 Animate in terms of ease of use , so you can maintain reasonable quality with animation 

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.100
 Used 

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.600
 I think I should do it with quicktime animation 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:43.510
 OK 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:45.610
 And the setting of the output destination that follows 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.060
 With the desktop 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:48.060
 Save by 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:58.120
 And when you press the rendering button 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:58.120
 The video is now exported and the video data is stored on the desktop 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.540
 Repeated playback 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:06.540
 Something like this 

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:15.400
 So for the time being this 2 year old work of the video aftereffects 

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:20.199
 First to create a now position to render the last 

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:25.870
 Well part of the animation of the work after it will be the start and the goal is that the 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:30.220
 If everyone is trying out a new way of expression in the form of explanation in the practice section 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:32.880
 Is for the time being in the I think that coming up also expressive power know this process before entering the production 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:36.710
 I would like to keep 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.710
 It is more than this time and see you again
