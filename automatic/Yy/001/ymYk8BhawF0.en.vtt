00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.800
 hello friends here designers pretty much 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.720
 How to play minecraft in survival mode 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.910
 I hope you like the video 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.560
 remember to give little hand up in addition to 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.840
 the description will leave you a link to 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.610
 download the game update that good 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:32.970
 The first thing we should do is open 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:36.360
 minecraft once inside we open and 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.870
 we enter single player mode 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:45.320
 and now we move to create a new world 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.320
 here good we choose the name of the world 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.130
 and we choose the game mode that can 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.150
 be these three options and let's choose 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:02.810
 your rival in this case we will create 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.810
 a new world 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.299
 we wait a minute 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:49.170
 sorry in the program this method 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:52.280
 well here we are inside the 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.320
 microsoft server to see 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.860
 me basically to play in minecraft 

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.440
 I base myself on the achievements in this case 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:03.690
 it's to squeeze esq and it's going to come out 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.720
 a box here to see the achievements 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.210
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:11.880
 some complete things then what 

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:13.260
 first is getting wood hit 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.510
 a tree until a block of 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:21.920
 wood obtained good that's the first thing 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:23.980
 what we are going to look for is an oak 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.680
 and we are going to 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.810
 for the pieces 

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.010
 once we have all the blocks of 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.750
 wood 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.670
 I would say better than together in everything 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.980
 necessary because it's going to be very useful 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:40.310
 in the oak and good now 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:43.220
 we will see in the achievements we must make 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.340
 good to you the same thing will appear 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:48.380
 path obtained now seems to them the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.950
 next issue that is to make a 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.160
 good work table 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.550
 to create a work table we must 

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:59.110
 manufacture 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.110
 then it would be 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.870
 we get four of these 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.010
 would be 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:24.290
 we place one on each side 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:26.090
 remember this is very very important is 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.450
 that every time they go to create an object 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:33.720
 do it with the same form 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:35.040
 in this case a square because it is the 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.719
 work table 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:39.409
 well we will place it in a place 

00:03:36.719 --> 00:03:39.409
 any 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:45.430
 this time to what is going to serve 

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:45.430
 for during the game 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.600
 good to see we will get the achievement obtained 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:54.600
 and others and now we have back 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:00.840
 in this case I would make this sample more 

00:03:58.069 --> 00:04:05.959
 now to mine uses tables and sticks to 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.959
 make a good peak we think optical 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:10.459
 we will do it with the form 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:26.860
 we are first sticks 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.670
 for now 

00:04:43.030 --> 00:04:48.910
 well there we will have as well told them 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:51.460
 the form is very important that always 

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:55.569
 do with the same shape 

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:57.819
 good and so we have a peak after 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:05:01.180
 obviously I add more stones and 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:03.130
 other good I think this is going to be the 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.710
 end of the tutorial and I hope you have 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.050
 served 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.170
 well thank you very much for looking up 

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.170
 then
