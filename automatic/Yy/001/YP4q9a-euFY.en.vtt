00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.020
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.200
 weekend weather with the views on 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.510
 youtube grätz with each other god 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.340
 Weather will be exciting weather 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.980
 next week is now the weekend 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.289
 quiet and mild but there is a week to come 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.850
 It then a so-called border weather situation 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.029
 that is, there is an aggravated 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.550
 air mass limit diagonally at least once 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.680
 over germany most of the time like that 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.480
 somewhere the border east friesland 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.580
 Niederlausitz down is not quite 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.940
 the northeastern half and southwestern half 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.690
 shared most of your time so north 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.700
 eastern thirds with cold and snow and 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.059
 the southwestern two thirds 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.440
 Germany with rather warm and rain 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.989
 And it's not that warm either 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.210
 snowfall in this milder 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.399
 range somewhere mostly between 400 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.800
 and 800 meters it is not 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.410
 screaming was mid-mountain and alps 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.969
 if something comes down quite well there too 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.800
 snow with the partie 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.809
 but just northeast of this 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.340
 air mass limit there is then the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:04.610
 usual stripes so first 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.490
 ice-storm and then snow comes 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:10.530
 and in the northeast, it's just 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.060
 cold with a few snow showers 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.890
 but that will be pretty exciting again 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.659
 especially in this strip 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:16.979
 be on the air mass limit then 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.840
 again some dramatic things 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:22.590
 happen with the gluteal rain 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.119
 and with the snowfall where exactly then 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:26.549
 is that it is still very much 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.740
 You have to say hard from day to day 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.360
 day watch you will be as always 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.820
 Run informed on facebook 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.650
 tachelmann weather or on twitter with j 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:36.479
 underscored tile man or if something 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:40.970
 very dramatic happens with 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.970
 one between video here on youtube 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.170
 critical but important to the mild 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.810
 sees something again not very long 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.970
 through the skin means the abda electro 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.100
 but only that it just once in the 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.630
 second half of the week fleeting night long 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.119
 that it cuts all the way though 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.380
 at least stand on six to 800 meters 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.619
 is the most with that 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.829
 snowfall border with baby even time in 

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.469
 the other language it 's just why but 

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:10.860
 just not so cold that the whole 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.239
 time up in Austria from 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.650
 austria wiener tank one more 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.640
 specialty with the st 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:20.280
 a day tighter southeast are 13 14 degrees 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:22.530
 maybe even the 60s or 70s 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:24.900
 years would be Peter Alexander 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.870
 probably drink in singing outside 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.670
 Sievering blooms already the lilac yes 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.470
 We grew up with that 

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.549
 not easy 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.099
 however, there is a reason why 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:36.510
 This is already almost historical 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.659
 not at all peter alexander 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:42.569
 has written a great historical 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.220
 meaning also backwards that the 

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.739
 written or sievering sievering 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.359
 lies in northwestern vienna so the 

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:52.950
 city ​​center today i believe 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:54.420
 nineteenth district döbling and is like that 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.069
 a bit in the wind shadow of the wiener 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.769
 choice is so at west northwest wind 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:00.989
 protected from the cold winds and with 

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:03.780
 the south to southeast wind comes naturally 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:05.670
 the whole wiener town graze after 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:07.560
 sievering and that 's why there in the 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:10.530
 cut the temperatures quite well 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.709
 be slightly higher than elsewhere in Vienna 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:15.780
 and therefore no wonder that's just what 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.489
 written and then it just was not 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.290
 by peter alexander you can visit 

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:22.139
 But that's just what I have 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.540
 I still experienced it in the 60s and 

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:26.160
 70s that was just sung 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.989
 however, that remains as it is 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.790
 on sunday summed up then comes 

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.889
 also the slightly cooler air though 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.409
 not the cold air is Vienna too 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:38.940
 For now on the mild side 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:41.849
 this air mass limit earlier pedal 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.260
 i have come to his ard and zdf 

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:45.419
 the short at rtl 

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:48.599
 there is the thing going on today 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:50.760
 jungle and we will hear again 

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:54.720
 from 40 to 50 degrees even the big one 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.510
 Author Micky Eisenheart still believes 

00:03:54.720 --> 00:04:00.359
 because his candidate helmut berger 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:02.099
 somehow experienced 50 degrees last 

00:04:00.359 --> 00:04:04.769
 year what he did not have it was easy 

00:04:02.099 --> 00:04:06.900
 not so it was just under 40 

00:04:04.769 --> 00:04:08.790
 last year on the wildest day 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.500
 Fortunately, there are at least a few kilometers 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.349
 away from the jungle camp one 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.049
 weather station there quite reliable 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:18.180
 measures the next few days so close 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.609
 below 30 degrees are the highest temperature 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:22.919
 mostly between 25 and 28 years 

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:24.779
 29 degrees what next week again 

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:25.080
 it gets more exciting for the jungle camp 

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.940
 fans 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:28.650
 it will probably be wednesday 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:31.170
 until friday then again animals 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:33.270
 and get wet and know her and the 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:34.230
 Bach comes and what do I know what then 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.210
 everything will happen 

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:38.370
 I leave it to you whether you are watching or 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.380
 not looking is indeed on the soap 

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.910
 but not the soaps 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.470
 senders are now also soaps 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.980
 That's why I do not think so 

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.930
 on it 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.820
 okay he enjoy the 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:51.060
 air mass limit especially if they are in 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:55.040
 exciting stripes are as a weekend 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.040
 all the best for god and goodbye
