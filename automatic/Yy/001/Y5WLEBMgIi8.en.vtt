00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
percent certain this is the new one

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.729 
percent certain this is the new one
because<00:00:33.570> I<00:00:33.719> don't<00:00:33.780> remember<00:00:34.050> for<00:00:34.440> sure<00:00:34.620> but

because I don't remember for sure but
I'm<00:00:34.860> pretty<00:00:35.070> sure<00:00:35.160> the<00:00:35.430> old<00:00:35.550> one<00:00:35.730> was<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> much

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
I'm pretty sure the old one was a much

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.470 
I'm pretty sure the old one was a much
lighter<00:00:36.450> color<00:00:36.630> scheme<00:00:37.320> than<00:00:37.860> this<00:00:38.070> one<00:00:38.480> it's

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
lighter color scheme than this one it's

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
lighter color scheme than this one it's
a<00:00:39.600> really<00:00:39.780> cool<00:00:40.020> figure<00:00:40.350> though<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:41.040> that's

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
a really cool figure though so that's

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.030 
a really cool figure though so that's
why<00:00:41.489> I'm<00:00:41.820> gonna<00:00:42.149> review<00:00:42.540> it<00:00:42.860> even<00:00:43.860> though<00:00:43.950> I'm

side to side the face mask things are
softer<00:01:50.700> plastic<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.240> they<00:01:51.360> won't<00:01:51.570> break<00:01:51.840> on

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
softer plastic so they won't break on

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.120 
softer plastic so they won't break on

they're sculpted to not be moved so they

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.789

only<00:03:01.590> really<00:03:01.950> two<00:03:02.129> positions<00:03:02.670> but<00:03:03.389> that's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
only really two positions but that's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.420 
only really two positions but that's
more<00:03:04.139> than<00:03:04.290> enough<00:03:04.379> and<00:03:04.889> it<00:03:05.069> looks<00:03:05.250> good

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
more than enough and it looks good

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:06.770 
more than enough and it looks good
either<00:03:05.579> way<00:03:05.730> the<00:03:06.030> way<00:03:06.150> they<00:03:06.269> did<00:03:06.420> the<00:03:06.540> chain

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:06.780 
either way the way they did the chain

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.129 
either way the way they did the chain
there<00:03:07.109> so<00:03:07.799> that's<00:03:08.370> pretty<00:03:08.639> cool<00:03:08.970> waist<00:03:09.840> twist

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:10.139 
there so that's pretty cool waist twist

00:03:10.139 --> 00:03:11.059 
there so that's pretty cool waist twist
is<00:03:10.260> under<00:03:10.560> the<00:03:10.709> belt

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
is under the belt

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:13.789 
is under the belt
he's<00:03:11.459> got<00:03:11.700> Y<00:03:11.970> jointed<00:03:12.569> ball<00:03:13.200> hinge<00:03:13.500> hips

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
he's got Y jointed ball hinge hips

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:16.460 
he's got Y jointed ball hinge hips
they're<00:03:14.280> really<00:03:14.670> stiff<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.329> they<00:03:16.230> don't<00:03:16.379> have

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
they're really stiff and they don't have

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.349 
they're really stiff and they don't have
the<00:03:16.590> best<00:03:16.769> range<00:03:17.010> of<00:03:17.159> motion<00:03:17.519> and<00:03:17.699> they<00:03:18.180> get

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359 
the best range of motion and they get

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:20.900 
the best range of motion and they get
loose<00:03:18.870> they<00:03:19.199> tend<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.010> get<00:03:20.160> pretty<00:03:20.220> loose<00:03:20.669> in

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910 
loose they tend to get pretty loose in

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.030 
loose they tend to get pretty loose in
the<00:03:21.030> swivel<00:03:21.419> department<00:03:21.930> but<00:03:22.440> they're<00:03:22.769> okay

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040 
the swivel department but they're okay

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:24.470 
the swivel department but they're okay
because<00:03:23.160> the<00:03:23.489> hips<00:03:23.699> and<00:03:23.970> the<00:03:24.120> legs<00:03:24.239> are

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
because the hips and the legs are

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.900 
because the hips and the legs are
sculpted<00:03:24.870> really<00:03:25.139> well<00:03:25.319> their<00:03:26.160> paint<00:03:26.609> jobs

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:26.910 
sculpted really well their paint jobs

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.589 
sculpted really well their paint jobs
are<00:03:27.209> almost<00:03:27.780> perfect<00:03:28.349> and<00:03:29.040> he's<00:03:29.250> got<00:03:29.599> double

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599

hinged<00:03:30.959> knees<00:03:31.199> double<00:03:32.040> jointed<00:03:32.730> knees

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
hinged knees double jointed knees

hinged knees double jointed knees
whatever<00:03:33.180> you<00:03:33.239> want<00:03:33.359> to<00:03:33.419> call<00:03:33.569> that<00:03:33.599> this<00:03:34.319> knee

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 
whatever you want to call that this knee

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.409 
whatever you want to call that this knee
pad<00:03:34.859> is<00:03:35.160> connected<00:03:35.549> to<00:03:35.579> the<00:03:35.730> lower<00:03:35.940> half<00:03:36.239> of

00:03:36.409 --> 00:03:36.419 
pad is connected to the lower half of

00:03:36.419 --> 00:03:38.780 
pad is connected to the lower half of
course<00:03:36.810> so<00:03:37.290> maybe<00:03:37.470> just<00:03:37.829> use<00:03:37.980> the<00:03:38.160> top<00:03:38.370> half<00:03:38.609> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
course so maybe just use the top half of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.610 
course so maybe just use the top half of
the<00:03:38.940> knee<00:03:39.120> joint<00:03:39.150> so<00:03:40.049> that<00:03:40.199> it<00:03:40.290> looks<00:03:40.470> better

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620 
the knee joint so that it looks better

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.530 
the knee joint so that it looks better
but<00:03:41.370> that's<00:03:41.579> up<00:03:41.790> to<00:03:41.819> you<00:03:42.000> of<00:03:42.120> course

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
but that's up to you of course

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.659 
but that's up to you of course
it's<00:03:43.379> a<00:03:43.470> soft<00:03:43.709> plastic<00:03:43.919> so<00:03:44.250> it<00:03:44.340> won't<00:03:44.489> break

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:44.669 
it's a soft plastic so it won't break

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.699 
it's a soft plastic so it won't break
you've<00:03:45.329> got<00:03:45.480> tons<00:03:45.720> of<00:03:45.900> sculpt<00:03:46.230> work<00:03:46.349> going<00:03:46.590> on

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
you've got tons of sculpt work going on

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:47.449 
you've got tons of sculpt work going on
in<00:03:46.859> the<00:03:46.949> boots

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:47.459 
in the boots

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:50.240 
in the boots
there's<00:03:47.819> no<00:03:48.000> swivel<00:03:48.510> at<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.900> top<00:03:49.109> only<00:03:49.530> at<00:03:50.069> the

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:50.250 
there's no swivel at the top only at the

00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:53.119 
there's no swivel at the top only at the
ankle<00:03:50.699> with<00:03:51.329> the<00:03:51.359> hinge<00:03:51.780> so<00:03:52.440> limited

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
ankle with the hinge so limited

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.039 
ankle with the hinge so limited
articulation<00:03:53.310> but<00:03:54.120> he's<00:03:54.269> kind<00:03:54.540> of<00:03:54.569> a<00:03:54.660> big<00:03:54.870> guy

00:03:55.039 --> 00:03:55.049 
articulation but he's kind of a big guy

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:56.509 
articulation but he's kind of a big guy
so<00:03:55.349> you<00:03:55.410> probably<00:03:55.650> wouldn't<00:03:56.040> need<00:03:56.159> it<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.400> the

00:03:56.509 --> 00:03:56.519 
so you probably wouldn't need it in the

00:03:56.519 --> 00:03:58.610 
so you probably wouldn't need it in the
first<00:03:56.730> place<00:03:56.940> he's<00:03:57.870> got<00:03:58.049> I<00:03:58.260> guess<00:03:58.409> these<00:03:58.530> are

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
first place he's got I guess these are

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:00.530 
first place he's got I guess these are
supposed<00:03:58.889> to<00:03:58.919> be<00:03:59.010> straps<00:03:59.489> that<00:04:00.150> are<00:04:00.209> sticking

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
supposed to be straps that are sticking

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:02.449 
supposed to be straps that are sticking
out<00:04:00.780> these<00:04:01.349> are<00:04:01.590> kind<00:04:01.829> of<00:04:01.919> stiff<00:04:02.190> but<00:04:02.400> not

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
out these are kind of stiff but not

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.309 
out these are kind of stiff but not
stiff<00:04:02.940> enough<00:04:03.060> to<00:04:03.180> where<00:04:03.389> they'll<00:04:03.629> break<00:04:03.900> if

00:04:04.309 --> 00:04:04.319 
stiff enough to where they'll break if

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.229 
stiff enough to where they'll break if
they<00:04:04.739> are<00:04:04.919> supposed<00:04:05.370> to<00:04:05.430> be<00:04:05.579> straps<00:04:05.940> which<00:04:06.150> I

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:06.239 
they are supposed to be straps which I

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:08.270 
they are supposed to be straps which I
think<00:04:06.480> they<00:04:06.629> are<00:04:06.810> these<00:04:07.349> buckles<00:04:07.799> should<00:04:08.190> have

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:08.280 
think they are these buckles should have

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.729 
think they are these buckles should have
been<00:04:08.430> painted<00:04:08.849> and<00:04:09.030> they're<00:04:09.329> not<00:04:09.569> but<00:04:10.379> still

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:10.739 
been painted and they're not but still

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:13.520 
been painted and they're not but still
it<00:04:11.069> looks<00:04:11.280> really<00:04:11.729> good<00:04:11.909> put<00:04:12.720> the<00:04:12.750> cape<00:04:13.109> on<00:04:13.319> him

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
it looks really good put the cape on him

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:15.469 
it looks really good put the cape on him
give<00:04:13.709> him<00:04:13.829> his<00:04:13.919> weapons<00:04:14.370> and<00:04:14.579> you<00:04:14.940> have<00:04:15.150> one

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:15.479 
give him his weapons and you have one

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:19.580 
give him his weapons and you have one
massive<00:04:16.380> imposing<00:04:17.280> looking<00:04:17.760> figure<00:04:18.329> and<00:04:18.590> it's

massive imposing looking figure and it's

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:21.379
