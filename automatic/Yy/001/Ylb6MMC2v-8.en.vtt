filming<00:00:13.860> with<00:00:14.099> ND<00:00:14.670> filter<00:00:15.089> so<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:16.020> shutter

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
filming with ND filter so the shutter

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.790 
filming with ND filter so the shutter
speed<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.770> now<00:00:17.160> on<00:00:17.400> 150<00:00:18.210> however<00:00:18.840> probably<00:00:19.740> the

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
speed is now on 150 however probably the

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.349 
speed is now on 150 however probably the
best<00:00:20.039> is<00:00:21.140> 11<00:00:22.140> foliar<00:00:22.529> however<00:00:23.039> 150<00:00:23.880> is<00:00:24.060> not

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:24.359 
best is 11 foliar however 150 is not

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.040 
best is 11 foliar however 150 is not
very<00:00:25.109> extreme<00:00:25.710> fast<00:00:26.070> or<00:00:26.400> faster<00:00:26.970> than<00:00:27.300> then<00:00:27.869> it

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
very extreme fast or faster than then it

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.370 
very extreme fast or faster than then it
used<00:00:28.320> to<00:00:28.560> or<00:00:28.800> have<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.580> so<00:00:30.420> when<00:00:30.869> i'm<00:00:31.019> waving

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
used to or have to be so when i'm waving

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.850 
used to or have to be so when i'm waving
its<00:00:32.369> not<00:00:32.579> shocky<00:00:32.880> it's<00:00:33.180> when<00:00:33.780> you<00:00:33.930> stop<00:00:34.380> it<00:00:34.590> you

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
its not shocky it's when you stop it you

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.650 
its not shocky it's when you stop it you
will<00:00:35.040> see<00:00:35.219> that<00:00:35.370> my<00:00:35.760> hands<00:00:36.030> are<00:00:36.120> blurred<00:00:36.360> and

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
will see that my hands are blurred and

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.850 
will see that my hands are blurred and
when<00:00:37.010> you're<00:00:38.010> yeah<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.809> using<00:00:40.200> and<00:00:40.500> default

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
when you're yeah and using and default

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
when you're yeah and using and default
is<00:00:41.010> actually<00:00:41.399> way<00:00:41.610> better<00:00:41.809> than<00:00:42.809> actually<00:00:43.050> app

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
is actually way better than actually app

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.420 
is actually way better than actually app
thing<00:00:44.219> or<00:00:44.489> adding<00:00:45.180> the<00:00:46.129> shutter<00:00:47.129> speed

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
thing or adding the shutter speed

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.880 
thing or adding the shutter speed
because<00:00:48.000> when<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:48.480> add<00:00:48.719> shutter<00:00:49.320> speeds<00:00:49.620> it

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
because when you add shutter speeds it

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.680 
because when you add shutter speeds it
will<00:00:50.489> be<00:00:51.710> yeah<00:00:52.710> it<00:00:52.920> will<00:00:53.129> actually<00:00:53.370> make<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
will be yeah it will actually make the

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.930 
will be yeah it will actually make the
shot<00:00:54.930> or<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.559> movements<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.280> people<00:00:56.699> look

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
shot or the movements of people look

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.810 
shot or the movements of people look
really<00:00:56.969> shocking<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:57.870> it's<00:00:58.649> somehow<00:00:59.250> a

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
really shocking and it's somehow a

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.799 
really shocking and it's somehow a
little<00:01:00.359> bit<00:01:00.480> hard<00:01:00.780> or<00:01:00.989> not<00:01:01.379> really<00:01:02.480> easy<00:01:03.480> to

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
little bit hard or not really easy to

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.859 
little bit hard or not really easy to
get<00:01:04.019> used<00:01:04.290> to<00:01:04.530> looking<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.729> it's<00:01:06.540> a<00:01:06.630> great

get used to looking at it it's a great

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:10.460 
get used to looking at it it's a great

darkest and also edit a CPL to add a
little<00:01:36.540> bit<00:01:36.869> more<00:01:37.170> however<00:01:38.130> yeah<00:01:38.460> it's<00:01:38.700> just

of the Sun and yeah the yeah the old way

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.620 
of the Sun and yeah the yeah the old way
I'm<00:01:58.259> i<00:01:58.619> was<00:01:58.979> a<00:01:59.009> little<00:01:59.310> bit<00:01:59.549> confused<00:02:00.149> with<00:02:00.360> how

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
I'm i was a little bit confused with how

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.660 
I'm i was a little bit confused with how
to<00:02:00.689> use<00:02:01.110> an<00:02:01.350> ND<00:02:01.680> filter<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:02.369> the<00:02:02.520> beginning

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
to use an ND filter in the beginning

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.520 
to use an ND filter in the beginning
with<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.659> DSLR<00:02:04.189> because<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> old<00:02:05.520> way<00:02:05.729> with<00:02:06.149> a

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
with a DSLR because the old way with a

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.559 
with a DSLR because the old way with a
film<00:02:07.530> camera<00:02:07.710> is<00:02:08.039> that<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.399> had<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.819> use<00:02:09.270> a<00:02:09.300> lot

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
film camera is that you had to use a lot

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.869 
film camera is that you had to use a lot
of<00:02:09.599> different<00:02:10.289> and<00:02:10.440> d<00:02:10.590> filters<00:02:11.009> because<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
of different and d filters because you

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.880 
of different and d filters because you
did<00:02:12.060> not<00:02:12.090> had<00:02:12.629> all<00:02:12.870> the

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
did not had all the

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:15.860 
did not had all the
and<00:02:13.980> set<00:02:14.580> the<00:02:14.700> ISO<00:02:14.880> setting<00:02:15.360> because<00:02:15.540> you're

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
and set the ISO setting because you're

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.350 
and set the ISO setting because you're
filming<00:02:16.200> with<00:02:16.560> film<00:02:16.860> so<00:02:17.520> you<00:02:17.610> had<00:02:17.700> to<00:02:17.850> change

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
filming with film so you had to change

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:23.020 
filming with film so you had to change
the<00:02:18.480> ND<00:02:18.959> filters<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> lot<00:02:19.650> and<00:02:19.920> then<00:02:20.880> you<00:02:21.090> had<00:02:21.240> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
the ND filters a lot and then you had to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:28.760 
the ND filters a lot and then you had to
or<00:02:24.030> then<00:02:24.870> with<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.440> big<00:02:26.190> sony<00:02:27.150> x<00:02:27.660> 1<00:02:28.170> cameras<00:02:28.590> it

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
or then with the big sony x 1 cameras it

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:32.240 
or then with the big sony x 1 cameras it
has<00:02:29.010> a<00:02:29.040> built-in<00:02:29.730> ND<00:02:30.480> however<00:02:31.380> yet<00:02:31.709> you<00:02:31.950> still

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
has a built-in ND however yet you still

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.500 
has a built-in ND however yet you still
did<00:02:33.090> not<00:02:33.120> have<00:02:33.480> enough<00:02:34.020> things<00:02:34.560> or<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.610> can't

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
did not have enough things or you can't

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.460 
did not have enough things or you can't
really<00:02:36.840> put<00:02:37.440> much<00:02:37.890> things<00:02:38.250> on<00:02:38.490> the<00:02:38.850> camera<00:02:39.240> and

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
really put much things on the camera and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.360 
really put much things on the camera and
but<00:02:40.470> with<00:02:42.050> DSLR<00:02:43.050> it's<00:02:43.350> a<00:02:43.590> bit<00:02:43.830> different

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
but with DSLR it's a bit different

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.790 
but with DSLR it's a bit different
because<00:02:44.550> you<00:02:44.910> have<00:02:45.060> also<00:02:45.660> the<00:02:45.959> ISO<00:02:46.260> settings

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
because you have also the ISO settings

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.420 
because you have also the ISO settings
what's<00:02:47.610> the<00:02:47.850> best<00:02:48.090> thing<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.360> use<00:02:48.600> is<00:02:48.780> actually

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
what's the best thing to use is actually

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:52.970 
what's the best thing to use is actually
have<00:02:50.430> like<00:02:50.730> really<00:02:51.180> dark<00:02:51.390> and<00:02:51.690> D<00:02:52.290> filters<00:02:52.709> like

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:52.980 
have like really dark and D filters like

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
have like really dark and D filters like
what<00:02:53.459> i'm<00:02:53.580> using<00:02:53.820> andy<00:02:54.330> 16<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:55.160> even<00:02:56.160> adding<00:02:56.790> an

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
what i'm using andy 16 on even adding an

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.540 
what i'm using andy 16 on even adding an
ND<00:02:57.570> eight<00:02:57.720> in<00:02:57.930> front<00:02:58.200> of<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:58.650> then

00:02:59.540 --> 00:02:59.550 
ND eight in front of it and then

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.030 
ND eight in front of it and then
actually<00:02:59.760> amp<00:03:00.150> up<00:03:00.480> the<00:03:00.720> iso<00:03:01.230> so<00:03:01.860> when<00:03:02.700> it's

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
actually amp up the iso so when it's

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.220 
actually amp up the iso so when it's
when<00:03:05.040> it's<00:03:05.070> cloudy<00:03:05.489> you<00:03:05.880> can<00:03:06.090> actually<00:03:06.330> amp<00:03:06.870> up

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
when it's cloudy you can actually amp up

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:09.050 
when it's cloudy you can actually amp up
the<00:03:07.440> hour<00:03:07.590> or<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.010> and<00:03:08.220> when<00:03:08.489> it's<00:03:08.670> really

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
the hour or so and when it's really

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.350 
the hour or so and when it's really
sunny<00:03:09.650> lowered<00:03:10.650> down<00:03:11.130> the<00:03:11.400> iso<00:03:11.760> again<00:03:12.090> and

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
sunny lowered down the iso again and

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:18.170 
sunny lowered down the iso again and
then<00:03:12.510> have<00:03:13.019> the<00:03:14.209> yeah<00:03:15.209> have<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:16.950> bit<00:03:17.700> of<00:03:17.730> playing

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
then have the yeah have a bit of playing

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:21.199 
then have the yeah have a bit of playing
room<00:03:18.630> so<00:03:19.320> you<00:03:19.380> don't<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:19.980> to<00:03:20.220> change<00:03:20.489> the<00:03:20.850> ND

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
room so you don't have to change the ND

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.150 
room so you don't have to change the ND
filters<00:03:21.570> all<00:03:21.750> the<00:03:21.870> time<00:03:22.049> and<00:03:22.260> just<00:03:22.500> change<00:03:22.950> the

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
filters all the time and just change the

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.210 
filters all the time and just change the
ISO<00:03:23.280> settings<00:03:23.850> which<00:03:24.450> helps<00:03:24.840> setting<00:03:25.709> up<00:03:25.829> for

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
ISO settings which helps setting up for

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.620 
ISO settings which helps setting up for
filming<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.829> yeah<00:03:28.829> mostly<00:03:29.250> that's<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:30.060> tip

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
filming and yeah mostly that's the tip

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:33.319 
filming and yeah mostly that's the tip
i'm<00:03:31.170> using<00:03:31.590> coking<00:03:32.160> filter<00:03:32.610> because<00:03:32.910> it's

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:33.329 
i'm using coking filter because it's

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:36.740 
i'm using coking filter because it's
easy<00:03:33.739> and<00:03:34.739> because<00:03:35.610> you<00:03:35.730> can<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.150> also

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
easy and because you can and also

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.259 
easy and because you can and also
cheaper<00:03:37.290> to<00:03:37.440> use<00:03:37.470> at<00:03:37.860> different<00:03:38.579> on<00:03:39.209> different

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269 
cheaper to use at different on different

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:41.600 
cheaper to use at different on different
lenses<00:03:40.079> because<00:03:40.739> you<00:03:40.950> can<00:03:41.130> change<00:03:41.459> the

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
lenses because you can change the

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:44.750 
lenses because you can change the
adapter<00:03:42.090> instead<00:03:42.450> of<00:03:42.630> actually<00:03:43.200> using<00:03:43.760> our

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:44.760 
adapter instead of actually using our

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:46.819 
adapter instead of actually using our
buying<00:03:45.120> different<00:03:45.420> ND<00:03:45.930> filters<00:03:46.290> and<00:03:46.530> now<00:03:46.769> the

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:46.829 
buying different ND filters and now the

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.670 
buying different ND filters and now the
sun<00:03:47.370> is<00:03:47.400> gone<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.049> stark<00:03:49.049> so<00:03:49.320> see<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.650> next

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
sun is gone and stark so see you next

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.160 
sun is gone and stark so see you next
time<00:03:49.950> right
