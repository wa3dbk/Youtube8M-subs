this is a wonderful device while you are
on<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:18.729> it's<00:05:18.880> very<00:05:19.120> intuitive<00:05:19.630> as<00:05:19.780> it<00:05:20.200> should

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
on it it's very intuitive as it should

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:22.350 
on it it's very intuitive as it should
be<00:05:20.530> since<00:05:20.800> its<00:05:20.950> inspired<00:05:21.280> by<00:05:21.490> one<00:05:22.210> of<00:05:22.300> the

greatest UI innovations of all time the

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:27.420 
greatest UI innovations of all time the
mi<00:05:24.880> amigo<00:05:25.300> as<00:05:25.900> well<00:05:26.139> as<00:05:26.289> you<00:05:26.620> know<00:05:26.740> it's<00:05:27.190> taken

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
mi amigo as well as you know it's taken

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.070 
mi amigo as well as you know it's taken
some<00:05:27.550> innovations<00:05:28.060> from<00:05:28.180> Symbian<00:05:28.660> which

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:29.080 
some innovations from Symbian which

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:32.250 
some innovations from Symbian which
although<00:05:29.320> didn't<00:05:29.650> have<00:05:29.740> the<00:05:29.889> best<00:05:31.139> what's<00:05:32.139> a

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
although didn't have the best what's a

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:35.490 
although didn't have the best what's a
cosmetic<00:05:32.770> look<00:05:32.950> was<00:05:33.580> in<00:05:34.030> honesty<00:05:34.960> quite

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
cosmetic look was in honesty quite

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.879 
cosmetic look was in honesty quite
functional<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:37.229> that's<00:05:38.229> it<00:05:38.410> of<00:05:38.560> course<00:05:38.710> you

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:38.889 
functional so that's it of course you

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:40.440 
functional so that's it of course you
can<00:05:39.010> also<00:05:39.130> see<00:05:39.310> the<00:05:39.580> little<00:05:39.789> cool<00:05:39.970> animations

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:40.450 
can also see the little cool animations

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.820 
can also see the little cool animations
for<00:05:40.630> increasing<00:05:41.050> the<00:05:41.110> volume<00:05:41.260> or<00:05:41.440> decreasing

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:41.830 
for increasing the volume or decreasing

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:43.379 
for increasing the volume or decreasing
it<00:05:41.919> which<00:05:42.070> is<00:05:42.190> really<00:05:42.430> cool<00:05:42.610> I<00:05:42.820> mean<00:05:43.090> even<00:05:43.300> my

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:43.389 
it which is really cool I mean even my

00:05:43.389 --> 00:05:44.909 
it which is really cool I mean even my
windows<00:05:43.660> 1<00:05:43.810> doesn't<00:05:44.020> do<00:05:44.080> that<00:05:44.260> so<00:05:44.860> that's

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:44.919 
windows 1 doesn't do that so that's

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:47.430 
windows 1 doesn't do that so that's
really<00:05:45.130> cool<00:05:45.310> animation<00:05:45.700> and<00:05:46.349> that's<00:05:47.349> about

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
really cool animation and that's about

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:51.690 
really cool animation and that's about
it<00:05:47.530> for<00:05:47.889> the<00:05:48.099> UI<00:05:48.430> on<00:05:48.970> the<00:05:49.120> device<00:05:49.330> and<00:05:50.700> look

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
it for the UI on the device and look
