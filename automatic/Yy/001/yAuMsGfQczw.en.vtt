okay<00:00:00.960> guys<00:00:01.170> I'm<00:00:01.350> gonna<00:00:01.439> put<00:00:01.650> together<00:00:01.740> a

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
okay guys I'm gonna put together a

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:04.999 
okay guys I'm gonna put together a
little<00:00:02.370> clip<00:00:02.669> today<00:00:03.200> about<00:00:04.200> the<00:00:04.440> ground<00:00:04.680> cast

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
little clip today about the ground cast

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.320 
little clip today about the ground cast
my<00:00:05.640> version<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.029> ground<00:00:06.330> cast<00:00:06.569> anyway<00:00:08.330> some

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
my version the ground cast anyway some

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.480 
my version the ground cast anyway some
of<00:00:09.360> the<00:00:09.480> fundamentals<00:00:10.139> that<00:00:10.349> I<00:00:10.500> that<00:00:11.340> I<00:00:11.460> have

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
of the fundamentals that I that I have

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.450 
of the fundamentals that I that I have
learned<00:00:11.940> and<00:00:12.269> have<00:00:12.780> come<00:00:13.019> to<00:00:13.380> use<00:00:13.650> fairly

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
learned and have come to use fairly

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.720 
learned and have come to use fairly
successfully<00:00:15.230> of<00:00:16.230> the<00:00:16.379> ground<00:00:16.619> cast<00:00:16.890> we<00:00:17.580> give

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
successfully of the ground cast we give

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
successfully of the ground cast we give
a<00:00:17.760> little<00:00:17.940> bit<00:00:18.029> of<00:00:18.090> history<00:00:18.300> first<00:00:20.750> 2006

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
a little bit of history first 2006

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.340 
a little bit of history first 2006
actually<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.230> late<00:00:22.380> 2005<00:00:23.189> I<00:00:23.580> learned<00:00:24.510> about<00:00:24.689> an

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
actually in late 2005 I learned about an

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.230 
actually in late 2005 I learned about an
event<00:00:25.740> it<00:00:26.340> was<00:00:26.430> going<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.609> be<00:00:26.699> held<00:00:26.910> over<00:00:27.150> in

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
event it was going to be held over in

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:28.670 
event it was going to be held over in
the<00:00:27.300> UK<00:00:27.449> called<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> Primo<00:00:28.230> event<00:00:28.500> and

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
the UK called the Primo event and

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.080 
the UK called the Primo event and
everybody's<00:00:29.130> familiar<00:00:29.250> with<00:00:29.550> it<00:00:29.640> now<00:00:29.789> but<00:00:29.970> at

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
everybody's familiar with it now but at

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.250 
everybody's familiar with it now but at
that<00:00:30.179> time<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.630> was<00:00:30.750> it<00:00:31.320> was<00:00:31.470> something<00:00:31.830> new<00:00:32.000> I

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:33.260 
that time it was it was something new I

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:35.600 
that time it was it was something new I
really<00:00:34.260> wanted<00:00:34.469> to<00:00:34.530> come<00:00:34.649> over<00:00:34.829> and<00:00:35.040> cast<00:00:35.250> in

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
really wanted to come over and cast in

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.160 
really wanted to come over and cast in
the<00:00:35.700> UK<00:00:36.030> I'd<00:00:36.270> been<00:00:36.450> wanting<00:00:36.600> to<00:00:36.719> for<00:00:36.960> a<00:00:37.020> long

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
the UK I'd been wanting to for a long

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.389 
the UK I'd been wanting to for a long
time<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.800> looked<00:00:37.980> like<00:00:38.040> the<00:00:38.129> best

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
time and this looked like the best

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.450 
time and this looked like the best
possible<00:00:39.020> opportunity<00:00:40.020> for<00:00:40.170> me<00:00:40.290> anyway<00:00:41.129> I

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
possible opportunity for me anyway I

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
possible opportunity for me anyway I
found<00:00:41.879> out<00:00:42.120> from<00:00:42.300> Peter<00:00:42.450> thing<00:00:42.750> that<00:00:42.989> the<00:00:43.050> main

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
found out from Peter thing that the main

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.560 
found out from Peter thing that the main
event<00:00:43.620> of<00:00:43.829> this<00:00:44.430> tournament<00:00:44.969> was<00:00:45.149> going<00:00:45.329> to<00:00:45.390> be

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
event of this tournament was going to be

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.650 
event of this tournament was going to be
ground<00:00:45.930> casting<00:00:46.469> I<00:00:46.850> knew<00:00:47.850> pretty<00:00:48.149> quick<00:00:48.480> that

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
ground casting I knew pretty quick that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.180 
ground casting I knew pretty quick that
I<00:00:48.750> had<00:00:48.930> trouble<00:00:49.350> because<00:00:49.469> I<00:00:49.710> had<00:00:49.860> never

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
I had trouble because I had never

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.700 
I had trouble because I had never
learned<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.329> ground<00:00:51.600> cast<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.410> didn't

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
learned to ground cast I really didn't

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.369 
learned to ground cast I really didn't
know<00:00:52.800> how<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> do<00:00:53.190> it<00:00:53.420> my<00:00:54.420> learning<00:00:54.989> curve<00:00:55.020> was

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
know how to do it my learning curve was

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.470 
know how to do it my learning curve was
was<00:00:55.710> reversed<00:00:56.309> it<00:00:56.550> was<00:00:56.640> backwards<00:00:56.879> really<00:00:57.239> on

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
was reversed it was backwards really on

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.099 
was reversed it was backwards really on
this<00:00:57.629> whole<00:00:57.809> thing

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
this whole thing

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.920 
this whole thing
I<00:00:58.320> started<00:00:59.070> out<00:00:59.219> learning<00:00:59.609> while<00:01:00.539> we<00:01:00.690> call<00:01:00.899> a

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
I started out learning while we call a

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.560 
I started out learning while we call a
Hatter's<00:01:01.350> cats<00:01:01.649> cast<00:01:02.100> or<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.430> basic<00:01:02.820> Beach<00:01:03.210> cast

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
Hatter's cats cast or a basic Beach cast

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.440 
Hatter's cats cast or a basic Beach cast
I<00:01:04.369> progressed<00:01:05.369> from<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.640> straight<00:01:06.210> through

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
I progressed from that straight through

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.730 
I progressed from that straight through
a<00:01:06.479> pendulum<00:01:06.810> cast<00:01:07.170> when<00:01:07.380> I<00:01:07.439> started

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
a pendulum cast when I started

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.590 
a pendulum cast when I started
tournament<00:01:08.130> casting<00:01:08.520> uh<00:01:08.670> none<00:01:09.330> of<00:01:09.360> the<00:01:09.420> guys

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
tournament casting uh none of the guys

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.170 
tournament casting uh none of the guys
over<00:01:09.840> here<00:01:10.140> really<00:01:10.409> did<00:01:11.040> any<00:01:11.460> ground<00:01:11.760> casting

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
over here really did any ground casting

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.210 
over here really did any ground casting
at<00:01:12.270> all<00:01:12.390> very<00:01:12.750> little<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.619> I<00:01:13.650> didn't<00:01:13.890> learn<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
at all very little so I didn't learn it

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.789 
at all very little so I didn't learn it
I<00:01:15.950> became<00:01:16.950> fairly<00:01:17.759> proficient<00:01:18.240> with<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.409> flat

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
I became fairly proficient with the flat

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.310 
I became fairly proficient with the flat
arc<00:01:20.040> style<00:01:20.460> pendulum<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.240> in<00:01:21.720> my<00:01:21.840> mind<00:01:22.140> the

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
arc style pendulum and in my mind the

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:23.870 
arc style pendulum and in my mind the
way<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.590> I<00:01:22.619> approached<00:01:23.009> this<00:01:23.220> was<00:01:23.430> kind<00:01:23.670> of<00:01:23.729> a

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
way that I approached this was kind of a

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.010 
way that I approached this was kind of a
reverse<00:01:24.330> engineering<00:01:25.220> approach<00:01:26.220> I<00:01:27.020> figured

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
reverse engineering approach I figured

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.810 
reverse engineering approach I figured
I'd<00:01:28.110> take<00:01:28.290> what<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.530> knew<00:01:28.829> about<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:29.250> flat<00:01:29.670> our

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
I'd take what I knew about a flat our

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.530 
I'd take what I knew about a flat our
pendulum<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:30.479> apply<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> ground<00:01:32.130> cast

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
pendulum and apply that to a ground cast

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:35.690 
pendulum and apply that to a ground cast
and<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:33.659> really<00:01:34.200> seemed<00:01:34.590> to<00:01:34.619> work<00:01:34.799> pretty<00:01:35.579> well

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
and it really seemed to work pretty well

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.219 
and it really seemed to work pretty well
anyway<00:01:36.390> I'm<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> cover<00:01:37.200> what<00:01:37.950> I<00:01:38.150> want<00:01:39.150> my<00:01:39.450> ideas

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
anyway I'm a cover what I want my ideas

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.080 
anyway I'm a cover what I want my ideas

great<00:01:50.759> thing<00:01:50.790> about<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.420> ground<00:01:51.689> cast<00:01:51.930> is<00:01:52.140> it

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
great thing about the ground cast is it

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.719 
great thing about the ground cast is it
allows<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.770> practice<00:01:52.979> sound

pretty<00:04:12.780> good<00:04:12.930> numbers<00:04:13.110> with<00:04:13.409> it<00:04:14.060> almost<00:04:15.060> 250

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:15.900 
pretty good numbers with it almost 250
