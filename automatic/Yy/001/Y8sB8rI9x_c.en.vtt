 how to start skating 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:35.610
 our operator Michael after filming the first 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:37.980
 roller so fired up desire 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.460

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:43.010
 to refuse 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.010

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:00.310
 Hello, I'm a snowboard instructor and 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:03.880
 freestyle my name is denis today we 

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:06.910
 We will study the basic level of parking 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:09.370
 exactly how we move on it for 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.150
 start let's show michael where we have that 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:14.350
 it costs them 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.420
 but tired Tyler and two mounts here 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.420
 actually learned about freedom all 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.550
 they practice Michael sit on the shelf and 

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:38.380
 dress snowboard 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:41.950
 I also did well, that's actually 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.820
 let's start the first exercise is to go to 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.930
 rear edge 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:50.740
 we need to get up first we 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:53.040
 we pull up a snowboard set ourselves either 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:57.009
 left or right hand no difference near 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.440
 yourself second hand stretch forward and 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.630
 the main thing is not to immediately get up and do 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.110
 moving forward otherwise we will roll 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.119
 snowboarding namely more up 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.429
 Here we rely on the rear edge 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.670
 it is exactly back you can even here 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.810
 so here 's a whole prop is everything 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.989
 we start to rush 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.030
 and at this point you do not need the case 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:22.630
 feed forward need feed it up 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:25.350
 all here we are tired now we are already standing on 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.630
 the back cante is already starting to move 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.700
 for this you need to bend your knees slightly 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.430
 in front of you elbows bent look at 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:42.750

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:07.610
 for we need to return we need 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:12.230

 straighten your legs with you to make it easier 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:22.250
 arm swings hug the slope 

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:29.600
 and turn on the front edge all 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:32.150
 we are at the front cante mich cool 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:35.120

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:35.810
 knees helping yourself to lean on 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.310
 front to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:45.200
 we will not stand now we begin to move 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:51.900
 we lower the center of mass on the heels and 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:57.230
 starts with moving the area anymore 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:57.230

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:25.310
 cante micha repel now not to break 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:28.060
 hands do not move wrists and do not break 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.180
 forearm i will show the technique of falling 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:34.130
 a moment you remember then you will repeat 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.720
 if we ride with you in the back rim 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.270
 face forward and random 

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:40.690
 front edge and start moving 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.660
 ahead and the board stays in place . 

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:47.240
 first kneel on one elbow in no way 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.389
 case you can not pull off your hands like 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:53.330
 turtle and fall on them well because 

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:56.860
 it will hurt and you can break them down so 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.860
 showing how it's done 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:10.259
 something like this 

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:13.080

00:05:20.849 --> 00:05:26.250
 go to the front cant in that direction and 

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:29.310
