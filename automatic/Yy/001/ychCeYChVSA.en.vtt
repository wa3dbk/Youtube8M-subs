closer you get at the view via your
funder<00:01:50.420> is<00:01:50.509> fake<00:01:50.720> still<00:01:51.020> you'll<00:01:51.560> find<00:01:51.860> that

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
funder is fake still you'll find that

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.660 
funder is fake still you'll find that
what<00:01:52.849> you<00:01:53.060> see<00:01:53.330> is<00:01:53.630> is<00:01:54.259> actually<00:01:54.890> different<00:01:55.220> to

other lines sees this actually tries to
correct<00:01:58.280> that<00:01:58.429> by<00:01:58.610> the<00:01:58.670> review

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
correct that by the review

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.539 
correct that by the review
find<00:01:59.570> with<00:02:00.380> the<00:02:00.530> focus<00:02:01.150> very<00:02:02.150> interesting

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
find with the focus very interesting

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:05.740 
find with the focus very interesting
fascinating<00:02:04.549> for<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.729> camera<00:02:05.090> made<00:02:05.479> in<00:02:05.630> the

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
fascinating for a camera made in the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:09.520 
fascinating for a camera made in the
fifties<00:02:06.430> fabulous<00:02:07.430> thing<00:02:07.959> the<00:02:08.959> lens<00:02:09.140> itself

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
fifties fabulous thing the lens itself

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.500 
fifties fabulous thing the lens itself
is<00:02:09.800> is<00:02:10.130> yet<00:02:10.399> another<00:02:10.520> marvel<00:02:11.060> of<00:02:11.120> engineering

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.840 

so<00:02:14.510> the<00:02:14.900> camera<00:02:15.290> has<00:02:15.770> anyone<00:02:16.130> who's<00:02:16.340> seen<00:02:16.550> it<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
here you've got a little slider push

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.759 
here you've got a little slider push
this<00:02:47.959> along<00:02:48.230> and<00:02:48.500> got<00:02:49.540> two<00:02:50.540> different<00:02:50.769> color

00:02:51.759 --> 00:02:51.769 
this along and got two different color

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:53.770 
this along and got two different color
filters<00:02:52.310> you<00:02:52.400> got<00:02:52.580> a<00:02:52.730> red<00:02:52.970> filter<00:02:53.239> which<00:02:53.569> could

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
filters you got a red filter which could

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.190 
filters you got a red filter which could
probably<00:02:54.019> just<00:02:54.410> see<00:02:54.680> and<00:02:55.640> a<00:02:56.540> green<00:02:56.900> filter

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200
