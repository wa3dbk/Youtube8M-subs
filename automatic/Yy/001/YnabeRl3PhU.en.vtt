panoramic images stitch panoramix
are<00:00:15.119> how<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.419> can<00:00:15.659> take<00:00:15.869> a<00:00:15.900> series<00:00:16.379> of<00:00:16.410> images

00:00:16.579 --> 00:00:16.589 
are how you can take a series of images

00:00:16.589 --> 00:00:18.919 
are how you can take a series of images
and<00:00:17.070> join<00:00:17.670> them<00:00:17.880> together<00:00:18.029> to<00:00:18.390> capture<00:00:18.570> very

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:18.929 
and join them together to capture very

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:22.370 
and join them together to capture very
wide<00:00:19.289> or<00:00:19.919> very<00:00:20.220> tall<00:00:20.279> field<00:00:20.820> of<00:00:20.970> view<00:00:21.380> much

wide or very tall field of view much
wider<00:00:22.710> or<00:00:22.919> taller<00:00:22.949> then<00:00:23.640> you<00:00:23.759> could<00:00:23.939> capture

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
wider or taller then you could capture

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.569 
wider or taller then you could capture
with<00:00:24.539> wide-angle<00:00:25.109> lens<00:00:25.289> in<00:00:25.619> fact<00:00:26.310> you<00:00:26.429> can

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:26.579 
with wide-angle lens in fact you can

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:28.279 
with wide-angle lens in fact you can
actually<00:00:26.759> capture<00:00:27.089> an<00:00:27.359> image<00:00:27.419> this<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.019> a<00:00:28.079> full

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:28.289 
actually capture an image this is a full

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.970 
actually capture an image this is a full
360<00:00:28.829> degrees<00:00:29.400> around<00:00:33.440> the<00:00:34.440> first<00:00:34.710> thing<00:00:34.890> we

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
360 degrees around the first thing we

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.680 
360 degrees around the first thing we
need<00:00:35.129> to<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.670> level<00:00:35.940> the<00:00:36.090> top<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.570> your

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
need to do is level the top of your

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.689 
need to do is level the top of your
tripod<00:00:36.899> or<00:00:37.320> the<00:00:37.649> bottom<00:00:38.010> of<00:00:38.070> your<00:00:38.129> tripod<00:00:38.520> head

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:38.699 
tripod or the bottom of your tripod head

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:40.369 
tripod or the bottom of your tripod head
so<00:00:39.149> we<00:00:39.239> can<00:00:39.270> be<00:00:39.480> panning<00:00:39.809> parallel<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.260> the

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
so we can be panning parallel to the

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.279 
so we can be panning parallel to the
horizon<00:00:41.149> easiest<00:00:42.149> way<00:00:42.270> to<00:00:42.300> do<00:00:42.539> this<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.170> use

00:00:43.279 --> 00:00:43.289 
horizon easiest way to do this is to use

00:00:43.289 --> 00:00:46.000 
horizon easiest way to do this is to use
a<00:00:43.320> leveling<00:00:43.710> base<00:00:43.890> with<00:00:44.699> leveling<00:00:45.120> base

a leveling base with leveling base
installed<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:48.410> you<00:00:49.410> simply<00:00:49.620> loosen<00:00:50.039> the

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
installed here you simply loosen the

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.580 
installed here you simply loosen the
knob<00:00:50.600> adjust<00:00:51.600> it<00:00:51.719> until<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:52.079> bubbles<00:00:52.379> in<00:00:52.500> the

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
knob adjust it until the bubbles in the

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.540 
knob adjust it until the bubbles in the
center<00:00:52.829> of<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.949> circle<00:00:53.359> and<00:00:54.359> tighten<00:00:55.199> it<00:00:55.260> down

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
center of the circle and tighten it down

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.009 
center of the circle and tighten it down
if<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.730> are<00:00:56.820> not<00:00:56.969> panning<00:00:57.329> parallel<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.009 --> 00:00:58.019 
if you are not panning parallel to the

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.319 
if you are not panning parallel to the
horizon<00:00:58.579> when<00:00:59.579> you<00:00:59.670> stitch<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.089> image

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
horizon when you stitch the image

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:01.669 
horizon when you stitch the image
together<00:01:00.510> you<00:01:00.989> will<00:01:01.109> wind<00:01:01.320> up<00:01:01.500> with<00:01:01.649> a

00:01:01.669 --> 00:01:01.679 
together you will wind up with a

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:04.400 
together you will wind up with a
stair-stepped<00:01:02.309> image<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.929> when<00:01:03.929> you<00:01:04.019> crop<00:01:04.230> it

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:04.410 
stair-stepped image and when you crop it

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.960 
stair-stepped image and when you crop it
you<00:01:04.530> will<00:01:04.650> lose<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:04.980> top<00:01:05.190> and<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.550> bottom<00:01:05.850> of

you will lose the top and the bottom of
your<00:01:06.030> image<00:01:07.850> now<00:01:08.850> let's<00:01:09.480> level<00:01:09.690> the<00:01:09.840> top<00:01:09.990> of
