00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
figure which is the same exact body as

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.080 
figure which is the same exact body as
this<00:02:53.739> one<00:02:53.950> right<00:02:54.160> over<00:02:54.190> here<00:02:54.430> so<00:02:54.819> they<00:02:55.030> do

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.090 
this one right over here so they do

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:57.030 
this one right over here so they do
share<00:02:55.390> the<00:02:55.540> same<00:02:55.720> exact<00:02:55.989> body<00:02:56.230> mold<00:02:56.500> but<00:02:56.950> they

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
share the same exact body mold but they

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.830 
share the same exact body mold but they
do<00:02:57.099> have<00:02:57.430> completely<00:02:57.849> different<00:02:58.090> head<00:02:58.450> scopes

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
do have completely different head scopes

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.380 
do have completely different head scopes
and<00:02:59.080> I<00:02:59.500> believe<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.069> is<00:03:00.129> not<00:03:00.280> the<00:03:00.879> same<00:03:01.090> head

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:01.390 
and I believe this is not the same head

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.289 
and I believe this is not the same head
sculpt<00:03:01.840> as<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.440> SDCC<00:03:03.310> version<00:03:03.700> I<00:03:03.790> did<00:03:03.940> look<00:03:04.150> it

00:03:04.289 --> 00:03:04.299 
sculpt as the SDCC version I did look it

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:06.150 
sculpt as the SDCC version I did look it
up<00:03:04.420> and<00:03:04.629> they<00:03:04.690> did<00:03:05.019> have<00:03:05.200> different<00:03:05.920> mouths

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
up and they did have different mouths

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.890 
up and they did have different mouths
and<00:03:06.610> it<00:03:06.849> just<00:03:07.060> looks<00:03:07.269> different<00:03:07.660> so<00:03:07.750> I<00:03:07.780> think

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
and it just looks different so I think

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.930 
and it just looks different so I think
this<00:03:08.200> is<00:03:08.319> a<00:03:08.349> brand<00:03:08.799> new<00:03:08.920> head<00:03:09.250> sculpt<00:03:09.640> here<00:03:09.730> and
