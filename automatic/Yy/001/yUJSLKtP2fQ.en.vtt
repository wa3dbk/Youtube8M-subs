we did a video on how to create glowing

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.109 
we did a video on how to create glowing
skin<00:00:16.289> from<00:00:16.650> the<00:00:16.770> inside<00:00:17.279> out<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.760> we<00:00:17.880> talked

skin from the inside out and we talked
about<00:00:18.270> selenium<00:00:19.080> which<00:00:19.289> is<00:00:19.500> one<00:00:19.680> of<00:00:19.770> the

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
about selenium which is one of the

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:25.130 
about selenium which is one of the
sources<00:00:20.130> of<00:00:21.320> creating<00:00:22.760> skin<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.750> keep<00:00:24.960> your

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
sources of creating skin to keep your

skin<00:00:25.500> from<00:00:25.949> having<00:00:26.310> sun<00:00:26.609> damage<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.420> Brazil

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
skin from having sun damage and Brazil

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
skin from having sun damage and Brazil
nuts<00:00:28.109> are<00:00:28.260> one<00:00:28.800> of<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.010> only<00:00:29.130> plant<00:00:29.609> sources

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
nuts are one of the only plant sources

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.560 
nuts are one of the only plant sources
of<00:00:30.390> selenium<00:00:31.250> so<00:00:32.250> Brazil<00:00:32.700> nuts<00:00:32.880> are<00:00:33.030> a<00:00:33.090> great

potassium calcium iron phosphorus and
zinc<00:00:59.180> so<00:01:00.180> the<00:01:00.840> way<00:01:00.960> you<00:01:01.020> do<00:01:01.469> that<00:01:02.309> milks<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.820> you

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
zinc so the way you do that milks is you

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.960 
zinc so the way you do that milks is you
do<00:01:03.270> a<00:01:03.300> cup<00:01:03.930> of<00:01:04.350> nuts<00:01:05.810> two<00:01:06.810> cups<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.320> water<00:01:07.970> so
