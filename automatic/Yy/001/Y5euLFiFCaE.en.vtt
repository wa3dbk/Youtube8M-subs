better<00:00:52.600> gressive<00:00:52.960> freakin<00:00:53.260> player<00:00:53.440> while

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:53.980 
better gressive freakin player while

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.610 
better gressive freakin player while
using<00:00:54.190> a<00:00:54.400> pump<00:00:54.610> action<00:00:54.820> shotgun<00:00:55.420> so<00:00:56.170> even

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:56.620 
using a pump action shotgun so even

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.080 
using a pump action shotgun so even
though<00:00:56.650> the<00:00:56.920> hit<00:00:57.040> wreck<00:00:57.190> sometimes<00:00:57.820> screws

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090 
though the hit wreck sometimes screws

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.760 
though the hit wreck sometimes screws
you<00:00:58.210> over<00:00:58.239> just<00:00:58.690> like<00:00:58.840> me<00:00:58.989> right<00:00:59.140> there<00:00:59.350> i<00:00:59.560> was

00:00:59.760 --> 00:00:59.770 
you over just like me right there i was

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:01.410 
you over just like me right there i was
using<00:00:59.920> back<00:01:00.160> shots<00:01:00.370> so<00:01:00.520> i'm<00:01:00.820> very<00:01:00.850> sure<00:01:01.390> i

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:01.420 
using back shots so i'm very sure i

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.940 
using back shots so i'm very sure i
should<00:01:01.690> have<00:01:01.810> been<00:01:01.930> able<00:01:02.020> to<00:01:02.200> that<00:01:02.410> guy<00:01:02.530> but

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:02.950 
should have been able to that guy but

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.639 
should have been able to that guy but
anyways<00:01:03.280> rim<00:01:04.059> of<00:01:04.210> sniping<00:01:04.689> it<00:01:04.930> basically<00:01:05.350> is

00:01:05.639 --> 00:01:05.649 
anyways rim of sniping it basically is

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:07.560 
anyways rim of sniping it basically is
dictated<00:01:06.250> by<00:01:06.250> the<00:01:06.460> rate<00:01:06.640> of<00:01:06.670> fire<00:01:06.939> because<00:01:07.329> we

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
dictated by the rate of fire because we

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.940 
dictated by the rate of fire because we
all<00:01:07.689> know<00:01:07.840> that<00:01:07.869> we<00:01:08.229> have<00:01:08.380> to<00:01:08.500> reach<00:01:08.649> amber

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
all know that we have to reach amber

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.010 
all know that we have to reach amber
each<00:01:09.070> round<00:01:09.340> individually<00:01:10.060> which<00:01:10.600> basically

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
each round individually which basically

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:12.629 
each round individually which basically
means<00:01:11.289> that<00:01:11.560> we<00:01:11.679> have<00:01:11.710> a<00:01:11.829> down<00:01:12.130> time<00:01:12.369> where

00:01:12.629 --> 00:01:12.639 
means that we have a down time where

00:01:12.639 --> 00:01:15.270 
means that we have a down time where
we're<00:01:12.850> not<00:01:12.880> able<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.509> fire<00:01:13.749> our<00:01:13.990> rifle<00:01:14.590> this

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
we're not able to fire our rifle this

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:17.099 
we're not able to fire our rifle this
kind<00:01:15.460> of<00:01:15.579> again<00:01:15.819> dictates<00:01:16.329> how<00:01:16.600> the<00:01:16.659> rifle<00:01:17.049> is

00:01:17.099 --> 00:01:17.109 
kind of again dictates how the rifle is

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:18.510 
kind of again dictates how the rifle is
supposed<00:01:17.439> to<00:01:17.530> be<00:01:17.649> played<00:01:17.889> again<00:01:18.039> high<00:01:18.340> rate<00:01:18.490> of

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
supposed to be played again high rate of

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.879 
supposed to be played again high rate of
fire<00:01:18.639> usually<00:01:19.210> means<00:01:19.420> better<00:01:19.840> up<00:01:19.990> close<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.469> a

00:01:20.879 --> 00:01:20.889 
fire usually means better up close and a

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:22.739 
fire usually means better up close and a
low<00:01:21.039> rate<00:01:21.219> of<00:01:21.369> fire<00:01:21.549> usually<00:01:22.179> means<00:01:22.389> because

00:01:22.739 --> 00:01:22.749 
low rate of fire usually means because

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:24.660 
low rate of fire usually means because
usually<00:01:23.079> has<00:01:23.469> a<00:01:23.499> higher<00:01:23.740> velocity<00:01:23.889> around

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:24.670 
usually has a higher velocity around

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.309 
usually has a higher velocity around
then<00:01:24.880> that<00:01:25.270> it's<00:01:25.420> better<00:01:25.630> suited<00:01:26.259> for

00:01:26.309 --> 00:01:26.319 
then that it's better suited for

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:28.529 
then that it's better suited for
long-range<00:01:26.859> sniping<00:01:27.340> of<00:01:27.520> course<00:01:28.149> these<00:01:28.479> are

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
long-range sniping of course these are

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:30.959 
long-range sniping of course these are
only<00:01:29.020> the<00:01:29.200> stats<00:01:29.619> on<00:01:29.829> paper<00:01:30.219> and<00:01:30.609> what<00:01:30.880> they

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:30.969 
only the stats on paper and what they

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:33.120 
only the stats on paper and what they
look<00:01:31.149> like<00:01:31.179> now<00:01:31.630> when<00:01:32.229> I<00:01:32.259> say<00:01:32.469> that<00:01:32.649> should<00:01:32.799> dry

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
look like now when I say that should dry

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.129 
look like now when I say that should dry
out<00:01:33.159> each<00:01:33.520> sniper<00:01:33.819> rifle<00:01:34.420> individually<00:01:35.020> and

00:01:35.129 --> 00:01:35.139 
out each sniper rifle individually and

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:36.310 
too well become a better aggressive

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:38.220 
too well become a better aggressive
freaking<00:02:36.520> player<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:37.300> course<00:02:37.600> if<00:02:37.780> you're<00:02:37.990> now

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
freaking player of course if you're now

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:40.050 
freaking player of course if you're now
thinking<00:02:38.710> about<00:02:38.740> shotgun<00:02:39.250> sniper<00:02:39.550> rifles

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:40.060 
thinking about shotgun sniper rifles

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.480 
thinking about shotgun sniper rifles
they<00:02:40.690> actually<00:02:41.020> like<00:02:41.470> the<00:02:41.740> total<00:02:42.100> opposite

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
they actually like the total opposite

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.040 
they actually like the total opposite
because<00:02:42.730> one<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.150> them<00:02:43.360> is<00:02:43.420> actually<00:02:43.840> pretty

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.050 
because one of them is actually pretty

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:45.960 
because one of them is actually pretty
inaccurate<00:02:44.380> firing<00:02:45.070> back<00:02:45.250> shots<00:02:45.520> it's<00:02:45.760> meant

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
inaccurate firing back shots it's meant

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:47.610 
inaccurate firing back shots it's meant
for<00:02:46.000> close<00:02:46.270> range<00:02:46.360> the<00:02:46.930> other<00:02:47.050> one<00:02:47.230> is<00:02:47.260> super

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
for close range the other one is super

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.520 
for close range the other one is super
accurate<00:02:47.770> and<00:02:48.280> meant<00:02:49.060> for<00:02:49.210> long-range

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
accurate and meant for long-range

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.110 
accurate and meant for long-range
however<00:02:50.530> if<00:02:50.830> you<00:02:51.070> also<00:02:51.370> look<00:02:51.580> at<00:02:51.730> this<00:02:51.850> point

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
however if you also look at this point

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.430 
however if you also look at this point
you<00:02:52.240> see<00:02:52.420> that<00:02:52.540> both<00:02:52.720> of<00:02:52.750> them<00:02:53.050> are<00:02:53.230> very

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
you see that both of them are very

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.350 
you see that both of them are very
situational<00:02:54.130> weapons<00:02:54.520> which<00:02:54.850> again<00:02:55.090> means

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
situational weapons which again means

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:56.730 
situational weapons which again means
that<00:02:55.600> it<00:02:55.720> also<00:02:56.020> have<00:02:56.320> something<00:02:56.620> in<00:02:56.710> common

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
that it also have something in common

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:59.310 
that it also have something in common
our<00:02:57.190> first<00:02:57.400> point<00:02:57.610> next<00:02:58.510> point<00:02:58.660> is<00:02:58.840> that<00:02:59.110> they

00:02:59.310 --> 00:02:59.320 
our first point next point is that they

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.880 
our first point next point is that they
also<00:02:59.620> usually<00:03:00.430> tend<00:03:01.030> to<00:03:01.120> do<00:03:01.360> one<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.690> kills<00:03:02.020> the

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:02.890 
also usually tend to do one it kills the

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:04.350 
also usually tend to do one it kills the
next<00:03:03.070> point<00:03:03.190> that<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:03.430> have<00:03:03.550> in<00:03:03.670> common<00:03:03.940> would

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:04.360 
next point that you have in common would
