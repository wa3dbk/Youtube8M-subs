I<00:00:00.290> cut<00:00:01.290> a<00:00:01.319> thin<00:00:01.620> sheet<00:00:01.920> of<00:00:01.949> aluminum<00:00:02.520> for<00:00:02.639> the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
I cut a thin sheet of aluminum for the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.269 
I cut a thin sheet of aluminum for the
base<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.270> I<00:00:03.750> use<00:00:03.959> contact<00:00:04.529> cement<00:00:04.920> to<00:00:05.100> glue<00:00:05.130> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
base and I use contact cement to glue a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:10.310 
base and I use contact cement to glue a
sheet<00:00:05.490> of<00:00:05.609> cork<00:00:08.570> then<00:00:09.570> I<00:00:09.719> cut<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:09.929> block<00:00:10.080> of

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
sheet of cork then I cut a block of

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.009 
sheet of cork then I cut a block of
aluminum<00:00:10.710> for<00:00:10.889> the<00:00:10.980> locking<00:00:11.309> clamp<00:00:11.870> you<00:00:12.870> can

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
aluminum for the locking clamp you can

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.270 
aluminum for the locking clamp you can
use<00:00:13.139> a<00:00:13.170> block<00:00:13.349> of<00:00:13.559> wood<00:00:13.590> if<00:00:13.889> you<00:00:13.980> don't<00:00:14.160> have

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
use a block of wood if you don't have

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.010 
use a block of wood if you don't have
inch<00:00:14.429> in<00:00:14.610> the<00:00:14.700> pool

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:18.020 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:28.690 

I<00:00:25.210> also<00:00:26.210> drilled<00:00:26.750> a<00:00:26.840> couple<00:00:27.110> of<00:00:27.200> holes<00:00:27.490> one<00:00:28.490> for

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:28.700 
I also drilled a couple of holes one for

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.089 
I also drilled a couple of holes one for
holding<00:00:28.939> the<00:00:29.090> HDMI<00:00:29.689> cable<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.349> one<00:00:30.919> for

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:31.099 
holding the HDMI cable and one for

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:38.860 
holding the HDMI cable and one for
tightening<00:00:31.490> the<00:00:31.610> wing<00:00:31.640> nut<00:00:37.540> I'll<00:00:38.540> use<00:00:38.750> the

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:38.870 
tightening the wing nut I'll use the

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.810 
tightening the wing nut I'll use the
bandsaw<00:00:39.199> cut<00:00:39.650> it<00:00:39.769> into<00:00:39.890> two<00:00:40.129> pieces

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:40.820 
bandsaw cut it into two pieces

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:55.210 
bandsaw cut it into two pieces
I<00:00:52.870> used<00:00:53.870> my<00:00:54.049> mini<00:00:54.260> mill<00:00:54.470> and<00:00:54.710> a<00:00:54.739> fly<00:00:54.920> cutter

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
I used my mini mill and a fly cutter

00:00:55.220 --> 00:01:01.069 
I used my mini mill and a fly cutter
again<00:00:55.489> to<00:00:56.089> clean<00:00:56.269> up<00:00:56.360> the<00:00:56.479> bandsaw<00:00:56.900> cut

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.509 

I<00:01:02.899> use<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:03.929> tap<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.559> cut<00:01:04.739> threads<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.369> lower

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
I use a tap to cut threads in the lower

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.969 
I use a tap to cut threads in the lower
half<00:01:05.820> so<00:01:06.540> I<00:01:06.570> can<00:01:06.750> attach<00:01:07.049> a<00:01:07.200> bolt<00:01:07.470> with<00:01:07.890> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
half so I can attach a bolt with the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.280 
half so I can attach a bolt with the
head<00:01:08.130> cut<00:01:08.369> off<00:01:08.399> with<00:01:09.270> some<00:01:09.450> Loctite<00:01:09.659> to<00:01:09.930> hold

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290 
head cut off with some Loctite to hold

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.840 
head cut off with some Loctite to hold
it<00:01:10.409> in<00:01:10.500> place<00:01:16.009> all<00:01:17.009> that's<00:01:17.369> left<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.789> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
it in place all that's left is to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:26.240 
it in place all that's left is to
assemble<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.600> test<00:01:24.740> attach<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.979> bottom

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
assemble and test attach the bottom

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:35.240 
assemble and test attach the bottom
plate<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.149> tripod<00:01:27.360> mount<00:01:27.869> I<00:01:34.250> didn't

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250 
plate to the tripod mount I didn't

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.740 
plate to the tripod mount I didn't
happen<00:01:35.340> to<00:01:35.549> have<00:01:35.700> any<00:01:35.940> countersink<00:01:36.569> head

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
happen to have any countersink head

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.080 
happen to have any countersink head
bolts<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.770> I<00:01:37.799> use<00:01:38.039> these<00:01:38.220> round<00:01:38.520> head<00:01:38.729> bolts

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
bolts so I use these round head bolts

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.820 
bolts so I use these round head bolts
would<00:01:40.020> have<00:01:40.110> been<00:01:40.200> a<00:01:40.229> little<00:01:40.380> cleaner<00:01:40.590> but

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:40.830 
would have been a little cleaner but

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.040 
would have been a little cleaner but
these<00:01:41.520> will<00:01:41.670> get<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:41.850> job<00:01:42.030> done

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050
