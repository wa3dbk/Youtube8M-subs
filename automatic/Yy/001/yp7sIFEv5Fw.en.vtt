when I caught up with the class that was

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.200 
when I caught up with the class that was
my<00:00:34.500> age<00:00:34.710> they<00:00:35.070> were<00:00:35.219> learning<00:00:35.370> one<00:00:35.670> step<00:00:35.910> every

three<00:00:36.420> or<00:00:36.450> four<00:00:36.540> weeks<00:00:36.719> so<00:00:37.620> I<00:00:37.649> couldn't<00:00:38.010> go<00:00:38.190> at

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
three or four weeks so I couldn't go at

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.310 
three or four weeks so I couldn't go at
that<00:00:38.430> pace<00:00:38.730> anymore<00:00:39.420> I<00:00:39.450> was<00:00:39.719> used<00:00:40.079> to<00:00:40.200> going

that pace anymore I was used to going
faster<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.040> think<00:00:41.430> that<00:00:41.579> might<00:00:41.790> have<00:00:41.940> been<00:00:41.969> the

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
faster I think that might have been the

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.520 
faster I think that might have been the
best<00:00:42.329> thing<00:00:42.510> ever<00:00:42.660> happened<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.110> me<00:00:43.230> because<00:00:43.379> I

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
best thing ever happened to me because I

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.250 
best thing ever happened to me because I
began<00:00:43.860> creating<00:00:44.850> my<00:00:45.149> own<00:00:45.300> stuff<00:00:45.600> then<00:00:45.840> even

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
when I was very young and that's kind of

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.260
