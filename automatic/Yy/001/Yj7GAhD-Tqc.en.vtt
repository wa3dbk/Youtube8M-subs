00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460 
still loading but you can see it can

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.260 
still loading but you can see it can
still<00:03:00.140> use<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.380> web<00:03:01.590> browser<00:03:01.890> and<00:03:02.280> just<00:03:03.030> it's

a<00:03:03.450> very<00:03:03.690> nice<00:03:03.930> browser<00:03:07.100> and<00:03:08.100> of<00:03:08.220> course<00:03:08.490> the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:08.700 
a very nice browser and of course the

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.740 
a very nice browser and of course the
best<00:03:08.850> thing<00:03:09.210> is<00:03:09.450> going<00:03:10.050> into<00:03:10.290> your<00:03:10.410> settings<00:03:10.680> I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750
