00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
why right so like one of these goes up

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.219 
why right so like one of these goes up
to<00:01:11.460> the<00:01:11.520> second<00:01:11.909> line<00:01:12.090> two<00:01:12.330> teas<00:01:12.570> goes<00:01:12.840> up<00:01:13.049> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
to the second line two teas goes up to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.249 
to the second line two teas goes up to
the<00:01:13.320> double<00:01:13.650> line<00:01:13.830> so<00:01:14.760> I'll<00:01:15.150> do<00:01:15.299> two<00:01:15.659> teas<00:01:15.930> and

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
the double line so I'll do two teas and

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:21.789 
the double line so I'll do two teas and
all<00:01:16.830> you<00:01:16.979> have<00:01:17.100> to<00:01:17.159> do<00:01:18.049> is<00:01:19.049> fill<00:01:19.799> up<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.009> cups
