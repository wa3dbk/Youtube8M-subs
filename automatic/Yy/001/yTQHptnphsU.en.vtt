different side of the story either way I

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.970 
different side of the story either way I
find<00:03:22.819> that<00:03:23.000> this<00:03:23.480> is<00:03:23.540> definitely<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.500> great

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
find that this is definitely a great

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:28.089 
find that this is definitely a great
opportunity<00:03:25.609> to<00:03:25.790> share<00:03:26.060> and<00:03:26.389> basically<00:03:27.319> you

00:03:28.089 --> 00:03:28.099 
opportunity to share and basically you

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:30.129 
opportunity to share and basically you
know<00:03:28.130> inspire<00:03:28.880> each<00:03:29.060> other<00:03:29.239> and<00:03:29.720> help<00:03:29.989> each

other and support each other so now with
age<00:03:32.930> and<00:03:33.290> experience<00:03:33.680> I<00:03:34.099> actually<00:03:34.549> find<00:03:34.970> that

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:35.090 
age and experience I actually find that

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.229 
age and experience I actually find that
the<00:03:35.709> aftermath<00:03:36.709> of<00:03:36.920> acne<00:03:37.430> is<00:03:37.579> definitely<00:03:38.209> a

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
the aftermath of acne is definitely a

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.629 
the aftermath of acne is definitely a
lot<00:03:38.720> worse<00:03:38.959> than<00:03:39.139> actually<00:03:39.319> acne<00:03:39.980> itself<00:03:40.400> and

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:40.639 
lot worse than actually acne itself and

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:44.140 
lot worse than actually acne itself and
sometimes<00:03:41.599> a<00:03:42.370> lot<00:03:43.370> of<00:03:43.430> those<00:03:43.579> times<00:03:43.880> when<00:03:44.090> you

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
sometimes a lot of those times when you

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.970 
sometimes a lot of those times when you
go<00:03:44.239> to<00:03:44.299> the<00:03:44.480> salons<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.109> treatments<00:03:45.590> cost<00:03:45.799> a

go to the salons the treatments cost a

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.680 
go to the salons the treatments cost a
lot<00:03:46.220> more<00:03:46.280> and<00:03:46.849> I<00:03:46.970> find<00:03:47.209> that<00:03:47.269> with<00:03:47.480> this

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:47.690 
lot more and I find that with this

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:49.240 
lot more and I find that with this
banish'd<00:03:48.109> kit<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.500> can<00:03:48.680> actually<00:03:48.919> achieve

cover more ground using less time

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:45.510 
cover more ground using less time

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
because I was kind of scared that it was

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:47.520 
because I was kind of scared that it was
going<00:05:45.670> to<00:05:45.760> hurt<00:05:46.000> but<00:05:46.390> to<00:05:46.630> my<00:05:46.780> surprise<00:05:47.170> it<00:05:47.200> was

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:51.630 
not as painful as I had imagined maybe
it<00:05:50.050> is<00:05:50.140> also<00:05:50.320> because<00:05:50.740> I'm<00:05:50.920> quite<00:05:51.220> used<00:05:51.490> to

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640
