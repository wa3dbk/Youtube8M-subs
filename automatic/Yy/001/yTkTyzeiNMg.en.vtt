00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:12.169
 The Skyline gtt topic is ok too 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:13.490
 Two-liter in-line 4- cylinder station 9 minutes of the on - board supporters use the same thing 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:20.340
 It is that there 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:25.260
 In Mercedes-Benz in Japan, e-class and then c-class 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 It is the engine of the installed reader, but in the case of c class e class 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.990
 Though I become a Lean Vantaa 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:36.000
 Which means that I do not use the serine bar 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:37.320
 It is not a character that puts out a face on the engine price table that should be installed in the famous section 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.329
 Though 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:45.680
 It is Tosai to the current Sky members 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:48.920
 Like a sedan that does not seem to be that same child 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.320
 Sound Ranka is completely different 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:57.550
 Sometimes I can support the character 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:01.150
 What the car still better here with a sporty Naa that sense 

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:06.430
 I feel that I'm a car 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:11.920
 And the model so far combined the hybrid with Doi 6 engine 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:13.680
 Only have been line-up it Den occupation such as steer-by-wire to Come 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.460
 Quite 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:19.250
 When it comes to handling a car that is mounted 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.660
 Maa's 

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:29.150
 It's like off than are cutting is it is actually Doaba 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:30.170
 There is a sense or there is a part of that unnatural part, but of course the administrative expenses are high 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.320
 But also 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:39.240
 There was a part of attitude but this is it 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.590
 In the case of a 200 ctt, it is better because it is not used with spare- by-wire 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.670
 Natural 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:48.540
 Still above you doing riding the receiving you Papa' the ride ran taste 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:53.610
 As described in the bad explanation , European 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:58.140
 It's an East class. It's just such a c class or 3 series or an Audi a thing like that. 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:02:01.409
 It seems to be compared with the area and when it is tailored to the car 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.450
 I get the impression that lute c class or 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:09.490
 Compared to the 3 series, there is a quick feeling on the steering and the movement of the nose is quick 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.240
 You can get a feeling 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:18.370
 Well speaking of 2 liter turbo of active ace buy line 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:24.220
 It's not that kind of sports car that very high everyone is drowned 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:28.030
 To think but it is it today that it was a place called sports saloon 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:29.480
 There is a feeling that just call there were 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:34.319
 In this case 

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:39.810
 One point is that rock chains are made of Daimler. 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:40.950
 It is a part that I care about what kind of feeling I am honest, though this is still true 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:46.560
 is not it 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:50.400
 It is to feel such a thing c impression in a different seasoned and well diver 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:55.019
 It seems like it is firmly built in 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:56.730
 Even though we have to ride 200 gtt of the skyline in the So 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:03:02.920
 Major brands of 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:08.620
 Adoption of engine by collaboration Other than this , it has become a Skyline thing 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.450
 And it is in that sense in not a bargain you sounds pretty Given the price difference between the rivals 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:19.880
 I think it is a good model you want to try once by all means 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:22.690
 っ え 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.690
 Yeah 

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.080
 voodoo 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:04:04.069
