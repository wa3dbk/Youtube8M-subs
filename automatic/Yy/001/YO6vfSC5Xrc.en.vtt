bolt to what I'm going to call it so I

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.910 
bolt to what I'm going to call it so I
just<00:01:32.700> wrapped<00:01:32.970> it<00:01:33.240> in<00:01:33.390> some<00:01:35.000> teflon<00:01:36.000> tape<00:01:36.240> I

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
just wrapped it in some teflon tape I

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:39.770 
just wrapped it in some teflon tape I
figured<00:01:37.920> that<00:01:38.040> will<00:01:38.130> work<00:01:38.450> I'm<00:01:39.450> going<00:01:39.600> to<00:01:39.660> do

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
figured that will work I'm going to do

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.700 
figured that will work I'm going to do
is<00:01:40.610> stick<00:01:41.610> this<00:01:43.160> to<00:01:44.160> up<00:01:44.520> in<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:44.790> whole<00:01:45.710> pipe

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
is stick this to up in this whole pipe

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:52.499 
is stick this to up in this whole pipe
fit<00:01:47.040> in<00:01:47.160> there

00:01:52.499 --> 00:01:52.509

see<00:01:59.920> it<00:02:00.070> come<00:02:00.340> out<00:02:01.409> of<00:02:02.409> the<00:02:02.590> top<00:02:05.520> kind<00:02:06.520> of<00:02:06.579> do<00:02:06.729> it

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
see it come out of the top kind of do it

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.830 
see it come out of the top kind of do it
kind<00:02:07.000> of<00:02:07.090> slow<00:02:07.149> so<00:02:07.780> I<00:02:07.810> make<00:02:08.080> sure<00:02:08.110> I<00:02:08.349> get<00:02:09.209> all

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:26.040 

the<00:02:13.840> holes<00:02:14.140> filled<00:02:14.620> in

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:35.820 

here<00:02:27.360> to<00:02:28.360> get<00:02:28.750> another<00:02:30.450> here<00:02:31.450> it<00:02:31.570> is

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:39.390 

little<00:02:36.520> bit<00:02:36.640> pull<00:02:36.940> out<00:02:37.530> to<00:02:38.530> listen<00:02:38.890> bones<00:02:39.100> I

little bit pull out to listen bones I

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:48.759 
little bit pull out to listen bones I
see

00:02:48.759 --> 00:02:48.769 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:03:09.890 

now

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.069 

a<00:03:10.849> little<00:03:11.849> bit<00:03:11.970> we<00:03:12.150> top<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.599> bottom<00:03:12.780> of

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:13.079 
a little bit we top the bottom of

00:03:13.079 --> 00:03:36.120 
a little bit we top the bottom of
nothing<00:03:13.349> too<00:03:13.560> serious

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.130 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.390 

I<00:03:36.190> got<00:03:37.000> some<00:03:37.210> good<00:03:38.640> fresh<00:03:39.840> lube<00:03:40.840> oil<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.400> lower

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
I got some good fresh lube oil and lower

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:50.720 
I got some good fresh lube oil and lower
unit<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:42.940> this<00:03:43.060> old<00:03:43.330> mark<00:03:43.630> 60

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:50.730 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.070 

now<00:03:51.209> I've<00:03:51.390> got<00:03:51.599> some<00:03:51.840> good<00:03:53.300> lower<00:03:54.300> unit<00:03:54.780> gear

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
now I've got some good lower unit gear

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:59.809 
now I've got some good lower unit gear
lube<00:03:56.120> and<00:03:57.120> the<00:03:57.959> bottom<00:03:58.290> of<00:03:58.440> my<00:03:58.470> are<00:03:59.370> down<00:03:59.610> in<00:03:59.730> my

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
lube and the bottom of my are down in my

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:03.040 
lube and the bottom of my are down in my
lower<00:04:00.000> unit<00:04:00.390> so<00:04:01.380> this<00:04:01.530> thing<00:04:01.739> ought<00:04:01.920> to<00:04:02.040> be

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.050 
lower unit so this thing ought to be

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.200 
lower unit so this thing ought to be
happy<00:04:04.050> now
