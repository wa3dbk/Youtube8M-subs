00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.200
 and it's abraham 

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:15.929
 we will continue our double sense of 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.779
 theory with reassure yourself not too much 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.060
 blah, but just enough for you for you 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.130
 fend off as big the idea at 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.200
 place to learn a whole blah 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.829
 gnangnan to the possible is to take 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:30.540
 a song little or very well known for 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.829
 learn the position of the notes on the 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.809
 sleeve in any case for the first 

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:35.460
 rope for this video is for the 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:39.390
 second rope on the next video 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.129
 so that's the intro of the black keys on 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:46.469
 their latest album data she a 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:52.109
 cute so he says it's on this little 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:54.079
 group of that you manage to find 

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.690
 what notes are played there 

00:00:54.079 --> 00:01:00.079
 so on the rosas of the notes that are 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.460
 found on the first theoretical lesson 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.100
 that circle that I'm going to display 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.830
 here since we will enjoy having a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.050
 big blank space that is useless for 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.810
 find the notes we will play so the 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.370
 first bass string is the half string 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:18.760
 so this is the note 

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.260
 she even following this is this freight to the 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:24.880
 third freight on the rope 2000 serious 

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:26.890
 so to find which nation is going 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.830
 simply from the silene that is the 

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:32.940
 ours open we will go up a half tone 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:37.090
 a cargo of half tones of freight 

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:40.060
 3/2 ton 3 freight so if you take your rose 

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.970
 have you gone from the mount you mount the 3 half 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.380
 your you will arrive a single arrow and we 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.930
 do like that so on 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.400
 the second note so face to make even 

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.290
 leroux de gros live a little like that 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:03.940
 on my fear I am very structured 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:07.060
 as a guy, so that's the note 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.580
 next is this note there at the 12th 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:13.150
 freight at the 12th freight 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:18.760
 it is always always the case 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:21.700
 it means a complete cycle of the small 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:26.640
 round of the shot that means if 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.260
 swayed I have a migrant at the 12th freight 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.680
 jamie serious too but he is no longer very 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.470
 serious 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.410
 so it's a normal mini so cermis 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:39.880
 normal one octave higher so a 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:41.080
 octave it's simple explains and it's 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.590
 with words it's impossible finally 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:49.410
 short so if you want to do this group you 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:54.730
 go play me mit mit him alone 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.040
 mimi mi mai and here I am it is also 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.370
 simple that I advise you to 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:04.420
 proposes two concerts of offers of 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:06.910
 play a round one play a note by 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.110
 example if I will not do the 7th freight the 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.430
 half rope 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.930
 but to try to guess which notes 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.020
 it's the goal is that you get used 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.790
 little by little memorize his boxes by 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.770
 example on the benchmarks that you have on your 

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.260
 guitar know that the first landmark 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.280
 it's only the second there the third 6 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.540
 and the fourth of sharp I see you 

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.640
 you approach nicely perfection 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.200
 then again something that can 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:33.040
 to be useful for you actually when you 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.040
 make strikethrough 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:40.040
 it's the note that's on the way the fret 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.410
 that yesterday top of your index that will count 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:48.020
 ie if I bar on a base 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:49.700
 half the name of the Basel agreement and will be 

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:50.930
 okay only if I would do you have the 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.670
 third time 

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.700
 so that's where it is at 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:57.349
 top of your index that note of 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.090
 the agreement is going to be defined that means that 

00:03:57.349 --> 00:04:01.370
 if he wants to make an agreement of the bar and 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:05.420
 I will come to that week my index 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:08.370
 on the 5th freight of the agreement half gram 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:10.390
 what will give me a there 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.550
 here I hope it's a little bit and 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.720
 clear lighted it's the same thing with 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.140
 the power cord 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:19.390
 it's the top of the index so let 

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:21.880
 not well the vertices of the index that is going 

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.820
 determine the note of the agreement the 

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:26.590
 height of the agreement here I leave you 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:28.600
 there the next video is also the 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.120
 theory but it's on the rope of the 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.830
 with the barea base of faith 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:35.110
 Come on we'll be on my next 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.310
