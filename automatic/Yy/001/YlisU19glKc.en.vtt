00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.720
 Y 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.609
 to the welcome to solos 92 today I'm going 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:24.360
 to teach a new pop guide and this 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:26.830
 character is a character the body to 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.570
 body that uses p 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:31.689
 he already shows me a little more or less his 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.120
 passive skills and how I use it 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:36.300
 with objects the masters and the 

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.300
 runes 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.600
 good your passive the brave fighter 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.430
 any damage caused to little and that 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.129
 exceed 10% of your current life is 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.840
 reduces 50% the damage is not reduced 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:50.540
 caused by the structures say by 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.430
 the turrets this then is to say that 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.260
 It is a character that resists very well 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.649
 hits 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:00.350
 the devastating blow its own crushed to 

00:00:57.649 --> 00:01:03.260
 his opponent causing attack damage plus the 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.239
 ability power you have more 61 8% 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.909
 of maximum life and your goal as 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:11.480
 magic damage the additional damage inflicted 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:15.980
 can not exceed 225 this limit 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.450
 you ascend the night according to the character 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:22.880
 secretly 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:26.600
 actually since it makes the skull 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:29.329
 is w the demand model is a shield 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.920
 so the passive is that when hit 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:32.990
 to attack an enemy the damage and the 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.570
 Stern armor and increase by 15 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.700
 for 5 seconds this effect can be 

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.939
 accumulate 10 times that is to say that for each 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.010
 beat that they give you and for every attitude is 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:48.120
 hard way goes up the passive 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:51.070
 is that the active 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.530
 then more of le mans model 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.260
 and the movement speed increases in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:00.520
 17% for 5 is to say that if you 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:02.770
 active the the w makes it go faster 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:08.700
 in this good skill for both 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:08.700
 escape to kill enemies 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.910
 his so-called heroic charge in the stern and 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.070
 charges an enemy and displaces it to 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.940
 a short distance the initial impact 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:22.730
 inflicts 50 plus point of ap you have 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:25.680
 tenths of skill power that you have 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.470
 said with the land your goal receives 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.980
 75 plus the power of skill you have 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:35.270
 and the astures for 15 seconds 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.270
 stability is very good for 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:39.500
 and try to take an active friend and 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.260
 your turret for the turret to help you 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.750

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.720
 the ability are his last and immunity 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.100
 diplomatic that for six seconds 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.540
 pop and is immune to damage and 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.130
 skills of other enemies that do not 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:55.730
 they are runner-up in the same goal is 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:58.370
 say that pop and fixed output comes out as 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.560
 a signal to the enemy champion who wants 

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.890
 is to destroy you use against being 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.890
 champion 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.640
 the other champions 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:22.350
 for boys invoker llosa tips 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.660
 I'm undertaking, although you can remove the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:28.530
 flash skill by ghost what 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:31.010
 teleport as gustavo is what 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:31.010
 My advice is 

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:39.299
 good of objects I advise you 

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:41.129
 buy some boots and three possible that 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:42.659
 always start like this and depending on 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.640
 situation you can choose is good and 

00:03:42.659 --> 00:03:48.420
 no mercury droplets depending on 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:52.079
 what you need and if not a drop 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:54.290
 of sorcerer to be able to attack more with 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:58.340
 the cv 

00:03:54.290 --> 00:04:04.010
 and then let you buy the object of 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:07.879
 brightness and fervor and then a scepter 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.790
 amplified and try to get the 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:14.739
 trinity 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:18.600
 then you can underline the vampiric scepter 

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:22.060
 the bloodthirsty and get the object of 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.830
 teeth of greater than gives speed of 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:26.660
 attack 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:29.570
 and ability power 

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:32.300
 you can also get to get 

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.830
 more lives or armor you can choose the 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:35.800
 armor of a warm or that is achieved 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:38.800
 a lot of life 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.870
 and kill domains get more or the 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.590
 Graduate weighing that gives you armor and 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:48.580
 cooling review and finally the 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.590
 center of rule and that ability to be able 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.590
 of skill 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:56.950
 and slows down to 35 the objectives 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:05:01.150
 close which is a very good object 

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.190
 to be able to attack and with your ours 

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:05.010
 shield increase is your speed of 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.330
 move and you can load them 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.340
 quickly this object is also what 

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:13.390
 You can change if you want for more 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:15.610
 veiled that also gives life and slows down and 

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:17.319
 it also gives you attack 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:21.039
 now let's go for the skills of 

00:05:17.319 --> 00:05:24.400
 little at level 1 a point at the qa level 

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:27.400
 2 1 point at level 3 another point in the cv 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:29.889
 and at level 4 1 point in w 

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.639
 and then we 're always going to prioritize the 

00:05:29.889 --> 00:05:37.270
 q and the r in levels 6 11 16 

00:05:33.639 --> 00:05:40.560
 then maximum we will climb to the maximum 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.560
 and finally to the w 

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:46.810
 a pop and pop stops and 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.240
 we will buy magic penetration marks 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:52.090
 cooling reduction glyphs or 

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:55.680
 magic resistance of armor seals and 

00:05:52.090 --> 00:05:55.680
 Essence power ability kit 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:02.919
 well now we go with the masters of 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:04.960
 pop and I always use 21 an attack and 9 in 

00:06:02.919 --> 00:06:07.090
 utility and left an image so that 

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.770
 you see more or less the order in which they are 

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:11.650
 put 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.110
 now I leave you more or less on some 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:17.949
 fights I did with pop and against pop 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.750
 because he was practicing and well that's 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:23.000
 everything and I only ask that 

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:26.390
