during nighttime and this is because

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.899 
during nighttime and this is because
their<00:01:31.170> pollinators<00:01:31.439> are<00:01:31.799> not<00:01:32.220> active<00:01:32.729> during

specific<00:01:49.350> pollinator<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:50.820> this<00:01:51.180> orchid

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
specific pollinator that this orchid

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:54.080 
specific pollinator that this orchid
wants<00:01:52.380> to<00:01:52.530> attract<00:01:52.890> now<00:01:53.280> this<00:01:53.549> feature<00:01:53.759> has

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 
wants to attract now this feature has

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:55.760 
wants to attract now this feature has
actually<00:01:54.509> evolved<00:01:54.899> through<00:01:55.110> millions<00:01:55.590> and

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
actually evolved through millions and

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.429 
actually evolved through millions and
millions<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.250> years<00:01:56.460> imagine<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.630> plant<00:01:57.990> had

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
millions of years imagine this plant had

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.399 
millions of years imagine this plant had
to<00:01:58.740> figure<00:01:59.100> out<00:01:59.219> that<00:02:00.119> a<00:02:00.149> specific<00:02:00.450> pollinator

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
to figure out that a specific pollinator

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.920 
to figure out that a specific pollinator
is<00:02:01.649> what<00:02:02.189> she<00:02:02.460> actually<00:02:02.610> needs<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.450> that

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
is what she actually needs and that

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.020 
is what she actually needs and that
specific<00:02:04.380> pollinator<00:02:04.829> likes<00:02:05.159> a<00:02:05.340> certain<00:02:05.579> type

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
specific pollinator likes a certain type

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.139 
specific pollinator likes a certain type
of<00:02:06.060> smell<00:02:06.570> and<00:02:06.810> that<00:02:07.520> pollinator<00:02:08.520> only<00:02:09.060> is

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of smell and that pollinator only is

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.029 
of smell and that pollinator only is
active<00:02:09.539> in<00:02:09.690> a<00:02:09.780> part<00:02:10.140> of<00:02:10.349> the<00:02:10.470> day<00:02:10.619> or<00:02:10.770> of<00:02:10.800> the

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
active in a part of the day or of the

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.380 
active in a part of the day or of the
night<00:02:11.190> so<00:02:11.640> think<00:02:12.450> about<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.930> or<00:02:13.110> can

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
night so think about it or can

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.500 
night so think about it or can
are<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:14.110> so<00:02:14.470> smart<00:02:14.800> to<00:02:15.100> actually<00:02:15.480> manage<00:02:16.480> to

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
are so so smart to actually manage to

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.570 
are so so smart to actually manage to
depth<00:02:16.930> themselves<00:02:17.590> and<00:02:17.770> this<00:02:18.069> is<00:02:18.220> why<00:02:18.340> they're

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
depth themselves and this is why they're

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.270 
depth themselves and this is why they're
one<00:02:18.790> of<00:02:18.819> the<00:02:19.030> oldest<00:02:19.420> group<00:02:19.810> of<00:02:20.280> flowering

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
one of the oldest group of flowering

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:23.070 
one of the oldest group of flowering
plants<00:02:21.850> there<00:02:22.030> are<00:02:22.060> on<00:02:22.330> earth<00:02:22.360> and<00:02:22.930> they

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:23.080 
plants there are on earth and they

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.870 
plants there are on earth and they
actually<00:02:23.230> didn't<00:02:23.680> change<00:02:23.709> that<00:02:24.190> much<00:02:24.400> ever

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
actually didn't change that much ever

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.170 
actually didn't change that much ever
since<00:02:25.000> they<00:02:25.390> reached<00:02:25.870> this<00:02:26.230> stage<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.880> this<00:02:28.060> is

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
since they reached this stage so this is

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:29.760 
since they reached this stage so this is
one<00:02:28.360> example<00:02:28.480> of<00:02:28.930> an<00:02:29.080> orchid<00:02:29.440> that<00:02:29.560> only

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:29.770 
one example of an orchid that only

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:32.190 
one example of an orchid that only
releases<00:02:30.370> fragrance<00:02:30.820> during<00:02:31.330> nighttime<00:02:31.900> and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.200 
releases fragrance during nighttime and

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.800 
releases fragrance during nighttime and
if<00:02:32.560> we<00:02:32.680> think<00:02:32.920> about<00:02:33.250> its<00:02:33.459> environment<00:02:33.820> it's

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:34.810 
if we think about its environment it's

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.400 
if we think about its environment it's
really<00:02:35.530> so<00:02:35.770> logical<00:02:36.520> to<00:02:37.300> figure<00:02:37.540> out<00:02:37.690> why<00:02:38.080> she

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
really so logical to figure out why she

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.229 
really so logical to figure out why she
smells<00:02:38.770> the<00:02:38.920> way<00:02:39.100> she<00:02:39.310> smells<00:02:39.580> why<00:02:39.910> it's<00:02:40.060> so

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
smells the way she smells why it's so

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:42.720 
smells the way she smells why it's so
powerful<00:02:40.570> why<00:02:41.410> she<00:02:41.650> has<00:02:41.830> this<00:02:41.980> color<00:02:42.250> and<00:02:42.520> so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
powerful why she has this color and so

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:45.150 
powerful why she has this color and so
on<00:02:42.760> so<00:02:43.300> imagine<00:02:43.900> the<00:02:44.020> moths<00:02:44.290> this<00:02:44.680> orchid<00:02:45.040> is

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:45.160 
on so imagine the moths this orchid is

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.030 
on so imagine the moths this orchid is
looking<00:02:45.640> for<00:02:45.850> is<00:02:46.120> a<00:02:46.420> night<00:02:46.780> moth's<00:02:47.170> as<00:02:47.470> you<00:02:47.920> may

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
looking for is a night moth's as you may

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.640 
looking for is a night moth's as you may
guess<00:02:48.310> it's<00:02:48.640> pretty<00:02:48.850> colorblind<00:02:49.600> this<00:02:50.320> is<00:02:50.530> why

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
guess it's pretty colorblind this is why

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.280 
guess it's pretty colorblind this is why
this<00:02:50.860> orchid<00:02:51.220> is<00:02:51.400> very<00:02:52.150> light<00:02:52.480> in<00:02:52.690> color<00:02:52.720> as

this orchid is very light in color as
you<00:02:53.620> can<00:02:53.769> see<00:02:53.920> it's<00:02:54.040> white<00:02:54.489> is<00:02:54.790> yellowish

exaggerating<00:03:23.760> 10:15<00:03:24.760> now<00:03:25.209> 10<00:03:25.690> meters<00:03:26.079> away

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
exaggerating 10:15 now 10 meters away

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:28.710 
exaggerating 10:15 now 10 meters away
and<00:03:26.769> the<00:03:27.280> actual<00:03:27.549> two<00:03:27.820> balconies<00:03:28.060> are<00:03:28.450> not

and the actual two balconies are not

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.870 
and the actual two balconies are not
connected<00:03:29.320> so<00:03:29.500> the<00:03:30.010> smell<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.280> this<00:03:30.519> orchid

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:37.989 
window of my balcony this is why I'm

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:40.740 
window of my balcony this is why I'm
saying<00:03:38.290> that<00:03:38.880> fragrances<00:03:39.880> actually<00:03:40.360> help

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
saying that fragrances actually help

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.100 
saying that fragrances actually help
orchids<00:03:41.350> entice<00:03:42.360> button<00:03:43.360> butterflies<00:03:43.870> and

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
orchids entice button butterflies and

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.280 
orchids entice button butterflies and
moths<00:03:44.260> from<00:03:44.590> very<00:03:44.980> very<00:03:45.100> far<00:03:45.370> away<00:03:45.640> so<00:03:46.630> this<00:03:47.049> is

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 
moths from very very far away so this is

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:03.660 
think that there are just a few moths
that<00:04:02.350> are<00:04:02.590> actually<00:04:02.920> active<00:04:03.370> during

that are actually active during

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:06.360 
that are actually active during
nighttime<00:04:04.120> so<00:04:04.780> she's<00:04:05.079> only<00:04:05.380> looking<00:04:06.160> for<00:04:06.190> a

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
nighttime so she's only looking for a

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:08.610 
nighttime so she's only looking for a
specific<00:04:07.150> type<00:04:07.420> of<00:04:07.450> moth<00:04:07.959> that<00:04:08.260> can

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:08.620 
specific type of moth that can

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.610 
specific type of moth that can
pollinated<00:04:09.190> during<00:04:09.489> nighttime<00:04:09.940> because<00:04:10.840> if

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
pollinated during nighttime because if

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.979 
pollinated during nighttime because if
any<00:04:12.130> type<00:04:12.400> of<00:04:12.549> mass<00:04:12.760> could<00:04:13.269> pollinate<00:04:13.780> this

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
any type of mass could pollinate this

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.930 
any type of mass could pollinate this
orchid<00:04:14.350> she<00:04:14.530> might<00:04:14.680> get<00:04:14.859> the<00:04:15.010> pollen<00:04:15.340> from<00:04:15.489> a

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:15.940 
orchid she might get the pollen from a

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:17.849 
orchid she might get the pollen from a
different<00:04:16.329> species<00:04:16.600> of<00:04:16.810> orchid<00:04:17.350> and<00:04:17.500> the

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
different species of orchid and the

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.190 
different species of orchid and the
seeds<00:04:18.130> would<00:04:18.340> not<00:04:18.549> develop<00:04:18.850> so<00:04:19.450> I<00:04:19.479> think<00:04:19.750> this

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
seeds would not develop so I think this

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.469 
seeds would not develop so I think this
orchid<00:04:20.560> is<00:04:20.709> the<00:04:20.890> perfect<00:04:21.459> example<00:04:22.000> of<00:04:22.120> how

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:22.479 
orchid is the perfect example of how

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:25.730 
orchid is the perfect example of how
well<00:04:23.020> they<00:04:23.200> can<00:04:23.260> adapt<00:04:23.770> to<00:04:23.979> their<00:04:24.250> environment

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:25.740 
well they can adapt to their environment

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:28.219 
well they can adapt to their environment
and<00:04:25.919> yeah<00:04:26.669> basically<00:04:26.910> how<00:04:27.360> smart<00:04:27.900> these

00:04:28.219 --> 00:04:28.229 
and yeah basically how smart these

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:47.550 
actually plays an important role in

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:50.300 
actually plays an important role in
releasing<00:05:48.060> fragrance<00:05:48.719> also<00:05:49.409> there<00:05:49.889> are<00:05:50.009> times

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
releasing fragrance also there are times

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.790 
releasing fragrance also there are times
when<00:05:50.639> you<00:05:51.300> see<00:05:51.539> an<00:05:51.659> orchid<00:05:52.080> you<00:05:52.110> smell<00:05:52.560> it<00:05:52.710> at

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:52.800 
when you see an orchid you smell it at

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.439 
when you see an orchid you smell it at
the<00:05:52.949> story<00:05:53.190> it<00:05:53.280> smells<00:05:53.520> wonderful<00:05:53.969> and<00:05:54.060> then

00:05:54.439 --> 00:05:54.449 
the story it smells wonderful and then

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:56.180 
the story it smells wonderful and then
you<00:05:54.479> bring<00:05:54.780> it<00:05:54.930> home<00:05:55.110> and<00:05:55.380> for<00:05:55.590> a<00:05:55.620> few<00:05:55.800> days<00:05:55.979> it

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
you bring it home and for a few days it

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.279 
you bring it home and for a few days it
will<00:05:56.280> not<00:05:56.580> smell<00:05:57.090> that's<00:05:57.719> pretty<00:05:58.080> normal

00:05:58.279 --> 00:05:58.289 
will not smell that's pretty normal

00:05:58.289 --> 00:05:59.899 
will not smell that's pretty normal
because<00:05:58.770> the<00:05:58.800> orchid<00:05:59.159> is<00:05:59.280> adapting<00:05:59.759> to<00:05:59.880> your

00:05:59.899 --> 00:05:59.909 
because the orchid is adapting to your

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:01.999 
because the orchid is adapting to your
environment<00:06:00.060> and<00:06:00.840> it's<00:06:00.990> not<00:06:01.229> really<00:06:01.560> focused

00:06:01.999 --> 00:06:02.009 
environment and it's not really focused

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.879 
environment and it's not really focused
on<00:06:02.159> releasing<00:06:02.400> fragrance<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.419> entice

00:06:03.879 --> 00:06:03.889 
on releasing fragrance to entice

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:06.279 
on releasing fragrance to entice
pollinators<00:06:04.889> but<00:06:05.159> it's<00:06:05.280> more<00:06:05.400> focused<00:06:05.699> on

00:06:06.279 --> 00:06:06.289 
pollinators but it's more focused on

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:09.170 
pollinators but it's more focused on
adjusting<00:06:07.289> to<00:06:07.469> the<00:06:07.590> environment<00:06:08.159> after<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.849> few

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:09.180 
adjusting to the environment after a few

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.149 
adjusting to the environment after a few
days<00:06:09.419> your<00:06:09.659> orchid<00:06:10.050> might<00:06:10.289> start<00:06:10.680> to<00:06:10.860> smell

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:11.159 
days your orchid might start to smell

00:06:11.159 --> 00:06:14.240 
days your orchid might start to smell
again<00:06:11.490> so<00:06:11.849> don't<00:06:12.210> worry<00:06:12.389> about<00:06:12.599> it<00:06:12.960> of<00:06:13.889> course

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
again so don't worry about it of course

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:16.430 
again so don't worry about it of course
