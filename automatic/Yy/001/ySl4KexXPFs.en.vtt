a<00:00:14.820> three<00:00:15.630> element<00:00:16.160> yogi<00:00:17.160> for<00:00:17.580> 20<00:00:17.910> meter<00:00:18.060> band

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
a three element yogi for 20 meter band

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:27.040 
a three element yogi for 20 meter band
and<00:00:20.930> here<00:00:21.930> it<00:00:22.109> is<00:00:23.600> as<00:00:24.600> you<00:00:24.990> can<00:00:25.019> see

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:45.860 
because my wsr is under the 1.2 so quite

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:46.420 
because my wsr is under the 1.2 so quite
good

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:46.430 
good

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:50.790

I have a bottle up there
one<00:00:53.320> one<00:00:54.320> one<00:00:54.350> volume<00:00:55.129> sorry<00:00:55.790> I<00:00:55.909> don't<00:00:56.000> know

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:56.089 
one one one volume sorry I don't know

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:59.939 
one one one volume sorry I don't know
how<00:00:56.269> can<00:00:56.510> say<00:00:56.750> correctly<00:00:57.909> but<00:00:58.909> then<00:00:59.090> actually

how can say correctly but then actually

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:04.210 
how can say correctly but then actually
at<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.070> moment<00:01:01.489> it<00:01:01.640> hasn't<00:01:02.149> got<00:01:02.269> any<00:01:03.220> antenna

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:04.220 
at the moment it hasn't got any antenna

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.400 
at the moment it hasn't got any antenna
rotator<00:01:04.990> or<00:01:05.990> something<00:01:06.920> like<00:01:07.009> that<00:01:07.070> to<00:01:08.410> turn

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:09.410 
rotator or something like that to turn

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:14.889 
rotator or something like that to turn
the<00:01:09.679> antenna<00:01:10.100> but<00:01:12.039> on<00:01:13.039> that<00:01:13.729> end<00:01:14.090> of<00:01:14.720> the

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:14.899 
the antenna but on that end of the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:18.010 
the antenna but on that end of the
antenna<00:01:15.410> you<00:01:15.649> can<00:01:16.369> see<00:01:16.670> it's<00:01:16.970> more<00:01:17.270> wire<00:01:17.539> I'll

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:18.020 
antenna you can see it's more wire I'll

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.020 
antenna you can see it's more wire I'll
show<00:01:18.440> later<00:01:18.470> and<00:01:20.140> that<00:01:21.140> one<00:01:21.320> is<00:01:21.440> fixed<00:01:21.740> on<00:01:22.100> the

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.030 
show later and that one is fixed on the

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.969 
show later and that one is fixed on the
ground<00:01:23.800> fix<00:01:24.800> it<00:01:24.950> on<00:01:25.069> the<00:01:25.159> ground<00:01:26.470> if<00:01:27.470> I<00:01:27.649> pick<00:01:27.890> it

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:27.979 
ground fix it on the ground if I pick it

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:32.730 
ground fix it on the ground if I pick it
up<00:01:28.039> that<00:01:28.460> has<00:01:28.909> good<00:01:29.479> from<00:01:30.080> the<00:01:30.460> ground<00:01:31.460> I<00:01:31.850> can

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
up that has good from the ground I can

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.240 
up that has good from the ground I can
move<00:01:33.740> around<00:01:33.950> and<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.960> antennas<00:01:36.500> were

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
move around and the antennas were

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.080 
move around and the antennas were
turning<00:01:38.500> so<00:01:39.500> I<00:01:40.060> I<00:01:41.060> and<00:01:41.509> my<00:01:41.630> friend<00:01:42.880> Hotel<00:01:43.880> Golf

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
had up there a half wave gaap antenna

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:21.530 
had up there a half wave gaap antenna
for<00:03:15.450> 11<00:03:15.810> meter<00:03:15.989> band<00:03:17.900> pick<00:03:18.900> it<00:03:19.019> up<00:03:19.170> off<00:03:20.540> from

for 11 meter band pick it up off from

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.250 
for 11 meter band pick it up off from
there<00:03:21.750> and<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:22.799> will<00:03:23.269> what<00:03:24.269> actually<00:03:24.630> I<00:03:24.840> can't

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 
put it back the the half wave antenna

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.250 
put it back the the half wave antenna
for<00:03:29.400> level<00:03:29.730> meter<00:03:29.910> bad<00:03:30.209> because<00:03:30.480> I<00:03:30.660> don't<00:03:31.049> have

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
for level meter bad because I don't have

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:36.380 
for level meter bad because I don't have
a<00:03:31.290> space<00:03:31.769> for<00:03:32.010> that<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:34.160> yeah<00:03:35.160> so<00:03:35.400> I<00:03:35.790> need<00:03:36.269> to
