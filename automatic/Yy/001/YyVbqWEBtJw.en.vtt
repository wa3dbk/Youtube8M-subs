00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:13.679
 weird little because I want precisely 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:17.299
 in fact he is my boyfriend like this 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.299
 my colleague with the companion 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.180
 accompanied too 

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:25.220
 he uses bills when tastes 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.830
 sexual 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.330
 let's do straight and berceto I want to talk to you 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.769
 from him he wants to talk about it saying something 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.329
 important enough that he keeps on 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.329
 enough and many recommend 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.460
 listen to it well now larrivey many 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.230
 many things leave you know how long 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.480
 but I am therefore important at the time 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.950
 open your ears well or have done 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.660
 headphone volume or someone's 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.350
 crate what's there so now I'll do it 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.719
 I will stand aside 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.640
 enter a corner to look at him 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:55.260
 will talk alone for bitter then with 

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.820
 the first time camera the first time 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.670
 it was actually the one with the lech of 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:01.260
 paste for on air in video that I was not in 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.239
 video the iron numbers proceeds by 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.260

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.750
 heard 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.450
 take note of what he says I will speak 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.850

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:04.450
 we also agree and understand 

00:03:01.389 --> 00:03:06.160
 how to do with various events in events 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.440
 also a particular festival so there 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.180
 are other other bands besides us 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.160
 we are the first I played around 9 a 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.200
 jolanda e 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:18.100
 really cool other three other bands I have 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:20.530
 already heard are good and nothing come 

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:22.450
 I hear you guys 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.670
 in the bank link you can fine too 

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.010
 buy the album if you want to hear it 

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:30.490
 offline and it would really be one thing 

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:32.410
 pretty of themes especially if you like it 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:35.070
 I really care about the song 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:38.530
 so much of this group what I do 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:40.180
 something from the important point I have 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:42.180
 played the synthesizer 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.770
 gentlemen ladies is an experience 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:48.310
 particular transcendental mysticism mi 

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:50.710
 I am put to play the keyboard boys 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:54.520
 so i do synthesizer with a 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:56.560
 my other friend artyom and then he burns 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:58.540
 a singer is a very thing 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.400
 in particular the singer has one 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:03.340
 very particular style of voice then 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:06.520
 it is not typically the usual gods 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.440
 electronic groups and stuff like that 

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:11.560
 and then we have the live battery that 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:15.970
 that figure is splitting the battery from the 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:19.090
 alive is that the song you are hearing 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:20.770
 it's called grows and let's say the song 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.260
 which sums up almost all the style 

00:04:20.770 --> 00:04:25.510
 of this last album we did 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:28.510
 in a while we also make another one 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.760
 what else is another and I assume it is 

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:32.970
 with even a song that I wrote 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:35.440
 me too with the other boys 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.990
 we will rework some songs we have 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:41.169
 fact that they did in their 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:43.990
 very first ep and a cool thing 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:45.730

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:47.830
