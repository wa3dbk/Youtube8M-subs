00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:07.830
 hello I 'm simon had to do it in 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.260
 this video is about the generator 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.030
 from my point of view one of the top 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:14.700
 weight gainer when it comes to lean 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.780
 building muscle mass is because they have 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.029
 Of course , in recent times 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.410
 relatively controversial call to get there 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.150
 I also admit quite openly and honestly 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.130
 It's a lot of crap on the market so it 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.449
 There is also this very simple weight 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.039
 gainer you can weight on everything 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.539
 gainer court actually write 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.070
 A good product is actually 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.449
 no statement about it 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.610
 You can do a very simple method 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.320
 extreme mixture with the worst 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.700
 protein together mixed serious weight 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.530
 Gainer does not have a problem 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.910
 this is something completely different 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.070
 from the composition here it is 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.320
 much more and I think so too 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.300
 Success of muscle mass on dry 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.710
 muscle mass on where much better 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.360
 That is exactly what you need 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.170
 do not want to hunger hook on msg 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.610
 never get fat 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:52.050
 that's what it's all about in here, too 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.570
 we throw one of the composition 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:55.920
 look at it we have 70 percent 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.510
 carbohydrates since these carbohydrates 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.160
 are natural for the muscle mass 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.539
 where very important but it is also 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.420
 the question what carbohydrates are 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.150
 shared the extreme ice strength and 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.430
 The soma scoreless loose mattress this one 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:09.930
 solution of glucose and fructose the 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.369
 Of course, whole makes sense of the battery pack 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.080
 matrix to take 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:15.030
 this is this so called the flomo pro 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.220
 matrix what was the insulin level 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.570
 not such an extreme emissions 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.310
 but rather causes the whole thing 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.140
 keeps constant over the long term 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.970
 I realize that too, one of them 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:25.680
 have some saturation has that under 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.810
 other things to do with the egg whites 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.880
 namely 21 percent is here 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.710
 Protein product in it consists of with 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:33.930
 selam casein from whey protein 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.360
 concentrate so vey proteins and viruses 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.400
 whey protein isolate and even the hydro 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:41.759
 whey protein was still using it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.619
 protein supplements result at matrix also 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.780
 also present different proteins 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:47.909
 In any case, keep the protein 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:50.100
 Mixing is also possible in the long term 

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:51.600
 seen a very good thing so what 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.310
 it is worth mentioning in any case 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.439
 Here is the addition of the bca in the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.469
 ratio two to one to one and of 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:00.180
 l glutamine 12 each on the 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.130
 total amount as of course in the 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.560
 protein already contains glutamine 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.570
 And it is also on a total of pcs 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.560
 a relatively strong balance sheet just what 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.420
 these important ones 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.069
 it's all now look at this here 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.590
 again something in any case in the 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.239
 eye it falls fatty one percent mct 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.680
 This is especially important if 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.120
 it's just that you just do not 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.709
 so builds up in this area but 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.970
 rather in this area that are 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.590
 Of course, that's what I do 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 I can definitely recommend experience in any case 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:25.470
 I am friend of these mct fatty acids 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.280
 agile is a bit at laws 

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.760
 I think that's good 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.980
 we still have 0.7 percent 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.970
 buffered the creative advice and the 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.760
 Of course you have to ask yourself 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.560
 0.7 percent that is extremely little 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.510
 why so what makes this checked 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.760
 had creative wire is ultimately 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:43.560
 this screen that you know it is too 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.239
 here this original create what 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.250
 has included if you are here now 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:50.190
 the total amount you look at the day 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.709
 can take 160 grams 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:55.019
 on two portions so 80 grams and 80 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:57.209
 g then you have to 160 grams of course 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:58.049
 already appropriate amount of creative 

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:00.030
 which one takes up 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.470
 which is enough then because I but the 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.750
 view is you do not need it 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.120
 160 you can day but twice 50 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:07.709
 program quite completely, at least for 

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 all those who are not on everyone now 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.880
 case extremely redeem the mass structure 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.120
 but basically no problem 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.920
 can with the construction of massive 250 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.359
 Gram in any case from there you should 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.410
 then a little bit of creatine 

00:03:18.359 --> 00:03:21.780
 or 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:23.250
 andrea karin extra take that is 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.810
 just useful because otherwise the amount 

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.250
 here is not enough in any case 

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.660
 one of the top products for me 

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.489
 Personally in any case I have no 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:31.709
 problem with the mass structure is quite 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.260
 makes sense not just in the hip area 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.670
 falls apart but in the muscle 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.739
 area to really build muscle mass 

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:39.810
 and for that the composition of the very 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.310
 advantageous the generator gets from me 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.750
 In any case, a very good conclusion 

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.090
 of course here by marius butz 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.709
 Janowski one of the top recommendations we 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:49.730
 see you in the next video many greetings 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:49.730
 your sorrow
