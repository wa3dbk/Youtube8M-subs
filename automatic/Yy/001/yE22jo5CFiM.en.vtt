00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:54.110 

the<00:03:51.570> cushions<00:03:52.200> aren't<00:03:53.070> into<00:03:53.310> good<00:03:53.519> shape<00:03:53.820> and

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
the cushions aren't into good shape and

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.680 
the cushions aren't into good shape and
I<00:03:54.239> don't<00:03:54.269> think<00:03:54.480> they're<00:03:54.780> original<00:03:56.510> so<00:03:57.510> we're

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:57.690 
I don't think they're original so we're

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:58.780 
I don't think they're original so we're
going<00:03:57.780> to<00:03:57.840> have<00:03:57.989> to<00:03:58.170> do<00:03:58.290> something<00:03:58.650> about

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
going to have to do something about

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.440 
going to have to do something about
cushions<00:03:59.790> embedding<00:04:00.330> this<00:04:01.230> top<00:04:02.390> there's<00:04:03.390> a

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
cushions embedding this top there's a

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:05.720 
cushions embedding this top there's a
top<00:04:03.690> bunk<00:04:03.959> that<00:04:04.049> lets<00:04:04.410> down<00:04:04.709> but<00:04:05.370> there's<00:04:05.580> no

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:05.730 
top bunk that lets down but there's no

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:07.130 
top bunk that lets down but there's no
cushion<00:04:05.940> up<00:04:06.180> there<00:04:06.360> so<00:04:06.630> we'll<00:04:06.750> have<00:04:06.870> to<00:04:07.019> do

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
cushion up there so we'll have to do

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.660 
cushion up there so we'll have to do
that

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
that

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.759 
that
there's<00:04:08.670> a<00:04:09.590> lot<00:04:10.590> of<00:04:10.709> damage<00:04:11.780> here<00:04:12.780> you<00:04:13.290> can<00:04:13.500> see

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:13.769

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450
