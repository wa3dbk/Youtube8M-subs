whites pans are made out of cast iron
and<00:00:22.180> this<00:00:23.110> one<00:00:23.290> is<00:00:23.380> from<00:00:23.529> lodge<00:00:23.739> logic<00:00:24.220> and<00:00:24.610> it

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:33.100 
medium low heat so that the cast iron is

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.979 
medium low heat so that the cast iron is
really<00:00:33.610> heated<00:00:33.969> well<00:00:34.149> all<00:00:34.420> the<00:00:34.540> way<00:00:34.570> through

and<00:00:35.260> then<00:00:35.859> brush<00:00:36.309> each<00:00:36.899> indentation<00:00:37.899> with<00:00:38.500> a

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
and then brush each indentation with a

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:41.579 
and then brush each indentation with a
little<00:00:38.829> bit<00:00:38.949> of<00:00:39.039> vegetable<00:00:39.550> oil<00:00:40.079> now<00:00:41.079> make

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:41.589

Abel<00:00:41.890> Scabbers<00:00:42.249> we<00:00:42.399> use<00:00:42.519> a<00:00:42.550> very<00:00:42.910> light<00:00:43.239> batter

00:00:43.709 --> 00:00:43.719 
Abel Scabbers we use a very light batter

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.299 
Abel Scabbers we use a very light batter
it<00:00:44.199> has<00:00:44.589> a<00:00:44.800> CIL's<00:00:45.070> in<00:00:45.219> it<00:00:45.339> and<00:00:45.940> the<00:00:47.010> egg<00:00:48.010> whites

00:00:48.299 --> 00:00:48.309 
it has a CIL's in it and the egg whites

00:00:48.309 --> 00:00:50.040 
it has a CIL's in it and the egg whites
were<00:00:48.609> whipped<00:00:48.879> separately<00:00:49.510> before<00:00:49.870> they<00:00:49.989> were

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
were whipped separately before they were

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.959 
were whipped separately before they were
folded<00:00:50.499> back<00:00:50.679> into<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.159> batter<00:00:51.339> so<00:00:51.640> it's<00:00:51.820> like

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:51.969 
folded back into the batter so it's like

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:55.169 
folded back into the batter so it's like
a<00:00:51.999> very<00:00:52.329> light<00:00:52.649> pancake<00:00:53.649> batter<00:00:53.829> and<00:00:54.129> you<00:00:54.219> fill

00:00:55.169 --> 00:00:55.179 
a very light pancake batter and you fill

00:00:55.179 --> 00:01:04.140 
a very light pancake batter and you fill
each<00:00:55.569> indentation<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:58.829> and<00:00:59.829> then<00:01:02.909> you<00:01:03.909> fill

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:04.150 
each indentation up and then you fill

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:06.180 
each indentation up and then you fill
each<00:01:04.420> indentation<00:01:04.989> up<00:01:05.440> halfway<00:01:05.710> and<00:01:06.100> then

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:06.190 
each indentation up halfway and then

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.730 
each indentation up halfway and then
take<00:01:06.580> a<00:01:06.610> skewer<00:01:07.030> after<00:01:08.020> 30<00:01:09.010> or<00:01:09.160> 45<00:01:09.700> seconds<00:01:10.480> and

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
take a skewer after 30 or 45 seconds and

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.250 
take a skewer after 30 or 45 seconds and
you're<00:01:11.740> gonna<00:01:11.860> turn<00:01:12.250> them<00:01:13.020> so<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.170> the

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.260 
you're gonna turn them so that the

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:16.980 
you're gonna turn them so that the
batter<00:01:14.470> blows<00:01:15.250> out<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:16.570> just<00:01:16.720> get<00:01:16.840> a<00:01:16.870> little

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:16.990 
batter blows out you just get a little
