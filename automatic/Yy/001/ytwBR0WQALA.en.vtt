off<00:00:59.640> with<00:00:59.670> Iron<00:01:00.090> Man<00:01:00.270> now<00:01:00.449> these<00:01:00.570> figures<00:01:00.840> are

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
off with Iron Man now these figures are

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.270 
off with Iron Man now these figures are
not<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.379> the<00:01:01.500> Marvel<00:01:01.800> legends<00:01:02.129> that<00:01:02.250> have

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
not like the Marvel legends that have

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.880 
not like the Marvel legends that have
all<00:01:02.579> the<00:01:02.789> articulation<00:01:03.480> and<00:01:03.719> I<00:01:03.960> guess<00:01:04.680> the

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
all the articulation and I guess the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.679 
all the articulation and I guess the
movements<00:01:05.700> possible<00:01:06.119> they<00:01:06.240> look<00:01:06.390> like<00:01:06.570> they

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
movements possible they look like they

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
movements possible they look like they
could<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.869> articulated<00:01:07.619> but<00:01:07.740> that's<00:01:07.890> just<00:01:08.130> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
could be articulated but that's just a

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.179 
could be articulated but that's just a
trick<00:01:09.060> of<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.299> eye<00:01:09.330> and<00:01:10.110> a<00:01:10.530> very<00:01:10.710> cleverly

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
trick of the eye and a very cleverly

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:13.910 
trick of the eye and a very cleverly
molded<00:01:11.729> figure<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.299> very<00:01:12.960> nice<00:01:13.260> looking<00:01:13.619> Iron

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:13.920

Assemble sub line now they do have ball
jointed<00:01:22.470> heads<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.009> they<00:01:23.040> can<00:01:23.310> rock<00:01:23.460> their

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
jointed heads so they can rock their

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.609 
jointed heads so they can rock their
heads<00:01:23.820> around<00:01:23.939> a<00:01:24.119> little<00:01:24.240> bit<00:01:24.450> but<00:01:24.990> no<00:01:25.170> elbow

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860 
no waist no knees no feet nothing like

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.130 
no waist no knees no feet nothing like
that<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.280> just<00:01:29.430> basically<00:01:29.970> arms<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.750> legs

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that it's just basically arms and legs

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.649 
that it's just basically arms and legs
so<00:01:32.070> they're<00:01:32.220> like<00:01:32.490> old-school<00:01:32.970> Star<00:01:33.450> Wars
