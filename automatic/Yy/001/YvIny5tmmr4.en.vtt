I<00:05:12.800> should<00:05:13.160> explain<00:05:13.250> this<00:05:13.670> was<00:05:13.790> something<00:05:14.060> that

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:14.090 
I should explain this was something that

I should explain this was something that
was<00:05:14.360> not<00:05:14.750> so<00:05:14.990> good<00:05:15.140> to<00:05:15.350> start<00:05:15.590> with<00:05:15.740> this<00:05:15.890> is<00:05:16.040> an

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190 
was not so good to start with this is an

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.010 
was not so good to start with this is an
early<00:05:16.430> prototype<00:05:16.730> and<00:05:17.300> it's<00:05:17.540> since<00:05:17.780> gone<00:05:17.960> on

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:18.020 
early prototype and it's since gone on

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:20.410 
early prototype and it's since gone on
to<00:05:18.140> be<00:05:18.320> an<00:05:18.410> amazing<00:05:18.800> product<00:05:19.180> even<00:05:20.180> in<00:05:20.300> this

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:20.420 
to be an amazing product even in this

00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:22.270 
to be an amazing product even in this
form<00:05:20.660> though<00:05:20.810> it<00:05:20.870> was<00:05:20.990> very<00:05:21.290> resilient<00:05:21.680> so<00:05:22.100> we

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:22.280 
form though it was very resilient so we

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.500 
form though it was very resilient so we
came<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:22.580> a<00:05:22.610> game<00:05:22.850> to<00:05:22.880> bring<00:05:23.210> it<00:05:23.300> out<00:05:23.390> of<00:05:23.450> the

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
came like a game to bring it out of the

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:25.150 
came like a game to bring it out of the
sky<00:05:23.600> once<00:05:23.840> I<00:05:23.990> shot<00:05:24.260> it<00:05:24.440> and<00:05:24.590> it<00:05:24.680> didn't<00:05:24.890> go<00:05:24.980> down

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:25.160 
sky once I shot it and it didn't go down

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.200 
sky once I shot it and it didn't go down
it's<00:05:25.430> like<00:05:25.580> wait<00:05:25.790> a<00:05:25.850> minute

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210
