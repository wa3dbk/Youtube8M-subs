00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
roll I think we're looking at maybe 30

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:38.530 
roll I think we're looking at maybe 30
35<00:04:32.150> and<00:04:33.190> maybe<00:04:35.350> 29<00:04:36.610> something<00:04:37.610> like<00:04:37.700> that<00:04:37.880> 25

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:38.540 
35 and maybe 29 something like that 25

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:40.330 
35 and maybe 29 something like that 25
maybe<00:04:38.870> I<00:04:39.110> don't<00:04:39.200> remember<00:04:39.650> I<00:04:39.800> think<00:04:39.950> I<00:04:40.160> got

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
maybe I don't remember I think I got

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.740 
maybe I don't remember I think I got
them<00:04:40.400> off<00:04:40.550> the<00:04:40.580> Amazon<00:04:41.120> you<00:04:41.300> probably<00:04:41.600> found

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
them off the Amazon you probably found

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.170 
them off the Amazon you probably found
them<00:04:41.900> cheaper<00:04:42.200> than<00:04:42.350> that<00:04:42.670> I'll<00:04:43.670> take<00:04:43.850> this<00:04:44.000> up

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:44.180 
them cheaper than that I'll take this up

them cheaper than that I'll take this up
to<00:04:44.240> I<00:04:44.390> think<00:04:44.480> this<00:04:44.720> was<00:04:44.870> like<00:04:45.080> maybe<00:04:45.710> I<00:04:46.100> think

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
to I think this was like maybe I think

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.630 
to I think this was like maybe I think
that<00:04:46.550> was<00:04:46.670> 14<00:04:47.210> and<00:04:47.480> this<00:04:47.540> was<00:04:47.720> maybe<00:04:47.870> 10<00:04:48.370> and<00:04:49.370> I

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:49.640 
that was 14 and this was maybe 10 and I

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.630 
that was 14 and this was maybe 10 and I
