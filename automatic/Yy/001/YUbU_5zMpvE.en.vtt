now<00:01:24.960> what<00:01:25.110> that<00:01:25.140> means<00:01:25.439> is<00:01:25.710> it<00:01:26.009> shares<00:01:26.759> its<00:01:27.180> ram

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
now what that means is it shares its ram

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.890 
now what that means is it shares its ram
with<00:01:28.229> the<00:01:28.799> processor<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:30.270> that<00:01:30.450> that's<00:01:30.659> fine

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
with the processor now that that's fine

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.510

way to go as a powerful computer
I<00:02:14.099> almost<00:02:15.090> got<00:02:15.239> a<00:02:15.299> macbook<00:02:15.510> myself<00:02:16.010> it<00:02:17.010> really

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
I almost got a macbook myself it really

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.910 
I almost got a macbook myself it really
is<00:02:17.400> a<00:02:17.430> good<00:02:17.579> machine<00:02:17.760> you<00:02:18.599> can<00:02:18.780> output<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.530> an

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
is a good machine you can output to an

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.270 
is a good machine you can output to an
external<00:02:20.430> monitor<00:02:20.970> it<00:02:21.480> can<00:02:21.720> show<00:02:22.019> I<00:02:22.379> think<00:02:23.099> up

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
external monitor it can show I think up

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.670 
external monitor it can show I think up
to<00:02:23.549> the<00:02:23.670> apple<00:02:23.909> cinema<00:02:24.180> display<00:02:24.510> 23<00:02:25.110> inch<00:02:25.260> so

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
to the apple cinema display 23 inch so

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.190 
to the apple cinema display 23 inch so
you're<00:02:26.189> getting<00:02:26.310> a<00:02:26.549> really<00:02:26.909> a<00:02:26.939> really<00:02:27.360> top

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
you're getting a really a really top

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.589 
you're getting a really a really top
quality<00:02:28.230> machine<00:02:29.150> something<00:02:30.150> that<00:02:30.269> decay

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
quality machine something that decay

quality machine something that decay
take<00:02:30.810> note<00:02:30.989> of<00:02:31.019> though<00:02:31.260> is<00:02:31.470> the<00:02:31.709> the<00:02:32.340> processor

take note of though is the the processor
and<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.239> GPU<00:02:33.840> is<00:02:33.900> really<00:02:34.140> what<00:02:34.290> sets<00:02:34.530> it<00:02:34.650> apart

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
and the GPU is really what sets it apart

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.520 
and the GPU is really what sets it apart
from<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.400> macbook<00:02:35.730> pro<00:02:35.930> so<00:02:36.930> there<00:02:37.409> you<00:02:37.439> go

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
from the macbook pro so there you go

way<00:02:43.260> to<00:02:43.349> go<00:02:43.500> it's<00:02:43.709> a<00:02:43.769> little<00:02:43.920> bit<00:02:44.040> cheaper

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
way to go it's a little bit cheaper

powerful machine plus in my opinion the

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.949 
powerful machine plus in my opinion the
black<00:02:48.540> one<00:02:48.690> looks<00:02:48.870> really<00:02:49.319> sleek<00:02:50.810> now<00:02:51.810> that

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
black one looks really sleek now that

Santa<00:03:15.569> Rosa<00:03:15.750> if<00:03:15.930> you've<00:03:16.109> heard<00:03:16.260> that<00:03:16.699> so<00:03:17.699> what

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
Santa Rosa if you've heard that so what

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.750 
Santa Rosa if you've heard that so what
that<00:03:18.030> means<00:03:18.389> is<00:03:18.660> a<00:03:19.199> little<00:03:19.620> bit<00:03:19.709> faster<00:03:19.859> higher

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
that means is a little bit faster higher

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.210 
that means is a little bit faster higher
front<00:03:21.180> side<00:03:21.359> bus<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.750> all<00:03:21.810> that<00:03:21.959> not<00:03:22.769> not<00:03:22.919> that

important it can have a max of 8

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.379 
important it can have a max of 8
gigabytes<00:03:25.709> of<00:03:25.829> RAM<00:03:26.099> so<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.000> can<00:03:27.120> run<00:03:27.209> a<00:03:27.269> little

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
gigabytes of RAM so it can run a little

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.599 
gigabytes of RAM so it can run a little
bit<00:03:27.540> faster<00:03:27.690> if<00:03:28.019> they<00:03:28.109> handle<00:03:28.349> for<00:03:28.620> you<00:03:29.459> know

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:29.609 
bit faster if they handle for you know

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:30.920

throw<00:03:31.049> at<00:03:31.199> it<00:03:31.760> it's<00:03:32.760> got<00:03:33.329> a<00:03:34.280> backlit<00:03:35.280> back

00:03:35.809 --> 00:03:35.819 
throw at it it's got a backlit back

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:38.930 
throw at it it's got a backlit back
screen<00:03:36.299> they<00:03:36.389> all<00:03:36.510> do<00:03:36.659> but<00:03:36.930> this<00:03:37.260> one<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.940> LED

you<00:03:48.150> notice<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.479> difference<00:03:48.780> if<00:03:49.049> you<00:03:49.620> look<00:03:49.829> at

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
you notice the difference if you look at

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:51.830 
you notice the difference if you look at
