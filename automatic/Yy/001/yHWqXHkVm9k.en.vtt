jolt
I<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.399> it<00:00:41.489> formed<00:00:41.820> his<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.540> think<00:00:43.230> they<00:00:43.320> were

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
I think it formed his I think they were

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
but I'll tell you what he did there's a

mini<00:00:50.670> comm<00:00:50.940> peg<00:00:51.210> back<00:00:51.449> here<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> jolt<00:00:52.110> had<00:00:52.289> one

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
mini comm peg back here and jolt had one

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.270 
mini comm peg back here and jolt had one
that<00:00:52.739> was<00:00:52.800> about<00:00:53.510> um<00:00:54.710> pretty<00:00:55.710> close<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.160> his

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
that was about um pretty close to his

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
that was about um pretty close to his
cockpit<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:56.969> what<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.270> would<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.570> was<00:00:57.780> he

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
cockpit and what you would do was he

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.040 
cockpit and what you would do was he
would<00:00:58.109> push<00:00:58.980> him<00:00:59.190> onto<00:00:59.969> here<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> then<00:01:00.750> fold

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
would push him onto here and then fold

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.240 
would push him onto here and then fold
him<00:01:01.230> back<00:01:01.500> and<00:01:01.859> then<00:01:01.949> he<00:01:02.039> would<00:01:02.160> have

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
him back and then he would have

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.490 
him back and then he would have
helicopter<00:01:03.030> blades<00:01:03.359> which<00:01:03.690> supposedly<00:01:04.290> made

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
helicopter blades which supposedly made

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.140 
helicopter blades which supposedly made
him<00:01:04.619> go

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
him go

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.030 
him go
SuperSpeed<00:01:06.150> the<00:01:06.360> cartoon<00:01:06.840> but<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.470> really<00:01:07.740> was

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
SuperSpeed the cartoon but it really was

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.000 
SuperSpeed the cartoon but it really was
a<00:01:08.070> useless<00:01:08.580> gimmick<00:01:09.150> because<00:01:09.799> he<00:01:10.799> doesn't

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
a useless gimmick because he doesn't

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:12.440 
a useless gimmick because he doesn't
roll<00:01:11.280> very<00:01:11.310> well<00:01:11.729> at<00:01:11.880> all<00:01:12.000> and<00:01:12.030> that's<00:01:12.240> pretty

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
roll very well at all and that's pretty

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.570 
roll very well at all and that's pretty
much<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.869> only<00:01:13.250> complaint<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.369> have<00:01:14.549> about

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
much the only complaint I have about

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.460 
much the only complaint I have about
this<00:01:14.970> figure<00:01:15.450> is<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:15.600> it<00:01:15.869> does<00:01:15.990> not<00:01:16.140> roll

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
this figure is that it does not roll

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.820 
this figure is that it does not roll
very<00:01:16.680> well<00:01:17.689> but<00:01:18.689> it<00:01:18.810> is<00:01:18.930> a<00:01:18.960> pretty<00:01:19.200> nice<00:01:19.439> car

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
very well but it is a pretty nice car

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.719 
very well but it is a pretty nice car
mode<00:01:20.460> it<00:01:21.390> does<00:01:21.540> have<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:22.650> gimmick<00:01:23.400> of<00:01:23.520> where

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
mode it does have the gimmick of where

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:30.200 
mode it does have the gimmick of where
you<00:01:23.850> put<00:01:24.810> the<00:01:24.960> engine<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:25.500> push<00:01:26.100> on<00:01:26.340> it

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:50.879 
to be a reference to blaster he does

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.979 
to be a reference to blaster he does
have<00:02:51.030> a<00:02:51.090> very<00:02:51.150> blaster<00:02:52.049> esque<00:02:52.260> face<00:02:53.040> design

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989 
have a very blaster esque face design

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:56.420 
have a very blaster esque face design
and<00:02:54.989> you<00:02:55.230> can't<00:02:55.440> push<00:02:55.650> those<00:02:55.859> back<00:02:56.099> all<00:02:56.310> the

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
and you can't push those back all the

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.910 
and you can't push those back all the
way<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:56.640> it<00:02:56.910> kind<00:02:57.180> of<00:02:57.269> looks<00:02:57.450> like<00:02:57.680> blaster<00:02:58.680> did

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
way so it kind of looks like blaster did

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.920 
way so it kind of looks like blaster did
but<00:02:59.700> you<00:02:59.760> can't<00:02:59.970> flip<00:03:00.150> him<00:03:00.269> down<00:03:00.450> if<00:03:00.629> you<00:03:00.720> want

can kinda do get to place it upside down

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:19.819 
can kinda do get to place it upside down
and<00:03:16.790> wiggle<00:03:17.790> it<00:03:17.910> around<00:03:18.230> to<00:03:19.230> find<00:03:19.500> the<00:03:19.650> right

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:19.829

and wiggle it around to find the right
spot<00:03:21.230> but<00:03:22.230> he<00:03:22.349> can't<00:03:22.620> hold<00:03:22.859> it<00:03:23.130> like<00:03:23.310> that<00:03:23.579> I

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410 
usually pose him like that just so he

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:27.530 
usually pose him like that just so he
can't<00:03:25.650> have<00:03:25.799> some<00:03:26.040> kind<00:03:26.250> of<00:03:26.280> gun<00:03:26.519> but<00:03:27.150> I<00:03:27.239> really

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:27.540 
can't have some kind of gun but I really

and<00:03:59.190> fires<00:03:59.430> a<00:03:59.579> missile<00:03:59.669> us<00:04:00.599> and<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.079> does<00:04:01.290> shoot

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
and fires a missile us and it does shoot

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.280 
and fires a missile us and it does shoot
out<00:04:01.829> rather<00:04:02.099> sporadically<00:04:02.819> so<00:04:03.329> anyway<00:04:04.230> you

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
out rather sporadically so anyway you

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.390 
out rather sporadically so anyway you
want<00:04:04.500> to<00:04:04.560> push<00:04:04.709> him<00:04:04.859> in<00:04:05.010> put<00:04:05.970> them<00:04:06.090> up<00:04:06.299> and<00:04:07.400> the

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
want to push him in put them up and the

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:14.780 
want to push him in put them up and the
missile<00:04:08.790> will<00:04:09.799> shoot<00:04:10.799> out<00:04:13.220> like<00:04:14.220> that<00:04:14.459> it's

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:14.790 
missile will shoot out like that it's

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.360 
missile will shoot out like that it's
actually<00:04:14.910> pretty<00:04:15.590> for<00:04:16.590> an<00:04:16.680> armada<00:04:17.039> line

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
actually pretty for an armada line

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:18.560 
actually pretty for an armada line
figure<00:04:17.789> it's<00:04:17.940> actually<00:04:18.209> a<00:04:18.269> pretty<00:04:18.479> powerful

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
figure it's actually a pretty powerful

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.670 
figure it's actually a pretty powerful
missile<00:04:19.440> but<00:04:20.250> he<00:04:20.370> does<00:04:20.579> have<00:04:20.760> the<00:04:20.820> gigantic

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:21.680 
missile but he does have the gigantic

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.940 
missile but he does have the gigantic
bazooka

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:22.950 
bazooka

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.570 
bazooka
and<00:04:23.270> like<00:04:24.270> he<00:04:24.390> did<00:04:24.630> in<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:24.930> cartoon<00:04:25.410> um<00:04:26.280> it

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
and like he did in the cartoon um it

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.080 
and like he did in the cartoon um it
looks<00:04:26.820> a<00:04:27.090> little<00:04:27.480> silly<00:04:28.290> but<00:04:28.950> not<00:04:29.580> so<00:04:29.790> much<00:04:29.970> I

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
looks a little silly but not so much I

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:31.550 
looks a little silly but not so much I
would<00:04:30.240> have<00:04:30.270> prefer<00:04:30.600> maybe<00:04:30.840> if<00:04:31.020> it<00:04:31.110> was<00:04:31.260> just<00:04:31.470> a

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
would have prefer maybe if it was just a

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.400 
would have prefer maybe if it was just a
little<00:04:31.980> bit<00:04:32.340> shorter<00:04:32.970> or<00:04:33.720> maybe<00:04:33.900> these<00:04:34.080> had<00:04:34.380> a

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
little bit shorter or maybe these had a

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.830 
little bit shorter or maybe these had a
way<00:04:34.650> to<00:04:34.680> uh<00:04:34.890> I<00:04:35.280> don't<00:04:35.430> know<00:04:35.580> pushing<00:04:36.180> I<00:04:36.450> guess

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
way to uh I don't know pushing I guess

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.140 
way to uh I don't know pushing I guess
but<00:04:37.140> but<00:04:37.740> still<00:04:37.950> not<00:04:38.100> bad<00:04:38.400> it<00:04:38.610> is<00:04:38.730> nice<00:04:38.940> that

00:04:39.140 --> 00:04:39.150 
but but still not bad it is nice that

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:40.640 
but but still not bad it is nice that
they<00:04:39.270> incorporated<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:40.080> feature

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
they incorporated that feature

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:43.520 
they incorporated that feature
I<00:04:41.330> usually<00:04:42.330> don't<00:04:42.600> bother<00:04:42.900> with<00:04:43.200> it<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:43.470> think

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
I usually don't bother with it I think

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:46.340 
I usually don't bother with it I think
he<00:04:43.740> looks<00:04:43.920> fine<00:04:44.100> just<00:04:44.340> the<00:04:44.430> way<00:04:44.460> he<00:04:44.670> is<00:04:45.350> again

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:46.350 
he looks fine just the way he is again

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.830 
he looks fine just the way he is again
