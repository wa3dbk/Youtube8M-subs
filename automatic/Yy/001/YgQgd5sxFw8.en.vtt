heck does that mean that is how you
start<00:00:35.280> from<00:00:36.090> this<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.660> bonsai<00:00:37.590> seed<00:00:37.920> and<00:00:38.250> you

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
start from this a bonsai seed and you

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.220 
start from this a bonsai seed and you
get<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.890> little<00:00:41.160> bonsai<00:00:41.340> seedlings

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:42.230 
get to this the little bonsai seedlings

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.360 
get to this the little bonsai seedlings
so<00:00:43.230> I'll<00:00:43.530> talk<00:00:43.739> about<00:00:43.800> a<00:00:43.980> little<00:00:44.190> bit<00:00:44.309> more

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
so I'll talk about a little bit more

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.369 
so I'll talk about a little bit more
we'll<00:00:45.090> launch<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.660> that<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> a<00:00:46.020> little<00:00:46.260> bit

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
we'll launch it to that is a little bit

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:47.900 
we'll launch it to that is a little bit
of<00:00:46.469> a<00:00:46.500> process<00:00:46.980> but<00:00:47.010> it's<00:00:47.309> not<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:47.700> difficult

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
of a process but it's not that difficult

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.540 
of a process but it's not that difficult
let's<00:00:48.600> do<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> introductory<00:00:49.320> video<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.100> then

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
let's do the introductory video and then

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.709 
let's do the introductory video and then
we<00:00:50.730> will<00:00:50.910> get<00:00:51.090> into<00:00:52.309> scarification<00:00:53.309> and

00:00:53.709 --> 00:00:53.719 
we will get into scarification and

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:56.389 
we will get into scarification and
stratification<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.930> bonsai<00:00:55.500> so<00:00:56.070> you<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
stratification of bonsai so you can

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.849 
stratification of bonsai so you can
start<00:00:56.730> with<00:00:56.879> the<00:00:57.030> seed<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.690> get<00:00:58.410> into<00:00:58.829> a

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
start with the seed and get into a

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.979 
start with the seed and get into a
little<00:00:59.250> seedling<00:00:59.730> like<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.149> Thank<00:01:01.079> You

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
little seedling like that Thank You

ok<00:01:13.369> you're<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.400> 2<00:01:14.640> step<00:01:14.850> process<00:01:14.880> of

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
ok you're not 2 step process of

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
ok you're not 2 step process of
scarification<00:01:16.229> and<00:01:16.350> then<00:01:16.439> stratification

let's<00:01:17.729> start<00:01:18.030> with<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> scarification<00:01:18.950> that

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
let's start with the scarification that

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.010 
let's start with the scarification that
is<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:20.430> process<00:01:20.880> where<00:01:21.090> you<00:01:21.270> break<00:01:21.570> down<00:01:21.810> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
is the process where you break down the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.499 
is the process where you break down the
hard<00:01:22.350> outer<00:01:22.590> shell<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.310> tree<00:01:23.580> seed<00:01:23.850> and

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
hard outer shell of the tree seed and

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.300 
hard outer shell of the tree seed and
you<00:01:24.869> do<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.259> usually<00:01:25.439> by<00:01:25.740> soaking<00:01:26.040> them<00:01:26.280> in

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
you do that usually by soaking them in

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.380 
you do that usually by soaking them in
water<00:01:26.460> for<00:01:26.939> a<00:01:26.970> determined<00:01:27.540> period<00:01:27.659> of<00:01:27.869> time

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
water for a determined period of time

water for a determined period of time
what<00:01:30.390> will<00:01:30.509> happen<00:01:30.900> is<00:01:31.049> over<00:01:31.290> 24<00:01:32.009> hours<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.340> 48

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
what will happen is over 24 hours to 48

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.580 
what will happen is over 24 hours to 48
hours<00:01:33.030> some<00:01:33.540> of<00:01:33.659> the<00:01:33.750> seeds<00:01:33.960> will<00:01:34.170> sink<00:01:34.409> and

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
hours some of the seeds will sink and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.580 
hours some of the seeds will sink and
some<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.860> them<00:01:34.979> will<00:01:35.130> float<00:01:36.350> you're<00:01:37.350> going<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
some of them will float you're going to

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.100 
some of them will float you're going to
check<00:01:37.799> those<00:01:37.979> out<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.520> remove<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> floaters

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
check those out and remove the floaters

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.560 
check those out and remove the floaters
those<00:01:40.320> seeds<00:01:40.560> are<00:01:40.680> no<00:01:40.799> good<00:01:41.009> then<00:01:41.610> usually<00:01:42.210> not

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
those seeds are no good then usually not

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.219 
those seeds are no good then usually not
viable

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
viable

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.469 
viable
the<00:01:43.829> sinking<00:01:44.310> seeds<00:01:44.640> are<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:44.939> ones<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.299> want

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
the sinking seeds are the ones you want

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.380 
the sinking seeds are the ones you want
they're<00:01:45.720> usually<00:01:45.930> viable<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.729> just<00:01:47.970> separate

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
they're usually viable so just separate

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.139 
they're usually viable so just separate
those<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.130> when<00:01:50.130> you<00:01:50.220> get<00:01:50.399> your<00:01:50.549> seeds<00:01:50.790> or

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
those and when you get your seeds or

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.289 
those and when you get your seeds or
look<00:01:51.479> it<00:01:51.600> up<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:52.020> will<00:01:52.670> get<00:01:53.670> the<00:01:53.790> instructions

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
look it up you will get the instructions

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.630 
look it up you will get the instructions
for<00:01:54.509> how<00:01:54.570> long<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.320> soak<00:01:56.070> them<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.310> water

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
for how long to soak them in water

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.520 
for how long to soak them in water
that's<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:58.049> scarification<00:02:00.140> then<00:02:01.140> from<00:02:01.350> there

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
that's the scarification then from there

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.980 
that's the scarification then from there
you're<00:02:02.219> going<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> stratify<00:02:02.969> your<00:02:03.390> seeds<00:02:03.659> now

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
you're going to stratify your seeds now

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.440 
you're going to stratify your seeds now
smoke<00:02:04.500> sees<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.829> cold<00:02:05.250> stratify<00:02:05.790> but<00:02:06.030> some<00:02:06.299> are

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
smoke sees a cold stratify but some are

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.910 
smoke sees a cold stratify but some are
warm<00:02:06.689> stratified<00:02:07.259> and<00:02:07.409> I'll<00:02:07.469> show<00:02:07.619> you<00:02:07.680> that

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
warm stratified and I'll show you that

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:10.249 
warm stratified and I'll show you that
so<00:02:08.789> you<00:02:08.849> put<00:02:09.149> them<00:02:09.239> in<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.450> little<00:02:09.660> bit<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:09.810> peat

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
so you put them in a little bit of peat

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.400 
so you put them in a little bit of peat
moss

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:11.410

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.830 
see if some of them any of them viably
sprout<00:02:35.280> so<00:02:36.280> make<00:02:36.610> sure<00:02:36.760> you<00:02:36.880> label<00:02:37.030> everything

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
sprout so make sure you label everything

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.800 
sprout so make sure you label everything
clearly<00:02:38.170> because<00:02:38.860> it<00:02:38.890> could<00:02:39.130> be<00:02:39.160> 30<00:02:39.490> 60<00:02:40.000> 90<00:02:40.030> 180

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810

days<00:02:41.230> in<00:02:41.850> the<00:02:42.850> fridge<00:02:43.120> so<00:02:43.450> you<00:02:43.630> want<00:02:43.900> to<00:02:43.990> know

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110 
days in the fridge so you want to know

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.050 
days in the fridge so you want to know
what<00:02:44.320> it<00:02:44.410> is<00:02:44.530> and<00:02:44.740> when<00:02:44.860> you<00:02:44.890> planted<00:02:45.550> it<00:02:45.640> so

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:46.060 
what it is and when you planted it so

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:49.080 
what it is and when you planted it so
label<00:02:46.330> everything<00:02:46.720> with<00:02:46.990> names<00:02:47.860> and<00:02:48.130> dates<00:02:48.460> so

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
label everything with names and dates so

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.910 
label everything with names and dates so
you<00:02:49.120> remember<00:02:49.720> it<00:02:49.840> so<00:02:50.350> you<00:02:50.380> don't<00:02:50.590> have<00:02:50.740> to

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
you remember it so you don't have to

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460 
you remember it so you don't have to
remember<00:02:51.160> it<00:02:51.420> then<00:02:52.420> we<00:02:52.540> warm<00:02:52.750> stratify<00:02:53.230> some

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
remember it then we warm stratify some

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:55.110 
remember it then we warm stratify some
of<00:02:53.560> them<00:02:53.680> are<00:02:53.890> called<00:02:54.280> to<00:02:54.400> be<00:02:54.490> warm<00:02:54.670> stratified

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
of them are called to be warm stratified

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.010 
of them are called to be warm stratified
I<00:02:55.150> put<00:02:55.510> them<00:02:55.630> in<00:02:55.750> the<00:02:55.810> little<00:02:56.020> greenhouse<00:02:59.730> and

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:01.020 
I put them in the little greenhouse and

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.630 
I put them in the little greenhouse and
some<00:03:02.020> of<00:03:02.110> them<00:03:02.200> a<00:03:02.320> cold<00:03:02.500> stratified<00:03:03.070> and<00:03:03.400> I<00:03:03.460> put

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:03.640 
some of them a cold stratified and I put

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:06.900 
some of them a cold stratified and I put
them<00:03:03.760> in<00:03:03.880> the<00:03:03.970> fridge<00:03:05.310> so<00:03:06.310> it's<00:03:06.700> an<00:03:06.790> easy

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
them in the fridge so it's an easy

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.090 
them in the fridge so it's an easy
process<00:03:07.300> but<00:03:07.780> it<00:03:07.870> does<00:03:08.080> take<00:03:08.440> time<00:03:08.650> and<00:03:08.710> isn't

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
process but it does take time and isn't

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.950 
process but it does take time and isn't
that<00:03:09.160> part<00:03:09.490> of<00:03:09.610> the<00:03:09.760> art<00:03:09.910> of<00:03:10.060> bonsai<00:03:10.240> is<00:03:10.600> taking

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:10.960 
that part of the art of bonsai is taking

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.350 
that part of the art of bonsai is taking
your<00:03:11.050> time<00:03:11.260> there's<00:03:11.830> no<00:03:12.160> big<00:03:12.490> hurry<00:03:12.700> it's

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
your time there's no big hurry it's

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.730 
your time there's no big hurry it's
going<00:03:13.540> to<00:03:13.660> be<00:03:13.810> five<00:03:14.050> to<00:03:14.200> seven<00:03:14.500> years<00:03:14.680> before

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
going to be five to seven years before

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.220 
going to be five to seven years before
they<00:03:15.100> start<00:03:15.430> looking<00:03:15.880> like<00:03:15.910> bonsai<00:03:16.450> trees<00:03:16.720> so

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
they start looking like bonsai trees so

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.330 
they start looking like bonsai trees so
let's<00:03:17.410> take<00:03:17.560> a<00:03:17.590> look<00:03:17.740> at<00:03:17.860> the<00:03:17.920> instructions

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
let's take a look at the instructions

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.440 
let's take a look at the instructions
that<00:03:18.460> came<00:03:18.610> with<00:03:18.790> these<00:03:18.940> try<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:19.930> at<00:03:20.050> maples

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
that came with these try it at maples

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.690 
that came with these try it at maples

scarification soak in tap water and let

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.530 
scarification soak in tap water and let
it<00:03:24.730> stand<00:03:24.940> for<00:03:25.060> 24<00:03:25.570> hours<00:03:27.360> stratification<00:03:28.360> to

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
it stand for 24 hours stratification to

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.660 
it stand for 24 hours stratification to
break<00:03:28.720> the<00:03:28.870> dormancy<00:03:29.260> during<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.370> water<00:03:30.520> from

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
break the dormancy during the water from

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:32.700 
break the dormancy during the water from
the<00:03:30.760> seed<00:03:30.970> and<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.330> put<00:03:31.630> them<00:03:31.720> with<00:03:31.900> sterile

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:32.710 
the seed and then put them with sterile

00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.190 
the seed and then put them with sterile
peat<00:03:32.890> moss<00:03:33.040> in<00:03:33.310> a<00:03:33.340> bag<00:03:33.580> and<00:03:33.880> cold<00:03:34.510> stratify<00:03:34.990> for

90<00:03:35.650> days<00:03:36.720> simple<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.840> that<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:40.209> that's<00:03:40.480> it<00:03:40.720> look

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:41.080 
90 days simple as that so that's it look

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:42.420 
90 days simple as that so that's it look
at<00:03:41.170> that<00:03:41.200> that's<00:03:41.470> going<00:03:41.650> to<00:03:41.709> be<00:03:41.830> a<00:03:41.860> beautiful

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
at that that's going to be a beautiful

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.820 
at that that's going to be a beautiful
bonsai<00:03:44.640> so<00:03:45.640> that<00:03:45.970> is<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.480> how<00:03:46.930> you<00:03:46.959> start<00:03:47.560> a

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:47.830 
bonsai so that is the how you start a

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:50.310 
bonsai so that is the how you start a
tree<00:03:48.100> seed<00:03:48.510> depending<00:03:49.510> on<00:03:49.630> the<00:03:49.750> type<00:03:49.959> of<00:03:49.990> seed

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
tree seed depending on the type of seed

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.170 
tree seed depending on the type of seed
always<00:03:50.620> look<00:03:50.770> up<00:03:50.890> the<00:03:51.010> specific<00:03:51.430> type<00:03:51.610> you

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
always look up the specific type you

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.449
