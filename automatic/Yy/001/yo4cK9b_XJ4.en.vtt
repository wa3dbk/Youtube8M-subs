 spoilers and today I bring you the 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:10.290
 review of the second book of the corridor 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.510
 of the labyrinth is game proof 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.910
 and before I start I have to mention 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:16.740
 what I'm going to say you do not have wyler 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.510
 However, if you are reading the 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 first book still in the house still 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.529
 they have not read it this is not the video for 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.689
 you because it's full of spoilers the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.000
 first book from the first line the 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.610
 synopsis of this book tells you the end 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.189
 of the other so I do not know if it's not for you 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.170
 better stretch yourself and you see me in all some 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.460
 You can find the review below 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.100
 of the first book if we had to 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.160
 see it and as you have visited now yes 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.320
 let's continue here let's start the 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.170
 prior to the second book are the 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:49.220
 first that the inhabitants manage to get out 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.840
 of the labyrinth some with life to others not 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:54.420
 they find other people who 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.700
 supposedly they are cruel and others that 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.670
 apparently they do not already understand very well 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:02.670
 what is your relationship with them and are 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.439
 led to a new space in which 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.729
 supposedly found in peace and he 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.690
 they will save the maze they will live 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:11.320
 calm and everyone will be happy 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.320
 but no 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.130
 Now that's the time when 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:18.770
 James comes from yesterday and laughs in the face 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.100
 of all and sent them back to you 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.100
 kill 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.890
 in this new mission that they are going to 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.289
 charge the guys they should 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.329
 to cross a desert to find a 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:31.369
 supposedly cures a disease that has 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:33.649
 destroyed the world that has wiped out 

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.100
 much every amount of the population 

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:39.950
 world 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.950
 and if they do not and wish to die clear 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:49.350
 ok now we have a lot of new 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.600
 questions as it was worth leaving 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.700
 of the labyrinth what is the goal of 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.570
 all this that they are doing with 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.690
 they 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.700
 the tests are the last people that 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:02.130
 remain of the planet are criminals no longer 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.080
 they have an idea of what is happening if 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.369
 of the labyrinth was a deception if what 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.890
 they are doing now it 's a new deception 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:10.730
 and in his path through the desert 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:13.739
 they will have to face many obstacles 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:17.940
 as with new people who want them 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:21.060
 kill and it's a great path of suffering 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.610
 and devastation because through a 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.900
 desert was not easy, especially if 

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.120
 you are only adding if you can not 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.130
 count on anyone else and also we 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 we ask what has to do cruel with 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:33.239
 all this and what it was that really 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.680
 He happened to the land so that it is well 

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:38.550
 How is that disease true? 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.310
 they are cheating again 

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.510
 now my opinion about the book saying 

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.600
 that the same as the first one I liked 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.710
 enough in this we can appreciate how 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:51.620
 tomás gets one more paper 

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:53.900
 of leader than in the first book because 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.750
 in the first book we saw that you take 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:59.180
 the beginning was well left out 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.430
 since in the new and the end he with his 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:03.620
 ideas get them out of the 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.230
 Labyrinth is now a leader but also 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.670
 could be considered a threat 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.770
 there is also Teresa who appears 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.560
 surprisingly in the first book now 

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:15.950
 It has a little more prominence and there 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.260
 a mess around her because there's 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.700
 many secrets with discovering things 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:21.350
 that they do not understand very well that of 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:24.380
 way a little 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:26.270
 another thing that I like is that despite 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.920
 the events that happen in the first book 

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:29.930
 we see how the boys are treated 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:32.960
 hold together to survive again 

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.760
 because they know that if they separated it is 

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:37.610
 probably not doing very well 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:40.640
 let's say and that 's 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.530
 apart from something I do not like about 

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.050
 first book was that the beginning to take 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.670
 has been lost and since you saw all the 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.980
 point says tomás we are also fine 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:51.170
 lost and now as nobody has an idea 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:54.020
 what is happening now required 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:57.290
 you feel so much that way 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:04:00.080
 and finally the plot of the book is very 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:03.400
 good has action everywhere 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:08.240
 has things that surprise you other than 

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:11.180
 they make you think a little theatrical and gives 

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:13.610
 pretty book that's true and they're going to 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.680
 living in many moments is not 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.489
 feel bad I have also been another 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.489
 vilely 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:25.250
 what I did not like was that because of what 

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.330
 I told them in their mission they have to 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:32.690
 to cross a desert in search of 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:34.930
 a solution and that is not something that they can 

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:37.810
 do very fast then 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:40.000
 much of the process I was doing a 

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.180
 little tedious for me to read because it was in 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.889
 It's very hot and when we go 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.499
 to arrive 

00:04:44.889 --> 00:04:50.830
 and we are dying of heat and how much 

00:04:47.499 --> 00:04:54.120
 missing to arrive and I see the hills and 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.889
 the hills are running out 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.080
 I liked that and a little 

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.599
 there is a little romance that seems to me 

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:04.030
 that was we have a little bit but to me 

00:05:01.599 --> 00:05:05.889
 I do not think it 's good for and in 

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.800
 conclusion I would like to tell you to read 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:10.509
 this book is very good for you to have 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.810
 their part are so heavy but still 

00:05:10.509 --> 00:05:16.029
 being very good if you can read all the 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:19.060
 saga I stayed there are already missing the 

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:20.979
 other books I'm trying to find them 

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.480
 on the edge they give it to me for 

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:24.430
 finish 

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.740
 if you are reading is a good manager 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:28.840
 still surprising is a story 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:31.660
 great you love catches you and you 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.940

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:36.430
 you end up including the epilogue 

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:38.050
 leave surprised already think you're going to 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:40.090
 finish everything you reach the epilogue and of 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:43.780
 suddenly wow there are already a lot of things 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.520
 that you are already surprised cruel on the one hand 

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.440
 there are so many on the other hand 

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:50.470
 feelings the trust of the 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.529
 lies the secrets is all a bit 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:58.039
 confusing but it 's good 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:06:00.229
 so you know the summers next 

00:05:58.039 --> 00:06:01.819

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:03.979

 they finished with the first book that 

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:11.389
 they will feel with the end if they will feel that the 

00:06:07.909 --> 00:06:13.219
