of game where I'm looking at it and I'm

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.630 
of game where I'm looking at it and I'm
thinking<00:00:34.380> that<00:00:34.469> I'm<00:00:34.559> expecting<00:00:34.950> nothing<00:00:35.309> but

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
thinking that I'm expecting nothing but

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.580 
thinking that I'm expecting nothing but
anything<00:00:36.000> else<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.690> bonus<00:00:36.870> out<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.469> this

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
anything else is a bonus out of this

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.040 
anything else is a bonus out of this
fixture<00:00:37.950> it's<00:00:38.520> going<00:00:38.670> to<00:00:38.700> be<00:00:38.790> very<00:00:38.820> very<00:00:39.450> very

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
fixture it's going to be very very very

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.900 
fixture it's going to be very very very
difficult<00:00:40.320> to<00:00:40.649> overturn<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.219> deficit<00:00:41.760> that

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
difficult to overturn the deficit that

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.850 
difficult to overturn the deficit that
we've<00:00:42.059> already<00:00:42.270> conceded<00:00:42.809> in<00:00:43.110> the<00:00:43.620> first

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
have such an excellent defensive record

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.310 
have such an excellent defensive record
at<00:00:47.670> home<00:00:47.969> I've<00:00:48.300> in<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.510> last<00:00:48.600> time<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.110> they

conceded two goals is back in November a
2-2<00:00:51.899> draw<00:00:52.190> so<00:00:53.190> we<00:00:53.340> know<00:00:53.550> quite<00:00:54.149> how<00:00:54.329> difficult

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
2-2 draw so we know quite how difficult

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.060 
2-2 draw so we know quite how difficult
this<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.840> going<00:00:55.050> to<00:00:55.110> be<00:00:55.260> but<00:00:55.469> I'm<00:00:55.590> confident

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
this is going to be but I'm confident

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.319 
this is going to be but I'm confident
that<00:00:56.160> if<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.430> feel<00:00:56.640> absolutely<00:00:56.879> everything

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
that if we feel absolutely everything

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.520 
that if we feel absolutely everything
that<00:00:57.449> we've<00:00:57.629> gone<00:00:57.809> against<00:00:58.199> them<00:00:58.350> I'm

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
that we've gone against them I'm

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.500 
that we've gone against them I'm
confident<00:00:59.370> we<00:00:59.550> can<00:00:59.579> at<00:00:59.789> least<00:00:59.940> get<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.270> couple

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
confident we can at least get a couple

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.819 
confident we can at least get a couple
of<00:01:00.600> goals<00:01:00.750> in<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.050> game<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.590> know<00:01:01.800> a

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
of goals in this game but we know a

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.889 
of goals in this game but we know a
couple<00:01:02.219> of<00:01:02.399> goals<00:01:02.609> isn't<00:01:03.329> enough<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:03.690> need<00:01:03.719> to

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
couple of goals isn't enough we need to

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:05.990 
couple of goals isn't enough we need to
be<00:01:03.989> scoring<00:01:04.290> free<00:01:04.559> pass<00:01:04.830> them<00:01:05.159> and<00:01:05.339> that's

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
be scoring free pass them and that's

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.520 
be scoring free pass them and that's
going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.270> very<00:01:06.299> very<00:01:06.689> very<00:01:07.229> difficult

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
going to be very very very difficult

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.649 
going to be very very very difficult
they<00:01:07.920> made<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:08.220> very<00:01:08.460> difficult<00:01:08.520> for<00:01:09.270> us<00:01:09.420> in

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:09.659 
they made it very difficult for us in

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:11.480 
they made it very difficult for us in
that<00:01:09.840> first<00:01:10.080> leg<00:01:10.320> but<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.740> can<00:01:11.040> kind<00:01:11.220> of<00:01:11.369> take

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
that first leg but I can kind of take

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.070 
that first leg but I can kind of take
hope<00:01:11.760> from<00:01:11.790> other<00:01:12.180> results<00:01:12.659> to<00:01:12.780> have<00:01:12.900> been

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
hope from other results to have been

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.420 
hope from other results to have been
occurring<00:01:13.439> in<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> Champions<00:01:14.159> League<00:01:14.189> for

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
occurring in the Champions League for

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.910 
occurring in the Champions League for
example<00:01:14.850> Chavez<00:01:15.509> victory<00:01:15.930> over<00:01:16.320> our<00:01:16.350> Madrid

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
example Chavez victory over our Madrid

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.670 
example Chavez victory over our Madrid
and<00:01:17.700> then<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.060> had<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> psg<00:01:18.600> getting<00:01:19.229> two<00:01:19.380> goals

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
and then you had a psg getting two goals

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.140 
and then you had a psg getting two goals
against<00:01:20.070> Josh<00:01:20.250> so<00:01:20.400> it<00:01:20.490> does<00:01:20.610> give<00:01:20.820> me<00:01:20.939> a<00:01:20.970> little

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
against Josh so it does give me a little

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.969 
against Josh so it does give me a little
spark<00:01:21.540> of<00:01:21.630> confidence<00:01:22.140> I<00:01:22.320> am<00:01:22.409> confident<00:01:22.770> we

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
spark of confidence I am confident we

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:24.109 
spark of confidence I am confident we
are<00:01:23.040> gonna<00:01:23.220> win<00:01:23.400> this<00:01:23.580> game<00:01:23.729> I'm<00:01:23.909> just<00:01:24.060> not

are gonna win this game I'm just not
very<00:01:24.270> confident<00:01:24.780> on<00:01:24.900> whether<00:01:25.110> we're<00:01:25.259> actually

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
very confident on whether we're actually

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.109

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
think personally the both of these will

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.510 
think personally the both of these will
start<00:04:32.870> I<00:04:32.990> think<00:04:33.020> that<00:04:33.440> you'll<00:04:33.650> start<00:04:34.070> with<00:04:34.280> I

think<00:04:34.700> venga<00:04:35.120> is<00:04:35.210> going<00:04:35.360> to<00:04:35.419> play<00:04:35.600> one<00:04:35.780> of<00:04:35.840> them

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
think venga is going to play one of them

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
think venga is going to play one of them
out<00:04:36.200> wide<00:04:36.500> but<00:04:36.740> they're<00:04:36.860> going<00:04:36.980> to

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
out wide but they're going to

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.040 
out wide but they're going to
interchange<00:04:37.310> in<00:04:38.030> at<00:04:38.180> number<00:04:38.300> 10<00:04:38.600> I<00:04:38.630> think<00:04:38.960> that

00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:39.050 
interchange in at number 10 I think that

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.690 
interchange in at number 10 I think that
would<00:04:39.110> be<00:04:39.169> a<00:04:39.230> preferable<00:04:39.500> thing<00:04:39.950> to<00:04:40.100> do<00:04:40.280> we're

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.409 
but I do think one of well back or walk
up<00:05:42.919> whilst<00:05:43.220> I<00:05:43.310> in<00:05:43.370> this<00:05:43.550> fixture<00:05:43.850> based<00:05:44.090> a<00:05:44.210> very

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:46.610 
very very difficult one to call I think

00:05:46.610 --> 00:05:47.830 
very very difficult one to call I think
with<00:05:46.729> those<00:05:46.880> two<00:05:47.030> players<00:05:47.240> coming<00:05:47.510> off<00:05:47.690> from
