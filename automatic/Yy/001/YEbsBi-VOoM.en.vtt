00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:33.910 
left Bhagat the check but basically what

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.780

this<00:00:34.030> mod<00:00:34.269> is<00:00:34.300> its

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:36.790 
this mod is its

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.250 

almost<00:00:37.570> like<00:00:37.660> a<00:00:37.770> version<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:40.260> equivalent

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
almost like a version of equivalent

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.680 
almost like a version of equivalent
exchange<00:00:41.320> to<00:00:41.890> it<00:00:42.670> has<00:00:42.820> like<00:00:43.090> basically<00:00:43.510> the

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
exchange to it has like basically the

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.040 
exchange to it has like basically the
same<00:00:43.840> functionality<00:00:44.500> is<00:00:44.620> what<00:00:45.510> ee2<00:00:46.510> used<00:00:46.930> to

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
same functionality is what ee2 used to

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:49.530 
same functionality is what ee2 used to
do<00:00:47.140> what<00:00:47.860> I'm<00:00:47.950> assuming<00:00:48.340> a<00:00:48.520> III<00:00:49.090> is<00:00:49.150> going<00:00:49.390> to

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:49.540 
do what I'm assuming a III is going to

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.800 
do what I'm assuming a III is going to
do<00:00:49.660> eventually<00:00:50.320> and<00:00:51.310> that<00:00:51.490> is<00:00:51.670> basically<00:00:51.910> you

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:52.810 
do eventually and that is basically you

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:58.320 
do eventually and that is basically you

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.510 
to be BMC I'm just comparing it because
it's<00:02:49.170> almost<00:02:49.320> the<00:02:49.500> exact<00:02:49.740> same<00:02:49.770> thing<00:02:50.220> except

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520 
it's almost the exact same thing except

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:56.570 
it's almost the exact same thing except
for<00:02:51.200> et<00:02:52.200> tu<00:02:52.380> isn't<00:02:52.710> for<00:02:52.950> 1.5<00:02:53.640> anymore<00:02:54.740> but<00:02:55.740> so

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
for et tu isn't for 1.5 anymore but so

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.720 
for et tu isn't for 1.5 anymore but so
yeah<00:02:56.730> when<00:02:57.060> you<00:02:57.150> put<00:02:57.360> items<00:02:58.080> into<00:02:58.320> the

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
yeah when you put items into the

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.360 
yeah when you put items into the
optimizer

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
optimizer

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.170 
optimizer
it'll

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
it'll

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.069 
it'll
put<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:03.980> alchemical<00:03:04.980> energy<00:03:05.519> container<00:03:05.849> as

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:06.079 
put the alchemical energy container as

00:03:06.079 --> 00:03:09.709 
put the alchemical energy container as
the<00:03:07.079> output<00:03:07.230> and<00:03:07.680> it's<00:03:08.189> basically<00:03:08.969> the<00:03:09.090> sum<00:03:09.480> of

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:09.719 
the output and it's basically the sum of

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:13.160 
the output and it's basically the sum of
all<00:03:10.200> of<00:03:10.290> the<00:03:11.000> CV<00:03:12.000> that<00:03:12.420> everything<00:03:13.079> that

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
all of the CV that everything that

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.880 
all of the CV that everything that
that's<00:03:13.709> in<00:03:13.950> this<00:03:14.189> grade<00:03:14.879> has<00:03:15.680> so<00:03:16.680> when<00:03:16.769> you

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
that's in this grade has so when you

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:20.300 
that's in this grade has so when you
take<00:03:17.040> it<00:03:17.159> out<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:18.569> know<00:03:18.750> how<00:03:18.780> the<00:03:19.650> obviously

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
take it out you know how the obviously

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.530 
take it out you know how the obviously
the<00:03:20.400> alchemical<00:03:20.909> thing

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
the alchemical thing

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:26.289 
the alchemical thing
and<00:03:21.719> to<00:03:22.519> transmute<00:03:23.519> that<00:03:23.760> back<00:03:24.120> into

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
and to transmute that back into

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.369 
and to transmute that back into
materials<00:03:27.299> you<00:03:27.510> will<00:03:27.599> have<00:03:27.780> to<00:03:27.900> actually<00:03:28.049> have

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
materials you will have to actually have

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:34.800 
materials you will have to actually have
the<00:03:29.090> material<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.269> advance<00:03:30.930> you<00:03:31.829> want<00:03:32.010> to

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.850 

condensed<00:03:35.590> basically

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
condensed basically

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.810 
condensed basically
and<00:03:38.370> you<00:03:38.520> put<00:03:38.730> put<00:03:39.570> it<00:03:39.660> in<00:03:39.870> this<00:03:40.710> middle<00:03:41.550> slot

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
and you put put it in this middle slot

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.540 
and you put put it in this middle slot
right<00:03:41.970> here<00:03:42.060> not<00:03:42.480> down<00:03:42.600> here<00:03:42.660> here<00:03:43.170> and<00:03:43.290> then

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
right here not down here here and then

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.390 
right here not down here here and then
put<00:03:44.550> the<00:03:44.820> alchemical<00:03:45.650> energy<00:03:46.650> container<00:03:47.130> into

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 
put the alchemical energy container into

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.320 
put the alchemical energy container into
this<00:03:48.090> slot<00:03:48.240> up<00:03:48.480> here<00:03:48.750> and<00:03:49.250> okay<00:03:50.250> maybe<00:03:51.180> not

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
this slot up here and okay maybe not

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.380 
this slot up here and okay maybe not
moving<00:03:51.840> up<00:03:51.930> great<00:03:52.080> clubs<00:03:52.910> something<00:03:53.910> still

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
moving up great clubs something still

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:55.800 
moving up great clubs something still
works

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
works

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.240 
works
those<00:03:56.380> don't<00:03:56.530> have<00:03:56.709> a<00:03:56.739> DVD

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
those don't have a DVD

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.930 
those don't have a DVD
as<00:03:59.700> you<00:03:59.850> can<00:04:00.000> see

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.170 

take<00:04:06.450> it<00:04:06.570> out<00:04:06.720> and<00:04:07.010> it<00:04:08.010> takes<00:04:08.730> it<00:04:08.880> right<00:04:09.000> out<00:04:09.150> of

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
take it out and it takes it right out of

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.590 
take it out and it takes it right out of
the<00:04:09.500> alchemical<00:04:10.500> I<00:04:10.560> need<00:04:10.740> you<00:04:10.800> container<00:04:11.100> and

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
the alchemical I need you container and

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.990 
the alchemical I need you container and
that's<00:04:12.600> that's<00:04:12.930> basically<00:04:13.880> everything<00:04:14.880> in

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
that's that's basically everything in

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.720 
that's that's basically everything in
the<00:04:15.060> mud<00:04:15.240> that's<00:04:15.739> the<00:04:16.739> whole<00:04:16.890> thing<00:04:16.920> I<00:04:17.220> thought

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
the mud that's the whole thing I thought

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.060 
the mud that's the whole thing I thought
it<00:04:17.820> was<00:04:17.880> amazing<00:04:18.360> and<00:04:18.540> awesome<00:04:19.049> because<00:04:19.620> I

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
it was amazing and awesome because I

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.250 
it was amazing and awesome because I
always<00:04:21.030> loved<00:04:21.299> being<00:04:21.510> able<00:04:21.660> to<00:04:21.840> do<00:04:21.959> that<00:04:22.080> with

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
always loved being able to do that with

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:26.360 
always loved being able to do that with
um<00:04:22.680> field<00:04:23.280> XD<00:04:23.700> too<00:04:24.420> and<00:04:24.720> I<00:04:25.650> kind<00:04:25.950> of<00:04:25.980> missed<00:04:26.190> it

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:26.370 
um field XD too and I kind of missed it

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:31.400 
um field XD too and I kind of missed it
and<00:04:26.520> then<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:28.710> it's<00:04:28.860> back<00:04:29.040> in<00:04:29.870> most<00:04:30.870> raw<00:04:31.080> form

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
and then now it's back in most raw form

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.440 
and then now it's back in most raw form
possible<00:04:31.680> and<00:04:32.370> have<00:04:32.520> to<00:04:32.700> go<00:04:33.000> through<00:04:33.210> what<00:04:33.330> you

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:33.450 
possible and have to go through what you

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:36.530 
possible and have to go through what you
crapped<00:04:33.690> it<00:04:33.840> rain<00:04:34.910> make<00:04:35.910> something<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.390> did

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
crapped it rain make something that did

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:37.850 
crapped it rain make something that did
almost<00:04:36.750> the<00:04:37.050> same<00:04:37.170> thing<00:04:37.230> nope<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.800> just
