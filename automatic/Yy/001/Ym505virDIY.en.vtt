focus<00:00:05.850> is<00:00:06.240> on<00:00:06.569> light<00:00:07.049> what<00:00:07.680> are<00:00:07.919> light<00:00:08.220> levels

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
focus is on light what are light levels

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.850 
focus is on light what are light levels
and<00:00:08.760> motes<00:00:09.240> of<00:00:09.420> light<00:00:09.480> and<00:00:09.870> how<00:00:10.380> do<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.650> obtain

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
and motes of light and how do you obtain

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.070 
and motes of light and how do you obtain
them<00:00:11.429> the<00:00:11.610> answers<00:00:12.000> are<00:00:12.269> much<00:00:12.630> simpler<00:00:12.990> than

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
them the answers are much simpler than

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.440 
them the answers are much simpler than
they<00:00:13.380> seem<00:00:13.440> so<00:00:14.429> let's<00:00:14.670> dive<00:00:14.910> right<00:00:14.969> in<00:00:15.330> and

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
they seem so let's dive right in and

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.230 
they seem so let's dive right in and
take<00:00:15.540> a<00:00:15.750> look<00:00:16.049> I'm<00:00:16.350> gonna<00:00:16.590> use<00:00:16.890> my<00:00:17.060> Titan<00:00:18.060> here

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
take a look I'm gonna use my Titan here

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.179 
take a look I'm gonna use my Titan here
as<00:00:18.390> an<00:00:18.510> example<00:00:18.779> because<00:00:18.930> I<00:00:19.410> have<00:00:19.650> reached<00:00:19.949> the

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
as an example because I have reached the

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.090 
as an example because I have reached the
max<00:00:20.490> experience<00:00:21.270> level<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.810> 20<00:00:22.199> and<00:00:22.320> actually

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
max experience level of 20 and actually

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.970 
max experience level of 20 and actually
leveled<00:00:23.490> beyond<00:00:23.910> 20<00:00:24.869> with<00:00:25.109> light<00:00:25.350> levels<00:00:25.740> so

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
leveled beyond 20 with light levels so

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.029 
leveled beyond 20 with light levels so
let's<00:00:26.250> dive<00:00:26.490> right<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.849> into<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.359> character

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:28.039 
let's dive right in into the character

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.690 
let's dive right in into the character
menu<00:00:29.039> screen<00:00:29.599> so<00:00:30.599> once<00:00:31.470> you<00:00:31.679> gain<00:00:31.920> any<00:00:32.189> kind<00:00:32.640> of

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
menu screen so once you gain any kind of

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:34.850 
menu screen so once you gain any kind of
light<00:00:32.940> towards<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.300> light<00:00:33.480> level<00:00:33.809> your<00:00:34.200> defense

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
light towards a light level your defense

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.130 
light towards a light level your defense
and<00:00:35.219> then<00:00:35.489> these<00:00:35.730> armor<00:00:36.300> stats<00:00:36.660> right<00:00:36.899> here

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
and then these armor stats right here

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.990 
and then these armor stats right here
and<00:00:37.350> elect<00:00:37.649> discipline<00:00:38.250> strength<00:00:38.730> they<00:00:38.850> all

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
and elect discipline strength they all

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.869 
and elect discipline strength they all
move<00:00:39.300> down<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.870> make<00:00:40.050> space<00:00:40.410> for<00:00:40.440> light<00:00:41.309> so

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
move down and make space for light so

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.160 
move down and make space for light so
I'm<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.059> going<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.270> read<00:00:42.390> the<00:00:42.510> tooltip<00:00:42.930> right

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
I'm just going to read the tooltip right

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.770 
I'm just going to read the tooltip right
here<00:00:43.440> light<00:00:43.770> levels<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.340> only<00:00:44.760> way<00:00:44.969> to<00:00:45.030> level

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
here light levels the only way to level

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.790 
here light levels the only way to level
up<00:00:46.079> past<00:00:46.920> 20<00:00:47.430> is<00:00:47.640> through<00:00:48.030> light<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.200> light

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
up past 20 is through light and light

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.139 
up past 20 is through light and light
levels<00:00:50.160> so<00:00:50.309> light<00:00:50.520> allows<00:00:50.760> you<00:00:50.940> to<00:00:51.030> increase

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
levels so light allows you to increase

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:53.360 
levels so light allows you to increase
your<00:00:51.329> level<00:00:51.690> above<00:00:51.930> 20<00:00:52.350> increase<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.160> life

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
your level above 20 increase your life

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.100 
your level above 20 increase your life
by<00:00:53.579> finding<00:00:53.969> an<00:00:54.120> equipping<00:00:54.570> armor<00:00:54.960> which

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
by finding an equipping armor which

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.200 
by finding an equipping armor which
contains<00:00:55.469> light<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:56.280> pretty<00:00:57.000> much<00:00:57.180> explains

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
contains light that pretty much explains

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.779 
contains light that pretty much explains
all<00:00:57.899> I<00:00:57.930> need<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.469> explain<00:00:58.770> about<00:00:58.980> it<00:00:59.309> the

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
all I need to explain about it the

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.720 
all I need to explain about it the
lights<00:01:00.120> that<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.660> only<00:01:00.989> found<00:01:01.440> on<00:01:01.680> armor<00:01:02.370> so

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
lights that is only found on armor so

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.260 
lights that is only found on armor so
for<00:01:03.510> example<00:01:03.600> my<00:01:04.170> leg<00:01:04.530> armor<00:01:04.920> here<00:01:05.280> gives<00:01:05.970> me

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
for example my leg armor here gives me

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.690 
for example my leg armor here gives me
light<00:01:06.570> and<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:06.990> appears<00:01:07.409> as<00:01:07.619> an<00:01:07.770> armor<00:01:08.130> stat<00:01:08.460> so

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
light and it appears as an armor stat so

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.429 
light and it appears as an armor stat so
if<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:08.850> go<00:01:09.000> in<00:01:09.119> here<00:01:09.299> into<00:01:09.420> the<00:01:09.630> details<00:01:10.080> it

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
if you go in here into the details it

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.859 
if you go in here into the details it
shows<00:01:11.220> up<00:01:11.460> next<00:01:11.970> to<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.360> intellect

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
shows up next to the intellect

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.719 
shows up next to the intellect
disciplined<00:01:13.380> strength<00:01:13.799> pretty<00:01:14.220> much<00:01:14.400> as<00:01:14.580> an

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
disciplined strength pretty much as an

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.270 
disciplined strength pretty much as an
armor<00:01:15.030> staff<00:01:15.240> so<00:01:15.840> here<00:01:16.140> it<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> light<00:01:16.619> light

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
armor staff so here it is light light

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.859 
armor staff so here it is light light
increases<00:01:17.549> your<00:01:17.880> level<00:01:18.240> increasing<00:01:18.750> the

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
increases your level increasing the

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.020 
increases your level increasing the
damage<00:01:19.380> or<00:01:20.100> increasing<00:01:20.549> damage<00:01:20.729> your

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
damage or increasing damage your

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.140 
damage or increasing damage your
abilities<00:01:21.479> steel<00:01:22.189> against<00:01:23.189> higher<00:01:23.520> level

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
abilities steel against higher level

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.899 
abilities steel against higher level
enemies<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.290> all<00:01:25.470> right<00:01:25.500> here<00:01:26.189> and<00:01:26.369> i

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
enemies so it's all right here and i

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.649 
enemies so it's all right here and i
have<00:01:26.970> three<00:01:27.509> pieces<00:01:27.750> of<00:01:28.520> light<00:01:29.520> armor<00:01:30.329> right

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
have three pieces of light armor right

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.990 
have three pieces of light armor right
here<00:01:30.900> that<00:01:31.079> increase<00:01:31.890> my<00:01:32.189> light<00:01:32.460> level<00:01:32.820> and

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
here that increase my light level and

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.600 
here that increase my light level and
that's<00:01:33.810> how<00:01:33.990> it<00:01:34.110> works<00:01:34.290> and<00:01:34.590> another<00:01:35.280> thing<00:01:35.369> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
that's how it works and another thing to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.520 
that's how it works and another thing to
note<00:01:35.729> it's<00:01:36.150> only<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:36.600> your<00:01:36.720> armor<00:01:36.960> like<00:01:37.140> i<00:01:37.259> said

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
note it's only on your armor like i said

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.800 
note it's only on your armor like i said
so<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:37.920> only<00:01:38.130> going<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.490> see<00:01:38.700> light<00:01:39.090> level

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
so you're only going to see light level

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.649 
so you're only going to see light level
or<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.409> light<00:01:40.829> stat<00:01:41.250> on<00:01:41.520> your<00:01:41.820> leg<00:01:42.060> armor<00:01:42.450> your

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
or the light stat on your leg armor your

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.420 
or the light stat on your leg armor your
chest<00:01:42.930> armor<00:01:43.290> your<00:01:43.439> gauntlets<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:44.040> your

chest armor your gauntlets and your
helmet<00:01:44.820> that's<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:45.090> only<00:01:45.390> place<00:01:45.600> you're

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
helmet that's the only place you're

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.630

going<00:01:45.810> to<00:01:46.049> see<00:01:46.229> light<00:01:46.500> so<00:01:47.040> you<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.490> get

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
going to see light so you have to get

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.630 
going to see light so you have to get
gear<00:01:47.970> that<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.509> in<00:01:48.899> one<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.439> these<00:01:49.649> slots<00:01:50.340> in

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
gear that is in one of these slots in

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:54.050 
gear that is in one of these slots in
order<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.090> increase<00:01:52.049> that<00:01:52.500> light<00:01:53.009> level<00:01:53.430> so

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
order to increase that light level so

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:55.609 
order to increase that light level so
that's<00:01:54.299> pretty<00:01:54.479> much<00:01:54.570> all<00:01:54.869> I<00:01:54.960> have<00:01:55.229> to<00:01:55.350> explain

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
that's pretty much all I have to explain

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.520 
that's pretty much all I have to explain
about<00:01:55.770> that<00:01:56.009> also<00:01:56.869> you<00:01:57.869> can<00:01:58.020> check<00:01:58.049> your

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
about that also you can check your

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.950 
about that also you can check your
progress<00:01:58.979> towards<00:01:59.759> your<00:01:59.969> next<00:02:00.299> light<00:02:00.659> level

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
progress towards your next light level

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.800 
progress towards your next light level
by<00:02:01.500> hovering<00:02:01.680> over<00:02:01.950> the<00:02:02.250> light<00:02:02.520> stat<00:02:02.850> so<00:02:03.509> as

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
by hovering over the light stat so as

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.990 
by hovering over the light stat so as
you<00:02:04.110> can<00:02:04.229> tell<00:02:04.290> it<00:02:04.680> says<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.979> have<00:02:05.100> 39<00:02:05.549> light

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
you can tell it says I have 39 light

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.969 
you can tell it says I have 39 light
that's<00:02:06.240> what<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.570> number<00:02:06.930> means<00:02:07.110> and<00:02:07.560> then

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
that's what that number means and then

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.360 
that's what that number means and then
the<00:02:08.129> little<00:02:08.399> yellow<00:02:09.300> bar<00:02:09.780> actually<00:02:10.370> gauges

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
the little yellow bar actually gauges

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.140 
the little yellow bar actually gauges
how<00:02:11.730> close<00:02:12.209> I<00:02:12.390> am<00:02:12.420> to

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
how close I am to

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.289 
how close I am to
the<00:02:13.209> next<00:02:13.510> level<00:02:13.870> so<00:02:14.500> if<00:02:15.099> I<00:02:15.849> were<00:02:16.000> a<00:02:16.030> betting

00:02:16.289 --> 00:02:16.299 
the next level so if I were a betting

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:19.350 
the next level so if I were a betting
man<00:02:16.510> I<00:02:16.959> would<00:02:16.989> say<00:02:17.409> that<00:02:17.439> I<00:02:17.769> need<00:02:18.069> 50<00:02:18.610> light<00:02:19.150> in

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:19.360 
man I would say that I need 50 light in

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.979 
man I would say that I need 50 light in
order<00:02:19.599> to<00:02:19.689> get<00:02:20.260> to<00:02:20.560> light<00:02:20.860> level<00:02:21.310> 23<00:02:22.239> and<00:02:22.480> i

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
order to get to light level 23 and i

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:24.780 
order to get to light level 23 and i
already<00:02:23.200> have<00:02:23.290> 39<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.980> that<00:02:24.129> means<00:02:24.310> i<00:02:24.489> only

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
already have 39 so that means i only

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.990 
already have 39 so that means i only
need<00:02:25.000> 11<00:02:25.540> more<00:02:25.810> light<00:02:26.379> from<00:02:27.069> some<00:02:27.640> piece<00:02:27.970> of

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
need 11 more light from some piece of

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.690 
need 11 more light from some piece of
armor<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:28.720> these<00:02:29.200> categories<00:02:29.500> in<00:02:30.340> order<00:02:30.549> to

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:30.700 
armor in these categories in order to

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:33.240 
armor in these categories in order to
level<00:02:30.939> that<00:02:31.150> up<00:02:31.359> so<00:02:32.079> next<00:02:32.319> up<00:02:32.560> let's<00:02:32.980> talk

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
level that up so next up let's talk

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:35.699 
level that up so next up let's talk
about<00:02:33.430> motes<00:02:33.909> of<00:02:34.120> light<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:35.079> they<00:02:35.260> are<00:02:35.409> they

00:02:35.699 --> 00:02:35.709 
about motes of light here they are they

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:38.670 
about motes of light here they are they
are<00:02:35.890> a<00:02:35.920> rare<00:02:36.519> currency<00:02:37.269> as<00:02:37.840> what<00:02:38.170> they<00:02:38.319> are<00:02:38.470> and

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
are a rare currency as what they are and

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.920 
are a rare currency as what they are and
you<00:02:38.769> can<00:02:38.920> find<00:02:39.129> them<00:02:39.250> in<00:02:39.340> the<00:02:39.370> inventory

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
you can find them in the inventory

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.809 
you can find them in the inventory
screen<00:02:40.930> under<00:02:41.470> materials<00:02:42.010> and<00:02:42.489> they<00:02:42.579> look

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
screen under materials and they look

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.180 
screen under materials and they look
just<00:02:43.090> like<00:02:43.239> this<00:02:43.659> you<00:02:44.319> can<00:02:44.470> spend<00:02:44.739> these<00:02:44.920> at

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
just like this you can spend these at

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.750 
just like this you can spend these at
the<00:02:45.220> speaker<00:02:46.150> for<00:02:46.629> some<00:02:47.470> of<00:02:47.620> his<00:02:47.859> gear<00:02:48.459> you

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
the speaker for some of his gear you

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.000 
the speaker for some of his gear you
know<00:02:48.879> weapons<00:02:49.359> armor<00:02:49.989> I<00:02:50.139> believe<00:02:50.650> some

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
know weapons armor I believe some

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.039 
know weapons armor I believe some
emblems<00:02:51.609> even<00:02:52.120> you<00:02:52.269> can<00:02:52.450> spend<00:02:52.720> motes<00:02:52.930> of

00:02:53.039 --> 00:02:53.049 
emblems even you can spend motes of

00:02:53.049 --> 00:02:55.050 
emblems even you can spend motes of
light<00:02:53.109> on<00:02:53.470> I<00:02:53.680> wouldn't<00:02:54.340> do<00:02:54.519> that<00:02:54.549> if<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:54.909> were

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
light on I wouldn't do that if I were

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.629 
light on I wouldn't do that if I were
you<00:02:55.239> and<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:56.079> can<00:02:56.200> also<00:02:56.319> spend<00:02:56.889> motes<00:02:57.519> of

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:57.639 
you and you can also spend motes of

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.520 
you and you can also spend motes of
light<00:02:57.700> at<00:02:58.060> the<00:02:58.090> agent<00:02:58.569> of<00:02:58.599> the<00:02:58.750> nine<00:02:58.780> the<00:02:59.319> black

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
light at the agent of the nine the black

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:02.009 
light at the agent of the nine the black
market<00:02:59.799> guy<00:03:00.099> on<00:03:00.400> an<00:03:00.819> exotic<00:03:01.090> Engram<00:03:01.689> which<00:03:01.900> is

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
market guy on an exotic Engram which is

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.349 
market guy on an exotic Engram which is
really<00:03:02.379> good<00:03:02.650> you<00:03:03.159> need<00:03:03.310> 23<00:03:03.849> motes<00:03:04.180> of<00:03:04.299> light

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
really good you need 23 motes of light

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:07.319 
really good you need 23 motes of light
so<00:03:05.139> you<00:03:05.200> get<00:03:05.530> motes<00:03:05.799> of<00:03:05.950> light<00:03:06.030> randomly<00:03:07.030> just

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:07.329 
so you get motes of light randomly just

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:10.619 
so you get motes of light randomly just
by<00:03:07.540> playing<00:03:07.900> strikes<00:03:08.970> by<00:03:09.970> playing<00:03:10.299> just

00:03:10.619 --> 00:03:10.629 
by playing strikes by playing just

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:12.629 
by playing strikes by playing just
missions<00:03:11.139> they<00:03:11.319> can<00:03:11.470> even<00:03:11.680> drop<00:03:11.920> in<00:03:12.189> missions

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:12.639 
missions they can even drop in missions

00:03:12.639 --> 00:03:14.819 
missions they can even drop in missions
and<00:03:12.879> you<00:03:13.540> can<00:03:13.720> even<00:03:13.870> get<00:03:14.170> them<00:03:14.349> in<00:03:14.530> the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
and you can even get them in the

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:16.500 
and you can even get them in the
crucible<00:03:15.129> that's<00:03:15.730> how<00:03:15.849> you<00:03:15.909> can<00:03:16.090> get<00:03:16.180> motes<00:03:16.420> of

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
crucible that's how you can get motes of

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.659 
crucible that's how you can get motes of
light<00:03:16.569> but<00:03:17.049> the<00:03:17.230> main<00:03:17.530> way<00:03:17.889> you<00:03:17.949> get<00:03:18.310> motes<00:03:18.519> of

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:18.669 
light but the main way you get motes of

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:20.819 
light but the main way you get motes of
light<00:03:18.730> and<00:03:19.150> pretty<00:03:19.930> much<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.410> way<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.590> can

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
light and pretty much the way you can

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:23.569 
light and pretty much the way you can
get<00:03:20.949> them<00:03:21.069> automatically<00:03:21.730> is<00:03:22.060> kind<00:03:22.989> of

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:23.579 
get them automatically is kind of

00:03:23.579 --> 00:03:26.009 
get them automatically is kind of
convoluted<00:03:24.579> so<00:03:25.030> I'll<00:03:25.180> explain<00:03:25.480> it<00:03:25.629> right<00:03:25.750> here

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
convoluted so I'll explain it right here

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:28.199 
convoluted so I'll explain it right here
so<00:03:26.260> at<00:03:26.379> level<00:03:26.680> 20<00:03:27.040> we<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.519> that<00:03:27.760> you<00:03:27.879> no

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:28.209 
so at level 20 we know that you no

00:03:28.209 --> 00:03:30.240 
so at level 20 we know that you no
longer<00:03:28.239> gain<00:03:29.019> levels<00:03:29.500> normally<00:03:30.010> through

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:30.250 
longer gain levels normally through

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.909 
longer gain levels normally through
experience<00:03:30.849> however<00:03:31.690> you<00:03:32.349> still<00:03:32.409> have<00:03:32.799> an

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:32.919 
experience however you still have an

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:36.270 
experience however you still have an
imaginary<00:03:33.489> bar<00:03:33.970> that<00:03:34.389> counts<00:03:34.840> every<00:03:35.079> time<00:03:35.949> you

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:36.280 
imaginary bar that counts every time you

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.420 
imaginary bar that counts every time you
gain<00:03:36.609> experience<00:03:36.639> and<00:03:37.480> so<00:03:38.349> that<00:03:38.769> imaginary

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
gain experience and so that imaginary

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:41.789 
gain experience and so that imaginary
bar<00:03:39.790> every<00:03:40.389> time<00:03:40.629> it<00:03:40.780> fills<00:03:41.049> up<00:03:41.260> like<00:03:41.620> you

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
bar every time it fills up like you

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.569
