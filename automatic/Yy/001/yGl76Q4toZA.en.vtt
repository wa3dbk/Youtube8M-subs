they're going to stream that too so
if<00:02:11.750> you're<00:02:11.900> interested<00:02:12.350> in<00:02:12.500> that<00:02:13.060> you<00:02:14.060> can

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:14.210 
if you're interested in that you can

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.180 
if you're interested in that you can
just<00:02:14.390> go<00:02:14.510> to<00:02:14.540> their<00:02:14.720> stream<00:02:15.050> on<00:02:15.260> the<00:02:15.470> on<00:02:16.100> the

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
just go to their stream on the on the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:18.280 
just go to their stream on the on the
tenth<00:02:16.700> and<00:02:17.000> it's<00:02:17.600> just<00:02:17.840> the<00:02:17.960> stream<00:02:18.170> they've

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:18.290 
tenth and it's just the stream they've

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:21.160 
tenth and it's just the stream they've
been<00:02:18.440> using<00:02:18.470> for<00:02:19.010> you<00:02:19.580> know<00:02:19.700> the<00:02:19.990> 15<00:02:20.990> prestige

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
been using for you know the 15 prestige

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
been using for you know the 15 prestige
live<00:02:21.560> stream<00:02:21.920> that<00:02:22.130> they've<00:02:22.310> been<00:02:22.460> doing

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
live stream that they've been doing

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.550 
live stream that they've been doing
which<00:02:22.850> is<00:02:22.880> I<00:02:23.060> think<00:02:23.210> the<00:02:23.690> channel's<00:02:24.230> name<00:02:24.290> is

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
which is I think the channel's name is

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.880 
which is I think the channel's name is
just<00:02:24.770> machinima<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:26.260> so<00:02:27.260> I'm<00:02:27.410> going<00:02:27.740> there

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
just machinima and so I'm going there

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.980 
just machinima and so I'm going there
for<00:02:28.070> that<00:02:28.250> and<00:02:28.640> I'm<00:02:29.060> coming<00:02:29.390> back<00:02:29.510> home<00:02:29.780> on

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
for that and I'm coming back home on

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:31.870 
for that and I'm coming back home on
like<00:02:30.170> the<00:02:30.350> 12th<00:02:30.710> i'm<00:02:30.830> going<00:02:30.980> to<00:02:31.040> stay<00:02:31.250> an<00:02:31.610> extra
