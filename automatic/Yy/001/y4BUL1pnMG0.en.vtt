really kind of hard to explain what
sonic<00:00:29.070> technology<00:00:29.279> looks<00:00:29.789> like<00:00:30.000> so<00:00:30.179> we<00:00:30.300> have

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
sonic technology looks like so we have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
sonic technology looks like so we have
really<00:00:30.720> good<00:00:30.840> animation<00:00:31.769> yes<00:00:32.009> that<00:00:32.189> shows

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
really good animation yes that shows

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
what 30,000 brushstrokes a minute so

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.479 
what 30,000 brushstrokes a minute so
it's<00:00:35.329> 30,000<00:00:36.329> pulse<00:00:36.780> vibration<00:00:37.489> sonic

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
it's 30,000 pulse vibration sonic

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.790 
it's 30,000 pulse vibration sonic
vibrations<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.629> get<00:00:39.930> the<00:00:40.290> food<00:00:40.500> particles

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
vibrations that get the food particles

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.380 
vibrations that get the food particles
that<00:00:41.100> hide<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.820> those<00:00:41.910> little<00:00:42.120> nooks

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
that hide in all of those little nooks

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.790 
that hide in all of those little nooks
and<00:00:42.480> crannies<00:00:42.780> we<00:00:42.930> all<00:00:43.050> know<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.379> have<00:00:43.410> them<00:00:43.710> in

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
and crannies we all know we have them in

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.410 
and crannies we all know we have them in
our<00:00:43.890> teeth<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.340> in<00:00:44.430> our<00:00:44.520> mouths<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.000> then

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
our teeth and in our mouths and then

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:46.580 
our teeth and in our mouths and then
when<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.660> want<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.899> take<00:00:46.110> your<00:00:46.230> healthcare

really in your mouth to the next level

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.020 
really in your mouth to the next level
it's<00:00:48.780> imperative<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.890> try<00:00:50.070> a<00:00:50.190> water<00:00:50.610> flosser

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
it's imperative to try a water flosser

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.000 
it's imperative to try a water flosser
because<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.570> gets<00:00:51.750> between<00:00:52.050> tight<00:00:52.530> teeth<00:00:52.800> on

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
because it gets between tight teeth on

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
because it gets between tight teeth on
top<00:00:53.610> of<00:00:53.820> teeth<00:00:54.030> behind<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.930> tight<00:00:55.140> molars<00:00:55.530> in

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
top of teeth behind the tight molars in

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.770 
top of teeth behind the tight molars in
the<00:00:56.070> backs<00:00:56.309> of<00:00:56.550> teeth<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:56.910> you<00:00:57.239> see<00:00:57.480> how<00:00:57.629> it

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
the backs of teeth and you see how it

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.500 
the backs of teeth and you see how it
gently<00:00:58.079> down<00:00:58.320> below<00:00:59.070> the<00:00:59.190> gum<00:00:59.340> line<00:00:59.370> very<00:01:00.210> hard

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
gently down below the gum line very hard

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.150 
gently down below the gum line very hard
to<00:01:00.600> do<00:01:00.750> with<00:01:00.930> floss<00:01:01.140> or<00:01:01.320> tape<00:01:01.500> so<00:01:01.770> this<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.129> a

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to do with floss or tape so this is a

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.880 
to do with floss or tape so this is a
great<00:01:02.579> alternative<00:01:02.850> to<00:01:03.390> that<00:01:03.629> so<00:01:04.019> if<00:01:04.619> you've

studies which again I could just briefly
say<00:06:04.550> it's<00:06:05.550> proven<00:06:05.820> to<00:06:05.910> be<00:06:06.000> highly<00:06:06.150> effective

00:06:06.379 --> 00:06:06.389 
say it's proven to be highly effective

00:06:06.389 --> 00:06:08.240 
say it's proven to be highly effective
in<00:06:06.930> removing<00:06:07.080> significant<00:06:07.889> amounts<00:06:08.160> of

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:11.850 
and flosser were found to be effective

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:13.640 
and flosser were found to be effective
