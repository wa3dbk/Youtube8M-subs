a little more I guess free in terms of
what<00:02:39.110> it<00:02:39.200> is<00:02:39.260> they<00:02:39.470> do<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.920> so<00:02:40.100> on<00:02:40.220> and<00:02:40.310> so

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
what it is they do and so on and so

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.790 
what it is they do and so on and so
forth<00:02:40.490> but<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.570> fact<00:02:41.750> is<00:02:41.870> is<00:02:42.110> that<00:02:42.140> now<00:02:42.470> you

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:42.800 
forth but the fact is is that now you

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.170 
forth but the fact is is that now you

Woman<00:04:55.990> the<00:04:56.830> defenders<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.340> think<00:04:57.580> for<00:04:57.730> a<00:04:57.760> little

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:57.850 
Woman the defenders I think for a little

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.270 
Woman the defenders I think for a little
while<00:04:58.030> but<00:04:58.720> she's<00:04:58.870> not<00:04:58.990> a<00:04:59.050> huge<00:04:59.560> huge<00:04:59.830> villain

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.280 
while but she's not a huge huge villain

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.160 
while but she's not a huge huge villain
but<00:05:00.490> in<00:05:00.700> the<00:05:00.940> age<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.060> Ultron<00:05:01.480> her<00:05:01.690> role<00:05:01.900> is

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170 
but in the age of Ultron her role is

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.320 
but in the age of Ultron her role is
much<00:05:02.530> bigger<00:05:02.860> than<00:05:02.980> it<00:05:03.220> ever<00:05:03.340> was<00:05:03.580> in<00:05:03.880> the

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:04.330 
much bigger than it ever was in the

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.660 
much bigger than it ever was in the
mainstream<00:05:04.480> Marvel<00:05:04.960> Universe<00:05:05.230> so<00:05:05.710> um<00:05:06.040> so<00:05:06.520> that

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
mainstream Marvel Universe so um so that

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.580 
mainstream Marvel Universe so um so that
that's<00:05:06.790> it<00:05:07.030> that's<00:05:07.270> really<00:05:07.600> you<00:05:08.110> know<00:05:08.230> what

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
that's it that's really you know what

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:09.870 
that's it that's really you know what

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
was going on with hanging pan that's why

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.640 
was going on with hanging pan that's why
his<00:05:10.060> death<00:05:10.240> was<00:05:10.420> so<00:05:10.540> significant<00:05:11.110> because<00:05:11.260> it

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:11.650 
his death was so significant because it

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:13.950 
his death was so significant because it
led<00:05:12.160> to<00:05:12.190> the<00:05:12.430> death<00:05:12.610> of<00:05:12.730> the<00:05:12.850> or<00:05:13.150> to<00:05:13.300> the<00:05:13.360> end<00:05:13.780> of
