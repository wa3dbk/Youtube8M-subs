00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:08.220
 welcome to another 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:10.590
 Must start this week is turning 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.200
 everything to be spellbound around stop 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:15.619
 Suspensions etc started doing this 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.119
 pretend that is because now 

00:00:15.619 --> 00:00:20.970
 persistent toxic behavior 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:23.550
 all in solo crew for four games 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.050
 the lcs removed and yes tackle 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.230
 the witness shot behavior means he is 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 banned in over 70 percent of his games 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.960
 That's why the last one has been allowed to do so now 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.820
 week so week new 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:34.620
 with game will not compete and also 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.480
 the first two play offs do not play 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.320
 so much for the playoffs 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.700
 to qualify 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.390
 that, of course, a bitter setback for 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.800
 gospel hd cam will have to be some 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.570
 maybe this name will say something 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.430
 but not guaranteed as adi carey 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.440
 he used to be super hot in the old days 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.840
 crew the with lena and should now 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.460
 maybe the supporter for the 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.170
 Copenhagen must be but actually 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.760
 is not an adi kemmer at all 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.680
 Of course that's very annoying for gamer 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.539
 reduces their playoff chances and also 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.730
 your chances are tremendous 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.189
 but forgive is just like already 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:06.780
 mentioned very toxic and as a star 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.340
 Players as pro players are easy 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.260
 a role model should be at least one 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 because you have to mention it also exists 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.770
 a little curse just a hopeless one 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.509
 if you are a toxic player 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.070
 then you become very well known 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:18.900
 very often report without really in the 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.430
 play tactical because there 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.450
 once you've pissed off someone 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.610
 then he will not be the next ten 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.439
 twenty games which level reports 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.060
 and yes of course there is the question how 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.320
 these 70 percent have come about 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.390
 but have further said even the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.920
 manually looked up the games and that 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:34.140
 award a toxic player in solo 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.939
 and sometimes even in the proteins 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.740
 is not exactly unknown as well 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.689
 suspended for an indefinite period 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.479
 So far, the show is with longer of 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.180
 pidas, however, not because of toxic 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.549
 but just because of that be toxic but 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.979
 because of losses there are now apparently 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:52.619
 chat logs come to light the 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.070
 have revealed that he is his manager for 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.170
 have made a few thousand dollars 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.399
 and yes, of course, I have to be strict 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.570
 against the rules question is now 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.060
 Of course, as already mentioned 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.560
 how long he will be banned because there 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.210
 so far no tangible evidence 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.649
 are present with chat logs 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.179
 but actual hand know when I 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.160
 then of course 100 percent sure 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.050
 be before you speak such a wan 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.120
 because even for cvp could 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.890
 that the playoffs are a lot 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.510
 worsen or make it more difficult 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.130
 and especially with jappy is also the 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.570
 definitely given world champs 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.690
 they are a very good one in circulation 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.980
 even with tsm and could 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.260
 these also already several times conquer that 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.850
 means we could unfortunately because of 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.770
 such a stupid action a team 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.760
 less with wolf opportunities see one 

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.440
 other players will be the 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.720
 Do not see it again next week 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:38.070
 the adrien will be the supporter of 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:39.810
 Pipi now has its temporary 

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.980
 resignation because he is with his 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:41.580
 own performance not satisfied because 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.140
 cetera 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.970
 and although they now have a five 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:46.740
 Games wind street had so many 

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.820
 have also wondered and have 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.140
 actually said that he is pretty good 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:50.580
 but has done well for him 

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.350
 this was not enough 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.940
 that's why he will play to others now 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.140
 the precedence let who however the 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.560
 the newest board is not yet 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:57.390
 known 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.410
 Tsm also seems to have some problems too 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.060
 but not all around 

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.710
 player but around the coach loco 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.170
 Docu is now on his assignment 

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:06.090
 initially exempted from reginald 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.770
 if not the cash position itself 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:09.630
 However, with Luke continue to take over 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:11.640
 to perform on the stagecoach 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.680
 there was apparently internal problems 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.780
 then it was explained that a coach 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.160
 do not serve as authoritarian persons 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.230
 should then always say that has the 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.760
 central but just conversations stimulate 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.190
 should and during the conversations between tsm 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.500
 Seems well loco do co and box the 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.660
 to have been the only one 

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.040
 have ever talked and logo magnifier 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:30.780
 is responsible for this quasi this 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.310
 conversations between all team members 

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:33.989
 to uphold and that seems so 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.320
 not really successful 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.520
 to have 

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.230
 but I strongly assume that 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.580
 only temporarily with the logo goes 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:40.020
 in many circles as very very good 

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:41.850
 coach last but not least have it now 

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:43.110
 the esl championship semi-finals 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.630
 took place there have now the 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:47.640
 The finalists crystallize this 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.560
 will play gamescom on sunday 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.510
 and that went with 2 0 went 

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:54.450
 monitor enforce the second 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:55.890
 game was very tight and now it works 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.630
 it also made two 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:04:00.390
 went back to enforce popmog so 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.220
 Only against will the matchup be what 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.239
 we were allowed to admire sunday and 

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.860
 Mouse now has her second 

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:05.410
 also occurs at gamescom 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.750
 will you 

00:04:05.410 --> 00:04:09.160
 thursday in double-pack against pkd 

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.600
 Unfortunately, we do not have it 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.370
 but you have to say 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:13.870
 the teams are absolutely deserved in the 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:14.590
 finals and were easy at the moment 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.150
 better than here 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.200
 that was it again with the issue 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.549
 For this week I hope you have it 

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.989
 as always like saying skin 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.989
 in and see you next time
