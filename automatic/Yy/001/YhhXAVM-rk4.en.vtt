00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.210 
begins to twist and pull and here is
where<00:01:15.240> the<00:01:15.630> major<00:01:15.840> damage<00:01:16.290> to<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.560> TMJ<00:01:17.040> is

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
where the major damage to the TMJ is

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:19.969 
where the major damage to the TMJ is
done<00:01:17.430> as<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.360> head<00:01:18.689> is<00:01:19.080> ready<00:01:19.439> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.650> slung

done as the head is ready to be slung

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.060 
done as the head is ready to be slung
forward<00:01:20.869> there<00:01:21.869> is<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.439> reverse<00:01:22.740> curve
