adding any high-performance parts now
the<00:00:19.820> trick<00:00:20.359> is<00:00:20.770> look<00:00:21.770> closely<00:00:22.370> at<00:00:22.880> that<00:00:23.690> bolt

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:24.110 
the trick is look closely at that bolt

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.090 
the trick is look closely at that bolt
holding<00:00:24.950> the<00:00:25.100> wire<00:00:25.370> to<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:26.210> throttle<00:00:27.100> alright

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:28.100 
holding the wire to the throttle alright

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:31.779 
holding the wire to the throttle alright
it<00:00:28.310> is<00:00:28.460> tightly<00:00:28.760> secured<00:00:29.470> against<00:00:30.470> this<00:00:31.070> right

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:31.789 
it is tightly secured against this right

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:34.150 
it is tightly secured against this right
here<00:00:32.059> on<00:00:32.210> the<00:00:32.329> carburetor<00:00:32.870> now<00:00:33.110> what<00:00:33.980> will

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:34.160 
here on the carburetor now what will

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.569 
here on the carburetor now what will
happen<00:00:34.730> if<00:00:34.969> we<00:00:35.660> loosen<00:00:36.170> it<00:00:36.289> up<00:00:36.440> alright<00:00:37.309> first

00:00:37.569 --> 00:00:37.579 
happen if we loosen it up alright first

okay so right now I've tightened it back

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.310 
okay so right now I've tightened it back
all<00:01:46.770> the<00:01:47.010> way<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.610> now<00:01:47.900> let's<00:01:48.900> see<00:01:49.140> what's

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
all the way and now let's see what's

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.520 
all the way and now let's see what's
going<00:01:49.560> on<00:01:49.860> in<00:01:50.540> the<00:01:51.540> carburetor<00:01:52.140> in<00:01:52.410> the

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
going on in the carburetor in the

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
going on in the carburetor in the
throttle<00:01:54.500> notice<00:01:55.500> how<00:01:56.300> the<00:01:57.300> throttle<00:01:57.870> does

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
throttle notice how the throttle does

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.350 
throttle notice how the throttle does
not<00:01:58.200> go<00:01:58.590> all<00:01:58.920> the<00:01:58.950> way<00:01:59.460> through<00:01:59.850> as<00:02:00.030> you<00:02:00.210> can

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
not go all the way through as you can

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.020 
not go all the way through as you can
see<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.900> the<00:02:01.590> air<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.220> little<00:02:02.550> bit<00:02:02.670> blocked

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
see that the air is a little bit blocked

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.109 
see that the air is a little bit blocked
by<00:02:03.630> the<00:02:03.690> throttle<00:02:04.320> now<00:02:05.840> let's<00:02:06.840> loosen<00:02:07.820> this<00:02:08.820> up

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
by the throttle now let's loosen this up

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.800 
by the throttle now let's loosen this up
right<00:02:09.390> now<00:02:09.540> and<00:02:09.750> see<00:02:10.560> what<00:02:11.040> the<00:02:11.190> difference<00:02:11.520> is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
right now and see what the difference is

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:14.210 
right now and see what the difference is
alright<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.050> now<00:02:13.200> I've<00:02:13.320> loosened<00:02:13.590> it<00:02:13.890> up<00:02:14.010> as

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
alright so now I've loosened it up as

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.730 
alright so now I've loosened it up as
you<00:02:14.340> can<00:02:14.370> see<00:02:15.080> now<00:02:16.080> let's<00:02:16.350> look<00:02:16.500> at<00:02:16.650> the

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
you can see now let's look at the

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.810 
you can see now let's look at the
throttle<00:02:17.720> all<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.780> way<00:02:19.260> through<00:02:19.860> we<00:02:20.610> have<00:02:20.790> a

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
throttle all the way through we have a

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:23.030 
throttle all the way through we have a
clear<00:02:21.180> passage<00:02:21.570> of<00:02:21.930> air<00:02:22.260> which<00:02:22.530> means<00:02:22.830> that

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
clear passage of air which means that

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.610 
clear passage of air which means that
the<00:02:23.130> piston<00:02:23.370> will<00:02:24.120> work<00:02:24.330> harder<00:02:24.900> for<00:02:25.110> you<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:25.620 
the piston will work harder for you to

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.210 
the piston will work harder for you to
be<00:02:26.070> happy<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.880> that<00:02:26.990> is<00:02:27.990> the<00:02:28.350> trick<00:02:28.650> to<00:02:29.010> get

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:29.220 
be happy and that is the trick to get

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.830 
be happy and that is the trick to get
your<00:02:29.460> scooter<00:02:29.790> to<00:02:30.000> get<00:02:30.180> faster<00:02:30.600> acceleration

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:30.840 
your scooter to get faster acceleration

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.620 
your scooter to get faster acceleration
and<00:02:31.500> faster<00:02:31.950> speed<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.910> actually<00:02:33.270> increases

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
and faster speed it actually increases

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.940 
and faster speed it actually increases
the<00:02:33.870> speed<00:02:34.110> by<00:02:34.490> maybe<00:02:35.630> 2<00:02:36.630> to<00:02:36.870> 3<00:02:37.170> miles<00:02:37.470> per<00:02:37.710> hour

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
the speed by maybe 2 to 3 miles per hour
