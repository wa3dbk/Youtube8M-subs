00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:06.410
 never wanted to know how they spend the 

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.580
 money your politicians for example which 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:09.530
 It will be difficult against your 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.680
 officials or how much they are worth 

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:14.390
 gifts that will be purchased from deputy or 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.970
 know why your mayor has not repaired 

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.070
 sakai or would like to know any insurance 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:20.690
 does not have that medicine that both 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.230
 you need 

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:28.010
 I'm sorry but I have some bad news 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:31.670
 you will never know they do not want to stop 

00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:33.290
 know and because to see I explain what 

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.640
 has happened in our country these last 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:36.350
 for months before the deputies 

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.300
 approved a law on access to 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.800
 information with big speech and 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.980
 saying that listening to the people 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:45.559
 the famous layne staley had been 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.330
 worked for more than 8 years since 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:49.010
 civil society and guaranteed that 

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.840
 we knew how they were driving 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.160
 our taxes and they were 

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:53.930
 doing with it our 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:55.370
 officials why nobody creates a 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.540
 institute whose members were going to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.690
 make sure that you are me the 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:01.570
 information and mine 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:03.820
 but guess what happened first or the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:09.080
 deputies nor the president assigned the 

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:12.140
 budget that he himself made 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:13.940
 to reject all the candidatures that 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.520
 civil society did to integrate the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.530
 Institute 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.049
 then as there is no institute that 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.429
 guarantee our right denied us 

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:22.890
 all kinds of information of type of 

00:01:20.429 --> 00:01:24.750
 information for example how much do you spend 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.579
 House presidency advertising or by 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.579
 example how much is enough for the assembly in 

00:01:26.579 --> 00:01:31.469
 gifts or works of art and everything to weigh 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.390
 that this information should be 

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:35.280
 available without the videos and that's not 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.280
 it's like the information officers 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.959
 that if things did well 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:42.240
 they wrote until the room what 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.360
 constitutional I say that they are 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.700
 doing is clear unconstitutional to 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:49.890
 president the valuable rpp and in the 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.899
 assistance already passed two months without 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.450
 man to the institute but they do not know what 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.390
 last the last if it looks like a movie 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.679
 It is simply unacceptable 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.209
 the deputies of the fmln wins and pcn 

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:05.340
 approved a decree for exemption from 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:09.239
 plot is yes yes 

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:11.670
 continues as typical but after 2 

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.910
 the morning a decree that creates a reason 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.750
 more to get with training they call 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.629
 face-to-face security 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.000
 the decree says activities tending to 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:24.239
 guarantee the president's safety 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.060
 of his family and even of former president 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.620
 of the republic and that's not all the 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:30.900
 decree makes the institute can 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.930
 recommend the information that you are 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:36.569
 asking can not force that corrupt 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.819
 to respect your right to know as who 

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:41.400
 says leave the law of access to 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:46.440
 information if you lie so forget 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:49.310
 to know if the whiskey for 100 or 500 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.310
 Dollars 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.209
 of rule or if some day insurance is going to 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.700
 have the medicine I needed 

00:02:55.209 --> 00:03:00.730
 what will he know because these deputies and 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.180
 your president does not want to respect all 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:07.050
 human milk to childhood so I do not 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:07.050
 I'm going to stop fucking 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:17.220
 so he sees it the president puts because 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:20.220
 We are fed up with artists 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.220
 President 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:30.730
 this time the president 22 president 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:37.739
 president president 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:37.739
 bt president of president president 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:41.570
 protect a right
