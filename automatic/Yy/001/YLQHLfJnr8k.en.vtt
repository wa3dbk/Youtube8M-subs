00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 hello you love today I want you 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.460
 show how to center here so left 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:06.270
 so prepared from the ground to 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.010
 preparation ago 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:09.780
 the soya medallions only insist on 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.120
 soya flour and water and have a lot 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.769
 protein and little fat and those of 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.780
 fantastic food is also guaranteed without 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.470
 genetic engineering and yes we start 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.480
 easy at times 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.279
 First, there is the desired 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.109
 Amount of soja medallions in a pot 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.609
 takes so generally always twelve pieces 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.990
 to here for example I was on 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.060
 is prepared to grill 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.810
 then you give something back vegetable stock 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.020
 about 1 tablespoon with the amount of something 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.149
 I also really like tomato sauce 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.649
 and then you add water to that 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.730
 then later when they are soaked 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.500
 have covered 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.450
 you solve the whole thing on the stove 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.100
 boil up and then they look like this then 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.230
 they are not anymore but right 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 nice and soft with water full visit 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.280
 for the next step you need 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.590
 then first two boards or one 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.329
 Potato press that is even better and 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.579
 a 7 and gives her the best 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.620
 the half of the water next to it tilts 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.600
 very important and then you push 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.609
 First of all a bit of the water out 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.140
 only later with the non-boarded 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:06.659
 so difficult is the sucker up 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.549
 really full of water and that 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.380
 pattern out again we get muddy 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:14.400
 and do not suck the marinade well later 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.330
 then you put on your medallions 

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.320
 a board on it is my daddy 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.900
 to show bitter 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.520
 put the second board 2 on it and then 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.140
 he just just expresses that 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.180
 then a little bit at the time 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:29.340
 one side can run and do that 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.479
 I actually around ours once 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.970
 graduation 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.290
 that actually works quite well with the 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.880
 potato press is of course still 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.579
 better then you get me everything he does 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:40.650
 then when they are expressed see 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.720
 because you are relatively thin and 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.030
 nice fibrous as well as meat actually 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.590
 This year he also flesh in 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.850
 next step will be easy 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.680
 I have now not filmed the 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.170
 I'm a teenager to feel with 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.270
 chili pepper pepper some tomato paste 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.799
 salt and curry depending on what's here 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.659
 just works and I make the step 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.170
 not really matter what I out of it afterwards 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.030
 do 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.770
 then i'll show you two more things 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.700
 which I think is great so once it is 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.329
 this one 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.369
 the vegan sauce of hp so these 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:11.430
 barbecue sauce and of those also the 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.599
 the sheep barbecue sauce are because of 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.220
 and from this can be, for example 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.560
 make such spareribs 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.750
 super easy to brush with it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.569
 marinate and fry respectively in the 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.890
 baking oven or for example if 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.190
 you cut the strip and open 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:27.660
 Skewer just does as often grab her 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:29.420
 can you do that on the ball or 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.430
 Just bake in the oven 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:34.140
 This super delicious or like this 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.769
 does it work for me which satÃ© 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.360
 Skew by the simplicity and 

00:02:36.769 --> 00:02:43.110
 then a hard nut sauce plays out of it 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:46.410
 makes and then, for example, quite simple 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:49.130
 so fried as garnish and taste 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.450
 good only important to good seasons 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.130
 or I have breaded that to me 

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:54.750
 happens completely here is also the 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.930
 Consistency of the ds really very 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:00.090
 meat similar or alternatively also 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.849
 if that cuts the little one in so 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:05.370
 Mold of sliced chicken 

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.269
 shredded made in wigan and that 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:08.280
 was also very delicious 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:10.670
 that really means really many 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.230
 possibilities for these solid boys 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:15.709
 Have fun trying it and see you 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:15.709
 next time
