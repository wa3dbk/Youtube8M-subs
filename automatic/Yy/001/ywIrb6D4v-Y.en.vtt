00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.900 

really<00:00:12.599> the<00:00:12.780> big<00:00:13.590> reason<00:00:13.980> why<00:00:14.130> what<00:00:14.519> we<00:00:14.639> wanted

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
really the big reason why what we wanted

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.779

serious<00:00:20.789> answer<00:00:21.000> and<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> fully<00:00:21.510> understand<00:00:22.170> it

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
serious answer and I fully understand it

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.810 
serious answer and I fully understand it
given<00:00:22.590> that<00:00:22.769> this<00:00:23.189> was<00:00:23.430> such<00:00:23.670> an

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
given that this was such an

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.759 
given that this was such an
extraordinarily<00:00:24.269> tough<00:00:24.930> an<00:00:25.140> intense<00:00:25.529> game

extraordinarily tough an intense game

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:27.500 
extraordinarily tough an intense game
and<00:00:26.039> it<00:00:26.130> did<00:00:26.340> not<00:00:26.519> end<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:27.060> your<00:00:27.210> satisfaction

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510

this of you and perhaps even Daniel when
he<00:01:16.110> came<00:01:16.409> into<00:01:16.619> the<00:01:16.770> league<00:01:16.799> or<00:01:17.159> when<00:01:17.280> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
he came into the league or when you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.679 
he came into the league or when you
first<00:01:17.549> came<00:01:17.700> into<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.030> league<00:01:18.180> so<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.450> guess

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
first came into the league so I guess

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.330 
first came into the league so I guess

your first few years in the week why
well<00:02:02.310> I<00:02:02.340> think<00:02:02.640> when<00:02:02.939> you're<00:02:03.060> struggling<00:02:03.360> it's

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
well I think when you're struggling it's

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.230 
well I think when you're struggling it's
it's<00:02:05.170> tough<00:02:05.439> we<00:02:05.619> wanted<00:02:05.859> to<00:02:06.009> stay<00:02:06.729> the<00:02:06.939> the

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:07.240 
it's tough we wanted to stay the the

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.119 
it's tough we wanted to stay the the
waiver<00:02:07.420> has<00:02:07.929> come<00:02:08.229> to<00:02:08.349> the<00:02:08.440> rain<00:02:08.560> control<00:02:08.860> car

waiver has come to the rain control car

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:11.009 
waiver has come to the rain control car
but<00:02:09.340> it's<00:02:09.489> you<00:02:10.060> want<00:02:10.239> to<00:02:10.300> have<00:02:10.390> fun<00:02:10.810> and<00:02:10.929> you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
but it's you want to have fun and you

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:12.930 
but it's you want to have fun and you
want<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.319> succeed<00:02:12.010> in<00:02:12.310> what<00:02:12.400> you<00:02:12.489> do<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.819> we

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
want to succeed in what you do and we

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:14.940 
want to succeed in what you do and we
didn't<00:02:13.269> feel<00:02:13.390> like<00:02:13.450> we<00:02:13.690> had<00:02:13.720> had<00:02:14.260> as<00:02:14.410> a<00:02:14.440> success

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
didn't feel like we had had as a success

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:16.979 
didn't feel like we had had as a success
we<00:02:15.099> wanted<00:02:15.370> to<00:02:15.489> in<00:02:15.940> the<00:02:16.060> start<00:02:16.330> and<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.599> was

00:02:16.979 --> 00:02:16.989 
we wanted to in the start and it was

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:18.509 
we wanted to in the start and it was
really<00:02:17.200> tough<00:02:17.410> but<00:02:17.620> I<00:02:17.709> think<00:02:17.739> like<00:02:18.370> an

00:02:18.509 --> 00:02:18.519 
really tough but I think like an

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:20.670 
really tough but I think like an
acceptance<00:02:18.940> we<00:02:19.690> worked<00:02:19.870> hard<00:02:20.140> and<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:20.349> told

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
acceptance we worked hard and we told

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.110 
acceptance we worked hard and we told
ourselves<00:02:20.800> that<00:02:21.099> we<00:02:21.310> were<00:02:21.670> gonna<00:02:21.730> get<00:02:21.940> better

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
ourselves that we were gonna get better

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.330 
ourselves that we were gonna get better
every<00:02:22.450> year<00:02:22.480> and<00:02:22.840> I<00:02:23.110> think<00:02:23.319> we've<00:02:23.500> done<00:02:24.010> a

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:24.340 
every year and I think we've done a

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:26.130 
every year and I think we've done a
decent<00:02:24.519> job<00:02:24.730> of<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.030> Kevin<00:02:25.629> we<00:02:25.720> were<00:02:25.810> talking

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.140 
decent job of that Kevin we were talking

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.780 
decent job of that Kevin we were talking
earlier<00:02:26.170> about<00:02:26.470> that<00:02:26.680> exchange<00:02:27.160> between<00:02:27.250> Dion

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
earlier about that exchange between Dion

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.550

think that's against you Henrik and he's
looks<00:02:40.480> like<00:02:40.630> he's<00:02:40.780> going<00:02:41.049> at<00:02:41.200> you<00:02:41.349> he's

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
looks like you get the last laugh after

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.740 
looks like you get the last laugh after
scoring<00:02:45.579> the<00:02:45.640> goal<00:02:45.790> and<00:02:46.000> you<00:02:46.090> actually<00:02:46.299> go<00:02:46.599> up

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:50.819 
and talk a little bit of garbage to him
which<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.239> like<00:02:49.450> to<00:02:49.599> see<00:02:49.780> what<00:02:50.349> were<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.590> saying

which I like to see what were you saying
there<00:02:51.040> in<00:02:51.129> that<00:02:51.250> situation<00:02:51.849> you<00:02:51.940> seem<00:02:52.120> a<00:02:52.150> lot

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329 
there in that situation you seem a lot

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:53.759 
there in that situation you seem a lot
more<00:02:52.390> comfortable<00:02:52.959> doing<00:02:53.110> that<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.530> no

00:02:53.759 --> 00:02:53.769 
more comfortable doing that now no

00:02:53.769 --> 00:03:00.449 
more comfortable doing that now no
speaking<00:02:54.730> Swedish<00:02:55.120> I<00:02:55.239> think<00:02:59.160> seems<00:03:00.160> like<00:03:00.340> he's

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
speaking Swedish I think seems like he's

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.610 
speaking Swedish I think seems like he's
always<00:03:00.579> up<00:03:00.940> against<00:03:01.329> against<00:03:02.049> our<00:03:02.170> line<00:03:02.379> and

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
always up against against our line and

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.250 
always up against against our line and
it's<00:03:03.340> a<00:03:03.430> lot<00:03:03.579> of<00:03:03.610> tough<00:03:03.790> ballots<00:03:04.239> and<00:03:04.450> that's

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.260 
it's a lot of tough ballots and that's

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.770 
it's a lot of tough ballots and that's
the<00:03:05.349> way<00:03:05.470> it<00:03:05.530> should<00:03:05.709> be<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:06.099> I<00:03:06.790> was<00:03:07.420> like<00:03:07.599> at

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:07.780 
the way it should be and I was like at

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.990 
the way it should be and I was like at
that<00:03:08.379> moment<00:03:08.440> that<00:03:08.829> escalated<00:03:09.190> over<00:03:09.459> he's<00:03:09.700> a

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
that moment that escalated over he's a

net I know it's more complicated than
that<00:04:01.360> but<00:04:01.540> is<00:04:01.990> that<00:04:02.200> at<00:04:02.470> the<00:04:02.650> crux<00:04:02.860> of<00:04:03.040> it

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:03.340 
that but is that at the crux of it

that but is that at the crux of it
well<00:04:04.030> that's<00:04:04.210> part<00:04:04.420> of<00:04:04.510> it<00:04:04.660> I<00:04:04.720> think<00:04:04.990> I

00:04:05.070 --> 00:04:05.080 
well that's part of it I think I

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.380
