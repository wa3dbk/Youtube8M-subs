00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:06.829 

by<00:00:05.670> virtue<00:00:05.730> of<00:00:05.970> the<00:00:06.089> guys<00:00:06.240> we're<00:00:06.480> riding<00:00:06.750> them

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
by virtue of the guys we're riding them

every bike in the world taught is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:10.280 
every bike in the world taught is
incredibly<00:00:08.849> fast<00:00:09.150> but<00:00:09.240> I<00:00:09.540> think<00:00:09.990> that<00:00:10.080> very

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
incredibly fast but I think that very

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.810 
incredibly fast but I think that very
few<00:00:10.559> of<00:00:10.620> them<00:00:10.769> look<00:00:10.920> as<00:00:11.040> fast<00:00:11.309> as<00:00:11.490> this<00:00:11.610> that's

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:11.820 
few of them look as fast as this that's

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.480 
few of them look as fast as this that's

Felipe's yield bears BMC time machine

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.120 
Felipe's yield bears BMC time machine
tmro<00:00:15.360> one<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.080> if<00:00:16.410> you<00:00:16.529> think<00:00:16.800> that<00:00:16.920> it<00:00:17.010> looks

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
tmro one and if you think that it looks

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.890 
tmro one and if you think that it looks
striking<00:00:17.609> like<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.789> time<00:00:18.060> trial<00:00:18.240> bike<00:00:18.420> that's

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
striking like a time trial bike that's

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.200 
striking like a time trial bike that's
because<00:00:19.260> it<00:00:19.529> is<00:00:20.010> pretty<00:00:20.310> much<00:00:20.460> an<00:00:20.699> exact<00:00:21.000> copy

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
because it is pretty much an exact copy

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.359 
because it is pretty much an exact copy
of<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.570> BMC<00:00:21.869> time<00:00:22.260> trial<00:00:22.470> bike<00:00:22.650> saved<00:00:23.100> for<00:00:23.279> the

seat stays which is slightly narrower

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.080 
seat stays which is slightly narrower
and<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.980> fact<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.310> it's<00:00:26.519> got<00:00:26.670> vertical

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
and the fact that it's got vertical

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.910 
and the fact that it's got vertical

stands for Road that's how you tell the

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:34.760

difference<00:00:33.270> aside<00:00:34.140> from<00:00:34.320> the<00:00:34.410> incredibly

notable<00:00:37.050> on<00:00:37.170> this<00:00:37.290> bike<00:00:37.469> are<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.860> brakes<00:00:38.100> the

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
notable on this bike are the brakes the

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.209 
notable on this bike are the brakes the
brakes<00:00:38.879> are<00:00:39.300> fully<00:00:39.660> concealed<00:00:40.290> which<00:00:40.890> means

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
brakes are fully concealed which means

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:43.190 
brakes are fully concealed which means
that<00:00:41.489> they're<00:00:41.760> difficult<00:00:41.940> to<00:00:42.239> back<00:00:42.629> off<00:00:42.899> if

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that they're difficult to back off if

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.119 
that they're difficult to back off if
you<00:00:43.320> need<00:00:43.440> a<00:00:43.500> wheel<00:00:43.620> change<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.070> the

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
you need a wheel change but the

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.440 
you need a wheel change but the
mechanics<00:00:44.520> say<00:00:44.670> they're<00:00:44.820> set<00:00:45.090> so<00:00:45.300> you<00:00:45.390> can

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
mechanics say they're set so you can

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:47.360 
mechanics say they're set so you can
remove<00:00:45.719> a<00:00:45.780> wheel<00:00:45.960> but<00:00:46.230> apart<00:00:47.129> from<00:00:47.190> looking

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:47.370 
remove a wheel but apart from looking

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:49.090 
remove a wheel but apart from looking
really<00:00:47.700> cool<00:00:47.850> improve<00:00:48.539> the<00:00:48.660> aerodynamics

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
really cool improve the aerodynamics

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:52.250 
really cool improve the aerodynamics
ride<00:00:50.100> much<00:00:50.430> faster<00:00:50.910> we<00:00:51.690> took<00:00:51.809> a<00:00:51.870> look<00:00:52.020> at<00:00:52.140> the

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
ride much faster we took a look at the

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.020 
ride much faster we took a look at the
weight<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.680> your<00:00:52.739> bears<00:00:53.129> bike<00:00:53.340> and<00:00:53.579> it<00:00:53.640> came<00:00:53.820> in

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
weight of your bears bike and it came in

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.069 
weight of your bears bike and it came in
at<00:00:54.210> 7.5<00:00:55.199> 75<00:00:55.800> kilograms<00:00:56.280> which<00:00:56.430> is<00:00:56.510> around<00:00:57.510> 700

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
at 7.5 75 kilograms which is around 700

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
at 7.5 75 kilograms which is around 700
grams<00:00:58.530> over<00:00:58.829> the<00:00:58.920> UCI<00:00:59.250> weight<00:00:59.579> limit<00:00:59.850> so

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
grams over the UCI weight limit so

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.240 
grams over the UCI weight limit so
that's<00:01:00.719> quite<00:01:01.050> a<00:01:01.109> weight<00:01:01.379> penalty<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.949> go<00:01:02.070> for

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
that's quite a weight penalty to go for

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.290 
that's quite a weight penalty to go for
something<00:01:02.399> this<00:01:02.550> aerodynamic<00:01:02.820> but

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
something this aerodynamic but

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.080 
something this aerodynamic but
presumably<00:01:03.719> on<00:01:03.870> a<00:01:03.899> flatter<00:01:04.229> faster<00:01:05.010> stage<00:01:05.280> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
presumably on a flatter faster stage the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.880 
presumably on a flatter faster stage the
