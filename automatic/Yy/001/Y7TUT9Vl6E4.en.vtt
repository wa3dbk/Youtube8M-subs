00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:07.980
 clear jeans yes yes figure made by 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:10.260
 all my friends this figure no or if 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.700
 this one is cool this wey the dough 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.820
 pressure they quote they titrate more so that 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.070
 see 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:16.390
 if I tell you those figures are very 

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:17.890
 but very well done 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:21.550
 Of course they have their problems 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.310
 mistakes and horrors but because you want 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.560
 They are forgiven the figures of chivas 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:29.320
 who already saw it, they looked at it but not 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:31.150
 least we can on the face that has already 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.699
 I looked at him already admired him we're going to 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.769
 start with the video the articulation that 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:39.460
 has this boludo macayo t el 

00:00:35.769 --> 00:00:41.190
 apocalypse as his head was made 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.969
 above 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:49.170
 until down there more rolling clear that 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.940
 Yes, of course I do something that if I do not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 agreement is the weak point of apocalypse 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.079
 master the little hole in the back is the 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:00.239
 weak point truth I do not know why but 

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:02.879
 I think I think like I remember or 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:08.159
 like I want to believe it 's the point of 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:11.159
 good view if your arms rotate I say 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.190
 that if you turn them 360 but the shoulder pads 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.679
 it stops him and joints get on a 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:21.649
 articulation point on your elbow 360 the 

00:01:16.679 --> 00:01:23.610
 doll has a joint in the thumb and 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.310
 individual articulation on the finger 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:30.799
 index and articulation in the other fingers 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.930
 has articulation, I 'm going to call it the 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.549
 ochentera guide articulation in the 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.230
 torso because it feels like it has 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:40.920
 a league in here 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.100
 and she feels like she has a league 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 Peruvian joints her waist the 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.130
 articulation this week is a bit 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.210
 different because good the position of 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.570
 the two are different you can 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.570
 to appreciate 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:57.860
 you have decoration on the thumb the rest 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:02:00.380
 at hand 360 like these little machines 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.420
 they remove does not have the point that they 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:05.000
 Peruvian removed can also take off 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.360
 water does not stay there pretty nice to me 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.410
 wished that it has to 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.450
 it was painted as well as running 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:14.910
 silver because it can be 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.710
 It is the symbol of the apocalypse 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:19.770
 the bolt joint and right now in its 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:22.380
 legs and in the joint in your thigh 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.690
 and how can you see two points 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:27.450
 joints in the knee 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.830
 it has articulation in the foot it does 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.980
 back he does it up there in front 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.510
 and they have degrees here friends all the 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.690
 articulation that has all the 

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:44.270
 articulation that really needs this 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.270
 is he is not beaten us now 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:52.710
 It's good because you have this Thursday and 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.540
 all marble collections lines way 

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:56.700
 As I always say, I consider this one 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.980
 also they raise and unexamined quote 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.740
 so according to its weight it became large and 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.740
 Well, I say that looks good like that 

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:08.460
 well the figures I say is my opinion 

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:09.990
 now the most important question how much 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.940
 is what you would pay how much more 

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:14.450
 you would pay for this figure talking to 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:19.560
 friends on facebook, they tell me that in 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:24.240
 quetzales is very expensive in pesetas in 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:26.760
 euros is much more expensive and in pesos 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.130
 Chilenos is the cheapest in Mexico 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:33.890
 He speaks talking with possess and with the book 

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:33.890
 so you know all 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.150
 in a number but many here on youtube 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:43.210
 He told me that he bought a figure like that 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.910
 of apocalypse in 1500 pesos I said 

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:48.820
 good that feels pendejadas I pay a lot 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:50.320
 by that figure I say that this figure 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:52.600
 it is not like that 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:56.350
 when much when much, about 700 pesos 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:01.120
 but that 's when mothers strikes 

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:03.670
 You bastard like that but it did not work, do not waste 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.160
 thousand pesos a figure is beautiful is 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:08.650
 adorable and pure sensuality with that 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.020
 bastard but neither is it either 

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:13.060
 so the handsome dude assist them 

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:15.730
 bullshit is handsome and everything but 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.840
 it's not worth it no no no no no no 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:20.889
 1500 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:24.400
 now that if it were the jungle bibliophile 

00:04:20.889 --> 00:04:27.219
 something else would be ironically on ebay 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.529
 this one is more expensive than the bar version 

00:04:27.219 --> 00:04:31.719
 this is the version this one 

00:04:29.529 --> 00:04:33.699
 is with him like 40 dollars with 

00:04:31.719 --> 00:04:37.300
 trainers with a lot this can you 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:41.080
 cost from 60 to 60 so the black bar 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.960
 it costs you like 119 120 but then I 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:47.409
 I consider that something sad and 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.069
 ironic friends thank you very much for 

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:50.069
