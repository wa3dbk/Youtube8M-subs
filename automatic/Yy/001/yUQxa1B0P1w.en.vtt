00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 turn from that diamond ere here what 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.970
 we have if we are going to play this game in 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.859
 carrier 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.559
 in fact the diamond camouflage me when 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:13.049
 when it was learned that the diamond camouflage 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.030
 it was a camouflage hidden in quotes 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.500
 because you already know that you can not take the 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.390
 camouflage of mantel unless you have 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.430
 the gold camouflage of all snipers does not 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.080
 Well, I thought it was going to be a 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.750
 camouflage to me when they made me 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.400
 Diamond I myself do not know anything I did not 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.289
 imagined as well as how is this 

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.090
 because I'm extremely ugly I do not like the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:31.679
 diamond camouflage I was one of the 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.710
 first unlock me the first one in 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.630
 upload it to youtube to get me the 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.210
 diamond camouflage but then in fact 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.219
 I buy the rest of payment with 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:46.010
 lazy payment because the camouflage 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:48.969
 diamond I find ridiculous ugly I do not know 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.410
 and me when when it was known about 

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:55.489
 diamond camouflage I imagined it in plan 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:57.140
 it was made of glass, so it does not have 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.699
 nothing to see but when they said the 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.039
 diamonds I imagined it in plan 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.649
 was going to be a weapon that when I put that on 

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.360
 camouflage me to see the weapon as well 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.430
 as a transparent medium not then in a 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.039
 tone so blue or transparent in plan that 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.840
 suffer that it seems if ice something like that 

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:13.940
 it was me with what the idea I had 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.610
 when it was learned about the ones with flash 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.350
 and then it was done and it's already for this 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.030
 for this he killed me in taking out the 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:23.200
 camouflages to be a camouflage that 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.200
 it is I do not know 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:29.580
 what heavy thorns tastes colors and 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:31.680
 people who like diamond camouflage 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.100
 I 'm more the fact of taking out what the 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.520
 having him because I do not go I 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.520
 to equip 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.210
 Well, here are the dead people 

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:54.229
 I like this site in 23 60 tica in 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:57.880
 in front of the long red arrow 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:57.880
 let's go interesting not know s 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:05.250
 and breathing 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.250
 and he killed the green arrow and he 's 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.250
 to look at the other spot 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.880
 all your being even if 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.400
 partial I really like this 

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:25.180
 sniper although it's hard to get out 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.180
 things with this shit 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:32.030
 or partner 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.690
 I have here my cat is biting me 

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.690
 the faithful point son of a bitch 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.079
 to recharge the ones that are coming out 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.079
 ok I know 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:53.489
 if we go, I shot almost what better 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:55.330
 bastard like and twice cats god 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.970
 let me let me 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.450
 as already look for me the intention that the 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.450
 answer 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.629
 in the background or sets 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.430
 I keep maintaining the same they have to 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:13.230
 being there in the corner the limit 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.230
 that comes from pump 

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:19.530
 at the top that we already have the shots 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.850
 faraway true this map is also very 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.630
 good for far shots are not going to 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.740
 stay there because they have put you 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.330
 very much green arrow 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.330
 so they're going to come out here from behind 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.560
 when he achieved that triumph of dead 

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.560
 here in the middle 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:45.080
 or more stolen 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.080
 steals me a little 

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:56.080
 where are you going to come out uncle you are not 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:56.080
 breaking maybe right here yes 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.910
 breaking a lot the pound my classmates 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:14.190
 to load the left and another in the 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.190
 that kills me aduriz 

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.480
 everyone in their minds 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:23.789
 peeling halo 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:23.789
 trichet 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.710
 and they forgive him centex 

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.760
 there is not the other one who was around here 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.980
 contending rather the table uncle go to 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.770
 take for god ass that disobedient was 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:45.840
 in fulfilling them 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.060
 I did not want I did not want to hit people 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:50.750
 he wanted that sense of continuing to make him a 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.750
 silent but 

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:56.980
 but good 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:03.949
 this has been the diamond episode with 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.229
 the dcr we have two the ballista that goes 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:08.870

00:05:06.229 --> 00:05:10.310
 be the last ok 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:13.370
