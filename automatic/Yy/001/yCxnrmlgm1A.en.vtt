smaller in that respect and each person

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.770 
smaller in that respect and each person
has<00:00:39.719> their<00:00:40.440> own<00:00:40.730> role

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.390 

there<00:00:45.320> was<00:00:45.470> my<00:00:45.620> call<00:00:45.860> to<00:00:45.980> bring<00:00:46.130> in<00:00:46.310> the

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
there was my call to bring in the

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.190 
there was my call to bring in the
sprinters<00:00:46.820> I've<00:00:47.090> seen<00:00:47.480> them<00:00:47.630> on<00:00:47.720> the<00:00:47.780> road<00:00:48.020> and

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:48.200 
sprinters I've seen them on the road and

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:50.260 
sprinters I've seen them on the road and
I<00:00:48.320> think<00:00:48.380> in<00:00:48.980> our<00:00:49.190> business<00:00:49.640> our<00:00:49.940> brand

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:50.270 
I think in our business our brand

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.630 
I think in our business our brand
recognition<00:00:50.840> is<00:00:51.200> the<00:00:51.470> quality<00:00:52.400> of<00:00:52.430> work<00:00:52.610> that

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
recognition is the quality of work that

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.900 
recognition is the quality of work that
we<00:00:52.910> do<00:00:53.090> I<00:00:53.360> think<00:00:53.900> the<00:00:54.500> Sprinter<00:00:54.980> has<00:00:55.489> a<00:00:55.520> brand

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:55.910 
we do I think the Sprinter has a brand

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.150 
we do I think the Sprinter has a brand
recognition<00:00:56.420> of<00:00:57.230> the<00:00:57.500> service<00:00:57.680> and<00:00:58.100> the

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
recognition of the service and the

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.240 
recognition of the service and the
quality<00:00:58.580> so<00:00:58.790> it's<00:00:58.970> kind<00:00:59.270> of<00:00:59.360> that<00:00:59.510> fit<00:01:00.250> this

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
quality so it's kind of that fit this

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.340
