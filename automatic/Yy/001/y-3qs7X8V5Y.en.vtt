what<00:00:22.540> I<00:00:22.570> hope<00:00:22.899> will<00:00:23.140> happen<00:00:23.320> is<00:00:24.309> that<00:00:24.369> we<00:00:24.820> will

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
what I hope will happen is that we will

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:27.900 
what I hope will happen is that we will
get<00:00:25.090> less<00:00:25.419> on<00:00:25.720> the<00:00:26.020> outside<00:00:26.590> here<00:00:27.040> we<00:00:27.309> put<00:00:27.849> the

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
get less on the outside here we put the

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.700 
get less on the outside here we put the
bumpy<00:00:28.329> track<00:00:28.599> in<00:00:29.009> and<00:00:30.419> because<00:00:31.419> we<00:00:31.599> get<00:00:31.750> a<00:00:32.079> lot

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710

the<00:02:31.950> two<00:02:32.160> bits<00:02:32.430> are<00:02:32.900> your<00:02:33.900> which<00:02:34.320> are<00:02:34.500> swinging

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
the two bits are your which are swinging

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:38.690 
the two bits are your which are swinging
sideways<00:02:35.160> and<00:02:35.730> roll<00:02:36.120> and<00:02:37.250> to<00:02:38.250> get<00:02:38.430> things

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
sideways and roll and to get things

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.580 
sideways and roll and to get things
working<00:02:38.910> properly<00:02:39.330> it's<00:02:39.990> important<00:02:40.560> that

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
working properly it's important that

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:43.730 
working properly it's important that
we've<00:02:40.860> got<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.400> any<00:02:42.060> joints<00:02:42.570> lubricated<00:02:42.840> and

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:43.740 
we've got the any joints lubricated and

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.280 
we've got the any joints lubricated and
that<00:02:44.670> the<00:02:44.790> shock<00:02:45.000> absorbers<00:02:45.540> are<00:02:45.660> working<00:02:46.110> and

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
that the shock absorbers are working and

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.960 
that the shock absorbers are working and
if<00:02:46.680> we<00:02:46.830> move<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.190> boom<00:02:47.340> backwards<00:02:47.850> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
if we move the boom backwards and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.090 
if we move the boom backwards and
forwards<00:02:48.420> you<00:02:48.630> can<00:02:49.110> see<00:02:49.440> them<00:02:49.620> off<00:02:49.770> writing

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
forwards you can see them off writing

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.060 
forwards you can see them off writing
and<00:02:50.610> you<00:02:51.240> can<00:02:51.450> hear<00:02:51.810> the<00:02:52.050> oil<00:02:52.200> moving<00:02:52.680> in<00:02:52.980> the

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
and you can hear the oil moving in the

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.800 
and you can hear the oil moving in the
shock<00:02:53.280> absorber<00:02:53.850> so<00:02:54.000> this<00:02:54.150> is<00:02:54.300> obviously<00:02:54.660> in

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
shock absorber so this is obviously in

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.440 
shock absorber so this is obviously in
good<00:02:54.960> condition<00:02:55.500> to<00:02:56.460> check<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:57.090> the<00:02:57.210> booms

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
good condition to check that the booms

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.710 
good condition to check that the booms
okay<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.410> roll<00:02:58.740> you<00:02:59.490> push<00:02:59.820> the<00:03:00.090> end<00:03:00.240> of<00:03:00.510> the

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
okay and roll you push the end of the

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:04.250 
okay and roll you push the end of the
boom<00:03:01.020> down<00:03:01.350> by<00:03:01.950> foot<00:03:02.280> and<00:03:02.580> then<00:03:03.240> let<00:03:03.420> go<00:03:03.450> and<00:03:03.900> it

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
boom down by foot and then let go and it

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:06.590 
boom down by foot and then let go and it
should<00:03:04.470> come<00:03:04.680> up<00:03:04.740> and<00:03:05.130> subtle<00:03:05.550> horizontal<00:03:06.180> and

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
should come up and subtle horizontal and

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.000 
should come up and subtle horizontal and
you<00:03:06.720> can<00:03:06.870> see<00:03:07.050> from<00:03:07.170> this<00:03:07.410> sprite<00:03:07.680> it's

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
you can see from this sprite it's

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460 
you can see from this sprite it's
looking<00:03:08.310> good
