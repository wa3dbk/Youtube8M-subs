depending<00:02:04.740> upon<00:02:04.830> who<00:02:05.039> you<00:02:05.130> are<00:02:05.280> is<00:02:05.520> either<00:02:05.670> the

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
depending upon who you are is either the

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.270 
depending upon who you are is either the
best<00:02:06.030> part<00:02:06.330> or<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.720> worst<00:02:06.899> part<00:02:07.170> I<00:02:07.500> think<00:02:08.070> it's

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
best part or the worst part I think it's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.190 
best part or the worst part I think it's
the<00:02:08.399> best<00:02:08.519> what<00:02:09.509> you're<00:02:09.600> gonna<00:02:09.720> do<00:02:09.869> is<00:02:10.019> lightly

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
the best what you're gonna do is lightly

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.520 
the best what you're gonna do is lightly
flour<00:02:10.500> your<00:02:10.590> work<00:02:10.709> surface<00:02:12.440> you're<00:02:13.440> gonna

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
flour your work surface you're gonna

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:15.680 
flour your work surface you're gonna
take<00:02:13.769> your<00:02:13.860> pasta<00:02:14.220> dough<00:02:14.370> out<00:02:14.600> and<00:02:15.600> then

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
take your pasta dough out and then

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.030 
take your pasta dough out and then
you're<00:02:15.780> gonna<00:02:15.900> begin<00:02:16.110> to<00:02:16.260> knead<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.470> you're

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
you're gonna begin to knead it you're

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.680 
you're gonna begin to knead it you're
gonna<00:02:17.130> do<00:02:17.310> this<00:02:17.459> by<00:02:17.640> folding<00:02:17.940> it<00:02:18.150> over<00:02:18.209> itself

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:18.690 
gonna do this by folding it over itself

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.720 
gonna do this by folding it over itself
and<00:02:18.959> then<00:02:19.410> using<00:02:19.709> the<00:02:19.800> palm<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.190> your<00:02:20.220> hand<00:02:20.519> to

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and then using the palm of your hand to

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.300 
and then using the palm of your hand to
push<00:02:21.060> into<00:02:21.300> the<00:02:21.420> dough<00:02:21.569> and<00:02:21.810> stretch<00:02:22.140> it<00:02:22.440> all

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.800 
push into the dough and stretch it all
in<00:02:23.580> all<00:02:23.700> this<00:02:23.940> part<00:02:24.150> of<00:02:24.209> the<00:02:24.269> process<00:02:24.480> will

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
in all this part of the process will

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:26.570 
in all this part of the process will
probably<00:02:25.050> take<00:02:25.170> you<00:02:25.290> about<00:02:25.440> five<00:02:25.800> minutes<00:02:25.830> and

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
probably take you about five minutes and

probably take you about five minutes and
you<00:02:26.850> want<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.120> do<00:02:27.239> it<00:02:27.360> until<00:02:27.630> it<00:02:27.690> gets<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.900> nice

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
about six pieces after you've done that

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.539 
about six pieces after you've done that
you're<00:03:01.440> just<00:03:01.620> going<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.799> wrap<00:03:01.980> each<00:03:02.190> one<00:03:02.459> of

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:10.079 
minutes once your dough is rested take

00:03:10.079 --> 00:03:11.599 
minutes once your dough is rested take
one<00:03:10.260> piece<00:03:10.470> out<00:03:10.739> of<00:03:10.769> the<00:03:10.920> refrigerator<00:03:11.430> and

one piece out of the refrigerator and
unwrap<00:03:12.060> it<00:03:12.350> you<00:03:13.350> also<00:03:13.560> need<00:03:13.739> to<00:03:13.799> get<00:03:13.950> your

unwrap it you also need to get your
costume<00:03:14.310> machine<00:03:14.790> set<00:03:14.970> up<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.329> while<00:03:15.660> this

isn't an essential tool it's certainly a

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:19.370 
isn't an essential tool it's certainly a
lot<00:03:18.120> easier<00:03:18.150> than<00:03:18.630> rolling<00:03:18.840> it<00:03:19.019> out<00:03:19.140> and

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
lot easier than rolling it out and

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.500 
lot easier than rolling it out and
cutting<00:03:19.560> it<00:03:19.709> by<00:03:19.799> hand<00:03:20.060> you'll<00:03:21.060> also<00:03:21.239> want<00:03:21.390> to

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:21.510 
cutting it by hand you'll also want to

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:22.970 
cutting it by hand you'll also want to
get<00:03:21.600> a<00:03:21.630> baking<00:03:21.989> sheet<00:03:22.019> lined<00:03:22.350> with<00:03:22.650> a<00:03:22.709> clean

then<00:03:38.270> make<00:03:38.600> sure<00:03:38.750> your<00:03:38.870> pasta<00:03:39.319> machine<00:03:39.650> is<00:03:39.800> set

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
then make sure your pasta machine is set

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.220 
then make sure your pasta machine is set
to<00:03:40.160> its<00:03:40.310> widest<00:03:40.730> setting<00:03:40.970> you're<00:03:41.870> gonna<00:03:41.990> roll

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
to its widest setting you're gonna roll

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
to its widest setting you're gonna roll
this<00:03:42.380> through<00:03:43.180> on<00:03:44.180> this<00:03:44.959> first<00:03:45.260> setting<00:03:45.680> we're

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
this through on this first setting we're

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.980 
this through on this first setting we're
gonna<00:03:46.340> pass<00:03:46.640> a<00:03:46.670> dough<00:03:46.970> through<00:03:47.270> about<00:03:47.540> three

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:47.990 
gonna pass a dough through about three

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:50.140 
gonna pass a dough through about three
times<00:03:48.260> giving<00:03:48.860> it<00:03:48.950> a<00:03:49.010> fold<00:03:49.280> in<00:03:49.430> half<00:03:49.670> or<00:03:49.970> in

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
times giving it a fold in half or in

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.150 
times giving it a fold in half or in
thirds<00:03:50.480> each<00:03:50.810> time<00:03:51.170> and<00:03:51.410> a<00:03:51.709> quarter<00:03:52.040> turn

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:52.160 
thirds each time and a quarter turn

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:56.770 
thirds each time and a quarter turn
before<00:03:52.400> we<00:03:52.580> pass<00:03:52.760> it<00:03:52.940> through<00:03:52.970> again<00:03:55.780> after

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
before we pass it through again after

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:00.640 
before we pass it through again after
we've<00:03:56.900> done<00:03:57.080> it<00:03:57.200> about<00:03:57.470> three<00:03:57.770> times<00:03:59.650> we're

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:00.650 
we've done it about three times we're

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.690 
we've done it about three times we're
gonna<00:04:00.740> start<00:04:01.040> passing<00:04:01.430> it<00:04:01.490> through<00:04:01.520> the

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:01.700 
gonna start passing it through the

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.940 
gonna start passing it through the
machine<00:04:02.170> using<00:04:03.170> progressively<00:04:03.680> thinner

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
machine using progressively thinner

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.990 
machine using progressively thinner
settings<00:04:05.620> so<00:04:06.620> each<00:04:06.860> time<00:04:07.190> you're<00:04:07.580> just<00:04:07.610> going

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:08.000 
settings so each time you're just going

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.979 
settings so each time you're just going
to<00:04:08.060> set<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.810> dial<00:04:09.020> one<00:04:09.680> notch<00:04:09.890> closer<00:04:10.989> in

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
to set the dial one notch closer in

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:14.440 
to set the dial one notch closer in
between<00:04:12.470> it's<00:04:13.010> also<00:04:13.130> a<00:04:13.280> good<00:04:13.370> idea<00:04:13.489> to<00:04:13.760> lightly

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450

may have a recommended thickness but if
it<00:04:31.370> doesn't<00:04:31.550> I<00:04:31.820> usually<00:04:32.150> find<00:04:32.419> that<00:04:32.540> the

your whole sheet rolled out to the

your whole sheet rolled out to the
proper<00:04:40.520> thickness<00:04:41.169> you're<00:04:42.169> gonna<00:04:42.290> cut<00:04:42.530> it

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
proper thickness you're gonna cut it

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.040

into ten to twelve inch lengths you

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:47.920 
into ten to twelve inch lengths you
square<00:04:45.440> off<00:04:45.590> the<00:04:45.740> end<00:04:45.890> first<00:04:46.750> does<00:04:47.750> they<00:04:47.840> have

square off the end first does they have
to<00:04:48.020> be<00:04:48.110> exact<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:48.740> just<00:04:48.979> about<00:04:49.520> normal<00:04:49.790> pasta

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360

to be exact but just about normal pasta
length<00:04:50.570> and<00:04:50.780> then<00:04:50.870> you<00:04:50.990> can<00:04:51.140> use<00:04:51.290> the<00:04:51.440> first

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
length and then you can use the first

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:58.000 
length and then you can use the first
piece<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.220> measure<00:04:52.460> the<00:04:52.669> rest<00:04:52.850> of<00:04:53.060> them<00:04:57.010> and

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
piece to measure the rest of them and

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:59.320 
piece to measure the rest of them and
then<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.340> last<00:04:58.370> piece<00:04:58.790> isn't<00:04:59.090> going<00:04:59.210> to<00:04:59.270> be

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
then the last piece isn't going to be

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.440 
then the last piece isn't going to be
perfect<00:04:59.479> but<00:04:59.930> whatever<00:05:00.320> so<00:05:01.090> then<00:05:02.090> you're

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
perfect but whatever so then you're

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.659 
perfect but whatever so then you're
gonna<00:05:02.540> switch<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:03.140> crank<00:05:03.550> into<00:05:04.550> the

00:05:04.659 --> 00:05:04.669 
gonna switch the crank into the

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:06.370 
gonna switch the crank into the
spaghetti<00:05:05.000> setting<00:05:05.419> there's<00:05:06.140> also<00:05:06.229> a

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
spaghetti setting there's also a

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.840 
spaghetti setting there's also a
fettuccine<00:05:06.710> setting<00:05:07.310> but<00:05:07.430> today<00:05:07.729> we're

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:07.850 
fettuccine setting but today we're

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:10.210 
fettuccine setting but today we're
making<00:05:07.910> spaghetti<00:05:08.740> then<00:05:09.740> all<00:05:09.860> you<00:05:09.950> have<00:05:10.040> to<00:05:10.100> do

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:10.220 
making spaghetti then all you have to do

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.370 
making spaghetti then all you have to do
with<00:05:10.340> these<00:05:10.550> is<00:05:11.000> feed<00:05:11.270> these<00:05:11.479> through<00:05:11.840> one<00:05:12.200> by

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:12.380 
with these is feed these through one by

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.770 
with these is feed these through one by
one<00:05:12.650> and<00:05:12.890> crank<00:05:13.850> them<00:05:14.620> to<00:05:15.620> make<00:05:15.770> spaghetti

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:16.780 
one and crank them to make spaghetti

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:18.580 
one and crank them to make spaghetti
then<00:05:17.780> after<00:05:18.050> you<00:05:18.110> have<00:05:18.229> your<00:05:18.350> spaghetti

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:18.590 
then after you have your spaghetti

00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:21.430 
then after you have your spaghetti
you're<00:05:19.100> gonna<00:05:19.220> put<00:05:19.460> them<00:05:19.580> on<00:05:20.200> to<00:05:21.200> a<00:05:21.229> baking

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
you're gonna put them on to a baking

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.850 
you're gonna put them on to a baking

spread out and dust them with flour on

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.159 
spread out and dust them with flour on
the<00:05:28.610> top<00:05:28.850> because<00:05:29.630> there's<00:05:29.780> still<00:05:29.960> some

00:05:30.159 --> 00:05:30.169 
the top because there's still some

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:31.779 
the top because there's still some
moisture<00:05:30.590> in<00:05:30.680> there<00:05:30.860> and<00:05:31.160> they<00:05:31.280> can<00:05:31.310> stick

00:05:31.779 --> 00:05:31.789 
moisture in there and they can stick

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:34.630 
moisture in there and they can stick
together<00:05:31.970> a<00:05:32.180> little<00:05:32.360> bit<00:05:32.510> afterwards<00:05:33.460> so<00:05:34.460> keep

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
together a little bit afterwards so keep

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.310 
together a little bit afterwards so keep

doing that with all these sheets and

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:37.779 
doing that with all these sheets and
then<00:05:36.500> keep<00:05:36.740> rolling<00:05:37.070> out<00:05:37.190> the<00:05:37.340> rest<00:05:37.520> of<00:05:37.669> your
