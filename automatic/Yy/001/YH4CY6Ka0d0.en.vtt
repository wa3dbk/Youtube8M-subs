00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:36.510 
yellow ball of fire and then I just went

00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:38.540 
yellow ball of fire and then I just went
out<00:06:36.600> I<00:06:36.960> just<00:06:37.380> saw<00:06:37.560> a<00:06:37.590> bunch<00:06:37.770> of<00:06:37.860> flashes<00:06:38.310> out<00:06:38.460> of

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:38.550 
out I just saw a bunch of flashes out of

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.130 
out I just saw a bunch of flashes out of
the<00:06:38.610> corner<00:06:38.910> of<00:06:38.940> my<00:06:39.120> eye<00:06:39.150> and<00:06:39.360> then<00:06:39.780> like<00:06:39.930> a<00:06:39.960> big

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.140 
the corner of my eye and then like a big

00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:42.410 
the corner of my eye and then like a big
bright<00:06:40.350> light<00:06:40.590> and<00:06:40.890> then<00:06:41.040> I<00:06:41.340> was<00:06:41.760> like<00:06:41.850> what

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:42.420 
bright light and then I was like what

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.700 
bright light and then I was like what
was<00:06:42.510> that<00:06:42.690> I<00:06:42.750> figured<00:06:43.200> somebody<00:06:43.380> was<00:06:43.590> taking

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:43.710 
was that I figured somebody was taking

00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:46.130 
was that I figured somebody was taking
some<00:06:44.010> pictures<00:06:44.340> or<00:06:44.520> something<00:06:44.580> and<00:06:45.150> no<00:06:45.900> it<00:06:46.050> was

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:46.140 
some pictures or something and no it was

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:48.470 
some pictures or something and no it was
bigger<00:06:46.350> than<00:06:46.560> that<00:06:46.740> it<00:06:46.860> was<00:06:46.980> in<00:06:47.070> the<00:06:47.190> sky<00:06:47.430> so<00:06:48.180> I

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:48.480 
bigger than that it was in the sky so I

00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:52.910 
bigger than that it was in the sky so I
figured<00:06:49.110> meteor<00:06:51.500> fireballs<00:06:52.500> like<00:06:52.710> that

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:52.920 
figured meteor fireballs like that

00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:55.520 
figured meteor fireballs like that
happen<00:06:53.490> when<00:06:54.000> rocks<00:06:54.690> from<00:06:54.930> outer<00:06:55.170> space

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:55.530 
happen when rocks from outer space

00:06:55.530 --> 00:06:57.530 
happen when rocks from outer space
little<00:06:55.950> chunks<00:06:56.340> of<00:06:56.430> asteroids<00:06:57.000> called

00:06:57.530 --> 00:06:57.540 
little chunks of asteroids called

00:06:57.540 --> 00:06:59.810 
little chunks of asteroids called
meteoroids<00:06:58.020> come<00:06:58.620> flying<00:06:58.980> into<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.580> Earth's

00:06:59.810 --> 00:06:59.820 
meteoroids come flying into the Earth's

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:01.490 
meteoroids come flying into the Earth's
atmosphere<00:06:59.940> and<00:07:00.540> burn<00:07:00.990> up<00:07:01.020> in<00:07:01.350> the<00:07:01.410> Earth's

00:07:01.490 --> 00:07:01.500 
atmosphere and burn up in the Earth's

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:02.840 
atmosphere and burn up in the Earth's
atmosphere<00:07:01.830> it's<00:07:02.280> kind<00:07:02.460> of<00:07:02.490> like<00:07:02.640> when<00:07:02.790> you

00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:02.850 
atmosphere it's kind of like when you

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:04.340 
atmosphere it's kind of like when you
think<00:07:02.880> of<00:07:03.120> astronauts<00:07:03.660> coming<00:07:03.930> back<00:07:04.170> and

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:04.350 
think of astronauts coming back and

00:07:04.350 --> 00:07:06.260 
think of astronauts coming back and
re-entry<00:07:04.710> and<00:07:04.890> there's<00:07:05.010> all<00:07:05.160> that<00:07:05.190> heat<00:07:05.580> same
