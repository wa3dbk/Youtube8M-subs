00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 So keep people and welcome to this 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:06.870
 something else video 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:08.730
 Now you are probably wondering where is this 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.880
 knows landed now and why writes 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.860
 also knows first machine yes I'm up 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:16.250
 the kreft movie server maybe knows 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:18.510
 they are English or French 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:20.430
 youtuber this english minecraft 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.740
 make videos and at the 350.000 but 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.189
 not so partie are already pretty 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:28.140
 big yes so i am here on the server 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.519
 You played a lot here in the past 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.810
 has a bit with the admins 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:32.940
 had more to do but no one has 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.320
 then not so much lust and me 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.770
 Here I have my first right 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.660
 machine built alone 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:42.210
 So I can tell you chronologically 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.070
 tell that virtually the origen video to 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.539
 So white knows my first machine here 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.190
 won sugar cane machine so 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.860
 actually you can say the door with 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.780
 a pressure plate before then came one 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 tractor almost where the slopes so out 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.469
 to go out and knock off the 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.360
 after that came the entrance that opened 

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.379
 but he was totally baffled because of me 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.920
 there not yet checked if that 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.809
 bridgestone as I show now briefly 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.189
 flowing in a circle, so to speak , that's a thing of the past 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.290
 signal and I have this here 

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:10.170
 not checked so have me 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.020
 wonder why raise 1000 and so stop 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.360
 what then and then the next one stands then 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 I built only such small things for a long time 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.600
 and then the right middle school is 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:22.409
 all nonsense because the students in front 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.189
 then york could read places 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:28.170
 Priest totally at sqs in white 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.520
 machine white knows so the whole yes the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:31.470
 I had the idea myself Lukas said 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.090
 This good name is a roulette built 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.619
 this is a russian roulette in 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:39.180
 minecraft style and yes that was one 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.380
 I have a lot of fun and grab 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.420
 I can credit that again determined 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.439
 show the goods just before an event 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 so that on the one hand but have yet 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:48.210
 considered because yes because it's a pity 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.189
 would you have said I want to go here? 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.240
 more slots and so not much anymore 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.850
 timeless etc 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.990
 but no matter was just the beginning now 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.280
 and then I show you first now 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.530
 the technology is not that right now 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:00.810
 colossally awesome but for the first 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.640
 The right playable machine is that 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.200
 not bad you can still here 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.600
 42 mm which I can do a lot here 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.740
 server count so it is unfortunately here 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.860
 not as busy as it used to be 

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:12.180
 So that's put me all the technology 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.200
 I was so little earlier for myself 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:15.120
 gigantic so 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.349
 the whole system is built up 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.239
 at the random system for example 

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:20.280
 russian roulette against me 

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.379
 can play it quite well that is 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:26.330
 still quite quite cheap what 

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:28.500
 I'm going in here makes return 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:31.500
 it had eight voices I can what 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.370
 are so then the old comes there then yes 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.739
 either there is an item there now 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.230
 There were no arrows in there or if so 

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.000
 Quite a cheap system 

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:44.540
 but I'm falling down here now 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.709
 one item came and then I die 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.000
 and it works then it just stops 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:50.010
 So I explain it now exactly 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.540
 You have to play the game yourself as I do 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.130
 So of course I have too 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.620
 the machine is built as it works 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:56.970
 so here can every 3 there must stop itself 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.420
 count down I have no count and 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.370
 should be broken down and then it works like that 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.780
 I'll show you 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.130
 I have to get out of this one is one 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.910
 I might only need benefits 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.670
 even harder then replace I like 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.959
 you do not feel like that, so I'll do it first 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.940
 the arrows in and first the blocks 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:20.639
 out so if I now the button 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:23.700
 press so then you hear the arrow shot 

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:25.049
 there you see the arrow and above it goes 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.400
 light on top the light is there 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:29.310
 nobody has pressed like that 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.600
 but do not cheat and time all 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.850
 because I did not lose that way 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.989
 I now know for manual blog have 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:37.799
 you do not even size it under it 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:39.410
 faster flows com / blog it comes 

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.730
 not so 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:44.310
 i can not dropman plugin 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:47.160
 canned okay because as I said long 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:51.810
 not so good then when I am 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:54.540
 short manual signal so there comes 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.889
 the signal so internet blog flows 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.530
 then to the pressure plate the pressure plate 

00:03:55.889 --> 00:04:03.329
 gives a short signal so now 

00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.090
 signal comes it will rise so 

00:04:03.329 --> 00:04:08.099
 and the number is, and thus is the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.639
 play out then you can do the whole thing 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:13.349
 Then I reset the whole thing 

00:04:10.639 --> 00:04:15.209
 I then private tour so I gave 

00:04:13.349 --> 00:04:16.799
 that would be because they are now 

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:19.430
 it works so i have stop here 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.590
 my reset therefore exactly 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.659
 and then it's just below it on the ground 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:26.700
 he and that works so that he the 

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:28.320
 flipflops all reset quasi 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.640
 the rosette is sitting again this year 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:31.920
 back quasi was a bit here 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.660
 muddles work and keeps that up 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.370
 to end so for the first 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.420
 machine I found that pretty cool 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.590
 honestly and yes that's mine 

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.080
 unfortunately I can give you the first machine 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:45.270
 do not offer a download because I have 

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:46.950
 the asked begged etc 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:50.820
 Unfortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately 

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:52.590
 unfortunately not the map so to speak 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.300
 partly just do not want to give that 

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.440
 also a bit understandable and yes 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.600
 why can so not to 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.490
 download should offer small origin 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.260
 then i can show you here so 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.750
 at the beginning of cars not at all 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:05.340
 I can show you that a bit 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:08.940
 few basics when a rejected knew 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.070
 look really good and here for the 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.810
 For example, I learned my counter 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.850
 that's no fun I've come 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.170
 here because of this server here to 

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.760
 I think I could recognize that mine 

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.350
 name is age ii was the name of 

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.600
 he was pretty good at the redstone 

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:23.040
 I can say that and here I am 

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:26.660
 then so beginner had me so 

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:29.630
 a little bit showed and that was already 

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:31.670
 pretty good the sun store so on 

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:34.740
 random etc 

00:05:31.670 --> 00:05:38.400
 exactly sees report gives 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:41.310
 correct in remembering the earlier that 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:43.740
 here again a random system 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.810
 what also saved design etc 

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:49.110
 that was my attempt next to wool 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.310
 Of course always with wool and yes that was 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:51.900
 I actually know it from here then 

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.310
 can I now pray then can I 

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.440
 again I go back just now 

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:57.420
 all previously saved yet so sat 

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:59.190
 really a long time here because there 

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.150
 was so proud of it I would have had 

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.280
 can not believe it 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.780
 a handle then it has to rebuild 

00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:04.200
 she also guilty in april 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.740
 for this 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:10.830
 one I can tell you briefly went in 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.510
 Frontzeck has really been around for months 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.660
 not changed he looks the same 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:19.590
 always and edgy us just funny so 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:22.860
 creative I wanted him had me once 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:24.660
 earlier I even brought the rp for five 

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:28.640
 dollar or something like that was me 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:28.640
 could build here in creative because I 

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:33.630
 I mean can I get the world back 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:36.630
 I think time I see do not know 

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:39.240
 no matter temporary monastery just in there 

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:40.289
 that could definitely show what that 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:43.289
 because here I can quite times 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:47.849
 his blue ip is definitely there for her 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:50.550
 but can not all on it / picture 

00:06:47.849 --> 00:06:54.659
 okay that's not you can not do it 

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:56.399
 on it all there as well as this carnival 

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.809
 it's just that you are here 

00:06:56.399 --> 00:06:59.369
 register must be on the side wise 

00:06:57.809 --> 00:07:01.289
 had to write proper application 

00:06:59.369 --> 00:07:02.849
 here it gang quasi here is not so 

00:07:01.289 --> 00:07:04.379
 kinderkacke lausanne here are really 

00:07:02.849 --> 00:07:05.460
 only people on the one big application 

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:10.259
 who have also written 

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:12.589
 had to be so therefore asked 

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:14.969
 unfortunately closed 

00:07:12.589 --> 00:07:16.169
 and yes that was nothing to the server me 

00:07:14.969 --> 00:07:17.999
 I hope I liked it 

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:20.520
 that was really my first right 

00:07:17.999 --> 00:07:22.199
 machine edf like this one of mine 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.699
 first prototype of me and me back so 

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.180
 that the final version has from me 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:27.599
 been 

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:29.669
 as I said that's it, I hope the 

00:07:27.599 --> 00:07:32.240
 video and see you next time 

00:07:29.669 --> 00:07:32.240
 already people
