00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:42.220 
concrete pads each one of them took

00:01:42.220 --> 00:02:13.520 
concrete pads each one of them took
about<00:01:42.430> three<00:01:42.760> bags<00:01:43.000> of<00:01:43.180> concrete

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:23.369 

hey<00:02:14.530> use<00:02:14.769> your<00:02:14.799> hoe<00:02:15.099> and<00:02:15.370> scrape<00:02:15.610> it<00:02:15.760> out<00:02:22.379> there

00:02:23.369 --> 00:02:23.379 
hey use your hoe and scrape it out there

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.920 
hey use your hoe and scrape it out there
are<00:02:23.470> eight<00:02:23.620> feet<00:02:24.069> out<00:02:24.340> from<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.849> deck<00:02:25.180> so<00:02:25.900> i

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
are eight feet out from the deck so i

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.559 
are eight feet out from the deck so i
can<00:02:26.379> bring<00:02:26.830> eight<00:02:27.160> foot<00:02:27.519> pieces<00:02:28.090> of<00:02:28.390> lumber

00:02:28.559 --> 00:02:28.569 
can bring eight foot pieces of lumber

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:30.059 
can bring eight foot pieces of lumber
fit<00:02:28.959> in<00:02:29.019> the<00:02:29.080> back<00:02:29.260> of<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.470> truck<00:02:29.680> real<00:02:29.890> nice

00:02:30.059 --> 00:02:30.069 
fit in the back of the truck real nice

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.130 
fit in the back of the truck real nice
so<00:02:30.849> we're<00:02:30.970> going<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.150> expand<00:02:31.510> eight<00:02:31.750> feet<00:02:31.989> out

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
so we're going to expand eight feet out

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.130 
so we're going to expand eight feet out
that<00:02:32.410> way<00:02:32.640> out<00:02:33.640> that<00:02:33.970> way<00:02:34.150> and<00:02:34.420> so<00:02:34.930> on<00:02:35.110> down

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
that way out that way and so on down

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:38.089 
that way out that way and so on down
there<00:02:35.590> so<00:02:35.799> we're<00:02:35.920> going<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.099> get<00:02:36.220> about<00:02:36.989> a<00:02:37.989> a

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
there so we're going to get about a a

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.509 
there so we're going to get about a a
lot<00:02:39.099> more<00:02:40.410> footprint<00:02:41.410> if<00:02:41.500> you<00:02:41.590> will<00:02:41.739> probably

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
lot more footprint if you will probably

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:43.800 
lot more footprint if you will probably
going<00:02:42.760> to<00:02:42.819> have<00:02:42.879> to<00:02:42.940> remove<00:02:43.209> those<00:02:43.420> three

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:43.810 
going to have to remove those three

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:47.280 
going to have to remove those three
trees<00:02:44.170> right<00:02:44.470> there<00:02:44.849> they<00:02:45.849> are<00:02:45.879> going<00:02:46.390> to<00:02:46.480> you

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
trees right there they are going to you

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:48.660 
trees right there they are going to you
know<00:02:47.379> they're<00:02:47.590> obviously<00:02:48.099> the<00:02:48.280> decks<00:02:48.489> going

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
know they're obviously the decks going

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.430 
know they're obviously the decks going
to<00:02:48.730> go<00:02:48.819> right<00:02:49.000> there<00:02:49.239> I<00:02:49.390> don't<00:02:49.840> know<00:02:49.900> what<00:02:50.079> I'll

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
to go right there I don't know what I'll

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.130 
to go right there I don't know what I'll
feel<00:02:50.650> it<00:02:50.680> out<00:02:50.920> as<00:02:51.069> I<00:02:51.160> go<00:02:51.190> but<00:02:52.150> for<00:02:52.329> now<00:02:52.450> the

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:53.140 
feel it out as I go but for now the

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.849 
feel it out as I go but for now the
concrete's<00:02:53.680> poured<00:02:53.879> their<00:02:54.879> level<00:02:55.709> more<00:02:56.709> or

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
concrete's poured their level more or

00:02:56.859 --> 00:03:00.089 
concrete's poured their level more or
less<00:02:56.920> and<00:02:57.459> they're<00:02:58.420> in<00:02:58.540> the<00:02:58.629> line<00:02:58.950> more<00:02:59.950> or

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:00.099 
less and they're in the line more or

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.819 
less and they're in the line more or
less<00:03:00.129> but<00:03:01.120> I<00:03:01.420> made<00:03:01.840> them<00:03:01.959> a<00:03:02.019> little<00:03:02.140> extra<00:03:02.590> big

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:02.829 
less but I made them a little extra big

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:06.150 
less but I made them a little extra big
so<00:03:03.640> when<00:03:03.760> I<00:03:03.790> put<00:03:04.090> these<00:03:04.500> cinder<00:03:05.500> blocks<00:03:05.709> on<00:03:05.920> I

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:06.160 
so when I put these cinder blocks on I

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:07.620 
so when I put these cinder blocks on I
can<00:03:06.430> move<00:03:06.549> them<00:03:06.700> around<00:03:06.819> a<00:03:07.090> little<00:03:07.120> bit<00:03:07.420> more

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630 
can move them around a little bit more

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:10.050 
can move them around a little bit more
so<00:03:07.810> it's<00:03:07.959> not<00:03:08.109> a<00:03:08.170> precise<00:03:08.709> measurement<00:03:09.370> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
so it's not a precise measurement the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.789 
so it's not a precise measurement the
you<00:03:10.569> know<00:03:10.660> they<00:03:10.810> are<00:03:10.930> a<00:03:10.959> little<00:03:11.139> bit<00:03:11.349> larger<00:03:11.470> if

00:03:11.789 --> 00:03:11.799 
you know they are a little bit larger if

00:03:11.799 --> 00:03:14.250 
you know they are a little bit larger if
you<00:03:11.950> take<00:03:12.130> a<00:03:12.160> look<00:03:12.250> at<00:03:12.400> the<00:03:12.579> original<00:03:12.700> ones<00:03:13.260> you

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:14.260 
you take a look at the original ones you

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.720 
you take a look at the original ones you
can<00:03:14.440> see<00:03:14.650> how<00:03:14.889> I<00:03:14.920> made<00:03:15.130> them<00:03:15.250> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.489> bit

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
can see how I made them a little bit

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.620 
can see how I made them a little bit
bigger<00:03:15.940> so<00:03:16.060> I'd<00:03:16.329> have<00:03:16.359> room<00:03:16.900> to<00:03:17.069> adjust<00:03:18.630> so

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:19.630 
bigger so I'd have room to adjust so

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:21.390 
bigger so I'd have room to adjust so
this<00:03:19.870> is<00:03:19.900> going<00:03:20.079> to<00:03:20.139> be<00:03:20.290> a<00:03:20.319> real<00:03:20.560> cool<00:03:20.859> addition

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
this is going to be a real cool addition

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.370 
this is going to be a real cool addition
we're<00:03:22.090> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.269> get<00:03:22.419> the<00:03:22.540> patio<00:03:22.959> or<00:03:23.290> deck

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:23.380 
we're going to get the patio or deck

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:25.370 
we're going to get the patio or deck
added<00:03:24.099> on<00:03:24.220> this<00:03:24.400> side<00:03:24.639> and<00:03:24.819> maybe<00:03:25.000> eventually

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:25.380 
added on this side and maybe eventually

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.770 
added on this side and maybe eventually
tap<00:03:26.380> into<00:03:26.620> the<00:03:26.859> roof<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.220> bring<00:03:27.639> out<00:03:27.849> a<00:03:28.120> shed

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
tap into the roof and bring out a shed

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.159 
tap into the roof and bring out a shed
area<00:03:29.200> so<00:03:29.889> this<00:03:30.040> will<00:03:30.160> be<00:03:30.340> all<00:03:30.720> covered<00:03:31.720> on<00:03:32.019> the

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:32.169 
area so this will be all covered on the

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.690 
area so this will be all covered on the
side<00:03:32.380> here<00:03:33.000> but<00:03:34.000> we've<00:03:34.690> got<00:03:35.430> five<00:03:36.430> of<00:03:36.489> these

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:36.700 
side here but we've got five of these

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.330 
side here but we've got five of these
bad<00:03:37.000> boys<00:03:37.269> and<00:03:37.599> these<00:03:38.230> here<00:03:38.530> are<00:03:38.590> eight<00:03:39.099> feet

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:39.340
