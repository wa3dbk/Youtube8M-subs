00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.900
 good friends today I'm going to teach you a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.629
 new video tutorial with some opus 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.519
 whatever you want to call this time good 

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:20.480
 as several people have already been 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:24.390
 asking how do I make a robot that moves 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.130
 ok to walk or to move in the 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.109
 territory then I have been 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.109
 finding out and getting a little 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:33.270
 model that you buy and arms it 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:35.700
 10 themes 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:39.120
 that moves the whole system then we go 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 to try to simulate this same robot that 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.270
 it's quite simple for this they make a cover 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.610
 legs 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:47.400
 in this case help and leave a single 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.379
 box we tipped it a bit just a 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.120
 little and we cloned that we're going to 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.950
 clear so you have the same degree 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:57.770
 of inclination but in the opposite direction 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:01.860
 the envelope we mount and we add an axis 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.970
 so that it works like a tiger like that 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:08.560
 like a scissor 

00:01:03.970 --> 00:01:11.040
 good now how is the mechanism more or 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.070
 less to the middle part d 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:17.850
 this leg we are going to add a rectangle 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.360
 small in pause of a rectangle 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.330
 small 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.860
 we add and delete now let's do 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:29.640
 what is the mechanism 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.610
 we make a short leg if it makes it very 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.850
 long then it will take a long turn and 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:38.460
 is going to go back to us then that 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.550
 this has been cut and it's coming 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.280
 until the second part 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.610
 and this is what we will become the 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.610
 engine 

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.830
 that there is not very fast because if you do not 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.140
 is going to overturn what I will then place 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.820
 40 suddenly to start in strength 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.979
 complete 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.440
 now we work with the axes that passes 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:01.659
 is still placed as you see they have 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:04.060
 a rare collision that they where 

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:07.510
 place position death is going to collide 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.340
 ugly and it's going to make us all crazy and not 

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.420
 it's going to work for this 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:15.190
 we select this all this 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.540
 and we give him a collision 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:21.269
 and we uncheck and mark 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:22.430
 the letter now now signs should 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:25.219
 function 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.359
 As you can see, it starts to walk 

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:29.180
 they want to see if he's walking 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:31.849
 correctly place a box 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:34.000
 and as you can see already you are approaching 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:34.000
 the 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:39.150
 there they can play with the speed 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.250
 know how they want 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.120
 and well that's all for today is pretty 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.189
 always this walker see him doing in 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.500
 a couple of steps and good if you liked 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:52.750
 comment if you have any 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.720
 idea or something can also comment and not 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:58.080
 forget to rate and suffer many 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:58.080
 Thank you
