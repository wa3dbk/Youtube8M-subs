confident enough in the way you look in

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.159 
confident enough in the way you look in
it<00:03:48.799> right<00:03:49.220> like<00:03:49.459> age<00:03:49.669> doesn't<00:03:49.970> matter<00:03:50.209> no<00:03:50.510> 100%

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:51.169 
it right like age doesn't matter no 100%

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:52.629
