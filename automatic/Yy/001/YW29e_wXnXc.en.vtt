actually turns into a jet pack it's on a

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.340 
actually turns into a jet pack it's on a
Y<00:03:43.970> joint<00:03:44.970> here<00:03:47.420> you<00:03:48.420> just<00:03:48.570> open<00:03:48.959> it<00:03:49.019> up<00:03:49.170> and

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:49.350 
Y joint here you just open it up and

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:52.340 
Y joint here you just open it up and
then<00:03:49.590> spin<00:03:50.010> this<00:03:50.190> around<00:03:51.060> this<00:03:51.600> is<00:03:51.810> actually

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
then spin this around this is actually

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.920 
then spin this around this is actually
really<00:03:52.950> tight<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.950> then<00:03:56.450> you<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:57.630> drop<00:03:57.870> it

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
really tight and then you just drop it

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:01.039 
really tight and then you just drop it
in<00:03:58.140> the<00:03:58.230> back<00:03:58.440> here<00:03:59.600> there's<00:04:00.600> actually<00:04:01.019> a

00:04:01.039 --> 00:04:01.049

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:02.720 
in the back here there's actually a
little<00:04:01.350> hole<00:04:01.590> right<00:04:01.620> there<00:04:01.920> for<00:04:02.370> it<00:04:02.430> to<00:04:02.519> plug

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:02.730 
little hole right there for it to plug

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:06.440 
little hole right there for it to plug
for<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.120> tip<00:04:03.750> to<00:04:03.930> plug<00:04:04.140> into<00:04:05.209> I've<00:04:06.209> got<00:04:06.420> a

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:06.450 
for the tip to plug into I've got a

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:11.589 
for the tip to plug into I've got a
little<00:04:06.750> off<00:04:06.870> kilter<00:04:07.140> here

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:11.599 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:16.099 

it<00:04:12.599> plugs<00:04:12.900> right<00:04:13.019> in<00:04:13.379> and<00:04:14.510> then<00:04:15.510> you<00:04:15.659> just<00:04:15.840> turn

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:16.109 
it plugs right in and then you just turn

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:20.060 
it plugs right in and then you just turn
this<00:04:16.769> like<00:04:16.979> this<00:04:17.190> and<00:04:18.289> I<00:04:19.289> like<00:04:19.500> to<00:04:19.799> just

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
this like this and I like to just

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.310 
this like this and I like to just
flatten<00:04:20.400> it<00:04:20.609> out<00:04:20.729> a<00:04:20.789> little<00:04:21.000> bit<00:04:21.269> and<00:04:22.199> you've

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
flatten it out a little bit and you've

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:26.719 
flatten it out a little bit and you've
got<00:04:22.530> them<00:04:22.710> with<00:04:23.280> a<00:04:23.310> jet<00:04:23.550> pack<00:04:24.680> now<00:04:25.680> the<00:04:26.460> figure

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:26.729 
got them with a jet pack now the figure

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.460 
got them with a jet pack now the figure
actually<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.479> small

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:28.470 
actually is small

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.460 
actually is small
I<00:04:28.500> mean<00:04:28.740> he's<00:04:28.949> short<00:04:29.340> for<00:04:29.759> deluxe<00:04:30.090> but<00:04:31.050> once

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:31.470 
I mean he's short for deluxe but once

00:04:31.470 --> 00:04:35.029 
I mean he's short for deluxe but once
again<00:04:31.650> that's<00:04:32.580> not<00:04:33.000> a<00:04:33.030> bad<00:04:33.330> thing<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:34.039> found

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:35.039 
again that's not a bad thing I found

00:04:35.039 --> 00:04:37.580 
again that's not a bad thing I found
that<00:04:35.220> this<00:04:35.430> figure<00:04:35.699> is<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.300> lot<00:04:36.780> of<00:04:37.110> fun<00:04:37.349> to<00:04:37.560> play

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
that this figure is a lot of fun to play

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.689 
that this figure is a lot of fun to play
with<00:04:37.800> and<00:04:38.310> I<00:04:38.430> mean<00:04:38.639> a<00:04:38.669> lot<00:04:39.060> of<00:04:39.120> fun<00:04:39.919> he<00:04:40.919> doesn't

00:04:41.689 --> 00:04:41.699 
with and I mean a lot of fun he doesn't

00:04:41.699 --> 00:04:43.909 
with and I mean a lot of fun he doesn't
have<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.360> best<00:04:42.539> pose<00:04:42.960> ability<00:04:43.500> in<00:04:43.620> the<00:04:43.710> world

but<00:04:44.430> it<00:04:45.240> doesn't<00:04:45.690> really<00:04:45.810> matter<00:04:46.080> because

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
but it doesn't really matter because

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.029
