00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:36.320
 I do not verse here if you allow me 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:41.850
 show and somewhere there is a copy 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:51.230
 nothing terrible us here nothing means a 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:51.230
 then this mouse is a computer this is our hero 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:57.780
 it means there is 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:59.700
 The control is suitable reds 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.220
 things they make changes to his 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.309
 facial expression for example i mark out 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.110
 this thing and move 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:09.450
 the position of the art does not change 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.740
 each of these controllers is responsible for 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.960
 specific item 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.960
 if we need the character to blink 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:23.220
 allows you to directly close and 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.790
 to open their eyes, and that's u10's this 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:34.680
 thing like that you can move 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:35.369
 goods through perfectly fine everything ok on 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.300
 really 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:43.470
 and here, in principle, everything is so simple 

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:47.280
 the only thing we have is the norm in 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.149
 animators it's one minute down i mean 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.280
 man for the day makes only ours 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.820
 two seconds and this is considered very 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.540
 good work result as well as 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.540
 painstaking 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:04.000
 come in 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:09.060
 there is 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:09.060
 fan tests lubricate us too 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:36.040
 thirst for victory
