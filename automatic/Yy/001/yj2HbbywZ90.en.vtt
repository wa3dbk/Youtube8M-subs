now<00:01:42.570> if<00:01:42.930> we're<00:01:43.590> still<00:01:43.770> having<00:01:43.979> problems<00:01:44.549> with

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:44.700 
now if we're still having problems with

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.010 
now if we're still having problems with
it

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.100 
it
okay<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.799> mirror<00:01:47.159> mounts<00:01:47.939> like<00:01:48.090> it's<00:01:48.990> going

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
okay the mirror mounts like it's going

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.539 
okay the mirror mounts like it's going
to<00:01:49.170> be<00:01:49.259> like<00:01:49.710> this<00:01:50.119> to<00:01:51.119> get<00:01:51.479> the<00:01:52.189> part<00:01:53.189> number

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
to be like this to get the part number

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.319 
to be like this to get the part number
of<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.820> mirror<00:01:54.180> we<00:01:55.020> actually<00:01:55.409> have<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:56.329> remove

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
of the mirror we actually have to remove

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:01.190 
of the mirror we actually have to remove
it<00:01:57.750> from<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.530> mount<00:01:58.740> and<00:01:59.100> then<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.960> part

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:01.200 
it from the mount and then the the part

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.020 
it from the mount and then the the part
number<00:02:01.500> is<00:02:01.649> right<00:02:01.860> there<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.280> 9:05

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
number is right there it's that 9:05

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.140 
number is right there it's that 9:05
number<00:02:03.479> that's<00:02:03.719> what<00:02:03.930> I<00:02:03.960> would<00:02:04.200> need<00:02:04.320> to<00:02:04.500> get

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:05.150 
number that's what I would need to get

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:10.130 
number that's what I would need to get
if<00:02:06.150> if<00:02:07.140> we<00:02:07.320> still<00:02:07.560> need<00:02:07.740> that<00:02:07.920> so<00:02:08.910> I<00:02:09.360> think<00:02:09.539> this

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
if if we still need that so I think this

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.650 
if if we still need that so I think this
mirror<00:02:10.679> it<00:02:11.670> kind<00:02:11.940> of<00:02:12.000> you<00:02:12.209> may<00:02:12.330> have<00:02:12.540> to

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
mirror it kind of you may have to

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.420 
mirror it kind of you may have to
actually<00:02:13.020> even<00:02:13.410> go<00:02:13.530> to<00:02:13.590> the<00:02:13.770> dealer<00:02:14.069> just<00:02:14.250> to

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
actually even go to the dealer just to

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.780 
actually even go to the dealer just to
be<00:02:14.550> sure<00:02:14.790> but<00:02:15.000> I<00:02:15.209> think<00:02:15.569> it<00:02:15.959> kind<00:02:16.110> of<00:02:16.580> twist<00:02:17.580> it

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
be sure but I think it kind of twist it

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.520 
be sure but I think it kind of twist it
to<00:02:17.970> get<00:02:18.120> it<00:02:18.270> off<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.720> then<00:02:18.840> we<00:02:18.900> twist<00:02:19.200> it<00:02:19.319> back

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
to get it off and then we twist it back

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.000 
to get it off and then we twist it back
