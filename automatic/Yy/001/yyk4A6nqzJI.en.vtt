00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.010
 for fifteen years we have invested a lot 

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:11.290
 in an agricultural setting 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:13.929
 our goal is to improve the quality of water 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.610
 improve natural environments and that one 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.920
 few everywhere on the agricultural territory 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:20.769
 what's new is our new 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.830
 collective approach by watershed 

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:25.330
 the watershed refers to the entire 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.369
 territory drained by a watercourse 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.630
 principal and by small tributaries 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.390
 that spill 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:33.520
 it was in 2005 that the foundation of 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:34.000
 fauna started its action by basin 

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.190
 pouring 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.510
 with 10 pilot projects distributed 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.760
 four corners of quebec 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 this program of revitalization of 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.980
 stream is the program that the 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:46.840
 farmers themselves have taken control 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.660
 because they understood the purpose 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 after only 5 1 we already noted 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.960
 biological results quality 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.870
 doubt begins to improve 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.640
 bottom invertebrates the fish and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.710
 the guns came to recolonize 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.510
 many of our streams why that 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:03.190
 march and the kingdom of revitalization 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.430
 agricultural streams is because 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.290
 farmers took over the 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.250
 project I had in a stream there is 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:12.550
 maybe fifty 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.020
 farmers who have it then 

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.760
 simply a convincing who 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.460
 convinces his exasperated neighbor 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:19.470
 rock eventually the finality it's 

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.790
 is she is taken away their children 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.290
 fishing in this watercourse during 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:25.390
 results we achieved with our 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.610
 pilot projects are very encouraging 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.870
 and thanks to the help of our partners 

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:34.150
 financial blue water project rbc 

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:35.290
 syngenta and lupe at the foundation of the 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:38.560
 wildlife sets up a new 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:41.050
 ongoing program since 2011 the 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.510
 foundation wildlife invested 7128 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.320
 thousand dollars to fund 45 projects 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.630
 in Quebec 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.030
 this financial assistance had an effect 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.340
 multiplier since it was distributed 

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.170
 to thirty active organisms in the middle 

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:55.540
 agricultural sector and enabled them to 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 projects to improve the quality of 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.520
 water here are some examples 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.840
 development 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.109
 funded under the program 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.890
 agricultural development of riverbanks and 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.350
 riparian strips 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.239
 the technique is to mitigate the 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.610
 sloping yards to complement 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.349
 the installation with a riprap for 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.330
 prevent the flow of water 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.400
 leads to the collapse of the banks 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:18.980
 another technique is to stabilize 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.530
 the banks by planting trees and 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
 shrubs the roots have the effect of 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.910
 to retain the land of the fields bordering 

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.920
 watercourses avoids the 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.720
 fertilizer contained in the land does not 

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:32.000
 found directly in the watercourse 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.670
 causing a proliferation of algae and 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.980
 of aquatic plants the development of 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.290
 marsh swamps and wetlands 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.840
 are the kidneys of the streams they 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.910
 allow to filter the water 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.920
 temporary ponds bordering 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:48.200
 stream to control the flow of 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.010
 water indeed when water circulates a 

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.810
 too fast 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:52.310
 it can destroy the banks in 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.620
 carrying earth that scramble 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:57.079
 water by diverting some of the water 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.120
 in a swamp slowed his spite and 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.470
 we get as a bonus a medium for 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.959
 fish and birds 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:05.690
 we are also developing started in 

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:07.940
 uncultivated wastelands simard and have for 

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.069
 feature of a hello magazine of the 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.019
 filter and slow down his hearing 

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:14.239
 sealing the developments we have 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:16.160
 realized as part of the program we have 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.750
 found that it was good for us it's 

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.609
 good for shape but it allowed us 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.739
 also to showcase the whole 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.540
 work of farmers and all 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.549
 stakeholders who participated in the project 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.250
 concretely the project what allowed 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.319
 threshold realization to oxygenate 

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.120
 more water or what we did 

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:33.889
 it was allowed the year of circulation 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.130
 fish very important thing for 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:39.200
 improve habitat and that has allowed 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.760
 their long fountain tower in 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.829
 places where we had not seen them since 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.660
 long time you 3 and the work has 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.459
 allowed to find the man of fonts 

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:48.919
 which means that today we can fish 

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:51.709
 the fountain man directly on us 

00:03:48.919 --> 00:03:53.329
 close to the important elements for 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.190
 projects harm its water quality 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:57.049
 it's wildlife species because 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.340
 because it connects wildlife in these projects 

00:03:57.049 --> 00:04:00.620
 there this love for his school of 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:02.810
 understand that agneray the environment 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:05.750
 it's concrete things down to earth 

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:08.479
 close to them after identifying the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.489
 problem and if we performed some 

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:11.430
 work among other things theft households 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.430
 riparian strip 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:16.500
 the cow but the tree planting and 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.840
 the decline of crops what quickly 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:20.459
 brought back among other predators for 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:22.320
 control the hatred for 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.419
 agriculture that give more for 

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.000
 agriculture as you could see 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:29.910
 the movement is launched in 2013 we 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.550
 We will finance 14 new projects 

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:34.470
 hundreds of agricultural producers are 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:36.479
 embarked with us in the process 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.580
 this approach will allow us 

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:40.650
 again to improve the quality 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:41.520
 of water and the growth of 

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.090
 biodiversity 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.560
 thank you support the foundation of the 

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:49.590
 fauna thanks its partners 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:53.130
 financial blue water project rbc 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.840
 syngenta him pea and the main 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.979
 organizations engaged in the realization 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:57.979
 projects
