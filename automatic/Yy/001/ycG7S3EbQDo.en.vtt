00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 the way but this is about relevant 

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.319
 because not only in this case but in 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:10.679
 many other cases where some 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:12.719
 way the history of Catholicism has 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.849
 taught as it says for centuries 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.550
 this kind of situation is not true 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 well many people take it for granted 

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:21.449
 but there is scientific study that we 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.699
 we have shown it in fact salfate that 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.939
 somehow they question that 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:28.439
 indeed this existed but there are 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:30.449
 other scientific studies that 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.090
 show that indeed if there was 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.030
 but not necessarily product unit 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.620
 product of a miracle 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:39.629
 for certain situations that occurred in 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.570
 that moment of adding to that not of the 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.129
 climatic in order and that somehow 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:49.640
 there was now the interpretation 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:52.590
 Divine that has paid at your judgment 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.829
 these things these titanic phenomena 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.829
 as 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:00.760
 there was scripture the commandments the 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.190
 dialogue is a superlative way of 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:06.040
 who wrote it so that the reader 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:10.120
 understand the grandiloquence this god 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.580
 let's say it opens oceans from the 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.200
 deserts understand it is a figure 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.880
 powerful sister for example that 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.440
 feed for 40 years the problem of 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:19.090
 corn is a very small thing because I 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:21.700
 when I see that same image that we are 

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:24.250
 seeing now a whole town at all to 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.950
 all the inspired human being as well as to 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.750
 you were inspired to read it at that time the 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.220
 faith maybe it was not power of 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.810
 questioning the faith was 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.880
 intrinsically in people because 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.040
 there was a direct communication with him 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.160
 where it manifested is but the sphere 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:41.080
 giant but exact the possibility is 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.000
 is questioned because there are no signs 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:45.520
 but to eyes these these unfortunates that 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.380
 they were saved and they were shown 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.720
 let's say before the great eloquence of 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:53.290
 god were punished and they were 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:55.450
 defendants in positive terms to pay 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:57.040
 40 in the desert because I thought that what 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.040
 I had saved 

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:01.720
 they were already making gold idols 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.520
 making human sacrifice and they 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.040
 Annoyed bone despite all the 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:09.310
 shows these roosters still 

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.920
 they are plotting pagani so you can see that 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.930
 really weigh that I think there's a 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.690
 great teaching that despite the evidence 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:19.690
 I thought about all the quality treatment of 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.460
 miracle people say it has not taken root 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.590
 an amount of habit for custom 

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:26.500
 has one so let's say there's a 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.610
 total transformation but look what 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:30.190
 the whole question that you mention to the 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.520
 beginning is true that the term 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.610
 historical geologist anthropologists 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.320
 all the areas or the austro shot 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.510
 nautical we were let's say some when 

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.380
 these give give some meaning dt a 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.890
 all this they say they can have all 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:49.120
 these things a scientific explanation 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.850
 but the honor to the truth and I 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:54.250
 answering something very personal 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:57.220
 can explain to some extent these 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.570
 facts but they fall short to a large extent 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.610
 of the details that are reported by 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.110
 example in the case of the Red Sea that 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.520
 we are seeing and we are going to see the 

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:06.070
 destruction of sodom and gomorrah 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.620
 to goliath and many others or the mana itself 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:10.660
 that in the food that fell from the sky or 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:12.430
 the ark that I knew in the movie for 

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.200
 know that you have lost in them that was 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:15.610
 considered the most weapon for that reason 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.590
 time the israeli people conquered 

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:20.170
 different city of leh all because 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.730
 they had the record that was a weapon 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.890
 impressive that the one that is not 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:25.990
 approached with respect had the same 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:27.970
 symptoms that approach a component 

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:29.950
 radioactive his hair falls out and 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.350
 they ended up dying for days of 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.450
 inexplicable wta laceration as the epr 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.940
 exactly as they said who the 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.310
 crosses the red had to do with 

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.440
 there was at that time a kind of 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:43.030
 tsunami that dragged large amount 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:45.580
 displacement of water towards a single 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.890
 side and that obviously left like a subway 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.110
 of depth I forgive a meter and a half 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:53.320
 so with luck and therefore they could 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.510
 cross but that contradicts itself because no 

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:58.330
 can that phenomenon last for several days and 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.730
 does not explain the column of fire that 

00:03:58.330 --> 00:04:03.430
 interceded between Pharaoh's army 

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:05.140
 and the rael itself and it's ok and then 

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:05.860
 when they were passing the bar he went back to 

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.230
 get together 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.420
 the pests also tried to 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.150
 explain that they turned the river 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.280
 nilo in blood that must have frog that 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.959
 cousins just died genres 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:19.630
 they try to explain but always 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:21.670
 they are short really we are before a 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.540
 mystery mysteries of the bible by 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.620
 true that some some orthodox or 

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:29.650
 I would even dare to question 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.510
 because neither 63 words and act of obtained 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:34.600
 I understand that it was something like that because of a poison 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:36.880
 that the air somehow elevated it 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:38.800
 and the firstborn were sleeping in the parts 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:40.600
 highest exact and that's why Maria 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:42.640
 love seems the seat of the grass 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:44.680
 but interestingly, that's what it says 

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.660
 general there would explain how the 

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:49.630
 firstborn inside the god plates but 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:52.000
 does not explain why all 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.669
 Firstborn of Israel were saved only 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.290
 for painting as god he sent the door 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:58.510
 of their houses with blood is because the 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:05:00.460
 order because because the angel of the 

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:03.280
 death was going to go through those houses and 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:05.350
 then kill nobody but look for 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.210
 example a similar fact within the 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.470
 ministries has that knowledge is 

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.080
 we can see in the video 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:13.500
 some 

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:15.180
 similar to the phenomenon let's say the 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:17.430
 opening of the red sea 

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:19.889
 this was off eastern coasts of 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.180
 China at some coast of China says that 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:23.920
 this happened 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:25.990
 to see what is happening 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:29.050
 and the funny thing that what we are seeing 

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:30.550
 is the raw video of something that 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:32.590
 some time I had the logos of a 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.230
 television network of this country 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.240
 oriental and you see a pretty phenomenon 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:39.730
 curious to consume some floodgates something 

00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:41.830
 under this phenomenon we forgot to repeat 

00:05:39.730 --> 00:05:43.540
 but some could somehow 

00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.360
 they tried to adjudge that these 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:47.650
 phenomena that happen only very occasionally in 

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:51.670
 when and that they do not have an explanation 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.890
 let's say trustworthy rooted or pragmatic 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.380
 from science they could say 

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:58.000
 last credible last credible was 

00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:59.980
 something similar to what created the most red 

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.400
 but that was also a few days 

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:05.290
 minutes and the opening does not allow to arrive 

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:08.310
 to the bottom of the sea not even less 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.310
 people walking the way
