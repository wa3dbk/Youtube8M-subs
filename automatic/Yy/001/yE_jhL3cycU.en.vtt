00:00:01.790 --> 00:00:06.450
 then it's the same exercise as the 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.670
 previous you are asked to write the plan 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.380
 according to x while they are we 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.320
 says a shirt costs 6 euros 

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.139
 a t-shirt costs 10 euros two months 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.619
 that the president of the shirt 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.180
 what is the price of three t-shirts 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:22.500
 so already we will know the most of 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.500
 three tee shirts and comes to know 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.480
 the price of a simple t-shirt already and 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.300
 then we can deduct the price of 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.719
 36 shorts to take and assuming 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.300
 a shirt costs 10 euros 

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:39.239
 and then we are told that a t-shirt say 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.910
 to two months so in this case the crij 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:45.629
 T-shirt will be lower than the price of the 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:48.930
 accord shirt to lanton this case the price 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.760
 t-shirts worth 10 euros if our 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.309
 parents will say two months in gaza goes 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.329
 do it bustle to zero so that's not 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:58.949
 at all do it so I'm going to take 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:02.340
 rather vain so if the ankle or 20 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.979
 euros and that the t-shirt for dir or two 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.489
 month the price of the T-shirt will be 10 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:08.280
 euros 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:11.970
 because I did 20 - 10 so of 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.619
 Generally speaking, if the shirt costs 6 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.360
 euros 

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:19.560
 page subtracted by 10 to know the 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.830
 price of the t-shirt so already the price of a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.830
 T-shirt 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:35.110
 to give us our 6 - 10 so the 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:40.430
 cry of three t-shirts 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:43.690
 that's going to give us 3 x that quantity and 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.690
 that I put here in parentheses 

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:49.310
 you really have to put the parentheses 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:53.780
 because if you multiply doing 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:55.910
 this is not the same at all 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.250
 than the compared to the first chapter 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.350
 on the sequences of operations here 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.580
 because I'm first done 

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.280
 first the calculations in parentheses 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.160
 so I 'm going x man say okay 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.619
 and when I have the result I do 3 x 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.230
 what I got while that if you 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:14.090
 put three times x - 10 bat 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.700
 of watercolors the priority we start with 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.130
 3 x and then you 'll be index it's 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.630
 not at all the same thing round 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.670
 will take good care with the parentheses 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:30.860
 here he told me it does not absolutely 

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:32.630
 nothing so when so leaves so 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.190
 here we are told that a postcard 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.660
 costs 6 euros 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:37.820
 I do not know yet the price of 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:42.200
 postcards we tell you that a stamp 

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:43.489
 costs 28.5 euros less so that 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.520
 I already know that the price of the stamp is 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:47.320
 cheaper than the price of the card 

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.900
 mailing 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.709
 okay, you're asked how much your 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.840
 we buy the postcard and paint it 

00:02:53.709 --> 00:02:58.640
 so we already need the price of the 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.100
 postcard is that the price of the stamp 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:05.090
 the price of the postcard we know that 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:08.450
 so I'm already going to have ten more 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:13.130
 what am I going to put a parenthesis to 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:16.420
 but not the games 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:19.910
 two parentheses I'm afraid of confused 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.820
 we must deprive ourselves later I know that the 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:26.750
 price of the stamp costs 1 25 euro of the month 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.960
 that is to say that starting from the price of 4 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.430
 jean helps him at 8.5 euros for 

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:35.000
 get the price of the stamp 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:38.140
 so I'm going to add it to that x - 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.140
 it's 25 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:48.140
 so that gives you is so here I have 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:49.940
 get x music - 1 to 2.5 then I 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:53.150
 will still do a little 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:56.060
 very interesting remark since 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.030
 I'm going to do an exercise 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.720
 or moral to simplifications 

00:03:59.030 --> 00:04:04.700
 we know that if you have a letter 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:08.690
 that you add with a number 

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.390
 it does not help, that means you 

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:12.950
 leave it like that to plus 3 we are well 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:15.980
 okay also if you have a 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:18.710
 multiplied by three rooms a little that 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.510
 if you have to divide by 3 5 of nothing 

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:21.350
 and then if you also have unless 

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.690
 it gives nothing 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.500
 we can not like that added a number 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:26.000
 is a number 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.400
 it gives us nothing that lets you have it 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:33.920
 left as is then second 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.650
 situation if you have two letters that 

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.340
 are added two different letters here 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:42.530
 a + b 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:45.160
 that also gives you nothing to agree 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:52.720
 you do have seen this b 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:54.670
 a or a b 1 / b to xb all that it does not 

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:59.200
 give you nothing there too that does not you 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:05:03.280
 give becomes on the other hand you can 

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:04.840
 add count between them 3 + 3 and 6 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.910
 you can multiply count between 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.220
 divide them for names and you 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:12.520
 can subtract from the many 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.380
 subtract if we return but we can 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.830
 do the same thing when you have the same 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.320
 letter 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:22.690
 that's what you have here you have x + 

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:25.030
 6 here if you add xx x they are from 

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:26.440
 the same family since I added 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:29.770
 to be but they are exactly the 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:31.090
 same and so exclusive 6.6 and suppose 

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.780
 that x I do not know me it's a 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:33.730
 towel 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:36.250
 there is a towel that get involved 

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:38.650
 plus another series called x that 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:42.460
 will give us two towels so two 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:44.860
 time but I 'll do an exercise where he 

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:46.720
 tell it ok I say that because 

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:52.890
 the amplifying boiler does so here 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.890
 it gave me twice less 1.25 

00:05:53.370 --> 00:06:00.370
 here I can add letters between 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.490
 them if I have the same be agree a 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:07.960
 another example if I have for example 2 xx 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:09.580
 + 6 beats the same two towels 

00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:11.260
 plus one towel 

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:13.090
 because if you want when you have 

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:17.050
 x all alone it's like you're doing 

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:19.180
 a 3 x as a towel plus a 

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.460
 towel napkins 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.260
 there is the same thing two towels 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.669
 no more one these queries when you 

00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:29.320
 have slipped all alone it's like when 

00:06:24.669 --> 00:06:31.900
 x 6 of course given three towels 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:36.390
 ha ha ha ha but I insist because it takes 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:36.390
 may it be the sea ​​not be like here
