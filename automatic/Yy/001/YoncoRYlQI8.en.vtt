00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:12.009
 or who knows but subject thread is beautiful now 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:16.469
 tried to kill a zombie from 20 

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:16.469
 minutes more or less but bullshit 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:24.490
 give me change look see how it was done 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:29.680
 palio politics were fine look a 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:32.170
 masterpiece making don porca puttana dies 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.590
 the holier you do something you hope is shit 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:38.460
 we have to go to work but tosca 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.460
 wait wait for an idea 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.610
 hi to all the boys welcome back up 

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.160
 those two with servers or as you will have 

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:08.630
 certainly already understood from the intro today 

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.810
 we will have to deal with look at that is a 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.810
 game 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.910
 i don't talk shit he says is shit 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:19.430
 that is to say, it is only because one must 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:22.190
 take some developers and do a 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.590
 crap game because for calls 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.869
 good basic idea in this game has 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.610
 an excellent basic idea undoubtedly but 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:30.520
 why ruin it with developers 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.899
 and they don't know where to put their hands 

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.020
 guys there are problems in the 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.960
 animations in the feeling of the controls of the 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.210
 audio problems that are very serious 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:44.450
 in a game of this type that is the type 

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:46.850
 which is for example that there are 10 15 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.680
 zombies behind and you don't feel that they are 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:51.880
 behind you so you turn around it said 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.880
 of being will be gone 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.190
 and we will come a horde of zombies and get pissed off 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.259
 blacks who want to inchiappettare 

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.050
 against sometimes you hear zombies that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.010
 they come everywhere that there is treasure or 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.490
 there is only one 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:20.400
 ie it makes no sense home audio is tremendous 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.020
 another thing that made us sick and 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.120
 who came to attack us from 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.640
 behind another another double 

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.620
 that is, a gamer who cannot take 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.320
 to blows with the torch but we do not 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.800
 we heard it there it arrived at 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:36.930
 shoulders no step no nothing 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:39.750
 we were also running then it was 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:42.150
 impossible to say certain says ask us 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.830
 even lowered he had to run 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.060
 he too and there was no way to 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.459
 hearing it was duty 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.950
 marco was boa this because why 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:52.080
 suffers from a truly done message 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.000
 with the ass the environmental sounds are like this 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.000
 some are like this 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.520
 so pretty much if you do so with 

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:12.650
 the torch silent fortissimo if then 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.210
 walk you don't hear a fucking sounds 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:16.700
 environmental around you are 

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:21.460
 imperceptible but a zombie at 40 meters 

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.460
 and as if inside the ear then 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:31.330
 there is a bit because a good audio would have 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.490
 helped a lot by immersion alone 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.620
 The lover's idea is fantastic 

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:38.140
 we repeat the thing that you enter into this 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:39.670
 world and you have nothing you have to survive 

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.230
 there is the hunger bar there is the bar 

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.660
 there is the bar of life in life 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.030
 on the health bar, however, there is from 

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:49.000
 stand another the other game bar 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.100
 shit written in art that is why 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.110
 this guys because this actually 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.300
 game has a basic concept that is 

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.370
 phenomenal is an open world and already this 

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:59.830
 what pleases us is an open world 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.690
 multiplayer and we like it too 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:04.000
 we are pleased that it is a game in part 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.070
 cooperative but in part all against 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.140
 all because depending on who you have of 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:10.450
 front will decide whether to help you 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.860
 get out of the kakÃ  or end up with a blow 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:13.570
 of rifle to rub you all 

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:15.430
 punishments and the things you have is 

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:18.310
 beautiful to play in groups but 

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.200
 should be rethought from the beginning want 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:22.960
 the basic idea and we repeat is the only one 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.420
 good for the game along with the 

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.090
 which changes on the day of return 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:31.450
 let's say it arrived dawn then 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:33.490
 everything goes to the full sun day then 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:35.260
 night goes and nice thing that goes 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.090
 around with the torch is not nice and the 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.180
 made of the ballet at some point it takes 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.260
 eboli yes animations guys are not 

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.880
 just nasty they are just nonsense are 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:53.050
 woody lousy as well as sounds 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:55.240
 that is when this guy jumps so luca 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.250
 guys is really shit 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.770
 there are things that make you say 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:01.930
 slutty whore like cool lights 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.550
 chemical ie when you find light 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:06.550
 chemistry you put it on the ground illuminated 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:08.260
 the area to attract perhaps to signal 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:11.770
 your companions is your position 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.630
 these things are phenomenal but like 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.380
 always happens in this type of games 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:17.300
 when you get to tighten 

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:21.400
 dear to combat with zombies there 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.400
 he finds himself faced with unwatchable things 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.090
 Oh well 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.090
 after 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:43.120
 there would be so much to say about this game 

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:46.120
 but we don't want to dwell on a game 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:48.909
 that even if it is at 10 euros on steam and it 

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:51.340
 you find at a lot less when you have discount 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.949
 more game than we feel of 

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:56.590
 recommend absolutely why he has 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.539
 too many to be too much 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.370
 because then you are very free of 

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:03.849
 to buy it you have to buy it 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:06.370
 I really like the basic idea though 

00:06:03.849 --> 00:06:09.520
 Lin made gameplay made jacob 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:12.099
 sold ie also guys if you 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:14.169
 you are thinking that a survival game can 

00:06:12.099 --> 00:06:15.939
 be interesting for the management of 

00:06:14.169 --> 00:06:18.400
 few bullets from doctors 

00:06:15.939 --> 00:06:20.740
 yes agree as a survival game 

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:23.379
 unfortunately it is also based on reflections 

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:24.849
 on your coordination on the choice 

00:06:23.379 --> 00:06:26.889
 right at the right time 

00:06:24.849 --> 00:06:29.229
 which you are practically prevented from 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:31.719
 do because the movements of the zombies 

00:06:29.229 --> 00:06:33.460
 they are unpredictable not in the sense that they are 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:35.379
 zombies move randomly but in the sense 

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:38.500
 that one zombie also scratched by two 

00:06:35.379 --> 00:06:40.210
 meters and these problems these problems 

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.460
 collision these lag problems 

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:44.319
 call them what you like is not that you 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.419
 then penalize then reborn e 

00:06:44.319 --> 00:06:48.370
 good night you lose all that 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.289
 you can answer after 1 hour 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.919
 or in the version they last the exhibits 

00:06:50.289 --> 00:06:58.419
 own exact duvets this is one thing 

00:06:53.919 --> 00:07:00.639
 beautiful as an idea but very serious 

00:06:58.419 --> 00:07:02.819
 in a context like that of work like this 

00:07:00.639 --> 00:07:05.469
 wet because I'm dead for a bug 

00:07:02.819 --> 00:07:08.050
 after i got my ass off like that a 

00:07:05.469 --> 00:07:10.029
 find weapons if I lose everything because 

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.550
 I'm playing and paid I am worth the whole 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.650
 I break some of the gas that is boys 

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:17.050
 let 's try to understand that it is a project 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.389
 brave but when you do things like that 

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:23.729
 courageous must have a solid foundation 

00:07:19.389 --> 00:07:23.729
 technique behind you otherwise do words
