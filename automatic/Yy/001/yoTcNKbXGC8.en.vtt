 Here I will show you how to do the 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:14.340
 trick of the whys balls and the 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:17.279
 Pokemon during nothing I will tell you that the 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.090
 link that I'm going to leave is not mine, not what 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:22.890
 believe I took it out of a video 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:28.310
 but good 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.200
 but wang so they do not say it 's yours 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:33.900
 good 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.380
 they go to the browser 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:45.230
 ah 

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:47.329
 well let's go with a video 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:50.989
 sorry and 

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:56.289
 and it was deleted something happened with the kansas already 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:59.210
 deleted and I'm returning it to start and neither 

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.789
 they will seem to open can be given 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:05.059
 in save as to save a 

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:06.920
 folder to open and it automatically 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:11.590
 they will appear there the percent of 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:11.590
 the file where you are saving 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:22.100
 the good gunner here is going to them 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.549
 open the web file winrar have it if 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.830
 not so with a video of how to download it 

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:30.979
 and also to decompress the 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:33.740
 innocent and good once decompressed 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:35.620
 everything will look like a folder that 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.920
 says everything here 

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.720
 here we are going to give in here we see that it comes out 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.540
 to all the chats and code for the 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.970
 new screen also comes what 

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:47.869
 pokÃ©mon soulsilver file and the 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:50.270
 emulator 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:56.450
 Y 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:59.420
 but once this is done 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.710
 and here we see cardboard 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.270
 all of piquin with 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.800
 two 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:09.250
 several sorcerers 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.930
 I will give it to you to do it 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:14.040
 of what I do not have to imply 

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.040
 that even 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.220
 because it disappears 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.150
 let's open the game 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.150
 and 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.000
 ah 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:48.239
 not here I will put for the screen 

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:48.239
 black 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:59.879
 and here is 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:05.290
 well once entering the game 

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:09.129
 they go here where they say what whatever 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.129
 and the at 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:15.140
 best 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:18.140
 and in this case I will put here 

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:18.140
 impose on us 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:25.549
 two 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:30.250
 here my voice is number 97 I no longer what 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:30.250
 I know by heart but not to teach them 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:42.300
 7 we do not trust and 

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:47.970
 instead here where they say where they are 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.790
 the 3x caps impose 097 is the 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.819
 number of years here again there are other 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.000
 we erase them 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:59.670
 and we put 097 

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:02.990
 then we give red light traction what 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:08.000
 we call double because the trick appears 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.000
 ok and well now we are going to look for it 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.960
 ping 

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:20.410
 and here is indeed not a 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.410
 Level 4 level 

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.730
 Here I showed you how and now I 'm going 

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:32.689
 to show the one of the few balls are at 

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:36.909
 come here 

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:36.909
 the tricks and we look for 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:48.419
 here they say put all the balls 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:05:00.020
 let's say he 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:05:03.729
 the code and we're going to have 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.729
 I already have in seeing all things 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:07.880
 now we have 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:16.290
 we install replay and open action 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:20.640
 double click to select it and we will 

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:21.290
 press select and up to it 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:24.900
 weather 

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:28.650
 usually up there is always I guess 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:35.620
 that with the keys above and with the 

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:38.020
 key from there and we're going to the 

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:41.260
 there are resources because balls and if 

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:43.760
 effectively here are all the 

00:05:41.260 --> 00:05:46.490
 because balls 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.470
 and well I did it very fast but 

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.880
 it's because of lack of time I have to do 

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.570
 several things this day 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.360
 and well if you liked it if it served you 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:59.150
 Video of the 100 of hand above subscribe 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.620
 if you comment if you failed to see if the 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:05.690
 can help and good when 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.360
 a guide also of this game just 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:11.570
 came the videos is fourth 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:15.440
 in case you want to see her there 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.440
 taking out my channel 

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:20.950
 so later I can help you with more 

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:22.310
 tutorials this one became simple why 

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.220
 I did it and 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.130
 to see if more people win because I do not have 

00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:29.810
 subscribers or anything thinking starting 

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:32.500
 with this wave 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:32.500
 dress
