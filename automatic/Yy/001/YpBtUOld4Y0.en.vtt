00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
gosh it is not fair so this is basically

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.039

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
probably in the next next patch 1.4

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:08.780 
probably in the next next patch 1.4
point<00:01:07.530> 3<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.100> what<00:01:08.250> it's<00:01:08.369> going<00:01:08.490> to<00:01:08.549> be<00:01:08.610> in

this<00:01:17.250> out<00:01:17.640> because<00:01:17.939> we're<00:01:18.240> a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.420> bit

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
this out because we're a little bit

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.410 
this out because we're a little bit
faster<00:01:18.810> over<00:01:19.490> well<00:01:20.490> we<00:01:20.850> probably<00:01:21.030> won't<00:01:21.240> be<00:01:21.360> a

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
faster over well we probably won't be a

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.300 
faster over well we probably won't be a
little<00:01:21.600> bit<00:01:21.750> faster<00:01:22.080> but<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.409> feel<00:01:22.710> like<00:01:22.740> ultra

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
little bit faster but I feel like ultra

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.890 
little bit faster but I feel like ultra
lyst<00:01:23.490> do<00:01:23.640> need<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.850> be<00:01:24.000> a<00:01:24.090> little<00:01:24.330> bit<00:01:24.420> faster

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
lyst do need to be a little bit faster

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.410 
lyst do need to be a little bit faster
because<00:01:25.080> there<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.740> a<00:01:25.770> video<00:01:26.430> out<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.729> can't

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
time and keep stemming even on creep the

time and keep stemming even on creep the
ultra<00:01:45.420> list<00:01:45.600> can't<00:01:45.990> kill<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:47.040> Marauder<00:01:47.369> for

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
ultra list can't kill the Marauder for

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.789 
ultra list can't kill the Marauder for
like<00:01:48.030> a<00:01:48.240> good<00:01:48.570> minute<00:01:48.869> which<00:01:49.140> is<00:01:49.320> really

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
like a good minute which is really

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:53.359 
like a good minute which is really
ridiculous<00:01:50.640> he's<00:01:51.390> on<00:01:51.540> creep<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.369> he's

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
ridiculous he's on creep and he's

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.510 
ridiculous he's on creep and he's

creep<00:01:59.040> ah<00:01:59.479> so<00:02:00.479> that's<00:02:00.630> kind<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:00.960> ridiculous<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
creep ah so that's kind of ridiculous I

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.840 
creep ah so that's kind of ridiculous I
feel<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.890> that's<00:02:02.040> something<00:02:02.250> that<00:02:02.520> would

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
feel like that's something that would

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.940 
feel like that's something that would
that<00:02:03.630> needs<00:02:03.990> to<00:02:04.170> be<00:02:04.259> fixed<00:02:04.439> I'll<00:02:04.680> leave<00:02:04.829> a<00:02:04.890> link

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
that needs to be fixed I'll leave a link

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.399 
that needs to be fixed I'll leave a link
to<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> below<00:02:05.430> but<00:02:05.850> those<00:02:06.479> tank<00:02:06.899> exploits

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
to that below but those tank exploits

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.070 
to that below but those tank exploits
are<00:02:07.590> terrible<00:02:08.629> basically<00:02:09.629> what<00:02:09.780> we

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
are terrible basically what we

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:15.980 
are terrible basically what we
is<00:02:10.440> tanks<00:02:11.180> tanks<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.360> are<00:02:14.840> what<00:02:15.840> are<00:02:15.930> we

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
is tanks tanks that are what are we

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.440 
is tanks tanks that are what are we
calling<00:02:16.200> it<00:02:16.470> tanks<00:02:16.890> that<00:02:17.040> tank<00:02:17.850> on<00:02:18.000> top<00:02:18.030> of

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
calling it tanks that tank on top of

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.820 
calling it tanks that tank on top of
each<00:02:18.570> other<00:02:18.720> there's<00:02:19.020> like<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.170> bunch<00:02:19.350> of<00:02:19.500> tanks

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
each other there's like a bunch of tanks

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.890 
each other there's like a bunch of tanks
in<00:02:20.190> a<00:02:20.460> tiny<00:02:20.700> little<00:02:21.030> space<00:02:21.330> which<00:02:21.600> like

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
in a tiny little space which like

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.050 
in a tiny little space which like
imagine<00:02:22.680> running<00:02:22.710> into<00:02:23.010> like<00:02:23.310> six<00:02:23.640> tanks<00:02:23.850> that

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
imagine running into like six tanks that

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.490 
imagine running into like six tanks that
are<00:02:24.120> all<00:02:24.300> seized<00:02:24.540> great<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.990> top<00:02:25.230> of<00:02:25.410> each

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
are all seized great on top of each

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.040 
are all seized great on top of each
other<00:02:25.650> I<00:02:26.000> don't<00:02:27.000> think<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.330> can<00:02:27.480> survive<00:02:27.600> very

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
other I don't think we can survive very

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.630 
other I don't think we can survive very
long<00:02:28.170> of<00:02:28.440> course<00:02:28.470> if<00:02:28.740> you<00:02:28.830> sent<00:02:29.010> some<00:02:29.190> more

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:29.640 
long of course if you sent some more

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.790 
long of course if you sent some more
mute<00:02:30.300> as<00:02:30.390> in<00:02:30.540> now<00:02:30.660> be<00:02:30.870> good<00:02:31.020> but<00:02:31.260> you<00:02:31.500> know<00:02:31.620> if

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
mute as in now be good but you know if

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:33.800 
mute as in now be good but you know if
situations<00:02:32.430> were<00:02:32.610> bad<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.360> is<00:02:33.510> something

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:33.810 
situations were bad this is something

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:34.790 
situations were bad this is something
they're<00:02:33.960> definitely<00:02:34.080> gonna<00:02:34.290> have<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.560> change

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
they're definitely gonna have to change

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.950 
they're definitely gonna have to change
plus<00:02:35.280> we've<00:02:35.490> also<00:02:35.760> seen<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.480> tanks<00:02:36.780> can

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:36.960 
plus we've also seen that the tanks can

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.780 
plus we've also seen that the tanks can
fall<00:02:37.200> down<00:02:37.230> to<00:02:37.410> the<00:02:37.650> bottom<00:02:37.800> running<00:02:38.610> over

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
fall down to the bottom running over

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.530 
fall down to the bottom running over
like<00:02:39.330> down<00:02:39.900> to<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.710> fogginess<00:02:41.640> where<00:02:42.240> you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
like down to the fogginess where you

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.920 
like down to the fogginess where you
think<00:02:42.780> you'd<00:02:42.930> probably<00:02:43.230> die<00:02:43.620> but<00:02:44.400> know<00:02:44.580> if<00:02:44.930> you

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
think you'd probably die but know if you

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.570 
think you'd probably die but know if you
just<00:02:46.170> save<00:02:46.380> your<00:02:46.530> tank<00:02:46.800> and<00:02:46.920> try<00:02:47.220> to<00:02:47.280> push<00:02:47.460> it

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
just save your tank and try to push it

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:48.920 
just save your tank and try to push it
over<00:02:47.760> to<00:02:47.880> the<00:02:47.940> side<00:02:48.090> will<00:02:48.240> fall<00:02:48.450> down<00:02:48.480> to<00:02:48.660> the

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
over to the side will fall down to the

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.290 
over to the side will fall down to the
ground<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.350> you<00:02:49.770> can<00:02:49.890> go<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.250> run<00:02:50.520> on<00:02:50.670> like

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
ground and you can go and run on like

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.180 
ground and you can go and run on like

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
of drones which is really unfair so I am

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.280 
of drones which is really unfair so I am
hoping<00:02:59.670> to<00:03:00.000> see<00:03:00.150> Blizzard<00:03:00.540> fix<00:03:00.810> that<00:03:00.990> soon

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:01.290 
hoping to see Blizzard fix that soon

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.260 
hoping to see Blizzard fix that soon
because<00:03:02.040> I<00:03:02.070> don't<00:03:02.280> want<00:03:02.400> to<00:03:02.459> see<00:03:02.580> it<00:03:02.730> used<00:03:02.970> too

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
because I don't want to see it used too

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.150 
because I don't want to see it used too
much<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.690> any<00:03:03.810> lighter<00:03:04.110> games<00:03:04.410> because<00:03:05.010> that

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:05.160 
much in any lighter games because that

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.760 
much in any lighter games because that
would<00:03:05.310> suck<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.610> hard<00:03:06.410> anyways<00:03:07.410> those<00:03:07.560> are<00:03:07.590> the
