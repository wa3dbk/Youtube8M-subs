00:00:03.129 --> 00:00:07.443
 Let's watch a unipolar two-position lever switch. 

00:00:07.772 --> 00:00:10.750
 We have one pole, here, and two contacts. 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.865
 This means that we can power up to three places on the switch 

00:00:17.401 --> 00:00:21.028
 and pass current through two circuits. 

00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:27.911
 We will take a small screwdriver and open the case. 

00:00:28.692 --> 00:00:33.116
 This is the interior of the lever switch. Everything is already undressed. 

00:00:33.436 --> 00:00:36.593
 You can see the contacts here ... 

00:00:36.693 --> 00:00:39.843
 One pole and two side ones. 

00:00:40.181 --> 00:00:42.518
 When the switch is open, 

00:00:42.845 --> 00:00:45.302
 the current flows in one circuit, 

00:00:45.402 --> 00:00:49.156
 and when closed - in the second. This circuit is closing. 

00:00:49.922 --> 00:00:51.572
 You can see how it works. 

00:00:51.674 --> 00:00:56.143
 There is a plastic hammer that pushes a spring. 

00:00:56.439 --> 00:01:02.018
 The lever causes the spring to press the copper contact 

00:01:02.467 --> 00:01:05.986
 and closes or opens circuits connected to the contacts. 

00:01:06.772 --> 00:01:09.007
 Leverâ€¦ 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.880
 it contains the two contacts, 

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:15.492
 or two. 

00:01:15.733 --> 00:01:20.505
 Take a look: this copper contact rises and falls. 

00:01:20.816 --> 00:01:23.283
 These parts are probably made of aluminum. 

00:01:23.383 --> 00:01:25.704
 The spring is made of spring steel, 

00:01:25.804 --> 00:01:30.287
 lever probably made of nickel steel. 

00:01:30.589 --> 00:01:36.184
 It is connected to a copper contact. 

00:01:36.756 --> 00:01:40.733
 The housing is probably made of ABS plastic. Injection molded. 

00:01:41.054 --> 00:01:46.627
 There are protruding terminals here. 

00:01:47.213 --> 00:01:49.779
 I do not know if you can see them well, but they are. 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.234
 They pass through the holes in the upper part of the housing. 

00:01:55.697 --> 00:01:57.197
 I lay ... 

00:01:59.005 --> 00:02:00.609
 That's how it is supposed to be. 

00:02:01.248 --> 00:02:04.953
 These clamps come out through the holes. During production, 

00:02:05.053 --> 00:02:09.508
 the lid is pressed against the rest of the casing with a hot metal plate. 

00:02:09.608 --> 00:02:12.027
 The clamps pass through the holes 

00:02:12.127 --> 00:02:19.376
 and they are sealed. That's how the housing is 

00:02:19.476 --> 00:02:23.285
 unipolar two-position lever switch. 

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:27.069
 This element was also injection molded. 

00:02:28.555 --> 00:02:30.764
 When we press the lever, 

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:34.594
 switch between this contact ... 

00:02:34.928 --> 00:02:38.364
 This one is always connected, switch between this and that. 

00:02:39.106 --> 00:02:42.152
 One pole and two side contacts. 

00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:47.283
 You can see them here. By pressing the lever, we switch.
