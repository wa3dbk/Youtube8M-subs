 a new format here on this channel 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.220
 yes , I thought fit next to me 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.980
 maybe there's another two 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.240
 thing is still to make this channel because 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.639
 otherwise maybe a little bit too 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.470
 would become drab and I have mine 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:21.990
 now and then sometimes thinks about it 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:24.480
 couple so 20 after and different 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:37.110
 topics and I can join in today 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:39.600
 one while in red and pokemon 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.670
 blue from the professor eich in the beginning in the 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.920
 Game is introduced the nido 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.570
 rhinow shown, however, is due 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.370
 a programming error instead 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.370
 played a norina on it 

00:00:50.079 --> 00:00:53.800
 this song is from a starter 

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:56.019
 pokémon the only starter pokémon 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:01.420
 which has two types from the beginning 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:03.850
 namely plant and poison though no 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:06.040
 pokémon has been the type 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.950
 question mark question mark question mark 

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:11.259
 guy known from the ta cco flight like that 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:16.479
 programmed that he does not weaken and 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:18.670
 no resistance has many pokémon 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.710
 have the same in the first generation 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.429
 or similar- sounding calls 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:28.659
 such as thicker and dodo or 

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:33.240
 also safe and gold ingo horn and 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:33.240
 Jurack or Rowdie and goldie never 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.819
 the ratina is the only pokemon with 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:44.850
 two guys who are also his 

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:44.850
 Weaknesses are spirit and dragon 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.860
 before the publication of the golden 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.870
 and silver edition became therapy 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:58.050
 often mistakenly called a pokémon 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:02:03.380
 Number 152 called acid is the 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.380
 only poison attack that does not poison 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.610
 the starter pokémon of gold silver and 

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:11.490
 crystal are the only ones already from 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:16.260
 at the beginning of not wearing namely one 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.720
 berry in the first generation of 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.270
 There are two unused types of pokémon 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.959
 namely the question mark question mark 

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:27.390
 question mark type and the sidewalk 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:33.630
 These two types are only with 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:36.570
 missio is represented as a clone of bio 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:39.050
 however , the pokédex is called 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:39.050
 about mju 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:43.230
 most of you know that 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.420
 but probably for those who have it 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.450
 Do not know the point one man 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.100
 crystal gold and silver times the radio 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.530
 turn on in the alps 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:54.950
 there is a pretty interesting 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.950
 contrast 

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.790
 one or the other is certainly 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:01.129
 already noticed 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:05.120
 but Siegfried has silver in gold 

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:12.769
 and crystal as m3 pretty under 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:14.659
 lemgoer kripo and zombies are the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:17.329
 both single pokémon the due 

00:03:14.659 --> 00:03:23.540
 their types combination no weakness 

00:03:17.329 --> 00:03:25.819
 have the tokens navteq and rex blitzer 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:29.989
 are the pokémon with the most 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:37.489
 namely weaken fire flew poison stone 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:39.560
 steel beetle and fight the bike music 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:41.209
 in gold is silver and crystal 

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:47.870
 actually just one 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:52.209
 faster version of the music train acg loud 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:55.489
 various pokédex entries is mini atom 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:59.629
 only the discarded envelope of a 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:01.030
 ninjas which is brought to life and 

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:05.380
 you should not look no 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:12.130
 you lose your soul pretty much criticism 

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:16.060
 a children's game according to the pokédex is 

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:18.570
 Ballet a discarded doll which 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:21.610
 woke up on a garbage dump to live 

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:25.560
 bus full of vengefulness looking for the child 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:25.560
 which has thrown away 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:35.370
 in the text is written that real ira 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:38.940
 his opponent sometimes with a small studio 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:44.630
 So roc causes a pokémon attacks 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:44.630
 pokémon with pokemon on pokémon zetsche 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.610
 now and caputh ops is said to be his opponent 

00:04:48.509 --> 00:04:51.870
 cut his safe and her 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.180
 then testify 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.580
 Now imagine that with his 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.440
 little sweet pikachu before where we join 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:04.860
 Broken are stay the same way 

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:07.729
 backups or a modified version 

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.710
 from computop for there are rumors circulating 

00:05:07.729 --> 00:05:12.960
 that the pokémon gene sect from the 

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:15.419
 fifth generation actually one 

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.740
 Modified broken ops is sounds 

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:19.530
 maybe a little absurd 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:22.259
 but if you look at the pokédex now 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:25.560
 entries by caputh ops the pokédex 

00:05:22.259 --> 00:05:28.050
 requests from gena sekt then compares 

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.419
 Maybe you put one or two 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.669
 common ground that this theory 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.669
 could certainly confirm 

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:41.819
 yes that was it with the first one 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:43.889
 facts episode about pokémon I have there 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:45.720
 was like this two interesting ones 

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:49.650
 facts here and that was not all that 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:52.500
 boring for you and yes I will 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:56.660
 now again busters and stuff 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:59.660
 Upload everything and then we will hear each other 

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.660
 again
