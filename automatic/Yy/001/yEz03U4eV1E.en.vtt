00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.830
 well this is a normal machine the 

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.750
 normal dish is the largest of all 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.420
 then there is a little bit smaller that is the 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.970
 mini then there is the paten that has the 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.160
 same diameter and the rabbit rabbit is going 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.680
 rolling on the floor in normal limits 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.780
 birds especially flying this imitate 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.480
 the rabbit and the hare and then 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.260
 write by imitating the shoes to another 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.260
 type of birds the machine as you see is 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.879
 in the countryside and here there is no current the 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.550
 power is with 12 volts with 

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:41.989
 battery that has a capacity to 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:45.059
 throw the 1500 or 2000 dishes 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.010
 approximately and it depends on the position 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:49.920
 now this machine is in a position 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:53.399
 vertical or the machine is pulling the 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.810
 vertical dish but you can put more 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.760
 lying straighter 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.100
 more heel to one side to another 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.530
 now many scores are searched for 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.030
 that the dish would be better the dish in 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:07.210
 come straight totally as they go 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.590
 chopped few choirs so that the red 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.650
 better it looks better and has better 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.890
 visibility and good then they are another 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.860
 type of machines the minis the paten and 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.810
 each one is different and pulls different 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.570
 plate and then there is the rabbit that is a 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.660
 sort of wheel that there is with shovel and that 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.880
 have if it is wheel and it goes out as a 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.700
 bicycle drives and leaves rolling 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.820
 imitates a rabbit when it runs 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.910
 sometimes obstacles are placed or limited 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:38.979
 the space to make it easier or more 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:41.229
 difficult if you imitate a little more it comes out 

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:43.660
 free it gets longer depends how it 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.180
 can put escape you can put a 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.619
 little cross-front can put the 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.540
 trajectories can be put of everything 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:51.940
 kind just like the dishes that come from 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:54.369
 face this machine gets that between 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.860
 face and imitates geo dishes as boom or 

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.480
 loss can imitate 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:01.720
 pigeons appear 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.460
 learn to stretch the pigeons there 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.050
 can do all kinds of things with them 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:13.170
 that are machines that give the 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:13.170
 very good result and they are going very well
