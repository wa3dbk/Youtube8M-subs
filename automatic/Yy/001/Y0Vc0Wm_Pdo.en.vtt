00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello I show you five of today 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.960
 my favorite face brushing or 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.740
 especially secondary market 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.860
 crystallized out to the iba and 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.559
 realtech nothing I start with zuewa one 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.299
 brand that mainly produces brushes and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.760
 that for a very good price stops the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.130
 brush prices are between 4 and 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.689
 14 euro or so depending on what 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.910
 are brush and what hasi 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.000
 exist, however, synthetic brushes 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.949
 just the peninsula and I think so 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 There are so many brushes that really work for you 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.239
 everyone is there and you actually 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.260
 his entire collection of these 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:36.780
 brush can have 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.320
 There are even so complete sets 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.850
 face paint and eyes and I have 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 I really like a brush 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.700
 long years have been in the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:50.039
 finish brush 102 and I'm on 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:51.870
 Start used for foundation 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.090
 but he is a bit too 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.010
 firm and the area is too small for me 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:58.379
 So it takes a long time to make 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.300
 has applied and then I have 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:03.570
 someday started to lead the 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.369
 chanel so this cream bronze this 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.350
 make-up to wear it as well 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.299
 I have not looked back since 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.189
 because I have any scream product cream 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:13.140
 rouge cream highlighter cream browser 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.900
 Always apply everything with this brush 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.360
 and that's just a tree I am 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.670
 have to say I have relatively new ones 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.950
 pisa von zuewa and also those who me 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.170
 no one is broken for several years 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.880
 The form has stayed with everyone 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.130
 they are super soft and of the 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.040
 quality really great the second brush 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.240
 is relatively new to me so with relative 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.610
 I mean again probably as a 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:38.040
 half a year or longer but on each 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.880
 If not several years, that's the dax 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.930
 rose finish from 21 to 26 and I have to 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.850
 say I'm not that fan of 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.250
 but this beveled rouge brush 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.920
 a big fan of this one is this 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.320
 not so easy not tied too tight 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.590
 and that is super soft and I use 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.380
 Really every day for rouge but 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.000
 just for highlighter when I go to 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.730
 Example is traveling and not like 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.020
 take every product an island with you 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.210
 then it worked great for me too 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.400
 highlighter just because the area here 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.050
 is very narrow and he just is not 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.210
 too loose as I said is bound 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.670
 last topic brush is the salmon 

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:15.470
 highlight 105 and I have to say um 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:16.940
 some in this form i like this shape 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.460
 in itself very much 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.960
 There is also a cosmetic cosmo and 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.030
 from world-check nix there is also this 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:24.320
 account brasch which is similar if I 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.580
 They just like it because they like it 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.310
 a bit on the go and then again 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.470
 To run sharper and therefore extreme 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.030
 are well suited for just highlighter 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.180
 but I actually use everyone 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:37.280
 day for fix your brother so if i have 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.440
 my make-up fixate actually 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.910
 only the t zone and the whole 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.230
 targeted to carry on and give 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:44.720
 not to the huge powder brush 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:46.790
 but also a little and do so 

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:48.470
 I then put the powder along the t zone 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:50.030
 and here also at the banks on the 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:52.670
 second brand I introduce you 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.100
 wants to be as I said real technics and there 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.020
 especially I especially like the 

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:00.020
 But I do not break it quickly 

00:02:57.020 --> 00:03:02.390
 football but for browser i find 

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.070
 that the perfect browser brush too 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.220
 they are all here now 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.320
 Synthetic hair are all super soft 

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:10.850
 none of these brushes is broken 

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:11.480
 I have all gone several already 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:13.760
 years 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.010
 the form has been preserved and the 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:18.590
 quality is just great i like the 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:22.010
 great for browser because he is relative 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.959
 big is not too pointed 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.700
 but somehow a bit sharp 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:28.880
 so it can be very targeted 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.650
 browser but do not wear that 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.360
 too hard so if somehow now 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.590
 you would be bound 

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.600
 already can not blight bad 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.239
 but he is bound right 

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 so blending is very very easy 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:42.110
 and that goes very fast in the morning 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:45.560
 the last brush is a brush i 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.080
 never used for years never 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.810
 touched until this year 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:53.570
 and suddenly learned to love and so on 

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:55.820
 a very classic foundation brush 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.320
 tied very flat because here you see 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:00.709
 that he runs a bit pointed 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:03.440
 that is the foundation today swiftly and 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:04.200
 i have to say for concealer and 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.370
 highlight 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:10.980
 So I like the concealer products 

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.650
 so I like to use mine 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:15.510
 concealer and wear it with it 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.280
 and that's very good, so to speak 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:18.870
 the strong points where the concealer goes 

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.250
 should and then drive would not be the whole 

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.729
 in another brush or mine 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.370
 hands 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:25.830
 and that works very well and that 

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.030
 Distributing is easier than if you did 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.340
 the hand tries that 

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:32.639
 speakers can be bought separately 

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.800
 this one was in a set I believe 

00:04:32.639 --> 00:04:36.540
 you collection is the prices fluctuate 

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.639
 but I will order there too 

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:40.110
 a few left in the infobox pack and 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.630
 that was it for my video i got you 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.979

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:45.570
 shown I hope that we have you 

00:04:43.979 --> 00:04:47.130
 liked and if you have more videos 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.210
 In the way you want to see then write it 

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:50.960
 like to comment
