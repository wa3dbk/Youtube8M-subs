banana<00:00:28.859> powder<00:00:29.189> but<00:00:29.670> with<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:29.939> one<00:00:30.119> I<00:00:30.150> feel

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
banana powder but with this one I feel

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:32.209 
banana powder but with this one I feel
like<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:30.660> does<00:00:30.869> complement<00:00:31.349> a<00:00:31.529> lot<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.859> darker

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
like it does complement a lot of darker

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.040 
like it does complement a lot of darker
skin<00:00:32.460> tones<00:00:32.700> so<00:00:32.969> if<00:00:33.059> someone<00:00:33.300> like<00:00:33.420> me<00:00:33.600> or<00:00:33.899> even

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
skin tones so if someone like me or even

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.209 
skin tones so if someone like me or even
if<00:00:34.230> you're<00:00:34.380> darker<00:00:34.680> than<00:00:34.829> me<00:00:34.950> you<00:00:35.070> can

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
if you're darker than me you can

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.760 
if you're darker than me you can
definitely<00:00:35.370> use<00:00:35.670> this<00:00:35.850> shade<00:00:36.149> and<00:00:36.480> the<00:00:37.170> thing

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
definitely use this shade and the thing

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.979 
definitely use this shade and the thing
I<00:00:37.860> like<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.040> this<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.790> it's<00:00:39.210> just<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.780> much

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
I like about this is it's just so much

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:42.560 
I like about this is it's just so much
more<00:00:40.260> finely<00:00:40.590> milled<00:00:41.100> it's<00:00:42.059> just<00:00:42.300> so<00:00:42.450> much

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
more finely milled it's just so much

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.420 
more finely milled it's just so much
more<00:00:42.809> smoother<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.350> applies<00:00:43.590> a<00:00:43.620> lot<00:00:43.920> smoother

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
more smoother it applies a lot smoother

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.250 
more smoother it applies a lot smoother
so<00:00:44.670> what<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:44.850> do<00:00:44.940> is<00:00:45.239> to<00:00:45.360> put<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.629> under<00:00:45.870> my<00:00:46.020> eyes

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
so what I do is to put it under my eyes

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.240 
so what I do is to put it under my eyes
and<00:00:46.680> my<00:00:47.399> nose<00:00:47.670> on<00:00:47.910> top<00:00:48.149> of<00:00:48.270> my<00:00:48.420> forehead<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
and my nose on top of my forehead and

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.500 
and my nose on top of my forehead and
sometimes<00:00:50.250> on<00:00:50.340> my<00:00:50.370> chin<00:00:50.670> but<00:00:50.879> usually<00:00:51.270> I<00:00:51.300> get

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
sometimes on my chin but usually I get

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.479 
sometimes on my chin but usually I get
rid<00:00:51.809> or<00:00:51.930> your<00:00:52.110> my<00:00:52.230> chin<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:52.469> I<00:00:52.649> tend<00:00:52.980> not<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.190> it

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
rid or your my chin so I tend not to it

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.729 
rid or your my chin so I tend not to it
I<00:00:53.699> tend<00:00:54.360> not<00:00:54.390> spoil<00:00:54.690> anything<00:00:54.809> there<00:00:55.110> and<00:00:55.350> then

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
I tend not spoil anything there and then

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.860 
I tend not spoil anything there and then
just<00:00:56.039> like<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.520> my<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:57.210> sides<00:00:57.480> of<00:00:57.660> my

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
just like to my the sides of my

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.959 
just like to my the sides of my
cheekbones<00:00:58.199> if<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:59.070> was<00:00:59.219> to<00:00:59.309> compare<00:00:59.699> with<00:00:59.850> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
cheekbones if I was to compare with the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.360 
cheekbones if I was to compare with the
banana<00:01:00.239> powder<00:01:00.480> I<00:01:00.690> feel<00:01:01.050> like<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:02.010> one

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
banana powder I feel like this one

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.369

do<00:02:09.900> I<00:02:10.170> would<00:02:10.320> put<00:02:11.190> a<00:02:11.220> link<00:02:11.460> below<00:02:11.730> but<00:02:12.180> I<00:02:12.270> know

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
do I would put a link below but I know

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:13.700 
do I would put a link below but I know
they<00:02:12.510> have<00:02:12.630> other<00:02:12.810> face<00:02:13.080> powders<00:02:13.440> in<00:02:13.560> their

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
they have other face powders in their

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.070 
they have other face powders in their
