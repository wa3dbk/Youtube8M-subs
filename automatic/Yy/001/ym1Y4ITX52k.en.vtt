players<00:01:00.059> and<00:01:00.390> I<00:01:00.629> think<00:01:00.660> part<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.500> might

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
players and I think part of that might

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.830 
players and I think part of that might
be<00:01:02.489> because<00:01:02.670> your<00:01:03.030> sub<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> me<00:01:03.420> and<00:01:03.600> you<00:01:03.690> watch

be because your sub to me and you watch

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.570 
be because your sub to me and you watch
my<00:01:04.049> games<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.589> you<00:01:04.650> know<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:05.159> learn<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.369> bit

for me lightly Scott you know the guy

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.260 
for me lightly Scott you know the guy
played<00:01:07.560> a<00:01:07.590> couple<00:01:07.740> wager<00:01:08.070> matches<00:01:08.220> ago<00:01:08.610> he

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
played a couple wager matches ago he

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.760 
played a couple wager matches ago he
said<00:01:09.479> that<00:01:09.600> he<00:01:09.689> learned<00:01:09.780> a<00:01:09.960> lot<00:01:10.110> about<00:01:10.439> how<00:01:10.710> to

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
said that he learned a lot about how to

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.380 
said that he learned a lot about how to
play<00:01:10.950> this<00:01:11.070> game<00:01:11.250> from<00:01:11.520> watching<00:01:12.000> how<00:01:12.090> I<00:01:12.119> play

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
play this game from watching how I play

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:13.550 
play this game from watching how I play
the<00:01:12.420> game<00:01:12.659> so<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:12.869> think<00:01:13.080> that's<00:01:13.229> kind<00:01:13.409> of<00:01:13.439> cool

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
the game so I think that's kind of cool

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.690 
the game so I think that's kind of cool
something<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.189> never<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.580> considered

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
something I never really considered

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.789 
something I never really considered
actually<00:01:15.390> but<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.689> guess<00:01:15.930> it's<00:01:16.409> true<00:01:16.590> you<00:01:16.710> know

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
actually but I guess it's true you know

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.780 
actually but I guess it's true you know
if<00:01:16.920> you<00:01:16.979> watch<00:01:17.130> my<00:01:17.159> videos<00:01:17.580> you<00:01:17.670> probably

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
if you watch my videos you probably

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.760 
if you watch my videos you probably
picked<00:01:18.630> up<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> couple<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.229> tips<00:01:19.380> just<00:01:19.650> from

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
picked up a couple of tips just from

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.800 
picked up a couple of tips just from
watching<00:01:19.950> my<00:01:20.189> gameplay<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.850> that's<00:01:21.600> good

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
watching my gameplay and that's good

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
watching my gameplay and that's good
that's<00:01:22.020> kind<00:01:22.259> of<00:01:22.290> what<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> point<00:01:22.619> of<00:01:22.740> this

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
that's kind of what the point of this

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.469 
that's kind of what the point of this

whatever works for you to start off I

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.350 
whatever works for you to start off I
mean<00:02:11.220> obviously<00:02:11.400> if<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.910> game<00:02:12.060> starts<00:02:12.299> to

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
mean obviously if the game starts to

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.320 
mean obviously if the game starts to
become<00:02:12.480> a<00:02:12.600> blowout<00:02:12.870> then<00:02:13.940> you<00:02:14.940> won't<00:02:15.120> do<00:02:15.269> that

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
become a blowout then you won't do that

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:23.240 
become a blowout then you won't do that
anymore<00:02:20.989> wow<00:02:21.989> I<00:02:22.380> thought<00:02:22.709> I<00:02:22.739> poke<00:02:23.040> that

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
anymore wow I thought I poke that

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.539 
anymore wow I thought I poke that
actually<00:02:23.760> twice<00:02:24.030> there<00:02:24.390> I<00:02:25.250> don't<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.430> how

00:02:26.539 --> 00:02:26.549 
actually twice there I don't know how

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:27.830 
actually twice there I don't know how
that<00:02:26.580> went<00:02:26.819> through<00:02:26.970> my<00:02:27.000> stick<00:02:27.360> and<00:02:27.569> then<00:02:27.750> he

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
that went through my stick and then he

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.270 
that went through my stick and then he
gets<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.170> floater<00:02:28.380> wrister<00:02:28.799> from<00:02:28.980> distance

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
gets the floater wrister from distance

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.100 
gets the floater wrister from distance
that's<00:02:29.730> what<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:29.910> mean<00:02:30.060> some<00:02:30.599> people<00:02:30.810> consider

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110

glitch<00:02:32.549> no<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:32.790> don't<00:02:33.060> think<00:02:33.120> that's<00:02:33.299> a<00:02:33.450> glitch

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
glitch no I don't think that's a glitch

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.050
