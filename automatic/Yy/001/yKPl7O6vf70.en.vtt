hello<00:00:00.900> and<00:00:01.199> for<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:01.979> this<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.700> a<00:00:02.939> tutorial<00:00:03.449> on

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
hello and for the this is a tutorial on

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.349 
hello and for the this is a tutorial on
different<00:00:04.799> textures<00:00:05.310> on<00:00:05.520> different<00:00:05.910> sides<00:00:06.150> of

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
different textures on different sides of

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.470 
different textures on different sides of
a<00:00:06.480> blog<00:00:06.720> for<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.710> liberty<00:00:08.340> of<00:00:08.519> making<00:00:09.120> this

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
a blog for the liberty of making this

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.249 
a blog for the liberty of making this
tutorial<00:00:10.110> shorter<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.860> simply<00:00:11.849> made<00:00:12.059> blocks<00:00:12.960> at

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
tutorial shorter I simply made blocks at

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.799 
tutorial shorter I simply made blocks at
a<00:00:13.290> time<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.830> this<00:00:13.980> as<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.759> top<00:00:15.030> texture<00:00:15.660> it's

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
a time so this as the top texture it's

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.890 
a time so this as the top texture it's
really<00:00:16.049> simple<00:00:16.369> it's<00:00:17.369> just<00:00:17.820> basic<00:00:19.130> black<00:00:20.130> bloc

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:20.900 
really simple it's just basic black bloc

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.370 
really simple it's just basic black bloc
side<00:00:21.900> and<00:00:22.199> then<00:00:22.890> for<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:23.850> bottom<00:00:24.210> it's<00:00:24.990> a

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
side and then for the bottom it's a

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.170 
side and then for the bottom it's a
simple<00:00:26.539> green<00:00:27.980> block<00:00:29.720> texture<00:00:31.969> all<00:00:32.969> right

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
simple green block texture all right

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.760 
simple green block texture all right
let's<00:00:33.899> code<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:35.219> together<00:00:36.050> so<00:00:37.050> we're

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
let's code this together so we're

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.000 
let's code this together so we're
getting<00:00:37.950> in<00:00:38.219> both<00:00:38.430> your<00:00:39.180> mod<00:00:39.480> tutorial<00:00:40.110> 5<00:00:40.559> and

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
getting in both your mod tutorial 5 and

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.990 
getting in both your mod tutorial 5 and
your<00:00:41.489> block<00:00:41.910> tutorial<00:00:42.840> block<00:00:43.079> file<00:00:44.570> so<00:00:45.950> start

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:47.000 
your block tutorial block file so start

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.400 
your block tutorial block file so start
by<00:00:49.010> start<00:00:50.010> by<00:00:50.480> we<00:00:51.480> have<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.780> declare<00:00:52.140> two

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
by start by we have to declare two

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.529 
by start by we have to declare two
variables<00:00:52.440> so<00:00:53.190> public<00:00:53.780> static<00:00:54.780> int<00:00:56.539> tutorial

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
variables so public static int tutorial

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.900 
variables so public static int tutorial
top<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.850> is<00:01:00.059> basically<00:01:00.590> referencing<00:01:01.590> to

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
top and this is basically referencing to

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:06.020 
top and this is basically referencing to
the<00:01:03.799> override<00:01:04.799> that<00:01:05.430> will<00:01:05.610> be<00:01:05.729> for<00:01:05.909> the

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the override that will be for the

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.880 
the override that will be for the
tutorial<00:01:06.210> taught<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.770> tutorial<00:01:08.240> bottom

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:09.890 
tutorial taught in the tutorial bottom

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.950 
tutorial taught in the tutorial bottom
all<00:01:10.890> right<00:01:11.360> now<00:01:13.430> we<00:01:14.430> need<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:15.180> make<00:01:15.390> these

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
all right now we need to make these

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.830 
all right now we need to make these
variables<00:01:16.950> equal<00:01:17.159> something<00:01:17.850> so<00:01:18.479> we<00:01:18.540> need<00:01:18.689> to

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
variables equal something so we need to

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.590 
variables equal something so we need to
make<00:01:19.049> them<00:01:19.229> equal<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:20.130> override<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:21.420> like

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
make them equal and override just like

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.080 
make them equal and override just like
we<00:01:21.750> did<00:01:21.900> for<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:22.560> main<00:01:22.770> texture<00:01:24.110> so<00:01:26.090> tutorial

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
we did for the main texture so tutorial

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:35.710 
we did for the main texture so tutorial
top<00:01:27.920> equals<00:01:28.920> log<00:01:29.850> voter<00:01:30.299> not<00:01:31.140> add<00:01:31.470> older<00:01:32.310> ride

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.280 

and<00:01:35.810> then<00:01:37.060> obviously<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.660> file<00:01:38.900> we're<00:01:39.140> going

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
and then obviously the file we're going

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.220 
and then obviously the file we're going
to<00:01:39.350> override<00:01:39.950> and<00:01:40.790> then<00:01:41.030> we're<00:01:41.990> going<00:01:42.140> to

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:42.230 
to override and then we're going to

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:48.520 
to override and then we're going to
override<00:01:42.680> it<00:01:42.800> with<00:01:43.630> so<00:01:45.970> terrain<00:01:46.970> dot<00:01:47.840> PNG<00:01:48.140> is

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
override it with so terrain dot PNG is

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.660 
override it with so terrain dot PNG is
well<00:01:48.710> overriding<00:01:49.430> obviously<00:01:50.180> and<00:01:50.510> then<00:01:51.670> the

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
well overriding obviously and then the

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:57.280 
well overriding obviously and then the
directory<00:01:53.240> my<00:01:53.570> block<00:01:54.370> for<00:01:55.370> the<00:01:55.520> block<00:01:55.760> top<00:01:56.290> is

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:57.290 
directory my block for the block top is

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:04.720 
directory my block for the block top is
a<00:01:57.430> mod<00:01:58.870> tutorial<00:01:59.870> block<00:02:01.300> top<00:02:02.410> PNG<00:02:03.410> and<00:02:03.730> line

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:04.730 
a mod tutorial block top PNG and line

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.970 
a mod tutorial block top PNG and line
terminator<00:02:05.300> and<00:02:05.870> that's<00:02:06.110> all<00:02:06.590> there<00:02:06.800> is<00:02:06.860> to

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:06.980 
terminator and that's all there is to

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:08.710 
terminator and that's all there is to
that<00:02:07.100> line<00:02:07.400> and<00:02:07.729> you<00:02:07.910> need<00:02:08.090> to<00:02:08.209> do<00:02:08.330> the<00:02:08.479> same

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
that line and you need to do the same

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.760 
that line and you need to do the same
for<00:02:09.530> a<00:02:09.590> bottom<00:02:10.240> so<00:02:11.240> you<00:02:11.270> can<00:02:11.750> copy<00:02:11.990> paste<00:02:12.440> but<00:02:12.709> I

better that way and then we'll always

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.690 
better that way and then we'll always
need<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.080> go<00:02:18.290> searching<00:02:18.830> to<00:02:18.950> find<00:02:18.980> this<00:02:19.430> kind

need<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.690> write<00:03:02.840> J<00:03:04.239> equals<00:03:05.239> block<00:03:06.549> index<00:03:07.750> and

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
need to write J equals block index and

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:14.920 
need to write J equals block index and
texture<00:03:10.570> lied<00:03:11.570> to<00:03:11.810> me<00:03:12.519> so<00:03:13.519> remember<00:03:13.850> in<00:03:14.180> j<00:03:14.480> here

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:14.930 
texture lied to me so remember in j here

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.020 
texture lied to me so remember in j here
goes<00:03:15.799> with<00:03:16.010> this<00:03:16.220> j<00:03:16.570> now<00:03:18.130> we<00:03:19.130> have<00:03:19.250> to<00:03:19.280> create<00:03:19.970> a

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
goes with this j now we have to create a

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:25.270 
goes with this j now we have to create a
whole<00:03:20.299> new<00:03:20.350> sub<00:03:21.430> called<00:03:22.430> public

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
whole new sub called public

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:37.080 
whole new sub called public
and<00:03:26.200> get<00:03:27.200> lock<00:03:30.459> texture<00:03:31.750> from<00:03:32.750> side<00:03:33.650> and<00:03:34.600> int<00:03:35.600> I

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
and get lock texture from side and int I

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:43.000 
and get lock texture from side and int I
so<00:03:38.090> basically<00:03:38.569> in<00:03:39.370> I<00:03:40.370> is<00:03:40.940> a<00:03:41.750> value<00:03:42.440> of<00:03:42.470> which

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010 
so basically in I is a value of which

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.600 
so basically in I is a value of which
side<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.489> the<00:03:43.640> block<00:03:44.290> is<00:03:45.290> your<00:03:45.590> texture<00:03:46.010> now

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:46.610 
side of the block is your texture now

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:49.809 
side of the block is your texture now
let<00:03:46.760> me<00:03:46.790> just<00:03:47.090> show<00:03:47.180> you<00:03:47.239> some<00:03:47.480> 0<00:03:48.640> equals<00:03:49.640> the

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:49.819 
let me just show you some 0 equals the

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:56.740 
let me just show you some 0 equals the
bottom<00:03:50.209> of<00:03:50.360> the<00:03:50.480> block<00:03:54.100> 1<00:03:55.100> you<00:03:56.030> close<00:03:56.300> the<00:03:56.480> top

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
bottom of the block 1 you close the top

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:04.140 
bottom of the block 1 you close the top
and<00:03:57.350> two<00:03:58.130> day<00:03:58.610> 4<00:03:59.060> and<00:03:59.209> 5<00:03:59.620> equal<00:04:00.620> the<00:04:00.769> sides<00:04:03.040> so

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:04.150 
and two day 4 and 5 equal the sides so

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:08.410 
and two day 4 and 5 equal the sides so
if<00:04:05.150> we<00:04:05.209> make<00:04:05.540> some<00:04:05.750> simple<00:04:06.250> if<00:04:07.420> statements

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
if we make some simple if statements

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.500 
if we make some simple if statements
such<00:04:08.900> as<00:04:08.989> if<00:04:09.610> we're<00:04:10.610> only<00:04:10.700> editing<00:04:11.180> the<00:04:11.269> top

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:11.510 
such as if we're only editing the top

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.000 
such as if we're only editing the top
and<00:04:11.720> bottom<00:04:11.930> we're<00:04:12.380> leaving<00:04:12.500> the<00:04:12.769> sides

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
and bottom we're leaving the sides

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.560 
and bottom we're leaving the sides
normal<00:04:13.670> so<00:04:14.150> if<00:04:14.390> I<00:04:15.519> in<00:04:16.519> other<00:04:16.790> words<00:04:17.030> if<00:04:17.299> it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
normal so if I in other words if it

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.870 
normal so if I in other words if it
equals<00:04:17.720> the<00:04:18.019> top<00:04:18.290> of<00:04:18.530> the<00:04:18.650> block<00:04:18.890> we<00:04:19.549> wanted<00:04:19.820> to

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
equals the top of the block we wanted to

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.550 
equals the top of the block we wanted to
return<00:04:20.620> the<00:04:21.880> variable<00:04:22.880> we've<00:04:23.840> created<00:04:24.139> it<00:04:24.530> the

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
return the variable we've created it the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.629 
return the variable we've created it the
other<00:04:24.800> file<00:04:25.280> called<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.180> torial<00:04:26.660> top<00:04:27.550> so<00:04:28.550> what

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:28.639 
other file called the torial top so what

00:04:28.639 --> 00:04:31.510 
other file called the torial top so what
this<00:04:28.760> is<00:04:28.820> doing<00:04:29.000> is<00:04:29.360> insane<00:04:29.830> our<00:04:30.830> way<00:04:31.460> to

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:31.520 
this is doing is insane our way to

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:36.360 
this is doing is insane our way to
should<00:04:31.910> be<00:04:32.000> a<00:04:32.030> 1-1<00:04:32.450> my<00:04:32.600> doom<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.590> st.<00:04:33.950> if<00:04:35.050> this

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
should be a 1-1 my doom and st. if this

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:41.920 
should be a 1-1 my doom and st. if this
gap<00:04:37.370> block<00:04:37.840> extra<00:04:38.840> from<00:04:39.020> side<00:04:39.380> if<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.820> is<00:04:41.510> equal

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
gap block extra from side if it is equal

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.110 
gap block extra from side if it is equal
to<00:04:42.140> 1<00:04:43.240> then<00:04:44.260> it's<00:04:45.260> going<00:04:45.620> to<00:04:45.740> return<00:04:46.250> the

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:47.120 
to 1 then it's going to return the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.710 
to 1 then it's going to return the
variable<00:04:47.690> we<00:04:47.840> created<00:04:48.229> here<00:04:48.940> which<00:04:49.940> does<00:04:50.390> all

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:50.720 
variable we created here which does all

00:04:50.720 --> 00:05:00.340 
variable we created here which does all
this<00:04:52.539> okay<00:04:53.830> now<00:04:54.970> we<00:04:55.970> have<00:04:56.090> to<00:04:56.240> do<00:04:57.220> if<00:04:58.220> I<00:04:59.350> is

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
this okay now we have to do if I is

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:08.790 
this okay now we have to do if I is
equal<00:05:00.830> to<00:05:01.010> 0<00:05:03.669> we<00:05:04.669> want<00:05:04.940> it<00:05:05.060> to<00:05:05.090> return<00:05:07.390> mod

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:08.800 
equal to 0 we want it to return mod

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.990 
equal to 0 we want it to return mod
tutorial<00:05:09.800> toys<00:05:10.640> and<00:05:11.150> we<00:05:12.080> want<00:05:12.260> it<00:05:12.350> to<00:05:12.669> turn<00:05:13.669> the

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
tutorial toys and we want it to turn the

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:22.530 
tutorial toys and we want it to turn the
variable<00:05:14.570> tutorial<00:05:15.229> bottom<00:05:15.970> so

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:22.540 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:31.650 

so<00:05:23.540> now<00:05:24.670> you're<00:05:25.670> basically<00:05:26.210> done<00:05:27.460> you're

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:31.660 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:34.930 

everything<00:05:32.830> with<00:05:33.830> the<00:05:34.130> exception<00:05:34.160> of<00:05:34.730> one

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:34.940 
everything with the exception of one

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.790 
everything with the exception of one
problem<00:05:35.330> what<00:05:35.660> does<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.990> do<00:05:36.200> for<00:05:36.230> all<00:05:36.590> the

00:05:36.790 --> 00:05:36.800 
problem what does it do for all the

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.570 
problem what does it do for all the
other<00:05:36.980> sides<00:05:37.400> so<00:05:38.300> you<00:05:39.200> could<00:05:39.560> do<00:05:39.890> if<00:05:40.640> i<00:05:41.530> equals

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:42.580 
other sides so you could do if i equals

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:48.790 
other sides so you could do if i equals
2<00:05:43.580> or<00:05:44.300> 3<00:05:44.630> or<00:05:44.660> or<00:05:44.990> or<00:05:45.910> four<00:05:46.910> or<00:05:47.240> five<00:05:47.600> but<00:05:48.440> that's

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:48.800 
2 or 3 or or or four or five but that's

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.780 
2 or 3 or or or four or five but that's
2<00:05:49.100> t's<00:05:49.310> there's<00:05:50.150> a<00:05:50.270> better<00:05:50.450> way<00:05:50.690> to<00:05:50.720> do<00:05:50.930> it<00:05:51.790> all

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:52.790 
2 t's there's a better way to do it all

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:56.440 
2 t's there's a better way to do it all
we<00:05:52.940> have<00:05:53.120> to<00:05:53.180> do<00:05:53.540> is<00:05:54.220> we<00:05:55.220> go<00:05:55.580> up<00:05:55.730> to<00:05:55.880> here<00:05:56.180> at<00:05:56.300> the

00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:56.450 
we have to do is we go up to here at the

00:05:56.450 --> 00:06:00.340 
we have to do is we go up to here at the
end<00:05:56.570> of<00:05:56.660> this<00:05:56.780> bracket<00:05:57.230> we<00:05:57.380> type<00:05:57.620> else<00:05:58.690> so<00:05:59.690> if<00:05:59.960> I

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:00.350 
end of this bracket we type else so if I

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:04.600 
end of this bracket we type else so if I
is<00:06:01.040> equal<00:06:01.460> to<00:06:01.580> any<00:06:01.820> other<00:06:02.210> value<00:06:03.130> we<00:06:04.130> just<00:06:04.370> want

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.610 
is equal to any other value we just want

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:09.400 
is equal to any other value we just want

00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:09.410 
to tour turn lock it ducks in texture in

to tour turn lock it ducks in texture in
other<00:06:09.650> words<00:06:09.980> j<00:06:11.830> now<00:06:13.450> we're<00:06:14.450> free<00:06:15.140> because

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:15.530 
other words j now we're free because

00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.550 
other words j now we're free because
you've<00:06:16.010> got<00:06:16.310> a<00:06:16.370> value<00:06:17.000> for<00:06:17.240> i<00:06:17.570> equals<00:06:18.290> whatever

you've got a value for i equals whatever
i<00:06:18.800> could<00:06:18.980> equal<00:06:19.370> so<00:06:20.150> now<00:06:20.590> if<00:06:21.590> i<00:06:21.770> equals<00:06:22.190> one<00:06:22.340> of

it turns the top if i equal zero it

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:27.700 
it turns the top if i equal zero it
returns<00:06:25.910> bottom<00:06:26.419> texture<00:06:26.930> and<00:06:27.140> if<00:06:27.560> it's

returns bottom texture and if it's

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.770 
returns bottom texture and if it's
anything<00:06:27.979> else<00:06:28.280> besides<00:06:28.490> that<00:06:28.880> and<00:06:29.419> returns

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:29.780 
anything else besides that and returns

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.980 
anything else besides that and returns
normal<00:06:30.380> texture<00:06:30.919> so<00:06:31.460> now<00:06:31.610> i'll<00:06:32.510> pause<00:06:32.750> this

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:32.990 
normal texture so now i'll pause this

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:36.400 
normal texture so now i'll pause this
and<00:06:33.050> get<00:06:33.350> us<00:06:33.500> into<00:06:34.010> our<00:06:34.340> testing<00:06:35.270> area<00:06:35.720> so<00:06:36.320> i

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.410 
and get us into our testing area so i

00:06:36.410 --> 00:06:41.230 
and get us into our testing area so i
can<00:06:36.590> show<00:06:36.830> you<00:06:36.860> what<00:06:37.100> i<00:06:37.160> mean<00:06:39.669> all<00:06:40.669> right<00:06:40.880> so

you see right in front me it's the
normal<00:06:43.370> side<00:06:43.640> texture<00:06:44.330> for<00:06:44.840> tutorial<00:06:45.350> block

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:45.530 
normal side texture for tutorial block

00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:48.700 
normal side texture for tutorial block
if<00:06:45.890> you<00:06:46.250> look<00:06:46.460> above<00:06:46.640> me<00:06:47.120> there's<00:06:47.990> the<00:06:48.290> bottom

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:51.290 
texture for a tutorial block and if you

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:54.130 
texture for a tutorial block and if you
look<00:06:51.470> below<00:06:51.620> me<00:06:52.010> that's<00:06:52.550> the<00:06:52.729> pop<00:06:52.970> texture<00:06:53.600> for

00:06:54.130 --> 00:06:54.140 
look below me that's the pop texture for

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.980 
look below me that's the pop texture for
tutorial<00:06:54.710> block<00:06:55.340> you<00:06:55.910> can<00:06:56.090> see<00:06:56.270> that<00:06:56.450> those

00:06:56.980 --> 00:06:56.990 
tutorial block you can see that those

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:58.960 
tutorial block you can see that those
other<00:06:57.260> Turner<00:06:57.650> box<00:06:57.979> so<00:06:58.460> you<00:06:58.490> can<00:06:58.580> make<00:06:58.790> those

00:06:58.960 --> 00:06:58.970 
other Turner box so you can make those

00:06:58.970 --> 00:07:00.969 
other Turner box so you can make those
look<00:06:59.210> a<00:06:59.300> lot<00:06:59.450> better<00:06:59.690> than<00:06:59.990> just<00:07:00.200> black<00:07:00.950> and

00:07:00.969 --> 00:07:00.979 
look a lot better than just black and

00:07:00.979 --> 00:07:03.100 
look a lot better than just black and
green<00:07:01.460> images<00:07:02.360> but<00:07:02.570> I<00:07:02.630> thought<00:07:02.780> it<00:07:02.900> would<00:07:02.990> be

00:07:03.100 --> 00:07:03.110 
green images but I thought it would be

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:05.860 
green images but I thought it would be
really<00:07:03.380> easy<00:07:03.500> to<00:07:04.070> distinguish<00:07:04.790> if<00:07:05.419> we<00:07:05.630> used

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
really easy to distinguish if we used

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:08.650 
really easy to distinguish if we used
just<00:07:06.440> plain<00:07:06.710> black<00:07:07.370> and<00:07:07.640> green<00:07:07.820> textures<00:07:08.390> for

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:08.660 
just plain black and green textures for

00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:12.280 
just plain black and green textures for
our<00:07:08.810> tutorial<00:07:09.290> block<00:07:09.500> so<00:07:10.100> anyways<00:07:11.050> this<00:07:12.050> has

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:12.290 
our tutorial block so anyways this has

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:13.840 
our tutorial block so anyways this has
been<00:07:12.470> a<00:07:12.530> pretty<00:07:12.830> quick<00:07:13.160> seven<00:07:13.550> minute
