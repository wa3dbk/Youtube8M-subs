overlord is gonna scout all the way on
over<00:01:47.250> here<00:01:47.430> towards<00:01:47.729> rough<00:01:47.939> space<00:01:48.180> so<00:01:48.450> we'll

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
over here towards rough space so we'll

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:50.480 
over here towards rough space so we'll
see<00:01:49.350> where<00:01:49.500> this<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:49.710> gonna<00:01:49.890> wind<00:01:50.100> up<00:01:50.220> he<00:01:50.399> has

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
see where this is gonna wind up he has

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.130 
see where this is gonna wind up he has
taken<00:01:50.790> himself<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.149> gasp<00:01:51.329> of<00:01:51.659> course<00:01:51.810> he<00:01:52.049> is

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
taken himself a gasp of course he is

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.960 
taken himself a gasp of course he is
gonna<00:01:52.290> expand<00:01:52.649> on<00:01:52.770> out<00:01:52.979> this<00:01:53.579> is<00:01:53.759> fairly

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
gonna expand on out this is fairly

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.609 
gonna expand on out this is fairly
normal<00:01:54.180> for<00:01:54.540> him<00:01:54.659> so<00:01:54.810> what<00:01:54.899> we<00:01:55.020> can<00:01:55.110> expect<00:01:55.229> is

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
normal for him so what we can expect is

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.490 
normal for him so what we can expect is
a<00:01:55.700> factory<00:01:56.700> would<00:01:57.450> be<00:01:57.570> supply<00:01:57.869> depot<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.469> a

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
a factory would be supply depot then a

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.499 
a factory would be supply depot then a
factory<00:01:58.979> than<00:01:59.189> a<00:01:59.219> reactor<00:01:59.790> on<00:01:59.969> the<00:02:00.180> barracks

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
factory than a reactor on the barracks

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.410 
factory than a reactor on the barracks
likely<00:02:01.369> judging<00:02:02.369> yeah<00:02:02.729> it's<00:02:02.969> gonna<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.240> that

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
likely judging yeah it's gonna be that

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.209 
likely judging yeah it's gonna be that
build<00:02:03.630> order<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.829> what's<00:02:05.070> gonna

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
build order so that's what's gonna

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.100 
build order so that's what's gonna
switch<00:02:05.549> up<00:02:05.759> man<00:02:05.909> it's<00:02:06.090> pretty<00:02:06.329> close<00:02:06.659> window

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
switch up man it's pretty close window

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.249 
switch up man it's pretty close window
actually<00:02:07.469> how<00:02:07.560> this<00:02:07.680> works<00:02:07.920> out<00:02:09.110> you'll<00:02:10.110> watch

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
actually how this works out you'll watch

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.930 
actually how this works out you'll watch
the<00:02:10.470> timings<00:02:10.860> on<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.250> really<00:02:11.430> fun<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.819> watch

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
the timings on it's really fun to watch

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.700 
the timings on it's really fun to watch
like<00:02:12.390> he<00:02:12.480> can<00:02:12.660> bang<00:02:12.870> this<00:02:12.900> thing

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
like he can bang this thing

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.190 
like he can bang this thing
really<00:02:14.520> really<00:02:14.670> quickly<00:02:15.090> but<00:02:15.270> he<00:02:15.780> uses<00:02:16.110> the

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
really really quickly but he uses the

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.900 
really really quickly but he uses the
factory<00:02:16.620> as<00:02:16.800> well<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.130> the<00:02:17.250> barracks<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.670> shut

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
factory as well as the barracks to shut

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.460 
factory as well as the barracks to shut
down<00:02:17.940> any<00:02:18.240> kind<00:02:18.480> of<00:02:18.570> Scouts<00:02:18.810> nearly<00:02:19.170> game<00:02:19.320> but

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
down any kind of Scouts nearly game but

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.260 
down any kind of Scouts nearly game but
also<00:02:19.590> gives<00:02:19.860> him<00:02:19.980> really<00:02:20.220> forward<00:02:20.520> control<00:02:20.880> of

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
also gives him really forward control of

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.790 
also gives him really forward control of
as<00:02:21.540> natural<00:02:21.690> as<00:02:22.110> well<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.500> he<00:02:22.560> gives<00:02:22.710> them

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
as natural as well because he gives them

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.100 
as natural as well because he gives them
these<00:02:22.980> huge<00:02:23.310> heavy<00:02:23.910> hitting<00:02:24.210> structures<00:02:24.990> up

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
these huge heavy hitting structures up

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.470 
these huge heavy hitting structures up
front<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:25.650> there's<00:02:26.190> the<00:02:26.370> factory<00:02:26.760> and<00:02:27.300> we<00:02:27.360> can

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
front so there's the factory and we can

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.150 
front so there's the factory and we can
expect<00:02:27.780> a<00:02:27.840> reactor<00:02:28.230> to<00:02:28.260> go<00:02:28.440> down<00:02:28.620> on<00:02:28.890> this

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
expect a reactor to go down on this

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.680 
expect a reactor to go down on this

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.430 
over the place and he what he does he
does<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.820> lot<00:03:17.970> of<00:03:18.060> double<00:03:18.330> tapping<00:03:18.510> so<00:03:18.780> he'll

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
does a lot of double tapping so he'll

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.440 
does a lot of double tapping so he'll
set<00:03:19.620> up<00:03:19.709> a<00:03:19.800> structures<00:03:20.160> but<00:03:20.340> then<00:03:20.459> he<00:03:20.820> he<00:03:21.240> hot

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
set up a structures but then he he hot

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.990 
set up a structures but then he he hot
tabs<00:03:21.720> between<00:03:21.930> his<00:03:22.380> units<00:03:22.709> so<00:03:22.920> he<00:03:23.580> sets<00:03:23.820> up<00:03:23.940> his

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
tabs between his units so he sets up his

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.250 
tabs between his units so he sets up his
keys<00:03:24.209> then<00:03:24.390> it'll<00:03:24.570> just<00:03:24.600> bounce<00:03:24.840> back<00:03:25.020> and

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
keys then it'll just bounce back and

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:26.510 
keys then it'll just bounce back and
forth<00:03:25.320> between<00:03:25.560> the<00:03:25.860> structures<00:03:26.250> and<00:03:26.370> stuff

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
forth between the structures and stuff

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.010 
forth between the structures and stuff
like<00:03:26.670> that<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.330> you<00:03:27.420> can<00:03:27.540> see<00:03:27.690> him<00:03:27.780> now<00:03:27.900> he's

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
like that and you can see him now he's

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.600 
like that and you can see him now he's
starting<00:03:28.320> to<00:03:28.350> do<00:03:28.500> that<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:29.010> you'll<00:03:29.310> go<00:03:29.430> back

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
starting to do that and you'll go back

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.920 
starting to do that and you'll go back
and<00:03:29.640> then<00:03:29.910> back<00:03:30.090> over<00:03:30.330> here<00:03:30.570> and<00:03:30.720> then<00:03:30.840> back

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
and then back over here and then back

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:32.120 
and then back over here and then back
over<00:03:31.140> to<00:03:31.200> something<00:03:31.350> else<00:03:31.590> you<00:03:31.680> get<00:03:31.830> the<00:03:31.860> idea

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
over to something else you get the idea

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.890 
over to something else you get the idea
but<00:03:32.970> in<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.150> early<00:03:33.390> game<00:03:33.540> you<00:03:33.570> can<00:03:33.780> actually

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
but in the early game you can actually

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.630 
but in the early game you can actually
watch<00:03:34.170> him<00:03:34.380> it's<00:03:34.530> like<00:03:34.680> you<00:03:34.980> go<00:03:35.190> from<00:03:35.220> one<00:03:35.520> two
