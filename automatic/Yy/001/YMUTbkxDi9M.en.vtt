00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
october october six on saturday and i

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.619 
october october six on saturday and i
think<00:00:50.100> this<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.280> gonna<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> final<00:00:51.270> season

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
think this is gonna be the final season

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.840 
think this is gonna be the final season
because<00:00:51.840> I<00:00:51.960> know<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> bakuman<00:00:52.739> manga<00:00:53.460> end<00:00:53.670> is

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
because I know the bakuman manga end is

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.220 
because I know the bakuman manga end is
so<00:00:54.059> this<00:00:54.270> is<00:00:54.390> most<00:00:54.570> likely<00:00:54.719> gonna<00:00:54.930> be<00:00:55.050> the

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
so this is most likely gonna be the

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.939 
so this is most likely gonna be the
final<00:00:55.590> season<00:00:55.800> so<00:00:57.170> do<00:00:58.170> you<00:00:58.260> guys<00:00:58.410> want<00:00:58.829> to
