with<00:01:43.749> your<00:01:43.869> thumb<00:01:44.049> I<00:01:44.200> said<00:01:49.200> okay<00:01:50.200> next<00:01:50.590> one<00:01:50.829> is

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:51.009 
with your thumb I said okay next one is

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:54.930 
with your thumb I said okay next one is
a<00:01:51.039> one<00:01:51.340> two<00:01:51.429> three

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.440 

okay<00:01:55.940> one<00:01:56.150> two<00:01:56.240> three<00:01:57.370> I'd<00:01:58.370> say<00:01:58.760> if<00:01:59.090> there's

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
okay one two three I'd say if there's

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.820 
okay one two three I'd say if there's
anything<00:01:59.659> you<00:01:59.870> don't<00:01:59.900> have<00:02:00.229> to<00:02:00.320> practice<00:02:00.710> it's

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:00.830 
anything you don't have to practice it's

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.190 
anything you don't have to practice it's
1<00:02:01.040> &amp;<00:02:01.190> 3<00:02:01.220> because<00:02:01.610> those<00:02:02.270> are<00:02:02.450> most<00:02:02.630> naturally

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
1 &amp; 3 because those are most naturally

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.180 
1 &amp; 3 because those are most naturally
strong<00:02:03.590> and<00:02:03.950> agile<00:02:04.310> fingers<00:02:04.670> I<00:02:04.910> can<00:02:05.210> always<00:02:06.190> so

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
strong and agile fingers I can always so

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:08.440 
strong and agile fingers I can always so
you<00:02:07.250> don't<00:02:07.430> just<00:02:07.640> spend<00:02:07.760> a<00:02:07.850> lot<00:02:07.940> of<00:02:07.970> time<00:02:08.090> on<00:02:08.360> it

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
you don't just spend a lot of time on it

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.020 
you don't just spend a lot of time on it
just<00:02:08.830> tried<00:02:09.830> a<00:02:09.860> couple<00:02:10.100> times<00:02:10.280> and<00:02:10.729> move<00:02:10.910> on

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
just tried a couple times and move on

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.150 
just tried a couple times and move on
but<00:02:11.780> then<00:02:11.930> you<00:02:12.290> could<00:02:12.470> stretch<00:02:12.709> it<00:02:12.740> see<00:02:13.070> you

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
but then you could stretch it see you

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:31.300 
but then you could stretch it see you
one<00:02:13.340> two<00:02:13.430> three<00:02:18.520> stretch<00:02:19.520> again<00:02:30.190> all<00:02:31.190> right

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
one two three stretch again all right

00:02:31.310 --> 00:03:04.900 
one two three stretch again all right
then<00:02:32.000> one<00:02:32.209> in<00:02:32.330> four<00:02:32.540> right<00:03:03.190> you<00:03:04.190> have<00:03:04.519> pivot

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
then one in four right you have pivot

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.680 
then one in four right you have pivot
see<00:03:06.280> just<00:03:07.280> got<00:03:07.430> a<00:03:07.459> pivot<00:03:07.820> that's<00:03:08.000> all<00:03:08.120> alright

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
see just got a pivot that's all alright

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.930 
see just got a pivot that's all alright
so<00:03:09.200> that's<00:03:09.380> the<00:03:09.530> ladder<00:03:09.799> right<00:03:10.130> and<00:03:10.370> then<00:03:10.820> we

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:10.940 
so that's the ladder right and then we

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.440 
so that's the ladder right and then we
talked<00:03:11.180> about<00:03:11.360> up<00:03:12.760> making<00:03:13.760> the<00:03:13.850> latter<00:03:14.060> even

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:14.450 
talked about up making the latter even

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.449 
talked about up making the latter even
making<00:03:14.870> your<00:03:14.959> hands<00:03:15.140> even<00:03:15.260> more<00:03:15.620> concentrated

00:03:16.449 --> 00:03:16.459 
making your hands even more concentrated

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:17.440 
making your hands even more concentrated
with<00:03:16.549> technique<00:03:16.910> like<00:03:17.000> putting<00:03:17.239> your<00:03:17.329> two

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:17.450 
with technique like putting your two

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:19.479 
with technique like putting your two
fingers<00:03:17.630> down<00:03:17.959> and<00:03:18.350> holding<00:03:18.980> them<00:03:19.130> down<00:03:19.160> and

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
fingers down and holding them down and

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:26.930 
fingers down and holding them down and
do<00:03:19.579> another
