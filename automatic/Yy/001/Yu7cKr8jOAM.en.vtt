like<00:01:02.910> a<00:01:02.969> spiral<00:01:03.239> thing<00:01:03.629> I<00:01:03.930> don't<00:01:04.080> know<00:01:04.140> it

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
like a spiral thing I don't know it

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:06.070 
like a spiral thing I don't know it
could<00:01:04.320> be<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> secret<00:01:05.129> entry<00:01:05.460> again

something in the water and you driving
on<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> Mongoose<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.009> something

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
on the Mongoose like something

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.880 
on the Mongoose like something
underneath<00:01:56.670> the<00:01:56.880> water<00:01:57.710> here's<00:01:58.710> another

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
underneath the water here's another

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.609 
underneath the water here's another
temple<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.759> this<00:02:00.240> is<00:02:00.420> basically<00:02:00.630> what<00:02:01.290> the

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
temple and this is basically what the

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.249 
temple and this is basically what the
huge<00:02:02.189> temple<00:02:02.640> would<00:02:02.729> be<00:02:02.939> like<00:02:03.570> that's<00:02:03.990> how<00:02:04.140> it

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
huge temple would be like that's how it

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.139 
huge temple would be like that's how it
looks<00:02:04.439> like<00:02:04.649> because<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.490> could<00:02:05.729> like<00:02:05.880> face

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
looks like because you could like face

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:08.660 
looks like because you could like face
stuff<00:02:06.509> or<00:02:06.990> like<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.469> sender<00:02:07.799> parts<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.459> have

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
stuff or like the sender parts and have

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.790 
stuff or like the sender parts and have
like<00:02:08.940> it<00:02:09.119> all<00:02:09.239> like<00:02:09.450> fix<00:02:09.780> and<00:02:10.050> stuff<00:02:10.289> to<00:02:10.649> make

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
like it all like fix and stuff to make

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:12.870 
like it all like fix and stuff to make
it<00:02:11.009> like<00:02:11.280> squares<00:02:11.700> and

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
it like squares and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.760 
it like squares and
so<00:02:13.880> that's<00:02:14.090> an<00:02:14.210> idea<00:02:14.660> for<00:02:14.990> what<00:02:15.020> my<00:02:15.440> first

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
so that's an idea for what my first

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.620 
so that's an idea for what my first
forge<00:02:16.250> is<00:02:16.430> going<00:02:16.610> to<00:02:16.670> be<00:02:16.790> so<00:02:17.090> if<00:02:17.180> it<00:02:17.300> gives<00:02:17.450> you

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:17.630 
forge is going to be so if it gives you

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.890 
forge is going to be so if it gives you
any<00:02:17.840> other<00:02:17.960> ideas<00:02:18.320> that's<00:02:18.650> good
