right<00:00:00.870> well<00:00:01.170> I<00:00:01.199> got<00:00:01.410> time<00:00:01.650> I'll<00:00:01.890> show<00:00:02.070> you<00:00:02.129> how

00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:02.370 
right well I got time I'll show you how

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.450 
right well I got time I'll show you how
I'm<00:00:02.490> going<00:00:02.700> about<00:00:03.080> re<00:00:04.080> welding<00:00:04.470> up<00:00:04.620> the

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
I'm going about re welding up the

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:10.250 
I'm going about re welding up the
section<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.649> the<00:00:07.649> lower<00:00:07.830> plenum<00:00:08.900> you<00:00:09.900> can<00:00:10.019> see

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
section of the lower plenum you can see

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.709 
section of the lower plenum you can see
it<00:00:10.349> is<00:00:10.469> rustle<00:00:11.370> through<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.730> entire<00:00:12.059> entire

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
it is rustle through the entire entire

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:15.140 
it is rustle through the entire entire
part<00:00:13.049> of<00:00:13.200> it<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:13.500> basically<00:00:14.160> my<00:00:14.639> mindset

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
part of it but basically my mindset

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.060 
part of it but basically my mindset
about<00:00:15.389> going<00:00:15.750> about<00:00:15.960> fixing<00:00:16.350> this<00:00:16.560> is<00:00:16.770> I'll

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
about going about fixing this is I'll

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.730 
about going about fixing this is I'll
fix<00:00:17.340> the<00:00:17.520> main<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:18.420> know<00:00:18.449> fix<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.990> outers<00:00:19.439> and

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
fix the main you know fix the outers and

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.560 
fix the main you know fix the outers and
the<00:00:20.460> inner<00:00:20.609> parts<00:00:21.029> will<00:00:21.180> take<00:00:21.330> care<00:00:21.510> of

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
the inner parts will take care of

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.720 
the inner parts will take care of
themself<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.109> what<00:00:22.230> I<00:00:22.260> mean<00:00:22.470> by<00:00:22.529> that<00:00:22.680> is<00:00:23.039> I'm

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
themself and what I mean by that is I'm

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.330 
themself and what I mean by that is I'm
going<00:00:23.760> to<00:00:24.060> first<00:00:24.869> weld<00:00:25.230> on<00:00:25.410> the<00:00:25.529> top<00:00:25.769> fit<00:00:25.980> here

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
going to first weld on the top fit here

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.160 
going to first weld on the top fit here
which<00:00:26.760> is<00:00:26.910> basically<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> top<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.930> inner

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
which is basically the top of the inner

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.820 
which is basically the top of the inner
firewall<00:00:28.680> and<00:00:29.099> then<00:00:29.760> welding<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:31.140> part<00:00:31.410> here

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
firewall and then welding this part here

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.280 
firewall and then welding this part here
basically<00:00:32.759> go<00:00:33.210> from<00:00:33.450> out<00:00:33.570> here<00:00:33.809> all<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> way

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
basically go from out here all the way

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.200 
basically go from out here all the way
to<00:00:34.320> here<00:00:34.739> or<00:00:35.430> even<00:00:35.520> a<00:00:35.700> bit<00:00:35.850> further<00:00:36.829> and<00:00:37.829> then

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.210 
to here or even a bit further and then

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.790 
to here or even a bit further and then
then<00:00:39.210> I've<00:00:39.329> got<00:00:39.510> these<00:00:39.690> sort<00:00:40.079> of<00:00:40.170> main<00:00:40.379> parts

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
then I've got these sort of main parts

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.139 
then I've got these sort of main parts
which<00:00:40.950> are<00:00:41.040> the<00:00:41.160> outer<00:00:41.340> parts<00:00:41.700> of<00:00:41.790> my<00:00:41.879> lines

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
which are the outer parts of my lines

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.529 
which are the outer parts of my lines
and<00:00:42.540> then<00:00:43.200> going<00:00:43.829> through<00:00:44.010> the<00:00:44.129> rest<00:00:44.280> of<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.539> I

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
and then going through the rest of it I

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.720 
and then going through the rest of it I
don't<00:00:46.020> know<00:00:46.110> how<00:00:46.320> far<00:00:46.590> out<00:00:46.829> of<00:00:47.039> this<00:00:47.250> I'm<00:00:47.550> going

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
don't know how far out of this I'm going

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.729 
don't know how far out of this I'm going
to<00:00:47.789> have<00:00:47.910> to<00:00:48.059> come<00:00:48.379> even<00:00:49.379> though<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.590> looks

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
to have to come even though it looks

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.049 
to have to come even though it looks
pretty<00:00:49.950> crappy<00:00:50.160> most<00:00:50.550> of<00:00:50.670> this<00:00:50.730> is<00:00:50.879> pretty

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
pretty crappy most of this is pretty

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.330 
pretty crappy most of this is pretty
solid<00:00:52.760> once<00:00:53.760> I'll<00:00:54.059> go<00:00:54.239> I'll<00:00:54.480> buzz<00:00:54.690> over<00:00:54.899> with<00:00:55.289> a

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:55.340 
solid once I'll go I'll buzz over with a

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.849 
solid once I'll go I'll buzz over with a
with<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.370> rust<00:00:57.120> wheel<00:00:57.390> and<00:00:57.690> probably<00:00:58.199> it'll<00:00:58.320> be

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
with a rust wheel and probably it'll be

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.400 
with a rust wheel and probably it'll be
surprising<00:00:59.430> how<00:00:59.579> much<00:00:59.789> it<00:01:00.359> cleans<00:01:00.690> up<00:01:00.870> and<00:01:01.109> of

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
surprising how much it cleans up and of

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:02.510 
surprising how much it cleans up and of
course<00:01:01.590> I'm<00:01:01.739> going<00:01:01.859> to<00:01:01.949> rush<00:01:02.100> through<00:01:02.280> this

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
course I'm going to rush through this

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.840 
course I'm going to rush through this
with<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> Aqsa<00:01:03.300> Dean<00:01:03.449> and<00:01:03.719> por-15<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:05.070> what<00:01:05.820> I

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
with the Aqsa Dean and por-15 and what I

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
with the Aqsa Dean and por-15 and what I
mean<00:01:06.030> by<00:01:07.520> these<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:08.820> these<00:01:09.439> these<00:01:10.439> rust

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
mean by these things these these rust

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.020 
mean by these things these these rust
wheels<00:01:11.610> or<00:01:12.439> it's<00:01:13.439> trapeze<00:01:13.830> strip<00:01:14.430> ease<00:01:14.580> you

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
wheels or it's trapeze strip ease you

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.340 
wheels or it's trapeze strip ease you
put<00:01:15.210> these<00:01:15.299> on<00:01:15.360> your<00:01:15.630> grinder<00:01:16.020> you<00:01:16.110> can<00:01:16.229> also

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
put these on your grinder you can also

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.920 
put these on your grinder you can also
get<00:01:16.590> ones<00:01:16.799> for<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.070> drill<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.750> these<00:01:18.750> will

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
get ones for your drill and these will

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.740 
get ones for your drill and these will
take<00:01:19.140> off<00:01:19.400> surface<00:01:20.400> rust<00:01:20.640> and<00:01:21.030> paint<00:01:21.240> and<00:01:21.659> all

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
take off surface rust and paint and all

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
take off surface rust and paint and all
that<00:01:21.930> other<00:01:22.080> stuff<00:01:22.200> but<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.590> won't<00:01:22.740> touch<00:01:22.860> the

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
that other stuff but it won't touch the

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
that other stuff but it won't touch the
middle<00:01:23.369> it'll<00:01:23.970> touch<00:01:24.270> a<00:01:24.299> very<00:01:24.659> little<00:01:24.930> anyway

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
middle it'll touch a very little anyway

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.710 
middle it'll touch a very little anyway
so<00:01:25.290> these<00:01:25.860> things<00:01:26.040> are<00:01:26.189> perfect<00:01:26.610> so<00:01:27.180> clean<00:01:27.570> up

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
so these things are perfect so clean up

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.020 
so these things are perfect so clean up
all<00:01:27.869> this<00:01:28.020> before<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.470> rust<00:01:28.710> proof<00:01:28.770> but<00:01:29.130> what

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
all this before a rust proof but what

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.850 
all this before a rust proof but what
I've<00:01:30.150> done<00:01:30.299> with<00:01:30.509> this<00:01:30.630> section<00:01:31.079> is<00:01:31.200> of<00:01:31.350> our

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
I've done with this section is of our

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.370 
I've done with this section is of our
bases<00:01:32.520> I've<00:01:32.670> got<00:01:33.270> this<00:01:33.450> piece<00:01:33.990> of<00:01:34.140> metal<00:01:34.229> here

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
bases I've got this piece of metal here

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920 
bases I've got this piece of metal here
which<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.920> cut<00:01:35.189> out<00:01:35.220> of<00:01:35.549> the<00:01:36.270> lower<00:01:36.479> part<00:01:36.750> of

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
which I cut out of the lower part of

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.530 
which I cut out of the lower part of
this<00:01:37.079> old<00:01:37.409> Ford<00:01:37.829> boot<00:01:38.189> to<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.240> in<00:01:39.390> here<00:01:39.659> so

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540 
this old Ford boot to go in here so

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.929 
this old Ford boot to go in here so
that's<00:01:42.540> it<00:01:42.840> they're<00:01:43.220> kind<00:01:44.220> of<00:01:44.340> perfect<00:01:44.490> most

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
that's it they're kind of perfect most

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.179 
that's it they're kind of perfect most
of<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.149> basic<00:01:45.479> line<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:45.990> stone<00:01:46.229> on<00:01:47.009> each

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
of the basic line to the stone on each

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:48.770 
of the basic line to the stone on each
side<00:01:47.490> I've<00:01:47.700> got<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.210> waiting<00:01:48.570> for<00:01:48.630> this

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
side I've got and just waiting for this

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.350 
side I've got and just waiting for this
to<00:01:48.840> dry<00:01:49.079> I've<00:01:49.320> got<00:01:49.530> weld<00:01:49.770> through<00:01:49.950> primer<00:01:50.360> so

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
to dry I've got weld through primer so

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.149 
to dry I've got weld through primer so
it<00:01:51.810> shouldn't<00:01:52.110> rush<00:01:52.380> them<00:01:52.560> between<00:01:52.770> the<00:01:52.950> join

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
it shouldn't rush them between the join

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.580 
it shouldn't rush them between the join
there<00:01:53.399> I'll<00:01:53.640> take<00:01:54.000> the<00:01:54.149> two<00:01:54.329> parts<00:01:54.750> and<00:01:55.020> then

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
there I'll take the two parts and then

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.490 
there I'll take the two parts and then
I'll<00:01:55.710> actually<00:01:55.890> put<00:01:56.250> away<00:01:56.810> put<00:01:57.810> away<00:01:58.049> spot<00:01:58.350> way

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
I'll actually put away put away spot way

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.910 
I'll actually put away put away spot way
out<00:01:58.560> here<00:01:58.799> just<00:01:59.040> like<00:01:59.130> the<00:01:59.280> factory<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:01.530> the

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
out here just like the factory the the

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.590 
out here just like the factory the the
slop<00:02:02.219> right<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.640> is<00:02:02.759> actually<00:02:03.060> spot<00:02:03.299> welds

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
slop right here is actually spot welds

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.270 
slop right here is actually spot welds
here<00:02:03.750> so<00:02:04.020> I'll<00:02:04.290> do<00:02:04.500> it<00:02:04.560> back<00:02:04.740> here<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.009> used<00:02:05.159> to

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
here so I'll do it back here it used to

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.490 
here so I'll do it back here it used to
be<00:02:05.369> and<00:02:05.640> then<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.750> end<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> the<00:02:07.020> day<00:02:07.170> when<00:02:07.380> I've

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
be and then the end of the day when I've

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.279 
be and then the end of the day when I've
done<00:02:07.649> all<00:02:07.799> my<00:02:07.829> welding<00:02:08.250> I'll<00:02:08.459> go<00:02:08.640> through<00:02:09.289> put

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
done all my welding I'll go through put

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.370 
done all my welding I'll go through put
some<00:02:10.440> oxygen<00:02:10.530> on<00:02:11.069> it<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.550> overnight

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
some oxygen on it so overnight

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.180 
some oxygen on it so overnight
won't<00:02:12.550> find<00:02:13.550> rust<00:02:13.850> yeah<00:02:14.780> so<00:02:15.050> I'll<00:02:15.680> give

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:16.190 
won't find rust yeah so I'll give

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:17.590 
won't find rust yeah so I'll give
another<00:02:16.310> part<00:02:16.850> of<00:02:16.940> this<00:02:17.000> video<00:02:17.210> we're<00:02:17.570> not

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
another part of this video we're not

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.690 
another part of this video we're not
finished<00:02:17.960> doing<00:02:18.110> up<00:02:18.290> the<00:02:18.410> tech<00:02:18.620> world<00:02:18.800> all

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
finished doing up the tech world all

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:21.580 
finished doing up the tech world all
right<00:02:19.760> there<00:02:20.330> we<00:02:20.450> go<00:02:20.480> just<00:02:20.900> tell<00:02:21.020> wanted<00:02:21.440> it

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:21.590 
right there we go just tell wanted it

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.180 
right there we go just tell wanted it
got<00:02:22.040> two<00:02:22.340> spot<00:02:22.640> welds<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:24.620> what<00:02:24.920> we're<00:02:25.100> doing

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:25.190 
got two spot welds here what we're doing

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.880 
got two spot welds here what we're doing
as<00:02:25.550> a<00:02:25.580> plumber<00:02:25.880> and<00:02:26.420> I've<00:02:26.810> just<00:02:27.020> tacked<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.560> on

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:27.890 
as a plumber and I've just tacked it on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.580 
as a plumber and I've just tacked it on
this<00:02:28.160> edge<00:02:28.370> here<00:02:28.480> and<00:02:29.480> I'll<00:02:29.810> finish<00:02:30.230> up<00:02:30.500> the

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
this edge here and I'll finish up the

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.680 
this edge here and I'll finish up the
seam<00:02:30.800> down<00:02:31.070> to<00:02:31.190> this<00:02:31.280> bottom<00:02:31.490> corner<00:02:31.690> not

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
seam down to this bottom corner not

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.270 
seam down to this bottom corner not
going<00:02:32.930> along<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.320> bottom<00:02:33.350> here<00:02:33.650> because<00:02:34.130> all

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
going along the bottom here because all

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.680 
going along the bottom here because all
this<00:02:34.490> is<00:02:34.700> all<00:02:34.850> rusty<00:02:35.270> and<00:02:35.360> I'll<00:02:35.480> probably

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
this is all rusty and I'll probably

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.740 
this is all rusty and I'll probably
replace<00:02:36.170> this<00:02:37.120> so<00:02:38.120> I'll<00:02:38.240> have<00:02:38.360> to<00:02:38.480> make<00:02:38.600> an

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
replace this so I'll have to make an

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.740 
replace this so I'll have to make an
entire<00:02:39.020> new<00:02:39.260> piece<00:02:39.500> for<00:02:39.530> this<00:02:39.830> top<00:02:40.070> part<00:02:40.310> but

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
entire new piece for this top part but

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:44.470 
entire new piece for this top part but
yeah<00:02:41.750> gotta<00:02:42.110> start<00:02:42.380> somewhere<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.480> it's

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:44.480 
yeah gotta start somewhere so it's

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.110 
yeah gotta start somewhere so it's
finished<00:02:44.750> products<00:02:45.200> I've<00:02:45.850> finished<00:02:46.850> welding

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
finished products I've finished welding

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.680 
finished products I've finished welding
up<00:02:47.360> this<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:48.440> section<00:02:48.890> here<00:02:49.250> I<00:02:49.850> actually<00:02:50.330> had

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
up this the section here I actually had

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:53.440 
up this the section here I actually had
to<00:02:50.810> go<00:02:50.990> a<00:02:51.430> lot<00:02:52.430> deeper<00:02:52.640> into<00:02:53.090> it<00:02:53.210> then<00:02:53.360> I

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
to go a lot deeper into it then I

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.470 
to go a lot deeper into it then I
thought<00:02:53.720> I<00:02:53.750> would<00:02:54.020> have<00:02:54.170> to<00:02:55.210> underneath<00:02:56.210> here

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
thought I would have to underneath here

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.390 
thought I would have to underneath here
I<00:02:56.510> actually<00:02:56.780> had<00:02:57.170> to<00:02:57.290> go<00:02:57.440> in<00:02:57.650> and<00:02:57.890> make<00:02:58.040> another

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
I actually had to go in and make another

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.020 
I actually had to go in and make another
peaceful<00:02:58.700> sort<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.270> the<00:02:59.330> lower<00:02:59.540> part<00:02:59.870> of<00:03:00.110> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
peaceful sort of the lower part of the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.340 
peaceful sort of the lower part of the
main<00:03:02.030> part<00:03:02.300> of<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.420> foil<00:03:02.690> here

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:03.350 
main part of the foil here

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:05.530 
main part of the foil here
it<00:03:03.950> was<00:03:04.100> just<00:03:04.280> rusted<00:03:04.670> and<00:03:04.700> beneath<00:03:05.000> it<00:03:05.180> so<00:03:05.210> I

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 
it was just rusted and beneath it so I

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.840 
it was just rusted and beneath it so I
really<00:03:05.840> had<00:03:05.960> to<00:03:05.990> get<00:03:06.170> in<00:03:06.320> and<00:03:06.500> get<00:03:06.650> it<00:03:06.770> but<00:03:07.730> I've

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
really had to get in and get it but I've

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:09.460 
really had to get in and get it but I've
just<00:03:07.880> put<00:03:08.210> a<00:03:08.240> bit<00:03:08.420> of<00:03:08.510> rust<00:03:08.690> converter<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.290> it

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:09.470 
just put a bit of rust converter on it

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:11.440 
just put a bit of rust converter on it
so<00:03:09.650> let<00:03:09.860> that<00:03:09.890> sit<00:03:10.310> between<00:03:10.490> four<00:03:10.910> hours<00:03:11.150> and

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:11.450 
so let that sit between four hours and

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:16.210 
so let that sit between four hours and
then<00:03:11.600> trucks<00:03:12.500> and<00:03:12.760> por-15<00:03:13.760> on<00:03:14.210> it<00:03:14.360> and<00:03:15.220> even

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
then trucks and por-15 on it and even

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:17.380 
then trucks and por-15 on it and even
though<00:03:16.460> I<00:03:16.490> haven't<00:03:16.760> been<00:03:17.000> really<00:03:17.270> that

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
though I haven't been really that

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.810 
though I haven't been really that
careful<00:03:17.900> with<00:03:18.050> how<00:03:18.980> to<00:03:19.040> pet<00:03:19.370> wear<00:03:19.640> how<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:19.820 
careful with how to pet wear how the

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:21.910 
careful with how to pet wear how the
diff<00:03:20.060> separate<00:03:20.660> patch<00:03:20.840> panels<00:03:21.350> have<00:03:21.470> been<00:03:21.710> put

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:21.920 
diff separate patch panels have been put

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:31.880 
going to be seen so I wasn't too worried

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.260 
going to be seen so I wasn't too worried
about<00:03:31.940> it

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270

came<00:03:34.250> out<00:03:34.280> so<00:03:35.050> there's<00:03:36.050> one<00:03:36.320> two<00:03:37.190> three<00:03:38.170> four

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
came out so there's one two three four

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:42.970 
came out so there's one two three four
five<00:03:39.980> syrupy<00:03:40.550> two<00:03:41.390> three<00:03:41.990> four<00:03:42.260> five<00:03:42.530> secret

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
five syrupy two three four five secret

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:45.310 
five syrupy two three four five secret
pieces<00:03:43.370> that<00:03:44.060> make<00:03:44.300> up<00:03:44.450> this<00:03:44.600> top<00:03:44.840> end<00:03:45.050> on<00:03:45.110> here

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
pieces that make up this top end on here

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.890 
pieces that make up this top end on here
and<00:03:45.410> another<00:03:45.590> couple<00:03:45.830> on<00:03:46.040> the<00:03:46.130> bottom<00:03:46.780> so<00:03:47.780> on

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:47.900 
and another couple on the bottom so on

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:49.240 
and another couple on the bottom so on
the<00:03:47.990> other<00:03:48.140> side<00:03:48.440> it's<00:03:48.680> actually<00:03:48.980> a<00:03:49.010> slightly

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
the other side it's actually a slightly

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:55.960 
the other side it's actually a slightly
different<00:03:49.459> case<00:03:49.820> here<00:03:53.560> the<00:03:54.560> other<00:03:55.459> side<00:03:55.790> of

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:55.970 
different case here the other side of

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:57.699 
different case here the other side of
the<00:03:56.060> plenum<00:03:56.420> is<00:03:56.510> actually<00:03:56.750> different<00:03:56.959> sits<00:03:57.530> up

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709 
the plenum is actually different sits up

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:59.320 
the plenum is actually different sits up
a<00:03:57.830> lot<00:03:57.980> further<00:03:58.190> up<00:03:58.430> here<00:03:58.670> and<00:03:59.180> we've<00:03:59.300> got

00:03:59.320 --> 00:03:59.330 
a lot further up here and we've got

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.150 
a lot further up here and we've got
rusting<00:03:59.810> mainly<00:04:00.170> in<00:04:00.230> the<00:04:00.320> top<00:04:00.500> part<00:04:00.740> of<00:04:00.770> this<00:04:00.920> I

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
rusting mainly in the top part of this I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.250 
rusting mainly in the top part of this I
have<00:04:01.760> already<00:04:02.000> had<00:04:02.300> to<00:04:02.360> put<00:04:02.600> a<00:04:02.630> small<00:04:02.959> amount

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:03.260 
have already had to put a small amount

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.980 
have already had to put a small amount
and<00:04:03.670> the<00:04:04.670> bottom<00:04:05.150> of<00:04:05.240> the<00:04:05.300> pillar<00:04:05.540> here<00:04:05.810> I

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:05.990 
and the bottom of the pillar here I

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:07.330 
and the bottom of the pillar here I
didn't<00:04:06.290> think<00:04:06.410> I'd<00:04:06.590> have<00:04:06.709> to<00:04:06.770> but<00:04:07.040> I<00:04:07.100> did<00:04:07.160> I

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
didn't think I'd have to but I did I

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.790 
didn't think I'd have to but I did I
usually<00:04:07.730> have<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.910> do<00:04:08.030> on<00:04:08.180> the<00:04:08.270> other<00:04:08.390> side<00:04:08.800> but

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
usually have to do on the other side but

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.680 
usually have to do on the other side but
this<00:04:09.890> bit<00:04:10.160> should<00:04:10.400> be<00:04:10.520> not<00:04:10.700> too<00:04:10.880> bad

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
this bit should be not too bad

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.810 
this bit should be not too bad
to<00:04:12.170> make<00:04:12.350> up<00:04:12.560> I'll<00:04:12.800> do<00:04:12.950> one<00:04:13.190> bit<00:04:13.370> on<00:04:13.400> the<00:04:13.580> top

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:13.820 
to make up I'll do one bit on the top

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.960 
to make up I'll do one bit on the top
I'll<00:04:14.690> probably<00:04:15.050> do<00:04:15.350> a<00:04:15.620> small<00:04:16.100> bit<00:04:16.489> for<00:04:16.700> the<00:04:16.760> top

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
I'll probably do a small bit for the top

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:20.349 
I'll probably do a small bit for the top
of<00:04:17.150> this<00:04:17.330> part<00:04:17.680> one<00:04:18.680> here<00:04:19.010> in<00:04:19.190> the<00:04:19.520> trial<00:04:20.180> would

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
of this part one here in the trial would

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.940 
of this part one here in the trial would
have<00:04:20.419> finish<00:04:20.720> it<00:04:20.900> off<00:04:21.020> here<00:04:21.320> and<00:04:21.440> there<00:04:21.830> will

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:21.950 
have finish it off here and there will

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.430 
have finish it off here and there will
be<00:04:21.979> this<00:04:22.190> side<00:04:22.430> all<00:04:22.550> kind<00:04:22.760> of<00:04:22.790> stuff<00:04:23.030> so<00:04:23.440> let's

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
be this side all kind of stuff so let's

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.230 
be this side all kind of stuff so let's
have<00:04:24.590> them<00:04:24.680> get<00:04:24.830> Norrland<00:04:25.220> so

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 
have them get Norrland so

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:27.969 
have them get Norrland so
hopefully<00:04:26.990> should<00:04:27.169> have<00:04:27.259> this<00:04:27.409> one<00:04:27.680> finished

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
hopefully should have this one finished

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.129 
hopefully should have this one finished
up<00:04:28.250> in<00:04:28.370> the<00:04:28.430> next<00:04:28.610> day<00:04:28.759> or<00:04:28.879> two<00:04:28.990> since<00:04:29.990> I've

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:30.139 
up in the next day or two since I've

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:31.540 
up in the next day or two since I've
only<00:04:30.379> sort<00:04:30.590> of<00:04:30.650> got<00:04:30.770> the<00:04:30.889> evenings<00:04:31.250> where<00:04:31.460> I'm

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
only sort of got the evenings where I'm

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.409
