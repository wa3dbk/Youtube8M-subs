00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
not that really helps the baby through

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
not that really helps the baby through
the<00:01:58.229> breast<00:01:58.439> milk<00:01:58.710> and<00:01:59.280> in<00:01:59.369> fact<00:01:59.549> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.729> look

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the breast milk and in fact if you look

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.990 
the breast milk and in fact if you look
at<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.060> lot<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> gripe<00:02:00.680> water<00:02:01.680> recipes<00:02:02.490> for

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
at a lot of gripe water recipes for

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.639 
at a lot of gripe water recipes for
babies<00:02:03.329> they<00:02:03.600> include<00:02:04.020> with<00:02:04.259> some<00:02:04.409> of<00:02:04.500> those

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
babies they include with some of those

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.859 
babies they include with some of those
teas<00:02:05.009> or<00:02:05.310> some<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.520> those<00:02:05.579> ingredients<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.810> I

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
teas or some of those ingredients so I

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:08.510 
teas or some of those ingredients so I
think<00:02:06.960> that's<00:02:07.200> helping<00:02:07.439> to<00:02:07.530> calm<00:02:07.799> her<00:02:08.039> stomach

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
think that's helping to calm her stomach

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.800 
think that's helping to calm her stomach
and<00:02:08.670> I've<00:02:08.729> also<00:02:08.879> been<00:02:09.119> giving<00:02:09.390> her<00:02:09.479> a<00:02:09.509> lot<00:02:09.690> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
and I've also been giving her a lot of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.809 
and I've also been giving her a lot of
probiotics<00:02:10.470> so<00:02:11.009> I<00:02:11.039> think<00:02:11.099> the<00:02:11.250> combination<00:02:11.430> of

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
probiotics so I think the combination of

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:13.680 
probiotics so I think the combination of
everything<00:02:12.060> she's<00:02:12.599> doing<00:02:12.810> so<00:02:13.110> much<00:02:13.290> better

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
everything she's doing so much better

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.780 
everything she's doing so much better
she<00:02:13.870> just<00:02:14.020> seems<00:02:14.200> happier<00:02:14.830> and<00:02:15.160> this<00:02:15.520> week<00:02:15.700> has

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
she just seems happier and this week has

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:16.830 
she just seems happier and this week has

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.130 
because frankly I think it stole some of

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.940 
because frankly I think it stole some of
the<00:03:45.280> joy<00:03:45.580> of<00:03:45.610> parenting<00:03:46.480> I<00:03:46.510> didn't<00:03:47.200> enjoy<00:03:47.890> it

the joy of parenting I didn't enjoy it

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.350 
the joy of parenting I didn't enjoy it
as<00:03:48.130> much<00:03:48.280> as<00:03:48.400> I<00:03:48.519> could<00:03:48.760> have<00:03:48.850> because<00:03:49.120> I<00:03:49.239> was

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:49.360 
as much as I could have because I was

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.750 
as much as I could have because I was
worrying<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.930> lot<00:03:50.080> so<00:03:50.830> that's<00:03:51.280> been<00:03:51.430> a<00:03:51.459> really

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
worrying a lot so that's been a really

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:54.150 
worrying a lot so that's been a really
big<00:03:52.480> revelation<00:03:53.110> for<00:03:53.290> me<00:03:53.320> I<00:03:53.650> think<00:03:53.860> the<00:03:53.980> other

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
big revelation for me I think the other

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.220 
big revelation for me I think the other
thing<00:03:54.430> is<00:03:54.550> it's<00:03:54.700> just<00:03:54.820> been<00:03:54.970> a<00:03:55.000> herd<00:03:55.450> a<00:03:55.720> couple
