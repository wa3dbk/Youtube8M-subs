00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:54.560
 I was twice extremely cushioned 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.610

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.000
 That's why I'm on Wednesday 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.610

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.990
 societies 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.299
 Percent that was so prevails but and they have therefore shared 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.230

00:02:07.230 --> 00:02:11.250

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:15.459
 I fetched the full hour Moliere with the low threatened 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.829
 because after Parma Train stayed short of the demolition 

00:02:20.729 --> 00:02:25.039

00:02:40.509 --> 00:02:41.739
 from the reeds 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:45.290
 There are so few trees tuned in. Water looks good 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.829
