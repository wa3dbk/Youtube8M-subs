00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
let's talk let's see some progressions I

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:07.340 
let's talk let's see some progressions I
want<00:00:06.660> to<00:00:06.720> start<00:00:06.870> putting<00:00:07.049> up<00:00:07.140> some

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
want to start putting up some

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.410 
want to start putting up some
progressions<00:00:07.799> and<00:00:08.069> slowly<00:00:08.760> building<00:00:09.150> towards

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:09.420 
progressions and slowly building towards

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.780 
progressions and slowly building towards
some<00:00:09.510> actual<00:00:09.780> choreographies<00:00:10.460> which<00:00:11.460> slowly

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
some actual choreographies which slowly

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.480 
some actual choreographies which slowly
builds<00:00:12.150> towards<00:00:12.630> some<00:00:13.049> giant<00:00:13.860> pulley<00:00:14.190> flash

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
builds towards some giant pulley flash

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.340 
builds towards some giant pulley flash
mobs<00:00:14.900> some<00:00:15.900> are<00:00:16.049> cool

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
mobs some are cool

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.740 
mobs some are cool
I'm<00:00:17.070> step<00:00:17.279> by<00:00:17.369> step<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:18.270> we'll<00:00:18.510> see<00:00:18.630> how<00:00:18.690> far

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
I'm step by step and we'll see how far

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.470 
I'm step by step and we'll see how far
we<00:00:18.990> get<00:00:19.080> with<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.350> dream<00:00:20.119> so<00:00:21.119> we're<00:00:21.240> going<00:00:21.359> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
we get with that dream so we're going to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:23.150 
we get with that dream so we're going to
put<00:00:21.720> together<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:22.050> sequence<00:00:22.470> of<00:00:22.560> split<00:00:22.949> time

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
put together a sequence of split time

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.400 
put together a sequence of split time
same<00:00:23.580> direction<00:00:23.760> moves<00:00:24.119> and<00:00:24.689> it<00:00:25.260> certainly

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
same direction moves and it certainly

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.000 
same direction moves and it certainly
look<00:00:25.560> like<00:00:25.590> this

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
look like this

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.390 
look like this
it's<00:00:26.250> gonna<00:00:26.369> go<00:00:26.550> from<00:00:26.699> forwards<00:00:27.090> weave<00:00:28.400> into

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
it's gonna go from forwards weave into

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.659 
it's gonna go from forwards weave into
4x4<00:00:30.119> fountain<00:00:30.920> into<00:00:31.920> turning<00:00:32.399> the<00:00:32.489> weaves

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
4x4 fountain into turning the weaves

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:36.440 
4x4 fountain into turning the weaves
high-low<00:00:33.210> into<00:00:34.200> opening<00:00:34.649> to<00:00:34.829> whirling<00:00:35.370> it's<00:00:36.360> a

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
high-low into opening to whirling it's a

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.290 
high-low into opening to whirling it's a
lockout<00:00:36.840> lockout<00:00:38.210> into<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.390> closing<00:00:39.840> into

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.300 
lockout lockout into and closing into

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.139 
lockout lockout into and closing into
crossers<00:00:42.920> yeah<00:00:43.920> cool<00:00:44.489> we're<00:00:44.820> gonna<00:00:44.910> do<00:00:45.030> that

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
crossers yeah cool we're gonna do that

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.830 
crossers yeah cool we're gonna do that
so<00:00:46.579> first<00:00:47.579> off<00:00:47.820> you<00:00:48.059> need<00:00:48.270> each<00:00:48.510> of<00:00:48.719> those

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
so first off you need each of those

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.979 
so first off you need each of those
moves<00:00:49.160> so<00:00:50.539> again<00:00:51.539> it's<00:00:51.989> forward<00:00:52.710> weave<00:00:53.989> into

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
moves so again it's forward weave into

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.680 
moves so again it's forward weave into
4x4<00:00:55.829> fountain<00:00:57.440> turning<00:00:58.440> in<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.620> weave

00:00:59.680 --> 00:00:59.690 
4x4 fountain turning in the weave

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.410 
4x4 fountain turning in the weave
opening<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.840> a<00:01:00.870> world<00:01:01.940> lock<00:01:02.940> up

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
opening to a world lock up

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.840 
opening to a world lock up
lockout<00:01:04.430> crosser<00:01:06.770> if<00:01:07.770> you<00:01:07.920> know<00:01:08.100> them<00:01:08.340> let's

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
lockout crosser if you know them let's

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.250 
lockout crosser if you know them let's
look<00:01:09.000> at<00:01:09.090> how<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.240> put<00:01:09.390> them<00:01:09.479> together<00:01:09.570> so

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:12.260 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.660 

beginning<00:01:13.260> is<00:01:13.409> easy<00:01:13.470> beginning<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.220> say<00:01:14.369> 4

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
beginning is easy beginning to say 4

so you a Fords weave from here you just

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.510 
so you a Fords weave from here you just
turn<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.320> backwards<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.920> go<00:01:26.009> right<00:01:26.280> into<00:01:26.310> the

forwards turn your right into the 4x4

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.890 
forwards turn your right into the 4x4
and<00:01:33.930> from<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.290> 4x4<00:01:35.040> as<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.180> rights<00:01:36.570> going

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
and from the 4x4 as the rights going

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.090

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
from fo i-4 that's the right goes under

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.050 
from fo i-4 that's the right goes under
just<00:01:46.710> turn<00:01:47.009> the<00:01:47.220> weaves<00:01:47.630> back<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.840> 4x4

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
just turn the weaves back to the 4x4

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.450 
just turn the weaves back to the 4x4
just<00:01:51.060> turn<00:01:51.299> normally<00:01:51.780> in<00:01:51.869> the<00:01:51.960> weaves<00:01:52.460> into

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
just turn normally in the weaves into

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.760 
just turn normally in the weaves into
the<00:01:53.520> 4<00:01:53.729> by<00:01:53.880> far<00:01:54.259> this<00:01:55.259> is<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.470> right<00:01:55.619> course

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
the 4 by far this is the right course

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
the 4 by far this is the right course
under<00:01:55.979> that's<00:01:56.100> your<00:01:56.280> backward<00:01:56.579> weave<00:01:56.930> keep

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
under that's your backward weave keep

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:59.319 
under that's your backward weave keep
turning<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.320> your<00:01:58.409> left<00:01:58.560> forwards<00:01:59.070> we've

00:01:59.319 --> 00:01:59.329 
turning to your left forwards we've

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.090 
turning to your left forwards we've
talked<00:02:00.329> in<00:02:00.509> threes<00:02:00.719> all<00:02:01.439> you're<00:02:01.770> going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> do

talked in threes all you're going to do

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.530 
talked in threes all you're going to do
is<00:02:02.369> from<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> far<00:02:02.759> before<00:02:02.880> instead<00:02:03.299> of<00:02:03.390> just

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
is from the far before instead of just

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:08.639 
is from the far before instead of just
turning<00:02:05.240> neutral<00:02:06.240> in<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.420> weaves

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.589 

as<00:02:09.069> you<00:02:09.340> turn<00:02:09.489> to<00:02:09.700> the<00:02:10.060> backwards<00:02:10.360> if<00:02:10.509> you're

00:02:10.589 --> 00:02:10.599 
as you turn to the backwards if you're

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.050 
as you turn to the backwards if you're
going<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> go<00:02:10.840> high<00:02:11.069> back<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.190> the<00:02:12.280> low<00:02:12.489> back<00:02:12.910> to

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
going to go high back to the low back to

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:18.830 
going to go high back to the low back to
the<00:02:13.150> 4x4<00:02:14.550> over<00:02:15.550> the<00:02:15.640> top<00:02:15.959> past<00:02:16.959> the<00:02:17.080> toes<00:02:17.290> 4x4

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:22.770 
the 4x4 over the top past the toes 4x4
then<00:02:20.310> as<00:02:21.310> you're<00:02:21.489> coming<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.849> from<00:02:22.090> this<00:02:22.450> as

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
then as you're coming on from this as

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.789 
then as you're coming on from this as
your<00:02:23.230> lift<00:02:23.830> boy<00:02:24.160> comes<00:02:24.700> back<00:02:24.970> on<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:26.260> far<00:02:26.530> side

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
your lift boy comes back on the far side

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
through the second circle the right goes

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:14.819 
through the second circle the right goes
under<00:03:14.500> it

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
under it

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:20.640 
under it
to<00:03:15.370> get<00:03:15.519> to<00:03:15.639> there<00:03:17.190> so<00:03:18.190> we<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.430> do<00:03:18.579> just<00:03:19.650> let's

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
to get to there so we can do just let's

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:27.240 
to get to there so we can do just let's
let's<00:03:21.459> go<00:03:21.700> from<00:03:23.549> here<00:03:25.709> your<00:03:26.709> left<00:03:26.889> comes

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
let's go from here your left comes

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:33.120 
let's go from here your left comes
around<00:03:27.609> right<00:03:28.079> goes<00:03:29.079> under<00:03:31.859> left<00:03:32.859> is<00:03:33.040> the

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
around right goes under left is the

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.150 
around right goes under left is the
second<00:03:33.459> circle<00:03:33.730> right<00:03:33.940> goes<00:03:34.180> under<00:03:35.010> so<00:03:36.010> make

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
second circle right goes under so make

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:41.250 
second circle right goes under so make
sense<00:03:37.109> so<00:03:38.109> leave<00:03:38.500> from<00:03:38.709> here<00:03:39.069> even<00:03:40.109> in<00:03:41.109> your

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:41.260 
sense so leave from here even in your

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.259 
sense so leave from here even in your
world<00:03:41.440> left<00:03:42.130> the<00:03:42.430> second<00:03:42.730> circle<00:03:43.000> right<00:03:43.090> click

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
world left the second circle right click

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:48.409 
world left the second circle right click
on<00:03:43.419> them<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.769> then<00:03:44.769> you're<00:03:44.919> in<00:03:44.980> your<00:03:45.099> crosses

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:53.580 

so<00:03:49.419> from<00:03:49.599> the<00:03:49.720> beginning<00:03:50.280> Ford's<00:03:51.280> weave<00:03:52.590> into

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
so from the beginning Ford's weave into

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:58.710 
so from the beginning Ford's weave into
the<00:03:53.709> 4x4<00:03:55.169> into<00:03:56.169> turning<00:03:56.620> in<00:03:56.709> the<00:03:56.799> weeds<00:03:57.720> open

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
the 4x4 into turning in the weeds open

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.390 
the 4x4 into turning in the weeds open
to<00:03:58.930> a<00:03:58.959> world<00:03:59.260> or<00:03:59.500> to<00:04:00.060> lock<00:04:01.060> has<00:04:01.329> lockouts

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
to a world or to lock has lockouts

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.260 
to a world or to lock has lockouts
crosses

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:09.320 

so<00:04:07.270> we<00:04:07.450> could<00:04:07.600> probably<00:04:07.690> even<00:04:07.930> build<00:04:08.230> on<00:04:08.410> that

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
so we could probably even build on that

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:16.759 
so we could probably even build on that
process<00:04:11.220> probably<00:04:12.220> even<00:04:12.340> go<00:04:12.490> into<00:04:13.800> meltdowns

00:04:16.759 --> 00:04:16.769 
process probably even go into meltdowns

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:19.500 
process probably even go into meltdowns
but<00:04:17.769> not<00:04:17.920> yet<00:04:18.100> I<00:04:18.280> think<00:04:18.340> for<00:04:18.640> now<00:04:18.790> I<00:04:19.120> want<00:04:19.480> to

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:19.510 
but not yet I think for now I want to

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:20.880 
but not yet I think for now I want to

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:20.890 
see how many feel like this video once

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:23.400 
see how many feel like this video once

you videos like this and then if if I

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:25.680 
you videos like this and then if if I
get<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:23.590> round<00:04:23.890> of<00:04:24.340> applause<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.270> yes<00:04:25.480> more
