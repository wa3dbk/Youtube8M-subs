cause Jason Voorhees to spawn and start
killing<00:01:31.079> pedestrians<00:01:31.740> I<00:01:32.090> tried<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.240> and

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
killing pedestrians I tried it and

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:39.069 
killing pedestrians I tried it and
nothing<00:01:33.659> happened<00:01:34.170> but<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.590> pretty<00:01:34.829> cool

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:39.079 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:42.080 

after<00:01:40.079> further<00:01:40.619> investigation<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:41.640> found<00:01:41.850> two

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:42.090 
after further investigation I found two

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.359 
after further investigation I found two
tombstones<00:01:42.659> next<00:01:43.020> to<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> lake<00:01:43.439> they<00:01:44.159> both

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
tombstones next to the lake they both

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.300 
tombstones next to the lake they both
say<00:01:44.729> Tim<00:01:45.119> Watson<00:01:45.600> and<00:01:45.810> soak<00:01:46.350> in<00:01:46.500> some<00:01:46.680> rays

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
say Tim Watson and soak in some rays

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.520 
say Tim Watson and soak in some rays
I<00:01:47.340> find<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.240> bizarre<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.630> one<00:01:48.990> person<00:01:49.439> would

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
I find it bizarre that one person would

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.920 
I find it bizarre that one person would
need<00:01:49.710> two<00:01:49.950> tombstones<00:01:50.729> and<00:01:51.060> why<00:01:51.630> would<00:01:51.810> they

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
need two tombstones and why would they

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.600 
need two tombstones and why would they

want their grave next to a lake like
this<00:01:53.720> especially<00:01:54.720> if<00:01:54.840> it<00:01:54.990> has<00:01:55.110> nuclear<00:01:55.619> waste

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
this especially if it has nuclear waste

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.190 
this especially if it has nuclear waste
in<00:01:56.070> it<00:01:56.189> if<00:01:56.909> I<00:01:57.090> was<00:01:57.270> going<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.450> die<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:57.689> wouldn't

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
in it if I was going to die I wouldn't

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.080 
in it if I was going to die I wouldn't
wanna<00:01:58.380> be<00:01:58.439> buried<00:01:58.710> here<00:01:59.070> I'd<00:01:59.490> might<00:01:59.820> come<00:02:00.000> back

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
wanna be buried here I'd might come back

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.340 
wanna be buried here I'd might come back
as<00:02:00.270> a<00:02:00.360> zombie<00:02:00.390> or<00:02:00.840> something

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:01.350 
as a zombie or something

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:05.149 
as a zombie or something
I<00:02:03.049> began<00:02:04.049> swinging<00:02:04.409> through<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:04.920> to

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
I began swinging through the water to

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.800 
I began swinging through the water to
see<00:02:05.310> if<00:02:05.399> I<00:02:05.460> can<00:02:05.610> find<00:02:05.850> any<00:02:06.000> dead<00:02:06.240> bodies<00:02:06.600> or

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
see if I can find any dead bodies or

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.119 
see if I can find any dead bodies or
something<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:07.500> all<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.619> found<00:02:07.740> was<00:02:08.099> a

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
something but all I found was a

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.219 
something but all I found was a
two-headed<00:02:08.640> fish<00:02:08.849> I'm<00:02:09.119> assuming<00:02:09.899> it<00:02:09.989> has<00:02:10.140> an

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
two-headed fish I'm assuming it has an

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.660 
two-headed fish I'm assuming it has an
extra<00:02:10.500> head<00:02:10.649> because<00:02:10.890> of<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> nuclear<00:02:11.520> waste

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
extra head because of the nuclear waste

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.820 
extra head because of the nuclear waste
you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.540> also<00:02:12.690> find<00:02:13.050> two-headed<00:02:13.500> fish

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
you can also find two-headed fish

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.080 
you can also find two-headed fish
the<00:02:13.920> nuclear<00:02:14.310> island<00:02:16.460> overall<00:02:17.460> this<00:02:17.640> lake<00:02:17.880> is

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
the nuclear island overall this lake is

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.050 
the nuclear island overall this lake is
just<00:02:18.270> super<00:02:18.960> weird<00:02:19.340> well<00:02:20.340> guys<00:02:20.550> I<00:02:20.850> couldn't

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:21.060
