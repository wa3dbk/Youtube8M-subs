 I'm in the bug survey role games 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.150

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.560

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.570
 disgusted I forgot but 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 these are details I don't tag 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.619
 the true you are good and today I owe myself 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.140
 to tell you I want to tell you one 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.669
 story that I regret a story 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.700
 sad for me but you don't give a damn 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.469
 less or the other day guys me 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.420
 the headphones are broken and you will say but 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.770
 who cares sorry telecom for a while 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.330
 again and that's how I did it in 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.370
 how much do you have to go to buy a pair 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.950
 new sony headphone headphones 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.600
 very very very very good white wines 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.780
 among other things because claudio is heard 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 really excellent and I was 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 very quiet I was happy he says oh well 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.760
 very well that they bought some 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.640
 headphones that I like 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.410
 they work all right then in the evening 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.480
 I'm going to play cisco work 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.909
 perfectly everything I turn off the PC 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.520
 because it was late and I go to bed 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.530
 in the meantime, however, a mosquito was 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.759
 biting everywhere he practically gave me 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.259
 very annoying 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:15.299
 it was hot and I could n't get it 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.920
 sleep I said but now I turn on the pc 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.149
 I had to look at myself for a moment 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.889
 TV series I was doing 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:23.999
 I'm going to watch some TV series and 

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:25.469
 then I go to bed not doing the pc I put 

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:26.670
 in charge a TV series that I like not 

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:28.100
 deserves the other I recommend the name 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.289
 the middle 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.920
 I put him in charge, I'm going to look at him 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:36.779
 I feel nothing and I think 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.969
 wow there are broken headphones either 

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:40.829
 someday that is mine at least me 

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:42.779
 they kill I say broken headphones already 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.670
 and not even a day has passed because 

00:01:42.779 --> 00:01:47.249
 indeed, four hours had passed 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.990
 so worried in panic I have 

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:52.439
 decided to restart the PC 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.749
 I think but in the meantime we go up to heart 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.330
 this guy I think but it's possible that he is 

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:59.910
 the headphones are broken in less than three hours 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:03.060
 the mind actually seemed to me 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.040
 very very strange because it never happens 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.600
 a stuff like that then reboot 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.580
 little ones like me from maybe it was just 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.200
 a pci error now restarting it 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.750
 everything like before 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:15.090
 all right and I can hear everything 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.910
 how wrong I was not feeling 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:19.350
 absolutely nothing so i started 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.930
 tweaking around a little bit I have 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.850
 searched for tutorials and stuff like ho 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.580
 looked at the audio settings and everything 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:29.340
 what is nothing did not change 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.660
 absolutely nothing then I decide to 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:34.320
 take the headphones try them in 

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 cell phone is mysteriously working 

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:40.590
 so I said to myself, well 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.610
 headphones work I don't hear that 

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:44.400
 from the pc 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:47.550
 what can you please tell me that it is not 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.740
 what I think is instead you guys know me 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:52.500
 just that it will be that is what it is 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.620
 I think the audio card has broken 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.630
 del pci and this is very sad a lot 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.430
 sad because I have to do it now 

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:01.410
 repair I have to take it to assistance 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:02.970
 I have to change the sound card 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.760
 for heaven's sake it costs nothing I believe 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.090
 should be something like 20 euros 25 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.700
 EUR 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.769
 maybe 30 if it really goes wrong I mean 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:13.230
 it's not a crazy expense it's not like one 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:14.550
 video card for example however breaks the 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.470
 fuck and break the fuck because exactly 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:20.280
 I have to bring assistance 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:21.739
 that is, it will put us the technician one day or 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.330
 I don't know two 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:26.880
 so it's probably so now me 

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:28.739
 I'm pre-recorded videos so 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.550
 let you have all the videos for all the 

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.900
 week 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.250
 so at least I won't have any problems too 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.070
 because this week are all 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:37.950
 busy one day I'll tell you why 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.780
 so if the problems many many kids 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:40.800
 problems 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.660
 this is the life we ​​owe ourselves 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.190
 just making a sound card is not 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:47.820
 nothing rich and I repeat it doesn't cost much 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.380
 so why do I get a team that is why 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.239
 you're even trying to ask me 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.950
 tv because there is a team i don't care 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.420
 the team happens to me easy boy 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:56.970
 this is not our Chinese team 

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:58.350
 main problem brock problem 

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:59.280
 main that you have to die because me 

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.320
 you look like a clever guy 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.540
 and to me james non natural formations 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:07.390
 absolutely like them then now 12 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.819
 hello hi does not deserve a pro training 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:11.409
 anyway I said it's not really a 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.030
 the problem is the levels 

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:14.620
 cost more than anything else of the breakup of 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:17.109
 balls I have to wait for I have to 

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:18.850
 change it because everything was fine and da 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.949
 one moment at a time taken and broke 

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.600
 because indeed it is broken alone it is not 

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.180
 that I can have it for I may have broken it 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:27.639
 judo inside as you do is inside the pci e 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.680
 you can't break the sound card not 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:31.720
 it works fortunately that the microphone 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.669
 the more he bought besides being great 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.680
 microphone also a mini card plug 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:38.710
 audio inside or if me 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.810
 I connect the headphones to this little jack 

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:42.039
 that is in the microphone I can hear 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.960
 all there is only one child 

00:04:42.039 --> 00:04:46.030
 problem that I also feel my return 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:47.830
 of voice and it can give me a little 

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.720
 however bother me over time surely 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.910
 I will also get used to it because I know of many 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.229
 speaker and many voice actors that yes 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.970
 they must hear their own voice 

00:04:53.229 --> 00:04:56.740
 mandatory otherwise not 

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:59.530
 they manage to speak facts in practice 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.240
 when I went to the radio between 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.039
 quotation marks interviewing a guy from 

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.840
 radio he told me to the point that if 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.729
 he didn't hear his own voice he didn't know 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:10.419
 what he was saying and how he was talking 

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:12.729
 so I will definitely not get used to it 

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:14.949
 very big problem I hope I can 

00:05:12.729 --> 00:05:17.680
 solve this stuff in a couple of 

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:20.020
 days anyway I will let you know not 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.610
 as soon as the lav rho settled veloster of 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.930
 let people know with a video that it's all a 

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:24.820
 hello place hello 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.580
 for now anyway I'll hang out in this 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:29.470
 so i hope you don't have to bring the 

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.080
 small assistance for type 2 or 3 days 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.900
 with the continuations with the hero a team team 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.039
 in the blitzes it is silver kraft for the wind 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.510
 they joined us to the arcane burrows after 

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:42.099
 because silva and kraft will make TV 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:44.139
 with me then we go to kill 

00:05:42.099 --> 00:05:44.440
 english team those we are among 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:48.159
 their 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.080
 who takes me a girl of services 

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:52.780
 because it didn't seem very very flash 

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:54.520
 with 103 boys obviously boys 

00:05:52.780 --> 00:05:57.910
 However 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:59.740
 bonomi were in a team is a fact 

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.319
 that obviously the boys are better 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.509
 there are exceptions for charity though neither 

00:06:02.319 --> 00:06:05.879
 in minecraft in his boys games 

00:06:04.509 --> 00:06:09.370
 at most times 

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:11.379
 however we see how he gets along 

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:12.460
 let's be careful now maybe mixture of 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:14.379
 ugly I have to take everything back 

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:16.900
 this he said or maybe to a boy 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:18.699
 we do not really know everything 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.310
 some say because she was a nice liz 

00:06:18.699 --> 00:06:23.310
