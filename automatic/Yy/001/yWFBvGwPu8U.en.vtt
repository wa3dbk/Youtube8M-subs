you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.479> easily<00:01:48.750> see<00:01:49.020> the<00:01:49.200> difference<00:01:49.649> this

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
you can easily see the difference this

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.800 
you can easily see the difference this
obviously<00:01:50.220> is<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> bad<00:01:50.850> oil<00:01:51.090> and<00:01:51.450> this<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.780> a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
obviously is a bad oil and this is a

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.990 
obviously is a bad oil and this is a
good<00:01:51.990> oil<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.470> will<00:01:52.619> go<00:01:52.829> into<00:01:53.009> your<00:01:53.220> car<00:01:53.490> when

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the oil change is completed but with the

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.639 
the oil change is completed but with the
nitrogen<00:01:56.729> in<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.210> tires<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:58.200> can't<00:01:58.469> really

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
nitrogen in the tires you can't really

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:00.800 
nitrogen in the tires you can't really
see<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.490> can't<00:01:59.729> smell<00:02:00.030> it<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.390> you<00:02:00.570> can't
