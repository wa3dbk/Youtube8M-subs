Ginger's<00:00:00.659> I<00:00:00.810> changed<00:00:01.680> life<00:00:01.920> change<00:00:02.700> the<00:00:02.970> clap

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:21.320 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:27.160 

the<00:00:21.890> immutable<00:00:22.400> I<00:00:25.450> as<00:00:26.450> far<00:00:26.720> as<00:00:26.840> the<00:00:26.960> eye<00:00:26.990> is

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:27.170 
the immutable I as far as the eye is

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:30.640 
the immutable I as far as the eye is
concerned<00:00:27.920> the<00:00:28.160> ego<00:00:28.490> its<00:00:29.060> permanent<00:00:29.540> and<00:00:30.500> it

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:30.650 
concerned the ego its permanent and it

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:32.140 
concerned the ego its permanent and it
doesn't<00:00:30.890> like<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:31.130> idea<00:00:31.189> of<00:00:31.430> changing<00:00:31.880> or

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:32.150 
doesn't like the idea of changing or

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.119 
doesn't like the idea of changing or
giving<00:00:32.480> up<00:00:32.629> or<00:00:32.840> becoming<00:00:33.170> something<00:00:33.680> or

00:00:34.119 --> 00:00:34.129 
giving up or becoming something or

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:37.200 
giving up or becoming something or
someone<00:00:34.550> else<00:00:34.730> doesn't<00:00:35.450> like<00:00:35.600> growing

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:37.210 
someone else doesn't like growing

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.090 
someone else doesn't like growing
because<00:00:37.629> then<00:00:37.780> it<00:00:37.899> disappears<00:00:38.410> it<00:00:38.680> changes

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:39.100 
because then it disappears it changes

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.040 
because then it disappears it changes
and<00:00:39.280> then<00:00:39.399> it<00:00:40.090> feels<00:00:40.210> threatened

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:42.050 
and then it feels threatened

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.520 
and then it feels threatened
so<00:00:42.680> when<00:00:42.829> the<00:00:42.950> eye<00:00:43.719> creates<00:00:44.719> a<00:00:44.809> goal<00:00:45.050> the<00:00:45.500> eye

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:45.530 
so when the eye creates a goal the eye

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.549 
so when the eye creates a goal the eye
sees<00:00:46.040> itself<00:00:46.910> at<00:00:47.329> the<00:00:47.600> finish<00:00:47.930> line<00:00:47.960> it

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:48.559 
sees itself at the finish line it

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:50.619 
sees itself at the finish line it
doesn't<00:00:48.710> see<00:00:49.010> a<00:00:49.040> transformed<00:00:49.969> person<00:00:50.540> who

00:00:50.619 --> 00:00:50.629 
doesn't see a transformed person who

00:00:50.629 --> 00:00:53.170 
doesn't see a transformed person who
doesn't<00:00:50.930> see<00:00:51.079> an<00:00:51.199> evolved<00:00:51.710> person<00:00:52.250> it<00:00:52.850> doesn't

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:53.180 
doesn't see an evolved person it doesn't

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.389 
doesn't see an evolved person it doesn't
see<00:00:53.300> a<00:00:53.329> person<00:00:53.600> that's<00:00:53.899> grown<00:00:54.199> it<00:00:54.470> sees<00:00:54.710> the<00:00:55.220> me

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:55.399 
see a person that's grown it sees the me

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:57.100 
see a person that's grown it sees the me
right<00:00:55.970> now<00:00:56.180> the<00:00:56.510> one<00:00:56.629> that's<00:00:56.780> having<00:00:56.960> the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:57.110 
right now the one that's having the

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.290 
right now the one that's having the
fantasy<00:00:57.620> sees<00:00:58.220> that<00:00:58.400> person<00:00:58.879> at<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.089> finish

00:00:59.290 --> 00:00:59.300 
fantasy sees that person at the finish

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.240 
fantasy sees that person at the finish
line

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:01.250 
line

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.940 
line
and<00:01:01.370> this<00:01:01.790> is<00:01:01.970> I<00:01:02.240> believe<00:01:03.080> the<00:01:03.650> biggest

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:03.950 
and this is I believe the biggest

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.310 
and this is I believe the biggest
problem<00:01:04.309> with<00:01:04.460> goal<00:01:04.670> setting<00:01:04.840> then<00:01:05.840> it's<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
problem with goal setting then it's the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.980 
problem with goal setting then it's the
ego<00:01:06.740> has<00:01:07.370> transplanted<00:01:08.330> itself<00:01:08.630> into<00:01:08.900> your

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
ego has transplanted itself into your

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.820 
ego has transplanted itself into your
future<00:01:09.200> it<00:01:10.160> doesn't<00:01:10.460> belong<00:01:10.640> there

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:11.830 
future it doesn't belong there

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:13.800 
future it doesn't belong there
because<00:01:12.490> if<00:01:12.610> you're<00:01:12.730> focused<00:01:13.090> on<00:01:13.180> the<00:01:13.300> process

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
because if you're focused on the process

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.210 
because if you're focused on the process
and<00:01:14.020> if<00:01:14.110> you're<00:01:14.230> taking<00:01:14.410> the<00:01:14.680> little<00:01:14.860> steps

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
and if you're taking the little steps

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:16.560 
and if you're taking the little steps
there's<00:01:15.460> going<00:01:15.580> to<00:01:15.640> be<00:01:15.670> growth<00:01:15.970> along<00:01:16.240> the<00:01:16.480> way

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
there's going to be growth along the way

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.930 
there's going to be growth along the way
and<00:01:16.870> you<00:01:17.470> won't<00:01:17.650> be<00:01:17.740> the<00:01:17.890> same<00:01:18.070> person<00:01:18.460> when

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:18.940 
and you won't be the same person when

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.280 
and you won't be the same person when
you<00:01:18.970> get<00:01:19.150> to<00:01:19.240> that<00:01:19.360> finish<00:01:19.510> line<00:01:19.810> if<00:01:20.020> you<00:01:20.170> do

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
you get to that finish line if you do

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.470 
you get to that finish line if you do
indeed<00:01:20.470> make<00:01:20.830> the<00:01:21.010> finish<00:01:21.250> line<00:01:21.430> you<00:01:22.210> will<00:01:22.360> be

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:22.480 
indeed make the finish line you will be

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.770 
indeed make the finish line you will be
the<00:01:22.630> same<00:01:22.780> person<00:01:23.020> and<00:01:23.800> if<00:01:24.130> you<00:01:24.250> are<00:01:24.630> then<00:01:25.630> you

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:25.780 
the same person and if you are then you

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.450 
the same person and if you are then you
didn't<00:01:25.990> grow<00:01:26.170> along<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.590> way<00:01:26.710> and<00:01:26.980> what's<00:01:27.280> the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
didn't grow along the way and what's the

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:28.980 
didn't grow along the way and what's the
point<00:01:27.700> of<00:01:27.760> accomplishing<00:01:28.180> goal<00:01:28.540> what<00:01:28.870> did<00:01:28.960> you

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:28.990 
point of accomplishing goal what did you

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:32.130 
point of accomplishing goal what did you
really<00:01:29.200> get<00:01:29.460> you<00:01:30.460> got<00:01:30.610> the<00:01:30.760> goal<00:01:30.940> your<00:01:31.900> egos
