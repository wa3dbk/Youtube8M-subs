00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
serrated thing and as you can see as I

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.969 
serrated thing and as you can see as I
move<00:01:15.030> my<00:01:15.060> finger<00:01:15.450> over<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.900> across<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.860> back

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
move my finger over it across the back

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.609 
move my finger over it across the back
of<00:01:17.130> thing<00:01:17.280> without<00:01:17.670> even<00:01:17.820> trying<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.630> can<00:01:19.439> see

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
of thing without even trying you can see

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.600 
of thing without even trying you can see
I<00:01:20.180> move<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.360> catch<00:01:22.070> that<00:01:23.070> is<00:01:23.310> all<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
I move the catch that is all the

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.070 
I move the catch that is all the
movement<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.270> needed<00:01:24.659> to<00:01:24.810> make<00:01:24.930> the

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
movement that is needed to make the

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.380 
movement that is needed to make the
battery<00:01:25.409> fall<00:01:25.619> off<00:01:25.860> I'll<00:01:26.610> demonstrate<00:01:26.909> this

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
battery fall off I'll demonstrate this

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.260 
battery fall off I'll demonstrate this
now<00:01:27.659> I'm<00:01:28.020> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.229> put<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.439> battery<00:01:28.590> on

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:29.270 
now I'm going to put the battery on

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:32.870 
now I'm going to put the battery on
hopefully<00:01:30.270> properly<00:01:31.460> click<00:01:32.460> it<00:01:32.640> into<00:01:32.759> place

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
hopefully properly click it into place

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.789 
hopefully properly click it into place
you<00:01:33.360> saw<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.600> catch<00:01:33.869> me<00:01:34.079> was<00:01:34.259> it<00:01:34.380> clicks<00:01:34.619> into

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
you saw the catch me was it clicks into

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.440 
you saw the catch me was it clicks into
place<00:01:34.920> I<00:01:37.340> don't<00:01:38.340> believe<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.299> will

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
place I don't believe that that will

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
place I don't believe that that will
come<00:01:39.630> out<00:01:39.780> now<00:01:40.079> so<00:01:40.500> yeah<00:01:40.619> the<00:01:40.770> batteries<00:01:41.070> in

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
come out now so yeah the batteries in

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.289 
come out now so yeah the batteries in
place<00:01:41.460> it's<00:01:42.450> secure

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:44.299 
place it's secure

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:47.270 
place it's secure
however<00:01:45.299> if<00:01:45.630> I<00:01:45.810> were<00:01:45.990> to<00:01:46.200> just<00:01:46.590> move<00:01:47.100> the

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
however if I were to just move the

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.039 
however if I were to just move the
finger<00:01:47.610> across<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> back<00:01:48.149> of<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.360> laptop<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
finger across the back of the laptop a

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.950 
finger across the back of the laptop a
couple<00:01:49.590> of<00:01:49.680> times<00:01:49.950> I<00:01:50.280> know<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.509> battery<00:01:51.810> will

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
couple of times I know the battery will

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.789 
couple of times I know the battery will
just<00:01:52.170> fall<00:01:52.350> out<00:01:52.579> at<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.850> stage<00:01:54.090> in<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.390> next

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:54.799 
just fall out at some stage in the next

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:57.679 
just fall out at some stage in the next
few<00:01:55.799> hours<00:01:55.829> but<00:01:56.700> I'll<00:01:56.820> demonstrate<00:01:57.030> it<00:01:57.509> just

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:57.689 
few hours but I'll demonstrate it just

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
few hours but I'll demonstrate it just
by<00:01:57.810> pulling<00:01:59.899> this<00:02:00.899> has<00:02:01.110> been<00:02:01.619> occurring<00:02:01.890> since

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
by pulling this has been occurring since

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.730 
by pulling this has been occurring since
I<00:02:02.430> purchased<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:03.240> thing<00:02:03.450> no<00:02:03.930> matter<00:02:04.110> how<00:02:04.229> well

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
I purchased the thing no matter how well

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.010 
I purchased the thing no matter how well
I<00:02:05.299> put<00:02:06.299> the<00:02:06.450> battery<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.049> eventually<00:02:08.810> it<00:02:09.810> will

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
I put the battery in eventually it will

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.390 
I put the battery in eventually it will
