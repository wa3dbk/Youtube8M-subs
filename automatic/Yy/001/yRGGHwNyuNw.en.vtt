million times and I came up with a theme
which<00:00:20.039> I<00:00:20.220> thought<00:00:20.490> would<00:00:20.820> which<00:00:21.240> was<00:00:21.420> sharing

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840

which I thought would which was sharing
which<00:00:22.050> I<00:00:22.199> thought<00:00:22.380> would<00:00:22.560> really<00:00:22.920> lend<00:00:23.039> itself

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
which I thought would really lend itself

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.099 
which I thought would really lend itself
to<00:00:23.430> a<00:00:23.580> lot<00:00:23.789> of<00:00:23.939> comedic<00:00:24.390> moments<00:00:24.600> for<00:00:24.990> all

thought it was really cool because

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.679 
thought it was really cool because
script<00:01:53.430> was<00:01:53.759> actually<00:01:54.119> turned<00:01:54.360> out<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.570> be
