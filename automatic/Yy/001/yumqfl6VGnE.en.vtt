00:00:16.259 --> 00:00:19.259
 v 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:31.849
 we this UNH 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:38.220
 to have 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.720
 Jokingly 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:46.050

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.010
 till 9 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 you do not know how things are going on here 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.329
 as long as you resemble the city you are safe but out there Impact Land 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.980
 a lot different 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.980

 For years we ran away 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.140
 hiding at that time 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.060
 looking for the key 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:01.060
 we knew that we were ours 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.290

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:28.629
 and conveniently by e-mail 

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:31.249
