00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.009
 Luis Leon 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:08.410
 the study is the first 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:11.989
 the Argentine group 

00:00:11.989 --> 00:00:14.129
 brown brenes 

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.689
 and if I could get to that island 

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:19.640
 it says they burned their portals 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:22.640
 through which you could push back in time 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.289
 go back in time 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.289
 gabon that was believed 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.039
 something terrible happened when our old army to the palace of the sea 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.050
 the islands 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.880
 it's more time 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.570
 even worse 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:44.570
 the surprises 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 the one that will open the originals must die 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.740
 I was forced to kill those who fought by my side 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.740
 with my loved ones but the construction of a pool 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.180
 ricky simms 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:05.520
 in a beginning 

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:08.230
 and about my loves 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.220
 use the clubs themselves to push back the time as if nothing 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.050
 I had passed 

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.630
 different vision 

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.630
 the meadow is now the guardian of the timeline 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.470
 you laugh you die 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.040
 that's why he prepares himself and will make sure that you face your destiny 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.730
 but I want to try and wait for death 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:38.219
 although places will reach the island you would have to face the 

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:41.390
 Empress of Time 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.180
 go back in time and prevent them from creating the sands 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.310
 if they do not exist, they are taking out they will have nothing against me 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:54.080
 And you are my prince 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:55.840
 but his attitude of harassment 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:59.040
 your virgin will not end well 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.150
 you can not change 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.100
 fair destiny
