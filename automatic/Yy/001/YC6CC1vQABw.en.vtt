00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.800
 saying this is what i was doing playing playfully 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.470
 once played this great video game 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.200

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.409

 In general, just cool this is all very me 

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:45.210
 I liked it and at the end I'm the same 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.240
 credits that I didn't see there in this 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:51.000
 the game well, it's a little such icon but 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.730
 I liked it that it kisses 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.620
 the story that's gone and everything and at the end 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.170
 titer we can naturally play further 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.480
 just did not succumb to fifteen years in this 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.550
 companies to win this title 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.830
 quite a few interesting events were 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:09.470
 connected there you can download yourself skills 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:12.610
 change game nick change 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.060
 no skills let's say on pile ability 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:18.470

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:21.320
 sharate film signature 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:24.920

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:31.390
 showcase mode is also not changed 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:33.770
 on the steppe of working graphics faces all-all 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.320
 awesome you can see it on 

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:38.570
 screen dear friends I myself of course 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.090
 missed you but I had a very 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:45.350
 important things and a lot of time so 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:48.709
 I myself actually, and not particularly 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:53.300
 played after the purchase well, that's the widow and 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:56.180
 I also wanted to mention the regime 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:59.660
 fatigue is a superskaya just a figure on 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:03.140
 I don't know how else you can write 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:06.170
 fighting you beat him his stamina falls 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.810
 your opponent he is lying fig knows 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:09.970
 how many spruce gets up 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.370
 can finish do not forget that you have it 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:15.280
 it will all fall very realistic 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:18.160
 opened and also the weight of rolster view 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.060
 changing everything open and what I noticed 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:22.660
 such and such 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:25.450
 ray was abel regle as far as he is with 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.310
 the previous version of it was not there I 

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:30.730
 Of course , I still got the truth 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:33.040
 all the same license how does it all 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:36.970
 very cool growth, in principle, not really 

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:40.690
 rich but sarna is an interesting blessing 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:44.380
 the fireplace is the warmest and you can download them 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:47.010
 characters and they also play it not 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:50.970
 may not please 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:55.629
 Well, of course there are some modes 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.690
 bed or is it a single mode both are 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:01.629
 now I donâ€™t actively 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:03.819
 elimination but only three by three 

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:08.340
 as far as i remember some mode there 

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:08.340
 shortened I already forgot they simply do not have 

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.550
 Well, the battles themselves will naturally be 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:18.340
 very spectacular you look even like 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:21.640

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:36.509

 can develop gradually and 

00:04:53.599 --> 00:04:59.559
 intriguing, and even the well 

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.270

00:04:59.559 --> 00:05:03.159
