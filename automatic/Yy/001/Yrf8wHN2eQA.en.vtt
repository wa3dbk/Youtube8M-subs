00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.819 

Baroque<00:00:00.390> composers<00:00:00.420> were<00:00:01.140> always<00:00:01.350> working

00:00:01.819 --> 00:00:01.829 
Baroque composers were always working

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:04.010 
Baroque composers were always working
with<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.070> idea<00:00:02.220> of<00:00:02.550> strong<00:00:03.210> and<00:00:03.480> weak<00:00:03.510> they

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:04.020 
with the idea of strong and weak they

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.900 
with the idea of strong and weak they
would<00:00:04.200> even<00:00:04.290> go<00:00:04.529> so<00:00:04.740> far<00:00:04.770> sometimes<00:00:05.339> to<00:00:05.730> say

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:05.910 
would even go so far sometimes to say

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.970 
would even go so far sometimes to say
good<00:00:06.270> and<00:00:06.540> bad<00:00:06.750> the<00:00:07.140> idea<00:00:07.440> of<00:00:07.500> strong<00:00:07.770> and<00:00:07.950> weak

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
good and bad the idea of strong and weak

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:10.009 
good and bad the idea of strong and weak
can<00:00:08.250> apply<00:00:08.490> to<00:00:08.550> a<00:00:08.639> number<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.150> things<00:00:09.360> it<00:00:09.809> can

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
can apply to a number of things it can

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.740 
can apply to a number of things it can
be<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.679> beats<00:00:10.889> within<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.340> measure<00:00:11.550> it<00:00:12.269> can<00:00:12.570> be

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:12.750 
be the beats within a measure it can be

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:15.860 
be the beats within a measure it can be
the<00:00:12.990> beats<00:00:13.230> within<00:00:13.650> one<00:00:14.219> beat<00:00:14.460> and<00:00:14.790> it<00:00:15.780> can

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the beats within one beat and it can

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.560 
the beats within one beat and it can
also<00:00:16.020> be<00:00:16.139> harmonic<00:00:16.800> choices<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:18.090> weight<00:00:18.330> of

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
also be harmonic choices the weight of

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.480 
also be harmonic choices the weight of
measures<00:00:18.960> throughout<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.410> phrase<00:00:19.770> we<00:00:20.340> can

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
measures throughout a phrase we can

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.070 
measures throughout a phrase we can
really<00:00:20.640> use<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> idea<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.510> strong<00:00:21.750> and<00:00:21.930> weak

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
really use the idea of strong and weak

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.620 
really use the idea of strong and weak
than<00:00:22.680> many<00:00:22.920> musical<00:00:23.369> applications<00:00:24.000> most

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
than many musical applications most

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.630 
than many musical applications most
broke<00:00:24.960> instruments<00:00:25.680> naturally<00:00:26.189> have<00:00:26.310> strong

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
broke instruments naturally have strong

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.550 
broke instruments naturally have strong
and<00:00:26.789> weak<00:00:26.970> built<00:00:27.240> into<00:00:27.539> them<00:00:27.689> the<00:00:28.050> Baroque<00:00:28.320> bow

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
and weak built into them the Baroque bow

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.410 
and weak built into them the Baroque bow
for<00:00:28.859> example<00:00:29.400> will<00:00:29.760> naturally<00:00:29.970> get<00:00:30.359> a

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
for example will naturally get a

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.990 
for example will naturally get a
stronger<00:00:30.869> down<00:00:31.289> bow<00:00:31.529> and<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.859> weaker<00:00:32.219> up<00:00:32.399> bow<00:00:32.640> so

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
stronger down bow and a weaker up bow so

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.490 
stronger down bow and a weaker up bow so
we<00:00:33.120> already<00:00:33.300> have<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.870> built<00:00:34.110> into<00:00:34.469> our

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
we already have that built into our

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.740 
we already have that built into our
arsenal<00:00:35.070> this<00:00:35.550> means<00:00:35.820> naturally<00:00:36.420> we're<00:00:36.660> gonna

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
arsenal this means naturally we're gonna

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.690 
arsenal this means naturally we're gonna
put<00:00:37.050> more<00:00:37.079> weight<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.070> sound<00:00:38.399> on<00:00:38.610> the

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
put more weight and more sound on the

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.790 
put more weight and more sound on the
down<00:00:38.879> bow<00:00:39.120> and<00:00:39.390> less<00:00:39.780> weight<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.469> weaker

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
down bow and less weight on the weaker

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.190 
down bow and less weight on the weaker
fo<00:00:41.160> within<00:00:41.730> one<00:00:41.969> measure<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.510> have<00:00:42.540> stronger

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
fo within one measure we have stronger

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:44.840 
fo within one measure we have stronger
beats<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.590> weaker<00:00:43.860> beats<00:00:44.070> if<00:00:44.460> we<00:00:44.670> have<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
beats and weaker beats if we have a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.940 
beats and weaker beats if we have a
measure<00:00:45.090> of<00:00:45.210> four<00:00:45.629> for<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.379> first<00:00:46.649> and<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
measure of four for the first and the

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
measure of four for the first and the
third<00:00:46.980> beats<00:00:47.399> will<00:00:47.550> be<00:00:47.670> strong<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.300> the

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
third beats will be strong and the

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.910 
third beats will be strong and the
second<00:00:48.750> and<00:00:48.840> the<00:00:48.899> fourth<00:00:49.140> beats<00:00:49.440> will<00:00:49.620> be<00:00:49.739> weak

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
second and the fourth beats will be weak

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.799 
second and the fourth beats will be weak
for<00:00:50.219> bowing<00:00:50.879> patterns<00:00:51.239> this<00:00:51.420> works<00:00:51.629> out

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
for bowing patterns this works out

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:53.479 
for bowing patterns this works out
nicely<00:00:52.020> because<00:00:52.440> we'll<00:00:52.710> be<00:00:52.739> down<00:00:53.070> low<00:00:53.309> in<00:00:53.460> the

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
nicely because we'll be down low in the

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.400 
nicely because we'll be down low in the
first<00:00:53.760> and<00:00:54.000> third<00:00:54.030> beats<00:00:54.480> and<00:00:54.750> up<00:00:54.899> bow<00:00:55.110> on<00:00:55.289> the

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:55.410 
first and third beats and up bow on the

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:57.200 
first and third beats and up bow on the
second<00:00:55.739> and<00:00:55.829> fourth<00:00:56.039> if<00:00:56.309> we<00:00:56.520> take<00:00:56.699> a<00:00:56.730> musical

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
second and fourth if we take a musical

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.959 
second and fourth if we take a musical
example<00:00:57.719> of<00:00:57.960> something<00:00:58.199> written<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.710> 4/4<00:00:59.370> we

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
example of something written in 4/4 we

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
example of something written in 4/4 we
can<00:01:00.149> hear<00:01:00.390> exactly<00:01:00.539> how<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.050> strong<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.530> weak

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
can hear exactly how the strong and weak

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.920 
can hear exactly how the strong and weak
comes<00:01:02.039> into<00:01:02.280> play<00:01:02.489> if<00:01:03.149> we<00:01:03.329> start<00:01:03.570> by<00:01:03.719> just

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
comes into play if we start by just

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.570 
comes into play if we start by just
taking<00:01:04.049> four<00:01:04.439> quarter<00:01:04.799> notes<00:01:04.830> so<00:01:05.159> we<00:01:05.250> can<00:01:05.369> look

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
taking four quarter notes so we can look

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:15.000 
taking four quarter notes so we can look
at<00:01:05.670> how<00:01:05.820> it<00:01:05.970> lays<00:01:06.119> naturally<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:06.960> bow

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:15.010 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.680 

now<00:01:16.010> we'll<00:01:16.159> take<00:01:16.310> an<00:01:16.430> actual<00:01:16.729> baseline<00:01:17.330> using

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:17.690 
now we'll take an actual baseline using

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:19.120 
now we'll take an actual baseline using
quarter<00:01:17.960> notes<00:01:17.990> and<00:01:18.290> hear<00:01:18.590> how<00:01:18.740> the<00:01:18.800> strong

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
quarter notes and hear how the strong

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:28.870 
quarter notes and hear how the strong
and<00:01:19.280> weak<00:01:19.340> divides<00:01:19.790> up<00:01:19.970> this<00:01:20.120> way<00:01:27.460> if<00:01:28.460> we<00:01:28.759> were

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:28.880 
and weak divides up this way if we were

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.430 
and weak divides up this way if we were
to<00:01:29.030> take<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:29.390> same<00:01:29.570> idea<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.140> measure<00:01:30.350> of

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:30.440 
to take the same idea in a measure of

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.260 
to take the same idea in a measure of
3/4<00:01:31.190> we're<00:01:31.610> gonna<00:01:31.729> have<00:01:31.940> a<00:01:31.970> slightly

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:32.270 
3/4 we're gonna have a slightly

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.090 
3/4 we're gonna have a slightly
different<00:01:32.420> division<00:01:33.259> of<00:01:33.440> strong<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:33.950> weak

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:34.100 
different division of strong and weak

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.790 
different division of strong and weak
will<00:01:34.460> be<00:01:34.580> strongest<00:01:35.060> on<00:01:35.240> the<00:01:35.300> first<00:01:35.540> beat

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
will be strongest on the first beat

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.499 
will be strongest on the first beat
weaker<00:01:36.800> on<00:01:36.920> the<00:01:37.070> second<00:01:37.490> and<00:01:37.640> weakest

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
weaker on the second and weakest

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.450 
weaker on the second and weakest
on<00:01:38.630> the<00:01:38.780> third<00:01:38.990> beat<00:01:39.259> this<00:01:39.770> generally<00:01:40.250> means

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
on the third beat this generally means

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.670 
on the third beat this generally means
we<00:01:40.610> want<00:01:40.790> to<00:01:40.850> use<00:01:40.940> a<00:01:40.970> down<00:01:41.330> up-up<00:01:41.690> bow<00:01:42.290> stroke

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:42.680 
we want to use a down up-up bow stroke

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.710 
we want to use a down up-up bow stroke
so<00:01:43.070> that<00:01:43.220> we're<00:01:43.340> keeping<00:01:43.850> our<00:01:43.970> first<00:01:44.270> beat<00:01:44.570> the

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
so that we're keeping our first beat the

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:56.350 
so that we're keeping our first beat the
strongest<00:01:53.860> the<00:01:54.860> tendency<00:01:55.399> is<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.910> want<00:01:55.940> to

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
strongest the tendency is to want to

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.230 
strongest the tendency is to want to
give<00:01:56.570> an<00:01:56.690> accent<00:01:57.259> on<00:01:57.590> the<00:01:58.250> third<00:01:58.490> beat<00:01:58.759> to<00:01:59.000> lead

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
give an accent on the third beat to lead

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.600 
give an accent on the third beat to lead
into<00:01:59.600> the<00:02:00.110> first<00:02:00.350> beat<00:02:00.679> despite<00:02:01.130> the<00:02:01.280> desire

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610 
into the first beat despite the desire

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.669 
into the first beat despite the desire
to<00:02:01.640> want<00:02:02.000> to<00:02:02.090> accent<00:02:02.570> the<00:02:02.750> third<00:02:02.990> beat<00:02:03.289> we<00:02:03.500> want

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
to want to accent the third beat we want

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:04.960 
to want to accent the third beat we want
to<00:02:03.740> make<00:02:03.920> sure<00:02:04.130> that<00:02:04.340> the<00:02:04.429> first<00:02:04.700> beat<00:02:04.940> is

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:04.970 
to make sure that the first beat is

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.850 
to make sure that the first beat is
still<00:02:05.270> always<00:02:05.509> the<00:02:05.750> strongest<00:02:06.229> now<00:02:06.679> let's

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:06.860 
still always the strongest now let's

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:20.770 
still always the strongest now let's
hear<00:02:07.009> 3/4<00:02:07.610> measure<00:02:07.880> in<00:02:08.209> context<00:02:19.450> we<00:02:20.450> can<00:02:20.630> go

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:20.780 
hear 3/4 measure in context we can go

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.080 
hear 3/4 measure in context we can go
even<00:02:20.930> further<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.769> subdivide<00:02:22.489> beats<00:02:22.760> into

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
even further and subdivide beats into

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.819 
even further and subdivide beats into
stronger<00:02:23.690> parts<00:02:23.989> of<00:02:24.079> the<00:02:24.200> beef<00:02:24.350> and<00:02:24.560> weaker

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:24.829 
stronger parts of the beef and weaker

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.500 
stronger parts of the beef and weaker
parts<00:02:25.100> of<00:02:25.250> the<00:02:25.340> beat<00:02:25.519> this<00:02:25.820> is<00:02:25.970> easy<00:02:26.180> to<00:02:26.390> see

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:26.510 
parts of the beat this is easy to see

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:28.150 
parts of the beat this is easy to see
when<00:02:26.630> we<00:02:26.660> look<00:02:26.780> at<00:02:26.989> eighth<00:02:27.170> notes<00:02:27.530> if<00:02:27.769> we're

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:34.880 
up bows are going to be weak and the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.610 
up bows are going to be weak and the

your repertoire with these rules in mind
first<00:02:55.960> and<00:02:56.230> then<00:02:56.530> decide<00:02:56.860> if<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.160> want<00:02:57.340> to

first and then decide if you want to

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.400 
first and then decide if you want to
make<00:02:57.550> an<00:02:57.670> educated<00:02:58.120> exception<00:02:58.750> there's<00:02:59.260> so

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
make an educated exception there's so

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.020 
make an educated exception there's so
much<00:02:59.530> more<00:02:59.770> to<00:02:59.920> talk<00:03:00.100> about<00:03:00.160> with<00:03:00.550> strong<00:03:00.880> and
