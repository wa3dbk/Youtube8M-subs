smeeling<00:00:46.710> I'm<00:00:47.100> just<00:00:47.430> guessing<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.850> it's

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
smeeling I'm just guessing that it's

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:51.319 
smeeling I'm just guessing that it's
because<00:00:48.480> there<00:00:49.320> are<00:00:49.680> releasing<00:00:50.399> all<00:00:50.969> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
because there are releasing all the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.450 
because there are releasing all the
original<00:00:51.660> figures<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.230> it's<00:00:52.590> just<00:00:52.739> gonna<00:00:52.949> say

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
original figures so it's just gonna say

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:00.310 
original figures so it's just gonna say
Ben<00:00:53.699> 10<00:00:54.469> okay<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.039> on<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.699> back<00:00:56.910> it<00:00:57.420> shows<00:00:57.480> at

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:40.010 
to do the comparison this one was

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.310 
to do the comparison this one was
actually<00:02:40.160> a<00:02:40.370> bit<00:02:40.640> bulkier<00:02:41.180> meaning<00:02:42.140> it's

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
actually a bit bulkier meaning it's

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.949 
actually a bit bulkier meaning it's
thicker<00:02:42.740> all<00:02:43.070> around<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.670> has<00:02:44.270> bigger<00:02:44.660> feet

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
well this is um kind of interesting

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:25.420 
well this is um kind of interesting
because<00:03:23.630> no<00:03:24.019> Ben<00:03:24.230> Tennyson<00:03:24.709> figure<00:03:25.010> like<00:03:25.250> this

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
because no Ben Tennyson figure like this

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.250 
because no Ben Tennyson figure like this
has<00:03:25.730> ever<00:03:26.660> been<00:03:27.410> in<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.680> suit<00:03:28.640> like<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:29.060> and<00:03:29.750> I

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
has ever been in a suit like this and I

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:31.090 
has ever been in a suit like this and I
think<00:03:30.320> it's<00:03:30.590> actually<00:03:30.739> really<00:03:30.980> interesting

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
think it's actually really interesting

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:33.880 
think it's actually really interesting
ban<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.730> did<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.060> good<00:03:32.209> job<00:03:32.269> with<00:03:32.510> this<00:03:32.900> part<00:03:33.680> of

lose these pieces or ban daddy to
include<00:03:39.380> them<00:03:39.940> that<00:03:40.940> wouldn't<00:03:41.120> be<00:03:41.420> good<00:03:41.450> and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:42.170

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.390 
include them that wouldn't be good and
it<00:03:42.530> would<00:03:42.650> be<00:03:42.799> a<00:03:42.830> bad<00:03:43.070> figure<00:03:43.489> so<00:03:43.880> yeah<00:03:45.130> so<00:03:46.130> I

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
it would be a bad figure so yeah so I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.250 
it would be a bad figure so yeah so I
can<00:03:46.489> just<00:03:46.820> give<00:03:47.000> you<00:03:47.030> another<00:03:47.420> comparison

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
can just give you another comparison

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.199 
can just give you another comparison
with<00:03:48.650> the<00:03:48.769> Ben<00:03:48.920> Tennyson<00:03:49.310> again<00:03:49.519> I<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.980> yeah

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:52.209

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
you can see that this one's like I said

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.630 
you can see that this one's like I said
it's<00:03:55.700> a<00:03:55.730> lot<00:03:55.819> fatter

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:56.640 
it's a lot fatter

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.600 
it's a lot fatter
than<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.180> one<00:03:57.390> and<00:03:58.040> I'm<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.130> gonna<00:03:59.370> give
