00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 and good afternoon to you irina bagnyuk channel 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.429
 Bagir Manor 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.050
 as I said that the most important 

00:00:07.429 --> 00:00:12.630
 lavender pruning is summer 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.179
 Now I will also say that this is the most 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.930
 nice cropping because we get 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.500
 own product right now I will show 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:26.789
 to you that lavender is in my different form 

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:30.240
 so who saw or remembers were bushes 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:33.540
 cut short and they are almost to 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:36.960
 they have less flowering 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:42.510
 a little more here less but it is vertical 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:46.770
 worth more this one was not so short 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:49.079
 shorn him more flowering begins 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.649
 fall apart so let's say and now these two 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.739
 bush I cut them to show not 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.859
 very short and here we see that they 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:02.070
 already collapsed 

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:04.619
 therefore, they will have to shave well 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.930
 let me show you all the haircut, I 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.840
 you can not on camera but show 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.560
 I'll tell you what and how to pay 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.380
 Attention 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.900
 so look here from the bush if you have it 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:20.100
 or young bush it is still vertical 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:22.710
 or let and and elderly or aged 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.330
 but he vertically cut it hard not 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:28.979
 it means we look what 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:31.560
 what are we doing cut we will be here 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 We consider a sprig I will try to show 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.840
 close up here is a twig here it is 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.869
 heights here as you can see already 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:46.979
 small little shoots on the sides 

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:51.180
 so this twig we cut off like this 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:55.320
 way what happens here these here 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.750
 we will have time to grow and bloom in 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:01.439
 August that is like this 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 you track if we so tonsured 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.979
 way then we will have enough 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.300
 first green bush these leaves in 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:14.410
 second this is literally a week on 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.920
 will become increasingly green here of course by 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.530
 it is rather difficult to cut one but somewhere 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:24.490
 1 which you can take a few 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:26.950
 already here so now 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.130
 here we see here it will be they will have time 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.290
 grow over the summer and one more time small 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:34.450
 bloom us yes that is in the end we 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:38.740
 we get pretty neat green 

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:42.820
 Bush is as regards the bushes which 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:45.240
 young bushes did not fall apart or just 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.600
 that's not lounging with lounging 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:52.140
 bushes a little harder but not 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:55.120
 less now I'll show you too 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.270
 so here we have it 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.570
 vertical ved but at the same time we 

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:04.060
 seeing that she was now bent the 

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.280
 we can't eat like that 

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.180
 we cut there we should cut 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.180
 here to here 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 but we see a tendency that she will 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:19.239
 fall so look here we have 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:22.480
 new ones are here now 

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:26.830
 they and their little ones can be seen badly on camera 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:30.010
 but they are there and are still here now! 

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:32.530
 they are not yet visible but they will therefore 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.370
 when the branches are we will have 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.709
 shear off 

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:39.430
 Well, at least if you really feel sorry for you 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:44.920
 like this and even better like this 

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 1 2 3 vertical buds remaining 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:50.590
 still to the sides but only that is she 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:53.220
 would look much better 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:56.160
 bushes and of course we are about cutting and the first 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:04:01.000
 two or three weeks it will be like that 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:06.580
 dry twigs pretty pretty but 

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.830
 what to do because otherwise we will 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:11.070
 fall apart and fall apart and this 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:14.410
 it will simply be impossible so here 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:16.830
 we will have to cut so not necessarily 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:20.109
 each branch so to consider 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:22.750
 there are no dots there they are they are 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:23.380
 everywhere and they will be as soon as we have it 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:26.530
 composed 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.590
 Burn it all gives an incentive to 

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:32.190
 new buds woke up so that's how 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:40.240
 take and all neatly here and so 

00:04:32.190 --> 00:04:43.950
 so here we cut off without fear it now 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:48.360
 considered in detail but because 

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:51.940
 showed you about such a collapsed 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:54.190
 bushes are not so visible during the shearing you 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.430
 notice that there are some branches 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:05:00.670
 which were completely dry on them was not 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.030
 nothing green is sometimes here 

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:05.770
 it is almost all dry and only 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:11.230
 little, that's the way we do them 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:14.500
 and clean here so that there will be such bushes 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:15.480
 there will be bushes more green well, nothing 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.410
 can you do 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:22.440
 sometimes either because of the weather or just because 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.510
 bush age 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.140
 happens you have to rejuvenate but 

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:31.180
 over the summer they will be restored 

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.860
 neat little green here for the future 

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:35.230
 here are these two bushes 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.840
 which I will see for three weeks now 

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:40.300
 so unsightly for next year 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.090
 they will be like the first to show 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:47.200
 they are neat and nice 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.660
 so here cut no fear 

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:52.660
 these flowers are beautiful go to tea 

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:55.750
 lovely go to decorate their house 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:57.880
 wonderful smell so good luck 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.450
