talk<00:00:07.080> about<00:00:07.230> jump<00:00:07.620> vanish<00:00:07.890> canceling<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.580> how

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
talk about jump vanish canceling and how

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.379 
talk about jump vanish canceling and how
to<00:00:08.849> incorporate<00:00:09.570> it<00:00:09.840> in<00:00:10.080> your<00:00:10.290> game<00:00:11.120> now<00:00:12.120> first

you<00:00:57.570> might<00:00:57.899> be<00:00:58.020> asking<00:00:58.260> Virgo<00:00:58.559> well<00:00:58.710> how<00:00:58.829> do<00:00:58.890> I

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
you might be asking Virgo well how do I

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.830 
you might be asking Virgo well how do I
use<00:00:59.219> this<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.489> my<00:00:59.520> regular<00:00:59.730> game<00:01:00.059> I<00:01:00.300> noticed<00:01:00.780> a

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
use this in my regular game I noticed a

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.240 
use this in my regular game I noticed a
lot<00:01:00.930> of<00:01:00.989> you<00:01:01.140> like<00:01:01.350> to<00:01:01.559> jump<00:01:01.739> vanish<00:01:02.039> but<00:01:02.190> I

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
lot of you like to jump vanish but I

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.709 
lot of you like to jump vanish but I
don't<00:01:02.520> see<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.789> jump<00:01:03.000> vanish<00:01:03.300> canceling

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
don't see you jump vanish canceling

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.870 
don't see you jump vanish canceling
admittedly<00:01:04.500> I<00:01:04.589> wasn't<00:01:05.159> even<00:01:05.339> doing<00:01:05.700> too<00:01:05.820> many

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.850 
trying to anticipate where I'm going
that<00:01:41.610> way<00:01:41.670> I'll<00:01:42.020> cancel<00:01:43.020> right<00:01:43.229> into<00:01:43.560> a<00:01:43.590> burst

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
that way I'll cancel right into a burst

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.139 
that way I'll cancel right into a burst
where<00:01:44.040> it's<00:01:44.130> canceled<00:01:44.460> right<00:01:44.490> into<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> counter

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
where it's canceled right into a counter

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.130 
where it's canceled right into a counter
sometimes<00:01:45.899> I'll<00:01:46.110> cancel<00:01:46.500> into<00:01:46.740> a<00:01:46.920> guard<00:01:47.369> just

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:48.140 
sometimes I'll cancel into a guard just

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:50.330 
sometimes I'll cancel into a guard just
a<00:01:49.140> perfect<00:01:49.500> block<00:01:49.590> the<00:01:49.770> opponent<00:01:50.130> and<00:01:50.189> then

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
a perfect block the opponent and then

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:51.679 
a perfect block the opponent and then
grab<00:01:50.490> them<00:01:50.700> afterwards<00:01:51.180> these<00:01:51.390> are<00:01:51.540> just

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
grab them afterwards these are just

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.359 
grab them afterwards these are just
little<00:01:51.869> minor<00:01:52.140> strategies<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.979> you<00:01:53.100> can<00:01:53.250> do

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
little minor strategies that you can do

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.310 
little minor strategies that you can do
so<00:01:54.000> uh<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.450> next<00:01:54.600> few<00:01:54.780> clips<00:01:54.990> that<00:01:55.140> I'm<00:01:55.200> going

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
so uh the next few clips that I'm going

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:56.300 
so uh the next few clips that I'm going
to<00:01:55.380> show<00:01:55.470> you<00:01:55.500> guys<00:01:55.710> this<00:01:55.860> is<00:01:56.009> gonna<00:01:56.100> be<00:01:56.219> a

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
to show you guys this is gonna be a

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.639 
to show you guys this is gonna be a
little<00:01:56.460> exhibition<00:01:57.030> of<00:01:57.719> me<00:01:58.049> jump<00:01:58.380> vanish

00:01:58.639 --> 00:01:58.649 
little exhibition of me jump vanish

00:01:58.649 --> 00:02:03.410 
little exhibition of me jump vanish
cancelling<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.759> uses<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.570> I<00:02:02.210> will<00:02:03.210> say

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
cancelling and the uses of it I will say

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.289 
cancelling and the uses of it I will say
don't<00:02:03.719> just<00:02:04.189> do<00:02:05.189> it<00:02:05.219> willy-nilly<00:02:05.610> you<00:02:06.060> want<00:02:06.240> to

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
don't just do it willy-nilly you want to

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.240 
don't just do it willy-nilly you want to
do<00:02:06.390> it<00:02:06.540> with<00:02:06.659> a<00:02:06.689> purpose<00:02:06.869> a<00:02:07.259> lot<00:02:07.950> of<00:02:08.039> people

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
do it with a purpose a lot of people

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.160 
do it with a purpose a lot of people
jump<00:02:08.459> vanish<00:02:08.789> willy-nilly<00:02:09.450> really<00:02:09.899> sporadic

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
jump vanish willy-nilly really sporadic

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.600 
jump vanish willy-nilly really sporadic
and<00:02:10.470> really<00:02:10.649> random<00:02:10.860> but<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.250> want<00:02:11.400> to<00:02:11.430> make

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
and really random but you want to make

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.550 
and really random but you want to make
sure<00:02:11.640> you<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.180> control

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
sure you have control

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.530 
sure you have control
your<00:02:12.739> character<00:02:13.099> at<00:02:13.550> all<00:02:13.760> times<00:02:14.030> because<00:02:14.330> if

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
your character at all times because if

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.750 
your character at all times because if
you<00:02:14.630> lose<00:02:14.810> control<00:02:14.900> of<00:02:15.230> your<00:02:15.290> character<00:02:15.760> you

you lose control of your character you

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.180 
you lose control of your character you

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
might lose control of the match so when

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.620 
might lose control of the match so when
