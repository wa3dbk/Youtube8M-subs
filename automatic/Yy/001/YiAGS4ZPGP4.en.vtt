00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
paper on the outside edges now I left

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.320

these<00:02:33.739> pages<00:02:34.070> really<00:02:34.550> empty<00:02:34.880> because<00:02:35.180> I

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
these pages really empty because I

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.970 
these pages really empty because I
wanted<00:02:35.660> a<00:02:35.840> lot<00:02:36.050> of<00:02:36.170> room<00:02:36.320> for<00:02:36.350> the<00:02:36.680> pictures

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
wanted a lot of room for the pictures

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:40.420 
wanted a lot of room for the pictures
because<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.520> book<00:02:37.670> is<00:02:37.790> so<00:02:37.970> small<00:02:38.650> this<00:02:39.650> book

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
because the book is so small this book

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.860 
because the book is so small this book
would<00:02:40.550> be<00:02:40.610> really<00:02:40.820> great<00:02:41.090> for<00:02:41.120> wallet-sized

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
would be really great for wallet-sized

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.410 
would be really great for wallet-sized
pictures<00:02:42.350> you<00:02:43.310> can<00:02:43.430> put<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:43.640> vertical<00:02:44.060> one<00:02:44.209> over

here and a horizontal and over here and

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:47.350 
here and a horizontal and over here and
they<00:02:46.130> would<00:02:46.280> fit<00:02:46.459> great<00:02:46.670> and<00:02:46.880> still<00:02:47.150> leave<00:02:47.330> a

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
they would fit great and still leave a

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.290 
they would fit great and still leave a
little<00:02:47.630> bit<00:02:47.780> of<00:02:47.840> room<00:02:48.080> for<00:02:48.350> journaling<00:02:49.300> for

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300 
little bit of room for journaling for

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:52.960 
little bit of room for journaling for
the<00:02:50.360> next<00:02:50.600> pages<00:02:50.840> I<00:02:51.260> use<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.100> background<00:02:52.310> that

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:52.970 
the next pages I use the background that

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.610 
the next pages I use the background that
actually<00:02:53.510> comes<00:02:53.690> in<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:53.989> book<00:02:54.140> which<00:02:54.350> is<00:02:54.500> the

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
actually comes in the book which is the

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.070 
actually comes in the book which is the
line<00:02:54.830> paper<00:02:55.190> it's<00:02:55.820> a<00:02:55.940> pretty<00:02:56.120> thick<00:02:56.390> paper<00:02:56.660> and

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
line paper it's a pretty thick paper and

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.290 
line paper it's a pretty thick paper and
once<00:02:57.320> you<00:02:57.590> cover<00:02:58.040> one<00:02:58.670> side<00:02:58.940> of<00:02:59.060> the<00:02:59.120> paper

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300 
once you cover one side of the paper

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.780 
once you cover one side of the paper
like<00:02:59.720> I<00:02:59.840> cover<00:03:00.050> the<00:03:00.230> back<00:03:00.380> of<00:03:00.590> this<00:03:00.680> one<00:03:00.890> and<00:03:01.100> it

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:01.790 
like I cover the back of this one and it

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:03.640 
like I cover the back of this one and it
ends<00:03:02.180> up<00:03:02.239> being<00:03:02.269> really<00:03:02.660> thick<00:03:02.959> and<00:03:03.200> sturdy<00:03:03.410> so

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
ends up being really thick and sturdy so

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.020 
ends up being really thick and sturdy so
you<00:03:03.739> don't<00:03:03.860> have<00:03:03.950> to<00:03:04.100> worry<00:03:04.250> about<00:03:04.340> a<00:03:04.430> tearing

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:05.030 
you don't have to worry about a tearing

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:07.900 
you don't have to worry about a tearing
at<00:03:05.239> the<00:03:05.720> holes<00:03:05.930> or<00:03:06.260> anything<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:06.650> that<00:03:06.910> this

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
at the holes or anything like that this

over<00:03:10.519> here<00:03:10.760> and<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.030> journaling<00:03:11.390> over<00:03:11.600> here

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:11.780 
over here and then journaling over here

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:13.360 
over here and then journaling over here
and<00:03:12.019> because<00:03:12.380> it's<00:03:12.560> lined<00:03:12.829> it'll<00:03:13.130> make<00:03:13.250> it

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:13.370 
and because it's lined it'll make it

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.250 
and because it's lined it'll make it
really<00:03:13.579> easy<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:14.450> add<00:03:14.540> my<00:03:14.720> journaling<00:03:15.049> I<00:03:15.110> won't

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
really easy to add my journaling I won't

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.420 
really easy to add my journaling I won't
have<00:03:15.380> to<00:03:15.500> worry<00:03:15.650> about<00:03:15.739> going<00:03:15.980> in<00:03:16.250> and<00:03:16.400> making

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
have to worry about going in and making

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.310 
have to worry about going in and making
pencil<00:03:17.269> lines<00:03:17.480> or<00:03:17.720> trying<00:03:17.930> to<00:03:18.019> write<00:03:18.170> in<00:03:18.260> a

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
pencil lines or trying to write in a

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.100 
pencil lines or trying to write in a
straight<00:03:18.530> line<00:03:19.450> but<00:03:20.450> if<00:03:20.570> you<00:03:20.660> don't<00:03:20.840> mind<00:03:20.989> a

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
straight line but if you don't mind a

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.080 
straight line but if you don't mind a
journaling<00:03:21.560> that<00:03:21.799> the<00:03:22.160> ledger<00:03:22.430> papers<00:03:22.820> really

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:23.090 
journaling that the ledger papers really

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:25.210 
journaling that the ledger papers really
keep<00:03:23.269> just<00:03:23.480> as<00:03:23.600> a<00:03:23.630> background<00:03:23.840> so<00:03:24.440> remember

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
keep just as a background so remember

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:26.490 
keep just as a background so remember
that<00:03:25.250> when<00:03:25.519> you're<00:03:25.700> working<00:03:25.880> on<00:03:26.090> your<00:03:26.120> pages

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
that when you're working on your pages

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:29.140 
that when you're working on your pages
for<00:03:27.500> the<00:03:27.560> next<00:03:27.799> page<00:03:27.950> is<00:03:28.130> like<00:03:28.459> just<00:03:28.910> like<00:03:29.030> the

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:29.150 
for the next page is like just like the

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.580 
for the next page is like just like the
other<00:03:29.269> ones<00:03:29.450> I<00:03:29.570> kept<00:03:29.750> a<00:03:29.780> really<00:03:30.049> simple<00:03:30.410> I

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:30.590 
other ones I kept a really simple I

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.110 
other ones I kept a really simple I
didn't<00:03:30.829> really<00:03:30.920> do<00:03:31.100> anything<00:03:31.400> at<00:03:31.610> all<00:03:31.730> on<00:03:31.970> this

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
didn't really do anything at all on this

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:33.699 
didn't really do anything at all on this
page<00:03:32.360> just<00:03:32.630> covered<00:03:32.930> it<00:03:32.959> with<00:03:33.079> the<00:03:33.200> star<00:03:33.440> paper

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:33.709 
page just covered it with the star paper

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:35.830 
page just covered it with the star paper
and<00:03:34.040> then<00:03:34.579> just<00:03:34.760> added<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.120> border<00:03:35.269> strip<00:03:35.660> on

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
and then just added a border strip on

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.440 
and then just added a border strip on
this<00:03:36.019> side<00:03:36.230> I<00:03:36.440> did<00:03:36.980> cut<00:03:37.250> about<00:03:37.519> a<00:03:37.579> half<00:03:37.880> of<00:03:38.060> an

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
this side I did cut about a half of an

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.509 
this side I did cut about a half of an
inch<00:03:38.570> off<00:03:38.840> of<00:03:39.140> the<00:03:39.530> edge<00:03:39.680> here<00:03:40.100> just<00:03:40.400> so<00:03:40.489> that

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519 
inch off of the edge here just so that

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:42.460 
inch off of the edge here just so that
you<00:03:40.700> can<00:03:40.850> see<00:03:41.000> the<00:03:41.120> red<00:03:41.299> border<00:03:41.720> on<00:03:41.870> this<00:03:42.200> side

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
you can see the red border on this side

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.110 
you can see the red border on this side
and<00:03:42.709> then<00:03:43.220> when<00:03:43.370> you're<00:03:43.459> on<00:03:43.610> this<00:03:43.760> page<00:03:43.970> you

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
and then when you're on this page you

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.460 
and then when you're on this page you
can<00:03:44.150> see<00:03:44.390> the<00:03:44.480> star<00:03:44.720> boarder<00:03:45.019> and<00:03:45.140> that's<00:03:45.350> a

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
can see the star boarder and that's a

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.140 
can see the star boarder and that's a
really<00:03:45.620> inexpensive<00:03:46.070> way<00:03:46.579> to<00:03:46.610> add<00:03:46.910> a<00:03:46.940> border

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
really inexpensive way to add a border

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:48.460 
really inexpensive way to add a border
and<00:03:47.390> maybe<00:03:47.510> you'll<00:03:47.630> have<00:03:47.780> to<00:03:47.900> use<00:03:48.079> any<00:03:48.260> more

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
and maybe you'll have to use any more

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.319 
and maybe you'll have to use any more
paper<00:03:48.680> and<00:03:48.980> so<00:03:49.130> you're<00:03:49.700> conserving<00:03:50.239> your

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:50.329 
paper and so you're conserving your

00:03:50.329 --> 00:03:52.210 
paper and so you're conserving your
paper<00:03:50.540> for<00:03:50.870> you<00:03:51.290> know<00:03:51.410> other<00:03:51.590> projects<00:03:52.100> or

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
paper for you know other projects or

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.060 
paper for you know other projects or
another<00:03:52.459> page<00:03:52.730> and<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.870> next<00:03:54.140> pages<00:03:54.350> I<00:03:54.769> left

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
another page and the next pages I left

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.729 
another page and the next pages I left
just<00:03:55.340> completely<00:03:55.700> for<00:03:55.940> journaling<00:03:56.500> the<00:03:57.500> idea

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
just completely for journaling the idea

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:58.620 
just completely for journaling the idea
for<00:03:57.920> this<00:03:58.040> book<00:03:58.100> is

00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:58.630 
for this book is

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:00.600 
for this book is
me<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.840> send<00:03:59.080> out<00:03:59.320> every<00:03:59.710> year<00:03:59.980> just<00:04:00.340> on<00:04:00.460> my

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:00.610 
me to send out every year just on my

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:03.000 
me to send out every year just on my
coffee<00:04:00.820> table<00:04:00.910> or<00:04:01.360> whatever<00:04:01.660> and<00:04:01.900> so<00:04:02.530> I<00:04:02.560> wanted

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 
coffee table or whatever and so I wanted

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.680 
coffee table or whatever and so I wanted
to<00:04:03.070> kind<00:04:03.310> of<00:04:03.490> list<00:04:03.670> all<00:04:03.940> the<00:04:04.000> fourth<00:04:04.390> of<00:04:04.510> July

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:04.690 
to kind of list all the fourth of July

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:07.740 
to kind of list all the fourth of July
traditions<00:04:05.290> that<00:04:05.440> my<00:04:05.620> family<00:04:06.010> has<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.940> know

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
traditions that my family has I know

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.240 
traditions that my family has I know
most<00:04:08.050> people<00:04:08.350> pretty<00:04:08.620> much<00:04:08.710> do<00:04:08.950> the<00:04:09.010> same

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:09.250 
most people pretty much do the same

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:11.070 
most people pretty much do the same
thing<00:04:09.460> every<00:04:09.670> year<00:04:09.730> you<00:04:10.600> know<00:04:10.720> go<00:04:10.900> to<00:04:10.930> the

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080 
thing every year you know go to the

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.660 
thing every year you know go to the
parade<00:04:11.200> and<00:04:11.620> the<00:04:11.650> fireworks<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.490> have<00:04:12.640> a

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
parade and the fireworks and have a

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:14.430 
parade and the fireworks and have a
barbecue<00:04:12.850> and<00:04:13.360> so<00:04:13.870> I<00:04:13.900> thought<00:04:14.170> it<00:04:14.290> would<00:04:14.380> be

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
barbecue and so I thought it would be

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.290 
barbecue and so I thought it would be
fun<00:04:14.650> to<00:04:14.680> list<00:04:15.070> out<00:04:15.250> those<00:04:15.430> traditions<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.090> so

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
fun to list out those traditions and so

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.820 
fun to list out those traditions and so
you<00:04:16.630> know<00:04:16.660> someday<00:04:16.959> you<00:04:17.410> know<00:04:17.500> five<00:04:17.800> years

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:17.830 
you know someday you know five years

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:19.199 
you know someday you know five years
down<00:04:18.160> the<00:04:18.340> road<00:04:18.370> we<00:04:18.700> can<00:04:18.820> look<00:04:18.940> through<00:04:19.120> these

00:04:19.199 --> 00:04:19.209 
down the road we can look through these

00:04:19.209 --> 00:04:21.449 
down the road we can look through these
with<00:04:19.420> our<00:04:19.570> kids<00:04:19.810> and<00:04:20.140> they<00:04:20.650> can<00:04:20.830> remember<00:04:21.250> all

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:21.459 
with our kids and they can remember all

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:24.870 
with our kids and they can remember all
the<00:04:22.090> traditions<00:04:22.480> that<00:04:22.540> we<00:04:22.720> had<00:04:22.840> so<00:04:23.580> next<00:04:24.580> pages

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
the traditions that we had so next pages

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.850 
the traditions that we had so next pages
are<00:04:25.150> really<00:04:25.420> plain<00:04:25.990> and<00:04:26.170> simple<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.770> the

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
are really plain and simple just the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:27.960 
are really plain and simple just the
same<00:04:27.070> so<00:04:27.250> we<00:04:27.370> have<00:04:27.520> plenty<00:04:27.670> of<00:04:27.820> room<00:04:27.940> for

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
same so we have plenty of room for

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:30.720 
same so we have plenty of room for
photos<00:04:28.450> I<00:04:28.600> didn't<00:04:29.290> add<00:04:29.440> the<00:04:29.470> parade<00:04:30.130> along<00:04:30.400> the

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:30.730 
photos I didn't add the parade along the

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.000 
photos I didn't add the parade along the
side<00:04:30.970> and<00:04:31.240> one<00:04:31.420> trick<00:04:31.840> I<00:04:32.050> have<00:04:32.380> when<00:04:32.680> adding

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.010 
side and one trick I have when adding

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:34.470 
side and one trick I have when adding
these<00:04:33.100> letter<00:04:33.310> stickers<00:04:33.580> because<00:04:33.940> you're<00:04:34.360> in

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
these letter stickers because you're in
