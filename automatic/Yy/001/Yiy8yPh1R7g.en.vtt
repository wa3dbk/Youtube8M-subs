 Hey guys I'm ticas all 

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:06.210
 laces of serra 2 and this is minecraft 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:08.590
 we are again with the issue of 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.630
 secret blocks valera al has suit 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:13.240
 20 and this time I'm not going to bring that much 

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.309
 brought 10 and it is possible that the next 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.050
 Do not bring another 10 not sure 

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.270
 because I do not think there are so many left 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.369
 secret blocks to discover so 

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.529
 well let's start is Friday and play 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:24.850
 tricks but good and also plays well 

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:26.350
 is what it is worth it should also bring 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:28.480
 a little drop air and others but good 

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:31.259
 I brought and this video and drop the 2 what 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.590
 we will leave for later 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:39.780
 good to start we have here the 3 or 3 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.780
 what are we going to call the hype gates 

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:46.719
 so in lowercase you presented in 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:50.870
 lowercase is not going to come out 38 

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:52.219
 364 and he gives us this egg is worth this egg 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.539
 that if we try to place it, it does not 

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:56.390
 place anywhere this played 

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:59.479
 it would really be the block that there is 

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:01.670
 right in the in the dolphin portal 

00:00:59.479 --> 00:01:03.229
 where is the dragon you know that in the 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.449
 fat towers and target at the end of the 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:07.039
 tower there is a kind of light or ray of 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.740
 light that goes upwards in agreement that 

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:11.580
 he cures the dragon for this would be the 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.590
 block that vale 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:17.640
 and it comes out as an egg but good thing happens 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:23.160
 in the world then we have the 74 is to say 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.870
 the same then 74 and ready that goes up and it 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.790
 blocks the normal and current rest worth 

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:30.370
 but this let's go let's put the other 

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:33.490
 is here 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.170
 red the other is worth and I put what the 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.050
 normal rest and current but this is 

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:41.040
 different because you see is like 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.900
 on and we put it 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.460
 they are lit blocks from the rest of 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.990
 agreement is the block on that that 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.960
 there is the power off this is the power 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:53.810
 it works better 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:58.280
 well we removed ok that there and this out 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.280
 we have here the 117 

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:04.049
 117 64 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:06.780
 this would be what would be the subject of 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.039
 beige options but he has today let's say 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.349
 a different month because it's really 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:15.860
 different from normal positions you see 

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:18.050
 the drawing that is totally different 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:20.240
 although later it is the same not to find 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.630
 well the difference because here it is called 

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:24.190
 besides also different in order 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.630
 not against it was still different and 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.620
 you know then super 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.620
 nothing we keep there 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.140
 that more than more we have in 104 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.220
 why 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:43.460
 of 464 that gives us this and this I do not know if 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.750
 is going to get planted 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:50.150
 there is 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:50.150
 it's a kind of seed worth 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.280
 pumpkin 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:58.360
 go in the while I put it through 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.360
 new 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.150
 great water not with the wheel I know 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.190
 that you can take this, but it's that 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.190
 I forgot sometimes the 93 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:17.700
 93 64 

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:20.310
 It is Repeater off it has 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.550
 different form to this repeater of all 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:25.680
 life as you see 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:28.230
 and good air of moxos another block these 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.700
 objectives that there are out there that more than 

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.700
 more the 99 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.659
 99 64 and give us this block that you have 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.370
 someone is where is this language from 

00:03:38.659 --> 00:03:42.420
 you can not get mushrooms like this 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:45.720
 as well 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.640
 so good here we have it very cool 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.120
 the truth 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.530
 we keep more things 

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:54.530
 the 127 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:04:01.750
 127 64 and nothing gives us what would be the 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:09.160
 he is cocoa 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.160
 there soon here with a couple 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.230
 what do you think 

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:20.109
 they destroy themselves it's just called that out there 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.320
 OK 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.550
 more little things plus little things 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:26.550

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:33.710
 64 what is this here, I'll go, it 's 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.240
 what you have there that you carry as in the 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:38.990
 sky 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:41.930
 is the rope of agreement that also 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.650
 you can take it out of the web I think 

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.650
 remember 

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:52.330
 You see the web also comes out in this 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:55.180
 Case is the date you see 

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:56.680
 and good that we keep here at 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.990
 outside 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.990
 more things the 140 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.729
 Well, that's what the pots of agreement 

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:14.380
 a different way that has the 

00:05:10.729 --> 00:05:14.380
 pots and here we have it 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:22.440

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:30.070
 identical identical to this one here 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:32.650
 no uncle are not identical this as you see 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:34.920
 we put it on the ground 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:34.920
 does this 

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:44.280
 in plain sight 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:44.280
 is above the game you see it true 

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:53.180
