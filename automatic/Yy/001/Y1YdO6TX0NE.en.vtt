00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
take a look at the different sizes so I

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.990 
take a look at the different sizes so I
did<00:00:05.670> cuff<00:00:06.000> the<00:00:06.330> little<00:00:06.629> ones<00:00:07.400> the<00:00:08.400> gamma<00:00:08.700> blue

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
did cuff the little ones the gamma blue

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000 
did cuff the little ones the gamma blue
Jordan<00:00:09.480> lever<00:00:09.660> rituals<00:00:10.139> as<00:00:10.290> well<00:00:10.469> so<00:00:10.800> I

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:11.010

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
okay so here you have my sides with size

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.109 
okay so here you have my sides with size
10<00:00:19.140> that<00:00:19.680> we're<00:00:19.830> all<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.189> familiar<00:00:20.279> with<00:00:20.609> so

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
I see smoke so there with the jump man

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.269 
I see smoke so there with the jump man
showing<00:00:28.859> through<00:00:29.070> gamma<00:00:29.609> mu<00:00:29.849> gamma<00:00:30.090> blue<00:00:31.279> got

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
showing through gamma mu gamma blue got

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.670 
showing through gamma mu gamma blue got
a<00:00:32.309> blue<00:00:32.520> jump<00:00:32.820> man<00:00:33.000> and<00:00:33.690> then<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.260> have<00:00:34.469> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
mesh tongue all right mesh upper alright

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.209 
mesh tongue all right mesh upper alright
patent<00:00:40.920> leather<00:00:41.070> going<00:00:41.309> around<00:00:41.670> 360<00:00:42.260> okay<00:00:43.260> you

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
patent leather going around 360 okay you

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.700 
patent leather going around 360 okay you
would<00:00:44.370> find<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.730> same<00:00:45.030> exact<00:00:45.480> thing<00:00:45.780> on<00:00:46.140> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
would find the same exact thing on the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.020 
would find the same exact thing on the
kid<00:00:47.329> size<00:00:48.329> you<00:00:49.200> have<00:00:49.350> the<00:00:49.559> yellow<00:00:50.309> 23<00:00:50.910> in<00:00:50.969> the

see you have gum a blue and yellow on
the<00:01:00.780> bottom<00:01:01.579> there<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.760> then<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.180> have<00:01:03.210> the

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
the bottom there and then you have the

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.140 
the bottom there and then you have the
jump<00:01:04.260> man<00:01:04.439> it's<00:01:04.799> in<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.070> back<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.729> the<00:01:05.880> shoe

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
jump man it's in the back of the shoe

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.840 
jump man it's in the back of the shoe
this<00:01:06.420> time<00:01:06.830> it's<00:01:07.830> not<00:01:08.040> right<00:01:08.369> in<00:01:08.520> the<00:01:08.640> middle

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
this time it's not right in the middle

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.820 
this time it's not right in the middle
showing<00:01:09.270> through<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.750> but<00:01:10.500> it's<00:01:10.650> actually

jump<00:01:18.659> man<00:01:19.490> on<00:01:20.490> the<00:01:20.580> side<00:01:20.820> there<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.930> then<00:01:22.110> of

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
jump man on the side there and then of

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.749 
jump man on the side there and then of
course<00:01:22.409> you<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:24.590> the<00:01:25.590> gamma<00:01:25.890> blue<00:01:26.189> I<00:01:26.460> mean

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
course you have the gamma blue I mean

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.920 
course you have the gamma blue I mean
the<00:01:27.150> yellow<00:01:27.530> jump<00:01:28.530> man<00:01:29.119> on<00:01:30.119> the<00:01:30.390> sole<00:01:30.630> on<00:01:30.840> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
the yellow jump man on the sole on the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.080 
the yellow jump man on the sole on the
inside<00:01:31.290> okay<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:32.820> this<00:01:33.000> shoes<00:01:34.310> know<00:01:35.310> a<00:01:35.610> little

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
inside okay so this shoes know a little

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:39.859 
inside okay so this shoes know a little
bit<00:01:36.210> closer<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.900> main<00:01:37.700> name<00:01:38.700> size<00:01:39.060> when

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
bit closer to the main name size when

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.600 
bit closer to the main name size when
you<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.110> up<00:01:40.200> to<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.470> one-and-a-half<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
you get up to the one-and-a-half and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.139 
you get up to the one-and-a-half and
when<00:01:41.700> you<00:01:41.759> get<00:01:41.880> to<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.119> baby<00:01:42.860> some<00:01:43.860> more

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:44.149 
when you get to the baby some more

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.210 
when you get to the baby some more
changes<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.630> bottom<00:01:46.020> is<00:01:46.409> the<00:01:46.560> same<00:01:46.799> as<00:01:47.070> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
changes the bottom is the same as this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:47.830 
changes the bottom is the same as this
one

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
one

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.749 
one
alright<00:01:48.840> so<00:01:49.020> you<00:01:49.079> got<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.439> you<00:01:50.159> got<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.490> gamma

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
alright so you got the you got the gamma

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:52.370 
alright so you got the you got the gamma
blue<00:01:51.030> with<00:01:51.149> the<00:01:51.270> yellow<00:01:51.479> going<00:01:51.780> across<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.320> the

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
back and that you have the jump man in

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.620 
back and that you have the jump man in
the<00:01:53.909> back<00:01:54.149> there<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.720> then<00:01:55.909> you<00:01:56.909> do<00:01:57.119> have<00:01:57.360> the

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
blue jump man there but then instead of

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.920 
blue jump man there but then instead of
in<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> back<00:02:02.549> you<00:02:02.850> have<00:02:03.000> a<00:02:03.030> little<00:02:03.360> pull<00:02:03.659> tab

in the back you have a little pull tab

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.800 
in the back you have a little pull tab
here<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.700> pull<00:02:05.700> the<00:02:05.880> shoe<00:02:06.090> onto<00:02:06.420> the<00:02:06.509> baby's
