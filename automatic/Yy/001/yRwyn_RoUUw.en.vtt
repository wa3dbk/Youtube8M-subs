00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.699
 Sponsor of the German Sports University 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.320
 Cologne were part of the evening program 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:30.019
 also awarded the Germany scholarships 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:32.160
 who went to 27 students this year 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:34.620
 the students are supported with 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.510
 financial support for one 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.180
 Half of the Bund and the Länder took over 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:40.890
 the other half was driving this 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.440
 Year twelve different pen here 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.899
 including the official sponsor of the 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:51.180
 amis trainees world.com professor doctor 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.370
 Peter peter brüggemann opened the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.949
 evening with his lecture on the topic 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.590
 the event today joggers tomorrow 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.750
 patient whose conclusion from person to 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.250
 Person to be pulled differently 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.350
 I think we have to 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:06.030
 worked it out once 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:08.549
 depends on the individual load 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.140
 while walking is like the requirements 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:11.880
 are like the preparation of tissue 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.939
 are and how then the individual 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.509
 tissue responds whether it is now to the disaster 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.479
 So it comes to killing off destruction 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.450
 Cartilage cells, for example, or if it comes to that 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.770
 that this fabric adapts 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:29.970
 respectively, that is no destruction 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:32.540
 next to brüggemann took the 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.310
 Ultra Marathon Runner Birgit Lennartz 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.650
 sports doctor professor doctor med hans 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.600
 Georg Predel and sports management 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:41.270
 professor doctor christoph meyer 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.299
 at the subsequent podium discussion 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.740
 Part of the right approach 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:50.750
 the theme is here 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.190
 crucial as birgit lennartz knows 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.050
 by once being European 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:57.690
 and also physis lets examine heart 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:58.680
 moderate and then yourself 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.440
 maybe in professional hands 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.760
 so someone just dares 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.410
 the theoretical and practical 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.479
 has experience in running 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:07.650
 I have to start very slowly 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.770
 Of course I should first 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:12.870
 let examine whether a skeleton system 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.550
 obmann musculoskeletal system in 

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:16.709
 Order is my cardiovascular system 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.500
 all right and then I have to 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.709
 very slowly to this specific form 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.500
 of mechanical stress 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:27.000
 unless I have experience 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.520
 the evening was moderated by sport 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.980
 journalist wolf dieter poschmann the am 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:35.250
 the end of the event clearly 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.410
 The event should not be defined 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.570
 lead to the desire to run 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.180
 she does not lose at all but she should 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:44.190
 cause you to think carefully 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:47.190
 which prerequisites one which 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:50.040
 track length chooses one has a bit 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:53.190
 discussed that if and when you have 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.260
 the dangers of running described 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.350
 I also found that very emphatic 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.420
 I believe a big addendum 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.620
 leave with the people and have 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.610
 maybe one or the other too 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.620
 made thoughtful 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.690
 despite many aspects and 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.060
 most different opinions are you 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.130
 athlete scientist and doctors to 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.470
 conclusion of the discussion on the podium 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:15.780
 what is important when running and 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:18.810
 what do the spectators and runners say 

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:20.430
 To take heart should be easy 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.310
 to show the people that time 

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:24.209
 not only is healthy but that too 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:27.000
 if you do not ask us 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:28.709
 prepared accordingly negative 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.030
 can follow 

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:31.560
 I would not run it from 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.900
 basically advise against running 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.650
 basically the normal and natural 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.629
 form of locomotion 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.079
 only this must be kept in the frame and 

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.640
 this may not be a priori in long 

00:03:41.079 --> 00:03:44.829
 Distances high speeds 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:45.450
 connected with just big load 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:47.879
 occur 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.840
 the second cologne evening the 

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.909
 sports science also thrilled in 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:54.099
 countless spectators this year again 

00:03:51.909 --> 00:03:56.400
 and make you curious about the next one 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:56.400
 event
