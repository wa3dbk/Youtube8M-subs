00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
it with a switch outside so we need to

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.429 
it with a switch outside so we need to
shoot<00:01:07.500> this<00:01:07.650> baseball<00:01:08.159> with<00:01:08.909> your<00:01:09.090> gun<00:01:09.439> every

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
starts off slow so what we do we'll

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.260 
starts off slow so what we do we'll
shoot<00:01:15.990> it<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.290> minute<00:01:16.640> there<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.790> go<00:01:17.909> boom
