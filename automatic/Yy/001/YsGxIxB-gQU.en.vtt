00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:06.070
 the tests began in the science lab the first step was to discover 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:10.120
 the amount of bic cells that the bottles could carry being part 

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.120
 content in physics and chemistry 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.610
 the study of intensity in materials he was also acting of the facts 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.740
 they got it together with the other without year dollar a way of using it and if 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.570
 he would refuse physical fluctuation of the facts the going to practices to build 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.069
 An ediction vessel is with pet bottles 

00:00:31.069 --> 00:00:34.450
 ready calculations to put the studies into practice. 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:39.510
 and got it right, two eco-friendly kayaks were built for 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.810
 each vessel was used for 130 pet bottles in addition to pvc tubes 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:51.680
 each one, taking from two to four occupants and supporting up to 150 kilos 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.530
 idea of ​​the project came from this biologist according to him the intention is to teach the 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.130
 population to build the transport without the need to cut 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.130
 trees we will take to the riverside population 

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:08.250
 which is a way of showing that there are alternative climate songs 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.740
 different from exits trees on the river's edge 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.620
 the school now prepares for a new phase of the project the idea 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:19.930
 is to place the kayaks in the waters of the Paraíba and will run 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.230
 identify the level of river pollution 

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.190
 with the help of satellite imagery this geography teacher 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.210
 already studied the route of the river where the stars will sail if we do not 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.650
 is delaying the transvestite more stands out is that if we choose 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:37.270
 some points 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:38.250
 that's right 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.250
 and then we're going to harvest this material 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 150 students were involved in the project 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.659
 and for them the work was worth still I like the textile 

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.230
 first fall in the water 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:54.850
 but it was very good when the parents were good both of us have 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.950
 with the exit of another installment the request has been filed is an opportunity 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.950
 good for people but the people who 

00:02:03.259 --> 00:02:04.060
 he access 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.500
 any kind of comparison the lowest incomes
