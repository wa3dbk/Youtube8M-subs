00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:06.020
 What about kids I always cobra 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:08.300
 play the call of duty black ops' and good 

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:09.490
 let's talk a bit about the new call on 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.589
 you the charge 

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.839
 as you know my videos well another day 

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:16.760
 saying they are going in the trailer vince 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.710
 a trailer in a very short trailer and in 

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.160
 the one who did not know anything basically were 

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.170
 real actors and it looked there will be a little 

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.300
 of the masks and all that yes yes what 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:29.539
 you want to see you have the other one right now 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.699
 video in an annotation on the screen and 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.579
 good what they see I'm going to comment 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.559
 the question that we all have is going to 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:38.690
 have a relationship in this new group 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.600
 with the modern warfare since that time 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.149
 that develops infinite worker were 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.309
 the same ones that developed the modern 

00:00:44.149 --> 00:00:47.449
 warfare and good everything except rumored that 

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:50.570
 was going to have something to do with the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.609
 character of moore with flows which is 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.190
 suppose he died not known but good 

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:57.890
 Now I'm going to give my arguments because 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.880
 I think the new charge ticos yes that goes 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.130
 to have relation with the mobile 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.170
 basically what I believe for what it is 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.690
 more have a relationship for what I believe 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:10.210
 that is going to have a relationship is basically 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.120
 because a year ago nothing but getting out 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:18.310
 the black ops 2 was leaked an information 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:20.770
 of getting the first one that the 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.080
 good character rather the translator 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:26.110
 or the bender the bender, better said 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.740
 the price in English the guy who puts the 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:32.680
 voice to face says in English said that 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.850
 was that infinity ward and activision him 

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:34.960
 I had called to make a new 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.180
 work 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:41.770
 it is not known if it would be for the game but 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:44.140
 it would probably be to double some 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:45.580
 kart scene musicians or some 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.430
 we have a lot of hill knows if it will be 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.040
 price present one hundred percent not only 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:53.619
 a part 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.880
 sorry a flashback or something if I do not 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:56.920
 you believe to yourself you will have a 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:00.369
 annotation by the video screen that 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:02.830
 he humbles himself almost six or seven times 8 

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.899
 a few so that you see we want 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:06.610
 I'm inventing nothing and what I saw is that 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:09.610
 really without knowing anything 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.940
 that yes go marked very blurred 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.760
 joe and cs video commenting that they had 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:18.490
 caught the price bender the English or 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.920
 Spanish Spanish will catch it if they want 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:23.530
 fold or take another that looks like 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.750
 the voice but but good is that 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.310
 they basically hired a doubler 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:29.770
 probably to do some 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.410
 scene or I tell you or probably 

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.800
 also to get into something to play at 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:38.680
 one hundred percent the one that messed me 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:41.920
 it's probably that and that means 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.950
 that basically he's going to have a relationship 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.900
 charge ticos with him the modern warfare 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.239
 that this all is an assumption all 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.370
 this is not making me up but I'm 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.000
 deducing so to speak there is nothing 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:56.709
 confirmed if you want to confirm it 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.440
 we will wait six seven months for the months 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:01.180
 missing for November comes 5 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.040
 November the new forest call of duty 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.560
 also be confirmed in case you do not know 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.630
 and good to wait for that time that remains and 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.130
 confirm the same but good when 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:11.570
 I'm making this video that we're 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:14.220
 in May still 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.810
 and that's my guess putting down the 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.390
 comments what you think what you have 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:20.310
 we try, I think that 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:21.720
 basically because it's been 7 months 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.140
 without knowing anything about what was taking 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.590
 to call 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:28.080
 bald ticos and I was already saying another 

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:30.120
 news was that they would catch has 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:32.220
 achieved a del price with which if 

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.890
 price is the main character 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.740
 main of all the modern warfare goes 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.120
 to be then going to enter in part in this 

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:42.540
 new call of duty that I want to say that 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.950
 they have a relationship with him with the new 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.480
 call of duty I do not think there 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:47.100
 liked the voice and they want to put 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:49.740
 another person are totally different 

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.330
 the voice of price I do not think that's that but 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:53.760
 Come on, if that's what I think is an authentic 

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:56.520
 stupidity but well I do not think that's that 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.290
 it's probably basically the fact 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:59.850
 I already told you that I was going to enter with you 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.310
 which means it's going to have 

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:05.280
 relationship with the moment warfare I do not know no 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.250
 I know I have no idea about this I do not know if 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.130
 is going to be joy or if it's going to come out box in 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:13.170
 a part for people being caloric 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:14.880
 if they have a relationship like they see warfare 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:16.890
 over there they probably have something 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.000
 what to see with voice but I do not know if they are 

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:19.290
 I live if he is dead 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.420
 this is all a mystery because there 

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:23.880
 who says that at the beginning of the mission 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:26.400
 where kill 2 says that because he has 

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:28.350
 to wear those anti- renewable suits 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:29.700
 afterwards they are not supposed to pay him a 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.560
 shot in the head they stick it in the 

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.030
 shoulder and no and they do not burn him they see 

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.280
 the product 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:38.130
 in a thousand stories that tell people 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.480
 it can be true it can be a lie what 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.090
 most likely we have been the dead 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.070
 is the mysterious ours speak but more 

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.170
 It is also likely that this new color 

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:48.180
 useful have to do in a certain part with 

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.250
 modern warfare like one hundred percent 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:51.990
 maybe who knows maybe if 

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:53.520
 a continuation of the same divorce only 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:55.110
 they come that what to wear modern 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.910
 warfare 4 because maybe it's a 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.190
 continuation but with a different theme 

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:00.930
 I do not know if you understand what I want 

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:03.750
 say nothing more this has been the 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:06.420
 information my opinion what you want 

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.090
 comment and good as you see the gameplay 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:10.770
 they are going to go they are going to go all I am 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:12.810
 playing for here and if you give me a little 

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:14.670
 more so we are trying 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:17.490
 binary separation because you're in a 

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:20.610
 euro thing that I already have it of euro but 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:23.460
 they go they are thrown discussed and I think that 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.680
 could have done more than 40 to 45 casualties 

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:27.450
 but good and I'm sorry has given you see me 

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:29.490
 now two remain during the market and 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.010
 in the 31 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.230
 so it cost the gameplay and nothing else 

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:36.600
 I hope you enjoyed a greeting and 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.960
 see you in the next are 35 casualties 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:38.960
 you're worth 

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:48.080
 you have to be very well like 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:52.130
 yes 

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:56.490
 loneliness lounge defends itself 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.500
 yes
