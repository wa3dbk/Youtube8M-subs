were doing during the procedure
I<00:04:06.859> went<00:04:07.340> from<00:04:07.669> be<00:04:08.030> at<00:04:08.690> the<00:04:08.870> top<00:04:09.109> of<00:04:09.319> the<00:04:09.410> tooth

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
I went from be at the top of the tooth

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:11.409 
I went from be at the top of the tooth
in<00:04:09.950> the<00:04:10.250> area<00:04:10.579> where<00:04:10.790> the<00:04:10.910> tissue<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.389> very

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
in the area where the tissue is very

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:14.830 
in the area where the tissue is very
soft<00:04:12.079> but<00:04:12.380> very<00:04:12.650> very<00:04:12.889> pliable<00:04:13.220> and<00:04:13.760> it<00:04:14.540> is

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
soft but very very pliable and it is

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.390 
soft but very very pliable and it is
full<00:04:15.049> of<00:04:15.079> collagen<00:04:15.590> so<00:04:15.709> I<00:04:15.769> went<00:04:15.980> through<00:04:16.160> there

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:16.400 
full of collagen so I went through there

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.879 
full of collagen so I went through there
with<00:04:16.700> that<00:04:16.910> with<00:04:17.389> a<00:04:17.419> pinhole<00:04:17.870> and<00:04:18.109> then<00:04:18.169> I

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:18.889 
with that with a pinhole and then I

00:04:18.889 --> 00:04:21.099 
with that with a pinhole and then I
basically<00:04:19.130> disengaged<00:04:20.120> the<00:04:20.329> tissue<00:04:20.630> from<00:04:20.959> the

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
basically disengaged the tissue from the

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.589 
basically disengaged the tissue from the
underlying<00:04:21.560> bone<00:04:21.859> and<00:04:22.190> then<00:04:22.970> I<00:04:23.120> was<00:04:23.270> able<00:04:23.419> then

00:04:23.589 --> 00:04:23.599 
underlying bone and then I was able then

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:28.360 
underlying bone and then I was able then
to<00:04:24.220> basically<00:04:25.220> drape<00:04:25.789> the<00:04:26.599> the<00:04:27.200> gums<00:04:27.770> down<00:04:28.070> to

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:28.370 
to basically drape the the gums down to

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.640 
to basically drape the the gums down to
where<00:04:28.550> I<00:04:28.580> wanted<00:04:28.849> to<00:04:29.000> go<00:04:29.150> and<00:04:29.419> then<00:04:30.080> and<00:04:30.380> then<00:04:30.530> I

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
where I wanted to go and then and then I

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.469 
where I wanted to go and then and then I
stabilized<00:04:31.159> it<00:04:31.370> with<00:04:31.490> the<00:04:31.610> collagen<00:04:32.090> strips

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
stabilized it with the collagen strips

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:34.690 
stabilized it with the collagen strips
and<00:04:32.690> put<00:04:33.289> it<00:04:33.409> between<00:04:33.530> the<00:04:33.680> teeth

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
and put it between the teeth

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.940 
and put it between the teeth
and<00:04:34.790> that's<00:04:35.390> about<00:04:35.570> it<00:04:35.720> so<00:04:36.140> the<00:04:36.290> secret<00:04:36.440> is<00:04:36.710> to

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:36.950 
and that's about it so the secret is to

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:40.270 
and that's about it so the secret is to
go<00:04:37.580> from<00:04:37.820> or<00:04:38.120> Safi<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.750> went<00:04:38.960> easier<00:04:39.350> there<00:04:40.010> was

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.280 
go from or Safi it went easier there was

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.160 
go from or Safi it went easier there was
easier<00:04:40.610> to<00:04:40.760> approach<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.270> tooth<00:04:41.510> well<00:04:41.930> black

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:42.170 
easier to approach the tooth well black

00:04:42.170 --> 00:04:43.930 
easier to approach the tooth well black

remember<00:04:48.620> it's<00:04:48.740> a<00:04:48.800> fine<00:04:49.040> line<00:04:49.280> between

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
remember it's a fine line between

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.720 
remember it's a fine line between
healthy<00:04:50.960> clean<00:04:51.290> teeth<00:04:51.620> and<00:04:51.980> over<00:04:52.250> brushing

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:52.730 
healthy clean teeth and over brushing

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:54.700 
healthy clean teeth and over brushing
with<00:04:52.850> hard<00:04:53.180> bristles<00:04:53.720> so<00:04:53.900> be<00:04:54.110> careful<00:04:54.530> use<00:04:54.680> a

00:04:54.700 --> 00:04:54.710 
with hard bristles so be careful use a

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.040 
with hard bristles so be careful use a
soft<00:04:55.070> toothbrush<00:04:55.670> and<00:04:55.970> if<00:04:56.240> you<00:04:56.360> see<00:04:56.600> receding

00:04:57.040 --> 00:04:57.050 
soft toothbrush and if you see receding

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.720 
soft toothbrush and if you see receding
gumline<00:04:57.260> taking<00:04:57.890> shape<00:04:58.070> is<00:04:58.190> another<00:04:58.310> reason

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
gumline taking shape is another reason

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.490 
gumline taking shape is another reason
to<00:04:58.790> visit<00:04:58.880> your<00:04:59.150> dentist<00:04:59.270> a<00:04:59.660> couple<00:05:00.200> of<00:05:00.260> times
