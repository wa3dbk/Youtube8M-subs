various tiers modules for each one of
those<00:00:22.800> tiers<00:00:23.160> and<00:00:23.340> then<00:00:23.670> various<00:00:24.000> levels<00:00:24.449> for

each<00:00:24.720> one<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.930> those<00:00:25.080> modules<00:00:25.289> so<00:00:26.039> today<00:00:26.279> I

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
each one of those modules so today I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.800 
each one of those modules so today I
like<00:00:26.580> to<00:00:26.609> cover<00:00:26.880> the<00:00:27.779> food<00:00:27.960> module<00:00:28.470> level<00:00:29.310> one

like to cover the food module level one
the<00:00:30.810> food<00:00:31.019> module<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.619> part<00:00:31.859> of<00:00:31.890> my<00:00:32.040> tier<00:00:32.340> one

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the food module is part of my tier one

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.340 
the food module is part of my tier one

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
then level 3 is more of a you know worst

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.120 
then level 3 is more of a you know worst
case<00:01:21.509> scenario<00:01:22.049> amount<00:01:22.409> of<00:01:22.470> food<00:01:22.619> storage<00:01:22.860> so

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
case scenario amount of food storage so

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.590

whatever that is for you whether that be
90<00:01:25.229> days<00:01:25.409> or<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.710> year's<00:01:25.920> worth<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.270> how

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
90 days or a year's worth so that's how

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:29.390 
90 days or a year's worth so that's how
I<00:01:27.479> have<00:01:27.930> mine<00:01:28.170> organized<00:01:28.650> so<00:01:29.070> I<00:01:29.100> know<00:01:29.189> this

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
I have mine organized so I know this

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.130 
I have mine organized so I know this
might<00:01:29.610> be<00:01:29.640> fairly<00:01:30.090> basic<00:01:30.299> for<00:01:30.689> a<00:01:30.720> lot<00:01:30.869> of<00:01:30.900> us

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
might be fairly basic for a lot of us

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.390 
might be fairly basic for a lot of us
for<00:01:31.500> beginners<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:31.920> think<00:01:32.070> this<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.310> good

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
for beginners I think this is a good

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
for beginners I think this is a good
place<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.640> start<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> want<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.079> have

place to start and what I want to have

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.840 
place to start and what I want to have
for<00:01:34.409> my<00:01:34.500> food<00:01:34.770> module<00:01:35.189> is<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.400> want<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.610> be<00:01:35.700> able

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
so it's not going to be anything like

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.810 
so it's not going to be anything like
your<00:01:57.719> mountain<00:01:58.079> house<00:01:58.229> Pro<00:01:58.590> packs<00:01:58.920> or<00:01:59.219> maybe

the Maine State bars for example those

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.709 
the Maine State bars for example those
are<00:02:01.530> more<00:02:01.829> of<00:02:01.920> a<00:02:02.040> emergency<00:02:02.670> food<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.689> I

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
would be least likely to use so the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.300

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
level one is going to be stuff that's

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.510 
level one is going to be stuff that's
used<00:02:09.810> all<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.259> time<00:02:10.470> here<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.069> household

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:31.980 
so this is baby peppers level one food
module<00:06:30.370> that<00:06:30.909> concludes<00:06:31.330> all<00:06:31.450> of<00:06:31.599> the<00:06:31.659> items

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:33.520 
that I carry in my level

00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:35.460 
that I carry in my level
food<00:06:33.789> modules<00:06:34.300> as<00:06:34.780> you<00:06:34.930> can<00:06:35.080> see<00:06:35.169> this<00:06:35.289> is<00:06:35.440> very

basic<00:06:35.860> and<00:06:36.190> simple<00:06:36.400> and<00:06:36.699> concept<00:06:37.210> but<00:06:37.330> I<00:06:37.389> think

00:06:37.589 --> 00:06:37.599 
basic and simple and concept but I think

00:06:37.599 --> 00:06:39.180 
basic and simple and concept but I think
it's<00:06:37.690> an<00:06:37.750> important<00:06:38.139> thing<00:06:38.169> to<00:06:38.410> have<00:06:38.440> as<00:06:39.009> far
