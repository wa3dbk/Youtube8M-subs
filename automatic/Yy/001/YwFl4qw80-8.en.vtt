 pointed gabon and the pot you have it 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:45.580
 often spilled on your head when they 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.580
 were small damages 

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:50.870
 that's how there is only one 

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:53.150
 the only solution is to liquidate feuga 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:54.919
 selectively magic in pitiful a game 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:56.690

00:04:54.919 --> 00:04:58.849
 reproduction for the survival of the species 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:01.840

 if we all played the conac 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:26.580

00:05:24.629 --> 00:05:31.460
 that with mac dergana bears 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:31.460

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.539
 everything did not come bad in everything 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:11.819
 case it's better than 10th and that was 

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:18.270
 too strong as says a match ac and the 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:21.409
 region that's actually what I was trying 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.409
 to say from the beginning 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:41.560

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:52.250

00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:55.250
 Brazil you do not know the big model 

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:57.349

00:06:57.349 --> 00:07:05.960
 mobility in the flowerbeds behind 

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:07.940
 the low tree hurt his neck 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:09.710
 first but preferred south 9 

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.130

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:12.130
 basile 

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.050

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:32.990

00:07:31.670 --> 00:07:34.610
