00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.410
 when we were called to see live 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:15.420
 This crash test we certainly about 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.880
 knew what to expect after all not the first 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.400
 once but volvo security center under 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.800
 Goteborg anyway pleasantly surprised and 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.720
 it's not just about scale this is one of 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.519
 the world's largest such centers already 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.550
 exactly one of the most modern such 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.410
 technology and technology few have 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.329
 pleased another human then with 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.980
 what ease of enthusiasm and at the same 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.290
 time of utmost seriousness and 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.899
 thoroughness Swedes approach this 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:42.450
 difficult procedure really believes 

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:43.730
 what important important business plans do 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.950
 ambitious 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:50.539
 2020 eradicate car accidents like 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.539
 class at least in Sweden 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:55.300
 smart machines need to help themselves 

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.750
 behaved and optimized systems 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.950
 safety active and passive 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.620
 crash tests are just a small part of this. 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.120
 plan but very important we had to 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.490
 see the simulation one of the most 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.190
 common accidents frontal impact 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:13.229
 at a speed of 64 kilometers per hour 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.229
 as a victim elected at 40 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.640
 as you might guess by this 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:20.979
 marks bump machine will be exactly 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.640
 here speed of 40 miles per hour is about 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:26.080
 four kilometers 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.259
 partition walls metal bendable 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.720
 car bumps introduced so-called 25 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:33.520
 in percentage overlap, imagine that 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.110
 obstacle saw drivers tried 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.360
 dodge but did not have time 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.640
 the car was stuffed with the sensor turned off 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.869
 all kinds of wires appliances flooded 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.119
 the entire cabin and trunk 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:44.910
 then every centimeter will be measured 

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:47.950
 analyze every split second 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:50.800
 collisions need weight this center we 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.270
 opened in 2010 ever since its constantly 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.729
 improve we can reproduce 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.830
 almost any accident we spend 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:59.050
 about three hundred tests a year almost 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.340
 every day we break cars plus 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.470
 computer simulations 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.630
 each model released on the market is 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:07.149
 or dozens of other tests 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.459
 the collision itself happens quickly on 

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.440
 here is a long complex 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.170
 well, this is our main actor 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:17.950
 dummy he's rubber well here's the top of it 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:20.050
 quite human dummy in 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.620
 labs are plenty for every kind of test 

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.220
 different if hit from the back 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.310
 mannequins 

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:27.110
 pregnant women 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.180
 each test it carefully prepares 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:29.599
 conducts a preliminary test here 

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.480
 eg 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:34.700
 chest punch simulations roll each 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.190
 such a doll is worth a million crowns it's almost 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.500
 6 million rubles plus hundreds of sensors 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:44.390
 but the Swedes claims on security 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:46.220
 money it is not a pity the measurement is accurate but 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:48.680
 Here are their programs in relation to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.470
 real injuries are not so simple 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.870
 for this and there is science biomechanics 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.030
 we study injuries of dummies we model on 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.040
 computer look what injury in the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:01.269
 or a different situation could get or not 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:04.160
 get the same conditions man 

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:06.110
 since the condition is laboratory and approach 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.360
 scientific then all tests should be 

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.280
 identical therefore mannequins are always in 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.680
 same shoes american 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.170
 army boots are boiled unkillable 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.690
 volvo claims iq tests 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:20.120
 not the machines themselves are stricter and more complicated than 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.819
 common European you certainly more 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:24.970
 a variety of huge room next to 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:27.830
 survivors of a real accident 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:29.890
 demonstratively stand machines for at least 

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:32.090
 real test 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:33.859
 dispute just leggings millinken a 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.480
 imagine what will happen to the frontal 

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:37.880
 glass out of it on the big sport 

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:42.790
 here's the ears and the floor itself is cut 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.790
 remember it needs even more 

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:49.030
 But back to the 40 preparation for test 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.310
 It took all morning long will put the camera 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.860
 bye for the price of cable sensors and here 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.870
 Finally the car drives away is about to be launched 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:59.739
 special track in this case as 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.200
 huge ballista pavilion pleasant 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:03.510
 stress everyone is asked to leave the dangerous 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:05.739
 zone 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:07.900
 reminds the directorial apparatus in 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:10.150
 TV time you are director too 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:13.209
 chief engineer of the center gives directions 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.069
 exposes the light starts counting matte 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.989
 orange color the car is not painted 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:19.000
 accidentally and so that there was no glare 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.959
 the critical moment when actually and 

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.959
 blow will occur 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.030
 not that loud but impressed 

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.040
 blows from the machine bounces off 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:30.230
 right and heading towards the wall where they stand 

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:33.190
 camera on the faces of the operators frozen 

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:33.190
 horror but everything worked out 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.150
 the first seconds after the collision smell 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.100
 haze and 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.230
 developed oil 

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.790
 slightly unexpected trajectory strong 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:45.800
 hit and heavy consequences will 

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:49.190
 interesting to watch and what's inside 

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.870
 what with our hero to the car immediately 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:52.580
 hack reporters and 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:55.130
 center specialists rather 

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:57.650
 take photographs and take measurements front 

00:04:55.130 --> 00:04:59.650
 part of the orange volvo smyatku 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.970
 the wheel flew off the bumper fell off 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:04.280
 internals under the hood milled 

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:06.440
 however, it can be seen that the body itself in general 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.870
 survived helped hidden somewhere inside 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:12.410
 powerful cross tube like racing 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:14.420
 machines this could happen if 

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:16.520
 for example a car crashed into a pole or 

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:20.720
 tree or bumped into another car 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:22.880
 you can say several tests in one 

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.890
 in general, it was intended to 

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:27.230
 impact force was distributed throughout 

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:29.810
 body and redeemed through the hood fender 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.520
 to bear the fruit they can donate a 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:33.500
 cell cage directly 

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:35.690
 preserved that is the car 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:38.630
 recovery is hardly closer but we 

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:41.050
 mugen by another person you are teeth and this 

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:41.050
 the main thing
