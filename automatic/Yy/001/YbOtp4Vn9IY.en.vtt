00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.849
 hello everyone how are you 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.910
 Well, I'm going to tell you a little about what 

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.350
 happened these months because you tell me 

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.629
 that I have not appeared so much for the 

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:17.360
 channel what is that of the shootings or what 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:19.760
 what is happening in my life in these 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.890
 moments and well neither is nothing of 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.050
 another world but in which it fits is 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:26.480
 something special for me something different 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.929
 because of course my day to day is not another 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.870
 thing to be with the little boy take it 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.120
 to the daycare to do things from home 

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:37.670
 edit videos record videos ie 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.719
 all that not apart from the messages and everything 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.550
 that 

00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.739
 Well, I am going to comment a little and 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.109
 basically the subject of the shootings is 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.780
 that I have attended as a helper no 

00:00:45.109 --> 00:00:51.079
 that is, they are rolling at that moment and 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.480
 I am the typical one or what is happening 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.329
 behind or is left while they are 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:58.609
 then recording at that time then to the 

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.500
 protagonists tell you that I was in a 

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:03.640
 television ad that I have actually 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.949
 come out there is a second 

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 i 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.869
 and also tell you to leave you here 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.759
 below the link to the ad that is in 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.110
 youtube and good as I've said for 

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.530
 facebook and the truth that I'm very cool 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:19.770
 and then I've been in two movies 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.920
 not sincerely, I have gone for the 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:25.259
 experience because I wanted to be in 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:27.929
 medium of a shoot something different though 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:30.329
 good when I went to venice attended to a 

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:32.069
 filming but well it was not great either 

00:01:30.329 --> 00:01:34.740
 thing what happens that this flight a lot 

00:01:32.069 --> 00:01:36.420
 more besides I met people and all those 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.849
 things that good to me so much I love 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.310
 meet people and talk and then then 

00:01:38.849 --> 00:01:45.110
 is what I have entered through 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.110
 a friend for some shooting 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.820
 and then he also took and proposed to go to 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.740
 an end-of-course project that I had 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:57.659
 she and good was to talk about the 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.670
 bloggers and all that and then I 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:01.670
 proposed that if I could go accompany 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.000
 a little bit of what goes into this and good 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:18.940
 it gave the chair lightly as good 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.550
 Well, I took it and nothing that before 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.770
 jurors there their professors and so I 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.370
 that they had to talk a little bit in 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:26.370
 medium cut 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:33.159
 for me 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.890
 a little bit of experience has also 

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:41.450
 I also liked it. 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:44.950
 because good these things you never know 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.950
 and then I liked it 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
 i 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.790
 ah 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:07.920
 you say is going to upload tutorials 

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.530
 go with us you do not want to tell 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:12.030
 nothing because I do not feel like it very many times 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.890
 tell what happens that I do not look for the 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.990
 moment for example now it's super late 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.730
 I also can not be here shouting or 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.310
 nothing because of course there are neighbors and all 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.560
 those things and it's not the same either 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:24.750
 and we will do almost 10,000 because I 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.270
 I always try to bring you the best for you 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.430
 channel and what can come out more 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:31.980
 productive not what you ask me too 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.440
 because many times I do things 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.690
 because you least ask, for example, about the 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:38.550
 extensions for me it was super easy 

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.220
 placing the extensions you think that 

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:43.650
 for many it is something difficult something that does not 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.990
 it is understood then there are things that 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.570
 I also owe it to you to you 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.880
 and that's why I also tell you that 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:52.980
 do not keep me in mind, have a day 

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:54.750
 fixed upload videos and all that 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:56.760
 because I go according to the march 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:59.220
 I would love next year can 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:02.730
 avoid much more time to the channel 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:04.800
 dedicate everything possible 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.470
 but this year has been a little complicated 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:09.420
 It has been a bit difficult and organizing 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.069
 edit videos and all those things 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.360
 it's also a bit complicated 

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.090
 computer is a bit is not a 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.750
 wonder but that is not like sacha 

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.519
 ridiculous 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.739
 we're not going to blame those things 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.680
 just to be doing what 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:24.660
 one really likes not taking away from 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:27.000
 the means and removing from other things 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:29.729
 there is always something that we can 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.460
 say I can remove something to teach 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.199
 these people I can make this video though 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:37.110
 be otherwise I would love 

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:39.810
 do thousands of things time does not give me 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.930
 but I try to do anything that is going to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.789
 make a super long video and also that 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:48.150
 more to tell you that it was my birthday 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:50.130
 I have turned 27 years old and good for me 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:52.260
 It is a number sincerely because of course 

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:54.900
 because fulfilling years for me is a number 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:57.360
 because I feel just as young as 

00:04:54.900 --> 00:05:00.930
 I have always been always felt 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.760
 super close to young people super no 

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:05.040
 I am very girl, not 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:08.370
 but to see I'm also very sensible and I'm 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.990
 very is to say I am a very straight person 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:12.060
 in many decisions I'm pretty 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.340
 perfectionist that the other day that 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.490
 I was with my friend gm that buster mommy and 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:20.870
 I do not know what's happening, because of course 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.870
 Reminds me when I was pregnant 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:34.170
 and see her with so much belly a 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:36.510
 very impressed the heron 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.000
 nothing that these months have been quite 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:41.580
 special for me then another thing more 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.830
 about me but my hair is in chaos because 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.500
 I still do not know what to do in my hair 

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:48.480
 a Christ mounted so to speak I 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.480
 I would love to wear it again short 

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:54.270
 dyed platinum blond whatever 

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:56.490
 that I was constantly putting him 

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:58.290
 chemicals to the hair because dyeing is 

00:05:56.490 --> 00:06:00.660
 all chemical better if I to the opinion of 

00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.760
 have at the tips does not fall but in 

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:05.460
 principle, I think I'm going to let him grow 

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.040
 I do not know if my clothes on this side of the hair 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:10.410
 I do not know yet I do not know what I'll do I'm a 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.850
 moment a little if not no if there are people 

00:06:10.410 --> 00:06:14.070
 who tells me that yes there are people who tell me 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.930
 that I'm not a little indecisive and that 

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.420
 I do not know exactly if I'm going to cut it 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:20.400
 I'm not going to cut it but I've already 

00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:23.580
 talked a little bit of everything to have of my 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:26.820
 back pain because every time I'm 

00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:29.970
 improving a lot more already to see and do 

00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:32.580
 normal life and all that yes that still 

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.620
 I have a bit blocked the area 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:36.840
 lumbar the area below but some 

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:38.490
 exercises that go great I tell you 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:41.190
 I have not made an attempt to record myself in 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:42.960
 home doing pilates exercises or 

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:45.060
 and stretching but not the same 

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.340
 so I have a friend who has a 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:49.740
 gym and see if one afternoon I take me 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.500
 I'm going to record there that she already told me 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:54.360
 I was going to record there and recorded you 

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:57.480
 many videos and then I make a 

00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:59.790
 folder a section where you post videos 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.580
 of stretching and all that I think 

00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:05.190
 that is going to be very useful I do not know 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.170
 to me the truth that I risk everything 

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:08.969
 everything that can help you helps us and 

00:07:07.170 --> 00:07:11.429
 nothing more than here my video today 

00:07:08.969 --> 00:07:14.159
 I think it's made super - super long 

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:15.719
 I send you many, many kisses 

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:17.789
 thank you very much for all the support 

00:07:15.719 --> 00:07:20.939
 I hope that from here of these 10,000 that 

00:07:17.789 --> 00:07:23.519
 let's go up many more sincerely myself 

00:07:20.939 --> 00:07:25.110
 without you it would be nothing and not go up 

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:27.809

00:07:25.110 --> 00:07:30.179
