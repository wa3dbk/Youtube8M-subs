00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:04.510
 the cadre is wider that is 

00:00:01.479 --> 00:00:05.920
 succeeded in his view if you every 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:07.570
 year that happened in dortmund now 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.290
 always losing the top player 

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:11.860
 then I am there when you wall out 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.990
 go out 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.260
 one is still happy there but is 

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:19.920
 one injured last with italy 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.170
 that 's hard to replace 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.330
 good players but if you go there 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.960
 stop there is on his position 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.029
 of course the best well exercised 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.159
 The mobile is just a great thing about that 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.609
 Spiel is then also at the Oscar in Berlin 

00:00:33.159 --> 00:00:37.839
 made super its twice good 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.460
 buyer property is scorer 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:41.079
 italy did not look this 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.399
 Of course there is already one 

00:00:41.079 --> 00:00:45.069
 made some beautiful goals but a whole 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:47.530
 another game as lewandowski his time 

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:50.170
 and as for the defensive I am concerned 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.249
 believe in the injury that can 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:52.420
 you do not have much to do about it is missing 

00:00:51.249 --> 00:00:53.530
 of course, this creativity in the 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.559
 Mittelfeld only in the back of the four-string 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:57.729
 is changed regularly and I have 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:59.079
 I also talk to some of them 

00:00:57.729 --> 00:01:00.729
 Closer to that are say that too 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:02.260
 we do not understand why tower played 

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.390
 at once right advantage completely 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.920
 was overwhelmed yesterday 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.870
 such questions keep it there as well 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.310
 Two defenders sit and not 

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:12.250
 between sokratis hummels and subotic 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.450
 he quickly exchanges the good again 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.140
 works if jürgen klopp too 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:16.000
 a player times each other 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.650
 position play großkreutz is that 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.380
 paradise example uli you have to be very clear 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.520
 say dortmund now already has that 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.820
 one or the other game before there 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.140
 made on the right-back 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.430
 from that now no longer a phenomenon 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:29.230
 for me it's just the song 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.940
 international in the champions league 

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:32.170
 does it work then make it stand out 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:34.120
 in the game against arsenal also in 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:35.800
 Anderlecht knew that he was not 

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.390
 Go ahead right there they are 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.350
 and in the league they get it 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.240
 not in the square 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.190
 that's a bit weird they have 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 then 

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:44.640
 a creativity problem due to the 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.900
 injured neuss with italy and so on 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.180
 further have been raised 

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.360
 but basically I believe that you 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.480
 have the stability problem in the center 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.350
 and just this against pressing against 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:59.070
 teams that are disorganized 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:59.730
 to be successful that is not 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 is working 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.620
 you were live it really is like that 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.750
 seriously noticed that they really 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.430
 No chances have been worked out 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.990
 conclusion even with high balls that 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.160
 Will definitely be visited again 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.630
 have gaps to tear 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.790
 they are wondering, i think so many 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.250
 people just like dortmund plays into 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.680
 including coach jürgen klopp would have that 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.480
 so in the depth not expected as well 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.890
 dortmund just plays when you see him 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.000
 observed at the edge of the field you can tell 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.380
 also that he partly I do not want 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.850
 say stunned of course has 

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.530
 understanding for his players because he 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.130
 I know how many on the last line 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.400
 to run 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.990
 Whether Großkreutz gives the amount 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.720
 were struck and have to play 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.850
 someone playing in is throwing in 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.900
 so does not create them of course 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:44.700
 compared to last year they play 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.890
 without lewandowski and without regret is two 

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:48.630
 absolute world class people who can 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.190
 replace anyone and is darabos 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.350
 immobile of each one completely 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:54.330
 playing different is hard to do 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.010
 clearly it lacks almost missing in 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.380
 all areas and they make incredible 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.810
 Many individual mistakes you get immediately 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.040
 whether and not knowing and how that 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.320
 it is great to turn off 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.320
 trust in jürgen klop
