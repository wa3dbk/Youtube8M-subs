so based on these numbers the conversion

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:35.330 
so based on these numbers the conversion
rate<00:04:32.130> that<00:04:32.160> I<00:04:32.340> got<00:04:32.610> was<00:04:33.240> about<00:04:33.510> 43%<00:04:34.340> not

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:38.670 
would be $33 now if you were to compare

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.260 
would be $33 now if you were to compare

that to sell ads which is which is a lot
more<00:05:42.420> expensive<00:05:42.750> you<00:05:43.650> can<00:05:43.680> see<00:05:43.980> here<00:05:44.220> I<00:05:44.430> took<00:05:44.490> a

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:44.670 
more expensive you can see here I took a

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.030 
more expensive you can see here I took a
screenshot<00:05:44.790> of<00:05:45.240> one<00:05:46.140> of<00:05:46.230> the<00:05:46.320> offers<00:05:46.620> from

screenshot of one of the offers from

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:49.670 
screenshot of one of the offers from
Alice<00:05:47.880> donor<00:05:48.090> he's<00:05:48.450> offering<00:05:49.110> a<00:05:49.260> thousand

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:49.680 
Alice donor he's offering a thousand

00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:51.290 
Alice donor he's offering a thousand
clicks<00:05:49.890> for<00:05:50.220> three<00:05:50.670> hundred<00:05:50.790> and<00:05:51.060> forty-two

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:51.300 
clicks for three hundred and forty-two

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.350 
clicks for three hundred and forty-two
dollars<00:05:51.680> now<00:05:52.680> this<00:05:53.190> is<00:05:53.340> a<00:05:53.370> thousand<00:05:54.240> clicks

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
dollars now this is a thousand clicks

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:56.080 
dollars now this is a thousand clicks
this<00:05:54.600> doesn't<00:05:54.900> mean<00:05:54.960> a<00:05:55.170> thousand<00:05:55.590> subscribers

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:56.090 
this doesn't mean a thousand subscribers

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:58.730 
this doesn't mean a thousand subscribers
so<00:05:57.090> it<00:05:57.150> really<00:05:57.300> depends<00:05:57.750> on<00:05:57.930> how<00:05:58.290> well<00:05:58.500> your

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:58.740 
so it really depends on how well your

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:01.250 
so it really depends on how well your
opt-in<00:05:59.130> page<00:05:59.340> converts<00:05:59.820> if<00:06:00.540> your<00:06:00.750> page

00:06:01.250 --> 00:06:01.260 
opt-in page converts if your page

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:03.320 
opt-in page converts if your page
converts<00:06:01.650> at<00:06:01.830> about<00:06:02.040> 20<00:06:02.400> percent<00:06:02.790> then<00:06:03.150> you're

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
converts at about 20 percent then you're

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:05.480 
converts at about 20 percent then you're
going<00:06:03.450> to<00:06:03.540> get<00:06:03.690> about<00:06:03.900> 200<00:06:04.560> subscribers<00:06:05.190> for

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:05.490 
going to get about 200 subscribers for

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
three hundred forty two dollars that's

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.320 
three hundred forty two dollars that's
expensive<00:06:08.250> now<00:06:08.790> if<00:06:08.880> you<00:06:08.970> were<00:06:09.090> to<00:06:09.150> use

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:09.330 
expensive now if you were to use

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:11.330 
expensive now if you were to use
Facebook<00:06:09.870> ads<00:06:10.050> to<00:06:10.290> build<00:06:10.500> your<00:06:10.650> list<00:06:10.800> for

three hundred forty two dollars you

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:14.210 
three hundred forty two dollars you
could<00:06:12.810> build<00:06:13.050> a<00:06:13.230> list<00:06:13.380> of<00:06:13.590> a<00:06:13.770> thousand

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:14.220 
could build a list of a thousand

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.390 
could build a list of a thousand
subscribers<00:06:15.410> so<00:06:16.410> this<00:06:16.560> test<00:06:16.830> campaign<00:06:17.220> that<00:06:17.370> I

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:17.400 
subscribers so this test campaign that I

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.700 
subscribers so this test campaign that I
did<00:06:17.610> was<00:06:17.940> quite<00:06:18.390> successful<00:06:18.680> what<00:06:19.680> I

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:19.710 
did was quite successful what I

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.640 
did was quite successful what I
continued<00:06:20.280> yes<00:06:21.060> there<00:06:21.570> are<00:06:21.600> probably<00:06:22.500> put<00:06:22.620> on

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
continued yes there are probably put on

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:24.710 
continued yes there are probably put on
a<00:06:22.770> to<00:06:23.040> do<00:06:23.160> list<00:06:23.190> wouldn't<00:06:24.150> be<00:06:24.240> much<00:06:24.510> of<00:06:24.570> a

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:24.720 
a to do list wouldn't be much of a

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.930 
a to do list wouldn't be much of a
priority<00:06:24.960> but<00:06:25.860> what<00:06:26.130> I<00:06:26.160> could<00:06:26.370> have<00:06:26.430> done<00:06:26.490> to

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:26.940 
priority but what I could have done to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.820 
priority but what I could have done to
increase<00:06:27.330> conversions<00:06:27.840> is<00:06:28.140> to<00:06:28.500> create<00:06:28.800> more

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:28.830 
increase conversions is to create more

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:31.370 
increase conversions is to create more

variations of the ad such as changing

the image as I saw with the ad that I

00:06:33.570 --> 00:06:36.530 
the image as I saw with the ad that I
ran<00:06:33.900> this<00:06:34.500> is<00:06:34.710> just<00:06:34.920> this<00:06:35.100> red<00:06:35.430> image<00:06:35.730> with

ran this is just this red image with
text<00:06:37.230> area<00:06:37.530> I<00:06:37.620> could<00:06:37.770> change<00:06:38.040> it<00:06:38.190> around<00:06:38.280> I<00:06:38.640> get

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:39.180 
text area I could change it around I get

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.760 
text area I could change it around I get
completely<00:06:39.480> different<00:06:39.990> and<00:06:40.140> see<00:06:40.380> what<00:06:40.590> works

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:40.770 
completely different and see what works

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:41.330 
completely different and see what works
better

00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:41.340 
better

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:43.730 
better
I<00:06:41.400> could<00:06:42.090> also<00:06:42.240> try<00:06:42.750> out<00:06:42.900> different<00:06:42.930> headlines

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
I could also try out different headlines

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.580 
I could also try out different headlines
and<00:06:44.040> calls-to-action<00:06:45.080> and<00:06:46.080> lastly<00:06:46.350> I<00:06:46.410> could

00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:46.590 
and calls-to-action and lastly I could

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:48.560 
and calls-to-action and lastly I could
have<00:06:46.680> split<00:06:46.949> tested<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:47.669> opt-in<00:06:48.120> page<00:06:48.360> as

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
have split tested the opt-in page as

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.170 
have split tested the opt-in page as
well<00:06:48.720> you<00:06:49.169> can<00:06:49.290> see<00:06:49.440> that<00:06:49.650> this<00:06:49.889> simple<00:06:50.280> opt-in

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
well you can see that this simple opt-in

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.420 
well you can see that this simple opt-in
page<00:06:51.389> I<00:06:51.720> could<00:06:52.320> split<00:06:52.560> tests<00:06:52.860> a<00:06:52.979> totally

00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:53.430 
page I could split tests a totally

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:55.250 
page I could split tests a totally
different<00:06:53.820> opt-in<00:06:54.510> page<00:06:54.690> and<00:06:54.930> see<00:06:55.080> how<00:06:55.199> that

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:55.260 
different opt-in page and see how that

00:06:55.260 --> 00:06:55.730 
different opt-in page and see how that
goes

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:55.740 
goes

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:57.500 
goes
perhaps<00:06:55.979> adding<00:06:56.280> an<00:06:56.370> image<00:06:56.820> or<00:06:57.030> changing<00:06:57.449> the

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
perhaps adding an image or changing the

00:06:57.510 --> 00:07:00.260 
perhaps adding an image or changing the
headline<00:06:57.840> is<00:06:58.139> multiple<00:06:58.620> variations<00:06:59.270> so

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:00.270 
headline is multiple variations so

00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:02.210 
headline is multiple variations so
overall<00:07:00.690> I<00:07:01.080> kind<00:07:01.410> of<00:07:01.470> expected<00:07:01.860> to<00:07:02.040> get<00:07:02.160> that

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:02.220 
overall I kind of expected to get that

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:03.770 
overall I kind of expected to get that
80<00:07:02.610> percent<00:07:02.699> conversion<00:07:03.180> rate<00:07:03.360> there<00:07:03.660> who

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:03.780 
80 percent conversion rate there who

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:04.820 
80 percent conversion rate there who
would<00:07:03.900> have<00:07:03.990> been<00:07:04.110> really<00:07:04.620> great

00:07:04.820 --> 00:07:04.830 
would have been really great

00:07:04.830 --> 00:07:08.240 
would have been really great
but<00:07:05.840> 43%<00:07:06.840> I'm<00:07:06.960> not<00:07:07.110> complaining<00:07:07.650> especially

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:08.250 
but 43% I'm not complaining especially

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:09.890 
but 43% I'm not complaining especially
because<00:07:08.370> this<00:07:08.669> is<00:07:08.940> the<00:07:09.150> first<00:07:09.330> test<00:07:09.690> campaign

00:07:09.890 --> 00:07:09.900 
because this is the first test campaign

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:11.930 
because this is the first test campaign
that<00:07:10.260> I<00:07:10.290> did<00:07:10.560> so<00:07:11.160> I<00:07:11.190> hope<00:07:11.340> this<00:07:11.460> video<00:07:11.610> has<00:07:11.790> been
