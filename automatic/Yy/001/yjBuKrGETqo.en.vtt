we're<00:05:15.369> going<00:05:15.459> to<00:05:15.519> be<00:05:15.610> flow<00:05:15.909> test<00:05:16.239> in<00:05:16.449> it<00:05:16.569> for

00:05:16.799 --> 00:05:16.809 
we're going to be flow test in it for

00:05:16.809 --> 00:05:19.079 
we're going to be flow test in it for
pressure<00:05:17.079> differential<00:05:17.829> on<00:05:18.399> the<00:05:18.579> test<00:05:18.819> rig

00:05:19.079 --> 00:05:19.089 
pressure differential on the test rig

00:05:19.089 --> 00:05:21.299 
pressure differential on the test rig
and<00:05:19.239> see<00:05:19.869> exactly<00:05:19.929> what<00:05:20.439> kind<00:05:20.679> of<00:05:20.829> leads<00:05:21.219> and

00:05:21.299 --> 00:05:21.309 
and see exactly what kind of leads and

00:05:21.309 --> 00:05:23.009 
and see exactly what kind of leads and
results<00:05:21.759> we<00:05:21.879> can<00:05:21.999> get<00:05:22.119> off<00:05:22.329> this<00:05:22.360> graphics

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:23.019 
results we can get off this graphics

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:25.919 
results we can get off this graphics
card<00:05:24.029> so<00:05:25.029> let's<00:05:25.239> check<00:05:25.419> out<00:05:25.569> some<00:05:25.809> of<00:05:25.839> the
