00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.119
 spent a lot of time watching TV 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:18.380
 that's why I also spent a lot 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:19.550
 of time in front of the TV I discovered 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.779
 full of TV programs at the time 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.250
 I am a child of the dorothÃ©e club 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.900

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.510
 show I love they stopped 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:43.969

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.070
 precisely under the sun ah I love 

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:47.780

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.370
 never understood anything in the credits 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.230

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.810
 all houses of 450 square meters 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.950

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.830
 on TV reality TV took the 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.720
 on top also we are in an era 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.659
 have stopped the best TV show 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.940

 weird music best way to 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.770
 to resist the temptation is to give in to 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.860
