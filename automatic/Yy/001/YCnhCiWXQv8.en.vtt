00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
and then you can now wrap or maybe just

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.290 
and then you can now wrap or maybe just
use<00:00:40.350> some<00:00:40.590> duct<00:00:40.829> tape<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.309> cover<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.940> all

around though two boxes after that after

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.670 
around though two boxes after that after
wrapping<00:00:46.710> your<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.610> boxes<00:00:48.239> or<00:00:48.570> so<00:00:48.809> you<00:00:49.530> are

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.760 
going to cut out a piece of cardboard
that<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:53.219> about<00:00:53.670> bigger<00:00:54.090> than<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> perimeter

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
that is about bigger than the perimeter

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.860 
that is about bigger than the perimeter
of<00:00:55.920> your<00:00:56.010> box<00:00:56.940> and<00:00:58.820> then<00:00:59.820> use<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> as<00:01:00.719> a

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
of your box and then use this as a

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.349 
of your box and then use this as a
pattern<00:01:01.260> to<00:01:01.620> cut<00:01:01.859> out<00:01:01.980> three<00:01:02.340> more<00:01:02.699> so<00:01:03.059> at<00:01:03.270> the

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
pattern to cut out three more so at the

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.399 
pattern to cut out three more so at the
end<00:01:03.390> you<00:01:03.840> should<00:01:04.019> have<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.170> total<00:01:04.710> of<00:01:04.830> four<00:01:06.409> once

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
end you should have a total of four once

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.460 
end you should have a total of four once
you<00:01:07.590> have<00:01:07.799> your<00:01:08.040> four<00:01:08.490> cut<00:01:09.150> out<00:01:09.470> complete

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.679 
you have your four cut out complete
you're<00:01:11.040> going<00:01:11.280> to<00:01:11.400> take<00:01:11.580> what<00:01:11.760> a<00:01:11.790> bit<00:01:12.030> place<00:01:12.479> it

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
you're going to take what a bit place it

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.289 
you're going to take what a bit place it
on<00:01:12.810> a<00:01:12.869> bigger<00:01:13.170> piece<00:01:13.530> of<00:01:13.710> cardboard<00:01:14.150> place<00:01:15.150> it

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
on a bigger piece of cardboard place it

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:18.380 
on a bigger piece of cardboard place it
in<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.420> middle<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.840> then<00:01:16.640> trace<00:01:17.640> it<00:01:17.880> once

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
in the middle and then trace it once

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.770 
in the middle and then trace it once
more<00:01:18.720> and<00:01:19.939> then<00:01:20.939> you're<00:01:21.119> going<00:01:21.240> to<00:01:21.299> cut<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> out

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
more and then you're going to cut it out

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.010 
more and then you're going to cut it out
but<00:01:22.409> start<00:01:23.189> from<00:01:23.460> this<00:01:23.670> corner<00:01:24.060> and<00:01:24.390> do<00:01:24.780> not

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
but start from this corner and do not

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.390 
but start from this corner and do not
cut<00:01:25.320> out<00:01:25.350> anything<00:01:26.009> else<00:01:26.220> and<00:01:28.250> then<00:01:29.250> you

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
cut out anything else and then you

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.100 
cut out anything else and then you
should<00:01:29.579> have<00:01:29.610> this<00:01:29.939> kind<00:01:30.119> of<00:01:30.270> frame<00:01:30.659> thing<00:01:30.960> at

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
should have this kind of frame thing at

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.969 
should have this kind of frame thing at
the<00:01:31.229> end<00:01:31.259> and<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:33.299> are<00:01:33.479> going<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.079> take

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
the end and now you are going to take

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.160 
the end and now you are going to take
that<00:01:35.159> piece<00:01:35.520> you<00:01:35.549> cut<00:01:35.909> out<00:01:35.939> and<00:01:36.329> trace<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:37.020> on<00:01:37.140> a

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
that piece you cut out and trace it on a

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.899 
that piece you cut out and trace it on a
piece<00:01:37.619> of<00:01:37.650> white<00:01:38.610> paper<00:01:40.430> after<00:01:41.430> cutting<00:01:41.670> out

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
piece of white paper after cutting out

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.749 
piece of white paper after cutting out
that<00:01:42.150> white<00:01:42.329> paper<00:01:42.630> we<00:01:42.990> traced<00:01:43.290> out<00:01:43.560> I'm<00:01:44.399> going

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
that white paper we traced out I'm going

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.910 
that white paper we traced out I'm going
to<00:01:44.880> use<00:01:45.090> my<00:01:45.119> blue<00:01:45.570> and<00:01:45.780> red<00:01:45.960> workers<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.890> join

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
to use my blue and red workers to join

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.550 
to use my blue and red workers to join
the<00:01:47.310> design<00:01:47.729> of<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.030> air<00:01:48.450> hockey<00:01:48.689> table<00:01:49.259> you

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
the design of the air hockey table you

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.300 
the design of the air hockey table you
can<00:01:49.680> probably<00:01:49.860> get<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.399> pictures<00:01:51.210> off<00:01:51.240> line

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
can probably get the pictures off line

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.859 
can probably get the pictures off line
so<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.610> is<00:01:53.790> probably<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.210> design<00:01:54.689> you

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
so this is probably the design you

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.600 
so this is probably the design you
should<00:01:55.049> have<00:01:55.259> for<00:01:55.500> your<00:01:55.649> table<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.430> can

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
should have for your table you can

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.510 
should have for your table you can
either<00:01:56.759> pause<00:01:57.090> this<00:01:57.390> or<00:01:57.659> you<00:01:57.780> can<00:01:57.990> just<00:01:58.520> you

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
either pause this or you can just you

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.800 
either pause this or you can just you
know<00:01:59.700> get<00:02:00.149> offline<00:02:01.610> now<00:02:02.610> we<00:02:02.670> are<00:02:02.969> going<00:02:03.090> to<00:02:03.509> put

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
know get offline now we are going to put

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:07.490 
know get offline now we are going to put
this<00:02:03.960> aside<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.590> now<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:05.600> am<00:02:06.600> taking<00:02:07.170> three<00:02:07.409> of

cardboard pieces together and I just
tape<00:02:24.110> the<00:02:24.470> ends<00:02:24.680> so<00:02:24.980> they'll<00:02:25.340> be<00:02:25.520> secured<00:02:25.940> and

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
tape the ends so they'll be secured and

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.690
