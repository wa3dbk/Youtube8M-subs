00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:03.300
 in fact from the years to the maratea film 

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.160
 festival 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.109
 among the guests such presences that is the 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.559
 welcome that creativity and Easter 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.290
 of nuzzo hello easter hear come back 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.470
 to a life we can say normal later 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:17.990
 the experience of friends that has been a lot 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.840
 rewarding for you is easy 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.539
 absolutely no oh well no doubt they are 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.359
 changed a lot of things but it was a lot 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.769
 nice because anyway like all of them 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:30.539
 experiences end and therefore how 

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.740
 all experiences back to life 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.920
 normal 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:36.420
 so take jobs, in short 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.590
 several things for which still a nice one 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.470
 what sooner or later things end 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:42.690
 so why take reality so 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.640
 absolutely but what does it have to do with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.739
 maratea film festival because if here 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.000
 together with the dance since childhood he has 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.739
 always had the ambition of cinema 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.510
 so I'm very happy to be 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.850
 present here at the seaside of the film festival 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.910
 I also listened to the presentation of 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.370
 manuel de sica books and where he used to say 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.839
 just a sentence that struck me 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.640
 was that the cinema is not only 

00:01:00.839 --> 00:01:04.559
 intelligence and indeed all its 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.320
 intelligence but above all distinct from 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.000
 when it hit me it is still a lot of le 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.320
 ambitions need in addition to the dance there is 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.960
 always been the cinema to be 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.000
 This here and I'm very happy in 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.670
 instinctive level since we talk about 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.230
 this what movie or what kind of fake 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.330
 would like to interpret watch 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.980
 the films are different , especially the ones 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.830
 fiction more than anything else one of the 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:28.610
 prefer team antimafia 

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.620
 also present one of the minds there 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.930
 favorite than giulia michelini e 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.300
 so I'd like to maybe someday 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.400
 I would like to shoot anti-mafia, however, I am 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.820
 the different kinds of films I have 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.520
 like 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.040
 this summer for three is not just about relaxation 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.100
 I imagine you are around no 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.900
 fortunately or I'm present like 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.190
 guest in several events and some for 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.710
 all Italy so we will touch a little 

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:54.200
 all regions of italy and therefore a lot 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.180
 very very working I am happy 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.670
 surely maybe there will be a bathroom less 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.050
 bad, however, absolutely this summer the 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.420
 because being silent at work comes immediately to me 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.480
 in mind so thinking about dance and to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:09.440
 your aspirations as an actor in a musical 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:11.900
 you would like to look yes and no in the sense 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.670
 that I like the show much more and 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.410
 especially the cinema that the musical 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.160
 months with a nice environment though 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:22.190
 I prefer the cinema that did well 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.930
 as how you imagine yourself rare indeed 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.110
 and how it seemed spontaneous but not 

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:30.740
 interested you are rightly everyone lives 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.150
 how do you think about how you feel but above all 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:33.830
 you as you imagine yourself in a neighbor 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:35.860
 future it is clear that we do not have the sphere 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:39.410
 crystal but how would you like it 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.150
 imagine you look, I surely imagine 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.129
 this was studying dance and 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.810
 may succeed in accomplishing this 

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:47.000
 my second dream in quotation marks that is 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.340
 cinema and therefore you will see me 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.040
 once again that black box though 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.680
 how to vote maybe a movie 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:56.709
 certainly thanks to Easter thanks to 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.709
 you
