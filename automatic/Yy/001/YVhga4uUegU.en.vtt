00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 the people we have to know how to value 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.759
 our body the way it is very 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.040
 cool has some tricks up his sleeve for 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.750
 know how to draw attention to detail and 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.940
 perhaps slightly change the appearance of 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:13.440
 something that we're not in this superfan 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.420
 video I'll show just how 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.460
 to make it look slimmer and have 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.189
 more curves is a case that ended 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.020
 identifying a lot because I'm from 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.189
 Mignon type if you were also I guess 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:34.320
 You'll really like your 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:36.840
 visuals appear higher the first 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.960
 tip is super manjada and everyone knows 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.969
 that she was about to appear a leap 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.489
 High is the simplest way you have 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:46.350
 one centimeter sceptres if you choose to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.690
 one that is a tone closer to your 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.600
 skin is the best because the long their 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.489
 legs and if it's a booty like this 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:57.059
 also be careful that he does not cut himself 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.730
 well in the ankle increasing this achievement 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.469
 look for the minimum lengths in case 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.539
 Obviously it gets better if you have 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.369
 already nice legs to show 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.549
 otherwise you can put on a pantyhose 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.950
 together a jump and certain but a destination 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 mini length always values ​​more 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.090
 make sure you do not lose your 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.670
 waist to help create curves is the 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.680
 vital you mark here and if it is 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.610
 turning dinho helps to look like you have 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.610
 a little more hip 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.360
 another tip is if you want long 

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.450
 enough its silhouette who invest in the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.710
 monochrome visual or just one color 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.869
 in case we are not talking about 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.360
 play with more tones keep a color 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:43.360
 concise in the visual from head to toe 

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.729
 so here I have a skirt that has 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:47.319
 several ruffles investing a baba 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.759
 of a good Sao Paulo if you 

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:49.420
 want to give the illusion of a little bit more 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:51.640
 hip 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.740
 make sure it is well marked 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.299
 in the waist and again we do not want 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.360
 lose that silhouette 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.920
 I have no visual interest in a game in 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.780
 it's cool you play with 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.679
 textures and woven and non e.g. 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.929
 skirt 

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:08.079
 we have a bit of tule big boss one 

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:11.769
 jersey and I can combine it with a blouse 

00:02:08.079 --> 00:02:14.170
 basic knit that instead a belt 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:16.120
 to put a black satin ribbon on the 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.000
 my waistline adds a touch more 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.670
 sophisticated and the contrast of the 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.010
 brightness of the different textures 

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:27.810
 creating much more interest and was only 

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:27.810
 much more interesting obviously 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.920
 You can also lengthen your silhouette. 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.650
 with tones on tones sainz exactly the 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 Same color will not leave you so high 

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:43.790
 but it's really cool, including the house 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.800
 playing the curves even more then 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.990
 you may have something like a pair of a 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.170
 tom I do here pink I love pink 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:54.020
 and a blouse has not appeared they are 

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:56.630
 married but does not equal the legacy that 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.670
 blouse is also that she has frills in the 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.430
 region of the bust that increases a little bit 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.440
 here's the western condom a little more 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.600
 volume and here below also that 

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:07.130
 values ​​my hip again 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.960
 I have a comic strip to mark my 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.720
 because we want to create that 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.500
 visual 8 villain any way you want 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.500
 call again 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.850
 if you like video that shows a 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.340
 a little more about each body type 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:27.140
 What is the best dress for your 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.130

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:30.830
 here on the channel
