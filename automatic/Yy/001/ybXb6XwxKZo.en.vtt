00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:32.260 
advertise that I do them but

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.590 
advertise that I do them but
occasionally<00:05:33.250> the<00:05:33.820> right<00:05:34.000> person<00:05:34.450> comes

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:34.600 
occasionally the right person comes

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:37.860 
occasionally the right person comes
along<00:05:34.780> and<00:05:36.060> they've<00:05:37.060> approached<00:05:37.390> me<00:05:37.570> in<00:05:37.600> a<00:05:37.690> way

00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:37.870 
along and they've approached me in a way

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:40.950 
along and they've approached me in a way
that<00:05:38.100> it<00:05:39.100> makes<00:05:39.370> me<00:05:39.550> want<00:05:39.760> to<00:05:39.790> help<00:05:39.940> and<00:05:40.270> this

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
that it makes me want to help and this

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:42.930 
that it makes me want to help and this
is<00:05:41.110> one<00:05:41.260> of<00:05:41.290> those<00:05:41.440> cases<00:05:41.700> so<00:05:42.700> over<00:05:42.820> the<00:05:42.910> next

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:42.940 
is one of those cases so over the next

00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:44.790 
is one of those cases so over the next
couple<00:05:43.240> of<00:05:43.360> weeks<00:05:43.570> I'm<00:05:44.260> going<00:05:44.620> to<00:05:44.680> be

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:44.800 
couple of weeks I'm going to be

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:46.980

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
to try to transform him from below

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.730 
to try to transform him from below
average<00:05:52.360> player<00:05:52.870> to<00:05:53.230> an<00:05:53.350> above<00:05:53.590> average
