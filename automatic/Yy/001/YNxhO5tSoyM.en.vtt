Oh<00:00:04.669> in<00:00:05.669> this<00:00:05.819> tutorial<00:00:05.970> we're<00:00:06.509> going<00:00:06.599> to<00:00:06.660> learn

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
Oh in this tutorial we're going to learn

Oh in this tutorial we're going to learn
how<00:00:06.839> to<00:00:06.990> do<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.290> half<00:00:07.470> around<00:00:07.680> the<00:00:07.889> world<00:00:08.069> this

00:00:08.509 --> 00:00:08.519 
how to do the half around the world this

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:17.990 
how to do the half around the world this
is<00:00:08.670> what<00:00:08.820> it<00:00:08.910> looks<00:00:09.030> like<00:00:16.640> the<00:00:17.640> first<00:00:17.820> thing

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
is what it looks like the first thing

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.159 
is what it looks like the first thing
you<00:00:18.090> need<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.270> understand<00:00:18.720> is<00:00:18.930> that<00:00:18.990> we're

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:19.169 
you need to understand is that we're

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:20.749 
you need to understand is that we're
going<00:00:19.259> to<00:00:19.349> be<00:00:19.410> doing<00:00:19.619> the<00:00:19.680> outside<00:00:20.099> motion<00:00:20.520> and

00:00:20.749 --> 00:00:20.759 
going to be doing the outside motion and

00:00:20.759 --> 00:00:22.100 
going to be doing the outside motion and
not<00:00:20.910> an<00:00:21.000> inside<00:00:21.329> walk<00:00:21.509> that<00:00:21.720> means<00:00:21.899> that<00:00:22.020> the

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:22.110 
not an inside walk that means that the

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.200 
not an inside walk that means that the
trick<00:00:22.320> should<00:00:22.439> look<00:00:22.590> like<00:00:22.619> this<00:00:22.980> and<00:00:23.430> not<00:00:24.149> like

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
trick should look like this and not like

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.269 
trick should look like this and not like
this<00:00:24.390> you<00:00:24.989> can't<00:00:25.200> do<00:00:25.290> it<00:00:25.410> inside<00:00:25.770> half<00:00:26.009> around

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
this you can't do it inside half around

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.979 
this you can't do it inside half around
the<00:00:26.369> wall<00:00:26.489> although<00:00:27.059> it's<00:00:27.180> not<00:00:27.329> so<00:00:27.480> popular<00:00:27.840> I

00:00:27.979 --> 00:00:27.989 
the wall although it's not so popular I

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:29.299 
the wall although it's not so popular I
wouldn't<00:00:28.439> recommend<00:00:28.649> it<00:00:28.890> if<00:00:28.980> you're<00:00:29.070> just

00:00:29.299 --> 00:00:29.309 
wouldn't recommend it if you're just

wouldn't recommend it if you're just
starting<00:00:29.489> out<00:00:29.700> so<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.090> don't<00:00:30.210> have<00:00:30.390> to<00:00:30.480> be

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
starting out so you don't have to be

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.880 
starting out so you don't have to be
able<00:00:30.630> to<00:00:30.809> do<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.079> outside<00:00:31.200> around<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.680> walls

able to do the outside around the walls
to<00:00:31.980> be<00:00:32.040> able<00:00:32.189> to<00:00:32.279> learn<00:00:32.460> this<00:00:32.669> trick<00:00:32.910> I<00:00:33.149> would

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
to be able to learn this trick I would

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.180 
to be able to learn this trick I would
recommend<00:00:34.020> it<00:00:34.200> so<00:00:34.559> it's<00:00:34.680> worth<00:00:34.829> checking<00:00:35.070> out

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
recommend it so it's worth checking out

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.620 
recommend it so it's worth checking out

tips on how to an outside motion
anything<00:00:39.570> ok<00:00:40.110> so<00:00:40.170> as<00:00:40.410> the<00:00:40.560> name<00:00:40.740> suggests<00:00:40.950> it's

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
anything ok so as the name suggests it's

anything ok so as the name suggests it's
a<00:00:41.700> half<00:00:41.910> around<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> world<00:00:42.480> so<00:00:42.690> all<00:00:42.720> we<00:00:42.900> have

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
a half around the world so all we have

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:45.380 
a half around the world so all we have
to<00:00:43.079> do<00:00:43.200> is<00:00:43.320> do<00:00:43.500> half<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:44.130> the<00:00:44.310> trick<00:00:44.579> so<00:00:44.820> when<00:00:45.300> we

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
to do is do half of the trick so when we

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.060 
to do is do half of the trick so when we
do<00:00:45.540> a<00:00:45.570> normal<00:00:45.810> around<00:00:46.230> the<00:00:46.320> wall<00:00:46.440> we'd<00:00:46.920> go

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
do a normal around the wall we'd go

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.680 
do a normal around the wall we'd go
around<00:00:47.190> and<00:00:47.430> kick<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.730> back<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:48.000> again<00:00:48.120> with

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
around and kick it back up again with

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.090 
around and kick it back up again with
the<00:00:48.780> half<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.140> the<00:00:49.320> world<00:00:49.500> we're<00:00:49.950> going<00:00:50.040> to

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
the half around the world we're going to

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.830 
the half around the world we're going to
go<00:00:50.250> around<00:00:50.340> then<00:00:50.970> we'll<00:00:51.120> leave<00:00:51.329> it<00:00:51.510> for<00:00:51.660> our

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:51.840 
go around then we'll leave it for our

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.930 
go around then we'll leave it for our
other<00:00:51.960> foot<00:00:52.290> to<00:00:52.680> continue<00:00:53.040> job<00:00:53.280> so<00:00:53.640> once<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
other foot to continue job so once you

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.670 
other foot to continue job so once you
get<00:00:54.090> to<00:00:54.210> about<00:00:54.360> halfway<00:00:54.660> around<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.170> ball<00:00:55.410> or

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
get to about halfway around the ball or

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
get to about halfway around the ball or
about<00:00:55.890> 3/4<00:00:56.489> way<00:00:56.640> around<00:00:56.880> the<00:00:56.940> ball<00:00:57.149> you<00:00:57.750> want

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
about 3/4 way around the ball you want

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.080 
about 3/4 way around the ball you want
to<00:00:57.989> move<00:00:58.110> your<00:00:58.290> leg<00:00:58.470> away<00:00:58.649> and<00:00:59.340> leave<00:00:59.579> the<00:00:59.910> rest

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
to move your leg away and leave the rest

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:01.670 
to move your leg away and leave the rest
of<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.270> trip<00:01:00.480> up<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.930> your<00:01:01.050> other<00:01:01.200> leg<00:01:01.410> just

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
of the trip up to your other leg just

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.410 
of the trip up to your other leg just
hit<00:01:01.860> the<00:01:01.950> ball<00:01:02.100> back<00:01:02.250> up<00:01:02.460> again<00:01:02.700> if<00:01:02.970> you<00:01:03.239> can

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
hit the ball back up again if you can

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.939 
hit the ball back up again if you can
already<00:01:03.660> do<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:03.989> a<00:01:04.049> rumble<00:01:04.350> off<00:01:04.470> you'll<00:01:04.920> be

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
already do in a rumble off you'll be

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.710 
already do in a rumble off you'll be
inclined<00:01:05.399> to<00:01:05.460> go<00:01:05.640> around<00:01:05.909> and<00:01:06.210> do<00:01:06.360> a<00:01:06.390> complete

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
inclined to go around and do a complete

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.050 
inclined to go around and do a complete
revolution<00:01:07.110> good<00:01:07.920> way<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.100> practice<00:01:08.609> this<00:01:08.789> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
revolution good way to practice this is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.059 
revolution good way to practice this is
like<00:01:09.569> during<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:09.899> half<00:01:10.079> run<00:01:10.289> world<00:01:10.530> which<00:01:10.950> is

00:01:11.059 --> 00:01:11.069 
like during the half run world which is

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:12.620 
like during the half run world which is
letting<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.399> bounce<00:01:11.609> and<00:01:11.969> then<00:01:12.179> kick<00:01:12.389> it<00:01:12.420> up

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
letting it bounce and then kick it up

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.840 
letting it bounce and then kick it up
we've<00:01:13.139> got<00:01:13.289> the<00:01:13.409> third<00:01:13.649> so<00:01:14.100> a<00:01:14.130> good<00:01:14.369> tip<00:01:14.609> is<00:01:14.639> to

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
we've got the third so a good tip is to

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.819 
we've got the third so a good tip is to
put<00:01:14.969> some<00:01:15.270> spin<00:01:15.479> on<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:15.719> ball<00:01:15.899> and<00:01:16.409> guide<00:01:16.679> the

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:16.829 
put some spin on the ball and guide the

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:18.679 
put some spin on the ball and guide the
ball<00:01:16.979> slightly<00:01:17.369> to<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.789> other<00:01:17.939> side<00:01:18.210> so<00:01:18.600> it

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
ball slightly to the other side so it

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.719 
ball slightly to the other side so it
will<00:01:18.810> land<00:01:19.020> closest<00:01:19.560> here<00:01:19.709> on<00:01:19.859> the<00:01:19.920> 3rd<00:01:20.159> this

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
will land closest here on the 3rd this

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:21.980 
will land closest here on the 3rd this
will<00:01:20.909> help<00:01:21.090> your<00:01:21.209> foot<00:01:21.479> that's<00:01:21.600> doing<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
will help your foot that's doing the

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.510 
will help your foot that's doing the
around<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.289> wall<00:01:22.409> motion<00:01:22.649> to<00:01:23.069> move<00:01:23.249> out<00:01:23.429> of

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
around the wall motion to move out of

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.069 
around the wall motion to move out of
the<00:01:23.579> way<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.179> it<00:01:24.299> also<00:01:24.450> let<00:01:24.780> you<00:01:24.869> have<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.069 --> 00:01:25.079 
the way and it also let you have the
