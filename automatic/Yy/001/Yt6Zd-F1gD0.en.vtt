Namaskar
Welcome to nishamadhulika.com

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:09.718
Chole Bhature is liked by all

00:00:10.483 --> 00:00:15.570
and if the Bhatura is stuffed with Paneer then one likes it even more.

00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:19.601
Today we will prepare Paneer Stuffed Bhatura.

00:00:24.616 --> 00:00:26.465
Ingredients required :

00:00:27.462 --> 00:00:29.017
Flour(maida) - 2 cups

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:31.765
Suji (semolina) - 1/4 cup

00:00:32.261 --> 00:00:34.213
Curd - 1/4 cup

00:00:34.747 --> 00:00:38.263
Baking soda - a little more than 1/4 tsp

00:00:38.736 --> 00:00:40.831
Sugar - 1 tsp

00:00:41.198 --> 00:00:43.817
Salt - 3/4 tsp

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:46.837
Green chilly - 1 (finely chopped)

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:50.935
Ginger - 1/2 " long piece (grated)

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:52.971
Paneer - 100 grams

00:00:53.505 --> 00:00:57.418
Green coriander - 2 tbsp (finely chopped)

00:00:57.882 --> 00:00:59.509
Oil - to fry Bhatura

00:01:00.481 --> 00:01:05.941
First we will knead the flour to prepare Paneer Stuffed Bhature.

00:01:06.346 --> 00:01:14.390
Add Suji to flour then make a little crater in the center.

00:01:18.548 --> 00:01:29.064
Put curd, baking soda, sugar

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:46.559
1/2 tsp salt (save some to use for Paneer stuffing)and 3 tsp oil in this crater.

00:01:49.701 --> 00:01:58.579
Mix all the ingredients thoroughly knead a soft dough gradually using warm water.

00:02:04.192 --> 00:02:13.341
Keep pressing the dough that you have prepared for 4-5 minutes till it turns smooth.

00:02:13.647 --> 00:02:23.591
The dough becomes so smooth that it does not even stick to your fingers.

00:02:23.944 --> 00:02:31.844
We have prepared soft dough and used 1/2 cup water for doing so.

00:02:32.626 --> 00:02:37.888
Cover the dough and keep aside for 10-12 hours, only then we will make Bhature from it.

00:02:38.999 --> 00:02:44.647
. During summers the dough can be covered and left aside for 4-5 hours.

00:02:44.838 --> 00:02:49.679
But during winters if we are preparing the Bhature in the morning

00:02:50.547 --> 00:02:56.807
then the dough needs to be prepared the previous night and kept in a warm place to ferment.

00:03:04.348 --> 00:03:07.906
Here we will use the dough prepared and fremented before hand to make Bhature.

00:03:11.641 --> 00:03:18.469
Dough has fermented properly and we need to punch it a little.

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:26.844
Heat oil and let us make the Paneer filling.

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:32.014
Grate paneer or break it into small pieces with your hands.

00:03:35.627 --> 00:03:44.697
Add coriander leaves, salt, green chilly and ginger to it.

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:51.179
Mix all these ingredients thoroughly, Paneer filling is ready.

00:03:51.866 --> 00:04:00.976
To make Bhature break off lemon (small) sized pieces from the dough.

00:04:07.955 --> 00:04:10.987
Apply some dry flour with your hands.

00:04:20.047 --> 00:04:25.975
Now that the dough pieces are ready we will stuff them with the Paneer stuffing.

00:04:32.425 --> 00:04:36.012
Expand the dough piece with your hands

00:04:42.959 --> 00:04:48.142
then place 1-1 1/2 spoon of Paneer stuffing on it.

00:04:50.944 --> 00:04:54.643
Wrap up the pieces from all sides and close it.

00:05:02.966 --> 00:05:10.557
Similarly stuff all the dough pieces with the Paneer stuffing.

00:05:14.144 --> 00:05:19.565
Now that all the pieces are stuffed we will roll then fry them.

00:05:21.143 --> 00:05:32.668
Take some dry flour and coat the stuffed
piece with it, dust excess flour.

00:05:34.307 --> 00:05:41.787
Gently press with your fingers to spread out the filling evenly.

00:05:46.114 --> 00:05:48.781
Gently roll

00:05:52.494 --> 00:05:56.439
we are rolling Bhature in an oval shape

00:05:58.195 --> 00:05:59.631
Oil is heated

00:05:59.792 --> 00:06:03.094
we can check by seeing if there is any smoke coming out of the oil.

00:06:03.383 --> 00:06:06.518
We need sufficiently heated oil to fry Bhaturas.

00:06:06.727 --> 00:06:11.420
We can also put a small piece of dough in oil to check if it is hot.

00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:18.237
if the piece floats on the surface it means the oil is sufficiently hot else it sinks to the bottom.

00:06:18.557 --> 00:06:20.859
Put Bhatura in hot oil

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.701
press with a ladle to make Bhatura puffy.

00:06:33.661 --> 00:06:37.796
Turn Bhatura over as it is fried on the lower side.

00:06:41.002 --> 00:06:45.931
Fry Bhatura till it turns light brown on both sides then take it out.

00:06:51.552 --> 00:06:55.100
These Stuffed Bhaturas need to be kept a bit thick.

00:07:04.756 --> 00:07:07.581
We have made these Bhature using Paneer filling

00:07:07.832 --> 00:07:14.623
we can also use potato filling to make Aloo Stuffed Bhature in the same manner.

00:07:15.371 --> 00:07:22.184
Panner Stuffed Bhature are ready.

00:07:22.753 --> 00:07:34.356
It is very easy to prepare this recipe, just remember a few things :

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:41.155
After rolling Bhature oil should be sufficiently heated only then Bhature should be fried.

00:07:41.358 --> 00:07:47.814
Serve Paneer Stuffed Bhature with Chole, Chutney and Pickle.

00:07:48.238 --> 00:07:54.151
