he's<00:01:52.259> coming<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.860> think<00:01:53.310> it's<00:01:53.490> part<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:53.880> parcel

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
he's coming I think it's part and parcel

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:56.060 
he's coming I think it's part and parcel
of<00:01:54.329> what<00:01:54.390> where<00:01:55.200> he's<00:01:55.290> come<00:01:55.500> from<00:01:55.530> but<00:01:55.860> he<00:01:55.920> know

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
of what where he's come from but he know

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.709 
of what where he's come from but he know
he<00:01:56.340> knows<00:01:56.549> what<00:01:56.820> he<00:01:56.880> wants<00:01:57.000> out<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.360> this<00:01:57.540> he

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
he knows what he wants out of this he

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.660 
he knows what he wants out of this he
knows<00:01:57.840> what<00:01:58.049> he<00:01:58.110> thinks<00:01:58.170> is<00:01:58.500> right<00:01:58.530> and<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
knows what he thinks is right and that

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.510 
knows what he thinks is right and that
doesn't<00:01:59.939> go<00:02:00.060> away<00:02:00.090> and<00:02:00.829> he's<00:02:01.829> not<00:02:01.979> afraid<00:02:02.070> to

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
doesn't go away and he's not afraid to

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.510 
doesn't go away and he's not afraid to
speak<00:02:03.119> his<00:02:03.270> mind<00:02:03.329> and<00:02:03.869> I<00:02:04.710> think<00:02:04.890> perhaps<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
speak his mind and I think perhaps you

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:06.800 
speak his mind and I think perhaps you
know<00:02:05.759> at<00:02:05.880> times<00:02:05.909> that<00:02:06.299> could<00:02:06.450> get<00:02:06.600> him<00:02:06.689> into

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
know at times that could get him into

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
know at times that could get him into
trouble

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
trouble

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:10.130 
trouble
can<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> quite<00:02:08.040> cocky<00:02:08.640> in<00:02:09.390> some<00:02:09.780> people's<00:02:10.050> eyes

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
can be quite cocky in some people's eyes

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:12.830 
can be quite cocky in some people's eyes
but<00:02:10.440> I<00:02:10.500> don't<00:02:10.800> think<00:02:10.950> it's<00:02:11.160> ever<00:02:11.420> misjudged<00:02:12.420> or

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:12.840 
but I don't think it's ever misjudged or

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.970 
but I don't think it's ever misjudged or
ill-informed

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
ill-informed

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.270 
ill-informed
I<00:02:14.160> think<00:02:14.730> he<00:02:15.530> speaks<00:02:16.530> his<00:02:16.620> mind<00:02:16.680> when<00:02:17.010> he<00:02:17.100> knows

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:17.280 
I think he speaks his mind when he knows

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.950 
I think he speaks his mind when he knows
that<00:02:17.550> he's<00:02:17.880> right<00:02:18.120> he's<00:02:18.420> not<00:02:18.570> someone<00:02:18.840> who

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:18.960 
that he's right he's not someone who

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.710 
that he's right he's not someone who
just<00:02:18.990> goes<00:02:19.290> up<00:02:19.500> you<00:02:19.920> know<00:02:20.360> he<00:02:21.360> follows

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:21.720 
just goes up you know he follows

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.330 
just goes up you know he follows
instincts<00:02:22.230> but<00:02:22.410> some<00:02:22.710> people<00:02:22.950> can<00:02:23.070> be<00:02:23.160> quite

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
instincts but some people can be quite

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:24.620 
instincts but some people can be quite
hot<00:02:23.550> headed<00:02:23.760> and<00:02:23.940> same<00:02:24.210> things<00:02:24.390> they<00:02:24.510> don't

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:24.630 
hot headed and same things they don't

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.760 
hot headed and same things they don't
really<00:02:24.750> mean<00:02:25.050> where<00:02:25.350> he's<00:02:25.440> not<00:02:25.560> like<00:02:25.740> that

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
really mean where he's not like that

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
listen to his instincts and really think

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.480 
listen to his instincts and really think
about<00:02:27.840> his<00:02:28.110> argument<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.650> and<00:02:29.190> if<00:02:29.370> it's

about his argument and and if it's
correct<00:02:29.820> and<00:02:30.180> if<00:02:30.720> he's<00:02:30.840> gone<00:02:31.020> through<00:02:31.260> every

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
correct and if he's gone through every

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.650 
correct and if he's gone through every
pathway<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.220> realized<00:02:32.520> these<00:02:32.700> he's<00:02:33.390> right

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
pathway and realized these he's right

pathway and realized these he's right
he'll<00:02:33.930> he'll<00:02:34.230> speak<00:02:34.530> his<00:02:34.710> mind<00:02:34.740> there<00:02:35.070> doesn't

he'll he'll speak his mind there doesn't

certain

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
certain

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.880 
certain
is<00:02:53.520> temperament<00:02:54.240> I<00:02:54.510> guess<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.440> quite<00:02:55.650> similar

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
is temperament I guess is quite similar

to mine and that was the thing that I

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.110 
to mine and that was the thing that I
could<00:02:58.110> really<00:02:58.320> connect<00:02:58.980> to<00:02:59.130> you<00:02:59.400> know<00:02:59.520> like

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:33.770 
at the end of the day and you need to

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.770 
at the end of the day and you need to
take<00:04:33.919> an<00:04:34.039> audience<00:04:34.310> on<00:04:34.460> it<00:04:34.610> on<00:04:35.180> a<00:04:35.240> journey<00:04:35.539> and

take an audience on it on a journey and

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:37.540 
take an audience on it on a journey and
sometimes<00:04:36.139> you<00:04:36.560> know<00:04:36.650> real<00:04:36.949> life<00:04:37.099> can<00:04:37.400> be

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:37.550 
sometimes you know real life can be

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.550 
sometimes you know real life can be
mundane<00:04:37.909> and<00:04:38.210> all<00:04:38.330> those<00:04:38.990> elements<00:04:39.139> of<00:04:39.439> that

mundane and all those elements of that

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.869 
mundane and all those elements of that
