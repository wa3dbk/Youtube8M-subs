come just under just with fees probably

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:54.100 
come just under just with fees probably
just<00:03:50.870> slightly<00:03:51.140> over<00:03:51.620> a<00:03:52.630> renovation<00:03:53.630> cost<00:03:53.930> of

just slightly over a renovation cost of
10,000<00:03:54.890> on<00:03:55.010> top<00:03:55.160> of<00:03:55.280> that<00:03:55.400> purchase<00:03:55.850> price<00:03:56.090> of

00:05:04.989 --> 00:05:04.999 
investor and on that basis I would say

00:05:04.999 --> 00:05:07.839 
investor and on that basis I would say
he's<00:05:05.389> value<00:05:05.719> is<00:05:05.839> about<00:05:05.990> 52,000<00:05:06.919> pounds<00:05:07.249> in<00:05:07.789> my

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:07.849 
he's value is about 52,000 pounds in my

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.790 
he's value is about 52,000 pounds in my
opinion<00:05:08.569> I<00:05:08.809> feel<00:05:08.870> the<00:05:09.379> value<00:05:09.620> of<00:05:09.710> this

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:09.800 
opinion I feel the value of this

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.739 
opinion I feel the value of this
property<00:05:10.069> would<00:05:10.339> be<00:05:10.460> fifty<00:05:10.909> thousand<00:05:11.240> pounds

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:11.749 
property would be fifty thousand pounds

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.339 
property would be fifty thousand pounds
I<00:05:12.249> think<00:05:13.249> value<00:05:13.699> was<00:05:13.930> especially<00:05:14.930> in<00:05:15.229> the

00:05:15.339 --> 00:05:15.349 
I think value was especially in the

00:05:15.349 --> 00:05:18.730 
I think value was especially in the
current<00:05:15.650> climate<00:05:16.960> possibly<00:05:17.960> down<00:05:18.139> valuing

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
current climate possibly down valuing

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.379 
current climate possibly down valuing
just<00:05:19.069> to<00:05:19.219> cover<00:05:19.430> the<00:05:19.520> on<00:05:19.729> backs<00:05:20.029> in<00:05:20.270> all

00:05:20.379 --> 00:05:20.389 
just to cover the on backs in all

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:23.679 
just to cover the on backs in all
honesty<00:05:20.900> I'd<00:05:21.710> expect<00:05:22.189> it<00:05:22.309> to<00:05:22.520> to<00:05:23.240> be<00:05:23.360> worth<00:05:23.539> a

00:05:23.679 --> 00:05:23.689 
honesty I'd expect it to to be worth a

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:26.170 
honesty I'd expect it to to be worth a
tad<00:05:23.930> more<00:05:23.960> than<00:05:24.379> that<00:05:24.650> I'm<00:05:25.430> not<00:05:25.460> surprised

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180 
tad more than that I'm not surprised

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.929 
tad more than that I'm not surprised
