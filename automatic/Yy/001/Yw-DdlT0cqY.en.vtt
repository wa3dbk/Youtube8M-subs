00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 we quickly cheap and reliable fifa 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.029
 buy coins and go to confit 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.470
 verkoop.nl use code t the tv safe 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:09.300
 percent quarter century 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.530
 yes I miss market parties this is and 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.610
 new 4 through it took me a while 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:13.530
 wanted to have you made 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.230
 ditch this is it here so see it now 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.789
 this coming gives 190 likes 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.140
 including 2 of me but I found him too 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.760
 just very well 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.920
 he would kick the best and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.510
 therefore our team goes from this 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.680
 to the customer, for example, I already had one 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.029
 it only takes real center back in the 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.130
 chair and therefore did not request it 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.330
 the market thinnest cr i just have him 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.830
 from the markets 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.630
 and the bee was you got your throws and this is 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.610
 now my team with so through which I have 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.290
 dragged when it is difficult to say 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.579
 instead of being all now one 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.809
 overlook the market 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.550
 but of course the grip was taming 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.200
 class is now totally engaging with the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.520
 You can really look horrible 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.860
 tell what i have more plays and 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.270
 man i hate my life right but i go 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
 play bitch with this team and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.300
 hopefully I can pack some fragile ones 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.820
 number permission is the opponents 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.350
 Remember chops this is fucking good 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.780
 tar with that motion in that bal a team 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.149
 precise and john shop or part time 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:01.710
 the real thing that that is incredible 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.030
 fast also has worst back left want 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.019
 89 beast 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.000
 and then it's hard to compete with 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.500
 I'll play a role for the best 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 was amazing through unfortunately did not get the 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.229
 grounds that he has him against that number 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.740
 other to shots you can follow him mine 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.360
 order 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.470
 where the corner turned and god your mine is 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.150
 it also makes me a greater top 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 test kits but he has the ball he 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.790
 give him those short corners for you 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.920
 said it i also find italian 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.479
 its ridiculously ok i course also free 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 often and that drops makes it just make 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.030
 but fifteen minutes with the ball through and 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.890
 his keeper 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.479
 hey tybalt got pretty mother in 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 the shot of teams passing through the best 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.340
 a good one 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.960
 but you can go through with those balls he 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.189
 shoot and score country yes it is 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.909
 tickets is that ball and that you can be 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.799
 shoot well 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.030
 I can also shoot well via but me 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:38.189
 shoot him through player of 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.390
 Then hell something and you go the ball 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.070
 I want to put it back to my keeper 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.810
 in the end it took half a time 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.549
 type in for 3 years 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.170
 And yes with accidents you come 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.729
 Just the guy is not even so 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.200
 it's just yes it's unfortunate that 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.820
 that so happens that it just ruined the 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.130
 match then I get through here I have 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.149
 also such a short cornyx score with sir 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.979
 And then you know that everyone has him 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.509
 spoken way of little dwarf that 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.229
 no voices to your letters to mind 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.350
 m &amp; a 

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.299
 is so extreme pussy in the sense of the 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.649
 player can still be that fast but you can 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.020
 no fast me because he is us too 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:08.340
 about weak way and that's already because 

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.720
 then you have started to vote 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.850
 to be tracked more than 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.500
 the ball lasted that he really 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.030
 a more force sees the symbol more 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.740
 he really scored a world goal 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.470
 of the 420 really a very nice goal 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.300
 I thought only five two was he material 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:21.440
 what should i do with it you know what can i do with it 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.610
 built 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.710
 there he comes back through you with those balls 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.260
 in the 90th minute it we then he scores 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:28.130
 not the 563 but he again attacked him 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.600
 those balls 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:31.670
 he sent them great deep i need him 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.650
 I can do nothing about it you are 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.330
 I too was terribly dominated 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:37.040
 he doesn't stop a great team 

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.600
 the right place all that quality and 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.430
 made good use of it 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.470
 then you really don't have to use steam completely 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.060
 will be the 90 plus space I know that 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.310
 that center x 80 plus some place 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.870
 it would be ridiculously awkward there is 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:49.340
 it guests then it really works whoever 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.660
 to play with them they don't approach me anymore 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.520
 have no because that happens but 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.300
 when he wants you give your general david 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:54.860
 two years 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:56.660
 why did I wonder then 

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.090
 takes way too long should now come 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.290
 another of the keeper remains 100 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.390
 that he is a bit arrogant the beams 

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:03.860
 walk grab something with that means that 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.720
 come anyway with it being the previous one 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:07.040
 match lost but we scored it 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.420
 via so it's just a thumb 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.580
 great for them the one you know is nothing 

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:12.710
 then he is also in a lot of Rome again 

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.180
 through so this is quite an advantage 

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.320
 the carbo lassie a rebreather like you 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.970
 could see head that and inside matt 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:18.260
 ridley you god you may know how 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:20.690
 then this comes along with that 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.250
 needs certain sewing and also because of this 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.320
 with toribio toribio from all right that 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:25.340
 there is more few euros the team played 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.170
 we also have a i must say it is real 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.730
 not bad but now also give up on it 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.230
 head of my first second head already 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.730
 this episode but still reasonable 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.660
 incredible is my coming through here again 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.040
 with ripley 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.210
 agent only a choice in the 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.440
 qualitÃ© and what is the only thing 

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:37.610
 necessary therefore my defense to them 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.230
 just don't have any ps pressure on you 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:41.330
 difficult to get away with but so on 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.530
 outlier the keeper i see you i 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.300
 the player operating system what it 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.620
 red arrow above you something else 

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:47.030
 my cake the computer just tackle that 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.570
 Player is clearly fake calling you via 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.040
 two 

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.440
 this it here too I just want tasty 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:51.980
 date according to keep panties via easter for 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:53.510
 retard 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.520
 fit team in the feet and off load 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.350
 load picks up when still running 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:04:00.050
 around the goal, scored against the pipe 

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:01.310
 two then this point yes boy that it 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:02.630
 is clamping very all three way comes in 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.280
 defend the heading of course my 

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:05.360
 bush run go on the keeper and you 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.500
 guessed it already 6 2 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:07.400
 then I have to accept it on this 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:09.890
 moment and it will only be 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.810
 worse that it is the grass ironic of this 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:13.970
 is that I am talking about midnight 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.060
 played at midnight say something there 

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:18.620
 well and i can complete chrome os committee 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:19.910
 copy his most recent video 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.430
 because he also said play at night 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:24.260
 seems so extreme pussy i don't know how 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.430
 that is possible but you suddenly come across teams 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.750
 where people who can do very well 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.760
 and then sometimes you just know 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:30.110
 no chance if you see a team 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.670
 I put a ts in the through 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.630
 and that performs really great I have 

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:34.820
 also a few trade professional 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.140
 played but the rest yes you can there 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:38.060
 just nothing more to tech where you 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.560
 runs into teams that have ball and jill stores 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.210
 to the is just not stopping at that 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:42.530
 moment but i come here oh i have to 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.550
 say this man i thought i played it 

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.780
 but right and made me want of course 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.550
 of the recordings when I will have one more 

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:48.200
 bit into the flow of okay videos 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.820
 we try that he he seemed 

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:51.110
 created more opportunities than me and start 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.910
 yet there was mantle are two more sita 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:55.250
 good chance first keeper ball on the post 

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:56.900
 just the corner here with ibadah on it 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:58.640
 head of gol darn ever van gorp and he 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.330
 headlined a role and that's how I stand 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.920
 a zero behind 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:02.450
 technical team with in the fair here 

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:04.430
 then me but he comes by my job 

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:06.470
 through that and I of course and I have 

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.910
 hannibal you with her old through 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:09.680
 certainly with their tourists sun for eight and 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.360
 nine shooting a deep rakes every ball 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.070
 through in gives him great too 

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.990
 on way but they then shootings me 

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:16.850
 disappointed that made him just beside paul 

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:18.260
 and there through you the ball guide brand alan short 

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:19.940
 corner you know how this is going to work on 

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:21.980
 more loafing jacobo countings 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.240
 results between two one people like you 

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:24.590
 soon just leave a comment 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.420
 also its not where to look that 

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.250
 player is not ex thinking because that is too 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.480
 rather annoying I can sniper well 

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:31.460
 some space just doesn't really expose 

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:33.230
 the market come out as many as three one out 

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.850
 press start and weekske and that 

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:36.230
