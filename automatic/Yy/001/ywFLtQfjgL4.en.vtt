00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.420 
a little tricky if you want to remove

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.070 
a little tricky if you want to remove
the<00:03:04.250> the<00:03:05.250> road<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.670> you<00:03:05.850> just<00:03:06.030> added<00:03:06.300> you

00:03:07.070 --> 00:03:07.080 
the the road that you just added you

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.740 
the the road that you just added you
need<00:03:07.290> to<00:03:07.440> press<00:03:08.010> the<00:03:08.490> minus<00:03:08.940> button<00:03:09.300> here

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
need to press the minus button here

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.450 
need to press the minus button here
which<00:03:09.900> is<00:03:10.170> confusing<00:03:10.710> because<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.100> says<00:03:11.310> a

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:11.460 
which is confusing because it says a

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.160 
which is confusing because it says a
dream<00:03:11.760> of<00:03:11.910> column<00:03:12.270> it<00:03:12.390> doesn't<00:03:12.630> say<00:03:12.720> it<00:03:12.840> remove

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:13.170 
dream of column it doesn't say it remove

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:15.680 
dream of column it doesn't say it remove
rows<00:03:13.440> okay<00:03:13.860> but<00:03:14.100> just<00:03:14.130> keep<00:03:14.430> that<00:03:14.610> in<00:03:14.670> mind<00:03:14.970> ok

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
rows okay but just keep that in mind ok

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.690 
rows okay but just keep that in mind ok
so<00:03:15.750> we<00:03:16.020> remove<00:03:16.320> that<00:03:16.470> extra<00:03:16.920> rock<00:03:17.490> is<00:03:17.670> the

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
so we remove that extra rock is the

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.840 
so we remove that extra rock is the
widow<00:03:17.910> needs<00:03:18.150> right<00:03:18.330> now<00:03:18.360> and<00:03:19.490> what<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.610> see

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:23.550 
here on the right is the module that we

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.910
