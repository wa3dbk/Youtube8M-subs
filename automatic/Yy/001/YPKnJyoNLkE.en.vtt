00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.040
 when it was 2.3 in fact we knew 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.010
 already we would do the operator 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:27.870
 system it was already on the paper etc 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:29.500
 and in the hide while we have 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.660
 the experience of the site 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.880
 we needed the cidj experts 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:35.260
 each operator with capabilities 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:38.050
 special what we want behind this 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.059
 that we seek is to explode the 

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.670
 teamplay because in fact we follow the 

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:45.520
 book line originally the book 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.720
 that's it rainbow six it's the team of 

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.220
 best intervention forces to 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.629
 around the world and it's a mix and 

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:52.420
 match of different nations that's 

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:55.230
 exactly what we do by pushing 

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.230
 the bar even further 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:46.329
 so in fact we made 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.369
 the system operator a single choice 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:51.229
 operators per player and mix 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.270
 manufactures the tactics of a 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.819
 responsibility of choice as soon as a player 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.619
 chooses an operators operator is 

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:59.689
 no longer available and it sends a signal to 

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:02.890
 all the other players that this is it's 

00:01:59.689 --> 00:02:02.890
 made the communication between players 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.530
