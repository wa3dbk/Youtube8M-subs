00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 we bite into the twin 8 and let's see 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:09.980
 connect with a seatbelt 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:12.049
 let's learn it here in stock stop 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:13.940
 when I love how that sounds 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.920
 it seems like his car is the 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:18.520
 future so it turns on all systems 

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:18.520
 check 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:28.780
 yes 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.779
 9 8 is a vehicle full of innovation and 

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.510
 ecology a story that started in the 

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.940
 2011 when it was presented for the first time 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:41.370
 at the Frankfurt autoshow this 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.370
 supercar is today a reality 

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:59.110
 and 8 passes without mobility in technology 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:03.220
 hybrid and it's also an electrical plugin 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.410
 The G8 has two engines the first 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.020
 turbocharged three cylinder engines 

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:15.340
 that produces 228 horsepower on 8 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.700
 accelerates from 0 to 60 miles per hour in 4.4 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:20.810
 seconds 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.299
 has a maximum speed of 155 miles 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.960
 per hour night they also have another engine 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:29.179
 that the electric motor that produces 

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:31.060
 129 horsepower is important 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:34.399
 notice that this vehicle 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.560
 technically creates traction at four 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:38.929
 wheels the vigo 8 has to be the 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.310
 the most advanced vehicle in the world and with a 

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:44.810
 price thinking at 135,925 dollars has 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.990
 to be the vehicle for the most cost 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.599
 cheap counting the technology it offers 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:53.509
 three problems driving the first is the 

00:01:50.599 --> 00:01:56.810
 stripmob obviously the equipment is pure 

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:59.060
 electric the other program is with formaldehyde 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:01.489
 which is like the hybrid car and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.079
 there is also the sport because they say 

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:06.349
 which is for but the truth is that it is more 

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:09.170
 gasoline engine that electric motor something 

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:12.019
 very interesting to note is that this 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:15.709
 car sounds amazing if you for this in 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:20.650
 sport suddenly a gasoline engine will 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:20.650
 they put more batteries really listen to this 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:30.580
 something very interesting that you see in melo itself 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.180
 same as the n 5 amplifies what it has 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.730
 another type of engine noise but that 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.740
 amplifies the sound of the three engine 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:40.880
 turbocharged cylinders why that sounds 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:43.400
 A) Yes 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.710
 now driving around the curves like 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:48.740
 say because this car like it has a 

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:52.570
 very low part that truly is 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:55.700
 try to handle it by the curves 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:58.760
 personally I will tell you I am a 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:02.570
 very traditional person this same tone 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.310
 of voice is what I would like to see is that 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.920
 This vehicle goes on sale in July 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:11.870
 that will have a price of around 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:16.280
 130 thousand dollars in a version m well in 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:21.310
 the m1 and I have a 12 cylinder engine or 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.310
 the pe 8 that we see in 95 that I think 

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:33.180
 good next week 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.620
 my own 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.620
 ah 

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:04.320
 Y
