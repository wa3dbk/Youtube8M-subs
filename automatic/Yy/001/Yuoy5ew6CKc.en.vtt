 honda xr 150 

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:43.000
 so this unit has already traveled a thousand 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:46.650
 something kilometers that is to everyone 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:50.440
 already passed the owner of this unit 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:55.660
 says that the maximum speed of 10 kilometers 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:56.860
 on a flat road over the drive and I rode a 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:02.470
 much better 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:06.270
 xr 125 so tell you what the difference 

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:11.560
 between this honda xr 150 motorcycle and 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:13.870
 honda xr 125 the first thing is of course 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.360
 cubic capacity 25 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:20.760
 cubic centimeters I'll tell you i 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.840
 I rode very much felt in the rod 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.280
 motorcycle on the news yes boredom is not 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:31.020

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:43.840

 new wing too another goes whole in 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:07.069
 the rest is necessary on this bike 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:09.769
 same well next turn signals so 

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:11.030
 what did the owner of this motorcycle 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.819
 given fight 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:22.670
 see installed corrugations corrugations have 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:28.609
 Chinese 65 hryvnia pair this review on 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:33.889
 rear mono absorber installed with 

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:38.859
 Soviet car Volga pipe 

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:42.349
 to the air filter so look 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:45.430
 very nice we will see how much 

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:48.829
 she from ride and i will write you in 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:53.000
 further reviews how much is departure 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:55.909
 front chinese flutes and this one 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.879
 back as you know or I don't remember 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.730
 did you speak chinese that is 

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:05.000
 italian which i ordered on louis 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:09.230
 and my departure is 17 and then they 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:13.129
 burst to 17 thousand were very active 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:16.639
 drive and so after thousands of kilometers 

00:04:13.129 --> 00:04:20.299
 regulated valve why so how on 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.070
 certain revolutions were heard for 

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:23.720
 skating 

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:25.270
 engine so regulated valve 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.919
 deviations were small 

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:29.349
 I am very much a valve 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:33.560
 adjusted 

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:37.550
 the sound is not that missing but some 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:39.980
 but something is left I think it will pass with 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:43.820
 increasing mileage this sound 

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.300
 will and will be much clearer to work 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:48.950
 engine 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.760
 so I had 120 heels like 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.760
 running lit 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:00.759
 engine woodpeckers 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.370
 to k to to k to to to tok to tok to to to 

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.370
 Someone, Something, Something, Something 

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:19.320
 exhaust ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.440
 ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta ta 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.440
 that 

00:05:33.049 --> 00:05:36.929
 what else do I want to say the advantages of this 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:39.629
 motorcycle 

00:05:36.929 --> 00:05:40.379
 ferret who hanged herself and twenty 

00:05:39.629 --> 00:05:43.289
 five dice 

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:45.179
 but as the owner says 

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:47.339
 the motorcycle costs it goes somewhere 

00:05:45.179 --> 00:05:48.239
 within two and a half liters per 

00:05:47.339 --> 00:05:51.389
 a hundred 

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:55.529
 I think too much difference between 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.879
 125 and 150 kai will not be but in the city that 

00:05:55.529 --> 00:06:01.979
 I think 50k will take less 

00:05:58.879 --> 00:06:05.699
 in general, it is the same bike as 

00:06:01.979 --> 00:06:09.809
 and honda xr 125 12 liters tank seat 

00:06:05.699 --> 00:06:12.299
 still remained tough trunk 

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:21.979
 what is the weight of the plastic itself 

00:06:12.299 --> 00:06:25.199
 like 120 heels so wheels 17 by 19 

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.559
 data given wheel ratio 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:31.679
 problematic in Ukraine is hard to find 

00:06:28.559 --> 00:06:35.069
 suitable rubber of this particular size 

00:06:31.679 --> 00:06:37.979
 especially the front 90 by 90 as since 

00:06:35.069 --> 00:06:43.469
 we have a very big shortage basically I 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:46.669
 changed mitosis for 190 I am 07 not bad tires 

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:46.669
 recomend for everybody 

00:06:47.080 --> 00:06:54.909
 what else did I want to say I rode on 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:56.650
 I don't know a motorcycle or I have been three weeks 

00:06:54.909 --> 00:06:59.800
 he did not ride on a Honda 

00:06:56.650 --> 00:07:01.659
 it seems to be but exactly standing up to me 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.909
 This bike seemed more convenient so 

00:07:01.659 --> 00:07:06.689
 how not to chase the wheel will not be 

00:07:03.909 --> 00:07:06.689
 here above
