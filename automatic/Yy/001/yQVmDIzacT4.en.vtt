another<00:02:57.600> Mayweather<00:02:58.080> undercard<00:02:58.709> I<00:02:58.950> think<00:02:59.910> it

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
another Mayweather undercard I think it

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.500 
another Mayweather undercard I think it
would<00:03:00.120> be<00:03:00.150> an<00:03:00.330> insult<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.810> him<00:03:01.080> because<00:03:01.770> uh<00:03:01.800> he

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
would be an insult to him because uh he

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:05.300 
would be an insult to him because uh he
just<00:03:03.510> feels<00:03:03.900> like<00:03:04.260> he<00:03:04.770> should<00:03:04.980> be<00:03:05.010> fighting

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310

mayweather<00:03:05.900> so<00:03:06.900> I<00:03:07.230> don't<00:03:07.440> think<00:03:07.620> they're

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:07.770 
mayweather so I don't think they're

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:09.290 
mayweather so I don't think they're
gonna<00:03:07.890> put<00:03:08.160> me<00:03:08.220> with<00:03:08.550> her<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.790> with<00:03:08.910> Robert

gonna put me with her in with Robert
girl<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.930> yet<00:03:10.200> um<00:03:11.120> that<00:03:12.120> would<00:03:12.300> be<00:03:12.480> in<00:03:12.900> my

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
girl just yet um that would be in my

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:14.930 
girl just yet um that would be in my
opinion<00:03:13.530> a<00:03:13.709> more<00:03:13.920> intriguing<00:03:14.250> matchup

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:14.940 
opinion a more intriguing matchup

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.300 
opinion a more intriguing matchup
because<00:03:15.350> Robert<00:03:16.350> girl<00:03:16.530> really<00:03:16.830> knows<00:03:17.070> how<00:03:17.280> to

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310 
because Robert girl really knows how to

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.410 
because Robert girl really knows how to
smother<00:03:17.820> ah<00:03:18.260> an<00:03:19.260> opponent<00:03:19.830> like<00:03:19.890> Mayweather

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
so to me that would be very interesting
