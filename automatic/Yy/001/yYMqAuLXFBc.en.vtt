it<00:03:46.290> clicks<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.820> let's<00:03:47.970> just<00:03:48.120> do<00:03:48.270> some<00:03:48.450> really

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
it clicks so let's just do some really

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:50.870 
it clicks so let's just do some really
simple<00:03:48.930> approach<00:03:49.320> to<00:03:49.560> this<00:03:49.680> again<00:03:50.010> listen<00:03:50.820> to

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:50.880 
simple approach to this again listen to

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:52.660 
simple approach to this again listen to
how<00:03:50.970> simple<00:03:51.360> I'm<00:03:51.420> going<00:03:51.480> to<00:03:51.630> keep<00:03:51.810> it<00:03:52.020> and

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
how simple I'm going to keep it and

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.920 
how simple I'm going to keep it and
you'll<00:03:53.670> hear<00:03:53.970> where<00:03:54.150> I'm<00:03:54.180> accenting<00:03:54.810> the

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
you'll hear where I'm accenting the

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:56.690 
you'll hear where I'm accenting the
chord<00:03:55.200> changes<00:03:55.410> by<00:03:55.769> changing<00:03:56.220> up<00:03:56.340> what<00:03:56.580> I'm

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
chord changes by changing up what I'm

simple<00:05:22.310> it's<00:05:22.670> playing<00:05:22.940> that<00:05:23.120> pocket<00:05:23.690> and<00:05:24.130> the

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.130 
simple it's playing that pocket and the

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:28.660 
simple it's playing that pocket and the
final<00:05:25.610> step<00:05:25.880> that<00:05:25.940> is<00:05:26.540> a<00:05:27.500> long<00:05:27.800> step<00:05:28.160> meaning

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:28.670 
final step that is a long step meaning

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:33.070 
final step that is a long step meaning
it<00:05:28.820> takes<00:05:29.030> years<00:05:29.210> to<00:05:29.360> develop<00:05:29.690> it<00:05:30.550> is<00:05:32.080> phrasing

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
it takes years to develop it is phrasing

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.620 
it takes years to develop it is phrasing
the<00:05:33.230> phrasing<00:05:33.680> of<00:05:33.830> your<00:05:34.070> your<00:05:34.700> musical<00:05:35.270> ideas

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:35.630

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.780 
the phrasing of your your musical ideas
and<00:05:35.870> your<00:05:35.990> riffs<00:05:36.200> and<00:05:36.410> all<00:05:36.590> that<00:05:36.830> so<00:05:37.160> my

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
and your riffs and all that so my

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.880 
and your riffs and all that so my
suggestion<00:05:38.360> is<00:05:38.450> start<00:05:38.720> simple<00:05:39.140> try<00:05:39.470> one

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
suggestion is start simple try one

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:43.450 
suggestion is start simple try one
little<00:05:41.200> riff<00:05:42.200> over<00:05:42.410> each<00:05:42.680> chord<00:05:43.010> change<00:05:43.280> and

00:05:43.450 --> 00:05:43.460 
little riff over each chord change and

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:51.220 
little riff over each chord change and
see<00:05:43.580> how<00:05:43.700> you<00:05:43.760> feel<00:05:43.970> keep<00:05:44.240> it<00:05:44.360> simple

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:51.230 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:06:15.320 

becomes<00:05:52.230> the<00:05:52.410> one<00:05:52.560> chord

00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:15.330 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:17.940 

all<00:06:16.330> right<00:06:16.510> two<00:06:16.870> separate<00:06:17.290> ideas<00:06:17.620> just<00:06:17.830> to

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:17.950 
all right two separate ideas just to

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.550 
all right two separate ideas just to
separate<00:06:18.400> riffs<00:06:18.640> don't<00:06:18.910> worry<00:06:19.090> about<00:06:19.560> copying

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:20.560 
separate riffs don't worry about copying

00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:22.440 
separate riffs don't worry about copying
exactly<00:06:20.710> what<00:06:21.280> I'm<00:06:21.400> doing<00:06:21.730> just<00:06:21.760> come<00:06:22.150> up<00:06:22.270> with

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.450 
exactly what I'm doing just come up with

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:24.930 
exactly what I'm doing just come up with
one<00:06:22.750> or<00:06:22.900> two<00:06:22.930> simple<00:06:23.440> ideas<00:06:23.800> and<00:06:24.100> your<00:06:24.730> next

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:24.940 
one or two simple ideas and your next

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
step beyond that is to just slowly

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:28.700

combining<00:06:31.630> two<00:06:31.810> riffs<00:06:32.230> together<00:06:32.680> that's<00:06:33.310> one

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:33.610 
combining two riffs together that's one

00:06:33.610 --> 00:06:35.850 
combining two riffs together that's one
idea<00:06:33.820> but<00:06:34.510> sometimes<00:06:34.870> it's<00:06:35.080> just<00:06:35.140> how<00:06:35.740> much

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:35.860 
idea but sometimes it's just how much

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:37.710 
idea but sometimes it's just how much
space<00:06:36.160> should<00:06:36.340> I<00:06:36.430> expect<00:06:36.760> my<00:06:36.910> experiment<00:06:37.570> with

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:37.720 
space should I expect my experiment with

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:40.500 
space should I expect my experiment with
leaving<00:06:37.900> a<00:06:38.230> little<00:06:38.410> space<00:06:38.650> and<00:06:39.510> then

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:40.510 
leaving a little space and then

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:48.140 
leaving a little space and then
connecting<00:06:41.320> that<00:06:41.440> second<00:06:41.860> riff<00:06:42.300> you<00:06:43.300> might<00:06:43.450> go

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:48.150 

00:06:48.150 --> 00:06:50.430 

connect<00:06:49.150> like<00:06:49.300> a<00:06:49.330> little<00:06:49.570> column<00:06:49.840> answer<00:06:50.170> riff

00:06:50.430 --> 00:06:50.440 
connect like a little column answer riff

00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:56.260 
or you might go sounds like one idea but

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:58.440 
or you might go sounds like one idea but
