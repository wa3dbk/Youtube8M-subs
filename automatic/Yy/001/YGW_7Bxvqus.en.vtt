00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:18.390
 created on August 19, 1969 at embraer 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:21.540
 acts in all stages of the construction of 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.790
 aircraft from the initial design to the 

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:25.830
 sale and support of aircraft for the 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:29.430
 segments of commercial aviation and 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.150
 In 2007, the company implemented a 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.490
 the new management model is based on the 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.739
 philosophy on the fetus in or 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:40.980
 Lean manufacturing focused on reducing 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.500
 different types of waste between them 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.129
 are the waiting time for transport and 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.129
 the defects 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.969
 It was fortunate that we did it on 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:56.449
 2007 because in 2009 we came across 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:59.579
 with a crisis in the international market 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.190
 this crisis has extended to the road and that 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.290
 to this day it has not yet fully 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.200
 recovered in all markets 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:09.570
 p3 is put into practice by means of 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:12.030
 of so-called improvement cells 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.370
 in which the members of the 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:18.930
 teams organize to develop 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:21.390
 all processes in total are 437 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.700
 resistant cells that pass through a 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.680
 goal overcoming process 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.290
 each group receives bronze medal 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.119
 silver or gold according to 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 performance achieved 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:35.340
 one of the examples that reflects the practice of 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.710
 new management model is the time 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.409
 completion of an aircraft 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:42.780
 the old methodology was discarded 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.030
 thus opening up to a new mode of 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.950
 aircraft production 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:48.840
 when we changed dock paulinho 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.969
 assembly cycle of an airplane reduced from 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.159
 22 days to 12 and later 

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:55.159
 progressively up to seven days 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.890
 manual parts painting 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.940
 aircraft were practically absorbed 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.850
 by robots 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.910
 currently embraer has 33 new 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:11.009
 robots that replace manual labor 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.160
 robotic painting for example 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:16.620
 increased productivity six times and 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.920
 the cost of rework decreases by about 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:22.470
 from 200 thousand dollars to about 37 thousand 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.520
 dollars per month with all changes 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.820
 applied to embraer earned 12.2 billion 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.800
 of real 24 percent higher in 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:35.100
 from the previous year 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:39.870
 already the net profit went from 574 million 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:42.000
 from real in 2010 to 698 million in 

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.910
 2012 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.520
 an example is really is in the world is 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.890
 We have Singapore presence at 

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:52.800
 California running through any of the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.660
 of the world but has a presence in 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:57.570
 more than 40 countries 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:59.850
 so goes more than presence through 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:02.580
 of customers we have generation of 

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:05.340
 products and revenue both abroad and 

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.890
 on in Portugal as we have in China as 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.370
 we have in the United States, so that was 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:12.570
 another front of wide development 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:15.290
 within our organization over the past 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.290
 years
