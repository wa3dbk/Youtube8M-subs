00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
video is kind of the more simplistic

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.750 
video is kind of the more simplistic
graphic<00:01:03.149> look<00:01:03.480> that<00:01:03.809> I<00:01:03.840> like<00:01:04.170> on<00:01:04.890> t-shirts<00:01:05.489> but

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
graphic look that I like on t-shirts but

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.940 
graphic look that I like on t-shirts but
I<00:01:05.939> feel<00:01:06.420> like<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:06.960> has<00:01:07.170> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:07.470> bit<00:01:07.650> more<00:01:07.710> of

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
I feel like it has a little bit more of

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.380 
I feel like it has a little bit more of
an<00:01:08.040> artistic<00:01:08.369> quality<00:01:08.939> to<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> which<00:01:09.360> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
an artistic quality to it which is

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.330 
an artistic quality to it which is
something<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.170> feel<00:01:10.500> is<00:01:10.560> missing<00:01:11.100> and

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
something that I feel is missing and

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
something that I feel is missing and
that's<00:01:11.640> why<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:11.880> decided<00:01:12.210> to<00:01:12.540> design<00:01:12.960> the

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
that's why I decided to design the

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.670 
that's why I decided to design the
shirts<00:01:13.350> in<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.830> place<00:01:15.259> so<00:01:16.259> getting

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
shirts in the first place so getting

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.469 
shirts in the first place so getting
into<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.130> design<00:01:17.490> I'm<00:01:17.640> working<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.390> I

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
into the design I'm working on here I

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.020 
into the design I'm working on here I
start<00:01:18.840> out<00:01:18.930> with<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.470> pencil<00:01:19.950> drawing<00:01:20.400> and<00:01:20.729> I'll

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:10.070 
so a lot of times I'll do this brush
first<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.640> I<00:02:09.090> can't<00:02:09.330> Carolee<00:02:09.629> get<00:02:09.780> tight

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
first and I can't Carolee get tight

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.680 
first and I can't Carolee get tight
edges<00:02:10.560> with<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.890> one<00:02:11.069> so<00:02:11.640> I'll<00:02:12.090> go<00:02:12.480> back

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
edges with this one so I'll go back

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.580 
edges with this one so I'll go back
through<00:02:13.140> with

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
through with

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.740 
through with
one<00:02:13.739> of<00:02:13.860> my<00:02:14.510> finer<00:02:15.510> tip<00:02:15.810> ballpoint<00:02:16.709> pens<00:02:17.750> which

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
one of my finer tip ballpoint pens which

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.240 
one of my finer tip ballpoint pens which
for<00:02:19.290> this<00:02:19.440> design<00:02:19.860> I<00:02:20.220> used<00:02:20.580> prismacolor<00:02:21.510> and

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
for this design I used prismacolor and

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
for this design I used prismacolor and
it<00:02:23.250> is<00:02:23.780> it's<00:02:24.780> like<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.319> oh<00:02:25.770> five<00:02:26.430> I<00:02:26.819> think<00:02:27.090> that

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:27.270 
it is it's like the oh five I think that

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:29.330 
it is it's like the oh five I think that
I'm<00:02:27.390> using<00:02:27.599> and<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.319> use<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.770> to<00:02:28.980> tighten<00:02:29.280> up

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
I'm using and I use that to tighten up

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.949 
I'm using and I use that to tighten up
stuff<00:02:29.580> now<00:02:29.610> if<00:02:29.849> I<00:02:29.910> really<00:02:30.180> really<00:02:30.209> want<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.870> get

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
stuff now if I really really want to get

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.620 
stuff now if I really really want to get
really<00:02:31.319> tight<00:02:31.560> with<00:02:32.090> certain<00:02:33.090> things<00:02:33.330> then

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
really tight with certain things then

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.309 
really tight with certain things then
I'll<00:02:33.840> use<00:02:34.050> one<00:02:34.230> of<00:02:34.260> the<00:02:34.410> finer<00:02:34.590> tip<00:02:34.940> pens<00:02:36.319> so

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:37.319 
I'll use one of the finer tip pens so

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.339 
I'll use one of the finer tip pens so
when<00:02:38.040> it<00:02:38.130> comes<00:02:38.370> to<00:02:38.640> inking<00:02:39.150> in<00:02:39.390> these<00:02:40.019> weird

00:02:40.339 --> 00:02:40.349 
when it comes to inking in these weird

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:42.140 
when it comes to inking in these weird
designs<00:02:40.830> and<00:02:41.280> things<00:02:41.370> like<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.610> to<00:02:42.000> give

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
designs and things like that to give

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.089 
designs and things like that to give
that<00:02:42.360> kind<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:42.959> these<00:02:43.080> weird<00:02:43.290> textures<00:02:43.800> and

00:02:44.089 --> 00:02:44.099 
that kind of these weird textures and

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:46.430 
that kind of these weird textures and
things<00:02:44.130> like<00:02:44.430> that<00:02:44.750> there's<00:02:45.750> no<00:02:45.870> real<00:02:46.049> rhyme

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
things like that there's no real rhyme

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.740 
things like that there's no real rhyme
or<00:02:46.470> reason<00:02:46.769> to<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.069> I<00:02:47.370> I<00:02:47.940> go<00:02:48.209> pretty<00:02:48.480> quick

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
or reason to it I I go pretty quick

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.990 
or reason to it I I go pretty quick
through<00:02:48.959> this<00:02:49.110> because<00:02:49.650> I'm<00:02:50.340> not<00:02:50.459> planning<00:02:50.700> it

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
through this because I'm not planning it

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.870 
through this because I'm not planning it
out<00:02:51.120> I'm<00:02:51.330> not<00:02:51.569> worrying<00:02:52.019> too<00:02:52.080> much<00:02:52.290> about<00:02:52.739> it

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
out I'm not worrying too much about it

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.970 
out I'm not worrying too much about it
I'm<00:02:54.120> just<00:02:54.450> thinking<00:02:55.110> hey<00:02:55.350> you<00:02:55.410> know<00:02:55.709> some

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
I'm just thinking hey you know some

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.100 
I'm just thinking hey you know some
vertical<00:02:56.670> lines<00:02:57.030> will<00:02:57.299> really<00:02:57.540> contrast

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:58.110 
vertical lines will really contrast

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.449 
vertical lines will really contrast
these<00:02:58.319> horizontal<00:02:58.650> lines

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
these horizontal lines

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.550 
these horizontal lines
I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.690> some<00:03:00.870> lines<00:03:01.080> going<00:03:01.319> in<00:03:01.470> different

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
I think some lines going in different

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.140 
I think some lines going in different
directions<00:03:01.769> will<00:03:02.280> add<00:03:02.370> some<00:03:02.610> interest<00:03:03.030> to

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
directions will add some interest to

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.880 
directions will add some interest to
this<00:03:03.269> but<00:03:03.780> then<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.930> want<00:03:04.110> some<00:03:04.260> real<00:03:04.440> thick

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
this but then I want some real thick

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.020 
this but then I want some real thick
lines<00:03:05.220> for<00:03:05.819> contrast<00:03:06.420> so<00:03:07.069> I'll<00:03:08.069> do<00:03:08.580> some<00:03:08.610> like

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
lines for contrast so I'll do some like

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.140 
lines for contrast so I'll do some like
graffiti<00:03:09.239> type<00:03:09.840> stuff<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> then<00:03:11.120> you<00:03:12.120> know

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
graffiti type stuff and then you know

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.660 
graffiti type stuff and then you know
different<00:03:12.690> shapes<00:03:12.989> circles<00:03:13.349> triangles<00:03:14.220> all

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
different shapes circles triangles all

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:17.420 
different shapes circles triangles all
kinds<00:03:15.060> of<00:03:15.120> stuff<00:03:15.530> just<00:03:16.530> to<00:03:16.620> really<00:03:17.280> add

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
kinds of stuff just to really add

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:19.340 
kinds of stuff just to really add
interest<00:03:17.730> because<00:03:18.299> this<00:03:18.480> design<00:03:18.900> is<00:03:19.140> more

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
interest because this design is more

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.130 
interest because this design is more
about<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:20.070> the<00:03:20.459> line<00:03:20.700> work<00:03:21.000> the<00:03:21.329> shapes<00:03:21.690> and

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
about the the line work the shapes and

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:23.990 
about the the line work the shapes and
all<00:03:22.410> that<00:03:22.709> stuff<00:03:23.040> kind<00:03:23.280> of<00:03:23.430> like<00:03:23.640> creating

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
all that stuff kind of like creating

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.780 
all that stuff kind of like creating
this<00:03:24.299> big<00:03:24.870> cohesive<00:03:25.320> piece<00:03:26.220> of<00:03:26.430> artwork<00:03:27.650> but

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
this big cohesive piece of artwork but

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.490 
this big cohesive piece of artwork but
yes<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.780> swirls

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
yes and then the swirls

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920 
yes and then the swirls
I<00:03:31.650> add<00:03:31.829> those<00:03:32.130> and<00:03:32.519> those<00:03:32.910> really<00:03:33.390> contrast

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
I add those and those really contrast

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.650 
I add those and those really contrast
how<00:03:34.489> graphic<00:03:35.489> everything<00:03:35.940> looks<00:03:36.150> so<00:03:36.299> I<00:03:36.329> really

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:36.660 
how graphic everything looks so I really

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.930 
how graphic everything looks so I really
like<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:36.930> swirls<00:03:37.260> a<00:03:37.319> lot<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:37.709> like<00:03:38.250> for<00:03:38.640> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
like the swirls a lot so like for the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:40.370 
like the swirls a lot so like for the
feet<00:03:39.359> on<00:03:39.569> the<00:03:39.900> turtle

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
feet on the turtle

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.740 
feet on the turtle
I<00:03:40.410> did<00:03:41.040> all<00:03:41.250> swirls<00:03:41.730> and<00:03:41.910> I<00:03:42.150> feel<00:03:42.359> like<00:03:42.510> that

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:42.750 
I did all swirls and I feel like that

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:46.129 
I did all swirls and I feel like that
really<00:03:43.310> contrasts<00:03:44.310> the<00:03:44.730> geometric<00:03:45.630> shape<00:03:45.930> of

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:46.139 
really contrasts the geometric shape of

00:03:46.139 --> 00:03:50.900 
really contrasts the geometric shape of
the<00:03:46.230> house<00:03:46.440> that's<00:03:46.739> on<00:03:46.889> this<00:03:47.040> back<00:03:49.700> I'd<00:03:50.700> have

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:50.910 
the house that's on this back I'd have

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.300 
the house that's on this back I'd have
to<00:03:51.030> say<00:03:51.209> that<00:03:51.569> drawing<00:03:52.470> like<00:03:52.680> this<00:03:52.709> is<00:03:53.100> very

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 
to say that drawing like this is very

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:55.129 
to say that drawing like this is very
different<00:03:53.519> than<00:03:53.730> the<00:03:54.329> way<00:03:54.480> I<00:03:54.510> normally<00:03:54.720> draw

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:55.139 
different than the way I normally draw

00:03:55.139 --> 00:03:58.309 
different than the way I normally draw
and<00:03:55.500> it's<00:03:56.250> it's<00:03:57.060> very<00:03:57.180> free-flowing

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
and it's it's very free-flowing

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:00.920 
and it's it's very free-flowing
I<00:03:59.040> don't<00:03:59.609> worry<00:03:59.880> too<00:03:59.940> much<00:04:00.090> about<00:04:00.299> making

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
I don't worry too much about making

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.140 
I don't worry too much about making
mistakes<00:04:00.989> which<00:04:01.950> is<00:04:02.130> nice<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.579> normally<00:04:02.970> don't

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
mistakes which is nice I normally don't

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.170 
mistakes which is nice I normally don't
anyway<00:04:03.709> you<00:04:04.709> can<00:04:04.859> always<00:04:04.980> fix<00:04:05.310> them<00:04:05.459> but<00:04:05.700> when

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
anyway you can always fix them but when

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.330 
anyway you can always fix them but when
you're<00:04:06.299> working<00:04:06.420> with<00:04:06.720> pen<00:04:06.959> and<00:04:06.989> ink<00:04:07.230> you<00:04:08.220> know

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
you're working with pen and ink you know

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:10.250 
you're working with pen and ink you know
you<00:04:08.400> you<00:04:09.090> just<00:04:09.299> kind<00:04:09.510> of<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:09.720> to<00:04:09.750> alter

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:10.260 
you you just kind of have to alter

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.620 
you you just kind of have to alter
things<00:04:10.700> if<00:04:11.700> you<00:04:11.819> make<00:04:11.970> a<00:04:12.000> mistake<00:04:12.180> you<00:04:12.600> just

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:12.630 
things if you make a mistake you just

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:14.900 
things if you make a mistake you just
change<00:04:13.109> the<00:04:13.410> shape<00:04:13.680> you<00:04:13.859> made<00:04:14.040> so<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.370> you

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:14.910 
change the shape you made so that you

00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:18.259 
change the shape you made so that you
know<00:04:15.030> it<00:04:15.900> looked<00:04:16.169> okay<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.669> once<00:04:17.940> I<00:04:18.060> have<00:04:18.239> all

00:04:18.259 --> 00:04:18.269 
know it looked okay so once I have all

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:20.659 
know it looked okay so once I have all
my<00:04:18.389> ink<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.289> everything<00:04:20.039> like<00:04:20.160> that<00:04:20.220> done

00:04:20.659 --> 00:04:20.669 
my ink and everything like that done

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:23.870 
my ink and everything like that done
then<00:04:21.180> I<00:04:21.530> import<00:04:22.530> it<00:04:22.620> into<00:04:22.860> illustrator<00:04:23.310> which

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:23.880 
then I import it into illustrator which

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.029 
then I import it into illustrator which
is<00:04:24.060> a<00:04:24.090> graphics<00:04:24.630> program<00:04:25.020> I<00:04:25.169> use<00:04:25.380> for<00:04:25.740> graphic

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
is a graphics program I use for graphic

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:27.030 
is a graphics program I use for graphic
design

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:27.040 
design

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.140 
design
and<00:04:27.160> I<00:04:27.550> turn<00:04:28.000> it<00:04:28.150> into<00:04:28.270> vector<00:04:28.750> art<00:04:29.790> so<00:04:30.790> the

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
and I turn it into vector art so the

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:32.880 
and I turn it into vector art so the
reason<00:04:31.420> I<00:04:31.510> turned<00:04:31.570> it<00:04:31.900> into<00:04:32.050> vector<00:04:32.440> art<00:04:32.650> is

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
reason I turned it into vector art is

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:35.850 
reason I turned it into vector art is
because<00:04:33.160> one<00:04:34.000> I<00:04:34.270> remove<00:04:34.690> all<00:04:34.900> the<00:04:35.020> white<00:04:35.230> from

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:35.860 
because one I remove all the white from

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.160 
because one I remove all the white from
the<00:04:35.980> background<00:04:36.160> because<00:04:36.970> I<00:04:37.270> want<00:04:37.540> just<00:04:37.990> the

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.170 
the background because I want just the

00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:40.230 
the background because I want just the
black<00:04:38.410> and<00:04:38.740> I<00:04:38.890> want<00:04:39.100> the<00:04:39.280> shirt<00:04:39.640> to<00:04:39.700> throat

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
black and I want the shirt to throat

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.440 
black and I want the shirt to throat
show<00:04:40.540> through<00:04:41.580> the<00:04:42.580> graphic<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.150> don't<00:04:43.300> want

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:43.450 
show through the graphic I don't want

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.900 
show through the graphic I don't want
there<00:04:43.600> to<00:04:43.630> be<00:04:43.750> any<00:04:43.990> white<00:04:44.320> on<00:04:44.560> there<00:04:44.910> and

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:45.910 
there to be any white on there and

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:48.110 
there to be any white on there and
that's<00:04:46.120> a<00:04:46.240> preference<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.750> have<00:04:46.960> a<00:04:46.990> design

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
that's a preference I have a design

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.560 
that's a preference I have a design
insurance<00:04:49.120> I<00:04:49.240> like<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:51.460> other<00:04:51.610> reason<00:04:52.090> too<00:04:52.270> is

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
insurance I like the other reason too is

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.780 
insurance I like the other reason too is
if<00:04:52.750> it's<00:04:53.140> super<00:04:53.560> high-res<00:04:53.950> I<00:04:54.100> can<00:04:54.250> blow<00:04:54.430> it<00:04:54.640> up

00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:54.790 
if it's super high-res I can blow it up

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:57.720 
if it's super high-res I can blow it up
to<00:04:54.970> any<00:04:55.150> size<00:04:55.420> I<00:04:55.660> want<00:04:56.070> vector<00:04:57.070> graphics<00:04:57.640> are

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.730 
to any size I want vector graphics are

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:00.030 
to any size I want vector graphics are
just<00:04:57.970> really<00:04:58.150> easy<00:04:58.320> to<00:04:59.320> work<00:04:59.410> with<00:04:59.470> as<00:04:59.830> far<00:04:59.980> as

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:00.040 
just really easy to work with as far as

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.940 
just really easy to work with as far as
printing<00:05:00.520> and<00:05:00.670> everything<00:05:01.000> goes<00:05:01.950> another

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:02.950 
printing and everything goes another

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:05.610 
printing and everything goes another
cool<00:05:03.280> thing<00:05:03.490> I<00:05:03.610> can<00:05:03.790> do<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.270> change<00:05:05.020> any<00:05:05.320> color

00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:05.620 
cool thing I can do is change any color

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.830 
cool thing I can do is change any color
so<00:05:05.920> anything<00:05:06.550> you<00:05:06.640> see<00:05:06.850> on<00:05:06.880> here<00:05:07.270> that's<00:05:07.540> black

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:07.840 
so anything you see on here that's black

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:10.530 
so anything you see on here that's black
I<00:05:08.200> can<00:05:08.470> change<00:05:08.710> to<00:05:09.100> red<00:05:09.340> or<00:05:09.700> any<00:05:10.000> color<00:05:10.210> in<00:05:10.420> the

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:10.540 
I can change to red or any color in the

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.920 
I can change to red or any color in the
rainbow<00:05:11.040> and<00:05:12.040> if<00:05:12.880> I<00:05:13.210> wanted<00:05:13.480> to<00:05:13.570> I<00:05:13.660> could

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:13.930 
rainbow and if I wanted to I could

00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:15.840 
rainbow and if I wanted to I could
reverse<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.440> out<00:05:14.530> to<00:05:14.770> do<00:05:14.860> it<00:05:15.010> on<00:05:15.100> a<00:05:15.130> black<00:05:15.460> shirt

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
reverse it out to do it on a black shirt

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.030 
reverse it out to do it on a black shirt
so<00:05:16.240> it<00:05:16.330> would<00:05:16.480> be<00:05:16.660> all<00:05:16.960> the<00:05:17.380> where<00:05:17.770> you<00:05:17.890> see

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:18.040 
so it would be all the where you see

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.310 
so it would be all the where you see
black<00:05:18.250> would<00:05:18.550> be<00:05:18.670> white<00:05:18.930> so<00:05:19.930> that's<00:05:20.110> another

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:20.320 
black would be white so that's another

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.040 
black would be white so that's another
advantage<00:05:20.500> just<00:05:20.980> gives<00:05:21.220> me<00:05:21.400> a<00:05:21.430> lot<00:05:21.670> of<00:05:21.760> options

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
advantage just gives me a lot of options

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.780 
advantage just gives me a lot of options
so<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.770> can<00:05:23.950> explore<00:05:24.310> a<00:05:24.370> lot<00:05:24.640> of<00:05:24.670> different

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
so that I can explore a lot of different

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.110 
so that I can explore a lot of different
designs<00:05:25.360> with<00:05:26.290> the<00:05:26.410> shirt<00:05:26.590> but<00:05:26.920> in<00:05:27.340> this<00:05:27.580> right

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:28.120 
designs with the shirt but in this right

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.780 
designs with the shirt but in this right
here<00:05:28.330> you<00:05:28.480> can<00:05:28.660> see<00:05:28.690> kind<00:05:29.320> of<00:05:29.440> the<00:05:30.400> stuff<00:05:30.670> I

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:30.790 
here you can see kind of the stuff I

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:32.880 
here you can see kind of the stuff I
added<00:05:31.240> to<00:05:31.360> this<00:05:31.510> to<00:05:32.230> make<00:05:32.410> it<00:05:32.470> more<00:05:32.590> of<00:05:32.830> a

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:32.890 
added to this to make it more of a

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:36.330 
added to this to make it more of a
graphic<00:05:33.370> for<00:05:33.610> a<00:05:33.640> shirt<00:05:33.940> so<00:05:34.620> once<00:05:35.620> I<00:05:35.740> have<00:05:35.980> the

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:36.340 
graphic for a shirt so once I have the

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.370 
graphic for a shirt so once I have the
design<00:05:36.880> finished<00:05:37.300> I<00:05:37.600> don't<00:05:38.020> know<00:05:38.080> if<00:05:38.170> you<00:05:38.260> guys

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:38.380 
design finished I don't know if you guys

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:40.760 
design finished I don't know if you guys
have<00:05:38.560> been<00:05:38.710> to<00:05:38.800> my<00:05:38.920> web<00:05:39.070> site<00:05:39.100> yet<00:05:39.580> but<00:05:39.880> it's

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:06.450 
cloth blends and the one I finally
decided<00:06:02.890> on<00:06:03.100> was<00:06:03.430> a<00:06:03.720> cotton<00:06:04.720> polyester<00:06:05.590> Ryland

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:06.460 
decided on was a cotton polyester Ryland

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.930 
decided on was a cotton polyester Ryland
blend<00:06:07.230> so<00:06:08.230> it's<00:06:08.380> really<00:06:08.620> lightweight<00:06:08.980> but

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:09.940 
blend so it's really lightweight but

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.800 
blend so it's really lightweight but
it's<00:06:10.930> pretty<00:06:11.320> well<00:06:11.620> fitted<00:06:12.130> shirt<00:06:12.490> so<00:06:13.360> that's

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:13.810 
it's pretty well fitted shirt so that's

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:15.840 
it's pretty well fitted shirt so that's
the<00:06:13.930> one<00:06:14.050> I<00:06:14.080> think<00:06:14.320> I'm<00:06:14.380> gonna<00:06:14.500> go<00:06:14.740> with<00:06:15.370> from

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:15.850 
the one I think I'm gonna go with from

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.850 
the one I think I'm gonna go with from
here<00:06:16.090> on<00:06:16.270> out<00:06:16.480> it's<00:06:16.840> kind<00:06:17.170> of<00:06:17.320> expensive

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:17.860 
here on out it's kind of expensive

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.730 
here on out it's kind of expensive
though<00:06:18.510> but<00:06:19.510> you<00:06:19.780> know<00:06:19.900> the<00:06:20.260> way<00:06:20.380> I<00:06:20.410> figure<00:06:20.530> it

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:20.740 
though but you know the way I figure it

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:22.530 
though but you know the way I figure it
is<00:06:20.920> a<00:06:21.160> lot<00:06:21.520> of<00:06:21.610> times<00:06:21.790> you'd<00:06:22.000> probably<00:06:22.180> pay

00:06:22.530 --> 00:06:22.540 
is a lot of times you'd probably pay

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:25.200 
is a lot of times you'd probably pay
something<00:06:23.020> similar<00:06:23.320> for<00:06:23.530> an<00:06:23.650> art<00:06:23.830> print<00:06:24.160> so<00:06:24.790> I

00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:25.210 
something similar for an art print so I

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:27.570 
something similar for an art print so I
the<00:06:25.960> whole<00:06:26.170> idea<00:06:26.530> behind<00:06:26.620> me<00:06:27.130> doing<00:06:27.280> this

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580 
the whole idea behind me doing this

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.760 
the whole idea behind me doing this
stuff<00:06:27.880> was<00:06:28.240> that<00:06:28.510> I<00:06:28.750> wanted<00:06:29.110> people<00:06:29.350> to<00:06:29.560> kind
