off of a 12 volts today and just to see
how<00:04:55.760> long<00:04:56.060> my<00:04:56.090> batteries<00:04:56.870> last<00:04:57.170> I<00:04:57.670> have<00:04:58.670> to

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
how long my batteries last I have to

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:03.340 
how long my batteries last I have to
deep<00:04:59.630> cycle<00:05:00.170> 12<00:05:00.500> volts<00:05:00.980> and<00:05:01.750> my<00:05:02.750> fridge<00:05:03.080> it

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
deep cycle 12 volts and my fridge it

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.620 
deep cycle 12 volts and my fridge it
runs<00:05:03.590> on<00:05:03.770> propane<00:05:04.010> I<00:05:04.640> guess<00:05:04.880> the<00:05:05.060> only<00:05:05.180> thing<00:05:05.300> I

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
runs on propane I guess the only thing I

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.760 
runs on propane I guess the only thing I
won't<00:05:06.050> be<00:05:06.320> able<00:05:06.410> to<00:05:06.650> use<00:05:06.950> is<00:05:07.840> my<00:05:08.840> microwave<00:05:11.770> but

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:12.770 
won't be able to use is my microwave but

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.710 
won't be able to use is my microwave but
everything<00:05:13.190> else<00:05:13.490> the<00:05:13.730> furnace<00:05:14.950> the<00:05:15.950> fridge

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:16.720 
everything else the furnace the fridge

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.090 
everything else the furnace the fridge
that<00:05:17.720> all<00:05:17.870> runs<00:05:18.170> off<00:05:18.470> of<00:05:18.500> 12<00:05:19.100> volt<00:05:19.460> and<00:05:19.820> and

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
that all runs off of 12 volt and and

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:25.630 
that all runs off of 12 volt and and
propane<00:05:22.100> and<00:05:22.510> my<00:05:23.510> ovens<00:05:23.960> propane<00:05:24.620> all<00:05:24.950> the

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
propane and my ovens propane all the

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.950 
propane and my ovens propane all the
lighting<00:05:25.910> is<00:05:26.240> 12<00:05:26.840> volt<00:05:28.450> yeah<00:05:29.450> I<00:05:29.570> think<00:05:29.780> I'll

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
lighting is 12 volt yeah I think I'll

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:33.700 
lighting is 12 volt yeah I think I'll
just<00:05:29.990> get<00:05:30.320> a<00:05:30.610> inverter<00:05:31.870> because<00:05:32.870> other<00:05:33.380> the

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:33.710 
just get a inverter because other the

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:39.270 
just get a inverter because other the
only<00:05:34.190> 110<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.730> actually<00:05:35.090> use<00:05:35.690> is<00:05:36.140> my<00:05:36.680> TV<00:05:38.200> the
