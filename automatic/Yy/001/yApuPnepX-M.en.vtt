00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.830
 We are here at the Samsung booth at the IFA and what I have here is the .. 

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:12.860
 Samsung Galaxy Note 3. Samsung Galaxy Note 3 is of course the successor of the 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.959
 well-known Note 2. 

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:18.769
 And as we are used to from Samsung, there are a number of small things .. 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:22.869
 improved again in the specifications. We will briefly show those specifications. 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.130
 And what I really want to show are really the special things that you .. 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.189
 looks on the outside and also in the software. 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.449
 Samsung that always fits quite a lot of plastic .. 

00:00:32.449 --> 00:00:35.140
 in its housing, its back is almost always made of plastic. 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.970
 You can have your opinion about that, maybe it's a bit cheap ... 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.040
 maybe it still has advantages or something. 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:43.300
 But this time they did it differently, now there is a very nice one .. 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.360
 a bit of a leathery layer over it ... 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.970
 with a stitching around it. 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.980
 That looks very good looking, it is a bit of a business device. 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.310
 For example, it looks a bit like the back that Blackberry often uses. 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.920
 What I find very unfortunate when I look at the edge around it .. 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.030
 I think that's really plastic with a bit of glass stuff. 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.220
 It really looks like a bit of fairground plastic. 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.480
 And that is a shame, because that looks a lot less good at once. 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.690
 They deliver it in three colors: white, pink and a black. 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.990
 By the way, I think with those light colors .. 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:20.040
 I really wonder a bit if that will stay nice in the long term. 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.900
 I think it gets dirty pretty quickly. 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.610
 An important development, the device has again become a lot thinner. 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:26.120
 But the battery has .. 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:31.320
 a higher capacity. That is actually pretty clever that they are in a somewhat more compact housing .. 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.180
 managed to cram a larger battery. 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.630
 Samsung has also incorporated a number of new things into the software. 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.520
 What we see here is a menu where you .. 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.800
 can see news things. It looks a bit like Flipboard to me. 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.200
 It also looks a bit like what you can bring to the attention of HTC .. 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.500
 And hey, it certainly looks good. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.750
 You can already use several apps at the same time on a regular smartphone, but you see .. 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.390
 always only one. 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:57.870
 With a certain update of the Galaxy Note 2 .. 

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.250
 they had changed that. You can also have several .. 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:03.060
 show apps on a screen even though it is a full screen. 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270
 For example at the top of a browser and .. 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:06.300
 at the bottom of a message screen. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:08.939
 That way you can look up something if you .. 

00:02:08.939 --> 00:02:12.319
 mess with someone. 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.109
 With this device, something else has been added. You can now also drag objects. 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:17.360
 For example if you have a .. 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.419
 message you are making and you want to add a photo to it .. 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.649
 then you can bring the gallery to the front and then you can drag a photo into it. 

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:28.389
 That is nice, just like with a normal computer where you can also drag objects. 

00:02:29.229 --> 00:02:33.159
 They have added something to it, you can now also open apps in a separate window .. 

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:38.459
 I already saw that with other competitors and here you do it with the S-pen. 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:41.349
 I have to say that goes a bit cumbersome. You have to do all kinds of actions .. 

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:45.319
 before you manage that and you can also give the screen a specific shape ... 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.539
 but then it looks a bit weird. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.619
 In short, I don't think that's super useful. 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:55.139
 Another addition is Samsung KNOX, which is now standard on these devices. 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:56.519
 With that you can a certain part of .. 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:02:59.189
 shield the device from another part. 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.179
 You can secure that extra and that is for example for business applications. 

00:03:03.179 --> 00:03:04.589
 quite handy. 

00:03:04.589 --> 00:03:08.269
 Unfortunately someone has already set up a password here and I don't know what it is .. 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.039
 so unfortunately I cannot show it. 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:14.889
 Conclusion: The Galaxy Note 3 is the next step in the evolution of the Note series. 

00:03:15.509 --> 00:03:18.719
 There are a number of meaningful improvements, 

00:03:18.719 --> 00:03:22.309
 there are a number of improvements that I think ... well, I don't know exactly what it is for you. 

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:25.339
 But all in all it is a very nice device. 

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:29.309
 We are going to review it even more extensively than this and we will of course also include it .. 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:31.079
 is our big comparative test. 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.790
 So keep following us and you will see it all appear on our website.
