lot of different prototypes went into
how<00:03:05.650> we<00:03:05.709> could<00:03:05.980> change<00:03:06.010> the<00:03:06.580> button<00:03:07.480> layout

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
how we could change the button layout

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:09.180 
how we could change the button layout
and<00:03:08.110> what<00:03:08.200> more<00:03:08.380> could<00:03:08.560> we<00:03:08.709> do<00:03:08.830> with<00:03:09.069> the

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.190 
and what more could we do with the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:10.470 
and what more could we do with the
guitar<00:03:09.520> we<00:03:09.819> were<00:03:09.910> kind<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.120> start<00:03:10.300> thinking

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
guitar we were kind of start thinking

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.550 
guitar we were kind of start thinking
about<00:03:10.540> you<00:03:10.660> know<00:03:10.720> if<00:03:10.780> somebody<00:03:11.080> does<00:03:11.290> air

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
about you know if somebody does air

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.730 
about you know if somebody does air
guitar<00:03:11.860> there<00:03:12.040> was<00:03:12.130> good<00:03:12.280> like<00:03:12.540> and<00:03:13.560> this<00:03:14.560> is

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
guitar there was good like and this is

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:15.930 
guitar there was good like and this is
strumming<00:03:15.160> and<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.430> hand<00:03:15.640> they're<00:03:15.790> doing

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:15.940 
strumming and this hand they're doing

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:17.670 
strumming and this hand they're doing
something<00:03:16.180> like<00:03:16.300> this<00:03:16.660> we<00:03:17.110> wanted<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.470> try<00:03:17.650> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
something like this we wanted to try and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.550 
something like this we wanted to try and
give<00:03:18.370> you<00:03:18.459> something<00:03:18.670> to<00:03:18.760> do<00:03:18.880> this<00:03:19.180> hand<00:03:19.560> which

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
give you something to do this hand which

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.140 
give you something to do this hand which
felt<00:03:20.830> a<00:03:21.130> bit<00:03:21.430> more<00:03:21.610> like<00:03:21.790> playing<00:03:22.030> the<00:03:22.090> guitar

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
felt a bit more like playing the guitar

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.330 
felt a bit more like playing the guitar
again<00:03:22.660> but<00:03:22.840> was<00:03:22.930> still<00:03:23.140> fun<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:23.860> we<00:03:23.980> have<00:03:24.100> a<00:03:24.130> new

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
again but was still fun so we have a new

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.490 
again but was still fun so we have a new
button<00:03:24.550> configuration<00:03:25.360> with<00:03:25.630> three<00:03:26.200> buttons

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:26.500 
button configuration with three buttons

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:27.990 
button configuration with three buttons
along<00:03:26.709> the<00:03:26.770> top<00:03:26.920> and<00:03:27.280> three<00:03:27.400> buttons<00:03:27.640> along

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
along the top and three buttons along

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.790 
along the top and three buttons along
the<00:03:28.060> bottom<00:03:28.270> now<00:03:28.900> you<00:03:28.930> can<00:03:29.320> keep<00:03:29.470> three

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:29.800 
the bottom now you can keep three

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.260 
the bottom now you can keep three
fingers<00:03:30.160> in<00:03:30.280> place<00:03:30.489> but<00:03:30.670> you<00:03:30.760> can<00:03:30.910> move<00:03:31.030> up<00:03:31.150> and

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:31.270 
fingers in place but you can move up and

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:32.550 
fingers in place but you can move up and
down<00:03:31.480> you<00:03:31.690> can<00:03:31.750> start<00:03:31.989> to<00:03:32.110> create<00:03:32.230> chord

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
down you can start to create chord

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.949 
down you can start to create chord
shapes<00:03:32.860> and<00:03:33.190> it<00:03:33.760> starts<00:03:34.330> to<00:03:34.420> feel<00:03:34.660> way<00:03:34.930> more

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
shapes and it starts to feel way more

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.199 
shapes and it starts to feel way more
cos<00:03:35.410> it<00:03:35.980> also<00:03:36.160> gives<00:03:36.580> it<00:03:36.730> a<00:03:36.760> little<00:03:36.850> bit<00:03:37.060> more

00:03:37.199 --> 00:03:37.209 
cos it also gives it a little bit more

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:38.820 
cos it also gives it a little bit more
depth<00:03:37.480> to<00:03:37.630> people<00:03:37.989> that<00:03:38.140> played<00:03:38.320> on<00:03:38.350> medium

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
depth to people that played on medium

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:40.380 
depth to people that played on medium
level<00:03:39.130> because<00:03:39.459> you're<00:03:39.910> not<00:03:39.970> having<00:03:40.120> to<00:03:40.269> use

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:40.390 
level because you're not having to use

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.240 
level because you're not having to use
your<00:03:40.540> pinky<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:40.989> get<00:03:41.230> lost<00:03:41.470> which<00:03:41.860> is<00:03:42.010> what<00:03:42.130> we

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
your pinky and get lost which is what we

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.710 
your pinky and get lost which is what we
saw<00:03:42.430> a<00:03:42.459> lot<00:03:42.700> of<00:03:42.820> our<00:03:42.970> players<00:03:43.510> were<00:03:43.630> getting

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
saw a lot of our players were getting

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.750 
saw a lot of our players were getting
lost<00:03:43.959> with<00:03:44.200> in<00:03:44.320> some<00:03:44.500> ways<00:03:44.650> it's<00:03:44.890> it's<00:03:45.430> easier

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
lost with in some ways it's it's easier

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.100 
lost with in some ways it's it's easier
in<00:03:45.910> some<00:03:46.030> ways<00:03:46.209> it's<00:03:46.390> harder<00:03:46.630> and<00:03:46.780> then<00:03:46.870> on<00:03:46.959> top

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:47.110 
in some ways it's harder and then on top

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:49.229 
in some ways it's harder and then on top
of<00:03:47.170> that<00:03:47.290> for<00:03:47.769> expert<00:03:48.100> players<00:03:48.340> there's<00:03:49.060> way

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:49.239 
of that for expert players there's way

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.640 
of that for expert players there's way
more<00:03:49.269> button<00:03:49.660> configurations<00:03:50.350> and<00:03:50.560> it

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
more button configurations and it

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.210 
more button configurations and it
becomes<00:03:50.950> a<00:03:51.070> lot<00:03:51.220> harder<00:03:51.280> at<00:03:51.760> the<00:03:51.850> top<00:03:52.030> in<00:03:53.220> the

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
becomes a lot harder at the top in the

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.670 
becomes a lot harder at the top in the
gh<00:03:54.519> live<00:03:54.730> and<00:03:54.940> with<00:03:55.060> gh<00:03:55.269> TV<00:03:55.630> we've<00:03:55.870> got<00:03:56.050> a<00:03:56.290> real

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
gh live and with gh TV we've got a real

00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.560 
gh live and with gh TV we've got a real
breakthrough<00:03:56.950> and<00:03:57.400> in<00:03:57.880> pretty<00:03:58.239> much<00:03:58.330> in

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
breakthrough and in pretty much in

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.030 
breakthrough and in pretty much in
gaming<00:03:58.870> and<00:03:59.019> we're<00:03:59.140> really<00:03:59.470> looking<00:03:59.650> forward

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040
