displace<00:01:37.060> here's<00:01:38.060> the<00:01:38.180> UNSC<00:01:38.960> one<00:01:39.790> there<00:01:40.790> is<00:01:40.970> a

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:41.000 
displace here's the UNSC one there is a

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.249 
displace here's the UNSC one there is a
covenant<00:01:41.329> one<00:01:41.750> I<00:01:41.960> think<00:01:42.439> the<00:01:42.939> UNSC<00:01:44.259> weapons

00:01:45.249 --> 00:01:45.259 
covenant one I think the UNSC weapons

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:47.770 
covenant one I think the UNSC weapons
display<00:01:45.710> is<00:01:46.070> an<00:01:46.579> improvement<00:01:46.969> over<00:01:47.450> the

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
display is an improvement over the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.569 
display is an improvement over the
original<00:01:48.110> one<00:01:49.990> but<00:01:50.990> honestly<00:01:51.350> the<00:01:51.829> Covenant

00:01:52.569 --> 00:01:52.579 
original one but honestly the Covenant

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:56.859 
original one but honestly the Covenant
one<00:01:53.420> is<00:01:53.750> kind<00:01:54.530> of<00:01:54.729> boring<00:01:55.729> actually<00:01:56.060> kind<00:01:56.810> of

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
one is kind of boring actually kind of

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.359 
one is kind of boring actually kind of
like<00:01:57.079> the<00:01:57.729> original<00:01:58.729> weapons<00:01:59.060> pack<00:01:59.299> display

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
like the original weapons pack display

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.950 
like the original weapons pack display
better<00:02:01.369> although<00:02:01.640> even<00:02:02.090> that<00:02:02.240> one<00:02:02.600> really

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:02.960 
better although even that one really

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.490 
better although even that one really
wasn't<00:02:03.530> all<00:02:03.649> that<00:02:03.710> exciting<00:02:04.700> but<00:02:05.539> the<00:02:05.780> UNSC

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
wasn't all that exciting but the UNSC

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.060 
wasn't all that exciting but the UNSC
one<00:02:06.680> is<00:02:06.890> actually<00:02:07.340> really<00:02:07.610> cool<00:02:07.880> I<00:02:08.890> like<00:02:09.890> that
