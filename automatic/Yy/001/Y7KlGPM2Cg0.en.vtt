snapchatted<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.680> video<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.100> like<00:01:53.310> the<00:01:53.460> XP

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
snapchatted a video of like the XP

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.690 
snapchatted a video of like the XP
glitch<00:01:53.850> and<00:01:54.920> they<00:01:55.920> didn't<00:01:56.190> know<00:01:56.250> how<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.400> do<00:01:56.610> it
