00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 the controversies that followed 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.130
 warn your kitchen of the side of the bone 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:10.920
 on the side of the meat 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:14.490
 we have a thick part and then 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:17.420
 we have two to pass the test and the 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.420
 cooking what we're going to do 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.609
 the results cut 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.740
 by tevez 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:36.460
 the side of the bone here will lower the 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.460
 most of the time 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.050
 above 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.410
 we go to trees 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.790
 well first we take the strip that 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.610
 we cook from the side of the web 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.420
 that is, at first the 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.479
 We put the side of the bone 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:11.670
 that is let's rest for five minutes 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.290
 on a table so that the 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:15.720
 liquids and now we are going to cut 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 Now let's try and then we'll try 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:22.190
 the other to close with the verdict 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:25.640
 end is quite legs well cooked 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:28.930
 to the judges I told them what talk 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.930
 it's cooked loose 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:42.470
 is the one that was made with the garden for 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.470
 up first the traditional method 

00:01:42.619 --> 00:01:48.590
 just as cooked, keep in mind that 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.590
 a little 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.369
 now we are going to distribute it 

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:02.720
 this has many clues 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.209
 they were both good on the side of 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:22.019
 the rib was more crispy the other 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:23.990
 I was juicier and more tender so 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:26.600
 it's a matter of taste 

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:29.450
 Band-aid cooked in the traditional way 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.300
 It was very rich but it was much more 

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:35.710
 rich the kitchen the other way and I think 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.710
 that everything depends on Havana 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.370
 I clearly like option 2 better 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:48.770
 in 100% mystery so we're going to 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.240
 have to do two ribs at the same time 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.140
 one on the bone side and one on the other 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:53.140
 side we will expand
