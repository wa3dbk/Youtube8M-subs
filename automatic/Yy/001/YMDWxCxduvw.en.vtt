00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.390
 well 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:10.069
 Tomorrow it is decided 

00:00:10.069 --> 00:00:13.199
 Picture Citydeal 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:16.199
 everything balanced again 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
 and he too fails Uli Stein 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.480
 he becomes the hero of the evening 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.400
 the shooter to the 2 0 0 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.270
 5 too much for the HSV 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.280
 no repetition 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 It was too early for the wrong corner decided 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.410
 the new branch 

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.410
 no problem and now the burden is on 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.860
 he closes the Hamburg sports club wanted a round 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.820
 15 4 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.820
 for the hamburger 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.600
 and he does that as a mature player 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.600
 the Rotterdam 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:08.689
 And now Nick has it 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:11.029
 in the foot 

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:12.319
 the HSV 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.319
 again the repetition 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.579
 now it's up to him 

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:19.749
 in the foot 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.749
 to protect the HSV in the second round 

00:02:39.669 --> 00:02:42.669
 15 fifth game was 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:49.969
 he closes 

00:02:49.969 --> 00:02:53.289
 Nolte money 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:56.289
 Matic shoots 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.369
 There's a little nothing out there from the goalkeeper 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.369
 because thanks 

00:03:05.029 --> 00:03:08.389
 Throw questions 

00:03:08.389 --> 00:03:09.869
 Now it went on 

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:12.869
 until the decision 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:17.989
 what have been newly chosen 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:22.539
 next shooter 

00:03:22.539 --> 00:03:24.749
 Berlin 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.749
 for athletes 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:40.609
 6 to 5 for athletes 

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.049
 now the burden weighs on Michael Schröder 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.049
 because if he shoots now is the end of the HSV 

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:58.619
 would be eliminated 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:02.609
 he has achieved the once symbol 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:07.549
 Sven Appel 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.549
 Apple go up 

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:17.849
 and that was it 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.079
 for the HSV the asphalt is eliminated 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:23.159
 Cheers, of course, in the race 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:26.229
 Amsterdam player Rotterdam players 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.659
 with the fans 

00:04:27.659 --> 00:04:30.659
 the HSV is outside 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.490
 you will have to get used to it 

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:36.009
 that this team 

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:38.289
 not only in the Bundesliga 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:41.729
 mediocre in Europe 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.110
 she did not make it 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.439
 Michael Schröder 

00:04:46.439 --> 00:04:49.439
 there can be a pain 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:54.479
 once again this penalty 

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.680
 one can only hope that the young man 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:58.879
 on this penalty 

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:01.759
 did not cheer too long to cheer 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:04.289
 Wai Sparta Rotterdam 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:05.999
 the entourage tendered out 

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:08.659
 Sparta Rotterdam reached the second round 

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:11.659
 and thus sent back to Oskar Wark 

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:16.779
 Penalties can by Matti 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:20.729
 and this particular penalty shootout Sophie Bissingen Hamburg im 

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:24.899
 Volksparkstadion saw Bully Stein hold the goalkeeper of Hamburger 2 

00:05:24.899 --> 00:05:25.669
 game 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.270
 Penalties are not penalties two penalties but that's not enough 

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:34.330
 Coach Ernst Happel Spiel describes this «That same also not the 

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:35.400
 Defeat too 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:37.339
 he says we had chances enough 

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:39.430
 for the penalty shootout 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.230
 to prevent him there may be right but that the quota at the moment like Michael 

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:47.460
 Palm already told him about strengthening or lacking strength 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:50.850
