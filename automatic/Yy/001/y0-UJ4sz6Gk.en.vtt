00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.390
 hallokchen my dear I was after 

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.040
 my last romantic look video often 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.780
 asked by you if you are in this blog 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.430
 also in lightroom can create 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.680
 and I wanted you now a 

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.630
 possibility show the exact actually 

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:16.219
 That's how it works. I wanted to 

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:17.510
 directly at the sebastian thank it 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:21.710
 was in fact a participant in one of 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:22.789
 my workshop in MÃ¼nster and up to 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.400
 this time I was also the 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.890
 opinion it is only in line photoshop 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:29.150
 because I just do not go here in line 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.400
 also did not know exactly how to do that 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:33.200
 just now surrounded but he has me 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.790
 It is also possible and that's why 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.530
 I'm not depriving you of that 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:38.870
 it really works the same way as in 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.700
 That's why I just want photoshop for you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.380
 just show where you 're doing it easy 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.210
 show the corresponding effect 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.190
 I'm also very thankful 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.690
 just faster if you do not 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.579
 absolutely want to switch to photoshop 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.050
 that's probably what makes it easier 

00:00:49.579 --> 00:00:51.820
 one or the other of you then too 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.219
 the work 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:56.120
 you see right here in the develop mode 

00:00:55.219 --> 00:00:58.780
 i have a picture from the last 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.579
 workshop with the fantastic selected 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:03.260
 you see scrolling down right here 

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.259
 at the settings the charta zions 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.270
 curves here, too, you see 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.459
 Escalation course here always there he sees 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.429
 These curve lights are bright medium tones 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:14.749
 dark medium tones and deep 

00:01:12.429 --> 00:01:16.549
 and there are the colors in the 

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:20.020
 Change color channels by clicking here 

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:24.409
 press this little curve down here 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:26.779
 then you see here at channel red green 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.060
 blue is exactly the same as with 

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:31.189
 photoshop at gradation schopen there 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.590
 I'll go blue at first 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.289
 bit up then everyone goes 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.520
 green pushed a bit up and 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:42.459
 the same I'm doing again in red 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:44.179
 and then you already see the look 

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:45.919
 that it is a beautiful romantic 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:51.310
 warm look I'll show you that 

00:01:45.919 --> 00:01:53.179
 Now again in the before after mode 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.979
 Here you see again indirectly 

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:56.209
 difference what happened when I 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.450
 Now a little more red in 

00:01:56.209 --> 00:02:01.969
 pull on the right side you see what 

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.439
 I change the look because you just have to 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:04.639
 decide for you how much red you 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.840
 want to move in or maybe 

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:08.030
 you also like another color 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.850
 better but you can do tons right 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.160
 nice that was too much really nice 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.990
 create a romantic look 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:19.040
 By the way, if you go in the other direction 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.390
 pulls or even sets a point there 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.800
 you can also very funny effects 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.120
 achieve and even with the colors 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.610
 For example , you can play here 

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:27.500
 The color changes from the top part 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.760
 So you can also get two points here 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.520
 put on the curves or three or 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.630
 Four not just one that is you 

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.400
 you should just try one 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:37.490
 a little bit of rum to try is also in 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:40.660
 Photoshop with the several points around 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:43.340
 here simply to produce certain lux 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.570
 I hope this tip had one or 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.700
 others might just feel sorry for you 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.350
 Works on brought and I wish 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.040
 Have fun trying it out now 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.040
 until then
