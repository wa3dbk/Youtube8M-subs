00:01:24.529 --> 00:01:24.539 
transmission shifts and we have the

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:25.850 
transmission shifts and we have the
exhaust<00:01:24.840> which<00:01:25.200> I<00:01:25.320> already<00:01:25.409> showed<00:01:25.649> you<00:01:25.770> in

inches you can see the wheelbase is a

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:38.660 
inches you can see the wheelbase is a
lot<00:01:33.570> smaller<00:01:33.899> than<00:01:33.960> a<00:01:34.109> normal<00:01:34.170> focus
