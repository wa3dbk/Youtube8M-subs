00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hey guys Sam from collision consultants

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.450 
hey guys Sam from collision consultants
again<00:00:03.570> so<00:00:03.980> taking<00:00:04.980> on<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.100> little<00:00:05.250> project

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
again so taking on a little project

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.419 
again so taking on a little project
about<00:00:05.940> to<00:00:06.089> paint<00:00:06.299> these<00:00:06.509> wheels<00:00:07.189> flat<00:00:08.189> black

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
about to paint these wheels flat black

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.470 
about to paint these wheels flat black
there<00:00:08.760> came<00:00:09.290> silver<00:00:10.290> I<00:00:10.969> think<00:00:11.969> the<00:00:12.030> trick<00:00:12.330> to

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
there came silver I think the trick to

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.509 
there came silver I think the trick to
this<00:00:12.599> job<00:00:12.900> is<00:00:13.110> going<00:00:13.230> to<00:00:13.290> be<00:00:13.349> masking<00:00:14.009> those

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
this job is going to be masking those

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.189 
this job is going to be masking those
little<00:00:14.820> center<00:00:15.120> caps<00:00:15.890> fly<00:00:16.890> over<00:00:17.130> there

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:18.199 
little center caps fly over there

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:23.359 
little center caps fly over there
so<00:00:20.930> painting<00:00:21.930> a<00:00:22.109> wheel<00:00:22.560> it's<00:00:22.740> already<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> pin

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
so painting a wheel it's already the pin

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.370 
so painting a wheel it's already the pin
is<00:00:23.490> really<00:00:23.730> easy<00:00:23.939> no<00:00:24.359> special<00:00:24.750> primers<00:00:25.170> no

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
is really easy no special primers no

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.870 
is really easy no special primers no
etching<00:00:25.710> primers<00:00:26.070> at<00:00:26.220> boxing<00:00:26.519> nothing

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
etching primers at boxing nothing

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.640 
etching primers at boxing nothing
basically<00:00:27.689> just<00:00:27.840> going<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.019> sand<00:00:28.260> down<00:00:28.320> this

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
basically just going to sand down this

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:31.130 
basically just going to sand down this
paint<00:00:28.920> there<00:00:29.429> are<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> few<00:00:30.000> runs<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:30.660> whoever

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
paint there are a few runs in whoever

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.510 
paint there are a few runs in whoever
painted<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.619> before<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.009> don't<00:00:32.160> know<00:00:32.279> you<00:00:32.399> can

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
painted it before I don't know you can

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:33.920 
painted it before I don't know you can
see<00:00:32.640> it<00:00:32.700> in<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.850> video<00:00:33.120> few<00:00:33.780> little

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
see it in the video few little

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:35.209

a little bit do a better job than the
people<00:00:37.380> who<00:00:37.500> made<00:00:37.649> the<00:00:37.770> wheels<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:39.230> get<00:00:40.230> it

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
people who made the wheels and get it

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.479 
people who made the wheels and get it
ready<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.500> go<00:00:40.590> then<00:00:40.890> we'll<00:00:40.950> paint<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:41.280> with<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
ready to go then we'll paint it with the

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
figured since we got the wheels off us

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.619 
figured since we got the wheels off us
and<00:00:48.510> the<00:00:48.750> car<00:00:49.170> over<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.800> globe<00:00:50.550> tire<00:00:50.820> have<00:00:51.360> them

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
everything and send it off to the tire

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.470 
everything and send it off to the tire
shop<00:01:37.660> have<00:01:38.200> them<00:01:38.620> mount<00:01:39.490> and<00:01:39.700> balance<00:01:39.850> the

shop have them mount and balance the

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.800 
shop have them mount and balance the
tires<00:01:41.910> you'll<00:01:42.910> notice<00:01:43.180> the<00:01:43.300> machine<00:01:43.630> they<00:01:43.780> use

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
tires you'll notice the machine they use

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.580 
tires you'll notice the machine they use
it<00:01:44.350> doesn't<00:01:45.340> actually<00:01:45.580> touch<00:01:45.970> the<00:01:46.210> wheel<00:01:46.590> so

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:47.590 
it doesn't actually touch the wheel so

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.219 
it doesn't actually touch the wheel so
it<00:01:47.860> you<00:01:48.280> know<00:01:48.310> further<00:01:48.850> protects<00:01:49.300> the<00:01:49.510> freshly

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
it you know further protects the freshly

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.650 
it you know further protects the freshly
painted<00:01:51.190> wheels<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:54.180> give<00:01:55.180> it<00:01:55.300> one<00:01:55.450> last

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:55.660 
painted wheels and give it one last

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.660 
painted wheels and give it one last
twirl<00:01:56.080> and<00:01:56.380> get<00:01:57.130> the<00:01:57.250> tires<00:01:57.460> mounted<00:01:57.759> on<00:01:59.670> one

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
twirl and get the tires mounted on one

twirl and get the tires mounted on one
thing<00:02:00.850> we<00:02:01.000> were<00:02:01.119> always<00:02:01.240> worried<00:02:01.690> about<00:02:01.750> in

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
thing we were always worried about in

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.270 
thing we were always worried about in
this<00:02:02.140> project<00:02:02.680> is<00:02:02.860> that<00:02:03.040> the<00:02:03.280> lug<00:02:03.880> bolts<00:02:04.479> are

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
this project is that the lug bolts are

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.719 
this project is that the lug bolts are
really<00:02:06.280> rusted<00:02:06.759> and<00:02:06.790> ugly<00:02:07.180> looking<00:02:07.540> so<00:02:08.729> before

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:09.729 
really rusted and ugly looking so before

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.870 
really rusted and ugly looking so before
we<00:02:09.850> put<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.149> wheels<00:02:10.360> and<00:02:10.660> tires<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.140> the<00:02:11.260> car

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
we put the wheels and tires on the car

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.670 
we put the wheels and tires on the car
went<00:02:12.880> out<00:02:13.000> and<00:02:13.150> bought<00:02:13.300> a<00:02:13.360> set<00:02:13.780> of<00:02:13.959> caps<00:02:14.320> that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680 
went out and bought a set of caps that

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.190 
went out and bought a set of caps that
fit<00:02:15.010> right<00:02:15.250> over<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.730> Faculty<00:02:16.180> factory<00:02:16.930> lug
