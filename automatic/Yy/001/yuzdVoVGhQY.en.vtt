and someone else the guitar but I really

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:41.720 
and someone else the guitar but I really
loved<00:00:40.500> it<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:40.679> I<00:00:40.769> kind<00:00:40.980> of<00:00:41.039> had<00:00:41.219> it<00:00:41.250> in<00:00:41.429> my<00:00:41.519> head

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
loved it and I kind of had it in my head

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.880 
loved it and I kind of had it in my head
and<00:00:42.030> I<00:00:42.120> went<00:00:42.269> home<00:00:42.539> and<00:00:42.840> it<00:00:43.079> haunted<00:00:43.500> me<00:00:43.620> and<00:00:43.649> so

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
and I went home and it haunted me and so

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.529 
and I went home and it haunted me and so
finally<00:00:44.160> I<00:00:44.250> got<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.429> bass<00:00:44.670> out<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.059> what

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
finally I got my bass out and what

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
finally I got my bass out and what
resulted<00:00:46.019> was<00:00:46.170> my<00:00:46.350> version<00:00:46.410> of<00:00:46.980> this<00:00:47.160> which

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
resulted was my version of this which

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.630 
resulted was my version of this which
probably<00:00:48.809> is<00:00:48.960> not<00:00:49.710> at<00:00:49.890> all<00:00:50.010> close<00:00:50.309> to<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
probably is not at all close to the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.549 
probably is not at all close to the
original<00:00:51.030> but<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.750> was<00:00:51.899> kind<00:00:52.079> of<00:00:52.109> cool<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.350> come

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
original but it was kind of cool to come

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.319 
original but it was kind of cool to come
up<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.890> let<00:00:53.309> me<00:00:53.339> show<00:00:53.550> you<00:00:53.609> how<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.879> goes

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
up with let me show you how it goes

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.500 
up with let me show you how it goes
so<00:00:54.839> it<00:00:55.109> starts<00:00:55.499> with<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:56.010> tap<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.519> the<00:00:56.760> 17th<00:00:57.329> fret

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
so it starts with a tap on the 17th fret

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.110 
so it starts with a tap on the 17th fret
of<00:00:57.839> the<00:00:57.870> g<00:00:58.079> string<00:00:58.109> and<00:00:58.769> you're<00:00:59.730> gonna<00:00:59.850> pull

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
of the g string and you're gonna pull

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.259 
of the g string and you're gonna pull
off<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.659> 12th<00:01:01.079> fret<00:01:01.370> g<00:01:02.370> on<00:01:02.879> the<00:01:02.940> g<00:01:03.239> string

00:01:03.259 --> 00:01:03.269 
off to the 12th fret g on the g string

00:01:03.269 --> 00:01:05.630 
off to the 12th fret g on the g string
this<00:01:04.140> finger<00:01:04.559> I<00:01:04.620> never<00:01:04.860> left<00:01:05.129> there's<00:01:05.519> no

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
this finger I never left there's no

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.330 
this finger I never left there's no
reason<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.300> also<00:01:06.450> keeps<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.050> note<00:01:07.500> or

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
reason to it also keeps that note or

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.160 
reason to it also keeps that note or
that<00:01:08.640> whole<00:01:08.820> string<00:01:09.090> very<00:01:09.360> quiet<00:01:09.750> when<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
that whole string very quiet when it's

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:13.580 
that whole string very quiet when it's
not<00:01:10.320> in<00:01:10.470> use<00:01:10.500> so<00:01:11.190> the<00:01:11.310> first<00:01:11.520> pattern<00:01:11.790> is<00:01:12.210> 17<00:01:13.170> 12

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
not in use so the first pattern is 17 12

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.960 
not in use so the first pattern is 17 12
14<00:01:14.550> so<00:01:14.970> you<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.270> practice<00:01:15.570> that<00:01:16.850> that's<00:01:17.850> a

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
14 so you just practice that that's a

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.540 
14 so you just practice that that's a
triplet<00:01:18.360> one<00:01:18.570> in<00:01:18.750> two<00:01:19.080> minutes

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
triplet one in two minutes

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.970 
triplet one in two minutes
now<00:01:21.120> that's<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.780> first<00:01:21.810> beat<00:01:22.260> the<00:01:22.470> second

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:22.980 
now that's the first beat the second

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:23.360 
now that's the first beat the second
beat

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:23.370 
beat

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:25.790 
beat
I<00:01:23.400> leave<00:01:23.880> my<00:01:24.060> finger<00:01:24.720> there<00:01:24.930> but<00:01:25.350> I<00:01:25.380> tapped<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:25.800 
I leave my finger there but I tapped the

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.000 
I leave my finger there but I tapped the
15th<00:01:26.400> fret<00:01:26.670> on<00:01:26.910> the<00:01:27.300> D<00:01:27.600> string<00:01:27.630> and<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.620> pull<00:01:28.890> off

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:29.010 
15th fret on the D string and I pull off

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.950 
15th fret on the D string and I pull off
to<00:01:29.190> an<00:01:29.310> open<00:01:29.760> D

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
to an open D

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.340 
to an open D
and<00:01:31.200> I<00:01:31.380> hammer<00:01:31.590> on<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.940> 14th<00:01:33.390> fret<00:01:33.540> a<00:01:33.810> on<00:01:34.230> the

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and I hammer on the 14th fret a on the

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.760 
and I hammer on the 14th fret a on the
g-string

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
g-string

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:39.980 
g-string
I<00:01:37.880> like<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.000> because<00:01:39.120> it<00:01:39.300> really<00:01:39.330> extends

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I like that because it really extends

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.410 
I like that because it really extends
the<00:01:40.140> the<00:01:40.380> range<00:01:40.650> of<00:01:41.040> the<00:01:41.460> melody<00:01:41.820> and<00:01:41.880> goes<00:01:42.120> way

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the the range of the melody and goes way

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.200 
the the range of the melody and goes way
low<00:01:42.750> but<00:01:43.290> I'm<00:01:43.380> still<00:01:43.650> up<00:01:43.800> here<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.340> honestly

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
low but I'm still up here and honestly

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:50.390 
low but I'm still up here and honestly
that's<00:01:45.930> the<00:01:46.170> first<00:01:46.380> two<00:01:46.500> beats<00:01:48.110> now<00:01:49.110> then<00:01:49.620> you

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:50.400 
that's the first two beats now then you

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.040 
that's the first two beats now then you
do<00:01:50.580> a<00:01:50.610> little<00:01:51.060> variation<00:01:51.240> where<00:01:51.750> you<00:01:51.840> choose

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:52.050 
do a little variation where you choose

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:57.080 
do a little variation where you choose
you<00:01:52.320> go<00:01:52.470> back<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.800> the<00:01:52.920> 17<00:01:53.430> 12<00:01:53.760> 14<00:01:55.130> 1912<00:01:56.130> 14<00:01:56.760> so

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
you go back to the 17 12 14 1912 14 so

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:01.940 
you go back to the 17 12 14 1912 14 so
that<00:01:57.270> would<00:01:57.420> sound<00:01:57.540> like<00:01:57.660> this<00:02:00.770> pretty<00:02:01.770> simple

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:01.950 
that would sound like this pretty simple

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.310 
that would sound like this pretty simple
and<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.090> just<00:02:03.300> all<00:02:03.420> tastes<00:02:03.690> back<00:02:03.869> and<00:02:04.110> forth

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
and that just all tastes back and forth

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:05.540 
and that just all tastes back and forth
