because it's one of the basic most basic
tutorials<00:00:22.550> around<00:00:23.000> so<00:00:23.720> basically<00:00:24.169> we<00:00:24.980> all

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:25.130 
tutorials around so basically we all

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.099 
tutorials around so basically we all
know<00:00:25.250> the<00:00:25.310> motions<00:00:25.760> of<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.000> step-over<00:00:26.420> how<00:00:26.960> it

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:27.109 
know the motions of the step-over how it

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.660 
know the motions of the step-over how it
is<00:00:27.230> done<00:00:27.500> left<00:00:27.890> to<00:00:28.039> right<00:00:28.220> right<00:00:28.250> to<00:00:28.490> left

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
is done left to right right to left

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.380 
is done left to right right to left
however<00:00:30.460> what<00:00:31.460> you<00:00:31.609> can<00:00:31.789> do<00:00:31.910> is<00:00:32.059> once<00:00:32.239> you're

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
however what you can do is once you're

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.030 
however what you can do is once you're
practicing<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.960> gun<00:00:33.140> to<00:00:33.350> enhance<00:00:33.710> and

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:34.040 
practicing the gun to enhance and

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.700 
practicing the gun to enhance and
improve<00:00:34.160> it<00:00:34.879> not<00:00:35.449> only<00:00:35.840> will<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.140> be<00:00:36.170> just

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:36.710 
improve it not only will you be just

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.020 
improve it not only will you be just
doing<00:00:36.949> step<00:00:37.160> overs<00:00:37.400> on<00:00:37.489> the<00:00:37.580> gun<00:00:37.730> it<00:00:37.910> also

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
doing step overs on the gun it also

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.119 
doing step overs on the gun it also
works<00:00:38.360> your<00:00:38.510> thigh<00:00:38.809> muscles<00:00:39.320> to<00:00:39.470> calf<00:00:39.650> muscles

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
works your thigh muscles to calf muscles

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.700 
works your thigh muscles to calf muscles
basically<00:00:40.640> from<00:00:40.820> bomb<00:00:41.120> -<00:00:41.360> the<00:00:41.390> bomb<00:00:41.540> down<00:00:42.320> it's

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
basically from bomb - the bomb down it's

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.270 
basically from bomb - the bomb down it's
very<00:00:43.070> it<00:00:43.700> works<00:00:43.969> your<00:00:44.180> muscles<00:00:44.739> honestly<00:00:45.739> so

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:46.280 
very it works your muscles honestly so

out<00:01:02.210> a<00:01:02.270> lot<00:01:02.390> of<00:01:02.420> energy<00:01:02.600> out<00:01:02.930> of<00:01:02.960> you<00:01:03.140> and<00:01:03.289> tie

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
out a lot of energy out of you and tie

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.310

your<00:01:04.009> muscles<00:01:04.489> as<00:01:04.670> everyone<00:01:05.180> knows<00:01:05.210> but<00:01:05.539> the

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
your muscles as everyone knows but the

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:08.020 
your muscles as everyone knows but the
thing<00:01:06.619> with<00:01:06.770> stepovers<00:01:07.039> is<00:01:07.310> they<00:01:07.700> can<00:01:07.910> be

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:08.030 
thing with stepovers is they can be

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.820 
thing with stepovers is they can be
useful<00:01:08.509> as<00:01:08.630> well<00:01:08.660> it's<00:01:09.020> not<00:01:09.050> necessarily<00:01:09.259> the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
useful as well it's not necessarily the

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.950 
useful as well it's not necessarily the
trick<00:01:10.100> to<00:01:10.190> show<00:01:10.220> off<00:01:10.550> with<00:01:10.729> here<00:01:11.060> I<00:01:11.210> do<00:01:11.539> one

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
trick to show off with here I do one

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.290 
trick to show off with here I do one
step<00:01:12.289> over<00:01:12.470> and<00:01:12.800> I<00:01:13.069> use<00:01:13.399> the<00:01:13.520> Iniesta<00:01:13.970> move<00:01:14.149> you

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
step over and I use the Iniesta move you

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.510 
step over and I use the Iniesta move you
can<00:01:14.450> actually<00:01:14.660> add<00:01:14.990> stuff<00:01:15.530> to<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:16.160> step<00:01:16.399> over

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
can actually add stuff to the step over

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.580 
can actually add stuff to the step over
that<00:01:16.819> actually<00:01:17.179> helps<00:01:17.509> you<00:01:17.630> it<00:01:17.810> really<00:01:18.440> does

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:18.590 
that actually helps you it really does

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.900 
that actually helps you it really does
improve<00:01:18.740> your<00:01:19.039> dribbling<00:01:19.190> in<00:01:19.459> a<00:01:19.550> way<00:01:19.640> it<00:01:19.759> also

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:19.910 
improve your dribbling in a way it also

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.120 
improve your dribbling in a way it also
it<00:01:20.360> can<00:01:20.509> be<00:01:20.630> used<00:01:20.840> effectively<00:01:21.349> for<00:01:21.709> a<00:01:21.890> pass

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
it can be used effectively for a pass

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.249 
it can be used effectively for a pass
like<00:01:22.369> here<00:01:22.550> look<00:01:22.670> at<00:01:22.789> this<00:01:22.849> one<00:01:23.209> two<00:01:23.509> one<00:01:24.229> two

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
like here look at this one two one two

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.719 
like here look at this one two one two
one<00:01:25.280> pass<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.209> I<00:01:26.990> feel<00:01:27.679> it<00:01:27.920> buys<00:01:28.220> you<00:01:28.429> a<00:01:28.459> bit<00:01:28.640> of

one pass it I feel it buys you a bit of

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:30.669 
one pass it I feel it buys you a bit of
time<00:01:28.940> as<00:01:29.119> well<00:01:29.270> if<00:01:29.479> you<00:01:29.660> can<00:01:29.840> master<00:01:30.289> the<00:01:30.440> step

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
time as well if you can master the step

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.080 
time as well if you can master the step
overs<00:01:30.979> when<00:01:31.160> you<00:01:31.250> don't<00:01:31.399> even<00:01:31.550> look<00:01:31.819> at<00:01:31.970> the

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.090 
overs when you don't even look at the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.730 
overs when you don't even look at the
ball<00:01:32.270> cuz<00:01:32.479> a<00:01:32.509> lot<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.750> us<00:01:32.959> we<00:01:33.140> look<00:01:33.319> at<00:01:33.470> the<00:01:33.560> ball

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
ball cuz a lot of us we look at the ball

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.469 
ball cuz a lot of us we look at the ball
if<00:01:34.190> you<00:01:34.250> can<00:01:34.459> do<00:01:34.550> step<00:01:34.789> overs<00:01:35.030> out<00:01:35.090> looking<00:01:35.420> at

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
if you can do step overs out looking at

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:36.910 
if you can do step overs out looking at
the<00:01:35.539> ball<00:01:35.690> it<00:01:35.810> gives<00:01:36.020> you<00:01:36.110> time<00:01:36.289> to<00:01:36.349> look<00:01:36.709> up

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
the ball it gives you time to look up

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.260 
the ball it gives you time to look up

with it and give yourself a little bit

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.070 
with it and give yourself a little bit
of<00:01:49.069> time<00:01:49.250> to<00:01:49.399> play<00:01:49.610> the<00:01:49.759> next<00:01:50.030> pass<00:01:50.239> or<00:01:50.690> decide

of time to play the next pass or decide

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:52.839 
of time to play the next pass or decide
what<00:01:51.289> to<00:01:51.410> do<00:01:51.530> with<00:01:51.679> the<00:01:51.770> ball<00:01:51.979> even<00:01:52.640> if<00:01:52.729> you're

00:01:52.839 --> 00:01:52.849 
what to do with the ball even if you're

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.190 
what to do with the ball even if you're
still<00:01:52.970> used<00:01:53.420> to<00:01:53.539> looking<00:01:53.780> down<00:01:53.959> at<00:01:54.110> the<00:01:54.170> floor

still used to looking down at the floor
it<00:01:54.470> does<00:01:54.679> buy<00:01:54.890> you<00:01:54.950> an<00:01:55.310> extra<00:01:55.640> second<00:01:56.060> I'm

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
serious when you didn't step on if you

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.839 
serious when you didn't step on if you
look<00:01:57.950> at<00:01:58.099> some<00:01:58.220> of<00:01:58.310> these<00:01:58.369> clips<00:01:58.550> and<00:01:58.759> watch

00:01:58.839 --> 00:01:58.849 
look at some of these clips and watch

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:01.900 
look at some of these clips and watch
the<00:01:59.000> opponent<00:02:00.099> generally<00:02:01.099> it<00:02:01.310> just<00:02:01.729> they

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
the opponent generally it just they

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.100 
the opponent generally it just they
don't<00:02:02.090> know<00:02:02.149> when<00:02:02.360> to<00:02:02.390> stick<00:02:02.720> their<00:02:02.869> leg<00:02:03.080> in

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:03.110 
don't know when to stick their leg in

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:04.660 
don't know when to stick their leg in
like<00:02:03.380> generally<00:02:03.950> if<00:02:04.130> I'm<00:02:04.310> playing<00:02:04.459> against

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
like generally if I'm playing against

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.999 
like generally if I'm playing against
professionals<00:02:05.440> they<00:02:06.440> will<00:02:06.619> know<00:02:06.800> when<00:02:06.979> to

00:02:06.999 --> 00:02:07.009 
professionals they will know when to

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:08.680 
professionals they will know when to
stick<00:02:07.280> the<00:02:07.369> leg<00:02:07.520> in<00:02:07.670> but<00:02:07.819> a<00:02:07.970> lot<00:02:08.270> of<00:02:08.300> the<00:02:08.479> time

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:08.690 
stick the leg in but a lot of the time

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.240 
stick the leg in but a lot of the time
if<00:02:08.840> you're<00:02:08.929> once<00:02:09.200> your<00:02:09.319> master<00:02:09.800> the<00:02:09.920> step<00:02:10.129> over

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
if you're once your master the step over

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.190 
if you're once your master the step over
is<00:02:10.459> you<00:02:10.550> can<00:02:10.700> earn<00:02:10.879> yourself<00:02:11.000> a<00:02:11.300> foul<00:02:11.540> and<00:02:11.900> then

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200 
is you can earn yourself a foul and then

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.270 
is you can earn yourself a foul and then
once<00:02:12.410> you've<00:02:12.530> gone<00:02:12.680> onto<00:02:12.830> that<00:02:13.069> foul

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
once you've gone onto that foul

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.369 
once you've gone onto that foul
eventually<00:02:14.030> it<00:02:14.480> mean<00:02:14.780> it<00:02:14.870> slows<00:02:15.140> them<00:02:15.349> down

00:02:15.369 --> 00:02:15.379 
eventually it mean it slows them down

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:16.660 
eventually it mean it slows them down
they're<00:02:15.680> not<00:02:15.830> going<00:02:15.980> to<00:02:16.010> want<00:02:16.190> to<00:02:16.220> tackle<00:02:16.580> you

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
they're not going to want to tackle you

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:17.950 
they're not going to want to tackle you
again<00:02:16.880> especially<00:02:17.000> if<00:02:17.390> they're<00:02:17.510> on<00:02:17.600> a<00:02:17.630> yellow

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:17.960 
again especially if they're on a yellow

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.650 
again especially if they're on a yellow
card<00:02:18.200> and<00:02:18.410> if<00:02:19.070> you<00:02:19.310> just<00:02:19.760> really<00:02:20.090> improves<00:02:20.420> you

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
card and if you just really improves you

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.130 
card and if you just really improves you
your<00:02:21.440> dribbling

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
your dribbling

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.380 
your dribbling
