he's in an earthquake chain so basically

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.850 
he's in an earthquake chain so basically
I<00:01:38.130> have<00:01:38.220> nothing<00:01:38.549> that<00:01:39.360> could<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:40.380> with<00:01:41.130> bent

I have nothing that could just with bent
his<00:01:44.240> earthquake<00:01:45.240> my<00:01:46.610> most<00:01:47.610> common<00:01:48.390> or<00:01:49.229> better

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
his earthquake my most common or better

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.450 
his earthquake my most common or better
said<00:01:50.070> the<00:01:51.259> pokemon<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.530> could<00:01:52.890> handle<00:01:53.250> him

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
said the pokemon that could handle him

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:59.249 
said the pokemon that could handle him
the<00:01:53.790> best<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:55.520> useless<00:01:56.520> because<00:01:56.909> he<00:01:57.869> is

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
the best a useless because he is

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.590 
the best a useless because he is
already<00:02:00.259> burned<00:02:00.500> so<00:02:02.320> my<00:02:03.320> poison<00:02:03.860> heal<00:02:04.600> gliscor

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
already burned so my poison heal gliscor

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.260 
already burned so my poison heal gliscor
wouldn't<00:02:06.590> fit<00:02:06.829> anything<00:02:07.159> I<00:02:07.490> wouldn't<00:02:08.090> do

00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:08.270 
wouldn't fit anything I wouldn't do

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:11.440 
wouldn't fit anything I wouldn't do
anything<00:02:08.569> but<00:02:09.349> anyway<00:02:09.770> he<00:02:10.429> went<00:02:10.670> down<00:02:11.120> to<00:02:11.180> the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
anything but anyway he went down to the

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.320 
anything but anyway he went down to the
critical<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:13.069> critical<00:02:13.489> level<00:02:13.849> of<00:02:13.940> his<00:02:14.090> health

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
critical to critical level of his health

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.860 
critical to critical level of his health
so<00:02:15.080> that<00:02:15.500> he<00:02:15.709> then<00:02:16.160> I<00:02:16.190> could<00:02:16.550> just<00:02:16.819> try<00:02:17.510> to<00:02:17.569> kill

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
so that he then I could just try to kill

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.559 
so that he then I could just try to kill
him<00:02:18.050> off<00:02:18.230> with<00:02:18.500> a<00:02:18.560> shadow<00:02:18.980> ball<00:02:19.370> but<00:02:20.239> it<00:02:20.330> wasn't

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
him off with a shadow ball but it wasn't

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:26.559 
him off with a shadow ball but it wasn't
enough<00:02:21.250> unfortunately<00:02:22.250> but<00:02:23.000> he<00:02:23.150> still<00:02:25.569> died

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
enough unfortunately but he still died

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:31.080
