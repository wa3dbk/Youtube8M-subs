note no drug testing policy in WWE right
it<00:01:41.130> was<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.340> Wild<00:01:41.759> West<00:01:41.909> compared<00:01:42.329> to<00:01:42.420> how<00:01:42.509> it

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
it was the Wild West compared to how it

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.770 
it was the Wild West compared to how it
is<00:01:42.689> now<00:01:43.610> yeah<00:01:44.610> he<00:01:44.759> wasn't<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.180> mr.<00:01:45.450> perfect

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
is now yeah he wasn't the mr. perfect

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.139 
is now yeah he wasn't the mr. perfect
that<00:01:45.899> he<00:01:46.020> had<00:01:46.110> been<00:01:46.320> but<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> think<00:01:47.149> motivated

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
that he had been but I think motivated

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.280 
that he had been but I think motivated
in<00:01:48.270> the<00:01:48.360> right<00:01:48.540> feud<00:01:48.899> with<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.079> right

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
in the right feud with the right

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.039 
in the right feud with the right
opponent<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:50.030> a<00:01:51.030> grand<00:01:51.420> stage<00:01:51.780> like

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:52.049 
opponent on a grand stage like

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:54.440 
opponent on a grand stage like
WrestleMania<00:01:52.460> absolutely<00:01:53.460> Curt<00:01:54.149> Hennig

WrestleMania absolutely Curt Hennig

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.859 
WrestleMania absolutely Curt Hennig
against<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.229> Kurt<00:01:55.890> Angle<00:01:56.600> perfect<00:01:57.600> against

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
against the Kurt Angle perfect against

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:58.850 
against the Kurt Angle perfect against
angle<00:01:58.170> would<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.380> been<00:01:58.469> a<00:01:58.500> great<00:01:58.680> match

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
angle would have been a great match

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.440 
angle would have been a great match
there<00:01:59.189> was<00:01:59.280> no<00:01:59.430> reason<00:01:59.759> for<00:01:59.880> them<00:02:00.000> not<00:02:00.030> to<00:02:00.210> do

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
there was no reason for them not to do

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.230 
there was no reason for them not to do
the<00:02:00.570> match<00:02:01.100> Kurt<00:02:02.100> Angle<00:02:02.399> and<00:02:02.490> Kane<00:02:02.790> was<00:02:03.060> not<00:02:03.210> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
not a feud that people were dying to see

was no reason to do that match it was
truly<00:02:23.489> a<00:02:23.610> waste<00:02:23.970> of<00:02:24.180> Kurt<00:02:24.390> Angle<00:02:24.510> I<00:02:24.870> agree<00:02:25.200> on

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
Storm and I don't remember I'm guessing

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.089 
Storm and I don't remember I'm guessing
that<00:02:39.959> was<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.260> Sunday<00:02:40.560> night<00:02:40.739> heat<00:02:40.920> match

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
that was the Sunday night heat match

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.259 
that was the Sunday night heat match
because<00:02:41.370> I<00:02:41.430> don't<00:02:41.579> remember<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.939> being<00:02:42.090> on

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
because I don't remember that being on

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.690 
because I don't remember that being on
the<00:02:42.390> pay-per-view<00:02:42.799> so<00:02:43.799> he<00:02:43.980> was<00:02:44.129> relegated<00:02:44.430> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
the pay-per-view so he was relegated to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.970 
the pay-per-view so he was relegated to
Sunday<00:02:45.150> Night<00:02:45.329> Heat<00:02:45.359> in<00:02:45.780> a<00:02:45.870> six-man<00:02:46.319> tag<00:02:46.709> and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:46.980 
Sunday Night Heat in a six-man tag and

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.970 
Sunday Night Heat in a six-man tag and
his<00:02:47.129> team<00:02:47.370> lost<00:02:48.170> why<00:02:49.170> would<00:02:49.470> you<00:02:49.560> stick<00:02:49.769> mr.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:49.980 
his team lost why would you stick mr.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.099 
his team lost why would you stick mr.
perfect<00:02:50.549> in<00:02:50.639> a<00:02:50.730> meaningless<00:02:51.180> six-man<00:02:51.780> tag

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:52.109 
perfect in a meaningless six-man tag

00:02:52.109 --> 00:02:54.830 
perfect in a meaningless six-man tag
that<00:02:52.319> wasn't<00:02:52.650> even<00:02:52.739> on<00:02:52.980> WrestleMania<00:02:53.840> when

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
that wasn't even on WrestleMania when

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.449 
that wasn't even on WrestleMania when
you<00:02:54.959> could<00:02:55.139> have<00:02:55.260> done<00:02:55.409> mr.<00:02:55.739> perfect<00:02:56.159> against

you could have done mr. perfect against
Kurt<00:02:56.639> Angle<00:02:57.000> I<00:02:57.150> think<00:02:57.750> that<00:02:57.870> could<00:02:58.019> have<00:02:58.109> been

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
Kurt Angle I think that could have been

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.739 
Kurt Angle I think that could have been
a<00:02:58.230> hell<00:02:58.379> of<00:02:58.409> a<00:02:58.560> match
