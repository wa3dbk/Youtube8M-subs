00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 Hello everyone , this is a new series with you. 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:08.760
 the secrets and the easter eggs gravity falls and will 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.550
 It is dedicated to 13 episodes 2 season and the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:14.849
 so what can we see there went 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:17.400
 it is worth starting with this frame where stfordford 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:20.130
 runs in some incomprehensible dimension 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.439
 what is likely to be the universe 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.230
 Bill Sayfer or sleep itself 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:27.359
 Stanford after this meeting he recorded 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.849
 in his diary this is strange 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.439
 triangular creature turns in my 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.780
 dreams during the week 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:35.610
 but this is not the most important thing 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.219
 the foregoing is so well known and 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.950
 served as the beginning to the theory itself in 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.680
 this passage shows two second diaries 2 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.960
 so in all three diaries there 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.809
 information belted live as well 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.120
 information on how to call it and also 

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:53.789
 how to get rid of it in all three 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.610
 diaries also have a so-called circle 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:59.219
 bella which has signs of almost everyone 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.469
 the main characters so from where could 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:04.170
 know about these all character is their stanford 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:06.780
 when wrote this information as well 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.939
 filled all the fields in the wheel and bella all 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.340
 we know that he started recording his 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.220
 information diaries only on arrival at 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.770
 gravity falls about 30 years ago and all 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:19.500
 how could he know about all the hyperemia 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.890
 for the first time sushi gods he saw everyone 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.500
 only in 12 series and the first thing that comes in 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:27.810
 head that together with his friend macaque 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.850
 there when building a portal by chance 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.630
 or it was not by chance that a car was created 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.750
 of time 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.390
 but it's not all worth it now go 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.430
 finally to two diaries which is like 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.409
 would accidentally fly by in this frame 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.780
 remember all this action can 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.630
 occur either in Stanford's dream or in 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.259
 measuring beer could beat replace all 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.259
 diaries 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.450
 and add pages to yourself with signs of all 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.000
 characters that a watches 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.979
 it is likely that Stanford is not 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.049
 able to distinguish real diaries 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.229
 from fake another proof 

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.689
 that he can be anyone including 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:06.119
 Changeling and now the question will sound 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:07.829
 who tormented me a long time ago also 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.780
 you have already written about this in 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.660
 comments a 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.480
 also in my group and me personally why 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.380
 stanford first writes with his right hand in 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.410
 my childhood 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.940
 and after he left the portal 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.520
 he takes notes 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:25.700
 left hand and now the most important 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.160
 whether the question could replace Stanford 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.860
 after which he abruptly began writing another 

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:32.600
 hand all your critics of the aria version 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.880
 offer in my group as well 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.670
 comments where is now 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.280
 stanford but in this frame to us actually 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:43.190
 show the dial from the elevator where there is 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:46.010
 as many as three floors and this is a refuge so its 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:48.110
 let's call it clearly located under the hut of secrets 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.420
 as the descent there serves first 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.239
 stairway hidden behind a gray machine 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:55.700
 also the elevator and at this moment we see how 

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:58.310
 our trio drives through one of the floors and 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.260
 where that is possible 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.080
 a device that should help 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:05.000
 dipper fight bil cipher maybe 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.019
 be and attempt to protect your mind in 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.180
 further from him 

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.670
 as always, waiting for your theory versions 

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.970
 about this and now let's move on to the 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:16.820
 a simple 13th series is called dungeons 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:19.160
 dungeons once again dungeons and in this 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:21.950
 frame we see the griffin mage archer 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.110
 also a troll or orc and it is nothing 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:26.390
 as a reference to the board card game 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.400
 dungeons and dragons someone and tomorrow 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:30.769
 the show is clearly a fan of this game and 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.540
 finally pay attention to this frame 

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:34.970
 where is stanford located in some 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.609
 dungeon because around him are stone 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.709
 there are also walls well marked 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:42.769
 rock painting where some creatures 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:45.200
 precisely creatures most likely worship 

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:47.420
 Does the triangle mean that in gravity 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:51.019
 Falls was or still exist 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:53.030
 secret society worshiping bill all 

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:54.829
 your versions suggest in the comments and 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.630
 that's all I wanted for you today 

00:03:54.829 --> 00:03:58.130
