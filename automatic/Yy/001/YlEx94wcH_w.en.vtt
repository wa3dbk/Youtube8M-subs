00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.540
 tell you how to make your server 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.009
 minecraft yes yes yes you heard right 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:15.839
 finally i did it and so us 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.350
 for this we need we usually 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.090
 server, then I may tell you how 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.890
 make server with plugins this already 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.810
 A little more difficult how to install the plugin 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.420
 y well and other other useful 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.230
 so we need to go to the official website 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.929
 us crafting 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.969
 well, or just click on 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.130
 donload 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:39.210
 but for the gifted we press 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:43.770
 just drowned from the tab thought here 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.690
 here and minecraft jumped up and now he 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:50.430
 downloaded and even brought here so that 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.469
 we need further we need a program 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.320
 hamachi link to which i naturally 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 the movie in the description this program is needed for 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:02.250
 so that you can connect to 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.619
 your friend without external ip is possible 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.140
 in the second part of this tutorial I 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:11.640
 tell you how to make external and 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:15.030
 and so he worked it is necessary in order 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.810
 so that other players who are not in hamachi 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:20.700
 could connect to your server and 

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:22.560
 so but let's look at the way 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.759
 connection through hamachi we need this 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.880
 server we start it and let's wait 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:34.020
 a few seconds that's fine when waiting 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.759
 generated measures and all this here is a wolf 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:41.280
 white list server and other important things 

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:50.189
 wait for spawning zone to be prepared 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:55.100
 and 5760 6265 sometime later 74 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:59.689
 a77 79 gosh how long is it 85 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.689
 8790 so 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:05.220
 fine fine all servers 

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:07.290
 prepared halftones and we close 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.619
 the server just simply close the server 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:12.660
 click close 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.720
 well, or on this red red cross 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.520
 that is, a white cross on a red background 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.060
 we shut down this server in general and then we 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.640
 we press server prapor hour this very 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.730
 necessary because without it you can not 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:32.580
 nothing to do at all and we need 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:34.200
 wonderful hamachi program for that 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:36.030
 to create your network you need 

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:39.900
 register it is done just 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.050

 ip 25 163 well not that ip that 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:06.540

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:15.110
