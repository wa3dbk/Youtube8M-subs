00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.600 
mostly just in men's sizes so I figured
I'd<00:01:36.600> make<00:01:36.630> my<00:01:36.990> own<00:01:37.229> review<00:01:37.470> this<00:01:38.189> isn't<00:01:38.520> the

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
I'd make my own review this isn't the

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.640 
I'd make my own review this isn't the
review<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.150> is<00:01:39.299> just<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:39.600> unboxing<00:01:40.290> this

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
review this is just the unboxing this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.859 
review this is just the unboxing this
shoe<00:01:40.860> kind<00:01:41.100> of<00:01:41.250> got<00:01:41.400> slept<00:01:41.790> on<00:01:41.939> in<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.360> way<00:01:42.540> but

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
shoe kind of got slept on in a way but

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.539 
shoe kind of got slept on in a way but
and<00:01:42.930> then<00:01:43.049> I<00:01:43.259> feel<00:01:43.500> like<00:01:43.619> it<00:01:43.799> sold<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.189> really

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
and then I feel like it sold out really

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.429 
and then I feel like it sold out really
quickly<00:01:44.909> once<00:01:45.299> people<00:01:45.509> kind<00:01:45.810> of<00:01:45.930> figured<00:01:46.200> out

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
quickly once people kind of figured out

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.830 
quickly once people kind of figured out
like<00:01:46.920> that<00:01:47.070> she<00:01:47.280> was<00:01:47.399> actually<00:01:47.610> kind<00:01:48.509> of<00:01:48.630> more

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
like that she was actually kind of more

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.270 
like that she was actually kind of more
limited<00:01:49.049> than<00:01:49.409> what<00:01:49.590> people<00:01:49.740> thought<00:01:50.100> it<00:01:50.250> was

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
limited than what people thought it was

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.130 
limited than what people thought it was
going<00:01:50.640> to<00:01:50.670> be<00:01:50.970> so<00:01:51.420> I<00:01:51.450> think<00:01:51.540> that's<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:51.990> reason

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
going to be so I think that's the reason

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.710 
going to be so I think that's the reason
why<00:01:52.380> it<00:01:52.530> sold<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:52.979> but<00:01:53.280> I<00:01:53.520> tried<00:01:54.030> Nike<00:01:54.479> and

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
why it sold out but I tried Nike and

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:56.870 
why it sold out but I tried Nike and
like<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:55.049> sold<00:01:55.290> out<00:01:55.439> immediately<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.430> then

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
like you sold out immediately and then

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.670 
like you sold out immediately and then
Jimmy<00:01:57.149> jazz<00:01:57.360> held<00:01:57.659> on<00:01:57.810> to<00:01:57.990> them<00:01:58.140> for<00:01:58.170> a<00:01:58.409> few

how it got there I know that there's

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.310 
how it got there I know that there's
like<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.459> story<00:03:20.970> behind<00:03:21.300> it<00:03:21.690> with<00:03:21.840> the<00:03:21.930> New<00:03:22.080> York

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320 
like a story behind it with the New York

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.170 
like a story behind it with the New York
Knicks<00:03:22.560> becoming<00:03:23.010> sour<00:03:23.400> towards

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
Knicks becoming sour towards

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.290 
Knicks becoming sour towards
Chicago<00:03:24.930> and<00:03:25.170> Jordan<00:03:25.650> but<00:03:26.340> I<00:03:26.640> don't<00:03:26.940> really<00:03:27.150> I

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
Chicago and Jordan but I don't really I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.910 
Chicago and Jordan but I don't really I
think<00:03:27.420> that<00:03:27.570> story<00:03:27.900> was<00:03:28.110> just<00:03:28.140> made<00:03:28.440> up<00:03:28.470> after

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
think that story was just made up after

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.830 
think that story was just made up after
the<00:03:29.010> fact<00:03:29.160> I<00:03:29.340> think<00:03:29.400> Nike<00:03:29.940> really<00:03:30.330> like

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
the fact I think Nike really like

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.140 
the fact I think Nike really like
created<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> shoe<00:03:31.860> with<00:03:32.520> the<00:03:32.670> colorway<00:03:33.120> and

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
created the shoe with the colorway and

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.520 
created the shoe with the colorway and
they<00:03:33.360> were<00:03:33.450> like<00:03:33.600> oh<00:03:33.750> it's<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:33.930> dope<00:03:34.110> colorway

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
they were like oh it's a dope colorway

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:35.420 
they were like oh it's a dope colorway
let's<00:03:34.860> um

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
let's um

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.850 
let's um
no<00:03:36.150> let's<00:03:36.390> just<00:03:37.080> like<00:03:37.290> a<00:03:37.320> story

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
no let's just like a story

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.800 
no let's just like a story
behind<00:03:38.130> it<00:03:38.550> so<00:03:38.760> that's<00:03:39.300> kind<00:03:39.480> of<00:03:39.510> my<00:03:39.570> opinion

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
behind it so that's kind of my opinion

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.270 
behind it so that's kind of my opinion
on<00:03:40.110> the<00:03:40.200> whole<00:03:40.230> story<00:03:40.650> I<00:03:40.770> don't<00:03:41.040> think<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
on the whole story I don't think the

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.580 
on the whole story I don't think the
story<00:03:41.520> is<00:03:41.610> true<00:03:42.090> like<00:03:42.420> that's<00:03:42.630> kind<00:03:42.840> of<00:03:42.959> if<00:03:43.410> it

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
story is true like that's kind of if it

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.740 
story is true like that's kind of if it
is<00:03:43.709> it's<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.010> a<00:03:44.100> crummy<00:03:44.489> story<00:03:44.910> one<00:03:45.420> thing<00:03:45.630> I

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
is it's like a crummy story one thing I

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:47.660 
is it's like a crummy story one thing I
noticed<00:03:46.110> with<00:03:46.320> the<00:03:46.500> grade<00:03:46.709> school<00:03:47.070> now<00:03:47.250> they

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
noticed with the grade school now they

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.420 
noticed with the grade school now they
didn't<00:03:47.970> do<00:03:48.090> a<00:03:48.120> translucent<00:03:48.959> bottom<00:03:49.320> here<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:50.430 
didn't do a translucent bottom here the

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:51.800 
didn't do a translucent bottom here the
bottom<00:03:50.670> kind<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:51.000> reminds<00:03:51.270> me<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.480> the<00:03:51.630> green

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:51.810 
bottom kind of reminds me of the green

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:54.410 
bottom kind of reminds me of the green
glow<00:03:51.989> for<00:03:52.440> but<00:03:52.980> on<00:03:53.220> camera<00:03:53.730> it<00:03:53.970> looks<00:03:54.030> like<00:03:54.300> the

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
glow for but on camera it looks like the

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.199 
glow for but on camera it looks like the
green<00:03:54.630> glow<00:03:54.840> for<00:03:55.280> but<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.520> person<00:03:56.820> it's

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
green glow for but in person it's

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.320 
green glow for but in person it's
definitely<00:03:57.600> a<00:03:57.660> teal<00:03:58.020> color<00:03:59.030> inside<00:04:00.030> you<00:04:00.209> get

open with the old boxes they have a lip

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:02.170 
open with the old boxes they have a lip
to<00:05:00.470> it<00:05:00.590> so<00:05:00.770> it<00:05:00.890> doesn't<00:05:01.190> do<00:05:01.340> that<00:05:01.490> but<00:05:02.150> I

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
to it so it doesn't do that but I

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.330 
to it so it doesn't do that but I
thought<00:05:02.480> Nike<00:05:03.020> and<00:05:03.290> Jordan<00:05:03.680> Brand<00:05:03.890> whatever

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:04.340 
thought Nike and Jordan Brand whatever

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.670 
thought Nike and Jordan Brand whatever
was<00:05:04.970> gonna<00:05:05.180> make<00:05:05.630> a<00:05:05.660> change<00:05:05.990> to<00:05:06.200> that<00:05:06.230> on<00:05:06.500> this

was gonna make a change to that on this

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.410 
was gonna make a change to that on this
