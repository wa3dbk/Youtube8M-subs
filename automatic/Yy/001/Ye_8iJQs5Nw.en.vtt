00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:09.480
 carbonia for all guys this why 

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:10.830
 speaks well back in this new video 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.690
 always on the beta of black ops 3 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.849
 let's return with a series that had been 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.949
 these two states this two weeks 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.300
 weeks that have paralyzed us from 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:19.830
 last episode ie the challenges 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.779
 impossible on call of duty 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.770
 we are as you see on black ops 3 and how 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.900
 you can also see the shots 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.460
 you will be aware there is something that is 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.330
 different from the usual 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.560
 and in fact we will play boys on PC not 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:33.090
 blades defined precisely on these there is a 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.910
 framework I can no longer play on these 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:38.130
 there is a 4 or even on xbox but to do 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.210
 something different I wanted to try on PC 

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.800
 and as many of you say that we 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:46.739
 consular so to speak we are not capable 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.450
 to use the pc 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.820
 in short, I accept this challenge and seek 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.789
 to make an impossible challenge on call of 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:55.170
 duty black ops 3 beta on the pc see 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.980
 try to come up with something 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.570
 decent 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.920
 the particular challenge does not film times 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.530
 we simply try to do a 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.560
 deathmatch with installments or two then 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.750
 double positive we hope to succeed 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.119
 I think the manowar will go to class 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.140
 the second then from the class that will come out 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:18.100
 human gold or 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.930
 the head the rk 7 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:22.030
 having said that in short, the game is 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.790
 clearly where I do he saw on the fly 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.750
 and with mouse and keyboard I have no controller 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:31.030
 and set then we will play on pc from 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.430
 real pc has ri 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.900
 oh well enough with these obscene neologisms 

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:37.330
 we go into the game but it takes too much 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:39.430
 already started but just started 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.080
 so we play it anyway 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:44.020
 let's see immediately a big photo 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.220
 for mister frank it's great ok then 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:54.970
 let's see if we can get back to it right away 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:57.070
 various ok but it didn't have to be death 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:58.630
 he must have died the boys are not 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:03.479
 I have trouble saying it I'm pretty nahb 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:06.070
 on the PC and play in general only on 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:10.780
 PC game at counter strike practitioner 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:15.489
 just okay lover a shot that is too much 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.160
 strong meter frank and that however I am 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.940
 in short, he found it very difficult 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 when started call of duty orc says ma 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:27.280
 destroyed and already we start very badly 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:31.810
 they must already recover a killer e 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:34.780
 going double positive faq is fine 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.090
 fantastic this shores means col 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.320
 sun in the eyes that is more impossible 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:43.750
 so guys being challenge couldn't be 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.160
 let me know if the idea of ​​continuing on 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.870
 pc 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:48.940
 this maybe this series of challenges 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.930
 impossible on black ops 3 as long as there is the 

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:54.489
 beta may like it otherwise otherwise if 

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.910
 prefer to see maybe something 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.560
 a little more detail let me in 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:02.140
 comment as usual always on black 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.540
 ops 3 and in case I try to do it on xbox 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:07.099
 where with the controller definitely 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:09.780
 I can find myself a little better 

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:13.470
 or if I can do something good 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:15.950
 but surely this name can give 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.950
 assists 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:23.640
 ok there's a double soul that's fine 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:28.700
 we are not at various because I know almost 

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:33.180
 I stay here to finish the shots 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:39.959
 remember but there is this holy god 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:42.629

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.090

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:58.829
 at the beginning I did n't know I could n't 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.569

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.519
 make me respon areas ie I could not 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:05.129
 set a key for that from 

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:06.510

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.970
 standard 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.450
 anyway yes to make you understand at the beginning 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.450
 I was not able to 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:25.889

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:54.150
 how much we are doing 18 evening between three 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:55.470
 gentlemen or three installments and 20 kg are missing 

00:04:54.150 --> 00:05:01.200
 end of the game 

00:04:55.470 --> 00:05:02.820
 from which we make it I foresee many 

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.970
 comments to but this is not a challenge 

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:08.040
 impossible loves loves and guys I have you 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.690
 said I think you will see it also from 

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:12.720
 you are quite prevented from doing so 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:16.050
 play on the pc so any challenge is 

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.310
 for me impossible on the PC and in any case if 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:23.510
 in short, you think you have a challenge 

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:26.520
 challenging in short what you think can 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:29.370
 bring out a good somalia gameplay of the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:33.150
 good gameplay something enjoyable from a 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:34.560
 entertainment point of view 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:37.460
 let me know in peace 

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.460
 comments as usual 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:43.140
 and then we will do what I can 

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:45.060
 to bring it to you here for a moment 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:46.500
 phrase concentration over nights auser 

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.180
 do not give a damn and are of 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:50.340
 we are too strong 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:52.470
 come here where I last wanted it 

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:55.470
 three radio gentlemen we have 

00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:57.979
 kept too strong so it's a 

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:59.970
 so more gameplay that aspires impossible 

00:05:57.979 --> 00:06:02.220
 I'm glad I did so 

00:05:59.970 --> 00:06:05.250
 the first attempt is that he came 

00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:07.710
 out a cute gameplay hints there 

00:06:05.250 --> 00:06:09.330
 I repeat your impossible challenge in the 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.550
 comments I will do my best to 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:13.740
 please as usual with those with 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:15.300
 the more I like it and don't propose it to me 

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:18.150
 I repeat those with lifeless skins 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:19.950
 inverted settings and visual 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.700
 strange and things like that because i 

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.440
 boys in short 

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.539
 I told you the difficulty is that of 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:26.010
 use mouse and keyboard look up in short 

00:06:24.539 --> 00:06:28.529
 to be a little forgiving I'd like to 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.449
 do something with sniper pump then 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:32.669
 if you want to propose something with these 

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:34.919
 two categories of weapons and said this 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.049
 I really like a comment with the challenge 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:40.279
 impossible not only of the view between which 

00:06:37.049 --> 00:06:40.279
 see you with a next video
