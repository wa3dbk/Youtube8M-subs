00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:49.790 
types of interfaces for example if john

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:51.370 
types of interfaces for example if john
wants<00:01:49.970> to<00:01:50.000> see<00:01:50.060> inside<00:01:50.510> the<00:01:50.660> car<00:01:50.900> there's<00:01:51.260> no

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
wants to see inside the car there's no

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:52.990 
wants to see inside the car there's no
buttons<00:01:51.650> or<00:01:51.710> part<00:01:51.950> he<00:01:52.040> just<00:01:52.250> taps<00:01:52.460> right<00:01:52.880> on

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
buttons or part he just taps right on

buttons or part he just taps right on
the<00:01:53.090> car<00:01:54.520> we<00:01:55.520> have<00:01:55.610> so<00:01:55.760> much<00:01:55.880> screen<00:01:56.120> real

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:56.150 
the car we have so much screen real

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:57.730
