00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
be on about halfway or really it doesn't

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.779 
be on about halfway or really it doesn't
matter<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.439> long<00:00:19.500> as<00:00:19.590> it's<00:00:19.830> over<00:00:19.949> halfway<00:00:20.250> up

matter as long as it's over halfway up

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.620 
matter as long as it's over halfway up
to<00:00:21.090> ten<00:00:21.330> whatever<00:00:22.020> you<00:00:22.140> it<00:00:23.100> goes<00:00:23.400> up<00:00:23.609> to<00:00:23.820> 11

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
to ten whatever you it goes up to 11

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.529 
to ten whatever you it goes up to 11
anyway

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
anyway

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.300 
anyway
just<00:00:27.539> make<00:00:27.720> sure<00:00:27.750> you<00:00:27.960> try<00:00:28.199> volume<00:00:28.529> 1<00:00:28.680> gains<00:00:29.010> in

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
just make sure you try volume 1 gains in

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.930 
just make sure you try volume 1 gains in
and<00:00:30.269> then<00:00:30.390> set<00:00:30.660> your<00:00:30.689> main<00:00:31.080> settings<00:00:31.940> more

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
and then set your main settings more

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.880 
and then set your main settings more
depending<00:00:33.420> what<00:00:33.480> you're<00:00:33.600> playing<00:00:33.809> I<00:00:34.050> just<00:00:34.320> for

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
depending what you're playing I just for

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.490 
depending what you're playing I just for
this<00:00:34.950> demonstration<00:00:35.340> I'm<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.000> using

00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:36.500 
this demonstration I'm just using

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.840 
this demonstration I'm just using
standard<00:00:37.500> 5<00:00:37.860> 5<00:00:38.070> 5<00:00:38.280> 5<00:00:38.489> 5<00:00:38.520> all<00:00:38.879> the<00:00:38.969> way<00:00:39.059> through

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
standard 5 5 5 5 5 all the way through

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:44.799 
standard 5 5 5 5 5 all the way through
just<00:00:41.850> to<00:00:42.000> give<00:00:42.210> it<00:00:42.329> that<00:00:42.680> averageness<00:00:43.680> I<00:00:44.129> guess

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809 
just to give it that averageness I guess

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.229 
just to give it that averageness I guess
have<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:45.989> tone<00:00:46.289> up<00:00:46.530> on<00:00:46.770> your<00:00:46.920> guitar<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:48.120> you

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
have you tone up on your guitar if you

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.750 
have you tone up on your guitar if you
have<00:00:48.420> a<00:00:48.500> switch<00:00:49.500> to<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> treble<00:00:50.789> on<00:00:50.940> and<00:00:51.239> then

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
have a switch to the treble on and then

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:55.250 
have a switch to the treble on and then
volume<00:00:53.760> up<00:00:53.879> when<00:00:54.030> you're<00:00:54.149> doing<00:00:54.390> obviously<00:00:54.750> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
volume up when you're doing obviously of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.779 
volume up when you're doing obviously of
course<00:00:55.469> but<00:00:55.969> the<00:00:56.969> technique<00:00:57.719> to<00:00:58.789> pixellating

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
course but the technique to pixellating

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.819 
course but the technique to pixellating
is<00:00:59.940> basically<00:01:00.270> using<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.199> back<00:01:01.410> side<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.680> your

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
is basically using the back side of your

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:04.820 
is basically using the back side of your
pick<00:01:02.100> on<00:01:02.480> the<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.899> two<00:01:04.140> separate<00:01:04.470> strengths<00:01:04.769> or

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
pick on the on two separate strengths or

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:10.969 
pick on the on two separate strengths or
even<00:01:05.010> one<00:01:05.309> after<00:01:05.820> used<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.090> get<00:01:06.210> it<00:01:06.299> going<00:01:07.790> e<00:01:09.979> if

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
even one after used to get it going e if

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.370 
even one after used to get it going e if
you're<00:01:11.220> playing<00:01:11.689> you<00:01:12.689> can<00:01:12.780> just<00:01:12.960> turn<00:01:13.170> around

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
you're playing you can just turn around

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.260 
you're playing you can just turn around
as<00:01:13.740> you're<00:01:13.950> playing<00:01:14.189> so<00:01:15.000> I<00:01:15.030> was<00:01:15.150> about

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
as you're playing so I was about

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.010 
as you're playing so I was about
demonstration<00:01:15.750> but<00:01:15.840> yeah<00:01:16.820> so<00:01:17.820> see<00:01:18.030> it<00:01:18.119> in<00:01:18.210> any

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
demonstration but yeah so see it in any

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.109 
demonstration but yeah so see it in any
way<00:01:19.170> you<00:01:19.200> want<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.590> can<00:01:19.710> start<00:01:19.890> up<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.759> or

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:21.119 
way you want you can start up there or

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:23.570 
way you want you can start up there or
down<00:01:21.299> here<00:01:21.600> it's<00:01:22.380> up<00:01:22.470> to<00:01:22.680> you<00:01:22.799> you<00:01:23.009> can<00:01:23.400> get<00:01:23.549> a

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:23.580 
down here it's up to you you can get a

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:24.289 
down here it's up to you you can get a
lot<00:01:23.759> out<00:01:23.790> of<00:01:23.939> it

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
lot out of it

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.420 
lot out of it
really<00:01:24.720> but<00:01:25.380> I'm<00:01:25.530> here<00:01:25.770> I'll<00:01:25.860> do<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.040> quick

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
really but I'm here I'll do a quick

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:29.030 
really but I'm here I'll do a quick
demonstration<00:01:26.580> so<00:01:27.390> if<00:01:28.259> I'm<00:01:28.500> doing<00:01:28.680> top<00:01:28.890> two

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
demonstration so if I'm doing top two

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.120 
demonstration so if I'm doing top two
strings<00:01:29.100> right<00:01:29.520> now<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.030> with<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:31.130> left

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
strings right now so you with your left

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.310 
strings right now so you with your left
hand<00:01:32.400> if<00:01:32.820> you're<00:01:32.970> a<00:01:33.000> right<00:01:33.210> hander<00:01:33.509> hold<00:01:34.079> down

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
hand if you're a right hander hold down

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.819 
hand if you're a right hander hold down
the<00:01:35.310> strings<00:01:35.579> that<00:01:36.360> you're<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.600> easing<00:01:36.960> so<00:01:37.740> it

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the strings that you're not easing so it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.649 
the strings that you're not easing so it
doesn't<00:01:38.070> make<00:01:38.159> too<00:01:38.189> much<00:01:38.340> noise

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:51.569 

now<00:01:43.659> slow<00:01:46.049> faster<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:50.619> try<00:01:51.069> and<00:01:51.130> keep<00:01:51.399> it

00:01:51.569 --> 00:01:51.579 
now slow faster and just try and keep it

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.590 
now slow faster and just try and keep it
on<00:01:51.670> two<00:01:52.390> strings<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:54.250> can<00:01:54.399> switch<00:01:54.640> over<00:01:54.789> to

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.740 

get<00:01:58.600> different<00:01:58.810> effects<00:01:59.289> with<00:01:59.500> the<00:01:59.619> UM<00:02:00.750> tena

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:01.750 
get different effects with the UM tena

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:20.410 
get different effects with the UM tena
gain<00:02:01.990> up<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.259> bit<00:02:03.450> really<00:02:04.450> starts<00:02:04.780> to<00:02:04.840> kick<00:02:04.990> in

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.700 

yeah<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.540> pretty<00:02:21.780> much<00:02:21.870> real<00:02:22.170> slow<00:02:22.410> all<00:02:22.590> the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
yeah it's pretty much real slow all the

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.550 
yeah it's pretty much real slow all the
way<00:02:22.800> down<00:02:23.010> the<00:02:23.160> fretboard<00:02:24.110> you<00:02:25.110> don't<00:02:25.260> have<00:02:25.380> to

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
way down the fretboard you don't have to

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.020 
way down the fretboard you don't have to
go<00:02:25.680> that<00:02:25.830> far<00:02:25.860> really<00:02:26.370> probably<00:02:26.610> only<00:02:26.820> have<00:02:26.940> to

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
go that far really probably only have to

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.650 
go that far really probably only have to
go<00:02:27.120> half<00:02:27.300> way<00:02:27.410> depending<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.730> your<00:02:29.730> technique

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
go half way depending on your technique

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.760 
go half way depending on your technique
you're<00:02:30.870> using<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.320> you're<00:02:31.440> going<00:02:31.590> real<00:02:31.740> fast

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
you're using if you're going real fast

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:43.040 
you're using if you're going real fast
real<00:02:32.100> slow<00:02:32.370> but<00:02:32.900> you<00:02:33.900> can<00:02:33.990> go<00:02:34.080> the<00:02:34.230> other<00:02:34.320> way
