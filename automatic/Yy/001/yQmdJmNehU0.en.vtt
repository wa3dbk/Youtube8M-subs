barrel<00:02:11.819> or<00:02:12.300> think<00:02:12.510> you<00:02:12.629> should<00:02:12.750> know<00:02:12.870> that<00:02:12.989> be

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
barrel or think you should know that be

barrel or think you should know that be
barrel<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:13.500> social

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
barrel the social

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:20.710 
barrel the social
I<00:02:14.010> think<00:02:14.220> I'm<00:02:15.440> so<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.650> you<00:02:17.360> if<00:02:18.379> you<00:02:19.379> had<00:02:19.560> a

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
I think I'm so if you if you had a

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.640 
I think I'm so if you if you had a
software<00:02:21.720> we<00:02:21.810> can<00:02:21.959> straighten<00:02:22.230> that<00:02:22.440> out<00:02:22.500> just

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
software we can straighten that out just

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.410 
software we can straighten that out just
a<00:02:22.920> tiny<00:02:23.190> amount<00:02:23.430> that's<00:02:23.760> all<00:02:23.970> that<00:02:24.150> beneath

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
a tiny amount that's all that beneath

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.509 
a tiny amount that's all that beneath
but<00:02:24.540> that<00:02:24.690> looks<00:02:24.870> pretty<00:02:25.230> pretty<00:02:26.040> haunting

00:02:26.509 --> 00:02:26.519 
but that looks pretty pretty haunting

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:29.720 
but that looks pretty pretty haunting
there<00:02:26.840> can<00:02:27.840> your<00:02:27.930> next<00:02:28.290> shot<00:02:28.440> again<00:02:28.680> I<00:02:28.950> like

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
that that's a cool shot as a very

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.100 
that that's a cool shot as a very
 really<00:02:33.060> working<00:02:33.420> on<00:02:33.540> the<00:02:33.630> pastor's

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
 really working on the pastor's

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.449 
 really working on the pastor's
as<00:02:34.260> it<00:02:34.380> takes<00:02:34.590> years<00:02:34.769> of<00:02:34.890> cult<00:02:35.190> but<00:02:35.340> no

00:02:35.449 --> 00:02:35.459

as it takes years of cult but no
textures<00:02:35.880> notation<00:02:36.390> is<00:02:36.450> this<00:02:36.599> so<00:02:37.110> about<00:02:37.380> the

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
textures notation is this so about the

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.350 
textures notation is this so about the
contrast<00:02:38.040> of<00:02:38.130> colors<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.670> the<00:02:38.730> pattern<00:02:38.940> there

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
contrast of colors in the pattern there

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.530 
contrast of colors in the pattern there
and<00:02:39.650> good<00:02:40.650> gives<00:02:41.580> you<00:02:41.700> some<00:02:41.910> angle<00:02:42.420> and

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
and good gives you some angle and

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.400 
and good gives you some angle and
everything<00:02:42.810> yes<00:02:43.019> as<00:02:43.530> a<00:02:43.590> very<00:02:44.360> clever<00:02:45.360> photo<00:02:46.049> I

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410

in oh I would say I think this is your

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.680 
in oh I would say I think this is your
weakest<00:03:22.590> short<00:03:23.100> here<00:03:23.430> just<00:03:23.790> because<00:03:23.970> i<00:03:24.389> think

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
weakest short here just because i think

weakest short here just because i think
the<00:03:25.200> light<00:03:25.590> coming<00:03:26.549> off<00:03:26.639> their<00:03:27.000> looks<00:03:27.540> a<00:03:27.690> bit

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
the light coming off their looks a bit

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.180 
the light coming off their looks a bit
amateur<00:03:28.260> compared<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:28.769> shorter<00:03:29.069> you've

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
amateur compared to the shorter you've

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.759 
amateur compared to the shorter you've
done<00:03:29.370> above<00:03:29.760> the<00:03:30.389> actual<00:03:30.660> capture<00:03:31.019> the

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:31.769 
done above the actual capture the

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:34.610 
done above the actual capture the
composition<00:03:32.609> is<00:03:33.019> absolutely<00:03:34.019> fine<00:03:34.139> though<00:03:34.470> it

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:34.620 
composition is absolutely fine though it

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.759 
composition is absolutely fine though it
is<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:34.889> background<00:03:35.130> lighting<00:03:35.780> and<00:03:36.780> the<00:03:37.560> kind

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:37.769 
is the background lighting and the kind

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:40.520 
is the background lighting and the kind
of<00:03:37.799> fairly<00:03:38.549> guff<00:03:38.850> background<00:03:39.630> wallpaper<00:03:40.410> that

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:40.530 
of fairly guff background wallpaper that

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:43.490 
of fairly guff background wallpaper that
you<00:03:40.590> use<00:03:40.829> not<00:03:41.549> as<00:03:41.760> cool<00:03:42.030> as<00:03:42.359> a<00:03:42.420> subject<00:03:43.200> which

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
you use not as cool as a subject which

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.039 
you use not as cool as a subject which
you<00:03:43.620> have<00:03:43.709> short<00:03:43.950> so<00:03:44.480> yeah<00:03:45.480> if<00:03:45.600> you<00:03:45.720> tell<00:03:45.959> you

split lighting and maybe a little bit

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:00.949 
split lighting and maybe a little bit
too<00:03:59.849> strong<00:04:00.060> on<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.420> side<00:04:00.569> of<00:04:00.599> the<00:04:00.750> face<00:04:00.900> where

too strong on the side of the face where

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.539 
too strong on the side of the face where
it's<00:04:01.290> kind<00:04:01.620> of<00:04:01.650> blowing<00:04:01.980> out<00:04:02.220> there<00:04:02.489> but<00:04:04.549> gives

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:05.549 
it's kind of blowing out there but gives

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:06.800 
it's kind of blowing out there but gives
you<00:04:05.639> some<00:04:05.849> techniques<00:04:06.030> gives<00:04:06.569> you<00:04:06.660> some

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:06.810 
you some techniques gives you some
