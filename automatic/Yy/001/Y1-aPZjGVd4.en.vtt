on power so let's try that again so
normally<00:01:26.790> we'd<00:01:26.970> go<00:01:27.630> to<00:01:27.689> cost<00:01:27.930> us<00:01:28.110> how<00:01:28.259> hard<00:01:28.530> to

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
normally we'd go to cost us how hard to

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:31.399 
normally we'd go to cost us how hard to
play<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:28.950> but<00:01:29.850> we<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> actually<00:01:30.329> play<00:01:31.200> for

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
play this but we can actually play for

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:35.300 
play this but we can actually play for
free<00:01:31.590> for<00:01:32.159> once<00:01:32.520> I<00:01:32.729> guess<00:01:33.409> and<00:01:34.409> before<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
free for once I guess and before it

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.640 
free for once I guess and before it
blows<00:01:35.430> up<00:01:35.610> as<00:01:36.240> you<00:01:36.420> see<00:01:36.630> will<00:01:37.110> take<00:01:37.320> damage

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650

normal<00:03:05.530> sources<00:03:06.510> the<00:03:07.510> next<00:03:08.130> ok<00:03:09.130> so<00:03:09.520> this<00:03:09.610> is

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
normal sources the next ok so this is

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:10.890 
normal sources the next ok so this is
hard<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.090> time<00:03:10.270> let's<00:03:10.450> see<00:03:10.540> if<00:03:10.630> I<00:03:10.660> knew<00:03:10.810> this

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
hard the time let's see if I knew this

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.350 
hard the time let's see if I knew this

00:03:49.649 --> 00:03:49.659 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.670 

close<00:03:50.659> enough<00:03:50.750> we're<00:03:51.140> pushing<00:03:51.319> in<00:03:51.470> and<00:03:51.590> it

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
close enough we're pushing in and it

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.149 
close enough we're pushing in and it
homes<00:03:51.890> in<00:03:52.099> and<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.640> can<00:03:52.849> do<00:03:52.970> poison<00:03:53.180> damage<00:03:53.390> so

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.649 
let's say somewhere near their homes in
and<00:03:57.739> does<00:03:57.829> not<00:03:58.010> match<00:03:58.310> so<00:03:58.609> that's<00:03:58.790> some

00:03:59.649 --> 00:03:59.659 
and does not match so that's some

00:03:59.659 --> 00:04:03.460 
and does not match so that's some
synergy<00:04:00.079> that<00:04:00.609> best<00:04:01.609> friend<00:04:01.849> can<00:04:02.470> has
