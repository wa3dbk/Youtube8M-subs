games<00:00:12.509> for<00:00:12.719> about<00:00:12.929> 10<00:00:13.650> to<00:00:13.830> 15<00:00:14.160> minutes<00:00:14.519> so

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
games for about 10 to 15 minutes so

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:28.400 
games for about 10 to 15 minutes so
let's<00:00:15.690> start<00:00:15.929> with<00:00:16.080> the<00:00:16.170> gaming<00:00:16.470> review<00:00:27.410> now

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
let's start with the gaming review now

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.990 
let's start with the gaming review now
before<00:00:28.769> starting<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.189> gaming<00:00:29.519> review<00:00:29.789> let's

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
before starting the gaming review let's

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.339 
before starting the gaming review let's
actually<00:00:30.179> go<00:00:30.480> into<00:00:30.630> the<00:00:30.779> settings<00:00:31.140> in

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
actually go into the settings in

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.560 
actually go into the settings in
application<00:00:32.099> section<00:00:32.550> we<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:32.820> see<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.300> if

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
application section we will see that if

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.750 
application section we will see that if
we<00:00:33.750> can<00:00:34.079> move<00:00:34.290> our<00:00:34.500> applications<00:00:35.130> to<00:00:35.250> SD<00:00:35.520> card

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
we can move our applications to SD card

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.569 
we can move our applications to SD card
or<00:00:35.880> not<00:00:36.059> an<00:00:36.239> SD<00:00:37.140> card<00:00:37.350> will<00:00:37.500> select<00:00:37.890> asphalt<00:00:38.430> 8

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
or not an SD card will select asphalt 8

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.430 
or not an SD card will select asphalt 8
and<00:00:38.730> we'll<00:00:38.969> move<00:00:39.180> this<00:00:39.390> applications<00:00:39.989> to<00:00:40.170> SD

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
and we'll move this applications to SD

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.350 
and we'll move this applications to SD
card<00:00:40.649> and<00:00:41.129> you<00:00:41.610> can<00:00:41.670> see<00:00:41.850> that<00:00:42.030> we<00:00:42.120> can<00:00:42.239> move

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
card and you can see that we can move

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.420 
card and you can see that we can move
the<00:00:42.540> application<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:43.110> SD<00:00:43.379> card<00:00:43.620> which<00:00:44.100> is<00:00:44.219> very

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
the application to SD card which is very

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.389 
the application to SD card which is very
simple<00:00:45.020> now<00:00:46.020> if<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.260> take<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.469> look<00:00:46.680> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:46.950> CPL

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
simple now if we take a look at the CPL

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.740 
simple now if we take a look at the CPL

well with the medium graphics mode it

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.710 
well with the medium graphics mode it
was<00:03:28.370> not<00:03:28.520> the<00:03:28.640> case<00:03:28.790> with<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.150> high<00:03:29.300> graphics

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
was not the case with the high graphics

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.390 
was not the case with the high graphics
but<00:03:29.870> it<00:03:30.050> is<00:03:30.200> the<00:03:30.350> case<00:03:30.530> with<00:03:31.010> the<00:03:31.100> median

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
but it is the case with the median

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.890 
but it is the case with the median
graphics<00:03:33.970> so<00:03:34.970> guys<00:03:35.150> we<00:03:35.330> have<00:03:35.450> been<00:03:35.480> playing

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
graphics so guys we have been playing

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:37.360 
graphics so guys we have been playing
games<00:03:36.140> for<00:03:36.350> about<00:03:36.560> seven<00:03:36.860> to<00:03:36.950> eight<00:03:37.010> minutes

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
games for about seven to eight minutes

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.280 
games for about seven to eight minutes
now<00:03:37.730> let's<00:03:38.120> check<00:03:38.390> the<00:03:38.570> temperature

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
now let's check the temperature

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.500 
now let's check the temperature
the<00:03:39.860> time<00:03:40.070> is<00:03:40.250> eleven<00:03:40.520> fifty<00:03:40.820> seven<00:03:41.150> now<00:03:41.270> we

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:41.510 
the time is eleven fifty seven now we

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:44.380 
the time is eleven fifty seven now we
started<00:03:41.840> at<00:03:41.960> 47<00:03:42.590> or<00:03:42.710> 48<00:03:42.910> and<00:03:43.910> you<00:03:44.000> can<00:03:44.120> see<00:03:44.240> the

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:44.390 
started at 47 or 48 and you can see the

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.850 
started at 47 or 48 and you can see the
temperature<00:03:44.810> is<00:03:44.960> still<00:03:45.170> around<00:03:45.440> 40<00:03:45.830> degrees

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
temperature is still around 40 degrees

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.540 
temperature is still around 40 degrees
which<00:03:46.430> is<00:03:46.460> very<00:03:46.820> decent<00:03:47.440> it<00:03:48.440> is<00:03:48.620> below<00:03:49.130> 45

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:49.550 
which is very decent it is below 45

00:03:49.550 --> 00:03:52.450 
which is very decent it is below 45
degrees<00:03:49.580> which<00:03:50.120> is<00:03:50.240> really<00:03:50.510> good<00:03:50.810> and<00:03:51.460> there

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
degrees which is really good and there

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:54.910 
degrees which is really good and there
is<00:03:52.550> no<00:03:52.730> heating<00:03:53.570> issue<00:03:53.900> actually<00:03:54.260> with<00:03:54.740> this

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
is no heating issue actually with this

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.370 
is no heating issue actually with this
device<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.460> can<00:03:55.700> see<00:03:55.850> that<00:03:56.090> now<00:03:56.960> let's<00:03:57.170> play

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
device you can see that now let's play

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:30.389 
device you can see that now let's play
modern<00:03:57.740> combat<00:03:57.920> 5<00:03:58.370> on<00:03:58.640> the<00:03:59.090> Samsung<00:03:59.480> Galaxy<00:03:59.510> j5

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:30.399 

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:32.409 

also<00:04:31.399> one<00:04:31.580> thing<00:04:31.729> I<00:04:31.849> would<00:04:31.969> like<00:04:32.119> to<00:04:32.300> mention

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
also one thing I would like to mention

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:35.049 
also one thing I would like to mention
is<00:04:32.719> that<00:04:32.749> you<00:04:33.589> won't<00:04:33.830> be<00:04:33.979> able<00:04:34.099> to<00:04:34.249> install<00:04:34.580> all

00:04:35.049 --> 00:04:35.059 
is that you won't be able to install all

00:04:35.059 --> 00:04:37.029 
is that you won't be able to install all
the<00:04:35.300> applications<00:04:35.930> of<00:04:36.080> high<00:04:36.349> end<00:04:36.529> games<00:04:36.770> on

00:04:37.029 --> 00:04:37.039 
the applications of high end games on

00:04:37.039 --> 00:04:39.309 
the applications of high end games on
the<00:04:37.430> Samsung<00:04:37.819> Galaxy<00:04:37.849> j5<00:04:38.389> because<00:04:38.930> of<00:04:39.139> the

00:04:39.309 --> 00:04:39.319 
the Samsung Galaxy j5 because of the

00:04:39.319 --> 00:04:41.230 
the Samsung Galaxy j5 because of the
internal<00:04:39.770> storage<00:04:39.949> that<00:04:40.249> you<00:04:40.369> get<00:04:40.580> it<00:04:41.149> is

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:41.240 
internal storage that you get it is

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.739 
internal storage that you get it is
around<00:04:41.509> 4.5<00:04:42.199> GB<00:04:42.589> or<00:04:42.680> less<00:04:42.889> than<00:04:43.129> that<00:04:43.719> so<00:04:44.719> you

00:04:44.739 --> 00:04:44.749 
around 4.5 GB or less than that so you

00:04:44.749 --> 00:04:46.510 
around 4.5 GB or less than that so you
will<00:04:45.080> be<00:04:45.229> able<00:04:45.319> to<00:04:45.499> install<00:04:45.830> very<00:04:46.219> few

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:46.520 
will be able to install very few

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:48.909 
will be able to install very few
high-end<00:04:46.879> games<00:04:47.270> and<00:04:48.199> then<00:04:48.409> you<00:04:48.529> will<00:04:48.680> move

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:48.919 
high-end games and then you will move

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:51.850 
high-end games and then you will move
you<00:04:49.520> will<00:04:49.669> have<00:04:49.819> to<00:04:50.029> move<00:04:50.180> applications<00:04:50.719> to<00:04:51.439> sd

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:51.860 
you will have to move applications to sd

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:54.639 
you will have to move applications to sd
card<00:04:51.889> to<00:04:52.809> install<00:04:53.809> more<00:04:54.139> games<00:04:54.439> or

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:54.649 
card to install more games or

00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.839 
card to install more games or
applications<00:04:55.039> on<00:04:55.729> Samsung<00:04:56.569> Galaxy<00:04:56.960> j5<00:04:57.849> so

00:04:58.839 --> 00:04:58.849 
applications on Samsung Galaxy j5 so

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:29.020 
applications on Samsung Galaxy j5 so
that<00:04:58.999> is<00:04:59.119> slightly<00:04:59.479> disappointing

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.790 

so<00:05:29.570> as<00:05:29.690> you<00:05:29.810> guys<00:05:29.930> have<00:05:30.080> already<00:05:30.410> seen<00:05:30.590> that

00:05:30.790 --> 00:05:30.800 
so as you guys have already seen that

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:32.560 
so as you guys have already seen that
even<00:05:31.100> this<00:05:31.250> game<00:05:31.490> was<00:05:31.700> working<00:05:32.030> just<00:05:32.060> fine<00:05:32.510> on

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
even this game was working just fine on

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.440 
even this game was working just fine on
the<00:05:32.990> Samsung<00:05:33.410> Galaxy<00:05:33.500> j5<00:05:34.010> I<00:05:34.520> had<00:05:34.910> no<00:05:35.120> issues

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:35.450 
the Samsung Galaxy j5 I had no issues

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:37.570 
the Samsung Galaxy j5 I had no issues
playing<00:05:35.780> this<00:05:35.930> game<00:05:36.170> it<00:05:36.860> was<00:05:37.040> running<00:05:37.250> quite

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
playing this game it was running quite

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:41.320 
playing this game it was running quite
smoothly<00:05:38.500> but<00:05:39.500> I<00:05:39.530> guess<00:05:39.830> that<00:05:40.130> by<00:05:40.850> default<00:05:41.150> the

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
smoothly but I guess that by default the

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.060 
smoothly but I guess that by default the
game<00:05:41.480> was<00:05:41.660> running<00:05:41.990> on<00:05:42.140> medium<00:05:42.350> graphics<00:05:42.920> or

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:43.070 
game was running on medium graphics or

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:54.920 
game was running on medium graphics or
low<00:05:43.190> graphics<00:05:45.550> and<00:05:46.550> it<00:05:46.670> worked<00:05:46.940> really<00:05:47.150> well

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:58.100 

so<00:05:55.530> wise<00:05:55.710> as<00:05:56.010> it<00:05:56.190> is<00:05:56.340> been<00:05:56.610> for<00:05:57.030> 13<00:05:57.810> to<00:05:57.900> 14

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
so wise as it is been for 13 to 14

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:59.870 
so wise as it is been for 13 to 14
minutes<00:05:58.680> now<00:05:58.860> let's<00:05:59.310> check<00:05:59.610> the<00:05:59.670> temperature

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880 
minutes now let's check the temperature

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.970 
minutes now let's check the temperature
after<00:06:00.390> playing<00:06:00.720> games<00:06:00.930> for<00:06:01.110> about<00:06:01.320> 14<00:06:01.710> minutes

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:01.980 
after playing games for about 14 minutes

00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:03.770 
after playing games for about 14 minutes
you<00:06:02.340> will<00:06:02.430> see<00:06:02.610> that<00:06:02.820> the<00:06:03.210> temperature<00:06:03.660> is

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:03.780 
you will see that the temperature is

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.360 
you will see that the temperature is
still<00:06:03.960> around<00:06:04.260> 40<00:06:04.560> degrees<00:06:04.590> which<00:06:05.040> is<00:06:05.070> very

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
still around 40 degrees which is very

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.810 
still around 40 degrees which is very
decent<00:06:06.650> considering<00:06:07.650> it<00:06:08.460> is<00:06:08.610> having

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
decent considering it is having

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.900 
decent considering it is having
Snapdragon<00:06:09.510> 410<00:06:09.750> chipset<00:06:10.400> so<00:06:11.400> that<00:06:11.550> is<00:06:11.670> really

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:11.910 
Snapdragon 410 chipset so that is really
