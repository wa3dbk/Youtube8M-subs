Criminal Games Animated (by: Adrian Dodig)

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:16.180
-Hello dear audience, 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:17.800
welcome to another episode.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:18.560
Here with me is:

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.580
-Killer001.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.420
-What's this?!

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:25.740
A sheep?

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:27.020
Probably...

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.640
Let's punch a tree.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:32.400
Punch it!

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.860
It's a bit weird that...

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.380
...that it floats.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.820
It doesn't care about gravity.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:49.680
Can I take the...

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:50.180
...cactus?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:52.320
I can! Alright!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.520
-What about sand?

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:54.780
-Sand? Hold on...

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.925
Awesome, sand too.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:06.320
-Let's start building a house.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.140
-Mmkay.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.500
(ZOMG FINALLY!)

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.140
-Let's kill some cows.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.240
CHOP!

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.640
(it's just onions, don't worry)

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.940
-What's that down there?

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.720
A skeleton?

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.440
-OW! THAT HURTS, YOU MORON!

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.460
C'mon, why don't you die already?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.720
-Can't you see? You're trying to kill him with sugar canes!

00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:59.200
No wonder he isn't dying.

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.200
-Did... did he just get stuck on that cactus?

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.300
-He can't move...

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.240
(spongebob timecard)

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.260
-Yeah, I know that... that the zombies can't hurt you,
they just wanna hug you.

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:25.920
-Haha, hug you...

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.960
And to kiss you goodnight.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.120
-Haha, yeah like: "Good night. (KICK). Die."

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.980
-Someone's breaking bones.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:34.580
-A skeleton(?).

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.600
Maybe a zombie gave him a hug.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:39.000
-Let's be friends! -Like he hugged us last night.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.560
Is that a piece of candy?!

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:43.160
*polar facepalm*

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:44.074
-No, that's a fish...

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.360
*polar bear*

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.080
Oh, there are my stairs.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:53.000
Stupid stairs!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100
Moving stairs! (escalator)

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.880
This tree is annoying...

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:58.820
Watching my house...

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
Spying on me... what if...

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.900
...a spider falls from it...

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.777
-And?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.760
-...and breaks in through the window at night

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:05.520
and molests me.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:15.400
*moving stairs*

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.840
-Meat!

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.660
-What you gonna drink?

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:21.160
-Meat!

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:22.260
-What you gonna eat?

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.360
-Meat!

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.520
-Don't tell me we lost the mine,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.140
the one and only mine we found and we lost it... -Miney!

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:31.400
-...how could we lose the mine?!

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:34.660
(he said that really fast)

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.580
-Lyrics comin' at you with supersonic speed!

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:38.120
-Don't tell me we lost the mine,

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.840
the one and only mine we found and we lost it... -Miney!

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.220
-...how could we lose the mine?!

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.900
-How would you say it...

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.920
...empire of animals.

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:48.704
-Animal Empire. (a kind of chocolate over here)

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.260
-Ooh, isn't that the chocolate?

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.200
-Hahah.

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.480
-HERE THEY ARE! -THEY'RE HERE!

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.440
-Dob-... what's their name, dobermans?

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.700
-Haha, dobermans...

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.380
What? Where?

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:06.880
WOAH! Look at him, I didn't even see him!

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:10.020
...Look at him I didn't see him (*facepalm*) -Look at him I didn't see him.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.460
-Are there elephants? (in Minecraft)

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.140
-Why would there be elephants?!

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:16.320
-To ride them, DUH!

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.200
-Elephants are ugly...

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:21.940
Look, there's gold!

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:23.620
-I know, but look at the zombie, it's gonna...

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:24.880
-Can I shoot him?

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.920
-No.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.060
NNNNNNNNGHH!!!!!!!!!!!!! (exploding of hapiness)

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:33.920
-Oh, look it's...

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.340
-What's that blue stuff?!

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:38.460
-AHAHAHAHAHHAHAH

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:40.360
IT'S DIAMONDS!

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:43.820
-Look, a jellyfish!

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:44.320
*still polar*

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.000
-That's a squid...

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:46.540
-Jellyfish!

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:47.260
-Squid.

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:47.840
-JELLYFISH!

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:49.620
-AAAAAARRRRRRRRGGGGHHHH!

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:53.320
-There it is!

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:55.040
-What? -Obsidian.

00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.360
-Oooh, that's what you need for the portal!

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:58.900
*random*

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.240
Ooh!

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:05.800
Ooh!

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:07.040
Where am I?

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.180
Ooooh! Aaaah!

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.800
Ya know, this place isn't so bad.

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.180
Ugh! It's lagging!

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.840
We need to find the

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.480
nether fortress

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.800
in which are those guys...

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.780
...you know, those firey ones

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:31.040
that float and shoot fireballs at you...

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:33.580
-Ooh!

00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.160
-Come closer!

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.980
There ya go.

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:39.880
Now let's go bananas.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.400
Bananas!

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:43.860
-Heeeere, banana, banana, banana!

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.220
-Come here, little banana!

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:48.780

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.980
-A creeper, I MEAN a giraffe.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.700
A green giraffe. (Animal Empire over there!)

00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.420
-Jump!

00:05:58.720 --> 00:05:59.370
-JUMP!

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:13.640
