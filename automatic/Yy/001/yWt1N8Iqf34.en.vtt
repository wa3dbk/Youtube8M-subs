never<00:01:41.759> really<00:01:42.000> played<00:01:42.270> much<00:01:42.570> of<00:01:43.040> Donkey<00:01:44.040> Kong

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
never really played much of Donkey Kong

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.460 
never really played much of Donkey Kong
Country<00:01:44.399> 2<00:01:44.909> diddy<00:01:45.270> kong's<00:01:45.540> quest<00:01:45.930> until<00:01:46.170> I<00:01:46.320> got

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
Country 2 diddy kong's quest until I got

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.730 
Country 2 diddy kong's quest until I got
older<00:01:46.829> did<00:01:47.520> you<00:01:47.640> play<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> one<00:01:48.119> growing<00:01:48.540> up

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.380 

halfway

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
halfway

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.800 
halfway
well<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.540> one<00:01:54.689> has<00:01:54.930> Dixie<00:01:55.799> and<00:01:56.100> Diddy<00:01:56.460> so<00:01:56.850> the

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
well that one has Dixie and Diddy so the

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.929 
well that one has Dixie and Diddy so the
two<00:01:57.990> on<00:01:58.140> the<00:01:58.200> outside<00:01:58.560> there<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.850> the

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
two on the outside there I do have the

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.670 
two on the outside there I do have the
figures<00:02:00.240> and<00:02:00.479> they're<00:02:00.990> really<00:02:01.140> cool<00:02:01.469> I<00:02:01.530> really

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
figures and they're really cool I really

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.990 
figures and they're really cool I really
like<00:02:01.860> them<00:02:02.159> as<00:02:02.250> a<00:02:02.280> tandem<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.909> they're

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:03.000 
like them as a tandem I think they're

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.700 
like them as a tandem I think they're
probably<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.479> best<00:02:03.509> tandem<00:02:03.899> in<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.469> Donkey

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
probably the best tandem in the Donkey

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.800 
probably the best tandem in the Donkey
Kong<00:02:04.860> Country<00:02:05.040> series<00:02:05.399> you<00:02:06.360> might<00:02:06.509> disagree

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
Kong Country series you might disagree

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.389 
Kong Country series you might disagree
with<00:02:07.020> me<00:02:07.140> but<00:02:07.290> I<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.649> Diddy<00:02:07.950> was<00:02:08.129> easy<00:02:08.280> to

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
with me but I think Diddy was easy to

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.369 
with me but I think Diddy was easy to
control<00:02:08.640> and<00:02:08.759> Dixie<00:02:09.149> was<00:02:09.270> even<00:02:09.450> easier<00:02:09.509> so

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
control and Dixie was even easier so

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:11.720 
control and Dixie was even easier so
that<00:02:10.470> was<00:02:10.560> probably<00:02:10.649> the<00:02:10.890> happiest<00:02:11.280> gameplay

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
that was probably the happiest gameplay

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.400 
that was probably the happiest gameplay
control<00:02:12.090> I<00:02:12.120> think<00:02:12.180> of<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.660> had<00:02:12.870> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
control I think of I had in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.120 
control I think of I had in
youngcountry<00:02:14.010> series<00:02:14.490> I<00:02:14.610> thought<00:02:14.760> was<00:02:14.910> great

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
youngcountry series I thought was great

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:18.230 
youngcountry series I thought was great
the<00:02:17.130> levels<00:02:17.400> were<00:02:17.490> cool<00:02:17.640> I<00:02:17.670> like<00:02:17.880> the<00:02:17.970> pirate

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 
the levels were cool I like the pirate

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.400 
the levels were cool I like the pirate
ship<00:02:18.420> and<00:02:18.450> everything<00:02:18.720> and<00:02:19.020> I'm<00:02:19.110> just<00:02:19.230> trying

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
ship and everything and I'm just trying

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.770 
ship and everything and I'm just trying
to<00:02:19.470> remember<00:02:19.680> all<00:02:20.310> the<00:02:20.490> levels<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.210> B<00:02:21.360> levels

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to remember all the levels the B levels

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
to remember all the levels the B levels
oh<00:02:22.050> yeah<00:02:22.260> so<00:02:22.470> this<00:02:22.560> one<00:02:22.740> I<00:02:22.770> think<00:02:22.890> I<00:02:23.220> think<00:02:23.970> this

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
oh yeah so this one I think I think this

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:25.390 
oh yeah so this one I think I think this
one<00:02:24.240> was<00:02:24.390> a<00:02:24.420> little<00:02:24.660> bit<00:02:24.750> more<00:02:24.870> difficult

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:25.400 
one was a little bit more difficult

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.890 
one was a little bit more difficult
definitely<00:02:26.400> yeah<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.330> it<00:02:27.420> was<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.540> little<00:02:27.720> bit

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
definitely yeah and it was a little bit

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.190 
definitely yeah and it was a little bit
more<00:02:28.110> tricky<00:02:28.500> to<00:02:28.650> get<00:02:28.830> through<00:02:30.050> spoilers<00:02:31.050> for

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
more tricky to get through spoilers for

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.380 
more tricky to get through spoilers for
anything<00:02:31.470> that<00:02:31.740> any<00:02:31.830> of<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.520> enemies<00:02:32.850> in<00:02:33.270> here

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
anything that any of the enemies in here

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.310 
anything that any of the enemies in here
that<00:02:33.540> we're<00:02:33.660> kind<00:02:33.780> of<00:02:33.810> looking<00:02:33.930> at<00:02:34.170> and

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
that we're kind of looking at and

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:37.220 
that we're kind of looking at and
everything<00:02:34.470> like<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:34.740> oh<00:02:35.180> there<00:02:36.180> is<00:02:36.390> just

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
everything like that oh there is just

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.420 
everything like that oh there is just
trying<00:02:37.410> to<00:02:37.470> get<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.620> name<00:02:37.770> of<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:37.980> one<00:02:38.130> figure

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
trying to get the name of the one figure

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.250 
trying to get the name of the one figure
that<00:02:38.580> I<00:02:38.610> have<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.210> all<00:02:39.390> of<00:02:39.480> them<00:02:39.570> are<00:02:39.660> names<00:02:39.930> so

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
that I have and all of them are names so

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.540 
that I have and all of them are names so
we<00:02:40.380> could<00:02:40.500> probably<00:02:40.650> just<00:02:40.950> look<00:02:41.100> for<00:02:41.280> it<00:02:41.310> and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:41.550 
we could probably just look for it and

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.710 
we could probably just look for it and
his<00:02:42.240> name's<00:02:42.450> Russia<00:02:43.320> pretty<00:02:44.190> sure<00:02:45.150> yeah<00:02:45.510> so

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
do like how the three games do feel like

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.810 
do like how the three games do feel like
unique<00:02:55.380> experiences<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.160> doesn't<00:02:56.430> quite<00:02:56.550> just

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:56.820 
unique experiences it doesn't quite just

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.190 
unique experiences it doesn't quite just
feel<00:02:56.940> like<00:02:57.090> a<00:02:57.120> sequel<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.780> does<00:02:57.930> feel<00:02:58.170> like

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
feel like a sequel it does feel like

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.480 
feel like a sequel it does feel like
it's<00:02:58.440> changed<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.860> gameplay<00:02:59.220> they<00:02:59.340> did

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 
it's changed the gameplay they did

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:00.890 
it's changed the gameplay they did
something<00:02:59.670> new<00:02:59.940> rather<00:03:00.090> than<00:03:00.330> just<00:03:00.540> releasing

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
something new rather than just releasing

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.140 
something new rather than just releasing
the<00:03:00.930> same<00:03:01.170> game<00:03:01.410> three<00:03:01.680> times<00:03:01.830> so<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.850> this<00:03:02.940> one

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
the same game three times so in this one

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:04.610 
the same game three times so in this one
it<00:03:03.300> was<00:03:03.420> different<00:03:03.840> it<00:03:03.900> was<00:03:03.990> with<00:03:04.110> Kitty<00:03:04.350> Kong

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
it was different it was with Kitty Kong

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.280 
it was different it was with Kitty Kong
and<00:03:04.920> I<00:03:05.820> think<00:03:06.180> Dixie<00:03:06.630> again

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
and I think Dixie again

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.460 
and I think Dixie again
yeah<00:03:08.120> I'm<00:03:09.120> not<00:03:09.540> positive<00:03:09.780> because<00:03:10.260> I<00:03:10.350> haven't

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
yeah I'm not positive because I haven't

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.580 
yeah I'm not positive because I haven't
played<00:03:10.650> this<00:03:10.800> one<00:03:10.950> enough<00:03:11.640> but<00:03:12.260> it's<00:03:13.260> good

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
played this one enough but it's good

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.230 
played this one enough but it's good
it's<00:03:13.860> different<00:03:14.490> it<00:03:14.700> definitely<00:03:15.030> feels

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
it's different it definitely feels

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.760 
it's different it definitely feels
different<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.780> feels<00:03:15.990> almost<00:03:16.200> like<00:03:16.380> the<00:03:16.590> most

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
different it feels almost like the most

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.230 
different it feels almost like the most
kitty<00:03:17.130> which<00:03:17.459> makes<00:03:17.700> sense<00:03:17.910> because<00:03:18.030> the

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
kitty which makes sense because the

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.050

think<00:03:58.920> I'm<00:03:59.190> wearing<00:03:59.340> nostalgia<00:03:59.790> glasses<00:04:00.360> a

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
think I'm wearing nostalgia glasses a

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:01.910 
think I'm wearing nostalgia glasses a
little<00:04:00.510> bit<00:04:00.840> and<00:04:01.110> I<00:04:01.200> usually<00:04:01.410> say<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.800> this

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:01.920 
little bit and I usually say that this

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.710 
little bit and I usually say that this
is<00:04:02.040> my<00:04:02.160> favorite<00:04:02.459> one<00:04:02.580> but<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:02.880> think<00:04:03.030> Donkey

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
is my favorite one but I think Donkey

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.880 
is my favorite one but I think Donkey
Kong<00:04:03.810> Country<00:04:03.959> 2<00:04:04.230> might<00:04:04.410> be<00:04:04.500> better

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
Kong Country 2 might be better

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.860 
Kong Country 2 might be better
I<00:04:04.920> don't<00:04:05.730> like<00:04:05.940> three<00:04:06.270> as<00:04:06.360> much<00:04:06.510> as<00:04:06.660> the<00:04:06.750> other

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
I don't like three as much as the other

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.360 
I don't like three as much as the other
two<00:04:06.930> but<00:04:07.290> it's<00:04:07.410> great<00:04:07.709> on<00:04:07.860> its<00:04:08.010> own<00:04:08.130> and

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
two but it's great on its own and

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:09.590 
two but it's great on its own and
possibly<00:04:08.730> this<00:04:08.880> is<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:09.150> of<00:04:09.209> the<00:04:09.330> best

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.600 
possibly this is one of the best

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.449 
possibly this is one of the best
trilogies<00:04:10.200> on<00:04:10.410> the<00:04:10.530> super<00:04:10.739> nintendo<00:04:10.830> of<00:04:11.190> three
