remove this cap and develop full of
power<00:01:53.520> steering<00:01:53.820> fluid<00:01:53.939> so<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.600> level<00:01:55.229> of

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
power steering fluid so the level of

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.340 
power steering fluid so the level of
that<00:01:56.070> is<00:01:56.340> between<00:01:56.850> those<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.299> limits<00:01:58.079> the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.869 

you

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:10.879 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:12.099 

so<00:02:11.390> what<00:02:11.540> we're<00:02:11.629> going<00:02:11.659> to<00:02:11.780> do<00:02:11.870> is<00:02:11.959> get<00:02:12.079> a

so what we're going to do is get a

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:14.319 
so what we're going to do is get a
funnel<00:02:12.349> and<00:02:12.739> we'll<00:02:12.890> do<00:02:13.010> that<00:02:13.189> but<00:02:13.999> one<00:02:14.150> more

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
funnel and we'll do that but one more

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.440 
funnel and we'll do that but one more

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:36.709 
the power steering reservoir again just

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:39.520 
the power steering reservoir again just
pull<00:02:37.069> the<00:02:37.639> stopper<00:02:37.969> out<00:02:38.180> have<00:02:39.079> a<00:02:39.109> rag<00:02:39.409> because

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.329 
about power steering fluid is your car

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.369 
about power steering fluid is your car
will<00:03:26.510> tell<00:03:26.629> you<00:03:26.780> when<00:03:26.900> you<00:03:26.959> need<00:03:27.110> it<00:03:27.140> you'll

00:03:32.309 --> 00:03:32.319 
runs well okay as I'm adding I can see

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:35.170 
runs well okay as I'm adding I can see
the<00:03:33.319> level<00:03:33.620> increasing<00:03:34.159> there<00:03:34.640> we<00:03:34.700> go<00:03:34.849> that

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
the level increasing there we go that

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:47.800 
the level increasing there we go that
should<00:03:35.209> be<00:03:35.720> enough<00:03:46.150> simply<00:03:47.150> push<00:03:47.390> the<00:03:47.599> plug

should be enough simply push the plug

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.990 
should be enough simply push the plug
back<00:03:47.989> in<00:03:48.230> place<00:03:51.159> and<00:03:52.159> you<00:03:52.400> should<00:03:52.639> be<00:03:52.730> good<00:03:52.879> to

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:53.000
