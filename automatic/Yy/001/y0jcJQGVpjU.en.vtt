00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
years so there's really some question

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.440

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
we tell Rams fans that'll get him a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.499 
we tell Rams fans that'll get him a
little<00:01:43.950> excited<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.399> year<00:01:44.460> I<00:01:44.850> think<00:01:45.390> they've

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
little excited this year I think they've

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.480 
little excited this year I think they've
made<00:01:45.720> dramatic<00:01:45.860> improvements<00:01:46.860> on<00:01:46.950> defense

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
made dramatic improvements on defense

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.429 
made dramatic improvements on defense
they'll<00:01:47.790> get<00:01:47.909> defensive<00:01:48.210> tackle<00:01:48.899> and<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
they'll get defensive tackle and the

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.440 
they'll get defensive tackle and the
cornerback<00:01:50.070> so<00:01:50.490> I<00:01:50.520> think<00:01:50.759> that's<00:01:51.030> a<00:01:51.210> big<00:01:51.420> thing

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450
