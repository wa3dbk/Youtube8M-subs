00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.289
 all new video two modes on gta 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.779
 5 pc so it's to represent the mode 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.529

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:27.269
 main movie box that really 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.490

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:32.700
 adults or do it's really a 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.540
 movie that is made for any age and who 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.329
 is superb 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.129
 so here to extend it feels good 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.379
 and it made me great pleasure to 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.450
 find this main actor on my 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.969
 favorite game they have gta 5 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.250
 frankly it's top of the top that made me 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.770
 pleasure really thanks to the creators of the 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.260
 way to have done that is super nice 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.309
 to be able to see that and we know it 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.620
 there are still many children who 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.539
 play at GTA 5 do not hide it from 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.309
 children of all ages they say 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:01.649
 interview - 18 no it's that full 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.719
 children even children 10 years 12 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:06.510
 years he plays and I think it has them 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.430
 is pleased to find an actor who 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:10.710
 had who did before or even 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:13.979
 people like me 17 years old or even 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:16.619
 older who who sees there we can 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.600
 who does this style of fashion what because 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.490
 as it's pretty funny is nice enough 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.189
 thank you really to the creators of the month 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.380
 again is the only downside it is 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.600
 just that the interior of the vehicle is 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.380
 not finished after that we do not care 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.840
 little 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.400
 the most important is the outdoor 1 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:34.710
 which is logical 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:37.320
 so here are these words frankly I 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.590
 I hope this little fashion you 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.790
 I would like to know if what 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.619
 you think of this mode really 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.850
 I like to know now what 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.950
 you think of all that I you 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.810
 present and especially of that tell me what 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.700
 that you do not think of the mode of the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:52.560
 car if it is well done it is 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.860
 really it really represents and if 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.110
 it's good to produce it on gta 5 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.299
 do not forget to let go of the little thumb 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.000
 bluth it's always fun and I 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:06.000
