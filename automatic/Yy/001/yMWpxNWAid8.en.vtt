mounted everything with the battery grip
on<00:00:14.510> a<00:00:14.900> railroad<00:00:15.559> system<00:00:16.119> when<00:00:17.119> I<00:00:17.150> got<00:00:17.420> my<00:00:17.630> gh3<00:00:18.349> I

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:18.590 
on a railroad system when I got my gh3 I

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.159 
on a railroad system when I got my gh3 I
got<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.580> battery<00:00:19.820> grip<00:00:20.000> and<00:00:20.330> the<00:00:20.840> reason<00:00:21.110> I

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:21.169 
got the battery grip and the reason I

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:22.630 
got the battery grip and the reason I
got<00:00:21.200> the<00:00:21.380> battery<00:00:21.650> grip<00:00:21.740> is<00:00:21.919> because<00:00:22.189> I<00:00:22.310> wanted

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:22.640 
got the battery grip is because I wanted

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.519 
got the battery grip is because I wanted
the<00:00:22.789> double<00:00:23.029> batteries<00:00:23.419> on<00:00:23.630> the<00:00:23.660> camera<00:00:24.169> and

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:24.529 
the double batteries on the camera and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.499 
the double batteries on the camera and
to<00:00:25.250> be<00:00:25.369> able<00:00:25.460> to<00:00:25.610> not<00:00:25.820> have<00:00:25.849> to<00:00:26.029> take<00:00:26.360> the

00:00:26.499 --> 00:00:26.509 
to be able to not have to take the

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.480 
to be able to not have to take the
camera<00:00:26.810> off<00:00:26.930> in<00:00:27.079> a<00:00:27.169> mid<00:00:27.349> shoot<00:00:27.619> gave<00:00:28.130> me<00:00:28.279> a<00:00:28.310> lot

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:28.490 
camera off in a mid shoot gave me a lot

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.929 
camera off in a mid shoot gave me a lot
longer<00:00:28.900> time<00:00:29.900> for<00:00:30.140> him<00:00:30.230> and<00:00:30.619> what<00:00:31.400> I<00:00:31.429> found<00:00:31.730> out

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:31.939 
longer time for him and what I found out

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:33.790 
longer time for him and what I found out
like<00:00:32.239> everybody<00:00:32.720> found<00:00:32.870> out<00:00:33.110> is<00:00:33.379> that<00:00:33.410> the

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:33.800 
like everybody found out is that the

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.729 
like everybody found out is that the
Panasonic<00:00:34.670> shifted<00:00:35.210> the<00:00:35.750> quarter-twenty<00:00:36.290> on

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
Panasonic shifted the quarter-twenty on

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:39.130 
Panasonic shifted the quarter-twenty on
the<00:00:37.040> battery<00:00:37.400> we're<00:00:37.550> off<00:00:37.760> to<00:00:38.059> one<00:00:38.180> side<00:00:38.480> which

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
the battery we're off to one side which

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140 
the battery we're off to one side which
no<00:00:39.320> longer<00:00:39.530> lined<00:00:39.949> up<00:00:40.190> on<00:00:40.400> a<00:00:40.580> rail<00:00:40.730> rod<00:00:40.940> system

no longer lined up on a rail rod system

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.840 
no longer lined up on a rail rod system
so<00:00:41.390> you<00:00:41.510> couldn't<00:00:41.780> use<00:00:41.870> a<00:00:41.900> matte<00:00:42.140> box<00:00:42.850> this

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
so you couldn't use a matte box this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.510 
so you couldn't use a matte box this

00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:58.690 
the way it was originally designed I

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:01.180 
the way it was originally designed I
love<00:00:59.690> the<00:00:59.840> fact<00:01:00.079> that<00:01:00.170> I<00:01:00.289> have<00:01:00.469> dual<00:01:00.710> batteries

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190 
love the fact that I have dual batteries

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:02.830 
love the fact that I have dual batteries
because<00:01:01.760> I've<00:01:01.879> already<00:01:02.120> gone<00:01:02.239> through<00:01:02.300> on<00:01:02.809> a

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
because I've already gone through on a

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.200 
because I've already gone through on a
shoot<00:01:03.170> the<00:01:03.440> lower<00:01:03.710> battery<00:01:04.129> and<00:01:04.339> 90%<00:01:04.940> of<00:01:05.089> the

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.210 
shoot the lower battery and 90% of the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.609 
shoot the lower battery and 90% of the
upper<00:01:05.449> battery<00:01:05.780> and<00:01:05.930> never<00:01:06.080> had<00:01:06.229> to<00:01:06.350> take<00:01:06.470> the

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
upper battery and never had to take the

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.100 
upper battery and never had to take the
camera<00:01:06.950> off<00:01:07.100> it<00:01:07.729> was<00:01:07.880> really<00:01:08.420> great<00:01:08.660> and<00:01:08.960> if<00:01:09.020> I

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
camera off it was really great and if I

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.410 
camera off it was really great and if I
did<00:01:09.440> need<00:01:09.649> a<00:01:09.680> third<00:01:09.920> battery<00:01:10.310> the<00:01:10.759> access<00:01:11.179> door

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
did need a third battery the access door

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.850 
did need a third battery the access door
to<00:01:11.450> the<00:01:11.750> battery<00:01:12.110> and<00:01:12.229> the<00:01:12.289> grip<00:01:12.500> is<00:01:12.710> right

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
to the battery and the grip is right

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.109 
to the battery and the grip is right
here<00:01:13.009> on<00:01:13.070> the<00:01:13.160> side<00:01:13.340> so<00:01:13.369> you<00:01:13.640> can<00:01:13.729> just<00:01:13.910> pop

00:01:17.109 --> 00:01:17.119 
battery you never have to worry about

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.060 
battery you never have to worry about
taking<00:01:17.479> the<00:01:17.570> camera<00:01:17.750> off<00:01:18.020> that's<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.830> really

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:19.070 
taking the camera off that's the really

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.780 
taking the camera off that's the really
the<00:01:19.100> cool<00:01:19.400> thing<00:01:20.560> also<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:21.920> I<00:01:22.130> leave<00:01:22.490> it<00:01:22.640> on

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
the cool thing also the I leave it on

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:24.670 
the cool thing also the I leave it on
even<00:01:23.270> if<00:01:23.360> I<00:01:23.420> take<00:01:23.570> the<00:01:23.720> camera<00:01:23.900> off<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.590> I'm

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
even if I take the camera off and I'm

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.520 
even if I take the camera off and I'm
shooting<00:01:24.890> off<00:01:25.600> with<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.750> battery<00:01:27.020> grip<00:01:27.290> I

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
shooting off with the battery grip I

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:30.910 
shooting off with the battery grip I
like<00:01:28.130> the<00:01:28.400> more<00:01:28.790> robust<00:01:29.619> plate<00:01:30.619> on<00:01:30.770> the<00:01:30.829> bottom

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
like the more robust plate on the bottom

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.679 
like the more robust plate on the bottom
it's<00:01:31.189> nice<00:01:31.340> and<00:01:31.520> ergonomic<00:01:32.030> that's<00:01:32.210> rounded

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:32.689 
it's nice and ergonomic that's rounded

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:34.210 
it's nice and ergonomic that's rounded
on<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:32.930> corners<00:01:33.380> this<00:01:33.470> really<00:01:33.829> fits<00:01:34.100> your

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
on the corners this really fits your

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.280 
on the corners this really fits your
hand<00:01:34.430> very<00:01:34.640> well<00:01:34.939> it<00:01:35.479> also<00:01:35.630> protects<00:01:36.140> the

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
hand very well it also protects the

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.560 
hand very well it also protects the
bottom<00:01:36.590> of<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.740> battery<00:01:36.970> grip<00:01:37.970> if<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.270> can<00:01:38.450> put

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
bottom of the battery grip if I can put

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.630 
bottom of the battery grip if I can put
it<00:01:38.659> on<00:01:38.720> concrete<00:01:39.290> I<00:01:39.320> can<00:01:39.619> put<00:01:39.740> it<00:01:39.829> into<00:01:39.979> water

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640 
it on concrete I can put it into water

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.789 
it on concrete I can put it into water
whatever<00:01:41.149> dirt<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:41.720> I<00:01:42.200> really<00:01:42.409> don't<00:01:42.500> care<00:01:42.680> if

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799
