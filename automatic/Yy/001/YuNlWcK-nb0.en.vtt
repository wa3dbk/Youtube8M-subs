where the Redskins have to get better I

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.640 
where the Redskins have to get better I
believe<00:00:48.180> has<00:00:48.420> to<00:00:48.600> start<00:00:48.809> up<00:00:49.020> front<00:00:49.350> with<00:00:49.500> that

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:49.650 
believe has to start up front with that

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:51.020 
believe has to start up front with that
offensive<00:00:49.980> line<00:00:50.129> I<00:00:50.280> needed<00:00:50.580> to<00:00:50.670> get<00:00:50.790> better

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.780

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
addressed in free agency but I think

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.830 
addressed in free agency but I think
they<00:01:08.490> still<00:01:08.730> have<00:01:08.940> to<00:01:09.030> find<00:01:09.240> ways<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.659> increase

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
they still have to find ways to increase

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.140 
they still have to find ways to increase

I<00:01:36.520> think<00:01:37.180> Utah<00:01:37.479> State<00:01:37.750> center<00:01:38.080> Tyler<00:01:38.320> Lawson

I think Utah State center Tyler Lawson

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.320 
I think Utah State center Tyler Lawson
would<00:01:39.040> instantly<00:01:39.520> upgrade<00:01:39.760> the<00:01:40.119> center

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
would instantly upgrade the center

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.390 
would instantly upgrade the center
position<00:01:40.420> for<00:01:40.840> the<00:01:40.960> Redskins<00:01:41.140> Larson<00:01:41.860> is<00:01:42.010> the

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
position for the Redskins Larson is the

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:44.399 
position for the Redskins Larson is the
best<00:01:42.670> center<00:01:43.060> prospect<00:01:43.570> in<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:43.780> country<00:01:44.140> of

best center prospect in the country of
my<00:01:44.530> honest<00:01:44.800> opinion<00:01:45.130> who<00:01:45.220> consistently

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
my honest opinion who consistently

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.000 
my honest opinion who consistently
greeted<00:01:46.150> out<00:01:46.270> in<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:46.869> 90s<00:01:47.260> he's<00:01:47.409> athletic<00:01:47.560> and

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
greeted out in the 90s he's athletic and

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:49.649 
greeted out in the 90s he's athletic and
his<00:01:48.130> football<00:01:48.460> IQ<00:01:48.580> is<00:01:48.940> off<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.270> charts<00:01:49.540> and

his football IQ is off the charts and

his football IQ is off the charts and
he'd<00:01:49.810> be<00:01:49.930> a<00:01:49.960> great<00:01:50.140> fit<00:01:50.440> for<00:01:50.680> the<00:01:51.040> Redskins

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
like I mentioned earlier the Redskins

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:04.260 
like I mentioned earlier the Redskins
have<00:02:02.619> to<00:02:02.770> get<00:02:02.920> better<00:02:03.100> at<00:02:03.369> wide<00:02:03.640> receiver<00:02:03.670> and

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
have to get better at wide receiver and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.880 
have to get better at wide receiver and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
think it makes a lot of sense to add a
