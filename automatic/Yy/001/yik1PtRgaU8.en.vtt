00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.009 
alright so there there's a neatly
wrapped<00:04:06.620> little<00:04:07.099> foot<00:04:07.480> there<00:04:08.480> just<00:04:08.720> from<00:04:08.840> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
wrapped little foot there just from the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:12.850 
wrapped little foot there just from the
bottom<00:04:10.000> there<00:04:11.000> it<00:04:11.180> is<00:04:11.299> from<00:04:11.599> the<00:04:11.720> top<00:04:11.930> his

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
bottom there it is from the top his

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.470 
bottom there it is from the top his
little<00:04:13.069> toe<00:04:13.280> can<00:04:13.519> go<00:04:13.670> backwards<00:04:14.120> the<00:04:14.209> way<00:04:14.390> it

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
little toe can go backwards the way it

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.640 
little toe can go backwards the way it
wants<00:04:14.750> to<00:04:14.900> go<00:04:15.100> it's<00:04:16.100> clean<00:04:16.489> its<00:04:16.790> padded<00:04:17.650> and

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:18.650 
wants to go it's clean its padded and

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.969 
wants to go it's clean its padded and
he's<00:04:19.609> ready<00:04:20.000> to<00:04:20.090> roll

00:04:20.969 --> 00:04:20.979 
he's ready to roll

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:27.040 
he's ready to roll
so<00:04:21.979> anyway<00:04:23.110> there<00:04:24.110> you<00:04:24.260> go<00:04:25.600> now<00:04:26.600> this<00:04:26.750> should

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050 
so anyway there you go now this should

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.580 
so anyway there you go now this should
last<00:04:27.260> for<00:04:27.770> about<00:04:28.250> a<00:04:28.280> day<00:04:28.580> or<00:04:28.729> two<00:04:28.940> and<00:04:29.590> then

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
last for about a day or two and then

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:32.350 
last for about a day or two and then
probably<00:04:31.340> he'll<00:04:31.520> get<00:04:31.639> muddy<00:04:31.880> and<00:04:31.970> he'll<00:04:32.240> need

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
probably he'll get muddy and he'll need

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.450 
probably he'll get muddy and he'll need
another<00:04:32.419> one<00:04:32.900> but<00:04:33.650> if<00:04:33.740> you<00:04:33.830> keep<00:04:34.010> doing<00:04:34.070> a

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
another one but if you keep doing a

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.909 
another one but if you keep doing a
little<00:04:34.639> Epsom<00:04:35.030> salt<00:04:35.300> back<00:04:35.510> and<00:04:35.930> then<00:04:36.530> a<00:04:36.560> little

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:36.919 
little Epsom salt back and then a little

00:04:36.919 --> 00:04:42.100 
little Epsom salt back and then a little
wash<00:04:38.770> and<00:04:39.770> then<00:04:40.340> you<00:04:40.460> put<00:04:40.669> him<00:04:40.900> in<00:04:41.900> a<00:04:41.990> little

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:42.110 
wash and then you put him in a little

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:44.890 
wash and then you put him in a little
pad<00:04:42.410> like<00:04:42.680> this<00:04:43.120> that<00:04:44.120> should<00:04:44.330> go<00:04:44.479> away<00:04:44.600> real

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
pad like this that should go away real

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.960 
pad like this that should go away real
soon<00:04:45.260> of<00:04:45.949> course<00:04:46.010> the<00:04:46.310> most<00:04:46.490> important<00:04:46.940> thing

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
soon of course the most important thing

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.070 
soon of course the most important thing
in<00:04:47.180> the<00:04:47.270> world<00:04:47.300> to<00:04:47.600> remember<00:04:47.780> about

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
in the world to remember about

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.629 
in the world to remember about
bumblefoot<00:04:48.530> is<00:04:48.680> it's<00:04:48.830> only<00:04:48.949> gonna<00:04:49.190> happen

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
bumblefoot is it's only gonna happen

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.790 
bumblefoot is it's only gonna happen
because<00:04:50.419> their<00:04:50.780> foot<00:04:51.169> doesn't<00:04:51.470> get<00:04:51.590> enough

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:51.800 
because their foot doesn't get enough

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.469 
because their foot doesn't get enough
air<00:04:52.100> or<00:04:52.310> there's<00:04:52.850> too<00:04:53.090> much<00:04:53.210> moisture

00:04:53.469 --> 00:04:53.479

underneath where they're sitting on a
regular<00:04:56.030> basis<00:04:56.449> so<00:04:56.479> if<00:04:56.780> you<00:04:56.900> keep<00:04:57.080> your<00:04:57.199> stalls

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:00.040 
regular basis so if you keep your stalls
dry<00:04:57.949> and<00:04:58.490> if<00:04:58.940> you<00:04:59.030> provide<00:04:59.330> them<00:04:59.479> with<00:04:59.630> varied
