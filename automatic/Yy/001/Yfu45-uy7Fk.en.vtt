00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
obviously they took notice of her in how

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.060 
obviously they took notice of her in how
is<00:00:42.870> she<00:00:42.960> gonna<00:00:43.079> get<00:00:43.230> out<00:00:43.379> of<00:00:43.410> this<00:00:43.530> obviously

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
is she gonna get out of this obviously

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.639 
is she gonna get out of this obviously
we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.370> bond<00:00:44.789> each<00:00:44.940> other<00:00:45.149> AK<00:00:45.539> we<00:00:46.050> had<00:00:46.170> Lucas

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
we have bond each other AK we had Lucas

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.440 
we have bond each other AK we had Lucas
machete<00:00:47.129> and<00:00:47.399> then<00:00:47.730> everybody<00:00:48.180> else<00:00:48.210> had

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
machete and then everybody else had

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.670 
machete and then everybody else had
their<00:00:48.539> own<00:00:48.600> weapons<00:00:48.780> so<00:00:49.110> they<00:00:49.140> can<00:00:49.320> probably

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
their own weapons so they can probably

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.369 
their own weapons so they can probably
you<00:00:49.860> just<00:00:50.219> take<00:00:50.489> out<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:51.000> bunch<00:00:51.480> of<00:00:51.629> them<00:00:51.780> they

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
you just take out a bunch of them they

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:53.900 
you just take out a bunch of them they
won't<00:00:52.530> really<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.949> rid<00:00:53.100> of<00:00:53.160> all<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.550> them<00:00:53.699> but

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
won't really get rid of all of them but

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.250 
won't really get rid of all of them but
I<00:00:53.969> can<00:00:54.149> see<00:00:54.300> them<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:54.570> enough<00:00:55.020> fighting

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
I can see them actually enough fighting

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.959 
I can see them actually enough fighting
through<00:00:55.559> them<00:00:55.710> just<00:00:56.340> getting<00:00:56.610> out<00:00:56.730> of<00:00:56.760> there

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
through them just getting out of there

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.700 
through them just getting out of there
and<00:00:57.149> then<00:00:57.270> running<00:00:57.449> away<00:00:57.539> so<00:00:57.750> now<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> could

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
and then running away so now this could

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.770 
and then running away so now this could
be<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.890> different<00:00:59.250> scenario<00:00:59.579> if<00:01:00.059> Serena<00:01:00.570> gets

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
be a different scenario if Serena gets

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.299 
be a different scenario if Serena gets
her<00:01:00.870> arm<00:01:01.109> chopped<00:01:01.410> off<00:01:01.620> because<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.280> know

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
her arm chopped off because as you know

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.640 
her arm chopped off because as you know
she<00:01:02.489> screams<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.390> can<00:01:03.539> attract<00:01:03.840> walkers<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
she screams and I can attract walkers so

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.429 
she screams and I can attract walkers so
I<00:01:04.920> can<00:01:05.489> cause<00:01:05.790> more<00:01:06.090> problems<00:01:06.420> possibly<00:01:07.200> she

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
I can cause more problems possibly she

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.070 
I can cause more problems possibly she
even<00:01:07.830> dying<00:01:08.100> but<00:01:08.939> I<00:01:09.210> really<00:01:09.630> hope<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:09.930> she

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
even dying but I really hope that she

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.370 
even dying but I really hope that she
won't<00:01:10.229> die<00:01:10.500> like<00:01:10.740> right<00:01:11.159> after<00:01:12.049> the<00:01:13.049> fact<00:01:13.290> that

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380
