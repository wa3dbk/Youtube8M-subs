00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
singers I'm thinking why don't they

singers I'm thinking why don't they
release<00:00:21.210> it<00:00:21.630> this<00:00:21.990> next<00:00:22.230> song<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.470> guy<00:00:22.710> that

release it this next song the guy that
sang<00:00:23.130> on<00:00:23.220> it<00:00:23.310> was<00:00:23.660> unbelievable<00:00:24.720> but<00:00:25.140> for<00:00:25.289> some

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
sang on it was unbelievable but for some

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.439 
sang on it was unbelievable but for some
reason<00:00:25.609> maybe<00:00:26.609> he<00:00:26.699> didn't<00:00:26.880> have<00:00:26.970> a<00:00:27.029> contract

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
reason maybe he didn't have a contract

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:29.120 
reason maybe he didn't have a contract
with<00:00:27.510> a<00:00:27.599> company<00:00:27.660> or<00:00:28.170> whatever<00:00:28.320> but<00:00:28.590> I<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.980> it

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
with a company or whatever but I got it

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.209 
with a company or whatever but I got it
how<00:00:29.670> lucky<00:00:29.820> can<00:00:29.970> you<00:00:30.119> get<00:00:30.330> so<00:00:31.170> I<00:00:31.500> needed<00:00:32.040> to

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
how lucky can you get so I needed to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:34.459 
how lucky can you get so I needed to
know<00:00:32.309> what<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.550> was<00:00:32.640> about<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:33.110> the<00:00:34.110> producer

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
know what it was about and the producer

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:36.139 
know what it was about and the producer
helped<00:00:34.649> me<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.739> great<00:00:34.920> deal<00:00:34.950> with<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.370> song<00:00:35.579> in

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
helped me a great deal with this song in

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.799 
helped me a great deal with this song in
terms<00:00:36.420> of<00:00:36.570> getting<00:00:36.719> the<00:00:36.840> feel<00:00:37.050> for<00:00:37.079> it<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:37.649> I

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
terms of getting the feel for it and I

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.569 
terms of getting the feel for it and I
thought<00:00:39.809> maybe<00:00:40.020> it<00:00:40.200> was<00:00:40.290> a<00:00:40.350> war<00:00:41.010> song<00:00:41.250> or<00:00:41.489> an

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
thought maybe it was a war song or an

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:43.970 
thought maybe it was a war song or an
anti-war<00:00:42.090> song<00:00:42.360> but<00:00:43.290> I'm<00:00:43.379> not<00:00:43.500> sure<00:00:43.710> that<00:00:43.860> it

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
anti-war song but I'm not sure that it

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.500 
anti-war song but I'm not sure that it
is<00:00:44.040> entirely<00:00:44.430> although<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.030> a<00:00:45.120> war<00:00:45.329> of<00:00:45.420> a

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
is entirely although it's a war of a

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:52.000 
is entirely although it's a war of a
type<00:00:45.719> you<00:00:46.710> know<00:00:47.930> we<00:00:48.930> need<00:00:49.140> to<00:00:49.350> fight<00:00:50.160> for<00:00:50.579> love

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:52.010 
type you know we need to fight for love

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.520 
type you know we need to fight for love
faith<00:00:53.010> hope<00:00:53.969> fight<00:00:54.510> but<00:00:54.719> not<00:00:54.870> kill<00:00:55.110> for<00:00:55.410> it

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
faith hope fight but not kill for it

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.439 
faith hope fight but not kill for it
there<00:00:55.890> is<00:00:55.980> no<00:00:56.129> need<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.370> kill<00:00:56.550> for<00:00:56.760> it<00:00:56.850> just

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
there is no need to kill for it just

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:05.649 
there is no need to kill for it just
stand<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> for<00:00:57.989> those<00:00:58.350> things<00:00:58.879> so

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:05.659 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:07.749 

my<00:01:06.200> belief<00:01:06.470> is<00:01:06.650> that<00:01:06.680> this<00:01:07.159> song<00:01:07.460> should

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 
my belief is that this song should

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:10.450 
my belief is that this song should
encourage<00:01:08.240> those<00:01:08.570> of<00:01:08.630> us<00:01:08.900> who<00:01:09.049> care<00:01:09.320> to<00:01:10.280> be

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
encourage those of us who care to be

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:36.080 
encourage those of us who care to be
