tortoise tallest building in Britain so

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.180 
tortoise tallest building in Britain so
this<00:02:18.660> must<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:18.989> is<00:02:19.170> actually<00:02:19.500> Tallis<00:02:19.829> office

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:20.190 
this must be is actually Tallis office

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.490 
this must be is actually Tallis office
space<00:02:20.579> in<00:02:20.879> the<00:02:21.030> city<00:02:21.209> I<00:02:21.660> mean<00:02:21.989> obviously<00:02:22.140> the

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
space in the city I mean obviously the

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.940 
space in the city I mean obviously the
the<00:02:23.099> the<00:02:24.000> shard<00:02:24.269> is<00:02:24.480> taller<00:02:24.900> this<00:02:25.739> is<00:02:25.920> a

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950 
the the shard is taller this is a

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:28.520 
the the shard is taller this is a
special<00:02:26.459> flawless<00:02:27.030> because<00:02:27.930> this<00:02:28.349> is<00:02:28.500> a

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
special flawless because this is a

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.190 
special flawless because this is a
double<00:02:28.769> high<00:02:29.239> the<00:02:30.239> principle<00:02:30.720> of<00:02:30.810> this<00:02:30.989> is

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
double high the principle of this is

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.770 
double high the principle of this is
that<00:02:31.379> these<00:02:31.530> big<00:02:31.829> things<00:02:32.129> here<00:02:32.579> are<00:02:33.389> using

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
that these big things here are using

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.770 
that these big things here are using
brute<00:02:34.109> strength<00:02:34.500> to<00:02:35.459> tie<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:36.180> this<00:02:36.450> big

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
brute strength to tie down this big

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.809 
brute strength to tie down this big
perimeter<00:02:37.440> Daiya<00:02:38.280> grid

00:02:38.809 --> 00:02:38.819 
perimeter Daiya grid

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:40.789 
perimeter Daiya grid
they're<00:02:39.209> basically<00:02:39.510> restraining<00:02:40.470> it<00:02:40.560> because

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:40.799 
they're basically restraining it because

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:45.170 
they're basically restraining it because
it<00:02:40.950> expands<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:41.790> contract<00:02:43.099> so<00:02:44.099> the<00:02:44.669> movements

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
it expands the contract so the movements

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.360 
it expands the contract so the movements
in<00:02:45.359> this<00:02:45.510> are<00:02:45.690> extraordinary<00:02:46.650> really<00:02:46.829> so

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
in this are extraordinary really so

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:48.949 
in this are extraordinary really so
these<00:02:47.549> these<00:02:47.910> are<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.239> toilets<00:02:48.780> that<00:02:48.900> are

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:48.959 
these these are the toilets that are

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:52.460 
these these are the toilets that are
basically<00:02:49.530> inserted<00:02:50.280> into<00:02:50.700> a<00:02:51.470> non-active

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:52.470 
basically inserted into a non-active

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:55.129 
basically inserted into a non-active
lift<00:02:52.950> lobbies<00:02:53.340> so<00:02:54.000> you'll<00:02:54.180> see<00:02:54.480> the<00:02:54.690> colors<00:02:55.109> of

00:02:55.129 --> 00:02:55.139 
lift lobbies so you'll see the colors of

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.009 
lift lobbies so you'll see the colors of
these<00:02:55.530> from<00:02:55.980> outside<00:02:56.459> you<00:02:57.090> will<00:02:57.329> see<00:02:57.599> moving

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
these from outside you will see moving

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:00.860 
these from outside you will see moving
lips<00:02:58.400> coming<00:02:59.400> across<00:02:59.730> this<00:03:00.060> surface<00:03:00.389> so

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
lips coming across this surface so

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.569 
lips coming across this surface so
there's<00:03:01.079> a<00:03:01.169> kind<00:03:01.349> of<00:03:01.470> certain<00:03:01.799> dynamism<00:03:02.280> but

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:02.579 
there's a kind of certain dynamism but

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:05.800 
there's a kind of certain dynamism but
they're<00:03:03.120> probably<00:03:03.359> the<00:03:03.569> most<00:03:04.730> beautifully

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
they're probably the most beautifully

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.240 
they're probably the most beautifully
naturally<00:03:06.810> daily<00:03:07.169> toilets<00:03:07.739> because<00:03:07.950> along

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:17.639 
is all working immensely hard none of it

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:19.520 
is all working immensely hard none of it
is<00:03:17.669> covered<00:03:18.090> or<00:03:18.419> decorative<00:03:18.810> but<00:03:19.260> it<00:03:19.380> really

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.280 
has a sense

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.820 
has a sense
tensions<00:03:20.700> yeah<00:03:20.940> because<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:22.110> you<00:03:22.440> hit<00:03:22.650> this

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:22.830 
tensions yeah because it you hit this

tensions yeah because it you hit this
stuff<00:03:23.069> I<00:03:23.690> think<00:03:24.690> one<00:03:25.050> of<00:03:25.080> the<00:03:25.230> thin<00:03:25.440> ones<00:03:25.680> isn't

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
stuff I think one of the thin ones isn't

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:29.630 
stuff I think one of the thin ones isn't
it<00:03:27.470> the<00:03:28.470> other<00:03:28.620> ones<00:03:28.770> you<00:03:28.860> hit<00:03:29.040> your<00:03:29.280> knuckles

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
it the other ones you hit your knuckles

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:33.320 
it the other ones you hit your knuckles
just<00:03:29.850> come<00:03:30.120> off<00:03:31.490> views<00:03:32.490> this<00:03:32.730> good<00:03:33.000> would<00:03:33.209> have

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
just come off views this good would have

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.210 
just come off views this good would have
been<00:03:33.450> unthinkable<00:03:33.660> when<00:03:34.380> Lloyd's<00:03:34.650> was<00:03:34.950> built

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
been unthinkable when Lloyd's was built

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.729 
been unthinkable when Lloyd's was built
for<00:03:36.150> years<00:03:36.420> nothing<00:03:36.900> could<00:03:37.080> be<00:03:37.200> taller<00:03:37.440> than

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
for years nothing could be taller than

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.910 
for years nothing could be taller than
the<00:03:37.830> 42<00:03:38.310> storey<00:03:38.700> NatWest<00:03:39.239> tower<00:03:39.620> but<00:03:40.620> since

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
the 42 storey NatWest tower but since

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.949 
the 42 storey NatWest tower but since
the<00:03:41.069> Millennium<00:03:41.209> pressure<00:03:42.209> has<00:03:42.450> grown<00:03:42.720> to

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
the Millennium pressure has grown to

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.410 
the Millennium pressure has grown to
intensify<00:03:43.590> the<00:03:43.800> use<00:03:44.160> of<00:03:44.340> expensive<00:03:44.940> land<00:03:45.150> in

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
intensify the use of expensive land in

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.840 
intensify the use of expensive land in
the<00:03:45.510> city<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:46.140> skyscrapers<00:03:46.980> have<00:03:47.610> risen

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:47.850 
the city and skyscrapers have risen

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.140 
the city and skyscrapers have risen
higher<00:03:48.180> and<00:03:48.450> higher<00:03:48.870> I<00:03:50.030> think<00:03:51.030> there's

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:51.150 
higher and higher I think there's

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:53.870 
higher and higher I think there's
nothing<00:03:51.239> more<00:03:51.569> depressing<00:03:52.340> then<00:03:53.340> go<00:03:53.519> in<00:03:53.640> some

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:53.880 
nothing more depressing then go in some

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.340 
nothing more depressing then go in some
way<00:03:54.060> that<00:03:54.090> you<00:03:54.390> remembered<00:03:54.900> as<00:03:54.989> being<00:03:55.019> very

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
way that you remembered as being very

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:58.160 
way that you remembered as being very
beautiful<00:03:56.070> especially<00:03:57.000> in<00:03:57.420> greenbelt<00:03:57.840> terms

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
beautiful especially in greenbelt terms

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:00.650 
beautiful especially in greenbelt terms
I<00:03:58.500> think<00:03:59.340> it's<00:03:59.489> best<00:03:59.760> to<00:03:59.850> intensify<00:04:00.450> and

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
I think it's best to intensify and

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.860 
I think it's best to intensify and
create<00:04:01.080> human<00:04:01.800> humane<00:04:02.580> environments<00:04:03.300> by

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
create human humane environments by

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:05.479 
create human humane environments by
intensifying<00:04:04.290> land<00:04:04.680> that's<00:04:04.890> already<00:04:05.220> been

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
intensifying land that's already been

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.030 
intensifying land that's already been
spoiled<00:04:06.090> the<00:04:06.720> problem<00:04:07.319> would<00:04:07.440> be<00:04:07.650> if<00:04:07.800> you<00:04:07.920> got

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
spoiled the problem would be if you got

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.280 
spoiled the problem would be if you got
tall<00:04:08.310> buildings<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.970> gave<00:04:09.180> nothing<00:04:09.420> yeah<00:04:10.080> at

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
tall buildings that gave nothing yeah at

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.259 
tall buildings that gave nothing yeah at
the<00:04:10.440> ground<00:04:10.680> level<00:04:10.830> or<00:04:11.220> had<00:04:11.640> nothing<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.259 --> 00:04:12.269 
the ground level or had nothing of

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:15.140 
the ground level or had nothing of
qualities<00:04:12.810> that<00:04:13.080> would<00:04:13.700> allow<00:04:14.700> people<00:04:14.940> to

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:15.150 
qualities that would allow people to

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:16.789 
qualities that would allow people to
take<00:04:15.450> them<00:04:15.600> to<00:04:15.750> their<00:04:15.870> hearts<00:04:16.260> I<00:04:16.410> think<00:04:16.620> that

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
take them to their hearts I think that
