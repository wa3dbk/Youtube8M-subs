00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.539
 this morning we are going to load a 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.709
 USB memory that contains 100 rhythms at 

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:16.260
 psr 433 we simply insert the 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:19.900
 memory in this part of the keyboard by 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.880
 here has a meeting a slot 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.270
 it's a little bit uncomfortable to find that 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.460
 entry to less than what 

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:28.539
 that we have an area where we can 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.609
 look more easily 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.329
 already inserted the light begins to 

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:36.129
 blinking a red light nothing else we 

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:39.519
 we wait for that light to become fixed and 

00:00:36.129 --> 00:00:41.710
 solid then we can already work with 

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:44.649
 memory like in this case just 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.839
 happen the light is fixed and once 

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:50.979
 it's fixed we're going to go to a button 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:52.720
 which includes this keyboard function and 

00:00:50.979 --> 00:00:55.260
 it's also the same one that says fault 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:55.260
 control 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.770
 we press it once nothing happens 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.630
 so what are we going to do when 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:04.159
 press you have to press but without 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:06.229
 release 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:12.000
 so when we do this in the 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:14.550
 screen shows the word load style 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:19.630
 once we are there we go back to 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:21.579
 press the same execute button 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.189
 in this case it would be forgiveness on the button 

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:26.579
 execute that is what corresponds to the 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.579
 zero 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:34.450
 then the memory is already open 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.850
 we can start to see the content of the 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.860
 memory that would be the rhythms and for 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:42.190
 change or see the rhythm menu 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:44.979
 let's move the rotating roller the 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:46.909
 which is here simply to 

00:01:44.979 --> 00:01:48.619
 move it 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:50.060
 if you can see both the 

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:52.490
 roller and the screen at the same time 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.560
 every time we move it 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.780
 we are going to be changing rhythms 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.890
 I'm turning it and it's showing more and 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:02.140
 more rhythms the memory 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.040
 forgive those who are inside the 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:10.570
 memory then in this case 

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.570
 let's load a rhythm 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.200
 for example let's load 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.379
 at any rate it could be but 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.700
 let's load this rhythm with stew 

00:02:20.379 --> 00:02:25.540
 Nidera 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:29.400
 let's go to the execute button once 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:29.400
 more than is the one that corresponds to zero 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:35.830
 then on the screen he asks us in 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 where do we want to load this keyboard 

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:44.320
 it only has room to load 5 rhythms 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.450
 the first rhythm is 187 from 187 

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:48.670
 up to 100 91 can be charged 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:50.530
 rhythms then here the keyboard is 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.540
 wondering what I want to load in the 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:57.970
 bank 187 in case I already have 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:00.430
 something there in 187 when we already have a 

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:03.760
 used keyboard that is not like this that 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:07.150
 is new and we want to save it in another 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.640
 bank not so we turn the roller 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.740
 example there is 100 91 if we give it 

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.750
 more turn starts again in 187 

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:16.630
 because we only have 5 places where 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:21.630
 save the rhythms in this case I'm going to 

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:24.730
 then store in the 187 

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:27.400
 once it is already selected 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.170
 let's put run once again to 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.540
 press 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.040
 and on the screen it shows the word load 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:39.130
 ok then if we want to load it 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:41.620
 so let's say yes for this 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:44.450
 we are going to press button 10 that 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:48.230
 found below 9 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:51.100
 then on the screen go to a 

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.100
 word will appear that says the login 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:54.100
 loading 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:04:01.400
 when this word 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.959
 be removed and show that it has already been 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.989
 already the kingdom has been charged then already 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:07.989
 we can go directly to play the rhythm 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.460
 it takes a few seconds because the keyboard 

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.210
 because within its capabilities is a 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.210
 little basic 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:25.990
 completed then we are ready 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.470
 to play the rhythm then simply 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:32.220
 we press the style style button and 

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:32.220
 we turn here 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:38.930
 on the roller 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:42.290
 and we go to 187 there cumbia appears 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:43.970
 that leader start to activate the rhythm 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.100
 we forget that the button 

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:49.210
 accompaniment is on 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:50.800
 true 

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:55.650
 when it's on here in the 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.650
 screen shows accompaniment 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:06.860
 the word below says accompaniment 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:08.900
 or when I pressed the same button 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:11.930
 that I showed them goes off then every 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:13.669
 Once it's that way, it 's because the rhythm 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:15.970
 accompaniment of the rhythm is on 

00:05:13.669 --> 00:05:19.550
 here is off here is on 

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:22.540
 then once that's done we're going to 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:24.790
 press the button without being 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:26.740
 and immediately we can put a 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:28.900
 any tone 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:39.820
 let's say let's put the tone of the fa 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:42.240
 greater good I thought that this was the 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:46.450
 cumbia sonidera is a cumbia salsa 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:48.160
 then we already load at a rate of 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.750
 cumbia the problem of why I 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:51.670
 I confused right now thinking that it was a 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.520
 cumbia sounds and really is a 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.070
 cumbia of salsa or cumbia is raised fairy is 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.750
 because the keyboard menu in the 

00:05:57.070 --> 00:06:01.540
 screen does not show the full name 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.580
 of each rhythm the keyboards more here a 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.370
 slightly more expensive more large show 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.290
 the full name in this case that 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:10.750
 keyboard only part of the name 

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:12.490
 of the good rhythm in this case we already load 

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:14.900
 a rhythm and in this way of equal 

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:17.410
 way we can load any other 

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:17.410
 good thank you
