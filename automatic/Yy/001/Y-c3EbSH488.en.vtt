00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:03.370 

I<00:02:00.670> really<00:02:01.670> love<00:02:01.850> things<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:02.360> rosewood<00:02:03.080> and

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:03.380 
I really love things like rosewood and

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.190 
I really love things like rosewood and
sound<00:02:04.130> or<00:02:04.340> wood<00:02:04.520> added<00:02:04.940> to<00:02:05.210> sweet<00:02:05.750> sense<00:02:06.020> or

floor<00:02:06.440> sense<00:02:06.770> I<00:02:06.950> think<00:02:06.980> it<00:02:07.190> gives<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.460> a<00:02:07.520> really

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:07.730 
floor sense I think it gives it a really

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:09.700 
floor sense I think it gives it a really
nice<00:02:07.940> earthy<00:02:08.479> tone<00:02:08.750> and<00:02:08.990> thus<00:02:09.140> balances<00:02:09.590> it

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:09.710 
nice earthy tone and thus balances it
