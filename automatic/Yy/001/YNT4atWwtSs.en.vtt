00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.990
 hi friends, I already shot a movie about 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:09.950
 how is the time on the team set up here for 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.929
 those who have such a problem 

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:15.630
 the question arose and now I would like too 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:19.760
 it's about time to tell or show 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.330
 but only with modified encodings 

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:24.720
 dashboard 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:28.140
 my time is different now 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:30.810
 I think some people may 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:34.469
 the same time is set here 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.750
 through the dashboard and since this 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.170
 being done means we go into this 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.129
 menu 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:45.960
 well we reach we select we leaf through networks and 

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:50.250
 keys start moving means 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:50.940
 us here it is different and the menu here and here 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.690
 we reached 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.300
 this is our minute the next hour hand and 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.270
 here we are 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:04.949
 keys to these plus or minus choose 

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:08.729
 time here we expose it to us 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:13.770
 1812 appears for example now I tell you 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:16.979
 show right minute put 13 minutes to 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:22.220
 You see immediately changed 13 minutes 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:25.409
 Dad was also on the team for 13 minutes 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.450
 so here we get feedback 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:31.340
 if for those who have another encoding 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:34.159
 are we on whom go set the time and 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:37.409
 respectively on the instrument panel with us 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.790
 time is synchronized with the commands if 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:41.850
 someone else encoding 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.549
 instrument panel there depending on the year 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.540
 release for example yes or country of issue 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.729
 up what car was made 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.439
 feedback occurs that is on 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.759
 the instrument panel through the keys we 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.790
 set the time and it's through for 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.680
 minute 2 synchronizes with the commands 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.100
 whatever time I put now 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.030
 here 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.149
 manually in two minutes it will become 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.190
 exactly the way we put it on 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.610
 instrument panel 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:16.240
 like this 2 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:20.230
 two ways there is to set the time it 

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:23.710
 on the team for the instrument panel and on the panel 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.190
 through the keys the synchronization happens with 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.670
 the team 

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.350
 here is such a tricky connection here but again 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:33.580
 does it all depend on Kadyrov who 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:35.230
 you are in the dashboard is why I would like 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.540
 advise those people who 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.330
 going to change the instrument panel 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.380
 but for some reason yes there came out 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.040
 building was kindled 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.870
 and so on here when you buy 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.690
 you should look at him 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:55.030
 number on it or at least to be 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:57.459
 similar equipment because 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.320
 that they may be different and year 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:01.630
 desirable to match because 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.230
 even the weather can be a different menu 

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:09.160
 sewn up here this example through 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:12.489
 keys expose yes on the dashboard of someone 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.290
 through the rooms to put on the dashboard then 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:18.989
 time to change that is at all all of 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:21.850
 so differently try to find 

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:25.110
 it looks like the weather 

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:28.690
 engine displacement this shield because 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:35.049
 if you take a valid instrument panel 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:37.360
 from the car that had a ski hatch 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:39.640
 as the so -called yes that is he for 10 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.830
 liters this bug is less then you 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:44.890
 accordingly it will be possible not 

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:47.140
 correctly show fuel level or 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.040
 fuel consumption will be incorrect because 

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:53.380
 that this is a different encoding shield protection 

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.510
 strangely enough strangely I am 

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.650
 personally checked 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:00.870
 if the software version is for 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:04.600
 psp 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.940
 after 2000 for example yes in the shield 

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:10.810
 protection as it may not strange, all these are connected 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.320
 you have a car until 2000 then you have 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:16.720
 to the extent that her back works 

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:20.560
 You see, I personally checked it this way and 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.690
 there is when we change the release in encodings 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:25.480
 car program will be provided 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.600
 let's say 2002 but itâ€™s so conditional 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:32.740
 then the bleed icon disappears by 

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:35.710
 the key works but everything will react as 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:39.780
 would be fine so if you 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:43.720
 put a shield from another car and 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:47.050
 you got errors so the display 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:49.360
 effective there is still there some kind of 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:51.910
 hrenovina there either you showed that you 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:54.400
 Incorrect consumption shows too 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.680
 small level too big 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.600
 fuel incorrectly indicates this because 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:04.330
 they are these encodings 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.050
 dashboard does not match your car 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:11.380
 it can be corrected it can be it 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:15.340
 transcode either manually to with 

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:17.970
 settings or drag your shield 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.800
 copy encoding rearrange 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:24.790
 perezalit and and your new one here is actually 

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:27.100
 this problem is solved therefore the conclusion 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:30.010
 what less problems 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:32.590
 pick up the shield according to your car 

00:05:30.010 --> 00:05:35.100
 year of release preferably at least by year 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:38.830
 release because then there may be 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:41.730
 shoals all but not corrected by any 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.560
 case therefore such information 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.660
 digest and here who has such 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.960
 problems are already in principle they are solved 

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:54.659
 you will need respectively through 

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:57.189
 computer change encodings like this 

00:05:54.659 --> 00:06:00.870
 interesting information for those who do not 

00:05:57.189 --> 00:06:00.870
 passed everyone happy
