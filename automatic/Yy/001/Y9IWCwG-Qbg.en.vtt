abandoned<00:04:14.170> two<00:04:14.500> years<00:04:14.739> ago<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.519> i<00:04:16.269> was

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:16.299 
abandoned two years ago and i was

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:18.479 
abandoned two years ago and i was
talking<00:04:16.690> to<00:04:16.720> Jeff<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.380> about<00:04:18.100> our<00:04:18.310> situation

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:18.489 
talking to Jeff and about our situation

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.690 
talking to Jeff and about our situation
he<00:04:19.120> says<00:04:19.299> look<00:04:19.450> on<00:04:19.630> come<00:04:19.840> out<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.290> all<00:04:20.590> so<00:04:21.430> what

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:21.700 
he says look on come out and all so what

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:23.190 
he says look on come out and all so what
the<00:04:21.850> setup<00:04:22.030> is<00:04:22.300> and<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:22.660> give<00:04:22.870> you<00:04:22.990> some

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:23.200 
the setup is and then give you some

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.070 
the setup is and then give you some
advice<00:04:23.290> on<00:04:23.830> what<00:04:24.280> to<00:04:24.340> do<00:04:24.810> probably<00:04:25.810> one<00:04:25.900> of<00:04:25.930> the

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
advice on what to do probably one of the

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:28.830 
advice on what to do probably one of the
best<00:04:26.230> decisions<00:04:26.380> we<00:04:26.860> made<00:04:27.220> to<00:04:27.639> really<00:04:28.120> control

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
best decisions we made to really control

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:31.200 
best decisions we made to really control
our<00:04:29.080> animals<00:04:29.620> in<00:04:29.860> a<00:04:30.250> given<00:04:30.550> area<00:04:30.700> around<00:04:31.030> the

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:31.210 
our animals in a given area around the

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:34.110 
our animals in a given area around the
farm<00:04:31.479> so<00:04:31.840> Jeff<00:04:32.050> came<00:04:32.290> out<00:04:32.530> and<00:04:32.790> said<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:33.970> know

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
farm so Jeff came out and said you know

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.719 
farm so Jeff came out and said you know
that<00:04:34.750> sort<00:04:35.290> of<00:04:35.410> equipment<00:04:35.680> I'll<00:04:36.280> set<00:04:36.520> it<00:04:36.550> up

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
that sort of equipment I'll set it up

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.180 
that sort of equipment I'll set it up
for<00:04:36.760> you<00:04:37.150> we<00:04:37.810> then<00:04:37.990> set<00:04:38.229> the<00:04:38.380> fences<00:04:38.680> up<00:04:38.830> so<00:04:39.010> we

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
for you we then set the fences up so we

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:41.310 
for you we then set the fences up so we
could<00:04:39.310> isolate<00:04:39.460> that<00:04:40.090> half<00:04:40.660> the<00:04:40.690> farm<00:04:41.139> from

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:41.320 
could isolate that half the farm from

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.830 
could isolate that half the farm from
that<00:04:41.530> half<00:04:41.770> the<00:04:41.800> fun<00:04:42.280> and<00:04:42.639> if<00:04:43.479> it<00:04:43.660> was<00:04:43.750> a

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
that half the fun and if it was a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:45.930 
that half the fun and if it was a
trouble<00:04:44.590> or<00:04:44.680> a<00:04:44.710> short<00:04:45.010> somewhere<00:04:45.370> we<00:04:45.820> could

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940 
trouble or a short somewhere we could

00:04:45.940 --> 00:04:47.730 
trouble or a short somewhere we could
isolate<00:04:46.060> it<00:04:46.540> just<00:04:46.900> a<00:04:46.960> care<00:04:47.169> should<00:04:47.380> we<00:04:47.560> can

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:47.740 
isolate it just a care should we can

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.230 
isolate it just a care should we can
hear<00:04:47.950> what's<00:04:48.130> going<00:04:48.220> on<00:04:48.550> with<00:04:48.700> the<00:04:48.790> ticking<00:04:49.090> we

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:49.240 
hear what's going on with the ticking we

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.110 
hear what's going on with the ticking we
also<00:04:49.479> know<00:04:49.950> when<00:04:50.950> it<00:04:51.040> says<00:04:51.250> a<00:04:51.280> signal<00:04:51.820> that

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
also know when it says a signal that

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.450 
also know when it says a signal that
there's<00:04:52.360> a<00:04:52.450> shortage<00:04:52.840> of<00:04:52.960> what<00:04:53.110> happen<00:04:53.410> at<00:04:54.280> any

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
there's a shortage of what happen at any

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.340 
there's a shortage of what happen at any
time<00:04:54.550> we<00:04:54.970> need<00:04:55.210> to<00:04:55.330> work<00:04:55.510> on<00:04:55.660> the<00:04:55.810> fence<00:04:56.080> with<00:04:56.290> a

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:56.350 
time we need to work on the fence with a

00:04:56.350 --> 00:04:59.250 
time we need to work on the fence with a
little<00:04:57.060> gadget<00:04:58.060> we<00:04:58.180> could<00:04:58.330> just<00:04:58.510> cut<00:04:59.110> the

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
little gadget we could just cut the

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.360 
little gadget we could just cut the
fence<00:04:59.410> off<00:04:59.650> we're<00:04:59.860> down<00:05:00.010> the<00:05:00.130> affair

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
fence off we're down the affair

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.010 
fence off we're down the affair
equipment<00:05:00.850> we<00:05:01.000> could<00:05:01.150> then<00:05:01.300> sort<00:05:01.780> the<00:05:01.870> problem

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:02.020 
equipment we could then sort the problem

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:05.790 
equipment we could then sort the problem
go<00:05:02.289> out<00:05:02.560> and<00:05:02.800> quickly<00:05:03.340> turn<00:05:03.669> it<00:05:03.789> back<00:05:03.970> on<00:05:04.000> so<00:05:04.800> we

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:05.800 
go out and quickly turn it back on so we

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:07.409 
go out and quickly turn it back on so we
can<00:05:05.830> still<00:05:06.190> maintain<00:05:06.370> the<00:05:06.789> voltage<00:05:06.820> around

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
can still maintain the voltage around

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.810 
can still maintain the voltage around
the<00:05:07.510> farm<00:05:07.800> source<00:05:08.800> of<00:05:08.919> power<00:05:09.070> came<00:05:09.400> from<00:05:09.430> the

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
the farm source of power came from the

the farm source of power came from the
neighbors<00:05:10.750> cowshed<00:05:11.880> it<00:05:12.880> was<00:05:13.030> dropping<00:05:13.360> in

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:13.450 
neighbors cowshed it was dropping in

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:16.140

dent<00:05:16.390> about<00:05:16.630> 1.2<00:05:17.380> and<00:05:17.590> it<00:05:17.710> was<00:05:17.800> not<00:05:18.039> a<00:05:18.070> really

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:18.490 
dent about 1.2 and it was not a really

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.610 
dent about 1.2 and it was not a really
good<00:05:18.669> setup<00:05:19.060> or<00:05:19.270> what<00:05:19.419> we<00:05:19.600> wanted<00:05:20.169> to<00:05:20.229> do<00:05:20.470> on

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:20.620 
good setup or what we wanted to do on

good setup or what we wanted to do on
the<00:05:20.710> phone<00:05:20.919> we<00:05:21.280> wanted<00:05:21.520> a<00:05:21.640> good<00:05:21.820> supply<00:05:22.180> of

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
the phone we wanted a good supply of

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.930 
the phone we wanted a good supply of
voltage<00:05:22.960> going<00:05:23.229> through<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.680> whole<00:05:23.860> farm<00:05:24.190> and

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
voltage going through the whole farm and

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.490 
voltage going through the whole farm and
that's<00:05:25.270> what<00:05:25.450> we're<00:05:25.630> done<00:05:25.810> we<00:05:25.960> put<00:05:26.169> that<00:05:26.200> right

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:26.500 
that's what we're done we put that right

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.629 
that's what we're done we put that right
through<00:05:26.740> follow<00:05:27.010> that<00:05:27.160> line<00:05:27.370> right<00:05:27.580> through

00:05:27.629 --> 00:05:27.639 
through follow that line right through

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.379 
through follow that line right through
there<00:05:28.090> now<00:05:28.270> we<00:05:28.900> now<00:05:29.080> have<00:05:29.550> something<00:05:30.550> like<00:05:30.700> 7.2

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
there now we now have something like 7.2

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:33.210 
there now we now have something like 7.2
going<00:05:31.660> through<00:05:31.900> at<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.020> back<00:05:32.320> which<00:05:33.010> is

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.220 
going through at the back which is

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:36.300 
going through at the back which is
highly<00:05:34.060> ample<00:05:34.360> for<00:05:34.539> what<00:05:34.780> with<00:05:35.169> God<00:05:35.500> any

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:36.310 
highly ample for what with God any

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:38.670 
highly ample for what with God any
pasture<00:05:36.850> thats<00:05:37.030> grows<00:05:37.360> very<00:05:37.720> quickly<00:05:37.870> and<00:05:38.470> we

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:38.680 
pasture thats grows very quickly and we

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:42.090 
pasture thats grows very quickly and we
need<00:05:38.919> to<00:05:39.220> offset<00:05:40.320> paddocks<00:05:41.320> shut<00:05:41.560> up<00:05:41.680> for

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
need to offset paddocks shut up for

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.629 
need to offset paddocks shut up for
silage<00:05:42.700> or<00:05:42.940> hey<00:05:43.780> we<00:05:44.169> then<00:05:44.410> block<00:05:45.160> raise<00:05:45.400> will

00:05:45.629 --> 00:05:45.639 
silage or hey we then block raise will

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:47.670 
silage or hey we then block raise will
put<00:05:45.820> electric<00:05:46.210> fence<00:05:46.450> across<00:05:46.630> half<00:05:47.229> way<00:05:47.470> and

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
put electric fence across half way and

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:50.399 
put electric fence across half way and
they<00:05:48.400> will<00:05:48.610> get<00:05:48.789> that<00:05:48.970> not<00:05:49.300> morning

00:05:50.399 --> 00:05:50.409 
they will get that not morning

00:05:50.409 --> 00:05:52.529 
they will get that not morning
and<00:05:50.529> then<00:05:51.039> that<00:05:51.639> will<00:05:51.819> then<00:05:51.999> be<00:05:52.119> shifted

00:05:52.529 --> 00:05:52.539 
and then that will then be shifted

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:54.839 
and then that will then be shifted
continuously<00:05:53.110> it<00:05:53.319> down<00:05:53.800> the<00:05:53.979> line<00:05:54.129> so<00:05:54.699> it

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:54.849 
continuously it down the line so it

00:05:54.849 --> 00:05:56.309 
continuously it down the line so it
rotates<00:05:55.360> around<00:05:55.569> and<00:05:55.959> then<00:05:56.050> we'll<00:05:56.169> do

00:05:56.309 --> 00:05:56.319 
rotates around and then we'll do

00:05:56.319 --> 00:05:58.409 
rotates around and then we'll do
complete<00:05:56.800> the<00:05:56.919> whole<00:05:57.129> farm<00:05:57.459> the<00:05:57.999> cost<00:05:58.269> of

00:05:58.409 --> 00:05:58.419 
complete the whole farm the cost of
