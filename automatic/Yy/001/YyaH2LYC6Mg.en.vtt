00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:16.330
 hello to all of you here barentin 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.939
 and today for this tutorial of their 

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:20.590
 network if I can call it like that I 

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.930
 will call everything but the series of 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:25.240
 tutorials on the network like that i have 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:27.670
 decided i will show you how 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:29.949
 turn your pc into a router and yes 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.900
 it is possible then certainly a router 

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.920
 it's a machine that has two 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.850
 network cards but we can do it 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.949
 also virtually 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.510
 so how to do it right then 

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:40.150
 under windows i will show you so 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.780
 you press the windows r key which 

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:46.720
 puts executed then you have you type 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.640
 I will remind them of what is said 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:52.840
 this is we will say yes and then I 

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.890
 you go up the entire tree because 

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.750
 that I help him on time so here you 

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:03.239
 find yourself with that so you go 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:08.740
 of art hkey local machine so system 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:09.580
 then you go to control kurun 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.850
 control 7 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:17.140
 you go down to tcp / ip must be from in 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.259
 down here is here 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.470
 see ip tcp then you have in 

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:26.500
 settings like these then you go 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.869
 in settings you have one and want 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.030
 now not this one the ip to nabeul 

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.679
 router you double click and you 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.670
 transform the value keep you in 

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:38.649
 hexadecimal the value zero in here you 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.450
 do this and here is your pc in height 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:43.599
 not sometimes will have to restart or what 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.099
 so be it listening to what I'm saying 

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:46.599
 advise is to restart for 

00:01:45.099 --> 00:01:48.310
 activate the edit function so here I 

00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:50.380
 let's leave it for now is this 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:51.429
 that I'm going to show you neither a little bug 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.229
 graphic I do not know if you will see 

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:55.899
 what can I show you 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.289
 also this is the second way that is 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:01.360
 you start windows services 

00:01:58.289 --> 00:02:03.030
 here so all the services are there so 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:06.200
 which starts automatically or manually 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.599
 and you have 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.090
 taher in theory routing and access that's it 

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.230
 here me mine it in textbooks and I can 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:14.970
 start it so you place 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.700
 automatically and disable at 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.110
 you do without manual 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.610
 manual and gets you started because 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.690
 if it's in automatic is better because 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.860
 that otherwise they want the little cow at 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.069
 startup and it's going to be crap for 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.739
 configure your network so that's bomb 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.880
 ah yes so now that i know 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:32.640
 played it activate to show you 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.090
 blow not that I wanted it was 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:37.769
 that I'm going to show you how to have 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.269
 because it's nice to have a 

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.380
 router to enable the routing function 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:46.890
 but still it is necessary to do some 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:51.360
 thing and I lost it here is yeah bah 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:53.760
 the activated started here it is there it activates 

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.310
 and as I had already changed the value 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.870
 it's going a little faster so 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:01.769
 now you are going to go in no 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:06.390
 our config not our little config our 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:09.060
 config and windows i'm sorry i'm 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.519
 not too much with windows 7 I never know 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:13.769
 where they fuck it all changes the whole 

00:03:11.519 --> 00:03:15.950
 time north user account between two 

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:20.040
 sharing networks is declaiming in 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:21.590
 then no virtualbox his valet who 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.660
 ensures the connection 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:27.510
 so that's my wifi connection g not 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.440
 my card due to modify by madam 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:31.470
 years and I think they know 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.600
 to the cons no yeah that must be there 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.079
 tomorrow we will look in there then 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.829
 we go into property 

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:38.100
 that's what I wanted you 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.480
 show 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:43.019
 then you have a protocol 

00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:44.640
 internet ip v4 property and then you 

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:47.160
 can choose your ip address because 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.950
 that of course he uses the he 

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.440
 uses your router for which serves 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.430
 also from dh cp who has awarded you 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.470
 automatic addresses 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.890
 so we will choose and we will continue to 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.790
 to be the addresses 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:03.220
 so tell her laces at 10 001 the 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.530
 bridge we will pass Jeannette 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:07.870
 my router my router that needs so much 

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:10.240
 messi are not on the same length at 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:12.640
 down precisely we will do like that I 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:14.500
 show you more we will do 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:16.870
 advanced properties and there you can 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.760
 add a second ip address so 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.989
 add a second ip address 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.680
 so I'm going to add an address 1 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.650
 192 168 what are we going to put on the 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:29.140
 same address so the router he has to 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:32.740
 to be 192 168 to 1 and I'm going to 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:35.830
 put time 1 of his mass 3 x 255 or a 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.410
 I do not know 50 for example here you are 

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:39.760
 see here I have my address 10 001 which 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.220
 does not address local too and with 

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:44.320
 the address of my second local network 

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:47.980
 and as my routing function is 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:52.000
 activated between my two addresses we will 

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:53.440
 right now check this out there my 

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000
 main address it's supposed to be there 

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.980
 10,001 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:59.410
 so here I normally if I do a 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:03.700
 command if I stack my router in 192 

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:06.070
 168 1 1 this is I can answer my 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:07.000
 router responds to me so let's see if 

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:09.940
 I have access to the internet 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:15.000
 normally yes I'm a cuckold we're going 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:17.500
 see we will test interim google.com 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.790
 google answer me no it's good so the 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.020
 routing function works so there 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.640
 it is sure on a machine that not too much 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.990
 the utility but let's admit at home 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.700
 do not have special road hours 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:26.710
 additional and then you can 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:30.240
 add I think so far we're going to look 

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:33.310
 how many ip addresses can we add 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.650
 a machine so I'm under windows 7 

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:39.570
 64 bit premium so that must depend on 

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:39.570
 version 6 so if I put a 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:50.300
 11 001 I will put a 12.01 

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:52.280
 finally it's just your system that 

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.940
 who should block this not the network card 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:59.540
 their treasures are blurry and attacks 

00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:06.699
 let's be crazy so we already I begin 

00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.699
 a little pawed 14001 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.360
 we will have fun 

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:14.210
 I hope it's not too much I think 

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.490
 it must be jean rue89 I'm not sure I 

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:18.650
 never tried I tried it is that in 

00:06:16.490 --> 00:06:23.300
 you no I was at how much I was at 

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:24.919
 15.16 good short 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.729
 so you can hand over some 

00:06:24.919 --> 00:06:30.200
 number here we will not do everything you 

00:06:28.729 --> 00:06:30.500
 test if you want to 

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:34.160
 amuse 

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:36.080
 I deleted the others so that 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:39.979
 it can be useful precisely if ever 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:43.850
 you have a switch at home and that 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:45.289
 you have pc and then a pc that 

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.970
 not especially an old pc at the 

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:47.990
 with you enable the routing function 

00:06:46.970 --> 00:06:48.620
 so it's pretty much the same under 

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.750
 windows xp 

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:53.479
 so I 'll maybe make you on linux 

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:55.700
 anything under linux and one its 

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.960
 two simple commands to type like 

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:57.560
 of hab you can find them on the 

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:59.210
 ubuntu docks 

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.370
 so thank you for having us 

00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:03.169
 followed for this tutorial and bah listen 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.410
 I tell you very soon and then there is 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:05.410
 more
