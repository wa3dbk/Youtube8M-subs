00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.190
 hello everyone we are here to 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:14.160
 show you the second proposal for 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:19.320
 Christmas that are a few polvorones of three 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:21.630
 flavors that are cinnamon chocolate and 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.489
 of lemon and for these delicious 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:26.610
 polvorones we are going to need the 

00:00:23.489 --> 00:00:29.340
 following ingredients that are 250 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:34.410
 grams of icing sugar 600 grams of 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:37.530
 flour 275 grams of lard 2 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:41.310
 spoonfuls of cocoa a glass of anise 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:44.580
 dry or brandy the middle grated 

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:46.950
 lemon a little bit of lemon juice and a 

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.860
 Cinnamon teaspoon good first thing 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:53.160
 What we will do is put a saucepan or pan 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:55.500
 fire and let's toast the flour the 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.740
 we take a little bit and we're going 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:03.870
 turning until I have a color 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:06.119
 golden without being burned but that 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.360
 be golden, you have to go around 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.770
 constantly because if it does not burn 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.740
 once we have already toasted the flour 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.290
 we throw it in a bowl 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:18.560
 a hole in the center and we throw the 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:24.009
 lard the icing sugar and the 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.009
 little one of anise and we mix everything 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.210
 when we can not continue in the bowl 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.250
 mixing because it is already too hard 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.030
 we throw it on the table and follow it 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.030
 working there 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:51.190
 once we have kneaded well we do 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560
 We put a ball in a bowl, cover it 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.500
 with a cloth and let it rest 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.990
 hour once our mass has rested 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.900
 we will cut into three pieces more or less 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:04.190
 same and we're going to throw the different 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.770
 flavors 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:10.490
 we still do not throw cinnamon to another 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:13.600
 we remove the grated zest and lemon juice 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.600
 another we put cocoa powder 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.840
 once this is done we will stretch the dough 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.880
 with the roller we will leave it 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.580
 inch and a half more or less thick 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:37.500
 and cut them with a cutter or a 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:37.500
 glass if you do not have a cut also worth 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:42.260
 once we have cut all our 

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:47.170
 we will put them in the oven and 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.170
 we will have about 20 minutes at 200 degrees 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.300
 and we have ready our delicious 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:59.370
 polvorones I hope you liked it and 

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:59.370
