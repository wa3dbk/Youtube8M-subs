so<00:01:10.480> by<00:01:10.630> utilizing<00:01:11.260> our<00:01:11.350> last<00:01:11.710> tech<00:01:11.950> resin

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:12.310 
so by utilizing our last tech resin

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.240 
so by utilizing our last tech resin
system<00:01:12.670> which<00:01:13.120> is<00:01:13.300> going<00:01:13.570> to<00:01:13.720> help<00:01:14.250> improve

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
system which is going to help improve

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.590 
system which is going to help improve
the<00:01:15.400> overall<00:01:15.520> durability<00:01:16.000> of<00:01:16.270> the<00:01:16.360> product

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the overall durability of the product

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.690 
the overall durability of the product
but<00:01:17.140> it<00:01:17.260> will<00:01:17.350> also<00:01:17.500> give<00:01:17.830> it<00:01:17.950> some<00:01:18.130> feel<00:01:18.430> so

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:20.430 
but it will also give it some feel so
improving<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.420> feel<00:01:19.660> on<00:01:19.900> a<00:01:19.960> stick<00:01:20.290> that

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:20.440 
improving the feel on a stick that

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.670 
improving the feel on a stick that
already<00:01:20.680> feels<00:01:20.920> so<00:01:21.310> good<00:01:21.840> and<00:01:22.840> that's<00:01:23.380> kind<00:01:23.650> of

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
already feels so good and that's kind of

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.830 
already feels so good and that's kind of
what<00:01:23.860> has<00:01:24.340> helped<00:01:24.670> supreme<00:01:25.000> do<00:01:25.300> so<00:01:25.540> well<00:01:25.720> in

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:25.840 
what has helped supreme do so well in

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.420 
what has helped supreme do so well in
the<00:01:25.870> marketplace<00:01:26.410> the<00:01:26.920> other<00:01:27.070> thing<00:01:27.310> we've

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
the marketplace the other thing we've

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.490 
the marketplace the other thing we've
done<00:01:27.460> is<00:01:27.850> taken<00:01:28.420> that<00:01:28.720> patented<00:01:29.290> blade

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
done is taken that patented blade

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:32.100 
done is taken that patented blade
technology<00:01:29.890> from<00:01:30.220> apex<00:01:30.610> and<00:01:30.880> bring<00:01:31.390> it<00:01:31.540> in<00:01:31.690> to

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:32.110 
technology from apex and bring it in to

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:34.440 
technology from apex and bring it in to
total<00:01:32.440> one<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.860> you'll<00:01:33.280> get<00:01:33.550> great<00:01:33.760> blade<00:01:34.180> feel

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
total one so you'll get great blade feel

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.480 
total one so you'll get great blade feel
but<00:01:34.900> a<00:01:34.930> lighter<00:01:35.200> blade<00:01:35.530> with<00:01:35.770> better<00:01:35.980> balance

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
but a lighter blade with better balance

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:38.820 
but a lighter blade with better balance
so<00:01:36.670> nxg<00:01:37.660> is<00:01:37.840> kind<00:01:38.080> of<00:01:38.170> is<00:01:38.350> going<00:01:38.650> to<00:01:38.710> be

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 
so nxg is kind of is going to be

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.650 
so nxg is kind of is going to be
everything<00:01:39.220> that<00:01:39.430> you<00:01:39.580> expect<00:01:40.090> from<00:01:40.240> it<00:01:40.420> from

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:40.660 
everything that you expect from it from

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:42.450 
everything that you expect from it from
a<00:01:40.750> supreme<00:01:41.080> stick<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:41.800> even<00:01:42.190> better

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:42.460 
a supreme stick with even better
