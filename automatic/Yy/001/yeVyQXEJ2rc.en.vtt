Hello! Welcome to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.600
At weddings and buffet dinners, the sweet
dish served is normally Pineapple pudding ...

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.100
... Carrot pudding or maybe an ice-cream.

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.800
There is another sweet dish served with any
of these items. It's a heavy recipe.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.000
Moong Dal Halwa which may be called
Green gram pudding

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
Today we shall learn to make 
Green gram pudding or Moong Dal Halwa.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.100
So stay tuned to Archana's Kitchen.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Let's start cooking.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
We need a bowl of clarified butter.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.100
A bowl of green gram flour.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Roast the green gram flour nicely in the
clarified butter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
It should be nice and crispy. We have
taken clarified butter more than usual.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.500
While this is getting roasted let's boil
some milk.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.300
2 cups of milk for a cup of green gram
flour. This is the ratio.

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:08.400
Hence we have taken 4 cups of milk.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.300
The milk has boiled and the green gram flour
is roasted too.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000
Add some almonds and cashewnuts to the
green gram flour.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Add half teaspoon of cardamom powder.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.800
Fry until golden brown.

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.300
Clarified butter is needed more than usual
for this dish.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.800
Now we can put off the flame for the milk.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.300
Pour milk into the wok in small portions.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The milk has been completely absorbed by
the pudding.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:13.500
Time to add sugar to it.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Mix nicely.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200
Let it cook to a steam.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.300
Green gram pudding is now ready. We can now
put off the flame.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.400
The clarified butter is floating 
on the sides.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:30.500
Transfer the pudding into a bowl.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.700
Garnish with chopped almonds.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Green gram pudding is ready. It's very heavy
but very nutritious.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:04.500
This is because it is made in clarified
butter and it's very yummy.
