00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.510
 overclocking in front 

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.240
 it continues on the floor 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.529
 century we see beautiful 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:19.500
 we've already had that 

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:20.650
 seen there, however, because it is likely 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.200
 turn on 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.730
 we are allowed to do that now 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.370
 who did not see in bergers then 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.050
 the special feature is that I think so 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.970
 The first device is on the internet 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:32.640
 new rattle trade plus and inside 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.830
 So runs this fabled 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.000
 intel-chip all the benchmarks jump 

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.380
 because I want to benchmark you so much 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.239
 show the problem is we have yes 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.620
 no network connection and i could 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.120
 again at tutu still cf else 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.900
 download something so we have to 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.390
 content with that 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:48.059
 Here a bit through the app store too 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.070
 wipe that impressed now first 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.510
 not so that looks a bit hakelig from the 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:53.220
 can also be a software problem 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.380
 we look quite short time in the 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.330
 settings and we'll look again 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:01.710
 something interesting to read out 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:03.660
 So let's live, then let's go 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.490
 on the version information there we see 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.310
 just that that already with android 4 

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:10.770
 21 12 so the most recent 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.820
 android version lenovo can see 100 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.000
 we can get up there tomorrow 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.920
 cryptic system version and internal 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.710
 version numbers otherwise is here 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.810
 unfortunately not so much usable too 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.250
 recognize here for example stands 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.370
 actually nothing interesting 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.260
 So we have to leave that too 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:32.770
 actually rattling trade plus inside 

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.479
 otherwise the software runs like you 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.040
 Now made here is the icons 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.440
 I need a bit of getting used to 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.280
 not so nice and me now 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.350
 I saw earlier 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.270
 it is even needed for speed most wanted 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.830
 installed on it I would have now 

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.750
 say good then look at us 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:48.700
 at least like this graphics-intensive 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:50.229
 Renner runs her eyes but he had to 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.560
 download data now and that works 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:55.630
 not again so we will in principle 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.399
 no definitive statement about it now 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.920
 can meet how fast the rattle 

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:00.850
 plus in the k9 100 is but at least hope 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.800
 that's something to do 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.660
 and I play around in the app store 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.399
 army of the white next someone 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.780
 showstoppers with the lenovo can be 100 

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:09.780
 discount rail plus 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.750
 a 

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.549
