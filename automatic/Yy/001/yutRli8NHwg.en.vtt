00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.570
 good and welcome to the tasting channel 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.430
 I think it was here we are in a new 

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.230
 video in which we're going to talk about three 

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:16.510
 matters three important issues two 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.670
 news and a debate as in previous 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.710
 videos a long time ago I was doing a 

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:22.510
 video debate for each video of 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.070
 news a little something like that well then let's go 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:25.900
 to recover it because I like to know 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:27.760
 your opinion and also me 

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.670
 like to participate in the comments with 

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.200
 you about these debates we are going to 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.480
 see the mesh of thorns that he has received 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.160
 a change in the particles when performing 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.839
 the passive object of the mesh of thorns and 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:42.399
 in bouquets we will also see the 

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:43.839
 visual improvement they have thought for 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.030
 nasser that we have already spoken well 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:47.620
 they have talked about the river and 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.940
 we will talk about the debate you already know that 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.469
 you can use the bar above 

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.389
 to directly the news that we most 

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:53.979
 interest let's start with the mesh 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.719
 good thorns here we are seeing the 

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:58.089
 effect within the game we are with 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.010
 and the new bug of the 

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:01.359
 jungle that I do not know very well the name 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.299
 wright I think it's called good in short 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:07.240
 let's say how it performs as there is a 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.070
 kind of claw that damage is returned 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.030
 of that mesh of thorns good too 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:15.219
 has the same visual improvement for the w 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.469
 of bouquets we already know that it returns damage 

00:01:15.219 --> 00:01:19.600
 ramus with the w therefore with a 

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:22.359
 improvement not very important but yes that 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.250
 it's good to show it they also want 

00:01:22.359 --> 00:01:25.539
 make changes in my fortune and serious that 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.450
 We will see later because it has shown 

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:30.159
 some of the changes and they say they are 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.039
 very early that can be modified 

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:35.140
 at any time so for the 4.2 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:38.320
 we are going to have new information about 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.840
 from my fortune one of my favorite abc 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.820
 so let's see if I can show you the 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:44.500
 changes soon when they are over 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:45.609
 focused on it nonetheless here 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.829
 we are seeing dead 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:50.079
 the visual improvement of thorns mesh 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.630
 we went to the topic of na short here we have 

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.979
 two images and the first one that we're 

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.109
 seeing is what was shown now in the 

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:57.789
 2014 season and that takes quite 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:02:00.780
 time inside the game files 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:02.950
 We see an improved short as 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.509
 very similar to the one on the right if 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.740
 we notice has also those barbs in 

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:07.810
 the back 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.729
 one has its mouth open two in the mouth 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:13.240
 closed but good the one on the right is 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.250
 of the kinematics twist of fate a twist 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.470
 of fate that cinematic so 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.850
 impressive that I perform riot ago 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.560
 a few months 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:23.140
 the triumph because it's a good pass 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.430
 Well, if you want to see more extended what 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.220
 that is male naso because it has 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:29.470
 confirmed to riot that that's the style 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 that will bring a surprise not forgotten 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.000
 of him but that will cost more 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.950
 time we already know what riot and that's why 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.700
 comes the next debate so if you 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.190
 Interested in staying because we are going to talk 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.600
 that the river was always using 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.850
 as things to get attention and 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:50.230
 then it really does not take them to 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:52.570
 cape in magmatic chamber new things 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:54.430
 then they take us out well anyway I do not know 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:56.590
 this would be what is the change of male 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 to sun we will now talk about the 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.880
 debate and good what do you think to tell me that 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.140
 If you like me I really like the 

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.480
 I really like the one on the left 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.400
 since it is an image and such but good 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 when you see it in the kinematics 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.560
 it is also a pass, let's talk 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.090
 of the good debate that you think is missing 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.800
 to the league of legends that is the question 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.150
 that I propose to you in the debate that 

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.980
 you can answer through the 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:19.960
 comments or by twitter at tasting 

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:21.670
 crocker and I'm interested in what is it 

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:23.320
 that you lack there are many mobage that are 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:25.240
 resurfacing that new ones are coming out 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.920
 there is one that looks good 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.510
 it's called straits that I have so many 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.000
 you win if someone has a beta or 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:33.940
 someone wants to share betas you know 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.970
 where are we the gay down also play 

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:38.470
 I played a little bit and the truth is 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:40.510
 that calls me a lot of attention has 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:42.820
 very interesting mechanics too 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.130
 we have the smith we have also the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.360
 next way to weaken how it could be 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.490
 the hero of storm at what you think 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.290
 river and have to do everything that 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.210
 is pulling out is backing out 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.180
 taking into account that it seems that 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:59.260
 comes a second generation of fashions 

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:01.870
 What do you need? 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.880
 new rigor champions that focus on 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.790
 what really is important as 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.690
 can be improvement of 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.230
 infrastructures such as 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.080
 servers 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.730
 a kind of compensation for failures 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.280
 on the servers that is what makes you 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:19.910
 missing new maps and new mechanics of 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.590
 customer remodeling game I do not know yo 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.699
 I think they debate a lot of things and 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.040
 what should 

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:27.949
 they can really do it but not 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.510
 want it or not I know it honestly I think that 

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:32.120
 they are focusing more on the competitive 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:34.699
 and they are leaving us a little aside 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.410
 we can use already 

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:38.360
 directly the comments for 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:39.050
 tell me to tell me what I know 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.910
 It seems 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.220
 and we are talking through there I go 

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:45.050
 to focus more on answering if sometimes 

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:47.300
 it costs me quite a bit and such because 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:48.979
 many comments and good not you 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.870
 worry that we want to talk to 

00:04:48.979 --> 00:04:52.220
 through the comments 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:04:53.750
 so I hope you liked it 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.940
 the video and please I'm interested 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.979
 rather than participate in this 

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:59.840
 survey in this debate and what was said 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.550
 You can give it to me I like you can 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.510
 subscribe and see you in the next 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:04.510
 goodbye video
