00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.390

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.750
 that was born from dumping the 

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:41.350
 Window of your window with chopped frutica 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:43.360

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.250
 three so that people are some 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.229
 perspective of comedy in Colombia and 

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:03.430
 how is it and the authentic comedy in the 

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:07.210
 comedy that is born from the night of the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.069
 coffees of the parents of the theater if a 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.140
 thing as well as circles the circuits 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:13.180
 of comedy then there so that the 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:16.510
 Perfect scene of authentic food 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.560
 but I said not everyone now says 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.069
 goodbye 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:23.860
 I know how to do stand up comedy and how not 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:26.200
 that's that's blood if that's that 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.840
 born with one of that is is a thing one 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.330
 that they have had very strong is a thing of 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.360
 it is not simply 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.550
 an autobiographical or sex 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:39.430
 I decided the bad 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:41.710
 although I am good at last so many things 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.330
 come, we see in YouTube videos that nobody 

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:45.070
 I've seen in Colombia because nobody sees 

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:47.200
 youtube only come we ride a lot 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:49.690

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:52.210
 we say by intermedic guard of 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.710
 other American comedians and so 

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:55.780
 because as nobody knows English of color 

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:58.140
 nobody's mind realizes that these 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.480
 they are authentic comedians who already know 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.790
 the record company is ready so that 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.670

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:21.220
 You swallow just like that and in work 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.900
 artists when you support the artists 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:25.810
 He knows exactly who he is supporting 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.340
 when one buys piracy other things 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.870
 for not really knowing for whom it is 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:34.020
 working for who is doing the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.810
