and<00:00:58.340> if<00:00:58.490> they're<00:00:58.640> in<00:00:58.760> the<00:00:58.880> center<00:00:59.120> they're<00:00:59.690> out

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
and if they're in the center they're out

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.810 
and if they're in the center they're out
you<00:01:00.590> know<00:01:00.739> and<00:01:01.280> then<00:01:01.400> you've<00:01:01.520> got<00:01:01.700> this

section here you've got the coffee

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:06.310 
section here you've got the coffee
blender<00:01:03.800> and<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:05.269> snake<00:01:05.509> with<00:01:05.689> an<00:01:05.780> arrow<00:01:05.960> shop

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:06.320 
blender and the snake with an arrow shop

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.370 
blender and the snake with an arrow shop
for<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.680> yeah<00:01:07.430> now<00:01:07.700> that's<00:01:07.970> going<00:01:08.299> and<00:01:08.930> this<00:01:09.170> is

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
for it yeah now that's going and this is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.030 
for it yeah now that's going and this is
this<00:01:10.130> is<00:01:10.189> the<00:01:10.759> amount<00:01:11.329> of<00:01:11.570> blend<00:01:12.020> so<00:01:12.829> you<00:01:12.860> can

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:13.040 
this is the amount of blend so you can

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.530 
this is the amount of blend so you can
blend<00:01:13.220> in<00:01:13.520> harmonics<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:16.210> overdrive<00:01:17.210> those

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:17.540 
blend in harmonics and overdrive those

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.069 
blend in harmonics and overdrive those
harmonics<00:01:18.259> with<00:01:18.499> this<00:01:18.770> you<00:01:19.399> know<00:01:19.549> and<00:01:19.850> that's

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:20.079 
harmonics with this you know and that's

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:22.120 
harmonics with this you know and that's
you<00:01:21.079> could<00:01:21.229> defeat<00:01:21.469> that<00:01:21.649> with<00:01:21.770> a<00:01:21.799> foot<00:01:22.009> switch

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
you could defeat that with a foot switch

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.279 
you could defeat that with a foot switch
any<00:01:22.490> lasting<00:01:22.850> foot<00:01:23.090> switch<00:01:23.299> including<00:01:24.079> our

00:01:24.279 --> 00:01:24.289 
any lasting foot switch including our

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:29.440 
any lasting foot switch including our
orange<00:01:24.710> one<00:01:25.520> will<00:01:26.479> defeat<00:01:27.109> that<00:01:27.579> and<00:01:28.579> it's<00:01:29.389> the

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:29.450 
orange one will defeat that and it's the

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.120 
orange one will defeat that and it's the
same<00:01:29.689> on<00:01:29.869> both<00:01:30.079> the<00:01:30.139> 300<00:01:30.709> and<00:01:30.740> we're<00:01:30.920> playing

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
same on both the 300 and we're playing

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.389 
same on both the 300 and we're playing
for<00:01:31.310> the<00:01:31.429> 300<00:01:32.090> at<00:01:32.179> the<00:01:32.270> moment<00:01:32.770> but<00:01:33.770> the<00:01:33.829> 500<00:01:34.340> is

00:01:34.389 --> 00:01:34.399 
for the 300 at the moment but the 500 is

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:37.899 
for the 300 at the moment but the 500 is
a<00:01:34.459> bit<00:01:34.579> louder<00:01:34.819> you<00:01:35.630> know<00:01:35.719> so<00:01:36.439> if<00:01:36.590> I<00:01:36.709> bring<00:01:36.979> if<00:01:37.819> I

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
a bit louder you know so if I bring if I

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:40.870 
a bit louder you know so if I bring if I
bring<00:01:38.119> this<00:01:38.270> this<00:01:39.259> up<00:01:39.439> on<00:01:39.590> its<00:01:39.740> own<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
bring this this up on its own the

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.019 
bring this this up on its own the
harmonics<00:01:41.420> jump<00:01:41.689> up<00:01:41.929> but<00:01:42.259> it's<00:01:42.829> still<00:01:43.069> it's

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:44.029 
harmonics jump up but it's still it's

00:01:44.029 --> 00:01:46.629 
harmonics jump up but it's still it's
just<00:01:44.329> starting<00:01:44.749> to<00:01:44.779> get<00:01:44.990> excited<00:01:45.649> but<00:01:46.279> there's

00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:46.639 
just starting to get excited but there's

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:49.359 
just starting to get excited but there's
no<00:01:46.759> actual<00:01:46.969> gain<00:01:47.389> added<00:01:47.719> to<00:01:47.899> it<00:01:48.049> yeah<00:01:48.319> but<00:01:49.189> if<00:01:49.279> I

00:01:49.359 --> 00:01:49.369 
no actual gain added to it yeah but if I

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:57.539 
no actual gain added to it yeah but if I
play<00:01:49.579> that

00:01:57.539 --> 00:01:57.549 

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.219 

so<00:01:58.549> it<00:01:58.640> kind<00:01:58.850> of<00:01:58.909> jumps<00:01:59.240> out<00:01:59.420> you're<00:01:59.659> more<00:01:59.869> if

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
so it kind of jumps out you're more if

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:44.660 
so it kind of jumps out you're more if
you<00:02:00.470> start<00:02:00.710> bringing<00:02:00.860> going<00:02:01.340> in

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.880 

so<00:02:45.670> you<00:02:45.730> can<00:02:45.940> you<00:02:46.150> know<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.540> can<00:02:46.750> kind<00:02:47.290> of<00:02:47.410> you

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
so you can you know you can kind of you

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.339 
so you can you know you can kind of you
still<00:02:48.160> got<00:02:48.310> the<00:02:48.400> clean<00:02:48.700> now<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.959> the<00:02:50.050> bottom

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:50.349 
still got the clean now so the bottom

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.910 
still got the clean now so the bottom
end<00:02:50.530> is<00:02:50.800> still<00:02:51.069> clean<00:02:51.790> I<00:02:52.380> mean<00:02:53.380> this<00:02:53.440> is<00:02:53.620> kind

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:53.920 
end is still clean I mean this is kind

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.550 
end is still clean I mean this is kind
of<00:02:54.010> gauged<00:02:54.250> more<00:02:54.760> the<00:02:55.360> EQ<00:02:55.690> does<00:02:55.930> affect<00:02:56.290> it<00:02:56.410> but

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
of gauged more the EQ does affect it but

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.080 
of gauged more the EQ does affect it but
it's<00:02:56.709> gazed<00:02:56.980> more<00:02:57.310> for<00:02:57.520> the<00:02:57.580> upper<00:02:57.880> register

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:58.090 
it's gazed more for the upper register

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.570 
it's gazed more for the upper register
you<00:02:58.660> know<00:02:59.010> so<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.160> adds<00:03:00.690> kind<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.780> harmonic

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
you know so it adds kind of harmonic

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.540 
you know so it adds kind of harmonic
crunch<00:03:03.580> richness<00:03:04.300> overdrive<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.770> what's

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:06.550 
crunch richness overdrive to what's

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.220 
crunch richness overdrive to what's
already<00:03:06.670> kind<00:03:07.150> of<00:03:07.180> set<00:03:07.390> up<00:03:07.510> pretty<00:03:07.750> much<00:03:07.930> clean

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
already kind of set up pretty much clean

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.640 
already kind of set up pretty much clean
these<00:03:09.069> basses<00:03:09.670> are<00:03:09.970> quite<00:03:10.540> growly<00:03:11.170> sounding

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
these basses are quite growly sounding

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:13.290 
these basses are quite growly sounding
anyway<00:03:12.010> you<00:03:12.069> know<00:03:12.340> there's<00:03:12.580> kind<00:03:13.150> of<00:03:13.209> a

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:13.300 
anyway you know there's kind of a

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:19.470 
anyway you know there's kind of a
natural<00:03:16.530> kind<00:03:17.530> of<00:03:17.590> growl<00:03:17.830> to<00:03:18.100> them<00:03:18.330> you<00:03:19.330> know

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:19.480 
natural kind of growl to them you know

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.930 
natural kind of growl to them you know
something<00:03:20.170> we've<00:03:20.350> been<00:03:20.549> mucking<00:03:21.549> around<00:03:21.640> with

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
something we've been mucking around with
