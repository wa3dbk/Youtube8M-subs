00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:05.520
 the dog master duo it's like a 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:08.150
 mix of colors and colors 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.150
 do not mix 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:29.970
 all 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.780
 it's not everyone who can the guy 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.370
 to recycle that kind of dog 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:43.059
 simply because dangerousness is 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:44.940
 as it blocks your love and you 

00:00:43.059 --> 00:00:48.250
 prevents going beyond 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.879
 at the level of the vultures of the dog this 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.379
 afraid we're totally blocked we have the 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.699
 mastery and control it to be able to 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:59.530
 make rebuild the dog what 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:03.600
 is the most troubling what he has me more 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:09.690
 troubled fact that this chain is developing 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:14.640
 all his love for me and suddenly 

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:17.380
 without necessarily knowing it I 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:20.110
 am finally reminds I adopt 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:24.670
 the guardian angel simply who is 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:26.979
 an exceptional exceptional chain 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:28.840
 simply because I have a 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.540
 control I took control over it 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:33.670
 who came exceptional I can 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:37.150
 manage both his aggression as well as 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:38.350
 are obedient and so on and for a 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:42.490
 dog who wanted me completely 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:45.660
 to eat at the base is something and 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:45.660
 it's a breakthrough I think 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.430
 Oh 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:10.560
 most educators I you 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.600
 offers videos with Malinois who 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:17.220
 are automated they are robotic me 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.070
 I decided to make you this little 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.500
 video with a malinois 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.450
 but we could not go from lower 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.150
 that is, she had absolutely nothing 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.120
 no obedience it is an aggressiveness 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.290
 pretty dazzling 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.550
 so after a few months of work the 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.990
 most of the work it was the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:43.230
 first weeks after it's a big 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:45.470
 background work and I walk around at 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:47.930
 normally done 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:50.430
 training or education of the dog 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.440
 it's not just a method with a 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.330
 necklace with a technique etc 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.590
 it's a question of personality it's 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.390
 not necessarily everyone who can 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:00.500
 do that but everyone can 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:05.400
 to learn that is a certainty 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:09.150
 when working the aggressive dog he 

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:13.080
 y to physical practice as I do 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.550
 and there is the scientific practice of 

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:19.020
 theory and explanations 

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:21.870
 but theory or practice 

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:25.070
 scientist does not take into account the 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:30.920
 feeling and in physical practice 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.920
 feelings are obligatory a 

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:42.470
 fighting that works but shines and it's 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.080
 what I do with a dog is that 

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:48.270
 I earn his respect I earn that respect 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.780
 not my actions by my way of being 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:54.090
 that's why when I hear 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:56.220
 yes I know it can be said the trainer 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.430
 with croquettes when he is 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:02.150
 aggressive etc but I invite you to do 

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:04.590
 to travel from two very good specimen 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:07.380
 I invite you to do it by cons 

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:10.680
 will have to sign a discharge before 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:14.070
 dog stands in a way and no 

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.980
 any way the dog gets 

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:18.600
 hold firmly 

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:21.540
 you have to know that each person 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.730
 releases energy only if your energy 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.330
 is negative you're going to have a dog 

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:29.940
 you are anxious about your dog 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.100
 learn how to manage this energy and if 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.610
 you want the leash it's the thread 

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:35.760
 driver 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.200
 she will transmit your energy and of 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.490
 wash or change the behavior of 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:47.010
 your dog here is a leash that holds 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:48.900
 still the stigmas of aggression 

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:54.260
 of the dog I keep them in memory because 

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:57.600
 that's when I see the impacts 

00:04:54.260 --> 00:05:02.280
 that's why forget that the 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:04.370
 dangerousness is there and that you never have to 

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.370
 forget it
