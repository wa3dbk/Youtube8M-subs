fifth-generation iPod touch we're going
to<00:00:10.620> see<00:00:10.830> if<00:00:11.160> it<00:00:11.519> can<00:00:11.730> last<00:00:12.090> in<00:00:12.480> water<00:00:13.049> submerge

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
to see if it can last in water submerge

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.369 
to see if it can last in water submerge
I<00:00:14.130> know<00:00:14.190> it<00:00:14.460> says<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.910> can't<00:00:14.940> be<00:00:15.660> submerged<00:00:16.109> in

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
I know it says it can't be submerged in

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.160 
I know it says it can't be submerged in
water<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.949> it's<00:00:17.850> only<00:00:18.060> water<00:00:18.240> resistant<00:00:18.960> but

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
water and it's only water resistant but

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.640 
water and it's only water resistant but
I'm<00:00:19.439> gonna<00:00:19.650> see<00:00:19.920> if<00:00:19.949> that's<00:00:20.250> true<00:00:20.640> or<00:00:20.670> not<00:00:21.560> so<00:00:22.560> i

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
I'm gonna see if that's true or not so i

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.650 
I'm gonna see if that's true or not so i
got<00:00:22.830> i'm<00:00:22.980> filming<00:00:23.490> on<00:00:23.730> my<00:00:23.880> ipod<00:00:24.210> touch<00:00:24.240> right

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
got i'm filming on my ipod touch right

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:45.730 
got i'm filming on my ipod touch right
now<00:00:30.679> seems<00:00:31.679> to<00:00:31.800> be<00:00:31.920> doing<00:00:32.219> pretty<00:00:32.369> good

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:45.740 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:48.150 

it's<00:00:46.640> probably<00:00:46.850> a<00:00:47.090> little<00:00:47.300> wet<00:00:47.660> from<00:00:47.870> when<00:00:48.080> I

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
it's probably a little wet from when I

00:00:48.160 --> 00:01:12.390 
it's probably a little wet from when I
kind<00:00:49.160> of<00:00:49.310> did<00:00:49.550> push<00:00:50.120> down<00:00:50.420> but

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:12.400 

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.190 

so<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:13.460> can<00:01:13.760> definitely<00:01:13.940> tell<00:01:14.300> that<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.930> can't

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:15.200 
so you can definitely tell that it can't

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.550 
so you can definitely tell that it can't
be<00:01:15.380> submerged<00:01:16.010> in<00:01:16.370> water<00:01:16.400> for<00:01:16.790> that<00:01:17.270> one<00:01:17.600> but

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.900 

but<00:01:21.560> I<00:01:21.620> do<00:01:21.680> think<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.220> they<00:01:22.430> did<00:01:22.610> a<00:01:22.700> pretty

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:22.910 
but I do think that they did a pretty

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:30.940 
but I do think that they did a pretty
good<00:01:23.090> job<00:01:23.150> on<00:01:23.420> it<00:01:23.810> let's<00:01:24.050> see<00:01:24.290> here<00:01:24.650> I<00:01:29.950> tried

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
good job on it let's see here I tried

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.490 
good job on it let's see here I tried
this<00:01:31.160> one<00:01:31.430> time<00:01:31.670> in<00:01:31.910> like<00:01:32.120> no<00:01:32.750> water<00:01:33.080> came

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:33.500 
this one time in like no water came

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.400 
this one time in like no water came
through<00:01:33.890> but<00:01:34.570> not<00:01:35.570> sure<00:01:35.780> what<00:01:35.900> happened<00:01:36.050> this

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
through but not sure what happened this

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:41.020 
through but not sure what happened this
time<00:01:37.060> let's<00:01:38.060> open<00:01:38.930> this<00:01:39.080> up<00:01:39.550> gotta<00:01:40.550> get<00:01:40.790> this

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030 
time let's open this up gotta get this

00:01:41.030 --> 00:02:08.820 
time let's open this up gotta get this
so<00:01:41.330> i<00:01:41.360> can<00:01:42.250> leave<00:01:43.250> it<00:01:43.400> on<00:01:43.460> the<00:01:43.640> stand

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:19.950 

let's<00:02:09.830> see<00:02:11.830> ipod<00:02:12.830> touch<00:02:13.780> 5th<00:02:14.780> generation<00:02:16.240> open

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:19.960 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:37.660 

it's<00:02:20.960> kind<00:02:21.200> of<00:02:21.320> hard<00:02:32.650> as<00:02:33.650> you<00:02:34.400> can<00:02:34.550> see<00:02:34.820> a<00:02:36.670> whole

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
it's kind of hard as you can see a whole

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.170 
it's kind of hard as you can see a whole
bunch<00:02:37.700> of<00:02:38.090> water<00:02:38.390> but<00:02:38.750> i<00:02:39.430> don't<00:02:40.430> think<00:02:40.550> that<00:02:41.000> if

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:41.180 
bunch of water but i don't think that if

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.360 
bunch of water but i don't think that if
you<00:02:41.330> did<00:02:41.690> get<00:02:41.930> it<00:02:42.110> dropped<00:02:42.380> and<00:02:42.680> submerged<00:02:43.100> in

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:43.370 
you did get it dropped and submerged in

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.270 
you did get it dropped and submerged in
water<00:02:43.400> i<00:02:44.030> don't<00:02:44.720> think<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:45.230> would<00:02:45.770> hurt<00:02:46.070> your

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
water i don't think it would hurt your

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:54.460 
water i don't think it would hurt your
eyes

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:56.530
