extended<00:01:18.290> mags<00:01:18.530> and<00:01:18.619> flash<00:01:18.860> hider<00:01:19.070> because

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
extended mags and flash hider because

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.700 
extended mags and flash hider because
you<00:01:20.060> can't<00:01:20.299> see<00:01:20.450> the<00:01:20.540> hit<00:01:20.659> markers<00:01:21.049> because<00:01:21.380> of

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:21.710 
you can't see the hit markers because of

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:24.490 
you can't see the hit markers because of
the<00:01:22.180> huge<00:01:23.180> amount<00:01:23.450> of<00:01:23.570> muzzle<00:01:23.990> flash<00:01:24.170> you<00:01:24.320> get

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
the huge amount of muzzle flash you get

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.490 
the huge amount of muzzle flash you get
from<00:01:24.650> your<00:01:24.710> hipfire<00:01:25.150> so<00:01:26.150> you<00:01:26.990> don't<00:01:27.200> really

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
from your hipfire so you don't really

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.929 
from your hipfire so you don't really
know<00:01:27.650> where<00:01:27.860> you're<00:01:27.950> shooting<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.430> and<00:01:28.729> very

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
know where you're shooting it and very

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.899 
know where you're shooting it and very
where<00:01:29.360> you<00:01:29.450> have<00:01:29.600> to<00:01:29.750> aim<00:01:29.900> so<00:01:30.890> and<00:01:31.250> thermal

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:31.909 
where you have to aim so and thermal

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:33.899 
where you have to aim so and thermal
sight<00:01:32.090> makes<00:01:32.299> discount<00:01:32.750> just<00:01:32.960> even<00:01:33.229> worse<00:01:33.380> but

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:33.909 
sight makes discount just even worse but

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:36.310 
sight makes discount just even worse but
because<00:01:34.909> it<00:01:35.000> covers<00:01:35.150> the<00:01:35.299> whole<00:01:35.360> right<00:01:36.290> side

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:36.320 
because it covers the whole right side

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.080 
because it covers the whole right side
of<00:01:36.680> the<00:01:36.799> screen<00:01:36.920> so<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.280> can't<00:01:37.549> see<00:01:37.790> what<00:01:37.970> is

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
of the screen so we can't see what is

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.179 
of the screen so we can't see what is
happening<00:01:38.119> at<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.689> moment<00:01:38.750> also<00:01:39.680> that<00:01:40.100> we

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
happening at the moment also that we

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:42.910 
happening at the moment also that we
don't<00:01:40.310> damage<00:01:40.400> it<00:01:40.909> seem<00:01:41.299> big<00:01:41.540> but<00:01:42.200> i<00:01:42.530> forgot<00:01:42.860> to
