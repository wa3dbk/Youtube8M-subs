00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:22.449 
going to leave it in there a little bit
longer<00:02:20.120> just<00:02:20.599> to<00:02:20.720> be<00:02:20.870> sure<00:02:21.069> since<00:02:22.069> they<00:02:22.220> are<00:02:22.430> so

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
longer just to be sure since they are so

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.520 
longer just to be sure since they are so
dark<00:02:22.940> it's<00:02:23.120> hard<00:02:23.180> to<00:02:23.420> tell<00:02:23.660> but<00:02:23.780> that<00:02:23.840> lit<00:02:24.260> that

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
dark it's hard to tell but that lit that

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.460 
dark it's hard to tell but that lit that
eye<00:02:24.590> looks<00:02:24.890> funny<00:02:25.310> anyway<00:02:26.230> this<00:02:27.230> one's

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
eye looks funny anyway this one's

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.140 
eye looks funny anyway this one's
definitely<00:02:27.859> fertile<00:02:28.340> and<00:02:28.430> a<00:02:28.489> lot<00:02:28.640> easier<00:02:29.000> to

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
definitely fertile and a lot easier to

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.420 
definitely fertile and a lot easier to
see<00:02:29.359> so<00:02:30.109> that's<00:02:30.319> what<00:02:30.530> we<00:02:30.620> look<00:02:30.650> for<00:02:30.859> when<00:02:31.160> we

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:31.430 
see so that's what we look for when we

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.720 
see so that's what we look for when we
can't<00:02:31.819> see<00:02:32.260> the<00:02:33.260> veins<00:02:33.500> is<00:02:33.799> we<00:02:33.950> just<00:02:34.190> look<00:02:34.400> for

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
can't see the veins is we just look for

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:37.150 
can't see the veins is we just look for
you<00:02:35.299> know<00:02:35.329> the<00:02:35.540> top<00:02:35.750> and<00:02:35.989> the<00:02:36.049> bottom<00:02:36.230> where

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
you know the top and the bottom where
