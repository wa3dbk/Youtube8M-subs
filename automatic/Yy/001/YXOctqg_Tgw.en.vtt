00:02:30.229 --> 00:02:30.239 
right here if you see all this which you

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.920 
right here if you see all this which you
should<00:02:30.480> be<00:02:30.629> able<00:02:30.780> to<00:02:30.959> and<00:02:31.549> the<00:02:32.549> only<00:02:32.879> thing<00:02:33.659> is

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
should be able to and the only thing is

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.429 
should be able to and the only thing is
his<00:02:34.889> tail<00:02:35.400> is<00:02:35.670> not<00:02:35.819> attached<00:02:36.450> to<00:02:36.629> anything<00:02:37.019> and

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
his tail is not attached to anything and

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:39.229 
his tail is not attached to anything and
it<00:02:37.739> just<00:02:37.950> looks<00:02:38.159> like<00:02:38.250> he<00:02:38.519> could<00:02:38.639> break<00:02:38.909> easily

00:02:39.229 --> 00:02:39.239 
it just looks like he could break easily

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:41.509 
it just looks like he could break easily
so<00:02:39.629> I<00:02:39.659> would<00:02:39.900> be<00:02:40.049> very<00:02:40.079> careful<00:02:40.739> with<00:02:41.099> that<00:02:41.280> and

00:02:41.509 --> 00:02:41.519 
so I would be very careful with that and

00:02:41.519 --> 00:02:43.940 
so I would be very careful with that and
his<00:02:42.329> little<00:02:42.510> hook<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:42.959> right<00:02:43.200> there<00:02:43.469> in<00:02:43.650> the
