00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.640 
are pretty good choices for this weapon
I<00:00:24.060> usually<00:00:24.420> use<00:00:24.539> it<00:00:24.689> with<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.960> attachment

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
I usually use it with the attachment

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.800 
I usually use it with the attachment
with<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.010> attachments<00:00:26.580> proficiency<00:00:27.180> and<00:00:27.359> I

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
with the attachments proficiency and I

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.210 
with the attachments proficiency and I
usually<00:00:28.140> put<00:00:28.289> both<00:00:28.470> of<00:00:28.500> them<00:00:28.680> on<00:00:28.769> there<00:00:28.980> I<00:00:29.039> put

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

the silencer and the rapid fire

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.709 
the silencer and the rapid fire
it's<00:00:31.920> basically<00:00:32.369> becomes<00:00:32.730> a<00:00:33.090> better<00:00:33.450> version

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
it's basically becomes a better version

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.110 
it's basically becomes a better version
of<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.079> p90<00:00:34.620> when<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.100> put<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.520> rapid

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
fire and the silencer on there no I only

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.200 
fire and the silencer on there no I only
have<00:00:37.860> it<00:00:38.070> suppressed<00:00:38.520> in<00:00:38.670> this<00:00:38.790> gameplay<00:00:39.000> I

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
just looked at the bottom right but

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.680 
just looked at the bottom right but
rapid<00:00:41.550> fire<00:00:41.730> and<00:00:41.760> silence<00:00:42.239> there<00:00:42.360> are<00:00:42.480> good

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690
