00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
get to see where the wave ends off and

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:11.390 
get to see where the wave ends off and
then<00:03:09.360> this<00:03:09.720> is<00:03:09.930> the<00:03:10.050> way<00:03:10.170> that<00:03:10.440> we<00:03:10.590> end<00:03:10.890> up

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:47.430 
clamp down and then we're gonna go to

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.300 
clamp down and then we're gonna go to
move<00:03:47.820> down<00:03:48.030> right<00:03:48.690> there<00:03:48.900> okay<00:03:49.350> and<00:03:49.590> this<00:03:50.130> is

00:03:53.509 --> 00:03:53.519 
it so now I'm going to do my other half

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.930 
it so now I'm going to do my other half
like<00:03:54.180> I<00:03:54.330> did<00:03:54.600> another<00:03:55.019> side<00:03:55.530> I<00:03:55.830> split<00:03:56.580> this<00:03:56.760> in

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:56.940 
like I did another side I split this in

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.540 
like I did another side I split this in
half<00:03:56.970> I<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:58.110> wrap<00:03:58.350> this<00:03:58.530> around<00:03:58.680> my<00:03:59.010> head<00:03:59.220> go

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
half I just wrap this around my head go

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.670 
half I just wrap this around my head go
as<00:03:59.640> close<00:03:59.850> to<00:04:00.060> the<00:04:00.150> root<00:04:00.300> as<00:04:00.420> possible<00:04:00.900> but<00:04:01.530> not

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:01.680 
as close to the root as possible but not

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.620 
as close to the root as possible but not
so<00:04:01.950> close<00:04:02.220> that<00:04:02.250> you<00:04:02.760> like<00:04:02.910> risk<00:04:03.180> burning

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
so close that you like risk burning

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:09.770 
so close that you like risk burning
yourself<00:04:03.780> because<00:04:04.290> no<00:04:04.410> one<00:04:04.560> wants<00:04:04.800> that<00:04:08.780> this

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
yourself because no one wants that this

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.020 
yourself because no one wants that this
is<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.290> difficult<00:04:10.560> because<00:04:11.400> I'm<00:04:11.700> trying

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is really difficult because I'm trying

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:13.550 
is really difficult because I'm trying
not<00:04:12.180> to<00:04:12.239> pull<00:04:12.510> this<00:04:12.660> cable<00:04:13.140> right<00:04:13.170> here

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
not to pull this cable right here

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.660 
not to pull this cable right here
because<00:04:13.860> if<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.070> do<00:04:14.130> I'm<00:04:14.370> just<00:04:14.400> going<00:04:14.640> to

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:14.670 
because if I do I'm just going to

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.789 
because if I do I'm just going to
unconnect<00:04:15.209> this<00:04:15.420> there's<00:04:16.109> an<00:04:16.229> outlet<00:04:16.560> right

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
unconnect this there's an outlet right

these<00:04:54.630> sections<00:04:55.110> and<00:04:55.410> take<00:04:55.950> your<00:04:56.100> time<00:04:56.310> with

00:04:56.360 --> 00:04:56.370 
these sections and take your time with

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.550 
these sections and take your time with
it<00:04:56.760> because<00:04:56.910> the<00:04:57.810> more<00:04:57.960> such<00:04:58.200> B's<00:04:58.350> you<00:04:58.440> have

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
it because the more such B's you have

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.530 
it because the more such B's you have
the<00:04:58.680> more<00:04:58.860> volume<00:04:59.250> you<00:04:59.280> have<00:04:59.400> and<00:04:59.850> I<00:05:00.360> guess

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:00.540 
the more volume you have and I guess

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.210 
the more volume you have and I guess
that's<00:05:00.720> just<00:05:00.870> a<00:05:01.080> preference<00:05:01.470> thing<00:05:01.650> I<00:05:01.860> really

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:02.220 
that's just a preference thing I really

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:03.440 
that's just a preference thing I really
like<00:05:02.370> volume<00:05:02.790> when<00:05:02.910> it<00:05:03.030> comes<00:05:03.210> to<00:05:03.330> this

splitting<00:05:13.560> it<00:05:14.030> horizontally<00:05:15.030> because<00:05:15.180> this

00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:15.960 
splitting it horizontally because this

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.110 
splitting it horizontally because this
section<00:05:16.230> is<00:05:16.500> long<00:05:16.890> compared<00:05:17.490> to<00:05:17.550> the<00:05:17.670> bottom

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:18.120 
section is long compared to the bottom

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.610 
section is long compared to the bottom
section<00:05:18.450> which<00:05:18.540> was<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:18.840> pretty<00:05:19.080> high<00:05:19.350> I

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:19.620 
section which was like pretty high I

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:21.710 
section which was like pretty high I
usually<00:05:20.100> explain<00:05:20.430> it<00:05:20.640> from<00:05:20.820> my<00:05:20.970> back<00:05:21.210> section

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:21.720 
usually explain it from my back section

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:26.630 
usually explain it from my back section
to<00:05:22.260> my<00:05:22.650> front<00:05:22.920> section<00:05:24.890> okay<00:05:25.890> I<00:05:26.130> said<00:05:26.430> a<00:05:26.460> little

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
to my front section okay I said a little

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.700 
to my front section okay I said a little
bit<00:05:26.790> farther<00:05:27.090> away<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.390> hopefully<00:05:27.870> this<00:05:28.080> helps

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
bit farther away so hopefully this helps

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.730 
bit farther away so hopefully this helps
