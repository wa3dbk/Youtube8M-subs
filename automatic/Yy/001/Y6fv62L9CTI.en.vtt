out of one by two and they're covered by

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.580 
out of one by two and they're covered by
chicken<00:01:03.019> wire<00:01:03.260> staple<00:01:03.980> in<00:01:04.070> place<00:01:05.409> on<00:01:06.409> the

chicken wire staple in place on the
bottom<00:01:06.890> I<00:01:07.040> have<00:01:07.700> like<00:01:08.510> holes<00:01:09.050> did<00:01:09.440> I<00:01:09.530> use<00:01:09.740> as

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
bottom I have like holes did I use as

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:13.120 
bottom I have like holes did I use as
air<00:01:10.280> intakes<00:01:10.820> as<00:01:11.570> well<00:01:11.780> as<00:01:11.870> 200<00:01:12.080> watt<00:01:12.830> light

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.130

air intakes as well as 200 watt light
bulbs<00:01:13.490> and<00:01:13.640> they<00:01:14.480> provide<00:01:14.780> heat<00:01:15.050> and<00:01:15.290> they

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:15.740 
bulbs and they provide heat and they

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.100 
bulbs and they provide heat and they
help<00:01:15.920> with<00:01:16.160> convection<00:01:16.820> and<00:01:16.970> to<00:01:17.780> drive<00:01:17.990> the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
help with convection and to drive the

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.520 
help with convection and to drive the
air<00:01:18.230> I<00:01:18.410> guess<00:01:18.940> on<00:01:19.940> the<00:01:20.090> top<00:01:20.300> I<00:01:20.570> have<00:01:20.840> an<00:01:20.990> old<00:01:21.110> pc

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:21.530 
air I guess on the top I have an old pc

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.570 
air I guess on the top I have an old pc
fan<00:01:21.770> dentures<00:01:22.670> air<00:01:23.210> circulation<00:01:24.580> now

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
fan dentures air circulation now

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.550 
fan dentures air circulation now
depending<00:01:26.030> on<00:01:26.090> the<00:01:26.150> food<00:01:26.420> I<00:01:26.660> can<00:01:26.750> use<00:01:27.080> multiple

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:27.560 
depending on the food I can use multiple

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.800 
depending on the food I can use multiple
lights<00:01:27.740> to<00:01:28.040> drive<00:01:28.220> faster<00:01:28.640> and<00:01:28.850> hotter<00:01:29.390> at<00:01:29.750> the

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
lights to drive faster and hotter at the

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:32.140 
lights to drive faster and hotter at the
same<00:01:29.930> time<00:01:30.110> or<00:01:31.100> just<00:01:31.370> a<00:01:31.430> fan<00:01:31.610> if<00:01:31.790> I<00:01:31.880> need<00:01:32.030> to

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:32.150 
same time or just a fan if I need to

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.810 
same time or just a fan if I need to
some<00:01:33.050> recipes<00:01:33.410> such<00:01:33.650> as<00:01:33.770> biltong<00:01:34.160> just<00:01:34.460> they

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
some recipes such as biltong just they

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:39.070 
some recipes such as biltong just they
don't<00:01:34.940> call<00:01:35.150> for<00:01:35.830> heat<00:01:36.830> so<00:01:37.220> I<00:01:37.690> just<00:01:38.690> use<00:01:38.810> a<00:01:38.870> fan

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
don't call for heat so I just use a fan

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.790 
don't call for heat so I just use a fan
and<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:40.760> dehydrator<00:01:41.060> I've<00:01:41.450> made<00:01:41.660> a<00:01:42.080> lot<00:01:42.530> of

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
and this dehydrator I've made a lot of

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:47.560 
and this dehydrator I've made a lot of
beef<00:01:42.980> jerky<00:01:43.810> for<00:01:44.810> small<00:01:45.140> slim<00:01:45.920> pieces<00:01:46.310> I<00:01:46.570> just

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:21.500 
case always depends on spice and the

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.310 
case always depends on spice and the
recipe<00:02:21.830> fall<00:02:22.130> but<00:02:22.940> yes<00:02:23.570> hollinger<00:02:23.870> aqui<00:02:24.140> took

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:24.320 
recipe fall but yes hollinger aqui took

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.140 
recipe fall but yes hollinger aqui took
a<00:02:24.410> few<00:02:24.530> days<00:02:24.650> to<00:02:24.710> because<00:02:25.280> there's<00:02:25.850> a<00:02:25.940> lot<00:02:26.060> of

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
a few days to because there's a lot of

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.150 
a few days to because there's a lot of
oil<00:02:26.420> and<00:02:26.720> sound<00:02:27.020> and<00:02:27.320> it<00:02:27.590> was<00:02:27.710> kind<00:02:27.860> of<00:02:27.890> hard<00:02:28.070> to

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
oil and sound and it was kind of hard to

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.780 
oil and sound and it was kind of hard to
drive

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:28.790 
drive

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.380

bananas apples it takes between one or
two<00:02:38.030> days<00:02:38.210> for<00:02:38.540> fruits<00:02:38.810> and<00:02:39.220> again<00:02:40.220> it<00:02:40.400> depends

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
two days for fruits and again it depends

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.240 
two days for fruits and again it depends
on<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.790> thickness<00:02:41.030> and<00:02:41.650> if<00:02:42.650> you<00:02:42.800> want<00:02:42.980> a<00:02:43.040> chewy

dehydrator<00:03:31.630> it<00:03:32.630> was<00:03:32.990> really<00:03:33.560> moist<00:03:33.770> since<00:03:34.220> I

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
dehydrator it was really moist since I

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.550 
dehydrator it was really moist since I
had<00:03:34.520> to<00:03:34.640> wash<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:35.030> first<00:03:35.240> then<00:03:36.080> it<00:03:36.170> took<00:03:36.290> a<00:03:36.350> long

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
had to wash it first then it took a long

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.320 
had to wash it first then it took a long
time<00:03:36.590> to<00:03:36.860> dehydrate<00:03:37.430> again<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.730> don't<00:03:37.940> remember

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.330 
time to dehydrate again I don't remember

time to dehydrate again I don't remember
how<00:03:38.600> long<00:03:38.690> it<00:03:38.930> took<00:03:39.110> but<00:03:39.610> results<00:03:40.610> were

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
how long it took but results were

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.310 
how long it took but results were
fantastic<00:03:41.110> it<00:03:42.110> lost<00:03:42.410> its<00:03:42.920> color<00:03:43.430> of<00:03:43.640> it<00:03:44.200> but<00:03:45.200> I

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:45.320 
fantastic it lost its color of it but I

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.240 
fantastic it lost its color of it but I
mean<00:03:45.470> taste<00:03:45.770> is<00:03:45.890> good

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
mean taste is good

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.820

now<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:47.360> I<00:03:47.480> had<00:03:47.600> to<00:03:47.690> do<00:03:47.780> it<00:03:47.870> again<00:03:47.959> I'd<00:03:48.590> probably

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:48.830 
now if I had to do it again I'd probably

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:50.710 
now if I had to do it again I'd probably
make<00:03:49.070> it<00:03:49.190> shorter<00:03:49.520> placing<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.209> trays<00:03:50.420> closer

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
make it shorter placing the trays closer

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.870 
make it shorter placing the trays closer
to<00:03:50.959> each<00:03:51.050> other<00:03:51.340> there's<00:03:52.340> a<00:03:52.430> lot<00:03:52.610> of<00:03:52.730> weight

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:52.880 
to each other there's a lot of weight

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:55.690 
to each other there's a lot of weight
wasted<00:03:53.420> space<00:03:53.570> in<00:03:53.780> there<00:03:54.400> sometimes<00:03:55.400> it's

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700 
wasted space in there sometimes it's

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:58.330 
wasted space in there sometimes it's
good<00:03:56.060> if<00:03:56.270> you<00:03:56.750> you<00:03:56.989> like<00:03:57.320> when<00:03:57.950> I<00:03:57.980> Drive<00:03:58.280> my

I just piled it and it took cloud space

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.190 
I just piled it and it took cloud space
but<00:04:04.580> you<00:04:04.940> don't<00:04:05.090> have<00:04:05.209> to<00:04:05.300> use<00:04:05.450> like<00:04:05.630> all<00:04:05.930> the
