00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
really good show I think there is a

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
really good show I think there is a
danger<00:00:57.210> you<00:00:57.600> know<00:00:57.720> maybe<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.410> can<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:58.769> both

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
danger you know maybe you can do both

would<00:00:59.220> it<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.610> hellish<00:01:00.000> difficult<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.840> I

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
would it be hellish difficult and I

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.200 
would it be hellish difficult and I
think<00:01:01.620> this<00:01:01.800> may<00:01:02.010> be<00:01:02.040> a<00:01:02.220> danger<00:01:02.489> that<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.940> show

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
think this may be a danger that the show

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.850 
think this may be a danger that the show
wouldn't<00:01:03.510> be<00:01:03.690> as<00:01:03.960> good<00:01:04.199> as<00:01:04.350> it<00:01:04.500> could<00:01:04.680> or

wouldn't be as good as it could or

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.980 
wouldn't be as good as it could or
should<00:01:04.890> be<00:01:05.100> because<00:01:05.580> you're<00:01:05.759> not<00:01:05.970> looking<00:01:06.660> at
