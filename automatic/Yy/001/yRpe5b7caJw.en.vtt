 and what about his live birdie gamer 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.710
 and this time respond to one of the 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.090
 frequently asked questions 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:20.369
 league players tend to 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:22.230
 to become that champion to play and that is 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:23.400
 extremely important since the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.930
 fact of finding a champion that 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.520
 adapt to you can dictate that also 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.380
 You can achieve to perform within the 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.420
 good game without further ado 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.859
 let's start the first and most important 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.809
 aspect to work is to realize 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.100
 what is your game style I recommend 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.260
 that you think about the way in which 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.420
 you really enjoy playing you like 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.650
 play aggressive or like to play passive 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.199
 what you like to do in the fights of 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.879
 team then think about how in 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:47.129
 individual question would you like to charge 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:49.320
 the games personally how do you like 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:51.989
 win how you would like to generate the greatest 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.699
 impact on your team for example in my 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.650
 case I like to play champions not so 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:57.269
 aggressive nor so passive online but 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.379
 that have a gigantic impact on 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.820
 team fights thanks to their 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.710
 effect area skills and their 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.930
 initiation ability an example of 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.129
 this is brand or salon the next step 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.960
 is to find the champions that are 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.400
 appropriate to your style of play by 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.380
 example to someone who likes to play 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.150
 aggressive would fit a champion who 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.920
 has a very strong line phase and does not 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.960
 is abused by his opponents online 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.670
 just ask yourself how you like 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.560
 play and how would you get to 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.479
 exist 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.829
 then find what kind of 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:23.780
 skills should have a champion 

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:25.220
 to help you achieve your goal at 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.810
 end of this you can create a list of 

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.759
 the champions that best suit you and 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.229
 your style of play do not be afraid of 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.970
 play champions who are not in the goal 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.549
 especially because it's about the solo 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.289
 club is substantially better to play a 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.750
 champion you're good to play with 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.700
 a strong champion within the goal by 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:42.079
 example when I was looking to learn support 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.729
 I made a list of the champions that 

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:45.860
 could be aggressive online and with 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:47.600
 great capacity of zone or initiation and 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.170
 attendance at gangs after several 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.820
 tests 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.500
 I found what was the support that 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.420
 I was looking and I started playing it 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.860
 after a few months I can say that 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.780
 he is now one of my most champions 

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.700
 consistent besides that I have fun 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.830
 a lot playing with the other example of 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.420
 this is will be when I wanted to learn me 

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.649
 I was looking for champions with the ability to 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.810
 harassment very strong and with 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.310
 long distance skills this 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.780
 implied that he could be aggressive in 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.340
 line but that team fights 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.620
 you should take good care of your positioning 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.000
 since if you get caught badly you could 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.040
 cause your team a defeat 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.900
 unnecessary in the end got a list of 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.970
 between approximately 9 champions 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.190
 those who were velcros looks with 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.510
 jp and wax but I ended up staying with 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.739
 the latter because I discovered that I 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.370
 I liked the way you could 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:27.709
 help you 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.120
 team with ultimate and if you look 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.640
 can do something similar without you 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.470
 It will was stronger and good plumbers that 

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.209
 it would be all for the video today I am 

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.099
