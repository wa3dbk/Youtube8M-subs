00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
it getting stuck on your drain you can

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.790 
it getting stuck on your drain you can
put<00:02:04.599> in<00:02:04.779> a<00:02:04.959> second<00:02:05.499> clip<00:02:05.829> over<00:02:06.639> the<00:02:07.090> first<00:02:07.709> in<00:02:08.709> a

put in a second clip over the first in a

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.370 
put in a second clip over the first in a
plus<00:02:09.069> pattern<00:02:09.580> as<00:02:09.729> I've<00:02:10.270> demonstrated<00:02:10.509> here

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.440 

now<00:02:19.310> I'm<00:02:19.370> going<00:02:19.520> to<00:02:19.580> show<00:02:19.730> you<00:02:19.790> how<00:02:19.970> to<00:02:20.030> remove

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
now I'm going to show you how to remove

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.480 
now I'm going to show you how to remove
the<00:02:20.660> main<00:02:20.840> drain<00:02:21.110> clip<00:02:21.350> on<00:02:21.560> from<00:02:22.010> your<00:02:22.190> main

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
the main drain clip on from your main

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.940 
the main drain clip on from your main
drain<00:02:22.820> cover<00:02:23.180> without<00:02:23.780> getting<00:02:24.260> in<00:02:24.380> the<00:02:24.470> water

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
drain cover without getting in the water

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.420 
drain cover without getting in the water
you<00:02:25.250> take<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.640> installation<00:02:26.270> tool<00:02:27.430> maneuver

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
you take the installation tool maneuver

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.410 
you take the installation tool maneuver
it<00:02:28.550> down<00:02:28.760> over<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.270> clip<00:02:30.880> put<00:02:31.880> it<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.120> place

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
it down over the clip put it in place

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.200 
it down over the clip put it in place
and<00:02:32.780> either<00:02:33.530> pull<00:02:33.890> or<00:02:34.130> push<00:02:34.160> on<00:02:34.550> the<00:02:34.670> clip<00:02:34.970> and

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
and either pull or push on the clip and

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:38.380 
and either pull or push on the clip and
it<00:02:35.900> will<00:02:36.050> end<00:02:36.260> you<00:02:36.350> can<00:02:36.530> remove<00:02:36.800> it<00:02:37.270> and<00:02:38.270> it

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
it will end you can remove it and it

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.100 
it will end you can remove it and it
comes<00:02:38.630> off<00:02:38.840> just<00:02:39.080> like<00:02:39.290> that<00:02:39.520> the<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:41.810> clip

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
comes off just like that the the clip

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.140 
comes off just like that the the clip
should<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.500> become<00:02:42.650> dislodged<00:02:43.280> from<00:02:43.940> your

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:44.150 
should it become dislodged from your

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.630 
should it become dislodged from your
from<00:02:44.450> your<00:02:44.630> tool<00:02:45.160> anytime<00:02:46.160> during<00:02:46.370> the

the<00:02:50.390> clip<00:02:50.660> has<00:02:50.810> a<00:02:50.840> specific<00:02:51.410> gravity<00:02:51.620> of<00:02:51.890> less

the clip has a specific gravity of less

the clip has a specific gravity of less
than<00:02:52.430> 1<00:02:52.640> therefore<00:02:53.210> it<00:02:53.480> floats<00:02:53.750> so<00:02:54.470> it<00:02:54.590> will
