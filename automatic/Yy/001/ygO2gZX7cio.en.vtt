is for the police and therefore they're

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.520 
is for the police and therefore they're
allowed<00:01:12.090> to<00:01:12.119> carry<00:01:12.420> out<00:01:12.600> justice<00:01:13.080> in<00:01:13.260> whatever

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
way they see fit so if a person is

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.359 
way they see fit so if a person is
elected<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.960> administer<00:01:16.439> justice<00:01:16.470> who<00:01:17.159> makes

elected to administer justice who makes

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:18.440 
elected to administer justice who makes
sure<00:01:17.520> that<00:01:17.549> they<00:01:17.790> don't<00:01:17.909> step<00:01:18.150> out<00:01:18.299> of<00:01:18.330> line

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
sure that they don't step out of line

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.359 
sure that they don't step out of line
and<00:01:18.750> become<00:01:18.990> a<00:01:19.020> supervillain<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.860> guess<00:01:20.159> the

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
and become a supervillain I guess the

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.100 
and become a supervillain I guess the
boring<00:01:20.700> laws<00:01:20.970> do<00:01:21.299> which<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.840> good<00:01:22.049> thing

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
boring laws do which is a good thing

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.080 
boring laws do which is a good thing
because<00:01:22.409> it<00:01:22.680> helps<00:01:23.040> somewhat<00:01:23.610> stop<00:01:23.939> the

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
because it helps somewhat stop the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.490 
because it helps somewhat stop the
nutjobs<00:01:24.630> from<00:01:24.930> calling<00:01:25.350> themselves

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
nutjobs from calling themselves

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.070 
nutjobs from calling themselves
vigilantes<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:26.549> causing<00:01:26.850> havoc<00:01:27.210> so<00:01:27.570> should

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:28.080 
vigilantes and causing havoc so should

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.600 
vigilantes and causing havoc so should
people<00:01:28.320> be<00:01:28.500> allowed<00:01:28.590> to<00:01:28.860> cover<00:01:29.040> themselves<00:01:29.250> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
people be allowed to cover themselves I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.130 
people be allowed to cover themselves I
mean<00:01:29.759> the<00:01:29.850> police<00:01:30.000> can<00:01:30.299> only<00:01:30.390> be<00:01:30.630> in<00:01:30.750> so<00:01:31.020> many

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
mean the police can only be in so many

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.050 
mean the police can only be in so many
places<00:01:31.290> at<00:01:31.740> one<00:01:31.890> time<00:01:31.920> I<00:01:32.400> could<00:01:32.729> think<00:01:32.850> of<00:01:33.000> a

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
places at one time I could think of a

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.249 
places at one time I could think of a
lot<00:01:33.240> of<00:01:33.390> neighborhoods<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:33.960> not<00:01:34.140> only
