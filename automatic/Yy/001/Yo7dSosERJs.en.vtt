00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.160
 there is no way to pay a 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.719
 very good steering wheel 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.929
 the steering wheel serginho that gives to you 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:18.270
 do at home without spending anything so I 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:21.660
 I used it here you can use it too, right? 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:25.320
 a cap you will need a cap 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.640
 any cover pot 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 ice cream but can also be any 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:33.780
 kind of a bottle cap and here you 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.579
 using a brush may be a cable 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:40.610
 broom anything I used one 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:44.309
 then screw outta work you 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:47.039
 Take it down and here I put a 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:49.610
 washcloth right because so 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.230
 so here it goes then also use the mouse 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.629
 You gotta put the lord we have. 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.489
 what to do like this here you two 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:00.390
 holes in the pot 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.809
 you pass your cable brush so much 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.390
 here in the two holes and in the middle in some 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.670
 place you put the cap on and show 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.360
 you will put the mouse with sensor 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.890
 turned right on her so left Mario 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.720
 business here to be able to show 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:19.259
 you bid button shows that if not 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.979
 able to show that you put the 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:24.570
 Mouse 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:27.270
 so if you make your way to 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.770
 one thing is you will turn right and 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.689
 goes left to left to 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.450
 on the right 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.680
 so you have to let this base is 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.680
 just the opposite 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:43.290
 so when will you come now I'll hold 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.299
 the right your truck was to the right 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:47.340
 to the left to the left 

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.850
 so you can do this by using a 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.829
 trick on heitor two then you come 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:57.570
 options 

00:01:51.829 --> 00:02:02.060
 here's a meeting you have to 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.899
 to select which teaches keyboard in the glaze 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.630
 1194 plus nausea 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:10.830
 you select this and when you 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.660
 pulling your mouse will generate your steering wheel 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:15.690
 You 'll do it in other games but 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:20.160
 I'm using example cutoff 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:25.680
 We're trying to give a little here. Let's go. 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:27.000
 there see if they can give notice to walk 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.330
 calm 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.550
 I was at sakineh repair center 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:36.330
 All right then let's walk a little bit 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:41.670
 here on the street about cerveny only you see 

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:49.050
 which one is cool and I hit it damn I go 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:52.770
 ready truck that problem 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:54.270
 if the mouse came out here always 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:58.650
 that leaving or having to dress seems 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:03:00.480
 not being the steering wheel does not work better 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.440
 that's ten thousand adding up so you're going 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:03.440
 stop working 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.550
 You have to wear a cap and it's okay. 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:11.490
 prefer you to use it to learn how to 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:12.630
 use a lot of stuff but only with a cap 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:15.150
 It worked 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:19.190
 I had to leave it very close to the 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 sensor giving rec 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.410
 I came back to sensitivity much more 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:33.920
 move the steering wheel of the movement games 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:36.239
 it is 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:41.910
 I hope you have enjoyed this 

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:43.440

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.480
