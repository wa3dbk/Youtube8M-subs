Michael over there provided the balloon
for<00:00:29.970> this<00:00:30.119> morning<00:00:30.510> hey<00:00:31.109> Larry<00:00:31.349> today<00:00:31.619> we're

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
for this morning hey Larry today we're

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.500 
for this morning hey Larry today we're
going<00:00:31.920> to<00:00:32.009> talk<00:00:32.219> about<00:00:32.399> convection<00:00:33.300> you

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
going to talk about convection you

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:35.750 
going to talk about convection you
remember<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.020> helium<00:00:34.350> balloon<00:00:34.800> yeah<00:00:35.340> I<00:00:35.370> do

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:35.760 
remember that helium balloon yeah I do

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.090 
remember that helium balloon yeah I do
helium<00:00:36.390> Rises<00:00:36.780> because<00:00:36.899> of<00:00:37.230> buoyancy<00:00:37.680> the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100 
helium Rises because of buoyancy the

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.610 
helium Rises because of buoyancy the
helium<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.850> less<00:00:39.059> dense<00:00:39.270> than<00:00:39.420> oxygen<00:00:40.050> very

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
helium is less dense than oxygen very

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.650 
helium is less dense than oxygen very
good

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:43.660 

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.740 

but<00:00:44.500> why<00:00:44.950> does<00:00:45.190> a<00:00:45.220> hot-air<00:00:45.940> balloon<00:00:45.970> rise<00:00:46.510> I

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
but why does a hot-air balloon rise I

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.810 
but why does a hot-air balloon rise I
mean<00:00:46.900> after<00:00:47.050> all<00:00:47.320> there's<00:00:47.830> air<00:00:48.070> both<00:00:48.280> inside

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
mean after all there's air both inside

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.490 
mean after all there's air both inside
and<00:00:48.850> outside<00:00:49.420> the<00:00:49.810> balloon<00:00:50.020> but<00:00:50.260> the<00:00:50.380> air

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
and outside the balloon but the air

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.979 
and outside the balloon but the air
inside<00:00:50.920> the<00:00:50.980> balloon<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.670> hot<00:00:51.970> in<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.630> air<00:00:52.750> on

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
inside the balloon is hot in the air on

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:54.570 
inside the balloon is hot in the air on
the<00:00:53.110> outside<00:00:53.590> of<00:00:53.710> the<00:00:53.770> balloon<00:00:54.040> is<00:00:54.220> cooler

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:54.580 
the outside of the balloon is cooler

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.420 
the outside of the balloon is cooler
very<00:00:55.210> good<00:00:55.570> I'm<00:00:55.900> impressed<00:00:56.350> anything<00:00:57.280> else

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:57.430 
very good I'm impressed anything else

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:00.990 
very good I'm impressed anything else
well<00:00:58.300> yes<00:00:58.660> as<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.900> matter<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.230> fact<00:00:59.580> if<00:01:00.580> you<00:01:00.760> heat

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 
well yes as a matter of fact if you heat

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:02.820 
well yes as a matter of fact if you heat
a<00:01:01.030> portion<00:01:01.510> of<00:01:01.600> the<00:01:01.690> air<00:01:01.840> the<00:01:02.199> faster<00:01:02.650> moving

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:02.830 
a portion of the air the faster moving

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:04.859 
a portion of the air the faster moving
molecules<00:01:02.980> will<00:01:03.670> push<00:01:03.910> aside<00:01:04.269> the<00:01:04.330> slower

00:01:04.859 --> 00:01:04.869 
molecules will push aside the slower

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:06.510 
molecules will push aside the slower
moving<00:01:05.199> molecules<00:01:05.470> of<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.010> surrounding

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
moving molecules of the surrounding

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.020 
moving molecules of the surrounding
cooler<00:01:06.910> air<00:01:07.150> the<00:01:07.990> warmer<00:01:08.530> air<00:01:08.800> now<00:01:09.369> occupies<00:01:10.000> a

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
cooler air the warmer air now occupies a

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.050 
cooler air the warmer air now occupies a
larger<00:01:10.750> volume<00:01:11.200> than<00:01:11.229> before<00:01:11.800> and<00:01:12.100> so<00:01:12.759> it<00:01:12.910> has

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
larger volume than before and so it has

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.810 
larger volume than before and so it has
a<00:01:13.090> lower<00:01:13.450> density<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.830> because<00:01:15.310> the<00:01:15.430> warmer

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
a lower density and because the warmer

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.130 
a lower density and because the warmer
air<00:01:16.000> is<00:01:16.119> less<00:01:16.390> dense<00:01:16.720> than<00:01:16.899> the<00:01:17.050> surrounding

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
air is less dense than the surrounding

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.359 
air is less dense than the surrounding
cooler<00:01:17.950> air

00:01:18.359 --> 00:01:18.369 
cooler air

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:20.460 
cooler air
the<00:01:18.670> upward<00:01:18.910> buoyant<00:01:19.479> force<00:01:20.020> on<00:01:20.229> the<00:01:20.350> air

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
the upward buoyant force on the air

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.040 
the upward buoyant force on the air
lifts<00:01:21.040> it<00:01:21.130> upward<00:01:21.490> hot<00:01:22.060> air<00:01:22.210> rises<00:01:22.690> just<00:01:22.899> like

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:23.050 
lifts it upward hot air rises just like

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.260 
lifts it upward hot air rises just like
helium<00:01:23.500> gas<00:01:23.740> Rises<00:01:24.340> because<00:01:24.490> the<00:01:24.820> upward

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:25.270 
helium gas Rises because the upward

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:26.999 
helium gas Rises because the upward
buoyant<00:01:25.539> force<00:01:25.990> from<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.320> surrounding<00:01:26.830> air

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
buoyant force from the surrounding air

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.760 
buoyant force from the surrounding air
is<00:01:27.220> greater<00:01:28.149> than<00:01:28.509> the<00:01:28.660> downward<00:01:28.960> force<00:01:29.530> of

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:29.770 
is greater than the downward force of

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.270 
is greater than the downward force of
gravity<00:01:31.380> you're<00:01:32.380> getting<00:01:32.710> too<00:01:32.860> smart<00:01:33.160> for

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280

your own good Larry how'd you know all
that<00:01:35.170> actually<00:01:35.950> everything<00:01:36.310> I<00:01:36.520> learned<00:01:36.759> I

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
that actually everything I learned I

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.430 
that actually everything I learned I
learned<00:01:36.910> from<00:01:37.240> your<00:01:37.360> colleague<00:01:37.810> dr.<00:01:37.899> Alex

hey guys are you doing now where'd you

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.130 
hey guys are you doing now where'd you
come<00:01:43.660> from<00:01:44.020> Wow<00:01:44.850> doesn't<00:01:45.850> matter<00:01:46.180> but<00:01:46.420> how<00:01:47.050> are

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
come from Wow doesn't matter but how are

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:54.219 
come from Wow doesn't matter but how are
we<00:01:47.259> gonna<00:01:47.350> get<00:01:47.590> down

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.240 

well<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:56.030> eventually<00:01:56.509> came<00:01:56.689> down<00:01:57.189> for<00:01:58.189> a

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
well we eventually came down for a

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.010 
well we eventually came down for a
review<00:01:58.610> of<00:01:58.670> what<00:01:58.939> Larry<00:01:59.149> was<00:01:59.240> talking<00:01:59.390> about

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
review of what Larry was talking about

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.469 
review of what Larry was talking about
let's<00:02:00.590> take<00:02:00.799> a<00:02:00.829> look<00:02:01.070> at<00:02:01.159> this<00:02:01.369> model<00:02:01.640> this<00:02:02.329> is

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
let's take a look at this model this is

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:04.569 
let's take a look at this model this is
a<00:02:02.509> convection<00:02:02.990> tank<00:02:03.409> fluid<00:02:03.920> at<00:02:04.009> the<00:02:04.039> center<00:02:04.490> of

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:04.579 
a convection tank fluid at the center of

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:06.669 
a convection tank fluid at the center of
