00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.220
 in the eyes and with base they want come 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:09.030
 another new clairvoyant as they saw it in the 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:10.940
 title update 1.18 is here 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:14.370
 but where are the long-awaited 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.500
 robberies to banks and that brings back the 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:18.990
 truth was a bit disappointing this 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.180
 update but I already know more or less 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.010
 why did they take it out like this and see me 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.140
 I routed red inks on one side if 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.689
 you do not want me to kill you good came through 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.670
 the door here with my character calaca 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.219
 good is the same is once has been included 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:35.280
 1.18 update for the consoles 

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:37.079
 of xbox 360 and playstation 3 that the 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.790
 truth does not bring anything will bring some 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.980
 bug improvements some little things 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.149
 but especially they do not bring anything 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.399
 I know a lot of people will be wondering 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.170
 oliver because it does not bring anything so good 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.210
 there is another one small theory that I believe 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.160
 which is the most feasible the most certain 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.770
 but as you will know when it 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.390
 introduce a new game by telling 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.340
 some way or more than anything a 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.170
 remastering applies a 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 update to the old consoles myself 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.879
 I had told you a few days ago that 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.040
 before version 1.18 came out with 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.570
 the cheating banks were going to get a 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.400
 simply update 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.290
 have taken the game in both 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.150
 devices then this is the most 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.800
 feasible that can happen maybe in 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.200
 these game files are already 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.700
 including what are being robberies 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.619
 to banks simply to go them 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.420
 preparing for some future because as 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.560
 you will know that when you 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.270
 when rockstar some mind 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.490
 small method update 

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.170
 codes to be able to activate them none 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.759
 maybe this indicates that it's going 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.070
 perhaps bringing the robberies closer to 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.810
 banks I sincerely believe that 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.660
 they simply put it because that face or 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.330
 you already know the big point 5 in the 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.420
 xbox version three of these van and 

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:44.610
 playstation 4 and we added nothing nothing 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 like cars nothing like this the only one 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.130
 this room right now, so to speak 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.700
 they want to call some dlc 1.18 would be more 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:55.050
 that nothing happens james an ex yen that was 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.440
 current generation to the new generation 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:01.020
 and it's the new cars not like the 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:03.360
 cheep cars painted boxes 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.090
 scrum of all these things this vehicle 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.800
 which contains a nice moving stamp 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.110
 not that it would be the bliss is compact 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.360
 also the two-door ranger and all 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:14.340
 these vehicles that have been added 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.260
 version there are also some little things 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.580
 that you will already know but more than anything 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:20.010
 it is all this the first person 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.320
 currently we do not have anything maybe it's 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.000
 they repaired something some ship some fault 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.350
 some gual bridges all these things that 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.240
 rockstar mar we like you to be 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.100
 much in their game and for the people who 

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.260
 is asking if ayala absolutely 

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.940
 nothing, I'm just going to show you what 

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.560
 what is the store doing simply 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.350
 let's go here and let's give the 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.209
 they go up san andreas and as you can see what 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.890
 last one that comes out from the last 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.110
 team standing on independence day 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:46.170
 in the hipster update as what 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.300
 they see absolutely nothing again 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.310
 simply what we already had until 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:52.709
 right now it is simply what follows 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.110
 seeing what exactly are the 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.970
 same vehicles but then there is nothing 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.370
 it's not for something that asks a lot 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.590
 people I believe that those who are being 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.170
 robberies to banks and they are going to put them 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.690
 in update 1.19 I think that 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.970
 this version is simply the are 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:11.489
 taking out because the new one has just come out 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:13.890
 version of grand theft auto 5 for xbox 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.570
 and playstation 4 and it was just like 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.610
 to accommodate the servers we are going to 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:19.890
 they will know that the servers are now 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.590
 30 people only in the consoles of 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.530
 new generation and all the changes that 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.210
 have been applied are not going to apply to the 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.670
 current generation that is playstation3 and 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:30.870
 xbox 360 then you tell me what 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.660
 think about all these updates 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.850
 what do you think of the new big car in what 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.190
 platform they like me most sincerely 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:40.590
 the version like that I like the most or 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.360
 the one that I will like the most is going to be 

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.220
 computer because on your computer you 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.080
 they can put mods to the game and all this 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.060
 playing with ironman and much more 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:50.820
 but I do believe that bank robberies 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.560
 they will come out in the update 1.19 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.300
 because we currently have nothing 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.000
 it was simply a version for 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.250
 correct faults or just give yourself the 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.350
 service for what the 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.930
 new multiplayer of grand theft auto ' 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:05.430
 online of xbox and playstation 4 that 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:07.050
 probably that when the 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:09.270
 computer version are going to put 

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:11.670
 another update who knows I do not know 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:14.390
 yes great is auto 5 for the new 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.900
 generation continues with the update the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:22.049
 1.16 1.17 1.18 simply started by 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.610
 the 1.0 I do not know I think they're going to continue 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:26.430
 with this to 118 

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:29.699
 so that it has a congruent sequence 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.110
 and can be made to understand many other 

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:33.539
 things can not be that they are planning 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.219
 many more things and just maybe 

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.259
 our console is not being prepared 

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:39.719
 for the next robberies to banks that 

00:04:37.259 --> 00:04:41.250
 they have been so acclaimed since it came out 

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:43.259
 the game and they did not get them in mode 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:45.689
 multiplayer not a strategy of 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:47.879
 marketing marketing something strange 

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:49.379
 but the truth is that in the end this is going 

00:04:47.879 --> 00:04:51.270
 to be worth so far bye
