00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.750 
don't know goes gold gets approved it's
good<00:01:42.330> to<00:01:42.540> go<00:01:42.750> in<00:01:43.080> theory<00:01:43.830> a<00:01:43.950> switch<00:01:44.340> could<00:01:44.610> be

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:44.760 
good to go in theory a switch could be

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.570 
good to go in theory a switch could be
flipped<00:01:45.210> and<00:01:45.540> suddenly<00:01:46.500> you<00:01:46.830> can<00:01:46.980> download<00:01:47.190> it

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580 
flipped and suddenly you can download it

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.010 
flipped and suddenly you can download it
and<00:01:47.730> that<00:01:48.210> doesn't<00:01:48.330> have<00:01:48.600> to<00:01:48.690> go<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> the

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
and that doesn't have to go to the

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.570 
and that doesn't have to go to the
manufacturing<00:01:49.650> plant<00:01:49.860> for<00:01:50.100> the<00:01:50.159> pressing

manufacturing plant for the pressing

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.899 
manufacturing plant for the pressing
that<00:01:50.940> adds<00:01:51.300> on<00:01:51.600> extra<00:01:52.350> time<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:53.070> so<00:01:53.640> I<00:01:53.670> would

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
that adds on extra time and so I would

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.910 
that adds on extra time and so I would
almost<00:01:54.270> say<00:01:54.540> if<00:01:55.020> you<00:01:55.170> had<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.409> option<00:01:55.710> to

almost say if you had the option to

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.380 
almost say if you had the option to
download<00:01:56.190> something<00:01:56.730> and<00:01:56.940> not<00:01:57.000> have<00:01:57.240> the
