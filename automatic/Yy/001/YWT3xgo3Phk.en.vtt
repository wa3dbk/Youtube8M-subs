00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 hi everyone this is joe young 

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.759
 today I presented you an object 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.899
 pretty original a cardboard box that 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.809
 allows you to transform your 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:11.490
 smartphone in video projector so is 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.910
 what it works we will see all this in 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.910
 this video 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.660
 first of all before having another 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.500
 video projectors we have the right to do 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.779
 DIY 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.220
 In reality this product is cardboard is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.410
 divided into three parts 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.210
 two boxes are to be built one day 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.890
 ensure you have a notice on the box 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.210
 packing to help you but 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:35.219
 personally there is nothing complicated 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.899
 do not worry then by cons 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:38.969
 it will still be necessary to use the 

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:40.890
 glue or tape to secure the 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.230
 different sides at the box 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.940
 so do that for both boxes 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.219
 you follow a little instructions but 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 frankly it's pretty easy for the 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.300
 box we have you the location for 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.280
 position the smartphone will require 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.230
 stick a gripping mat so it's 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.820
 provided with and his share all 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.559
 simply that the smartphone is well 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.930
 grabbed and that he avoids falling all 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.600
 just for info the smartphone does not 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:06.000
 must not exceed 80 mm in width and 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.040
 145 mm of author so for example for a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.140
 smartphone that is more than 5 inches 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.600
 will have trouble getting in and then for 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.909
 to finish on the objective where it will be necessary 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.950
 position a lens in the hole 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.479
 then we assemble all that and we have 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.820
 almost done you just have to do 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.450
 a few small manipulations on his 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.520
 smartphone 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 indeed for you to be well 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.189
 read your movies that are on your 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.439
 smartphone 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.420
 the screen needs to be oriented 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.950
 reverse landscape mode for that on 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.170
 android you will see download a 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.509
 ultimate rotation control application 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:39.210
 and tick reverse landscape I just 

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:40.860
 receive a little snapshot message 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.110
 for those who do not know I accept or 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.540
 no on snapshots and jojo 67 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.939
 brief about ios you have to go though 

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.490
 in the general accessibility settings 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.860
 activate the assistive option touch you 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.479
 have this little round that will show up and 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.950
 when you will start your movie 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.110
 you press the broke in 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.399
 devices turn the screen you go 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.740
 choose either right or left 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:03.719
 the goal is to have the screen reversed 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:07.049
 when you go to get him into 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.429
 the box of the projector then verdict 

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:09.720
 does it work weapons and and the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.240
 volume thoroughly the line to hits is at 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.620
 background and try to be in 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.690
 1 to 3 meters from where you 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.640
 want to spread the image you and denied 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.230
 all the lights and yes it works 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:20.300
 really the quality is not 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.310
 exceptional but it still works 

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.050
 afterwards for those who want to settle the 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.030
 size and display quality it takes 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.100
 just play between the distance between 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.750
 the lens and the smartphone so be 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:31.430
 you move the goal be you 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.350
 move the cardboard where you have the 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.010
 smartphone happens I find it pretty 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.630
 original 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:38.270
 after that it's still pretty gadget 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.830

 around 20 euros 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:47.540
