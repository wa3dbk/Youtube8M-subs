a store I think it's really classic and
for<00:01:05.309> me<00:01:05.490> working<00:01:05.730> in<00:01:06.060> like<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.390> guess<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460 
corporate field I think it's a really

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.670 
corporate field I think it's a really
great<00:01:08.580> balance<00:01:08.880> for<00:01:09.750> femininity<00:01:10.410> and

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
also very feminine and clever idea of

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.540 
also very feminine and clever idea of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
interesting the triangular detail and

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.780 
interesting the triangular detail and
panel<00:01:25.260> that<00:01:25.770> helps<00:01:26.340> with<00:01:26.460> a<00:01:26.520> little

panel that helps with a little

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.270 
panel that helps with a little
elongation<00:01:27.410> it<00:01:28.410> definitely<00:01:28.770> gives<00:01:28.890> me<00:01:29.130> more
