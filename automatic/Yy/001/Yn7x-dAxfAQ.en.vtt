00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
saw my earlier video you saw that the

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.850 
saw my earlier video you saw that the
mean<00:00:39.239> bean<00:00:39.540> was<00:00:39.780> one<00:00:39.930> of<00:00:40.020> my<00:00:40.110> favorite<00:00:40.559> lures

mean bean was one of my favorite lures

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.430 
mean bean was one of my favorite lures
and<00:00:41.129> I<00:00:41.940> can't<00:00:42.210> really<00:00:42.480> find<00:00:42.719> anywhere<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.230> buy

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
and I can't really find anywhere to buy

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.979 
and I can't really find anywhere to buy
those<00:00:43.710> anymore<00:00:44.210> so<00:00:45.210> when<00:00:45.360> I<00:00:45.390> saw<00:00:45.690> this<00:00:45.930> I

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
those anymore so when I saw this I

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.330 
those anymore so when I saw this I
thought<00:00:46.230> hey<00:00:47.190> I<00:00:47.219> should<00:00:47.579> buy<00:00:47.789> that<00:00:48.739> comes<00:00:49.739> one

thought hey I should buy that comes one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.979 
thought hey I should buy that comes one
obvious<00:00:50.879> difference<00:00:51.270> between<00:00:51.539> this<00:00:51.660> is<00:00:51.840> the

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
obvious difference between this is the

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.939 
obvious difference between this is the
mean<00:00:52.199> bean<00:00:52.469> is<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.920> this<00:00:53.100> one's<00:00:53.370> larger<00:00:54.239> and

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
mean bean is that this one's larger and

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:58.520 
mean bean is that this one's larger and
it<00:00:55.949> dives<00:00:56.850> a<00:00:57.149> little<00:00:57.390> bit<00:00:57.539> deeper<00:00:57.989> and<00:00:58.020> it's<00:00:58.410> a

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
it dives a little bit deeper and it's a

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.709 
it dives a little bit deeper and it's a
little<00:00:58.770> bit<00:00:58.920> larger<00:00:59.430> but<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.120> don't<00:01:00.359> think<00:01:00.510> that

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
little bit larger but I don't think that

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.349 
little bit larger but I don't think that
should<00:01:00.930> be<00:01:01.079> an<00:01:01.170> issue<00:01:01.550> the<00:01:02.550> next<00:01:02.820> bloor<00:01:03.059> is<00:01:03.329> a

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
should be an issue the next bloor is a

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.179 
should be an issue the next bloor is a
lure<00:01:03.629> that<00:01:03.719> I've<00:01:03.930> caught<00:01:04.199> fish<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.710> before<00:01:05.159> I
