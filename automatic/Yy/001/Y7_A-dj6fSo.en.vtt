00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:21.240 
what a fun name right cold and hot fire

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.359 
what a fun name right cold and hot fire
we're<00:00:21.810> in<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> fire<00:00:22.230> and<00:00:22.500> we've<00:00:22.650> moved<00:00:22.949> to<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
we're in the fire and we've moved to the

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.029 
we're in the fire and we've moved to the
glass<00:00:23.640> fusing<00:00:24.300> parts<00:00:24.689> of<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.410> fire<00:00:25.619> at<00:00:25.980> least

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
glass fusing parts of the fire at least

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.730 
glass fusing parts of the fire at least
what<00:00:26.670> is<00:00:26.789> glass<00:00:27.060> fusing<00:00:27.539> okay<00:00:28.199> so<00:00:28.260> glass

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
what is glass fusing okay so glass

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.890 
what is glass fusing okay so glass
fusing<00:00:29.250> is<00:00:29.429> where<00:00:29.640> you<00:00:29.910> start<00:00:30.210> out<00:00:30.300> with<00:00:30.570> a

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
fusing is where you start out with a

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.290 
fusing is where you start out with a
clear<00:00:31.320> base<00:00:31.470> of<00:00:31.710> glass<00:00:31.920> like<00:00:32.640> we<00:00:32.790> have<00:00:32.910> here<00:00:33.149> so

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
clear base of glass like we have here so

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.660 
clear base of glass like we have here so
a<00:00:33.329> circular<00:00:33.780> base<00:00:33.960> it's<00:00:34.230> just<00:00:34.469> a<00:00:34.559> flat<00:00:34.950> flat

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
a circular base it's just a flat flat

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.180 
a circular base it's just a flat flat
piece<00:00:35.940> yep<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.780> then<00:00:37.110> in<00:00:37.649> its<00:00:37.829> special

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
piece yep and then in its special

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:41.660 
piece yep and then in its special
melting<00:00:38.579> glass<00:00:38.790> so<00:00:39.120> then<00:00:39.690> we<00:00:40.079> layer<00:00:41.040> colored

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:41.670 
melting glass so then we layer colored

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.049 
melting glass so then we layer colored
pieces<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.450> to<00:00:43.379> our<00:00:43.620> base<00:00:43.800> piece<00:00:44.129> like<00:00:44.910> in

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
pieces on to our base piece like in

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.850 
pieces on to our base piece like in
whatever<00:00:45.300> pattern<00:00:45.989> their<00:00:46.170> design<00:00:46.469> you<00:00:46.680> want

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
whatever pattern their design you want

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.729 
whatever pattern their design you want
and<00:00:47.370> then<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.910> gets<00:00:48.120> really<00:00:48.840> hot<00:00:49.230> in<00:00:49.410> the<00:00:49.530> kiln

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
and then it gets really hot in the kiln

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.790 
and then it gets really hot in the kiln
so<00:00:50.100> it's<00:00:50.340> about<00:00:50.460> 1400<00:00:51.210> degrees<00:00:51.530> and<00:00:52.530> we'll

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
so it's about 1400 degrees and we'll

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.740 
so it's about 1400 degrees and we'll
melt<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.100> flat<00:00:53.309> once<00:00:53.579> and<00:00:53.969> then<00:00:54.329> if<00:00:54.449> we<00:00:54.570> want

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
melt it flat once and then if we want

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.619 
melt it flat once and then if we want
something<00:00:55.110> like<00:00:55.260> a<00:00:55.289> bowl<00:00:55.620> here<00:00:56.370> we<00:00:57.270> also<00:00:57.480> have

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
something like a bowl here we also have

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.840 
something like a bowl here we also have
the<00:00:57.870> option<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.320> shaping<00:00:58.649> pieces<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.670> that's

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
the option of shaping pieces so that's

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.590 
the option of shaping pieces so that's
where<00:01:00.059> this<00:01:00.270> white<00:01:00.570> mold<00:01:01.559> here<00:01:02.129> comes<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.059> hand

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
where this white mold here comes in hand

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.050 
where this white mold here comes in hand
there<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:05.010> glass<00:01:05.189> piece<00:01:05.489> will<00:01:05.670> melt<00:01:05.820> down

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
there the glass piece will melt down

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.210 
there the glass piece will melt down
into<00:01:06.330> it<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.810> get<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:06.990> bowl<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.650> now<00:01:07.680> I<00:01:07.830> want<00:01:08.159> to

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
into it you get a bowl so now I want to

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.590 
into it you get a bowl so now I want to
show<00:01:08.340> you<00:01:08.400> some<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:08.880> other<00:01:09.030> fun<00:01:09.330> things

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
process of glazing it we have some

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
process of glazing it we have some
footage<00:01:18.869> that<00:01:19.229> we<00:01:19.290> shot<00:01:19.320> earlier<00:01:19.799> of<00:01:19.920> my

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
footage that we shot earlier of my

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.340 
footage that we shot earlier of my
monkey<00:01:20.820> going<00:01:21.150> into<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.509> glaze<00:01:21.750> okay<00:01:22.290> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
monkey going into the glaze okay so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.929 
monkey going into the glaze okay so
first<00:01:22.799> of<00:01:22.890> all<00:01:22.979> we<00:01:23.189> have<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.430> big<00:01:23.610> bin<00:01:23.790> of

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
first of all we have the big bin of

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.270 
first of all we have the big bin of
glaze<00:01:24.210> that<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.540> mix<00:01:24.780> up<00:01:24.960> and<00:01:25.560> then<00:01:25.710> we<00:01:26.040> have

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
glaze that we mix up and then we have

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.460 
glaze that we mix up and then we have
tongs<00:01:26.970> that<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.360> grab<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.810> pottery<00:01:28.170> piece

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
tongs that we grab the pottery piece

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.219 
tongs that we grab the pottery piece
with<00:01:28.710> and<00:01:29.009> we'll<00:01:29.220> dip<00:01:29.400> it<00:01:29.549> in<00:01:29.820> and<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.930> coats

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
with and we'll dip it in and that coats

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:32.690 
with and we'll dip it in and that coats
it<00:01:31.380> with<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> clear<00:01:31.770> /<00:01:32.009> glaze<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.369> makes<00:01:32.549> it

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
it with a clear / glaze that makes it

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.550 
it with a clear / glaze that makes it
shiny<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.119> protected<00:01:33.600> and<00:01:33.780> then<00:01:34.170> we<00:01:34.259> load<00:01:34.409> it

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
shiny and protected and then we load it

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.830 
shiny and protected and then we load it
into<00:01:34.770> the<00:01:34.860> kiln<00:01:35.070> heats<00:01:35.460> up<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.790> about<00:01:35.970> 1900

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
into the kiln heats up to about 1900

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.710 
into the kiln heats up to about 1900
degrees<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.970> yeah<00:01:38.970> and<00:01:39.180> then<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> comes<00:01:39.570> out

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
degrees and yeah and then it comes out

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.690 
degrees and yeah and then it comes out
to<00:01:39.869> be<00:01:39.900> this<00:01:40.110> beautiful<00:01:40.290> work<00:01:41.009> of<00:01:41.100> art<00:01:41.220> Ruth

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
to be this beautiful work of art Ruth

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:43.639 
to be this beautiful work of art Ruth
and<00:01:41.909> so<00:01:42.390> how<00:01:42.659> long<00:01:42.899> will<00:01:43.140> it<00:01:43.170> take
