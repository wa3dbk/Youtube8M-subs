we<00:00:46.230> wrote<00:00:46.590> a<00:00:46.620> quick<00:00:46.800> start<00:00:47.160> just<00:00:47.640> looking<00:00:47.910> for

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
we wrote a quick start just looking for

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.310 
we wrote a quick start just looking for
my<00:00:48.120> heart<00:00:48.329> rate<00:00:48.480> strap<00:00:48.720> which<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.140> have

my heart rate strap which I don't have

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.470 
my heart rate strap which I don't have
or<00:00:49.710> my<00:00:49.980> headset<00:00:50.370> I<00:00:50.579> think<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.150> i<00:00:51.210> can<00:00:51.270> start

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
or my headset I think so i can start

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.900 
or my headset I think so i can start
without<00:00:51.690> it<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.530> so<00:00:52.650> it<00:00:52.800> worked<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:53.790> the

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
without it and so it worked with the

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.490 
without it and so it worked with the
headset<00:00:54.270> but<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.540> you<00:00:54.629> use<00:00:54.780> other<00:00:54.960> are<00:00:55.320> there

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
headset but can you use other are there

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.350 
headset but can you use other are there
other<00:00:55.620> heart<00:00:55.860> rate<00:00:56.010> accessory<00:00:56.400> absalom<00:00:56.910> so<00:00:57.239> it

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
other heart rate accessory absalom so it

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.780 
other heart rate accessory absalom so it
has<00:00:57.480> an<00:00:57.600> amp<00:00:57.750> bus<00:00:57.960> sensor<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:58.710> boe<00:00:59.220> so<00:00:59.640> it

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
has an amp bus sensor and and boe so it

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:01.369
