softened<00:02:04.530> butter<00:02:04.619> I<00:02:04.860> didn't<00:02:05.039> know<00:02:05.100> what<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.280> was

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
softened butter I didn't know what I was

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.709 
softened butter I didn't know what I was
doing<00:02:05.520> there<00:02:05.640> for<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> second<00:02:06.090> so<00:02:06.299> honey<00:02:06.539> butter

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
doing there for a second so honey butter

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:10.249 
doing there for a second so honey butter
goes<00:02:07.170> in<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.940> basically<00:02:08.940> stick<00:02:09.600> that<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:10.019> and

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
goes in and basically stick that on and

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.289 
goes in and basically stick that on and
we're<00:02:10.619> gonna<00:02:10.739> slowly<00:02:11.220> mix<00:02:11.519> this<00:02:11.700> up<00:02:11.880> until<00:02:12.209> we

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
we're gonna slowly mix this up until we

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:16.490 
we're gonna slowly mix this up until we
have<00:02:12.420> a<00:02:12.450> nice<00:02:12.630> smooth<00:02:12.989> mixture<00:02:15.290> now<00:02:16.290> you'll

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
have a nice smooth mixture now you'll

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.870 
have a nice smooth mixture now you'll
notice<00:02:16.739> that<00:02:16.920> I'm<00:02:17.040> doing<00:02:17.130> this<00:02:17.280> very<00:02:17.549> slowly

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
notice that I'm doing this very slowly

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.250 
notice that I'm doing this very slowly
just<00:02:18.090> until<00:02:18.390> the<00:02:18.450> icing<00:02:18.810> sugar<00:02:18.930> and<00:02:19.079> the

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
just until the icing sugar and the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.720 
just until the icing sugar and the
butter<00:02:19.350> has<00:02:19.620> been<00:02:19.650> incorporated<00:02:20.489> because

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
butter has been incorporated because

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.250 
butter has been incorporated because
otherwise<00:02:21.060> if<00:02:21.299> you<00:02:21.390> do<00:02:21.480> it<00:02:21.600> full<00:02:21.780> speed<00:02:21.810> you

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
otherwise if you do it full speed you

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.349 
otherwise if you do it full speed you
get<00:02:22.380> left<00:02:22.650> in<00:02:22.769> a<00:02:22.890> cloud<00:02:23.220> of<00:02:23.519> icing<00:02:24.000> sugar<00:02:24.030> and

00:02:24.349 --> 00:02:24.359 
get left in a cloud of icing sugar and

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:26.810 
get left in a cloud of icing sugar and
