00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
so today we are playing Crash tastic and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:07.980 
so today we are playing Crash tastic and
I'm<00:00:06.670> going<00:00:07.000> to<00:00:07.089> be<00:00:07.330> showing<00:00:07.630> you<00:00:07.960> a

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:07.990 
I'm going to be showing you a

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:10.770 
I'm going to be showing you a
demonstration<00:00:09.000> how<00:00:10.000> to<00:00:10.059> make<00:00:10.389> a<00:00:10.420> full

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:10.780 
demonstration how to make a full

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:12.720 
demonstration how to make a full
function<00:00:11.320> car<00:00:11.559> you<00:00:11.710> can<00:00:11.889> steer<00:00:12.160> left<00:00:12.370> you<00:00:12.580> can

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:12.730 
function car you can steer left you can

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.100 
function car you can steer left you can
see<00:00:12.910> the<00:00:12.969> right<00:00:13.210> and<00:00:13.420> you<00:00:13.509> can<00:00:13.660> go<00:00:13.780> backwards

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
see the right and you can go backwards

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.589 
see the right and you can go backwards
and<00:00:14.620> forward<00:00:15.390> so<00:00:16.390> just<00:00:17.789> put<00:00:18.789> me<00:00:18.939> try<00:00:19.179> and<00:00:19.419> look

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
and forward so just put me try and look

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.460 
and forward so just put me try and look
look<00:00:20.579> you<00:00:21.579> can<00:00:21.759> see<00:00:21.999> right<00:00:22.210> now<00:00:22.539> I<00:00:22.569> stopped<00:00:23.289> my

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:23.470 
look you can see right now I stopped my

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:31.710 
look you can see right now I stopped my
Rockets<00:00:24.039> and<00:00:24.460> now<00:00:25.179> I<00:00:29.550> so<00:00:30.550> I<00:00:30.939> will<00:00:31.389> just<00:00:31.539> make<00:00:31.659> a

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:31.720 
Rockets and now I so I will just make a

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:35.040 
Rockets and now I so I will just make a
demonstration<00:00:31.929> easier<00:00:32.800> right<00:00:33.219> here<00:00:33.750> so<00:00:34.750> we

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
demonstration easier right here so we

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:36.869 
demonstration easier right here so we
just<00:00:35.199> go<00:00:35.379> to<00:00:35.440> tune<00:00:35.949> and<00:00:36.280> then<00:00:36.429> I'm<00:00:36.489> gonna<00:00:36.609> put

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
just go to tune and then I'm gonna put

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.400 
just go to tune and then I'm gonna put
rocket<00:00:37.510> you<00:00:38.230> see<00:00:38.500> right<00:00:38.769> here<00:00:39.570> W<00:00:40.570> is<00:00:40.780> your<00:00:41.050> side

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
rocket you see right here W is your side

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.009 
rocket you see right here W is your side
key<00:00:41.829> for<00:00:42.280> this<00:00:42.460> one<00:00:42.730> all<00:00:45.390> the<00:00:46.390> rockets<00:00:46.929> that

00:00:47.009 --> 00:00:47.019 
key for this one all the rockets that

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:51.000 
key for this one all the rockets that
are<00:00:47.289> facing<00:00:47.559> going<00:00:48.489> this<00:00:48.760> way<00:00:49.059> is<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:50.559> rockets

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
are facing going this way is the rockets

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:59.459 
are facing going this way is the rockets
put<00:00:51.249> W<00:00:51.909> so<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:54.070> goes<00:00:54.550> forward<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.920> then<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:59.230> it

00:00:59.459 --> 00:00:59.469 
put W so it goes forward and then so it

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:02.309 
put W so it goes forward and then so it
goes<00:00:59.710> forward<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.640> also<00:01:01.149> go<00:01:01.329> backwards<00:01:01.690> so

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:02.319 
goes forward and also go backwards so

00:01:02.319 --> 00:01:04.110 
goes forward and also go backwards so
the<00:01:02.530> one<00:01:02.739> is<00:01:02.980> facing<00:01:03.399> the<00:01:03.519> other<00:01:03.699> way

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:04.120 
the one is facing the other way

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.770 
the one is facing the other way
it's<00:01:05.019> put<00:01:05.379> X<00:01:05.680> so<00:01:06.189> X<00:01:06.549> is<00:01:06.909> for<00:01:07.090> backwards<00:01:07.509> the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
it's put X so X is for backwards the

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:11.810 
it's put X so X is for backwards the
viewers<00:01:08.140> for<00:01:08.350> forward<00:01:08.829> and<00:01:09.040> steering<00:01:09.820> D<00:01:10.329> and<00:01:10.570> a

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
viewers for forward and steering D and a

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.590 
viewers for forward and steering D and a
just<00:01:12.820> like<00:01:13.000> in<00:01:13.149> halo<00:01:13.509> so<00:01:14.549> it's<00:01:15.549> pretty<00:01:16.000> easy<00:01:16.390> to

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
just like in halo so it's pretty easy to

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:21.690 
just like in halo so it's pretty easy to
make<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:18.159> me<00:01:18.659> the<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:20.740> wasn't<00:01:21.100> easy<00:01:21.250> for<00:01:21.579> the

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
make to me the it wasn't easy for the

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.870 
make to me the it wasn't easy for the
car<00:01:22.000> you<00:01:22.799> don't<00:01:23.799> need<00:01:23.979> to<00:01:24.070> put<00:01:24.250> any<00:01:24.460> suspension

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
car you don't need to put any suspension

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.910 
car you don't need to put any suspension
because<00:01:25.360> if<00:01:25.540> you<00:01:25.689> do<00:01:25.960> put<00:01:26.320> any<00:01:26.439> suspension

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
because if you do put any suspension

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.179 
because if you do put any suspension
what<00:01:27.670> L<00:01:27.880> will<00:01:28.030> do<00:01:28.240> is<00:01:28.600> just<00:01:28.630> make<00:01:28.960> up<00:01:29.140> worse<00:01:29.680> I

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
what L will do is just make up worse I

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.520 
what L will do is just make up worse I
mean<00:01:31.090> you<00:01:31.210> can<00:01:31.329> put<00:01:31.479> suspension<00:01:32.170> but<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.439> have

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
mean you can put suspension but you have

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.399 
mean you can put suspension but you have
to<00:01:32.649> put<00:01:32.829> the<00:01:32.890> power<00:01:33.130> like<00:01:33.399> hell<00:01:33.729> god<00:01:34.409> man

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
to put the power like hell god man

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:38.690 
to put the power like hell god man
strong<00:01:36.070> so<00:01:36.759> because<00:01:37.299> if<00:01:37.509> you<00:01:37.630> don't<00:01:37.960> do<00:01:38.289> that

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:38.700 
strong so because if you don't do that

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.880 
strong so because if you don't do that
what's<00:01:39.700> going<00:01:39.909> to<00:01:40.000> happen<00:01:40.509> is<00:01:40.780> it<00:01:41.259> keeps<00:01:41.590> going

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:41.890 
what's going to happen is it keeps going

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:43.950 
what's going to happen is it keeps going
down<00:01:42.189> and<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> movement<00:01:43.000> is<00:01:43.060> the<00:01:43.299> floor<00:01:43.630> and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
down and the movement is the floor and

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:47.099 
down and the movement is the floor and
you<00:01:44.079> will<00:01:44.229> never<00:01:44.409> have<00:01:44.590> a<00:01:44.649> big<00:01:44.890> car<00:01:45.750> so<00:01:46.750> we'll

00:01:47.099 --> 00:01:47.109 
you will never have a big car so we'll

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:49.480 
you will never have a big car so we'll
just<00:01:47.350> go<00:01:47.469> take<00:01:47.680> take<00:01:48.310> this<00:01:48.490> for<00:01:48.729> a<00:01:48.759> test<00:01:48.789> run

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
just go take take this for a test run

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:59.550 
just go take take this for a test run
oh<00:01:51.220> no<00:01:52.220> no<00:01:52.640> not<00:01:52.909> that<00:01:52.940> not<00:01:53.270> that<00:01:53.330> not<00:01:53.690> that

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:04.070 
hey now we're going to speed up the

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:07.990 
hey now we're going to speed up the
records<00:02:04.490> back<00:02:04.640> it<00:02:04.880> back<00:02:05.030> to<00:02:05.270> backwards<00:02:06.700> no<00:02:07.700> no

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
going like super fast like 105 some

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.840 
going like super fast like 105 some
because<00:02:46.970> if<00:02:47.090> you<00:02:47.300> do<00:02:47.480> that<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.980> club<00:02:49.400> it's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
because if you do that the club it's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:55.830 
because if you do that the club it's
like<00:02:50.120> so<00:02:50.959> it's<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.800> very<00:02:52.130> good<00:02:52.459> simulator<00:02:53.739> and

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:55.840 
like so it's a very good simulator and

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:59.110 
like so it's a very good simulator and
if<00:02:56.840> you<00:02:57.019> turn<00:02:57.350> too<00:02:57.620> much<00:02:57.829> you<00:02:58.010> know<00:02:58.130> like<00:02:58.160> flip

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
if you turn too much you know like flip

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:02.680 
if you turn too much you know like flip
your<00:02:59.299> whole<00:02:59.450> car<00:02:59.840> over<00:03:00.230> and<00:03:00.350> see<00:03:00.590> oh<00:03:01.480> the<00:03:02.480> light

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
your whole car over and see oh the light

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.930 
your whole car over and see oh the light
oh<00:03:03.049> no<00:03:03.890> I'm<00:03:04.040> not<00:03:04.250> oh<00:03:05.320> my<00:03:06.320> gosh<00:03:06.590> the<00:03:07.370> cost<00:03:07.610> like

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:07.940 
oh no I'm not oh my gosh the cost like

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.800 
oh no I'm not oh my gosh the cost like
cars<00:03:08.420> flying<00:03:08.750> cars<00:03:09.140> flying<00:03:11.920> so<00:03:12.920> now<00:03:13.850> I'm<00:03:14.150> going

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:56.980 

and<00:04:53.300> then<00:04:53.480> you<00:04:54.170> gotta<00:04:54.380> tune<00:04:54.970> you<00:04:55.970> get<00:04:56.150> close<00:04:56.690> to

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:56.990 
and then you gotta tune you get close to

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:00.520 
and then you gotta tune you get close to
it<00:04:57.020> you<00:04:57.710> put<00:04:57.980> single<00:04:58.420> then<00:04:59.420> you<00:04:59.840> click<00:05:00.350> on<00:05:00.470> the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:00.530 
it you put single then you click on the

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:03.430 
it you put single then you click on the
backwards<00:05:01.160> one<00:05:01.460> and<00:05:01.700> then<00:05:01.820> you<00:05:01.940> put<00:05:02.180> s<00:05:02.420> any<00:05:03.110> key

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
backwards one and then you put s any key

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:15.590 
backwards one and then you put s any key
you<00:05:03.470> want<00:05:03.770> as<00:05:04.160> for<00:05:05.030> backwards<00:05:05.480> for<00:05:05.660> me<00:05:05.690> and<00:05:06.190> w<00:05:07.330> w

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:15.600 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.480 

oh<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:18.450> let<00:05:18.660> you<00:05:19.350> sign<00:05:19.710> them<00:05:19.890> like<00:05:20.100> that<00:05:20.280> if

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
oh and let you sign them like that if

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.360 
oh and let you sign them like that if
you<00:05:20.580> want<00:05:21.110> and<00:05:22.110> then<00:05:22.260> the<00:05:22.980> ones<00:05:23.160> that<00:05:23.280> are

you want and then the ones that are
facing<00:05:23.490> this<00:05:23.820> way<00:05:23.880> you<00:05:24.090> put<00:05:24.750> on<00:05:24.990> one<00:05:25.800> heat<00:05:26.130> and

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
facing this way you put on one heat and

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.700 
facing this way you put on one heat and
the<00:05:27.090> balloons<00:05:27.420> are<00:05:27.540> Christmas<00:05:27.990> right<00:05:28.170> you<00:05:28.320> put

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:28.710 
the balloons are Christmas right you put

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:31.280 
the balloons are Christmas right you put
another<00:05:29.010> key<00:05:29.280> to<00:05:29.460> them<00:05:29.610> and<00:05:30.480> now<00:05:30.750> how<00:05:31.110> this

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:31.290 
another key to them and now how this

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:36.260 
another key to them and now how this
works<00:05:31.350> is<00:05:31.890> like<00:05:32.040> this<00:05:34.490> not<00:05:35.490> it<00:05:35.850> go<00:05:36.030> backwards

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270 
works is like this not it go backwards
