00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:25.169
 number 7 tower base assembly kit 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:26.429
 parts needed to continue assembly 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.070
 tower bases 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:31.050
 6 fixing screws for this 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.090
 let you take a reason 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.489
 tower container number three hundred 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:39.210
 thirty one from the previous number for 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:43.110
 Assembling two screws and a screwdriver based on 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:48.300
 towers find two holes for fasteners 

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:51.900
 our container 331 before starting 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.489
 assembly check how the input mounts 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.260
 grooves 

00:00:52.489 --> 00:00:57.390
 fit together attach 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.699
 docking each other up to 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:04.920
 make sure they match each other 

00:00:59.699 --> 00:01:07.439
 fits tightly alternately insert two 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.270
 screw into the grooves and 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:13.939
 using a screwdriver without special 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.939
 effort twist them all the way 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.770
 leave small gaps between 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:31.689
 the details and the head of the screw that in 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.420
 further adjust them more tightly 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:36.909
 each other attaching the base of the tower 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:44.380
 dome tower you make sure both parts 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:49.119
 match perfectly however not 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:52.090
 it is necessary to connect these parts with screws so 

00:01:49.119 --> 00:01:55.200
 as we will need both later 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.200
 parts separately
