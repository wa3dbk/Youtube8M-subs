00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:13.040
 how to medicate with a dressing 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.090
 advanced hydrocolloid based one 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.160
 wound or wax -based dressings 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.940
 of hydrocolloids are among the most 

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.039
 used 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.630
 have the main function of 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:26.150
 remove the fibrin from the tissue 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.420
 necrotic from the bottom of lucera have 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.490
 often a good pain-relieving action 

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:33.980
 are contraindicated when I shine 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:37.399
 signs of infection or very giving and 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:41.450
 wets a lot are usually changed 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:44.120
 every second fourth day sometimes yes 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.370
 they associate the ointment with a hydrogel that 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:50.090
 upgrade their cleaning action up 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:52.010
 lucera to prepare all the material 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:55.970
 necessary on a support plane 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:58.360
 covered with a clean cloth gauze gloves 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:01.100
 sterile saline solution 

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:03.770
 hydrocolloid-based dressing e 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.799
 scissors that can be used to cut 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:08.090
 the medication of the right size 

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.579
 place a bag nearby for 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.650
 waste so you can immediately throw 

00:01:10.579 --> 00:01:14.690
 the old dressing of the material that 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.390
 it will get dirty then close it at the end 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.060
 of the operation is to eliminate with refusal 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:22.640
 dry thoroughly wash your hands and 

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.940
 wrists are just the greater hands 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.830
 transmission vehicle of infections 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:29.590
 use normal soap and prolong 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.860
 wash for at least three minutes 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:35.390
 wear non-sterile disposable gloves 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.580
 remove the old dressing not 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.050
 seeing it with saline solution if 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:42.660
 too close to proceed 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:45.180
 nothing is ever out of tear because this 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.250
 medication is inherently adherent ed 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.460
 it is necessary to minimize the 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.930
 traumatism on thin skin is normal 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.080
 that the removal is present 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 yellowish material the gelatinous 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.580
 take a gauze touching only the 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:02.070
 outside wet it with solution 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:04.620
 physiological and clean the bottom of the well 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:06.990
 lucera with moderate pressure 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:09.450
 to promote depression and doing 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.540
 circular movements from the center to the 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:14.850
 periphery repeat the operation for 23 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.800
 times because the cleaning of lucera is 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.500
 very important for the process 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.810
 healing also clean the skin well 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.140
 around lucera but never proceed 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.690
 dry from the outside inwards 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.440
 with sterile gauze otherwise it will not be there 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:32.820
 then a good adhesion of the dressing 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.890
 apply the topical of associations 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.830
 always written on the bottom of lucera 

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.260
 using a sterile gauze otherwise 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.900
 use only the application based on 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:45.890
 hydrocolloids always touch only the 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:47.880
 outside of gaza or dressing 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.980
 cut the dressing of one 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.850
 such a size that goes about 3 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:55.260
 centimeters beyond the edge of the ulcer 

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.170
 remove the film covering the part 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.030
 who must be in contact with the skin 

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.960
 apply and fix with dressing 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.509
 secondary
