00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.469
 channel I am a doctor and today you 

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.500
 You will see how to make a design for your 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.560
 nails with newspapers are very nice are 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.539
 very original and they are super easy what 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.610
 best of all so if you want to know 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.440
 how to make these wedges, yes 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.210
 well let's use very few 

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:27.070
 implements the first of them is going to be 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.680
 different color nail polishes 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.150
 Slavers preferably of such 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.020
 way that all children who 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 let's know perfectly 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.430
 Scissors and tweezers are also needed 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:42.430
 [Music] 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.710
 [Music] 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:56.590
 alcohol is very important for this says 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:58.480
 [Music] 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:00.020
 a shine of some transparent for 

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:06.049
 protect your design 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:06.049
 [Music] 

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.810
 and of course the star implement the 

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:12.810
 Newspaper 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.060
 let's start painting all our 

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.890
 color nails that we prefer in my case 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.720
 I painted it a light gray color so that 

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.720
 resembles the newspaper a little more 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:29.560
 [Music] 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:31.630
 the newspaper we will believe that you use 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.470
 the columns that have enough text 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.890
 like this one 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.010
 [Music] 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.410
 but 

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.950
 and then we will cut small squares of 

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:46.330
 text the size of our nails 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:47.920
 [Music] 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.050
 besides the squares I wanted 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.030
 cut out some small letters to 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.320
 place them on a specific nail 

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.320
 giving a different touch 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.250
 and now in a little cup or any 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.500
 based on those little ones can be 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:12.420
 these potatoes we are going to place a little 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 of this alcohol there are two ways to 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.819
 do this process and the first one that is 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.819
 this 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.730
 with the tweezers we are going to take one of the 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:26.200
 small text boxes and we 're going to 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:30.220
 immerse in alcohol and then what 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:32.530
 let's put on our nail once 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.870
 be there let's try not to move it and 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:38.110
 we are going to press 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.630
 that is and approximately 15 to 20 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:40.510
 seconds 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.849
 [Music] 

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.790
 and very carefully we will remove the 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:46.250
 newspaper of the nail 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.530
 [Music] 

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:50.600
 and this is very easy the second option 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:52.970
 what we have to do this is the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:57.320
 next instead of submerging the box 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:58.550
 of text we are going to submerge the nail that 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.860
 we are a bit the excess e 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.540
 immediately we will place another 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:05.460
 small square on this nail 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.860
 Y 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:09.230
 we press very well without trying to move 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:14.310
 the little picture 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:17.470
 [Music] 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.550
 and delicately after 15 to 20 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.150
 we removed you seconds 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:23.819
 [Music] 

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.930
 she is super easy now they can do it 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:26.930
 in the rest of the doubts 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:45.819
 [Music] 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.560
 the process for carving the letter is 

00:03:53.209 --> 00:03:59.090
 exactly the same if you want instead of 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.250
 text boxes can cut out 

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:03.240
 only three letters and put the ten 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:06.709
 letters on the nails 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:09.930
 [Music] 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.489
 you can put together a word or just 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.240
 you can name the person that you 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:16.000
 like finally you can do several things 

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:18.070
 [Music] 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.920
 and to finish you have to leave 

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:23.670
 dry very well all that design for 

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:26.720
 then alicante the shine and protect it 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.720
 [Music] 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.030
 if you like this that now is to give 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.130

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:36.730
 down that says subscribe see you in 

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:36.730
