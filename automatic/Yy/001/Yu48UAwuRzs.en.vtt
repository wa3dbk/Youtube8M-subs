00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.209 

the<00:00:06.100> scale<00:00:06.490> is<00:00:06.790> the<00:00:07.359> system<00:00:07.899> the<00:00:08.530> skill<00:00:08.889> has

00:00:09.209 --> 00:00:09.219 
the scale is the system the skill has

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:11.670 
the scale is the system the skill has
its<00:00:09.400> own<00:00:09.580> color<00:00:09.940> and<00:00:10.209> what<00:00:10.959> makes<00:00:11.200> the<00:00:11.379> color

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:11.680 
its own color and what makes the color

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.320 
its own color and what makes the color
of<00:00:12.040> the<00:00:12.160> scales<00:00:12.490> not<00:00:12.730> the<00:00:12.940> note<00:00:13.150> you're

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:13.330 
of the scales not the note you're

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.990 
of the scales not the note you're
starting<00:00:13.690> from<00:00:13.930> but<00:00:14.289> the<00:00:15.190> notes<00:00:15.430> you<00:00:15.580> playing

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:16.000 
starting from but the notes you playing

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.689 
starting from but the notes you playing
over<00:00:16.900> a<00:00:16.930> particularly<00:00:17.740> backing<00:00:18.279> track<00:00:18.520> and

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
over a particularly backing track and

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.910 
over a particularly backing track and
it's<00:00:19.150> that<00:00:19.390> attraction<00:00:20.170> between<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.680> notes

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:20.920 
it's that attraction between the notes

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.350 
it's that attraction between the notes
of<00:00:21.250> your<00:00:21.310> lead<00:00:21.910> and<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.380> foundation<00:00:24.240> heard<00:00:25.240> in

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:25.360 
of your lead and the foundation heard in

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.120 
of your lead and the foundation heard in
the<00:00:25.450> backing<00:00:25.780> track<00:00:25.960> that<00:00:26.320> creates<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.890> color

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:27.130 
the backing track that creates the color

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.390 
the backing track that creates the color
in<00:00:27.340> this<00:00:27.490> exemple<00:00:28.090> if<00:00:28.300> I<00:00:28.600> played<00:00:28.960> my<00:00:29.289> a<00:00:29.740> Locrian

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:30.400 
in this exemple if I played my a Locrian

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.510 
in this exemple if I played my a Locrian
backing<00:00:30.850> track<00:00:31.119> and<00:00:31.449> I<00:00:31.990> started<00:00:32.500> playing<00:00:33.010> from

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:33.520 
backing track and I started playing from

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.479 
backing track and I started playing from
the<00:00:33.789> second<00:00:34.239> note<00:00:34.539> of<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.140> scale<00:00:35.289> the<00:00:36.100> second

00:00:36.479 --> 00:00:36.489 
the second note of the scale the second

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:38.639 
the second note of the scale the second
position<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.749> would<00:00:37.929> still<00:00:38.230> sound<00:00:38.469> like

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:38.649 
position it would still sound like

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:41.369 
position it would still sound like
Locrian<00:00:39.370> because<00:00:39.789> whether<00:00:40.629> I<00:00:40.749> start<00:00:41.140> with<00:00:41.289> the

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
Locrian because whether I start with the

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:43.649 
Locrian because whether I start with the
first<00:00:41.649> note<00:00:41.829> of<00:00:41.890> the<00:00:42.100> Locrian<00:00:42.429> the<00:00:42.940> second<00:00:43.420> the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:43.659 
first note of the Locrian the second the

00:00:43.659 --> 00:00:45.989 
first note of the Locrian the second the
third<00:00:43.690> or<00:00:44.170> whichever<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.979> these<00:00:45.159> notes<00:00:45.460> I'm

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:45.999 
third or whichever of these notes I'm

00:00:45.999 --> 00:00:47.520 
third or whichever of these notes I'm
still<00:00:46.239> going<00:00:46.390> to<00:00:46.420> be<00:00:46.479> in<00:00:46.600> Locrian<00:00:47.170> there's

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:47.530 
still going to be in Locrian there's

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:49.020 
still going to be in Locrian there's
nothing<00:00:47.859> I<00:00:47.949> can<00:00:48.129> do<00:00:48.249> about<00:00:48.489> it<00:00:48.550> because<00:00:48.909> the

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030 
nothing I can do about it because the

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:51.149 
nothing I can do about it because the
backing<00:00:49.420> track<00:00:49.690> is<00:00:50.170> attracting<00:00:50.889> all<00:00:51.039> the

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:51.159 
backing track is attracting all the

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:53.399 
backing track is attracting all the
notes<00:00:51.339> I'm<00:00:51.519> playing<00:00:51.550> towards<00:00:52.300> it<00:00:52.510> and<00:00:52.690> that's

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:53.409 
notes I'm playing towards it and that's

00:00:53.409 --> 00:00:55.229 
notes I'm playing towards it and that's
what<00:00:53.589> creates<00:00:53.949> the<00:00:54.069> color<00:00:54.399> of<00:00:54.699> the<00:00:54.879> Locrian

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
what creates the color of the Locrian

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.149 
what creates the color of the Locrian
mode<00:00:55.420> let<00:00:55.929> me<00:00:55.989> demonstrate<00:00:56.199> this<00:00:56.530> on<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:57.159 
mode let me demonstrate this on the

00:00:57.159 --> 00:00:59.160 
mode let me demonstrate this on the
Locrian<00:00:57.519> backing<00:00:57.999> track<00:00:58.239> we're<00:00:58.809> in<00:00:58.899> eighth

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
Locrian backing track we're in eighth

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:01.259 
Locrian backing track we're in eighth
Locrian<00:01:00.069> I'm<00:01:00.460> gonna<00:01:00.670> play<00:01:00.879> the<00:01:00.999> first

00:01:01.259 --> 00:01:01.269 
Locrian I'm gonna play the first

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:04.049 
Locrian I'm gonna play the first
position<00:01:01.839> of<00:01:01.960> a<00:01:02.079> Locrian<00:01:02.710> and<00:01:02.949> then<00:01:03.639> I'm<00:01:03.879> gonna

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
position of a Locrian and then I'm gonna

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:05.910 
position of a Locrian and then I'm gonna
play<00:01:04.299> the<00:01:04.360> second<00:01:04.809> position<00:01:05.170> of<00:01:05.229> a<00:01:05.379> Locrian

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
play the second position of a Locrian

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.800 
play the second position of a Locrian
they're<00:01:06.760> very<00:01:07.030> close<00:01:07.330> to<00:01:07.540> each<00:01:07.630> other

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
they're very close to each other

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:10.020 
they're very close to each other
basically<00:01:08.590> I'm<00:01:09.100> simply<00:01:09.490> starting<00:01:09.939> the

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
basically I'm simply starting the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:12.060 
basically I'm simply starting the
Locrian<00:01:10.390> mode<00:01:10.570> from<00:01:10.990> its<00:01:11.170> second<00:01:11.590> note<00:01:11.799> and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
Locrian mode from its second note and

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.160 
Locrian mode from its second note and
they're<00:01:12.549> gonna<00:01:12.640> sound<00:01:12.880> exactly<00:01:13.240> the<00:01:13.539> same<00:01:13.630> I'm

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
they're gonna sound exactly the same I'm

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:16.709 
they're gonna sound exactly the same I'm
just<00:01:14.439> gonna<00:01:14.590> play<00:01:14.829> in<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.219> different<00:01:15.759> area<00:01:16.390> of

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:16.719 
just gonna play in a different area of

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:33.990 
just gonna play in a different area of
the<00:01:16.930> fretboard<00:01:17.170> let's<00:01:18.039> check<00:01:18.219> it<00:01:18.340> out

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:34.000 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.390 

those<00:01:34.690> two<00:01:34.840> positions<00:01:35.050> sound<00:01:35.650> exactly<00:01:36.100> the

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
those two positions sound exactly the

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.490 
those two positions sound exactly the
same<00:01:36.700> because<00:01:36.910> I'm<00:01:37.060> simply<00:01:37.600> playing<00:01:37.900> those

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
same because I'm simply playing those

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.890 
same because I'm simply playing those
seven<00:01:38.890> notes<00:01:39.130> over<00:01:39.820> the<00:01:39.940> same<00:01:40.150> backing<00:01:40.600> track

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
seven notes over the same backing track

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.140 
seven notes over the same backing track
I'm<00:01:41.170> just<00:01:41.740> not<00:01:41.920> starting<00:01:42.370> from<00:01:42.520> the<00:01:42.610> same<00:01:42.700> note

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.150 
I'm just not starting from the same note

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:46.080 
I'm just not starting from the same note
the<00:01:43.900> color<00:01:44.170> is<00:01:44.440> the<00:01:44.770> same<00:01:45.040> and<00:01:45.280> that<00:01:45.790> would<00:01:45.970> be

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
the color is the same and that would be

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.780 
the color is the same and that would be
true<00:01:46.390> for<00:01:46.420> any<00:01:46.690> of<00:01:47.290> the<00:01:47.740> seven<00:01:48.040> positions

true for any of the seven positions

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:57.600 
true for any of the seven positions
