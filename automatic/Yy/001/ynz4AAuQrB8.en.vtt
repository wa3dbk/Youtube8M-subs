00:00:00.779 --> 00:00:06.069
 Since the 24th of June 2010 it is available in Germany the new iPhone 

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:09.429
 4 from Apple and many of you may be in the next 

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:12.799
 Hours wondered that various blogs and many 

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:14.999
 Report news portals about it 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:17.769
 that there should be problems with the integrated antenna 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:24.630
 how does he leave the antenna in the new iPhone 4 by Inters steel frame 

00:00:24.629 --> 00:00:27.889
 Intimacy that leads around the cell phone 

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.750
 and while it looks nice, it obviously does 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.120
 that there are problems with the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.950
 At first there is quality if the phone is really considered unfavorable 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.500
 I can demonstrate this to you relatively clearly 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.590
 if you just look around I'm in the UMTS network 

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.580
 logged in the telecom 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.750
 I have full reception 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.510
 5 out of 5 points lifted in Dr ads 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:00:58.070
 namely the phone 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.530
 in my left hand and neck is actually relatively normal 

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.489
 Although many areas are covered, there are definitely too 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.909
 quickly recognize 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:09.660
 top left the display 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:12.299
 rushes really fast 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.450
 in the basement 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.490
 who in 5 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.420
 we had four 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:21.500
 we have no and every availability more the phone switches to the App Store 

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:22.950
 come 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:27.280
 the whole phenomena are and also just as visible when i put my phone in 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.700
 the right hand take then rushes those around 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.410
 Signal strength is not completely in the cellar but at least around 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.380
 that from five to two buyten so while still and it gets over 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.240
 everything 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.939
 but basically it is like that 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.149
 indeed 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.279
 the problems are there and we can see if I have the phone out of my hand 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:48.700
 lay 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:51.990
 a book that has become fast again basically network is the telecom 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:53.440
 can 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.630
 I think that shows relatively clearly with the antenna is still 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.190
 not all as beautiful as Apple would like to have it 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:02.500
 but 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 there will certainly be worked on and we have something 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:06.320
 Apple is so easy
