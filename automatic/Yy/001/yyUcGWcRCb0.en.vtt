00:00:00.649 --> 00:00:04.270
 Hello and welcome to a new video in the next to her here 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.280
 I am from Mietten Guttenberg and today it is about one of the first games 

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.280
 have negotiated a lot of fun 

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:17.679
 the people loved 

00:00:17.679 --> 00:00:20.679
 ca 

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:23.880
 it's about the difficulties 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.740
 this is the first game for Ahmad Hand of Nike Football League India 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.140
 With 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.390
 yes and then it's about it 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.950
 Meyer I would already tell you to read through articles from a platform to them 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.650
 the next swing like the whole thing works which I immediately 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.150
 first 

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:44.360
 endangered 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.180
 Honor to whom honor is due 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.510
 enough 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.340
 Suhl down game with asthma 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.489
 As you can see, there are currently only six 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:56.079
 in the first episode 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:58.470
 and all others became these 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:01.470
 are then purchased through the Ovi Store 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.340
 You can start with the first song 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:12.120
 because you can see the concept nice that a kind of tutorial are fixed 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:12.810
 my hand 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.270
 Can you do the third one? 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.290
 Connection made and then down here right 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.330
 swing and then he jumps 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.000
 you have to be in the right time 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
 let go 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.340
 I have that and now 

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.370
 put at both 

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.370
 the Urania or Bentley - or 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.450
 picked up Baumwall House arrived 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 and so I would like to play 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:58.920
 Of course it can go wrong 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.920
 14 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.170
 or you can come somewhere against Euro and die while doing so 

00:02:08.599 --> 00:02:11.859
 Of course that is not so nice 

00:02:11.859 --> 00:02:14.969
 but you can fall down too 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:15.959
 so 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.569
 I'll show you just one more of them 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:22.749
 more difficult in Melbourne has rhythms heaven and home comes back in 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:26.909
 On this screen you can also see the beautiful ones in the Kosovo Botton that you can see in 

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:30.769
 This game can be improvised and has the minimum wage five 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.719
 string 

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:36.189
 As you can see that it is difficult here, for example, you must not 

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:39.509
 Come on show what happens then I show you once 

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:42.509
 one breaks immediately 

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:45.169
 So you have to 

00:02:45.169 --> 00:02:47.249
 the before 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.839
 natural 

00:02:49.839 --> 00:02:51.249
 and how 

00:02:51.249 --> 00:02:54.689
 Leave cards costs 

00:02:54.689 --> 00:02:57.769
 Do not sucks which are wrapped in the back 

00:03:00.369 --> 00:03:03.589
 count Johann Müller 

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:05.829
 Stroetzel will of course be funny 

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:08.829
 if you try to swing it somehow 

00:03:09.789 --> 00:03:12.799
 not even train station » 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.799
 he did and did 

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:19.539
 underneath he's nervous 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.479
 so and now is here 

00:03:21.479 --> 00:03:24.659
 Grassmann had to buy the next Derby 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:27.599
 that makes nothing wrong 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:30.849
 who's nice when you go straight to the Ovi Store 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:33.849
 is stoked 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:38.119
 here's the page 

00:03:38.119 --> 00:03:41.529
 then pressed even in Ovi Store leads 

00:03:41.529 --> 00:03:44.529
 Let's see what you are doing 

00:03:46.149 --> 00:03:49.369
 Unfortunately Articus not for the review Wittlich 

00:03:49.369 --> 00:03:52.369
 min I have to promote 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:54.950
 the wars 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:58.250
 Dominik FOTA rejects he can be attributed to nonsense 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.629
 with luck the company fired 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:03.499
 Dogan you can also click on the question mark 

00:04:03.499 --> 00:04:05.249
 then you come 

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.249
 on the side of Mick Hucknall 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:13.849
 The consolation nobody brings Citigroup brings 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:15.259
 or 

00:04:15.259 --> 00:04:16.989
 around 

00:04:16.989 --> 00:04:21.329
 otherwise I would say the game is very nice in the beginning it goes clearly with 5 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:24.360
 Levin a bit poor, but it is also just from the hour zero 

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.439
 came out 

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.830
 So we can be safe there 

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:33.229
 sda what happens I still want to chill the music the whole presentation of these 

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:37.219
 drawn plants 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.949
 to the Thuringian it's cool for me 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:43.740
 and l the army was fun 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.349
 What the door bleats kids for watching and until the next video
