00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
then jump from block to block to create

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.349 
then jump from block to block to create
a<00:00:18.600> pathway<00:00:18.930> to<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.500> other<00:00:19.740> side<00:00:20.119> after<00:00:21.119> doing

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
instances like this that you find on

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.620 
instances like this that you find on
this<00:01:37.920> map<00:01:38.220> one<00:01:38.790> thing<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.030> note<00:01:39.240> though<00:01:39.420> when

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
this map one thing to note though when

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.840 
this map one thing to note though when
you<00:01:39.780> are<00:01:40.049> on<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:40.619> leader<00:01:40.950> side<00:01:41.340> of<00:01:41.610> things

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
you are on the leader side of things

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.090 
you are on the leader side of things
it's<00:01:42.240> really<00:01:42.750> important<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.380> use<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.829> lot<00:01:44.070> of

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
it's really important to use a lot of

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.010 
it's really important to use a lot of
communication<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:45.390> don't<00:01:45.540> want<00:01:45.689> your<00:01:45.750> whole

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
communication you don't want your whole

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.230 
communication you don't want your whole
team<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.619> run<00:01:46.920> and<00:01:47.159> just<00:01:47.399> jump<00:01:47.670> on<00:01:47.820> every

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
team to run and just jump on every

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.030 
team to run and just jump on every
single<00:01:48.420> block<00:01:48.869> they<00:01:49.079> see<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.470> idea<00:01:49.590> is<00:01:50.009> to

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
single block they see the idea is to

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.760 
single block they see the idea is to
jump<00:01:50.700> on<00:01:50.939> as<00:01:51.180> little<00:01:51.570> blocks<00:01:51.840> as<00:01:52.110> possible<00:01:52.649> and

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
jump on as little blocks as possible and

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.770 
jump on as little blocks as possible and
set<00:01:53.220> up<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:53.369> complex<00:01:53.880> path<00:01:54.210> that<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.630> other

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
set up a complex path that the other

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.940 
set up a complex path that the other
team<00:01:54.990> will<00:01:55.170> be<00:01:55.290> able<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.470> follow<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.890> if

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
team will be able to follow and if

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.590 
team will be able to follow and if
you're<00:01:56.040> not<00:01:56.100> using<00:01:56.280> communication<00:01:56.600> players

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
you're not using communication players

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.630 
you're not using communication players
are<00:01:57.719> just<00:01:57.869> gonna<00:01:57.960> jump<00:01:58.259> from<00:01:58.649> every<00:01:59.189> block<00:01:59.460> to

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
are just gonna jump from every block to

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.100 
are just gonna jump from every block to
every<00:01:59.909> block<00:02:00.149> and<00:02:00.420> it's<00:02:00.540> going<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> be<00:02:00.780> a<00:02:00.810> super

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
every block and it's going to be a super

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.499 
every block and it's going to be a super
easy<00:02:01.380> path<00:02:01.710> for<00:02:02.009> them<00:02:02.100> to<00:02:02.250> follow<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:03.030> idea<00:02:03.299> is

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
easy path for them to follow the idea is

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.139 
easy path for them to follow the idea is
that<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.840> follow<00:02:04.409> basically<00:02:05.159> one<00:02:05.430> person<00:02:05.939> on

00:02:06.139 --> 00:02:06.149 
that you follow basically one person on

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.850 
that you follow basically one person on
your<00:02:06.329> team<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.930> set<00:02:07.110> up<00:02:07.200> and<00:02:07.350> half<00:02:07.500> way<00:02:07.649> that

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860 
your team to set up and half way that

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:09.469 
your team to set up and half way that
way<00:02:07.979> you're<00:02:08.160> not<00:02:08.190> jumping<00:02:08.610> on<00:02:08.879> a<00:02:08.910> ton<00:02:09.360> of

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
way you're not jumping on a ton of

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.370 
way you're not jumping on a ton of
different<00:02:09.629> blocks<00:02:10.080> you

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
different blocks you

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:12.200 
different blocks you
really<00:02:10.530> want<00:02:10.710> to<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> know<00:02:11.310> operate<00:02:11.970> as<00:02:12.180> a

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:12.210 
really want to you know operate as a

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:13.940 
really want to you know operate as a
team<00:02:12.330> and<00:02:12.810> think<00:02:13.080> about<00:02:13.320> how<00:02:13.350> you<00:02:13.590> want<00:02:13.890> your

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
team and think about how you want your

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.010 
team and think about how you want your
pattern<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.520> set<00:02:14.700> up<00:02:14.850> then<00:02:15.330> when<00:02:15.450> it<00:02:15.540> comes<00:02:15.570> to

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.020 
pattern to set up then when it comes to

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.650 
pattern to set up then when it comes to
trying<00:02:16.470> to<00:02:16.740> match<00:02:17.070> the<00:02:17.430> other<00:02:17.670> teams<00:02:18.090> pattern

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
trying to match the other teams pattern

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.410 
trying to match the other teams pattern
my<00:02:19.110> best<00:02:19.320> piece<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.560> advice<00:02:19.740> is<00:02:20.190> to<00:02:20.700> just<00:02:20.730> try

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
my best piece of advice is to just try

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.240 
my best piece of advice is to just try
to<00:02:21.480> memorize<00:02:21.750> it<00:02:22.110> as<00:02:22.230> best<00:02:22.410> as<00:02:22.620> possible<00:02:22.650> and

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
to memorize it as best as possible and

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.190 
to memorize it as best as possible and
then<00:02:23.640> move<00:02:23.850> as<00:02:24.120> a<00:02:24.150> unit<00:02:24.270> that<00:02:24.600> way<00:02:24.870> you<00:02:24.930> can

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
then move as a unit that way you can

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.650 
then move as a unit that way you can
send<00:02:25.440> out<00:02:25.560> testers<00:02:26.100> almost<00:02:26.520> where<00:02:26.760> one<00:02:27.270> person

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:27.660 
send out testers almost where one person

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:29.150 
send out testers almost where one person
will<00:02:27.780> jump<00:02:28.020> to<00:02:28.050> one<00:02:28.290> block<00:02:28.560> and<00:02:28.740> if<00:02:28.860> they<00:02:28.950> die

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
will jump to one block and if they die

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.100 
will jump to one block and if they die
you<00:02:29.220> know<00:02:29.580> not<00:02:29.850> to<00:02:30.030> go<00:02:30.150> on<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.330> block<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
you know not to go on that block and you

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.860 
you know not to go on that block and you
can<00:02:31.410> kind<00:02:31.560> of<00:02:31.740> work<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.190> that<00:02:32.430> way<00:02:32.640> you<00:02:33.570> end<00:02:33.750> up

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
can kind of work it that way you end up

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.750 
can kind of work it that way you end up
with<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.020> lot<00:02:34.290> of<00:02:34.320> moments<00:02:34.680> where<00:02:35.160> it's<00:02:35.400> just

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:35.760 
with a lot of moments where it's just

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760 
with a lot of moments where it's just
really<00:02:36.150> really<00:02:36.360> stressful<00:02:37.050> because<00:02:37.440> you

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:37.770 
really really stressful because you

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.710 
really really stressful because you
don't<00:02:38.040> know<00:02:38.220> which<00:02:38.400> block<00:02:38.730> is<00:02:39.000> going<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.480> kill

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
don't know which block is going to kill

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.780 
don't know which block is going to kill
you<00:02:39.900> or<00:02:40.050> not<00:02:40.170> and<00:02:40.470> if<00:02:40.590> you<00:02:40.770> don't<00:02:41.070> memorize<00:02:41.310> it

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:41.790 
you or not and if you don't memorize it

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:44.000 
you or not and if you don't memorize it
properly<00:02:42.210> a<00:02:42.480> chances<00:02:43.260> are<00:02:43.410> you're<00:02:43.620> going<00:02:43.830> to

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
properly a chances are you're going to

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.190 
properly a chances are you're going to
die<00:02:44.220> all<00:02:44.670> in<00:02:44.970> all<00:02:45.120> this<00:02:45.270> minigame<00:02:45.600> is<00:02:45.960> just

fantastic chewy nut cluster really

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.790 
fantastic chewy nut cluster really
outdid<00:02:48.690> himself<00:02:48.900> with<00:02:49.200> this<00:02:49.380> one<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:49.800 
outdid himself with this one I

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:53.090 
outdid himself with this one I
absolutely<00:02:50.790> love<00:02:51.540> how<00:02:51.870> simplistic<00:02:52.500> it<00:02:52.800> is<00:02:52.920> and

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
absolutely love how simplistic it is and

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.410 
absolutely love how simplistic it is and
I<00:02:53.130> love<00:02:53.340> the<00:02:53.430> fact<00:02:53.460> that<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.910> scoring<00:02:54.270> system

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.420 
I love the fact that the scoring system

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.630 
I love the fact that the scoring system
actually<00:02:54.840> works<00:02:55.080> and<00:02:55.470> makes<00:02:55.560> sense<00:02:55.980> if<00:02:56.220> you

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
actually works and makes sense if you

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:57.830 
actually works and makes sense if you
want<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:56.880> download<00:02:56.940> this<00:02:57.210> one<00:02:57.450> I<00:02:57.600> recommend

want to download this one I recommend
playing<00:02:58.320> it<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.680> about<00:02:59.190> eight<00:02:59.490> people

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
playing it with about eight people

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:03.380 
playing it with about eight people
maximum<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:00.960> maybe<00:03:01.470> six<00:03:01.980> people<00:03:02.370> minimum<00:03:02.760> any

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
more than eight you're going to be

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:05.720 
more than eight you're going to be
jumping<00:03:04.830> on<00:03:04.920> a<00:03:04.950> lot<00:03:05.160> of<00:03:05.190> different<00:03:05.280> blocks
