build<00:01:31.619> these<00:01:31.740> donations<00:01:32.009> stands<00:01:32.430> in<00:01:32.610> areas

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
build these donations stands in areas

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.280 
build these donations stands in areas
where<00:01:33.060> your<00:01:33.240> guests<00:01:33.540> are<00:01:33.570> getting<00:01:33.720> enough<00:01:34.020> or

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
where your guests are getting enough or

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.069 
where your guests are getting enough or
so<00:01:34.950> you'll<00:01:35.130> see<00:01:35.340> these<00:01:35.579> bars<00:01:35.880> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.509> on<00:01:37.020> the

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
so you'll see these bars on the on the

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.590 
so you'll see these bars on the on the
pathway<00:01:37.710> here<00:01:38.130> those<00:01:38.790> are<00:01:38.909> the<00:01:38.939> all<00:01:39.150> bars<00:01:39.420> that

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
pathway here those are the all bars that

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.210 
pathway here those are the all bars that
are<00:01:39.630> being<00:01:39.780> created<00:01:39.960> by<00:01:40.259> your<00:01:40.560> relics<00:01:40.890> and<00:01:41.070> a

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
are being created by your relics and a

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.399 
are being created by your relics and a
higher<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> bar<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:42.420> more<00:01:42.689> or<00:01:42.990> that<00:01:43.290> the

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
higher the bar the more or that the

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.539 
higher the bar the more or that the
guest<00:01:43.619> is<00:01:43.740> going<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.009> get<00:01:44.100> when<00:01:44.280> they<00:01:44.369> walk

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
guest is going to get when they walk

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
guest is going to get when they walk
through<00:01:44.579> so<00:01:45.570> he's<00:01:46.079> just<00:01:46.110> got<00:01:46.560> that<00:01:46.590> relic<00:01:46.979> from

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
through so he's just got that relic from

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.460 
through so he's just got that relic from
the<00:01:47.220> expedition<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:48.030> it<00:01:48.390> was<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.600> nice<00:01:49.200> green

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
the expedition and it was a nice green

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.710 
the expedition and it was a nice green
box<00:01:49.680> at<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.670> moment<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.030> green<00:01:51.240> signifies

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
box at the moment the green signifies

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.210 
box at the moment the green signifies
the<00:01:51.750> color<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> box<00:01:52.770> signifies<00:01:53.189> the

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
the color of the box signifies the

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.530 
the color of the box signifies the
rarity<00:01:53.729> so<00:01:53.970> that's<00:01:54.270> rare<00:01:54.509> isn't<00:01:54.689> it

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
rarity so that's rare isn't it

00:01:55.540 --> 00:02:00.540 
rarity so that's rare isn't it
a<00:01:55.570> common<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:56.710> uncommon<00:01:56.980> that's<00:01:57.730> it<00:01:59.250> so<00:02:00.250> yeah

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
a common and uncommon that's it so yeah

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.520 
a common and uncommon that's it so yeah
now<00:02:00.760> Gustaf's<00:02:01.420> building<00:02:01.780> some<00:02:01.930> fakes<00:02:02.200> to<00:02:02.380> try

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:02.530 
now Gustaf's building some fakes to try

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.650 
now Gustaf's building some fakes to try
and<00:02:02.650> boost<00:02:02.800> up<00:02:03.070> the<00:02:03.120> surrounding<00:02:04.120> all<00:02:04.270> levels

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:04.660 
and boost up the surrounding all levels

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.260 
and boost up the surrounding all levels
and<00:02:04.810> there's<00:02:05.260> a<00:02:05.610> if<00:02:06.610> you<00:02:06.730> look<00:02:06.880> at<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.000> guests

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
and there's a if you look at the guests

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.340 
and there's a if you look at the guests
so<00:02:07.390> you<00:02:07.450> can<00:02:07.600> see<00:02:07.780> that<00:02:07.810> they've<00:02:08.080> got<00:02:08.200> this

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
so you can see that they've got this

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.830 
so you can see that they've got this
green<00:02:08.759> circle<00:02:09.759> that's<00:02:09.850> forming<00:02:10.330> that's<00:02:10.660> there

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
green circle that's forming that's there

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.480 
green circle that's forming that's there
or<00:02:11.020> bar<00:02:11.290> and<00:02:11.440> when<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.740> reaches<00:02:12.100> full<00:02:12.280> it'll

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:12.490 
or bar and when that reaches full it'll

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:14.690 
or bar and when that reaches full it'll
go<00:02:12.610> gold<00:02:12.910> and<00:02:13.150> then<00:02:13.540> they're<00:02:13.660> ready<00:02:13.780> to<00:02:13.990> donate

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700 
go gold and then they're ready to donate

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.470 
go gold and then they're ready to donate
so<00:02:15.700> you're<00:02:15.820> probably<00:02:16.030> going<00:02:16.210> to<00:02:16.270> need<00:02:16.330> to

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480 
so you're probably going to need to

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.540 
so you're probably going to need to
build<00:02:16.660> a<00:02:16.720> couple<00:02:16.990> more<00:02:17.080> fakes<00:02:17.440> I've<00:02:18.130> got<00:02:18.370> I've

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:18.550 
build a couple more fakes I've got I've

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.890 
build a couple more fakes I've got I've
got<00:02:18.580> a<00:02:18.700> good<00:02:18.850> bit<00:02:19.000> get<00:02:19.120> here<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.540> if<00:02:19.690> you<00:02:19.720> get

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
got a good bit get here and if you get

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.230 
got a good bit get here and if you get
duplicates<00:02:20.320> you<00:02:20.500> get<00:02:20.650> penalized<00:02:21.010> so<00:02:21.850> it's

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:22.240 
duplicates you get penalized so it's

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:30.320 
duplicates you get penalized so it's
good<00:02:22.810> that<00:02:23.140> I<00:02:23.680> try<00:02:24.310> and<00:02:24.670> oh<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.920> that's<00:02:27.160> the

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.890 

various<00:02:31.330> ages<00:02:31.750> it's<00:02:32.350> the<00:02:32.530> way<00:02:32.950> it<00:02:33.010> is<00:02:33.540> so<00:02:34.540> he's

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
various ages it's the way it is so he's

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.770 
various ages it's the way it is so he's
also<00:02:35.110> just<00:02:35.730> more<00:02:36.730> bugs<00:02:36.910> just<00:02:37.300> going<00:02:37.570> through

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
also just more bugs just going through

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.040 
also just more bugs just going through
the<00:02:38.280> border<00:02:39.280> yeah<00:02:39.550> we<00:02:39.760> got<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.420> Sioux<00:02:40.630> a<00:02:40.660> lot

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
the border yeah we got the Sioux a lot

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.900 
the border yeah we got the Sioux a lot
of<00:02:41.140> stuff<00:02:41.320> to<00:02:41.350> fix<00:02:41.650> but<00:02:42.430> we<00:02:42.520> just<00:02:42.610> wanted<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
of stuff to fix but we just wanted to

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.460 
of stuff to fix but we just wanted to
show<00:02:43.030> the<00:02:43.180> basic<00:02:43.450> game<00:02:43.570> Atlanta<00:02:43.840> mechanics

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
show the basic game Atlanta mechanics

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.949 
show the basic game Atlanta mechanics
and<00:02:44.620> how<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.800> game<00:02:45.070> is<00:02:45.700> set<00:02:45.970> up<00:02:46.120> so<00:02:46.150> it's<00:02:46.570> it

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:46.959 
and how the game is set up so it's it

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:48.900 
and how the game is set up so it's it
feels<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.350> a<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.800> a<00:02:47.830> regular<00:02:48.100> tycoon<00:02:48.580> where

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
feels like a like a regular tycoon where

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.970 
feels like a like a regular tycoon where
you<00:02:49.090> just<00:02:49.270> you've<00:02:50.020> got<00:02:50.140> your<00:02:50.290> lab<00:02:50.470> which<00:02:50.950> is

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
you just you've got your lab which is

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.920 
you just you've got your lab which is
like<00:02:51.220> roller<00:02:51.430> coaster<00:02:51.700> tycoon<00:02:51.790> and<00:02:52.570> stuff

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
like roller coaster tycoon and stuff

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:55.020 
like roller coaster tycoon and stuff
like<00:02:53.050> that<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.320> set<00:02:53.530> up<00:02:53.620> your<00:02:53.650> budget<00:02:54.070> and

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:55.030 
like that you set up your budget and

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:56.490 
like that you set up your budget and
then<00:02:55.180> I'll<00:02:55.330> start<00:02:55.510> researching<00:02:55.959> those<00:02:56.170> doors

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
then I'll start researching those doors

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.070 
then I'll start researching those doors
most<00:02:57.459> of<00:02:57.700> the<00:02:57.850> of<00:02:58.150> the<00:02:58.300> main<00:02:58.450> systems<00:02:58.870> are<00:02:58.989> in

00:02:59.070 --> 00:02:59.080 
most of the of the main systems are in

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.750 
most of the of the main systems are in
place<00:02:59.110> during<00:02:59.470> a<00:02:59.530> bison<00:02:59.860> land<00:03:00.100> that's<00:03:00.550> another

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:00.760 
place during a bison land that's another

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.729 
place during a bison land that's another
thing<00:03:01.000> yeah<00:03:01.420> a<00:03:01.690> cool<00:03:02.200> thing<00:03:02.320> about<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.560> land

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
thing yeah a cool thing about the land

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.800 
thing yeah a cool thing about the land
is<00:03:02.950> it's<00:03:03.100> built<00:03:03.310> on<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.700> everything<00:03:04.450> set<00:03:04.690> on

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
is it's built on the everything set on

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.690 
is it's built on the everything set on
the<00:03:04.900> land<00:03:05.140> price<00:03:05.470> of<00:03:05.680> that<00:03:05.800> scenario<00:03:06.130> so<00:03:06.580> the

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
the land price of that scenario so the

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:09.030 
the land price of that scenario so the
higher<00:03:06.910> the<00:03:07.150> land<00:03:07.330> price<00:03:07.660> we<00:03:08.590> could<00:03:08.739> use<00:03:08.920> an

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
higher the land price we could use an

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.170 
higher the land price we could use an
alter<00:03:09.310> that<00:03:09.400> and<00:03:09.580> that<00:03:09.670> can<00:03:09.820> go<00:03:09.940> down

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
alter that and that can go down

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.000 
alter that and that can go down
depending<00:03:10.750> on<00:03:11.019> certain<00:03:11.320> missions<00:03:11.560> you<00:03:11.830> take

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010

Pujols looking all over the sill widgets
to<00:03:20.890> offer<00:03:21.130> assistance<00:03:21.250> well<00:03:21.760> we've<00:03:21.910> got<00:03:22.060> we've

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:22.239 
to offer assistance well we've got we've

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:23.400 
to offer assistance well we've got we've
got<00:03:22.330> a<00:03:22.360> bug<00:03:22.540> at<00:03:22.660> the<00:03:22.750> moment<00:03:23.019> where<00:03:23.140> the<00:03:23.260> guys

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:23.410 
got a bug at the moment where the guys

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:25.680 
got a bug at the moment where the guys
cannot<00:03:23.739> find<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.640> exit<00:03:24.940> with<00:03:25.180> their<00:03:25.390> with

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
cannot find the exit with their with

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.060 
cannot find the exit with their with
their<00:03:25.840> path<00:03:26.110> finding<00:03:26.470> and<00:03:26.620> that's<00:03:26.739> why<00:03:26.890> they

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070 
their path finding and that's why they

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.699 
their path finding and that's why they
start<00:03:27.340> walking<00:03:27.700> off<00:03:27.820> to<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.290> starting<00:03:29.290> to<00:03:29.590> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
start walking off to the starting to the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.770 
start walking off to the starting to the
origin<00:03:30.070> of<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.549> game<00:03:30.730> so<00:03:31.360> that's<00:03:31.510> why<00:03:31.630> they

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:31.780 
origin of the game so that's why they

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.990 
origin of the game so that's why they
walk<00:03:31.989> through<00:03:32.019> the<00:03:32.430> doors<00:03:33.430> that<00:03:33.730> will<00:03:33.880> be

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:34.000 
walk through the doors that will be

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.240 
walk through the doors that will be
fixed<00:03:34.180> fixed<00:03:34.450> the<00:03:35.290> next<00:03:35.500> alpha<00:03:35.709> test<00:03:35.890> but<00:03:36.040> you

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:36.250 
fixed fixed the next alpha test but you

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:37.949 
fixed fixed the next alpha test but you
know<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:36.459> know<00:03:36.640> it's<00:03:36.940> it<00:03:37.120> we<00:03:37.299> just<00:03:37.750> want<00:03:37.900> to

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:37.959 
know you know it's it we just want to

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:41.940 
know you know it's it we just want to
show<00:03:38.110> that<00:03:38.140> we've<00:03:38.650> no<00:03:38.890> hard<00:03:39.370> every<00:03:40.799> stall<00:03:41.799> and

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
show that we've no hard every stall and

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:43.470 
show that we've no hard every stall and
I<00:03:42.040> think<00:03:42.220> we've<00:03:42.340> kind<00:03:42.910> of<00:03:42.970> nailed<00:03:43.180> it<00:03:43.330> now

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:43.480 
I think we've kind of nailed it now

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:44.970 
I think we've kind of nailed it now
finally<00:03:43.989> we're<00:03:44.140> getting<00:03:44.230> there<00:03:44.560> yeah<00:03:44.739> we<00:03:44.920> were

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:44.980 
finally we're getting there yeah we were

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:47.009 
finally we're getting there yeah we were
starting<00:03:45.549> to<00:03:45.670> get<00:03:45.820> close<00:03:46.060> to<00:03:46.090> what<00:03:46.660> we<00:03:46.690> want<00:03:46.930> to

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
starting to get close to what we want to

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:48.690 
starting to get close to what we want to
game<00:03:47.170> to<00:03:47.320> look<00:03:47.470> like<00:03:47.709> we<00:03:48.370> still<00:03:48.519> haven't

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:48.700 
game to look like we still haven't

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:50.039 
game to look like we still haven't
touched<00:03:49.060> up<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.330> characters<00:03:49.720> yet<00:03:49.840> they<00:03:49.989> still

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
touched up the characters yet they still

00:03:50.049 --> 00:03:52.259 
touched up the characters yet they still
with<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.350> basic<00:03:50.709> first<00:03:51.150> iteration<00:03:52.150> that

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
with the basic first iteration that

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.060 
with the basic first iteration that
we've<00:03:52.420> made<00:03:52.540> before<00:03:52.930> but<00:03:53.590> stuff<00:03:53.799> like<00:03:53.830> the

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
we've made before but stuff like the

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.009 
we've made before but stuff like the
burger<00:03:54.250> stand<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.880> me<00:03:55.000> and<00:03:55.269> the<00:03:55.360> explored<00:03:55.780> and

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
burger stand and me and the explored and

00:03:56.019 --> 00:03:58.050 
burger stand and me and the explored and
a<00:03:56.140> good<00:03:56.530> example<00:03:56.620> of<00:03:57.010> how<00:03:57.100> we<00:03:57.370> want<00:03:57.730> the<00:03:57.850> games

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
a good example of how we want the games

00:03:58.060 --> 00:03:59.370 
a good example of how we want the games
to<00:03:58.239> look<00:03:58.840> eventually

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
to look eventually

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.160 
to look eventually
yeah<00:03:59.830> you<00:04:00.160> know<00:04:00.280> and<00:04:00.490> then<00:04:00.670> it's<00:04:01.210> just<00:04:01.300> to<00:04:01.990> show

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
yeah you know and then it's just to show

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:04.800 
yeah you know and then it's just to show
you<00:04:02.200> why<00:04:02.530> what<00:04:03.010> the<00:04:03.160> game<00:04:03.370> hopefully<00:04:04.240> will<00:04:04.780> be

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
you why what the game hopefully will be

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.590 
you why what the game hopefully will be
like<00:04:05.320> and<00:04:06.000> we<00:04:07.000> cannot<00:04:07.210> show<00:04:07.390> off<00:04:07.510> the

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
like and we cannot show off the

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.430 
like and we cannot show off the
mechanics<00:04:07.930> very<00:04:08.080> much<00:04:08.200> at<00:04:08.320> the<00:04:08.380> moment

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
mechanics very much at the moment

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:09.660 
mechanics very much at the moment
because<00:04:08.650> it'll<00:04:08.980> go<00:04:09.040> out<00:04:09.100> a<00:04:09.160> few<00:04:09.280> bugs<00:04:09.490> to<00:04:09.580> fix

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:09.670 
because it'll go out a few bugs to fix

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.520 
because it'll go out a few bugs to fix
because<00:04:10.120> we've<00:04:10.540> done<00:04:10.690> a<00:04:10.720> big<00:04:10.900> update<00:04:11.050> on<00:04:11.320> on
