today today we'll be working on this
wire<00:00:11.980> harness<00:00:13.949> I'm<00:00:14.949> going<00:00:15.070> to<00:00:15.160> get<00:00:15.250> the

00:00:15.359 --> 00:00:15.369 
wire harness I'm going to get the

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:17.609 
wire harness I'm going to get the
backing<00:00:15.549> swapped<00:00:16.539> out<00:00:16.720> with<00:00:16.930> the<00:00:17.170> piece<00:00:17.500> of

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:17.619 
backing swapped out with the piece of

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:20.760 
backing swapped out with the piece of
plexiglass<00:00:18.160> I<00:00:18.340> picked<00:00:18.580> up<00:00:18.789> and<00:00:19.060> then<00:00:19.779> get<00:00:20.590> the

plexiglass I picked up and then get the
harness<00:00:21.340> back<00:00:21.550> installed<00:00:22.000> and<00:00:22.440> finish<00:00:23.440> up

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:23.619 
harness back installed and finish up

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.880 
harness back installed and finish up
those<00:00:24.240> circuits<00:00:25.240> that<00:00:25.480> I<00:00:26.260> never<00:00:26.470> got<00:00:26.560> done

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
those circuits that I never got done

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.330 
those circuits that I never got done
before<00:00:27.580> I<00:00:27.610> broke<00:00:27.820> the<00:00:27.940> car<00:00:28.150> down<00:00:28.860> so<00:00:29.860> now<00:00:30.010> I<00:00:30.039> got

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
before I broke the car down so now I got

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:31.750 
before I broke the car down so now I got
my

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
my

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.250 
my
the<00:00:32.210> connection<00:00:32.420> on<00:00:32.750> that<00:00:32.780> side<00:00:33.170> of<00:00:33.200> the

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
the connection on that side of the

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.140 
the connection on that side of the
the<00:00:34.559> harness<00:00:34.920> and<00:00:35.070> get<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.280> all<00:00:35.339> closed<00:00:35.670> up<00:00:35.910> so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:37.150 
the harness and get it all closed up so

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.660 
the harness and get it all closed up so
sorry<00:00:37.780> I<00:00:37.870> get<00:00:38.020> started<00:00:38.320> on<00:00:38.440> this<00:00:38.590> I'm<00:00:39.460> going<00:00:39.550> to

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:39.670 
sorry I get started on this I'm going to

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:41.010 
sorry I get started on this I'm going to
pull<00:00:39.820> all<00:00:39.940> this<00:00:40.060> off<00:00:40.270> and<00:00:40.540> then<00:00:40.660> use<00:00:40.840> this

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:41.020 
pull all this off and then use this

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.510 
pull all this off and then use this
backing<00:00:41.710> plate<00:00:42.070> as<00:00:42.220> a<00:00:42.250> template<00:00:44.130> right<00:00:45.130> so<00:00:45.490> I

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:45.520 
backing plate as a template right so I

00:00:45.520 --> 00:01:54.610 
backing plate as a template right so I
want<00:00:45.700> to<00:00:45.760> get<00:00:45.850> a<00:00:45.880> little<00:00:45.940> bit

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:54.620 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.630 

already<00:01:55.420> got<00:01:56.420> an<00:01:56.570> old<00:01:56.690> one<00:01:57.310> so<00:01:58.310> the<00:01:58.460> only<00:01:58.580> thing

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
already got an old one so the only thing

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.030 
already got an old one so the only thing
I'm<00:01:58.850> gonna<00:01:59.030> have<00:01:59.150> to<00:01:59.210> do<00:01:59.330> now<00:01:59.480> is<00:01:59.510> just<00:01:59.890> do<00:02:00.890> my

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:01.040 
I'm gonna have to do now is just do my

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.010 
I'm gonna have to do now is just do my
labeling<00:02:01.550> a<00:02:01.640> hand<00:02:01.880> so<00:02:02.240> it's<00:02:02.630> not<00:02:02.720> a<00:02:02.780> big<00:02:02.990> deal

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
labeling a hand so it's not a big deal

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.590 
labeling a hand so it's not a big deal
but<00:02:03.890> I'm<00:02:04.340> thinking<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.670> might<00:02:04.700> put<00:02:05.000> a<00:02:05.030> cover<00:02:05.300> on

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:05.600 
but I'm thinking I might put a cover on

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.740 
but I'm thinking I might put a cover on
top<00:02:06.290> of<00:02:06.500> this<00:02:06.590> so<00:02:07.240> I'll<00:02:08.240> play<00:02:08.450> with<00:02:08.570> that<00:02:08.690> a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:08.750 
top of this so I'll play with that a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.030 
top of this so I'll play with that a
little<00:02:08.900> bit<00:02:09.080> more<00:02:09.290> and<00:02:09.500> get<00:02:09.650> this<00:02:09.800> installed

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:10.040 
little bit more and get this installed

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.450 
little bit more and get this installed
and<00:02:10.400> get<00:02:10.520> those<00:02:10.640> circuits<00:02:11.090> done<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.570> then<00:02:12.460> go

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
and get those circuits done and then go

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.090 
and get those circuits done and then go
from<00:02:13.580> there<00:02:13.670> all<00:02:14.540> right<00:02:14.780> I<00:02:14.810> got<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.620> wire

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
from there all right I got the wire

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.890 
from there all right I got the wire
harness<00:02:16.340> pulled<00:02:16.760> through<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.150> firewall<00:02:17.660> I

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
harness pulled through the firewall I

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.430 
harness pulled through the firewall I
made<00:02:18.770> these<00:02:18.920> connections<00:02:19.310> down<00:02:19.700> here<00:02:20.260> so<00:02:21.260> now

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
made these connections down here so now

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.500 
made these connections down here so now
i<00:02:21.470> can<00:02:21.530> get<00:02:21.770> the<00:02:21.950> header<00:02:22.670> back<00:02:22.940> on<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.420> the

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
i can get the header back on for the

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.480 
i can get the header back on for the
last<00:02:23.660> time<00:02:23.960> i<00:02:24.260> can<00:02:24.860> get<00:02:25.040> that<00:02:25.160> torque<00:02:25.490> down<00:02:25.700> and

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
last time i can get that torque down and

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:30.810 
last time i can get that torque down and
these<00:02:28.490> are<00:02:28.670> my<00:02:28.700> circuits<00:02:29.210> that<00:02:29.270> I<00:02:29.390> have<00:02:29.570> bad

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
these are my circuits that I have bad

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:34.570 
these are my circuits that I have bad
the<00:02:31.820> IAC<00:02:32.180> and<00:02:32.630> the<00:02:32.690> TP<00:02:33.280> along<00:02:34.280> with<00:02:34.490> the

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:34.580 
the IAC and the TP along with the

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:39.100 
the IAC and the TP along with the
alternator<00:02:35.090> generator<00:02:36.970> circuits<00:02:37.970> and<00:02:38.360> then<00:02:38.660> I

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
alternator generator circuits and then I

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.890 
alternator generator circuits and then I
can<00:02:39.380> close<00:02:39.620> them<00:02:39.770> up<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:41.650> call<00:02:42.650> this<00:02:42.800> one<00:02:43.010> down

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
can close them up and call this one down

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.350 
can close them up and call this one down
the<00:02:44.900> only<00:02:45.080> thing<00:02:45.230> I<00:02:45.320> got<00:02:45.560> to<00:02:46.130> shorten<00:02:46.910> later<00:02:47.090> is

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
the only thing I got to shorten later is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.790 
the only thing I got to shorten later is
my<00:02:47.570> mass<00:02:47.810> airflow<00:02:48.080> sensor<00:02:49.900> when<00:02:50.900> I<00:02:50.930> won't<00:02:51.170> do

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:51.800 
my mass airflow sensor when I won't do

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:54.610 
my mass airflow sensor when I won't do
that<00:02:51.830> till<00:02:52.190> I<00:02:52.280> get<00:02:52.460> the<00:02:53.050> sensor<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:54.260> make<00:02:54.410> my

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620 
that till I get the sensor and make my

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.860 
that till I get the sensor and make my
make<00:02:55.610> my<00:02:55.790> duct<00:02:56.030> work<00:02:56.210> for<00:02:56.480> that<00:02:57.250> so<00:02:58.720> all<00:02:59.720> right

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
make my duct work for that so all right

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.660 
make my duct work for that so all right
I'm<00:03:00.020> gonna<00:03:00.080> get<00:03:00.290> this<00:03:00.410> going<00:03:00.709> here<00:03:00.860> and<00:03:01.100> show

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
I'm gonna get this going here and show

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.530 
I'm gonna get this going here and show
you<00:03:01.760> in<00:03:01.850> a<00:03:01.910> little<00:03:02.060> bit<00:03:02.209> Mary<00:03:02.690> guys<00:03:02.900> I<00:03:03.230> got<00:03:03.620> the
