00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
is the programming are making the

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.750 
is the programming are making the
gameplay<00:02:40.700> and<00:02:40.940> I'm<00:02:41.870> not<00:02:42.230> a<00:02:42.260> programmer<00:02:42.830> and<00:02:43.670> I

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
gameplay and I'm not a programmer and I

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.340 
gameplay and I'm not a programmer and I
started<00:02:44.120> out<00:02:44.270> trying<00:02:44.540> to<00:02:44.660> do<00:02:44.840> the<00:02:44.990> normal

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:01.400 
and I have it set to spawn another robot

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.140 
and I have it set to spawn another robot
so<00:04:02.269> I'm<00:04:02.540> working<00:04:02.750> out<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.110> gameplay<00:04:04.150> just

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150

and then that was the first enemy I made
it<00:04:47.030> took<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.210> while<00:04:47.449> for<00:04:47.479> me<00:04:47.720> to<00:04:47.840> figure<00:04:47.870> that

00:04:48.129 --> 00:04:48.139 
it took a while for me to figure that

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:50.040 
it took a while for me to figure that
out<00:04:48.199> then<00:04:48.500> I<00:04:48.560> want<00:04:48.710> to<00:04:48.770> make<00:04:48.889> a<00:04:48.919> flying<00:04:49.220> enemy

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:54.279 
out then I want to make a flying enemy
so<00:04:51.669> let's<00:04:52.669> turn<00:04:52.940> let's<00:04:53.300> go<00:04:53.450> look<00:04:53.630> at<00:04:53.750> the<00:04:53.870> model

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:54.289 
so let's turn let's go look at the model

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:56.860 
so let's turn let's go look at the model
and<00:04:54.740> you<00:04:54.770> know<00:04:55.520> I'm<00:04:55.789> known<00:04:56.060> for<00:04:56.300> making<00:04:56.450> weird

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
and you know I'm known for making weird

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:59.620 
and you know I'm known for making weird
stuff<00:04:57.200> so<00:04:58.099> then<00:04:58.340> this<00:04:58.940> looks<00:04:59.120> pretty<00:04:59.419> weird

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
stuff so then this looks pretty weird

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.990 
stuff so then this looks pretty weird
right<00:04:59.780> so<00:05:00.680> I<00:05:00.710> took<00:05:00.830> this<00:05:01.130> doll<00:05:01.400> head<00:05:01.610> model<00:05:01.940> I

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:02.000 
right so I took this doll head model I

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.790 
right so I took this doll head model I
had<00:05:02.180> split<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.599> up<00:05:02.690> and<00:05:02.870> put<00:05:03.020> an<00:05:03.110> eyeball<00:05:03.470> and

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:03.800 
had split it up and put an eyeball and

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:06.040 
had split it up and put an eyeball and
then<00:05:03.979> attach<00:05:04.460> this<00:05:04.700> thing<00:05:04.940> to<00:05:05.060> drop<00:05:05.240> bombs<00:05:05.570> and

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:06.050 
then attach this thing to drop bombs and

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.830 
then attach this thing to drop bombs and
a<00:05:06.080> little<00:05:06.260> helicopter<00:05:06.380> thing<00:05:06.919> and<00:05:07.450> if<00:05:08.450> anybody

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:08.840 
a little helicopter thing and if anybody

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:10.960 
a little helicopter thing and if anybody
knows<00:05:09.080> like<00:05:09.680> sell<00:05:09.950> this<00:05:10.190> texture<00:05:10.669> see<00:05:10.849> it's

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:10.970 
knows like sell this texture see it's

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:12.490 
knows like sell this texture see it's
like<00:05:11.120> the<00:05:11.240> right<00:05:11.389> way<00:05:11.539> in<00:05:11.599> cinema<00:05:11.990> 4d<00:05:12.110> but<00:05:12.410> when

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:12.500 
like the right way in cinema 4d but when

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:13.990 
like the right way in cinema 4d but when
I<00:05:12.530> bring<00:05:12.740> my<00:05:12.800> textures<00:05:13.310> in<00:05:13.430> a<00:05:13.520> unity<00:05:13.849> they're

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:14.000 
I bring my textures in a unity they're

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.029 
I bring my textures in a unity they're
reversed<00:05:14.389> so<00:05:14.630> it<00:05:14.720> makes<00:05:14.870> it<00:05:14.960> backwards<00:05:15.410> so<00:05:16.010> I

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
reversed so it makes it backwards so I

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:17.170 
reversed so it makes it backwards so I
think<00:05:16.099> it<00:05:16.220> has<00:05:16.310> something<00:05:16.520> to<00:05:16.639> do<00:05:16.729> with<00:05:16.760> UV

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:17.180 
think it has something to do with UV

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.460 
think it has something to do with UV
flipping<00:05:17.570> or<00:05:17.690> something<00:05:17.960> so<00:05:18.080> if<00:05:18.169> anybody

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:18.470 
flipping or something so if anybody

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.140 
flipping or something so if anybody
knows<00:05:18.680> what<00:05:18.889> that's<00:05:19.099> about<00:05:19.280> and<00:05:19.760> what<00:05:20.120> I

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:20.150 
knows what that's about and what I

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:20.740 
knows what that's about and what I
should<00:05:20.389> do

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:20.750 
should do

00:05:20.750 --> 00:05:22.600 
should do
besides<00:05:21.110> flip<00:05:21.380> the<00:05:21.500> UVs<00:05:21.800> or<00:05:21.919> me<00:05:22.039> import<00:05:22.310> it<00:05:22.400> let

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
besides flip the UVs or me import it let

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:25.779 
besides flip the UVs or me import it let
me<00:05:22.639> know<00:05:22.700> so<00:05:23.570> here's<00:05:23.780> this<00:05:23.960> model<00:05:24.580> now<00:05:25.580> let's

00:05:25.779 --> 00:05:25.789 
me know so here's this model now let's

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:29.460 
me know so here's this model now let's
go<00:05:25.970> see<00:05:26.180> him<00:05:26.510> in<00:05:26.780> unity

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
go see him in unity

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.720 
go see him in unity
go<00:05:29.800> into<00:05:30.130> the<00:05:30.280> scene<00:05:30.520> view<00:05:30.990> where<00:05:31.990> does<00:05:32.140> he

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:32.730 
go into the scene view where does he

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:35.880
