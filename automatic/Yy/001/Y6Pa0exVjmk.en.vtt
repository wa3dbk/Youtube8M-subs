00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.740
 on the other 

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:30.869
 let's go then to see I have decided to 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:34.170
 make this stage come because I saw 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:41.070
 that there were still packages 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:44.879
 to have six hours from 15,000 fried of 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.030
 do this i think i only open it 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:52.260
 packages of 15,000 do not know how many they have 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.910
 play almost really find something 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.579
 good for the issues of 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.789
 will reach like the others really me 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:01.920
 like and I recommend written from the channel 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.769
 that comes to the face of all the duty 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.979
 of switzerland said this we start in the 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:12.409
 first package of 15,000 credits has 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:14.460
 checked the chances on the cover 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.840
 find how we have been enough 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:20.750
 lucky to good bars 50 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:34.539
 dania species grows in the anpi cards 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:34.539
 however we see 10,000 credits disaster 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.709
 therefore we keep everything in the cold 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:47.270
 nothing the first package a little boy 

00:01:42.709 --> 00:01:50.539

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.619

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:53.619
 always with el shaarawy 

00:01:53.709 --> 00:02:01.280
 this second package of 15,000 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:06.280

 in this pack opening first one 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:40.810
 legend 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:43.389
 dani alves then there are the facts that 

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:49.239

00:03:43.389 --> 00:03:53.919
 spent more than 30,000 but already with dempsey 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:58.290
 we are almost rebuilt and I really am 

00:03:53.919 --> 00:04:02.280
 is very happy one of me knows that the 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:07.239
 first game informs that I find this year 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:11.109
 is therefore we go with these packages are 

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:14.049
 states that at lucky times have 

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:14.940
 still vidal from the budgets has brought 

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:18.849
