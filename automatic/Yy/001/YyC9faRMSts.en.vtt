00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
in terms of leanness of meat and if I

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.830 
in terms of leanness of meat and if I
guess<00:01:56.670> if<00:01:56.820> you<00:01:56.909> don't<00:01:57.060> cook<00:01:57.240> it<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.479> right<00:01:57.630> way

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620 
allow this to go through but number one

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:02.720 
allow this to go through but number one
I<00:05:01.650> wouldn't<00:05:01.950> hold<00:05:02.070> my<00:05:02.160> breath<00:05:02.250> for<00:05:02.640> that

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
I wouldn't hold my breath for that

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.540 
I wouldn't hold my breath for that
because<00:05:02.970> they<00:05:03.290> if<00:05:04.290> I<00:05:04.470> had<00:05:04.590> to<00:05:04.740> guess<00:05:04.920> I<00:05:05.160> would<00:05:05.190> I

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
because they if I had to guess I would I

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.640 
because they if I had to guess I would I
think<00:05:05.670> they<00:05:05.940> would<00:05:06.150> approve<00:05:06.840> the<00:05:07.140> acquisition

and<00:05:08.030> number<00:05:09.030> two<00:05:09.240> if<00:05:10.200> it<00:05:10.650> goes<00:05:10.830> through<00:05:11.130> and

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:11.580 
and number two if it goes through and

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.300 
and number two if it goes through and
this<00:05:11.940> is<00:05:12.000> allowed<00:05:12.950> we're<00:05:13.950> done
