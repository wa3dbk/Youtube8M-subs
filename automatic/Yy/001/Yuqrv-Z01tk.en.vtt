both<00:02:03.990> matches<00:02:04.649> on<00:02:04.799> Friday<00:02:05.100> they<00:02:05.700> dropped

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
both matches on Friday they dropped

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.749 
both matches on Friday they dropped

every single map on Friday and the
reason<00:02:09.119> that's<00:02:09.239> a<00:02:09.360> bad<00:02:09.629> start<00:02:10.050> I<00:02:10.229> mean<00:02:10.470> they

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
reason that's a bad start I mean they

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.290 
reason that's a bad start I mean they

it<00:02:13.170> wasn't<00:02:13.530> against<00:02:13.830> phase<00:02:14.100> or<00:02:14.460> envy<00:02:15.180> it<00:02:15.480> was

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:15.810 
it wasn't against phase or envy it was

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.250 
it wasn't against phase or envy it was
against<00:02:16.380> revenge<00:02:17.310> and<00:02:17.730> stunner<00:02:18.600> it<00:02:19.080> was

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
against revenge and stunner it was

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.500 
against revenge and stunner it was
against<00:02:19.650> two<00:02:19.890> teams<00:02:20.250> that<00:02:20.670> they<00:02:21.180> come<00:02:21.390> up

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
against two teams that they come up

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.630 
against two teams that they come up
against<00:02:21.810> online<00:02:22.020> in<00:02:22.590> two<00:02:22.770> kids<00:02:23.010> in<00:02:23.160> five<00:02:23.370> K's

against online in two kids in five K's

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.820 
against online in two kids in five K's
but<00:02:24.120> that<00:02:24.270> smack<00:02:24.630> them<00:02:24.870> on<00:02:24.900> land<00:02:25.290> and<00:02:25.560> it<00:02:25.680> was

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
but that smack them on land and it was

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.460 
but that smack them on land and it was
like<00:02:26.070> everybody<00:02:27.060> was<00:02:27.270> stunned<00:02:27.690> nobody<00:02:28.230> knew

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
like everybody was stunned nobody knew

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:30.440 
like everybody was stunned nobody knew
even<00:02:29.100> optic<00:02:29.490> didn't<00:02:29.790> know<00:02:29.880> what<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> heck<00:02:30.270> was

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
even optic didn't know what the heck was

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.360 
even optic didn't know what the heck was
going<00:02:30.480> on<00:02:30.780> and<00:02:31.020> how<00:02:31.230> they<00:02:31.440> lost<00:02:31.740> they<00:02:31.980> didn't<00:02:32.250> I

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
going on and how they lost they didn't I

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.730 
going on and how they lost they didn't I
mean<00:02:32.670> it<00:02:32.700> was<00:02:33.060> just<00:02:33.120> baffling<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.200> all<00:02:34.380> of<00:02:34.620> us

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:34.740 
mean it was just baffling to all of us

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.920 
mean it was just baffling to all of us
that<00:02:34.950> optic<00:02:35.640> went<00:02:35.820> 0<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.090> 6<00:02:36.300> and<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:36.510> reason

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:36.930 
that optic went 0 and 6 and the reason

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:38.840 
that optic went 0 and 6 and the reason
why<00:02:37.050> that's<00:02:37.290> bad<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:37.890> that<00:02:38.280> most<00:02:38.520> people

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:38.850 
why that's bad and that most people

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:40.550 
why that's bad and that most people
predicted<00:02:39.270> that<00:02:39.360> it<00:02:39.510> was<00:02:39.630> done<00:02:39.870> for<00:02:40.200> them<00:02:40.350> is

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
predicted that it was done for them is

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.860 
predicted that it was done for them is
because<00:02:41.010> map<00:02:41.520> count<00:02:41.850> counts<00:02:42.420> when<00:02:42.570> it<00:02:42.660> comes

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
because map count counts when it comes

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.260 
because map count counts when it comes
to<00:02:42.990> head<00:02:43.170> to<00:02:43.350> head<00:02:43.500> now<00:02:44.070> on<00:02:44.370> Saturday<00:02:44.880> morning

to head to head now on Saturday morning
I<00:02:45.420> tweeted<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:46.320> how<00:02:46.830> optic<00:02:47.550> could<00:02:47.820> make<00:02:48.120> it<00:02:48.330> to

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I tweeted out how optic could make it to

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.940 
I tweeted out how optic could make it to
the<00:02:48.780> winner's<00:02:49.110> bracket<00:02:49.260> because<00:02:49.530> only<00:02:49.770> the
