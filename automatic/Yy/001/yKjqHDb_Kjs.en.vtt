so<00:00:00.329> where<00:00:00.630> are<00:00:00.659> we<00:00:00.840> in<00:00:01.050> the<00:00:01.380> capitalism<00:00:02.190> to

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:02.550 
so where are we in the capitalism to

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.730 
so where are we in the capitalism to
collectivism<00:00:03.179> cycle<00:00:03.780> because<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.290> is<00:00:04.470> far

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:04.740 
collectivism cycle because this is far

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.620 
collectivism cycle because this is far
more<00:00:04.950> important<00:00:06.020> the<00:00:07.020> the<00:00:07.550> loss<00:00:08.550> of<00:00:08.760> freedom

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:09.630 
more important the the loss of freedom

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.499 
more important the the loss of freedom
is<00:00:09.900> a<00:00:10.340> freedom<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.460> far<00:00:11.700> more<00:00:11.880> important<00:00:12.389> than

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
is a freedom is far more important than

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.320 
is a freedom is far more important than
our<00:00:12.630> wealth<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.370> that's<00:00:14.370> one<00:00:14.670> thing<00:00:14.940> that<00:00:14.969> Ron

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.330 
our wealth and that's one thing that Ron

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.630 
our wealth and that's one thing that Ron
Paul<00:00:15.360> pointed<00:00:16.170> out<00:00:16.289> to<00:00:16.560> me<00:00:16.590> and<00:00:16.920> I<00:00:17.340> really

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
Paul pointed out to me and I really

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.429 
Paul pointed out to me and I really
thought<00:00:17.880> about<00:00:18.150> for<00:00:18.449> a<00:00:18.510> long<00:00:18.779> time<00:00:19.109> if<00:00:19.289> you've

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439 
thought about for a long time if you've

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.290 
thought about for a long time if you've
got<00:00:19.680> wealth<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.730> you<00:00:20.820> don't<00:00:21.000> have<00:00:21.180> the

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
got wealth and you don't have the

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.390 
got wealth and you don't have the
freedom<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:21.660> spend<00:00:21.960> it<00:00:22.170> where<00:00:22.320> you<00:00:22.500> want<00:00:22.740> when

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
freedom to spend it where you want when

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.650 
freedom to spend it where you want when
you<00:00:23.519> don't<00:00:23.699> have<00:00:23.880> the<00:00:24.029> freedom<00:00:24.359> to<00:00:24.390> protect

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
you don't have the freedom to protect

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.599 
you don't have the freedom to protect
your<00:00:25.140> own<00:00:25.170> wealth<00:00:25.560> and<00:00:25.890> the<00:00:26.010> government<00:00:26.430> can

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
your own wealth and the government can

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:28.040 
your own wealth and the government can
take<00:00:26.640> it<00:00:27.000> from<00:00:27.240> you<00:00:27.390> and<00:00:27.420> share<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:28.019> with

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
take it from you and share it with

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.660 
take it from you and share it with
everybody

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
everybody

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.069 
everybody
then<00:00:30.199> there's<00:00:31.199> no<00:00:31.380> point<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.859> having<00:00:32.070> wealth

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
then there's no point in having wealth

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:37.040 
then there's no point in having wealth
this<00:00:34.079> is<00:00:34.469> how<00:00:35.309> big<00:00:35.550> our<00:00:35.820> debt<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.390> compared<00:00:36.989> to

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
this is how big our debt is compared to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.350 
this is how big our debt is compared to
the<00:00:37.200> size<00:00:37.380> of<00:00:37.620> our<00:00:37.770> economy<00:00:38.370> so<00:00:38.610> it's<00:00:38.820> debt<00:00:39.149> as

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
the size of our economy so it's debt as

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.170 
the size of our economy so it's debt as
a<00:00:39.600> percent<00:00:40.140> of<00:00:40.290> GDP<00:00:40.879> here<00:00:41.879> we<00:00:42.000> are

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
a percent of GDP here we are

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.709 
a percent of GDP here we are
we<00:00:42.690> just<00:00:42.960> passed<00:00:43.260> the<00:00:43.590> 100<00:00:44.190> percent<00:00:44.340> mark<00:00:44.850> so

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
we just passed the 100 percent mark so

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.990 
we just passed the 100 percent mark so
the<00:00:45.870> amount<00:00:46.140> we<00:00:46.320> owe<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.860> bigger<00:00:47.370> than<00:00:47.850> the

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
the amount we owe is bigger than the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.540 
the amount we owe is bigger than the
size<00:00:48.210> of<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.600> economy<00:00:49.200> so<00:00:49.829> we're<00:00:50.070> getting<00:00:50.370> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
size of the economy so we're getting to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.000 
size of the economy so we're getting to
some<00:00:50.760> extremely<00:00:51.660> dangerous<00:00:51.930> levels<00:00:52.680> here

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
some extremely dangerous levels here

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.130 
some extremely dangerous levels here
where<00:00:53.640> there<00:00:54.090> there<00:00:54.300> comes<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.780> certain<00:00:54.960> point

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
where there there comes a certain point

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.709 
where there there comes a certain point
where<00:00:55.559> there<00:00:55.710> is<00:00:55.739> no<00:00:56.160> turning<00:00:56.399> back<00:00:56.610> and<00:00:57.149> we're

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
where there is no turning back and we're

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
where there is no turning back and we're
getting<00:00:57.840> to<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.260> point<00:00:58.559> where<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.340> choices

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
getting to this point where the choices

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.660 
getting to this point where the choices
are<00:01:00.000> default<00:01:00.899> on<00:01:01.079> the<00:01:01.199> debt<00:01:01.230> or

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
are default on the debt or

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.190 
are default on the debt or
hyper-inflated<00:01:02.670> away<00:01:03.090> and<00:01:04.040> when<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.250> default

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
hyper-inflated away and when you default

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.100 
hyper-inflated away and when you default
that<00:01:07.200> robs<00:01:07.820> investors<00:01:08.820> so<00:01:09.180> it's<00:01:09.360> it's<00:01:09.600> baisha

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
that robs investors so it's it's baisha

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.500 
that robs investors so it's it's baisha
basically<00:01:10.830> stealing<00:01:11.130> from<00:01:11.400> the<00:01:11.549> rich<00:01:11.729> when

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
basically stealing from the rich when

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.780 
basically stealing from the rich when
you<00:01:12.630> hyper<00:01:12.900> inflate<00:01:13.439> you<00:01:14.040> steal<00:01:14.400> from<00:01:14.640> the

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
you hyper inflate you steal from the

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.789 
you hyper inflate you steal from the
middle-class<00:01:15.119> instead<00:01:16.080> you're<00:01:16.409> stealing

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
middle-class instead you're stealing

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:18.890 
middle-class instead you're stealing
from<00:01:16.979> people<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.430> are<00:01:17.490> saving<00:01:18.030> currency<00:01:18.720> and

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
from people that are saving currency and

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.010 
from people that are saving currency and
the<00:01:18.990> average<00:01:19.409> wage<00:01:19.770> worker<00:01:20.220> and<00:01:20.610> so<00:01:21.180> usually

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
the average wage worker and so usually

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.080 
the average wage worker and so usually
it's<00:01:22.350> that<00:01:22.799> they<00:01:23.040> try<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.610> hyperinflation

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
it's that they try the hyperinflation

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.920 
it's that they try the hyperinflation
thing<00:01:24.900> it's<00:01:25.200> basically<00:01:25.619> if<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:26.220> default

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:26.930 
thing it's basically if you default

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:28.999 
thing it's basically if you default
you're<00:01:27.930> punishing<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.470> whole<00:01:28.590> lot<00:01:28.770> of<00:01:28.890> people

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
you're punishing a whole lot of people

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.649 
you're punishing a whole lot of people
that<00:01:29.189> are<00:01:29.400> friends<00:01:29.670> with<00:01:30.000> people<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.509> high

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
that are friends with people in high

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.969 
that are friends with people in high
places<00:01:30.720> so<00:01:32.000> we<00:01:33.000> don't<00:01:33.210> know<00:01:33.590> which<00:01:34.590> way<00:01:34.770> we're

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
places so we don't know which way we're

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.640 
places so we don't know which way we're
going<00:01:35.009> to<00:01:35.220> go<00:01:35.460> yet<00:01:35.759> but<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.630> odds<00:01:36.869> are<00:01:37.200> that<00:01:37.470> we

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
going to go yet but the odds are that we

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.999 
going to go yet but the odds are that we
would<00:01:37.829> try<00:01:38.579> to<00:01:38.810> inflate<00:01:39.810> our<00:01:40.020> way<00:01:40.229> out<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.590> this

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
would try to inflate our way out of this

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.219 
would try to inflate our way out of this
debt<00:01:41.369> because<00:01:41.850> the<00:01:42.570> Federal<00:01:42.899> Reserve

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
debt because the Federal Reserve

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.590 
debt because the Federal Reserve
actually<00:01:43.950> thinks<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:44.729> and<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.149> government

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
actually thinks and and the government

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.840 
actually thinks and and the government
thinks<00:01:46.049> they<00:01:46.110> can<00:01:46.409> recreate<00:01:46.850> prosperity

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
thinks they can recreate prosperity

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.499 
thinks they can recreate prosperity
through<00:01:48.180> deficit<00:01:48.720> spending<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.380> so<00:01:50.270> that<00:01:51.270> is

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
through deficit spending and so that is

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.350 
through deficit spending and so that is
an<00:01:51.689> inflationary<00:01:52.610> thing<00:01:53.610> whenever<00:01:53.850> you<00:01:54.210> do

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
an inflationary thing whenever you do

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.999 
an inflationary thing whenever you do
deficit<00:01:54.869> spending<00:01:55.290> and<00:01:55.470> create<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.799> whole

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009 
deficit spending and create a whole

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.859 
deficit spending and create a whole
bunch<00:01:56.040> of<00:01:56.340> busywork<00:01:56.820> for<00:01:57.180> a<00:01:57.210> bunch<00:01:57.719> of

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
bunch of busywork for a bunch of

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:01.789 
bunch of busywork for a bunch of
government<00:01:58.290> employees<00:01:59.420> but<00:02:00.420> this<00:02:00.960> gets<00:02:01.439> to

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
government employees but this gets to
