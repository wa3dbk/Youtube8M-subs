00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:18.630
 a mass with the book reality is well 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.730
 quick to make it looks good and to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.980
 Who does not like the people that I know 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.410
 It's not everyone who likes to give 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.100
 replace canned sardines is also 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.320
 pretty cool 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.780
 So let's go and make this recipe. 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.570
 here in my pot I already have one 

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:36.510
 chopped onion and I put two 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:38.249
 Daily teeth also chopped the garlic 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:39.960
 people are very criterion of each one 

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:42.329
 who does not like diary does not need 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.859
 put or who like very much can 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.550
 put a little more 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:49.739
 here I have two tomatoes is that I 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.230
 I simply took the seed also 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.690
 I'll be fine, I'll give you a tip 

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:56.879
 Here for you, how do I do it? 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.159
 take the seed out of the tomato in a way 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.899
 easy and then went to taste 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:04.820
 I do not know if there comes the tomato in water 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:07.380
 I cut it in the middle 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.840
 after I cut in half apart 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.829
 here gives little I turn down cuts 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.880
 again in the middle and then I come with the knife 

00:01:13.829 --> 00:01:19.110
 here o 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:21.240
 and I do it here and there it is practically the 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.729
 whole seed that here you shave and 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.619
 it's ready, it's only you to cut the size 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.960
 Whatever you want then this is my tip. 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.140
 For you, Chinese and mind. 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.670
 good going back the recipe of course ours 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.500
 litigation is good 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.039
 when we go there is rubbish here I go 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.110
 to put about 78 is 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:43.180
 filezinho from ali typing 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.340
 It is a custom August and to fry the 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.380
 onion I will not use olive oil or use this 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.450
 the line that comes here along with one with the 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.450
 ready to leave with more intense flavor 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.730
 yet clear after some cheese 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.340
 parmesan to put to finish 

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:59.560
 and I'm already cooking a canoe that 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.000
 The quantity here singing to you is 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.920
 for two people and I'm cooking 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.229
 plus the event using that pasta 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.850
 screw they can use a type of 

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:10.270
 pasta you want 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.310
 It's kind of like I'm using 350 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:14.170
 pasta noodles for two people to 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.890
 This is one more ingredient I forgot. 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.440
 to speak 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.190
 the juice of half a lemon then we'll go 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.350
 start on the fire or we will not fake it and if there is 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.780
 this onion I'm going to get my 

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:29.620
 had to be able to get a 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:33.280
 little bit of this oil that I'm going to 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.630
 fry with it so people here 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.450
 I'm reshaping here is more or less 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:39.610
 a minute or two of my onion and the 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.959
 garlic you can see that it is not even 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.870
 started to brown 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:45.370
 and here's one thing depending on the brand 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.049
 people have several brands depending on the 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.850
 mark you buy the skin 

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:49.600
 You can be very small like this here. 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.370
 see 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.630
 in this case man has the quantity I 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.190
 I put a little more here in the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:56.140
 little saucer 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.549
 okay I put a little bit more like a 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.989
 of the products the amount of waste is 

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:01.239
 much to the taste of each one 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:02.320
 so at this point I already came with my 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:03.850
 limit 

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.820
 you will realize that it will solve 

00:03:03.850 --> 00:03:08.950
 here in the middle for goes my sui 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:11.769
 so it's cover why I put it 

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:14.830
 before the onion is 100% golden 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:16.930
 floated the staff is really fast is 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:18.159
 watching your little daughter, manager 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.980
 I'm fine even if you're 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:23.590
 thus tying the weakest upon him 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:27.909
 practically only then can the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:30.189
 tomato there now do not leave me this 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.079
 tomatoes that thesis slogan that fit 

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:35.709
 in the eye neymar knows until when has it gone 

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:38.379
 a fear mill now just leave it here in the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:41.250
 fire and stirring the man from time to time 

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:43.810
 Look, there's just the tomato he practically 

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:45.700
 dissolved in the middle and formed the 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.760
 our line then at that moment I already 

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:51.459
 I can hang up and then I 'll go 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.120
 come with that juice of half a lemon here 

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:58.389
 just to give a touch but the blue whiting in 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:01.870
 end and our eye is ready then only 

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:05.079
 I expected the pasta to be 100% and we 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.000
 then finish the staff to noodles 

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:09.489
 People cook a common cause like you 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.829
 do at home in waters skip our 

00:04:09.489 --> 00:04:15.819
 Mourinho is ready so here it is
