00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
those two dots you can get the different

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.420 
those two dots you can get the different
angles<00:00:50.870> and<00:00:51.870> use<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.230> as<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> stand<00:00:52.829> so<00:00:53.250> the

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
angles and use it as a stand so the

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:59.090 
angles and use it as a stand so the
portrait<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:57.079> land<00:00:58.079> you<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.469> both<00:00:58.620> get<00:00:58.890> both

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
portrait and land you can both get both

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.660 
portrait and land you can both get both

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:17.070 

I<00:02:14.440> also<00:02:15.190> really<00:02:15.670> like<00:02:15.880> the<00:02:16.090> keyboard<00:02:16.540> because

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
I also really like the keyboard because

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.910 
I also really like the keyboard because
it<00:02:17.740> is<00:02:18.070> as<00:02:18.760> long<00:02:19.000> as<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.480> iPad<00:02:19.870> usually<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
it is as long as the iPad usually the

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:23.490 
it is as long as the iPad usually the
keyboards<00:02:21.460> on<00:02:21.670> most<00:02:22.150> cases<00:02:22.630> are<00:02:23.050> a<00:02:23.080> little<00:02:23.380> bit

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
keyboards on most cases are a little bit

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.220 
keyboards on most cases are a little bit
smaller<00:02:23.830> or<00:02:24.130> the<00:02:24.760> keys<00:02:25.330> would<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.840> a<00:02:26.020> little

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:26.230 
smaller or the keys would be a little

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.980 
smaller or the keys would be a little
bit<00:02:26.350> narrower<00:02:26.620> so<00:02:27.190> it's<00:02:27.340> harder<00:02:28.330> to<00:02:28.480> type<00:02:28.690> but

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
bit narrower so it's harder to type but

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:32.460 
bit narrower so it's harder to type but
this<00:02:29.170> this<00:02:29.560> size<00:02:29.800> is<00:02:30.100> pretty<00:02:30.280> easy<00:02:31.470> the

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
this this size is pretty easy the

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.370 
this this size is pretty easy the
battery<00:02:32.830> life<00:02:33.070> on<00:02:33.250> this<00:02:33.370> keyboard<00:02:34.260> from<00:02:35.260> a

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.610 
full charge will be up to 130 hours
which<00:02:38.500> is<00:02:38.710> approximately<00:02:39.480> if<00:02:40.480> you<00:02:40.720> used<00:02:41.110> the
