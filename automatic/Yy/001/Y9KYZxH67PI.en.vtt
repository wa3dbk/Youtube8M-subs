00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
packages yeah that is helpful if I want

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.640 
packages yeah that is helpful if I want
10<00:02:24.590> plants<00:02:24.830> I'd<00:02:25.040> have<00:02:25.280> to

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:25.650 
10 plants I'd have to

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:27.319 
10 plants I'd have to
more<00:02:25.799> than<00:02:25.920> ten<00:02:26.129> seeds<00:02:26.459> because<00:02:26.849> I<00:02:26.879> know<00:02:27.030> a

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:27.329 
more than ten seeds because I know a

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:31.339 
more than ten seeds because I know a
certain<00:02:27.780> amount<00:02:27.959> won't<00:02:28.260> germinate<00:02:28.530> I<00:02:30.349> see

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
certain amount won't germinate I see

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:32.720 
certain amount won't germinate I see
something<00:02:31.739> over<00:02:31.829> here<00:02:32.129> that<00:02:32.189> I<00:02:32.370> really

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
something over here that I really

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:34.190 
something over here that I really
haven't<00:02:32.879> seen<00:02:33.150> before<00:02:33.510> and<00:02:33.659> it's<00:02:33.780> called<00:02:34.049> a

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
seedling he wins this very often on the

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
back of the seed package you'll also see

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.059 
back of the seed package you'll also see
temperatures<00:02:41.519> ideal<00:02:41.970> temperatures<00:02:42.629> for<00:02:43.170> for

temperatures ideal temperatures for for

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.280 
temperatures ideal temperatures for for

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
germination and ideal temperatures for

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.780 
germination and ideal temperatures for
growing<00:02:47.209> often<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:49.049> seeds<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:50.400> to<00:02:50.640> be

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:50.790 
growing often the seeds like to be

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.199 
growing often the seeds like to be
warmer<00:02:51.390> to<00:02:51.810> germinate<00:02:52.409> than<00:02:52.950> they<00:02:53.129> need<00:02:53.670> to<00:02:54.030> be

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
warmer to germinate than they need to be

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.199 
warmer to germinate than they need to be
warm<00:02:54.989> for<00:02:55.379> growing<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:56.220> we<00:02:56.459> can<00:02:56.640> grow<00:02:56.790> a<00:02:56.819> lot<00:02:57.090> of

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
warm for growing so we can grow a lot of

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.569 
warm for growing so we can grow a lot of
things<00:02:57.390> outside<00:02:57.799> but<00:02:58.799> it's<00:02:58.920> easier<00:02:59.370> and

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
things outside but it's easier and

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.460 
things outside but it's easier and
faster<00:02:59.639> to<00:03:00.120> germinate<00:03:00.840> them<00:03:00.989> with<00:03:01.139> a<00:03:01.170> bit<00:03:01.349> of

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
faster to germinate them with a bit of

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:06.740 
faster to germinate them with a bit of
heat<00:03:01.709> now<00:03:02.250> that<00:03:02.459> my<00:03:02.579> zucchinis<00:03:03.269> are<00:03:05.540> planted<00:03:06.540> I

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:06.750 
heat now that my zucchinis are planted I

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.259 
heat now that my zucchinis are planted I
will<00:03:07.590> put<00:03:07.829> them<00:03:07.950> on<00:03:08.099> top<00:03:08.280> of<00:03:08.489> the<00:03:08.579> seed<00:03:08.849> mat<00:03:11.269> to

00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:12.269 
will put them on top of the seed mat to

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:15.319 
will put them on top of the seed mat to
get<00:03:12.480> them<00:03:12.689> to<00:03:13.019> germinate<00:03:13.680> a<00:03:13.980> little<00:03:14.489> bit<00:03:14.639> more

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
get them to germinate a little bit more

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.190 
get them to germinate a little bit more
evenly<00:03:16.639> I'm<00:03:17.639> going<00:03:17.909> to<00:03:18.030> plant<00:03:18.269> some<00:03:18.359> more<00:03:18.780> kale

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
evenly I'm going to plant some more kale

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.629 
evenly I'm going to plant some more kale
because<00:03:19.530> I<00:03:19.709> don't<00:03:19.889> think<00:03:19.950> I've<00:03:20.189> got<00:03:20.340> enough

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:20.639 
because I don't think I've got enough

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:23.330 
because I don't think I've got enough
kale<00:03:20.909> in<00:03:21.180> my<00:03:21.329> in<00:03:21.810> my<00:03:22.079> greenhouse<00:03:22.349> so<00:03:23.069> there's

00:03:23.330 --> 00:03:23.340 
kale in my in my greenhouse so there's

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.250 
kale in my in my greenhouse so there's
many<00:03:23.609> different<00:03:23.879> kinds<00:03:24.359> of<00:03:24.480> kale<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.959> choose

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
many different kinds of kale to choose

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:28.849 
many different kinds of kale to choose
from<00:03:26.000> these<00:03:27.000> kale<00:03:27.720> transplant<00:03:28.379> very<00:03:28.620> easily

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:28.859 
from these kale transplant very easily

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:30.409 
from these kale transplant very easily
they<00:03:29.220> don't<00:03:29.400> mind<00:03:29.579> their<00:03:29.790> roots<00:03:30.150> being

00:03:30.409 --> 00:03:30.419 
they don't mind their roots being

00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:32.599 
they don't mind their roots being
disturbed<00:03:30.810> I'm<00:03:31.139> going<00:03:31.470> to<00:03:31.560> broadcast<00:03:31.799> this

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
disturbed I'm going to broadcast this

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:37.580 
disturbed I'm going to broadcast this
because<00:03:33.180> it's<00:03:33.359> an<00:03:33.510> easy<00:03:33.810> way<00:03:35.180> plant<00:03:36.590> another

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
because it's an easy way plant another

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.710 
because it's an easy way plant another
thing<00:03:37.949> that's<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:38.910> so<00:03:39.660> important<00:03:40.290> is<00:03:40.859> labeling

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
thing that's so so important is labeling

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.649 
thing that's so so important is labeling
right<00:03:42.720> away<00:03:43.129> this<00:03:44.129> is<00:03:44.430> my<00:03:44.730> winter<00:03:45.000> bore<00:03:45.359> kale

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
right away this is my winter bore kale

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.270 
right away this is my winter bore kale
yeah<00:03:46.139> that's<00:03:46.650> probably<00:03:46.799> about<00:03:47.040> another

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
yeah that's probably about another

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.110 
yeah that's probably about another
hundred<00:03:47.549> and<00:03:47.699> fifty<00:03:48.060> seeds<00:03:49.400> and<00:03:50.400> they<00:03:50.940> won't

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
hundred and fifty seeds and they won't

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.869 
hundred and fifty seeds and they won't
all<00:03:51.329> grow<00:03:51.540> but<00:03:51.750> if<00:03:51.870> I<00:03:51.989> get<00:03:52.049> another<00:03:52.409> 60<00:03:53.340> 50<00:03:53.730> to

00:03:53.869 --> 00:03:53.879 
all grow but if I get another 60 50 to

00:03:53.879 --> 00:03:58.640 
all grow but if I get another 60 50 to
60<00:03:54.269> kales<00:03:55.019> that<00:03:55.319> they'll<00:03:55.440> be<00:03:55.680> very<00:03:55.799> happy<00:03:57.650> so

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:58.650 
60 kales that they'll be very happy so

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:00.559 
60 kales that they'll be very happy so
then<00:03:58.829> I<00:03:58.859> just<00:03:59.190> do<00:03:59.310> a<00:03:59.340> light<00:03:59.609> dusting<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.299> dirt

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:00.569 
then I just do a light dusting of dirt

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:03.110 
then I just do a light dusting of dirt
over<00:04:01.079> everything<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:02.250> may<00:04:02.370> be<00:04:02.430> a<00:04:02.579> quarter<00:04:03.030> of

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
over everything it may be a quarter of

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:04.580 
over everything it may be a quarter of
an<00:04:03.209> inch<00:04:03.329> eighth<00:04:03.629> of<00:04:03.870> an<00:04:03.989> inch<00:04:04.109> to<00:04:04.260> a<00:04:04.409> quarter

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
an inch eighth of an inch to a quarter

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.890 
an inch eighth of an inch to a quarter
of<00:04:04.739> an<00:04:04.919> inch<00:04:05.040> now<00:04:05.879> I'm<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.209> to<00:04:06.299> move<00:04:06.540> it<00:04:06.720> on

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
of an inch now I'm going to move it on

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:13.699 
of an inch now I'm going to move it on
to<00:04:07.139> my<00:04:07.290> heat<00:04:07.590> mat<00:04:07.919> now<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:13.260> want<00:04:13.409> a<00:04:13.470> very

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
to my heat mat now you want a very

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:15.680 
to my heat mat now you want a very
delicate<00:04:14.069> little<00:04:14.669> spray<00:04:15.000> on<00:04:15.030> them<00:04:15.419> at<00:04:15.540> this

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:15.690 
delicate little spray on them at this

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.469 
delicate little spray on them at this
point<00:04:15.989> and<00:04:16.639> sometimes<00:04:17.639> if<00:04:17.880> your<00:04:18.030> dirt<00:04:18.269> is

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
point and sometimes if your dirt is

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:21.490 
point and sometimes if your dirt is
quite<00:04:18.810> dry<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:20.370> have<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.609> do<00:04:20.729> it<00:04:20.849> in<00:04:21.000> tiny

00:04:21.490 --> 00:04:21.500 
quite dry you have to do it in tiny

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.480 
quite dry you have to do it in tiny
installations<00:04:22.500> otherwise<00:04:22.860> it<00:04:23.070> just<00:04:23.220> makes

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
installations otherwise it just makes

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:25.969 
installations otherwise it just makes
everything<00:04:23.639> float<00:04:24.240> and<00:04:24.539> your<00:04:25.440> seeds<00:04:25.740> move

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
everything float and your seeds move

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.399 
everything float and your seeds move
around<00:04:26.280> so<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:26.729> want<00:04:26.909> to<00:04:27.000> do<00:04:27.229> gentle<00:04:28.229> little

00:04:28.399 --> 00:04:28.409 
around so you want to do gentle little

00:04:28.409 --> 00:04:30.500 
around so you want to do gentle little
watering<00:04:29.010> now<00:04:29.310> because<00:04:29.820> they're<00:04:30.060> on<00:04:30.210> a<00:04:30.240> heat

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:30.510 
watering now because they're on a heat

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.500 
watering now because they're on a heat
mat<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.169> they're<00:04:31.979> getting<00:04:32.159> warmer<00:04:32.669> they<00:04:33.360> may

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:33.510 
mat and they're getting warmer they may

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:34.760
