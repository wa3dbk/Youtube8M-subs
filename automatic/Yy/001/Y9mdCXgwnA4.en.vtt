millimeter it helps to have the start

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:58.770 
millimeter it helps to have the start
out<00:01:52.740> as<00:01:52.860> straight<00:01:53.189> which<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.850> don't<00:01:54.439> so<00:01:56.869> mines

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
out as straight which I don't so mines
