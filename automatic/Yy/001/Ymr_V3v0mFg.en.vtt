lace paneling on top and this shirt is
kind<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.870> neat<00:00:49.079> because<00:00:49.200> it's<00:00:49.469> big<00:00:49.649> enough

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
kind of neat because it's big enough

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.740 
kind of neat because it's big enough
where<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.579> can<00:00:50.670> also<00:00:50.940> like<00:00:51.270> wear<00:00:51.480> it<00:00:51.510> off<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
where I can also like wear it off the

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.220 
where I can also like wear it off the
shoulder<00:00:51.960> if<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> want<00:00:52.860> to<00:00:53.390> and<00:00:54.390> I<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:55.020> just

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
shoulder if I want to and I like to just

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:56.810 
shoulder if I want to and I like to just
tuck<00:00:55.469> it<00:00:55.649> in<00:00:55.800> just<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> little<00:00:56.190> bit<00:00:56.610> in<00:00:56.730> the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
tuck it in just a little bit in the

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.340 
tuck it in just a little bit in the
front<00:00:57.090> because<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.510> sort<00:00:57.840> of<00:00:57.989> gives<00:00:58.230> a

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
front because that sort of gives a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.430 
front because that sort of gives a
little<00:00:58.559> more<00:00:59.660> balance<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:01.109> I'm<00:01:01.260> really

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
little more balance because I'm really

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.860 
little more balance because I'm really
petite<00:01:02.010> so<00:01:02.280> if<00:01:02.370> I<00:01:02.460> tuck<00:01:02.699> it<00:01:02.850> in<00:01:03.000> it<00:01:03.510> gives<00:01:03.719> the

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
petite so if I tuck it in it gives the

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:06.410 
petite so if I tuck it in it gives the
eye<00:01:03.899> a<00:01:04.019> little<00:01:04.260> bit<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:05.070> a<00:01:05.220> shorter<00:01:05.610> torso<00:01:05.820> and

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
eye a little bit of a shorter torso and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380 
eye a little bit of a shorter torso and
that<00:01:07.049> helps<00:01:07.320> T<00:01:07.470> elongate<00:01:07.920> the<00:01:08.070> legs<00:01:08.280> so<00:01:09.150> in<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
that helps T elongate the legs so in the

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.870 
that helps T elongate the legs so in the
back<00:01:09.570> I<00:01:09.750> just<00:01:09.780> have<00:01:10.200> it<00:01:10.439> down<00:01:11.070> so<00:01:11.460> when<00:01:11.610> I<00:01:11.640> wear

Nine<00:02:07.200> West<00:02:07.700> like<00:02:08.700> peep<00:02:09.000> toe<00:02:09.209> bootie

they're<00:02:11.420> platforms<00:02:11.960> that<00:02:12.080> they<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.350> give<00:02:12.530> me

they're platforms that they just give me
a<00:02:12.710> little<00:02:12.980> bit<00:02:13.100> more<00:02:13.340> height<00:02:13.580> so<00:02:14.510> I<00:02:14.870> guess

00:02:15.130 --> 00:02:15.140 
a little bit more height so I guess

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.400 
a little bit more height so I guess
that's<00:02:15.320> about<00:02:15.560> it<00:02:16.630> let<00:02:17.630> me<00:02:17.660> show<00:02:17.780> the<00:02:18.260> whole

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.740 

so<00:02:31.110> I<00:02:31.500> guess<00:02:31.800> that's<00:02:32.070> it<00:02:32.400> to<00:02:33.060> find<00:02:33.480> more

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
so I guess that's it to find more
