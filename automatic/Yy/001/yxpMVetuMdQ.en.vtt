durable as Kenickie is so you mori he

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.679

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
would have fucked her up so that was

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.740 
would have fucked her up so that was
actually<00:01:31.229> an<00:01:31.409> act<00:01:31.740> of<00:01:31.979> compassion<00:01:32.640> from<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
actually an act of compassion from the

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.929 
actually an act of compassion from the
brother<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.259> know<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:34.770> actually<00:01:34.979> kind<00:01:35.820> of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
brother you know that's actually kind of

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.780 
brother you know that's actually kind of
revealed<00:01:36.360> later<00:01:36.720> on<00:01:37.049> but<00:01:37.680> if<00:01:37.950> anime<00:01:38.520> is<00:01:38.579> not

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
revealed later on but if anime is not

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.069 
revealed later on but if anime is not
going<00:01:39.000> to<00:01:39.090> go<00:01:39.210> there<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:39.540> that's<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.810> slight

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
going to go there so that's a slight

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.050 
going to go there so that's a slight
spoiler<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:40.860> I<00:01:41.100> mean<00:01:41.340> many<00:01:41.579> people<00:01:41.640> can

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
spoiler but I mean many people can

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.670 
spoiler but I mean many people can
probably<00:01:42.240> already<00:01:42.630> guess<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.259> anyway

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
probably already guess that anyway
