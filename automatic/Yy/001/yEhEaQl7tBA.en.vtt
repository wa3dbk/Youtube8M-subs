that's really disappointing for me
really<00:01:51.240> I<00:01:51.600> really<00:01:51.899> thought<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.619> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
really I really thought that have this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:55.069 
really I really thought that have this
issue<00:01:53.299> solved<00:01:54.299> sooner<00:01:54.630> rather<00:01:54.780> than<00:01:55.020> later

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
issue solved sooner rather than later

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.370 
issue solved sooner rather than later
but<00:01:55.560> clearly<00:01:55.890> that's<00:01:56.159> not<00:01:56.369> the<00:01:56.490> case<00:01:56.640> and<00:01:57.380> yeah

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380 
but clearly that's not the case and yeah
