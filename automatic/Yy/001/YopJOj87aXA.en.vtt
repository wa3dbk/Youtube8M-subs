it's mostly I think it's just a round
sable<00:01:04.049> brush<00:01:04.290> so<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:05.460> pretty<00:01:06.060> good<00:01:06.360> at

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:08.750 
just covering large areas it's got a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.570 
just covering large areas it's got a
tapered<00:01:09.750> edge<00:01:09.900> so<00:01:10.530> it's<00:01:10.740> good<00:01:10.950> at<00:01:11.070> laying<00:01:11.310> out

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580
