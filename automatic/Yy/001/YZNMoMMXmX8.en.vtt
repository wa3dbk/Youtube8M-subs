and T X goes to our X on the data
signals<00:00:35.180> and<00:00:35.449> then<00:00:35.660> right<00:00:35.840> here<00:00:36.260> what<00:00:36.830> we've

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:36.980 
signals and then right here what we've

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:40.299 
signals and then right here what we've
got<00:00:37.220> is<00:00:37.430> there's<00:00:37.699> a<00:00:37.760> key<00:00:38.030> pin<00:00:38.360> on<00:00:38.660> the<00:00:38.840> hc-05<00:00:39.559> in

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:40.309 
got is there's a key pin on the hc-05 in

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:42.460 
got is there's a key pin on the hc-05 in
order<00:00:40.640> for<00:00:40.879> this<00:00:41.000> to<00:00:41.239> go<00:00:41.390> and<00:00:41.660> stay<00:00:41.930> into

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:42.470 
order for this to go and stay into

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.270 
order for this to go and stay into

that<00:00:44.089> key<00:00:44.390> pin<00:00:44.660> has<00:00:44.930> to<00:00:45.050> be<00:00:45.199> positive<00:00:45.739> so<00:00:45.949> we've

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:46.400 
that key pin has to be positive so we've

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.389 
that key pin has to be positive so we've
jumped<00:00:46.670> the<00:00:46.850> positive<00:00:47.360> but<00:00:47.719> a<00:00:47.780> power<00:00:48.770> terminal

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
jumped the positive but a power terminal

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.520 
jumped the positive but a power terminal
to<00:00:49.910> the<00:00:50.120> key<00:00:50.390> pin<00:00:50.690> and<00:00:50.930> we're<00:00:51.020> gonna<00:00:51.140> leave<00:00:51.350> it

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
to the key pin and we're gonna leave it

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.869 
to the key pin and we're gonna leave it
that<00:00:51.559> way<00:00:51.710> for<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.100> entire<00:00:52.219> programming

problems with that like it feels like

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.990 
problems with that like it feels like
it's<00:01:09.170> halfway<00:01:09.710> in<00:01:09.860> command<00:01:10.250> mode<00:01:10.430> it<00:01:10.610> responds

it's halfway in command mode it responds

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.150 
it's halfway in command mode it responds
to<00:01:11.180> some<00:01:11.390> 80<00:01:11.600> commands<00:01:12.110> but<00:01:12.320> not<00:01:12.560> others

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:13.160 
to some 80 commands but not others

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.790 
to some 80 commands but not others
chances<00:01:13.850> are<00:01:13.970> your<00:01:14.240> key<00:01:14.479> pin<00:01:14.780> has<00:01:15.050> come<00:01:15.320> undone

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:15.800 
chances are your key pin has come undone

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.139 
chances are your key pin has come undone
and<00:01:16.039> it<00:01:16.550> is<00:01:16.670> no<00:01:16.850> longer<00:01:17.090> positive<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.149> hardware

00:01:20.139 --> 00:01:20.149 
and it is no longer positive so hardware

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:21.249 
and it is no longer positive so hardware
wise<00:01:20.330> that's<00:01:20.569> the<00:01:20.690> only<00:01:20.869> thing<00:01:21.020> you<00:01:21.110> have<00:01:21.200> to

00:01:21.249 --> 00:01:21.259 
wise that's the only thing you have to

00:01:21.259 --> 00:01:23.830 
wise that's the only thing you have to
pay<00:01:21.440> attention<00:01:21.679> to<00:01:21.920> I've<00:01:22.880> also<00:01:23.119> seen<00:01:23.420> some<00:01:23.690> of

pay attention to I've also seen some of

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.570 
pay attention to I've also seen some of
these<00:01:23.929> Bluetooth<00:01:24.410> adapters<00:01:24.979> where<00:01:25.190> the<00:01:25.340> key

so<00:04:12.410> now<00:04:12.530> we've<00:04:12.709> got<00:04:12.830> the<00:04:12.950> Arduino<00:04:13.400> software

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
so now we've got the Arduino software

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.220 
so now we've got the Arduino software
open<00:04:14.180> we're<00:04:14.300> gonna<00:04:14.360> go<00:04:14.599> ahead<00:04:14.720> and<00:04:14.870> go<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.080> our

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:15.230 
open we're gonna go ahead and go to our

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:18.460 
open we're gonna go ahead and go to our
configuration<00:04:15.680> dot<00:04:16.250> H<00:04:16.489> file<00:04:17.290> and<00:04:18.290> we're<00:04:18.380> gonna

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470 
configuration dot H file and we're gonna

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.289 
configuration dot H file and we're gonna
check<00:04:18.769> and<00:04:18.799> make<00:04:19.070> sure<00:04:19.100> that<00:04:19.489> that<00:04:19.669> port<00:04:20.060> right

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
check and make sure that that port right

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:22.180 
check and make sure that that port right
there<00:04:20.329> that<00:04:20.780> bot<00:04:20.930> is<00:04:21.200> set<00:04:21.410> to<00:04:21.590> one<00:04:21.799> one<00:04:21.980> five

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
there that bot is set to one one five

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:25.450 
there that bot is set to one one five
200<00:04:22.660> the<00:04:23.660> same<00:04:23.900> as<00:04:24.050> our<00:04:24.200> hc-05<00:04:24.800> bluetooth

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
200 the same as our hc-05 bluetooth

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.610 
200 the same as our hc-05 bluetooth
module<00:04:26.080> we're<00:04:27.080> also<00:04:27.169> going<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.440> make<00:04:27.500> sure

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:27.620 
module we're also going to make sure

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.129

set or not not commented out so to speak

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:35.379 
set or not not commented out so to speak
now<00:04:34.430> you'll<00:04:34.639> need<00:04:34.760> to<00:04:34.820> go<00:04:35.000> ahead<00:04:35.120> and

00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
now you'll need to go ahead and

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.600 
now you'll need to go ahead and
recompile<00:04:35.990> and<00:04:36.200> reinstall<00:04:36.740> that<00:04:36.770> firmware<00:04:37.400> on

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:37.610 
recompile and reinstall that firmware on

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
not yet paired this to the computer so

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.469 
not yet paired this to the computer so
we're<00:04:53.009> gonna<00:04:53.099> hop<00:04:53.310> back<00:04:53.370> on<00:04:53.759> the<00:04:53.880> computer<00:04:54.030> now

00:04:54.469 --> 00:04:54.479 
we're gonna hop back on the computer now

00:04:54.479 --> 00:04:56.629 
we're gonna hop back on the computer now
that<00:04:54.660> we've<00:04:54.780> got<00:04:54.990> this<00:04:55.169> powered<00:04:55.530> up<00:04:55.680> and<00:04:55.889> we

00:04:56.629 --> 00:04:56.639

all<00:05:45.330> the<00:05:45.449> way<00:05:45.539> through<00:05:45.780> this<00:05:45.930> one<00:05:46.169> 1<00:05:46.380> 5<00:05:46.620> 200

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
all the way through this one 1 5 200

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.480 
all the way through this one 1 5 200
once<00:05:48.330> that<00:05:48.479> set<00:05:48.900> we<00:05:49.620> are<00:05:49.889> pretty<00:05:50.039> much<00:05:50.250> ready

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
once that set we are pretty much ready

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:53.689 
once that set we are pretty much ready
to<00:05:50.580> connect<00:05:51.000> the<00:05:51.090> IMP<00:05:51.300> Roger<00:05:51.509> base<00:05:52.580> so<00:05:53.580> we're

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
to connect the IMP Roger base so we're

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:57.970 
to connect the IMP Roger base so we're
going<00:05:53.789> to<00:05:53.849> go<00:05:54.030> ahead<00:05:54.090> and<00:05:54.270> open<00:05:54.330> that<00:05:54.539> up

00:05:57.970 --> 00:05:57.980 

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:00.670 

and<00:05:58.580> I'm<00:05:59.480> gonna<00:05:59.600> make<00:05:59.810> sure<00:05:59.840> when<00:06:00.230> we<00:06:00.350> open<00:06:00.590> it

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
and I'm gonna make sure when we open it

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.500
