00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.660
 so hello here is no display now 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.360
 Or should you rather have a little info 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.340
 video moderately because I wanted a bit 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:17.490
 tell about gamescom and that was 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:22.949
 I there on thursday and there was right 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.080
 i thought it was cool and cool 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:28.140
 that's why I'm not there again 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.050
 his and I wanted to stop so a bit 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:35.760
 tell how my impression was there and 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:38.219
 Although I thought it was cool that easy 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.510
 times all these measures to people 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:44.820
 they are really interested 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:47.460
 are at video games users and yes it 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.770
 It was already awesome and then we have 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.940
 I was there my sister we have 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:01:00.690
 Also so business cards distributed by tosca 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:01:03.840
 and so and yes he also hears 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:08.130
 probably as you drive 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.740
 probably nobody can hear me 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.960
 I'm sick but I do not know the day 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.799
 that somehow there was an air conditioning 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.759
 or so, but who cares? 

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:22.380
 are still vacation with me so therefore 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:25.110
 is already stupid I would rather not in 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.540
 the holidays and what i definitely 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.439
 I also wanted to tell ali 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.970
 that's not cool 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:35.490
 and that is so correct that the dare 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.100
 and he was so nice so the story 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.900
 It's funny and I think I bet 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.729
 that too as a video answer and a 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:48.090
 video I post just do not under 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:50.970
 which al ahli please look at the and 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:54.060
 It will make cool turn comment 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.530
 can or so with it by pn contact 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.540
 you can write to me you too can 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.759
 Remember that because I hope so 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:03.810
 Actually, because I am at thalia on the 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:06.869
 Club did not do that funny I found it 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:10.679
 funny as soon as hands wash and 

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:11.880
 then I asked you and recognized 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:14.890
 he like that 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.040
 possible but I think this is 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:19.900
 not the right place is already at 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.950
 correct of which we are still easy 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.150
 went out 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:27.940
 then he still has a bit 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:31.840
 short chat so because I have him 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:37.630
 what i said in the small so really 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.069
 no youtube channel and yes then have 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:41.410
 I always have such a card 

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.980
 given and then there was still a photo 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.319
 made 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:46.360
 I would like to fade in but will 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.930
 you see me and that's what I want 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 Not 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:55.720
 I just found quite cool from what 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:58.720
 He was very relaxed and so and I think 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.140
 really cool of him that he is so in principle 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:06.220
 he is just then more normal 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:08.320
 man and that was his truth too 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:12.700
 somehow become so clear with him and 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:15.460
 he was not a picture me so fast now 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:16.840
 afterwards others recognize me because 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.680
 then and we really have one more 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:22.150
 few others recognized him and yes was found 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.500
 but I quite coolly hear that he is so 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:27.130
 was actually loose 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:30.850
 and yes that's it 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:32.410
 almost gamescom me so i play 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:35.650
 actually always deeper and there I have 

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:39.520
 pro evolution soccer tested and mine 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 goodness that is a dirt he now I away 

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.420
 how to offend because I have 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.330
 said that's probably easy 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:50.440
 that one is used to the fifa control 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:52.930
 And that's why he never pro again 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:56.800
 evolution soccer and I thought so 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:59.440
 crass at battlefield I believe ballast 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.260
 but there was such a sign from here 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:04.180
 wait five hours 

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:07.330
 that is crass on thursday was to 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.030
 luck was not so much going on there 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.790
 it still though at nintendo i did 

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:15.040
 did not understand so correctly 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:17.739
 everything suddenly jammed and we 

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:20.230
 For a short time, there were just so many people 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:23.130
 there were and you are not in front of anything 

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:28.290
 Back more could a temple 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:32.740
 but okay and otherwise it was so cool 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:38.919
 and yes then we went up 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:44.940
 after dunkin donuts at the dom that he then 

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:44.940
 then thank this shopping street for food 

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:53.779
 and yes I found the whole thing really cool 

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:56.899
 atmosphere and so on and recommended 

00:04:53.779 --> 00:05:00.199
 in any case and I have met some 

00:04:56.899 --> 00:05:03.729
 is not that repeat 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.569
 So who that was it now 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:07.999
 Actually, I was just telling that 

00:05:05.569 --> 00:05:10.269
 have met each other and that the 

00:05:07.999 --> 00:05:12.889
 gamescom is cool and what do I have now 

00:05:10.269 --> 00:05:17.079
 and that's why he has a few ears 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:17.079
 stiff and see you next time
