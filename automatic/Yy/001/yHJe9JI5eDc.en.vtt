00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:22.350

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 of the battery and this part 2 here I go 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:29.429
 talk about something that a lot of people buy a 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:35.940
 tablet in addition to listening to music 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:37.110
 videos see book book magazine that is the 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:41.360
 great 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:45.680
 the great potential of this apparatus too 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:46.980
 Let's check who nuno samsung 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:54.739

 it comes with an icon and book explain in the 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:01.320
 book and features an interface interface 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:05.119
 is a very simple interface is a 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 shelf and booklets are all here 

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:10.470
 we have one that has already come with 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:16.290
 Wonderful white oz land will click 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:20.909
 You will be have the commands here 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.840
 top have to page control here 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:27.960
 down 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:30.380
 You can see we have an index here in 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.380
 baquba 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:44.710
 the content of it by clicking on the page already 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.710
 go straight for you 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:51.550
 we are here for example this option of 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:02:08.710
 pen that we applied the pen 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:02:08.710
 we checked any text had the same 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:24.380
 percentage of how much the book was read 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:03:03.970
 the size of the font size does not need 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:03:12.470
 increase very good and book 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:17.900
 if you have this application it 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:21.709
 is a very good simple application right 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.970
 what many people will not ask 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:32.720
 but pf 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:34.130
 the user manual which is a pdf that 

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.310
 came from him 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:40.100
 will click the ptf 

00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:43.880
 the pdf also presents the same 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.630
 up here you see the 

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:51.110
 same command down here too 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:53.680
 command and pages 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:58.310
 I just did not hit that percentage of 

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.020
 read or that index also but the 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:02.830
 high school with the screen here 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:02.830
 index 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.710
 do not come do not see who does not and does not have 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:18.230
 what has this indicates that is is a pdf 

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:19.130
 it is not a type to a file to the 

00:04:18.230 --> 00:04:21.799
 and book 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.920
 He serves the playbook but he does not have 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:27.830
 these resources that by the index 

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:33.380
 but his transition is also a 

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:37.070
 transition is not equal to the 

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:39.230
 and presents the book the size of the 

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:42.920
 source is good 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:46.730
 no you do not need to raise here and 

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:50.750
 increase after staying staying browsing 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:55.640
 by the text the size he and that he 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:58.010
 It's natural, it 's an ideal size for you. 

00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:01.280
 can read quietly 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:04.480
 I really liked this software something that 

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:07.480
 another on the xoom motorola not well and 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.480

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:19.280

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:24.070
