scratched<00:00:18.750> oh<00:00:18.990> and<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:20.580> got<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:20.880> open<00:00:21.119> trailer

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
scratched oh and I got the open trailer

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.099 
scratched oh and I got the open trailer
for<00:00:22.320> no<00:00:22.710> reason<00:00:23.130> whatsoever<00:00:23.689> which<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.869> open

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
for no reason whatsoever which the open

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.920 
for no reason whatsoever which the open
tray<00:00:25.260> is<00:00:25.410> where<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.369> laser<00:00:26.820> that<00:00:27.510> reads<00:00:27.779> the

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
tray is where the laser that reads the

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.400 
tray is where the laser that reads the
actual<00:00:28.410> game<00:00:28.439> does<00:00:29.070> not<00:00:29.099> reposition<00:00:30.000> itself

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
actual game does not reposition itself

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.709 
actual game does not reposition itself
so<00:00:31.410> that<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.740> can<00:00:31.859> actually<00:00:32.189> read<00:00:32.460> the<00:00:32.700> game<00:00:33.059> it

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
so that it can actually read the game it

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:35.930 
so that it can actually read the game it
just<00:00:33.960> says<00:00:34.170> open<00:00:34.350> tray<00:00:34.559> it<00:00:35.130> doesn't<00:00:35.460> detect<00:00:35.730> a
