00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
trouble jump off for an area to hide I

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.400 
trouble jump off for an area to hide I
would<00:01:09.880> recommend<00:01:10.180> just<00:01:10.570> protein<00:01:10.960> one<00:01:11.320> of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
would recommend just protein one of

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.530 
would recommend just protein one of
these<00:01:11.530> plants<00:01:12.070> like<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.520> just<00:01:13.000> hiding<00:01:13.450> it

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:13.540 
these plants like this just hiding it

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.150 
these plants like this just hiding it
especially<00:01:13.840> after<00:01:14.080> sniper<00:01:14.410> really<00:01:14.770> hard<00:01:15.010> for

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:15.160 
especially after sniper really hard for

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.950 
especially after sniper really hard for
them<00:01:15.310> to<00:01:15.340> find<00:01:15.970> you<00:01:16.330> because<00:01:16.450> it's<00:01:16.690> kind<00:01:16.840> of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960 
them to find you because it's kind of

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:19.280 
them to find you because it's kind of

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
acting you see how tourney that bridge

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.930 
acting you see how tourney that bridge
just<00:01:20.290> do<00:01:20.470> something<00:01:20.500> they<00:01:21.310> use<00:01:21.490> high<00:01:21.729> right
