00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello everyone today, I want you 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.509
 suggest a few more options for that 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.929
 how can you diversify your everyday 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.730
 image quickly and easily invite you also 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.160
 watch one of my previous videos 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:22.920
 where i showed three other quick and 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.780
 light hairstyles for every day for these 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.070
 hairstyles I'll use my invoices 

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.110
 strands on hairpins 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.699
 although for the first image they are in principle 

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:35.250
 not required i also slightly screwed up 

00:00:32.699 --> 00:00:36.989
 hair from the face basically these hairstyles 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.160
 can be done both on level and on 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.559
 curly hair 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.199
 for starters, I will move the hair on one 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.690
 side then I'll just separate the thin 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.289
 a strand of hair near the parting will braid it in 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.289
 thin pigtail 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:59.280
 this is some 

00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:02.370
 I will do an empty one to fasten a pigtail 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.270
 without using rubber I splash mine 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.510
 lacquer fingers 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.890
 and then I process the spit tip 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.560
 so fixed to me 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.630
 keeps the whole day of course rezinochki 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.190
 no one has canceled me personally this option 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.190
 seems more accurate 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:25.200
 after that I will separate another strand 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.200
 next to 1 and braid another pigtail 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.220
 but 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.380
 the outside 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.920
 pinning just as well first 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.390
 I spray my fingers on varnish and then 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.390
 I process the tip of kosei 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.610
 it is the turn to braid one another 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:03.800
 I have a thin pigtail today 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.930
 braids will be three on one side only 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.130
 well you can create as many braids 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.229
 as you want 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.280
 inspired me to this hairstyle 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.020
 singer nyusha 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:14.240
 on it you can often see different 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.930
 variants of such braids often with 

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.930
 woolly 

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:37.910
 and I really like this option like 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.730
 simple and tasteful 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.100
 loose hair is always beautiful but 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.990
 it is not always convenient therefore to heighten 

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.980
 comfort we can tie the hair in 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:48.230
 tail side 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.050
 but for greater glamor we can close 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.270
 gum hair strand as you see i 

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:54.950
 I wrapped with a strand of hair around the gum and 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:01.010
 then I tie it in a little bundle 

00:02:54.950 --> 00:03:03.170
 by itself after that I fix 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:05.720
 the tip of the invisible passing her in 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:07.650
 the middle like my hairstyle hold out 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.090
 all day 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.790
 and now we will be original 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:18.049
 take another gum and tie up our 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.049
 tail one more time 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:25.730
 and let's separate the strand in the center 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:28.610
 tail and hold it with one hand 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.850
 pull up the gum up we should 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:33.620
 get like a bubble of hair 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.220
 I will once again disguise gum strand 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.250
 hair 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.810
 another way to fasten this strand is 

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:40.190
 use a little rubber 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.380
 instead of invisible 

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:45.550
 she will get lost in her hair and will 

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.550
 completely unnoticed 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:02.070
 Tanchki Ren Tea 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.200
 if you wish, you can create another 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:13.290
 a bubble of hair that is, we repeat everything 

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:15.600
 steps re-tie the hair with a rubber band and 

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:24.350
 pull it up holding the strand 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:24.350
 hair in the center then mask the gum 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.560
 write me in the comments what 

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:48.380
