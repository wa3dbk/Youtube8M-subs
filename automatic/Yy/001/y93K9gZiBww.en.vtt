so<00:05:28.120> just<00:05:28.420> to<00:05:28.540> mention<00:05:28.660> once<00:05:29.140> again<00:05:29.470> when

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:29.710 
so just to mention once again when

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.290 
so just to mention once again when
you're<00:05:29.830> dyeing<00:05:30.100> your<00:05:30.280> hair<00:05:30.340> it's<00:05:30.970> very

00:05:31.290 --> 00:05:31.300 
you're dyeing your hair it's very

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.240 
you're dyeing your hair it's very
important<00:05:31.780> that<00:05:31.810> you<00:05:31.990> only<00:05:32.200> focus<00:05:32.710> your<00:05:33.040> hair

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:33.250 
important that you only focus your hair

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:35.970 
important that you only focus your hair
color<00:05:33.520> on<00:05:33.760> the<00:05:34.120> hair<00:05:34.360> itself<00:05:34.840> if<00:05:35.110> you<00:05:35.470> die<00:05:35.920> the

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:35.980 
color on the hair itself if you die the

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.940 
color on the hair itself if you die the
wet<00:05:36.310> it's<00:05:36.580> unnecessary<00:05:37.480> because<00:05:37.930> for<00:05:38.230> one<00:05:38.440> no

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:38.950 
wet it's unnecessary because for one no

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:40.290 
wet it's unnecessary because for one no
one<00:05:39.160> will<00:05:39.310> ever<00:05:39.490> see<00:05:39.790> the<00:05:39.880> weft<00:05:40.060> of<00:05:40.180> your

00:05:40.290 --> 00:05:40.300 
one will ever see the weft of your

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:41.880 
one will ever see the weft of your
extensions<00:05:40.690> so<00:05:40.930> they<00:05:41.140> don't<00:05:41.440> have<00:05:41.620> to<00:05:41.770> be

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:41.890 
extensions so they don't have to be

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:43.950 
extensions so they don't have to be
colored<00:05:42.310> and<00:05:42.520> the<00:05:43.060> second<00:05:43.480> reason<00:05:43.600> is<00:05:43.900> because

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
colored and the second reason is because

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.140 
colored and the second reason is because
as<00:05:44.440> you're<00:05:44.710> rinsing<00:05:44.890> the<00:05:45.190> dye<00:05:45.400> out<00:05:45.580> you<00:05:46.000> will

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:46.150 
as you're rinsing the dye out you will

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:48.300 
as you're rinsing the dye out you will
constantly<00:05:46.450> have<00:05:46.990> the<00:05:47.170> reruns<00:05:47.680> we<00:05:47.980> watch

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:48.310 
constantly have the reruns we watch

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.760 
constantly have the reruns we watch
reruns<00:05:48.730> the<00:05:49.120> actual<00:05:49.870> weft<00:05:50.110> when<00:05:50.620> it's

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:50.770 
reruns the actual weft when it's

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.630 
reruns the actual weft when it's
unnecessary

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:51.640 
unnecessary

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:54.930 
unnecessary
so<00:05:52.540> also<00:05:52.960> I'm<00:05:53.530> actually<00:05:54.010> wearing<00:05:54.520> mrs.

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940
