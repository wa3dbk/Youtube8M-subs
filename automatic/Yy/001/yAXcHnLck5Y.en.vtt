00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:03.410
 we have 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.190
 on the way 

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:23.619
 that's exactly the same third of the gas look 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.539
 ok but remember one thing you 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.640
 started to fight you went update 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:29.650
 where 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:31.420
 in no case if you translate 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.230
 fight the other way by no means 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:37.630
 not that this pressure does not subside 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.559
 that is, all transitions are made as follows 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.870
 way we pray more and more all 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.480
 more to break with went y'know i'm all 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:50.340
 time I press down then once passed I rode 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.340
 all time long losing don't let go 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:59.110
 alexey on the internet you read it 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.270
 something said vegan meat is 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.520
 times somehow well on exhibiting them not 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.089
 affects turnover positively affects 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:06.750
 establishment 

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:10.750
 why is it so objectively craved 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:13.990
 protein is in doubt this is an axiom 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.430
 animal and any will be so product 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:19.000
 the breakdown of the protein that we do not know before 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:21.880
 amino acids amino acids it's like one 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.160
 part of the year is small and 

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:29.700
 depending on protein there 12 there america 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.700
 10 8 different but always always 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.640
 transport is urea ammonia 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.759
 timol various toxic toxic gases 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.970
 and food for not symbiote on microflora 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:45.390
 that is, I say microflora which 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:47.940
 cause from one we go to 150 seeds 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.070
 looking for microflora yes here is to read coal 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.310
 Basically I am talking and after waiting for academy 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:56.850
 google x a90 translate years and prolific 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:59.009
 power he and he studied permafrost we give 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.640
 even tried it 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:06.050
 let's say microflora as a separate 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:08.450
 this is the enemies bring out two and a half she 

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:10.429
 should normally have seen but when we have 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.950
 whom developed eyes had weighs 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.200
 approximately how much a kilogram of the body 

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.720
 then synthesize the types of hormones 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.910
 amino acid hormone is smart 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:24.170
 chemical machine that allows us 

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:26.900
 be healthy and happy i'm such 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.120
 for myself personally, I am a family, for example, scania 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.569
 I just experimented constantly eating 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.180
 one meat will begin to milk sat on 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:37.760
 cocktails all that I just did not do 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.269
 most effectively I began to speak 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.600
 run and I say so there is 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.230
 exercise merchants and 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.410
 lunges today 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.100
 that is, got up and with a barbell 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.780
 brodilochka 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:56.160
 the mercy of the guru of the moment that buzova so 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:58.350
 what is ready here when you eat meat and gone 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.600
 220 kilograms but I was added 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.120
 amino acids creatine minerals because 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.090
 that we really lacked energy 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.890
 stopped eating meat and the guys eat j320 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:11.830
 amino acid-free vitamins 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:15.280
 nothing and generally just fed 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.340
 salads are very easy I will throw in general 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:20.340
 stomach hurts forgotten 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:27.800
 at first I can scare a little tree 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:31.760
 then stopped and what can do 

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:34.800
 boiled defense account 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.310
 Well, you know well in the winter of course 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.560
 have to 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:42.000
 as a fool will come food that is, he 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:44.310
 decorated holiday on through the question asked 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.500
 well, summer, summer, guys, we actually 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.540
 eat the planet sit down fresh fruit and 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:51.420
 vegetables before being raw food yeah try 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.400
 I just promote the exercise guys 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.370
 if you try you might like it 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.340
 I liked it together I believe that 

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.930
 there is this effect 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:01.690
 pancakes from the side 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.030
 at my home 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.940
 I have a bunch of guys for four years 65 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:11.110
 he is you up to 20 on 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:12.850
 on the bench perhaps a spring there is also a 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:16.420
 becoming like say yes say 

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:19.060
 meat is given and before recovery as 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:22.230
 sports is medicine to meat more 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:26.260
 look now let's explain objectively 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:29.830
 probably at dawn compare this page 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:32.620
 the food system of the predator herbivore and 

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.750
 we are more like us through 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.240
 she grind you still on us and 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.600
 Bags as if to burst once they are up 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.080
 haircut what's all that we have different 

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.120
 climate 

00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:46.860
 that is, we have a different stomach 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:46.860
 herbivores he there start to hear 

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.430
 here 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.740
 we usually own the stomach yes 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:59.260
 so we are not herbivores and not fruit 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.330
 so the carnivorous fetus 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:07.690
 that's just that's very high 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:10.600
 energy value of the product but i'm not 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.360
 lost a single gram of that without which 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.790
 without paying from which a lot of it is not 

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:16.870
 lose oil and you are slaves and there was a table 

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:18.490
 one 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:20.650
 man you know as what you say 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:22.630
 what about functionality and blouse 52 

00:05:20.650 --> 00:05:26.440
 kilograms everything looks so scary 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:30.000
 gasp for 40 seconds hook 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.000
 cannot be placed in the same 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.130
 a place where he is now less than seven 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:37.780
 that passed that feeling when you are young 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.680
 for probably make sense here 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.449
 but 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.729
 offend because there is no need to help parking 

00:05:41.449 --> 00:05:45.410
 but with age the older you get 

00:05:43.729 --> 00:05:47.479
 need the more and careful blew 

00:05:45.410 --> 00:05:49.130
 treat those who consciously take 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.990
 Well, you understand this choice. 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.000
 to keep track of all these things 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:54.080
 need to have a normal education or 

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.729
 very good coach 

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:58.669
 because health experiments 

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.760
 yasaka them it deals with offense 

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.890
 the most brilliant education 

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.690
 at random nothing but an effect on 

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.770
 caliper please use let's 

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.770
 lunch anyway we have
