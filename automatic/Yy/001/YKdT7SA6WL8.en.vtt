00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:12.360
 as soon as the warm season arrives 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.980
 I immediately start thinking about picnic 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 in the open air and I already see myself with him 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.790
 friends in a meadow shelling their leaves e 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.860
 eating pecorino but not always the time 

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.230
 on our side and I'm not just talking about 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.000
 weather I see friends much more often 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.529
 in the evening for dinner but I thought anyway 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.880
 to enclose all the perfumes of the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.860
 snacks in the open area in small 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.599
 cartocci to cook in the oven and open 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.219
 directly into the dish we 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.219
 intrigued we prepare the whole 

00:00:52.870 --> 00:01:00.190
 to prepare these papers I will have 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:05.210
 need pine pepper salt mint pepper 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.400
 sifted ricotta lemon pecorino oil 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.450
 extra virgin olive oil and broad beans that 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.450
 I go to shell immediately 

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.220
 fresh broad beans like the ones I have 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:23.020
 found at the market today are a lot 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:24.370
 keep you can eat from raw 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:26.260
 without the need to remove the skin 

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.630
 but if yours were not enough 

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:31.590
 you can boil them for a minute and then 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.590
 skin them like this 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:55.380
 the beans are all shelled now I can 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.330
 switch over to the pecorino more 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:59.700
 classic for beans would be with the 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:01.140
 pecorino romano but it is too hard one 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.990
 consistency that would not merge has 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.760
 done inside our cartridges then I have 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.110
 chosen a Tuscan maturing pecorino 

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.100
 media that has just the consistency 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.100
 right this 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:33.349
 to the ricotta I go to add the pine nuts 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:43.579
 and prepare a pesto for ricotta 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:45.470
 in the mouth of the mixer then pinoli complains 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.939
 I don't use all the leaves I keep 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.939
 some aside to decorate 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:54.380
 now a nice grated lemon 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.610
 use half of the rind the other half 

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.610
 I will put at the last oil 

00:03:02.819 --> 00:03:06.810
 a nice pinch of salt 

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:17.260
 we can blend 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.659
 here is the piece that will be the basis of 

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.659
 our cartocci 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:49.459
 I just have to start doing i 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:53.330
 cartoccio I place a pesto ricotta pony 

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:59.330
 in the center of the cartoccio and spread it a 

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.870
 a bit like that and then system the beans a little 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.870
 spread 

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.290
 I do the same thing with pecorino 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.660
 filling the little holes that remained 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:22.510
 free so I would say that it can suffice e 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:24.070
 grated lemon time yes a little 

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:34.480
 speech to give perfume and color 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:36.750
 the final touch complains and 

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.750
 back 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.560
 that I turn off when to close i 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:42.560
 cartocci 

00:04:58.529 --> 00:05:02.539
 first is ready I continue with all the 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:02.539
 others 

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.920
 the beans are really a legume 

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.600
 incredible and its properties 

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:12.730
 nutritional have been known for a long time 

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.980
 ancient so that the Romans who were 

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.140
 admirers even had an agent 

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.880
 who he had taken the name from the beans 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.320
 actually the Romans even if we are 

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:22.450
 always used to imagining them 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:24.100
 engaged in Lucullian dinners they had 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.110
 an almost vegetarian diet and 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:28.210
 very frugal and there were many of them a 

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:30.070
 take their name from legumes 

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:32.650
 who preferred to eat or cultivate 

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:39.640
 such as the slow lentil lida 

00:05:32.650 --> 00:05:42.730
 or the ciceros from the classes here the last I can 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.440
 put them in the oven for 15 minutes at 180 degrees but 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.210
 if you prefer to prepare in a barbecue 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.950
 with friends you can wrap the cream of 

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:49.780
 ricotta cheese and beans inside 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.800
 of aluminum foil from almost the 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.800
 directly on the barbecue 

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.480
 here they are our baked parcels 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.160
 ready but to taste them we will have to 

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:20.110
 wait to be boards to have them in 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.110
 flat but I can't resist 

00:06:32.479 --> 00:06:35.570
 enjoy your meal
