00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
possible to grade your patterns in Adobe

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.110 
possible to grade your patterns in Adobe
Illustrator<00:00:12.920> now<00:00:13.920> this<00:00:14.130> tutorial<00:00:14.549> is<00:00:14.610> not<00:00:14.790> how

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
Illustrator now this tutorial is not how

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.630 
Illustrator now this tutorial is not how
to<00:00:15.179> grade<00:00:15.680> this<00:00:16.680> is<00:00:16.920> for<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.250> people<00:00:17.400> that

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
to grade this is for the people that

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.689 
to grade this is for the people that
already<00:00:17.789> know<00:00:17.940> how<00:00:18.420> to<00:00:18.480> grade<00:00:18.869> their<00:00:19.080> patterns

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:19.699 
already know how to grade their patterns

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.700 
already know how to grade their patterns
and<00:00:20.699> you<00:00:20.910> don't<00:00:21.119> have<00:00:21.300> a<00:00:21.600> program<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.109> Gerber

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
and you don't have a program like Gerber

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.380 
and you don't have a program like Gerber
and<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.189> want<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.460> use<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.760> computer<00:00:24.119> so

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and you want to use the computer so

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.000 
and you want to use the computer so
you'll<00:00:25.050> want<00:00:25.289> to<00:00:25.350> trace<00:00:25.619> your<00:00:25.800> block

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
you'll want to trace your block

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.880 
you'll want to trace your block
obviously<00:00:26.609> into<00:00:27.150> Adobe<00:00:28.109> Illustrator<00:00:28.560> and

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
obviously into Adobe Illustrator and

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.220 
obviously into Adobe Illustrator and
what<00:00:29.010> I'm<00:00:29.130> doing<00:00:29.160> here<00:00:29.580> is<00:00:29.640> I'm<00:00:29.820> copying<00:00:30.630> the

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
what I'm doing here is I'm copying the

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.319 
what I'm doing here is I'm copying the
anchor<00:00:31.710> point<00:00:32.040> and<00:00:32.309> changing<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.850> color<00:00:33.059> so

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
anchor point and changing the color so

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.660 
anchor point and changing the color so
you<00:00:33.390> guys<00:00:33.510> can<00:00:33.719> see<00:00:33.899> what<00:00:33.960> I'm<00:00:34.050> doing<00:00:34.430> and<00:00:35.430> then

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
you guys can see what I'm doing and then

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.150 
you guys can see what I'm doing and then
I'm<00:00:35.760> pressing<00:00:36.120> command<00:00:36.300> shift<00:00:36.780> M<00:00:37.050> so<00:00:37.829> I<00:00:37.860> can

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
I'm pressing command shift M so I can

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.750 
I'm pressing command shift M so I can
move<00:00:38.340> that<00:00:38.640> anchor<00:00:38.969> point<00:00:42.469> so<00:00:43.760> horizontal

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
move that anchor point so horizontal

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.540 
move that anchor point so horizontal
will<00:00:45.300> be<00:00:45.510> X<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.020> vertical<00:00:46.649> would<00:00:46.860> be<00:00:47.010> Y<00:00:47.219> and

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
will be X and vertical would be Y and

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.180 
will be X and vertical would be Y and
you<00:00:48.450> use<00:00:48.719> the<00:00:48.870> same<00:00:49.020> principles<00:00:49.469> like<00:00:49.680> if<00:00:49.860> you

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
you use the same principles like if you

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.970 
you use the same principles like if you
had<00:00:50.340> to<00:00:50.399> go<00:00:50.489> down<00:00:50.700> you<00:00:50.940> -<00:00:51.690> that<00:00:52.559> I'm<00:00:52.710> doing<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
had to go down you - that I'm doing the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.099 
had to go down you - that I'm doing the
same<00:00:53.160> thing<00:00:53.399> for<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:55.070> dart<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.340> then<00:00:57.329> all<00:00:57.660> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
same thing for the dart and then all and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:00:59.959 
same thing for the dart and then all and
then<00:00:58.590> just<00:00:58.829> put<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.370> know<00:00:59.399> the

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
then just put in you know the

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.599 
then just put in you know the
coordinates<00:01:00.420> I<00:01:00.739> try<00:01:01.739> to<00:01:01.800> make<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.129> Tarou<00:01:02.399> as

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
coordinates I try to make this Tarou as

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:04.520 
coordinates I try to make this Tarou as
short<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:02.940> possible<00:01:03.390> just<00:01:03.420> because<00:01:04.170> it's<00:01:04.320> kind

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
short as possible just because it's kind

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.070 
short as possible just because it's kind
of<00:01:04.589> repetitive

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.080 
of repetitive

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.200 
of repetitive
again<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.260> shoulder<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:08.640> do<00:01:08.820> that<00:01:09.000> to<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
again the shoulder you do that to the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.830 
again the shoulder you do that to the
shoulder<00:01:09.630> and<00:01:09.659> then<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.409> the<00:01:11.420> to<00:01:12.420> the<00:01:12.570> arm

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
shoulder and then to the to the arm

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.810 
shoulder and then to the to the arm
knotch<00:01:13.320> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:13.890> the<00:01:14.100> side<00:01:14.340> seam<00:01:14.640> and

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
knotch and then the side seam and

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.670 
knotch and then the side seam and
armhole<00:01:16.939> so<00:01:17.939> right<00:01:18.299> now<00:01:18.420> I'm<00:01:18.750> just<00:01:19.049> deleting

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
armhole so right now I'm just deleting

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.499 
armhole so right now I'm just deleting
the<00:01:19.799> markings<00:01:20.580> that<00:01:20.670> shouldn't<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.060> there<00:01:21.240> and

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
the markings that shouldn't be there and

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:28.160 
the markings that shouldn't be there and
just<00:01:21.570> retracing<00:01:22.439> it<00:01:24.680> and<00:01:26.780> then<00:01:27.780> what<00:01:27.930> I<00:01:27.960> did

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
just retracing it and then what I did

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:30.499 
just retracing it and then what I did
with<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> French<00:01:28.770> curve<00:01:29.040> that<00:01:29.310> I<00:01:29.549> scanned

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
with the French curve that I scanned

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.410 
with the French curve that I scanned
into<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.840> computer<00:01:30.900> and<00:01:31.610> went<00:01:32.610> to<00:01:32.729> Adobe

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
into the computer and went to Adobe

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.780 
into the computer and went to Adobe
Illustrator<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.869> trace<00:01:34.170> around<00:01:34.350> it<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.460> and

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
Illustrator and trace around it so and

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.700 
Illustrator and trace around it so and
then<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:35.909> positioned<00:01:36.479> it<00:01:36.630> on<00:01:36.840> the<00:01:37.140> armhole<00:01:37.530> and

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
then I positioned it on the armhole and

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
then I positioned it on the armhole and
all<00:01:38.040> I'm<00:01:38.159> just<00:01:38.189> doing<00:01:38.670> is<00:01:38.820> copying<00:01:39.090> those

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
all I'm just doing is copying those

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.760 
all I'm just doing is copying those
anchor<00:01:39.810> points<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.409> I<00:01:40.439> need<00:01:41.540> and<00:01:42.540> I<00:01:43.439> move<00:01:43.649> the

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
anchor points that I need and I move the

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.410 
anchor points that I need and I move the
ink<00:01:43.950> of<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.460> French<00:01:44.820> crop<00:01:45.000> out<00:01:45.149> of<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> way

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
ink of the French crop out of the way

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.450 
ink of the French crop out of the way
and<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> paste<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.740> in<00:01:46.860> front<00:01:47.159> using<00:01:48.060> command<00:01:48.390> F

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
and I paste it in front using command F

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.539 
and I paste it in front using command F
and<00:01:51.170> then<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.439> just<00:01:52.710> doing<00:01:53.040> here<00:01:53.189> is<00:01:53.280> cleaning

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
and then on just doing here is cleaning

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.819 
and then on just doing here is cleaning
up<00:01:53.729> those<00:01:53.939> lines<00:01:54.180> and<00:01:54.600> connecting<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.619> to<00:01:55.680> the

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
up those lines and connecting it to the

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:04.639 
up those lines and connecting it to the
rest<00:01:56.100> of<00:01:56.250> the<00:01:56.340> bodice<00:02:00.020> and<00:02:03.409> when<00:02:04.409> you're<00:02:04.560> doing

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
rest of the bodice and when you're doing

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.020 
rest of the bodice and when you're doing
this<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.070> will<00:02:05.130> probably<00:02:05.280> have<00:02:05.579> some<00:02:05.610> anchor

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
this you will probably have some anchor

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.570 
this you will probably have some anchor
points<00:02:06.590> that<00:02:07.590> are<00:02:07.710> not<00:02:07.829> aligned<00:02:08.280> correctly

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
points that are not aligned correctly

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:11.210 
points that are not aligned correctly
and<00:02:09.000> you<00:02:09.090> have<00:02:09.270> these<00:02:09.420> weird<00:02:09.929> jagged<00:02:10.619> edges<00:02:10.800> so

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
and you have these weird jagged edges so

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:27.170 
and you have these weird jagged edges so
you<00:02:11.250> need<00:02:11.550> to<00:02:11.640> fix<00:02:11.790> that

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.569 

so<00:02:27.750> here's<00:02:28.379> the<00:02:28.590> same<00:02:28.739> thing<00:02:28.799> you<00:02:29.280> would<00:02:29.430> do

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:29.579 
so here's the same thing you would do
