00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
a second all right let's see if we can

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:39.440 
a second all right let's see if we can
find<00:00:23.640> that<00:00:23.820> nugget<00:00:24.210> with<00:00:24.300> that<00:00:24.449> ATX<00:00:38.210> back<00:00:39.210> down

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
find that nugget with that ATX back down

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.420 
find that nugget with that ATX back down
let's<00:00:40.440> write<00:00:40.649> down<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.860> little<00:00:41.070> bit<00:00:41.250> lower

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
let's write down a little bit lower

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
let's write down a little bit lower
right<00:00:41.670> in<00:00:41.820> there<00:00:45.860> okay<00:00:46.860> the<00:00:47.010> GPX<00:00:47.460> 4000<00:00:48.270> picked

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
right in there okay the GPX 4000 picked

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.069 
right in there okay the GPX 4000 picked
that<00:00:48.570> up<00:00:48.629> no<00:00:48.960> problem<00:00:49.640> the<00:00:50.640> ATX<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.750> picking

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
that up no problem the ATX is picking

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.590 
that up no problem the ATX is picking
that<00:00:52.110> up<00:00:52.260> with<00:00:52.590> no<00:00:52.739> problem

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:53.600 
that up with no problem

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.299 
that up with no problem
so<00:00:54.600> Bearcat<00:00:55.110> dig<00:00:55.379> that<00:00:55.559> piece<00:00:55.739> of<00:00:55.920> gold<00:00:56.100> out<00:00:56.250> of

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
so Bearcat dig that piece of gold out of

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:03.529 
so Bearcat dig that piece of gold out of
there<00:00:59.120> it's<00:01:00.120> gold<00:01:00.510> tin<00:01:01.350> or<00:01:01.770> a<00:01:01.829> BB<00:01:02.329> so<00:01:03.329> both

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
there it's gold tin or a BB so both

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.690 
there it's gold tin or a BB so both
machines<00:01:03.840> got<00:01:04.110> it<00:01:04.260> yeah<00:01:05.720> actually<00:01:06.950> the<00:01:07.950> ATX<00:01:08.430> I

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
machines got it yeah actually the ATX I

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.120 
machines got it yeah actually the ATX I
think<00:01:09.260> it's<00:01:10.260> picking<00:01:10.619> it<00:01:10.710> up<00:01:10.799> a<00:01:10.920> little

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
think it's picking it up a little

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.990 
think it's picking it up a little
stronger<00:01:11.430> oh<00:01:13.159> but<00:01:14.159> I<00:01:14.189> don't<00:01:14.310> know<00:01:14.520> how<00:01:14.640> you<00:01:14.729> got

edit<00:02:54.910> this<00:02:55.000> out<00:02:55.180> you<00:02:55.810> gotta<00:02:56.020> dig<00:02:56.230> faster<00:02:56.650> than

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
edit this out you gotta dig faster than

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:57.990 
edit this out you gotta dig faster than
that<00:02:56.890> you<00:02:57.250> got<00:02:57.370> to<00:02:57.490> get<00:02:57.610> on<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.880> the<00:02:57.940> next

that you got to get on to the next
target<00:02:58.360> I<00:02:59.340> thought<00:03:00.340> that<00:03:00.520> ad<00:03:00.850> expose<00:03:01.270> pinpoint

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
target I thought that ad expose pinpoint

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.040 
target I thought that ad expose pinpoint
within<00:03:02.140> two<00:03:02.320> inches<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:04.540> think<00:03:04.630> I'm<00:03:04.900> the

problem here is in the hole there I'll

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:25.310 
problem here is in the hole there I'll
throw<00:03:19.990> it<00:03:20.050> back<00:03:20.170> in<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.350> hole<00:03:21.000> like<00:03:22.000> a<00:03:22.060> retard

00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:49.330 
with my 4000 the Garrett ATX picked it

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.550 
with my 4000 the Garrett ATX picked it
up<00:05:49.450> just<00:05:49.840> as<00:05:50.020> good

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
up just as good

now<00:05:56.140> there<00:05:56.530> was<00:05:56.680> a<00:05:56.740> couple<00:05:57.310> of<00:05:57.490> targets<00:05:57.670> that

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.030 
now there was a couple of targets that

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:01.050 
now there was a couple of targets that
obviously<00:05:58.540> the<00:05:58.750> GP<00:05:59.170> the<00:05:59.620> 4000<00:06:00.370> did<00:06:00.490> excel<00:06:00.850> in

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060 
obviously the GP the 4000 did excel in

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.170 
obviously the GP the 4000 did excel in
but<00:06:01.950> I'm<00:06:02.950> having<00:06:03.220> to<00:06:03.460> think<00:06:03.610> if<00:06:03.820> there's<00:06:04.030> any

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:04.180 
but I'm having to think if there's any

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:06.660 
but I'm having to think if there's any
gold<00:06:04.450> within<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.900> top<00:06:05.680> of<00:06:05.830> the<00:06:05.920> ground<00:06:06.130> to<00:06:06.430> about

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:06.670 
gold within a top of the ground to about

00:06:06.670 --> 00:06:10.710 
gold within a top of the ground to about
six<00:06:07.210> seven<00:06:07.630> eight<00:06:07.750> inches<00:06:08.790> I<00:06:09.790> don't<00:06:10.420> think<00:06:10.630> you

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:10.720 
six seven eight inches I don't think you

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:12.540 
six seven eight inches I don't think you
can<00:06:10.870> beat<00:06:11.020> the<00:06:11.140> ATX<00:06:11.650> because<00:06:12.040> it<00:06:12.190> picked<00:06:12.400> up

00:06:12.540 --> 00:06:12.550 
can beat the ATX because it picked up

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.420 
can beat the ATX because it picked up
everything<00:06:13.060> the<00:06:13.180> four<00:06:13.360> thousand<00:06:14.220> picked<00:06:15.220> up

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:15.430 
everything the four thousand picked up

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:17.430
