that<00:02:16.379> end<00:02:16.739> of<00:02:17.250> spring<00:02:17.580> we<00:02:17.910> will<00:02:18.150> have<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.930> high

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
that end of spring we will have the high

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.070 
that end of spring we will have the high
steel<00:02:19.530> co<00:02:19.800> so<00:02:20.220> I'm<00:02:21.000> assuming<00:02:21.180> that's<00:02:21.629> coming

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
steel co so I'm assuming that's coming

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.570 
steel co so I'm assuming that's coming
in<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.349> know<00:02:22.379> early<00:02:22.830> June<00:02:23.069> or<00:02:23.190> something<00:02:23.489> like

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
in you know early June or something like

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.369 
in you know early June or something like
that<00:02:23.640> which<00:02:23.940> is<00:02:24.150> considered<00:02:24.690> end<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:24.989> spring<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.369 --> 00:02:25.379 
that which is considered end of spring I

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:27.140 
that which is considered end of spring I
guess<00:02:25.620> I'm<00:02:25.860> not<00:02:25.890> you<00:02:26.250> know<00:02:26.280> not<00:02:26.370> technically

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:27.150 
guess I'm not you know not technically

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.690 
guess I'm not you know not technically
but<00:02:27.390> you<00:02:28.230> know<00:02:28.349> I<00:02:28.379> guess<00:02:28.709> that's<00:02:29.099> when<00:02:29.400> they're

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
but you know I guess that's when they're

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.059 
but you know I guess that's when they're
going<00:02:29.819> to<00:02:29.879> say<00:02:30.090> it<00:02:30.180> is<00:02:30.299> so<00:02:30.510> hopefully<00:02:31.379> that

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
going to say it is so hopefully that

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.520 
going to say it is so hopefully that
will<00:02:32.220> be<00:02:32.370> 1.14<00:02:33.269> and<00:02:33.540> you<00:02:33.810> know<00:02:33.900> the<00:02:34.049> guns<00:02:34.260> will

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
will be 1.14 and you know the guns will

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:35.630 
will be 1.14 and you know the guns will

think<00:02:58.680> it<00:02:58.799> might<00:02:59.040> be<00:02:59.099> that<00:02:59.340> maybe<00:02:59.610> you<00:03:00.269> know

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
think it might be that maybe you know

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.300 
think it might be that maybe you know

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:02.310 
toss up an image of that but you know we

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:04.280 
toss up an image of that but you know we
shall<00:03:02.519> see<00:03:02.730> we're<00:03:03.360> not<00:03:03.450> exactly<00:03:03.599> sure<00:03:03.900> yet<00:03:04.079> but

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
shall see we're not exactly sure yet but

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.750 
shall see we're not exactly sure yet but
i<00:03:04.410> really<00:03:04.739> am<00:03:04.829> hoping<00:03:05.010> the<00:03:05.250> pistol<00:03:05.610> looks

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:05.760 
i really am hoping the pistol looks

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.210 
i really am hoping the pistol looks
really<00:03:06.269> cool<00:03:06.480> on<00:03:06.840> that<00:03:07.349> should<00:03:07.650> be<00:03:07.739> awesome

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
really cool on that should be awesome

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.270 
really cool on that should be awesome
you<00:03:09.180> know<00:03:09.269> i<00:03:09.299> think<00:03:09.450> i<00:03:09.810> think<00:03:09.870> GTA<00:03:10.650> 5<00:03:10.829> does<00:03:11.099> need

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
you know i think i think GTA 5 does need

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:12.650 
you know i think i think GTA 5 does need
to<00:03:11.370> like<00:03:11.670> a<00:03:11.700> better<00:03:11.970> variety<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.510> weapons

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
to like a better variety of weapons

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:13.940 
to like a better variety of weapons
because<00:03:13.019> it<00:03:13.140> is<00:03:13.230> kind<00:03:13.410> of<00:03:13.470> a<00:03:13.530> third<00:03:13.709> person

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
because it is kind of a third person

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.069 
because it is kind of a third person
point<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.430> shoot<00:03:14.579> game<00:03:14.819> so<00:03:15.090> if<00:03:15.780> they<00:03:15.900> could

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:16.079 
point and shoot game so if they could

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:17.660 
point and shoot game so if they could
add<00:03:16.230> some<00:03:16.260> better<00:03:16.590> better<00:03:17.069> variety<00:03:17.579> that

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
add some better better variety that

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.759 
add some better better variety that
