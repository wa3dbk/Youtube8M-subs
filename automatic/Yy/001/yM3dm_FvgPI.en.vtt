00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
track today I didn't particularly enjoy

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.559 
track today I didn't particularly enjoy
it<00:03:02.190> as<00:03:02.280> much<00:03:02.310> as<00:03:02.459> yesterday<00:03:02.670> it<00:03:03.030> was<00:03:03.120> a<00:03:03.150> it<00:03:03.510> was

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
it as much as yesterday it was a it was

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:05.330 
it as much as yesterday it was a it was
a<00:03:03.660> lot<00:03:03.840> closer<00:03:04.140> in<00:03:04.349> terms<00:03:04.680> of<00:03:04.859> lap<00:03:05.040> times

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
a lot closer in terms of lap times

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:07.039 
a lot closer in terms of lap times
because<00:03:05.730> because<00:03:06.209> of<00:03:06.329> the<00:03:06.420> nature<00:03:06.599> was<00:03:06.840> more

00:03:07.039 --> 00:03:07.049 
because because of the nature was more

00:03:07.049 --> 00:03:08.479 
because because of the nature was more
stop-start<00:03:07.620> there<00:03:07.769> weren't<00:03:07.920> so<00:03:08.099> many<00:03:08.129> places

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
stop-start there weren't so many places

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.910 
stop-start there weren't so many places
where<00:03:08.819> you<00:03:08.940> could<00:03:09.120> sort<00:03:09.959> of<00:03:10.079> pick<00:03:10.230> up<00:03:10.349> a<00:03:10.470> bit

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
where you could sort of pick up a bit

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.180 
where you could sort of pick up a bit
more<00:03:11.040> time<00:03:11.310> so<00:03:11.780> yeah<00:03:12.780> you<00:03:13.109> know<00:03:13.230> Keith<00:03:13.799> farmer

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:54.140 
of i have been ever since Crale trying
to<00:03:52.980> think<00:03:53.160> about<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.459> championship<00:03:53.790> quite<00:03:54.120> a

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
to think about the championship quite a

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.180 
to think about the championship quite a
lot<00:03:54.389> in<00:03:54.540> that<00:03:54.630> race<00:03:55.290> when<00:03:55.530> when<00:03:55.829> I<00:03:55.859> was<00:03:56.040> racing

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
lot in that race when when I was racing

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:57.440 
lot in that race when when I was racing
with<00:03:56.370> Keith<00:03:56.609> obviously<00:03:57.000> I<00:03:57.060> was<00:03:57.180> trying<00:03:57.389> to

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450 
with Keith obviously I was trying to

00:03:57.450 --> 00:03:58.909 
with Keith obviously I was trying to
think<00:03:57.569> okay<00:03:57.989> think<00:03:58.169> about<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.620> chairmanship

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:58.919 
think okay think about the chairmanship

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:01.190 
think okay think about the chairmanship
of<00:03:59.099> it<00:03:59.220> if<00:03:59.880> you<00:03:59.970> can<00:04:00.120> pass<00:04:00.269> him<00:04:00.480> back<00:04:00.660> pass<00:04:01.019> him

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
of it if you can pass him back pass him

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.650 
of it if you can pass him back pass him
back<00:04:01.349> but<00:04:01.470> you<00:04:01.560> don't<00:04:01.709> need<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:01.919> sort<00:04:02.340> of<00:04:02.400> thing

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
back but you don't need to sort of thing

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.030 
back but you don't need to sort of thing
so<00:04:03.660> I've<00:04:03.989> sort<00:04:04.379> of<00:04:04.440> got<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.680> on<00:04:04.799> the<00:04:04.859> back<00:04:05.010> of
