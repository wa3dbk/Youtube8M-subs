always<00:02:12.540> caught<00:02:12.780> T<00:02:12.990> right<00:02:13.170> there

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.479 

see<00:02:20.100> if<00:02:20.220> you<00:02:20.340> can

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
see if you can

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.610 
see if you can
favor<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.329> bluegill<00:02:22.750> the<00:02:22.989> goldfish<00:02:23.349> are<00:02:23.500> easy

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:23.620 
favor the bluegill the goldfish are easy

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.110 
favor the bluegill the goldfish are easy
to<00:02:23.769> catch<00:02:23.950> but<00:02:24.220> she<00:02:24.340> doesn't<00:02:24.610> like<00:02:24.700> him<00:02:24.879> I

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
to catch but she doesn't like him I

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.970 
to catch but she doesn't like him I
guess<00:02:25.930> they<00:02:26.049> don't<00:02:26.140> taste<00:02:26.379> very<00:02:26.590> good

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
guess they don't taste very good

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.220 
guess they don't taste very good
so<00:02:27.819> she<00:02:27.909> usually<00:02:28.120> goes<00:02:28.540> for<00:02:28.780> the<00:02:28.870> bluegill

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
so she usually goes for the bluegill

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.979 
so she usually goes for the bluegill
she'd<00:02:29.650> rather<00:02:29.769> catch<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.250> bluegill<00:02:30.780> so<00:02:31.780> she'll

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
she'd rather catch a bluegill so she'll

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:36.589 
she'd rather catch a bluegill so she'll

pass up tons of goldfish before
even<00:02:37.230> though<00:02:37.349> they're<00:02:37.530> easier<00:02:37.829> Oh<00:02:38.010> oh<00:02:38.459> that

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:40.579 
was close

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:43.720 
was close
it's<00:02:41.579> a<00:02:41.730> good<00:02:41.939> practice<00:02:42.450> for<00:02:42.480> her<00:02:42.870> she<00:02:43.109> gets

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
it's a good practice for her she gets

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.349 
it's a good practice for her she gets
good<00:02:44.780> practice<00:02:45.780> maneuvering<00:02:46.500> and<00:02:47.359> chasing

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:48.359 
good practice maneuvering and chasing

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:53.809 
good practice maneuvering and chasing
following<00:02:49.170> fish<00:02:50.150> so<00:02:51.150> that<00:02:51.209> eventually<00:02:52.819> can

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819 
following fish so that eventually can

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:59.760 
following fish so that eventually can

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.070 

right<00:03:00.400> now<00:03:00.580> she's<00:03:00.850> only<00:03:01.000> she's<00:03:01.390> 12<00:03:01.690> weeks<00:03:01.870> old

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:02.080

well<00:03:02.380> almost<00:03:02.560> 12<00:03:03.070> she's<00:03:03.340> she'll<00:03:04.090> be<00:03:04.180> 12<00:03:04.420> weeks

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:04.450 
well almost 12 she's she'll be 12 weeks

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.600 
well almost 12 she's she'll be 12 weeks
old<00:03:04.750> in<00:03:04.930> two<00:03:05.050> days<00:03:05.260> so<00:03:05.590> she<00:03:05.650> just<00:03:05.980> shy<00:03:06.190> of<00:03:06.220> 12

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
old in two days so she just shy of 12

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:10.650 
old in two days so she just shy of 12
weeks<00:03:06.850> so<00:03:08.400> she's<00:03:09.400> still<00:03:09.700> growing<00:03:10.450> still

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
weeks so she's still growing still

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.590 
weeks so she's still growing still
developing<00:03:11.260> she's<00:03:11.500> not<00:03:11.680> quite<00:03:12.520> as<00:03:12.700> fast<00:03:13.120> as<00:03:13.390> an

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
developing she's not quite as fast as an

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.390 
developing she's not quite as fast as an
adult<00:03:14.110> link<00:03:14.410> would<00:03:14.620> be<00:03:16.740> but<00:03:17.740> this<00:03:17.890> helps<00:03:18.250> her

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
adult link would be but this helps her

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:24.360 
adult link would be but this helps her
development<00:03:19.090> as<00:03:19.360> she<00:03:20.260> practices

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.190 

because<00:03:24.910> as<00:03:25.090> you<00:03:25.209> can<00:03:25.239> imagine<00:03:25.450> wild<00:03:26.019> fish

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
because as you can imagine wild fish

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.690 
because as you can imagine wild fish
would<00:03:26.349> be<00:03:26.379> a<00:03:26.470> lot<00:03:26.680> harder<00:03:26.920> because<00:03:27.220> they<00:03:27.519> can

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
would be a lot harder because they can

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.119 
would be a lot harder because they can
get<00:03:27.819> away<00:03:27.879> these<00:03:28.420> fish<00:03:28.660> are<00:03:28.810> kind<00:03:28.959> of<00:03:29.129> trapped

00:03:30.119 --> 00:03:30.129
