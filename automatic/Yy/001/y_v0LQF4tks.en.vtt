00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 
risky so check that out but for examples

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:22.999 
risky so check that out but for examples

your result which is what $100 you know

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.999 
your result which is what $100 you know

what sort of percentages are you going

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:59.959 
what sort of percentages are you going
to<00:01:53.100> need<00:01:54.560> well<00:01:55.640> to<00:01:56.640> make<00:01:56.820> $100<00:01:57.810> using<00:01:58.579> $100<00:01:59.579> you

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
to need well to make $100 using $100 you

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.249 
to need well to make $100 using $100 you
need<00:02:00.119> to<00:02:00.240> what<00:02:00.420> you<00:02:00.570> need<00:02:00.719> to<00:02:00.810> double<00:02:01.140> your

money or in other words you need a

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.709 
money or in other words you need a
hundred<00:02:03.210> percent<00:02:03.329> game<00:02:05.210> so<00:02:06.210> hopefully<00:02:06.509> write

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
hundred percent game so hopefully write

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.240 
hundred percent game so hopefully write
that<00:02:06.899> in<00:02:07.020> there<00:02:07.110> you're<00:02:07.290> thinking<00:02:07.619> well<00:02:07.860> you

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
that in there you're thinking well you

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.790 
that in there you're thinking well you
know<00:02:08.369> if<00:02:08.580> I<00:02:08.729> want<00:02:08.940> to<00:02:09.000> make<00:02:09.090> $100<00:02:09.810> a<00:02:09.840> day<00:02:09.929> and<00:02:10.709> I

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
know if I want to make $100 a day and I

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.580 
know if I want to make $100 a day and I
only<00:02:10.950> have<00:02:11.160> $100<00:02:12.020> I'm<00:02:13.020> gonna<00:02:13.200> have<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.440> be

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
only have $100 I'm gonna have to be

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.080 
only have $100 I'm gonna have to be
basically<00:02:13.830> the<00:02:14.010> best<00:02:14.310> stock<00:02:14.550> trader<00:02:14.819> ever

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:15.090 
basically the best stock trader ever

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.510 
basically the best stock trader ever
known<00:02:15.330> to<00:02:15.480> mankind<00:02:15.660> if<00:02:16.410> I'm<00:02:16.739> gonna<00:02:16.860> go<00:02:17.129> and<00:02:17.370> get

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
known to mankind if I'm gonna go and get

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:19.339 
known to mankind if I'm gonna go and get
a<00:02:17.580> hundred<00:02:17.849> percent<00:02:18.000> gains<00:02:18.420> every<00:02:18.900> single<00:02:19.170> day

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
a hundred percent gains every single day

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:22.160 
a hundred percent gains every single day
so<00:02:20.160> right<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.640> you<00:02:21.480> know<00:02:21.569> using<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.989> hundred

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170 
so right there you know using a hundred

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.920 
so right there you know using a hundred
dollars<00:02:22.620> and<00:02:22.860> needing<00:02:23.640> a<00:02:23.940> hundred<00:02:24.420> percent<00:02:24.540> to

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
dollars and needing a hundred percent to

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.070 
dollars and needing a hundred percent to
make<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.319> hundred<00:02:25.590> dollars<00:02:25.770> you<00:02:26.580> know<00:02:26.670> that's

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
make a hundred dollars you know that's

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.720 
make a hundred dollars you know that's
probably<00:02:28.080> you're<00:02:28.830> seeing<00:02:29.129> the<00:02:29.220> problem<00:02:29.610> with

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
probably you're seeing the problem with

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
probably you're seeing the problem with
that<00:02:29.879> but<00:02:30.360> let's<00:02:30.510> say<00:02:30.660> you<00:02:30.720> know<00:02:30.900> what<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.110> got<00:02:31.410> a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
that but let's say you know what I got a

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.350 
that but let's say you know what I got a
thousand<00:02:32.040> dollars<00:02:32.989> and<00:02:34.730> again<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:36.060> want<00:02:36.180> to

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
thousand dollars and again you want to

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.600 
thousand dollars and again you want to
try<00:02:36.569> to<00:02:36.660> make<00:02:36.870> a<00:02:36.900> hundred<00:02:37.110> dollars<00:02:37.519> so<00:02:38.519> the

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
try to make a hundred dollars so the

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.910 
try to make a hundred dollars so the
question<00:02:38.910> becomes<00:02:39.150> what<00:02:40.140> percentage<00:02:40.680> do<00:02:40.860> I

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:40.920 
question becomes what percentage do I

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:42.650 
question becomes what percentage do I
need<00:02:41.099> to<00:02:41.220> make<00:02:41.400> on<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.760> thousand<00:02:42.209> dollars<00:02:42.480> in

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
need to make on this thousand dollars in

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.630 
need to make on this thousand dollars in
order<00:02:42.900> to<00:02:43.019> make<00:02:43.200> a<00:02:43.230> hundred<00:02:43.620> dollars<00:02:43.920> well<00:02:44.519> in

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
order to make a hundred dollars well in

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.000 
order to make a hundred dollars well in
this<00:02:44.760> case<00:02:47.959> now<00:02:48.959> you<00:02:49.019> only<00:02:49.230> need<00:02:49.349> ten<00:02:49.590> percent

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
this case now you only need ten percent

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.910 
this case now you only need ten percent
so<00:02:50.879> by<00:02:51.030> having<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.569> higher<00:02:51.780> amount<00:02:51.989> you<00:02:52.709> need

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
so by having a higher amount you need

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.070 
so by having a higher amount you need
less<00:02:53.160> percent<00:02:53.879> in<00:02:54.090> order<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.450> make<00:02:54.629> that<00:02:54.810> same

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:55.080 
less percent in order to make that same

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.800 
less percent in order to make that same
amount<00:02:55.410> so<00:02:56.069> okay<00:02:56.400> but<00:02:56.430> still<00:02:56.819> you<00:02:57.000> know<00:02:57.120> one

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
amount so okay but still you know one

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.660 
amount so okay but still you know one
hundred<00:02:58.050> dollars<00:02:58.379> a<00:02:58.409> day<00:02:58.500> using<00:02:58.920> a<00:02:59.159> thousand

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
hundred dollars a day using a thousand

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.369 
hundred dollars a day using a thousand
you<00:03:00.209> know<00:03:00.239> ten<00:03:00.480> percent<00:03:00.840> well<00:03:01.019> I'm<00:03:01.110> not<00:03:01.230> gonna

00:03:01.369 --> 00:03:01.379 
you know ten percent well I'm not gonna

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.470 
you know ten percent well I'm not gonna
call<00:03:01.620> this<00:03:01.800> impossible<00:03:02.550> and<00:03:02.790> it's<00:03:03.150> certainly

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
call this impossible and it's certainly

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:05.149 
call this impossible and it's certainly
much<00:03:03.659> more<00:03:03.870> realistic<00:03:04.230> than<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:04.709> option<00:03:05.069> up

00:03:05.149 --> 00:03:05.159 
much more realistic than this option up

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:06.440 
much more realistic than this option up
here<00:03:05.220> at<00:03:05.459> a<00:03:05.519> hundred<00:03:05.700> percent<00:03:05.849> I<00:03:06.150> mean<00:03:06.180> that's

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
here at a hundred percent I mean that's

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.380 
here at a hundred percent I mean that's
just<00:03:06.690> as<00:03:07.580> I'm<00:03:08.580> gonna<00:03:08.760> use<00:03:08.909> it<00:03:09.030> that's

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:09.390 
just as I'm gonna use it that's

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.670 
just as I'm gonna use it that's
impossible<00:03:09.690> nobody's<00:03:10.200> gonna<00:03:10.290> make<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> hundred

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
impossible nobody's gonna make a hundred

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.920 
impossible nobody's gonna make a hundred
percent<00:03:11.040> every<00:03:11.190> single<00:03:11.550> day<00:03:11.700> but<00:03:12.450> ten<00:03:12.629> percent

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
percent every single day but ten percent

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:14.089 
percent every single day but ten percent
okay<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.349> a<00:03:13.440> little<00:03:13.590> bit<00:03:13.680> more<00:03:13.830> realistic

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
okay it's a little bit more realistic

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.040 
okay it's a little bit more realistic
but<00:03:14.909> what<00:03:15.000> happens<00:03:15.330> if<00:03:15.510> you're<00:03:15.629> sitting<00:03:15.840> and

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
but what happens if you're sitting and

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.270 
but what happens if you're sitting and
saying<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.319> know<00:03:16.409> I<00:03:16.440> have<00:03:16.650> ten<00:03:16.830> thousand

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
saying you know I have ten thousand

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:22.490 
saying you know I have ten thousand
dollars<00:03:19.250> and<00:03:20.599> again<00:03:21.599> we<00:03:21.810> want<00:03:21.959> the<00:03:22.140> end<00:03:22.290> result

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
dollars and again we want the end result

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:28.670 
dollars and again we want the end result
to<00:03:22.769> be<00:03:23.330> 100<00:03:24.330> well<00:03:25.319> in<00:03:25.500> this<00:03:25.650> case<00:03:27.440> you<00:03:28.440> need<00:03:28.590> to

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
to be 100 well in this case you need to

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.559 
to be 100 well in this case you need to
make<00:03:28.830> one<00:03:28.980> percent<00:03:29.400> per<00:03:29.549> day<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.390> make<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:30.569 
make one percent per day to make a

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:34.130 
make one percent per day to make a
hundred<00:03:30.750> dollars<00:03:31.129> now<00:03:32.129> to<00:03:32.190> me<00:03:32.519> this<00:03:32.730> is<00:03:33.150> very

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
hundred dollars now to me this is very

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.610 
hundred dollars now to me this is very
realistic<00:03:34.830> but<00:03:35.819> the<00:03:36.090> key<00:03:36.420> thing<00:03:36.690> here<00:03:36.720> is<00:03:37.140> what

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:37.620 
realistic but the key thing here is what

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:40.820 
realistic but the key thing here is what
the<00:03:38.099> amount<00:03:38.430> so<00:03:39.299> everything<00:03:39.900> is<00:03:40.080> dictated<00:03:40.799> by

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:40.830 
the amount so everything is dictated by

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.580 
the amount so everything is dictated by
the<00:03:41.010> amount<00:03:41.940> and<00:03:42.180> then<00:03:42.930> how<00:03:43.049> much<00:03:43.200> you<00:03:43.319> want<00:03:43.500> to

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
the amount and then how much you want to

that's<00:05:25.620> going<00:05:25.740> to<00:05:25.800> tell<00:05:25.980> you<00:05:26.190> what<00:05:26.730> you<00:05:26.790> need

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:26.910 
that's going to tell you what you need

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:29.570 
that's going to tell you what you need
so<00:05:27.060> if<00:05:27.180> you're<00:05:27.330> using<00:05:27.570> you<00:05:28.500> know<00:05:28.590> $200<00:05:29.370> well

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:29.580 
so if you're using you know $200 well

00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.580 
so if you're using you know $200 well
you<00:05:29.760> know<00:05:29.880> you<00:05:29.940> still<00:05:30.270> would<00:05:30.450> need<00:05:30.600> 50%<00:05:31.290> return

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
you know you still would need 50% return

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:34.159 
you know you still would need 50% return
to<00:05:32.250> get<00:05:32.430> that<00:05:32.640> hundred<00:05:33.030> dollars<00:05:33.360> so<00:05:33.990> that's

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:34.169 
to get that hundred dollars so that's

00:05:34.169 --> 00:05:37.520 
to get that hundred dollars so that's
still<00:05:34.440> pretty<00:05:34.680> rough<00:05:34.980> but<00:05:36.200> look<00:05:37.200> at<00:05:37.290> it<00:05:37.410> like

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:37.530 
still pretty rough but look at it like

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:39.470 
still pretty rough but look at it like
this<00:05:37.710> for<00:05:38.250> every<00:05:38.550> hundred<00:05:38.669> dollars<00:05:38.880> you<00:05:39.270> have

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
this for every hundred dollars you have

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:43.070 
this for every hundred dollars you have
it<00:05:40.080> gets<00:05:40.440> that<00:05:40.770> much<00:05:41.010> easier<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.760> make<00:05:42.080> $100

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080 
it gets that much easier to make $100

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.020 
it gets that much easier to make $100
that's<00:05:43.560> the<00:05:43.770> best<00:05:43.979> way<00:05:44.160> I<00:05:44.190> kind<00:05:44.490> of<00:05:44.610> can<00:05:44.910> look

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:45.030 
that's the best way I kind of can look

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:47.000 
that's the best way I kind of can look
at<00:05:45.150> it<00:05:45.240> again<00:05:45.450> I'll<00:05:45.570> repeat<00:05:45.810> it<00:05:45.870> for<00:05:46.110> every

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:47.010 
at it again I'll repeat it for every

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:49.610 
at it again I'll repeat it for every
$100<00:05:47.910> you<00:05:48.030> have<00:05:48.060> so<00:05:48.479> the<00:05:48.600> more<00:05:48.780> $100<00:05:49.470> you<00:05:49.590> have

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
$100 you have so the more $100 you have

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:53.930 
$100 you have so the more $100 you have
it<00:05:50.460> becomes<00:05:50.820> easier<00:05:51.300> to<00:05:51.510> make<00:05:52.040> $100<00:05:53.040> so<00:05:53.729> keep

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:53.940 
it becomes easier to make $100 so keep

00:05:53.940 --> 00:05:56.930 
it becomes easier to make $100 so keep
this<00:05:54.090> in<00:05:54.150> mind<00:05:54.450> and<00:05:55.320> as<00:05:56.070> you<00:05:56.370> try<00:05:56.700> to<00:05:56.729> figure

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
this in mind and as you try to figure

00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.100 
this in mind and as you try to figure
out<00:05:57.150> you<00:05:57.240> know<00:05:57.270> well<00:05:57.540> how<00:05:57.720> much<00:05:57.780> do<00:05:57.990> I<00:05:58.050> need

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
out you know well how much do I need

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.230 
out you know well how much do I need
well<00:05:58.620> it<00:05:59.400> all<00:05:59.520> boils<00:05:59.700> down<00:05:59.910> to<00:06:00.030> these

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
well it all boils down to these

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.120 
well it all boils down to these
questions<00:06:00.690> look<00:06:01.260> at<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.440> math<00:06:01.650> here

00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:02.130 
questions look at the math here

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.830 
questions look at the math here
think<00:06:02.490> about<00:06:02.669> the<00:06:02.820> percentages<00:06:03.300> and<00:06:03.360> just<00:06:03.660> ask

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:03.840 
think about the percentages and just ask

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:05.690 
think about the percentages and just ask
yourself<00:06:04.169> well<00:06:04.860> what<00:06:05.010> percentage<00:06:05.220> would<00:06:05.669> I

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
yourself well what percentage would I

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.060 
yourself well what percentage would I
need<00:06:05.910> to<00:06:06.090> make<00:06:06.270> $100<00:06:07.020> and<00:06:07.229> that'll<00:06:07.800> kind<00:06:08.010> of

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.070 
need to make $100 and that'll kind of

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.980 
need to make $100 and that'll kind of
put<00:06:08.250> you<00:06:08.370> on<00:06:08.490> the<00:06:08.580> path<00:06:08.790> to<00:06:08.820> where<00:06:09.630> you<00:06:09.720> want<00:06:09.900> to
