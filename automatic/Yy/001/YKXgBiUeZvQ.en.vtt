power button up there you get your

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:33.890 
power button up there you get your
proprietary<00:04:29.850> port<00:04:30.060> there<00:04:30.300> for<00:04:31.850> that<00:04:32.850> dock<00:04:33.120> so

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
proprietary port there for that dock so

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.090

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
let's power this on and see if it's got

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.630 
let's power this on and see if it's got
any<00:04:35.340> juice<00:04:35.870> comes<00:04:36.870> with<00:04:37.020> Android<00:04:37.680> 5.0

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:38.640 
any juice comes with Android 5.0

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.589 
any juice comes with Android 5.0
lollipop<00:04:39.270> out<00:04:39.720> of<00:04:39.780> the<00:04:39.930> box

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 

00:04:45.599 --> 00:05:00.189 

we'll<00:04:46.599> see<00:04:46.810> if<00:04:46.960> it's<00:04:47.199> upgradable<00:04:48.189> a<00:04:48.250> 5.1

00:05:00.189 --> 00:05:00.199 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.589 

Intel<00:05:01.189> Inside<00:05:01.780> this<00:05:02.780> is<00:05:02.930> my<00:05:03.080> first<00:05:03.349> time

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
Intel Inside this is my first time

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.999 
Intel Inside this is my first time
owning<00:05:05.599> an<00:05:05.719> Android<00:05:06.139> tablet<00:05:06.349> that<00:05:06.710> has<00:05:06.860> an

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
owning an Android tablet that has an

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:10.119 
owning an Android tablet that has an
Intel<00:05:07.340> processor<00:05:07.490> so<00:05:08.800> we'll<00:05:09.800> see<00:05:09.949> how<00:05:10.069> that

00:05:10.119 --> 00:05:10.129 
Intel processor so we'll see how that

00:05:10.129 --> 00:05:17.469 
Intel processor so we'll see how that
goes<00:05:14.349> in<00:05:15.349> the<00:05:15.469> past<00:05:15.680> I've<00:05:15.889> kind<00:05:16.099> of<00:05:16.479> steered

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
goes in the past I've kind of steered

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:18.700 
goes in the past I've kind of steered
away<00:05:17.569> from<00:05:17.810> that<00:05:17.960> especially<00:05:18.409> the<00:05:18.499> ones<00:05:18.650> with

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
away from that especially the ones with

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:25.600 
away from that especially the ones with
the<00:05:18.860> atom<00:05:19.159> name<00:05:20.770> but<00:05:21.770> I<00:05:24.099> guess<00:05:25.099> atoms<00:05:25.430> aren't

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:25.610 
the atom name but I guess atoms aren't

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:27.700 
the atom name but I guess atoms aren't
what<00:05:25.699> they<00:05:25.759> used<00:05:25.819> to<00:05:26.060> be<00:05:26.439> this<00:05:27.439> should<00:05:27.620> have

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:27.710 
what they used to be this should have

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.640 
what they used to be this should have
just<00:05:27.860> changed<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.219> names<00:05:28.400> so<00:05:28.639> we<00:05:28.729> got<00:05:28.849> welcome

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
just changed the names so we got welcome

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:33.999 
just changed the names so we got welcome
next<00:05:30.650> I<00:05:32.169> speak<00:05:33.169> English<00:05:33.379> cuz<00:05:33.740> I'm<00:05:33.830> from

00:05:33.999 --> 00:05:34.009 
next I speak English cuz I'm from

00:05:34.009 --> 00:05:40.420 
next I speak English cuz I'm from
America<00:05:35.529> skip<00:05:36.529> all<00:05:36.710> these<00:05:38.919> turn<00:05:39.919> that<00:05:40.039> off<00:05:40.189> I

00:05:40.420 --> 00:05:40.430 
America skip all these turn that off I

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.260 
America skip all these turn that off I
guess<00:05:40.610> if<00:05:40.729> I<00:05:40.819> have<00:05:41.029> to<00:05:42.009> just<00:05:43.009> the<00:05:43.159> second

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:46.270 

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:50.810 

so<00:05:47.270> next
