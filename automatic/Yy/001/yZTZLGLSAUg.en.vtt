00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:20.050
My love has gone away,

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.050
quietly after a hundred days.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.050
This is what's she has always said she won't
stay

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:41.030
For more than what she can repay.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:47.030
I can still hear her say,

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:55.070
There that I'm not hearing tender play

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:02.070
The day she let me kiss her was a display,

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:10.070
Of love to those who she betray

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.020
How can I put someone to the test,

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.029
When I thought I got the best?

00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:23.040
Until the taste of bitterness then I regret,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.049
But still that I won't detest,

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.060
The love I can't forget,

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:34.849
Like someone who has left.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:39.049
How can I leave someone for the rest,

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.049
When I'm facing the best?

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:48.039
Until the taste of treachery then I regret.

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:51.839
But still that I won't detest,

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:56.039
Who I can never forget,

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.039
Like someone I once met.

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:06.039
How can I leave someone for the rest,

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.039
when I'm facing the best?

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:16.039
Until the taste of treachery then I regret.

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:20.049
But still that I won't detest,

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.049
who I can never forget,

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.000
like someone I once met.
