00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.120 
but I if I don't get at least six maybe
seven<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.540> next<00:01:09.869> day<00:01:10.020> I<00:01:10.049> really<00:01:10.500> do<00:01:10.680> feel<00:01:10.920> it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
seven the next day I really do feel it

seven the next day I really do feel it
and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.790> believe<00:01:12.090> that's<00:01:12.330> a<00:01:12.630> contributed<00:01:13.439> to<00:01:13.590> my

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
and I believe that's a contributed to my

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.120 
and I believe that's a contributed to my
age<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.520> my<00:01:14.580> aging<00:01:15.299> so<00:01:16.140> it's<00:01:16.500> not<00:01:16.650> only<00:01:16.710> the

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
age and my aging so it's not only the

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.370 
age and my aging so it's not only the
food<00:01:17.490> thing<00:01:17.790> because<00:01:18.270> I've<00:01:18.720> overcome<00:01:19.170> those

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
food thing because I've overcome those

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.170 
food thing because I've overcome those
barriers<00:01:19.439> and<00:01:20.100> I'm<00:01:20.189> eating<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.580> raw<00:01:20.759> vegan<00:01:20.790> diet

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
barriers and I'm eating a raw vegan diet

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.899 
barriers and I'm eating a raw vegan diet
and<00:01:21.509> feel<00:01:21.689> amazing<00:01:22.170> about<00:01:22.229> that<00:01:22.460> but<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
and feel amazing about that but the

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.130 
and feel amazing about that but the
sleep<00:01:24.180> is<00:01:24.450> something<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.869> lot<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> people

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:54.440 
advanced but when you're sleep deprived
immediately<00:01:51.780> you'll<00:01:52.079> know<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.470> and<00:01:53.060> now<00:01:54.060> hit

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
immediately you'll know it and now hit

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.090 
immediately you'll know it and now hit
so<00:01:54.750> that's<00:01:54.930> a<00:01:55.049> great<00:01:55.290> thing<00:01:55.530> that's<00:01:55.770> a<00:01:55.860> great

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
so that's a great thing that's a great

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.510 
so that's a great thing that's a great
part<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> sleep<00:01:57.149> deprivation<00:01:57.619> vs<00:01:58.619> vs

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
part of sleep deprivation vs vs

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.010 
part of sleep deprivation vs vs
something<00:01:59.820> like<00:02:00.000> cancer<00:02:00.270> or<00:02:00.450> something<00:02:00.719> else

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
something like cancer or something else

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.920 
something like cancer or something else
now<00:02:01.680> here's<00:02:02.009> the<00:02:02.159> downside<00:02:02.670> of<00:02:02.909> it<00:02:03.090> instead<00:02:03.869> of

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
now here's the downside of it instead of

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.420 
now here's the downside of it instead of
people<00:02:04.350> getting<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.710> important<00:02:05.130> rest<00:02:05.310> that

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
people getting that important rest that

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:07.429 
people getting that important rest that
they<00:02:05.549> need<00:02:05.759> what<00:02:05.969> do<00:02:06.030> they<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.180> they<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:07.170> some

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
they need what do they do they take some

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.339 
they need what do they do they take some
kind<00:02:07.649> of<00:02:07.710> stimulant<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.310> stay<00:02:08.550> awake<00:02:08.849> and<00:02:09.349> that

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
kind of stimulant to stay awake and that

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:12.470 
kind of stimulant to stay awake and that
creates<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.129> false<00:02:11.370> sense<00:02:11.700> of<00:02:11.849> energy<00:02:12.060> or<00:02:12.330> a

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
creates a false sense of energy or a

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.370 
creates a false sense of energy or a
full<00:02:12.780> sense<00:02:13.050> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
full sense that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.830 
full sense that
