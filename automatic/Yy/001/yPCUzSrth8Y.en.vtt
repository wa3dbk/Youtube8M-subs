00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.410
 all and welcome to a long time again ninth 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.410
 expensive on the canal since the attacks 

00:00:08.159 --> 00:00:12.899
 at Video Tutorial I'll deal with it as I the SPD her 

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:14.259
 Construction Buy take 

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:17.259
 and 11 but did not use and stayed first 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.710
 So I'm on the device all year round too 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:24.689
 and you do that so far with the APA 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.390
 Pascal recorder 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.819
 the termination 

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.509
 and this app when I show for the first time how violence came 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.249
 and then to use 

00:00:33.249 --> 00:00:34.670
 to use them 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.670
 old goes as usual in the tests the Astor 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:41.760
 even there 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.260
 as always with each Georg the Dolder wait the loading time very briefly but 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.170
 That should be very fast then 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:55.580
 so far at least that he plans so you see I have that search now already 

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.230
 once entered 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.550
 the source from which he connects that I will still in the EstÃ¡dio description 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:03.030
 recognize 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:06.450
 that is a cracked version that is called 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.369
 used here 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.369
 pc users test and buy right to the right one 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:14.870
 as far as I'm here now with the abducted ruler I have that 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.930
 but I'll have you all convinced 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:20.920
 accordingly will increase 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.440
 BZ but what a long time 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.920
 Ada 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.540
 you take 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.140
 I had no other source but the goal is first to relevant here uses 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.670
 if it could be of this then it will be very close to another of 3 6 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:39.040
 Meters hardly come 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.040
 do not you go as usual up there to install stretches 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.690
 Installed the whole here would have to make a Riesling 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.990
 so then always go 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.350
 Now I can not afford Alber 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.690
 the recorder is now fixed you have it there now 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.610
 and there had the opportunity agreed from there the ramming 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.560
 To start video 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.020
 or because she downloads the first time the EKD is chosen 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.019
 we always have to call now 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:14.059
 to be a few things instead of you here 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.849
 then, for example, it becomes 

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:21.249
 No no, I have no example for now 

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.469
 one moment 

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:25.959
 for example here 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.589
 more actions I'm assuming it's not complete screen 

00:02:31.219 --> 00:02:34.219
 complicated and where occupied 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:38.349
 For example, the painting was the starting signal 

00:02:39.139 --> 00:02:41.109
 is close to occupied 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:42.339
 this one 

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:45.289
 the SB settings are called 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:48.329
 or the task begins she can pull close 

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:53.619
 which is not right right now 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:56.979
 so it is not the European election I could now with me 

00:02:56.979 --> 00:03:00.169
 a simple click for example usb-stick in Bernbiet on it too 

00:03:00.169 --> 00:03:01.839
 to mark this down 

00:03:01.839 --> 00:03:05.129
 assigned and I could bet with them 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.839
 finally you have ready again 

00:03:07.839 --> 00:03:11.109
 but also detectives older I will probably already have a separate 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.889
 Enter video 

00:03:12.889 --> 00:03:15.460
 but now to the settings 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.499
 with regard to the Galliker or 

00:03:18.499 --> 00:03:21.170
 So here goes into the settings and has now 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.200
 under the normal Wiesdorf mail contacts and safari park now a new one 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.580
 Symbol namely the DisplayWeek Order he advises so far simply 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.709
 and then have the setting here, for example, the frame rate that are the 

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:38.709
 Images that are lost per second are already made 

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:41.780
 Percent the lower the more 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.040
 So less pictures he travels he has the impression that video poker the more Esther 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.460
 fluently, of course 

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:49.559
 One sources of error world 

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:50.959
 Block b red 

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.619
 I would leave out first 

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:57.409
 because the last device forces to run this is not recommended 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:01.019
 Lienau like that 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.120
 with which 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:05.089
 Portraits that is stupid 

00:04:05.089 --> 00:04:08.469
 also center also parked wrong 

00:04:08.469 --> 00:04:10.219
 when he gets the device 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:12.650
 Keep upright then they will be like that 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:15.690
 recorded in this format the video and not who 

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:20.229
 is still synonymous underneath for the best performance the Nati is as 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:21.799
 unnatural 

00:04:21.799 --> 00:04:23.789
 percent 

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:24.789
 device 

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:27.789
 VN Orient Action 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.889
 Merz Leiter let me start with read me again 

00:04:32.499 --> 00:04:34.470
 her as far as the video format 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.930
 Last Year would have to decide either from January on big files so one 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.400
 also before every time 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.729
 or a NOK or 2 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.810
 Jes is smaller but already on the device converted 

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:51.149
 I upgraded the video quality at all but did not know the 

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:54.149
 biggest differences except for Contador 

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:57.689
 if Mio groups he explains what 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:01.469
 I'm not sure what that means you just google it 

00:05:01.469 --> 00:05:04.439
 what's up is 

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.439
 The same was true that the app was off 

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:11.150
 not highly recommended the money is for example 

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.979
 the full size of the screen is recorded and I only half 

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:20.249
 This will keep the files bigger but those all Roger 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.679
 So all other functions are something else is kind of must take 

00:05:25.349 --> 00:05:28.839
 not really recommended and also relatively meaningless 

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:32.309
 where did he get from then on? 

00:05:32.309 --> 00:05:35.309
 the show shows him what I see telling animal 

00:05:36.099 --> 00:05:39.529
 that point he can see that I'm over there now that it looks this 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:42.120
 myself and I have only on if is recorded 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:46.160
 the size of the medion so that you do not hide too much while the latter would be 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:49.050
 Now if I wrote the cover letter I could then see the files 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:51.569
 then play on the PC 

00:05:51.569 --> 00:05:53.939
 EFG Financial Products that's all 

00:05:53.939 --> 00:05:57.330
 because neither how this is activated but since I had it on it before 

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:58.259
 received 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:05:59.699
 at YouTube account 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:03.539
 can you then start your YouTube 17 Marco Kollang and 

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:04.770
 4 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:08.050
 Percent climbing enter the product data and upload directly 

00:06:09.089 --> 00:06:13.749
 the last point is a riddle, "we had to deal with the defense 

00:06:13.749 --> 00:06:15.889
 compact and not now 

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:18.900
 no relevant functions 

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.050
 and so far here are also by percent 

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:26.789
 then if I learned something and see you next time
