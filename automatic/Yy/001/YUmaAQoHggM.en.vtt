an internship for modest industries they
make<00:00:30.400> peanut<00:00:31.359> harvesters<00:00:31.929> I<00:00:32.140> guess<00:00:32.439> but<00:00:32.879> some

00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:33.879 
make peanut harvesters I guess but some

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:36.660 
make peanut harvesters I guess but some
other<00:00:34.059> stuff<00:00:34.420> but<00:00:35.410> anyway<00:00:35.890> the<00:00:36.309> point<00:00:36.460> of<00:00:36.610> this

video here is you know it gets awful hot

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.950 
video here is you know it gets awful hot
like<00:00:39.460> 95<00:00:40.210> degrees<00:00:40.720> and<00:00:41.110> I<00:00:42.539> burned<00:00:43.539> up<00:00:43.660> one<00:00:43.870> of

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:43.960 
like 95 degrees and I burned up one of

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.810 
like 95 degrees and I burned up one of
my<00:00:44.670> electric<00:00:45.670> pumps<00:00:47.280> luckily<00:00:48.280> some<00:00:48.550> it<00:00:48.670> was

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:48.820 
my electric pumps luckily some it was

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:50.549 
my electric pumps luckily some it was
kind<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.210> sent<00:00:49.480> me<00:00:49.570> a<00:00:49.600> new<00:00:49.809> one<00:00:49.989> but<00:00:50.230> I<00:00:50.289> had<00:00:50.530> it

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
kind of sent me a new one but I had it

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.470 
kind of sent me a new one but I had it
set<00:00:50.920> up<00:00:50.949> in<00:00:51.129> a<00:00:51.219> Deadhead<00:00:51.670> style<00:00:52.059> and<00:00:52.239> it<00:00:52.329> would

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.480 
set up in a Deadhead style and it would

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.380 
set up in a Deadhead style and it would
get<00:00:53.379> really<00:00:53.559> hot<00:00:53.920> but<00:00:54.250> even<00:00:54.670> in<00:00:54.760> a<00:00:54.850> Deadhead

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:55.390 
get really hot but even in a Deadhead

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:58.349 
get really hot but even in a Deadhead
system<00:00:55.899> my<00:00:56.050> fuel<00:00:56.440> and<00:00:56.649> the<00:00:56.739> lines<00:00:57.090> would<00:00:58.090> just

00:00:58.349 --> 00:00:58.359 
system my fuel and the lines would just

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:00.270 
system my fuel and the lines would just
get<00:00:58.570> really<00:00:59.079> really<00:00:59.410> hot<00:00:59.739> and<00:00:59.769> it<00:00:59.980> would<00:01:00.070> start

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
get really really hot and it would start

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.009 
get really really hot and it would start
to<00:01:00.340> boil<00:01:00.670> and<00:01:00.910> you<00:01:01.000> could<00:01:01.149> actually<00:01:01.329> see<00:01:01.870> it

00:01:02.009 --> 00:01:02.019 
to boil and you could actually see it

00:01:02.019 --> 00:01:05.369 
to boil and you could actually see it
bubbling<00:01:02.530> up<00:01:02.969> through<00:01:03.969> this<00:01:04.449> glass<00:01:04.750> filter

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:05.379 
bubbling up through this glass filter

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.440 
bubbling up through this glass filter
here<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.570> it<00:01:07.570> wasn't<00:01:07.869> a<00:01:07.899> good<00:01:08.020> situation<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:09.450> I

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:10.450 
here so it wasn't a good situation so I

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:11.700 
here so it wasn't a good situation so I
didn't<00:01:10.840> really<00:01:10.929> want<00:01:11.050> to<00:01:11.229> spend<00:01:11.380> a<00:01:11.560> lot<00:01:11.679> of

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
didn't really want to spend a lot of

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.139 
didn't really want to spend a lot of
money<00:01:11.890> as<00:01:12.100> I<00:01:12.190> wasn't<00:01:12.310> sure<00:01:12.580> if<00:01:12.729> it<00:01:12.880> was<00:01:13.000> the

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:13.149 
money as I wasn't sure if it was the

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.080 
money as I wasn't sure if it was the
problem<00:01:13.539> but<00:01:13.720> what<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:13.899> ended<00:01:14.110> up<00:01:14.200> making<00:01:14.380> was<00:01:15.090> a

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:16.090 
problem but what I ended up making was a

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:19.680 
problem but what I ended up making was a
return<00:01:16.780> line<00:01:17.110> and<00:01:17.459> I<00:01:18.459> did<00:01:19.179> this<00:01:19.360> is<00:01:19.660> just

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
return line and I did this is just

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.730 
return line and I did this is just
basically<00:01:20.380> what<00:01:20.740> you<00:01:20.830> can<00:01:20.860> see<00:01:21.280> here<00:01:21.310> is<00:01:21.849> uh<00:01:21.880> I

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
basically what you can see here is uh I

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.249 
basically what you can see here is uh I
went<00:01:23.740> into<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:24.099> tea<00:01:24.940> fitting<00:01:25.420> like<00:01:25.599> this<00:01:25.929> and

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:26.259 
went into a tea fitting like this and

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:28.889 
went into a tea fitting like this and
then<00:01:26.349> put<00:01:26.530> an<00:01:26.619> angle<00:01:26.979> to<00:01:27.190> my<00:01:27.750> carburetor<00:01:28.750> and

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:28.899 
then put an angle to my carburetor and

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:31.020 
then put an angle to my carburetor and
took<00:01:29.440> a<00:01:29.470> tea<00:01:29.800> and<00:01:30.039> then<00:01:30.220> that<00:01:30.369> one<00:01:30.550> goes<00:01:30.759> back

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
took a tea and then that one goes back

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.229 
took a tea and then that one goes back
to<00:01:31.090> the<00:01:31.660> gas<00:01:31.869> tank<00:01:32.229> and<00:01:32.440> the<00:01:33.160> rubber<00:01:33.340> line<00:01:33.670> ends

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:34.239 
to the gas tank and the rubber line ends

00:01:34.239 --> 00:01:35.969 
to the gas tank and the rubber line ends
right<00:01:34.840> down<00:01:35.080> there<00:01:35.289> and<00:01:35.410> it's<00:01:35.500> metal<00:01:35.830> all<00:01:35.950> the

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979 
right down there and it's metal all the

00:01:35.979 --> 00:01:37.440 
right down there and it's metal all the
way<00:01:36.069> back<00:01:36.340> I<00:01:36.640> don't<00:01:36.789> even<00:01:36.849> like<00:01:37.060> having<00:01:37.300> this

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
way back I don't even like having this

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.660 
way back I don't even like having this
much<00:01:37.690> rubber<00:01:37.929> line<00:01:38.229> but<00:01:38.560> you<00:01:39.190> know<00:01:39.280> I<00:01:39.310> kind<00:01:39.610> of

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:39.670 
much rubber line but you know I kind of

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.160 
much rubber line but you know I kind of
got<00:01:39.819> to<00:01:39.910> make<00:01:40.060> do<00:01:40.209> with<00:01:40.360> what<00:01:40.390> I<00:01:40.539> have<00:01:40.599> here<00:01:41.080> in

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:41.170 
got to make do with what I have here in

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.270 
got to make do with what I have here in
Virginia<00:01:41.729> so<00:01:43.920> anyway<00:01:44.920> that's<00:01:45.099> pretty

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:45.280 
Virginia so anyway that's pretty

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.660 
Virginia so anyway that's pretty
simplistic<00:01:46.239> and<00:01:46.780> what<00:01:46.989> I<00:01:47.020> did<00:01:47.289> here<00:01:47.649> is<00:01:47.679> if<00:01:48.099> you

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
simplistic and what I did here is if you

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:51.359 
simplistic and what I did here is if you
see<00:01:48.940> the<00:01:49.149> this<00:01:49.450> little<00:01:49.739> sectioned<00:01:50.739> piece<00:01:51.039> if

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:51.369 
see the this little sectioned piece if

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:53.369 
see the this little sectioned piece if
you<00:01:51.429> can<00:01:51.580> see<00:01:51.729> this<00:01:51.880> bump<00:01:52.149> here<00:01:52.270> now<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:53.349> I

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:53.379 
you can see this bump here now what I

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:58.260 
you can see this bump here now what I
did<00:01:53.619> is<00:01:53.739> I<00:01:53.860> took<00:01:53.920> a<00:01:54.099> bolt<00:01:54.489> and<00:01:55.410> that<00:01:56.410> uh<00:01:57.270> you

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
did is I took a bolt and that uh you

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.940 
did is I took a bolt and that uh you
know<00:01:58.390> would<00:01:58.599> fit<00:01:58.840> snugly<00:01:59.379> in<00:01:59.470> there<00:01:59.649> but<00:01:59.800> yet<00:01:59.920> I

00:01:59.940 --> 00:01:59.950 
know would fit snugly in there but yet I

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:02.790 
know would fit snugly in there but yet I
could<00:02:00.190> still<00:02:00.429> get<00:02:00.550> in<00:02:00.700> that<00:02:00.849> 3/8<00:02:01.239> hose<00:02:01.479> and<00:02:01.869> I

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
could still get in that 3/8 hose and I

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:05.100 
could still get in that 3/8 hose and I
drilled<00:02:03.190> a<00:02:03.369> sixty<00:02:03.879> thousand<00:02:04.360> hole<00:02:04.569> in<00:02:04.810> it<00:02:04.959> and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
drilled a sixty thousand hole in it and

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.029 
drilled a sixty thousand hole in it and
that's<00:02:05.979> what<00:02:06.220> I<00:02:06.250> believe<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.729> hole<00:02:06.910> is<00:02:07.119> on

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
that's what I believe the hole is on

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.410 
that's what I believe the hole is on
fuel<00:02:09.039> pressure<00:02:09.340> regulators<00:02:10.030> that<00:02:10.239> have<00:02:10.390> a

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
fuel pressure regulators that have a

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:16.050 
fuel pressure regulators that have a
return<00:02:10.840> on<00:02:11.080> them<00:02:11.520> so<00:02:13.470> anyway<00:02:14.670> that<00:02:15.670> seems<00:02:15.940> to

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
return on them so anyway that seems to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.349 
return on them so anyway that seems to
work<00:02:16.090> great<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:16.900> I<00:02:17.800> hold<00:02:18.069> good<00:02:18.849> solid

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:19.359 
work great and I hold good solid

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:22.110 
work great and I hold good solid
pressure<00:02:19.659> still<00:02:20.260> and<00:02:20.530> it's<00:02:21.519> just<00:02:21.730> been<00:02:21.879> really

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
pressure still and it's just been really

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.300 
pressure still and it's just been really
nice<00:02:22.390> my<00:02:22.780> biggest<00:02:23.019> problem

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310

ashtray I can watch it go lean when I
sit<00:02:45.880> in<00:02:45.910> traffic<00:02:46.150> it'll<00:02:46.720> go<00:02:46.870> from<00:02:47.050> a<00:02:47.200> nice<00:02:47.520> 13

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:48.520 
sit in traffic it'll go from a nice 13

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.430 
sit in traffic it'll go from a nice 13
and<00:02:48.670> a<00:02:48.700> half<00:02:48.880> to<00:02:49.120> one<00:02:49.150> idle<00:02:49.750> all<00:02:49.960> the<00:02:50.110> way<00:02:50.200> up<00:02:50.290> to

and<00:03:00.010> it<00:03:00.520> circulates<00:03:00.760> the<00:03:01.120> fuel<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.630> keeps<00:03:01.840> it

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:01.990 
and it circulates the fuel and keeps it

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:04.410 
and it circulates the fuel and keeps it
nice<00:03:02.140> and<00:03:02.200> cool<00:03:02.590> I<00:03:02.920> don't<00:03:03.790> have<00:03:04.000> any<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.330> those

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660 
problems um with the fuel boiling and

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.440 
problems um with the fuel boiling and
leaning<00:03:08.020> out<00:03:08.170> and<00:03:08.200> just<00:03:08.950> you<00:03:09.459> know<00:03:09.490> bad

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
leaning out and just you know bad

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.390 
leaning out and just you know bad
running<00:03:10.900> and<00:03:11.020> traffic<00:03:11.500> and<00:03:11.740> you<00:03:12.070> know<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> got<00:03:12.370> a

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:12.400 
running and traffic and you know I got a

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:13.980 
running and traffic and you know I got a
big<00:03:12.550> aluminum<00:03:12.940> radiator<00:03:13.330> on<00:03:13.540> here<00:03:13.750> so<00:03:13.930> at

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:13.990 
big aluminum radiator on here so at

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:17.730 
big aluminum radiator on here so at
least<00:03:14.080> I'll<00:03:14.320> have<00:03:14.350> overheating<00:03:15.100> issues<00:03:15.840> uh<00:03:16.840> uh

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:17.740 
least I'll have overheating issues uh uh

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:21.780 
least I'll have overheating issues uh uh
but<00:03:18.250> anyway<00:03:18.870> yeah<00:03:19.870> it<00:03:20.020> works<00:03:20.200> really<00:03:21.070> good

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:21.790 
but anyway yeah it works really good

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.030 
but anyway yeah it works really good
I'd<00:03:22.270> recommend<00:03:22.630> with<00:03:22.959> these<00:03:23.110> electric<00:03:23.620> pumps

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.040 
I'd recommend with these electric pumps

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.340 
I'd recommend with these electric pumps
that<00:03:24.130> you<00:03:24.220> have<00:03:24.400> a<00:03:24.430> return<00:03:24.820> line<00:03:25.090> because<00:03:25.420> you

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:26.350 
that you have a return line because you

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:29.430 
that you have a return line because you
know<00:03:26.470> it<00:03:26.620> quieted<00:03:27.100> my<00:03:27.459> big<00:03:27.760> Holley<00:03:28.110> blue<00:03:29.110> pump

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
know it quieted my big Holley blue pump

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:33.600 
know it quieted my big Holley blue pump
way<00:03:29.830> down<00:03:30.280> it<00:03:30.670> got<00:03:30.880> really<00:03:31.209> quiet<00:03:31.540> when<00:03:32.050> I<00:03:32.610> made

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:33.610 
way down it got really quiet when I made

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:36.780 
way down it got really quiet when I made
that<00:03:33.820> swap<00:03:34.269> so<00:03:34.930> it<00:03:35.500> was<00:03:35.920> well<00:03:36.130> worth<00:03:36.370> it<00:03:36.670> but

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
that swap so it was well worth it but

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.000 
that swap so it was well worth it but
anyway<00:03:37.090> all<00:03:37.170> flip<00:03:38.170> it<00:03:38.320> on<00:03:38.470> here<00:03:38.830> and<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:38.980> can

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
anyway all flip it on here and you can

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.949 
anyway all flip it on here and you can
see<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.430> return<00:03:39.550> coming<00:03:40.150> into<00:03:40.269> my<00:03:40.420> fuel<00:03:40.690> cell

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
see the return coming into my fuel cell

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.410 
see the return coming into my fuel cell
again<00:03:41.320> you'll<00:03:41.500> have<00:03:41.620> to<00:03:41.709> forgive<00:03:42.130> you<00:03:43.000> know<00:03:43.180> my

going<00:03:55.450> to<00:03:55.660> no<00:03:55.810> relying<00:03:56.320> on<00:03:56.440> it<00:03:57.090> anyway<00:03:58.090> we'll

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
going to no relying on it anyway we'll

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.699 
going to no relying on it anyway we'll
flip<00:03:59.680> our<00:03:59.950> switches<00:04:00.640> here<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.290> you<00:04:02.380> can<00:04:02.530> hear

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
flip our switches here and you can hear

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.720 
flip our switches here and you can hear
that<00:04:02.890> pump<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:04.769> it's<00:04:05.769> not<00:04:05.920> too<00:04:06.130> loud<00:04:06.370> when<00:04:06.640> the

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730 
that pump and it's not too loud when the

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.289 
that pump and it's not too loud when the
car<00:04:06.940> is<00:04:06.970> running<00:04:07.860> so<00:04:08.860> because<00:04:09.760> it's<00:04:09.940> bleeding

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:10.299 
car is running so because it's bleeding

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:12.440 
car is running so because it's bleeding
off<00:04:10.390> even<00:04:10.780> more<00:04:10.959> fuel<00:04:11.230> under<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.620> carburetor

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
off even more fuel under the carburetor

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.180 
off even more fuel under the carburetor
but<00:04:13.450> you<00:04:13.600> see<00:04:13.840> here<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.170> don't<00:04:14.440> have<00:04:14.590> issues<00:04:14.799> now

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:15.190 
but you see here I don't have issues now

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.370 
but you see here I don't have issues now
with<00:04:15.400> pressure<00:04:15.730> creep<00:04:16.239> because<00:04:16.900> it's

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:17.380 
with pressure creep because it's

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.259 
with pressure creep because it's
bleeding<00:04:18.130> off<00:04:18.220> the<00:04:18.459> return<00:04:18.790> line<00:04:19.030> where

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
bleeding off the return line where

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:21.180 
bleeding off the return line where
before<00:04:19.479> with<00:04:20.109> this<00:04:20.260> electric<00:04:20.680> pump<00:04:20.950> it<00:04:21.100> would

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190 
before with this electric pump it would

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.820 
before with this electric pump it would
also<00:04:21.340> have<00:04:21.790> pressure<00:04:22.120> creep<00:04:22.510> issues<00:04:22.900> where<00:04:23.140> if

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:23.830 
also have pressure creep issues where if

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:25.110 
also have pressure creep issues where if
the<00:04:23.979> car<00:04:24.160> was<00:04:24.340> off<00:04:24.520> that<00:04:24.550> thing<00:04:24.910> would<00:04:25.030> be

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
the car was off that thing would be

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.550 
the car was off that thing would be
going<00:04:25.150> all<00:04:25.479> the<00:04:25.570> way<00:04:25.690> to<00:04:25.750> like<00:04:25.930> 12:00<00:04:26.320> and

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:26.560 
going all the way to like 12:00 and

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.740 
going all the way to like 12:00 and
blowing<00:04:26.950> into<00:04:27.160> the<00:04:27.510> carburetor<00:04:28.510> and

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:28.750 
blowing into the carburetor and

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:30.480 
blowing into the carburetor and
everything<00:04:29.200> so<00:04:29.410> you<00:04:29.680> can<00:04:29.770> see<00:04:29.979> they're<00:04:30.190> going

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
everything so you can see they're going

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.860 
everything so you can see they're going
to<00:04:30.550> call<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:31.560> seven

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:32.870 
to call it seven

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:35.970 
to call it seven
so<00:04:33.139> we<00:04:33.230> got<00:04:33.380> enough<00:04:33.590> restriction<00:04:34.570> pressure

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
so we got enough restriction pressure

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:42.310 
so we got enough restriction pressure
but<00:04:36.980> yet<00:04:37.430> still<00:04:40.449> Bradley<00:04:41.449> can't<00:04:41.690> hear<00:04:41.960> it<00:04:42.110> but

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
but yet still Bradley can't hear it but

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.760 
but yet still Bradley can't hear it but
you<00:04:42.350> can<00:04:42.560> see<00:04:42.740> some<00:04:42.979> the<00:04:43.100> riffles<00:04:43.490> in<00:04:43.610> the<00:04:43.729> fuel

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
you can see some the riffles in the fuel

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:48.510 
you can see some the riffles in the fuel
you<00:04:45.770> know<00:04:45.889> our<00:04:46.130> turn<00:04:46.520> lines<00:04:46.790> doing<00:04:47.120> its<00:04:47.360> job

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
you know our turn lines doing its job

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.000 
you know our turn lines doing its job
and<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.790> should<00:04:50.030> save<00:04:50.330> the<00:04:50.570> pump<00:04:50.840> so<00:04:51.590> the<00:04:51.770> pump

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:52.010 
and it should save the pump so the pump

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.560 
and it should save the pump so the pump
will<00:04:52.160> last<00:04:52.370> a<00:04:52.550> lot<00:04:52.729> longer<00:04:54.040> um<00:04:55.300> shut<00:04:56.300> her<00:04:56.389> down

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:56.570 
will last a lot longer um shut her down

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:02.320 
will last a lot longer um shut her down
here<00:04:57.610> but<00:04:58.610> uh<00:04:58.639> I<00:04:59.860> do<00:05:00.860> I<00:05:01.040> had<00:05:01.400> I<00:05:01.639> did<00:05:01.820> try<00:05:02.090> it<00:05:02.150> on<00:05:02.300> a

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
here but uh I do I had I did try it on a

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.030 
here but uh I do I had I did try it on a
mechanical<00:05:02.930> pump<00:05:03.139> and<00:05:03.440> I<00:05:03.500> don't<00:05:03.680> recommend

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:04.040 
mechanical pump and I don't recommend

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:07.990 
mechanical pump and I don't recommend
doing<00:05:04.280> that<00:05:04.720> um<00:05:05.720> it<00:05:06.139> just<00:05:06.880> couldn't<00:05:07.880> hold

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:08.000 
doing that um it just couldn't hold

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.820 
doing that um it just couldn't hold
enough<00:05:08.330> pressure<00:05:08.660> and<00:05:08.960> I<00:05:09.020> have<00:05:09.200> a<00:05:09.229> big<00:05:09.530> Holley

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
enough pressure and I have a big Holley

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:13.360 
enough pressure and I have a big Holley
pump<00:05:10.630> that<00:05:11.630> uh<00:05:11.740> you<00:05:12.740> know<00:05:12.860> I<00:05:12.889> had<00:05:13.100> to<00:05:13.220> actually

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.370 
pump that uh you know I had to actually

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:15.070 
pump that uh you know I had to actually
make<00:05:13.669> a<00:05:13.700> plate<00:05:14.060> since<00:05:14.479> I've<00:05:14.630> been<00:05:14.720> down<00:05:14.870> here

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
make a plate since I've been down here

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.210 
make a plate since I've been down here
to<00:05:15.169> cover<00:05:15.350> it<00:05:15.530> up<00:05:15.590> but<00:05:15.800> I<00:05:15.830> did<00:05:16.040> have<00:05:16.190> a

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220 
to cover it up but I did have a

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.260 
to cover it up but I did have a
mechanical<00:05:16.820> pump<00:05:17.120> and<00:05:18.250> you<00:05:19.250> know<00:05:19.370> it<00:05:19.550> just<00:05:19.850> it

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:20.270 
mechanical pump and you know it just it

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:21.370 
mechanical pump and you know it just it
just<00:05:20.330> wouldn't<00:05:20.720> cut<00:05:20.930> it<00:05:21.050> with<00:05:21.139> the<00:05:21.260> return

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:21.380 
just wouldn't cut it with the return

00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:22.960 
just wouldn't cut it with the return
line<00:05:21.770> it<00:05:21.919> wouldn't<00:05:22.130> build<00:05:22.280> enough<00:05:22.520> pressures

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:22.970 
line it wouldn't build enough pressures

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:25.810 
line it wouldn't build enough pressures
only<00:05:23.120> bumping<00:05:23.600> around<00:05:23.690> it<00:05:24.020> like<00:05:24.310> four<00:05:25.310> or<00:05:25.580> five

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:25.820 
only bumping around it like four or five

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:27.310 
only bumping around it like four or five
and<00:05:26.060> I<00:05:26.120> like<00:05:26.270> to<00:05:26.389> run<00:05:26.510> seven<00:05:26.900> pounds<00:05:27.229> of

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:27.320 
and I like to run seven pounds of

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:32.560 
and I like to run seven pounds of
pressure<00:05:27.560> so<00:05:29.440> anyway<00:05:30.440> overall<00:05:31.510> you<00:05:32.510> know

00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:32.570 
pressure so anyway overall you know

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:34.450 
pressure so anyway overall you know
that's<00:05:32.780> kind<00:05:33.050> of<00:05:33.080> my<00:05:33.199> return<00:05:33.500> line<00:05:33.830> system<00:05:34.310> you

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:34.460 
that's kind of my return line system you

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:36.969 
that's kind of my return line system you
can<00:05:34.610> see<00:05:34.820> there<00:05:35.060> you<00:05:35.780> know<00:05:35.900> obviously<00:05:36.440> I<00:05:36.590> could

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:36.979 
can see there you know obviously I could

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:39.279 
can see there you know obviously I could
cut<00:05:37.729> this<00:05:38.000> shorter<00:05:38.450> here<00:05:38.690> and<00:05:38.810> I<00:05:38.840> got<00:05:39.020> some

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:39.289 
cut this shorter here and I got some

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:41.710 
cut this shorter here and I got some
fine<00:05:39.560> tuning<00:05:39.590> to<00:05:40.100> do<00:05:40.250> but<00:05:40.580> you<00:05:41.300> know<00:05:41.419> it<00:05:41.570> runs

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:41.720 
fine tuning to do but you know it runs

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:46.480 
fine tuning to do but you know it runs
real<00:05:42.080> good<00:05:42.729> so<00:05:44.350> go<00:05:45.350> and<00:05:45.530> kick<00:05:45.740> her<00:05:45.860> over<00:05:46.220> here

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
real good so go and kick her over here

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:55.330 
real good so go and kick her over here
and<00:05:48.370> let<00:05:49.370> it<00:05:49.490> run<00:05:52.450> so<00:05:53.560> turn<00:05:54.560> our<00:05:54.710> ignition<00:05:54.889> on

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:55.340 
and let it run so turn our ignition on

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:05.529 
and let it run so turn our ignition on
all<00:05:56.090> our<00:05:56.810> electrical<00:05:57.410> crap<00:05:58.360> and<00:05:59.360> our<00:05:59.479> pump<00:06:04.539> key

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539 
all our electrical crap and our pump key

00:06:05.539 --> 00:06:15.760 
all our electrical crap and our pump key
it<00:06:05.720> in<00:06:05.870> here<00:06:06.380> and<00:06:07.090> give<00:06:08.090> her<00:06:08.240> a<00:06:08.300> pump

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:15.770 

00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.129 

and<00:06:16.550> also<00:06:16.729> with<00:06:17.120> this<00:06:17.270> setup<00:06:17.569> I<00:06:17.810> don't<00:06:17.960> have

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:18.139 
and also with this setup I don't have

00:06:18.139 --> 00:06:20.230 
and also with this setup I don't have
any<00:06:18.319> heat<00:06:18.560> so<00:06:18.830> issues<00:06:19.310> so<00:06:19.550> you<00:06:19.610> see<00:06:19.940> and<00:06:20.060> tell

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:20.240 
any heat so issues so you see and tell

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:22.510 
any heat so issues so you see and tell
the<00:06:20.449> intake<00:06:21.319> manifold<00:06:21.860> warms<00:06:22.190> back<00:06:22.280> up

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:22.520 
the intake manifold warms back up

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.659 
the intake manifold warms back up
because<00:06:23.120> we're<00:06:23.470> pretty<00:06:24.470> cooled<00:06:24.830> that<00:06:25.340> number

00:06:25.659 --> 00:06:25.669 
because we're pretty cooled that number

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:26.710 
because we're pretty cooled that number
is<00:06:25.729> going<00:06:25.849> to<00:06:25.940> be<00:06:26.000> pretty<00:06:26.180> high<00:06:26.360> but<00:06:26.539> it<00:06:26.660> will

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:26.720 
is going to be pretty high but it will

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:37.320 
is going to be pretty high but it will
get<00:06:26.810> down<00:06:26.990> to<00:06:27.050> 13<00:06:27.650> and<00:06:27.680> a<00:06:27.800> half<00:06:27.830> as<00:06:28.819> it<00:06:29.210> warms<00:06:29.389> up

00:06:37.320 --> 00:06:37.330 

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:43.930 

there<00:06:38.330> we<00:06:38.449> go<00:06:38.569> it's<00:06:38.870> coming<00:06:39.229> down<00:06:39.410> so<00:06:40.370> oh<00:06:42.940> yeah

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:43.940 
there we go it's coming down so oh yeah

00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.430 
there we go it's coming down so oh yeah
you<00:06:44.000> don't<00:06:44.240> hear<00:06:44.479> the<00:06:44.630> pump<00:06:44.870> now<00:06:45.080> and<00:06:45.349> it's

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:45.440 
you don't hear the pump now and it's

00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:47.290 
you don't hear the pump now and it's
bleeding<00:06:45.710> off<00:06:45.949> into<00:06:46.250> the<00:06:46.340> carburetor<00:06:46.729> as<00:06:47.060> well

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300 
bleeding off into the carburetor as well

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.629 
bleeding off into the carburetor as well
so<00:06:47.840> it's<00:06:48.139> really<00:06:48.409> not<00:06:49.099> putting<00:06:49.340> a<00:06:49.490> lot<00:06:49.520> of

00:06:49.629 --> 00:06:49.639 
so it's really not putting a lot of

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:56.260 
so it's really not putting a lot of
strain<00:06:49.940> on<00:06:50.000> that<00:06:50.300> pump<00:06:54.819> here<00:06:55.819> we<00:06:55.909> are<00:06:55.940> with<00:06:56.240> our

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:56.270 
strain on that pump here we are with our

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:03.810 
strain on that pump here we are with our
289

00:07:03.810 --> 00:07:03.820 

00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:06.370 

holding<00:07:04.820> a<00:07:04.880> solid<00:07:05.330> seven<00:07:05.690> pounds<00:07:06.050> of<00:07:06.140> pressure

00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:06.380 
holding a solid seven pounds of pressure

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:10.780 
holding a solid seven pounds of pressure
so<00:07:07.600> anyway<00:07:08.600> there<00:07:08.840> you<00:07:08.990> go<00:07:09.190> return<00:07:10.190> lines<00:07:10.490> it's

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:10.790 
so anyway there you go return lines it's

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:12.670 
so anyway there you go return lines it's
really<00:07:11.150> saved<00:07:11.450> me<00:07:11.630> in<00:07:11.720> traffic<00:07:12.260> and<00:07:12.410> I<00:07:12.500> can

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:12.680 
really saved me in traffic and I can

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:15.640 
really saved me in traffic and I can
just<00:07:12.830> drive<00:07:13.100> this<00:07:13.310> car<00:07:13.580> and<00:07:13.990> any<00:07:14.990> weather<00:07:15.290> any

just drive this car and any weather any

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.050 
just drive this car and any weather any
circumstances<00:07:16.610> it<00:07:16.760> holds<00:07:17.060> up<00:07:17.210> great<00:07:17.240> so

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
circumstances it holds up great so

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:23.680 
circumstances it holds up great so
pretty<00:07:20.060> much<00:07:20.410> there<00:07:21.410> you<00:07:21.440> go<00:07:22.300> still<00:07:23.300> return

pretty much there you go still return

pretty much there you go still return

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:25.910
