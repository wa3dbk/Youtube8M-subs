00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.520 
my contract so I redid my contract and I
guess<00:05:58.860> I<00:05:59.099> was<00:05:59.280> real<00:05:59.669> slow<00:06:00.180> about<00:06:00.870> the<00:06:01.080> contract

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:01.530 
guess I was real slow about the contract

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:04.219 
guess I was real slow about the contract
because<00:06:01.830> it's<00:06:02.010> had<00:06:02.190> 14<00:06:02.820> million<00:06:03.150> for<00:06:04.020> five

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
because it's had 14 million for five

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.409 
because it's had 14 million for five
four<00:06:04.860> five<00:06:05.039> years<00:06:05.430> and<00:06:05.580> I'm<00:06:05.669> like<00:06:05.820> 14<00:06:06.270> million

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:06.419 
four five years and I'm like 14 million

00:06:06.419 --> 00:06:09.080 
four five years and I'm like 14 million
five<00:06:06.660> years<00:06:06.960> that's<00:06:07.080> nothing<00:06:07.789> actually<00:06:08.789> it's

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:09.090 
five years that's nothing actually it's

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:10.980 
five years that's nothing actually it's
for<00:06:09.479> over<00:06:09.900> 14<00:06:10.440> million

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:10.990 
for over 14 million

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:14.240 
for over 14 million
year<00:06:11.470> so<00:06:12.280> I<00:06:12.310> felt<00:06:12.670> kind<00:06:12.940> of<00:06:13.030> silly<00:06:13.420> about<00:06:13.660> that

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:14.250 
year so I felt kind of silly about that

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.630 
year so I felt kind of silly about that
so<00:06:15.250> as<00:06:15.610> you<00:06:16.270> can<00:06:16.420> see<00:06:16.480> I<00:06:17.020> got<00:06:17.620> myself<00:06:17.920> a<00:06:18.250> five
