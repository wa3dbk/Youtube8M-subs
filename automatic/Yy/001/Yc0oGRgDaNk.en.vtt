corner while pulling down gently on the

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:55.740 
corner while pulling down gently on the
shade<00:04:54.100> I'll<00:04:54.580> repeat<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:54.970> process<00:04:55.300> on<00:04:55.630> the

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
shade I'll repeat that process on the

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:57.870 
shade I'll repeat that process on the
other<00:04:55.780> side<00:04:56.140> and<00:04:56.380> roll<00:04:56.890> the<00:04:57.040> shade<00:04:57.250> down<00:04:57.520> and

00:04:57.870 --> 00:04:57.880 
other side and roll the shade down and

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:00.870 
other side and roll the shade down and
off<00:04:58.560> reinstalling<00:04:59.560> is<00:04:59.860> also<00:05:00.250> a<00:05:00.280> bit<00:05:00.490> tricky<00:05:00.790> to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
off reinstalling is also a bit tricky to

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:03.210 
off reinstalling is also a bit tricky to
figure<00:05:01.000> out<00:05:01.300> but<00:05:01.810> is<00:05:01.960> also<00:05:02.169> very<00:05:02.380> easy<00:05:02.440> once

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:03.220 
figure out but is also very easy once

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.770 
figure out but is also very easy once
you<00:05:03.280> know<00:05:03.430> what<00:05:03.520> you're<00:05:03.640> doing<00:05:03.910> this<00:05:04.450> little

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:04.780 
you know what you're doing this little

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:06.659 
you know what you're doing this little
lip<00:05:04.960> on<00:05:05.169> the<00:05:05.290> bottom<00:05:05.440> edge<00:05:05.740> of<00:05:05.890> the<00:05:05.919> shade<00:05:06.220> has

to<00:05:06.850> go<00:05:06.940> in<00:05:07.090> first<00:05:07.330> on<00:05:07.570> both<00:05:07.750> sides<00:05:08.050> then<00:05:08.620> you

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:08.650 
to go in first on both sides then you

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:10.230 
to go in first on both sides then you
can<00:05:08.860> roll<00:05:09.070> this<00:05:09.220> shade<00:05:09.400> back<00:05:09.580> until<00:05:09.940> it<00:05:10.030> clicks

00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:10.240 
can roll this shade back until it clicks

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:12.090 
can roll this shade back until it clicks
back<00:05:10.480> into<00:05:10.720> the<00:05:10.780> tab<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:11.710> when<00:05:11.830> you<00:05:11.919> roll<00:05:12.070> the
