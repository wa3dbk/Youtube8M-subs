00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.510
 yes and with that a warm welcome 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.370
 his friends here is lee james lp 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.799
 of course, just for you today a new one 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.469
 follow of battlefield 3 webm I lure 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 I have about one now 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:14.070
 week a little video provided 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.900
 where you should sign which one 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.529
 weapon is to come next and the 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:21.210
 a94 simply won out of proportion 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.029
 I think the second place has that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.439
 occupied by the g36 c where I me 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.300
 actually not so sure 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.800
 that i still have this weapon 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.750
 I did not think the third one 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.980
 Placement was then the fun 12 me 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.230
 Let's see if I then one now 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.880
 make new video or whether 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.430
 I then just according to the order 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.390
 I do not know yet so we go 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.680
 just catch that one now 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.480
 story behind these weapons 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.050
 but of course we'll catch it first 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.750
 to say why the weapon at all 94 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.640
 a significant ass domat nikolova grandma 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.129
 definitely a lot smarter now 

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.739
 the 94 behind it means that anyway 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.520
 first produced in 1994 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.020
 has been 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.320
 It was developed by the Russian 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.449
 constructors aldi nikolov I say 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.489
 you Russian is a really great one 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.500
 language and of course fits in the 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.810
 armaments works of taste that was 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.510
 approximately between 1980 and 1990 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.900
 It was officially introduced in the year 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:18.210
 1994 therefore also the naming of 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.100
 name 1 94 was not always 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.619
 representative of this weapon before 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.210
 Was called ias and prototype or prototypes 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.340
 as you like it 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:27.810
 I want to and in a time as you 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.040
 developed for an arms competition 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.259
 and has been produced 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:33.000
 The reason for the competition was simply the 

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:36.659
 looking for a successor for the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.119
 known weapon ak 74 stood for many 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:43.079
 name of this weapon with the term but 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.729
 can not be available yes yes yes so in 

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:46.049
 Battlefield bad company 2 is still so 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.689
 that was beside the weapon also one 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:50.070
 apa can therefore stand at 94 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:51.840
 I am also really long time 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.340
 asked what does that mean now 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.110
 what do you want to tell me? 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.060
 and I found out that 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.740
 a russian city is also already 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.570
 good to know in my opinion the 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.290
 Unfortunately, the introduction was a bit slower 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.060
 Besides 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.560
 there is the financing simply because 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.360
 you have to be completely honest about that 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:08.160
 Now this weapon is actually going to say 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.460
 only from russian elite units 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.560
 as well as police units 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:13.510
 uses and is now available in russia 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:15.190
 so now just come to a few 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:16.420
 technical details for one 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.820
 or maybe even others 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.470
 wink wink you can be useful 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:25.330
 has a length of 728 to 900 43 mm 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:27.370
 she has a weight of 385 invited 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:28.780
 kilogram and her foliage has a length 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.220
 of 405 mm 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.440
 She has a caliber of 54 5 x 39 mm 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.960
 magazine fit a total of 30 cartridges 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:40.150
 her reallife cadence is her fire rate 

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:41.890
 is 1800 shots in the minute 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:43.750
 if of course the two word 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.160
 used now just come to one 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:47.740
 few battlefield 3 live statistics 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.600
 sees a harm in the game that would have to 

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:52.000
 Now I really know it in the game as well 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:54.700
 some do not understand that from 18.4 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.990
 to 25 which is really very neat 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.150
 now just come to one 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:02:59.590
 a small stick usually gets 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.600
 Now the point is where I am with you 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.040
 talk about how to naturally this 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.930
 weapon unlocks but I have now 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.120
 looked at several websites and 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.620
 There is something else everywhere 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.720
 of course these storm soldiers points 

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:13.030
 and on the German side one stands 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:16.120
 unlocks it with 232,000 points 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.590
 on the English stands 166,000 and up 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.780
 another side somehow stood 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.610
 only 60,000 and therefore with you 

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.140
 Of course, not really what it is 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.240
 That's right and that's why we're leaving this one 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:26.950
 point off would be of course a tip 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:28.510
 has and also knows one right 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.100
 maybe the last ones unlocked 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.880
 Of course he can do that in the 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.320
 Write comments 

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:34.240
 but I do not want her now 

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:36.670
 Of course everything is wood because that is 

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:38.740
 really not necessary she had like in 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.720
 real life a magazine of 30 cartridges 

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.470
 plus 1 revolution and she has one at the beginning 

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.910
 Ammunition capacity of 124 +31 cartridges 

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:51.490
 and maximum 217 +31 cartridges the shops 2 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:54.070
 45 second night when it is charged 

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.960
 and in 33 seconds when it's empty 

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:58.450
 in fully automatic mode, she has one 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:04:00.760
 cadence cadence equal firing rate of 600 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.220
 Shots in the minute and 1200 shots 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.450
 in the minute with the 2 1 is somehow 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.810
 hard to believe but it really is 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.760
 so 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.060
 now come to the last reach 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:11.380
 because the maximum is 900 meters now 

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:14.200
 just come to my classes 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:16.150
 setup honestly i really wanted to 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.950
 not play with this weapon at all 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.640
 it was actually the weapon where 

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:20.200
 I thought so 

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.810
 lures webm 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.220
 not with this weapon I was already 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:25.450
 actually quite a fan of this 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:27.370
 factor in bad company 2 

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.810
 but of course you have to 

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.750
 confess that bad company 2 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.280
 many classics have been the reason why 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:35.890
 handling this weapon in this game 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.890
 been a lot easier is now in 

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.240
 Battlefield 3 I think so 

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:41.860
 not necessarily his in handling 

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.340
 with the weapons is already a lot 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.230
 difficult 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:46.180
 then of course I have started 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:47.860
 because the a94 is not known 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.330
 won I have ran just once 

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:51.490
 set the first steps with this 

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.380
 weapon done and mercilessly wrong 

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:55.300
 shot is of course a bit 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.400
 harder with this weapon then 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.380
 Of course I realized she also has one 

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.330
 Fully automatic mode I have 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.850
 directly activated and therefore had 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.040
 already say okay the standard essay 

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:08.230
 is total bullshit but if you too 

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:09.040
 other towers used like the pks 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.660
 hollo sight 

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.040
 I have to say it does already 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.380
 a lot of fun with it 

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:16.240
 it's of course 34 modes 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:17.830
 All in all, we will of course come to 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:20.200
 first and of course that's just one 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.210
 Of course, the ball is the one ball 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.770
 and compatible list mix but me 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:26.170
 must also say from time to time you can use it 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.790
 happy kills then join in 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:30.460
 of course the two burst mode 

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:32.440
 which of course is the main engine mode 

00:05:30.460 --> 00:05:34.660
 on this weapon and there I am so 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:36.130
 thought are not necessarily 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.600
 then I have a little bit 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:39.400
 with it felt pure and had 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.320
 pretty quickly realized that it was 

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.540
 actually not that bad 

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.760
 especially for the higher is the distance 

00:05:43.540 --> 00:05:46.810
 Definitely suitable then 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:48.520
 Of course there is still the 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.990
 fully automatic mode and that is 

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.180
 of course very effective for 

00:05:49.990 --> 00:05:55.000
 close quarter so for the short 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:56.980
 reach just like this team 

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.390
 deathmatch on the map still sha channels 

00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:00.280
 it really is perfect for that 

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.490
 suitable because usually the distance 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.170
 to the opponent short to mediocre for the 

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:06.940
 higher distance is recommended then 

00:06:05.170 --> 00:06:09.550
 in my opinion definitely that 

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:11.620
 pk 1 hollo visier as much as for everyone 

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:13.240
 other things even if you of course 

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:15.100
 have a gameplay where you really only 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.510
 for the short distance plays there 

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:18.190
 of course, I recommend you one of the 

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.980
 red dot like her but mine 

00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:24.130
 mindset from that time is simply the 

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.840
 heavy run the 21 under still the pk 

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:27.910
 as hollo visier is one for me 

00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:29.560
 really great mix in this 

00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:30.680
 game play I have even the 

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.810
 run heavy 

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:35.720
 used , of course, is quite similar 

00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:37.280
 but I have to say so much 

00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:38.990
 has changed in my opinion 

00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.940
 For that really is not the weapon 

00:06:38.990 --> 00:06:43.070
 really very precise and also has one 

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:44.720
 really hurt quite beautiful I what 

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:47.330
 just noticed that the weapon 

00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:48.710
 middle to higher distance already 

00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:50.419
 was quite far to the left and right 

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.620
 bad and partly upwards 

00:06:50.419 --> 00:06:52.220
 if you use the fully automatic mode 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.509
 used 

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:55.520
 and you just have to learn 

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:57.350
 you can really counter that 

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:59.449
 good with this weapon as I said mine 

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.699
 setup the pks hollo visier 

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.259
 two legs and heavier running 

00:07:01.699 --> 00:07:06.020
 this weapon is a really good one 

00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:07.580
 combo, which of course has to be said is 

00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.289
 Not everyone is good with this weapon 

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.789
 But if you deal makes you time 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:11.479
 then that is pretty much in any case 

00:07:10.789 --> 00:07:12.940
 well clear 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.050
 I say goodbye to you now 

00:07:12.940 --> 00:07:15.800
 comment on and do not rate anyone 

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:17.419
 fall forgotten 

00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:19.520
 I am instructed to do this 

00:07:17.419 --> 00:07:23.020
 series really nice keeps running 

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.020
 Have a nice day
