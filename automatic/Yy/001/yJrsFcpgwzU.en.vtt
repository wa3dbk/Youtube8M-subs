00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
now my design for this channel was

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.290 
now my design for this channel was
purely<00:00:23.910> based<00:00:24.210> upon<00:00:24.720> pc<00:00:25.439> vs<00:00:25.890> mac<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.519> lately

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
purely based upon pc vs mac but lately

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.550 
purely based upon pc vs mac but lately
gopen<00:00:28.170> some<00:00:28.680> people<00:00:29.130> that<00:00:29.279> left<00:00:29.640> the<00:00:30.560> argument

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
gopen some people that left the argument

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.959 
gopen some people that left the argument
which<00:00:31.679> has<00:00:31.890> caused<00:00:32.550> me<00:00:33.030> to<00:00:33.480> well<00:00:34.640> you<00:00:35.640> know<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
which has caused me to well you know to

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:39.319 
which has caused me to well you know to
switch<00:00:36.960> my<00:00:37.200> view<00:00:37.500> towards<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.070> channel<00:00:38.520> now<00:00:38.969> i

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
