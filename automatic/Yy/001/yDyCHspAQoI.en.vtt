00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.270
 everyone we make today she had one 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.720
 new series that I am going to start there is 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:20.640
 red the old lady or juventus 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.070
 a lot of people used to have a red one too 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 a club was going to do and I thought so 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.669
 from her why well everybody does it 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.860
 well so it is no longer original but 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:30.750
 nevertheless many people want it and then i go 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.220
 just keep it up because you have to 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.920
 of course have fun to go to 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.560
 and so we're going to be a very uphantis 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.430
 make team in line up 352 we go 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:44.310
 buy every player who can buy it 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.420
 And yes, let's see if there is anything already 

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.270
 players can come we can 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.830
 of course what players buy I have 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:53.400
 4k what I apparently remember from all those times 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:57.030
 by viva 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.820
 got out that you were on the web 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.970
 app that can always get free coin 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.559
 so that certainly not wrong 4k to get there 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.950
 to start with may be possible 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.750
 buy some nice players from 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.650
 let's just take a look with the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.940
 first defenders 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.480
 I'm going to accelerate this by the way 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.560
 maybe a little better us took too long 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:22.050
 as you just could see i have one 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.670
 few players bought and that cheeks two 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.980
 defenders that we go into it 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:30.650
 put so replace play club search 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.320
 We bought the police from your ventus 

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.080
 and we will also replace this time 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.170
 for you 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.880
 plush something play lucio 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.080
 In addition, we have a legal smith 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.510
 and links with bought also not too expensive 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.940
 players but always chill in you 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.610
 team to have we get like a mola 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:55.430
 certainly good play is that and what it 2 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:58.790
 also pointed how should we go 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.840
 replaced and that are oriente and 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.150
 July 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.400
 culiair yes i really have no idea how that 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:07.810
 name do you say yes 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.560
 cleo you had it but we already have it 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.440
 nice 

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:15.890
 team of juventus all the way through now 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:17.660
 the first game and here 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:20.960
 our first opponent evening not already 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:22.880
 too much team spirit but we have that 

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.370
 of course not we have but 74 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.900
 And yes then it will always be a tricky one 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.720
 knew the hatred itself a reasonable team 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.120
 at ricoh and the disco 

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:33.200
 the two had so top players of his team 

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.910
 tell me otherwise golden 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.730
 players and 2 bronze but this match 

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:43.370
 you or through was really a match what 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.320
 just who just doesn't like playing it 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.480
 is just so annoying against such 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.250
 people play all but also all 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.739
 have the luck of the world 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:54.440
 i had quite a few chances i have yes 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:56.300
 parking next to shot so and then 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.709
 he here they first attack the 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.950
 match the first 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:03.200
 and I think that you are right 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.400
 finally seeing 14 is the no longer me 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:07.400
 that bullshit of 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.209
 that every time that bullshit goals 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.970
 against it 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.470
 but unfortunately there are still because 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.030
 as you see here with keeper me 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 don't know what ideas her tries 

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:20.030
 pull ball up and on one of one 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:23.120
 vague way then goes back to its peak 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.800
 come true and who 's in this this well 

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:26.450
 what you just saw those chances are the 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:28.550
 greatest opportunities I have I get 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:30.680
 just no better chances than he 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.560
 of course again with an attack and 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:36.290
 yes say it but this keeper is just 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.780
 drama the ball comes straight at him he 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.310
 Markers really became very bad at it 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:42.500
 yet he had it in or mackeeper 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:43.310
 apparently a bronze player and who can 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.500
 total headers 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.689
 but luckily come back with laurey and 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.180
 to that of course 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:53.030
 has good heads and as you know 

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.859
 headlines have been overpowed in this game 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:58.040
 and standard three were so happy one 

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:59.780
 but pretty soon afterwards 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.139
 yes it was actually over with the 

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:02.540
 fun 

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.069
 because he just walks quietly through here 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:05.959
 but there is nothing wrong with defense 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:08.780
 Schiedam is just one round the far 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.939
 corner and yes with keeper is just total 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.180
 but also totally without chance 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:16.190
 I actually thought I'd get better sooner 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:18.650
 or two mean I actually had first 

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.690
 their purpose we should buy instead of 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:22.310
 those players that I am now planning 

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:24.320
 really a bronze goalkeeper that is true 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.300
 dramatic look what he is doing here he 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:29.810
 comes out for a moment then he goes again 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:32.360
 back and this dot from 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.919
 not even five meters from the cabbage goes there 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.810
 just in to things I am less than 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:37.880
 really was me 

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:42.349
 how the hell do you get that done 

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:44.270
 goalkeeper seriously and yes if I have one 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:46.940
 attack I score happy with red 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:48.800
 drove is still but in the end yes always 

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:52.310
 pretty little useful anymore because we had 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.720
 already quite far behind with 5 2 

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:56.090
 in a second half, I was quite something 

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:58.010
 but it's better that you get it 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:00.409
 Do not finish chances like this one 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.570
 on one that just need 100% in but 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.130
 again because I happen to be a source 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.690
 play had it wrong again 

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:07.159
 the real oriente I don't know what the idea is 

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:10.250
 but shot in minutes and then the 

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:11.750
 rowboat on the pole and yes it was just 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:14.720
 this match not yet I have to 

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:16.370
 just get used to this team 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:19.430
 the 352 setup is of course not 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.870
 always overpowerd more 

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:22.610
 yes we will of course go for the next one 

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:24.139
 episode we are going to do our best but kobe 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.120
 liked it give a thumbs up 

00:05:24.139 --> 00:05:27.560

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.300
