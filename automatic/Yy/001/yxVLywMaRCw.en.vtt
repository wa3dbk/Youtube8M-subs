the decision on the scorecards it's

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.670 
the decision on the scorecards it's
awful<00:03:48.450> to<00:03:48.480> see<00:03:48.780> that<00:03:48.989> but<00:03:49.200> again

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
awful to see that but again

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:51.199 
awful to see that but again
nice<00:03:49.980> to<00:03:50.159> see<00:03:50.340> that<00:03:50.370> he'll<00:03:50.609> get<00:03:50.760> a<00:03:50.819> second

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:51.209

crack<00:03:51.450> the<00:03:51.900> question<00:03:52.349> though<00:03:52.500> is<00:03:52.530> is<00:03:52.859> he<00:03:53.280> did

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
crack the question though is is he did

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.520 
crack the question though is is he did
he<00:03:53.939> fight<00:03:54.150> the<00:03:54.299> fight<00:03:54.510> of<00:03:54.629> his<00:03:54.689> life<00:03:54.750> did<00:03:55.439> he

get his ceiling in the first fight right

00:03:57.359 --> 00:03:59.089 
get his ceiling in the first fight right
and<00:03:57.599> the<00:03:57.750> answer<00:03:57.870> is<00:03:58.079> if<00:03:58.379> he<00:03:58.500> did<00:03:58.680> he's<00:03:58.890> in<00:03:59.040> a

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
and the answer is if he did he's in a

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:00.380 
and the answer is if he did he's in a
lot<00:03:59.189> of<00:03:59.250> trouble<00:03:59.609> but<00:03:59.700> the<00:03:59.819> answer<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.090> if<00:04:00.359> not

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:00.390 
lot of trouble but the answer is if not

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:03.140 
lot of trouble but the answer is if not
only<00:04:00.930> he<00:04:01.079> can<00:04:01.290> sort<00:04:01.799> of<00:04:01.890> you<00:04:02.280> know<00:04:02.310> rekindle

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:03.150 
only he can sort of you know rekindle

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:05.599 
only he can sort of you know rekindle
that<00:04:03.329> fight<00:04:03.719> but<00:04:03.930> maybe<00:04:04.170> even<00:04:04.409> surpass<00:04:04.920> it<00:04:05.250> now

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:05.609 
that fight but maybe even surpass it now

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:07.369 
that fight but maybe even surpass it now
he's<00:04:05.909> dealing<00:04:06.299> with<00:04:06.329> the<00:04:06.510> proper<00:04:06.870> weight<00:04:07.079> now

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
he's dealing with the proper weight now

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.170 
he's dealing with the proper weight now
he's<00:04:07.650> dealing<00:04:08.040> with<00:04:08.189> rounds<00:04:08.819> that<00:04:08.909> he<00:04:09.030> can

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
he's dealing with rounds that he can

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:10.459 
he's dealing with rounds that he can
predict<00:04:09.510> and<00:04:09.689> there<00:04:09.959> isn't<00:04:10.230> all<00:04:10.319> those

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:10.469 
predict and there isn't all those

00:04:10.469 --> 00:04:11.720 
predict and there isn't all those
outside<00:04:10.920> things<00:04:11.189> so<00:04:11.310> it's<00:04:11.430> going<00:04:11.519> to<00:04:11.579> be<00:04:11.670> a

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:11.730 
outside things so it's going to be a

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:12.920 
outside things so it's going to be a
really<00:04:12.030> interesting<00:04:12.299> one<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:12.689> could<00:04:12.810> be<00:04:12.900> a

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
really interesting one it could be a

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.509 
really interesting one it could be a
changing<00:04:13.319> in<00:04:13.409> the<00:04:13.439> guard<00:04:13.680> down<00:04:13.859> yeah<00:04:14.159> I<00:04:14.189> do

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:14.519 
changing in the guard down yeah I do

00:04:14.519 --> 00:04:16.279 
changing in the guard down yeah I do
think<00:04:14.939> that<00:04:15.000> we<00:04:15.329> should<00:04:15.569> be<00:04:15.599> careful<00:04:15.870> of<00:04:16.109> what

00:04:16.279 --> 00:04:16.289 
think that we should be careful of what

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:18.439 
think that we should be careful of what
we<00:04:16.470> criticize<00:04:16.979> Chavez<00:04:17.519> for<00:04:17.729> yeah<00:04:17.940> he<00:04:18.120> got<00:04:18.269> all

00:04:18.439 --> 00:04:18.449 
we criticize Chavez for yeah he got all

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:20.569 
we criticize Chavez for yeah he got all
the<00:04:18.600> advantages<00:04:19.109> in<00:04:19.259> the<00:04:19.350> world<00:04:19.560> in<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:20.310> first

00:04:20.569 --> 00:04:20.579 
the advantages in the world in the first

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:22.670 
the advantages in the world in the first
pipe<00:04:20.820> and<00:04:21.030> but<00:04:21.570> at<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:21.810> same<00:04:22.019> time<00:04:22.199> we<00:04:22.470> talked

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:22.680 
pipe and but at the same time we talked

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.200 
pipe and but at the same time we talked
about<00:04:22.830> ceilings<00:04:23.400> I<00:04:23.520> mentioned<00:04:23.849> it<00:04:23.910> with<00:04:24.000> brian

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
about ceilings I mentioned it with brian

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:25.790 
about ceilings I mentioned it with brian
vera<00:04:24.479> is<00:04:24.660> this<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.020> best<00:04:25.199> that<00:04:25.320> he'll<00:04:25.500> ever<00:04:25.710> be

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
vera is this the best that he'll ever be

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.070 
vera is this the best that he'll ever be
this<00:04:26.639> is<00:04:26.789> probably<00:04:27.060> better<00:04:27.479> than<00:04:27.780> what<00:04:27.960> we

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
this is probably better than what we

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.379 
this is probably better than what we
imagined<00:04:28.620> Julio<00:04:28.889> Cesar<00:04:29.160> Chavez<00:04:29.460> Jr<00:04:29.699> to<00:04:30.210> be<00:04:30.300> and

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:30.389 
imagined Julio Cesar Chavez Jr to be and

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:31.850 
imagined Julio Cesar Chavez Jr to be and
this<00:04:30.449> is<00:04:30.570> probably<00:04:30.690> better<00:04:31.139> than<00:04:31.680> what

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:31.860 
this is probably better than what

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.890 
this is probably better than what
top-ranked<00:04:32.370> envisioned<00:04:32.880> him<00:04:33.060> to<00:04:33.479> ever<00:04:33.660> be

keep<00:04:34.110> in<00:04:34.199> mind<00:04:34.380> this<00:04:34.530> isn't<00:04:34.770> the<00:04:34.830> first<00:04:35.070> time

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
keep in mind this isn't the first time

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:37.040 
keep in mind this isn't the first time
that<00:04:35.370> he<00:04:35.610> struggled<00:04:36.090> against<00:04:36.539> a<00:04:36.599> journeyman

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.050 
that he struggled against a journeyman

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:38.570 
that he struggled against a journeyman
on<00:04:37.139> the<00:04:37.259> way<00:04:37.380> up<00:04:37.590> he<00:04:37.740> did<00:04:37.860> the<00:04:37.949> same<00:04:38.130> thing<00:04:38.160> with

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:38.580 
on the way up he did the same thing with

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.249 
on the way up he did the same thing with
matt<00:04:38.820> van<00:04:39.090> de<00:04:39.270> did<00:04:39.630> the<00:04:39.750> same<00:04:39.930> thing<00:04:39.960> with

00:04:40.249 --> 00:04:40.259 
matt van de did the same thing with

00:04:40.259 --> 00:04:41.900 
matt van de did the same thing with
Carlos<00:04:40.590> Molina<00:04:40.889> when<00:04:41.190> he<00:04:41.310> was<00:04:41.400> in<00:04:41.490> that<00:04:41.610> status

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
Carlos Molina when he was in that status

Carlos Molina when he was in that status
even<00:04:42.270> though<00:04:42.479> he's<00:04:42.660> a<00:04:42.690> world<00:04:43.169> champion<00:04:43.259> now<00:04:43.830> we

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:44.400 
even though he's a world champion now we

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.040 
even though he's a world champion now we
didn't<00:04:44.669> think<00:04:44.849> that<00:04:45.030> Chavez<00:04:45.389> would<00:04:45.570> ever<00:04:45.750> even

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
didn't think that Chavez would ever even

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.960 
didn't think that Chavez would ever even
get<00:04:46.530> to<00:04:46.740> this<00:04:46.889> point<00:04:47.190> so<00:04:47.400> he<00:04:47.490> should<00:04:47.699> be<00:04:47.849> given

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:47.970 
get to this point so he should be given

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.820 
get to this point so he should be given
some<00:04:48.240> credit<00:04:48.599> for<00:04:48.960> even<00:04:48.990> being<00:04:49.349> in<00:04:49.680> this

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:49.830 
some credit for even being in this

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:51.800 
some credit for even being in this
position<00:04:50.070> if<00:04:50.580> this<00:04:51.060> happens<00:04:51.389> to<00:04:51.449> be<00:04:51.570> the<00:04:51.690> end
