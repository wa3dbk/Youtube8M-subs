00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:26.490 
this is a older set and there's a lot of

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.000 
this is a older set and there's a lot of
videos<00:00:27.420> already<00:00:27.869> out<00:00:28.050> there<00:00:28.199> on<00:00:28.380> YouTube<00:00:28.740> but

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
I've been going through and redoing some

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:34.280 
I've been going through and redoing some
of<00:00:31.619> my<00:00:31.790> lego<00:00:32.790> sets<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.540> reposting<00:00:34.170> new

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290

one of those so real quick demonstration
of<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.059> features<00:00:39.390> on<00:00:39.600> this<00:00:39.750> thing<00:00:40.340> does<00:00:41.340> have

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
of the features on this thing does have

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.490 
of the features on this thing does have
power<00:00:41.790> functions<00:00:42.270> included<00:00:42.780> but<00:00:42.960> we'll<00:00:43.469> show

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
power functions included but we'll show

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.950 
power functions included but we'll show
those<00:00:43.829> here<00:00:43.980> in<00:00:44.010> a<00:00:44.070> second<00:00:44.430> but<00:00:44.510> it<00:00:45.510> does<00:00:45.719> lift

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
those here in a second but it does lift

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:51.549 
those here in a second but it does lift
up<00:00:46.170> here<00:00:47.000> and<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.390> back<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:49.910> hatch<00:00:50.910> or<00:00:51.239> the

00:00:51.549 --> 00:00:51.559 
up here and in the back the hatch or the

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:54.950 
up here and in the back the hatch or the
tailgate<00:00:52.559> opens<00:00:52.920> up<00:00:53.039> there<00:00:53.250> and<00:00:54.180> then<00:00:54.690> it<00:00:54.809> does

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
tailgate opens up there and then it does

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.229 
tailgate opens up there and then it does
have<00:00:54.989> those<00:00:55.320> gullwing<00:00:55.980> or<00:00:56.250> Lamborghini<00:00:56.910> type

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
have those gullwing or Lamborghini type

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.650 
have those gullwing or Lamborghini type
doors<00:00:57.539> on<00:00:57.870> each<00:00:58.410> side<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.059> they<00:01:00.059> open<00:01:00.359> up<00:01:00.449> like

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
doors on each side so they open up like

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.060 
doors on each side so they open up like
that<00:01:00.899> there<00:01:01.199> there's<00:01:01.410> a<00:01:01.469> little<00:01:01.680> knob<00:01:01.859> up

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
that there there's a little knob up

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.660 
that there there's a little knob up
there<00:01:02.250> that<00:01:02.370> you<00:01:02.520> touch<00:01:02.730> and<00:01:04.369> I'll<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.519> if<00:01:05.610> I

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
there that you touch and I'll see if I

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.940 
there that you touch and I'll see if I
can<00:01:05.760> get<00:01:05.850> in<00:01:05.939> here<00:01:06.240> but<00:01:06.659> those<00:01:06.810> work<00:01:07.080> via<00:01:07.409> a<00:01:07.530> big

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
can get in here but those work via a big

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.580 
can get in here but those work via a big
pneumatic<00:01:08.729> cylinder<00:01:09.270> right<00:01:09.479> here<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:10.020> it's

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
pneumatic cylinder right here and it's

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.510 
pneumatic cylinder right here and it's
got<00:01:10.830> a<00:01:11.490> very<00:01:11.700> small<00:01:12.119> bleed<00:01:12.720> hole<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.320> it's

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
got a very small bleed hole and it's

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.399 
got a very small bleed hole and it's
spring-assisted<00:01:14.520> so<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.570> there<00:01:15.869> there<00:01:16.140> are<00:01:16.259> no

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
spring-assisted so it there there are no

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.370 
spring-assisted so it there there are no
pneumatics<00:01:17.070> attached<00:01:17.490> to<00:01:17.759> it<00:01:17.909> it's<00:01:18.360> just<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
pneumatics attached to it it's just the

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.469 
pneumatics attached to it it's just the
way<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> cylinder<00:01:20.100> is<00:01:20.340> built<00:01:20.580> so<00:01:20.850> it<00:01:21.150> works

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
way that cylinder is built so it works

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:28.370 
way that cylinder is built so it works
really<00:01:21.689> nicely<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:24.570> then<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:27.140> set<00:01:28.140> you

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
really nicely and then this was set you

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.080 
really nicely and then this was set you
won't<00:01:28.530> be<00:01:28.619> able<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.799> see<00:01:28.979> it<00:01:29.070> here<00:01:29.100> because

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
won't be able to see it here because

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940 
won't be able to see it here because
we're<00:01:30.270> outside<00:01:30.659> with<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.140> really<00:01:31.619> good<00:01:31.770> light

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
we're outside with a really good light

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.100 
we're outside with a really good light
but<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.340> headlights<00:01:32.850> here<00:01:33.090> have<00:01:33.299> those<00:01:33.570> LED

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
but the headlights here have those LED

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.859 
but the headlights here have those LED
lights<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:34.619> there<00:01:34.799> it's<00:01:35.700> got<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> working<00:01:36.420> winch

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
lights in there it's got a working winch

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.590 
lights in there it's got a working winch
on<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.170> front<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.560> goes<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> and<00:01:38.100> out<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
on the front that goes in and out and

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.780 
on the front that goes in and out and
then<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.900> guess<00:01:40.229> the<00:01:40.470> key<00:01:40.829> feature<00:01:41.130> on<00:01:41.460> it<00:01:41.490> is

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
then I guess the key feature on it is

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:44.749 
then I guess the key feature on it is
the<00:01:42.750> overall<00:01:43.079> suspension<00:01:43.860> will<00:01:44.040> go<00:01:44.220> up<00:01:44.430> and

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
the overall suspension will go up and

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.210 
the overall suspension will go up and
down<00:01:45.060> not<00:01:45.329> very<00:01:45.630> much<00:01:45.869> maybe<00:01:46.200> about<00:01:46.500> a<00:01:46.560> half<00:01:46.680> of

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
down not very much maybe about a half of

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.679 
down not very much maybe about a half of
an<00:01:47.340> inch<00:01:47.460> or<00:01:47.759> maybe<00:01:47.909> through<00:01:48.450> four

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
an inch or maybe through four

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.780 
an inch or maybe through four
centimeters<00:01:49.229> but<00:01:49.829> it<00:01:49.950> only<00:01:50.070> goes<00:01:50.280> up<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.670> down

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
centimeters but it only goes up and down

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.310 
centimeters but it only goes up and down
so<00:01:51.000> we'll<00:01:51.119> do<00:01:51.240> a<00:01:51.270> quick<00:01:51.540> demonstration<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so we'll do a quick demonstration of

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.580 
so we'll do a quick demonstration of
that<00:01:53.060> so<00:01:54.060> we'll<00:01:54.180> turn<00:01:54.360> it<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> and<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.560> believe

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
that so we'll turn it on and I believe

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.499 
that so we'll turn it on and I believe
it<00:01:56.009> is<00:01:56.100> in<00:01:56.250> its<00:01:56.399> lowered<00:01:56.700> position<00:01:57.149> now<00:01:57.329> so

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:57.509 
it is in its lowered position now so

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:58.850 
it is in its lowered position now so
we're<00:01:57.659> going<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.869> raise<00:01:58.259> it<00:01:58.290> here<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.710> little

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
we're going to raise it here a little

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.109 
we're going to raise it here a little
bit<00:01:59.899> see<00:02:00.899> if<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.140> will<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.380> up

00:02:04.109 --> 00:02:04.119 

00:02:04.119 --> 00:02:09.309 

so<00:02:05.119> it<00:02:05.210> is<00:02:05.360> moving<00:02:05.659> now<00:02:07.869> and<00:02:08.869> then<00:02:09.170> it's

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
so it is moving now and then it's

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:09.790 
so it is moving now and then it's
full-up

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
full-up

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.280 
full-up
and<00:02:10.239> then<00:02:11.239> we<00:02:11.330> just<00:02:11.510> shift<00:02:11.660> that<00:02:11.840> lever<00:02:12.080> there

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
and then we just shift that lever there

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.990 
and then we just shift that lever there
and<00:02:12.500> it'll<00:02:12.650> go<00:02:12.770> back<00:02:13.130> down<00:02:15.130> and<00:02:16.130> it<00:02:16.940> is<00:02:18.790> all<00:02:19.790> the

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
and it'll go back down and it is all the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.930 
and it'll go back down and it is all the
way<00:02:20.120> back<00:02:20.330> down<00:02:21.400> okay<00:02:22.400> and<00:02:22.519> then<00:02:22.640> one<00:02:22.760> of<00:02:22.880> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
way back down okay and then one of the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.120 
way back down okay and then one of the
other<00:02:23.090> power<00:02:23.810> function<00:02:24.319> features<00:02:24.709> is<00:02:24.950> this

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
other power function features is this

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.180 
other power function features is this
crank<00:02:25.430> or<00:02:25.580> this<00:02:25.790> winch<00:02:26.060> on<00:02:26.239> the<00:02:26.269> front<00:02:27.160> so<00:02:28.160> we

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
crank or this winch on the front so we

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.670 
crank or this winch on the front so we
will<00:02:28.580> extend<00:02:29.390> it<00:02:29.540> out<00:02:29.630> here<00:02:32.440> and<00:02:33.440> then<00:02:33.590> you

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
will extend it out here and then you

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.100 
will extend it out here and then you
just<00:02:33.709> flip<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.190> knob<00:02:34.340> here<00:02:34.670> and<00:02:34.850> it<00:02:35.110> pulls

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
just flip the knob here and it pulls

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.400 
just flip the knob here and it pulls
itself<00:02:36.260> back<00:02:36.709> in<00:02:37.780> so<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:38.959> really<00:02:39.140> about<00:02:39.350> it

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:39.410 
itself back in so that's really about it

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.930 
itself back in so that's really about it
on<00:02:39.680> the<00:02:39.769> power<00:02:39.920> functions<00:02:40.400> that<00:02:40.549> came<00:02:40.700> with<00:02:40.910> it

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
on the power functions that came with it

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.270 
on the power functions that came with it
now<00:02:41.180> keep<00:02:41.450> in<00:02:41.569> mind<00:02:41.780> this<00:02:42.410> is<00:02:42.620> a<00:02:42.650> really<00:02:43.040> really

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
now keep in mind this is a really really

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.020 
now keep in mind this is a really really
large<00:02:43.430> set

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
large set

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.910 
large set

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
I forgot my ruler today but this set is

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.900 
I forgot my ruler today but this set is
probably<00:02:46.100> about<00:02:46.519> 16<00:02:47.330> 17<00:02:47.720> inches<00:02:48.230> long<00:02:48.290> and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
probably about 16 17 inches long and

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.910 
probably about 16 17 inches long and
it's<00:02:49.910> just<00:02:50.000> very<00:02:50.269> very<00:02:50.390> big<00:02:50.840> and<00:02:51.019> it<00:02:51.440> has<00:02:51.560> a<00:02:51.590> lot

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
it's just very very big and it has a lot

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.110 
it's just very very big and it has a lot
of<00:02:51.950> open<00:02:52.400> space<00:02:53.349> back<00:02:54.349> here<00:02:54.380> in<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.769> back<00:02:55.120> so
