00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.129 
fear I sent you a text comments about my
solution<00:00:11.160> being<00:00:12.030> slightly<00:00:12.420> different<00:00:12.929> from

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
solution being slightly different from

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.480 
solution being slightly different from
yours<00:00:13.380> and<00:00:13.650> you<00:00:13.710> asked<00:00:13.860> that<00:00:14.070> I<00:00:14.099> create<00:00:14.460> a

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
yours and you asked that I create a

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.420 
yours and you asked that I create a
video<00:00:14.730> or<00:00:15.179> somehow<00:00:15.809> showing<00:00:16.350> you<00:00:16.470> how<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.250> do

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
video or somehow showing you how to do

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.900 
video or somehow showing you how to do
it<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.820> this<00:00:18.119> is<00:00:18.150> that<00:00:18.980> like<00:00:19.980> I<00:00:20.130> said<00:00:20.369> it<00:00:20.520> starts

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
it so this is that like I said it starts

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.450 
it so this is that like I said it starts
out<00:00:21.029> the<00:00:21.240> same<00:00:21.270> way<00:00:21.480> with<00:00:22.070> orange<00:00:23.070> and<00:00:23.220> green

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
out the same way with orange and green

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.250 
out the same way with orange and green
coming<00:00:23.850> out<00:00:23.939> first<00:00:24.240> but<00:00:24.510> then<00:00:24.660> it<00:00:24.720> changes

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
coming out first but then it changes

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.099 
coming out first but then it changes
slightly<00:00:25.730> so<00:00:26.730> I<00:00:26.760> will<00:00:27.090> just<00:00:27.119> get<00:00:27.810> it<00:00:27.960> to<00:00:28.080> that

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
slightly so I will just get it to that

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:49.540 
slightly so I will just get it to that
point<00:00:36.649> if<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.890> lets<00:00:38.190> me

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:49.550 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:01:13.539 

ok<00:00:50.550> now<00:00:51.030> is<00:00:51.180> retarded

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:13.549 

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:18.550 

okay<00:01:14.549> so<00:01:16.039> orange<00:01:17.039> and<00:01:17.189> green<00:01:17.310> are<00:01:17.490> out<00:01:17.640> and

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
okay so orange and green are out and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.830 
okay so orange and green are out and
you're<00:01:19.560> left<00:01:19.740> in<00:01:19.920> this<00:01:20.039> position<00:01:20.840> normally

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
you're left in this position normally

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.620 
you're left in this position normally
you<00:01:22.829> know<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.070> yellow<00:01:23.429> would<00:01:23.700> come<00:01:24.240> up<00:01:24.450> and

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
you know the yellow would come up and

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.590 
you know the yellow would come up and
around<00:01:24.869> like<00:01:25.289> that<00:01:26.060> but<00:01:27.060> what<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.450> do<00:01:27.600> is<00:01:29.600> the

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
around like that but what I do is the

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.620 
around like that but what I do is the
red<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.170> purple<00:01:31.970> slide<00:01:32.970> all<00:01:33.149> the<00:01:33.179> way<00:01:33.299> over<00:01:33.600> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
red and purple slide all the way over to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.850 
red and purple slide all the way over to
the<00:01:33.810> right<00:01:34.020> and<00:01:34.259> such<00:01:36.020> move<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.229> yellow<00:01:37.500> to

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
the right and such move the yellow to

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.779 
the right and such move the yellow to
the<00:01:37.950> back<00:01:38.130> position<00:01:38.700> and<00:01:39.229> you<00:01:40.229> bring<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:41.549> red

00:01:41.779 --> 00:01:41.789 
the back position and you bring the red

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:44.600 
the back position and you bring the red
and<00:01:41.909> purple<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.509> front<00:01:42.840> and<00:01:43.250> slide<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.280> up

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
and purple to the front and slide it up

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.859 
and purple to the front and slide it up
so<00:01:45.569> it<00:01:45.689> locks<00:01:45.869> in<00:01:46.140> like<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:47.479> the<00:01:48.479> purple

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
so it locks in like that and the purple

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.760 
so it locks in like that and the purple
slides<00:01:49.170> out<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.709> the<00:01:50.490> red<00:01:50.670> slides<00:01:51.030> down<00:01:51.360> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
slides out and the red slides down and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.130 
slides out and the red slides down and
this<00:01:52.770> is<00:01:52.950> the<00:01:53.099> position<00:01:53.310> that<00:01:53.759> it's<00:01:53.970> in<00:01:54.179> when

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this is the position that it's in when

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.960 
this is the position that it's in when
you<00:01:55.319> initially<00:01:55.860> take<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.459> orange<00:01:56.789> piece

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:56.970 
you initially take out the orange piece

00:01:56.970 --> 00:01:59.630 
you initially take out the orange piece
and<00:01:57.270> the<00:01:57.330> green<00:01:57.569> is<00:01:57.750> back<00:01:57.959> here<00:01:58.319> and<00:01:58.520> with<00:01:59.520> the

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
and the green is back here and with the

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.899 
and the green is back here and with the
green<00:01:59.880> back<00:02:00.090> there<00:02:00.390> the<00:02:01.170> purple<00:02:01.799> bumps<00:02:02.789> up

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
green back there the purple bumps up

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.910 
green back there the purple bumps up
against<00:02:03.299> it<00:02:03.420> you<00:02:03.539> can't<00:02:03.810> get<00:02:03.929> it<00:02:03.959> out<00:02:04.110> but<00:02:04.649> with

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:04.920 
against it you can't get it out but with

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:07.669 
against it you can't get it out but with
the<00:02:05.099> green<00:02:05.340> gone<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:06.479> purple<00:02:06.899> can<00:02:07.140> now<00:02:07.259> slide

00:02:07.669 --> 00:02:07.679 
the green gone the purple can now slide

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:10.940 
the green gone the purple can now slide
completely<00:02:08.579> off<00:02:08.729> and<00:02:09.090> then<00:02:09.929> as<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:10.530> can<00:02:10.560> see

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
completely off and then as you can see

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.870 
completely off and then as you can see
the<00:02:11.280> red<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.970> yellow<00:02:12.049> are<00:02:13.549> easily<00:02:14.549> removed

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
the red and yellow are easily removed

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.740 
the red and yellow are easily removed
and<00:02:15.299> thereafter<00:02:16.040> okay<00:02:17.090> so<00:02:18.090> that's<00:02:18.480> my

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:18.750 
and thereafter okay so that's my

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.080 
and thereafter okay so that's my
solution<00:02:19.049> it's<00:02:19.739> like<00:02:20.579> I<00:02:20.670> said<00:02:20.850> it's<00:02:20.970> just

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
solution it's like I said it's just

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.680 
solution it's like I said it's just
slightly<00:02:21.480> different<00:02:23.120> again<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> don't<00:02:24.420> know<00:02:24.540> if

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
slightly different again I don't know if

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.050 
slightly different again I don't know if
it's<00:02:24.840> easier<00:02:25.739> or<00:02:26.010> less<00:02:26.340> moves<00:02:26.639> per<00:02:27.000> se<00:02:27.319> but

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
it's easier or less moves per se but

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.780 
it's easier or less moves per se but
I've<00:02:30.470> been<00:02:31.470> doing<00:02:31.739> it<00:02:31.859> this<00:02:31.980> way<00:02:32.040> ever<00:02:32.400> since<00:02:32.489> i

I've been doing it this way ever since i
got<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.120> puzzle<00:02:33.480> occasionally<00:02:34.230> I'll<00:02:34.380> do<00:02:34.530> it

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.520 
got the puzzle occasionally I'll do it
the<00:02:35.459> book<00:02:35.639> way<00:02:35.850> and<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.660> way<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.810> saw<00:02:37.139> you<00:02:37.200> do<00:02:37.500> it

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
on your video but yeah that's pretty

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.110 
on your video but yeah that's pretty
much<00:02:41.609> it<00:02:41.670> what<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.540> asked<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.489> let<00:02:45.090> me
