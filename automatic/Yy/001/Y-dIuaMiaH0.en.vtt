welcome<00:00:05.230> back<00:00:05.470> in<00:00:05.800> this<00:00:06.010> session<00:00:06.189> we're<00:00:06.580> going

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670 
welcome back in this session we're going

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.610 
welcome back in this session we're going
to<00:00:06.729> be<00:00:06.790> learning<00:00:07.270> how<00:00:07.569> to<00:00:07.599> set<00:00:07.930> up<00:00:08.050> our<00:00:08.260> stock

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:08.620 
to be learning how to set up our stock

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:11.040 
to be learning how to set up our stock
so<00:00:09.099> we<00:00:09.429> briefly<00:00:09.940> went<00:00:10.059> through<00:00:10.540> this<00:00:10.690> in<00:00:10.929> our

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.050 
so we briefly went through this in our

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.050 
so we briefly went through this in our
first<00:00:11.290> chapter<00:00:11.500> in<00:00:11.860> the<00:00:12.040> intro<00:00:12.430> to<00:00:12.460> lathe<00:00:12.820> and

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:13.060 
first chapter in the intro to lathe and

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.880 
first chapter in the intro to lathe and
then<00:00:14.019> we're<00:00:14.140> gonna<00:00:14.230> get<00:00:14.410> started<00:00:14.560> on<00:00:14.860> that

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:14.890 
then we're gonna get started on that

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.279 
then we're gonna get started on that
with<00:00:15.370> our<00:00:15.640> exercise<00:00:16.029> so<00:00:16.449> you<00:00:16.539> can<00:00:16.720> learn<00:00:16.900> and

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
with our exercise so you can learn and

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.589 
with our exercise so you can learn and
understand<00:00:18.189> it<00:00:18.340> a<00:00:18.369> little<00:00:18.550> bit<00:00:18.699> better<00:00:18.880> now

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:19.599 
understand it a little bit better now

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:21.089 
understand it a little bit better now
let's<00:00:19.869> set<00:00:19.990> up<00:00:20.019> our<00:00:20.230> machine<00:00:20.560> type<00:00:20.769> which<00:00:20.949> is

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:21.099 
let's set up our machine type which is

00:00:21.099 --> 00:00:23.009 
let's set up our machine type which is
gonna<00:00:21.249> be<00:00:21.460> late<00:00:21.669> so<00:00:21.970> I'll<00:00:22.570> go<00:00:22.689> over<00:00:22.839> here<00:00:22.960> to

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.019 
gonna be late so I'll go over here to

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:25.769 
gonna be late so I'll go over here to
machine<00:00:23.439> type<00:00:23.679> come<00:00:24.579> down<00:00:24.759> to<00:00:24.909> lathe<00:00:25.119> and<00:00:25.329> then

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
machine type come down to lathe and then

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.659 
machine type come down to lathe and then
you<00:00:26.050> can<00:00:26.230> choose<00:00:26.380> default<00:00:26.710> now<00:00:27.159> if<00:00:27.339> you<00:00:27.460> know

00:00:27.659 --> 00:00:27.669 
you can choose default now if you know

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:29.639 
you can choose default now if you know
your<00:00:27.819> machine<00:00:28.239> or<00:00:28.569> you<00:00:28.960> have<00:00:29.140> your<00:00:29.319> machine

00:00:29.639 --> 00:00:29.649 
your machine or you have your machine

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:31.169 
your machine or you have your machine
set<00:00:29.859> up<00:00:29.890> with<00:00:30.130> Messer<00:00:30.489> cam<00:00:30.699> then<00:00:30.909> you<00:00:30.999> can

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:31.179 
set up with Messer cam then you can

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:33.479 
set up with Messer cam then you can
choose<00:00:31.359> that<00:00:31.599> but<00:00:32.349> for<00:00:32.560> all<00:00:32.680> of<00:00:32.710> our<00:00:32.890> exercises

00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:33.489 
choose that but for all of our exercises

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:37.139 
choose that but for all of our exercises
we're<00:00:33.790> gonna<00:00:33.880> use<00:00:34.120> the<00:00:34.270> default<00:00:35.309> so<00:00:36.309> if<00:00:36.699> when

00:00:37.139 --> 00:00:37.149 
we're gonna use the default so if when

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:38.910 
we're gonna use the default so if when
you<00:00:37.300> select<00:00:38.050> that<00:00:38.140> you're<00:00:38.410> gonna<00:00:38.500> see<00:00:38.769> the

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:38.920 
you select that you're gonna see the

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.860 
you select that you're gonna see the
machine<00:00:39.219> group<00:00:39.489> come<00:00:39.670> over<00:00:39.940> here<00:00:40.149> and<00:00:40.359> you<00:00:40.840> see

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
machine group come over here and you see

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:41.849 
machine group come over here and you see
it<00:00:41.199> now

00:00:41.849 --> 00:00:41.859 
it now

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:44.939 
it now
operations<00:00:42.730> manager<00:00:43.329> if<00:00:43.539> you<00:00:44.320> don't<00:00:44.559> want<00:00:44.769> to

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
operations manager if you don't want to

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.490 
operations manager if you don't want to
show<00:00:45.250> that<00:00:45.280> you<00:00:46.149> can<00:00:46.329> actually<00:00:46.510> hold<00:00:47.019> on<00:00:47.260> alt

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:47.500 
show that you can actually hold on alt

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.340 
show that you can actually hold on alt
and<00:00:47.679> click<00:00:48.579> on<00:00:48.760> o<00:00:48.940> and<00:00:49.239> it<00:00:49.750> will<00:00:49.870> disappear

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.350 
and click on o and it will disappear

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.619 
and click on o and it will disappear
this<00:00:51.129> way<00:00:51.309> you<00:00:51.370> have<00:00:51.579> more<00:00:51.789> graphical<00:00:52.329> area

00:00:52.619 --> 00:00:52.629 
this way you have more graphical area

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:54.900 
this way you have more graphical area
around<00:00:52.929> or<00:00:53.140> if<00:00:53.379> you<00:00:53.890> hold<00:00:54.129> alt<00:00:54.399> again<00:00:54.579> and

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:54.910 
around or if you hold alt again and

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.000 
around or if you hold alt again and
click<00:00:55.059> on<00:00:55.149> o<00:00:55.300> again<00:00:55.600> that<00:00:56.289> will<00:00:56.440> appear<00:00:56.769> again

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
click on o again that will appear again

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.700 
click on o again that will appear again
for<00:00:57.219> you<00:00:57.339> so<00:00:57.640> this<00:00:58.420> right<00:00:58.989> here<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.379> machine

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
for you so this right here the machine

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.500 
for you so this right here the machine
will<00:00:59.890> never<00:01:00.010> appear<00:01:00.460> unless<00:01:00.879> you<00:01:01.089> click<00:01:01.359> a

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
will never appear unless you click a

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.419 
will never appear unless you click a
machine<00:01:01.899> type<00:01:02.140> so<00:01:02.649> now<00:01:02.769> that<00:01:02.829> we<00:01:03.039> chose<00:01:03.399> a

00:01:03.419 --> 00:01:03.429 
machine type so now that we chose a

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:05.970 
machine type so now that we chose a
machine<00:01:03.850> type<00:01:04.230> you<00:01:05.230> can<00:01:05.440> see<00:01:05.590> these<00:01:05.740> options

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:05.980 
machine type you can see these options

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:08.010 
machine type you can see these options
appear<00:01:06.550> now<00:01:06.820> let's<00:01:07.000> expand<00:01:07.390> the<00:01:07.510> properties

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
appear now let's expand the properties

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:11.610 
appear now let's expand the properties
and<00:01:08.310> let's<00:01:09.310> click<00:01:09.550> on<00:01:09.730> tool<00:01:09.940> settings<00:01:10.620> you're

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
and let's click on tool settings you're

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.470 
and let's click on tool settings you're
gonna<00:01:11.770> see<00:01:11.950> this<00:01:12.100> tool<00:01:12.280> setting<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.850> options

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:13.480 
gonna see this tool setting the options

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.110 
gonna see this tool setting the options
come<00:01:13.720> up<00:01:13.870> now<00:01:14.470> we<00:01:14.530> did<00:01:14.890> go<00:01:15.040> over<00:01:15.370> this<00:01:15.580> in<00:01:15.820> our

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.120 
come up now we did go over this in our

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.170 
come up now we did go over this in our
first<00:01:16.590> chapter<00:01:17.590> let's<00:01:18.370> choose<00:01:18.670> one<00:01:18.700> for

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:19.180 
first chapter let's choose one for

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.570 
first chapter let's choose one for
program<00:01:19.630> and<00:01:20.010> then<00:01:21.010> for<00:01:21.190> all<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.490> our

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
program and then for all of our

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.670 
program and then for all of our
exercises<00:01:22.360> we're<00:01:22.630> gonna<00:01:22.720> use<00:01:22.960> assigned<00:01:23.470> tool

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
exercises we're gonna use assigned tool

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:25.740 
exercises we're gonna use assigned tool
number<00:01:23.890> sequentially<00:01:24.700> so<00:01:24.970> we<00:01:25.090> can<00:01:25.270> assign

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:25.750 
number sequentially so we can assign

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.160 
number sequentially so we can assign
tool<00:01:25.990> numbers<00:01:27.420> sequentially<00:01:28.420> one<00:01:28.570> by<00:01:28.720> one<00:01:28.930> and

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
tool numbers sequentially one by one and

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.620 
tool numbers sequentially one by one and
then<00:01:29.890> one<00:01:30.160> of<00:01:30.370> duplicate<00:01:30.850> tool<00:01:31.060> numbers<00:01:31.360> so<00:01:31.510> we

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:31.630 
then one of duplicate tool numbers so we

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.080 
then one of duplicate tool numbers so we
know<00:01:31.840> you'll<00:01:32.410> get<00:01:32.530> a<00:01:32.590> little<00:01:32.860> message<00:01:33.400> when

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
know you'll get a little message when

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.840 
know you'll get a little message when
you<00:01:34.270> do<00:01:34.420> use<00:01:34.600> more<00:01:35.230> than<00:01:35.320> one<00:01:35.530> tools<00:01:35.800> and<00:01:36.070> then

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
you do use more than one tools and then

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.420 
you do use more than one tools and then
come<00:01:37.000> over<00:01:37.030> here<00:01:37.240> to<00:01:37.750> sequential<00:01:38.470> leave<00:01:39.220> it<00:01:39.340> at

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
come over here to sequential leave it at

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.730 
come over here to sequential leave it at
100<00:01:39.940> starts<00:01:40.810> out<00:01:40.930> at<00:01:41.050> 100<00:01:41.470> and<00:01:41.620> then

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
100 starts out at 100 and then

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.890 
100 starts out at 100 and then
increments<00:01:42.340> by<00:01:42.520> 2<00:01:42.580> this<00:01:43.390> way<00:01:43.570> you<00:01:43.630> leave<00:01:43.870> a

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:43.900 
increments by 2 this way you leave a

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.800 
increments by 2 this way you leave a
space<00:01:44.230> now<00:01:44.500> normally<00:01:45.100> in<00:01:45.280> your<00:01:45.810> programming

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
space now normally in your programming

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.260 
space now normally in your programming
it's<00:01:47.050> a<00:01:47.080> good<00:01:47.260> habit<00:01:47.650> to<00:01:47.680> put<00:01:47.830> either<00:01:48.250> 10<00:01:48.670> for

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270

way to the right now for this we're
gonna<00:04:17.430> select<00:04:17.700> two<00:04:18.030> points<00:04:18.419> let's<00:04:19.200> go<00:04:19.320> to<00:04:19.380> make

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
gonna select two points let's go to make

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.250 
gonna select two points let's go to make
from<00:04:19.859> two<00:04:20.010> points<00:04:20.400> and<00:04:20.750> then<00:04:21.750> over<00:04:21.989> here<00:04:22.019> to

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
from two points and then over here to

your top left point since we have points
over<00:04:28.260> here

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:28.500 
over here

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.170 
over here
and<00:04:28.620> there<00:04:28.890> you<00:04:29.010> go<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.280> creates<00:04:29.610> your<00:04:29.700> bound

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
and there you go it creates your bound

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.890 
and there you go it creates your bound
those<00:04:30.690> two<00:04:30.900> points<00:04:31.130> now<00:04:32.130> let's<00:04:32.940> create<00:04:33.150> more

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
those two points now let's create more

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:37.370 
those two points now let's create more
stock<00:04:34.350> in<00:04:34.650> our<00:04:35.030> cylindrical<00:04:36.030> block<00:04:36.390> this<00:04:37.170> way

a<00:05:22.380> little<00:05:22.590> bit<00:05:22.740> of<00:05:22.800> room<00:05:23.040> for<00:05:23.100> the<00:05:23.370> spindle<00:05:23.760> to

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:23.880 
a little bit of room for the spindle to

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:24.440 
a little bit of room for the spindle to
hold<00:05:24.090> it

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:24.450 
hold it

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:25.550 
hold it
so<00:05:24.750> you<00:05:24.810> don't<00:05:24.960> have<00:05:25.110> any<00:05:25.260> interference

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:25.560 
so you don't have any interference

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:27.560 
so you don't have any interference
between<00:05:25.980> the<00:05:26.280> spindle<00:05:26.730> and<00:05:26.850> the<00:05:27.000> tool<00:05:27.210> as<00:05:27.360> well

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:27.570 
between the spindle and the tool as well

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.720 
between the spindle and the tool as well
so<00:05:28.320> for<00:05:28.500> this<00:05:28.680> I<00:05:28.830> like<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.040> make<00:05:29.280> it<00:05:29.430> two<00:05:29.550> inches

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
so for this I like to make it two inches

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.250 
so for this I like to make it two inches
you<00:05:30.030> can<00:05:30.150> make<00:05:30.330> it<00:05:30.450> an<00:05:30.570> integer<00:05:30.840> if<00:05:30.960> you<00:05:31.050> like

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:31.260 
you can make it an integer if you like

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:34.310 
you can make it an integer if you like
depending<00:05:32.100> how<00:05:32.190> safe<00:05:32.460> you<00:05:32.610> you<00:05:33.390> are<00:05:33.840> with<00:05:34.110> your

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:34.320 
depending how safe you you are with your

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:36.410 
depending how safe you you are with your
tools<00:05:34.710> and<00:05:34.980> how<00:05:35.430> well<00:05:35.670> you<00:05:35.850> know<00:05:35.970> your<00:05:36.000> tools

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:36.420 
tools and how well you know your tools

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:39.230 
tools and how well you know your tools

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.080 
there's $100 I have enough flour here
and<00:05:49.110> two<00:05:49.350> inches<00:05:49.770> over<00:05:50.010> here<00:05:50.220> now<00:05:50.430> it<00:05:50.580> shows<00:05:50.820> me

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
and two inches over here now it shows me

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.270 
and two inches over here now it shows me
an<00:05:51.300> entire<00:05:51.750> box<00:05:52.110> is<00:05:52.650> because<00:05:53.010> it<00:05:53.130> already

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 
an entire box is because it already

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:56.470 
an entire box is because it already
knows<00:05:53.640> that<00:05:53.880> my<00:05:54.030> tools<00:05:54.300> gonna<00:05:54.480> be<00:05:54.660> this<00:05:54.990> big

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
knows that my tools gonna be this big

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:59.780 
knows that my tools gonna be this big
it's<00:05:57.480> gonna<00:05:57.540> be<00:05:57.810> mirrored<00:05:58.380> about<00:05:58.830> this<00:05:59.220> axis

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
it's gonna be mirrored about this axis

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.090 
it's gonna be mirrored about this axis
right<00:05:59.820> here<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:00.480> my<00:06:00.660> tool<00:06:00.930> is<00:06:01.050> actually<00:06:01.440> that

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:02.100 
right here so my tool is actually that

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:04.910 
right here so my tool is actually that
big<00:06:02.430> and<00:06:02.760> that's<00:06:03.480> exactly<00:06:04.080> how<00:06:04.200> big<00:06:04.380> my<00:06:04.590> stock

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:04.920 
big and that's exactly how big my stock

00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:06.890 
big and that's exactly how big my stock
is<00:06:05.130> it<00:06:05.310> already<00:06:05.520> knows<00:06:05.820> how<00:06:05.970> big<00:06:06.210> my<00:06:06.360> stock<00:06:06.660> is

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:06.900 
is it already knows how big my stock is

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:09.290 
is it already knows how big my stock is
and<00:06:07.140> this<00:06:08.070> that<00:06:08.340> this<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.580> only<00:06:08.970> half<00:06:09.270> my

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:11.520 
geometry now as soon as I'm done with

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:12.770 
geometry now as soon as I'm done with
that<00:06:11.610> you<00:06:11.730> can<00:06:11.910> see<00:06:12.060> this<00:06:12.150> little<00:06:12.360> box<00:06:12.630> right
