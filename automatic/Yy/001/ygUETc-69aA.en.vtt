00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.930
 now here we are with today we go pedro 

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:10.950
 tiziano ariel and natalia do not ask me more 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:16.889
 nothing from this moment I retire 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.889
 we are walking where the water 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.680
 there is the association of Cuba are at 

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.770
 detail will start to see how you started to 

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.960
 play and put it together with this speed leather 

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:32.169
 graphic well toy called me a lot the 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.670
 attention and they bought me one that I had 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:38.589
 some instructions and I could not put together 

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:40.300
 those without those instructions then that 

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:43.839
 cube was not over until after 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.789
 thanks to the internet my interest returned and 

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:48.149
 I started using it in the secondary that I 

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:48.149
 there was too much time 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.290
 and by 2012 I knew that more people than 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.610
 here in Argentina they do it and despite 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.600
 share experiences and I like 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.600
 compete more 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:08.070
 compete that they do it on time how much 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.759
 time for example how much time to your 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.830
 record 

00:01:08.759 --> 00:01:12.830
 my range of 28 seconds and 1 hundredth 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:21.890
 We are not going to take the time 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.890
 that we're going to take the time you have this 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:38.039
 who insults in a society this is a 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:39.930
 everyone takes their time then there is 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:41.759
 to press here from the sides when 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.280
 that was when they finished putting together 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.350
 all the faces of the cube release the as 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.819
 they throw it out and grab it and that's how the 

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.520
 first shock 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:55.819
 well, Pedro told me he could put together 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:55.819
 figures with that the 7 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:04.350
 if a tip floating how many cubes is 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.679
 sold in the world since the 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:10.170
 first this is said to be 350 

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:12.060
 million of the brand patented by ernÃ¶ 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.810
 rubik but in reality they are a lot more 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.810
 the creator 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:29.730
 turns 40 all over the world is a 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:29.730
 classic in 74 

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:39.590
 a river heart made 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:41.480
 33 a few years ago and how 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.900
 you started how did you find the 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.460
 cube I met Pedro in a huge 

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:51.110
 which is a high coefficient entity 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:53.810
 intellectual and I'm building cubes and I 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.680
 They really wanted to put together the ones that 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.910
 be quick 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.910
 by the way it was good 

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:03.620
 it was what I want to put the weapon in 15 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:05.810
 seconds with putting it together I'm fine and 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:08.840
 then I went down the times and not 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:10.459
 I wanted to leave merman and now the first 

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.140
 Once you put it together, you arm it by following it 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.840
 natalia the instructions and from 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:16.850
 say let's memorize that way of 

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.860
 put it together and that's the bad day they go 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:21.050
 going down in bone time we study 

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:23.959
 steps to build the cube what 

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:26.989
 still does not stop anymore has to do with 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:29.750
 have there taught me a trick not 

00:03:26.989 --> 00:03:31.850
 I know if I never got more than one face 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:34.460
 all never achieve 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:53.690
 got by the center to know that is 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:56.480
 the face that you have to be seeing 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:04:00.430
 which live as saved as it is already 

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.430
 He is saving narrow view 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:08.150
 the moment of the cube to advance 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.800
 a program but to be closer to 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.330
 solve to see if it no longer 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:13.310
 apart from doing that it is also in 

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.690
 Malabar can show us how you can 

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:17.150
 do both at the same time 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.440
 please if you are so kind and put the cube together 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.800
 if you want we take time with the 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.800
 timer 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.099
 what a barbarian 

00:04:30.969 --> 00:04:35.480
 in this moment where what will not have 

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:38.890
 they go from the brain 

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:38.890
 a doctor talking 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.250
 for the awesome what happens when 

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:45.250
 the term 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.320
 we are seeing that the two balls true 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:57.520
 is incorporated 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.080
 yes 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:09.920
 I ask you a question to develop this 

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:12.950
 skill that comes in first month so 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.290
 admirable serves them for other things in 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:18.860
 life in mathematics at school 

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:20.330
 or in only fun a challenge with 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.610
 you none now is not a great 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 mathematical challenge contrary to what 

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:28.370
 that is believed but also if you have those 

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:31.130
 different areas of the brain you use a 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.990
 hand-eye coordination which then helps 

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:36.760
 apply to other challenges other 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.470
 exercises for example also what is 

00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:42.100
 told to memorize a different room 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:46.030
 similar sequence and that helps me a lot 

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:48.390
 learn the physics formula and the 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.390
 memory 

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:54.349
 in what is visual memory in the 

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.870
 faculty I look at a blackboard 

00:05:54.349 --> 00:06:01.009
 and also what changes is the margin of what 

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.780
 what humans can see 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:04.189
 good guys the truth many 

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:09.340
 we congratulate but they make us 

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:09.340
 caught something of something like 

00:06:10.430 --> 00:06:13.639
 anyone who wants to learn in 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:16.180
 internet on youtube is full of 

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:16.180
 tutorials 

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:23.449
 at the primary level if they want to even 

00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:27.699
 can enter a page we have a cube 

00:06:23.449 --> 00:06:27.699
 Rubik to Argentina and we will explain 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:31.990
 Thank you
