1994<00:01:44.950> seven<00:01:45.370> and<00:01:45.520> so<00:01:45.730> forth<00:01:46.060> no<00:01:46.990> rhyme<00:01:47.260> or

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:47.290 
1994 seven and so forth no rhyme or

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:50.280 
1994 seven and so forth no rhyme or
reason<00:01:47.470> as<00:01:47.950> stated<00:01:48.460> just<00:01:48.670> these<00:01:49.630> dots

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:50.290 
reason as stated just these dots

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.910 
reason as stated just these dots
he<00:01:50.560> literally<00:01:51.330> cataloged<00:01:52.330> them<00:01:52.570> as<00:01:52.720> he<00:01:53.350> owned

them so it's just a mishmash of
everywhere<00:01:58.740> but<00:01:59.740> the<00:01:59.860> day<00:02:00.040> dots<00:02:00.310> really<00:02:00.760> help

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:00.970 
everywhere but the day dots really help

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.700 
everywhere but the day dots really help
it's<00:02:01.210> like<00:02:01.360> a<00:02:01.390> library<00:02:01.960> like<00:02:02.020> Dewey<00:02:02.410> Decimal

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:02.710 
it's like a library like Dewey Decimal
