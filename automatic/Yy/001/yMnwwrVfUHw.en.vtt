hey what is up guys and welcome back
today<00:00:06.629> we're<00:00:06.839> gonna<00:00:06.930> be<00:00:07.080> checking<00:00:07.109> out<00:00:07.529> the

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
today we're gonna be checking out the

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.320 
today we're gonna be checking out the
interior<00:00:08.250> for<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.670> lighthouse<00:00:09.059> and<00:00:09.210> then

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
interior for the lighthouse and then

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.240 
interior for the lighthouse and then
also<00:00:09.540> I<00:00:09.929> wanted<00:00:10.170> to<00:00:10.260> do<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> few<00:00:10.950> other<00:00:11.010> things

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
also I wanted to do a few other things

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:13.610 
also I wanted to do a few other things
so<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.670> figured<00:00:12.030> after<00:00:12.269> I'm<00:00:13.019> done<00:00:13.230> building

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
so I figured after I'm done building

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.140 
so I figured after I'm done building
like<00:00:13.740> a<00:00:13.769> large<00:00:14.040> section<00:00:14.490> like<00:00:14.639> this<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.030> could

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
like a large section like this we could

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:16.820 
like a large section like this we could
maybe<00:00:15.299> do<00:00:15.480> an<00:00:15.570> update<00:00:15.870> video<00:00:15.990> every<00:00:16.470> now<00:00:16.619> and

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
maybe do an update video every now and

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.920 
maybe do an update video every now and
then<00:00:16.949> so<00:00:17.250> that<00:00:17.279> could<00:00:17.670> keep<00:00:17.789> you<00:00:17.970> guys<00:00:18.119> kind<00:00:18.840> of

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
then so that could keep you guys kind of

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.689 
then so that could keep you guys kind of
informed<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:19.619> maybe<00:00:19.740> get<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.010> inspired<00:00:20.430> or

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
informed and maybe get you inspired or

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.040 
informed and maybe get you inspired or
give<00:00:20.850> you<00:00:20.939> some<00:00:20.970> ideas<00:00:21.420> on<00:00:21.600> what<00:00:21.779> you<00:00:21.840> could

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
give you some ideas on what you could

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.599 
give you some ideas on what you could
add<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.500> lot<00:00:22.650> of<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:22.920> empty<00:00:23.100> space<00:00:23.310> cuz<00:00:23.550> I

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
add in a lot of the empty space cuz I

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:25.700 
add in a lot of the empty space cuz I
know<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:23.760> few<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.150> you<00:00:24.330> actually<00:00:24.960> build<00:00:25.439> on<00:00:25.619> the

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
know a few of you actually build on the

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.700 
know a few of you actually build on the
same<00:00:25.920> map<00:00:26.160> that<00:00:26.490> I'm<00:00:26.640> building<00:00:26.849> on<00:00:27.090> and<00:00:27.710> from

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
same map that I'm building on and from

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.470 
same map that I'm building on and from
all<00:00:28.920> the<00:00:29.099> tutorial<00:00:29.609> buildings<00:00:30.000> you<00:00:30.179> probably

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
all the tutorial buildings you probably

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.669 
all the tutorial buildings you probably
still<00:00:30.660> don't<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.900> enough<00:00:31.019> to<00:00:31.230> have<00:00:31.320> a<00:00:31.380> proper

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
still don't have enough to have a proper

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.620 
still don't have enough to have a proper
town<00:00:31.890> so<00:00:32.099> hopefully<00:00:32.550> by<00:00:33.030> showing<00:00:33.300> you<00:00:33.450> some<00:00:33.480> of

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
town so hopefully by showing you some of

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:34.850 
town so hopefully by showing you some of
this<00:00:33.780> it'll<00:00:33.930> give<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.170> some<00:00:34.290> ideas<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.649> what

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
this it'll give you some ideas on what

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.740 
this it'll give you some ideas on what
you<00:00:35.010> could<00:00:35.160> use<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.489> fill<00:00:35.700> in<00:00:35.850> all<00:00:36.210> the<00:00:36.540> empty

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
you could use to fill in all the empty

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.810 
you could use to fill in all the empty
space<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.980> before<00:00:38.309> we<00:00:38.399> get<00:00:38.460> to<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.640> lighthouse

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
space so before we get to the lighthouse

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.580 
space so before we get to the lighthouse

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
off I did start naming some of the areas

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:43.970 
off I did start naming some of the areas
we'll<00:00:43.050> start<00:00:43.200> with<00:00:43.320> this<00:00:43.379> one<00:00:43.440> up<00:00:43.620> here<00:00:43.800> since

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
we'll start with this one up here since

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:45.350 
we'll start with this one up here since
it<00:00:44.070> was<00:00:44.129> the<00:00:44.219> first<00:00:44.520> one<00:00:44.670> I<00:00:44.730> showed<00:00:44.820> you<00:00:45.090> guys

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:48.139 
it was the first one I showed you guys
this<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.260> Lone<00:00:46.559> Pine<00:00:46.920> orchard<00:00:47.520> and<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> story

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
this is Lone Pine orchard and the story

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:49.790 
this is Lone Pine orchard and the story
behind<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.660> was<00:00:48.960> this<00:00:49.260> whole<00:00:49.410> area<00:00:49.710> right

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
behind this was this whole area right

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.110 
behind this was this whole area right
here<00:00:49.980> was<00:00:50.160> kind<00:00:50.340> of<00:00:50.370> empty<00:00:50.670> we<00:00:50.789> had<00:00:50.879> all<00:00:51.000> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
here was kind of empty we had all the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.700 
here was kind of empty we had all the
buildings<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:51.539> everything<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.530> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
buildings and everything but this was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.290 
buildings and everything but this was
just<00:00:52.860> kind<00:00:53.010> of<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.280> plain<00:00:53.520> and<00:00:53.760> boring<00:00:53.940> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
just kind of really plain and boring so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.760 
just kind of really plain and boring so
I<00:00:54.360> figured<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:55.079> know<00:00:55.170> what<00:00:55.289> why<00:00:55.440> not<00:00:55.620> put<00:00:55.739> a

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
I figured you know what why not put a

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.889 
I figured you know what why not put a
forest<00:00:56.190> here<00:00:56.430> so<00:00:56.910> I<00:00:56.940> went<00:00:57.090> over<00:00:57.300> there<00:00:57.390> copied

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
forest here so I went over there copied

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.410 
forest here so I went over there copied
the<00:00:58.020> trees<00:00:58.289> and<00:00:58.559> then<00:00:58.680> pasted<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.250> here<00:00:59.640> only

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the trees and then pasted them here only

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.020 
the trees and then pasted them here only
to<00:01:00.719> find<00:01:00.930> out<00:01:01.199> that<00:01:01.440> there<00:01:01.680> are<00:01:01.710> no<00:01:02.219> pine<00:01:02.730> trees

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
to find out that there are no pine trees

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.539 
to find out that there are no pine trees
on<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.840> island<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.320> all<00:01:04.439> they're<00:01:05.189> all<00:01:05.220> over

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
on this island at all they're all over

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.190 
on this island at all they're all over
there<00:01:05.670> there's<00:01:06.030> tons<00:01:06.299> of<00:01:06.420> them<00:01:06.570> if<00:01:06.960> not

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
there there's tons of them if not

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.140 
there there's tons of them if not
hundreds<00:01:07.650> but<00:01:08.250> over<00:01:08.460> here<00:01:08.610> it's<00:01:08.760> nothing<00:01:09.030> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
hundreds but over here it's nothing but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:10.789 
hundreds but over here it's nothing but
these<00:01:09.299> damn<00:01:09.540> oak<00:01:09.780> trees<00:01:10.110> or<00:01:10.409> whatever<00:01:10.680> the

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
these damn oak trees or whatever the

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:11.960 
these damn oak trees or whatever the
hell<00:01:10.920> those<00:01:11.070> things<00:01:11.280> are<00:01:11.430> so<00:01:11.610> I'm<00:01:11.670> not<00:01:11.790> sure

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
hell those things are so I'm not sure

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.149 
hell those things are so I'm not sure
these<00:01:12.090> things<00:01:12.150> really<00:01:13.080> make<00:01:13.260> sense<00:01:13.500> but<00:01:14.100> I

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
these things really make sense but I

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:15.830 
these things really make sense but I
guess<00:01:14.340> it<00:01:14.460> kind<00:01:14.670> of<00:01:14.760> goes<00:01:15.210> with<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.420> name<00:01:15.689> of

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
guess it kind of goes with the name of

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.870 
guess it kind of goes with the name of
this<00:01:15.930> place<00:01:16.140> and<00:01:17.100> it's<00:01:17.340> kind<00:01:17.520> of<00:01:17.549> like<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.700> cool

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
this place and it's kind of like a cool

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.999 
this place and it's kind of like a cool
little<00:01:18.000> backstory<00:01:18.540> I<00:01:18.659> guess<00:01:18.930> so<00:01:19.500> we<00:01:19.619> have<00:01:19.770> that

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
little backstory I guess so we have that

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.130 
little backstory I guess so we have that
they're<00:01:20.430> really<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.909> only<00:01:20.970> pines<00:01:21.420> on<00:01:21.750> this

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
they're really the only pines on this

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:23.990 
they're really the only pines on this
whole<00:01:22.320> island<00:01:22.470> I<00:01:22.710> can<00:01:22.830> assure<00:01:22.920> you<00:01:23.130> so<00:01:23.790> we<00:01:23.880> have

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
whole island I can assure you so we have

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.270 
whole island I can assure you so we have
this<00:01:24.210> place<00:01:24.479> and<00:01:24.869> then<00:01:25.320> I<00:01:25.830> guess<00:01:25.979> we'll<00:01:26.130> save

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
this place and then I guess we'll save

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.770 
this place and then I guess we'll save
this<00:01:26.430> area<00:01:26.700> for<00:01:26.880> last<00:01:27.060> since<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.540> the

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
this area for last since it is the

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440 
this area for last since it is the
newest<00:01:28.229> so<00:01:28.890> next<00:01:29.130> we<00:01:29.400> have<00:01:29.430> the<00:01:29.729> barons<00:01:30.180> town

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
newest so next we have the barons town

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.640 
newest so next we have the barons town
and<00:01:30.600> if<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:30.750> guys<00:01:30.869> didn't<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.200> this<00:01:31.380> one<00:01:31.530> was

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
and if you guys didn't know this one was

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.020 
and if you guys didn't know this one was
kind<00:01:31.799> of<00:01:31.829> inspired<00:01:32.280> from<00:01:32.460> the<00:01:32.579> Barons<00:01:32.820> place

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
kind of inspired from the Barons place

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
kind of inspired from the Barons place
in<00:01:33.210> The<00:01:33.329> Witcher<00:01:33.600> 3<00:01:33.630> which<00:01:34.020> was<00:01:34.140> called<00:01:34.439> crows

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
in The Witcher 3 which was called crows

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.980 
in The Witcher 3 which was called crows
perch<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.850> I<00:01:35.880> figured<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.299> name<00:01:36.479> I'd<00:01:36.750> kind<00:01:36.930> of

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
perch so I figured the name I'd kind of

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.600 
perch so I figured the name I'd kind of
pay<00:01:37.110> tribute<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.590> it<00:01:37.710> and<00:01:37.829> go<00:01:37.890> with<00:01:37.979> a<00:01:38.040> bird<00:01:38.310> so

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
pay tribute to it and go with a bird so

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.520 
pay tribute to it and go with a bird so
I<00:01:38.640> went<00:01:38.850> with<00:01:38.909> Raven<00:01:39.270> tied<00:01:39.540> and<00:01:39.780> the<00:01:40.259> tie<00:01:40.470> just

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
I went with Raven tied and the tie just

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.530 
I went with Raven tied and the tie just
comes<00:01:40.950> with<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.909> water<00:01:42.119> that's<00:01:42.360> right

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
comes with the the water that's right

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.510 
comes with the the water that's right
nearby<00:01:42.750> so<00:01:43.170> I<00:01:43.200> think<00:01:43.409> that<00:01:43.649> fits<00:01:43.860> quite<00:01:44.399> well

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
nearby so I think that fits quite well

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.210 
nearby so I think that fits quite well
this<00:01:44.939> town<00:01:45.210> is<00:01:45.509> definitely<00:01:46.350> nowhere<00:01:46.860> near

build<00:02:50.350> your<00:02:50.530> own<00:02:50.560> nothing<00:02:50.980> too<00:02:51.190> huge<00:02:51.489> this<00:02:51.610> is

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:51.670 
build your own nothing too huge this is

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:53.820 
build your own nothing too huge this is
definitely<00:02:52.209> kind<00:02:52.360> of<00:02:52.390> a<00:02:52.480> small<00:02:52.750> town<00:02:52.830> port

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
definitely kind of a small town port

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.470 
definitely kind of a small town port
area<00:02:54.160> there's<00:02:54.340> no<00:02:54.459> big<00:02:54.670> boats<00:02:54.880> or<00:02:55.060> anything<00:02:55.209> as

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
area there's no big boats or anything as

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.729 
area there's no big boats or anything as
you<00:02:55.600> can<00:02:55.750> see<00:02:55.900> that's<00:02:56.049> just<00:02:56.260> a<00:02:56.350> little<00:02:56.560> mini

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:56.739 
you can see that's just a little mini

00:02:56.739 --> 00:02:59.729 
you can see that's just a little mini
one<00:02:56.950> but<00:02:57.700> yeah<00:02:57.790> we<00:02:57.880> have<00:02:58.030> this<00:02:58.330> and<00:02:58.660> this<00:02:59.560> right

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
one but yeah we have this and this right

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:02.610 
one but yeah we have this and this right
here<00:03:00.010> is<00:03:00.280> a<00:03:00.519> trading<00:03:01.299> shop<00:03:02.110> I<00:03:02.349> think<00:03:02.410> it's

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
here is a trading shop I think it's

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.470 
here is a trading shop I think it's
called<00:03:02.769> the<00:03:02.830> Riverside<00:03:03.310> trader<00:03:03.730> yep<00:03:04.060> or<00:03:04.390> no

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:04.480 
called the Riverside trader yep or no

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.690 
called the Riverside trader yep or no
Riverside<00:03:04.959> supply<00:03:05.410> so<00:03:06.190> yeah<00:03:06.280> that's<00:03:06.459> the<00:03:06.610> name

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
Riverside supply so yeah that's the name

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:08.640 
Riverside supply so yeah that's the name
of<00:03:06.760> that<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.150> then<00:03:07.269> this<00:03:07.390> one<00:03:07.450> is<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> tavern

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
of that and then this one is a tavern

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:11.160 
of that and then this one is a tavern
that<00:03:09.160> interior<00:03:09.640> actually<00:03:10.299> isn't<00:03:10.420> done<00:03:10.780> yet

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:11.170 
that interior actually isn't done yet

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:13.170 
that interior actually isn't done yet
but<00:03:11.530> then<00:03:11.680> this<00:03:11.890> one<00:03:12.160> I<00:03:12.489> think<00:03:12.910> this<00:03:13.000> one's

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
but then this one I think this one's

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.360 
but then this one I think this one's
done<00:03:13.500> at<00:03:14.500> least<00:03:14.680> the<00:03:14.769> first<00:03:14.980> floor<00:03:15.190> but<00:03:15.310> I

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
done at least the first floor but I

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.220 
done at least the first floor but I
figured<00:03:15.640> the<00:03:15.940> worker<00:03:16.450> in<00:03:16.720> the<00:03:16.840> lighthouse

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
figured the worker in the lighthouse

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:18.720 
figured the worker in the lighthouse
could<00:03:17.470> own<00:03:17.650> this<00:03:17.829> thing<00:03:18.040> and<00:03:18.220> maybe<00:03:18.370> it<00:03:18.489> keeps

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
could own this thing and maybe it keeps

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.150 
could own this thing and maybe it keeps
him<00:03:18.880> going<00:03:19.079> when<00:03:20.079> he's<00:03:20.320> not<00:03:20.500> working<00:03:20.680> on<00:03:20.920> that

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
him going when he's not working on that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:22.349 
him going when he's not working on that
since<00:03:21.340> that<00:03:21.519> probably<00:03:21.790> doesn't<00:03:21.970> pay<00:03:22.150> well

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
since that probably doesn't pay well

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.610 
since that probably doesn't pay well
working<00:03:22.780> in<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.959> lighthouse<00:03:23.260> I<00:03:23.350> don't<00:03:23.500> think

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:23.620 
working in the lighthouse I don't think

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:24.660 
working in the lighthouse I don't think
it<00:03:23.680> does<00:03:23.829> because<00:03:23.980> all<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:24.280> have<00:03:24.370> to<00:03:24.430> do<00:03:24.519> is

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
it does because all you have to do is

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:26.099 
it does because all you have to do is
light<00:03:24.850> that<00:03:25.060> little<00:03:25.269> torch<00:03:25.510> thing<00:03:25.750> at<00:03:25.810> the<00:03:25.900> top

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
light that little torch thing at the top

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.559 
light that little torch thing at the top
so<00:03:26.620> we<00:03:26.709> have<00:03:26.829> this<00:03:27.040> nothing<00:03:27.489> too<00:03:27.670> huge<00:03:27.970> but

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
so we have this nothing too huge but

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:30.059 
so we have this nothing too huge but
then<00:03:28.690> again<00:03:28.810> it's<00:03:29.230> owned<00:03:29.440> by<00:03:29.560> the<00:03:29.650> lighthouse

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:30.069 
then again it's owned by the lighthouse

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:31.860 
then again it's owned by the lighthouse
workers<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.700> why<00:03:30.790> would<00:03:31.000> it<00:03:31.090> be<00:03:31.209> so<00:03:31.690> we<00:03:31.750> have

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
workers so why would it be so we have

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.120 
workers so why would it be so we have
this<00:03:31.959> little<00:03:32.109> thing<00:03:32.380> and<00:03:32.590> then<00:03:32.769> I<00:03:32.829> figured

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:33.130 
this little thing and then I figured

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:35.190 
this little thing and then I figured
upstairs<00:03:33.549> is<00:03:33.760> maybe<00:03:33.970> where<00:03:34.120> his<00:03:34.390> living

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200 
upstairs is maybe where his living

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.720 
upstairs is maybe where his living
quarters<00:03:35.530> could<00:03:35.739> be<00:03:35.859> but<00:03:36.069> then<00:03:36.160> down<00:03:36.370> here<00:03:36.670> is

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
quarters could be but then down here is

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:38.640 
quarters could be but then down here is
kind<00:03:36.910> of<00:03:36.940> all<00:03:37.180> the<00:03:37.359> nice<00:03:37.510> seating<00:03:37.900> and<00:03:38.440> it's

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
kind of all the nice seating and it's

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.080 
kind of all the nice seating and it's
owned<00:03:38.739> by<00:03:38.859> him<00:03:39.160> so<00:03:39.310> I<00:03:39.340> figured<00:03:39.579> maybe<00:03:39.700> he<00:03:39.970> could

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:40.090 
owned by him so I figured maybe he could

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:41.789 
owned by him so I figured maybe he could
work<00:03:40.239> here<00:03:40.480> even<00:03:40.780> he<00:03:41.260> doesn't<00:03:41.410> really<00:03:41.590> need

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:41.799 
work here even he doesn't really need

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:44.009 
work here even he doesn't really need
any<00:03:42.100> of<00:03:42.220> his<00:03:42.310> own<00:03:42.430> bartenders<00:03:43.030> or<00:03:43.090> anything<00:03:43.269> so

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
any of his own bartenders or anything so

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.360 
any of his own bartenders or anything so
he<00:03:44.049> doesn't<00:03:44.350> have<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.590> waste<00:03:44.799> too<00:03:45.010> much<00:03:45.040> money

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
he doesn't have to waste too much money

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:46.530 
he doesn't have to waste too much money
on<00:03:45.459> them<00:03:45.700> he<00:03:45.819> can<00:03:45.940> keep<00:03:46.060> it<00:03:46.180> all<00:03:46.299> for<00:03:46.480> himself

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
on them he can keep it all for himself

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.479 
on them he can keep it all for himself
and<00:03:47.019> keep<00:03:47.500> his<00:03:47.620> belly<00:03:47.829> full<00:03:48.069> with<00:03:48.280> all<00:03:48.400> the

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
and keep his belly full with all the

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:51.059 
and keep his belly full with all the
food<00:03:48.639> he<00:03:48.819> buys<00:03:49.079> so<00:03:50.079> we<00:03:50.200> have<00:03:50.380> this<00:03:50.650> and<00:03:50.889> then

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
food he buys so we have this and then

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:54.330 
food he buys so we have this and then
this<00:03:51.250> right<00:03:51.489> over<00:03:51.730> here<00:03:51.760> is<00:03:52.209> just<00:03:52.900> a<00:03:53.440> little

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
this right over here is just a little

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:56.490 
this right over here is just a little
house<00:03:54.660> not<00:03:55.660> really<00:03:55.840> sure<00:03:56.019> what<00:03:56.200> it's<00:03:56.319> there

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
house not really sure what it's there

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.319 
house not really sure what it's there
for<00:03:56.560> but<00:03:56.889> I<00:03:57.040> know<00:03:57.100> it<00:03:57.250> looks<00:03:57.430> good<00:03:57.639> and<00:03:57.940> it<00:03:58.180> also

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:58.329 
for but I know it looks good and it also

00:03:58.329 --> 00:03:59.610 
for but I know it looks good and it also
allowed<00:03:58.690> us<00:03:58.720> to<00:03:58.840> kind<00:03:59.019> of<00:03:59.170> have<00:03:59.260> this<00:03:59.350> dock

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
allowed us to kind of have this dock

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.770 
allowed us to kind of have this dock
going<00:04:00.370> down<00:04:00.519> it's<00:04:00.730> really<00:04:00.850> maybe<00:04:01.480> it's<00:04:01.630> like<00:04:01.720> a

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:01.780 
going down it's really maybe it's like a

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:02.940 
going down it's really maybe it's like a
little<00:04:01.870> fishing<00:04:02.230> Hut<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.500> don't<00:04:02.650> know<00:04:02.739> but<00:04:02.889> we

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950 
little fishing Hut I don't know but we

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:05.309 
little fishing Hut I don't know but we
got<00:04:03.069> this<00:04:03.160> other<00:04:03.310> boat<00:04:03.579> and<00:04:03.850> it's<00:04:04.480> rock<00:04:04.720> and<00:04:05.109> I

00:04:05.309 --> 00:04:05.319 
got this other boat and it's rock and I

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.930 
got this other boat and it's rock and I
really<00:04:05.769> want<00:04:05.950> to<00:04:06.040> put<00:04:06.250> kind<00:04:06.730> of<00:04:06.790> like<00:04:06.910> a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:06.940 
really want to put kind of like a

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:08.670 
really want to put kind of like a
broken-down<00:04:07.420> ship<00:04:07.870> here<00:04:08.109> and<00:04:08.260> then<00:04:08.380> maybe

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:08.680 
broken-down ship here and then maybe

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:11.129 
broken-down ship here and then maybe
that<00:04:09.430> would<00:04:09.459> lead<00:04:09.760> to<00:04:09.790> some<00:04:10.120> cool<00:04:10.420> lore<00:04:10.780> or

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:11.139 
that would lead to some cool lore or

00:04:11.139 --> 00:04:12.900 
that would lead to some cool lore or
something<00:04:11.590> so<00:04:11.799> maybe<00:04:11.950> the<00:04:12.220> lighthouse<00:04:12.549> wasn't

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
something so maybe the lighthouse wasn't

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:13.379 
something so maybe the lighthouse wasn't
here<00:04:13.060> before

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:13.389 
here before

00:04:13.389 --> 00:04:15.509 
here before
and<00:04:13.569> then<00:04:14.170> that<00:04:14.350> big-ass<00:04:14.650> ship<00:04:14.950> just<00:04:15.190> crashed

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
and then that big-ass ship just crashed

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:17.849 
and then that big-ass ship just crashed
so<00:04:16.090> they<00:04:16.209> finally<00:04:16.450> they<00:04:17.289> were<00:04:17.350> fed<00:04:17.620> up<00:04:17.739> with

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
so they finally they were fed up with

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.229 
so they finally they were fed up with
all<00:04:18.010> the<00:04:18.100> boats<00:04:18.220> crashing<00:04:18.729> so<00:04:18.850> they<00:04:18.970> finally

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
all the boats crashing so they finally

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:20.490 
all the boats crashing so they finally
decided<00:04:19.570> to<00:04:19.600> put<00:04:19.750> a<00:04:19.780> lighthouse<00:04:20.109> there<00:04:20.289> and

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
decided to put a lighthouse there and

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:21.719 
decided to put a lighthouse there and
that<00:04:20.979> kind<00:04:21.159> of<00:04:21.220> gives<00:04:21.310> it<00:04:21.489> some<00:04:21.640> nice

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
that kind of gives it some nice

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:23.399 
that kind of gives it some nice
backstory<00:04:22.300> so<00:04:22.360> I<00:04:22.510> think<00:04:22.659> that's<00:04:23.050> definitely

00:04:23.399 --> 00:04:23.409 
backstory so I think that's definitely

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:25.469 
backstory so I think that's definitely
what<00:04:23.500> I'm<00:04:23.590> gonna<00:04:23.710> do<00:04:23.979> plus<00:04:24.610> I<00:04:24.880> don't<00:04:25.180> think<00:04:25.419> you

00:04:25.469 --> 00:04:25.479 
what I'm gonna do plus I don't think you

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:26.820 
what I'm gonna do plus I don't think you
guys<00:04:25.599> have<00:04:25.659> seen<00:04:25.990> me<00:04:26.050> make<00:04:26.320> a<00:04:26.530> crack

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:26.830 
guys have seen me make a crack

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.860 
guys have seen me make a crack
boat<00:04:27.159> before<00:04:27.340> I've<00:04:27.849> done<00:04:28.210> one<00:04:28.449> in<00:04:28.479> the<00:04:28.629> past

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
boat before I've done one in the past

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.210 
boat before I've done one in the past
and<00:04:29.259> it<00:04:29.530> turned<00:04:29.680> out<00:04:29.800> really<00:04:29.949> good<00:04:30.099> so

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:30.220 
and it turned out really good so

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:32.279 
and it turned out really good so
hopefully<00:04:30.370> I<00:04:30.550> can<00:04:30.729> do<00:04:30.819> something<00:04:31.000> as<00:04:31.270> good<00:04:32.050> if

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
hopefully I can do something as good if

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:34.320 
hopefully I can do something as good if
not<00:04:32.409> better<00:04:32.650> for<00:04:32.919> right<00:04:33.280> there<00:04:33.460> and<00:04:33.610> I<00:04:33.909> don't

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:34.330 
not better for right there and I don't

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:35.999 
not better for right there and I don't
know<00:04:34.479> maybe<00:04:34.990> it'll<00:04:35.169> work<00:04:35.229> out<00:04:35.469> maybe<00:04:35.740> it<00:04:35.889> won't

00:04:35.999 --> 00:04:36.009 
know maybe it'll work out maybe it won't

00:04:36.009 --> 00:04:39.059 
know maybe it'll work out maybe it won't
we<00:04:36.340> will<00:04:36.520> see<00:04:36.759> but<00:04:37.419> yeah<00:04:37.509> now<00:04:37.780> for<00:04:38.229> what<00:04:38.560> some

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
we will see but yeah now for what some

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:40.379 
we will see but yeah now for what some
of<00:04:39.189> you<00:04:39.250> guys<00:04:39.340> have<00:04:39.550> probably<00:04:39.789> been<00:04:40.060> waiting

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:40.389 
of you guys have probably been waiting

00:04:40.389 --> 00:04:41.550 
of you guys have probably been waiting
for<00:04:40.539> this<00:04:40.629> whole<00:04:40.750> time<00:04:40.960> the<00:04:41.199> lighthouse

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:41.560 
for this whole time the lighthouse

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:43.770 
for this whole time the lighthouse
interior<00:04:42.310> so<00:04:43.000> we<00:04:43.090> head<00:04:43.240> on<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.539> here<00:04:43.719> and

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:43.780 
interior so we head on in here and

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.839 
interior so we head on in here and
actually<00:04:44.080> before<00:04:44.229> we<00:04:44.379> go<00:04:44.530> in<00:04:44.680> there<00:04:44.889> you<00:04:45.039> may

00:04:45.839 --> 00:04:45.849 
actually before we go in there you may

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:47.850 
actually before we go in there you may
notice<00:04:46.210> before<00:04:46.569> it<00:04:46.689> was<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:47.139> this<00:04:47.469> level<00:04:47.740> right

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
notice before it was on this level right

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.950 
notice before it was on this level right
here<00:04:48.159> but<00:04:48.789> I<00:04:48.819> decided<00:04:49.240> to<00:04:49.389> raise<00:04:49.569> it<00:04:49.719> I<00:04:49.780> think

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
here but I decided to raise it I think

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:52.379 
here but I decided to raise it I think
it<00:04:50.020> was<00:04:50.139> five<00:04:50.439> blocks<00:04:50.830> higher<00:04:51.210> and<00:04:52.210> then<00:04:52.330> I

00:04:52.379 --> 00:04:52.389 
it was five blocks higher and then I

00:04:52.389 --> 00:04:53.879 
it was five blocks higher and then I
also<00:04:52.539> put<00:04:52.689> in<00:04:52.870> this<00:04:52.990> nice<00:04:53.229> little<00:04:53.259> rock<00:04:53.620> here

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:53.889 
also put in this nice little rock here

00:04:53.889 --> 00:04:55.320 
also put in this nice little rock here
so<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.490> have<00:04:54.639> that<00:04:54.789> but<00:04:54.939> yeah<00:04:55.090> let's<00:04:55.240> go<00:04:55.300> ahead

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:55.330 
so we have that but yeah let's go ahead

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.200 
so we have that but yeah let's go ahead
and<00:04:55.539> head<00:04:55.659> on<00:04:55.719> inside<00:04:56.789> so<00:04:57.789> I'm<00:04:57.909> not<00:04:58.030> sure<00:04:58.090> if

00:04:58.200 --> 00:04:58.210 
and head on inside so I'm not sure if

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:00.480 
and head on inside so I'm not sure if
you<00:04:58.389> guys<00:04:58.479> have<00:04:58.719> heard<00:04:58.870> or<00:04:59.169> not<00:04:59.289> but<00:04:59.349> as<00:04:59.919> I<00:05:00.430> said

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:00.490 
you guys have heard or not but as I said

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:02.399 
you guys have heard or not but as I said
the<00:05:00.789> kind<00:05:01.120> of<00:05:01.150> lore<00:05:01.419> behind<00:05:01.870> this<00:05:02.020> whole<00:05:02.199> place

00:05:02.399 --> 00:05:02.409 
the kind of lore behind this whole place

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:04.260 
the kind of lore behind this whole place
was<00:05:02.620> it's<00:05:02.830> either<00:05:03.009> in<00:05:03.159> a<00:05:03.219> time<00:05:03.460> of<00:05:03.490> war<00:05:03.849> or<00:05:04.090> just

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:04.270 
was it's either in a time of war or just

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:05.760 
was it's either in a time of war or just
shortly<00:05:04.599> after<00:05:05.020> I<00:05:05.050> still<00:05:05.319> haven't<00:05:05.530> decided

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
shortly after I still haven't decided

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:07.379 
shortly after I still haven't decided
between<00:05:06.039> the<00:05:06.310> two<00:05:06.460> but<00:05:07.030> that's<00:05:07.120> why<00:05:07.300> you're

00:05:07.379 --> 00:05:07.389 
between the two but that's why you're

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:09.029 
between the two but that's why you're
gonna<00:05:07.569> see<00:05:07.780> a<00:05:07.810> lot<00:05:08.199> of<00:05:08.319> my<00:05:08.409> builds<00:05:08.770> kind<00:05:08.979> of

00:05:09.029 --> 00:05:09.039 
gonna see a lot of my builds kind of

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:11.070 
gonna see a lot of my builds kind of
looking<00:05:09.400> as<00:05:09.610> if<00:05:09.969> they're<00:05:10.120> more<00:05:10.479> designated

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:11.080 
looking as if they're more designated

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:13.320 
looking as if they're more designated
for<00:05:11.259> guards<00:05:11.680> instead<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.580> the<00:05:12.759> normal

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:13.330 
for guards instead of the normal

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:14.640 
for guards instead of the normal
civilian<00:05:13.599> people<00:05:13.990> who<00:05:14.110> would<00:05:14.259> normally<00:05:14.409> be

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:14.650 
civilian people who would normally be

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:17.070 
civilian people who would normally be
working<00:05:15.069> there<00:05:15.219> and<00:05:15.669> that's<00:05:16.180> also<00:05:16.539> why<00:05:16.750> a<00:05:16.780> lot

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:17.080 
working there and that's also why a lot

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:19.379 
working there and that's also why a lot
of<00:05:17.110> the<00:05:17.259> exterior<00:05:17.770> zhh<00:05:18.150> kind<00:05:19.150> of<00:05:19.210> look<00:05:19.360> like

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:19.389 
of the exterior zhh kind of look like

00:05:19.389 --> 00:05:21.510 
of the exterior zhh kind of look like
this<00:05:19.719> such<00:05:20.139> as<00:05:20.289> that<00:05:20.440> one<00:05:20.590> over<00:05:20.740> there<00:05:20.889> maybe

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
this such as that one over there maybe

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.490 
this such as that one over there maybe
if<00:05:21.669> it<00:05:21.819> wasn't<00:05:22.029> kind<00:05:22.659> of<00:05:22.779> the<00:05:22.840> back<00:05:22.990> story<00:05:23.319> with

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:23.500 
if it wasn't kind of the back story with

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.589 
if it wasn't kind of the back story with
the<00:05:23.590> lore<00:05:23.800> and<00:05:24.099> the<00:05:24.250> war<00:05:25.029> going<00:05:25.300> on<00:05:25.419> and

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
the lore and the war going on and

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:27.089 
the lore and the war going on and
everything<00:05:25.779> there<00:05:26.409> wouldn't<00:05:26.650> be<00:05:26.680> the<00:05:26.860> bricks

00:05:27.089 --> 00:05:27.099 
everything there wouldn't be the bricks

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:28.529 
everything there wouldn't be the bricks
there<00:05:27.340> but<00:05:27.580> since<00:05:27.789> there<00:05:27.909> is<00:05:28.000> a<00:05:28.029> war<00:05:28.240> that<00:05:28.419> kind

00:05:28.529 --> 00:05:28.539 
there but since there is a war that kind

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:30.240 
there but since there is a war that kind
of<00:05:28.599> had<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:28.870> add<00:05:29.080> supports<00:05:29.650> and<00:05:29.830> just<00:05:29.979> a<00:05:30.069> lot<00:05:30.189> of

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
of had to add supports and just a lot of

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:32.279 
of had to add supports and just a lot of
more<00:05:30.520> defensive<00:05:31.509> stuff<00:05:31.750> to<00:05:32.080> all<00:05:32.199> the

00:05:32.279 --> 00:05:32.289 
more defensive stuff to all the

00:05:32.289 --> 00:05:33.749 
more defensive stuff to all the
buildings<00:05:32.590> so<00:05:32.680> that's<00:05:32.830> also<00:05:33.250> why<00:05:33.430> the

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:33.759 
buildings so that's also why the

00:05:33.759 --> 00:05:36.059 
buildings so that's also why the

drinks<00:06:38.450> more<00:06:39.450> weapons<00:06:39.810> more<00:06:40.520> chests<00:06:41.520> so<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.180> lot

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:42.330 
drinks more weapons more chests so a lot

00:06:42.330 --> 00:06:44.300 
drinks more weapons more chests so a lot
of<00:06:42.360> storage<00:06:42.810> a<00:06:43.020> lot<00:06:43.170> of<00:06:43.320> beds<00:06:43.500> I<00:06:43.770> guess<00:06:44.160> that's

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:44.310 
of storage a lot of beds I guess that's

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:46.550 
of storage a lot of beds I guess that's
not<00:06:44.370> too<00:06:44.490> many<00:06:44.700> beds<00:06:44.910> but<00:06:45.270> then<00:06:46.170> again<00:06:46.410> there

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560 
not too many beds but then again there

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.750 
not too many beds but then again there
probably<00:06:46.800> wouldn't<00:06:46.980> be<00:06:47.040> too<00:06:47.160> many<00:06:47.310> guards<00:06:47.490> in

00:06:47.750 --> 00:06:47.760 
probably wouldn't be too many guards in

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:49.610 
probably wouldn't be too many guards in
the<00:06:47.940> lighthouse<00:06:48.150> cuz<00:06:48.600> if<00:06:48.990> there's<00:06:49.230> a<00:06:49.320> lot<00:06:49.470> in

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
the lighthouse cuz if there's a lot in

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.170 
the lighthouse cuz if there's a lot in
here<00:06:49.860> they<00:06:50.190> can't<00:06:50.430> get<00:06:50.580> much<00:06:50.730> done<00:06:50.970> because

00:06:51.170 --> 00:06:51.180 
here they can't get much done because

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:53.540 
here they can't get much done because
it's<00:06:51.360> it's<00:06:52.080> a<00:06:52.140> very<00:06:52.170> tight<00:06:52.560> squeeze<00:06:52.830> but<00:06:53.430> yeah

00:06:53.540 --> 00:06:53.550

bigger<00:07:00.660> bed<00:07:00.930> the<00:07:01.320> nice<00:07:01.860> little<00:07:02.130> banner<00:07:02.610> there

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:03.030 
bigger bed the nice little banner there

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.970 
bigger bed the nice little banner there
broken<00:07:03.930> bottle<00:07:04.230> cuz<00:07:04.380> he's<00:07:04.530> probably<00:07:04.740> always

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:04.980 
broken bottle cuz he's probably always

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.090 
broken bottle cuz he's probably always
pissed<00:07:05.280> off<00:07:05.430> and<00:07:06.260> yeah<00:07:07.260> I<00:07:07.530> think<00:07:07.590> that's<00:07:07.950> the

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:08.100 
pissed off and yeah I think that's the

00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:09.710 
pissed off and yeah I think that's the
majority<00:07:08.250> of<00:07:08.580> kind<00:07:08.820> of<00:07:08.880> the<00:07:09.000> living<00:07:09.390> quarters

00:07:09.710 --> 00:07:09.720 
majority of kind of the living quarters

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:11.900 
majority of kind of the living quarters
of<00:07:09.840> this<00:07:09.960> whole<00:07:10.110> place<00:07:10.380> and<00:07:10.650> the<00:07:11.430> rest<00:07:11.669> of<00:07:11.820> it

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:11.910 
of this whole place and the rest of it

00:07:11.910 --> 00:07:14.120 
of this whole place and the rest of it
is<00:07:12.030> just<00:07:12.240> a<00:07:12.390> spiral<00:07:12.840> staircase<00:07:13.140> if<00:07:13.860> you<00:07:14.040> guys

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
is just a spiral staircase if you guys

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:16.220 
is just a spiral staircase if you guys
weren't<00:07:14.490> going<00:07:14.760> for<00:07:15.030> kind<00:07:15.120> of<00:07:15.210> a<00:07:15.330> wartime<00:07:15.900> look

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:16.230 
weren't going for kind of a wartime look

00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:18.470 
weren't going for kind of a wartime look
like<00:07:16.770> I<00:07:16.980> am<00:07:17.160> I'd<00:07:17.370> probably<00:07:17.580> recommend<00:07:17.790> doing<00:07:18.300> a

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:18.480 
like I am I'd probably recommend doing a

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.570 
like I am I'd probably recommend doing a
staircase<00:07:18.780> for<00:07:19.410> the<00:07:19.620> majority<00:07:20.070> of<00:07:20.100> it<00:07:20.310> if<00:07:20.460> you

00:07:20.570 --> 00:07:20.580 
staircase for the majority of it if you

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:23.300 
staircase for the majority of it if you
didn't<00:07:20.790> have<00:07:20.850> any<00:07:21.000> other<00:07:21.090> ideas<00:07:21.600> to<00:07:22.320> add<00:07:22.530> to<00:07:23.190> it

00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:23.310 
didn't have any other ideas to add to it

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:24.530 
didn't have any other ideas to add to it
because<00:07:23.580> there's<00:07:23.730> really<00:07:23.820> not<00:07:24.090> much<00:07:24.240> room<00:07:24.450> for

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:24.540 
because there's really not much room for

00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:27.380 
because there's really not much room for
or<00:07:25.020> not<00:07:25.230> not<00:07:25.830> much<00:07:25.950> need<00:07:26.220> for<00:07:26.490> anything<00:07:27.180> else

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:27.390 
or not not much need for anything else

00:07:27.390 --> 00:07:28.880 
or not not much need for anything else
in<00:07:27.540> a<00:07:27.570> lighthouse<00:07:27.900> besides<00:07:28.260> stairs<00:07:28.560> to<00:07:28.740> get<00:07:28.830> to
