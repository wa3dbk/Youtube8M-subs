00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.790
 with the same youtuber welcome 

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.000
 back to my channel continuing with the 

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.799
 speed theme and we will try to treat the 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.690
 theme of the transmitters in the video 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.490
 previous to talk about the 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.490
 antennas in the next about the 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.560
 receivers and then I'll show you how 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.970
 put together all this to important that 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.010
 know a little bit of the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.600
 theory is not that it's an open 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.390
 simply sharing what little 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:28.140
 what do they do and then as with 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.760
 the antennas according to the power or the 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.800
 often that we use is going to be the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.200
 size of the video transmitter we're going 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.050
 to use in this case I have here in 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.460
 different ones that I have bought I already have 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.649
 one that I'm using kimi 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:43.379
 cuadricÃ³ptero that this is the 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:46.590
 Video transmitter is 200 thousand watts 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:50.610
 here I have another one that is 600,000 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.800
 same this is the one of x 600 of 5.8 it arrives 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:55.620
 to hertz I also have these other two 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.039
 which are video transmitters one of 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:03.000
 200,000 and watts in 5.8 reaches gears and 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:04.860
 another of 400 milli walsh in 5.8 and herse if 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.800
 they see them physically is basically what 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.980
 same 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:10.990
 You will have to try to make a test 

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:12.580
 field to see if they really have reaches 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:13.780
 different since they have powers 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.460
 different 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.310
 we also have transmitters here 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.460
 of life that these two work in 1.2 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:25.450
 giga hertz is so big for being more 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:27.460
 large and is of higher power is 800 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:29.500
 thousand baht while this is 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:32.050
 only if the mini watts however 

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:34.720
 is 1.2 gigahertz this is very 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:38.560
 interesting since it is very small and 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:40.690
 also from 1.2 gigawats which 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.240
 interesting this frequency is that it has 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.150
 greater penetration this cross walls 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.160
 more easily then what 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:51.070
 have to keep in mind about the 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.620
 receiver equal transmitter now to the 

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:55.630
 when composing your your transmitter 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:59.170
 video is important to keep in mind what 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.630
 next 1 the frequency to use to 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.430
 5.8 gigahertz the frequency that there is no 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.130
 problem virtually no country 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:09.100
 using this frequency 2 the power 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.850
 that with 200 thousand watts or 400 thousand watts is 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:14.270
 more than enough 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.880
 that is your transmitter of this type by 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:18.410
 example that you can exchange the 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.750
 antennas not like the one I'm 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:22.910
 using below that is I'm going 

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:26.420
 to show basically it was the first one that 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.100
 bought that I bought and it came to me and so 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.170
 then it 's the one that I'm using but what 

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.630
 I think change the problem of this 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:36.050
 transmitter is that the antenna is welded 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.320
 to the transmitter is to say that every time 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:40.910
 I crashed so hard I was loose and 

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.720
 I'm going to finish the damaging in the 

00:02:40.910 --> 00:02:43.340
 transmitter 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.140
 the ideal is that the transmitter does not 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.570
 stay this way as I have it 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.000
 exposed the ideal is that the transmitter 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:52.550
 that below the frame of the next 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.510
 way then you have a 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.100
 transmitter of this one is in which you 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:01.510
 normally in the transmitter then to the 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.510
 antenna that way 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:08.810
 but you are suddenly looking to locate it 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.700
 somewhere inside your frame and 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.850
 surely they will not find it 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.190
 easily the way to put it and the other 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:18.680
 disadvantage of connecting the antenna 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:22.250
 directly to the transmitter is that if 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.810
 a very strong blow here at this point or 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:27.440
 in the antenna even though it is before the card 

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:29.840
 little can make you forget about this and 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.850
 damage our transmission the transmitter to 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:34.250
 is one of the most expensive things that has 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:35.770
 the speed team and then what is 

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:40.390
 It is recommended to do the following 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:44.260
 get an extension how are you 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.590
 and put it in our transmitter and then 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.930
 and connect our antenna 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.510
 to this extension 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.879
 and the interesting thing the extension the 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:57.159
 flexibility that will give us so 

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:59.739
 we will be able to put our transmitter 

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:01.900
 anywhere internally the 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:04.719
 quadrocopters and leave exposed 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:07.640
 only one tip of our antenna 

00:04:04.719 --> 00:04:10.760
 so all the hits we receive 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.130
 will affect only this point of 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:15.680
 here and if there is any damage at this point 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:18.200
 that basically impossible I will not have 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:20.870
 damage to our transmitter this is a 

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:22.880
 of the recommendations that I give them and so 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.890
 it's how I'm going to assemble this system 

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:28.250
 transmission the other quadrocopters that 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.200
 I'm going to arm today with nyse to do the 

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:32.270
 video of how to make the connections them 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.770
 I will show how it will be in another 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:36.260
 quadrocopters that I have that does not have 

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.760
 other video transmission system 

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.230
 important point to take into account the 

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:41.240
 when selecting your system 

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:42.800
 video transmission has again 

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.740
 what to see with the frequency and I'm going to 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:48.980
 give an example here easily this is 

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:51.230
 5.8 gigahertz and this one easily 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.850
 I can connect any type of antennas 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:54.710
 of these that are small 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.780
 remember that I recommend doing it to 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:05:00.290
 through an extension however 

00:04:56.780 --> 00:05:03.030
 these 1.2 gigahertz transmitters 

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:05.790
 I will show the antenna that uses 

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:09.720
 as they were not even fit inside the 

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:12.770
 recording is a giant antenna 

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.770
 if we compare it 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:19.040
 they are very large antennas 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:21.350
 and no longer imagine we will do this as 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:25.010
 in our quadrocopters something 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:27.590
 basically ridiculously big and so 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:30.800
 I have here another transmitter that is 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:33.500
 1.2 becomes equal its antenna continues 

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:36.800
 being much bigger than the 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:40.310
 5.8 antenna and the antenna with which 

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:43.990
 came this little transmitter is this 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:45.820
 although it is one during the smallest 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:47.650
 it is an antenna that can be damaged with 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:49.720
 greater ease and it's still more 

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:53.520
 larger than the antenna with which it came 

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:56.110
 this which is 5.8 giga hertz 

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:59.010
 basically that's all you have to 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:59.010
 see with the transmitters 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.090
 later on, then I will do everything 

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:06.450
 it has to do with the connections of your 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.710
 transmitters to the video system and 

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:09.960
 everything that has to do with also 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:11.550
 with the video reception system there 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:13.050
 forget to subscribe to my channel and leave me 

00:06:11.550 --> 00:06:16.610
 all your comments questions or 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.610
 work suggestions thanks
