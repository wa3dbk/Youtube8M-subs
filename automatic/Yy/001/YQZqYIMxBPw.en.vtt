00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.830 
to give you the code and you can go
ahead<00:03:18.470> and<00:03:18.650> vote<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.250> all<00:03:19.340> that<00:03:19.519> and<00:03:19.730> if<00:03:20.690> the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:20.840 
ahead and vote and all that and if the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.810 
ahead and vote and all that and if the
majority<00:03:21.019> percent<00:03:21.709> of<00:03:21.829> you<00:03:21.980> say<00:03:22.430> you<00:03:22.489> want<00:03:22.700> me

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
majority percent of you say you want me

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.410 
majority percent of you say you want me
to<00:03:23.060> give<00:03:23.870> you<00:03:23.989> the<00:03:24.140> code<00:03:24.790> then<00:03:25.790> I<00:03:25.820> guess<00:03:26.239> I

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:26.420 
to give you the code then I guess I

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:27.910 
to give you the code then I guess I
might<00:03:26.600> as<00:03:26.750> well<00:03:26.870> give<00:03:27.049> you<00:03:27.170> the<00:03:27.290> code<00:03:27.500> I<00:03:27.739> mean

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
might as well give you the code I mean

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.550 
might as well give you the code I mean
it's<00:03:28.130> a<00:03:28.220> simple<00:03:28.579> one<00:03:29.420> to<00:03:29.630> three<00:03:29.870> code<00:03:30.109> I<00:03:30.380> mean

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:30.560 
it's a simple one to three code I mean

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:35.229 
it's a simple one to three code I mean
yeah<00:03:31.489> but<00:03:31.519> um<00:03:32.049> so<00:03:33.049> yeah<00:03:33.290> and<00:03:33.799> then<00:03:34.190> you<00:03:35.180> could

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
yeah but um so yeah and then you could

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.930 
yeah but um so yeah and then you could
slam<00:03:35.540> it<00:03:35.690> down<00:03:35.720> like<00:03:35.989> that<00:03:36.170> and<00:03:36.230> I'll<00:03:36.620> see<00:03:36.940> shot

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:37.940 
slam it down like that and I'll see shot

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.720 
slam it down like that and I'll see shot
but<00:03:38.269> it's<00:03:38.510> not<00:03:38.780> that<00:03:39.019> thick<00:03:39.260> at<00:03:39.410> all<00:03:39.560> it's<00:03:40.519> kind

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:40.730 
but it's not that thick at all it's kind

00:03:40.730 --> 00:03:44.229 
but it's not that thick at all it's kind
of<00:03:40.880> kind<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.480> wide<00:03:41.690> not<00:03:42.350> it's<00:03:43.130> bulky<00:03:43.459> but<00:03:43.910> you

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
of kind of wide not it's bulky but you

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:48.610 
of kind of wide not it's bulky but you
know<00:03:44.540> it's<00:03:45.200> reasonable<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:45.980> like<00:03:46.160> it<00:03:46.370> I<00:03:47.560> like<00:03:48.560> it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
know it's reasonable I like it I like it

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
know it's reasonable I like it I like it
