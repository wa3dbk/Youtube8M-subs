 second edition of book video reviews from 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.289
 ginger on whether bidding today's video 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.080
 is dedicated to a novel based on 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:20.189
 real events of the novel which as 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.130
 consider some 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.060
 and you can kill both in direct and in portable 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.210
 sense of 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.380
 and so a hunter by Gregory David 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.840
 Roberts Shantaram 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.600
 it is an Indian name that is translated 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:36.300
 means a man whom God gave 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.120
 peaceful fate why the book is called 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.969
 Indian name because the main 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.600
 actions take place in india whether 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:48.210
 God is the protagonist a peaceful fate is 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.940
 very controversial issue as it is 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.730
 autobiography is clear that the main 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.879
 the hero is himself Gregory himself the author of this 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.090
 works he is an australian never 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.590
 heroin addicted 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:04.619
 subsequently imprisoned for 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.080
 bank robbery and escape from this 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:09.750
 prisons to india in the book for the most part 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.130
 tells about ten years of life 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
 robots andy 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
 but what good and instructive can 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.869
 tell the criminal you think 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.420
 and is it worth reading such a book at all? 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.210
 is it possible your opinion will change if I 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.939
 i will say that being a criminal gregory 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.610
 always say thank you and please and 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:32.430
 was a kind of robin hood which 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.369
 robbed only rich institutions but 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.270
 spent money of course on himself for that 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.150
 and paid 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.560
 what happened to this robin hood and how he 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.670
 generally managed to escape from 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.130
 australian prison 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.509
 everything is written in this book and generally in 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.119
 this book has everything 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.920
 such travel because it 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.840
 from the bottom if you can say so and 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.880
 it also tells about 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.689
 most famous sights 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.360
 india 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.490
 oh popular or maybe not much but 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.950
 nevertheless they should be 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.220
 popular in general great trip 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.380
 across india their bread and sights to you 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.990
 also provided here i 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.360
 love story girl Carla 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.580
 which fascinated at first sight 

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:20.400
 the main character and can bewitch 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.590
 the reader can't even do that 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:24.510
 probably because it is perfect 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.780
 combination of beauty and mind 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:30.060
 women want comedy she's here too 

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:33.870
 there is something worth bear hug 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:36.150
 in chapter 12 of this work which 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:38.850
 then remembered many more chapters and 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.640
 the main thing here is very wonderful 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.430
 so cute, good-natured and very funny 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.820
 pro baker best friend robot want 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:49.800
 tragedy you get it in abundance because 

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.290
 what reads some chapter of this 

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:55.230
 works you feel like you 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.390
 tears in my eyes but if you 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.450
 want to get enlightenment 

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:02.640
 for which they usually go to India 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.730
 perhaps the cheapest option 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:08.190
 getting this enlightenment because 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.610
 teachers with their philosophical reflections 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:14.070
 this book is also abundantly true 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.650
 just this one with sufficiency in 

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.870
 book i and forward at some point i 

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:22.770
 I realized that there are too many details 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:24.870
 too many descriptions and honestly under 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:26.520
 I have the end of the work 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.880
 some kind of cheating 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:33.000
 for 10 years, Robert has happened so much 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:35.850
 events this he knows how and there he was and 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.100
 it is he who knows it on his shoulder and it is him 

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:42.810
 on the shoulder and all the languages â€‹â€‹of the world van know in 

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:45.959
 In general, in general, he just knows all this 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.510
 it does not happen and everything seems to be on the verge between 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:50.760
 reality and fiction all some 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:53.070
 the moment gets very tight here 

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:55.080
 everything was already too 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:58.050
 but at some point not immediately because 

00:03:55.080 --> 00:04:01.200
 somewhere to the middle of the book, everything is somehow 

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:05.430
 perfectly balanced and then begins 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.440
 such as this stretches and stretches and 

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:08.850
 that is, there are moments that 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.550
 can be said in 5 minutes 

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:13.980
 and he tells them an hour roughly and 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:16.380
 besides it seemed to me in this 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.410
 the book is only very positive and 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.900
 very negative characters and since 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.830
 it's kind of like autobiography really 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:27.330
 life seems to me in the lives of such people 

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:30.419
 just does not happen but can not be 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:33.630
 perfect man bad or good and 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:36.509
 because it also smacks of some kind 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:38.639
 tricked and metaphors that are right on 

00:04:36.509 --> 00:04:41.669
 every page in this book is very 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.639
 beautiful they are just magical and perhaps 

00:04:41.669 --> 00:04:46.590
 this is what fascinates the reader but in 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.350
 some moment again their becoming 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.990
 too much and you can compare once we 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.300
 talking about curry 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:57.210
 perfect seasoning based on 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.750
 lies turmeric itself turmeric has 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.800
 magical wonderful aroma and weak but 

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.010
 speak very 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.320
 bitter unpleasant taste so add in 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.360
 turmeric extra ingredients 

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.060
 they are properly mixed right 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.610
 proportions and you kill that taste and 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.090
 leave this beautiful scent 

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.289
 overdoing the components it will become 

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:22.380
 unsuitable for use 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.590
 overdo with the actions of philosophizing 

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:25.410
 my 

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:29.160
 epithets and metaphors and the whole book 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.550
 will become unsuitable for reading yes you can and 

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:34.760
 break into a huge number of quotes and 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:38.010
 thoughtfully each separately for himself 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.310
 write analyze reflect on 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:42.360
 about this, but in general in their book 

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:45.180
 too much 

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:47.729
 as for me to shantar in this case 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:49.830
 walks the line between life and death 

00:05:47.729 --> 00:05:53.039
 so to speak but in fact the taste and color 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.409
 no friend so read read 

00:05:53.039 --> 00:05:57.510
 be sure to test in this book and a lot 

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:59.909
 of all interesting and there is something 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:03.060
 think and in order not to be unfounded I 

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:05.940
 I will give an example of the form of quotes from this book 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.639
 if you knew the very beginning that you would 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:11.490
 some time really happy but 

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:14.010
 then happiness will change you and it 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.500
 would bring you a lot of pain would you choose 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:19.169
 this is short-term happiness or 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:22.590
 would rather live quietly without knowing 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:24.690
 mishap nor sorrow personally i would choose 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.539
 happiness for a while 

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:29.729
 and to take you leave your
