believe<00:01:41.340> it's<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.610> three<00:01:41.880> so<00:01:42.060> just<00:01:42.270> go<00:01:42.450> to

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
believe it's the three so just go to

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:44.480 
believe it's the three so just go to
your<00:01:42.689> minecraft.jar<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.560> if<00:01:44.070> it's<00:01:44.189> not<00:01:44.340> in

because<00:01:47.909> i<00:01:47.939> don't<00:01:48.210> believe<00:01:48.390> it<00:01:48.509> makes<00:01:48.659> a

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
because i don't believe it makes a

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.929 
because i don't believe it makes a
difference<00:01:48.960> if<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.500> have<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> move<00:01:49.979> so<00:01:50.729> go

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
difference if you have to move so go
