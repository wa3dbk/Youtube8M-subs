00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
going to snip all of the petals so that

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.100 
going to snip all of the petals so that
we<00:02:23.530> can<00:02:23.740> actually<00:02:23.890> hold<00:02:24.550> it<00:02:24.910> onto<00:02:25.720> the<00:02:25.840> top<00:02:26.080> of

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
we can actually hold it onto the top of

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.420 
we can actually hold it onto the top of
that<00:02:26.590> cone<00:02:27.510> so<00:02:28.510> let's<00:02:28.900> start<00:02:29.230> with<00:02:29.410> that<00:02:29.470> the

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
that cone so let's start with that the

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.920 
that cone so let's start with that the
best<00:02:30.610> way<00:02:30.730> of<00:02:30.760> doing<00:02:30.970> this<00:02:31.210> is<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.480> take<00:02:31.780> the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:31.930 
best way of doing this is to take the

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.880 
best way of doing this is to take the
cone<00:02:32.170> and<00:02:33.100> just<00:02:33.600> put<00:02:34.600> a<00:02:34.630> load<00:02:34.840> of<00:02:34.930> ink<00:02:35.080> put<00:02:35.830> a

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:35.890 
cone and just put a load of ink put a

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.050 
cone and just put a load of ink put a
load<00:02:36.040> of<00:02:36.160> glue<00:02:36.510> onto<00:02:37.510> it<00:02:37.870> and<00:02:38.410> then<00:02:38.650> you<00:02:38.800> can

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:39.060 
load of glue onto it and then you can

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:47.030 
load of glue onto it and then you can
just<00:02:40.060> press<00:02:40.870> the<00:02:41.910> center<00:02:42.910> of<00:02:43.180> the<00:02:43.450> blossom

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.420 

punch<00:02:48.040> there<00:02:48.790> and<00:02:49.150> the<00:02:49.930> glue<00:02:50.320> the<00:02:50.920> wet<00:02:51.130> glue

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
punch there and the glue the wet glue

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:53.850 
punch there and the glue the wet glue
means<00:02:51.820> that<00:02:52.150> it's<00:02:52.630> slightly<00:02:52.930> forgiving<00:02:53.560> so

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860
