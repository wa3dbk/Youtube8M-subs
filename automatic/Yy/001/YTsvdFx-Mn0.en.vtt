video<00:00:02.220> I<00:00:02.610> had<00:00:03.300> just<00:00:03.629> recently<00:00:04.200> recorded<00:00:04.890> a

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
video I had just recently recorded a

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:07.160 
video I had just recently recorded a
video<00:00:05.250> of<00:00:05.609> mountain<00:00:05.970> men<00:00:06.120> one<00:00:06.359> but<00:00:07.020> my

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:07.170 
video of mountain men one but my

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.470 
video of mountain men one but my
computer<00:00:07.670> battery<00:00:08.670> just<00:00:09.210> shut<00:00:09.450> down

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
computer battery just shut down

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.450 
computer battery just shut down
completely<00:00:10.019> I<00:00:10.260> guess<00:00:10.469> either<00:00:10.710> overheated<00:00:11.370> or

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
completely I guess either overheated or

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.730 
completely I guess either overheated or
something<00:00:11.820> up<00:00:12.300> I<00:00:12.509> had<00:00:12.660> to<00:00:12.780> restart<00:00:13.139> this<00:00:13.380> and

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:13.740 
something up I had to restart this and

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.420 
something up I had to restart this and
the<00:00:14.130> video<00:00:14.429> ahead<00:00:14.670> say<00:00:14.940> did<00:00:15.690> not<00:00:16.100> stay<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.279> the

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
the video ahead say did not stay in the

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.810 
the video ahead say did not stay in the
same<00:00:17.640> August<00:00:18.449> in<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.720> memory<00:00:19.380> so<00:00:19.710> we're<00:00:20.640> going

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
same August in the memory so we're going

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.000 
same August in the memory so we're going
to<00:00:21.270> go<00:00:21.300> ahead<00:00:21.539> and<00:00:21.689> I<00:00:22.020> guess<00:00:22.230> continue<00:00:22.859> from

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:23.010 
to go ahead and I guess continue from
