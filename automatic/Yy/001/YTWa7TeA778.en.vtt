00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello everybody today let's see how to play 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:07.680
 the song of the colors everytime I'll make you 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.630
 see a precise part precisely 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.540
 especially the introduction that anyway 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.210
 then repeats for most of the song 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:18.779
 so the method how to play 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.210
 this song in the original tone 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.730
 the agreements are two major and fa kings 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.050
 minor sharp 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.960
 after which I thought of 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.779
 to realize the base is always in quality 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.390
 professional both of this track and 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.540
 in the version the world indeed 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.670
 then created by the colors 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.960
 I'll start working right away 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.910
 these two phases 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.570
 also because the world in theirs 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.610
 version we say looks a lot like mine 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.129
 style I was in my kind let's see 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.610
 closer how to play this song 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:56.219
 meanwhile we can use a sound 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:58.980
 slightly crunch without possibly 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:02.129
 too much reverberation try to stop 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.350
 precisely the agreements and maybe if 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.650
 this sound even a little good 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.020
 dose of corus is even better then i 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.080
 meanwhile chords of this piece are a 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.570
 re major and F sharp minor 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.500
 ok turns on these two agreements of course 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.979
 I will show you the passage 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.430
 main so we're going to get 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.870
 greater in this way than it is like 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.350
 we will take precisely ago 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:32.860
 let's just go to the king this way from the 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.060
 re we have the note of me to add to 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.870
 this deal with the little finger 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.030
 we take to the meeting 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:43.850
 after which the younger brother instead of 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.280
 take one we take it precisely in 

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.330
 this area as if we were playing ad 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.520
 example yes minor 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:54.410
 ok the deal but played what is mine 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:02:00.340
 precisely with the little finger we will move to the 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.340
 little finger and we're going to play this 

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:06.890
 just remember to stop well 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:09.380
 ropes ok you and to brake anyway 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:29.630
 sound of stopping however the sound does not 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:31.490
 as soon as you played well then the 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.900
 important thing in the first one 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:46.010
 pass I don't show it 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:47.270
 slowly in the first pass meanwhile 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.780
 we stop 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:56.060
 on this agreement without running 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.800
 then without adding a note of mine 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:01.690
 which is just the introduction does almost 

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.800
 after which the tour remains this e 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:06.470
 communicates what I really wanted 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:09.130
 add is that playing ok this 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.130
 first part 

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:18.230
 at this point it would have been 

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:28.040
 we find out who takes up ok for born 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:30.600
 alternating or picking years up 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:41.070
 we keep the strings stopped for later 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:43.080
 just play the agreement of screens if 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:45.830
 someone wanted to play it instead 

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:48.330
 simplified we can just use 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:50.640
 these agreements then the major king lo 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:52.540
 we take which one after which we add 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.819
 depending on the rally 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:56.409
 and the F sharp minor where then 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:04:20.320
 later we will go to take the 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:22.060
 my ok in the string of siri obviously in 

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.449
 in this case it is more difficult to escape the 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:29.110
 ropes so the only way to escape 

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:31.300
 questore saw that the passage a lot 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:38.289
 quick and keep your fingers on the deal 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:42.550
 without pressing ok so not with the con 

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:44.380
 the help of del parma ok I take advantage of it 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.780
 to remind you that tomorrow the 

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:49.539
 new video we will have a piece of celentano 

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:53.289
 in karaoke rock version always 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:04:55.030
 obviously and as soon as possible I will begin 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.590
 precisely to achieve these two bases 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:05:01.210
 I believe that I will leave with the world 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.470
 so soon you will also find these two 

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.330
 vases on my canal 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.800
 if you are not yet registered vi 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.630
 I advise you to sign up to be 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.199
 always up to date and we'll see each other 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.830
 soon 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.830
 Hi everyone
