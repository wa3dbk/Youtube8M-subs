00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.940 
on the ground but I think he just

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.599 
on the ground but I think he just
realized<00:00:55.510> that<00:00:55.839> it<00:00:56.589> was<00:00:56.769> an<00:00:56.890> impossible<00:00:57.129> task

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:56.710 
Pascal very much i know some people

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.160

go in a different direction i'd rather
actually<00:02:01.270> he<00:02:01.390> fought<00:02:01.660> the<00:02:01.900> guy<00:02:02.650> that<00:02:02.830> Pascal

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
actually he fought the guy that Pascal

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.710 
actually he fought the guy that Pascal
just<00:02:04.390> be<00:02:04.630> her<00:02:05.110> allegedly<00:02:05.890> beat<00:02:06.220> because<00:02:06.720> me

just be her allegedly beat because me

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.540 
just be her allegedly beat because me
I'm<00:02:07.960> sure<00:02:08.229> many<00:02:08.410> other<00:02:08.619> people<00:02:08.950> felt<00:02:09.160> Pascal

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:09.550 
I'm sure many other people felt Pascal

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.240 
I'm sure many other people felt Pascal
lost<00:02:09.759> the<00:02:09.880> fight<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.840> that<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.410> Gonzalez<00:02:12.070> I

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
lost the fight and that was Gonzalez I

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:13.920 
lost the fight and that was Gonzalez I
forget<00:02:13.030> his<00:02:13.090> first<00:02:13.360> name<00:02:13.510> that<00:02:13.720> I<00:02:13.750> was

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
forget his first name that I was

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.370 
forget his first name that I was
actually

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
actually

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.810 
actually
last<00:02:14.500> time<00:02:14.620> I<00:02:14.680> watched<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> guy<00:02:15.250> tonight<00:02:15.580> and

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:15.820 
last time I watched the guy tonight and

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:18.180 
last time I watched the guy tonight and
this<00:02:16.720> Gonzalez<00:02:17.260> character<00:02:17.710> I<00:02:17.740> think<00:02:18.040> him

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
this Gonzalez character I think him

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.710 
this Gonzalez character I think him
against<00:02:18.430> Kovalev<00:02:18.880> would<00:02:19.030> be<00:02:19.120> a<00:02:19.150> more<00:02:19.330> interest

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
against Kovalev would be a more interest

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.200 
against Kovalev would be a more interest
in<00:02:19.840> fight<00:02:20.080> than<00:02:20.470> Pascal<00:02:21.010> Kovalev<00:02:21.490> I<00:02:21.670> would

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.210 
in fight than Pascal Kovalev I would

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:24.990 
in fight than Pascal Kovalev I would
definitely<00:02:22.390> make<00:02:22.660> Kovalev<00:02:23.500> the<00:02:23.740> favorite<00:02:24.550> to

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.000 
definitely make Kovalev the favorite to

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.610 
definitely make Kovalev the favorite to
beat<00:02:25.180> Gonzalez<00:02:25.750> Gonzalez<00:02:25.900> is<00:02:26.290> a<00:02:26.320> very

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
beat Gonzalez Gonzalez is a very

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.040 
beat Gonzalez Gonzalez is a very
rudimentary<00:02:26.920> fighter<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.240> he's<00:02:28.420> very<00:02:28.660> strong

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
rudimentary fighter but he's very strong

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.230 
rudimentary fighter but he's very strong
and<00:02:29.410> he<00:02:29.920> might<00:02:30.130> be<00:02:30.310> able<00:02:30.430> to<00:02:30.550> give<00:02:30.730> cover<00:02:31.000> of

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
and he might be able to give cover of

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:32.910 
and he might be able to give cover of
issues<00:02:31.690> with<00:02:31.720> his<00:02:31.990> jab<00:02:32.320> because<00:02:32.650> he's<00:02:32.770> got<00:02:32.890> a

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:32.920 
issues with his jab because he's got a

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.410 
issues with his jab because he's got a
very<00:02:33.220> very<00:02:33.550> long<00:02:33.880> strong<00:02:34.660> jab<00:02:34.990> and<00:02:36.090> that<00:02:37.090> might

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
very very long strong jab and that might

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.600 
very very long strong jab and that might
be<00:02:37.600> able<00:02:37.720> to<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:38.410> be<00:02:38.560> effective<00:02:39.040> against<00:02:39.340> covel

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610

apocalypse moves better than Gonzales
and<00:02:42.340> whatnot<00:02:42.700> better<00:02:42.970> boxer<00:02:43.350> but<00:02:44.350> just<00:02:45.040> the

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
and whatnot better boxer but just the

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.400 
and whatnot better boxer but just the
size<00:02:45.430> of<00:02:45.670> him<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.060> the<00:02:46.390> strength<00:02:46.750> it<00:02:47.170> would<00:02:47.290> be

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
size of him and the strength it would be

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:49.350 
size of him and the strength it would be
something<00:02:48.040> a<00:02:48.250> bit<00:02:48.340> different<00:02:48.400> that<00:02:48.850> Kovalev

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:49.360 
something a bit different that Kovalev

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.390 
something a bit different that Kovalev
hasn't<00:02:49.660> faced<00:02:49.840> yet<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:50.350> I'd<00:02:50.830> rather<00:02:51.070> see<00:02:51.310> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
hasn't faced yet so I'd rather see the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:54.600 
hasn't faced yet so I'd rather see the

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:01.630 
there out there for him Gonzales maybe a

00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.110 
there out there for him Gonzales maybe a
rematch<00:06:02.020> with<00:06:02.169> Pascal<00:06:02.650> the<00:06:03.490> only<00:06:03.729> thing<00:06:03.880> I<00:06:03.940> can

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:04.120 
rematch with Pascal the only thing I can

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:08.249 
rematch with Pascal the only thing I can
think<00:06:04.180> is<00:06:04.509> maybe<00:06:05.430> if<00:06:06.430> Viterbi<00:06:07.419> 05<00:06:07.719> Stephenson

00:06:08.249 --> 00:06:08.259 
think is maybe if Viterbi 05 Stephenson

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:09.809 
think is maybe if Viterbi 05 Stephenson
which<00:06:08.380> is<00:06:08.500> a<00:06:08.529> fight<00:06:08.740> i<00:06:08.770> think<00:06:09.099> will<00:06:09.250> happen<00:06:09.430> i

00:06:09.809 --> 00:06:09.819 
which is a fight i think will happen i

00:06:09.819 --> 00:06:11.070 
which is a fight i think will happen i
think<00:06:10.090> that<00:06:10.419> fight<00:06:10.569> is<00:06:10.659> going<00:06:10.750> to<00:06:10.840> happen

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
think that fight is going to happen

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.959 
think that fight is going to happen
sooner<00:06:11.349> than<00:06:11.380> people<00:06:11.740> realize<00:06:12.099> a<00:06:12.130> viterbi<00:06:12.729> of

00:06:12.959 --> 00:06:12.969 
sooner than people realize a viterbi of

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:17.100 
sooner than people realize a viterbi of
Stephenson<00:06:13.529> then<00:06:14.529> maybe<00:06:15.599> we<00:06:16.599> might<00:06:16.779> see<00:06:17.080> a

00:06:17.100 --> 00:06:17.110 
Stephenson then maybe we might see a

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.459 
Stephenson then maybe we might see a
viterbi<00:06:17.889> of<00:06:18.219> Kovalev<00:06:18.969> big-time<00:06:19.690> unification

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:20.469 
viterbi of Kovalev big-time unification

00:06:20.469 --> 00:06:22.080 
viterbi of Kovalev big-time unification
if<00:06:20.620> Peter<00:06:20.979> BF<00:06:21.219> is<00:06:21.310> the<00:06:21.430> one<00:06:21.580> to<00:06:21.729> come<00:06:21.880> through

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:22.090 
if Peter BF is the one to come through

if Peter BF is the one to come through
that<00:06:22.150> fight<00:06:22.560> we<00:06:23.560> might<00:06:23.740> see<00:06:23.919> a<00:06:23.949> unification

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.370 
that fight we might see a unification

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:26.370 
that fight we might see a unification
