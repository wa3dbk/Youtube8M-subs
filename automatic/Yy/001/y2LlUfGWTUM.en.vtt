00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
yeah that's not much else actually cuz

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.960 
yeah that's not much else actually cuz
you've<00:02:34.630> got<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:34.990> handbrake<00:02:35.410> on<00:02:35.560> space<00:02:35.970> it's

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:36.970 
you've got to handbrake on space it's

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:39.570 
you've got to handbrake on space it's
been<00:02:37.150> interesting<00:02:37.330> sound<00:02:37.720> effects<00:02:38.580> but

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
been interesting sound effects but

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.200 
been interesting sound effects but
that's<00:02:40.510> far<00:02:40.720> too<00:02:40.750> old<00:02:40.900> guard

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
that's far too old guard

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:50.340 
that's far too old guard
mmm<00:02:44.190> not<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.220> brilliant<00:02:46.030> interior<00:02:48.750> but<00:02:49.750> it's

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:50.350 
mmm not a brilliant interior but it's

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:51.870 
mmm not a brilliant interior but it's
not<00:02:50.500> bad<00:02:50.680> at<00:02:50.830> least<00:02:50.980> it's<00:02:51.190> higher<00:02:51.310> quality<00:02:51.340> and

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
not bad at least it's higher quality and

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.940 
not bad at least it's higher quality and
not<00:02:52.090> really<00:02:52.480> pixelated<00:02:52.870> so<00:02:53.380> I<00:02:53.410> suppose<00:02:53.740> that's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
not really pixelated so I suppose that's

00:02:53.950 --> 00:03:06.580 
not really pixelated so I suppose that's
okay

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.650 

I<00:03:06.620> like<00:03:07.280> the<00:03:07.400> starting<00:03:07.760> all<00:03:07.880> that<00:03:08.120> was<00:03:08.270> good<00:03:08.450> I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
I like the starting all that was good I

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.100 
I like the starting all that was good I
was<00:03:09.350> very<00:03:09.380> good<00:03:09.760> got<00:03:10.760> chrome<00:03:11.330> twin<00:03:11.600> pipes<00:03:11.870> down

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110 
was very good got chrome twin pipes down

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.770 
was very good got chrome twin pipes down
there<00:03:12.380> I<00:03:12.590> like<00:03:13.280> the<00:03:13.430> fact<00:03:13.580> that<00:03:13.670> it's<00:03:13.850> not<00:03:14.060> they

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
there I like the fact that it's not they

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.630 
there I like the fact that it's not they
haven't<00:03:14.990> gone<00:03:15.230> too<00:03:15.470> far<00:03:15.800> with<00:03:15.980> it<00:03:16.070> like<00:03:16.310> chrome

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
haven't gone too far with it like chrome

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.480 
haven't gone too far with it like chrome
in<00:03:16.790> this<00:03:16.910> game<00:03:17.090> never<00:03:17.330> works<00:03:17.690> it<00:03:18.530> looks<00:03:19.040> okay

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:19.490 
in this game never works it looks okay

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.290 
in this game never works it looks okay
no<00:03:20.480> it<00:03:20.630> looks<00:03:20.840> pretty<00:03:21.020> good<00:03:21.140> actually

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:22.300 
no it looks pretty good actually

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:24.460 
no it looks pretty good actually

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
but I do like the starter what does it

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.080 
but I do like the starter what does it
see<00:03:24.620> when<00:03:24.800> you<00:03:24.920> stop<00:03:25.130> it<00:03:27.880> and<00:03:28.880> they're<00:03:29.060> not

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
see when you stop it and they're not

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.390 
see when you stop it and they're not
brilliant<00:03:35.380> yeah<00:03:36.380> it's<00:03:36.500> got<00:03:36.620> a<00:03:36.650> nice<00:03:36.770> that's

pretty cool right so take for a drive
yes<00:03:42.500> the<00:03:42.680> wheel<00:03:42.890> turns<00:03:43.900> something<00:03:44.900> else<00:03:45.080> that

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:45.260

and what else do we have deliver horn

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:26.080 
and what else do we have deliver horn
yeah<00:04:21.100> well<00:04:22.100> I<00:04:22.130> see<00:04:22.400> what<00:04:22.520> you<00:04:22.610> can<00:04:22.820> do<00:04:23.030> them<00:04:25.090> got

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090 
yeah well I see what you can do them got

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.830 
yeah well I see what you can do them got
a<00:04:26.120> pretty<00:04:26.300> good<00:04:26.419> lock<00:04:26.570> on<00:04:26.690> it<00:04:26.840> as<00:04:26.930> well<00:04:28.780> now<00:04:29.780> the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
a pretty good lock on it as well now the

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.230 
a pretty good lock on it as well now the
the<00:04:30.199> brightness<00:04:30.590> don't<00:04:31.160> move<00:04:31.310> the<00:04:32.030> wheels

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:32.240 
the brightness don't move the wheels

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:34.530 
the brightness don't move the wheels
aren't<00:04:32.479> actually<00:04:32.810> attached<00:04:33.110> to<00:04:33.139> anything<00:04:33.530> so

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:34.540 
aren't actually attached to anything so

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.350 
aren't actually attached to anything so
mmm

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:37.360 
mmm

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:39.430 
mmm
there's<00:04:38.360> but<00:04:38.510> it's<00:04:38.630> a<00:04:38.690> good<00:04:38.840> mod<00:04:39.020> overall<00:04:39.410> I

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:39.440 
there's but it's a good mod overall I

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.379 
there's but it's a good mod overall I
mean<00:04:39.560> so<00:04:39.889> far<00:04:40.100> it<00:04:40.490> accelerates<00:04:41.030> a<00:04:41.120> bit<00:04:41.270> too

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:41.389 
mean so far it accelerates a bit too

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:50.020 
mean so far it accelerates a bit too
quickly<00:04:44.199> I<00:04:45.199> think<00:04:45.470> it<00:04:45.650> could<00:04:45.830> work

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:50.030 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:52.340 

it<00:04:51.030> was<00:04:51.180> quite<00:04:51.330> nicely<00:04:51.540> weighted<00:04:51.840> it's<00:04:52.170> not

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:52.350 
it was quite nicely weighted it's not

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.010 
it was quite nicely weighted it's not
like<00:04:52.530> bouncing<00:04:53.130> around<00:04:53.220> and<00:04:53.460> flying<00:04:53.640> around

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:54.020 
like bouncing around and flying around

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:56.540 
like bouncing around and flying around
it<00:04:55.020> was<00:04:55.170> different<00:04:55.380> I<00:04:55.740> had<00:04:55.860> some<00:04:56.250> trouble<00:04:56.520> that

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
it was different I had some trouble that

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.030 
it was different I had some trouble that
with<00:04:56.850> a<00:04:57.320> lorry<00:04:58.320> I<00:04:58.410> was<00:04:58.590> looking<00:04:58.860> at<00:04:58.920> the<00:04:59.010> other

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040 
with a lorry I was looking at the other

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.740 
with a lorry I was looking at the other
day<00:04:59.600> so<00:05:00.600> I'm<00:05:00.720> quite<00:05:00.870> happy<00:05:01.080> I'm<00:05:01.740> fairly<00:05:01.950> happy

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:02.750 
day so I'm quite happy I'm fairly happy

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.940
