00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:01.670 
sense of discipline I think people keep

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:03.969 
sense of discipline I think people keep
coming<00:02:01.970> back<00:02:02.119> to<00:02:02.180> sports<00:02:02.570> movies<00:02:02.979> because

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
coming back to sports movies because

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:05.529 
coming back to sports movies because
there's<00:02:04.160> something<00:02:04.460> about<00:02:04.580> the<00:02:05.119> spirit<00:02:05.479> of

00:02:05.529 --> 00:02:05.539 
there's something about the spirit of

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:08.529 
there's something about the spirit of
competition<00:02:06.039> that<00:02:07.039> just<00:02:07.340> pulls<00:02:07.580> you<00:02:07.759> in<00:02:07.940> you

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:08.539 
competition that just pulls you in you

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.080 
competition that just pulls you in you
do<00:02:08.810> want<00:02:09.080> your<00:02:09.289> heroes<00:02:09.679> to<00:02:09.920> win<00:02:10.130> you<00:02:10.610> do<00:02:10.850> want

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
do want your heroes to win you do want

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.020 
do want your heroes to win you do want
them<00:02:11.270> to<00:02:11.420> triumph<00:02:11.660> over<00:02:12.080> adversity<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:13.640> I

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
them to triumph over adversity and I

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.460 
them to triumph over adversity and I
think<00:02:14.239> what<00:02:14.360> this<00:02:14.540> movie<00:02:14.750> is<00:02:14.900> trying<00:02:15.200> to<00:02:15.290> say

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
think what this movie is trying to say

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.900 
think what this movie is trying to say
because<00:02:15.920> we<00:02:16.160> know<00:02:16.340> that<00:02:16.370> our<00:02:16.850> guys<00:02:17.230> went<00:02:18.230> a<00:02:18.290> lot

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:18.910 
because we know that our guys went a lot

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:21.160 
because we know that our guys went a lot
what<00:02:19.910> we're<00:02:20.090> trying<00:02:20.270> to<00:02:20.420> say<00:02:20.510> in<00:02:20.720> this<00:02:20.810> movie

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
what we're trying to say in this movie

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.780 
what we're trying to say in this movie
is<00:02:21.260> that<00:02:21.380> victory<00:02:21.830> doesn't<00:02:22.160> always<00:02:22.550> mean<00:02:22.730> what

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
is that victory doesn't always mean what

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:25.720 
is that victory doesn't always mean what
you<00:02:23.090> think<00:02:23.120> it<00:02:23.480> means<00:02:23.750> and<00:02:24.050> so<00:02:24.739> we<00:02:25.220> want<00:02:25.519> the

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
you think it means and so we want the

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:27.850 
you think it means and so we want the
audience<00:02:25.910> to<00:02:26.269> buy<00:02:26.840> into<00:02:27.050> that<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.530> that's<00:02:27.709> the

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
audience to buy into that and that's the

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.290 
audience to buy into that and that's the
challenge<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.400> this<00:02:28.550> movie<00:02:28.880> and<00:02:28.970> I<00:02:29.060> think

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:29.300 
challenge of this movie and I think

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.240 
challenge of this movie and I think
we've<00:02:29.450> met<00:02:29.660> it<00:02:29.840> which<00:02:30.260> is<00:02:30.440> to<00:02:30.620> pull<00:02:30.860> people

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
we've met it which is to pull people

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.580 
we've met it which is to pull people
into<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:32.150> only<00:02:32.420> that<00:02:32.570> victory<00:02:33.019> on<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> field

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:33.590 
into not only that victory on the field

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.230 
into not only that victory on the field
but<00:02:34.370> a<00:02:34.640> higher<00:02:35.150> level<00:02:35.540> of<00:02:35.600> victory<00:02:35.959> as<00:02:36.050> well
