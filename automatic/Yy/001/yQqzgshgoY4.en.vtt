00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.589
 Hello everyone welcome to ixtem motorcycle 

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.940
 so how to choose your battery 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:09.900
 among all the brands and 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.670
 technologies that exist 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.379
 how to put them into service and how 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.330
 well maintain them to maximize their 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.710
 life time little buying guide in 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.210
 imagery 

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:19.920
 so we start with a battery at 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.050
 chance there were four high is a 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.340
 dry battery no first category of 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.929
 batteries the dry batteries that are 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.949
 so delivered without acid when you 

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:27.769
 receive it will have to put acid 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.189
 in to activate them we recognize them 

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:33.899
 to their translucent body so that's it 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.489
 a waza yuasa brand battery is 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:37.469
 rather the high end in the battery 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 conventional is the team brand 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.879
 almost all motorcycles in first 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.559
 goes up and that's even this mark actually 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.449
 who gave his name to all the others 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.430
 batteries it became the standard the way 

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:48.870
 whose oise has called the batteries so 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.090
 for filling how is it going 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.859
 you have little corks on the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.199
 on top of you hosts and you fill 

00:00:52.859 --> 00:00:56.760
 of acid leave you half an hour of 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.170
 gas and the battery you redone 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.760
 possibly if needed 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.769
 to the next level and you 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.520
 close the little cap and the 

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:06.390
 battery is ready to use 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.850
 so after the dry batteries 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.070
 we have the batteries with acid so there 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.510
 it's a battery of the mark ps so 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.860
 that's a great compromise it's a 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.090
 good value for money it's rather 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.620
 the ideal when you want to replace 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.690
 your your original battery 

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.530
 it is a y tx9 bs so that of 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.210
 very common battery that we will 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.470
 find on a lot of 600 bikes and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 of the scooter 125 so the bs y tx9 ps with 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.450
 acid 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.280
 so you have bundled with the battery 1 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.930
 small containers that contain 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.020
 the acid so to put it into service 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:36.480
 you take off the little end there that seals 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:37.830
 the compartments overturn you 

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.000
 acid tanks on it you hit 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:42.270
 you are an excellent fulfill 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.700
 the same you leave gas and a 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.200
 little half hour and then you know the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.580
 battery with the little plugs that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.070
 are provided and its ready to be 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.080
 used 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.580
 so then we have the gel batteries 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.200
 so here illustrated with a model of the 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.310
 panther brand has more or panther has 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960
 the more it's a brand then you're not going 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:00.030
 not find all types of batteries 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.770
 in this brand it's really a 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.910
 brand that makes prices very attractive 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.780
 but hey if you have machines a 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.670
 little exotic you do not necessarily 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.990
 found the model so gel battery 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.729
 tired of the batteries that you receive that 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.970
 are ready for study and to be used 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.760
 is the difference with the two 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.020
 previous is that we do not have here 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.450
 electro liquid actually we do not have 

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:17.470
 liquid sitting is gelled and it's going 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.580
 allow this battery to be 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.440
 lying down 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.030
 which is not the case of both models 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.440
 precedents so yielded possible and that's 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:24.760
 at home with acid are to be installed in 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.260
 right position there the age she you 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.590
 can put it lying down 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.700
 for example that's what goes on a bmw 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.710
 then fourth and last category of 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:34.600
 battery the lithium batteries so 

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.680
 here in the brand sky reach there we go out 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.670
 a little bit of batteries 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.560
 conventional with three types 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.320
 has seen before lithium batteries that's 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.630
 a technology quite recent that 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.720
 sky reach quite mastery it's 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.340
 really a brand that has developed a 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:49.900
 know-how and benchmarks on this type 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:51.430
 of product that is very reliable and 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.350
 Besides, it's going to be the first world 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:56.050
 on ducati from 2014 on some 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:57.250
 sports models of the mark then 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.600
 the interest of lithium batteries so 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.910
 are ready for use as soon as you 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.080
 receive there is nothing to stop 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.840
 battery cds that have a clutter and 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:06.390
 an extremely reduced weight compared to 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.939
 their counterparts 

00:03:06.390 --> 00:03:11.470
 conventional acid so that's going a big 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.340
 interest in sports research 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:16.450
 gained in weight that also at once 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.689
 a term says a lot a lot more 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.819
 long 

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:20.470
 that's not it's not going down in the 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:23.170
 time the performances remain rest 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.909
 identical in time and then on the 

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:26.799
 sky rich gold model little trick 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:28.959
 friendly you have a tester that is 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.099
 built-in battery so a small 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.590
 press the test button wanted 

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:34.739
 right away the state of your battery 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.269
 so maybe this type of battery 

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:40.569
 so like any product so you 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:42.909
 want to maximize their lifespan we 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:43.440
 before the privatization of 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:45.159
 reload them 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.480
 and then for the batteries 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:49.209
 conventional so with acid or at 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.739
 gel to keep them a long time and in any 

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.040
 case preserve their performance in the 

00:03:50.739 --> 00:03:52.930
 duration 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.250
 the best is to have a small charger 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.930
 with maintenance function that will delay 

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:57.370
 the sulphate phenomena to sion so 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:59.079
 we at i stem we have three models of 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.510
 chargers with function now this 

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.579
 that we like there is the cex these 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.430
 techniques 16,08 that a good little product 

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:08.280
 very compact easy to use that does not 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.959
 will apply only to the motorcycle on the other hand 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.370
 equivalent a little aloxi misr 900 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:14.290
 from oxford a little product to a 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.340
 fifty euros so all the bugs 

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:16.630
 maintenance function and then you have 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.810
 optimum kate is a little 

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:20.620
 more efficient which will allow 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.609
 charging is also your car 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:23.470
 your car battery if you 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:25.599
 want and then that there is a function and 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.310
 can bus so if you have a bm or a 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:29.199
 ducati with the bus can socket you can 

00:04:27.310 --> 00:04:29.669
 connect it directly via this 

00:04:29.199 --> 00:04:33.400
 interface 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:35.669
 Thank you all and see you soon for 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.669
 new videos
