with<00:00:10.200> his<00:00:10.380> I<00:00:10.620> guess<00:00:10.830> it's<00:00:11.099> called<00:00:11.250> the

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
with his I guess it's called the

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.030 
with his I guess it's called the
beginning<00:00:11.790> because<00:00:12.059> it's<00:00:12.500> his<00:00:13.500> original

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
beginning because it's his original

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.900 
beginning because it's his original

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
not that impressed with it I'm probably

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.830 
not that impressed with it I'm probably
going<00:00:40.200> to<00:00:40.260> sell<00:00:40.530> it<00:00:40.770> in<00:00:40.920> a<00:00:41.010> number<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.399> months

00:00:41.830 --> 00:00:41.840 
going to sell it in a number of months

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:44.690 
going to sell it in a number of months
but<00:00:42.840> I<00:00:42.870> feel<00:00:43.320> as<00:00:43.440> was<00:00:43.680> making<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.100> worth<00:00:44.430> making

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
but I feel as was making it worth making

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.979 
but I feel as was making it worth making
a<00:00:44.940> video<00:00:45.210> because<00:00:45.480> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.840> big<00:00:46.050> spawn<00:00:46.550> collector

00:00:47.979 --> 00:00:47.989 
a video because of a big spawn collector

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.080 
a video because of a big spawn collector
toy<00:00:48.989> collector<00:00:49.530> and<00:00:49.739> is<00:00:50.280> only<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.640> second

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
toy collector and is only the second

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000 
toy collector and is only the second
spawn<00:00:51.360> residence<00:00:51.809> actually<00:00:52.230> ever<00:00:52.590> made<00:00:52.800> and

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
spawn residence actually ever made and

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:54.529 
spawn residence actually ever made and
it<00:00:53.100> looked<00:00:53.309> pretty<00:00:53.550> decent<00:00:53.910> from<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
it looked pretty decent from the

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.680 
it looked pretty decent from the
pictures<00:00:55.020> but<00:00:55.829> I<00:00:56.309> just<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.239> think<00:00:57.390> it's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
pictures but I just don't think it's

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.490 
pictures but I just don't think it's
that<00:00:57.840> great<00:00:59.239> really<00:01:00.239> like<00:01:00.780> one<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.289> things

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
that great really like one of the things

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.350 
that great really like one of the things
is<00:01:01.770> like<00:01:01.980> his<00:01:02.190> head<00:01:07.670> come<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.790> focus<00:01:09.030> on<00:01:09.270> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is like his head come on focus on the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.469 
is like his head come on focus on the
head<00:01:10.490> his<00:01:11.490> head<00:01:11.729> doesn't<00:01:11.939> look<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.150> great

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
head his head doesn't look that great

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:16.370 
head his head doesn't look that great
it's<00:01:12.810> it's<00:01:13.020> big<00:01:13.380> his<00:01:14.280> head<00:01:14.310> is<00:01:14.580> big<00:01:15.420> is<00:01:15.689> big<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
it's it's big his head is big is big and

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.700 
it's it's big his head is big is big and
uh<00:01:16.530> I<00:01:17.090> mean<00:01:18.090> the<00:01:18.479> expression<00:01:18.900> isn't<00:01:19.320> that<00:01:19.530> good

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
uh I mean the expression isn't that good

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.530 
uh I mean the expression isn't that good
is<00:01:19.799> weird<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.549> you<00:01:20.700> could<00:01:20.820> see<00:01:21.060> those<00:01:21.240> eyes

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
is weird if you could see those eyes

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.920 
is weird if you could see those eyes
eyebrows<00:01:22.380> like<00:01:22.830> come<00:01:23.100> down<00:01:23.479> and<00:01:24.479> his<00:01:24.689> eyes

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
eyebrows like come down and his eyes

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.990 
eyebrows like come down and his eyes
don't<00:01:25.350> look<00:01:25.500> that<00:01:25.650> cool<00:01:25.920> like<00:01:26.340> the<00:01:26.490> face<00:01:26.759> just

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
don't look that cool like the face just

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.590 
don't look that cool like the face just
doesn't<00:01:27.330> look<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.450> cool<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:32.000> the<00:01:33.000> face<00:01:33.270> just

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
doesn't look that cool and the face just

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.620 
doesn't look that cool and the face just
doesn't<00:01:33.900> look<00:01:34.020> that<00:01:34.049> cool<00:01:34.530> so<00:01:35.520> it's<00:01:36.450> rather

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
doesn't look that cool so it's rather

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.580 
doesn't look that cool so it's rather
the<00:01:36.900> bad<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.439> those<00:01:37.860> two<00:01:38.159> little<00:01:39.590> skulls

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the bad and those two little skulls

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.770 
the bad and those two little skulls
would<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.820> mean<00:01:42.030> that<00:01:42.210> they<00:01:42.360> don't<00:01:42.479> with

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
would think I mean that they don't with

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.080 
would think I mean that they don't with
a<00:01:42.810> little<00:01:43.140> chain<00:01:43.640> they<00:01:44.640> don't<00:01:44.909> look<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
a little chain they don't look that

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.780 
a little chain they don't look that
great<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.930> in<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.229> spawn<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:46.920> Jacke<00:01:47.430> guy

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
great and in this spawn is a Jacke guy

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.760 
great and in this spawn is a Jacke guy
and<00:01:48.299> this<00:01:48.540> is<00:01:48.869> like<00:01:49.110> body<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.740> quite<00:01:50.130> thin<00:01:51.770> yeah

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
and this is like body is quite thin yeah

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.740 
and this is like body is quite thin yeah
so<00:01:53.189> this<00:01:53.909> figure<00:01:54.119> actually<00:01:54.299> looks<00:01:54.630> better

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
so this figure actually looks better

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.719 
so this figure actually looks better
from<00:01:55.020> far<00:01:55.049> away<00:01:55.560> look<00:01:55.950> at<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.159> from<00:01:56.280> far<00:01:56.340> away

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
from far away look at it from far away

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.910 
from far away look at it from far away
it<00:01:57.060> looks<00:01:57.180> really<00:01:57.750> cool<00:01:57.899> from<00:01:58.170> far<00:01:58.409> away<00:01:58.590> but

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920 
it looks really cool from far away but

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.700 
it looks really cool from far away but
when<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.100> get<00:01:59.250> up<00:01:59.310> close<00:02:00.290> it's<00:02:01.290> not<00:02:01.380> that

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
when you get up close it's not that

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.209 
when you get up close it's not that
great<00:02:02.000> so<00:02:03.000> I<00:02:03.450> guess<00:02:03.899> I'm<00:02:04.140> I<00:02:04.320> am<00:02:04.500> making<00:02:04.950> more

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
great so I guess I'm I am making more

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.910 
great so I guess I'm I am making more
