look<00:02:02.549> through<00:02:02.850> there<00:02:03.090> which<00:02:03.869> enables<00:02:04.289> you<00:02:04.350> to

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
look through there which enables you to

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:07.719 
look through there which enables you to
use<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.710> camera<00:02:05.009> sort<00:02:05.189> of<00:02:05.280> handheld<00:02:06.649> and

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
use the camera sort of handheld and

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.430 
use the camera sort of handheld and
right<00:02:08.729> so<00:02:09.000> there<00:02:09.390> we<00:02:09.509> go<00:02:09.660> so<00:02:09.899> as<00:02:09.990> you<00:02:10.110> can<00:02:10.259> see

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
right so there we go so as you can see

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.630 
right so there we go so as you can see
you<00:02:10.800> can<00:02:10.950> look<00:02:11.070> through<00:02:11.220> there

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you can look through there

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.840 
you can look through there
how<00:02:11.730> many<00:02:11.910> you<00:02:12.390> grow<00:02:12.600> and<00:02:12.900> the<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.430> camera

there's no exposure controls in the

you've got on the side you probably

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:36.899 
you've got on the side you probably
might<00:02:35.140> just<00:02:35.379> be<00:02:35.470> able<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:35.650> make<00:02:35.799> out<00:02:36.010> there<00:02:36.250> if

00:02:36.899 --> 00:02:36.909 
might just be able to make out there if

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:39.449 
might just be able to make out there if
you've<00:02:37.150> got<00:02:37.360> shutter<00:02:37.900> speeds<00:02:38.290> with<00:02:38.860> bulb<00:02:39.159> and

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
you've got shutter speeds with bulb and

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.020 
you've got shutter speeds with bulb and
then<00:02:40.239> 500th<00:02:40.959> of<00:02:41.079> a<00:02:41.200> second<00:02:41.790> sorry<00:02:42.790> five

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
then 500th of a second sorry five

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:45.660 
then 500th of a second sorry five
hundred<00:02:43.060> a<00:02:43.269> second<00:02:43.659> down<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.930> bulb<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.670> then

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
hundred a second down to bulb and then

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:46.920 
hundred a second down to bulb and then
we've<00:02:45.849> got<00:02:46.090> on<00:02:46.269> the<00:02:46.450> lens

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
we've got on the lens

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.179 
we've got on the lens
we've<00:02:47.140> got<00:02:47.349> from<00:02:47.799> F<00:02:48.010> 32<00:02:48.810> that's<00:02:49.810> F<00:02:50.140> 2.8<00:02:50.859> on<00:02:51.069> this

00:02:51.179 --> 00:02:51.189 
we've got from F 32 that's F 2.8 on this

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.229 
we've got from F 32 that's F 2.8 on this
particular<00:02:51.549> lens<00:02:52.590> and<00:02:53.590> then<00:02:53.709> to<00:02:53.829> focus<00:02:54.280> it<00:02:54.459> we

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:55.239 
particular lens and then to focus it we

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.800 
particular lens and then to focus it we
do<00:02:55.390> this<00:02:55.629> and<00:02:56.560> so<00:02:57.010> as<00:02:57.340> we<00:02:58.090> look<00:02:58.120> down<00:02:58.540> in<00:02:58.750> the

00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:58.810 
do this and so as we look down in the

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:59.940 
do this and so as we look down in the
camera<00:02:59.230> it's<00:02:59.409> going<00:02:59.470> to<00:02:59.590> be<00:02:59.650> a<00:02:59.680> little<00:02:59.829> bit

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
camera it's going to be a little bit

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:07.140 
camera it's going to be a little bit
difficult<00:03:00.129> for<00:03:00.430> you<00:03:00.549> to<00:03:01.799> see<00:03:02.799> this<00:03:03.190> but<00:03:03.489> I<00:03:06.150> push

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
difficult for you to see this but I push

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.360 
difficult for you to see this but I push
the<00:03:07.359> bellows<00:03:07.810> in<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.769> out<00:03:09.299> to<00:03:10.299> focus<00:03:10.870> it<00:03:11.109> and

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:11.370 
the bellows in and out to focus it and

00:03:11.370 --> 00:03:14.520 
the bellows in and out to focus it and
then<00:03:12.370> you<00:03:12.489> would<00:03:12.609> take<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.939> picture<00:03:13.329> now<00:03:13.540> a

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
then you would take the picture now a

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:16.500 
then you would take the picture now a
different<00:03:14.889> thing<00:03:15.280> is<00:03:15.459> how<00:03:15.639> you<00:03:15.879> actually<00:03:16.239> wind

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
different thing is how you actually wind

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:18.360 
different thing is how you actually wind
the<00:03:16.629> camera<00:03:16.959> and<00:03:17.200> this<00:03:17.260> is<00:03:17.409> the<00:03:17.500> combat<00:03:17.799> so<00:03:18.310> you

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
the camera and this is the combat so you

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:20.729 
the camera and this is the combat so you
turns<00:03:18.579> out<00:03:18.670> the<00:03:18.760> camera<00:03:19.000> on<00:03:19.090> a<00:03:19.120> tripod<00:03:19.180> and<00:03:19.780> you

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
turns out the camera on a tripod and you

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.220 
turns out the camera on a tripod and you
all<00:03:21.189> you're<00:03:21.340> doing<00:03:21.549> is<00:03:21.700> you<00:03:22.540> wind<00:03:22.720> in<00:03:22.870> this<00:03:23.019> on

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:23.230 
all you're doing is you wind in this on

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.099 
all you're doing is you wind in this on
and<00:03:23.579> then<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:24.670> wind<00:03:24.909> it<00:03:25.060> back<00:03:25.209> and<00:03:25.510> then<00:03:26.079> you

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:26.109 
and then you wind it back and then you

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:28.619 
and then you wind it back and then you
press<00:03:26.349> the<00:03:26.379> shutter<00:03:26.650> which<00:03:27.069> is<00:03:27.299> down<00:03:28.299> the<00:03:28.420> side

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:28.629 
press the shutter which is down the side

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:30.509 
press the shutter which is down the side
there<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.109> then<00:03:29.650> it<00:03:29.769> would<00:03:29.859> take<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.160> picture

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
there and then it would take the picture

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:31.979 
there and then it would take the picture
I've<00:03:30.910> got<00:03:31.090> though<00:03:31.209> filming<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:31.660> one<00:03:31.840> at<00:03:31.930> the

00:03:31.979 --> 00:03:31.989 
I've got though filming this one at the

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:33.259 
I've got though filming this one at the
moment<00:03:32.079> it's<00:03:32.410> not<00:03:32.500> going<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.739> do<00:03:32.859> it<00:03:32.949> that<00:03:33.069> way

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
moment it's not going to do it that way

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:36.150 
moment it's not going to do it that way
and<00:03:34.269> then<00:03:34.510> when<00:03:34.629> you<00:03:34.690> want<00:03:34.780> to<00:03:34.900> take<00:03:35.160> change

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
and then when you want to take change

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.580 
and then when you want to take change
your<00:03:36.370> lens<00:03:36.609> you<00:03:37.000> actually<00:03:37.870> take<00:03:38.049> hold<00:03:38.379> of<00:03:38.470> the

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
your lens you actually take hold of the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.530 
your lens you actually take hold of the
front<00:03:38.829> lens<00:03:39.010> element<00:03:39.430> off<00:03:39.609> and<00:03:39.940> as<00:03:40.239> you<00:03:40.329> can

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
front lens element off and as you can

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:41.640 
front lens element off and as you can
see<00:03:40.690> on<00:03:40.780> the<00:03:40.870> replacement<00:03:41.349> lens

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
see on the replacement lens

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:43.409 
see on the replacement lens
you've<00:03:42.010> got<00:03:42.190> only<00:03:42.370> shutter<00:03:42.909> and<00:03:43.180> aperture

00:03:43.409 --> 00:03:43.419 
you've got only shutter and aperture

00:03:43.419 --> 00:03:49.080 
you've got only shutter and aperture
assembly<00:03:44.079> there<00:03:45.419> the<00:03:46.419> mir<00:03:46.930> c-33<00:03:47.859> was<00:03:48.280> around

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
assembly there the mir c-33 was around

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.680 
assembly there the mir c-33 was around
from<00:03:49.449> about<00:03:49.780> I<00:03:50.669> think<00:03:51.669> it<00:03:51.760> was<00:03:51.849> the<00:03:51.909> late<00:03:52.090> 60's

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:52.690 
from about I think it was the late 60's

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.500 
from about I think it was the late 60's
to<00:03:53.199> the<00:03:53.230> mid<00:03:53.319> 70s<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:55.000> was<00:03:55.090> it<00:03:55.299> would<00:03:55.389> be

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
to the mid 70s and it was it would be

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:56.819 
to the mid 70s and it was it would be
like<00:03:55.690> I<00:03:56.079> guess<00:03:56.379> like<00:03:56.560> a<00:03:56.590> wedding

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:56.829 
like I guess like a wedding

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
finder that you look down through it

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:20.729 
finder that you look down through it
really<00:04:18.070> slowed<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.639> down<00:04:19.440> because<00:04:20.440> you're

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
really slowed you down because you're

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:22.830 
really slowed you down because you're
checking<00:04:20.919> your<00:04:21.130> focus<00:04:21.579> and<00:04:21.729> as<00:04:21.849> equal<00:04:22.210> this

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
checking your focus and as equal this

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.180 
checking your focus and as equal this
see<00:04:23.289> that<00:04:23.320> thing<00:04:23.620> there<00:04:23.650> that's<00:04:23.949> like<00:04:24.099> a

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
see that thing there that's like a

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.409 
see that thing there that's like a
magnifying<00:04:24.699> glass<00:04:24.880> so<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.060> can<00:04:25.180> really

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
magnifying glass so you can really

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.240 
magnifying glass so you can really
double<00:04:25.810> check<00:04:25.990> your<00:04:26.110> focus<00:04:26.320> very<00:04:26.740> carefully

as well and it just slows you down and
makes<00:04:30.159> you<00:04:30.280> really<00:04:30.520> think<00:04:30.639> about<00:04:30.940> the

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
makes you really think about the

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.379 
makes you really think about the
composition<00:04:31.539> of<00:04:31.810> your<00:04:32.260> photographs

00:04:33.379 --> 00:04:33.389

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:40.600 
square negative this huge negative which

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.439

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:49.840 
millimeters with a bellows type is that

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:52.710 
millimeters with a bellows type is that
they<00:04:49.960> can<00:04:50.110> do<00:04:50.199> very<00:04:50.470> very<00:04:50.740> close<00:04:51.040> work<00:04:51.720> indeed

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
they can do very very close work indeed

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.210 
they can do very very close work indeed
because<00:04:53.139> as<00:04:53.260> you're<00:04:53.440> taking<00:04:53.590> this<00:04:53.919> bellows

out<00:04:54.460> you<00:04:54.669> can<00:04:54.790> get<00:04:54.940> right<00:04:55.510> up<00:04:55.750> to<00:04:56.020> very<00:04:56.350> very

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:56.410 
out you can get right up to very very

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:58.379 
out you can get right up to very very
close<00:04:56.770> to<00:04:56.860> these<00:04:56.979> subjects<00:04:57.490> to<00:04:57.610> do<00:04:57.760> macro<00:04:58.150> work

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:58.389 
close to these subjects to do macro work

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:00.180 
close to these subjects to do macro work
you've<00:04:59.229> just<00:04:59.410> got<00:04:59.560> to<00:04:59.590> be<00:04:59.740> a<00:04:59.770> little<00:04:59.979> bit

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
you've just got to be a little bit

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:02.040 
you've just got to be a little bit
careful<00:05:00.880> because<00:05:00.910> you<00:05:01.330> have<00:05:01.479> the<00:05:01.600> difference

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
careful because you have the difference

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:03.540 
careful because you have the difference
in<00:05:02.229> between<00:05:02.350> the<00:05:02.710> viewing<00:05:03.070> angles<00:05:03.400> of<00:05:03.520> both

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:03.550 
in between the viewing angles of both

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.060 
in between the viewing angles of both
lenses<00:05:04.000> but<00:05:04.449> seeing<00:05:04.900> the<00:05:05.020> finder<00:05:05.530> at<00:05:05.650> the<00:05:05.770> top

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:06.070 
lenses but seeing the finder at the top

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.010 
lenses but seeing the finder at the top
you<00:05:06.340> might<00:05:06.520> just<00:05:06.729> be<00:05:06.910> able<00:05:06.970> to<00:05:07.150> see<00:05:07.449> it<00:05:07.510> there's

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:08.020 
you might just be able to see it there's

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.020 
you might just be able to see it there's
like<00:05:08.110> a<00:05:08.169> line<00:05:08.620> that<00:05:08.919> comes<00:05:09.190> down<00:05:09.520> that<00:05:09.789> tells

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:10.030 
like a line that comes down that tells

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.909 
like a line that comes down that tells
you<00:05:10.180> where<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.360> top<00:05:10.660> of<00:05:10.780> the<00:05:10.870> frame<00:05:11.169> is<00:05:11.350> so<00:05:11.830> you

00:05:11.909 --> 00:05:11.919 
you where the top of the frame is so you

00:05:11.919 --> 00:05:14.390 
you where the top of the frame is so you
can<00:05:12.130> adjust<00:05:12.580> your<00:05:13.180> angle<00:05:13.330> of<00:05:13.630> view<00:05:13.990> and

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
can adjust your angle of view and

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.920 
can adjust your angle of view and
accordingly<00:05:15.400> then<00:05:16.240> on<00:05:16.389> the<00:05:16.510> side<00:05:16.720> we've<00:05:16.900> got

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
accordingly then on the side we've got

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:19.890 
accordingly then on the side we've got
all<00:05:17.169> that<00:05:17.289> and<00:05:17.460> depth<00:05:18.460> of<00:05:18.669> field<00:05:19.000> and<00:05:19.810> the

distance markings there and as I say you

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.670 
distance markings there and as I say you
tend<00:05:25.030> to<00:05:25.090> find<00:05:25.330> these<00:05:25.449> things<00:05:25.660> on<00:05:25.990> eBay<00:05:26.500> this

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.270 
super sharp shots and what normally
happens<00:05:40.090> is<00:05:40.599> on<00:05:40.720> the<00:05:40.750> side<00:05:41.110> there's<00:05:41.530> a<00:05:41.590> lever

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:42.280 
happens is on the side there's a lever

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.190 
happens is on the side there's a lever
I<00:05:42.430> think<00:05:42.729> it's<00:05:42.849> that<00:05:42.970> on<00:05:43.180> there<00:05:43.360> this<00:05:43.510> turn<00:05:43.930> and

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:44.200 
I think it's that on there this turn and

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:47.430 
I think it's that on there this turn and
it<00:05:44.260> flips<00:05:44.590> a<00:05:44.860> window<00:05:45.820> up<00:05:45.970> to<00:05:46.300> block<00:05:46.630> the<00:05:47.139> front

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:47.440 
it flips a window up to block the front

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.050 
it flips a window up to block the front
of<00:05:47.590> the<00:05:47.680> camera<00:05:47.889> so<00:05:48.190> that<00:05:48.220> you<00:05:48.340> can<00:05:48.520> change<00:05:48.849> the

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
of the camera so that you can change the

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.089 
of the camera so that you can change the
lenses<00:05:49.389> while<00:05:49.599> you've<00:05:49.750> got<00:05:49.780> film<00:05:50.229> in<00:05:50.320> it<00:05:50.440> in<00:05:50.800> my

00:05:51.089 --> 00:05:51.099 
lenses while you've got film in it in my

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.460 
lenses while you've got film in it in my
particular<00:05:51.250> model<00:05:52.240> that<00:05:52.270> isn't<00:05:52.810> working<00:05:53.200> so
