00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:38.879
 I got a tattoo until I put it on Facebook. 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.950

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.149

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.180
 telling you more or less what happened 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.530
 for you to have an idea I just finished 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.960
 filming there 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.690
 julio the friend was together with him 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:57.719
 made the images and so I have a 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.059
 tattoo and a tournament has some 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.219
 tattoos but on this right arm besides 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.159
 frames which is here that you already 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.260
 saw a v-twin engine here yesterday in 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:10.320
 side of the arm and a plate that 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.970
 top of this board the v twin 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.650
 meant the first time what the 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.189
 pilot has a radio in a vector in 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:23.580
 In the United States, I rented a motorcycle. 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:26.180
 By the time I had to 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.470
 I went to wash the car 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:34.040
 It's motorcycle and then it was actually this 

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:36.800
 tattoo was to symbolize even this 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.640
 moment of my life 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.840
 and then the frames came with color this world 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.840
 motorcycle, right? 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:50.090
 they made to compose this world and 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:55.070
 I was still writing the tattoo 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:58.070
 themed motorcycle bottom of fire at last 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.259
 and then I made a career this time it's a 

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:05.710
 open mouth skull band 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.710
 It's a favela that's right here in front of you. 

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:12.890
 at me like faces the beholder well 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:16.070
 here in my arm very close to the fold 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:18.830
 cassava is well in the left arm and there 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:20.840
 I did the tracing of her I did some 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.670
 images must be seen to avoid seeing 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:27.260
 now it has a 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:30.470
 skull and everything else then more 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.709
 ahead it will be black and gray right and then 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:35.959
 She's going to trace some here. 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.090
 a month and a little we're going and we're going 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:40.330
 finish it so it is not finished 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:43.360
 That's why we saw part 1 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.920
 And then who made it for me is the tattoo was the 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.010
 pretty face 

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:50.710
 the handsome artist who has worked on 

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:52.960
 tattoo you already worked on the lecs he 

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:55.030
 Size LED already has a little time ago and 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:57.910
 is now only serving in the studio 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:01.830
 from him where staff reads 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:05.710
 so if anyone is interested and 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.590
 send a message that we the people 

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:14.770
 talk and I have to avoid everything else 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:17.620
 it only takes bigger trick so that's because 

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:23.200
 How does he attend under an appointment? 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:25.660
 he charges the session right then he just 

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:28.000
 makes bigger rags the more you want 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:30.970
 make a star you want to do 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.910
 something small does not work and he 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.830
 because it will look better on you in a 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.290
 place you will take three to two 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:41.350
 months to do better if already in place 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:45.069
 more goes in the studio already open and arrives and 

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:48.099
 do it then 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:51.579
 Good, I hope you enjoyed the 

00:03:48.099 --> 00:03:56.349
 tattoo she'll make up all this 

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:58.180
 scenery still motorcycle and it will be me 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.709
 I really liked the fact that now we 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:04.180
 can not see right is not because 

00:03:59.709 --> 00:04:08.139
 she just drawn but ended with us 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:11.079
 can see better in the next session 

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:13.959
 and it's going to paint shade and then it goes 

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:18.549
 show up cool, it's gonna be very cool 

00:04:13.959 --> 00:04:21.599
 well realistic and that's it then 

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:25.720

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:29.080

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.669

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.110
