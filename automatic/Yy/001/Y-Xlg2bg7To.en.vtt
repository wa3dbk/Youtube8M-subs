00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
increased production so when we move the

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.929 
increased production so when we move the
cows<00:01:21.689> in<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:21.990> in<00:01:22.200> 2009<00:01:23.040> it<00:01:23.280> allowed<00:01:23.520> us<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.670> go

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
cows in here in 2009 it allowed us to go

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060

hours which is three times a day

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.560 
hours which is three times a day
increased<00:01:28.290> our<00:01:28.470> production<00:01:28.860> about<00:01:29.280> 15%<00:01:29.729> for

increased our production about 15% for
that<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.020> then<00:01:31.110> probably<00:01:31.320> gained<00:01:31.560> another<00:01:31.829> 15

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
that and then probably gained another 15

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:34.520 
that and then probably gained another 15
or<00:01:32.250> 20<00:01:32.700> just<00:01:32.939> because<00:01:33.299> of<00:01:33.479> cow<00:01:33.659> comforts<00:01:34.229> and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
just how far will they go for comfort
