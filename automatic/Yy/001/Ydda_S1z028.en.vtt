00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:05.270 
okay I'm gonna show you how to make a

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.799 
okay I'm gonna show you how to make a
banana<00:00:05.540> guard<00:00:06.230> from<00:00:07.069> adventure<00:00:07.730> time<00:00:07.970> out<00:00:08.540> of

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:08.809 
banana guard from adventure time out of

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:15.160 
banana guard from adventure time out of
Legos<00:00:09.880> you'll<00:00:10.880> need<00:00:11.090> a<00:00:11.120> saw<00:00:12.040> and<00:00:13.750> maybe<00:00:14.750> a<00:00:14.870> pair

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
Legos you'll need a saw and maybe a pair

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:23.290 
Legos you'll need a saw and maybe a pair
of<00:00:15.200> cutting<00:00:16.040> pliers<00:00:16.400> and

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.170 

it's<00:00:24.020> good<00:00:24.170> to<00:00:24.289> have<00:00:24.380> a<00:00:24.440> small<00:00:24.770> file<00:00:25.180> for

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:26.180 
it's good to have a small file for

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.730 
it's good to have a small file for
shaping<00:00:26.600> the<00:00:26.750> pieces

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.010 

and<00:00:31.189> finally<00:00:31.520> you'll<00:00:31.670> need<00:00:31.820> some<00:00:32.029> putty<00:00:32.689> in<00:00:32.870> it

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:33.020 
and finally you'll need some putty in it

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.160 
and finally you'll need some putty in it
that<00:00:33.230> will<00:00:33.440> harden<00:00:34.300> like<00:00:35.300> mighty<00:00:35.660> putty<00:00:36.020> or

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.170 
that will harden like mighty putty or

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:39.280 
that will harden like mighty putty or
something<00:00:36.820> so<00:00:37.820> I<00:00:37.850> start<00:00:38.210> with<00:00:38.390> these<00:00:38.600> octagon

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
something so I start with these octagon

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.000 
something so I start with these octagon
pieces<00:00:39.920> which<00:00:40.430> I<00:00:40.579> think<00:00:40.790> came<00:00:40.970> from<00:00:41.270> a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:42.010 
pieces which I think came from a

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.580 
pieces which I think came from a
aquanauts<00:00:43.010> set<00:00:43.790> but<00:00:44.270> if<00:00:44.480> you<00:00:44.540> don't<00:00:45.379> have

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
aquanauts set but if you don't have

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.160 
aquanauts set but if you don't have
these<00:00:45.770> you<00:00:45.829> can<00:00:46.250> find<00:00:46.489> them<00:00:46.640> on<00:00:46.790> eBay<00:00:47.239> or<00:00:47.930> the

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
these you can find them on eBay or the

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:52.770 
these you can find them on eBay or the
pick<00:00:48.379> a<00:00:48.410> brick<00:00:48.820> website<00:00:49.820> and<00:00:51.309> notice<00:00:52.309> that

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:52.780 
pick a brick website and notice that

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.540 
pick a brick website and notice that
four<00:00:53.780> of<00:00:53.809> the<00:00:54.019> sides<00:00:54.199> have<00:00:54.620> these<00:00:54.830> supports

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
four of the sides have these supports

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.750 
four of the sides have these supports
and<00:00:55.820> for<00:00:56.750> the<00:00:56.900> sides<00:00:57.140> have<00:00:57.440> this<00:00:57.680> empty<00:00:58.430> spaces

00:00:58.750 --> 00:00:58.760 
and for the sides have this empty spaces

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.569 
and for the sides have this empty spaces
it's<00:00:59.660> very<00:01:00.110> important<00:01:00.650> because<00:01:01.190> you're<00:01:01.489> going

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
it's very important because you're going

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.600 
it's very important because you're going
to<00:01:01.640> want<00:01:01.730> to<00:01:01.940> put<00:01:02.120> the<00:01:02.239> arms<00:01:02.900> on<00:01:03.140> the<00:01:03.170> sides

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:03.610 
to want to put the arms on the sides

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:06.160 
to want to put the arms on the sides
that<00:01:04.610> have<00:01:04.850> the<00:01:05.000> empty<00:01:05.269> spaces<00:01:05.659> in<00:01:05.990> there

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:06.170 
that have the empty spaces in there

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.080 
that have the empty spaces in there
because<00:01:06.409> you<00:01:06.560> have<00:01:06.650> to<00:01:06.740> make<00:01:06.890> a<00:01:06.920> hole<00:01:07.280> in<00:01:07.310> that

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:08.090 
because you have to make a hole in that

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:15.010 
because you have to make a hole in that
side<00:01:09.280> and<00:01:10.280> I<00:01:10.369> do<00:01:10.430> that<00:01:10.760> with<00:01:10.970> a<00:01:11.000> drill<00:01:11.450> I<00:01:14.020> find

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:15.020 
side and I do that with a drill I find

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:20.050 
side and I do that with a drill I find
that<00:01:15.200> a<00:01:15.820> 5/32<00:01:16.850> size<00:01:17.510> if<00:01:17.750> it<00:01:18.280> works<00:01:19.280> well<00:01:19.549> for

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:20.060 
that a 5/32 size if it works well for

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.940 
that a 5/32 size if it works well for
making<00:01:20.630> arm<00:01:21.439> holes<00:01:22.360> so<00:01:23.360> again<00:01:23.689> I<00:01:23.770> make<00:01:24.770> sure

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:24.950 
making arm holes so again I make sure

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.950 
making arm holes so again I make sure
I'm<00:01:25.130> lined<00:01:25.610> up<00:01:25.820> on<00:01:25.970> the<00:01:26.000> sides<00:01:26.330> that<00:01:26.659> have<00:01:26.689> the

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
I'm lined up on the sides that have the

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.960 
I'm lined up on the sides that have the
spaces<00:01:27.260> and<00:01:28.299> mark<00:01:29.979> the<00:01:30.979> height<00:01:31.280> that<00:01:31.549> I<00:01:31.700> want

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:31.970 
spaces and mark the height that I want

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:40.620 
spaces and mark the height that I want
the<00:01:32.210> arms<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.110> be

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:50.930 

then<00:01:41.470> I<00:01:41.500> draw<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.340> holes

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:50.940 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.480 

the<00:01:51.940> arms<00:01:52.479> are<00:01:52.570> too<00:01:52.780> tight<00:01:53.050> you<00:01:53.380> can<00:01:53.620> go<00:01:54.280> to<00:01:54.340> a

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490 
the arms are too tight you can go to a

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.180 
the arms are too tight you can go to a
slightly<00:01:54.880> larger<00:01:55.300> bit<00:01:55.750> where<00:01:56.530> you<00:01:56.710> can<00:01:56.920> just

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:57.190 
slightly larger bit where you can just

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.450 
slightly larger bit where you can just
put<00:01:57.400> the<00:01:57.490> drill<00:01:57.760> in<00:01:58.000> there<00:01:58.330> and<00:01:59.250> wiggle<00:02:00.250> it

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:00.460 
put the drill in there and wiggle it

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.120 
put the drill in there and wiggle it
around<00:02:00.550> to<00:02:01.090> make<00:02:01.270> sure<00:02:01.780> they<00:02:02.380> fit<00:02:02.800> you<00:02:02.979> want

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
around to make sure they fit you want

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.219 
around to make sure they fit you want
the<00:02:03.220> arms<00:02:03.490> to<00:02:03.640> be<00:02:03.760> tight<00:02:04.150> enough<00:02:04.479> to<00:02:04.690> stay<00:02:04.990> in

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
the arms to be tight enough to stay in

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:11.420 
the arms to be tight enough to stay in
the<00:02:06.509> holes

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.580 

loosen<00:02:12.180> up<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.480> know<00:02:12.540> so<00:02:12.959> that<00:02:13.110> they<00:02:13.230> can<00:02:13.379> move

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
loosen up you know so that they can move

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:17.050 
loosen up you know so that they can move
and<00:02:14.549> then<00:02:14.819> I<00:02:14.849> put<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.360> cone<00:02:15.659> on<00:02:16.019> from<00:02:16.590> the<00:02:16.680> head

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
and then I put the cone on from the head

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.259 
and then I put the cone on from the head
now<00:02:18.110> banana<00:02:19.110> guards<00:02:19.879> heads<00:02:20.879> aren't<00:02:21.180> that

00:02:21.259 --> 00:02:21.269 
now banana guards heads aren't that

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:23.990 
now banana guards heads aren't that
pointy<00:02:21.920> so<00:02:22.920> I'm<00:02:23.010> going<00:02:23.159> to<00:02:23.220> have<00:02:23.310> to<00:02:23.459> cut<00:02:23.849> the

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
pointy so I'm going to have to cut the

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.050 
pointy so I'm going to have to cut the
top<00:02:24.209> off<00:02:24.360> of<00:02:24.420> that<00:02:24.689> come<00:02:25.159> if<00:02:26.159> I<00:02:26.280> mark<00:02:26.579> on<00:02:26.819> there

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:27.060 
top off of that come if I mark on there

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.539 
top off of that come if I mark on there
the<00:02:27.269> height<00:02:27.450> that<00:02:27.599> I<00:02:27.689> want<00:02:27.989> and<00:02:28.230> then<00:02:29.159> I<00:02:29.280> use<00:02:29.519> my

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
the height that I want and then I use my

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:34.940 
the height that I want and then I use my
saw

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:34.950 

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:50.180 

and<00:02:35.700> just<00:02:36.390> cut<00:02:36.720> it<00:02:36.840> off

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.120 

and<00:02:50.730> I'll<00:02:51.090> just<00:02:51.300> finish<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.690> off<00:02:51.900> with<00:02:52.200> a<00:02:52.260> pair

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
and I'll just finish it off with a pair

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.400 
and I'll just finish it off with a pair
of<00:02:53.190> pliers

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.600 

okay<00:02:56.070> then<00:02:57.030> I<00:02:57.090> take<00:02:57.330> some<00:02:57.360> putty<00:02:57.980> this<00:02:58.980> is<00:02:59.220> a

00:02:59.600 --> 00:02:59.610 
okay then I take some putty this is a

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.670 
okay then I take some putty this is a
wood<00:02:59.940> putty<00:03:00.180> it<00:03:00.480> dries<00:03:01.080> very<00:03:01.200> hard<00:03:03.530> and<00:03:04.530> it

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
wood putty it dries very hard and it

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.910 
wood putty it dries very hard and it
dries<00:03:04.920> quickly<00:03:05.240> once<00:03:06.240> you<00:03:06.420> mix<00:03:06.630> it<00:03:06.810> up<00:03:06.960> to

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
dries quickly once you mix it up to

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.690 
dries quickly once you mix it up to
activate<00:03:08.460> it<00:03:09.470> so<00:03:10.470> I<00:03:10.560> mix<00:03:10.830> it<00:03:10.950> together<00:03:11.280> into<00:03:11.520> a
