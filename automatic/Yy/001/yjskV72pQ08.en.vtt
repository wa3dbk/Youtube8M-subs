00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:49.670 
and you know and that was a pretty

and you know and that was a pretty
strange<00:00:50.090> deal<00:00:50.420> right<00:00:50.629> there<00:00:50.660> I<00:00:50.870> mean<00:00:51.079> they

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:51.199 
strange deal right there I mean they

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.450 
strange deal right there I mean they
basically<00:00:51.469> there<00:00:52.039> was<00:00:52.160> a<00:00:52.510> homeowner's

basically there was a homeowner's
association<00:00:55.460> that<00:00:56.390> was<00:00:56.660> just<00:00:57.100> absolutely<00:00:58.100> out

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:58.340 
association that was just absolutely out

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.069 
association that was just absolutely out
of<00:00:58.370> control<00:00:58.519> they<00:00:59.120> this<00:00:59.809> particular

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
of control they this particular

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:02.529 
of control they this particular
greenhouse<00:01:00.800> was<00:01:01.039> one<00:01:01.519> of<00:01:01.640> the<00:01:01.730> nicest<00:01:01.760> ones<00:01:02.390> we

00:01:02.529 --> 00:01:02.539 
greenhouse was one of the nicest ones we

00:01:02.539 --> 00:01:06.010 
greenhouse was one of the nicest ones we
have<00:01:02.719> I<00:01:03.610> mean<00:01:04.610> a<00:01:04.640> really<00:01:05.089> nice<00:01:05.330> screen<00:01:05.810> house

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.020

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:08.680 
have I mean a really nice screen house
i'm<00:01:06.560> thinking<00:01:06.979> maybe<00:01:07.160> ten<00:01:07.850> fifteen<00:01:08.210> thousand

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:08.690 
i'm thinking maybe ten fifteen thousand

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.730 
i'm thinking maybe ten fifteen thousand
bucks<00:01:08.869> and<00:01:10.630> you<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.200> wasn't<00:01:12.380> good<00:01:12.710> enough

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
bucks and you know it wasn't good enough

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.760 
bucks and you know it wasn't good enough
for<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:13.610> neighborhood<00:01:13.940> so<00:01:14.570> I<00:01:14.960> mean<00:01:15.440> if<00:01:15.619> you<00:01:15.740> if

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
for the neighborhood so I mean if you if

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.919 
for the neighborhood so I mean if you if
you're<00:01:16.190> in<00:01:16.280> that<00:01:16.340> sort<00:01:16.700> of<00:01:16.759> a<00:01:16.929> neighborhood

00:01:17.919 --> 00:01:17.929 
you're in that sort of a neighborhood

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:20.260 
you're in that sort of a neighborhood
you<00:01:18.200> probably<00:01:18.560> already<00:01:18.770> know<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:20.000> need<00:01:20.149> to

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:20.270 
you probably already know you need to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.730 
you probably already know you need to
check<00:01:20.479> before<00:01:20.840> you<00:01:20.869> do<00:01:21.050> anything<00:01:21.259> if<00:01:21.560> they've

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
check before you do anything if they've

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:23.740 
check before you do anything if they've
been<00:01:21.890> out<00:01:22.039> you<00:01:22.640> know<00:01:22.759> measuring<00:01:23.060> your<00:01:23.420> grass

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:23.750 
been out you know measuring your grass

00:01:25.839 --> 00:01:25.849 
to see how tall it is you know you

00:01:25.849 --> 00:01:28.330 
to see how tall it is you know you
definitely<00:01:26.179> check<00:01:26.750> with<00:01:27.020> your<00:01:27.229> your<00:01:27.920> local

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
definitely check with your your local

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.300

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310 
not only your local city but you know if

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:33.940 
not only your local city but you know if

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950 
you're in a homeowner's association in

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.309 
you're in a homeowner's association in
most<00:01:34.310> cases<00:01:34.610> though<00:01:35.030> because<00:01:35.660> a<00:01:35.869> greenhouse

00:01:36.309 --> 00:01:36.319 
most cases though because a greenhouse

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:38.910 
most cases though because a greenhouse
is<00:01:36.619> not<00:01:37.190> treated<00:01:37.640> as<00:01:37.700> a<00:01:37.819> permanent<00:01:38.060> structure

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
is not treated as a permanent structure

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:41.469 
is not treated as a permanent structure
unless<00:01:39.920> you've<00:01:40.130> poured<00:01:40.429> a<00:01:40.489> foundation<00:01:41.119> for<00:01:41.149> it

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
unless you've poured a foundation for it

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.260 
unless you've poured a foundation for it
you<00:01:42.259> could<00:01:42.590> you<00:01:43.039> know<00:01:43.160> will<00:01:43.369> get<00:01:44.030> three<00:01:44.209> or

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
you could you know will get three or

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.300 
you could you know will get three or
four<00:01:44.479> people<00:01:44.599> pick<00:01:45.289> it<00:01:45.410> up<00:01:45.560> and<00:01:45.770> move<00:01:45.830> it<00:01:46.250> to

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
four people pick it up and move it to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.910 
four people pick it up and move it to
another<00:01:46.459> part<00:01:47.390> of<00:01:47.479> your<00:01:47.660> yard<00:01:47.989> so<00:01:48.560> it's<00:01:48.739> not

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:48.920 
another part of your yard so it's not

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:51.370 
another part of your yard so it's not
permanent<00:01:49.310> and<00:01:49.789> since<00:01:50.690> it's<00:01:50.869> not<00:01:51.020> a<00:01:51.080> permanent

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
permanent and since it's not a permanent

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.270 
permanent and since it's not a permanent
structure<00:01:51.830> in<00:01:52.190> almost<00:01:53.149> every<00:01:53.539> case<00:01:53.750> you<00:01:54.280> does

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280 
structure in almost every case you does

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.580 
structure in almost every case you does
not<00:01:55.520> require<00:01:55.940> a<00:01:56.060> permit<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.780> some

00:01:57.580 --> 00:01:57.590 
not require a permit and some

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:59.529 
not require a permit and some
greenhouses<00:01:58.039> you<00:01:58.340> can<00:01:58.520> easily<00:01:58.670> take<00:01:59.030> down<00:01:59.090> not

00:01:59.529 --> 00:01:59.539 
greenhouses you can easily take down not

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.809 
greenhouses you can easily take down not
just<00:01:59.780> the<00:01:59.989> you<00:02:00.500> know<00:02:00.530> the<00:02:00.800> pop-up<00:02:01.250> portable

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
just the you know the pop-up portable

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.609 
just the you know the pop-up portable
ones<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.239> you<00:02:02.750> know<00:02:02.840> it<00:02:03.110> doesn't<00:02:03.440> take<00:02:03.470> a

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:03.619 
ones but you know it doesn't take a

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:05.290 
ones but you know it doesn't take a
whole<00:02:03.890> lot<00:02:03.950> to<00:02:04.399> take<00:02:04.610> it<00:02:04.759> down<00:02:04.879> even<00:02:05.090> in

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:05.300 
whole lot to take it down even in

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.169 
whole lot to take it down even in
sections<00:02:05.840> so<00:02:06.470> if<00:02:06.649> you<00:02:06.770> can<00:02:06.979> take<00:02:07.429> it<00:02:07.610> down<00:02:07.640> for

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
sections so if you can take it down for

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.770 
sections so if you can take it down for
a<00:02:08.209> season<00:02:08.750> or<00:02:08.959> for<00:02:09.530> winter<00:02:10.129> for<00:02:10.520> example<00:02:11.000> then

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
a season or for winter for example then

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.070 
a season or for winter for example then
you<00:02:12.620> know<00:02:12.770> you<00:02:12.860> really<00:02:13.370> can<00:02:14.000> say<00:02:14.209> hey<00:02:14.390> this

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
you know you really can say hey this

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.100 
you know you really can say hey this
doesn't<00:02:15.379> you<00:02:15.770> know
