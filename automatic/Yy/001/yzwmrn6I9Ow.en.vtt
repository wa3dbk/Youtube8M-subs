choice this year ob crawl and drag race
I<00:00:23.170> had<00:00:23.590> set<00:00:23.800> the<00:00:23.890> record<00:00:24.070> on<00:00:24.310> drag<00:00:24.490> race<00:00:24.520> two

I had set the record on drag race two

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:26.540 
I had set the record on drag race two
years<00:00:25.060> ago<00:00:25.240> with<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.420> four<00:00:25.660> point<00:00:25.900> one<00:00:26.080> and

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
years ago with a four point one and

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.590 
years ago with a four point one and
Robert<00:00:27.550> Murch<00:00:27.670> AK<00:00:27.880> had<00:00:28.090> I<00:00:28.270> thought<00:00:28.510> the

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:28.600 
Robert Murch AK had I thought the

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:29.849 
Robert Murch AK had I thought the
gauntlet<00:00:28.930> of<00:00:28.990> trying<00:00:29.230> to<00:00:29.289> get<00:00:29.410> either<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.590> four

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859 
gauntlet of trying to get either a four

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.320 
gauntlet of trying to get either a four
point<00:00:30.100> zero<00:00:30.160> or<00:00:30.550> a<00:00:30.580> three<00:00:30.760> point<00:00:30.970> nine<00:00:31.029> if<00:00:31.210> it

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:31.330 
point zero or a three point nine if it

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:33.450 
point zero or a three point nine if it
was<00:00:31.420> possible<00:00:31.630> so<00:00:32.140> far<00:00:32.830> this<00:00:32.949> year<00:00:33.160> I<00:00:33.190> have<00:00:33.280> not

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:33.460 
was possible so far this year I have not

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:34.890 
was possible so far this year I have not
really<00:00:33.670> attained<00:00:33.970> that<00:00:34.120> yet<00:00:34.330> but<00:00:34.540> I<00:00:34.570> think

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:34.900 
really attained that yet but I think

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.900 
really attained that yet but I think
there<00:00:35.470> is<00:00:35.500> a<00:00:35.620> finite<00:00:35.920> margin<00:00:36.400> that<00:00:36.519> it<00:00:36.640> could

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:36.910 
there is a finite margin that it could

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.610 
there is a finite margin that it could
be<00:00:37.030> done<00:00:37.210> well<00:00:37.510> and<00:00:37.690> then<00:00:37.780> crawl<00:00:37.989> on<00:00:38.110> your<00:00:38.229> hand

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
be done well and then crawl on your hand

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.140 
be done well and then crawl on your hand
well<00:00:38.800> it's<00:00:39.220> just<00:00:39.339> a<00:00:39.489> point<00:00:39.699> of<00:00:39.790> getting<00:00:39.879> the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
well it's just a point of getting the

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.420 
well it's just a point of getting the
controls<00:00:40.510> befitting<00:00:40.900> right<00:00:41.170> and<00:00:41.379> then<00:00:41.739> you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
controls befitting right and then you

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:43.860 
controls befitting right and then you
know<00:00:42.489> extrapolating<00:00:43.239> on<00:00:43.360> your<00:00:43.479> game<00:00:43.629> playing

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:43.870 
know extrapolating on your game playing

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.899 
know extrapolating on your game playing
so<00:00:44.710> you've<00:00:44.860> noticed<00:00:45.010> that<00:00:45.280> on<00:00:45.370> some<00:00:45.729> of<00:00:45.820> the

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:45.909 
so you've noticed that on some of the

00:00:45.909 --> 00:00:47.310 
so you've noticed that on some of the
games<00:00:46.089> around<00:00:46.420> here<00:00:46.540> maybe<00:00:46.930> some<00:00:47.170> of<00:00:47.229> the

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:47.320 
games around here maybe some of the

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:48.539 
games around here maybe some of the
controls<00:00:47.680> are<00:00:47.830> not<00:00:47.979> used<00:00:48.190> to<00:00:48.309> what<00:00:48.430> you're

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:48.549 
controls are not used to what you're

00:00:48.549 --> 00:00:50.910 
controls are not used to what you're
normally<00:00:48.699> used<00:00:49.330> to<00:00:49.540> well<00:00:50.199> there's<00:00:50.620> a<00:00:50.680> lot<00:00:50.830> of

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920 
normally used to well there's a lot of

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.960 
normally used to well there's a lot of
wear<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:51.070> tear<00:00:51.280> you<00:00:51.339> have<00:00:51.580> hundreds<00:00:51.909> of

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:51.970 
wear and tear you have hundreds of

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.240 
wear and tear you have hundreds of
people<00:00:52.089> here<00:00:52.390> now<00:00:52.570> competing<00:00:53.080> and

people here now competing and
everybody's<00:00:54.250> technique<00:00:54.549> is<00:00:54.670> different<00:00:55.000> and

00:00:55.229 --> 00:00:55.239 
everybody's technique is different and

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:57.780 
everybody's technique is different and
of<00:00:55.360> course<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:56.199> know<00:00:56.320> the<00:00:56.559> fun<00:00:57.339> spot<00:00:57.580> people

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
you know that only goes so far when you

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:02.969 
you know that only goes so far when you
have<00:01:01.570> like<00:01:01.780> I<00:01:01.839> say<00:01:01.960> multiple<00:01:02.589> multiple<00:01:02.830> times

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:02.979 
have like I say multiple multiple times

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:04.410 
have like I say multiple multiple times
of<00:01:03.400> playing<00:01:03.610> the<00:01:03.760> game<00:01:03.909> it's<00:01:04.089> going<00:01:04.180> to<00:01:04.269> wear

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
of playing the game it's going to wear

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.009 
of playing the game it's going to wear
out<00:01:04.449> sooner<00:01:04.750> or<00:01:04.780> later

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:05.019 
out sooner or later

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:06.450 
out sooner or later
now<00:01:05.530> you<00:01:05.590> mentioned<00:01:05.920> a<00:01:05.950> lot<00:01:06.070> of<00:01:06.159> people<00:01:06.369> that

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
now you mentioned a lot of people that

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.399 
now you mentioned a lot of people that
are<00:01:06.549> here<00:01:06.760> this<00:01:07.060> seems<00:01:07.450> to<00:01:07.600> be<00:01:07.690> a<00:01:07.720> much<00:01:08.049> larger

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:08.409 
are here this seems to be a much larger

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:10.349 
are here this seems to be a much larger
turnout<00:01:08.860> than<00:01:09.159> last<00:01:09.369> year<00:01:09.670> maybe<00:01:09.880> previous

00:01:10.349 --> 00:01:10.359 
turnout than last year maybe previous

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:12.779 
turnout than last year maybe previous
years<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:11.740> you<00:01:11.799> what<00:01:12.280> do<00:01:12.340> you<00:01:12.399> think<00:01:12.460> might<00:01:12.670> be

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
years do you what do you think might be

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.219 
years do you what do you think might be
attributed<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.270> that<00:01:13.359> do<00:01:13.689> you<00:01:13.750> think<00:01:14.020> that<00:01:14.140> the

00:01:14.219 --> 00:01:14.229 
attributed to that do you think that the

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:16.050 
attributed to that do you think that the
popularity<00:01:14.829> of<00:01:15.039> retro<00:01:15.310> gaming<00:01:15.490> is<00:01:15.700> increased

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
popularity of retro gaming is increased

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:17.730 
popularity of retro gaming is increased
or<00:01:16.329> do<00:01:16.750> you<00:01:16.810> think<00:01:16.930> maybe<00:01:17.079> the<00:01:17.229> king<00:01:17.409> of<00:01:17.530> Kong<00:01:17.710> a

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
or do you think maybe the king of Kong a

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.590 
or do you think maybe the king of Kong a
very<00:01:18.340> popular<00:01:18.729> film<00:01:18.939> from<00:01:19.090> last<00:01:19.119> year<00:01:19.509> had

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:19.600 
very popular film from last year had

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.300 
very popular film from last year had
something<00:01:19.869> to<00:01:19.930> do<00:01:20.049> with<00:01:20.140> the<00:01:20.289> influx<00:01:20.619> I<00:01:20.920> think

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:21.310 
something to do with the influx I think

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:23.279 
something to do with the influx I think
it's<00:01:21.429> all<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.729> above<00:01:22.149> with<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.780> airing<00:01:23.200> of

00:01:23.279 --> 00:01:23.289 
it's all the above with the airing of

00:01:23.289 --> 00:01:25.020 
it's all the above with the airing of
the<00:01:23.380> king<00:01:23.530> of<00:01:23.590> Kong<00:01:23.799> promoting<00:01:24.520> the<00:01:24.640> fun<00:01:24.789> spot

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:25.030 
the king of Kong promoting the fun spot
