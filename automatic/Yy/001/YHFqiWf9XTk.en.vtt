every<00:00:13.139> year<00:00:13.320> when<00:00:13.440> we<00:00:13.500> go<00:00:13.679> into<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:14.009> winter

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:14.219 
every year when we go into the winter

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:15.919 
every year when we go into the winter
months<00:00:14.670> obviously<00:00:15.030> more<00:00:15.570> people<00:00:15.630> are

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
months obviously more people are

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.330 
months obviously more people are
becoming<00:00:16.139> concerned<00:00:16.529> about<00:00:16.830> insulating

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
becoming concerned about insulating

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.650 
becoming concerned about insulating
underneath<00:00:17.699> their<00:00:17.850> floors<00:00:18.119> the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
underneath their floors the

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.660 
underneath their floors the
bone-chilling<00:00:19.230> cold<00:00:19.920> temperature<00:00:20.520> on<00:00:20.640> that

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
bone-chilling cold temperature on that

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.490 
bone-chilling cold temperature on that
floor<00:00:21.090> there<00:00:21.600> in<00:00:21.689> summertime<00:00:22.080> we<00:00:22.260> think<00:00:22.410> about

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
floor there in summertime we think about

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.200 
floor there in summertime we think about
our<00:00:22.710> attics<00:00:23.070> but<00:00:23.279> during<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.519> wintertime<00:00:23.789> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
our attics but during the wintertime I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.390 
our attics but during the wintertime I
would<00:00:24.810> say<00:00:24.960> maybe<00:00:25.170> 75%<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.859> our<00:00:26.010> calls<00:00:26.189> are

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
would say maybe 75% of our calls are

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.740 
would say maybe 75% of our calls are
just<00:00:26.699> about<00:00:26.880> doing<00:00:27.090> underneath<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:27.510> floor

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
just about doing underneath the floor

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.279 
just about doing underneath the floor
what<00:00:28.500> we<00:00:28.619> run<00:00:28.800> into<00:00:29.189> the<00:00:29.429> most<00:00:29.699> however<00:00:29.970> is<00:00:30.510> a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
what we run into the most however is a

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.110 
what we run into the most however is a
major<00:00:31.949> problem<00:00:32.309> if<00:00:32.579> it's<00:00:32.790> not<00:00:32.850> addressed

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
major problem if it's not addressed

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.940 
major problem if it's not addressed
properly<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:34.020> that<00:00:34.350> is<00:00:34.790> if<00:00:35.790> you<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.390> a

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:36.950 
properly and that is if you have a

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.170 
properly and that is if you have a
fiberglass<00:00:37.950> padding<00:00:38.430> underneath<00:00:38.760> you<00:00:38.940> floor

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
fiberglass padding underneath you floor

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.819 
fiberglass padding underneath you floor
you<00:00:39.390> probably<00:00:39.690> already<00:00:39.870> know<00:00:40.230> it's<00:00:40.440> not<00:00:40.559> doing

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
you probably already know it's not doing

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.790 
you probably already know it's not doing
much<00:00:40.920> for<00:00:40.980> you<00:00:41.309> but<00:00:42.290> if<00:00:43.290> you<00:00:43.469> do<00:00:43.649> have

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
much for you but if you do have

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.959 
much for you but if you do have
fiberglass<00:00:44.250> underneath<00:00:44.610> your<00:00:44.730> floor

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
fiberglass underneath your floor

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.880 
fiberglass underneath your floor
obviously<00:00:45.510> we<00:00:45.870> need<00:00:46.020> to<00:00:46.110> remove<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> before

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
obviously we need to remove that before

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.170 
obviously we need to remove that before
we<00:00:46.980> go<00:00:47.100> ahead<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.460> spray<00:00:47.640> it<00:00:47.789> closed<00:00:47.969> cell

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
we go ahead and spray it closed cell

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.029 
we go ahead and spray it closed cell
foam<00:00:48.210> to<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.780> now<00:00:49.200> here's<00:00:49.410> usually<00:00:49.770> with<00:00:49.890> that

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
foam to it now here's usually with that

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.060 
foam to it now here's usually with that
is<00:00:50.960> one<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.079> the<00:00:52.170> aspects<00:00:52.710> when<00:00:52.980> the

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
is one of the aspects when the

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.799 
is one of the aspects when the
characteristics<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.850> makes<00:00:54.270> fiberglass

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
characteristics that makes fiberglass

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.590 
characteristics that makes fiberglass
not<00:00:55.050> a<00:00:55.110> good<00:00:55.350> product<00:00:55.800> is<00:00:56.010> that<00:00:56.460> it<00:00:56.610> holds

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
not a good product is that it holds

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.389 
not a good product is that it holds
moisture<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:58.320> holds<00:00:58.649> a<00:00:58.710> lot<00:00:58.920> of<00:00:58.949> moisture<00:00:59.160> this

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
moisture it holds a lot of moisture this

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.040 
moisture it holds a lot of moisture this
is<00:00:59.489> a<00:00:59.520> sponge<00:00:59.850> for<00:01:00.090> wetness<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.480> moisture<00:01:00.870> and

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
is a sponge for wetness and moisture and

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.529 
is a sponge for wetness and moisture and
the<00:01:01.559> closer<00:01:01.829> you<00:01:02.039> are<00:01:02.190> to<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.760> ground<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
the closer you are to the ground the

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
the closer you are to the ground the
closer<00:01:03.780> you<00:01:04.019> are<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.229> higher<00:01:04.680> vapor<00:01:05.100> pressure

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
closer you are to higher vapor pressure

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.830 
closer you are to higher vapor pressure
and<00:01:05.820> more<00:01:06.030> moisture<00:01:07.310> also<00:01:08.310> if<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> have<00:01:09.000> a<00:01:09.030> lot

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
and more moisture also if you have a lot

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.420 
and more moisture also if you have a lot
of<00:01:09.960> people<00:01:10.229> and<00:01:10.500> a<00:01:10.560> lot<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.710> organizations

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
of people and a lot of organizations

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.240 
of people and a lot of organizations
recommend<00:01:11.850> a<00:01:12.210> craft<00:01:12.990> paper<00:01:13.350> backing<00:01:13.799> to<00:01:14.220> it

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
recommend a craft paper backing to it

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.420 
recommend a craft paper backing to it
the<00:01:15.240> paper<00:01:15.750> backing<00:01:16.080> facing<00:01:16.770> downwards<00:01:17.250> when

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
the paper backing facing downwards when

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:18.980 
the paper backing facing downwards when
you<00:01:17.520> look<00:01:17.700> on<00:01:17.850> at<00:01:18.060> your<00:01:18.210> fiberglass<00:01:18.570> band<00:01:18.810> you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
you look on at your fiberglass band you

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.230 
you look on at your fiberglass band you
see<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.530> would<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:19.920> a<00:01:19.950> paper<00:01:20.400> backing<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
see it would be a paper backing to it

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.149 
see it would be a paper backing to it
paper<00:01:21.689> surface<00:01:22.170> that<00:01:22.350> is<00:01:22.470> acting<00:01:22.770> as<00:01:22.890> a<00:01:22.920> vapor

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
paper surface that is acting as a vapor

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.240 
paper surface that is acting as a vapor
retarder<00:01:23.869> that<00:01:24.869> is<00:01:25.200> supposed<00:01:25.650> to<00:01:25.710> retard<00:01:26.100> the

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
retarder that is supposed to retard the

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.130 
retarder that is supposed to retard the
air<00:01:26.490> the<00:01:26.729> more<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.150> flow<00:01:27.360> of<00:01:27.479> moisture<00:01:27.689> coming

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
air the more the flow of moisture coming

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
air the more the flow of moisture coming
into<00:01:28.320> your<00:01:29.040> floorboards<00:01:29.729> and<00:01:29.880> into<00:01:30.090> the<00:01:30.180> house

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
into your floorboards and into the house

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.910 
into your floorboards and into the house
but<00:01:30.659> the<00:01:30.780> problem<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.200> once<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.590> in<00:01:31.740> there

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
but the problem is once it's in there

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.800 
but the problem is once it's in there
it's<00:01:32.729> really<00:01:33.060> not<00:01:33.180> coming<00:01:33.479> out<00:01:33.540> in<00:01:33.659> either

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
it's really not coming out in either

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.569 
it's really not coming out in either
something<00:01:34.259> from<00:01:34.380> coming<00:01:34.650> out<00:01:34.740> so<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.369> a<00:01:35.400> lot

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
something from coming out so that a lot

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.219 
something from coming out so that a lot
of<00:01:35.610> houses<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.119> we're<00:01:36.390> approaching<00:01:36.780> right

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
of houses that we're approaching right

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:39.950 
of houses that we're approaching right
now<00:01:37.729> when<00:01:38.729> we<00:01:38.909> remove<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.659> fiberglass

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
now when we remove the fiberglass

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.760 
now when we remove the fiberglass
batting<00:01:40.290> we<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.890> very<00:01:41.790> wet<00:01:42.390> wet<00:01:42.770> floorboards

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
batting we see very wet wet floorboards

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.200 
batting we see very wet wet floorboards
a<00:01:43.920> subflooring<00:01:44.549> or<00:01:44.790> if<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:44.909> have<00:01:45.060> no

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
actually being wet a lot of times we've

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.660 
actually being wet a lot of times we've
seen<00:01:49.470> a<00:01:49.500> run<00:01:49.860> into<00:01:50.040> a<00:01:50.100> lot<00:01:50.220> of<00:01:50.250> houses<00:01:50.430> actually

seen a run into a lot of houses actually

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:53.469 
seen a run into a lot of houses actually

with the closed cell phone my experience
has<00:02:13.610> been<00:02:13.640> most<00:02:13.910> companies<00:02:14.240> they<00:02:14.840> just<00:02:14.870> tear

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
has been most companies they just tear

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.660

very strong vapor retarder and what

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.070 
very strong vapor retarder and what
happens<00:02:38.060> is<00:02:38.209> if<00:02:38.390> you<00:02:38.420> have<00:02:38.540> wetness

happens is if you have wetness

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.290 
happens is if you have wetness
underneath<00:02:39.470> your<00:02:39.620> floors<00:02:39.890> and<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.790> trap<00:02:41.120> that

underneath your floors and you trap that

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:43.330 
underneath your floors and you trap that
in<00:02:41.480> with<00:02:41.630> closed<00:02:41.870> cell<00:02:42.200> and<00:02:42.440> now<00:02:42.890> you<00:02:42.950> have

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
that case and where can the moisture go

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.070 
that case and where can the moisture go
it<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.850> sits<00:02:50.060> there<00:02:50.180> if<00:02:50.510> you<00:02:50.900> have<00:02:51.050> any
