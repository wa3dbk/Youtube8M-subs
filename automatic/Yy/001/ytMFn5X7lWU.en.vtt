00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.480
 good 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.550
 we found is the gps application 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.719
 car video recorder 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.620
 Speed Tracker Speedometer 

00:00:31.719 --> 00:00:38.410
 speed and path processor 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.620
 so an all in one for your car in 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.570
 the gps will be able to take photos and videos 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.649
 in your obvious car you have to have the 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:50.290
 iphone looking towards the road the 

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:54.070
 speedometer is this father put it in the 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.309
 good mirror on the board part what 

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:01.170
 sleeping and is quite father you 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:03.670
 reflects ' the is a hologram style album 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.470
 had speed that you go but 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.200
 it only works at night it also comes out 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.270
 you can put it on motorcycles if it has its 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.070
 small windshield the bike you can 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.530
 put I've been very very very for the 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.610
 100% recommended application we found 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.460
 a sonic all starz I liked this 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.350
 quite pretty father and what I 

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:26.530
 loved the game is that you can play it 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:29.740
 online is very well created very good 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.300
 graphics leverage download leverages 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.300
 so that is free today 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.130
 because he 's super super super father 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.770
 really liked the game 

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.660
 I'm not so much of the sonic saga but 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:41.980
 it is really amazing this game I 

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.490
 like a lot 

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.830
 we also find solids the literal 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:50.380
 you are going to play soccer with your carts like this 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:52.090
 you play football with your carts is 

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.070
 very well is very well created has 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 a lot of game options you can 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.090
 put in fact the multiplayer option 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.450
 there are eight that you see because you have the 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:04.000
 option of the challenges is very well created 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.640
 and obvious is more difficult or the fact that 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.240
 you have to control with your car 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:12.400
 the game the ball you have to go kicking 

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.190
 the ball with your car really very very 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.140
 very well created I liked it a lot 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:20.260
 we found a blow paper you can do 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.210
 different textures and so literal here 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.580
 they mark it as a work of art with your 

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.900
 fingers a doing 17 all sincere I wanted 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.200
 do this soft rock and it's done so 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:31.960
 least one rabbit and seems no no no no 

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.700
 rabbit they look like two balls there there what 

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:35.260
 obviously you will not be able to do this kind of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.750
 things not for example if you see here this is 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:40.600
 one face and everything they do as well as with the 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.670
 Leo style but you and I do it 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:45.640
 it's literally impossible 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:48.640
 we found ay of the rum this application 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.310
 have a lot of time in the app store 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.680
 I had the iphone 3g when it came out 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:56.680
 application when he was like that in his 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.280
 boom to call it somehow and this 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:03.300
 it made the photos in the dark with 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.340
 the iphone 3g 3gs that had no flash 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:08.170
 they came out very well or they are like 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.850
 you can see here the color balance 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.610
 you could clarify the most you could put 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.350
 a kind of flash was a boom not 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:15.570
 now the truth that has a lot 

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.150
 a lot of time that has not occupied 

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:21.550
 but no longer filters are added follow us 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.250
 adding the contrasts the colors 

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.230
 but the application has gone out of fashion 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.120
 I may have improved that I am sincere 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.130
 I have not downloaded it again until the day 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:33.130
 today so good we also find 

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:34.630
 a fly fight two wars come out 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.220
 you're just going to have to kill 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:38.180
 all the Martians that put themselves 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.459
 in front 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.829
 I got bored I'm honest I got bored 

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:44.629
 because because it becomes very repetitive 

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.069
 like they do not change the levels much 

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:48.769
 simply what you have to do is 

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.159
 kill kill kill kill kill and kill and 

00:03:48.769 --> 00:03:53.569
 finally we found someone 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.340
 you have two options the campaign option 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.379
 and the option of survival 

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:59.530
 I was playing the campaign and in 

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.099
 truth is quite addictive is 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:06.500
 rather like calling it difficult has 

00:04:04.099 --> 00:04:09.460
 really liked it really has 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.320
 liked the game very much 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.450
 lights because then many do not believe me 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.890
 not that sometimes he did not try the 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:16.840
 applications I know I do not have time to 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.670
 times to make videos like you 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:20.440
 they want me to download all the 

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:22.390
 applications that you try all the 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.060
 applications and hence bring them a 

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:27.010
 video bringing you not the best two 

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:29.230
 or three four applications but I am 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.640
 writer to the impossible mind for me is 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:33.190
 as always as I have always told you 

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.800
 I do not live as youtube 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:37.660
 fortunately I have an external job 

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:40.060
 of youtube and apart when it pays 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:42.070
 youtube would not tire me at all 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:44.290
 I could live with him what youtube gives you 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:45.970
 but good friends was good these have 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.380
 been the games and applications that we have 

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:49.150
 found now that is today and 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:54.470
 it is rather to see that if he was 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:57.710
 playing let me here put the reflector 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:05:00.009
 let me now open 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.669
 the control center 

00:05:00.009 --> 00:05:05.669
 the play 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.669
 iphone 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:10.760
 but I do not get duplication 

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.550
 they closed let's see again the play 

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:17.840
 this duplication 

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:21.240
 look here was playing this last 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:25.490

 have the buttons to jump and the 

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:34.650
 shooting takes me but it's really 

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:36.000
