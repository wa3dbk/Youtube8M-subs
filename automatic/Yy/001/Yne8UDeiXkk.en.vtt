00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
definitely like purchase this book it's

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.189 
definitely like purchase this book it's
very<00:01:02.789> much<00:01:03.000> like<00:01:03.030> Harry<00:01:03.420> Potter<00:01:03.660> Lord<00:01:04.049> of<00:01:04.140> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
very much like Harry Potter Lord of the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.219 
very much like Harry Potter Lord of the
Rings<00:01:04.409> that<00:01:04.680> kind<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:04.979> genre<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:06.030> course<00:01:06.360> it's

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
Rings that kind of genre of course it's

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.350 
Rings that kind of genre of course it's
more<00:01:07.590> related<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.040> Harry<00:01:08.490> Potter<00:01:08.820> because<00:01:09.210> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
more related to Harry Potter because it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
more related to Harry Potter because it
involves<00:01:10.049> magic<00:01:10.530> but<00:01:10.799> again<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.520> can't

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
involves magic but again it can't

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.090 
involves magic but again it can't
compare<00:01:12.299> because<00:01:12.570> Harry<00:01:12.930> Potter<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.439> magical

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
compare because Harry Potter is magical

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.940 
compare because Harry Potter is magical
in<00:01:14.250> its<00:01:14.369> own<00:01:14.610> way<00:01:14.960> and<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.680> very

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
in its own way and this is a very

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.590 
in its own way and this is a very
different<00:01:17.460> type<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.640> magic<00:01:18.060> it's<00:01:18.210> like<00:01:18.299> you're

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
different type of magic it's like you're

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.340 
different type of magic it's like you're
Harry<00:01:19.439> Houdini<00:01:19.950> classical<00:01:20.759> type<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:21.750> Madra<00:01:22.170> so

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
Harry Houdini classical type of Madra so

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.109 
Harry Houdini classical type of Madra so
it<00:01:22.890> was<00:01:23.040> very<00:01:23.280> interesting<00:01:23.490> to<00:01:23.700> read<00:01:23.939> because

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:24.119 
it was very interesting to read because

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.210 
it was very interesting to read because
I've<00:01:24.240> never<00:01:24.360> read<00:01:24.930> a<00:01:24.960> book<00:01:25.080> that<00:01:25.530> involves

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
I've never read a book that involves

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.590 
I've never read a book that involves
that<00:01:26.369> sort<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.700> magic<00:01:27.119> um<00:01:29.180> the<00:01:30.180> character

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that sort of magic um the character

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.899 
that sort of magic um the character
development<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.200> interesting<00:01:32.009> because<00:01:32.189> there

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
development is interesting because there

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.929 
development is interesting because there
are<00:01:33.119> several<00:01:33.509> main<00:01:33.840> characters<00:01:34.470> however<00:01:35.189> they

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:35.939 
are several main characters however they

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.670 
are several main characters however they
have<00:01:36.180> their<00:01:36.329> own<00:01:36.509> story<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.170> their<00:01:37.259> own<00:01:37.380> life

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
have their own story and their own life

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.560 
have their own story and their own life
of<00:01:37.920> course<00:01:38.250> many<00:01:38.579> novels<00:01:38.970> are<00:01:39.090> like<00:01:39.240> that<00:01:39.420> but

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
of course many novels are like that but

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.140 
of course many novels are like that but
you<00:01:39.689> don't<00:01:39.900> really<00:01:40.740> understand<00:01:41.340> how<00:01:41.460> they're

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
you don't really understand how they're

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.609 
you don't really understand how they're
connected<00:01:42.570> to<00:01:42.659> each<00:01:42.810> other<00:01:42.990> in<00:01:43.229> this<00:01:43.350> book

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
connected to each other in this book

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.819 
connected to each other in this book
until<00:01:44.100> maybe<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:44.729> middle<00:01:44.880> of<00:01:45.030> the<00:01:45.119> book<00:01:45.360> and<00:01:46.049> I

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:46.829 
until maybe the middle of the book and I

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.230 
until maybe the middle of the book and I
could<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> wrong<00:01:47.340> when<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.579> say<00:01:47.820> middle<00:01:48.090> of<00:01:48.180> the

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
could be wrong when I say middle of the

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.920 
could be wrong when I say middle of the
book<00:01:48.360> it<00:01:48.509> could<00:01:48.630> be<00:01:48.780> sooner<00:01:49.079> as<00:01:49.259> well<00:01:49.470> um<00:01:50.930> but

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
book it could be sooner as well um but
