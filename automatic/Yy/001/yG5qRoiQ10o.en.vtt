Hi everyone! Today we're doing a first video on Legion! The lastest event added by Square-Enix!

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Legion is a little like a Einherjar new generation, but instead of fight waves of enemy, we're fighting waves of 3 boss!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Since the event take lot of time, i'll do in this video only one important boss and not all boss we have to fight

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000
The boss we're fighting today is called Soaring Naraka, he's the last boss from the Hall of Im.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
It'll only appear at the 3rd waves. The boss is a Naraka, a kind of boss we fought a lot in Voidwatch

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.000
most of his ability are similar to the one Voidwatch Naraka had.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
You can check my video on voidwatch if you'd like to get more imformation about them

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The boss isn't really a lot more complicated than the Voidwatch one

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The real dificulty from Legion, it's more to kill a maximum number of boss in one run, which last 30 minutes, than to fight one boss really hard

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.000
One of the main thing to do with this boss is to stun his Yaksha Stance

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
Because when he's under Raksha Stance, his physical defence will be reduce to -50%

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and when he's under Yaksha Stance, his magical defence will be reduced to -50%

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
So under Raksha Stance, if we have a Party mostly made of Melee, he'll die faster

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:45.000
The other ability we have to stun are Raksha: Vengeance, like for the other Naraka it should give us the weakness effect

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And Yaksha: Oblivion, Also like the other Naraka, should reduce all the stats of people hit by this attacks

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
this is pretty much everything about this boss, i hope this you liked this first video of Legion!
