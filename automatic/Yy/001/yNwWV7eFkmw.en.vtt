opening closed you can use slip stitch

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.110 
opening closed you can use slip stitch
but<00:03:28.110> I've<00:03:28.260> used<00:03:28.560> ladder<00:03:28.770> stitch<00:03:29.190> where<00:03:30.000> you

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
but I've used ladder stitch where you

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.910 
but I've used ladder stitch where you
run<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.420> needle<00:03:30.630> through<00:03:31.020> one<00:03:31.260> folded<00:03:31.710> edge

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
run the needle through one folded edge

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.520 
run the needle through one folded edge
take<00:03:32.700> it<00:03:32.850> across<00:03:33.210> and<00:03:33.630> run<00:03:34.200> it<00:03:34.320> through<00:03:34.350> the

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:34.530 
take it across and run it through the

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.090 
take it across and run it through the
opposite<00:03:34.980> folded<00:03:35.490> edge<00:03:35.640> and<00:03:35.970> so<00:03:36.660> on<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.950> the

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
opposite folded edge and so on so the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.980 
opposite folded edge and so on so the
thread<00:03:38.340> lies<00:03:38.520> across<00:03:38.910> the<00:03:39.120> gap<00:03:39.300> like<00:03:39.570> rungs<00:03:39.780> on

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:39.990 
thread lies across the gap like rungs on

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:43.040 
thread lies across the gap like rungs on
a<00:03:40.020> ladder<00:03:40.460> after<00:03:41.460> a<00:03:41.490> few<00:03:41.700> stitches<00:03:41.940> you<00:03:42.780> pull

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.050 
a ladder after a few stitches you pull

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:44.720 
a ladder after a few stitches you pull
the<00:03:43.170> thread<00:03:43.320> up<00:03:43.530> gently<00:03:43.890> to<00:03:44.130> close<00:03:44.340> the<00:03:44.550> gap

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
the thread up gently to close the gap

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:48.170 
the thread up gently to close the gap
and<00:03:45.060> carry<00:03:45.630> on<00:03:45.920> so<00:03:46.920> now<00:03:47.130> we<00:03:47.190> have<00:03:47.460> the<00:03:47.760> finished

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
