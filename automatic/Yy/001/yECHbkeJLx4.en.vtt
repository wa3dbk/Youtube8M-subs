00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.040 
a lot harder than a normal 24 they've
also<00:01:30.580> got<00:01:30.880> much<00:01:31.090> bigger<00:01:31.300> shields<00:01:31.780> than<00:01:31.930> before

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
also got much bigger shields than before

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.050 
also got much bigger shields than before
even<00:01:32.590> though<00:01:32.710> that<00:01:32.890> HP<00:01:33.280> is<00:01:33.310> still<00:01:33.640> relatively

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:34.060 
even though that HP is still relatively

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:36.150 
even though that HP is still relatively
low<00:01:34.480> so<00:01:35.020> don't<00:01:35.230> take<00:01:35.410> these<00:01:35.620> missions<00:01:35.950> too

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
low so don't take these missions too

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.590 
low so don't take these missions too
lightly<00:01:36.460> but<00:01:36.790> if<00:01:36.880> you're<00:01:37.060> in<00:01:37.150> a<00:01:37.210> group<00:01:37.420> of

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600 
lightly but if you're in a group of

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.210 
lightly but if you're in a group of
three<00:01:37.870> should<00:01:38.200> find<00:01:38.380> pretty<00:01:38.620> much<00:01:38.800> all<00:01:39.040> of

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
three should find pretty much all of

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.950 
three should find pretty much all of
them<00:01:39.340> easy<00:01:39.640> the<00:01:40.150> only<00:01:40.390> one<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.540> is<00:01:40.720> quite

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
them easy the only one that is quite

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:42.600 
them easy the only one that is quite
difficult<00:01:41.170> is<00:01:41.470> the<00:01:41.590> black<00:01:41.770> gardens<00:01:42.250> it<00:01:42.430> does

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
difficult is the black gardens it does

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.670 
difficult is the black gardens it does
take<00:01:42.850> quite<00:01:43.030> a<00:01:43.120> long<00:01:43.210> time<00:01:43.420> so<00:01:44.260> as<00:01:44.470> I<00:01:44.620> said

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:44.680 
take quite a long time so as I said

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.320 
take quite a long time so as I said
before<00:01:44.890> once<00:01:45.400> you<00:01:45.520> complete<00:01:45.850> each<00:01:45.970> mission

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
before once you complete each mission

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.240 
before once you complete each mission
you're<00:01:46.570> gonna<00:01:46.660> get<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.900> piece<00:01:47.200> of<00:01:47.230> armor<00:01:47.980> and<00:01:48.190> I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
you're gonna get a piece of armor and I

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.010 
you're gonna get a piece of armor and I
got<00:01:48.430> a<00:01:48.460> lot<00:01:48.520> of<00:01:48.700> different<00:01:49.030> variations<00:01:49.660> of<00:01:49.870> the

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:50.020 
got a lot of different variations of the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:51.870 
got a lot of different variations of the
chest<00:01:50.320> and<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.710> head<00:01:50.740> two<00:01:51.370> of<00:01:51.520> which<00:01:51.670> I've

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:51.880 
chest and the head two of which I've

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:53.040 
chest and the head two of which I've
kept<00:01:52.150> but<00:01:52.420> a<00:01:52.450> lot<00:01:52.600> of<00:01:52.630> them<00:01:52.780> have<00:01:52.930> actually

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:53.050 
kept but a lot of them have actually

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.930 
kept but a lot of them have actually
dismantled<00:01:53.680> and<00:01:54.220> that's<00:01:54.550> where<00:01:54.730> you're<00:01:54.820> going

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:54.940 
dismantled and that's where you're going

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.000 
dismantled and that's where you're going
to<00:01:55.000> get<00:01:55.090> your<00:01:55.210> ascendant<00:01:55.570> shards<00:01:55.830> every<00:01:56.830> time

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:57.010 
to get your ascendant shards every time

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:58.620 
to get your ascendant shards every time
you<00:01:57.160> dismantle<00:01:57.790> a<00:01:57.880> piece<00:01:58.090> of<00:01:58.120> the<00:01:58.390> Queen's

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
you dismantle a piece of the Queen's

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.240 
you dismantle a piece of the Queen's
army<00:01:58.870> you're<00:01:59.110> going<00:01:59.230> to<00:01:59.290> get<00:01:59.410> two<00:01:59.620> or<00:01:59.920> three

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:00.250 
army you're going to get two or three

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.160 
army you're going to get two or three
ascendant<00:02:00.820> shards<00:02:00.880> so<00:02:01.390> I<00:02:01.420> managed<00:02:01.720> to<00:02:01.810> get<00:02:01.900> ten

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
ascendant shards so I managed to get ten

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.200 
ascendant shards so I managed to get ten
shots<00:02:02.200> yesterday<00:02:02.770> from<00:02:03.190> dismantling<00:02:03.880> four

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:04.210 
shots yesterday from dismantling four

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:06.630 
shots yesterday from dismantling four
items<00:02:04.510> so<00:02:05.290> if<00:02:05.410> this<00:02:05.560> timed<00:02:05.860> event<00:02:06.190> lasts<00:02:06.430> until

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
items so if this timed event lasts until

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.279 
items so if this timed event lasts until
friday<00:02:07.060> that's<00:02:07.420> a<00:02:07.510> potential<00:02:07.990> of<00:02:08.050> more<00:02:08.259> than

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
friday that's a potential of more than

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:10.109 
friday that's a potential of more than
50<00:02:08.800> ascendant<00:02:09.280> shards<00:02:09.340> which<00:02:09.789> is<00:02:09.970> awesome

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
50 ascendant shards which is awesome

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:11.699 
50 ascendant shards which is awesome
compared<00:02:10.690> to<00:02:10.810> the<00:02:10.869> amount<00:02:10.959> i<00:02:11.230> was<00:02:11.440> getting

00:02:11.699 --> 00:02:11.709 
compared to the amount i was getting

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:13.170 
compared to the amount i was getting
before<00:02:11.800> which<00:02:12.160> is<00:02:12.190> about<00:02:12.459> one<00:02:12.700> or<00:02:12.849> two<00:02:12.879> a<00:02:13.060> day

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
before which is about one or two a day

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.119 
before which is about one or two a day
the<00:02:13.870> only<00:02:14.050> other<00:02:14.080> ways<00:02:14.379> of<00:02:14.560> doing<00:02:14.770> it<00:02:14.920> is<00:02:15.069> the

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
the only other ways of doing it is the

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.099 
the only other ways of doing it is the
night<00:02:15.579> full<00:02:15.819> strike<00:02:16.150> and<00:02:16.390> also<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.780> vault<00:02:16.989> but

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:17.109 
night full strike and also the vault but

00:02:17.109 --> 00:02:18.720 
night full strike and also the vault but
they're<00:02:17.260> pretty<00:02:17.409> difficult<00:02:17.709> although<00:02:18.489> people

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
they're pretty difficult although people

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.099 
they're pretty difficult although people
that<00:02:19.060> have<00:02:19.150> spent<00:02:19.390> weeks<00:02:19.599> trying<00:02:19.719> to<00:02:20.019> get

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:20.109 
that have spent weeks trying to get

00:02:20.109 --> 00:02:21.450 
that have spent weeks trying to get
their<00:02:20.290> legendary<00:02:20.709> gear<00:02:21.010> might<00:02:21.219> be

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
their legendary gear might be

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.220 
their legendary gear might be
annoyed<00:02:21.850> about<00:02:22.000> this<00:02:22.330> this<00:02:22.600> is<00:02:22.750> a<00:02:22.780> really<00:02:23.080> good

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
annoyed about this this is a really good

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:24.720 
annoyed about this this is a really good
way<00:02:23.290> of<00:02:23.440> allowing<00:02:23.770> people<00:02:24.040> that<00:02:24.310> don't<00:02:24.520> play

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
way of allowing people that don't play

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.520 
way of allowing people that don't play
that<00:02:24.970> much<00:02:25.150> to<00:02:25.390> take<00:02:25.570> part<00:02:25.780> in<00:02:25.990> the<00:02:26.050> hardest

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
that much to take part in the hardest
