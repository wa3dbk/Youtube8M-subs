00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.680 
you're down there it makes a difference

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.130 
you're down there it makes a difference
and<00:04:01.100> that's<00:04:01.670> not<00:04:02.440> 99<00:04:03.670> it<00:04:04.670> was<00:04:04.910> a<00:04:05.120> it<00:04:05.930> was<00:04:05.990> a

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
and that's not 99 it was a it was a

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:10.610 
and that's not 99 it was a it was a
combination<00:04:06.710> a<00:04:07.040> little<00:04:07.310> bit<00:04:07.460> of

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:15.099 

loss<00:04:11.220> of<00:04:11.549> personality<00:04:12.480> offensive<00:04:12.930> line<00:04:13.110> and

00:04:15.099 --> 00:04:15.109 
loss of personality offensive line and

00:04:15.109 --> 00:04:19.580 
loss of personality offensive line and
and<00:04:16.109> i<00:04:16.680> think<00:04:16.979> i<00:04:17.400> think<00:04:17.669> our<00:04:18.209> club<00:04:18.630> did<00:04:18.840> a<00:04:18.959> great

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
and i think i think our club did a great

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.230 
and i think i think our club did a great
job<00:04:19.620> in<00:04:19.889> over<00:04:20.310> a<00:04:20.340> week<00:04:20.840> nice<00:04:21.840> plan<00:04:22.460> and<00:04:23.460> I<00:04:23.580> think

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:26.240 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:31.129 

give<00:04:27.240> them<00:04:27.419> correct<00:04:29.120> your<00:04:30.120> explanation<00:04:30.960> over

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:31.139 
give them correct your explanation over

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.640 
give them correct your explanation over
for<00:04:31.410> net<00:04:31.590> though<00:04:31.860> I<00:04:33.020> mean<00:04:34.020> only<00:04:34.169> gave<00:04:34.440> only

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
for net though I mean only gave only

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:37.580 
for net though I mean only gave only
will<00:04:35.010> he<00:04:35.160> had<00:04:35.370> what<00:04:36.000> 20<00:04:36.389> carries<00:04:36.720> maybe<00:04:37.110> just

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
will he had what 20 carries maybe just

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.140 
will he had what 20 carries maybe just
write<00:04:38.190> it<00:04:38.280> right<00:04:38.490> at<00:04:38.780> 25<00:04:39.780> would<00:04:40.050> be<00:04:40.229> the

00:04:41.140 --> 00:04:41.150 
write it right at 25 would be the

00:04:41.150 --> 00:04:45.710 
write it right at 25 would be the
quarterback<00:04:42.150> I<00:04:43.550> think<00:04:44.550> no<00:04:45.090> matter<00:04:45.210> what<00:04:45.539> you

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
quarterback I think no matter what you

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.120 
quarterback I think no matter what you
do<00:04:46.020> you<00:04:46.080> do<00:04:46.289> with<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.590> remainder<00:04:46.889> of<00:04:47.010> the

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
do you do with the remainder of the

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.070 
do you do with the remainder of the
carries<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:48.270> know<00:04:48.300> what<00:04:48.510> we've<00:04:48.690> done<00:04:48.870> this

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080

carries you know what we've done this
we've<00:04:49.289> kind<00:04:49.680> of<00:04:49.740> harsh<00:04:50.639> and<00:04:50.699> off<00:04:51.080> the<00:04:52.080> packages

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:52.740 
we've kind of harsh and off the packages

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.320 
we've kind of harsh and off the packages
certain<00:04:53.430> guys<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.610> be<00:04:53.820> better<00:04:54.000> than<00:04:54.150> other
