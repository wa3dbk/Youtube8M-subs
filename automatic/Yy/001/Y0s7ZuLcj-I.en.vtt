 I want to drink tea 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.730
 Disagreeable 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:26.650
 But I also want to drink carbonated juice 

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:31.180

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:38.650
 I have met finally tea and carbonate 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.650
 Slightly sweet dumplings with spice 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.360

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:50.610

 Departure from the spring you're still train in the morning is Yara and I thought of the characters cute of standing Kyohei 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.700
 Raw chat carbonated 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:01:02.390
 Is it really delicious ? 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:05.260
 What is the nutrient label is 14kcal of energy per 100ml 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.040
 It is written that it is slightly sweet 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:11.100
 No artificial sweeteners are used 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:13.939
 No juice is included 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.939
 I will try 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.619
 Of I feel it 's so much But I have raised carbonate 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:29.799
 I did not make a sound, but I will 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.370
 I will tell you what frank impressions you have 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:51.980
 Unpalatable 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:51.980
 Carbonate is a taste that I do not know somehow and put in so strongly there is no mouth 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:04.350
 Such as was remembered drinking this is drank sometimes wrong water that has entered the pool 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:10.090
 taste 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:13.080
 This is a personal opinion, but I feel that I have lost a long time 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.680
 Probably already buy 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.680

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.450
 Kirin fresh tea for that 

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:24.900
 The spa cream was introduced 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:32.800
 I don't know itching because it's so sweetened with carbonated tea 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:38.310
 After all tea 

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:38.310
