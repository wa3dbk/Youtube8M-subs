it<00:02:16.040> is<00:02:16.190> 58<00:02:16.730> inches<00:02:17.090> long<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:18.310> 32<00:02:19.310> inches<00:02:19.459> wide

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
it is 58 inches long and 32 inches wide

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:23.699 
it is 58 inches long and 32 inches wide
I'm<00:02:20.380> thinking<00:02:21.380> of<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.920> to<00:02:22.160> 60<00:02:22.610> inches<00:02:22.970> maybe

00:02:23.699 --> 00:02:23.709 
I'm thinking of going to 60 inches maybe

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:28.059 
I'm thinking of going to 60 inches maybe
65<00:02:24.709> the<00:02:25.069> most<00:02:25.959> but<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.319> the<00:02:27.500> most<00:02:27.709> I'll<00:02:27.890> do

00:02:28.059 --> 00:02:28.069 
65 the most but that's the most I'll do

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:30.190 
65 the most but that's the most I'll do
but<00:02:28.790> it's<00:02:28.910> I<00:02:29.120> think<00:02:29.180> it's<00:02:29.540> coming<00:02:29.959> along<00:02:30.140> very

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
but it's I think it's coming along very

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.410 
but it's I think it's coming along very
nicely<00:02:30.760> all<00:02:31.760> right<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:32.420> let<00:02:33.140> the<00:02:33.319> demo<00:02:33.500> begin

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.420 
nicely all right so let the demo begin

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.229 
nicely all right so let the demo begin
so<00:02:35.420> I<00:02:35.690> just<00:02:35.959> basically<00:02:36.370> knit<00:02:37.370> as<00:02:37.580> I<00:02:37.760> would<00:02:38.060> I'm

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
so I just basically knit as I would I'm

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:39.759 
so I just basically knit as I would I'm
holding<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.690> four<00:02:38.930> strands<00:02:39.260> as<00:02:39.440> though<00:02:39.590> it's

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:39.769 
holding the four strands as though it's

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:44.380 
holding the four strands as though it's
one<00:02:40.040> so<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.360> carry<00:02:41.750> it<00:02:41.900> all<00:02:42.080> together<00:02:42.319> and<00:02:43.390> I

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:44.390 
one so I carry it all together and I

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:50.080 
one so I carry it all together and I
just<00:02:44.660> knit<00:02:44.900> as<00:02:45.110> I<00:02:45.290> normally<00:02:45.349> would<00:02:45.830> I'm<00:02:49.090> gonna

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
just knit as I normally would I'm gonna

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.300 
just knit as I normally would I'm gonna
finish<00:02:50.390> this<00:02:50.720> row<00:02:51.080> because<00:02:51.620> I<00:02:51.650> do<00:02:51.830> want<00:02:52.220> to

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
finish this row because I do want to

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.600 
finish this row because I do want to
show<00:02:53.019> you<00:02:54.019> all<00:02:54.230> something<00:02:54.620> that<00:02:54.860> happens<00:02:55.459> at

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:55.610 
show you all something that happens at

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:57.130 
show you all something that happens at
the<00:02:55.760> end<00:02:55.940> of<00:02:56.150> each<00:02:56.269> row<00:02:56.540> that<00:02:56.750> you<00:02:56.840> have<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:57.049> be

00:02:57.130 --> 00:02:57.140 
the end of each row that you have to be

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.830 
the end of each row that you have to be
very<00:02:57.380> careful<00:02:57.890> of<00:02:58.040> I'll<00:02:58.819> even<00:02:59.060> demonstrate

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840 
very careful of I'll even demonstrate

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.280 
very careful of I'll even demonstrate
right<00:03:00.019> now<00:03:01.180> at<00:03:02.180> the<00:03:02.390> end<00:03:02.569> here<00:03:02.930> you<00:03:03.110> know<00:03:03.230> you

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:03.290 
right now at the end here you know you

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
right now at the end here you know you
got<00:03:03.560> to<00:03:03.650> make<00:03:03.799> sure<00:03:04.010> because<00:03:04.280> sometimes<00:03:04.819> my

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
got to make sure because sometimes my

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:10.210 
got to make sure because sometimes my
stitches<00:03:07.310> go<00:03:07.549> over<00:03:08.030> this<00:03:08.209> hump<00:03:08.510> right<00:03:08.810> here<00:03:09.220> so

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
stitches go over this hump right here so

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:12.970 
stitches go over this hump right here so
it<00:03:10.700> goes<00:03:10.910> over<00:03:11.090> the<00:03:11.330> stopper<00:03:11.900> and<00:03:12.170> so<00:03:12.769> you<00:03:12.860> just

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
it goes over the stopper and so you just

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.670 
it goes over the stopper and so you just
have<00:03:13.069> to<00:03:13.220> be<00:03:13.400> very<00:03:13.610> careful<00:03:14.120> the<00:03:14.780> speed<00:03:15.349> sticks

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 
have to be very careful the speed sticks

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.930 
have to be very careful the speed sticks
are<00:03:15.860> 14<00:03:16.519> inches<00:03:16.910> long<00:03:17.950> and<00:03:18.950> honestly<00:03:19.489> I<00:03:19.609> wish

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
are 14 inches long and honestly I wish

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.610 
are 14 inches long and honestly I wish
they<00:03:20.060> were<00:03:20.180> a<00:03:20.209> little<00:03:20.359> bit<00:03:20.870> longer<00:03:21.109> because

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
they were a little bit longer because

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.170 
they were a little bit longer because
sometimes<00:03:22.340> I<00:03:22.549> guess<00:03:22.730> they<00:03:22.820> don't<00:03:22.940> suspect

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
sometimes I guess they don't suspect

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.259 
sometimes I guess they don't suspect
that<00:03:23.510> you<00:03:23.690> would<00:03:23.810> have<00:03:24.220> something<00:03:25.220> that<00:03:25.519> has<00:03:25.700> a

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
that you would have something that has a

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:31.960 
that you would have something that has a
whole<00:03:27.049> bunch<00:03:27.079> of<00:03:27.380> cast<00:03:27.620> ons<00:03:27.920> but<00:03:30.040> yeah<00:03:31.040> such<00:03:31.819> as

is<00:04:29.230> about<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.470> crawl<00:04:29.830> over<00:04:29.860> the<00:04:30.250> stopper<00:04:30.700> so

00:04:30.900 --> 00:04:30.910 
is about to crawl over the stopper so

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.170 
is about to crawl over the stopper so
you<00:04:31.000> just<00:04:31.210> gotta<00:04:31.419> twist<00:04:32.350> it<00:04:32.560> back<00:04:32.800> down<00:04:33.180> and

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:34.180 
you just gotta twist it back down and

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:38.980 
right now it's jam-packed it's

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:41.430 
right now it's jam-packed it's
jam-packed<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:39.790> we<00:04:40.000> still<00:04:40.240> have<00:04:40.510> a<00:04:41.050> couple

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
jam-packed and we still have a couple

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.200 
jam-packed and we still have a couple
more<00:04:41.770> stitches<00:04:41.919> on<00:04:42.220> the<00:04:42.310> other<00:04:42.340> needle<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:42.970> let

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
more stitches on the other needle so let

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:46.620 
more stitches on the other needle so let
me<00:04:43.300> just<00:04:44.550> stand<00:04:45.550> it<00:04:45.760> out<00:04:45.880> there<00:04:46.150> so<00:04:46.360> that<00:04:46.390> you

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:46.630 
me just stand it out there so that you

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:50.490 
me just stand it out there so that you
guys<00:04:46.810> can<00:04:47.080> see<00:04:47.340> see<00:04:48.840> so<00:04:49.840> you<00:04:49.900> just<00:04:50.110> have<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.290> be

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
guys can see see so you just have to be

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.260 
guys can see see so you just have to be
very<00:04:50.710> careful<00:04:51.220> so<00:04:51.370> that's<00:04:51.550> the<00:04:51.700> only<00:04:51.820> reason

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:52.270 
very careful so that's the only reason

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:54.409 
very careful so that's the only reason
why<00:04:52.360> I<00:04:52.390> wish<00:04:52.840> they<00:04:52.990> were<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.169> tad<00:04:53.560> bit<00:04:54.040> longer

00:04:54.409 --> 00:04:54.419 
why I wish they were a tad bit longer

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.580 
why I wish they were a tad bit longer
maybe<00:04:55.419> like<00:04:55.660> 15<00:04:56.110> inches<00:04:56.440> would<00:04:56.560> be<00:04:56.620> fine<00:04:58.590> or

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
maybe like 15 inches would be fine or

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.980 
maybe like 15 inches would be fine or
some<00:05:00.010> you<00:05:00.520> know<00:05:00.640> speed<00:05:01.060> stick<00:05:01.360> circulars<00:05:01.960> that

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990 
some you know speed stick circulars that

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:03.030 
some you know speed stick circulars that
would<00:05:02.350> be<00:05:02.470> nice

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:03.040 
would be nice

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.420 
would be nice
speed<00:05:03.910> circulars<00:05:07.560> okay<00:05:08.560> so<00:05:08.620> sometimes<00:05:09.070> you

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.430 
speed circulars okay so sometimes you

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.670 
speed circulars okay so sometimes you
get<00:05:09.610> one<00:05:09.940> I<00:05:10.180> do<00:05:10.240> I<00:05:10.419> had<00:05:10.750> situations<00:05:11.110> where<00:05:11.560> I

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:11.680 
get one I do I had situations where I

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:14.370 
get one I do I had situations where I
had<00:05:11.830> to<00:05:11.950> go<00:05:12.130> back<00:05:12.340> and<00:05:12.870> because<00:05:13.870> you<00:05:14.020> know<00:05:14.140> one

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:14.380 
had to go back and because you know one

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.590 
had to go back and because you know one
of<00:05:14.530> the<00:05:14.710> four<00:05:15.100> would<00:05:15.520> fall<00:05:15.760> off<00:05:15.790> and<00:05:16.300> then<00:05:16.390> it's

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:16.600 
of the four would fall off and then it's

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.000 
of the four would fall off and then it's
hanging<00:05:16.840> and<00:05:17.080> you<00:05:17.140> realize<00:05:17.410> you<00:05:17.560> only<00:05:17.650> you're

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010 
hanging and you realize you only you're

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:20.790 
hanging and you realize you only you're
only<00:05:18.280> you're<00:05:18.669> only<00:05:18.880> holding<00:05:19.330> three<00:05:19.630> so<00:05:20.410> be

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:20.800 
only you're only holding three so be

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.380

you<00:05:25.510> don't<00:05:25.720> have<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.140> use<00:05:26.860> four<00:05:27.190> schemes<00:05:27.640> of

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:27.850 
you don't have to use four schemes of

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:30.210 
you don't have to use four schemes of
yarn<00:05:28.060> like<00:05:28.270> I<00:05:28.330> did<00:05:28.810> I<00:05:29.020> obviously<00:05:29.620> wanted<00:05:30.070> this

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:30.220 
yarn like I did I obviously wanted this

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:35.690 
yarn like I did I obviously wanted this
to<00:05:30.400> be<00:05:30.520> thick<00:05:32.070> I'm<00:05:33.070> sorry<00:05:33.430> pushing<00:05:33.880> this<00:05:34.030> down

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
but I love the speed sticks I'll

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.790 
but I love the speed sticks I'll
definitely<00:05:45.479> work<00:05:45.660> with<00:05:45.840> them<00:05:45.990> again<00:05:46.320> so
