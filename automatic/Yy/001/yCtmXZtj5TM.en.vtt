well<00:00:04.490> here<00:00:05.490> I<00:00:05.520> am<00:00:05.640> with<00:00:05.910> Count<00:00:06.150> Chocula

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
well here I am with Count Chocula

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.310 
well here I am with Count Chocula
and<00:00:08.460> I<00:00:08.519> was<00:00:08.700> worried<00:00:09.030> that<00:00:09.090> the<00:00:09.300> old<00:00:09.690> chopper

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
and I was worried that the old chopper

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.620 
and I was worried that the old chopper
Forks<00:00:10.800> would<00:00:11.429> take<00:00:11.610> too<00:00:11.730> much<00:00:11.880> damage<00:00:12.179> on<00:00:12.480> the

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630 
Forks would take too much damage on the

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.799 
Forks would take too much damage on the
road<00:00:13.130> these<00:00:14.130> are<00:00:14.340> my<00:00:14.429> original<00:00:14.700> chopper<00:00:15.570> force

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
road these are my original chopper force

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:19.820 
road these are my original chopper force
you<00:00:15.960> can<00:00:16.080> see<00:00:16.289> where<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.490> bolted<00:00:17.490> my<00:00:18.439> cut<00:00:19.439> Forks

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:19.830 
you can see where I bolted my cut Forks

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.820 
you can see where I bolted my cut Forks
in<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.130> first<00:00:20.400> time<00:00:20.550> I<00:00:20.580> made<00:00:20.850> a<00:00:20.880> chopper<00:00:21.800> so<00:00:22.800> I

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
in the first time I made a chopper so I

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.880 
in the first time I made a chopper so I
made<00:00:23.220> a<00:00:23.250> springer<00:00:23.640> fork<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.119> it<00:00:24.710> and<00:00:25.710> I'd<00:00:25.800> like

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
made a springer fork for it and I'd like

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.200 
made a springer fork for it and I'd like
to<00:00:25.949> demonstrate<00:00:26.189> how<00:00:26.609> you<00:00:26.670> do<00:00:26.849> this

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:27.210 
to demonstrate how you do this

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.040 
to demonstrate how you do this
in<00:00:27.349> just<00:00:28.349> four<00:00:28.650> easy<00:00:28.890> steps<00:00:29.070> or<00:00:29.779> using<00:00:30.779> four

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
in just four easy steps or using four

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.620 
in just four easy steps or using four
pieces<00:00:31.610> the<00:00:32.610> first<00:00:32.820> thing<00:00:33.000> I<00:00:33.059> did<00:00:33.120> is<00:00:33.329> I<00:00:33.450> went

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:33.630 
pieces the first thing I did is I went

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.049 
pieces the first thing I did is I went
and<00:00:33.780> made<00:00:33.870> myself<00:00:34.050> a<00:00:34.380> bridge<00:00:34.649> this<00:00:35.579> is<00:00:35.760> just<00:00:35.969> a

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
and made myself a bridge this is just a

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.270 
and made myself a bridge this is just a
chunk<00:00:36.239> of<00:00:36.390> metal<00:00:36.540> that<00:00:37.500> goes<00:00:37.680> across<00:00:37.800> your

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
chunk of metal that goes across your

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.639 
chunk of metal that goes across your
your<00:00:38.910> double<00:00:39.210> tree<00:00:39.390> here<00:00:39.629> and<00:00:39.840> it's<00:00:40.530> got<00:00:40.620> a

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
your double tree here and it's got a

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.770 
your double tree here and it's got a
hole<00:00:40.860> in<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:42.530> could<00:00:43.530> be<00:00:43.680> pretty<00:00:43.890> much<00:00:43.950> anything

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
hole in it could be pretty much anything

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.490 
hole in it could be pretty much anything
that's<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:46.110> that's<00:00:47.010> what<00:00:47.190> holds<00:00:47.370> the<00:00:47.640> spring

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:48.500 
that's the that's what holds the spring

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.220 
that's the that's what holds the spring
the<00:00:49.500> second<00:00:49.829> thing<00:00:49.950> that<00:00:49.980> I<00:00:50.160> did<00:00:50.960> as<00:00:51.960> I<00:00:52.079> went

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
the second thing that I did as I went

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.049 
the second thing that I did as I went
and<00:00:52.320> I<00:00:52.410> added<00:00:52.590> these<00:00:52.800> two<00:00:53.039> tabs<00:00:53.340> to<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.760> end<00:00:53.969> of

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and I added these two tabs to the end of

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.139 
and I added these two tabs to the end of
my<00:00:54.120> fork<00:00:54.449> I<00:00:54.600> cut<00:00:54.870> my<00:00:55.020> normal<00:00:55.320> dropouts<00:00:55.770> off<00:00:56.149> and

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
my fork I cut my normal dropouts off and

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.470 
my fork I cut my normal dropouts off and
I<00:00:57.239> added<00:00:57.539> these<00:00:57.629> little<00:00:58.020> tabs<00:00:58.289> now<00:00:59.329> you<00:01:00.329> can

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
I added these little tabs now you can

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.810 
I added these little tabs now you can
use<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.660> big<00:01:01.469> washer<00:01:02.010> if<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.280> don't<00:01:02.460> even<00:01:02.609> want

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
use a big washer if you don't even want

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.119 
use a big washer if you don't even want
to<00:01:02.879> take<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.180> time<00:01:03.390> to<00:01:03.719> drill<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> hole<00:01:04.979> in

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
to take the time to drill a hole in

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.410 
to take the time to drill a hole in
something<00:01:06.049> so<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.680> bridge<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.850> tabs<00:01:09.150> are

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
something so the bridge and the tabs are

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.850 
something so the bridge and the tabs are
the<00:01:09.510> only<00:01:09.689> modification<00:01:09.960> you<00:01:10.470> make<00:01:10.619> to<00:01:10.770> the

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
the only modification you make to the

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.219 
the only modification you make to the
fork<00:01:11.100> itself<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:11.900> then<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> need<00:01:13.170> to

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
fork itself and then you need to

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:16.399 
fork itself and then you need to
manufacture<00:01:13.830> a<00:01:13.860> few<00:01:14.130> more<00:01:14.250> pieces<00:01:15.200> this<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
manufacture a few more pieces this is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.230 
manufacture a few more pieces this is
another<00:01:16.710> fork<00:01:17.360> like<00:01:18.360> an<00:01:18.479> extra<00:01:18.840> fork<00:01:20.060> it<00:01:21.060> goes

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:21.240 
another fork like an extra fork it goes

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.240 
another fork like an extra fork it goes
on<00:01:21.390> top<00:01:21.630> there's<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.560> weight<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:22.830> the<00:01:22.890> spring

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
on top there's the weight of the spring

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.440 
on top there's the weight of the spring
all<00:01:23.549> it<00:01:23.729> is<00:01:23.850> is<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> take<00:01:24.479> an<00:01:24.659> A<00:01:24.750> I<00:01:25.290> used<00:01:26.070> a<00:01:26.450> seat

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
all it is is I take an A I used a seat

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.969 
all it is is I take an A I used a seat
stay<00:01:27.689> off<00:01:27.869> of<00:01:27.900> another<00:01:28.140> frame<00:01:28.619> because<00:01:28.920> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
stay off of another frame because I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.460 
stay off of another frame because I
wanted<00:01:29.189> to<00:01:29.250> be<00:01:29.400> able<00:01:29.460> to<00:01:29.610> use<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:30.470> that

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
wanted to be able to use that that

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.789 
wanted to be able to use that that
breaks<00:01:31.890> top<00:01:32.250> cable<00:01:32.790> stock<00:01:33.500> and<00:01:34.500> I've<00:01:34.560> taken

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
breaks top cable stock and I've taken

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:37.880 
breaks top cable stock and I've taken
and<00:01:35.009> I've<00:01:35.070> welded<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.549> large<00:01:35.790> bolt<00:01:36.500> to<00:01:37.500> one<00:01:37.710> end

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and I've welded a large bolt to one end

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.389 
and I've welded a large bolt to one end
of<00:01:37.979> it

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
of it

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.490 
of it
down<00:01:40.399> on<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.610> other<00:01:40.729> end<00:01:40.969> I've<00:01:41.780> given<00:01:42.259> it<00:01:42.380> the

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:42.500 
down on the other end I've given it the

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.870 
down on the other end I've given it the
same<00:01:42.740> sort<00:01:43.039> of<00:01:43.100> thing<00:01:43.340> some<00:01:43.670> tabs<00:01:45.549> some<00:01:46.549> tabs

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:46.880 
same sort of thing some tabs some tabs

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.669 
same sort of thing some tabs some tabs
with<00:01:47.750> holes<00:01:48.020> in<00:01:48.229> them

00:01:48.669 --> 00:01:48.679 
with holes in them

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.010 
with holes in them
I<00:01:48.710> made<00:01:49.130> them<00:01:49.250> spiky<00:01:49.820> but<00:01:50.450> once<00:01:50.600> again<00:01:50.899> if

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.020 
I made them spiky but once again if

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:52.389 
I made them spiky but once again if
you're<00:01:51.110> lazy<00:01:51.350> you<00:01:51.619> could<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:51.920> use<00:01:52.070> a<00:01:52.100> giant

00:01:52.389 --> 00:01:52.399 
you're lazy you could just use a giant

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.539

or<00:02:10.789> cantilever<00:02:11.390> bars<00:02:11.890> they<00:02:12.890> fit<00:02:13.220> into<00:02:13.459> the

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:13.580 
or cantilever bars they fit into the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.259 
or cantilever bars they fit into the
bottom<00:02:13.970> of<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:15.680> fork<00:02:16.250> there<00:02:16.459> and<00:02:16.700> this<00:02:17.120> is

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:17.269 
bottom of the fork there and this is

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.050 
bottom of the fork there and this is
what<00:02:17.450> allows<00:02:17.569> the<00:02:17.930> hinge<00:02:18.230> the<00:02:18.920> action<00:02:19.459> of<00:02:19.700> the

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060 
what allows the hinge the action of the

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.300 
what allows the hinge the action of the
spring<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.750> give<00:02:20.900> your<00:02:21.110> bike<00:02:21.470> some<00:02:21.769> suspension

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:22.310 
spring to give your bike some suspension

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.170 
spring to give your bike some suspension
on<00:02:22.400> the<00:02:22.489> front<00:02:22.760> end<00:02:24.459> now<00:02:25.459> we<00:02:25.519> take<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.940> extra

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
on the front end now we take the extra

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.559 
on the front end now we take the extra
fork<00:02:26.569> and<00:02:27.140> put<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.380> spring<00:02:27.709> on<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.980> end<00:02:28.569> and

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
fork and put a spring on the end and

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:30.789 
fork and put a spring on the end and
just<00:02:29.840> slide<00:02:30.079> it<00:02:30.230> up<00:02:30.319> through<00:02:30.500> the<00:02:30.590> bridge

00:02:30.789 --> 00:02:30.799 
just slide it up through the bridge

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:33.160 
just slide it up through the bridge
there<00:02:31.329> here's<00:02:32.329> where<00:02:32.480> your<00:02:32.599> suspension

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:33.170 
there here's where your suspension

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:37.600 
there here's where your suspension
actually<00:02:33.500> comes<00:02:33.739> from<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.890> the<00:02:37.099> travel<00:02:37.519> on

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
actually comes from that's the travel on

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.809 
actually comes from that's the travel on
your<00:02:37.730> front<00:02:37.970> wheel

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.020 

take<00:02:41.390> another<00:02:41.689> spring<00:02:42.340> set<00:02:43.340> it<00:02:43.430> on<00:02:43.549> top<00:02:43.790> and

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
take another spring set it on top and

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.119 
take another spring set it on top and
then<00:02:44.599> when<00:02:44.959> we<00:02:45.079> get<00:02:45.200> done<00:02:45.379> will<00:02:45.590> bow<00:02:45.709> that<00:02:45.950> down

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:46.129 
then when we get done will bow that down

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:48.250 
then when we get done will bow that down
now<00:02:46.790> we'll<00:02:46.939> take<00:02:47.090> the<00:02:47.239> secondary<00:02:47.719> fork<00:02:48.079> and

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
now we'll take the secondary fork and

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:54.910 
now we'll take the secondary fork and
the<00:02:49.159> tabs<00:02:49.459> and<00:02:50.200> insert<00:02:53.170> them<00:02:54.170> into<00:02:54.379> there<00:02:54.590> so

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
the tabs and insert them into there so

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.190 
the tabs and insert them into there so
then<00:02:55.099> there<00:02:55.310> you<00:02:55.459> can<00:02:55.609> see<00:02:55.790> that's<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.299> hinge

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:57.200 
then there you can see that's the hinge

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.110 
then there you can see that's the hinge
or<00:02:57.469> lever<00:02:57.680> action<00:02:59.290> for<00:03:00.290> the<00:03:00.379> suspension<00:03:01.120> and

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
or lever action for the suspension and

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.399 
or lever action for the suspension and
obviously<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:02.659> wheel<00:03:02.870> just<00:03:03.459> goes<00:03:04.459> right<00:03:04.639> here

00:03:05.399 --> 00:03:05.409 
obviously the wheel just goes right here

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:10.960 
obviously the wheel just goes right here
so<00:03:06.409> now<00:03:06.530> you<00:03:06.590> can<00:03:06.829> see<00:03:07.010> it's<00:03:07.159> all<00:03:07.340> together

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.050 

and<00:03:11.390> then<00:03:11.630> up<00:03:12.050> on<00:03:12.200> the<00:03:12.290> top<00:03:12.500> here<00:03:13.030> we're<00:03:14.030> just

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
and then up on the top here we're just

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:20.290 
and then up on the top here we're just
going<00:03:14.300> to<00:03:14.390> put<00:03:14.630> like<00:03:14.990> a<00:03:15.230> washer<00:03:18.970> and<00:03:19.970> another

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
going to put like a washer and another

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.820 
going to put like a washer and another
nut

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:23.830 

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.500 

and<00:03:24.340> you<00:03:24.430> tighten<00:03:24.640> this<00:03:24.790> down<00:03:24.850> to<00:03:25.150> adjust<00:03:25.420> the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
and you tighten this down to adjust the

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:27.570 
and you tighten this down to adjust the
suspension<00:03:25.690> now<00:03:26.170> this<00:03:26.350> is<00:03:26.500> your<00:03:26.650> suspension

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:27.580 
suspension now this is your suspension

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:30.000 
suspension now this is your suspension
spring<00:03:27.910> this<00:03:28.720> is<00:03:28.780> your<00:03:29.050> return<00:03:29.350> spring<00:03:29.800> so

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:30.010 
spring this is your return spring so

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:31.920 
spring this is your return spring so
that<00:03:30.130> the<00:03:30.220> first<00:03:30.430> time<00:03:30.610> you<00:03:30.700> hit<00:03:30.790> a<00:03:30.850> bump<00:03:31.120> you

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
that the first time you hit a bump you

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.840 
that the first time you hit a bump you
don't<00:03:32.110> then<00:03:32.350> pop<00:03:32.680> a<00:03:32.710> massive<00:03:33.220> wheelie<00:03:33.610> from

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:33.850 
don't then pop a massive wheelie from

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.820 
don't then pop a massive wheelie from
the<00:03:33.970> energy<00:03:34.270> story<00:03:34.570> up<00:03:34.780> this<00:03:35.080> is<00:03:35.260> to<00:03:35.410> dampen

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
the energy story up this is to dampen

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.930 
the energy story up this is to dampen
the<00:03:35.890> return<00:03:37.020> and<00:03:38.020> there<00:03:38.740> you<00:03:38.830> go<00:03:39.010> the<00:03:39.670> quick

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
the return and there you go the quick

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:40.670 
the return and there you go the quick
and<00:03:40.120> easy

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:40.680 
and easy

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:48.090 
and easy
totally<00:03:41.680> sweet<00:03:43.830> rack<00:03:44.830> style<00:03:45.220> springer<00:03:45.730> fork
