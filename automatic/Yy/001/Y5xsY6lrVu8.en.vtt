00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 hi everyone at the DJ microphone he 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.330
 gamer and last cadet video 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:08.580
 Phantom I did not tell how to find two 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 the last words at the moment I already 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.690
 I know how they were found and ready to share with 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.690
 by this secret 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:24.480
 and since you probably remember the first 

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:27.779
 the word was dream which means dream and 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:31.349
 she was encrypted in the well-known 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:34.170
 Pictures of the site Kevin Simpson 1942. 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.500
 k and each letter was encrypted 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.280
 in some special way so let's start with 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.170
 letters d 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.220
 as you can see down here there is 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.780
 a bottle labeled 500 on it and if we 

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:50.720
 look and roman numbers 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.939
 500 is de 

00:00:50.720 --> 00:01:01.379
 letter de is so next letter letter 

00:00:53.939 --> 00:01:04.290
 and if we look at this picture 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.560
 then we can see. 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.650
 dash . this is morse code 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:16.820
 if we open it and see. 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:21.689
 dash . letter p is the next letter 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:24.960
 it's a letter and and we have it 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:28.170
 encrypted with this sticker for 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.850
 I need this word here I am writing 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.750
 letter and 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:40.670
 and everything seems to be usually worth the font 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.670
 calibri but if i change this shift 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:49.810
 familiar sign is n't it yes here it is 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.200
 the next letter is the letter and here is all 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:56.800
 just enough here it is formed 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.290
 paper roll and ladder and last 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:03.159
 the letter is the letter m you might think that 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:06.970
 it's all the same sticker but no if we 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:08.979
 let's see the Viking alphabet then under the letter 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:11.140
 m we can find quite familiar to us 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.760
 symbol and 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.190
 yes it is so on the stairs this particular 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.450
 symbol 

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.030
 it's like a trident 

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 in those poems that are laid out 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:30.239
 kevin simpson had a lot of clues 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.600
 but in one of them there were especially many of them. 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.170
 this is 3 poem 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.440
 Order activity rooms of the sale of 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:43.269
 lightness prince fly almaty 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.780
 especially immediately understandable first two 

00:02:43.269 --> 00:02:47.140
 lines 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:50.260
 if we correlate the phrase viking orders 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:52.269
 that is, the Vikings in the north with this 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.170
 picture we will see that just the same 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:58.299
 this sign of the basics avito vikings is 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:03.100
 in the north as to what I do not know 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:06.570
 further figure 500 romance of the south then 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:09.100
 there are romans in south south-south 

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:11.769
 then fly ps winx 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.880
 this is something related to this particular letter 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.269
 i like home otherwise I donâ€™t know 

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:21.340
 I got the word dream I can not imagine 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:24.190
 how brilliant is that man who 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:27.550
 gives a guess but wow 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:31.000
 just well done 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:33.310
 the next word in nir and here everything was 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.740
 it was enough just to 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.670
 guess help in this will serve us 

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:40.300
 all those 

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:42.250
 logos which kept the Kevin 

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:46.000
 simpson don't have to watch some 

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:52.000
 the planet separately above look at 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:54.340
 the whole picture together of the planet world and i don't 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.900
 I know how it is connected but guess up 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.480
 this was necessary precisely on the basis of this 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:01.990
 that's how they guessed the cadet password 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:06.120
 a phantom but I'm sure that is not all 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:10.140
 Easter eggs and not all riddles even 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:13.180
 There is such a rumor that besides Megalodon 

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:18.180
 battlefield 4 is present or will be 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:22.980
 attend the so-called crater it 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:25.860
 such a big monster in the seas that 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:30.240
 destroyed the ships a hint of it became 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:32.800
 profile of one of the new workers up from 

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.250
 if we see here we will see 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:38.830
 of the very kraken who destroys 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.780
 the ship is far from over and on 

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:44.820
 there is still a lot to do 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:47.200
 I guess I'm sure we will do it 

00:04:44.820 --> 00:04:51.010
 this all turned out enough 

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:53.020

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.760
 but recently when the supplement just came out 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.960

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:18.380
