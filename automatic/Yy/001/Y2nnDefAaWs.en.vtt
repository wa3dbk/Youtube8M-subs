00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.870
 how 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.900
 the last years it has been improved 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.470
 very much has been improved a lot but 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.870
 but if it is missing here there are a touch 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.300
 huge traffic 

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:23.010
 what I do see is that they are going to continue 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.310
 building will be more lines of 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:29.160
 transport on the rail with what they carry 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.680
 here the electric train and surely they go 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.420
 to see more lines of the bus system 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.010
 what is there that there is not a transport 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.950
 regional and there's still no transport 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.390
 regional to leave lima and neither 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.380
 to connect the other cities that 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.380
 has Peru 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.060
 in an investment opportunity connect 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.100
 the other cities 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:56.040
 of the motor of Lima that have a 

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:59.760
 small transport that links the region 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.060
 with the different capitals of the 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.060
 other departments 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.060
 the experience is not only European 

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:09.970
 it is an experience that is applying to 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.140
 everyone in both buses and what 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.580
 have done here in Latin America in 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.580
 many cities or in venice 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.750
 which can be applied here 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.750
 well first of all you can 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:29.090
 the idea that is no longer old of the 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:31.130
 projects or partially public and 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.369
 private apps 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.590
 how to finance a project of that 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:39.260
 size as what is a project of 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.990
 transport system 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:46.090
 to see what the feasibility problem is 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:46.090
 of the project if local information is missing 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.400
 the industry does not show much interest 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.460
 to compete when they go out to tender 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.480
 everything can be applied in compliance 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:02.050
 schedules a project that has a 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:05.110
 company that operates the project 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.120
 meets schedules for road safety and 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.120
 social and also civil 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.040
 It seems excellent in social networks and in 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:17.560
 the presentations that we had the 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.209
 opportunity to listen and see the 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:22.540
 projects that are advancing in Peru 

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:23.980
 the amount of innovation that comes here 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.870
 in Peru 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.379
 besides the credibility that he acquired 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:33.220
 Peru at the international level because it gives 

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:36.340
 a way of thinking that if they are going to 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:40.840
 achieve many projects in the economy 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:43.260
 of Peru has shown that continuously 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.590
 has grown is growing 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:51.209
 the political situation of the peru of the 

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:54.360
 last 10 12 years has been very favorable 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.640
 to the legal security that was 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:03:01.099
 offering Peru also gives credibility 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.099
 to finance large projects 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:08.739
 there are Peruvian companies that if they want 

00:03:05.049 --> 00:03:10.769
 export now that tariffs go down or 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.469
 that the rations of europe disappear 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.760
 let's study in the possibility of 

00:03:13.469 --> 00:03:21.430
 Represent Peruvian companies for 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.390
 different services or products that it 

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:24.500
 we have talked here at the wheel of 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.700
 business 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.040
 as well 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:31.700
 we are studying the possibility of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:34.390
 invest in Peru 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.610
 in energy 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:42.110
 more than all renewable energies 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:45.270
 then according to what we have 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.570
 planned the next 23 months 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.860
 We decided and we returned to Peru and 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.860
 we started doing something
