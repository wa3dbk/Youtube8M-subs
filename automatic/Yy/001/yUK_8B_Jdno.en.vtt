the<00:02:18.430> flight<00:02:18.610> case<00:02:18.819> with<00:02:18.970> all<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.120> controls<00:02:19.510> in

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
the flight case with all the controls in

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.869 
the flight case with all the controls in
if<00:02:20.920> you<00:02:21.040> look<00:02:21.129> up<00:02:21.280> here<00:02:21.310> we've<00:02:21.549> got<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:21.869 --> 00:02:21.879 
if you look up here we've got the

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:24.240 
if you look up here we've got the
scanner<00:02:22.870> then<00:02:23.379> we've<00:02:23.500> got<00:02:23.530> a<00:02:23.620> napkin<00:02:23.769> ox<00:02:24.010> plays

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
scanner then we've got a napkin ox plays

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.280 
scanner then we've got a napkin ox plays
there<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:24.849> equinix<00:02:25.569> blaze<00:02:25.840> there<00:02:26.109> and

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
there and equinix blaze there and

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.390 
there and equinix blaze there and
obviously<00:02:26.859> the<00:02:27.279> trust<00:02:28.150> is<00:02:28.359> what<00:02:29.019> it's<00:02:29.170> on<00:02:29.400> so

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
obviously the trust is what it's on so

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.470 
obviously the trust is what it's on so
let's<00:02:30.909> take<00:02:31.090> a<00:02:31.120> look<00:02:31.299> at

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
let's take a look at

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.520 
let's take a look at
working<00:02:32.040> and<00:02:33.040> here<00:02:33.790> we<00:02:33.879> have<00:02:33.909> it<00:02:34.409> it's<00:02:35.409> not

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
working and here we have it it's not

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.199 
working and here we have it it's not
very<00:02:35.590> doesn't<00:02:36.430> look<00:02:36.580> very<00:02:36.610> good<00:02:36.819> on<00:02:36.970> the

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
very doesn't look very good on the

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.509 
very doesn't look very good on the
camera<00:02:37.659> but<00:02:37.840> it<00:02:38.140> does<00:02:38.379> in<00:02:38.650> real<00:02:38.709> life<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:39.280> as<00:02:39.400> I

00:02:39.509 --> 00:02:39.519 
camera but it does in real life and as I

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.070 
camera but it does in real life and as I
said<00:02:39.849> before<00:02:39.909> usually<00:02:40.330> like<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.599> red<00:02:40.810> there

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
said before usually like a red there

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.289 
said before usually like a red there
blue<00:02:41.709> there<00:02:41.920> a<00:02:41.950> nice<00:02:42.220> mix<00:02:42.459> purple<00:02:42.940> on<00:02:43.090> the<00:02:43.120> same

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:43.299 
blue there a nice mix purple on the same

blue there a nice mix purple on the same
rather<00:02:43.480> side<00:02:43.690> in<00:02:44.260> the<00:02:44.409> middle<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.860> gone

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
rather side in the middle of just gone

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:46.050 
rather side in the middle of just gone
for<00:02:45.069> a<00:02:45.129> completely<00:02:45.430> different<00:02:45.640> color<00:02:45.790> and

I've<00:02:46.120> gone<00:02:46.269> for<00:02:46.450> a<00:02:46.480> green<00:02:46.750> just<00:02:47.140> to<00:02:47.200> break<00:02:47.409> up<00:02:47.590> a

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:47.650 
I've gone for a green just to break up a

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.729 
I've gone for a green just to break up a
bit<00:02:47.830> which<00:02:48.730> also<00:02:49.080> shines<00:02:50.080> onto<00:02:50.319> the<00:02:50.440> roof<00:02:50.560> a

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:50.739 
bit which also shines onto the roof a

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.229 
bit which also shines onto the roof a
bit<00:02:50.890> which<00:02:51.069> you<00:02:51.190> can't<00:02:51.400> really<00:02:51.519> see<00:02:51.640> but<00:02:52.060> if<00:02:52.180> i

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
bit which you can't really see but if i

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.410 
bit which you can't really see but if i
move<00:02:52.390> the<00:02:53.340> see<00:02:54.340> you've<00:02:54.489> got<00:02:54.640> this<00:02:54.790> like<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.180> load

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:55.420 
move the see you've got this like a load

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:56.910 
move the see you've got this like a load
of<00:02:55.450> colors<00:02:55.959> there<00:02:56.140> which<00:02:56.260> is<00:02:56.290> quite<00:02:56.530> nice<00:02:56.680> as

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
of colors there which is quite nice as

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.729 
of colors there which is quite nice as
well<00:02:57.360> on<00:02:58.360> the<00:02:58.510> back<00:02:58.720> i<00:02:59.049> haven't<00:02:59.470> put<00:02:59.560> any<00:02:59.650> of

00:02:59.729 --> 00:02:59.739 
well on the back i haven't put any of

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.170 
well on the back i haven't put any of
those<00:02:59.799> lights<00:03:00.069> on<00:03:00.280> quite<00:03:00.579> simply<00:03:00.730> cuz<00:03:00.970> i<00:03:01.000> never

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
those lights on quite simply cuz i never

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.360 
those lights on quite simply cuz i never
plug<00:03:01.360> them<00:03:01.540> in<00:03:01.950> but<00:03:02.950> let's<00:03:03.069> go<00:03:03.159> and<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.340> a

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 
plug them in but let's go and have a

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:05.759 
plug them in but let's go and have a
look<00:03:03.430> at<00:03:03.610> the<00:03:03.700> controls<00:03:04.470> this<00:03:05.470> is<00:03:05.560> what<00:03:05.709> it

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
look at the controls this is what it

00:03:05.769 --> 00:03:07.500 
look at the controls this is what it
looks<00:03:05.890> like<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> flight<00:03:06.549> case<00:03:06.760> up<00:03:07.450> here

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
looks like in the flight case up here

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.300 
looks like in the flight case up here
we've<00:03:07.959> got<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.530> LED<00:03:09.489> for<00:03:10.109> bulbs<00:03:11.109> which<00:03:11.799> are<00:03:12.069> on

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:12.310 
we've got the LED for bulbs which are on

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.059 
we've got the LED for bulbs which are on
that<00:03:12.489> side<00:03:12.549> and<00:03:13.109> that<00:03:14.109> switch<00:03:14.410> there<00:03:14.680> is<00:03:14.859> for

00:03:15.059 --> 00:03:15.069 
that side and that switch there is for

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:17.160 
that side and that switch there is for
the<00:03:15.129> four<00:03:15.280> box<00:03:15.489> or<00:03:15.640> on<00:03:15.730> that<00:03:15.879> side<00:03:16.060> this<00:03:16.959> switch

the four box or on that side this switch

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.589 
the four box or on that side this switch
here<00:03:17.470> is<00:03:17.650> to<00:03:18.099> power<00:03:18.310> the<00:03:18.730> DMX<00:03:19.180> controller

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:19.599 
here is to power the DMX controller

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:21.690 
here is to power the DMX controller
which<00:03:19.750> is<00:03:19.900> here<00:03:20.170> if<00:03:20.500> I<00:03:20.980> go<00:03:21.099> into<00:03:21.250> the<00:03:21.400> box<00:03:21.549> 10

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:21.700 
which is here if I go into the box 10

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:30.660 
which is here if I go into the box 10
min<00:03:21.849> it<00:03:28.200> slowly<00:03:29.200> better<00:03:29.349> yeah<00:03:29.530> in<00:03:30.250> the<00:03:30.400> middle

we<00:03:30.870> have<00:03:31.870> the<00:03:34.620> parking<00:03:35.620> switch<00:03:36.609> unit<00:03:37.030> if<00:03:37.840> I

00:03:38.039 --> 00:03:38.049 
we have the parking switch unit if I

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:39.659 
we have the parking switch unit if I
flip<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.470> switch<00:03:38.590> there<00:03:38.980> you<00:03:39.370> can<00:03:39.489> see<00:03:39.519> the

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:39.669 
flip that switch there you can see the

00:03:39.669 --> 00:03:42.330 
flip that switch there you can see the
start<00:03:39.940> chasing<00:03:40.180> between<00:03:40.569> each<00:03:40.660> other<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:42.220> can

start chasing between each other you can

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.039 
start chasing between each other you can

here on the DMX controller I've got the

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:59.030 
here on the DMX controller I've got the
light<00:03:57.459> setup<00:03:57.849> on<00:03:58.000> to<00:03:58.180> China<00:03:58.510> one<00:03:58.720> and

obviously if I put that up then down on
the<00:04:03.940> floor<00:04:04.090> scanners<00:04:04.419> to<00:04:04.450> change<00:04:04.780> to<00:04:04.989> a

00:04:05.039 --> 00:04:05.049 
the floor scanners to change to a

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:06.870 
the floor scanners to change to a
different<00:04:05.079> color<00:04:05.470> I've<00:04:06.010> got<00:04:06.160> preset<00:04:06.579> colors

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
different color I've got preset colors

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:10.199 
different color I've got preset colors
on<00:04:07.000> these<00:04:07.209> up<00:04:07.959> to<00:04:08.019> five<00:04:08.650> and<00:04:09.040> then<00:04:09.099> on<00:04:09.940> eight

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:10.209 
on these up to five and then on eight

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:12.479 
on these up to five and then on eight
it's<00:04:10.660> like<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.900> flash<00:04:11.560> patter<00:04:11.980> between<00:04:12.340> them

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
it's like a flash patter between them

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.059 
it's like a flash patter between them
and<00:04:12.639> on<00:04:13.209> seven<00:04:13.630> it's<00:04:13.840> a<00:04:13.870> nice<00:04:14.049> smooth<00:04:14.859> color
