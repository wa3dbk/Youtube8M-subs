00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.580 

so<00:02:13.600> looks<00:02:13.900> like<00:02:14.020> the<00:02:14.440> lead<00:02:15.310> pencil<00:02:15.790> works

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
so looks like the lead pencil works

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.930 
so looks like the lead pencil works
glucose<00:02:17.590> it<00:02:17.980> didn't<00:02:18.250> break<00:02:18.460> when<00:02:18.700> I<00:02:18.760> was

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
glucose it didn't break when I was

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.850 
glucose it didn't break when I was
writing<00:02:19.180> or<00:02:19.480> anything<00:02:19.810> and<00:02:20.020> it's<00:02:20.170> point<00:02:20.500> seven

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
writing or anything and it's point seven

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.670 
writing or anything and it's point seven
lead<00:02:21.070> so<00:02:21.700> that's<00:02:22.330> good<00:02:22.570> because<00:02:22.750> it's<00:02:23.440> thicker

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
lead so that's good because it's thicker

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:26.970 
lead so that's good because it's thicker
then<00:02:24.190> 05<00:02:24.700> there's<00:02:25.180> our<00:02:25.480> little<00:02:25.510> design<00:02:26.170> let's

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
then 05 there's our little design let's

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.140 
then 05 there's our little design let's
use<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:28.240> donut<00:02:28.750> from<00:02:29.230> tim<00:02:29.500> hortons<00:02:30.160> and<00:02:30.700> let's

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
use the donut from tim hortons and let's

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.620 
use the donut from tim hortons and let's
erase<00:02:31.570> let's<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:31.989> if<00:02:32.050> it's<00:02:32.230> any<00:02:32.320> good

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:33.630 
erase let's see if it's any good

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:37.350 
erase let's see if it's any good
conclusion<00:02:35.070> yeah<00:02:36.070> it's<00:02:36.430> pretty<00:02:36.640> decent<00:02:37.239> i

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:37.360 
conclusion yeah it's pretty decent i

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.860 
conclusion yeah it's pretty decent i
guess<00:02:37.390> yep<00:02:38.050> let's<00:02:38.320> try<00:02:38.530> erasing<00:02:39.280> my<00:02:39.580> love<00:02:39.790> okay

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.220 

pretty<00:02:43.870> decent<00:02:44.400> yeah<00:02:45.400> yeah<00:02:46.000> that<00:02:46.600> is<00:02:46.900> the<00:02:46.930> end

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:47.230 
pretty decent yeah yeah that is the end

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.160 
pretty decent yeah yeah that is the end
of<00:02:47.440> my<00:02:47.500> short<00:02:48.130> meeting<00:02:48.850> hall<00:02:49.150> see<00:02:49.900> you<00:02:49.989> next
