00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
here like part of the village is

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.470 
here like part of the village is
actually<00:00:58.770> like<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:58.980> snowy<00:00:59.190> part<00:00:59.520> which<00:01:00.449> is

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
actually like the snowy part which is

actually like the snowy part which is
pretty<00:01:00.719> cold<00:01:00.809> I<00:01:00.930> think<00:01:01.079> this<00:01:01.170> is<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.379> first

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.740 
pretty cold I think this is the first
village<00:01:02.100> I've<00:01:02.520> actually<00:01:03.059> seen<00:01:03.359> in<00:01:03.510> my<00:01:03.570> crap

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
snowy parts so this is the first like

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.330 
snowy parts so this is the first like
snowy<00:01:12.930> village<00:01:13.350> I've<00:01:13.500> seen<00:01:13.710> I<00:01:13.830> guess<00:01:14.010> and<00:01:14.310> uh

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
snowy village I've seen I guess and uh

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.070 
snowy village I've seen I guess and uh
there's<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> draw<00:01:15.299> there's<00:01:15.479> all<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.659> carrots

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:16.080 
there's a draw there's all these carrots

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:17.690 
there's a draw there's all these carrots
and<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.259> water<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> actually<00:01:16.860> frozen<00:01:17.369> right

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
and the water is actually frozen right

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.770 
and the water is actually frozen right
here<00:01:17.880> that's<00:01:18.030> pretty<00:01:18.270> that's<00:01:18.509> actually

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
here that's pretty that's actually

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.170 
here that's pretty that's actually
really<00:01:18.960> cool<00:01:19.170> actually<00:01:19.799> like<00:01:20.130> that<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.490> lot<00:01:20.820> and

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
really cool actually like that a lot and

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.380 
really cool actually like that a lot and
I<00:01:22.100> don't<00:01:23.100> know<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> crops<00:01:23.700> grow<00:01:24.060> when<00:01:24.240> there's

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
I don't know do crops grow when there's

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
I don't know do crops grow when there's
like<00:01:24.479> frozen<00:01:24.900> water<00:01:25.110> I<00:01:25.380> don't<00:01:25.560> I<00:01:25.740> don't<00:01:25.950> think

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
like frozen water I don't I don't think

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.109 
like frozen water I don't I don't think
they<00:01:26.220> do<00:01:26.310> it<00:01:26.369> yet<00:01:26.460> because<00:01:26.580> you<00:01:26.880> see<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
they do it yet because you see the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.850 
they do it yet because you see the
waters<00:01:27.479> churning<00:01:27.869> like<00:01:27.900> I<00:01:28.229> mean<00:01:28.619> they're

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:28.860

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
stirring am i starting to like a lose

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.749 
stirring am i starting to like a lose
its<00:01:31.110> moisture<00:01:31.320> it's<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> Hydra<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.640> like

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
its moisture it's the Hydra it's like
