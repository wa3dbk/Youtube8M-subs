00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:07.820 

all<00:00:06.089> right<00:00:06.330> and<00:00:06.750> I<00:00:07.049> will<00:00:07.379> show<00:00:07.589> you<00:00:07.680> a<00:00:07.710> little

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
all right and I will show you a little

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.770 
all right and I will show you a little
bit<00:00:07.980> about<00:00:08.069> how<00:00:08.250> I<00:00:08.280> typically<00:00:08.820> set<00:00:09.030> up<00:00:09.179> games

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:11.780 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.580 

before<00:00:12.780> I<00:00:12.809> actually<00:00:13.019> kind<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.380> show<00:00:13.469> you<00:00:13.559> how

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
before I actually kind of show you how

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.629 
before I actually kind of show you how
the<00:00:13.740> game<00:00:13.950> works

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the game works

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.760 
the game works
so<00:00:15.240> first<00:00:15.450> off<00:00:15.660> you<00:00:15.990> can<00:00:16.109> choose<00:00:16.289> your<00:00:16.470> shape

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
so first off you can choose your shape

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:17.630 
so first off you can choose your shape
of<00:00:16.890> your<00:00:16.920> galaxy

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
of your galaxy

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.200 
of your galaxy
now<00:00:18.480> if<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.289> default<00:00:19.619> is<00:00:19.859> disc<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> so<00:00:21.060> this

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
now if the default is disc and so this

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.960 
now if the default is disc and so this
is<00:00:21.359> pretty<00:00:21.510> much<00:00:21.600> everybody<00:00:22.260> is<00:00:22.410> in<00:00:22.970> mostly

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
is pretty much everybody is in mostly

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.290 
is pretty much everybody is in mostly
the<00:00:24.060> same<00:00:24.330> star<00:00:24.630> system<00:00:25.080> so<00:00:25.920> you<00:00:25.980> have

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:26.300 
the same star system so you have

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.130 
the same star system so you have
constellations<00:00:27.300> which<00:00:27.599> are<00:00:27.750> groups<00:00:28.019> of

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
constellations which are groups of

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.890 
constellations which are groups of
connected<00:00:28.590> stars<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.279> then<00:00:30.150> between<00:00:30.480> each

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
connected stars and then between each

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.389 
connected stars and then between each
constellation<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.679> have<00:00:31.800> a<00:00:31.830> wormhole

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
constellation you have a wormhole

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:34.340 
constellation you have a wormhole
connection<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.149> so<00:00:33.809> you<00:00:33.870> actually<00:00:34.050> have<00:00:34.260> to

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
connection and so you actually have to

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.440 
connection and so you actually have to
research<00:00:34.710> a<00:00:34.890> fairly<00:00:35.610> high<00:00:35.730> level<00:00:35.760> tech<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.329> be

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
research a fairly high level tech to be

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.060 
research a fairly high level tech to be
able<00:00:36.630> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.870> through<00:00:37.290> wormholes<00:00:37.800> and

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
able to get through wormholes and

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.470 
able to get through wormholes and
explore<00:00:38.430> on<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> other<00:00:38.760> side<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.120> them<00:00:39.239> and

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
explore on the other side of them and

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.470 
explore on the other side of them and
with<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.379> disc<00:00:40.710> you<00:00:40.950> actually<00:00:41.250> have<00:00:41.480> fairly

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
with a disc you actually have fairly

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.690 
with a disc you actually have fairly
good<00:00:42.600> odds<00:00:42.809> of<00:00:42.960> having<00:00:43.050> another<00:00:43.500> player<00:00:44.280> in

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
good odds of having another player in

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.459 
good odds of having another player in
your<00:00:45.030> own<00:00:45.239> sector<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.750> a<00:00:45.809> galaxy<00:00:46.200> in<00:00:46.350> your

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
your own sector of a galaxy in your

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.420 
your own sector of a galaxy in your
constellation<00:00:47.960> typically<00:00:48.960> bad<00:00:49.110> because<00:00:49.469> it

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
constellation typically bad because it

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:51.770 
constellation typically bad because it
removes<00:00:50.700> that<00:00:50.760> little<00:00:51.030> bit<00:00:51.120> of<00:00:51.210> startup<00:00:51.600> time

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
removes that little bit of startup time

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.060 
removes that little bit of startup time
where<00:00:51.930> you're<00:00:52.050> really<00:00:52.170> vulnerable<00:00:52.469> and<00:00:52.920> I

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
where you're really vulnerable and I

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.270 
where you're really vulnerable and I
typically<00:00:53.520> play<00:00:53.850> with<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:55.010> economic<00:00:56.010> build

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
typically play with a economic build

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.950 
typically play with a economic build
it's<00:00:56.610> kind<00:00:56.789> of<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.090> where<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.360> don't

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
it's kind of a thing where I don't

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.869 
it's kind of a thing where I don't
really<00:00:58.109> have<00:00:58.260> military<00:00:58.620> until<00:00:59.250> I<00:00:59.280> get<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.670> fire

00:00:59.869 --> 00:00:59.879 
really have military until I get to fire

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:01.099 
really have military until I get to fire
in<00:01:00.000> front<00:01:00.090> of<00:01:00.270> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> tech<00:01:00.629> tree<00:01:00.870> that<00:01:01.020> I'll

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
in front of on the tech tree that I'll

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.910 
in front of on the tech tree that I'll
have<00:01:01.260> military<00:01:01.680> dominance<00:01:03.350> discs<00:01:04.350> for<00:01:04.710> will

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
have military dominance discs for will

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
have military dominance discs for will
separate<00:01:05.220> out<00:01:05.250> into<00:01:05.519> for<00:01:05.760> starting<00:01:06.180> regions

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
separate out into for starting regions

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.760 
separate out into for starting regions
so<00:01:06.659> that<00:01:06.689> way<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:07.049> you<00:01:07.140> have<00:01:07.260> a<00:01:07.290> four<00:01:07.530> player

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
so that way if you have a four player

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 
so that way if you have a four player
game<00:01:07.799> it<00:01:08.310> will<00:01:08.520> keep<00:01:08.729> you<00:01:08.850> safe<00:01:09.030> there

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
game it will keep you safe there

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.350 
game it will keep you safe there
I<00:01:09.650> typically<00:01:10.650> will<00:01:11.010> play<00:01:11.280> with<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.729> spiral<00:01:12.000> 8

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
I typically will play with the spiral 8

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.539 
I typically will play with the spiral 8
so<00:01:12.750> there's<00:01:13.380> eight<00:01:13.590> separate<00:01:13.950> starting<00:01:14.340> zones

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
so there's eight separate starting zones

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.429 
so there's eight separate starting zones
on<00:01:14.790> the<00:01:14.820> arms<00:01:15.270> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.479> galaxy<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.080> then

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
on the arms of the galaxy and then

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.990 
on the arms of the galaxy and then
there's<00:01:16.619> a<00:01:16.680> huge<00:01:16.979> cluster<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.520> the<00:01:17.549> center

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
there's a huge cluster in the center

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.789 
there's a huge cluster in the center
that's<00:01:18.450> one<00:01:18.720> galaxy<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.350> has<00:01:19.470> a<00:01:19.500> lot<00:01:19.770> of

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
that's one galaxy that has a lot of

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:24.140 
that's one galaxy that has a lot of
other<00:01:20.040> stars<00:01:21.920> galaxies<00:01:22.920> is<00:01:23.130> huge<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.729> typically

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
other stars galaxies is huge I typically

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.880 
other stars galaxies is huge I typically
go<00:01:24.360> huge<00:01:24.750> just<00:01:24.990> because<00:01:25.229> it's<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.560> fun<00:01:25.740> to

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
go huge just because it's more fun to

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.130 
go huge just because it's more fun to
explore<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:27.600> gives<00:01:27.720> you<00:01:27.780> a<00:01:27.840> lot<00:01:28.020> more

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
explore and it gives you a lot more

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.100 
explore and it gives you a lot more
chance<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.530> other<00:01:28.680> planets<00:01:29.600> eh<00:01:30.600> depends<00:01:31.020> on

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
chance of other planets eh depends on

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
chance of other planets eh depends on
how<00:01:31.259> different<00:01:32.100> Sun<00:01:32.280> types<00:01:32.579> and<00:01:32.759> different

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
how different Sun types and different

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.130 
how different Sun types and different
plant<00:01:33.119> levels<00:01:33.390> I<00:01:33.450> usually<00:01:33.750> leave<00:01:33.869> that<00:01:34.049> alone

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
plant levels I usually leave that alone

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.200 
plant levels I usually leave that alone
and<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:35.250> typically<00:01:35.610> actually<00:01:35.729> go<00:01:35.939> into<00:01:36.090> the

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
and I typically actually go into the

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.420 
and I typically actually go into the
advanced<00:01:36.509> menu<00:01:36.810> change<00:01:37.680> galaxy<00:01:38.040> density<00:01:38.310> to

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
advanced menu change galaxy density to

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.840 
advanced menu change galaxy density to
high<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.909> there's<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.150> large<00:01:39.450> number<00:01:39.540> of<00:01:39.900> stars

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:40.850 
high so there's a large number of stars

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.889 
high so there's a large number of stars
it's<00:01:41.850> a<00:01:41.939> pretty<00:01:42.270> average<00:01:42.540> system<00:01:43.200> balancing

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
it's a pretty average system balancing

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.469 
it's a pretty average system balancing
and<00:01:45.899> so<00:01:46.860> the<00:01:47.369> distribution<00:01:47.670> of<00:01:47.939> solar<00:01:48.060> systems

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
and so the distribution of solar systems

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.960 
and so the distribution of solar systems
for<00:01:48.689> constellation<00:01:49.380> is<00:01:49.530> pretty<00:01:50.220> even<00:01:50.670> but<00:01:50.820> you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
for constellation is pretty even but you

like<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:39.989> actually<00:03:40.110> have<00:03:40.440> a<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.769> chance<00:03:40.920> to<00:03:41.220> play

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:41.370 
like to actually have a a chance to play

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.130 
like to actually have a a chance to play
as<00:03:41.519> my<00:03:41.760> opponents<00:03:42.390> rather<00:03:42.660> than<00:03:42.840> a<00:03:42.930> random

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
as my opponents rather than a random

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.220 
as my opponents rather than a random
non-playing<00:03:43.920> race<00:03:44.790> so<00:03:45.390> I<00:03:45.690> turn<00:03:46.230> that<00:03:46.380> off

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:48.230 
non-playing race so I turn that off

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:56.470 
non-playing race so I turn that off
oh<00:03:49.900> and<00:03:50.900> there's<00:03:51.170> the<00:03:51.319> multiplayer<00:03:55.480> for

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
oh and there's the multiplayer for

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.210 
oh and there's the multiplayer for
battle<00:03:56.900> timer<00:03:57.110> in<00:03:57.290> multiplayer<00:03:57.739> that<00:03:58.010> one<00:03:58.190> I

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
battle timer in multiplayer that one I

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.830 
battle timer in multiplayer that one I
need<00:03:58.370> to<00:03:58.430> get<00:03:58.549> rid<00:03:58.700> of<00:03:58.819> them<00:03:59.150> so<00:03:59.599> what<00:03:59.750> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
need to get rid of them so what this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.570 
need to get rid of them so what this
generally<00:04:00.260> does<00:04:00.590> is<00:04:01.090> if<00:04:02.090> you<00:04:02.569> fight<00:04:02.959> somebody

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:03.580 
generally does is if you fight somebody

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.880 
generally does is if you fight somebody
it<00:04:04.580> will<00:04:04.849> count<00:04:05.000> down<00:04:05.150> on<00:04:05.450> a<00:04:05.480> timer<00:04:05.780> and<00:04:06.170> so<00:04:06.739> if

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
it will count down on a timer and so if

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.259 
it will count down on a timer and so if
you're<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.099> a<00:04:07.160> menu<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.700> a<00:04:07.730> computer<00:04:08.060> player

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:08.269 
you're in a menu and a computer player

00:04:08.269 --> 00:04:10.690 
you're in a menu and a computer player
attacks<00:04:08.840> you<00:04:09.170> and<00:04:09.410> you<00:04:10.099> don't<00:04:10.190> realize<00:04:10.459> it

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:10.700 
attacks you and you don't realize it

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:12.520 
attacks you and you don't realize it
they'll<00:04:11.629> start<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.019> battle<00:04:12.170> and<00:04:12.319> you<00:04:12.379> won't

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:12.530 
they'll start the battle and you won't

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:14.050 
they'll start the battle and you won't
actually<00:04:12.620> get<00:04:12.860> to<00:04:12.980> set<00:04:13.190> your<00:04:13.340> strategy<00:04:13.819> for

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
actually get to set your strategy for

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:16.180 
actually get to set your strategy for
that<00:04:14.209> battle<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:14.720> I'm<00:04:14.810> removing<00:04:15.049> that<00:04:15.410> they

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
that battle so I'm removing that they

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.740 
that battle so I'm removing that they
also<00:04:16.340> typically<00:04:16.639> take<00:04:16.850> the<00:04:16.940> economic<00:04:17.570> victory

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:17.750 
also typically take the economic victory

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.460 
also typically take the economic victory
off<00:04:19.209> so<00:04:20.209> as<00:04:20.299> far<00:04:20.419> as<00:04:20.479> victory<00:04:20.840> conditions<00:04:21.289> you

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
off so as far as victory conditions you

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.170 
off so as far as victory conditions you
can<00:04:21.590> either<00:04:21.709> win<00:04:22.100> by<00:04:22.340> having<00:04:22.370> a<00:04:22.639> huge<00:04:22.880> score

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:23.180 
can either win by having a huge score

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:27.189 
can either win by having a huge score
take<00:04:24.050> over<00:04:24.320> everyone's<00:04:24.740> home<00:04:25.010> planet<00:04:26.199> take

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:27.199 
take over everyone's home planet take

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.650 
take over everyone's home planet take
over<00:04:27.560> or<00:04:27.949> build<00:04:28.220> five<00:04:28.550> wonders<00:04:29.150> which<00:04:29.510> are

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
over or build five wonders which are

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.090 
over or build five wonders which are
very<00:04:29.900> late<00:04:30.110> on<00:04:30.139> limb<00:04:30.350> detect<00:04:30.650> trees

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
very late on limb detect trees

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.430 
very late on limb detect trees
research<00:04:31.820> the<00:04:32.060> last<00:04:32.300> scientific<00:04:33.080> advance

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:33.440 
research the last scientific advance

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.860 
research the last scientific advance
which<00:04:34.100> takes<00:04:34.490> I<00:04:34.880> think<00:04:35.150> it<00:04:35.240> starts<00:04:35.510> off<00:04:35.690> at

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:35.870 
which takes I think it starts off at

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:40.360 
which takes I think it starts off at
like<00:04:36.970> two<00:04:37.970> hundred<00:04:38.360> thousand<00:04:39.199> turns<00:04:39.500> but<00:04:40.010> more

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
like two hundred thousand turns but more

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:41.920 
like two hundred thousand turns but more
you<00:04:40.550> build<00:04:41.060> science<00:04:41.330> and<00:04:41.570> the<00:04:41.630> more<00:04:41.750> other

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
you build science and the more other

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.439 
you build science and the more other
research<00:04:42.289> you<00:04:42.560> have<00:04:42.650> it<00:04:42.830> reduces<00:04:43.100> it<00:04:43.449> you

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:44.449 
research you have it reduces it you

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:45.969 
research you have it reduces it you
could<00:04:44.570> have<00:04:44.690> really<00:04:45.050> really<00:04:45.410> good<00:04:45.530> economic

00:04:45.969 --> 00:04:45.979 
could have really really good economic

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:48.520 
could have really really good economic
relations<00:04:46.490> with<00:04:46.639> everybody<00:04:47.030> and<00:04:48.020> so<00:04:48.289> since

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:48.530 
relations with everybody and so since

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:50.050 
relations with everybody and so since
everybody<00:04:48.889> likes<00:04:49.070> you<00:04:49.310> you're<00:04:49.729> not<00:04:49.910> gonna

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
everybody likes you you're not gonna

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.219 
everybody likes you you're not gonna
lose<00:04:50.300> and<00:04:50.600> so<00:04:50.720> it<00:04:50.810> gives<00:04:50.960> you<00:04:51.050> the<00:04:51.139> victory

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:51.229 
lose and so it gives you the victory

00:04:51.229 --> 00:04:53.980 
lose and so it gives you the victory
there<00:04:51.940> economic<00:04:52.940> victory<00:04:53.060> I'd<00:04:53.270> turn<00:04:53.479> off<00:04:53.720> is

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
there economic victory I'd turn off is

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:55.180 
there economic victory I'd turn off is
because<00:04:54.110> if<00:04:54.349> you<00:04:54.440> generate<00:04:54.770> a<00:04:54.800> certain<00:04:55.039> amount

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
because if you generate a certain amount

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.159 
because if you generate a certain amount
of<00:04:55.280> dust<00:04:55.550> and<00:04:55.970> later<00:04:56.810> in<00:04:56.930> the<00:04:56.990> game<00:04:57.110> you

00:04:57.159 --> 00:04:57.169 
of dust and later in the game you

00:04:57.169 --> 00:04:58.870 
of dust and later in the game you
generate<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:57.770> large<00:04:58.130> amount<00:04:58.430> of<00:04:58.460> dust<00:04:58.610> you'll

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:58.880 
generate on large amount of dust you'll

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.580 
generate on large amount of dust you'll
end<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.180> game<00:04:59.360> prematurely<00:04:59.990> and<00:05:00.320> it's<00:05:00.440> kind

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:00.590 
end the game prematurely and it's kind

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.490 
end the game prematurely and it's kind
of<00:05:00.620> an<00:05:00.740> unsatisfying<00:05:01.490> victory<00:05:02.030> or<00:05:02.450> you<00:05:03.320> can

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:03.500 
of an unsatisfying victory or you can

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:05.710 
of an unsatisfying victory or you can
live<00:05:03.710> in<00:05:03.919> 75<00:05:04.520> percent<00:05:04.880> of<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.150> systems<00:05:05.510> in<00:05:05.690> the

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
live in 75 percent of the systems in the

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.920 
live in 75 percent of the systems in the
galaxy<00:05:07.090> this<00:05:08.090> one's<00:05:08.270> really<00:05:08.419> hard<00:05:08.539> with

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:08.930 
galaxy this one's really hard with

00:05:08.930 --> 00:05:10.480 
galaxy this one's really hard with
expansion<00:05:09.260> disapproval<00:05:10.039> so<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.310> have<00:05:10.400> to

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:10.490 
expansion disapproval so you have to

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.480 
expansion disapproval so you have to
have<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> really<00:05:11.030> really<00:05:11.620> satisfied<00:05:12.620> race<00:05:13.190> in

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:13.490 
have a really really satisfied race in

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.850 
have a really really satisfied race in
order<00:05:13.610> to<00:05:13.729> achieve<00:05:14.060> that<00:05:14.330> one

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:17.860 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:19.530 

and<00:05:18.430> then<00:05:18.550> I<00:05:18.580> start<00:05:18.820> a<00:05:18.850> multiplayer<00:05:18.970> game<00:05:19.270> you

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:19.540 
and then I start a multiplayer game you

00:05:19.540 --> 00:05:21.090 
and then I start a multiplayer game you
just<00:05:19.570> choose<00:05:19.930> public<00:05:20.380> or<00:05:20.530> private<00:05:20.620> multi

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:21.100 
just choose public or private multi

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:22.560 
just choose public or private multi
player<00:05:21.340> and<00:05:21.550> it<00:05:21.730> works<00:05:21.910> well<00:05:22.150> with<00:05:22.180> Steam

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:22.570
