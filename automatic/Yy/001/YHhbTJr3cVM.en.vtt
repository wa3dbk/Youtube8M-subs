00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250 
had to put on the fuel pumps because I

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.150 
had to put on the fuel pumps because I
know<00:04:18.250> Jetta<00:04:18.520> you<00:04:19.360> got<00:04:19.510> a<00:04:19.540> prime<00:04:19.840> you're<00:04:20.160> in

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
know Jetta you got a prime you're in

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.550 
know Jetta you got a prime you're in
tank<00:04:21.520> fuel<00:04:21.730> pump<00:04:22.090> I<00:04:22.330> believe<00:04:22.630> it<00:04:22.720> is<00:04:22.870> and<00:04:23.080> then

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
tank fuel pump I believe it is and then

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.010 
tank fuel pump I believe it is and then
you<00:04:23.680> gotta<00:04:23.860> prime<00:04:24.130> your<00:04:24.400> auxiliary<00:04:25.300> fuel<00:04:25.780> pump

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:26.020 
you gotta prime your auxiliary fuel pump

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.230 
you gotta prime your auxiliary fuel pump
afterwards<00:04:26.500> both<00:04:27.220> three<00:04:27.490> times<00:04:27.730> each<00:04:27.940> three

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:28.240 
afterwards both three times each three

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.790 
afterwards both three times each three
or<00:04:28.330> more<00:04:28.450> times<00:04:28.510> each<00:04:28.930> is<00:04:29.110> purged<00:04:29.350> out<00:04:29.530> the<00:04:29.650> air

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:29.800 
or more times each is purged out the air

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.530 
or more times each is purged out the air
because<00:04:30.220> the<00:04:30.460> high<00:04:30.550> pressure<00:04:30.820> fuel<00:04:31.060> pump<00:04:31.150> in

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
because the high pressure fuel pump in

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.780 
because the high pressure fuel pump in
the<00:04:31.870> jetta's<00:04:32.320> do<00:04:32.890> not<00:04:33.070> like<00:04:33.280> running<00:04:33.580> dry

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 
the jetta's do not like running dry

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:35.520 
the jetta's do not like running dry
because<00:04:34.030> the<00:04:34.270> high<00:04:34.360> pressure<00:04:34.630> fuel<00:04:34.840> pump<00:04:34.960> uses

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
because the high pressure fuel pump uses

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.070 
because the high pressure fuel pump uses
the<00:04:35.620> diesel<00:04:35.980> fuel<00:04:36.190> as<00:04:36.370> lube<00:04:36.640> and<00:04:36.970> some<00:04:37.080> people

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.080 
the diesel fuel as lube and some people

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.890 
the diesel fuel as lube and some people
like<00:04:38.260> to<00:04:38.290> add<00:04:38.500> some<00:04:38.830> like<00:04:39.120> two<00:04:40.120> stroke<00:04:40.360> oil<00:04:40.540> or

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
like to add some like two stroke oil or

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:42.720 
like to add some like two stroke oil or
some<00:04:41.530> other<00:04:41.620> kind<00:04:41.800> of<00:04:41.920> loop<00:04:42.100> to<00:04:42.310> it<00:04:42.460> just<00:04:42.640> that

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
some other kind of loop to it just that

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:44.730 
some other kind of loop to it just that
kind<00:04:43.000> of<00:04:43.090> help<00:04:43.360> protect<00:04:43.750> a<00:04:43.840> fuel<00:04:44.050> pump<00:04:44.260> but<00:04:44.530> I
