00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:37.030 
difficulty is the way the developer

difficulty is the way the developer
thinks<00:02:37.360> the<00:02:37.450> game<00:02:37.630> is<00:02:37.810> meant<00:02:38.020> to<00:02:38.140> be<00:02:38.170> played

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:23.790 
there were a couple points in the game
