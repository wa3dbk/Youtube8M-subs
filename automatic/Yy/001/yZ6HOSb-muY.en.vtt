putting the pickup heads out front means

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.750 
putting the pickup heads out front means

you don't drive over your crop this

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.730 
you don't drive over your crop this
translates<00:04:50.450> into<00:04:50.600> better<00:04:50.900> visibility<00:04:51.260> and

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:51.740 
translates into better visibility and

00:04:51.740 --> 00:04:57.340 
translates into better visibility and
more<00:04:51.770> relaxing<00:04:52.730> operation<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:55.220> expo<00:04:56.350> 43:34

00:04:57.340 --> 00:04:57.350 
more relaxing operation the expo 43:34

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.550 
more relaxing operation the expo 43:34
came<00:04:57.620> on<00:04:57.770> the<00:04:57.860> market<00:04:58.310> and<00:04:58.370> we<00:04:58.490> looked<00:04:58.730> at<00:04:58.910> that

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
came on the market and we looked at that

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:05.920 
came on the market and we looked at that
tried<00:05:00.560> it<00:05:00.740> some<00:05:01.010> and<00:05:03.400> we<00:05:04.400> bought<00:05:04.610> one<00:05:04.910> and<00:05:05.330> we

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
tried it some and we bought one and we

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.570 
tried it some and we bought one and we
wouldn't<00:05:06.140> give<00:05:06.290> it<00:05:06.410> up<00:05:06.500> today<00:05:06.710> anymore

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
wouldn't give it up today anymore

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.350 
wouldn't give it up today anymore
so<00:05:08.420> much<00:05:08.600> faster<00:05:08.840> than<00:05:09.170> a<00:05:09.230> pool<00:05:09.470> type<00:05:10.240> you<00:05:11.240> can

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:11.360 
so much faster than a pool type you can

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:13.510 
so much faster than a pool type you can
get<00:05:11.510> in<00:05:11.600> the<00:05:11.690> corners<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:12.800> don't<00:05:12.980> lose<00:05:13.160> no<00:05:13.340> hay

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:13.520 
get in the corners you don't lose no hay

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:15.880 
get in the corners you don't lose no hay
in<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.730> corners<00:05:14.180> and<00:05:14.210> things<00:05:14.480> like<00:05:14.780> that<00:05:14.890> you

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890 
in the corners and things like that you

00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:18.340 
in the corners and things like that you
can<00:05:16.040> see<00:05:16.190> where<00:05:16.370> you're<00:05:16.490> going<00:05:16.670> more<00:05:17.660> relaxing

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:18.350 
can see where you're going more relaxing

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.820 
can see where you're going more relaxing
very<00:05:19.310> smooth<00:05:19.640> you<00:05:20.000> can<00:05:20.720> go<00:05:20.990> get<00:05:21.590> a<00:05:21.650> lot<00:05:21.800> more

did<00:05:41.030> for<00:05:41.510> us<00:05:41.660> was<00:05:42.080> you<00:05:43.010> know<00:05:43.130> our<00:05:43.220> prior<00:05:43.490> merger

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:43.910 
did for us was you know our prior merger

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:46.270 
did for us was you know our prior merger
was<00:05:44.060> a<00:05:44.090> good<00:05:44.330> machine<00:05:44.590> but<00:05:45.590> we<00:05:45.860> had<00:05:45.979> to<00:05:46.100> give<00:05:46.250> a

00:05:46.270 --> 00:05:46.280 
was a good machine but we had to give a

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.040 
was a good machine but we had to give a
guy<00:05:46.460> about<00:05:46.669> a<00:05:46.729> good<00:05:47.000> day's<00:05:47.240> lead<00:05:47.570> and<00:05:47.810> head<00:05:47.900> of

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
guy about a good day's lead and head of

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.730 
guy about a good day's lead and head of
the<00:05:48.110> chopper

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:48.740 
the chopper

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.890 
the chopper
this<00:05:49.400> thing<00:05:49.610> here<00:05:49.910> we<00:05:50.240> need<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.540> give<00:05:50.660> a<00:05:50.690> guy

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:50.900 
this thing here we need to give a guy

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:53.500 
this thing here we need to give a guy
about<00:05:51.110> a<00:05:51.169> ten-minute<00:05:51.650> head<00:05:51.680> start<00:05:51.970> so<00:05:52.970> it<00:05:53.150> it

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
about a ten-minute head start so it it

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.600 
about a ten-minute head start so it it
really<00:05:53.860> reduced<00:05:54.860> the<00:05:55.040> amount<00:05:55.160> of<00:05:55.280> people<00:05:55.430> that

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:55.610 
really reduced the amount of people that

00:05:55.610 --> 00:05:58.659 
really reduced the amount of people that
we<00:05:55.850> needed<00:05:56.090> to<00:05:56.210> perform<00:05:56.810> the<00:05:57.050> chopping<00:05:57.560> and<00:05:57.740> it

00:05:58.659 --> 00:05:58.669 
we needed to perform the chopping and it

00:05:58.669 --> 00:06:02.409 
we needed to perform the chopping and it
it<00:05:59.419> reduced<00:05:59.900> our<00:06:00.110> exposure<00:06:00.530> to<00:06:01.180> bad<00:06:02.180> weather

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:02.419 
it reduced our exposure to bad weather

00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:04.870 
it reduced our exposure to bad weather
inclement<00:06:03.260> weather<00:06:03.560> for<00:06:04.250> us<00:06:04.490> we<00:06:04.760> were

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
inclement weather for us we were

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.570 
inclement weather for us we were
horribly<00:06:05.390> exposed<00:06:05.810> with<00:06:06.530> this<00:06:07.040> particular

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:07.580 
horribly exposed with this particular

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.180 
horribly exposed with this particular
merger<00:06:08.000> I<00:06:08.210> mean<00:06:08.630> all<00:06:09.440> the<00:06:09.590> guys<00:06:09.680> got<00:06:09.950> to<00:06:10.040> do<00:06:10.100> is

00:06:10.180 --> 00:06:10.190 
merger I mean all the guys got to do is

00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:12.450 
merger I mean all the guys got to do is
have<00:06:10.340> a<00:06:10.430> 15<00:06:10.820> minute<00:06:10.850> 10<00:06:11.330> 15<00:06:11.750> minute<00:06:11.960> Head<00:06:12.080> Start

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
have a 15 minute 10 15 minute Head Start

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:15.820 
have a 15 minute 10 15 minute Head Start
so<00:06:13.460> art<00:06:13.760> our<00:06:14.450> exposure<00:06:14.900> to<00:06:15.080> thrown<00:06:15.380> away<00:06:15.500> feed

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:15.830 
so art our exposure to thrown away feed

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:20.050 
so art our exposure to thrown away feed
