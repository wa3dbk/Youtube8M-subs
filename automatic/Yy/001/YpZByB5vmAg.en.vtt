00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 if you could pause for a while now and 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:04.560
 maybe a small pen or a 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.600
 chit takes and then can use the short 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.820

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.530
 I would like that I have answered 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.530

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.859
 Maybe just go through with it 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.260

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:36.930

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:39.600

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.070
 would find important if over again

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.710
 maybe a small pen or a 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.750
 takes notes and then the short 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.030
 write down all questions or what 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.940
 I would like that I answered 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.000
 get from you in the comments 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:03.239
 who would be pretty important to me, first, 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.650
 this new layout is you see what 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:07.799
 ye shall keep it I've thought I 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 problems as a new design one 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:13.590
 little something that can like me here 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.689
 let me have an answer 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.780
 we know what you 're what you know 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:21.630
 think of it as it comes to you 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.310
 the next thing I wanted to say it 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.500
 many have commented that they will 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.600
 an effect that means you stand 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.369
 ask me you are interested 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.520
 there you can have such a little bit 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.079
 Replay video in which I do the 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.150
 questions answered ask a blind 

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:39.900
 or a small block or what knows 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.670
 I just ask myself down in 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.450
 the comments 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:44.759
 what you all want to know her 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.740
 something interesting or something in the 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:51.780
 I sense is going to try his 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:53.850
 answer so and number three would be 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.130
 I used to have such complaints 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.430
 Subscribers made that means you could 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.430
 apply 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:04.049
 yes that I come to you in the complaints 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.909
 and a little war with power and then 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.620
 make video and then put online 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.630
 here on the canal and 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:10.950
 this came relatively early to me 

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:13.470
 I finally let it because it was 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.070
 but a lot of time costs me 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.500
 but come 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:18.030
 now it's just 5,000 subscribers the 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.190
 was really cool that we have to 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.380
 By pulling the series and the man 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:24.540
 to start again 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.820
 so I thought ask you once had 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.410
 he balks at me again 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:30.030
 This series small climate subscribers 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.410
 there it will be extra video 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.540
 give it to how to apply then 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:36.810
 blablabla can because you have to think about how 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.310
 I do that because it's easy 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.410
 meanwhile so many people i like it 

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.120

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.390
 comments and I can it only five 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:47.070
 visit of which offers at the 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.460
 clans is I do not know you have to 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.110
 look 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.510
 I'm thinking of something and there comes 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.350
 extra video so the three questions 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:54.180
 I hope I have diligent 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.680
 co-written and can all now 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:56.640
 Three questions below in the comments 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.290

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:06.390
