to<00:02:29.520> be<00:02:29.610> the<00:02:29.700> left<00:02:29.850> hand<00:02:30.090> now<00:02:30.210> I'm<00:02:30.810> gonna<00:02:31.020> be

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
to be the left hand now I'm gonna be

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.490 
to be the left hand now I'm gonna be
only<00:02:31.290> hitting<00:02:31.530> one<00:02:31.830> key<00:02:32.930> more<00:02:33.930> for<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.350> sake

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
only hitting one key more for the sake

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500 
only hitting one key more for the sake
of<00:02:34.530> simplicity<00:02:34.740> I'll<00:02:35.250> you<00:02:35.460> know<00:02:35.550> my<00:02:35.790> hand

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
of simplicity I'll you know my hand

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.120 
of simplicity I'll you know my hand
might<00:02:36.690> go<00:02:36.930> to<00:02:36.990> the<00:02:37.200> shotty<00:02:37.440> if<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:37.740> use<00:02:37.890> full

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
might go to the shotty if I use full

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.160 
might go to the shotty if I use full
octaves<00:02:38.550> but<00:02:39.300> it<00:02:39.600> really<00:02:39.690> doesn't<00:02:39.930> matter

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.170 
octaves but it really doesn't matter

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:42.080 
octaves but it really doesn't matter
it's<00:02:40.290> the<00:02:40.350> same<00:02:40.590> same<00:02:41.220> thing<00:02:41.460> but<00:02:41.880> when<00:02:42.000> you

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it's the same same thing but when you

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.170 
it's the same same thing but when you
play<00:02:42.270> you<00:02:42.330> can<00:02:42.390> use<00:02:42.690> for<00:02:42.900> octaves<00:02:44.000> all<00:02:45.000> right

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
play you can use for octaves all right

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.990 
play you can use for octaves all right
so<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.710> a<00:02:46.770> recording<00:02:47.310> for<00:02:47.460> the<00:02:47.580> right<00:02:47.730> hand

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
so I have a recording for the right hand

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.060 
so I have a recording for the right hand
and<00:02:48.240> I'm<00:02:48.840> gonna<00:02:48.960> play<00:02:49.230> along<00:02:49.470> with<00:02:49.680> it<00:02:49.740> so

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
and I'm gonna play along with it so

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:53.090 
and I'm gonna play along with it so
you'll<00:02:50.220> know<00:02:50.570> when<00:02:51.570> to<00:02:51.900> hit<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.620> left<00:02:52.830> hand

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:53.100 
you'll know when to hit the left hand

00:02:53.100 --> 00:03:08.950 
you'll know when to hit the left hand
along<00:02:53.640> with<00:02:53.880> the<00:02:54.000> right<00:02:54.120> hand<00:02:54.380> okay

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:29.450 

flat<00:03:18.230> G<00:03:19.230> sharp<00:03:22.160> flat

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.910 

what

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.920 
what

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:50.850 
what
what<00:03:41.900> G<00:03:42.900> sharp<00:03:43.170> a<00:03:45.470> lot<00:03:47.690> see

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.980 

so<00:03:51.860> that's<00:03:52.310> the<00:03:52.400> left<00:03:52.640> hand<00:03:52.940> as<00:03:53.510> you<00:03:53.690> can<00:03:53.840> see

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:53.990 
so that's the left hand as you can see

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:09.120 
so that's the left hand as you can see
like<00:03:54.200> it<00:03:54.290> involves<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.800> parent<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:55.730> like<00:03:56.920> it's

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.130 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.520 

that<00:04:09.910> thing<00:04:10.150> repeats<00:04:10.450> twice<00:04:10.720> basically<00:04:11.470> I

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:11.530 
that thing repeats twice basically I

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:16.470 
that thing repeats twice basically I
mean<00:04:11.710> it's<00:04:12.550> not<00:04:12.670> that<00:04:12.850> difficult<00:04:15.330> there's<00:04:16.330> not

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:16.480 
mean it's not that difficult there's not

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.870 
mean it's not that difficult there's not
much<00:04:16.630> else<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.900> say<00:04:17.170> I<00:04:17.230> mean<00:04:17.620> the<00:04:18.550> right<00:04:18.700> hand

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:18.880 
much else to say I mean the right hand

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.640 
much else to say I mean the right hand
might<00:04:19.030> be<00:04:19.180> a<00:04:19.209> bit<00:04:19.390> confusing<00:04:19.750> at<00:04:19.900> first<00:04:19.930> since

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
might be a bit confusing at first since

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.180 
might be a bit confusing at first since
there's<00:04:20.980> no<00:04:21.100> real<00:04:21.280> pattern<00:04:21.580> to<00:04:22.090> it<00:04:22.590> but<00:04:23.590> with

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:24.190 
there's no real pattern to it but with

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.320 
there's no real pattern to it but with
practice<00:04:24.400> it'll<00:04:24.850> elcome<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:27.040> I'll<00:04:27.940> play<00:04:28.120> once

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
practice it'll elcome so I'll play once

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
practice it'll elcome so I'll play once
more<00:04:28.690> with<00:04:29.290> a<00:04:29.320> different<00:04:29.740> um<00:04:30.330> like<00:04:31.330> tone<00:04:31.690> I'll

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:32.350 
more with a different um like tone I'll

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:33.870 
more with a different um like tone I'll
use<00:04:32.590> strings<00:04:32.920> and<00:04:33.190> then<00:04:33.400> it<00:04:33.550> sounds<00:04:33.730> much

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880
