feeling<00:05:21.949> that<00:05:21.979> the<00:05:22.219> economy<00:05:22.699> is<00:05:22.729> turning<00:05:23.060> and

00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:23.449 
feeling that the economy is turning and

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:26.709 
feeling that the economy is turning and
I<00:05:23.990> think<00:05:24.289> it<00:05:24.409> is<00:05:24.620> I<00:05:24.979> mean<00:05:25.789> I<00:05:25.909> think<00:05:26.210> the<00:05:26.330> figures

00:05:26.709 --> 00:05:26.719 
I think it is I mean I think the figures

00:05:26.719 --> 00:05:28.300 
I think it is I mean I think the figures
are<00:05:27.050> although<00:05:27.379> they're<00:05:27.710> cooked<00:05:28.009> the

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:28.310 
are although they're cooked the

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:29.769 
are although they're cooked the
unemployment<00:05:28.759> figures<00:05:29.060> the<00:05:29.300> inflation

00:05:29.769 --> 00:05:29.779 
unemployment figures the inflation

00:05:29.779 --> 00:05:31.870 
unemployment figures the inflation
figure<00:05:30.020> and<00:05:30.169> the<00:05:30.229> GDP<00:05:30.650> figure<00:05:30.979> of<00:05:31.069> cooked<00:05:31.279> fact

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:31.880 
figure and the GDP figure of cooked fact

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.879 
figure and the GDP figure of cooked fact
is<00:05:32.150> I<00:05:32.180> think<00:05:32.659> people<00:05:32.990> are<00:05:33.080> feeling<00:05:33.289> better

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:33.889 
is I think people are feeling better

00:05:33.889 --> 00:05:36.040 
is I think people are feeling better
but<00:05:34.520> of<00:05:34.669> course<00:05:34.699> the<00:05:35.120> problem<00:05:35.599> is<00:05:35.750> they're

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:36.050 
but of course the problem is they're

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.870 
but of course the problem is they're
feeling<00:05:36.469> better<00:05:36.650> on<00:05:37.009> borrowed<00:05:37.490> money<00:05:37.759> and

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:37.880 
feeling better on borrowed money and

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.809 
feeling better on borrowed money and
printed<00:05:38.449> money<00:05:38.599> and<00:05:38.960> I<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.889> don't<00:05:40.190> see<00:05:40.550> that

00:05:40.809 --> 00:05:40.819 
printed money and I just don't see that

00:05:40.819 --> 00:05:42.730 
printed money and I just don't see that
that<00:05:40.880> sort<00:05:41.300> of<00:05:41.330> a<00:05:41.419> condition<00:05:41.870> can<00:05:42.050> end<00:05:42.259> well

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:42.740 
that sort of a condition can end well

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.980 
that sort of a condition can end well
before<00:05:43.370> I<00:05:43.430> let<00:05:43.639> you<00:05:43.759> go<00:05:44.000> you<00:05:44.419> obviously<00:05:44.810> like

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
before I let you go you obviously like

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.260 
before I let you go you obviously like
gold<00:05:45.319> any<00:05:45.650> other<00:05:45.949> investments<00:05:46.669> that<00:05:46.940> you<00:05:47.060> like

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:47.270 
gold any other investments that you like

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:48.850 
gold any other investments that you like
right<00:05:47.509> now<00:05:47.630> and<00:05:47.840> I<00:05:47.870> think<00:05:47.990> people<00:05:48.440> big

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:48.860 
right now and I think people big

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.800 
right now and I think people big
investors<00:05:49.430> should<00:05:49.669> look<00:05:49.880> to<00:05:50.120> own<00:05:50.389> hold

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
investors should look to own hold

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.409 
investors should look to own hold
companies<00:05:51.319> not<00:05:52.009> just<00:05:52.039> the<00:05:52.550> shares<00:05:52.909> which<00:05:53.210> can

00:05:53.409 --> 00:05:53.419 
companies not just the shares which can

00:05:53.419 --> 00:05:55.420 
companies not just the shares which can
be<00:05:53.539> so<00:05:53.750> influenced<00:05:54.319> by<00:05:54.349> markets<00:05:54.949> and<00:05:55.099> interest

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
be so influenced by markets and interest

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:57.309 
be so influenced by markets and interest
