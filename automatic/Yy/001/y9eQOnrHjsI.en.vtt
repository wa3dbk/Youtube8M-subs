00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:07.910
 guys hello everyone today we'll talk 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:11.910
 about types of fasteners corners furniture corners 

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:14.730
 there are several types of them 1 head 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:17.910
 such from metal 30 to 30 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.890
 with one hole millimeters are 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.269
 exactly the same corners 50 to 50 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:26.220
 millimeters with two holes 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.890
 plastic corners can be different 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.710
 colors 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:37.170
 brown white and gray red black and 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:41.430
 others with such a decorative cap 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:43.290
 after mounting this cap puts on 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:50.010
 such an aesthetic beautiful look is obtained 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:52.739
 and here is such a corner with fu such 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:57.180
 metal reinforced corner here on 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.059
 The photo is attached to the chipboard itself in 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:03.510
 According to this photocall 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:06.960
 screw itself turns very 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:11.640
 and very reliable and here is a self-tapping screw 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:17.360
 ordinary screw screws by the way 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:20.400
 need 16 16 millimeter screws 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.340
 valley they have 16 millimeters they are called 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:27.320
 16 mm bonfire from different 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:32.220
 diameters there are three three and a half 4 45 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.829
 millimeters why 16 because if you 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.030
 take two with a wheelbarrow something she demand 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.299
 will be through 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:42.299
 and here it won't come through and take into account 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:45.720
 tank thickness is still a corner of a millimeter so 

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:49.229
 one and a half millimeters are obtained like this 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:53.869
 here is surely 16 I had a student 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:57.659
 who confused these screws with 20 

00:01:53.869 --> 00:02:03.090
 look like twenty that's not 20 millimeters 

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:05.759
 he fastened the facades I think it's 16 not 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:09.710
 looked and when we turned the item 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:14.600
 they saw a bunch of such cones here 

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:16.460
 and had to redo the whole amount of here 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:19.940
 such is the flaw and here they are 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:21.920
 for a beginner seem at first glance 

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:26.180
 equally they actually have different 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:29.090
 lengths pay attention to this to fasten 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.950
 these corners and in general why do we need these 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.110
 corners 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:38.240
 corner need to hide all 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.910
 so I was on the front for example 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.590
 on the facade or false panels 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:44.810
 mount was not visible we can of course 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.100
 here fasten confirm and there as we are 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.990
 did remember with the previous lessons we 

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.820
 here we can do it in another way 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:56.420
 to not see it 

00:02:52.820 --> 00:03:03.080
 Confirmat of heads we will fasten a corner 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:04.430
 from the inside how we will do it we 

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.700
 determine what this item will be 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:10.600
 invoice that is put here 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:16.670
 align neatly evenly 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:22.940
 set the corner and 16 millimeter 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:24.680
 screw 1 and 2 screw all 2 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:29.600
 the parts are ready well of course there are 2 myself 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.920
 corner need and sit on to them as 

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.730
 minimum need 2 2 corners 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:44.240
 there is a second way 

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:46.220
 when we have a part is pressed, that is 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:48.350
 some facade there is a trim panel to there 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.210
 still something we have here two millimeters 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.890
 roughly speaking it is flush 

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.790
 we don't need her to be like this 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:54.790
 stretched out 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.800
 in fact, this is the same thing that we 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:03.310
 now backed up 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.280
 the only thing you just have to take into account when you 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:09.310
 you will fix the corner 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:11.770
 for example, we decided this one 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:16.330
 the detail will be this corner 

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:19.500
 should not fasten flush and not here 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:23.290
 so a little bit 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.180
 will be right down one millimeter 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:29.260
 long so when the item will be 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.390
 to squeeze it so tightly and we 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.630
 here did not learn 

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:37.870
 keep this in mind necessarily well and 

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:41.170
 like network attached corners just 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:43.980
 but only for this you need 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:48.130
 drill a hole in the futorku 

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:50.830
 screw with us once inserted and 

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:54.240
 we twist a boar with a self-tapping screw that is 

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:56.890
 all elementary just guys all 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:57.430
 subscribe to the channel for this lesson 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:05:00.970
 completed 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:03.030
 the next lesson will be about eccentric 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:03.030
 screeds
