00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
continuing my outdoor tests right now

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:53.729 
continuing my outdoor tests right now
and<00:02:50.019> I<00:02:51.450> just<00:02:52.450> played<00:02:52.840> back<00:02:53.019> the<00:02:53.049> video<00:02:53.260> and<00:02:53.620> I

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:53.739 
and I just played back the video and I

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:56.309 
and I just played back the video and I
had<00:02:53.920> the<00:02:54.040> wind<00:02:54.280> cut<00:02:54.610> feature<00:02:54.940> on<00:02:55.269> and<00:02:55.600> when

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:56.319 
had the wind cut feature on and when

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:59.400 
had the wind cut feature on and when
listening<00:02:56.530> back<00:02:56.890> to<00:02:57.160> it<00:02:57.989> all<00:02:58.989> that's<00:02:59.200> doing

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
listening back to it all that's doing

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.949 
listening back to it all that's doing
basically<00:02:59.920> is<00:03:00.040> cutting<00:03:00.489> all<00:03:01.060> the<00:03:01.239> low<00:03:01.450> end<00:03:01.690> of

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
basically is cutting all the low end of

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:05.400 
basically is cutting all the low end of
what<00:03:02.560> the<00:03:02.680> mic<00:03:02.860> is<00:03:02.890> receiving<00:03:04.260> meaning<00:03:05.260> when

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:05.410 
what the mic is receiving meaning when

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.440 
what the mic is receiving meaning when
you're<00:03:05.560> listening<00:03:06.160> back<00:03:06.549> to<00:03:06.790> it<00:03:06.940> it<00:03:07.090> sounds

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
you're listening back to it it sounds

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.880 
you're listening back to it it sounds
very<00:03:07.600> very<00:03:07.930> hollow<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:08.799> tinny<00:03:09.609> so<00:03:10.510> I<00:03:10.780> have<00:03:11.739> it

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:11.890 
very very hollow and tinny so I have it

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.590 
very very hollow and tinny so I have it
back<00:03:11.920> on<00:03:12.220> intelligent<00:03:12.730> auto<00:03:12.880> right<00:03:13.150> now<00:03:13.329> and

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:13.600 
back on intelligent auto right now and

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.229 
back on intelligent auto right now and
we're<00:03:14.380> basically<00:03:14.680> just<00:03:14.829> going<00:03:15.790> to<00:03:15.850> keep<00:03:15.970> the

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
we're basically just going to keep the

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.900 
we're basically just going to keep the
the<00:03:16.420> wind<00:03:16.900> filter<00:03:17.200> off<00:03:17.530> that<00:03:18.489> way<00:03:18.609> we<00:03:18.790> get

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
the wind filter off that way we get

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:20.550 
the wind filter off that way we get
better<00:03:19.090> bass<00:03:19.390> response<00:03:19.570> from<00:03:19.959> my<00:03:20.019> voice<00:03:20.260> and

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
better bass response from my voice and

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.880 
better bass response from my voice and
also<00:03:21.280> what's<00:03:21.430> going<00:03:21.609> on<00:03:21.700> outside<00:03:21.850> here<00:03:22.209> but

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
also what's going on outside here but

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.190 
also what's going on outside here but
the<00:03:23.890> wind<00:03:24.100> filter<00:03:24.280> once<00:03:24.790> again<00:03:25.000> is<00:03:25.150> not<00:03:25.269> on<00:03:25.480> the

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
the wind filter once again is not on the

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:28.500 
the wind filter once again is not on the
wind<00:03:26.410> cut<00:03:26.590> feature<00:03:26.799> rather<00:03:27.299> so<00:03:28.299> you're

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
wind cut feature rather so you're

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.930 
wind cut feature rather so you're
definitely<00:03:28.630> to<00:03:28.900> hear<00:03:29.049> that<00:03:29.700> type<00:03:30.700> of<00:03:30.730> noise

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
definitely to hear that type of noise

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.550 
definitely to hear that type of noise
what<00:03:31.690> I'm<00:03:31.780> going<00:03:31.900> to<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.109> just<00:03:32.140> go<00:03:32.380> out<00:03:32.470> on

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:32.560 
what I'm going to do is just go out on

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.340 
what I'm going to do is just go out on
the<00:03:32.650> field<00:03:32.680> here<00:03:33.100> and<00:03:33.840> get<00:03:34.840> some<00:03:34.870> other<00:03:35.079> shots

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:35.350 
the field here and get some other shots

00:03:35.350 --> 00:05:42.260 
the field here and get some other shots
so<00:03:35.560> I'll<00:03:35.709> be<00:03:35.799> right<00:03:35.920> back

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:42.270 

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.360 

I<00:05:42.360> guess<00:05:42.900> that<00:05:42.930> concludes<00:05:43.320> the<00:05:43.650> tests<00:05:44.070> for

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.370 
I guess that concludes the tests for

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:49.700 
I guess that concludes the tests for
this<00:05:45.080> I'm<00:05:46.080> loving<00:05:46.470> this<00:05:46.530> camera<00:05:48.290> the<00:05:49.290> quality
