first test of fraps then new lasers
we've<00:00:08.790> got<00:00:12.080> on<00:00:13.080> to<00:00:13.620> three<00:00:14.130> turreted<00:00:14.670> lasers

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:15.350 
we've got on to three turreted lasers

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:23.290 
we've got on to three turreted lasers
each<00:00:16.350> worth<00:00:16.920> about<00:00:19.609> half<00:00:20.750> a<00:00:21.750> million<00:00:21.930> I<00:00:22.230> think

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
each worth about half a million I think

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.939

plenty<00:00:24.300> of<00:00:24.359> power<00:00:24.510> left<00:00:27.410> fourth<00:00:28.410> laser<00:00:29.929> just

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:30.949 
plenty of power left fourth laser just

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:38.119 
plenty of power left fourth laser just
standard<00:00:34.910> gimballed<00:00:35.910> later<00:00:36.540> so<00:00:37.290> I<00:00:37.320> can<00:00:37.410> target

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:51.049 
for dropping by on the comms there yeah

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:59.490 
for dropping by on the comms there yeah
he's<00:01:51.200> not<00:01:51.409> friendly<00:01:51.709> is<00:01:51.920> he<00:01:54.429> neither<00:01:55.429> are<00:01:55.670> we

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:16.930 

article<00:02:00.500> those<00:02:00.710> turrets<00:02:01.250> oh<00:02:01.490> my<00:02:02.180> god

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:29.370 

or<00:02:17.330> power<00:02:17.540> to<00:02:17.720> weapons<00:02:17.840> I<00:02:18.110> think

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:54.260 

and<00:02:29.680> his<00:02:29.950> shields<00:02:30.310> down

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:54.270 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.590 

probably<00:02:55.020> do<00:02:55.200> some<00:02:55.500> kinetic<00:02:56.160> weapons<00:02:56.700> for

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
probably do some kinetic weapons for

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:04.660 
probably do some kinetic weapons for
hull<00:02:57.780> damage<00:02:58.020> but<00:02:58.610> honestly<00:02:59.610> these<00:02:59.820> look<00:03:00.060> cool

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:04.670 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.540 

and<00:03:05.390> they<00:03:06.350> can't<00:03:06.560> get<00:03:06.770> a<00:03:06.800> decent<00:03:06.980> kinetic

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:07.550 
and they can't get a decent kinetic

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:10.110 
and they can't get a decent kinetic
weapon<00:03:07.760> on<00:03:08.060> a<00:03:08.090> turret<00:03:08.569> and<00:03:09.080> these<00:03:09.290> are

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
weapon on a turret and these are

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:17.000 
weapon on a turret and these are
incredible

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:36.830 

Oh

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.270 

he's<00:03:37.880> probably<00:03:38.880> gonna<00:03:39.150> bug<00:03:39.450> out<00:03:40.040> at<00:03:41.040> some

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
he's probably gonna bug out at some

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:42.460 
he's probably gonna bug out at some
point

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
point

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.050 
point
I<00:03:42.560> expect

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060 
I expect

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:46.940 
I expect
I've<00:03:45.510> never<00:03:45.810> actually<00:03:46.020> successfully<00:03:46.709> chased

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
I've never actually successfully chased

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:50.270 
I've never actually successfully chased
somebody<00:03:47.370> through<00:03:47.670> a<00:03:47.940> jump<00:03:48.690> yet<00:03:48.980> it<00:03:49.980> could<00:03:50.160> be

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
somebody through a jump yet it could be

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:58.010 
somebody through a jump yet it could be
interesting

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:58.020 

00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:00.370 

I<00:03:58.110> think<00:03:58.680> he's<00:03:58.800> running

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
I think he's running

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.840 
I think he's running
hey<00:04:01.380> just<00:04:01.620> commented<00:04:02.010> screw<00:04:02.340> this<00:04:02.580> on<00:04:02.760> the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480 
shields back is he gonna try a jump if I

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.270 
shields back is he gonna try a jump if I
wonder

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:23.280 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.340 

he's<00:04:23.910> got<00:04:24.090> my<00:04:24.180> shields<00:04:24.510> down

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350

I hope that's the fades because if it's

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.110 
I hope that's the fades because if it's
his<00:05:25.990> friends<00:05:26.730> it's<00:05:27.730> gonna<00:05:27.880> get<00:05:28.030> very
