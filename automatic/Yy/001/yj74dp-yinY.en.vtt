00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.650

circle<00:03:19.500> around<00:03:19.980> the<00:03:20.610> coaster<00:03:21.000> I<00:03:21.209> probably

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
circle around the coaster I probably

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.660 
circle around the coaster I probably
wouldn't<00:03:22.140> have<00:03:22.200> it<00:03:22.440> this<00:03:23.130> side<00:03:23.370> yeah<00:03:23.519> because

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
wouldn't have it this side yeah because

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.250 
wouldn't have it this side yeah because
I<00:03:23.760> think<00:03:23.850> it's<00:03:24.030> a<00:03:24.060> little<00:03:24.299> tighter<00:03:24.570> to<00:03:24.660> plastic

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
I think it's a little tighter to plastic

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:32.930 
I think it's a little tighter to plastic
yeah<00:03:30.769> when<00:03:31.769> you<00:03:31.890> cut<00:03:32.160> out<00:03:32.400> the<00:03:32.580> circle

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
yeah when you cut out the circle

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.640 
yeah when you cut out the circle
eventually<00:03:33.330> you're<00:03:33.600> gonna<00:03:33.660> actually<00:03:33.930> go<00:03:34.290> a

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
eventually you're gonna actually go a

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.380 
eventually you're gonna actually go a
little<00:03:35.160> bit<00:03:35.370> inside<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.910> line<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.330> it

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:36.390 
little bit inside that line so it

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:37.460 
little bit inside that line so it
doesn't<00:03:36.570> have<00:03:36.660> to<00:03:36.690> be<00:03:36.780> perfect<00:03:37.140> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.350> use<00:03:37.440> a

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
doesn't have to be perfect you can use a

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:38.930 
doesn't have to be perfect you can use a
pen<00:03:37.650> you<00:03:37.739> can<00:03:37.769> use<00:03:37.890> pencil<00:03:38.310> it<00:03:38.549> doesn't<00:03:38.820> really

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
pen you can use pencil it doesn't really

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.770 
pen you can use pencil it doesn't really
matter<00:03:39.350> all<00:03:40.350> right<00:03:41.090> so<00:03:42.090> the<00:03:42.180> next<00:03:42.209> thing<00:03:42.450> is

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:42.780 
matter all right so the next thing is

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.350 
matter all right so the next thing is
just<00:03:43.260> putting<00:03:43.530> out<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.860> circle<00:03:44.250> if<00:03:44.850> you<00:03:44.910> feel

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:45.360

after my fudge is that it is waterproof
that's<00:05:21.280> the<00:05:21.430> whole<00:05:21.580> thing<00:05:21.730> so<00:05:22.090> you<00:05:22.150> use<00:05:22.450> it<00:05:22.480> as

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
that's the whole thing so you use it as

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.060 
that's the whole thing so you use it as
a<00:05:22.720> sealant<00:05:23.110> you're<00:05:23.500> going<00:05:23.620> to<00:05:23.680> want<00:05:23.860> to<00:05:23.890> do<00:05:24.040> a

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:24.070 
a sealant you're going to want to do a

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:25.740 
a sealant you're going to want to do a
few<00:05:24.490> layers<00:05:24.760> we<00:05:25.090> can<00:05:25.120> start<00:05:25.390> with<00:05:25.450> our<00:05:25.540> first

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:25.750 
few layers we can start with our first

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:26.610 
few layers we can start with our first
layer<00:05:25.900> and<00:05:25.930> then<00:05:26.110> we're<00:05:26.200> going<00:05:26.290> to<00:05:26.470> get<00:05:26.560> a

00:05:26.610 --> 00:05:26.620 
layer and then we're going to get a

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.960 
layer and then we're going to get a
little<00:05:26.770> bit<00:05:26.860> of<00:05:26.950> move<00:05:27.220> magic<00:05:27.610> to<00:05:27.730> make<00:05:27.820> this

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:27.970 
little bit of move magic to make this

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:28.350 
little bit of move magic to make this
happen

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:28.360 
happen

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.420 
happen
thanks<00:05:29.169> thin<00:05:29.620> layers<00:05:29.860> are<00:05:30.070> good<00:05:30.160> for<00:05:30.280> this

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 
thanks thin layers are good for this

good<00:05:30.990> don't<00:05:31.990> worry<00:05:32.320> that<00:05:32.860> it<00:05:33.490> looks<00:05:33.700> like<00:05:33.820> you

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:33.910 
good don't worry that it looks like you

00:05:33.910 --> 00:05:35.310 
good don't worry that it looks like you
can't<00:05:34.090> see<00:05:34.240> anything<00:05:34.540> that<00:05:34.840> will<00:05:35.020> dry<00:05:35.260> clear

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:35.320 
can't see anything that will dry clear

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:41.760 
can't see anything that will dry clear
when<00:05:35.919> I<00:05:35.950> did<00:05:36.190> mine<00:05:38.580> testing<00:05:39.580> this<00:05:39.640> out<00:05:39.820> I<00:05:40.770> used

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
when I did mine testing this out I used

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.860 
when I did mine testing this out I used
a<00:05:41.860> brush<00:05:41.950> like<00:05:42.190> that<00:05:42.250> and<00:05:42.700> left<00:05:43.330> the<00:05:43.570> grains

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
a brush like that and left the grains

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.210 
a brush like that and left the grains
and<00:05:44.169> cuz<00:05:44.440> I<00:05:44.500> actually<00:05:44.590> think<00:05:44.830> that's<00:05:45.040> kind<00:05:45.190> of

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:45.220 
and cuz I actually think that's kind of

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:48.330 
and cuz I actually think that's kind of
cool<00:05:45.370> it<00:05:45.820> gives<00:05:46.270> it<00:05:46.390> a<00:05:46.450> little<00:05:46.570> bit<00:05:46.720> of<00:05:47.340> Sheen

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:48.340 
cool it gives it a little bit of Sheen

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:50.520 
cool it gives it a little bit of Sheen
and<00:05:48.550> shine<00:05:48.790> it's<00:05:49.390> kind<00:05:49.570> of<00:05:49.600> cool<00:05:49.720> but<00:05:50.410> you<00:05:50.500> know

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:50.530 
and shine it's kind of cool but you know

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.440 
and shine it's kind of cool but you know
see<00:05:50.770> the<00:05:50.890> sponge<00:05:51.220> brush<00:05:51.490> and<00:05:51.790> that<00:05:52.120> actually

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450 
see the sponge brush and that actually

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:53.970 
see the sponge brush and that actually
gives<00:05:52.600> you<00:05:52.660> a<00:05:52.720> smoother<00:05:53.169> finish<00:05:53.200> alright<00:05:53.770> so

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:53.980 
gives you a smoother finish alright so

00:05:53.980 --> 00:05:55.470 
gives you a smoother finish alright so
you're<00:05:54.220> gonna<00:05:54.310> want<00:05:54.520> let<00:05:54.640> your<00:05:54.820> your<00:05:55.150> coaster

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:55.480 
you're gonna want let your your coaster

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:58.170 
you're gonna want let your your coaster
dry<00:05:55.720> it'll<00:05:56.620> get<00:05:56.770> glossy<00:05:57.400> then<00:05:57.790> you'll<00:05:57.940> you'll

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
dry it'll get glossy then you'll you'll

00:05:58.180 --> 00:05:59.940 
dry it'll get glossy then you'll you'll
put<00:05:58.419> another<00:05:58.600> layer<00:05:58.840> you<00:05:59.169> can<00:05:59.290> you<00:05:59.680> know<00:05:59.770> play

00:05:59.940 --> 00:05:59.950 
put another layer you can you know play

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.710 
put another layer you can you know play
around<00:06:00.220> with<00:06:00.400> what<00:06:00.610> you<00:06:00.760> what<00:06:01.330> you<00:06:01.419> want<00:06:01.630> in

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:01.720 
around with what you what you want in

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:03.629 
around with what you what you want in
terms<00:06:01.900> of<00:06:02.169> number<00:06:03.010> of<00:06:03.070> coats

00:06:03.629 --> 00:06:03.639 
terms of number of coats

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.459 
terms of number of coats
terms<00:06:03.789> of<00:06:03.969> three<00:06:04.629> and<00:06:04.750> a<00:06:04.780> half<00:06:04.960> three<00:06:05.349> and<00:06:05.439> a

00:06:05.459 --> 00:06:05.469 
terms of three and a half three and a

00:06:05.469 --> 00:06:06.540 
terms of three and a half three and a
half<00:06:05.560> yeah<00:06:05.740> actually<00:06:05.949> I<00:06:06.129> think<00:06:06.310> that's<00:06:06.430> a<00:06:06.460> good

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:06.550 
half yeah actually I think that's a good

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.999 
half yeah actually I think that's a good
number

00:06:07.999 --> 00:06:08.009 
number

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.110 
number
anyway<00:06:09.009> I<00:06:09.039> mean<00:06:09.219> that's<00:06:09.430> basically<00:06:09.729> it<00:06:09.939> the

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:10.120 
anyway I mean that's basically it the

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.779 
anyway I mean that's basically it the
drying<00:06:10.419> time<00:06:10.689> is<00:06:10.719> pretty<00:06:11.110> much<00:06:11.379> all<00:06:12.250> you<00:06:12.610> need

00:06:12.779 --> 00:06:12.789 
drying time is pretty much all you need

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:15.719 
drying time is pretty much all you need
to<00:06:13.090> do<00:06:13.240> with<00:06:13.479> this<00:06:13.659> you'll<00:06:14.650> test<00:06:15.310> it<00:06:15.430> out<00:06:15.490> I

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
to do with this you'll test it out I

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:17.520 
to do with this you'll test it out I
mean<00:06:15.909> see<00:06:16.240> put<00:06:16.509> a<00:06:16.539> coaster<00:06:16.810> down<00:06:16.930> on<00:06:17.050> it<00:06:17.139> if<00:06:17.289> it

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:17.530 
mean see put a coaster down on it if it

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.230 
mean see put a coaster down on it if it
seems<00:06:17.800> like<00:06:18.039> it's<00:06:18.219> you<00:06:18.490> know<00:06:18.580> just<00:06:18.610> solving

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240 
seems like it's you know just solving

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:24.240 
seems like it's you know just solving
the<00:06:19.360> glaze<00:06:21.389> I'm<00:06:22.389> gonna<00:06:22.990> let<00:06:23.259> this<00:06:23.409> one<00:06:23.590> sit<00:06:23.919> for

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:24.250 
the glaze I'm gonna let this one sit for

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.860 
the glaze I'm gonna let this one sit for
a<00:06:24.280> week<00:06:24.490> and<00:06:24.699> a<00:06:24.729> half<00:06:24.759> that<00:06:25.120> sounds<00:06:25.449> good<00:06:25.599> yeah
