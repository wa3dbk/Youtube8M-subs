00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
back of the left over here what we're

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.380 
back of the left over here what we're
doing<00:01:54.000> is<00:01:54.180> selecting<00:01:54.780> what<00:01:55.440> type<00:01:55.650> of<00:01:55.800> image<00:01:56.100> in

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
doing is selecting what type of image in

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.789 
doing is selecting what type of image in

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
if I rotate the bottom I can attend as

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.570 
if I rotate the bottom I can attend as

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
well a JPEG image that it will shoot at

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.100 
well a JPEG image that it will shoot at
the<00:02:17.700> same<00:02:17.730> time<00:02:18.180> in<00:02:18.360> any<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.810> different

the same time in any of the different
quality<00:02:19.500> levels<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.460> that's<00:02:20.730> large<00:02:21.480> with<00:02:21.960> a

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:21.990 
quality levels so that's large with a

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.130

nice<00:02:22.790> low<00:02:23.790> compression<00:02:24.210> setting<00:02:24.690> or<00:02:24.810> large

nice low compression setting or large

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.480 
nice low compression setting or large

with a higher compression setting

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.220 
with a higher compression setting
allowing<00:02:26.910> you<00:02:27.060> to<00:02:27.180> take<00:02:27.330> more<00:02:27.510> images<00:02:27.570> but

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
allowing you to take more images but

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.290 
allowing you to take more images but
with<00:02:28.410> a<00:02:28.440> slightly<00:02:28.740> lower<00:02:28.980> quality<00:02:29.490> the<00:02:29.880> medium

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
with a slightly lower quality the medium

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.210 
with a slightly lower quality the medium
settings<00:02:30.660> basically<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.380> reduces<00:02:31.980> the

settings basically this reduces the

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.490 
settings basically this reduces the

remember use the giant CF card and
you'll<00:02:58.140> be<00:02:58.230> able<00:02:58.290> to<00:02:58.440> take<00:02:58.560> more<00:02:58.680> pictures<00:02:59.070> now

you'll be able to take more pictures now

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.850 
you'll be able to take more pictures now

where I'll end up staying a lot of the
time<00:03:06.590> if<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.920> want<00:03:07.950> to<00:03:08.130> really<00:03:08.370> experiment

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
time if you want to really experiment

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:11.030 
time if you want to really experiment
with<00:03:08.940> processing<00:03:09.570> photos<00:03:09.900> after<00:03:10.380> the<00:03:10.500> fact<00:03:10.740> go

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
with processing photos after the fact go

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.010 
with processing photos after the fact go
into<00:03:11.280> the<00:03:11.400> raw<00:03:11.610> area<00:03:12.060> over<00:03:12.210> here<00:03:12.270> where<00:03:12.540> the

into the raw area over here where the

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:14.630 
into the raw area over here where the
camera<00:03:13.350> takes<00:03:13.560> all<00:03:13.740> the<00:03:14.100> information<00:03:14.520> from

camera takes all the information from
the<00:03:14.820> image<00:03:15.210> but<00:03:15.630> does<00:03:15.810> not<00:03:16.550> process<00:03:17.550> it<00:03:17.580> into<00:03:17.910> a

the image but does not process it into a
