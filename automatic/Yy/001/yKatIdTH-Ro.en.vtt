00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.910
 using a hair dryer to have 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.800
 more volume and gained length 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.800

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:34.559

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:41.280

 I hope you'll like it then 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.180

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 deep care so I put you the link 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.590
 top right to present my 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.070
 capillary routine in winter and as one 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.500
 I realized this deep care so here it is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:58.980
 you see my little curls before 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.600
 start the bloa where I'm going to separate my 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.280
 head in several parts it will be 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.450
 much simpler to achieve 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.890
 the hairstyle includes small tongs 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.909
 croco 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.909
 to maintain all that 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.700
 we are not obliged to make small 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.110
 sections could make big section 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.110
 do not know it's not embarrassing 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.590
 then the first item you will have 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.990
 need to achieve this hairstyle 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.759
 stops julie wynne conditioners the 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.259
 natural essential design 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.940
 so these two German end lawyers 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:42.450
 so it's an after- shampoo without 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.340
 rinsing that is to the lawyer and the 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 mint so do not worry I you 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.240
 put all the product links into 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.549
 info bar like this you will see 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.009
 in detail what is it about then there you 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:57.509
 go apply it on the first 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:02:00.000
 section homogeneously across the entire 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.960
 hair feels so good I 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.729
 assure you it's a happiness so 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.729
 we apply well over the entire length 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:12.619
 and on the tips also the goal is to 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.619
 to feed the hair well moisturize 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:19.150
 we bump we untangle a little bit before 

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:22.989
 shots and hair 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.989
 we do not forget the fears 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.040
 so here I have a hair dryer 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.280
 it's a hair line pro line 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.330
 is basic with a one cold air will 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:33.450
 use cold air 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.549
 besides to make this hairstyle 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:39.700
 is a little mouthpiece so there you go 

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.680
 and pull your game to the maximum do you 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:44.019
 did not hurt just pulled the hair for 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.849
 that it is right and so after 

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:50.829
 will dry in cold air 

00:02:45.849 --> 00:02:52.360
 the hair pulling on finally in 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.040
 stretching it because pulling it 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.200
 do a little bit I rely on on 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:59.160
 hair but that's not the case I you 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.160
 do not recommend doing that 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:07.030
 is longer or shorter that according 

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:09.510
 from the porosity of 2 to my hair 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:11.830
 hair dries pretty fast so 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.370
 so we'll say that to achieve this 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:15.900
 wholesale hairstyle I put a good 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.940
 half-hour 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:21.820
 so we continue to dry and we forget 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.990
 not the pigeon besides this hairstyle 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.070
 allowed me to realize that my 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:24.610
 points it was really in a dirty 

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.230
 state 

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.600
 so I'll make you soon a 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.300
 video explaining how to cut your 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.739
 tips 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.900
 so now the second product 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.360
 which you are going to need is 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.570
 the oil and here in this case I use 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:43.330
 the serum lives on the 2 na pwin so 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:45.030
 the apparatus is applied to the 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.820
 lengths and spikes 

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.830
 then we will use a brush 

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.280
 will put at the end of the hair dryer to 

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:59.190
 the finishes you did the 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.190
 main by stretching your hair 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.410
 and there now with the brush that goes 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:09.330
 just be with the comb earlier that's going 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.740
 to be just definition then you have to 

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.380
 ask yourself why do not we start 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:14.930
 directly with the comb to have 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.609
 tested both techniques 

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:18.299
 I feel that the smoothing is 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:21.180
 sharper 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:25.550
 when I first stretch my hair and 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:25.550
 Then I spend a whim 

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:37.190
 so there you see I realize a 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:39.550
 vanilla to maintain everything so is 

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:44.570
 there I present you a second time 

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:46.070
 how do I realize the blow out and 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.280
 then I 'll do it on the rest of my 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.280
 head 

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:12.710
 so we apply toothfish 

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:23.430
 natural essential design 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.430
 then we dry the hair by stretching 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.989
 to cold air especially do not forget 

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:31.339
 it may be a little longer but 

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:34.059
 at least your hair will suffer 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:34.059
 much less 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.200
 and we have a comb 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:51.460
 I remind you that I put you all 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:52.599

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:54.430

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:58.990
 so that's what gives a little 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:00.270
 forgetting about the first section on 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.199
 roots I put castor oil 

00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:04.150
 given time that I do not wash myself 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:04.599
 hair and scalp that has a little 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:06.400
 dry 

00:06:04.599 --> 00:06:10.860
 so do not forget to feed yourself 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:10.860
 the scalp after your deep sense 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:17.860
 so we do small massages and so 

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:20.819
 there we make vanilla to continue on 

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:20.819
 the rest of the debt 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:23.889
 when I see my points it hurts me 

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.360
 in the heart 

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:28.530
 so I quickly quickly make you a 

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:32.789

 so here I show you what it is 

00:06:42.659 --> 00:06:47.119

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:59.389

00:06:59.389 --> 00:07:03.169
 big vanilla that you see there it's 

00:07:00.619 --> 00:07:04.519
 what I usually do every 

00:07:03.169 --> 00:07:06.139
 evenings before bed 

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:10.610
 it's a hairstyle that I can keep 

00:07:06.139 --> 00:07:11.509

00:07:10.610 --> 00:07:13.789
 for that they wonder how 

00:07:11.509 --> 00:07:15.889
 I maintain at the root level I 

00:07:13.789 --> 00:07:17.329
 am going to put castor oil I do 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:19.819

00:07:17.329 --> 00:07:21.229

00:07:26.779 --> 00:07:33.379
