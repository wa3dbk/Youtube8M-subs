00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.619
 do you stand with something new ii 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.880
 visited two barendrechters skiing 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.290
 and distances would be against the competition 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.210
 baroque but first how do you look 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:26.279
 back to the last match against 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.570
 mesh lock 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.099
 after it was actually quite a bit 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.800
 awkward match because we advance 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.660
 also knew because my lock can go on properly 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.030
 The last week is education 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.860
 wolf but yes 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.480
 such a beautiful football we have one 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.370
 very important victory and booked 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.740
 also seen that there is on another field 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.240
 So happened to the relief he was 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:47.250
 very large 

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.390
 this si from the second all from the sides 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.190
 Viewed 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.690
 actually the first kiss even having 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.200
 the second season itself too often in the 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.870
 basis in the home match against one 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.280
 mountain started in down on the couch and in 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.640
 the second and came in well over aid 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:01.640
 of that match 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.600
 I already knew that his upgrade twice 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:13.700
 in time Stanley got an elbow i 

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:17.240
 follow me fine a 0 for and I had 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:20.360
 another goal and an assist of the three 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.240
 zero like an enjoyable competition 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.280
 then how is playing against mega man yes 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.020
 I don't think we had a good pace 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.040
 very high more given moment said 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.040
 They all collapsed in a bit 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.570
 handball and yes it is 

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.640
 just tricky to get through but if you do then 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.470
 the rhino stands for 2030 debt 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.100
 last minute and they are not very fond of it 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.770
 country 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.940
 excellent the top class 5 can compete 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.530
 been between jobs 

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:43.910
 bags of forest only the first we it 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.800
 just at the bar and then really scored 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:48.320
 you too 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.050
 4 euros only three times 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.520
 school and x by a ping in the 

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:53.899
 competition and then it was mainly 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:56.420
 bosanski 

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:57.350
 who let the spectators enjoy yes or 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.570
 not 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.310
 yes was end drove yes then you will 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.340
 contest have a hearing tilt 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.960
 I was n't among those five out there 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.369
 so that you know it was not five 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.080
 why can't you be scared i was 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.880
 suspended in that I am there from the gallery 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.170
 watched that match but got it 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.500
 I check in several times which we say 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.599
 all forest animals it was yes that was five ones 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:19.459
 the first season was the away match 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.560
 you reach each goal involved the hell 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.510
 something to see again for Saturday 

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.580
 I hope so if it's a one 

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:27.440
 shop shop the one you can do that already 

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:30.700
 to be enough 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.700
 how do you go into the wetstraat on saturday 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.849
 just full of course so the 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.130
 champion competition 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:38.630
 and even if you only need one point 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.400
 it is very difficult to get to a point 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:41.450
 I think you just play full ahead 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.190
 must and that you just for that 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.860
 victory must fight 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.990
 so no we are going to have another population 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.310
 the same fight as you we against 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.480
 maassluis 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.100
 And then I am convinced that it 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.540
 saddle is coming 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.450
 so been in contact with the boys from 

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:58.700
 barendrecht yes always I do like 

00:02:56.450 --> 00:03:00.530
 some friends there so you always 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.110
 have a little contact and that is 

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.130
 been a bit more last week and that 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.200
 his important match against 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:08.570
 played spakenburg and that is now 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.070
 and so that always goes on 

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.800
 special fatty acid may be something for you 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.420
 someone follows char de threw more often and 

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:17.180
 play a match there at home 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.840
 you are right for having barnet grandma 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.130
 last 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.980
 it is competitive for the visits we are 

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:23.660
 exactly where jobs are psi were we allowed 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:25.490
 there becoming a champion 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.320
 that there is a nice goodbye to apparently 

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:29.300
 to become a true champion 

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:34.280
 quick rash should ask what will it be 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:36.140
 then a victory but my ready 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.610
 English but we are at that scale 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.610
 half past four and tick it went best
