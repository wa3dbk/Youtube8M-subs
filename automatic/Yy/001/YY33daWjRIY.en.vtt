education in the face of rapidly
changing<00:00:08.610> world<00:00:08.760> of<00:00:08.970> information<00:00:09.599> and<00:00:09.780> the

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
changing world of information and the

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.020 
changing world of information and the

economy that requires critical and
innovative<00:00:12.540> thinking<00:00:13.130> teachers<00:00:14.130> should

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
innovative thinking teachers should

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.340 
innovative thinking teachers should
recognize<00:00:14.849> that<00:00:15.089> today's<00:00:15.450> students<00:00:15.990> learn<00:00:16.170> in

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
recognize that today's students learn in

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.689 
recognize that today's students learn in
ways<00:00:16.500> that<00:00:16.830> are<00:00:16.949> different<00:00:17.220> from<00:00:17.400> how<00:00:17.640> we

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
ways that are different from how we

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.300 
ways that are different from how we
learn<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.990> question<00:00:19.439> that<00:00:19.619> we<00:00:19.800> are<00:00:19.830> going<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
learn the question that we are going to

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.970 
learn the question that we are going to
examine<00:00:20.789> is<00:00:21.090> how<00:00:21.660> can<00:00:21.930> traditional<00:00:22.439> modes<00:00:22.740> of

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
examine is how can traditional modes of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:24.830 
examine is how can traditional modes of
classroom<00:00:23.519> instruction<00:00:23.640> engage<00:00:24.449> and<00:00:24.689> inspire

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
learning this is what we termed teacher

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.349 
learning this is what we termed teacher
centered<00:00:58.620> learning<00:00:58.820> but<00:00:59.820> what<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.180> the

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
centered learning but what is the

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:01.729 
centered learning but what is the
problem<00:01:00.629> with<00:01:00.870> traditional<00:01:01.109> teacher

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
problem with traditional teacher

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.439 
problem with traditional teacher
centered<00:01:02.280> approach<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:02.820> why<00:01:03.000> should<00:01:03.300> we

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
centered approach and why should we

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:07.850 
centered approach and why should we
promote<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> student-centered<00:01:04.680> approach<00:01:06.860> let
