room<00:00:46.680> boosting<00:00:48.050> stuff<00:00:49.050> I've<00:00:49.410> used<00:00:49.920> I<00:00:50.280> really

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
room boosting stuff I've used I really

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.729 
room boosting stuff I've used I really
really<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.180> and<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.379> next<00:00:52.410> thing<00:00:53.000> is

00:00:54.729 --> 00:00:54.739 
really like that and the next thing is

00:00:54.739 --> 00:00:58.040 
really like that and the next thing is
this<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:56.640> showed<00:00:57.090> this<00:00:57.239> in<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.629> of<00:00:57.719> my<00:00:57.809> haul

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
this I showed this in one of my haul

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.740 
this I showed this in one of my haul
videos<00:00:58.440> recently<00:00:58.980> and<00:00:59.219> it's<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.789> rush<00:01:00.180> sixty

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750

and I think that this really works I
don't<00:01:07.350> know<00:01:07.530> about<00:01:07.650> 60<00:01:08.220> seconds<00:01:08.729> I'm<00:01:09.150> not

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
don't know about 60 seconds I'm not

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.530 
don't know about 60 seconds I'm not
really<00:01:09.479> sure<00:01:09.720> about<00:01:09.869> that<00:01:10.170> but<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:10.970> like<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.150> and

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700

chapstick and I thought that was a lip
gloss<00:02:51.730> I<00:02:52.270> just<00:02:52.930> wanted<00:02:53.260> to<00:02:53.350> do<00:02:53.440> with<00:02:53.680> glass<00:02:53.890> and

gloss I just wanted to do with glass and

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.330 
gloss I just wanted to do with glass and
I<00:02:55.540> didn't<00:02:55.990> find<00:02:56.080> any<00:02:56.320> chapstick<00:02:56.770> that<00:02:57.010> I<00:02:57.040> liked

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
I didn't find any chapstick that I liked

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:58.680 
I didn't find any chapstick that I liked
so<00:02:57.550> I<00:02:57.580> was<00:02:57.700> like<00:02:57.790> oh<00:02:57.880> I'll<00:02:57.940> just<00:02:58.060> get<00:02:58.360> this<00:02:58.510> lip

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 
so I was like oh I'll just get this lip

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.630 
so I was like oh I'll just get this lip
gloss<00:02:58.720> and<00:02:59.680> it<00:02:59.800> turns<00:03:00.010> out<00:03:00.160> that<00:03:00.340> it's<00:03:00.490> like

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:00.640 
gloss and it turns out that it's like

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.610 
gloss and it turns out that it's like
the<00:03:00.820> texture<00:03:01.270> pretty<00:03:01.540> much<00:03:01.690> of<00:03:01.900> a<00:03:02.020> chapstick

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
the texture pretty much of a chapstick

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.770
