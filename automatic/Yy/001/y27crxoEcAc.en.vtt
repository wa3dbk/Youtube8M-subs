00:00:02.409 --> 00:00:09.879
 we had problems to get into the game 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.530
 I think we were a bit 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.969
 uncertain 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:17.000
 we are not so good forward 

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.259
 then there had come the one 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:24.769
 or other unnecessary ball loss and 

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:27.099
 The Irish have delivered very well 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:30.679
 so to speak, I also made it difficult 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:34.040
 and as I said it was not on time 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:36.400
 What I did not imagine we did 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.520
 then made change 

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:45.500
 leading for tobacco and to play is 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:47.480
 it was not better to walk forward 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:51.380
 that I was dissatisfied with lime 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:55.160
 I just think that goes on one 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:57.770
 has better offensive alignment and 

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.990
 I think that it paid off too 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:05.780
 has that we occupied more 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.750
 30 had 40 meters in front of the Irish gate 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:13.040
 and then also come to possibilities 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:16.280
 are still about 15 minutes second skin 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.409
 here have got their hands full 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.930
 but I have two three so shadowy 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:24.260
 really good option then 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.659
 Unfortunately, no goal was made and her team before 

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:29.420
 the game said that we have to be patient 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.320
 that the gate is still in the 90th 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.290
 can draw 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.420
 and fortunately that is still driven 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.870
 and of course we all see 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.660
 overjoyed and happy that we 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:45.470
 continue in the raffle are with it 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:48.960
 like real madrid 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:56.420
 because tina moderate or or or or 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:59.369
 referee joachim guth players trio 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:13.770
 five implenia liquid ulrich anke schipp 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:16.410
 the templars their brown brown green 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:25.019
 concept is this brought the vice 15 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:28.950
 is of course a bit anxious 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.780
 a bit unsure and and have there 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.790
 I of course try to play there 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.310
 to give self-confidence again 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.650
 you that your quality on the 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:40.110
 bring space and that is actually that 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.880
 most important of course that was knowing 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.140
 you can play football then 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.600
 maybe one or the other 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:47.400
 but demanding makes the decision is 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:49.860
 From the square it must bring on the place 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.640
 and not only the proverbs 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:56.250
 but the decisive thing is 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:59.700
 go on the green out and down 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:03.440
 put it over and then it's eaten or 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.440
 gangster german health-care 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:34.239
 mini mini player play the game crash 

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:37.840
 would be spain's rating internet provider 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:39.819
 the presenter I think that in the 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.739
 made a good first half game 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.159
 is that they have come forward 

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.220
 and that also with their play and so gave 

00:03:45.159 --> 00:03:51.040
 it's one way or the other 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:53.290
 dangerous situation and I think that 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.329
 As I said in the second main 

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:57.189
 have developed naturally more pressure 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:04:00.909
 that we played more forward 

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:04.590
 and that in turn would be good for us 

00:04:00.909 --> 00:04:04.590
 There are not many possibilities 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:38.110
 most jobs 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:39.840
 it is still on the 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:42.550
 third place and that we are 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:45.699
 Of course, in Sweden I think 

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:47.220
 score points and the last game on 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:49.599
 the Faroe islands 

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:53.470
 Sweden then plays at home in 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:56.199
 germany so if you continue with it 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.270
 I think I want to be up for teaching 

00:04:56.199 --> 00:05:14.699
 Of course, our side still needs more 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:18.240
 sweden front and also points line 

00:05:14.699 --> 00:05:18.240
 Place is porsche 

00:05:25.259 --> 00:05:34.300
 alcohol is positive that we the second 

00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:35.080
 half time because not then have played 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.969
 as we 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.030
 It was not from the beginning to play 

00:05:36.969 --> 00:05:41.620
 wanted that but as I said also 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:44.919
 a young team still 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:47.050
 must develop and believe this too 

00:05:44.919 --> 00:05:48.969
 to yourself that you can play like that 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:50.259
 and that you dare and um 

00:05:48.969 --> 00:05:52.030
 every situation even if the 

00:05:50.259 --> 00:05:54.460
 playing against each other when he plays 

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:57.810
 if he is aggressive that one really 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:06:01.270
 there also tried the ball in their own 

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.860
 to keep rows and we have to 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:05.620
 take along and of course, of course 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.690
 away game in Sweden with again 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.599
 a bit to the audience here in 

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:12.789
 Vienna was fantastic once again 

00:06:10.599 --> 00:06:15.310
 I have this atmosphere and was extreme 

00:06:12.789 --> 00:06:17.110
 important as the twelfth man 

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.240
 the players of course also from 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:22.050
 friday game was tired that gave 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:27.159
 Once again, draw again and it was a 

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:28.900
 fantastic with each other and in 

00:06:27.159 --> 00:06:30.940
 Of course, sweden will not be that many 

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:34.090
 be there and there will be important 

00:06:30.940 --> 00:06:35.770
 that we still be natural 

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:38.699
 bring this game to the square and 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.699
 has followed
