 River made an effort to capture the attention of the federal government to 

00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:11.750
 that this one desists to the creation of a border wall since they assure that the 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.170
 creation of that barrier would affect the ecological corridor in this region 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:21.420
 more than 30 community leaders came this morning to the margins 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.099

 whose objective was to promote the preservation of the environment with 

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.860
 Recreational activities

 organization the roads of the river considers that this region is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.750
 would benefit in large part from this type of activities 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.679
 there was some great 

00:01:00.679 --> 00:01:03.670

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.040
 type of recreation on their part leaders of the city of rome the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.940
 Chancellor German Tamaulipas 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.500
 consider that if tourism will achieve economic growth in 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.430
 both border cities 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:17.680
 it's an opportunity where we have 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.330
 teach the valley 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:20.830
 the potential 

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.380
 small estate this kind of 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.580
 of activity can be a source of income for many families we have 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:28.820
 a lot to exploit 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.820
 in tourism 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:33.760
 now with the sweats foresees tourist trips or kayak trips 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.969
 who is promoting 

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:37.200
 the roads of the river 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.500
 It is another activity that gives 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:43.130
 added value to how little we are there came a lot that we are doing 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.220
 here in german miguel 

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:46.939
 the effort made 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.249
 it was not in protest against laws that threaten the safety of both 

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:54.240
 countries but to demonstrate with examples of governments by both sides of the 

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.299
 border can work together is not a protest is a 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.480
 this is a demonstration of adobe resource 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.660
 that represents a large river 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.530
 because nothing an attractive option for the area of ​​protecting the border 

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:13.640
 oo promotion of legal ages 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:16.539
 here is the sample 

00:02:16.539 --> 00:02:19.569
 palpa pd of the good relationship that exists between countries 

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:22.149
 d 

00:02:22.149 --> 00:02:25.299
 the the way you can coexist 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.469
 and sharing and supporting each other 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:33.280
 this week the president bush signed the law to reinforce with 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.620
 barriers walls and military technology surveillance on the southern border something that 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:41.440
 according to some leaders it would affect the ecological system in this region 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.570
 but not the relations that both border cities have because we can 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:47.689
 we want with that activity is 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:50.479
 make bridges in obregón by walls 

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:54.479
 but it is a monkey respectful of the decisions of our neighbors 

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:57.369
 Colombia for a disaster and I see it as 

00:02:57.369 --> 00:03:00.369
 as possible they could not put 

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:05.199
 it's not like putting him in a desert and they split desert 

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:08.659
 here we are dividing environment and 15 days 

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:11.009
 and I think he sees it impossible 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:14.309
 and well then, and in this way, how are you going to promote the activities 

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:16.370
 recreational in this region 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.480
 It is expected that another event will be held next November 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.569
 similar to this one from the city of roma I am Antonio Rodríguez returned with 

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.010
 you to the studies
