00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
shiny pokemon alright so in the fourth

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.060 
shiny pokemon alright so in the fourth
generation<00:01:08.990> it<00:01:09.990> takes<00:01:10.380> the<00:01:10.530> chances<00:01:10.920> from

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
generation it takes the chances from

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:17.020 
generation it takes the chances from
being<00:01:11.340> one<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:12.380> 8,192<00:01:13.409> to<00:01:14.159> making<00:01:14.490> it<00:01:14.610> one<00:01:14.970> in

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
being one in 8,192 to making it one in

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.570 
being one in 8,192 to making it one in
1639<00:01:18.030> so<00:01:18.990> this<00:01:19.110> decreases<00:01:19.560> it<00:01:19.799> by<00:01:19.920> quite<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> lot

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
1639 so this decreases it by quite a lot

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.420 
1639 so this decreases it by quite a lot
and<00:01:20.850> any<00:01:21.299> fifth<00:01:21.659> generation<00:01:22.290> it<00:01:22.860> takes<00:01:23.220> it

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
and any fifth generation it takes it

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.590 
and any fifth generation it takes it
from<00:01:23.759> one<00:01:24.710> 8192<00:01:25.710> and<00:01:25.970> brings<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.090> chances<00:01:27.420> to

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
from one 8192 and brings the chances to

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.679 
from one 8192 and brings the chances to
one<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:29.930> 1366<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.549> decreases<00:01:33.450> their

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
one in 1366 so that decreases their

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.390 
one in 1366 so that decreases their
increases<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.409> chances<00:01:34.770> of<00:01:34.860> getting<00:01:34.979> a<00:01:35.159> shiny

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.499 
increases the chances of getting a shiny
pokemon<00:01:36.000> by<00:01:36.450> six<00:01:36.869> times<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:38.220> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.240> really

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
pokemon by six times so this is really

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.240 
same language you'll get the regular
chances<00:01:59.650> of<00:01:59.800> greeting<00:02:00.220> a<00:02:00.370> shiny<00:02:00.880> which<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.390> one

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
chances of greeting a shiny which is one

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.160 
chances of greeting a shiny which is one
8192<00:02:03.250> and<00:02:03.520> then<00:02:04.210> you<00:02:04.510> get<00:02:04.690> them<00:02:04.810> from<00:02:04.990> two

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:05.170 
8192 and then you get them from two

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.500 
8192 and then you get them from two
different<00:02:05.320> languages<00:02:06.190> there<00:02:06.850> and<00:02:07.210> then<00:02:07.420> you

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:07.510 
different languages there and then you

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:10.320 
different languages there and then you
have<00:02:07.750> a<00:02:08.080> much<00:02:09.009> higher<00:02:09.250> chance<00:02:09.310> of<00:02:09.759> getting<00:02:10.030> a

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
have a much higher chance of getting a

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.540 
have a much higher chance of getting a
shiny<00:02:10.660> pokemon<00:02:11.320> and<00:02:11.530> then<00:02:12.040> if<00:02:12.220> you<00:02:12.310> breed<00:02:12.520> them

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
shiny pokemon and then if you breed them

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.050 
shiny pokemon and then if you breed them
with<00:02:12.820> an<00:02:12.940> engraved<00:02:13.450> game<00:02:14.140> trait<00:02:14.560> such<00:02:14.800> as<00:02:15.060> Papa

or<00:02:16.980> lieutenants<00:02:17.980> urges<00:02:18.340> Pikachu<00:02:18.880> then<00:02:19.570> it

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
or lieutenants urges Pikachu then it

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.600 
or lieutenants urges Pikachu then it
will<00:02:20.080> still<00:02:20.530> have<00:02:20.680> the<00:02:20.830> same<00:02:21.010> chances<00:02:21.430> it's

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
will still have the same chances it's

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.960 
will still have the same chances it's
got<00:02:21.820> to<00:02:21.970> be<00:02:22.060> from<00:02:22.360> a<00:02:22.570> foreign<00:02:23.110> owner<00:02:23.410> so<00:02:24.220> you're

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
got to be from a foreign owner so you're

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.790

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
maybe like some Japanese ditto is

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:38.040 
maybe like some Japanese ditto is
easiest<00:02:36.790> one<00:02:37.000> to<00:02:37.030> find<00:02:37.330> or<00:02:37.510> another<00:02:37.720> foreign
