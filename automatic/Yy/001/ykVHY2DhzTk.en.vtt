version<00:00:28.369> 10<00:00:28.790> we<00:00:29.630> did<00:00:29.810> another<00:00:30.050> video<00:00:30.260> on

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
version 10 we did another video on

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.530 
version 10 we did another video on
nested<00:00:31.250> layers<00:00:31.520> and<00:00:31.880> we'll<00:00:31.970> cover<00:00:32.180> that<00:00:32.390> again

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:32.540 
nested layers and we'll cover that again

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.229 
nested layers and we'll cover that again
as<00:00:32.930> it<00:00:33.200> is<00:00:33.470> a<00:00:33.680> bone<00:00:34.070> enhancement<00:00:34.850> so<00:00:35.059> you'll

00:00:35.229 --> 00:00:35.239 
as it is a bone enhancement so you'll

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:37.840 
as it is a bone enhancement so you'll
get<00:00:35.360> a<00:00:35.420> brief<00:00:35.720> rundown<00:00:36.080> of<00:00:36.440> that<00:00:36.650> however<00:00:37.489> if

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
get a brief rundown of that however if

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.100 
get a brief rundown of that however if
you're<00:00:37.970> looking<00:00:38.059> for<00:00:38.390> more<00:00:38.570> in-depth

you're looking for more in-depth
information<00:00:39.440> on<00:00:39.890> the<00:00:40.160> nested<00:00:40.489> layers<00:00:40.670> we

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
information on the nested layers we

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.790 
information on the nested layers we
recommend<00:00:41.720> that<00:00:41.840> you<00:00:41.960> check<00:00:41.989> out<00:00:42.350> that<00:00:42.590> video

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:42.800

to<00:00:49.100> get<00:00:49.220> started<00:00:49.430> what<00:00:49.940> we<00:00:50.090> have<00:00:50.330> going<00:00:50.690> on

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
to get started what we have going on

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:53.889 
to get started what we have going on
here<00:00:50.870> is<00:00:51.470> just<00:00:51.530> a<00:00:52.460> character<00:00:52.970> that<00:00:53.149> we<00:00:53.270> rigged

00:00:53.889 --> 00:00:53.899 
here is just a character that we rigged

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:56.200 
here is just a character that we rigged
up<00:00:54.079> and<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:54.860> can<00:00:55.010> see<00:00:55.250> here<00:00:55.610> on<00:00:55.760> our<00:00:55.790> layers

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
up and you can see here on our layers

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.160 
up and you can see here on our layers
panel<00:00:56.570> that<00:00:57.350> we<00:00:57.620> have<00:00:58.010> to<00:00:58.730> bone<00:00:59.030> layers<00:00:59.329> one<00:01:00.020> is

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
panel that we have to bone layers one is

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.280 
panel that we have to bone layers one is
nested<00:01:00.710> within<00:01:00.860> the<00:01:01.130> other<00:01:01.390> the<00:01:02.390> move<00:01:02.750> layer

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
nested within the other the move layer

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.150 
nested within the other the move layer
bone<00:01:03.680> layer<00:01:04.309> is<00:01:04.610> the<00:01:05.649> smart<00:01:06.649> bone<00:01:06.860> that<00:01:07.040> we

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
bone layer is the smart bone that we

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.460 
bone layer is the smart bone that we
made<00:01:07.369> in<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.729> run<00:01:07.910> cycle<00:01:08.420> is<00:01:08.600> simply<00:01:08.990> the<00:01:09.290> run

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:09.470 
made in the run cycle is simply the run

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.529 
made in the run cycle is simply the run
cycle<00:01:09.710> animation<00:01:10.009> you<00:01:10.580> can<00:01:10.610> see<00:01:10.910> our<00:01:11.060> dial<00:01:11.300> is

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
cycle animation you can see our dial is

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.749 
cycle animation you can see our dial is
right<00:01:11.720> there<00:01:11.990> for<00:01:12.350> the<00:01:12.649> first<00:01:12.950> bone<00:01:13.250> layer<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759 
right there for the first bone layer and

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.330 
right there for the first bone layer and
if<00:01:14.210> we<00:01:14.300> play<00:01:14.539> this<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.289> second<00:01:15.770> bone<00:01:15.920> layer<00:01:16.160> is

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:16.340 
if we play this the second bone layer is

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.070 
if we play this the second bone layer is
just<00:01:16.550> doing<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.000> it's<00:01:17.420> cycling<00:01:17.780> an

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:18.080 
just doing this it's cycling an

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.460 
just doing this it's cycling an
animation<00:01:18.680> well<00:01:19.520> now<00:01:19.700> with<00:01:19.910> nested<00:01:20.509> bones<00:01:20.899> we

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
animation well now with nested bones we

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.800 
animation well now with nested bones we
can<00:01:21.649> come<00:01:21.800> in<00:01:21.920> here<00:01:22.190> and<00:01:22.369> we<00:01:23.360> could<00:01:23.479> click<00:01:23.690> on

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
can come in here and we could click on

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.529 
can come in here and we could click on
that<00:01:24.020> first<00:01:24.350> one<00:01:24.709> with<00:01:25.580> the<00:01:25.789> smart<00:01:26.149> bone<00:01:26.330> then

00:01:26.529 --> 00:01:26.539 
that first one with the smart bone then

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:28.029 
that first one with the smart bone then
we<00:01:26.600> already<00:01:26.720> have<00:01:26.959> an<00:01:27.050> action<00:01:27.500> made<00:01:27.679> up<00:01:27.830> for

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:28.039 
we already have an action made up for

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:30.160 
we already have an action made up for
this<00:01:28.220> but<00:01:28.640> it's<00:01:28.819> linked<00:01:29.209> to<00:01:29.330> the<00:01:29.600> run<00:01:29.840> cycle

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:30.170 
this but it's linked to the run cycle

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:33.550 
this but it's linked to the run cycle
layer<00:01:30.649> so<00:01:31.490> what<00:01:31.759> you<00:01:31.880> could<00:01:32.119> do<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.690> just<00:01:32.929> move

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
layer so what you could do is just move

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.809 
layer so what you could do is just move
this<00:01:33.979> dial<00:01:34.490> back<00:01:34.789> and<00:01:35.950> we<00:01:36.950> are<00:01:37.039> on<00:01:37.190> frame<00:01:37.550> one

00:01:37.809 --> 00:01:37.819 
this dial back and we are on frame one

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:41.109 
this dial back and we are on frame one
and<00:01:38.229> we<00:01:39.229> could<00:01:39.319> come<00:01:39.530> over<00:01:39.590> here<00:01:39.890> now<00:01:40.069> -<00:01:40.130> let's

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:41.119 
and we could come over here now - let's

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.040 
and we could come over here now - let's
say<00:01:41.440> frame<00:01:42.849> 96<00:01:43.849> and<00:01:44.240> then<00:01:44.420> move<00:01:44.660> the<00:01:44.810> dial

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:45.050 
say frame 96 and then move the dial

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.589 
say frame 96 and then move the dial
forward<00:01:45.709> and<00:01:46.429> again<00:01:46.700> this<00:01:46.970> action<00:01:47.450> was

00:01:47.589 --> 00:01:47.599 
forward and again this action was

00:01:47.599 --> 00:01:49.660 
forward and again this action was
already<00:01:47.899> placed<00:01:48.140> ahead<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.649> time<00:01:48.860> and<00:01:49.220> we<00:01:49.520> do

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
already placed ahead of time and we do

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:51.699 
already placed ahead of time and we do
have<00:01:49.910> a<00:01:50.149> lot<00:01:50.479> of<00:01:50.509> information<00:01:51.050> on<00:01:51.170> smart<00:01:51.560> phone

00:01:51.699 --> 00:01:51.709 
have a lot of information on smart phone

00:01:51.709 --> 00:01:53.169 
have a lot of information on smart phone
actions<00:01:52.130> and<00:01:52.310> other<00:01:52.459> videos<00:01:52.849> if<00:01:53.060> you're

00:01:53.169 --> 00:01:53.179 
actions and other videos if you're

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:55.749 
actions and other videos if you're
interested<00:01:53.899> so<00:01:54.709> as<00:01:55.009> you<00:01:55.190> can<00:01:55.280> see<00:01:55.520> when<00:01:55.729> we

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:55.759 
interested so as you can see when we

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.050 
interested so as you can see when we
play<00:01:56.000> this<00:01:56.119> out<00:01:56.300> it<00:01:57.140> plays<00:01:57.709> out<00:01:57.890> nicely<00:01:58.160> we

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.080 
play this out it plays out nicely we
could<00:01:59.240> even<00:01:59.390> move<00:02:00.080> these<00:02:00.380> keyframes<00:02:00.770> back<00:02:01.550> to

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090 
could even move these keyframes back to

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
could even move these keyframes back to
let's<00:02:02.390> say<00:02:02.630> frame<00:02:03.170> 48<00:02:03.560> to<00:02:03.979> make<00:02:04.160> it<00:02:04.310> run<00:02:04.550> faster

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:05.110 
let's say frame 48 to make it run faster

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:09.010 
let's say frame 48 to make it run faster
so<00:02:06.110> that<00:02:06.470> is<00:02:07.179> pretty<00:02:08.179> much<00:02:08.420> how<00:02:08.720> you<00:02:08.750> would

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
so that is pretty much how you would

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.260 
so that is pretty much how you would
expect<00:02:09.349> it<00:02:09.560> to<00:02:09.709> work<00:02:09.739> and<00:02:10.280> again<00:02:10.789> it's<00:02:11.030> nice

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
expect it to work and again it's nice

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.900 
expect it to work and again it's nice
now<00:02:11.599> that<00:02:11.630> we<00:02:11.930> can<00:02:12.080> nest<00:02:12.440> these<00:02:13.220> types<00:02:13.730> of

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
now that we can nest these types of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.510 
now that we can nest these types of
layers<00:02:14.150> so<00:02:14.480> that<00:02:15.110> we<00:02:15.500> can<00:02:15.739> create<00:02:16.069> more

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:16.520 
layers so that we can create more

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.180 
layers so that we can create more
advanced<00:02:17.000> movements<00:02:17.390> and<00:02:17.840> just<00:02:18.709> do<00:02:18.890> more

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:19.190 
advanced movements and just do more

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.610 
advanced movements and just do more
advanced<00:02:19.730> I<00:02:20.090> would<00:02:20.630> say<00:02:20.840> techniques<00:02:21.380> in

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:21.620 
advanced I would say techniques in

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:23.470 
advanced I would say techniques in
general<00:02:22.250> without<00:02:22.670> having<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.209> worry<00:02:23.420> about

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
general without having to worry about

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.149 
general without having to worry about
not<00:02:24.410> being<00:02:24.620> able<00:02:24.800> to<00:02:24.920> organize<00:02:25.599> within<00:02:26.599> layers

00:02:27.149 --> 00:02:27.159 
not being able to organize within layers

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:31.589 
not being able to organize within layers
so<00:02:28.159> we<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.819> that<00:02:29.409> going<00:02:30.409> on<00:02:30.709> now<00:02:31.040> the<00:02:31.099> other

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
so we have that going on now the other

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.660 
so we have that going on now the other
enhancement

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
enhancement

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.740 
enhancement
that<00:02:32.970> is<00:02:33.120> really<00:02:33.390> cool<00:02:33.750> with<00:02:34.050> version<00:02:34.620> 9.5<00:02:35.099> is

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
that is really cool with version 9.5 is

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.250 
that is really cool with version 9.5 is
the<00:02:36.750> ability<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:38.090> label<00:02:39.090> and<00:02:39.330> color<00:02:39.840> bones

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the ability to label and color bones

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.949 
the ability to label and color bones
let's<00:02:40.890> just<00:02:41.040> reset<00:02:41.430> the<00:02:41.730> workspace<00:02:42.270> here<00:02:42.750> so

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
let's just reset the workspace here so

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:44.690 
let's just reset the workspace here so
we<00:02:43.080> have<00:02:43.260> our<00:02:43.290> character<00:02:43.890> on<00:02:44.130> screen<00:02:44.520> and<00:02:44.640> we

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
we have our character on screen and we

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.270 
we have our character on screen and we
can<00:02:44.730> see<00:02:45.060> them<00:02:45.180> now<00:02:45.900> when<00:02:46.530> doing<00:02:46.800> an<00:02:46.890> animation

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
can see them now when doing an animation

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.220 
can see them now when doing an animation
like<00:02:47.640> this<00:02:47.880> sometimes<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.510> might<00:02:48.660> get<00:02:48.780> tricky

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
like this sometimes it might get tricky

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.630 
like this sometimes it might get tricky
because<00:02:49.440> you<00:02:49.680> can<00:02:49.830> see<00:02:50.069> we<00:02:50.220> have<00:02:50.370> a<00:02:50.400> lot<00:02:50.610> of

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
because you can see we have a lot of

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.600 
because you can see we have a lot of
overlap<00:02:51.270> with<00:02:51.300> bones<00:02:51.840> like<00:02:52.380> right<00:02:52.620> here<00:02:52.950> the

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
overlap with bones like right here the

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.490 
overlap with bones like right here the
arm<00:02:53.819> and<00:02:54.030> leg<00:02:54.209> bones<00:02:54.239> can<00:02:54.690> overlap<00:02:55.140> and<00:02:55.410> it's

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
arm and leg bones can overlap and it's

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.070 
arm and leg bones can overlap and it's
hard<00:02:55.709> to<00:02:55.739> tell<00:02:55.980> which<00:02:56.250> one<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.640> which<00:02:56.810> well<00:02:57.810> if

00:02:58.070 --> 00:02:58.080 
hard to tell which one is which well if

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.990 
hard to tell which one is which well if
we<00:02:58.230> take<00:02:58.380> the<00:02:58.560> select<00:02:58.890> bone<00:02:59.190> tool<00:02:59.550> and<00:02:59.910> then

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
we take the select bone tool and then

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.030 
we take the select bone tool and then
click<00:03:00.239> on<00:03:00.360> one<00:03:00.450> of<00:03:00.750> these<00:03:00.900> bones<00:03:01.230> and<00:03:01.560> go<00:03:01.830> up<00:03:01.920> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
click on one of these bones and go up to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.940 
click on one of these bones and go up to
the<00:03:02.220> top<00:03:02.430> we<00:03:03.090> can<00:03:03.269> choose<00:03:03.630> a<00:03:03.660> color<00:03:04.200> for

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
the top we can choose a color for

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.890 
the top we can choose a color for
instance<00:03:05.069> orange<00:03:05.760> you<00:03:06.000> can<00:03:06.180> see<00:03:06.360> it<00:03:06.450> now<00:03:06.630> is

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
instance orange you can see it now is

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.470 
instance orange you can see it now is
marked<00:03:07.500> as<00:03:07.590> orange<00:03:08.040> or<00:03:08.190> yellow<00:03:08.670> which<00:03:09.239> makes

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
marked as orange or yellow which makes

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.840 
marked as orange or yellow which makes
it<00:03:09.630> stand<00:03:09.930> out<00:03:10.230> so<00:03:10.860> if<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.069> get<00:03:11.190> to<00:03:11.340> that<00:03:11.430> point

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:11.850 
it stand out so if we get to that point

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.030 
it stand out so if we get to that point
then<00:03:12.120> when<00:03:12.390> there's<00:03:12.540> overlap<00:03:13.019> we<00:03:13.680> can<00:03:13.830> tell

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
then when there's overlap we can tell

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.400 
then when there's overlap we can tell
which<00:03:14.310> bone<00:03:14.580> is<00:03:14.790> which<00:03:15.030> and<00:03:15.360> we<00:03:16.019> could<00:03:16.170> color

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:16.410 
which bone is which and we could color

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:18.380 
which bone is which and we could color
code<00:03:16.739> every<00:03:17.220> single<00:03:17.549> bone<00:03:17.730> if<00:03:17.910> we<00:03:18.030> wanted<00:03:18.330> to

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
code every single bone if we wanted to

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.720 
code every single bone if we wanted to
or<00:03:18.720> just<00:03:18.840> individual<00:03:19.709> bones<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.340> might<00:03:20.580> be

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:20.730 
or just individual bones that might be

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:22.640 
or just individual bones that might be
giving<00:03:21.030> us<00:03:21.180> issues<00:03:21.420> like<00:03:22.110> we<00:03:22.260> could<00:03:22.410> do<00:03:22.530> this

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
giving us issues like we could do this

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:28.940 
giving us issues like we could do this
for<00:03:22.709> the<00:03:22.890> arm<00:03:23.130> as<00:03:23.370> well

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:28.950 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.970 

so<00:03:29.950> as<00:03:30.040> you<00:03:30.160> can<00:03:30.250> see<00:03:30.459> here<00:03:30.730> that<00:03:30.880> overlap<00:03:31.330> is

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:31.980 
so as you can see here that overlap is

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.660 
so as you can see here that overlap is
now<00:03:32.980> easier<00:03:33.520> to<00:03:34.380> work<00:03:35.380> with<00:03:35.440> because<00:03:36.220> we<00:03:36.520> can

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.670 
now easier to work with because we can

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:40.170 
now easier to work with because we can
tell<00:03:36.880> which<00:03:37.150> bone<00:03:37.420> is<00:03:37.630> which<00:03:38.310> so<00:03:39.310> another

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.180 
tell which bone is which so another

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:42.900 
tell which bone is which so another
useful<00:03:40.720> thing<00:03:41.230> about<00:03:41.470> this<00:03:41.709> is<00:03:41.980> let's<00:03:42.520> click

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:42.910 
useful thing about this is let's click

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:46.140 
useful thing about this is let's click
on<00:03:43.060> the<00:03:43.270> hand<00:03:43.569> bone<00:03:43.810> and<00:03:44.700> we<00:03:45.700> could<00:03:45.849> come<00:03:46.030> up

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:46.150 
on the hand bone and we could come up

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:49.830 
on the hand bone and we could come up
here<00:03:46.450> to<00:03:46.750> the<00:03:47.440> colors<00:03:47.830> and<00:03:48.040> choose<00:03:48.819> let's<00:03:49.720> say

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:49.840 
here to the colors and choose let's say

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:53.220 
here to the colors and choose let's say
purple<00:03:50.970> now<00:03:51.970> coming<00:03:52.569> down<00:03:52.750> here<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.140> the

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
purple now coming down here to the

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.600 
purple now coming down here to the
timeline<00:03:53.680> you'll<00:03:53.950> notice<00:03:54.310> there<00:03:54.489> is<00:03:54.580> a

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
timeline you'll notice there is a

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:57.240 
timeline you'll notice there is a
channel<00:03:55.000> for<00:03:55.150> the<00:03:55.690> purple<00:03:56.050> bones<00:03:56.319> so<00:03:57.220> that

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:57.250 
channel for the purple bones so that

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.540 
channel for the purple bones so that
means<00:03:57.670> now<00:03:58.000> that<00:03:58.690> if<00:03:59.019> you<00:03:59.470> are<00:03:59.800> confused<00:04:00.310> as<00:04:00.519> to

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:00.550 
means now that if you are confused as to

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:02.690 
means now that if you are confused as to
which<00:04:00.970> bone<00:04:01.209> is<00:04:01.360> which<00:04:01.569> on<00:04:01.780> the<00:04:01.959> channels

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:02.700 
which bone is which on the channels

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.180 
which bone is which on the channels
which<00:04:03.700> ever<00:04:03.970> bone<00:04:04.390> is<00:04:04.690> purple<00:04:05.230> you<00:04:05.890> can<00:04:06.010> just

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
which ever bone is purple you can just

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.759 
which ever bone is purple you can just
manipulate<00:04:06.640> those<00:04:06.910> keyframes<00:04:07.660> which<00:04:08.470> makes

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
manipulate those keyframes which makes

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:11.100 
manipulate those keyframes which makes
things<00:04:09.010> a<00:04:09.310> lot<00:04:09.610> easier<00:04:09.930> when<00:04:10.930> you're<00:04:11.080> working

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:11.110 
things a lot easier when you're working

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:13.380 
things a lot easier when you're working
with<00:04:11.590> really<00:04:11.980> advanced<00:04:12.640> rigs<00:04:12.880> that<00:04:13.120> have<00:04:13.360> a

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.390 
with really advanced rigs that have a

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:15.780 
with really advanced rigs that have a
lot<00:04:13.690> of<00:04:13.720> bones<00:04:14.049> just<00:04:14.739> go<00:04:14.860> in<00:04:15.040> and<00:04:15.220> color<00:04:15.400> code

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
lot of bones just go in and color code

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:17.550 
lot of bones just go in and color code
what<00:04:16.120> you<00:04:16.239> need<00:04:16.510> and<00:04:16.750> then

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
what you need and then

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.710 
what you need and then
oh<00:04:17.590> yeah<00:04:18.100> the<00:04:18.370> purple<00:04:18.609> bone<00:04:18.880> that's<00:04:19.269> the<00:04:19.510> hand

00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:19.720 
oh yeah the purple bone that's the hand

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.810 
oh yeah the purple bone that's the hand
bone<00:04:19.930> those<00:04:20.859> are<00:04:21.040> the<00:04:21.100> keyframes<00:04:21.549> for<00:04:21.669> the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
bone those are the keyframes for the

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:23.219 
bone those are the keyframes for the
hand<00:04:22.030> bone<00:04:22.210> and<00:04:22.570> then<00:04:22.720> you<00:04:22.810> could<00:04:22.960> go<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.200> and

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229 
hand bone and then you could go in and

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:25.680 
hand bone and then you could go in and
easily<00:04:23.979> manipulate<00:04:24.610> them<00:04:24.820> delete<00:04:25.150> them<00:04:25.210> copy

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:25.690 
easily manipulate them delete them copy

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:28.320 
easily manipulate them delete them copy
them<00:04:25.960> whatever<00:04:26.500> you<00:04:26.710> need<00:04:27.010> to<00:04:27.160> do<00:04:27.370> so<00:04:28.060> that<00:04:28.090> can

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
them whatever you need to do so that can

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.730 
them whatever you need to do so that can
make<00:04:28.450> organization<00:04:29.350> much<00:04:30.190> more<00:04:30.520> organized

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
make organization much more organized

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:34.440 
make organization much more organized
now<00:04:32.740> the<00:04:32.800> last<00:04:33.070> bone<00:04:33.400> enhancement<00:04:34.000> feature<00:04:34.210> we

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:34.450 
now the last bone enhancement feature we

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:37.260 
now the last bone enhancement feature we
want<00:04:34.570> to<00:04:34.720> show<00:04:34.930> you<00:04:34.990> is<00:04:35.320> called<00:04:36.160> bone<00:04:36.820> labels

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:37.270 
want to show you is called bone labels

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:39.870 
want to show you is called bone labels
and<00:04:37.539> this<00:04:38.110> can<00:04:38.289> make<00:04:38.380> organization<00:04:39.160> like<00:04:39.610> bone

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
and this can make organization like bone

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.200 
and this can make organization like bone
coloring<00:04:40.419> a<00:04:40.600> lot<00:04:41.140> easier<00:04:41.590> as<00:04:41.860> you<00:04:42.669> can<00:04:42.970> see

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
coloring a lot easier as you can see

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:45.330 
coloring a lot easier as you can see
when<00:04:43.780> we<00:04:43.810> click<00:04:44.110> on<00:04:44.229> these<00:04:44.350> bones<00:04:44.680> they<00:04:45.160> have

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
when we click on these bones they have

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.920 
when we click on these bones they have
different<00:04:45.700> labels<00:04:46.090> and<00:04:46.330> this<00:04:46.479> was<00:04:46.690> done

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
different labels and this was done

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.950 
different labels and this was done
previous<00:04:47.890> when<00:04:48.640> we<00:04:48.760> were<00:04:48.910> creating<00:04:49.510> smart

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:49.960 
previous when we were creating smart

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.930 
previous when we were creating smart
bone<00:04:50.200> actions<00:04:50.800> you<00:04:51.039> need<00:04:51.160> labels<00:04:51.430> for<00:04:51.760> those

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
bone actions you need labels for those

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:55.560 
bone actions you need labels for those
but<00:04:52.510> for<00:04:52.720> instance<00:04:53.039> front<00:04:54.039> forearm<00:04:54.520> and<00:04:54.820> you

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:55.570 
but for instance front forearm and you

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:58.320 
but for instance front forearm and you
have<00:04:55.720> different<00:04:56.020> labels<00:04:56.320> here<00:04:57.330> abbreviated

00:04:58.320 --> 00:04:58.330 
have different labels here abbreviated

00:04:58.330 --> 00:04:59.879 
have different labels here abbreviated
that<00:04:58.510> stand<00:04:59.020> for<00:04:59.229> different<00:04:59.350> things<00:04:59.680> with

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
that stand for different things with

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:01.650 
that stand for different things with
this<00:05:00.010> character<00:05:00.460> you<00:05:00.789> could<00:05:00.940> of<00:05:01.060> course<00:05:01.090> be

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:01.660 
this character you could of course be

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:03.180 
this character you could of course be
more<00:05:01.870> elaborate<00:05:02.380> with<00:05:02.470> these<00:05:02.650> labels<00:05:03.010> if<00:05:03.100> you

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
more elaborate with these labels if you

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:05.580 
more elaborate with these labels if you
wanted<00:05:03.520> to<00:05:03.729> but<00:05:04.479> let's<00:05:04.750> say<00:05:04.870> you<00:05:04.930> want<00:05:05.020> to<00:05:05.320> show

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:05.590 
wanted to but let's say you want to show

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:07.500 
wanted to but let's say you want to show
one<00:05:05.860> of<00:05:05.950> these<00:05:06.039> labels<00:05:06.460> you<00:05:07.030> can<00:05:07.060> go<00:05:07.270> up<00:05:07.330> to<00:05:07.419> the

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:07.510 
one of these labels you can go up to the

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.629 
one of these labels you can go up to the
top<00:05:07.720> bar<00:05:07.990> and<00:05:08.020> click<00:05:08.440> show<00:05:08.770> label<00:05:09.190> with<00:05:09.400> that

00:05:09.629 --> 00:05:09.639 
top bar and click show label with that

00:05:09.639 --> 00:05:12.330 
top bar and click show label with that
bone<00:05:09.880> selected<00:05:10.510> and<00:05:10.720> now<00:05:10.840> you<00:05:10.900> have<00:05:11.260> the<00:05:12.010> label

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:12.340 
bone selected and now you have the label

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:16.080 
bone selected and now you have the label
visible<00:05:12.760> on<00:05:12.940> your<00:05:13.690> canvas<00:05:14.080> so<00:05:15.070> this<00:05:15.729> is<00:05:15.880> more

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
visible on your canvas so this is more

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.830 
visible on your canvas so this is more
useful<00:05:16.360> for<00:05:17.550> smart<00:05:18.550> bones<00:05:18.789> as<00:05:19.090> you<00:05:19.270> can<00:05:19.419> see<00:05:19.630> we

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:19.840 
useful for smart bones as you can see we

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.870 
useful for smart bones as you can see we
are<00:05:19.870> on<00:05:20.139> that<00:05:20.260> smart<00:05:20.680> bone<00:05:20.889> layer<00:05:21.130> and<00:05:21.490> if<00:05:21.789> you

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:21.880 
are on that smart bone layer and if you

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:24.420 
are on that smart bone layer and if you
have<00:05:22.000> a<00:05:22.030> lot<00:05:22.330> of<00:05:22.360> smart<00:05:22.810> phone<00:05:23.080> dials<00:05:23.560> putting

00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:24.430 
have a lot of smart phone dials putting

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:26.010 
have a lot of smart phone dials putting
the<00:05:24.520> labels<00:05:24.850> on<00:05:24.970> the<00:05:25.000> canvas<00:05:25.510> will<00:05:25.810> make

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:26.020 
the labels on the canvas will make

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:29.250 
the labels on the canvas will make
things<00:05:26.289> a<00:05:26.410> lot<00:05:26.830> easier<00:05:27.490> because<00:05:28.090> if<00:05:28.990> you<00:05:29.110> have

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:29.260 
things a lot easier because if you have

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:31.740 
things a lot easier because if you have
all<00:05:29.380> these<00:05:29.470> dials<00:05:29.919> without<00:05:30.520> labels<00:05:30.940> it<00:05:31.479> could

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:31.750 
all these dials without labels it could

00:05:31.750 --> 00:05:34.080 
all these dials without labels it could
be<00:05:31.840> kind<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.169> difficult<00:05:32.380> so<00:05:33.190> all<00:05:33.580> you<00:05:33.760> have<00:05:33.910> to

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.090 
be kind of difficult so all you have to

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:36.150 
be kind of difficult so all you have to
do<00:05:34.240> again<00:05:34.660> is<00:05:34.690> select<00:05:35.169> a<00:05:35.260> bone<00:05:35.440> and<00:05:35.740> then<00:05:35.889> click

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:36.160 
do again is select a bone and then click

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.230 
do again is select a bone and then click
show<00:05:36.460> label<00:05:36.849> to<00:05:37.710> see<00:05:38.710> the<00:05:38.890> label<00:05:39.190> now<00:05:39.820> you<00:05:39.909> can

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
show label to see the label now you can

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.240 
show label to see the label now you can
also<00:05:40.419> do<00:05:41.050> this<00:05:41.200> with<00:05:41.260> a<00:05:41.440> bunch<00:05:41.650> of<00:05:41.800> bones<00:05:42.010> at

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:42.250 
also do this with a bunch of bones at

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:42.600 
also do this with a bunch of bones at
one

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
one

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:44.309 
one
we're<00:05:42.849> dis<00:05:43.000> selecting<00:05:43.419> all<00:05:43.599> the<00:05:43.780> bones<00:05:43.990> of<00:05:44.229> the

00:05:44.309 --> 00:05:44.319 
we're dis selecting all the bones of the

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:46.350 
we're dis selecting all the bones of the
select<00:05:44.590> bone<00:05:44.800> tool<00:05:45.039> and<00:05:45.520> clicking<00:05:45.759> show<00:05:46.090> label

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.360 
select bone tool and clicking show label

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.510 
select bone tool and clicking show label
and<00:05:46.659> every<00:05:47.319> bone<00:05:47.500> that<00:05:47.680> has<00:05:47.860> a<00:05:47.889> label<00:05:48.280> will

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:48.520 
and every bone that has a label will

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:51.689 
and every bone that has a label will
then<00:05:48.729> be<00:05:48.879> marked<00:05:49.210> on<00:05:49.360> your<00:05:50.110> character<00:05:50.469> or<00:05:51.129> on

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:51.699 
then be marked on your character or on

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.059 
then be marked on your character or on
your<00:05:51.909> bones<00:05:52.150> if<00:05:52.710> you'd<00:05:53.710> like<00:05:53.860> more
