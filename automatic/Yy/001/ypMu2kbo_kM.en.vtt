00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
of the phone talking of the display on

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.139 
of the phone talking of the display on
the<00:02:00.030> a21<00:02:00.930> it's<00:02:01.409> quite<00:02:01.829> good<00:02:02.460> sharp<00:02:02.939> and

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the a21 it's quite good sharp and

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.510 
the a21 it's quite good sharp and
precise<00:02:03.509> as<00:02:03.780> you<00:02:03.840> can<00:02:04.409> see<00:02:04.619> besides<00:02:05.009> being<00:02:05.399> a

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
precise as you can see besides being a

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.570 
precise as you can see besides being a
480<00:02:06.270> by<00:02:06.390> 800<00:02:06.600> pixels<00:02:07.259> for<00:02:07.560> a<00:02:07.590> solution<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.429> is

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
480 by 800 pixels for a solution it is

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.369 
480 by 800 pixels for a solution it is
quite<00:02:08.940> good<00:02:09.270> and<00:02:09.450> quality<00:02:09.840> is<00:02:09.989> the<00:02:10.110> reason

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
quite good and quality is the reason

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.229 
quite good and quality is the reason
being<00:02:10.530> this<00:02:10.709> size<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.489> screen<00:02:11.760> is<00:02:11.879> small

00:02:12.229 --> 00:02:12.239 
being this size of the screen is small

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.090 
being this size of the screen is small
which<00:02:12.720> is<00:02:12.750> 4.5<00:02:13.410> inch

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
which is 4.5 inch

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.730 
which is 4.5 inch
so<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.280> pixel<00:02:14.490> intensity<00:02:14.850> is<00:02:15.390> 207<00:02:16.110> VPI<00:02:16.440> which

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
so the pixel intensity is 207 VPI which

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.330 
so the pixel intensity is 207 VPI which
gives<00:02:17.130> it<00:02:17.280> a<00:02:17.430> nice<00:02:18.410> overall<00:02:19.410> visual<00:02:19.920> appeal

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
gives it a nice overall visual appeal

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:28.850 
gives it a nice overall visual appeal
I'll<00:02:20.940> also<00:02:21.120> play<00:02:21.450> a<00:02:21.480> video<00:02:21.810> for<00:02:21.990> you<00:02:22.110> here<00:02:27.860> so

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
quality is also good and the sound

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.880 
quality is also good and the sound
playback<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.630> the<00:02:33.750> video<00:02:33.990> is<00:02:34.110> also<00:02:34.380> quite<00:02:34.590> nice

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
buttons and the touch screen experience

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.850 
buttons and the touch screen experience
it<00:03:58.830> is<00:03:58.950> quite<00:03:59.310> easy<00:03:59.610> to<00:04:00.360> operate<00:04:00.480> this<00:04:00.840> for<00:04:01.110> the

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:01.860 
it is quite easy to operate this for the

job the sound quality on calls is also

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:18.830 
job the sound quality on calls is also
quite<00:04:17.040> decent<00:04:17.460> even<00:04:18.030> in<00:04:18.210> the<00:04:18.330> speakerphone

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840

hours<00:04:40.490> of<00:04:40.819> talktime<00:04:41.120> on<00:04:41.599> a<00:04:42.169> normal<00:04:42.500> usage<00:04:42.860> it

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:43.250 
hours of talktime on a normal usage it

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:46.330 
hours of talktime on a normal usage it
will<00:04:43.430> last<00:04:43.699> almost<00:04:44.030> one<00:04:44.509> full<00:04:44.780> day<00:04:44.990> but<00:04:45.680> I<00:04:45.889> find

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
will last almost one full day but I find

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:49.270 
will last almost one full day but I find
