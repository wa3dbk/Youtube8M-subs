00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
the big thing to remember is is that you

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.780 
the big thing to remember is is that you
can't<00:01:13.049> explain<00:01:13.409> anything<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.189> a<00:01:14.220> dog<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.729> you

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
can't explain anything to a dog so you

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.130 
can't explain anything to a dog so you
have<00:01:14.970> to<00:01:15.119> use<00:01:15.240> body<00:01:15.509> language<00:01:15.990> and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
have to use body language and

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.560 
have to use body language and
reinforcement<00:01:16.950> to<00:01:17.520> communicate<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.180> that<00:01:18.210> dog

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
reinforcement to communicate to that dog

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.320
