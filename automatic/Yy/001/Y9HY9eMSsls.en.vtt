00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.060 
sanding process and this is kind of how
it<00:01:43.640> works<00:01:44.060> just<00:01:45.050> to<00:01:45.170> kind<00:01:45.380> of<00:01:45.410> let<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.650> know<00:01:45.680> I

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
it works just to kind of let you know I

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.450 
it works just to kind of let you know I
concentrate<00:01:47.030> on<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.390> edges<00:01:47.900> and<00:01:48.890> we're<00:01:49.250> a

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
concentrate on the edges and we're a

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.790 
concentrate on the edges and we're a
natural<00:01:50.450> wear<00:01:50.720> pattern<00:01:51.140> would<00:01:51.290> be<00:01:51.500> in<00:01:51.710> a

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:51.800 
natural wear pattern would be in a

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.410 
natural wear pattern would be in a
furniture<00:01:52.310> you<00:01:52.790> want<00:01:52.970> this<00:01:53.060> to<00:01:53.240> look

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
furniture you want this to look

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:55.180 
furniture you want this to look
authentic<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:54.110> is<00:01:54.200> a<00:01:54.230> faux<00:01:54.530> finish<00:01:54.800> but<00:01:55.160> you

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
authentic it is a faux finish but you

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:58.180 
authentic it is a faux finish but you
don't<00:01:55.460> want<00:01:55.670> it<00:01:55.730> to<00:01:55.850> look<00:01:56.030> too<00:01:56.500> faux<00:01:57.500> finish<00:01:58.010> do

don't want it to look too faux finish do

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.080 
don't want it to look too faux finish do
you<00:01:58.280> want<00:01:58.460> it<00:01:58.520> to<00:01:58.640> look<00:01:58.730> like<00:01:58.790> it<00:01:59.060> was

cover up a multitude of sins from this
the<00:02:27.110> entire<00:02:27.349> process<00:02:27.890> so<00:02:27.920> here<00:02:28.310> we<00:02:28.430> go

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.050 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.110 

just<00:02:35.590> to<00:02:35.710> show<00:02:35.920> you<00:02:35.980> guys<00:02:36.310> this<00:02:36.640> is<00:02:36.820> kind<00:02:37.060> of

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:37.120 
just to show you guys this is kind of

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.510 
just to show you guys this is kind of
how<00:02:37.210> it<00:02:37.330> works<00:02:37.570> and<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.380> also<00:02:38.680> have<00:02:39.010> primer<00:02:39.370> on

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:39.520 
how it works and I also have primer on

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.070 
how it works and I also have primer on
this<00:02:39.670> you<00:02:39.850> can<00:02:39.940> see<00:02:40.120> the<00:02:40.240> white<00:02:40.450> is<00:02:40.630> the<00:02:40.780> primer

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this you can see the white is the primer

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.290 
this you can see the white is the primer
and<00:02:41.410> then<00:02:41.890> the<00:02:41.980> brown<00:02:42.220> is<00:02:42.490> right<00:02:42.760> down<00:02:43.000> to<00:02:43.210> the

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:43.300 
and then the brown is right down to the

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.120 
and then the brown is right down to the
wood<00:02:43.510> I'm<00:02:43.780> going<00:02:44.020> to<00:02:44.170> continue<00:02:44.500> doing<00:02:44.680> this

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:45.130 
wood I'm going to continue doing this

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.470 
wood I'm going to continue doing this
for<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.430> little<00:02:45.610> while<00:02:45.730> and<00:02:45.850> get<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.060> all<00:02:46.180> done

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
for a little while and get it all done

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.210 
for a little while and get it all done
but<00:02:47.080> and<00:02:47.260> this<00:02:47.410> is<00:02:47.530> just<00:02:47.710> kind<00:02:47.950> of<00:02:48.010> how<00:02:48.160> the

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
but and this is just kind of how the

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.250 
but and this is just kind of how the
process<00:02:48.790> starts<00:02:49.330> and<00:02:49.510> you'll<00:02:49.660> just<00:02:49.810> do<00:02:49.990> again

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260 
process starts and you'll just do again

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.110 
process starts and you'll just do again
your<00:02:50.440> edges<00:02:50.830> and<00:02:50.980> your<00:02:51.130> your<00:02:51.520> places<00:02:51.910> that

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
your edges and your your places that

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:54.000 
your edges and your your places that
your<00:02:52.240> natural<00:02:52.810> wear<00:02:53.050> would<00:02:53.530> happen<00:02:53.890> on<00:02:53.980> a

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
your natural wear would happen on a

00:02:54.010 --> 00:03:02.370 
your natural wear would happen on a
piece<00:02:59.250> okay<00:03:00.250> we<00:03:00.820> have<00:03:01.060> gone<00:03:01.300> ahead<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.630> sanded

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
piece okay we have gone ahead and sanded

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:04.530 
piece okay we have gone ahead and sanded
this<00:03:02.530> step<00:03:02.770> and<00:03:03.010> as<00:03:03.640> you<00:03:03.790> can<00:03:03.970> tell<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.180> really

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
this step and as you can tell I really

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.810 
this step and as you can tell I really
concentrated<00:03:05.170> on<00:03:05.290> my<00:03:05.410> corners<00:03:05.830> did<00:03:06.580> a<00:03:06.610> couple

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
concentrated on my corners did a couple

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.270 
concentrated on my corners did a couple
of<00:03:07.030> little<00:03:07.150> age<00:03:07.510> spots<00:03:08.050> where<00:03:08.830> the<00:03:08.980> hardware

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
of little age spots where the hardware

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.760 
of little age spots where the hardware
will<00:03:09.580> go<00:03:09.700> back<00:03:10.020> and<00:03:11.020> just<00:03:11.260> really<00:03:11.500> kind<00:03:11.650> of

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
will go back and just really kind of

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.920 
will go back and just really kind of
give<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:11.980> good<00:03:12.160> rough<00:03:12.490> at<00:03:12.670> one<00:03:13.600> thing<00:03:13.780> I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
give you that good rough at one thing I

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.750 
give you that good rough at one thing I
did<00:03:14.200> forget<00:03:14.500> to<00:03:14.680> mention<00:03:14.800> earlier<00:03:15.370> is<00:03:15.460> when

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
did forget to mention earlier is when

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:16.920 
did forget to mention earlier is when
you're<00:03:15.910> using<00:03:16.150> your<00:03:16.300> sander

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
you're using your sander

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.920 
you're using your sander
try<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.440> use<00:03:17.680> really<00:03:17.980> an<00:03:18.370> even<00:03:18.940> pressure<00:03:19.210> or

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
try to use really an even pressure or

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.660 
try to use really an even pressure or
you'll<00:03:20.140> your<00:03:20.380> paint<00:03:20.650> will<00:03:20.770> kind<00:03:21.040> of<00:03:21.100> ball<00:03:21.370> up

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
you'll your paint will kind of ball up

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.160 
you'll your paint will kind of ball up
and<00:03:21.910> then<00:03:22.390> you'll<00:03:22.510> have<00:03:22.630> to<00:03:22.750> stay<00:03:22.960> in<00:03:22.990> that

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:23.170 
and then you'll have to stay in that

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.350 
and then you'll have to stay in that
whole<00:03:23.380> ball<00:03:23.620> of<00:03:23.830> paint<00:03:24.130> off<00:03:24.400> which<00:03:24.880> is<00:03:25.030> kind<00:03:25.300> of

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:25.360 
whole ball of paint off which is kind of

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.720 
whole ball of paint off which is kind of
another<00:03:25.630> issue<00:03:26.410> that<00:03:26.800> you<00:03:26.890> can<00:03:27.040> avoid<00:03:27.310> and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
another issue that you can avoid and

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.820 
another issue that you can avoid and
after<00:03:28.360> you<00:03:28.450> get<00:03:28.540> it<00:03:28.660> all<00:03:28.780> sanded<00:03:29.200> and<00:03:29.440> then<00:03:29.770> I

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:29.830 
after you get it all sanded and then I

kind of a nice look you can kind of see

00:05:31.029 --> 00:05:32.429 
kind of a nice look you can kind of see
what<00:05:31.150> it's<00:05:31.270> done<00:05:31.449> now<00:05:31.659> if<00:05:31.810> I'd<00:05:31.930> let<00:05:32.139> it<00:05:32.229> sit<00:05:32.409> a

00:05:32.429 --> 00:05:32.439 
what it's done now if I'd let it sit a

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.779 
what it's done now if I'd let it sit a
little<00:05:32.529> longer<00:05:32.919> it<00:05:33.069> would<00:05:33.159> go<00:05:33.310> even<00:05:33.490> deeper

00:05:33.779 --> 00:05:33.789 
little longer it would go even deeper

00:05:33.789 --> 00:05:35.969 
little longer it would go even deeper
but<00:05:34.569> this<00:05:34.719> is<00:05:34.900> the<00:05:34.990> process<00:05:35.439> this<00:05:35.620> is<00:05:35.680> how<00:05:35.800> we

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:35.979 
but this is the process this is how we

00:05:35.979 --> 00:05:38.189 
but this is the process this is how we
do<00:05:36.250> it<00:05:36.430> you<00:05:36.639> would<00:05:37.150> finish<00:05:37.300> your<00:05:37.569> entire<00:05:37.689> piece

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
do it you would finish your entire piece

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.439 
do it you would finish your entire piece
just<00:05:38.620> like<00:05:38.800> I've<00:05:38.949> showed<00:05:39.250> you<00:05:39.400> here<00:05:39.669> and<00:05:39.849> then

00:05:40.439 --> 00:05:40.449 
just like I've showed you here and then

00:05:40.449 --> 00:05:42.600 
just like I've showed you here and then
after<00:05:40.689> it's<00:05:40.870> dried<00:05:41.289> for<00:05:41.529> a<00:05:41.590> few<00:05:41.800> hours<00:05:41.830> or<00:05:42.580> even

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:42.610 
after it's dried for a few hours or even

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.899 
after it's dried for a few hours or even
overnight<00:05:42.969> I<00:05:43.629> would<00:05:44.080> go<00:05:44.169> ahead<00:05:44.289> and<00:05:44.759> steal<00:05:45.759> it

00:05:45.899 --> 00:05:45.909 
overnight I would go ahead and steal it

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.820 
overnight I would go ahead and steal it
off<00:05:46.029> with<00:05:46.300> a<00:05:46.330> polyurethane<00:05:46.719> I<00:05:47.349> like<00:05:47.529> to<00:05:47.680> use<00:05:47.800> a

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:47.830 
off with a polyurethane I like to use a

00:05:47.830 --> 00:05:50.459 
off with a polyurethane I like to use a
satin<00:05:48.279> finish<00:05:48.460> on<00:05:48.759> line<00:05:49.020> but<00:05:50.020> just<00:05:50.050> give<00:05:50.319> it<00:05:50.409> a

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:50.469 
satin finish on line but just give it a

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:52.769 
satin finish on line but just give it a
good<00:05:50.589> steel<00:05:50.949> to<00:05:51.219> kind<00:05:51.400> of<00:05:51.460> protect<00:05:51.879> that<00:05:52.360> stain

00:05:52.769 --> 00:05:52.779 
good steel to kind of protect that stain

00:05:52.779 --> 00:05:54.930 
good steel to kind of protect that stain
because<00:05:52.990> stain<00:05:53.440> wood<00:05:53.770> is<00:05:54.009> actually<00:05:54.190> just<00:05:54.550> raw

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:54.940 
because stain wood is actually just raw

00:05:54.940 --> 00:05:58.529 
because stain wood is actually just raw
wood<00:05:55.449> and<00:05:55.779> it<00:05:56.620> can<00:05:56.860> still<00:05:57.190> have<00:05:57.909> things<00:05:58.180> happen

00:05:58.529 --> 00:05:58.539 
wood and it can still have things happen

00:05:58.539 --> 00:06:00.930 
wood and it can still have things happen
to<00:05:58.719> it<00:05:58.870> and<00:05:59.860> just<00:06:00.279> you<00:06:00.370> just<00:06:00.460> want<00:06:00.639> to<00:06:00.699> steal<00:06:00.909> it

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:00.940 
to it and just you just want to steal it

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:02.670 
to it and just you just want to steal it
off<00:06:01.180> to<00:06:01.389> protect<00:06:01.569> it<00:06:01.960> but<00:06:02.409> this<00:06:02.500> is<00:06:02.650> the

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
off to protect it but this is the

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.379 
off to protect it but this is the
process<00:06:03.190> this<00:06:03.339> is<00:06:03.520> how<00:06:03.550> it<00:06:03.789> looks<00:06:04.029> you<00:06:04.270> can
