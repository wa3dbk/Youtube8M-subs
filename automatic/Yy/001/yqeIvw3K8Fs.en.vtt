first<00:02:02.880> attempt<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.630> then<00:02:04.020> they<00:02:04.229> looked<00:02:04.500> at<00:02:04.740> it

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
first attempt and then they looked at it

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.240 
first attempt and then they looked at it
and<00:02:05.189> they<00:02:06.149> decided<00:02:06.540> it's<00:02:06.899> too<00:02:07.170> blocky<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.890> day

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
and they decided it's too blocky so day

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.820 
and they decided it's too blocky so day

you<00:02:10.950> know<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.190> guy<00:02:11.280> who<00:02:11.340> gave<00:02:11.550> us<00:02:11.730> these

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
you know the guy who gave us these

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.790 
you know the guy who gave us these
things

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
things

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.510 
things
and<00:02:14.210> asked<00:02:15.210> him<00:02:15.450> to<00:02:15.800> refined<00:02:16.800> model<00:02:17.100> into

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
and asked him to refined model into

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.090 
and asked him to refined model into
something<00:02:17.940> more<00:02:18.240> slim<00:02:18.810> and<00:02:19.110> aerodynamic<00:02:19.920> and

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:20.100 
something more slim and aerodynamic and

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.770 
something more slim and aerodynamic and
the<00:02:20.490> result<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:20.910> this<00:02:21.210> thing<00:02:21.480> which<00:02:21.750> is

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
the result is this thing which is

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:24.080 
the result is this thing which is
actually<00:02:22.080> the<00:02:22.350> second<00:02:22.800> version<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.400> this<00:02:23.700> mold

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
actually the second version of this mold

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.920 
actually the second version of this mold
and<00:02:25.100> this<00:02:26.100> works<00:02:26.370> kind<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.940> like<00:02:27.000> the<00:02:27.750> history

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
and this works kind of like the history

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:31.670 
and this works kind of like the history
behind<00:02:28.610> generations<00:02:29.610> track<00:02:30.410> Wheeljack<00:02:31.410> and

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
behind generations track Wheeljack and

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
behind generations track Wheeljack and
artiest<00:02:32.250> track<00:02:32.550> so<00:02:32.790> that<00:02:32.820> this<00:02:33.120> one<00:02:33.360> was

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
artiest track so that this one was

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.230 
artiest track so that this one was
released<00:02:33.840> first<00:02:34.110> however<00:02:35.040> actually<00:02:35.640> this<00:02:35.970> is

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:36.240 
released first however actually this is

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.240 
released first however actually this is
the<00:02:36.660> base<00:02:36.900> model<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.620> when<00:02:37.860> this<00:02:38.040> was

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:38.250 
the base model and when this was

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:40.400 
the base model and when this was
developed<00:02:38.730> hasbro<00:02:39.420> asked<00:02:39.750> to<00:02:39.840> cara<00:02:40.020> if<00:02:40.230> they

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
developed hasbro asked to cara if they

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.370 
developed hasbro asked to cara if they
could<00:02:40.620> somehow<00:02:41.490> make<00:02:42.270> tracks<00:02:42.720> out<00:02:42.930> of<00:02:43.110> it<00:02:43.200> and

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
could somehow make tracks out of it and

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.230 
could somehow make tracks out of it and
they<00:02:43.470> said<00:02:43.680> yes<00:02:43.860> and<00:02:44.310> I<00:02:44.700> don't<00:02:45.000> know<00:02:45.060> through

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 
they said yes and I don't know through

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.300 
they said yes and I don't know through
some<00:02:45.530> management<00:02:46.530> decisions<00:02:46.980> this<00:02:47.130> was

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
some management decisions this was

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.640 
some management decisions this was
released<00:02:47.550> first<00:02:47.760> but<00:02:48.030> really<00:02:48.390> this<00:02:49.260> was<00:02:49.470> the

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
released first but really this was the

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:51.560 
released first but really this was the
base<00:02:49.890> design<00:02:50.340> that<00:02:50.670> both<00:02:51.090> of<00:02:51.120> these<00:02:51.330> are

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
base design that both of these are

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
base design that both of these are
working<00:02:51.990> on<00:02:52.140> and<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.860> same<00:02:53.040> thing<00:02:53.310> goes<00:02:53.670> with

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
working on and the same thing goes with

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.300 
working on and the same thing goes with

remoulded<00:02:56.970> this<00:02:57.090> into<00:02:57.360> defeat<00:02:57.660> this<00:02:57.900> thing

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:58.140 
remoulded this into defeat this thing

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.040 
remoulded this into defeat this thing
and<00:02:58.410> for<00:02:58.710> some<00:02:58.980> reason<00:02:59.720> they<00:03:00.720> thought<00:03:00.900> it<00:03:01.020> was

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
and for some reason they thought it was

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.720 
and for some reason they thought it was
the<00:03:01.260> better<00:03:01.440> version<00:03:01.530> salty<00:03:02.130> released<00:03:02.400> first

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
the better version salty released first

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:04.400 
the better version salty released first
but<00:03:03.120> fans<00:03:03.480> complained<00:03:03.870> about<00:03:03.960> for<00:03:04.350> example

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
but fans complained about for example

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.010 
but fans complained about for example
leaks<00:03:04.890> fingies<00:03:05.370> so<00:03:05.700> they'd<00:03:05.940> sighs<00:03:06.210> oh<00:03:06.390> hell<00:03:06.750> if

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
leaks fingies so they'd sighs oh hell if

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.440

we<00:03:07.620> are<00:03:07.650> making<00:03:07.890> a<00:03:08.070> new<00:03:08.190> remote<00:03:08.490> why<00:03:08.730> not<00:03:09.030> just

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:09.450 
we are making a new remote why not just

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.750 
we are making a new remote why not just
use<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.930> base<00:03:10.140> design<00:03:10.650> that<00:03:11.040> we<00:03:11.190> had<00:03:11.400> years

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
use the base design that we had years

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.430 
use the base design that we had years
before<00:03:11.820> so<00:03:12.360> when<00:03:12.540> people<00:03:12.690> for<00:03:12.960> example<00:03:13.050> say

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:13.440 
before so when people for example say

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.880 
before so when people for example say
data<00:03:13.700> their<00:03:14.700> heel<00:03:15.120> spurs<00:03:15.450> back<00:03:15.990> here<00:03:16.470> when<00:03:16.770> not

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:16.890 
data their heel spurs back here when not

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:18.470 
data their heel spurs back here when not
implementing<00:03:17.400> this<00:03:17.610> one<00:03:17.820> and<00:03:18.060> that<00:03:18.090> prays

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
implementing this one and that prays

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.770 
implementing this one and that prays
that<00:03:18.510> the<00:03:19.130> new<00:03:20.130> version<00:03:20.610> has<00:03:21.000> them<00:03:21.270> saying<00:03:21.540> why

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
that the new version has them saying why

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.240 
that the new version has them saying why
did<00:03:22.020> think<00:03:22.230> could<00:03:22.470> not<00:03:22.680> think<00:03:22.890> about<00:03:23.040> the

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
did think could not think about the

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:26.330 
did think could not think about the
years<00:03:23.610> before<00:03:23.700> well<00:03:24.600> actually<00:03:24.810> did<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.530> Carl

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
years before well actually did it Carl

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.130 
years before well actually did it Carl
Morey<00:03:26.550> just<00:03:26.640> skipped<00:03:27.270> it<00:03:27.390> from<00:03:27.600> his<00:03:27.840> version

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
Morey just skipped it from his version

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:31.699 
Morey just skipped it from his version
which<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.739> could<00:03:28.920> buy<00:03:29.100> first<00:03:29.690> so<00:03:30.690> yeah<00:03:30.930> this<00:03:31.410> is

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709 
which we could buy first so yeah this is

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.760 
which we could buy first so yeah this is
the<00:03:32.540> second<00:03:33.540> version<00:03:33.900> that<00:03:34.230> got<00:03:34.440> released

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
the second version that got released

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:37.160 
the second version that got released
first<00:03:35.250> it<00:03:35.700> might<00:03:36.000> be<00:03:36.150> confusing<00:03:36.540> but<00:03:36.870> that's

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
first it might be confusing but that's

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.250 
first it might be confusing but that's
the<00:03:37.320> truth<00:03:37.500> so<00:03:37.920> if<00:03:38.370> any<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.090> you<00:03:39.630> are<00:03:39.870> listening

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
the truth so if any of you are listening

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.229 
the truth so if any of you are listening
to<00:03:40.380> reviewers<00:03:40.680> saying<00:03:41.010> that<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.430> NP<00:03:41.730> 11<00:03:42.030> is

00:03:42.229 --> 00:03:42.239 
to reviewers saying that the NP 11 is

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:44.900 
to reviewers saying that the NP 11 is
the<00:03:42.270> remould<00:03:42.989> of<00:03:43.260> this<00:03:43.530> guy<00:03:43.709> no<00:03:44.250> really<00:03:44.640> that's

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910 
the remould of this guy no really that's

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.530 
the remould of this guy no really that's
the<00:03:45.239> other<00:03:45.360> way<00:03:45.540> around<00:03:45.980> this<00:03:46.980> is<00:03:47.310> the<00:03:48.090> remould

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
the other way around this is the remould

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.110 
the other way around this is the remould
