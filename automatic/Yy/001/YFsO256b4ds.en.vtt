I<00:00:05.000> don't<00:00:06.000> believe<00:00:06.210> me<00:00:06.450> when<00:00:06.600> you<00:00:06.629> go<00:00:06.779> to<00:00:06.839> the

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:06.960 
I don't believe me when you go to the

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:09.860 
I don't believe me when you go to the
gas<00:00:07.170> pump<00:00:07.200> but<00:00:07.830> actually<00:00:08.580> it's<00:00:08.760> true<00:00:09.000> cars<00:00:09.480> are

I'm<00:00:13.380> Brian<00:00:13.860> Cooley<00:00:14.280> with<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.519> top-five

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
I'm Brian Cooley with the top-five

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.930 
I'm Brian Cooley with the top-five
latest<00:00:15.599> reasons<00:00:16.020> why<00:00:16.440> that's<00:00:16.800> the<00:00:17.070> case<00:00:17.310> we're

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
latest reasons why that's the case we're

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.000 
latest reasons why that's the case we're
gonna<00:00:18.029> rank<00:00:18.449> these<00:00:18.630> guys<00:00:18.960> by<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.320> percentage

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
gonna rank these guys by the percentage

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.310 
gonna rank these guys by the percentage
improvement<00:00:20.220> each<00:00:20.850> one<00:00:21.090> is<00:00:21.240> made<00:00:21.420> in<00:00:21.689> how<00:00:22.140> much

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
improvement each one is made in how much

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.920 
improvement each one is made in how much
your<00:00:22.560> car<00:00:22.859> guzzles<00:00:23.460> number<00:00:24.359> five<00:00:24.630> a

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
your car guzzles number five a

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.130 
your car guzzles number five a
multi-stage<00:00:25.859> oil<00:00:26.250> pump<00:00:26.820> total<00:00:27.539> savings<00:00:27.990> about

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
multi-stage oil pump total savings about

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:29.900 
multi-stage oil pump total savings about
one<00:00:28.529> percent<00:00:29.039> yeah<00:00:29.220> we're<00:00:29.460> starting<00:00:29.609> small

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:29.910 
one percent yeah we're starting small

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:30.529 
one percent yeah we're starting small
here

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
here

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.690 
here
the<00:00:30.779> idea<00:00:31.199> here<00:00:31.470> is<00:00:31.500> an<00:00:31.650> oil<00:00:31.949> pump<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.460> only

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
the idea here is an oil pump that only

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.290 
the idea here is an oil pump that only
pumps<00:00:33.210> as<00:00:33.329> much<00:00:33.480> oil<00:00:33.660> as<00:00:34.110> the<00:00:34.320> engine<00:00:34.680> needs

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:35.300 
pumps as much oil as the engine needs

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.970 
pumps as much oil as the engine needs
radical<00:00:36.300> idea<00:00:36.660> because<00:00:37.050> most<00:00:37.380> oil<00:00:37.739> pumps

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
radical idea because most oil pumps

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.069 
radical idea because most oil pumps
today<00:00:38.190> are<00:00:38.399> dumb<00:00:38.790> and<00:00:39.149> they<00:00:39.360> just<00:00:39.600> pump<00:00:39.780> more

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
today are dumb and they just pump more

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.770 
today are dumb and they just pump more
oil<00:00:40.140> as<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.980> engine<00:00:41.430> revs<00:00:41.730> higher<00:00:42.030> not<00:00:42.420> as<00:00:42.600> it

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
oil as the engine revs higher not as it

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.500 
oil as the engine revs higher not as it
needs<00:00:43.079> more<00:00:43.530> oil<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:44.219> lubrication<00:00:44.700> the

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
needs more oil and lubrication the

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.660 
needs more oil and lubrication the
upside<00:00:45.930> here<00:00:46.260> is<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.860> engine<00:00:47.010> spends<00:00:47.430> less

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:47.670 
upside here is the engine spends less

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.880 
upside here is the engine spends less
time<00:00:47.730> turning<00:00:48.450> all<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:48.840> load<00:00:49.079> against<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.649> pump

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
time turning all the load against a pump

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.860 
time turning all the load against a pump
and<00:00:50.070> more<00:00:50.610> of<00:00:50.700> its<00:00:50.820> fuel<00:00:51.090> moving<00:00:51.570> your<00:00:51.660> car

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
and more of its fuel moving your car

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.450 
and more of its fuel moving your car
down<00:00:52.110> the<00:00:52.230> road<00:00:52.410> which<00:00:52.800> is<00:00:52.890> what<00:00:53.010> you<00:00:53.100> want<00:00:53.370> it

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
down the road which is what you want it

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.380 
down the road which is what you want it
to<00:00:53.579> do<00:00:53.730> number<00:00:54.600> four<00:00:54.840> CV<00:00:55.530> tees<00:00:55.770> and<00:00:56.090> dcts

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:57.390 
to do number four CV tees and dcts

00:00:57.390 --> 00:00:59.110 
to do number four CV tees and dcts
six<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.809> seven<00:00:58.109> percent<00:00:58.260> improvement

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
six to seven percent improvement

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.369 
six to seven percent improvement
continuously<00:01:00.120> variable<00:01:00.660> transmission

that's<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.590> first<00:01:01.800> one<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.129> dual<00:01:02.579> clutch

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.710 
transmission that's the second one have
become<00:01:04.979> much<00:01:05.220> more<00:01:05.489> common<00:01:05.820> lately<00:01:06.270> the
