these are pre-cut habanero peppers it's
going<00:00:37.410> to<00:00:37.500> make<00:00:37.620> these<00:00:37.860> garlic<00:00:38.520> cloves<00:00:38.930> really

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
going to make these garlic cloves really

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.310 
going to make these garlic cloves really
hot<00:00:40.170> in<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.379> long<00:00:40.590> run<00:00:40.920> and<00:00:41.660> like<00:00:42.660> I<00:00:42.840> said<00:00:42.899> when

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
hot in the long run and like I said when

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.830 
hot in the long run and like I said when
you<00:00:43.379> pickle<00:00:43.829> these<00:00:44.219> garlic's<00:00:44.879> you<00:00:45.510> want<00:00:45.690> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
you pickle these garlic's you want to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.680 
you pickle these garlic's you want to
use<00:00:46.020> about<00:00:46.230> a<00:00:46.820> 66<00:00:47.930> to<00:00:48.930> 70<00:00:49.350> percent<00:00:50.690> vinegar

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
use about a 66 to 70 percent vinegar

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.900 
use about a 66 to 70 percent vinegar
solution<00:00:52.050> otherwise<00:00:52.559> they<00:00:52.949> will<00:00:53.190> rot

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
solution otherwise they will rot

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.840 
solution otherwise they will rot
so<00:00:54.329> basically<00:00:55.020> we're<00:00:55.320> probably<00:00:55.710> at<00:00:55.949> about<00:00:56.219> 80%

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
so basically we're probably at about 80%

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.920 
so basically we're probably at about 80%
there<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:58.199> is<00:00:58.350> letting<00:00:58.680> purified<00:00:59.340> water<00:00:59.930> put

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
there so is letting purified water put

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.189 
there so is letting purified water put
the<00:01:01.050> cap<00:01:01.289> on<00:01:01.530> give<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.250> slight<00:01:02.579> squeeze<00:01:03.199> to

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
the cap on give it a slight squeeze to

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.490 
the cap on give it a slight squeeze to
raise<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.589> water<00:01:04.830> level<00:01:05.930> so<00:01:06.930> you<00:01:07.020> get<00:01:07.200> it<00:01:07.290> back

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
raise the water level so you get it back

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.550 
raise the water level so you get it back
to<00:01:07.740> going<00:01:08.070> and<00:01:08.280> really<00:01:09.240> tighten<00:01:09.689> that<00:01:09.990> puppy

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
to going and really tighten that puppy

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.870 
to going and really tighten that puppy
on<00:01:10.710> there<00:01:10.979> because<00:01:11.189> these<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.390> going<00:01:12.540> to<00:01:12.750> bed

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
on there because these are going to bed

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.420 
on there because these are going to bed
for<00:01:14.880> about<00:01:14.939> two<00:01:15.330> months<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.229> you<00:01:17.159> give<00:01:17.310> them<00:01:17.400> a

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
for about two months and you give them a

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.020 
for about two months and you give them a
quick<00:01:17.640> shakin<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:19.280> that's<00:01:20.280> basically<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
quick shakin and that's basically it

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.160 
quick shakin and that's basically it
that's<00:01:21.900> how<00:01:22.259> I<00:01:22.320> make<00:01:22.770> my<00:01:23.040> special<00:01:24.170> pickled
