00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 helplessness is spoken in the studio 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.690
 partner like helpless leaves looks in this 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.719
 back I believe what a coach needs 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:11.700
 we always analyze that very clearly 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:14.040
 have a deflected free kick goal 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.190
 Then I think the second goal 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:19.020
 to keep more of the german me 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.380
 think there is a little something encountered 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.420
 been 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:24.390
 At least he said I also share 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.210
 not exactly the opinion of heinz 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.199
 lindner that's my opinion 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.090
 from a player 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:31.769
 I think that's right 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.050
 that one or the other is not today 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:37.469
 We gave full throttle from the start 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.030
 were more dominant from the start 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.520
 then have eased off at half-time 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.329
 We addressed that as well 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.390
 changed 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.039
 I think you have seen that one 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.020
 equal wanted to close the through the 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:51.300
 connection met us and then succeeded 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.100
 we ran the whole second 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.989
 half-time and unfortunately no longer have that 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.520
 There is a lot of bad luck there 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.710
 but that counts in such a 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.660
 situation little if not everyone everything 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:03.019
 know that klop before his partie 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:05.400
 yes me, I think then you have to 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:07.049
 we all need to ask as I behind 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.960
 coaches are in the first row 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.970
 of course and I'm responsible for that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.930
 and then we changed then 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.700
 it went better 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.170
 it was also a lot of bad luck that one has to 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.020
 but also in the situation where we say 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.580
 at the moment, only the points and count 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.259
 We did not do that for you 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.210
 really how bad it got 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.229
 double today 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.020
 Of course, it is bad if you are 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.180
 2 2 but if you lose it 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:31.950
 analyzed exactly then the first was there 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:34.369
 once again deflected the second was 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:36.000
 I believe in you had better clarify 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:38.189
 So she gets two 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.200
 standard situations gates and then run 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.939
 you of course a 20 after that, of course 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.560
 away against the admira not so 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:45.119
 was easy 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.530
 one has seen that too 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.720
 But yes , they were still ok 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.280
 have brought the result 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:53.060
 they have two goals by the standards 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:58.469
 just warned me against that 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.270
 yes no yes that that comes in now 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.920
 there is such a situation 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.899
 not nothing to gloss over 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.460
 but of course you have already seen 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:07.560
 that we had the second thanks to are 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.780
 have tried everything you had too 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.150
 the possibilities and yes as I said 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:14.340
 that has brought me the rounds 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:14.700
 Result and there was also good luck 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.560
 there 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.110
 jörg baumgärtner the exit tenth 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.760
 whole larger than life now yes that will be 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.800
 you see if it survives so I have 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.739
 even ideas how to get out there 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.450
 can and of course I mean mine 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:31.849
 As a trainer I always have that 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:34.260
 of course, and of course already 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:36.900
 I think we have a critical situation 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.069
 will also come out of it because of me 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:39.390
 Still wanted team again 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.190
 especially second half 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:42.810
 who played here on a goal and 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:44.730
 you feel good even if it is 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.010
 are their person for their position 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.760
 no, then of course you have to 

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.190
 stay annually 

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.050
 There is no good feeling there 

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:53.970
 also one or the other sleepless 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.980
 night so there you do not need 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.590
 gloss over that is beinhart the job of 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:03:00.980
 therefore , of course, is also on the 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:03.209
 most of the substance to come through 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.250
 yes you will see that I can not 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.980
 So maybe other people answer 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:10.230
 to decide but I am not one of the 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:11.819
 give up and I know how we are there 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.790
 come out or I think I know ever 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:16.409
 more come out and I mean no matter 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.470
 what happens i thank you for that 

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.470
