00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:04.759 
all righty I'm going to show you guys

00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:10.190 
all righty I'm going to show you guys
high<00:00:05.759> idle<00:00:06.089> switches<00:00:06.480> and<00:00:07.340> obd2<00:00:08.870> that<00:00:09.870> is<00:00:10.019> to

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
high idle switches and obd2 that is to

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.129 
high idle switches and obd2 that is to
say<00:00:10.410> 96<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> 2000<00:00:12.740> 6.5<00:00:13.740> diesel<00:00:14.900> here's<00:00:15.900> my

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
say 96 to 2000 6.5 diesel here's my

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.760 
say 96 to 2000 6.5 diesel here's my
switches<00:00:16.760> they<00:00:17.760> are<00:00:18.350> backwards<00:00:19.350> of<00:00:19.560> where<00:00:19.740> I

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:19.770 
switches they are backwards of where I

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.710 
switches they are backwards of where I
want<00:00:20.039> them<00:00:20.220> to<00:00:20.250> be<00:00:20.460> but<00:00:21.390> they<00:00:21.900> still<00:00:22.109> work<00:00:22.289> so

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:23.720 
want them to be but they still work so

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.220 
want them to be but they still work so
behind<00:00:25.609> your<00:00:26.609> glovebox<00:00:26.849> is<00:00:27.300> your<00:00:27.420> ECM<00:00:27.810> take

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
behind your glovebox is your ECM take

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.200 
behind your glovebox is your ECM take
that<00:00:28.410> out<00:00:28.590> in<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.099> middle<00:00:29.340> plug<00:00:29.580> top-rope

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
that out in the middle plug top-rope

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.120 
that out in the middle plug top-rope
plugs<00:00:30.539> number<00:00:30.900> four<00:00:31.230> pins<00:00:31.470> number<00:00:31.769> six<00:00:31.980> and

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
plugs number four pins number six and

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.810 
plugs number four pins number six and
seven<00:00:32.430> have<00:00:32.969> no<00:00:33.360> wires<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:33.899> them<00:00:34.370> and<00:00:35.370> what<00:00:35.730> you

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
seven have no wires in them and what you

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.490 
seven have no wires in them and what you
do<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.149> you<00:00:36.270> go<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.540> GM<00:00:36.930> dealer<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> they

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
do is you go to a GM dealer and they

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.049 
do is you go to a GM dealer and they
give<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> the<00:00:37.980> little<00:00:38.190> pins<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.670> go<00:00:38.730> in<00:00:38.940> the

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
give you the little pins that go in the

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.990 
give you the little pins that go in the
ECM<00:00:39.620> and<00:00:40.620> you<00:00:40.710> crimp<00:00:40.950> on<00:00:41.100> your<00:00:41.280> wires<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.879> you

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
ECM and you crimp on your wires and you

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.369 
ECM and you crimp on your wires and you
run<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.329> wires<00:00:42.510> to<00:00:42.750> the<00:00:42.840> switches<00:00:43.200> and<00:00:43.290> then

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
run your wires to the switches and then

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:47.020 
run your wires to the switches and then
you<00:00:43.500> grind<00:00:43.680> your<00:00:43.890> switches<00:00:44.250> if<00:00:45.149> mine<00:00:45.329> grounded

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:47.030 
you grind your switches if mine grounded

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:56.029 
you grind your switches if mine grounded
there<00:00:49.010> now<00:00:52.550> you<00:00:53.550> start<00:00:53.910> it<00:00:54.559> now<00:00:55.559> like<00:00:55.890> I<00:00:55.980> said

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
there now you start it now like I said

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.069 
there now you start it now like I said
these<00:00:56.280> are<00:00:56.340> both<00:00:56.550> backwards<00:00:57.059> so<00:00:57.270> eventually

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
these are both backwards so eventually

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
these are both backwards so eventually
the<00:00:58.770> way<00:00:58.890> it's<00:00:59.010> gonna<00:00:59.100> work<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.579> the<00:01:00.379> left-hand

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
the way it's gonna work is the left-hand

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.779 
the way it's gonna work is the left-hand
switch<00:01:01.649> is<00:01:01.829> going<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> be<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.250> lower<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
switch is going to be the lower of the

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.560 
switch is going to be the lower of the
two<00:01:04.460> right<00:01:05.460> now<00:01:05.489> it's<00:01:05.760> the<00:01:05.909> right<00:01:06.090> one

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
two right now it's the right one

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.510 
two right now it's the right one
and<00:01:06.659> also<00:01:07.140> they're<00:01:07.320> upside<00:01:07.710> down<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.250> this<00:01:08.460> is

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
and also they're upside down so this is

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.480 
and also they're upside down so this is
off<00:01:09.390> this<00:01:09.780> is<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.850> but<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:12.150> get<00:01:12.270> the<00:01:12.420> idea<00:01:13.490> this

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
off this is on but you get the idea this

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:25.349 
off this is on but you get the idea this
is<00:01:14.549> a<00:01:14.700> cold<00:01:14.970> start

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:25.359 

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.520 

okay<00:01:26.359> now<00:01:26.509> the<00:01:26.569> first<00:01:26.899> one<00:01:27.079> is

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:40.940 

1070

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:49.929 

the<00:01:41.340> next<00:01:41.610> one<00:01:41.760> is<00:01:42.890> 1350<00:01:43.890> I<00:01:43.920> believe

00:01:49.929 --> 00:01:49.939 

00:01:49.939 --> 00:01:51.489 

and<00:01:50.149> then<00:01:50.479> if<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.689> hit<00:01:50.810> them<00:01:50.929> both<00:01:51.109> you<00:01:51.380> get

00:01:51.489 --> 00:01:51.499 
and then if you hit them both you get

00:01:51.499 --> 00:02:07.750 
and then if you hit them both you get
1600

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.840 

so<00:02:08.360> that's<00:02:08.930> how<00:02:09.080> you<00:02:09.140> do<00:02:09.370> hiatal<00:02:10.370> switches<00:02:10.730> on

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
so that's how you do hiatal switches on

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:16.110 
so that's how you do hiatal switches on
an<00:02:10.970> obd<00:02:11.330> 265<00:02:12.460> you<00:02:13.460> can<00:02:13.580> also<00:02:13.730> do<00:02:13.970> it<00:02:14.120> for<00:02:14.360> obd<00:02:14.690> 1

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
an obd 265 you can also do it for obd 1

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.520 
an obd 265 you can also do it for obd 1
I'm<00:02:17.120> sure<00:02:17.300> it's<00:02:17.450> just<00:02:17.480> as<00:02:17.750> easy<00:02:17.870> but<00:02:18.080> I<00:02:18.380> haven't

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
I'm sure it's just as easy but I haven't

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.140 
I'm sure it's just as easy but I haven't
done<00:02:18.770> that<00:02:18.920> for<00:02:18.980> mine<00:02:19.280> because<00:02:19.580> I<00:02:19.820> don't<00:02:20.000> have

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
done that for mine because I don't have

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.190 
done that for mine because I don't have
a<00:02:20.180> nobody<00:02:20.800> 165<00:02:21.800> so<00:02:22.370> there<00:02:22.820> you<00:02:22.880> go<00:02:23.200> enjoy

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
a nobody 165 so there you go enjoy

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.280 
a nobody 165 so there you go enjoy
thanks<00:02:24.800> for<00:02:24.920> watching
