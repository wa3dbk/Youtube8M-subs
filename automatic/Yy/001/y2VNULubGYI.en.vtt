00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.480
 hello friends from the channel del 

00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:09.010
 dotcom artist today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:11.460
 sow or cherry or olive trees through 

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:11.460
 the bones 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:20.080
 There are those who have asked me if you can 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.080
 catch and man is better olives 

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.830
 natural worth 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.840
 what olives that have gone through a 

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:29.750
 salt treatment although the bone of the 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:33.530
 olive tree is so extremely hard that if that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.239
 it's the olive bone we save 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:36.920
 based on well the basis of changing water 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.570
 and water and water 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:43.010
 and such may end but good 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:45.140
 it is important also one thing to have 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.909
 consider all the trees on the wall 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:50.089
 of the varieties for a use be way 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:53.000
 of this bone is worth to pass their 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.410
 seeds a time in the fridge is worth 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.880
 so they cut 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:01.910
 or it is not a matter of reaching and poof 

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:05.400
 that is a great failure of the people 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:08.900
 then to be able to catch and that this 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.900
 touch the earth better 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.380
 let's take and with a sandpaper 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:25.520
 We are going to wear the bone 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.450
 As you can see a mercy looks 

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:32.700
 I'm wearing the bone 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.700
 so that when the bone 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.600
 touch the earth 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.800
 be easier than the k 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.960
 and 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.960
 because legally we see it 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:01.100
 open, this is what we're going to do 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.760
 with all the seeds that we want 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.760
 go finishing 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.259
 instant 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:13.410
 I eat and I had a germinator 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:20.210
 with a seed I was down that I put a 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.430
 germinate an hour ago 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:24.380
 I will leave them aside to take advantage of a 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.720
 little the germinated germinator is nothing 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:30.580
 more than a little paper with moisture 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.000
 is worth so that nothing more than touch 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:36.390
 it starts to sprout 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:41.990
 when it has sprouted of course to a 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.990
 very important agreement testing 

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.820
 Have you gone 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.890
 and this same thing can be done also with 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.290
 the seeds are the orange trees and the 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:52.880
 lemons the first shell that has 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.980
 around 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:59.570
 if we want to take it and choose it 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:02.690
 little bit, be careful not to damage 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:06.200
 Do not damage the seed and put it in a 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.810
 germinador will do much better good 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:12.110
 because while I finish doing 

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:15.020
 all this because nothing and I say goodbye because 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:17.810
 and finally after you have taught the method 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:22.100
 to sow your cherry trees 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:24.500
 Olive trees are worth our plum etc 

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.870
 usually the peach and the plum 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.890
 also a little thing before I leave 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:34.260
 I will explain with a 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.260
 with a seed usually 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:42.950
 This type of seed is very easy to 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.950
 open up the only thing we need is 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.400
 be a little 

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.310
 because the seed is inside then 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.300
 at the time 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.670
 that we have fixed it a bit 

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:02.550
 and others usually open and usually 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.800
 give us direct birth eye with the 

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:07.590
 following diet is sometimes a trick of 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:11.080
 that the fruit is past this in 

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:13.860
 concrete is perfect as we see 

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.860
 so 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:20.900
 we need a little bit for him 

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:24.370
 what we want the contact to do and 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:27.650
 we contacted the water to do 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:30.889
 good birth well with this simple 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:34.830
 trick can you have then 

00:04:30.889 --> 00:04:37.320
 foundations are worth born 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.700
 good of the artist that's why I'm the 

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.260
 thanks for watching videos 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.810

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.310
 the friendships and that you subscribe to
