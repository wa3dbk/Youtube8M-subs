00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:08.090
 Hello everyone, today we want to show you 

00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:11.700
 how to connect the system 

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:12.870
 clio multimedia for example has a 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.929
 bluetooth mobile phone 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.000
 in this case then we don't go down the 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.600
 system starts immediately by default 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.109
 with the last station that was 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 let's say so in memory 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.080
 then with the mobile 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.240
 the first thing we do or with 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.540
 our device can be a tablet 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:37.140
 however any smartphone we activate 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.950
 our bluetooth and let's go to work 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.760
 also here on the multimedia system 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.920
 the first thing we did we go to the 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.829
 the icon we tap on the icon 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.239
 settings and he clearly gives us the 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.129
 ability to view the list 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:55.699
 bluetooth devices research 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.350
 bluetooth device and so on 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:59.520
 first of all we give research 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:02.399
 bluetooth device 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.769
 he is researching it then we give in a 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:07.470
 moment of time not to notice that it can 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.890
 locate the phone 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:12.840
 we hope we will recognize it or if 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.580
 this procedure remains a little bit 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.470
 slower we could do even a 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.170
 such speech cancel 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.790
 go to view device list 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.140
 bluetooth 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.700
 here immediately you see who has 

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.009
 found the phone in question 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:32.220
 we selected then we did 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.680
 there it was already selected you see then 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.640
 this is the check that says that the 

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.770
 system has been connected and already from 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:44.630
 now this is the radio I can decide 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 to possibly activate the music with 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:54.190
 my device this case 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:58.150
 let's go back let's go in 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:02:02.050
 home the tap did on this case 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.650
 on the music that is in the device e 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:07.289
 immediately starts the music that is 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:12.580
 in the mobile 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:16.470
 this case I find it here I can as you 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:19.709
 I showed the other time scrolling 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:19.709
 change track 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:25.510
 But here is the important thing we have 

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.850
 connected the mobile phone to the device 

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.550
 if we want to do the reverse operation 

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:32.320
 now I'm playing music for a while 

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:35.050
 we can always go home always 

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:37.090
 settings you can view the 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:40.060
 list the list of devices e 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:42.370
 obviously you can be doing tap 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.780
 delete icon on the trash can 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:50.200
 device we give ok and device 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.870
 clearly he is cut off in this 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.600
 case from the navigation system that 

00:02:52.870 --> 00:03:00.040
 we can safely return to 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:02.220
 starting radio for now is all there 

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:04.870
 see you at the next appointment 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.970
 try up and all its devices 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:09.090
 multimedia and not 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:09.090
 Hello
