you okay like I said the specs on it it
says<00:00:37.110> a<00:00:37.320> 42<00:00:37.860> time<00:00:38.780> optical<00:00:39.780> zoom<00:00:39.930> on<00:00:40.530> it

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
says a 42 time optical zoom on it

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:44.180 
says a 42 time optical zoom on it
there's<00:00:40.980> no<00:00:41.100> digital<00:00:41.309> zoom<00:00:41.879> so<00:00:42.840> you're<00:00:43.800> pretty

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
there's no digital zoom so you're pretty

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.709 
there's no digital zoom so you're pretty
much<00:00:44.280> stuck<00:00:44.520> with<00:00:44.700> with<00:00:45.120> the<00:00:45.270> optical<00:00:45.690> zoom

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
much stuck with with the optical zoom

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.880 
much stuck with with the optical zoom
which<00:00:45.989> is<00:00:46.079> not<00:00:46.260> bad<00:00:46.289> but<00:00:48.500> you<00:00:49.500> know<00:00:49.590> maybe<00:00:49.800> a

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
which is not bad but you know maybe a

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.709 
which is not bad but you know maybe a
little<00:00:50.039> digital<00:00:50.250> would<00:00:50.550> it<00:00:50.640> be<00:00:50.700> nice<00:00:50.910> nice<00:00:51.539> as

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
little digital would it be nice nice as

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.569 
little digital would it be nice nice as
well<00:00:52.160> it<00:00:53.160> has<00:00:53.340> a<00:00:53.370> 40<00:00:53.789> gig<00:00:53.910> hard<00:00:54.180> drive<00:00:55.550> so<00:00:56.550> you

00:00:56.569 --> 00:00:56.579 
well it has a 40 gig hard drive so you

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.830 
well it has a 40 gig hard drive so you
can<00:00:57.000> sort<00:00:57.210> hours<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.289> hours<00:00:58.379> of<00:00:59.539> footage<00:01:00.539> on

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
can sort hours and hours of footage on

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.779 
can sort hours and hours of footage on
there<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.320> that<00:01:01.530> makes<00:01:02.190> it<00:01:02.309> very<00:01:02.370> very

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
there so that makes it very very

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.009 
there so that makes it very very
impressive<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.359> that's<00:01:03.570> from<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.960> the

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
impressive and that's from one of the

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.289 
impressive and that's from one of the
main<00:01:04.260> reasons<00:01:04.619> why<00:01:04.739> I<00:01:04.769> got<00:01:05.129> it<00:01:05.280> because<00:01:05.549> it<00:01:05.970> you

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
main reasons why I got it because it you

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.300 
main reasons why I got it because it you
know<00:01:06.450> it<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:07.350> store<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:07.830> many<00:01:08.010> hours<00:01:08.280> of

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
know it can store so many hours of

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.840 
know it can store so many hours of
footage<00:01:08.580> without<00:01:08.760> any<00:01:09.439> need<00:01:10.439> for<00:01:10.500> tapes<00:01:10.860> or<00:01:11.189> or

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
footage without any need for tapes or or

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:15.020 
footage without any need for tapes or or
anything<00:01:12.450> like<00:01:12.479> that<00:01:12.710> although<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:13.770> can<00:01:14.280> get

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
anything like that although you can get

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.820 
anything like that although you can get
an<00:01:15.780> SD<00:01:16.409> card<00:01:17.030> for<00:01:18.030> for<00:01:18.659> camp<00:01:19.790> for<00:01:20.790> snapshots<00:01:21.090> of

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
an SD card for for camp for snapshots of

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.350 
an SD card for for camp for snapshots of
like<00:01:22.830> regular<00:01:23.729> camera<00:01:24.210> snapshots<00:01:24.450> so<00:01:26.270> you<00:01:27.270> can

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
like regular camera snapshots so you can

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.990 
like regular camera snapshots so you can
store<00:01:27.509> our<00:01:27.570> pictures<00:01:27.960> on<00:01:28.080> there<00:01:31.790> other<00:01:32.790> things

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
store our pictures on there other things

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.890 
store our pictures on there other things

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
your footage right here here

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.850 
your footage right here here
it<00:01:45.240> back<00:01:46.240> late<00:01:46.420> on<00:01:46.450> the<00:01:48.210> lens<00:01:49.210> are<00:01:49.450> here<00:01:49.830> can<00:01:50.830> be

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.860 
it back late on the lens are here can be

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:54.660 
it back late on the lens are here can be
pretty<00:01:51.490> bright<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.950> other<00:01:53.950> than<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.280> camera

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:54.670 
pretty bright but other than the camera

00:01:54.670 --> 00:02:02.160 
pretty bright but other than the camera
itself<00:01:54.840> no<00:01:55.840> you<00:01:55.900> don't<00:01:56.290> have<00:01:56.440> any<00:01:58.230> any<00:02:01.170> light

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
itself no you don't have any any light

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:05.570 
itself no you don't have any any light
to<00:02:02.410> it<00:02:02.560> so<00:02:03.520> i<00:02:03.910> Doan<00:02:04.570> also<00:02:04.780> doesn't<00:02:05.020> have<00:02:05.080> any

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:05.580 
to it so i Doan also doesn't have any

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.370 
to it so i Doan also doesn't have any
night<00:02:06.580> vision<00:02:06.940> to<00:02:07.090> it<00:02:07.210> so<00:02:07.480> basically<00:02:07.990> the

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:08.380 
night vision to it so basically the

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:10.650 
night vision to it so basically the
features<00:02:08.710> are<00:02:08.860> pretty<00:02:09.100> much<00:02:09.280> gone<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:10.570> you

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
features are pretty much gone so you

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.510 
features are pretty much gone so you
have<00:02:10.960> to<00:02:11.050> deal<00:02:11.230> pretty<00:02:11.620> much<00:02:11.740> in<00:02:11.920> sunlight<00:02:12.280> the

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:12.520 
have to deal pretty much in sunlight the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.340 
have to deal pretty much in sunlight the
film<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.030> sunlight<00:02:13.450> or<00:02:13.630> really<00:02:13.960> really<00:02:14.200> good

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:14.350 
film and sunlight or really really good

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.220 
film and sunlight or really really good
like<00:02:15.570> my<00:02:16.570> only<00:02:16.810> really<00:02:17.350> complaint<00:02:17.830> is<00:02:18.250> that

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230
