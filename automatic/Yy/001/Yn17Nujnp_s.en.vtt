kitchen I think they actually make all
their<00:00:52.980> employees<00:00:53.100> take<00:00:53.489> a<00:00:53.550> bite<00:00:53.760> of<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.969> if<00:00:54.059> you

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
their employees take a bite of it if you

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.950 
their employees take a bite of it if you

want a job there it's all organic it's a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.260 
want a job there it's all organic it's a
little<00:00:58.199> bit<00:00:58.320> more<00:00:58.469> expensive<00:00:58.949> but<00:00:59.520> it<00:01:00.030> seems

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
little bit more expensive but it seems

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.430 
little bit more expensive but it seems
to<00:01:00.390> be<00:01:00.510> good<00:01:00.629> for<00:01:00.809> him<00:01:00.899> and<00:01:00.989> he<00:01:01.050> really<00:01:01.230> likes
