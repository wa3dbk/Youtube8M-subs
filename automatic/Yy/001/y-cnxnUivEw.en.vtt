recently<00:00:33.660> uploaded<00:00:34.020> a<00:00:34.320> MK<00:00:34.829> 48<00:00:36.020> nuclear<00:00:37.020> with

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
recently uploaded a MK 48 nuclear with

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.470 
recently uploaded a MK 48 nuclear with
the<00:00:37.590> thermal<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.250> do<00:00:38.489> obey<00:00:38.730> excuse<00:00:39.090> me<00:00:39.239> site

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
the thermal or do obey excuse me site

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.299 
the thermal or do obey excuse me site
and<00:00:39.719> that<00:00:40.410> seemed<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.680> go<00:00:40.800> over<00:00:41.010> pretty<00:00:41.190> well

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
and that seemed to go over pretty well

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.569 
and that seemed to go over pretty well
so<00:00:41.820> i<00:00:41.850> figured<00:00:42.300> hey<00:00:42.540> I'll<00:00:43.530> try<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> hammer<00:00:44.219> so

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
so i figured hey I'll try the hammer so

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.400 
so i figured hey I'll try the hammer so
I<00:00:44.610> you<00:00:45.000> know<00:00:45.030> this<00:00:45.300> I<00:00:45.539> think<00:00:45.989> this<00:00:46.170> gameplay

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I you know this I think this gameplay

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:48.139 
I you know this I think this gameplay
might<00:00:46.680> have<00:00:46.800> been<00:00:46.890> before<00:00:47.190> the<00:00:47.640> MK<00:00:47.910> 48

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
might have been before the MK 48

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.500 
might have been before the MK 48
actually<00:00:48.629> but<00:00:48.809> either<00:00:49.289> way<00:00:49.620> it's<00:00:50.579> I<00:00:51.030> think

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
actually but either way it's I think

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.150 
actually but either way it's I think
it's<00:00:51.719> pretty<00:00:51.930> good<00:00:52.050> something<00:00:52.469> different<00:00:53.010> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
it's pretty good something different I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.729 
it's pretty good something different I
know<00:00:53.219> for<00:00:53.699> a<00:00:54.090> fact<00:00:54.180> actually<00:00:55.079> now<00:00:55.260> that<00:00:55.289> like

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
know for a fact actually now that like

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.470 
know for a fact actually now that like
people<00:00:55.890> down<00:00:56.219> but<00:00:56.489> people<00:00:57.059> don't<00:00:57.149> use<00:00:57.360> the

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
people down but people don't use the

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.970 
people down but people don't use the
dual<00:00:57.660> pants<00:00:57.899> so<00:00:58.020> I'm<00:00:58.109> sure<00:00:58.379> it'll<00:00:58.530> be<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> nice

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980
