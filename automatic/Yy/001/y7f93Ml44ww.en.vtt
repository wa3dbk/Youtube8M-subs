00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:06.200
 here we are opening the button naturally 

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.720
 on a good drawing andy 

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.720
 felled 10 suited take the blinds 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.850
 ace king 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.630
 also cruise hand 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:32.940
 very strong hand doing moonrise 2 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:37.140
 bb splines again you all drop 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:39.690
 You see hereafter what I 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.060
 sticking to the amount of windows raise to 2 s 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.160
 half the big blinds since 

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:49.559
 My range is light enough 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:51.690
 enjoy a range of so 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.989
 bottom window size raise is 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.269
 optimal from my point of view at 53 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.769
 here are suited we opened the lines 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:00.769
 all positions thrown out 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.500
 look here we can 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:20.040
 free not free very cheap 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.580
 the flop plus we are vantage so we 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.840
 here the center was delivered if there was a flight 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:28.830
 before us we would dump 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:32.330
 naturally means go nbon nod 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:35.250
 butler not a bet of 20 cents here 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.610
 options 2 by and large either count 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.810
 either flight 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.740
 that is, it was possible to apply 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.090
 semi bluff 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.090
 a flop like that 

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.969
 well, you could just call 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.270
 take into account the fact that we have two-way 

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:55.130
 street draw we took such more 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.439
 calm and accepted more calmly and 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:05.030
 the decision called the turn looked 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:05.569
 then comes the second lady here 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.429
 rate 

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:14.060
 but notice it twice in a row 

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:16.370
 puts very small bets in principle 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:20.019
 such a limb from early position preflop 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:22.430
 he limped it most likely means 

00:02:20.019 --> 00:02:25.250
 pocket pair is possible 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.579
 may possibly be low 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.640
 him there like the spirit of eights something can 

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.290
 be even two triples 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.630
 he makes such bets because he is afraid 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.519
 what 

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:38.440
 Fighter card is afraid that the flash will close 

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:43.390
 someone 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:43.390
 so here is a good bluff situation 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.390
 this player is also there barely 

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:52.970
 called the minimum bet twice 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:57.230
 check flop check black 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:03:00.079
 also human if we 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.019
 now on this flight we get a call then we 

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:05.660
 we can see the river on the river 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.060
 the street may close but this is not 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:08.540
 we had to do that is on such 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.150
 raise 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.730
 both of them dropped we took away enough 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:23.349
 good bank 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:25.030
 65 on straight position pass jack 10 on 

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:29.890
 the big blind will kick off on 

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:31.720
 relis but after the release the more thing in 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:35.470
 that is uncomfortable from the big blind 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:40.269
 bad position is played out after us 

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:42.310
 the flop and therefore do not need too much 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:46.060
 go into the game on such on 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:49.269
 speculative andes out of position six 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:51.099
 seven subracks thrown at home 4 here you can 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:56.400
 fast fold to press because we are not enough 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:04:03.060
 blondie weak and worst position 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.060
 here 6 pass home 6 pass 

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.780
 two fives 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:18.060
 he liked the case despite the fact that 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:22.560
 in the pocket and a pair of rather weak but 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:24.780
 first we have seen already for 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.010
 played hands that the opponents are very 

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:31.170
 often thrown use fast waves 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:33.600
 that is, we often enough to you 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:36.800
 open a raise on the wide 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:40.230
 range of hands and in many situations 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.860
 we can just pick up the blinds without 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:42.860
 all resistance 

00:04:43.370 --> 00:04:50.020
 but just in case we get 3-bet 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:54.229
 that is, reraise something like this rice 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:57.010
 small size you plan b used he 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:59.930
 allows us to keep the bank small and 

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:03.139
 keep opportunities on paw views 

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.139
 reasonably cheap per set 

00:05:03.139 --> 00:05:09.070
 have we say we put the flight 25 cents 

00:05:06.139 --> 00:05:13.510
 someone twisted here from here for example 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:13.510
 up to 75 cents and 

00:05:14.139 --> 00:05:20.180
 we will be completely from the mathematical point 

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.800
 view justified to call 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:23.750
 see the flop because we will 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.460
 estimated gain of more than ten to 

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:28.280
 to one 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:32.510
 as the size of the joint exceeds 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:36.169
 ten times the size 

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.610
 re-raise so basically i 

00:05:36.169 --> 00:05:39.740
 stick to this one 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:43.840
 standard amount will like eye plan 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:43.840
 used so we go further 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:55.240
 here we have one cooler here thinking on 

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:55.240
 small blind 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.710
 then look here is quite dangerous 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:06.380
 flop so we have quite good 

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:10.700
 opportunity for cbet because not 

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:12.680
 having tambourines in hindi opponent 

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:15.400
 it will be difficult to call even if 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:18.110
 he has two sevens for example without a tambourine 

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:22.550
 also two dozen for example without diamonds 

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:26.120
 then we set and in theory he should 

00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:32.840
 dump that is good enough 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:36.620
 This flop is suitable for cbet here 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:40.000
 Cbet's size 40 cents with the bank 62 

00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:43.570
 that is, almost exactly two thirds and 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.570
 the opponent drops
