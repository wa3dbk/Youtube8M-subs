 within the match start with the name of the 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.530

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:16.500
 attack 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:20.550
 I prefer resistance so I made a veil 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:23.820
 but if you do make an attack 

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.820
 ghost blade blade of grape and is 

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.160
