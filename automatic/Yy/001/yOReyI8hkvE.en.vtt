00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.870
 Roman 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.570

 most important of the Mediterranean

 Thousands of people approach each year 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.160
 to know its historical center and 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.320
 discover its impressive museums 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.930
 valencia- at present it is very 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.600
 known even internationally without 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.560
 embargo for many centuries the origin 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.620
 of this city was surrounded by enigmas 

00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:50.220
 because how and when it was founded 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.290
 València some texts described a 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.730
 old military fortress in this area that 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.030
 it became an important 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.040
 Colony of the Roman Empire Other 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:00.720
 they talked about a cruel battle in which 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:02.430
 thousands of people would have died of 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.400
 appalling way 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.490
 to just over 25 years ago there were 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:13.880
 many theories and few certainties but to 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.880
 from 1985 everything was going to change 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:19.100
 in that year he started on the call 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.570
 almoina a fascinating excavation that 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.659
 it revealed that the city's past 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.250
 was hidden underground and that is that 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:27.740
 place that was for centuries a 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.450
 charity hid remnants 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.729
 of great value that allowed to know 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.979
 better the history of valència and about 

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:36.310
 all check what the origin had been 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:36.310
 from the city 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.620
 and thanks to the investigations it was possible 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.710
 prove that valencia was founded in the 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:48.350
 138 before Christ- by tenth June 

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:50.390
 gross that was called valencia and that their 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.400
 first settlers were two thousand 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:55.670
 colonists from the southern part of the Italian peninsula 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:57.950
 mostly retired soldiers but 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.020
 In addition, some important 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.729
 constructions of that time that today 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.729
 they are hidden in the almoina 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:09.460
 when descending these stairs 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.780
 we started a journey in time towards 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.780
 more than 2000 years ago 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.470
 and is that inside this center 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.690
 archaeological we can discover part of 

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:23.610
 the augusta road that passed through valencia 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.610
 on his journey from Rome to Cádiz 

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:30.620
 it is also possible to advance through a hórreo 

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:32.030
 a construction that was used to 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:36.189
 save food at the time 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:36.189
 republican and that could have been like that 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.860
 we can even see the remains of 

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:44.810
 sanctuary of asklepios a temple that 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:46.820
 It was composed of bathrooms and fountains with 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.860
 therapeutic purposes and that originally 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:51.930
 could present this aspect 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.060
 but without a doubt the enclave more 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.380
 amazing of republican bravery 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.600
 are these baths of 120 before Christ 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.790
 they can still see the bathtub 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.980
 of hot water from the caldarium the room 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.050
 of warm water the bank where they were given 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:08.880
 massage with oils and ointments and 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:11.360
 even the area where the 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:13.460
 changing rooms 

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.230
 those hot springs would have small 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:19.030
 doors and windows to prevent leakage 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.030
 of heat as it recreates the image 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:24.420
 in its interior the rooms would predominate 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:26.870
 dark that would be illuminated by 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.870
 the lights 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.750
 the republican bravery knew the cult 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.240
 to the body and to the gods but also 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:41.030
 he suffered the most absolute cruelty of Rome ' 

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.590
 in 75 before Christ in the 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.600
 course of the civil wars that 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:46.490
 would end with the Roman Republic a 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:48.380
 beautiful swept the city after 

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:50.940
 it would have lined up on the side of 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.770
 general rebel sertorio 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:54.960
 during that war ten thousand men 

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:56.750
 died and many were tortured without 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:59.150
 piety 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.760
 under the almoina javelins appeared 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:04.010
 siege projectile knives and several 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.710
 piluco throwing spears that proved 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:09.290
 that the contest developed here but 

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:12.530
 In addition, 14 skeletons were found 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.180
 brutal torture symptoms it was about 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.040
 surely of a group of prisoners 

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.720
 that after the defeat were 

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:19.970
 dismembered publicly for 

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:21.709
 terrorize the population among them 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:25.220
 there was the body of a 20 year old 

00:04:21.709 --> 00:04:26.870
 that his right leg amputated or 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:30.300
 shocking skeleton of this guy 

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:32.129
 that would have been impaled alive 

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.320
 the brutality of the war the state 

00:04:32.129 --> 00:04:36.270
 pure 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:39.780
 After the battle of Valencia Valencia 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:42.240
 it was abandoned for 70 years without 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.610
 But after that time the universe 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:46.200
 arise becoming hard 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.040
 an important colony of the empire 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.040
 Roman 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.180
 that imperial bravery came to tell 

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:57.090
 with a large forum or public square with a 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.400
 important market a basilica a circus 

00:04:57.090 --> 00:05:01.849
 with a capacity for 10,000 spectators and 

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.949
 with several necropolis 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:05.869
 in the subsoil of the almoina have 

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.849
 multiple remains of that one appeared 

00:05:05.869 --> 00:05:10.849
 epoch like these columns that would 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.889
 formed part of the forum also here 

00:05:10.849 --> 00:05:14.389
 you can see a part of the curia that 

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:16.969
 It was the place where the 

00:05:14.389 --> 00:05:19.309
 senators from the basilica of a fountain 

00:05:16.969 --> 00:05:23.050
 monumental and of various tombstones that have 

00:05:19.309 --> 00:05:23.050
 allowed to rebuild this mausoleum 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:28.120
 but also objects of the 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.250
 everyday life of the Romans from 

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.930
 vessels up to necklaces passing through 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:34.180
 Decoration elements with symbols 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:36.310
 clearly sexual like this mask of 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:37.840
 terracotta with a peculiar nose that 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.930
 conceived to scare the bad 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:39.930
 auguries 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:44.870
 after the fall of the Roman Empire that 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:47.120
 primigenia valencia was leaving little to 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.830
 little buried under the new city and 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:51.650
 his fingerprints disappeared almost by 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:53.570
 complete though thanks to one of 

00:05:51.650 --> 00:05:56.330
 the most important excavations and the best 

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:58.670
 made in recent years the mythical 

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.680
 valencia can be discovered to this day 

00:05:58.670 --> 00:06:02.680
 under the ground of the capital of turia
