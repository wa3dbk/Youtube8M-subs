00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.189

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.690
hello namaste salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.470
your VahChef at Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to make Kadhai chicken

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.220
you know lot of people have written to me saying that when they

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.779
make the chicken along with the tomatoes their chicken gets tough, today i'm going

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.599
to show you a method that it will be
awesome,

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.810
juicy and the chicken will be nice and
tender

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.989
so let's go ahead and make this kadhai chicken. So for this

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.230
you know we're going to cook the chicken first

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.760
by adding some oil,  in the oil add some red chilies, cumin seeds and then add

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.079
onions and add some salt and some
turmeric powder

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.210
now once the onions are slightly colored, add ginger-garlic paste and cook this

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.559
till the raw flavor is gone

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.520
you want to add the chicken pieces into this and mix it

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.350
we're going to cook this chicken put the lid and occasionally mix it and this may

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.390
take around 15 minutes of cooking

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.010
you know i'm showing you this method of
cooking because if you add the freshly

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.060
cut chicken

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.020
along with tomatoes are any acid the
chicken will get slightly rubbery

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
that is the reason you know i'm showing you this method where if you cook it

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:21.330
first and then add the tomatoes or
anything acid the chicken will not

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.369
become rubbery and really nice and
tender

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.090
you know if you marinate the chicken overnight and add the tomatoes and cook the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.650
chicken will be nice and tender

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.850
after around our 10 minutes of the slow
cooking look at this the chicken is

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.500
you know nicely cooked and it is no more
rubbery in this we're going to add some

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.659
of this kadhai masala and we're going to
add some in the last also just around the

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.939
one tablespoon of kadhai masala, chili
powder and mix this, if you want to get a

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.950
good red color add chili paste this will give a very nice color

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.180
this is the Kashmiri chillies so it'll give color but not too much of hotness

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:00.240
so now this will become fantastic Wow

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.799
and you know you want all that kadhai 
masala along with all these masalas to

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.360
cook so just let it cook for another 3-4
minutes like this

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:13.020
now you know after a few minutes of all these masalas cooking we're going

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.710
to add tomato puree if you're adding
tomatoes chopped in this at this point

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.960
of time it's going to take a lot more
time to cook

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.610
that's the reason why i made a puree
and just add tomato puree to this and mix

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.330
this up

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:28.290
see one thing, problem about these
tomatoes is you know sometimes you get

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.440
tomatoes which are very sour you have to be very careful in choosing

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.730
tomatoes, choose tomatoes which are slightly sweeter in taste, after you

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:36.900
add the tomatoes

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:40.200
you know do not put the lid just keep
stirring it occasionally

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.810
so that all the tomatoes get nicely
cooked now look at this nice red color

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.070
in this

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.060
add some capsicum, the bell pepper, add some onion, that also have been cut the

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.090
same size and just mix it

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.200
you know you don't want to cook these
too much you want to get the flavor out

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:03.420
of the bell pepper into this curry wow, 
you know by adding itself you get this

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:07.980
awesome nice flavor and the gravy
consistency also you can adjust you

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:13.140
know in a lot of curries i don't like to
add cream but when the curry is very

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:13.860
sharp

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.790
you can reduce it by adding a pinch of
sugar or else by adding a little bit of

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.090
cream so I'm going to show you how to add cream yesterday somebody has

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.020
written to me that, when they add some cream to the curries like tomato based

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:29.640
it curdles so the correct way of adding is take some of the curry and add it to

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.360
the cream

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:36.060
ok then mix this, this way the cream
becomes tempered and that cream you add

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:39.600
on top of your curry it will not cuddle anymore

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.290
now mix this, this will also cut down the sharpness little bit

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:47.459
wow and also that color wow look at
this, look at this

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:52.830
and now my main flavoring ingredients,  take some kasuri methi dried

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:57.840
just powder it and add on top, chopped coriander, I'm going to mix this

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.840
haha now on this add the leftover kadhai masala

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:09.120
that's it,  this is done, switch off the
flame and the chicken is also cooked perfectly

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.370
and it is soft and tender

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.760
it won't be any rubbery, Dear friends look at this

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:18.060
wow you know look at this

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.560
the smile on my face comes automatically
whenever I make my favorite dishes

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:23.910

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:39.150
Wow look at this chicken perfectly cooked and ahh it's hot but a piece of bell pepper,

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:46.680
onion along with the chicken mmm
dear friends

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.920
I hope you enjoyed today's session of
learning this Kadhai chicken with your

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:50.820
VahChef

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.080
you know make it and you will enjoy it
but do not forget vahrehvah is all about

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.770
inspiring others to cook so please post your recipes and cooking tips at

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.880
vahrehvah.com so others can benefit
from your great cooking

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:15.300
thank you. But basic Kadhai masala has you know red chillies add some pepper corns,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.790
coriander seeds in this add cumin seeds
and some fennel seeds

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:26.520
this is optional and dry roast these
ingredients till the nice sweet flavor

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.680
comes and also dry roasting of these ingredients makes it easy to put in a

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.090
pestle and ground

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:38.490
now you can see that this whole masalas have slightly colored and now we're

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:43.020
going to add fenugreek leaves these
fenugreek leaves also give a very nice

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.220
flavor that is the reason you add it in
the last because they're too thin and

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.700
they may get burnt if you add in the
starting; transfer this onto a

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:54.780
plate and we're going to cool this down, after you cool this down put in the ding

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.880
chik and ground into a coarse powder and divide into two parts one is slightly

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.080
finer and one is slightly coarse, the
finer one will go into making the gravy

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:07.770
and the coarse one we're going to add in the last

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:16.160
ok
