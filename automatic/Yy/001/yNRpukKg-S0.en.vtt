 but a hybrid and such a state 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:17.450
 and of course he looks sadly like he 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.450

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:27.290
 Volga Gas-24 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.680
 symbol of the Soviet Communist era 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:33.450
 drummer of communist labor 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:38.280
 I remember the management of Danilovich 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:41.330
 former Soviet Union by the way 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.330
 wog good condition 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:54.840
 Well, what an impression that I found myself 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:58.489
 in Soviet times because practically 

00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:03.560
 all not even practically but anyway and 

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:03.560
 pleya even survived on quality 

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:12.660
 knob put only on the Volga us 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:16.640
 excluded such to him even in the southern port 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.640
 it cost 4 rubles 50 kopecks 

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.320
 everything is clear taxi no receivers no 

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:31.750
 this is one of the first releases because 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:36.460
 speedometer scale 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:37.169
 I understood the tape here and in the first 

00:04:36.460 --> 00:04:41.919
 releases 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:44.010
 found a tape speedometer and well 

00:04:41.919 --> 00:04:47.430
 worthy copy 

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:50.430

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.430
 Taxi 

00:04:50.870 --> 00:05:01.550
 The main thing in the green light that 

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:07.340
 each car had such 

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:10.430
 emblem is very nice to sit even in 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.570
 we go on looking at such a machine 

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.570
 next car 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.580
 worthy of a specimen as here on the gills 

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:27.220

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:28.240
 cornering lights take care present 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:32.230

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:43.390
 license plate were so chromed 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:46.620
 ears but the most interesting thing about it 

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:50.070
 the island of the museum is the ship 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:52.040
 how did this ship sail 

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:54.599
 Chertanovo 

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.120
 There certainly unknown 

00:05:54.599 --> 00:06:05.020
 the copy is pretty interesting 

00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:05.020
 there are not only cars and ships 

00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:13.720
 on this we finish the ship i 

00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:19.080
 feel already cast to base on anchor 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:19.080

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:27.670
