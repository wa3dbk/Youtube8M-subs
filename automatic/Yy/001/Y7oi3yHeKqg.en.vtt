00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:29.969 
body that's what he's talking about
specifically<00:05:27.759> is<00:05:27.909> this<00:05:28.810> depiction<00:05:29.620> that<00:05:29.860> we

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:29.979 
specifically is this depiction that we

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:30.870 
specifically is this depiction that we
did<00:05:30.190> of<00:05:30.340> a<00:05:30.430> man

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:30.880 
did of a man

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:43.499 
did of a man
pulled<00:05:31.210> into<00:05:31.410> you<00:05:32.410> know<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:33.310> depths<00:05:33.640> of<00:05:33.730> hell

00:05:43.499 --> 00:05:43.509 

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:45.600 

I<00:05:43.539> think<00:05:44.289> turbo<00:05:44.590> changes<00:05:44.979> people's<00:05:45.340> lives

00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:45.610 
I think turbo changes people's lives

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.119 
I think turbo changes people's lives
maybe<00:05:45.849> without<00:05:46.300> him<00:05:46.960> even<00:05:47.080> knowing<00:05:47.259> it<00:05:47.680> he

00:05:48.119 --> 00:05:48.129 
maybe without him even knowing it he

00:05:48.129 --> 00:05:49.739 
maybe without him even knowing it he
someone<00:05:48.669> could<00:05:48.819> come<00:05:48.939> in<00:05:49.090> and<00:05:49.210> get<00:05:49.330> tattooed

00:05:49.739 --> 00:05:49.749 
someone could come in and get tattooed

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.589 
someone could come in and get tattooed
by<00:05:49.930> him<00:05:49.960> get<00:05:50.379> it<00:05:50.499> Jesus<00:05:50.860> but<00:05:51.580> he<00:05:51.610> doesn't

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
by him get it Jesus but he doesn't

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:54.149 
by him get it Jesus but he doesn't
really<00:05:52.719> know<00:05:52.900> how<00:05:53.169> he's<00:05:53.379> gonna<00:05:53.499> affect<00:05:53.949> like

00:05:54.149 --> 00:05:54.159

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:56.459 
really know how he's gonna affect like
their<00:05:54.729> whole<00:05:54.969> life<00:05:55.240> because<00:05:56.110> of<00:05:56.139> the<00:05:56.319> fact

00:05:56.459 --> 00:05:56.469 
their whole life because of the fact

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.019 
their whole life because of the fact
