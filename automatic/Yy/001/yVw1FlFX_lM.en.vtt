or sauteing it and the skins to remain
as<00:01:37.350> it<00:01:37.500> oftentimes<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.400> some<00:01:39.090> people<00:01:39.270> enjoy

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
as it oftentimes is some people enjoy

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:42.020 
as it oftentimes is some people enjoy
eating<00:01:39.840> it<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.229> always<00:01:40.680> score<00:01:41.070> it<00:01:41.220> and<00:01:41.939> that

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
eating it I always score it and that

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.819 
eating it I always score it and that
does<00:01:42.240> two<00:01:42.450> things<00:01:42.479> it<00:01:42.869> keeps<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.350> fish<00:01:43.649> from

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
does two things it keeps the fish from

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.179 
does two things it keeps the fish from
curling<00:01:44.159> up<00:01:44.460> especially<00:01:44.700> in<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.090> fry<00:01:45.299> pan<00:01:45.329> and

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
curling up especially in a fry pan and

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:49.429 
curling up especially in a fry pan and
on<00:01:47.189> the<00:01:47.340> grill<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:48.299> helps<00:01:48.630> to<00:01:48.960> allow<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.170> heat

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
on the grill it helps to allow the heat

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.499 
on the grill it helps to allow the heat
to<00:01:49.500> permeate<00:01:49.979> more<00:01:50.220> evenly<00:01:50.610> so<00:01:50.939> it<00:01:51.060> speeds<00:01:51.329> up

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
to permeate more evenly so it speeds up

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:52.940 
to permeate more evenly so it speeds up

juice I'm going to check the filet for
any<00:02:06.570> bones<00:02:06.990> that<00:02:07.350> might<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.680> remaining<00:02:08.039> and<00:02:08.280> i

any bones that might be remaining and i
like<00:02:08.459> to<00:02:08.610> use<00:02:08.640> needle<00:02:09.060> nose<00:02:09.179> pliers<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.690> do

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
like to use needle nose pliers to do

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.040 
like to use needle nose pliers to do
that

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
that

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.390 
that
and<00:02:12.050> the<00:02:12.170> only<00:02:12.410> real<00:02:12.590> method<00:02:12.950> for<00:02:13.100> doing<00:02:13.220> that

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
and the only real method for doing that

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.280 
and the only real method for doing that
is<00:02:13.460> to<00:02:13.730> run<00:02:13.880> your<00:02:14.030> fingers<00:02:14.390> against<00:02:14.960> the<00:02:15.050> grain

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
is to run your fingers against the grain

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.120 
is to run your fingers against the grain
of<00:02:15.320> the<00:02:15.500> fish<00:02:16.270> and<00:02:17.270> actually<00:02:17.870> this<00:02:18.050> feels<00:02:18.740> as

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
of the fish and actually this feels as

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.640 
of the fish and actually this feels as
if<00:02:19.400> it's<00:02:19.550> in<00:02:19.700> very<00:02:19.850> good<00:02:19.970> condition<00:02:20.530> and<00:02:21.530> this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
if it's in very good condition and this

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.080 
if it's in very good condition and this
will<00:02:21.860> work<00:02:21.980> beautifully<00:02:22.250> on<00:02:22.670> an<00:02:22.790> outdoor

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:23.090 
will work beautifully on an outdoor

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:25.990 
will work beautifully on an outdoor
grill<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.740> flames<00:02:25.010> as<00:02:25.340> they<00:02:25.520> lick<00:02:25.790> that

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
grill so the flames as they lick that

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.580 
grill so the flames as they lick that
skin<00:02:26.480> are<00:02:26.750> going<00:02:26.930> to<00:02:26.990> give<00:02:27.110> it<00:02:27.200> that<00:02:27.320> char

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
skin are going to give it that char

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.020 
skin are going to give it that char
boreal<00:02:27.950> flavor<00:02:28.190> that's<00:02:28.430> going<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> permeate

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:29.030 
boreal flavor that's going to permeate

the<00:02:29.120> flesh<00:02:29.540> and<00:02:29.780> give<00:02:29.900> it<00:02:30.020> another<00:02:30.250> component

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the flesh and give it another component

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.370 
the flesh and give it another component
to<00:02:31.550> that<00:02:31.580> flavor<00:02:32.000> profile<00:02:32.570> if<00:02:32.990> it's<00:02:33.290> a

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:33.380 
to that flavor profile if it's a

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:34.690 
to that flavor profile if it's a
