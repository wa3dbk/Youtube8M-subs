00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:10.850
 this tutorial we will see how 

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:13.879
 decrease the size this big the 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:19.240
 desktop of the icons of 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:23.900
 desktop in windows 8.1 in the version 

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:25.490
 Spanish is valid in Spanish language because if 

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:29.690
 you have ever installed 

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:33.559
 an operating system in English you have 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:36.199
 realized that these icons are worth not 

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:39.230
 They are the same size if we go 

00:00:36.199 --> 00:00:43.489
 here in see vale 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:46.610
 Right mouse click see and select 

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:51.760
 small icons we also see that the 

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:55.250
 icons are still great with a space 

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:57.490
 great among the icons see if we 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.820
 we set vale 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.720
 Well, I found a solution that is very 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:05.820
 easy do not have to do many things 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.800
 and what we have to do is enter 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:15.120
 the records and there change two values 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:19.250
 we are going to make the icons very space 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.250
 of the icons will do less 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.920
 right click mouse to execute 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.370
 at the beginning forgiveness on the button 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.500
 start right click run 

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:32.500
 here we write about what 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:40.510
 enter 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:44.720
 and here we are going to acquire 40 10 vale 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:48.350
 here we are going to control panel here we 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:52.940
 we go to text and here we click on 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.400
 windows windows metrix is ​​worth and here what 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.470
 that we have to change are these two 

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:03.439
 values 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:06.149
 in icon spacing and with vertical spacing 

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:10.800
 Well, how do we modify these right clicks? 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:15.239
 about and with spirit things and right 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:18.230
 modify and here we put the value of thousand 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.230
 hundred 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.370
 1125 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.180
 125 yes 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:37.670
 we accept we go to the other icon 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:42.610
 vertical bicing modify also and 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:44.950
 here 1,125 6 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:49.110
 we accept 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.110
 check again yes 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.010
 we close this window and what we have 

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:56.749
 what to do is a restart, now 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:58.380
 same we will accelerate the start also 

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:01.800
 yes 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.800
 ok we notice that here the icons 

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.440
 they are a little bit more 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.580
 Transits of what we will have the 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:14.730
 after the restart if you right click on 

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:17.390
 the start turn off or close section of 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.390
 start 

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:23.140
 We hope to restart the machine 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:24.910
 I'm recording in the virtual machine 

00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:27.310
 why 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.140
 in my original machine I have it but 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:32.730
 silo 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:36.300
 recorded on my machine I could not 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:39.660
 restart without interrupting the 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:41.490
 video recording then 

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:44.940
 he is doing it with the virtual machine 

00:03:41.490 --> 00:03:46.740
 that ye may know that there 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.650
 no trick is worth I'll wait until 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:53.040
 that he starts the machine and so you 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.090
 you also have it clear that the truth 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:57.020
 I'm doing 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:59.120
 You can also while 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.160
 to start the morning I'll tell you 

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:03.160
 also that there is a program that 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:12.720
 you can also decrease the icons is 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.870
 tuneup if I'm not wrong 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.450
 and good for me to install so many 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:21.720
 programs 

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:24.180
 with changing the values ​​in the records 

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:27.750
 there is no problem I also want you 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.090
 tell you to change how you have to 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.510
 modify and do not modify other things 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:36.360
 Well you are not going to have any problems 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:39.060
 I guarantee that the only thing clear, do not start 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:42.990
 to modify there in the records because 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:47.760
 I might modify something else and there 

00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:49.050
 yes I do not take responsibility but if 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.260
 you multiply what I 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.480
 I modified there's no problem like that 

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:58.080
 it's worth look, we look and it's more 

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:02.600
 small is worth the smallest icons the 

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.600
 space this is worth 

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:07.889
 OK 

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:11.550
 and this way 

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:15.150
 well nothing this is the tutorial today and 

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:19.069
