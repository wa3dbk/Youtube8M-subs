00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.770 

here<00:01:51.670> the<00:01:51.820> other<00:01:51.970> one<00:01:52.090> was<00:01:52.210> fine

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
here the other one was fine

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.050 
here the other one was fine
is<00:01:53.320> this<00:01:53.439> the<00:01:53.590> one<00:01:53.679> that<00:01:53.860> was<00:01:53.979> a<00:01:54.009> bit<00:01:54.159> wrong<00:01:54.399> um

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
is this the one that was a bit wrong um

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:58.350 
is this the one that was a bit wrong um
they<00:01:55.689> both<00:01:55.960> were<00:01:56.259> really<00:01:56.759> but<00:01:57.759> I'm<00:01:58.060> guessing

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
they both were really but I'm guessing

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.630 
they both were really but I'm guessing
that<00:01:58.600> one<00:01:58.780> was<00:01:59.110> a<00:01:59.140> Soren<00:01:59.590> injection<00:02:00.100> site<00:02:00.369> or

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:00.640 
that one was a Soren injection site or

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.219 
that one was a Soren injection site or
saw<00:02:00.880> at<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.090> top<00:02:01.240> of<00:02:01.390> the<00:02:01.479> time<00:02:01.690> over<00:02:01.929> to<00:02:02.020> the

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
saw at the top of the time over to the

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.559 
saw at the top of the time over to the
surgery<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:03.009> I<00:02:03.549> think<00:02:03.729> it's<00:02:03.880> top<00:02:04.179> of<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.390> toe

00:02:04.559 --> 00:02:04.569 
surgery and I think it's top of the toe

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:07.139 
surgery and I think it's top of the toe
I<00:02:04.600> think<00:02:05.110> but<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:05.979> just<00:02:06.190> a<00:02:06.250> general<00:02:06.520> sort<00:02:07.060> of

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
I think but it's just a general sort of

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:20.270 
I think but it's just a general sort of
pain<00:02:07.420> I<00:02:07.450> guess<00:02:08.819> so<00:02:09.819> this<00:02:09.970> is<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.179> a<00:02:10.330> Sasha<00:02:10.569> so

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.320 

normally<00:02:21.280> the<00:02:21.370> winds<00:02:21.580> take<00:02:21.819> about<00:02:22.030> three

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
normally the winds take about three

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.970 
normally the winds take about three
weeks<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.750> heal<00:02:22.900> up<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.350> don't<00:02:23.500> be<00:02:23.650> worried<00:02:23.920> if

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
weeks to heal up so don't be worried if

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.710 
weeks to heal up so don't be worried if
it<00:02:24.130> seems<00:02:24.310> to<00:02:24.400> be<00:02:24.489> taking<00:02:24.850> a<00:02:24.880> long<00:02:25.030> time<00:02:25.330> okay

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
it seems to be taking a long time okay

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.780 
it seems to be taking a long time okay
even<00:02:26.230> if<00:02:26.319> you're<00:02:26.350> a<00:02:26.500> quick<00:02:26.799> healer<00:02:27.069> because<00:02:27.670> of

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
even if you're a quick healer because of

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.339 
even if you're a quick healer because of
the<00:02:27.880> comic<00:02:28.180> colleges<00:02:28.569> tape<00:02:28.780> it<00:02:28.989> does<00:02:29.110> take<00:02:29.319> a

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
the comic colleges tape it does take a

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:30.809 
the comic colleges tape it does take a
few<00:02:29.590> weeks<00:02:29.739> for<00:02:29.890> them<00:02:30.069> to<00:02:30.190> completely<00:02:30.549> dry<00:02:30.790> out

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
that you want to let the air get to them

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.820 
that you want to let the air get to them
I<00:04:37.800> wouldn't<00:04:38.729> recommend<00:04:39.000> it<00:04:39.330> because<00:04:39.830> if

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:40.830 
I wouldn't recommend it because if

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.320 
I wouldn't recommend it because if
there's<00:04:41.070> fluid<00:04:41.310> coming<00:04:41.669> out<00:04:41.850> of<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.090> wound

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
there's fluid coming out of the wound

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.090 
there's fluid coming out of the wound
there's<00:04:42.690> still<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:42.900> root<00:04:43.140> for<00:04:43.320> bacteria<00:04:43.830> to<00:04:43.860> get

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:44.100 
there's still a root for bacteria to get

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.969 
there's still a root for bacteria to get
in<00:04:44.280> yep<00:04:44.820> so<00:04:45.030> until<00:04:45.270> it's<00:04:45.450> scalped<00:04:45.840> over<00:04:46.289> keep

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
in yep so until it's scalped over keep

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:50.300 
in yep so until it's scalped over keep
them<00:04:47.160> covered<00:04:48.500> but<00:04:49.500> basically<00:04:49.830> once<00:04:50.130> the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
them covered but basically once the

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.070 
them covered but basically once the
dressings<00:04:50.729> are<00:04:50.910> clean<00:04:51.120> and<00:04:51.330> drying<00:04:51.600> coming

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
dressings are clean and drying coming

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:53.779 
dressings are clean and drying coming
off<00:04:52.200> with<00:04:52.410> no<00:04:52.620> staining<00:04:53.070> on<00:04:53.430> them<00:04:53.580> anymore
