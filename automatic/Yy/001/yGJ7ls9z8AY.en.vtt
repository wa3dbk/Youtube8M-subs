00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
reason for that is this is an LED lamp

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.450 
reason for that is this is an LED lamp
and<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.659> means<00:01:54.869> a<00:01:54.990> couple<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.350> things<00:01:55.460> first

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
and that means a couple of things first

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.609 
and that means a couple of things first
of<00:01:56.610> all<00:01:56.700> it's<00:01:56.969> super<00:01:57.360> energy<00:01:57.750> efficient<00:01:58.200> so

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
of all it's super energy efficient so

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.260 
of all it's super energy efficient so
even<00:01:58.979> though<00:01:59.070> it's<00:01:59.219> a<00:01:59.310> thousand<00:01:59.850> watt<00:01:59.969> light

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:00.270 
even though it's a thousand watt light

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.170 
even though it's a thousand watt light
it<00:02:00.570> only<00:02:00.899> draws<00:02:01.200> a<00:02:01.229> hundred<00:02:01.950> watts<00:02:02.130> I<00:02:02.460> really

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
it only draws a hundred watts I really

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.289 
it only draws a hundred watts I really
like<00:02:03.360> that<00:02:03.570> it's<00:02:04.500> nice<00:02:04.740> and<00:02:04.979> flat<00:02:05.310> as<00:02:05.610> well<00:02:05.939> so

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
like that it's nice and flat as well so

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.449 
like that it's nice and flat as well so
no<00:02:06.630> protruding<00:02:06.990> bulbs<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.770> break<00:02:08.039> on<00:02:08.280> you

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459
