00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
played a very tough schedule they were

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:34.040 
played a very tough schedule they were
right<00:00:32.489> up<00:00:32.640> there<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.910> top<00:00:33.120> in<00:00:33.329> the<00:00:33.390> RPI<00:00:33.719> all

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730 
year but there's just something about

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.459 
year but there's just something about
that<00:00:36.000> Arizona<00:00:36.510> team<00:00:36.690> I<00:00:36.750> think<00:00:37.110> they<00:00:37.230> have

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
that Arizona team I think they have

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.560 
that Arizona team I think they have
definitely<00:00:37.890> two<00:00:38.100> pros<00:00:38.460> and<00:00:38.820> chase<00:00:39.300> budinger

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
definitely two pros and chase budinger

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:41.780

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.740 
wise i think is a very underrated point
guard<00:00:44.430> and<00:00:44.940> I<00:00:45.059> just<00:00:45.300> think<00:00:45.480> they'll<00:00:45.629> be

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
guard and I just think they'll be

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.209 
guard and I just think they'll be

Kentucky<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.969> Hilltoppers<00:00:57.710> over<00:00:58.710> Illinois<00:00:59.100> I

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
Kentucky the Hilltoppers over Illinois I

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.369 
Kentucky the Hilltoppers over Illinois I
just<00:01:00.120> think<00:01:00.270> Western<00:01:00.629> Kentucky<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:01.109> think

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
just think Western Kentucky I think

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.110 
just think Western Kentucky I think
they're<00:01:01.530> athletic<00:01:01.859> they<00:01:02.370> can<00:01:02.550> really<00:01:02.820> score

they're athletic they can really score
from<00:01:03.329> the<00:01:03.449> perimeter<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.110> I<00:01:04.710> think<00:01:04.949> that's

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
from the perimeter and I think that's

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:06.590 
from the perimeter and I think that's
gonna<00:01:05.339> be<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.610> key<00:01:05.760> to<00:01:05.790> the<00:01:06.000> game<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.450> also

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
gonna be the key to the game then also
