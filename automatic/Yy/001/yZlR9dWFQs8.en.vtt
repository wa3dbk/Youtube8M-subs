baseball<00:00:12.610> analyst<00:00:13.000> talking<00:00:13.780> a<00:00:13.840> little<00:00:13.960> bit

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:14.110 
baseball analyst talking a little bit

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:15.690 
baseball analyst talking a little bit
about<00:00:14.410> pitching<00:00:14.860> and<00:00:14.980> I<00:00:15.100> think<00:00:15.370> one<00:00:15.520> of<00:00:15.550> the

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
about pitching and I think one of the

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.150 
about pitching and I think one of the
things<00:00:15.730> you<00:00:16.090> often<00:00:16.449> hear<00:00:16.689> you<00:00:17.140> know<00:00:17.260> sons<00:00:17.830> and

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:18.160 
things you often hear you know sons and

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:20.070 
things you often hear you know sons and
daughters<00:00:18.550> and<00:00:18.730> moms<00:00:18.880> and<00:00:19.179> dads<00:00:19.359> and<00:00:19.630> anybody

daughters and moms and dads and anybody

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.480 
daughters and moms and dads and anybody
that<00:00:20.259> wants<00:00:20.619> to<00:00:20.740> get<00:00:20.829> involved<00:00:21.130> about

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:21.490 
that wants to get involved about

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.339 
that wants to get involved about
baseball<00:00:21.910> everybody<00:00:22.150> wants<00:00:22.689> to<00:00:22.720> know<00:00:22.929> you

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:23.349 
baseball everybody wants to know you

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:24.779 
baseball everybody wants to know you
know<00:00:23.439> what's<00:00:23.679> the<00:00:23.859> most<00:00:24.039> important<00:00:24.609> pitch

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:24.789 
know what's the most important pitch

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:26.730 
know what's the most important pitch
what's<00:00:25.179> the<00:00:25.329> most<00:00:25.480> important<00:00:26.019> thing<00:00:26.050> and<00:00:26.380> I

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:26.740 
what's the most important thing and I

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.950 
what's the most important thing and I
think<00:00:26.769> really<00:00:27.159> pitching<00:00:27.519> boils<00:00:27.999> down<00:00:28.060> to<00:00:28.749> two

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:28.960 
think really pitching boils down to two

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.919 
think really pitching boils down to two
basics<00:00:29.470> it's<00:00:29.710> about<00:00:29.980> deception<00:00:30.609> and<00:00:30.939> angles

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
basics it's about deception and angles

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:33.810 
basics it's about deception and angles
and<00:00:32.200> the<00:00:32.230> first<00:00:32.829> thing<00:00:32.980> we'll<00:00:33.160> talk<00:00:33.340> about<00:00:33.520> is

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
and the first thing we'll talk about is

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:36.330 
and the first thing we'll talk about is
deception<00:00:34.660> you'll<00:00:35.079> see<00:00:35.260> a<00:00:35.289> lot<00:00:35.770> of<00:00:35.800> pitchers

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
deception you'll see a lot of pitchers

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.790 
deception you'll see a lot of pitchers
that<00:00:37.120> have<00:00:37.329> different<00:00:37.600> types<00:00:38.260> of<00:00:38.559> motions

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:38.800 
that have different types of motions

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.590 
that have different types of motions
you'll<00:00:39.219> see<00:00:39.399> guys<00:00:39.609> that<00:00:39.789> are<00:00:39.910> very<00:00:40.090> smooth

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:40.600 
you'll see guys that are very smooth

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.619 
you'll see guys that are very smooth
guys<00:00:41.379> that<00:00:41.649> have<00:00:41.829> a<00:00:41.859> lot<00:00:42.100> of<00:00:42.129> leg<00:00:42.489> swing<00:00:42.879> guys

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
guys that have a lot of leg swing guys

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:45.930 
guys that have a lot of leg swing guys
that<00:00:43.989> turn<00:00:44.289> their<00:00:44.469> back<00:00:44.680> to<00:00:44.890> hitters<00:00:45.219> what

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:45.940 
that turn their back to hitters what

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.549 
that turn their back to hitters what
you're<00:00:46.149> trying<00:00:46.480> to<00:00:46.660> do<00:00:46.840> when<00:00:47.109> you're<00:00:47.260> pitching

00:00:47.549 --> 00:00:47.559 
you're trying to do when you're pitching

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:50.669 
you're trying to do when you're pitching
is<00:00:47.949> to<00:00:48.550> create<00:00:48.969> some<00:00:49.300> type<00:00:49.510> of<00:00:49.570> deception<00:00:50.350> if

00:00:50.669 --> 00:00:50.679 
is to create some type of deception if

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:53.549 
is to create some type of deception if
you<00:00:51.129> continually<00:00:51.820> do<00:00:52.120> the<00:00:52.329> same<00:00:52.629> thing<00:00:52.960> where

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
you continually do the same thing where

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.950 
you continually do the same thing where
a<00:00:53.589> hitter<00:00:54.160> can<00:00:54.429> get<00:00:54.640> your<00:00:54.789> timing<00:00:55.269> if<00:00:55.570> you<00:00:55.780> go

00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:55.960 
a hitter can get your timing if you go

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.479 
a hitter can get your timing if you go
through<00:00:56.199> your<00:00:56.230> delivery<00:00:56.800> and<00:00:56.980> you're<00:00:57.309> very

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
through your delivery and you're very

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.279 
through your delivery and you're very
easily<00:00:57.879> timed<00:00:58.420> where<00:00:58.660> you<00:00:58.809> go<00:00:58.989> through<00:00:59.199> the

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.289 
easily timed where you go through the

00:00:59.289 --> 00:01:01.799 
easily timed where you go through the
same<00:00:59.530> motion<00:01:00.039> you'll<00:01:00.579> often<00:01:00.850> hear<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.570> phrase

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:01.809 
same motion you'll often hear the phrase

00:01:01.809 --> 00:01:03.959 
same motion you'll often hear the phrase
that<00:01:02.050> a<00:01:02.109> ball<00:01:02.379> jumps<00:01:02.980> on<00:01:03.129> the<00:01:03.249> guy<00:01:03.429> has<00:01:03.640> a<00:01:03.670> real

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
that a ball jumps on the guy has a real

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:06.510 
that a ball jumps on the guy has a real
live<00:01:04.269> arm<00:01:04.540> and<00:01:04.809> the<00:01:05.199> ball<00:01:05.409> jumps<00:01:05.770> on<00:01:06.009> you<00:01:06.159> and<00:01:06.340> I

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
live arm and the ball jumps on you and I

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.010 
live arm and the ball jumps on you and I
think<00:01:06.759> one<00:01:06.939> of<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.119> things<00:01:07.150> with<00:01:07.600> deception

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:08.020 
think one of the things with deception

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.620 
think one of the things with deception
is<00:01:08.320> a<00:01:08.799> lot<00:01:09.159> of<00:01:09.310> your<00:01:09.490> really<00:01:09.939> good<00:01:10.180> pitchers

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:10.630 
is a lot of your really good pitchers

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.050 
is a lot of your really good pitchers
are<00:01:10.840> really<00:01:11.350> quiet<00:01:11.740> they're<00:01:12.340> really<00:01:12.549> smooth

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
are really quiet they're really smooth

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:14.580 
are really quiet they're really smooth
and<00:01:13.240> they<00:01:13.390> come<00:01:13.600> up<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:13.840> their<00:01:13.990> delivery<00:01:14.470> is

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
and they come up and their delivery is

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:16.649 
and they come up and their delivery is
nice<00:01:14.799> and<00:01:15.070> smooth<00:01:15.369> and<00:01:15.579> when<00:01:16.060> the<00:01:16.180> ball<00:01:16.390> comes

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
nice and smooth and when the ball comes

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.810 
nice and smooth and when the ball comes
out<00:01:16.899> their<00:01:17.470> their<00:01:17.770> their<00:01:17.799> motion<00:01:18.610> their

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
out their their their motion their

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.480 
out their their their motion their
mechanics<00:01:19.390> lulls<00:01:20.200> a<00:01:20.409> hitter<00:01:20.439> to<00:01:20.979> sleep<00:01:21.280> it's

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
mechanics lulls a hitter to sleep it's

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:23.670 
mechanics lulls a hitter to sleep it's
hard<00:01:21.759> to<00:01:21.939> get<00:01:22.090> your<00:01:22.299> timing<00:01:22.720> as<00:01:22.840> a<00:01:22.869> hitter<00:01:23.110> when

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:23.680 
hard to get your timing as a hitter when

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.039 
hard to get your timing as a hitter when
a<00:01:23.710> guy<00:01:23.890> is<00:01:23.920> really<00:01:24.340> smooth<00:01:24.939> because<00:01:25.420> he's<00:01:25.780> just

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:26.049 
a guy is really smooth because he's just

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:28.590 
a guy is really smooth because he's just
nice<00:01:26.259> and<00:01:26.290> slow<00:01:26.829> and<00:01:27.100> deliberate<00:01:27.520> and<00:01:27.729> written

00:01:39.749 --> 00:01:39.759 
all the weights you want to lift you can

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:42.179 
all the weights you want to lift you can
benchpress<00:01:40.030> 500<00:01:40.719> pounds<00:01:41.079> and<00:01:41.649> it<00:01:41.740> will<00:01:41.950> not

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:42.189 
benchpress 500 pounds and it will not

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.859 
benchpress 500 pounds and it will not
make<00:01:42.430> any<00:01:42.700> difference<00:01:42.969> in<00:01:43.299> your<00:01:43.420> velocity

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:43.869 
make any difference in your velocity

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:45.840 
make any difference in your velocity
it's<00:01:44.020> why<00:01:44.140> you<00:01:44.200> see<00:01:44.439> a<00:01:44.469> lot<00:01:44.530> of<00:01:44.710> really<00:01:45.610> good

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
it's why you see a lot of really good

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.609 
it's why you see a lot of really good
that<00:01:46.149> the<00:01:46.360> power<00:01:46.600> pictures<00:01:46.930> of<00:01:47.259> the<00:01:47.350> modern

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
the things it's deception and I think

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.830 
the things it's deception and I think
the<00:01:59.710> second<00:02:00.159> part<00:02:00.430> that<00:02:00.909> is<00:02:01.060> so<00:02:01.270> important

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:01.840 
the second part that is so important

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.590 
the second part that is so important
with<00:02:02.469> pitching<00:02:02.950> is<00:02:03.090> angles<00:02:04.090> and<00:02:04.299> I<00:02:04.420> don't

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
with pitching is angles and I don't

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.690 
with pitching is angles and I don't
think<00:02:04.719> anybody<00:02:05.200> that<00:02:06.039> I've<00:02:06.159> seen<00:02:06.460> in<00:02:06.579> the<00:02:06.609> last

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
think anybody that I've seen in the last

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.120 
think anybody that I've seen in the last
25<00:02:07.329> years<00:02:07.390> does<00:02:07.899> a<00:02:07.930> better<00:02:08.200> job<00:02:08.320> of<00:02:08.560> this<00:02:08.890> than

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
25 years does a better job of this than

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:11.640 
25 years does a better job of this than
Greg<00:02:09.369> Maddux<00:02:09.759> even<00:02:09.970> though<00:02:10.660> he's<00:02:10.899> barely<00:02:11.200> six

feet tall it's pitching is about

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.880 
feet tall it's pitching is about
if<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.819> were<00:02:14.940> to<00:02:15.060> take<00:02:15.240> a<00:02:15.300> ball<00:02:15.630> and<00:02:15.990> throw<00:02:16.620> it<00:02:16.650> to

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
one or two throws you have a pretty good

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.680 
one or two throws you have a pretty good
idea<00:02:22.050> of<00:02:22.560> where<00:02:22.980> it<00:02:23.280> was<00:02:23.459> coming<00:02:23.700> all<00:02:24.270> your

idea of where it was coming all your

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
eyes have to do is gauge how fast it's

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.760 
eyes have to do is gauge how fast it's
coming<00:02:27.420> but<00:02:27.690> if<00:02:27.810> you<00:02:27.930> throw<00:02:28.200> something<00:02:28.680> at

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
coming but if you throw something at

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.980 
coming but if you throw something at
somebody<00:02:29.220> pretty<00:02:29.880> much<00:02:30.090> chest<00:02:30.480> level<00:02:30.720> the

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
somebody pretty much chest level the

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.660 
somebody pretty much chest level the
chest<00:02:31.260> level<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.980> kind<00:02:32.250> of<00:02:32.280> have<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:32.430> pretty

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
chest level you kind of have a pretty

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.640 
chest level you kind of have a pretty
good<00:02:32.730> idea<00:02:32.880> where<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.990> would<00:02:34.140> need<00:02:34.290> to<00:02:34.440> catch

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
good idea where you would need to catch

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.580 
good idea where you would need to catch
it<00:02:34.860> now<00:02:35.130> on<00:02:35.400> the<00:02:36.300> flip<00:02:36.510> side<00:02:36.540> of<00:02:36.750> that<00:02:36.870> if<00:02:37.410> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
it now on the flip side of that if I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.590 
it now on the flip side of that if I
were<00:02:37.740> to<00:02:37.830> throw<00:02:37.890> this<00:02:38.190> to<00:02:38.400> you<00:02:38.580> from<00:02:39.060> up<00:02:39.330> here

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:39.600 
were to throw this to you from up here

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:42.110 
were to throw this to you from up here
and<00:02:39.840> throw<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.260> down<00:02:40.470> at<00:02:40.739> your<00:02:41.010> chest<00:02:41.280> not<00:02:41.910> only

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
and throw it down at your chest not only

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.420 
and throw it down at your chest not only
do<00:02:42.360> you<00:02:42.420> have<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.660> gauge<00:02:43.020> the<00:02:43.290> velocity<00:02:43.860> you

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
do you have to gauge the velocity you

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:46.670 
do you have to gauge the velocity you
have<00:02:44.610> to<00:02:44.790> gauge<00:02:45.000> as<00:02:45.300> a<00:02:45.360> hitter<00:02:45.750> where<00:02:46.440> you're

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
have to gauge as a hitter where you're

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.290 
have to gauge as a hitter where you're
going<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:46.980> try<00:02:47.160> to<00:02:47.190> make<00:02:47.430> contact<00:02:47.489> with<00:02:48.209> the

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300 
going to try to make contact with the

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.390 
going to try to make contact with the
baseball<00:02:48.510> no<00:02:49.470> matter<00:02:49.650> what<00:02:49.830> anybody<00:02:50.040> tells

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
baseball no matter what anybody tells

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.610 
baseball no matter what anybody tells
you<00:02:50.580> the<00:02:51.180> toughest<00:02:51.630> thing<00:02:51.810> to<00:02:51.959> do<00:02:52.110> in<00:02:52.260> sports

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
you the toughest thing to do in sports

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:55.009 
you the toughest thing to do in sports
is<00:02:52.890> to<00:02:53.100> hit<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.280> round<00:02:53.580> ball<00:02:53.790> with<00:02:54.420> a<00:02:54.450> round<00:02:54.780> bat

00:02:55.009 --> 00:02:55.019 
is to hit a round ball with a round bat

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:56.900 
is to hit a round ball with a round bat
and<00:02:55.290> hit<00:02:55.410> it<00:02:55.530> square<00:02:55.860> so<00:02:56.430> to<00:02:56.489> make<00:02:56.850> it

00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:56.910 
and hit it square so to make it

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:59.210 
and hit it square so to make it
difficult<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.630> hitters<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.650> higher<00:02:58.920> that

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
difficult for hitters the higher that

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:01.550 
difficult for hitters the higher that
you<00:02:59.400> can<00:02:59.640> create<00:02:59.880> an<00:03:00.150> arm<00:03:00.390> angle<00:03:00.810> and<00:03:00.959> throw<00:03:01.290> on

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560 
you can create an arm angle and throw on

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.400 
you can create an arm angle and throw on
a<00:03:01.590> downhill<00:03:02.010> plane<00:03:02.700> the<00:03:03.420> tougher<00:03:03.870> it<00:03:03.959> is<00:03:04.019> for<00:03:04.380> a

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
a downhill plane the tougher it is for a

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.490 
a downhill plane the tougher it is for a
hitter<00:03:04.650> to<00:03:04.920> gauge<00:03:05.130> how<00:03:05.820> far<00:03:06.209> this<00:03:06.720> mall<00:03:06.989> is<00:03:07.230> on

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
hitter to gauge how far this mall is on

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.560 
hitter to gauge how far this mall is on
a<00:03:07.530> down<00:03:07.860> plane<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.459> then<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.850> velocity<00:03:09.030> so

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
a down plane and then the velocity so

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:11.420 
a down plane and then the velocity so
you<00:03:09.630> have<00:03:09.840> two<00:03:10.019> things<00:03:10.290> as<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.500> hitter<00:03:10.739> that<00:03:11.220> you

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:11.430 
you have two things as a hitter that you

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:12.740 
you have two things as a hitter that you
have<00:03:11.550> to<00:03:11.670> contend<00:03:12.030> with<00:03:12.120> not<00:03:12.450> only<00:03:12.480> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
have to contend with not only the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:15.170 
have to contend with not only the
velocity<00:03:13.470> but<00:03:14.100> the<00:03:14.280> angle<00:03:14.700> that<00:03:14.820> the<00:03:14.970> ball<00:03:15.150> is

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:15.180 
velocity but the angle that the ball is

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:16.970 
velocity but the angle that the ball is
coming<00:03:15.450> to<00:03:15.720> it<00:03:15.870> and<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:16.590> you<00:03:16.709> would<00:03:16.769> try

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
coming to it and so what you would try

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.160 
coming to it and so what you would try
to<00:03:17.040> do<00:03:17.250> whether<00:03:17.489> you're<00:03:17.640> 6<00:03:18.000> foot<00:03:18.239> you're<00:03:18.420> 65<00:03:18.900> or

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:19.170 
to do whether you're 6 foot you're 65 or

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.860 
to do whether you're 6 foot you're 65 or
your<00:03:19.290> 4<00:03:19.530> foot<00:03:19.769> 11<00:03:20.160> the<00:03:20.760> taller<00:03:21.120> that<00:03:21.450> you<00:03:21.630> can

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
your 4 foot 11 the taller that you can

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.620 
your 4 foot 11 the taller that you can
stay<00:03:22.200> before<00:03:22.860> you<00:03:23.310> release<00:03:23.519> the<00:03:23.940> baseball<00:03:24.390> and

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
stay before you release the baseball and

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.930 
stay before you release the baseball and
throw<00:03:24.930> the<00:03:25.079> ball<00:03:25.290> with<00:03:25.860> a<00:03:25.890> higher<00:03:26.250> angle<00:03:26.549> have

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:26.940 
throw the ball with a higher angle have

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:28.520 
throw the ball with a higher angle have
the<00:03:27.090> ball<00:03:27.269> come<00:03:27.540> out<00:03:27.750> higher<00:03:28.019> or<00:03:28.320> you're

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:28.530 
the ball come out higher or you're

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:30.860 
the ball come out higher or you're
throwing<00:03:28.980> it<00:03:29.100> on<00:03:29.250> a<00:03:29.280> downhill<00:03:29.640> plane<00:03:30.180> the

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
throwing it on a downhill plane the

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:32.810 
throwing it on a downhill plane the
tougher<00:03:31.290> it<00:03:31.530> is<00:03:31.560> for<00:03:32.010> hitters<00:03:32.250> so<00:03:32.430> pitching

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:32.820 
tougher it is for hitters so pitching

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:35.000 
tougher it is for hitters so pitching
basically<00:03:33.360> boils<00:03:33.720> down<00:03:33.780> to<00:03:34.019> two<00:03:34.170> things<00:03:34.380> it's

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
basically boils down to two things it's

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.430 
basically boils down to two things it's
about<00:03:35.220> deception<00:03:35.790> being<00:03:36.540> smooth<00:03:36.930> having<00:03:37.350> the

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:37.440 
about deception being smooth having the

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.560 
about deception being smooth having the
ball<00:03:37.620> come<00:03:37.860> out<00:03:37.980> easy<00:03:38.250> and<00:03:38.549> it's<00:03:38.910> about<00:03:39.030> angles

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
ball come out easy and it's about angles

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.630 
ball come out easy and it's about angles
so<00:03:39.930> try<00:03:40.260> to<00:03:40.290> keep<00:03:40.440> your<00:03:40.769> arm<00:03:41.010> up<00:03:41.220> as<00:03:41.430> high<00:03:41.610> as

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:41.640 
so try to keep your arm up as high as

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.789 
so try to keep your arm up as high as
you<00:03:41.790> can<00:03:41.880> and<00:03:42.329> throw<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:43.019> ball<00:03:43.049> on<00:03:43.410> a<00:03:43.470> downhill

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
you can and throw the ball on a downhill

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:57.440 
you can and throw the ball on a downhill
plane<00:03:47.360> like

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:57.450
