00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 Good day to all today I 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.880
 tell you how in the program n tuna and 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.219
 draw a decent sketch of everything in 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.380
 pencil drawing sketch can 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:15.299
 draw as absolutely further on 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.840
 clean sheet but in this case i 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:20.220
 I use a jib and that was made 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:23.810
 pencil so first thing i would 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.310
 advised a new layer new host 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.859
 save immediately psd 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.510
 they are in the internal format with and firstly 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.399
 this format can not be read any 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:35.160
 except for the program and to 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:38.850
 and secondly, if suddenly something with this 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.270
 programs knocks you can always ps3 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:48.530
 open photoshop create choose file 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:52.579
 new create new canvas 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:56.480
 further file export from psd 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:59.910
 export it to the right folder and 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:03.329
 open already using control about or 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.030
 File Opponent New Psd Tail 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.340
 I already have this canvas scanned 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.119
 large enough high enough 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.240
 by permission 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:15.750
 How to learn well, for example , solution and 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.439
 through the site in general, this program is not particularly 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.979
 complex 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:23.790
 here is an intuitive menu and so 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:29.189
 to reduce or increase the resolution 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:31.710
 file size you need to climb rich with 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.710
 women strangled and here already exposes 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:38.189
 how many pixels canvas and says this 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.439
 trim tail some collided with 

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:42.659
 let's get around them so this program 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.060
 there is also in Russian but it's easier for me 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.220
 we use everything in English so 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.930
 someone as comfortable rather than that 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.909
 show and talk about each and 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.070
 Stream and now it is better to separate 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:57.060
 will show the pictures we create yet 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.190
 one layer call it ok it is more convenient that 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.690
 was clear 

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:03.690
 Tallinn at the bottom layer of transparency 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.110
 about 50 percent go to layer 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.240
 question one draw sketches can 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.979
 be what tools first it 

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:12.060
 pencil tool which is called 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.850
 alt key 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.739
 if it is not called by the key it can 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.260
 double click the tool and 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:21.690
 set and shot rollers shortcut keys 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.520
 access pencil basic settings 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.080
 which we need and which we 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.480
 we will often use it 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:30.870
 the minimum size that is shows 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 how much will it taper towards the ends of a hundred 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:33.590
 percent 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:37.470
 he is not supposed to taper at all 

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:39.900
 almost yes and the network is kind 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.110
 transparency sketches can be done not on 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.550
 one hundred percent transparency hard software 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:48.239
 softer harder 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:51.269
 can put hard he will draw 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:54.600
 fine go well mystery i'm drawing faces 

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:57.510
 and you can put the words when very 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:00.090
 soft soft pencil second tool 

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:04.079
 which can make sketches, etc. 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:07.019
 it is a standard tool it is even 

00:03:04.079 --> 00:03:09.209
 to the site david kostum here this tool 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:11.700
 quite saturated and personally I would not 

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.209
 began to draw them sketches do more 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.170
 line 

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:17.280
 same with the tool and ng im better 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.980
 just do line 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.860
 but you can also of course outline someone as 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:25.140
 more convenient brush tool 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:31.110
 very often used can also 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:33.239
 create a minimum size softness 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:35.940
 stiffness same settings as y 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.519
 pencil and Janko and persistently the same 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.970
 settings i will draw the tool 

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.930
 brush 

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:45.630
 set a minimum size of about 50 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:48.840
 percent transparency set not very 

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:51.989
 so there is no one hundred percent 70 percent 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.970
 the size is already as comfortable for someone as I saw 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.760
 my lessons with photoshop all, in principle, 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:59.820
 the same power tool is called 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:03.810
 with the e key and the settings are exactly 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:05.790
 same as other tools for 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.100
 we just fit eraser with 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.890
 transparency 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:13.340
 about 60 percent to carry a slave 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.520
 fully brush is called by the key in 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.980
 or b generally as who puts me 

00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:20.330
 key in 

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:22.610
 elastic keys for her for 

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:24.740
 just sketch these two keys we 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.350
 press accordingly for 

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.080
 transformations of any parts to and 

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:33.710
 passionate redraw push 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:36.290
 Kelly key , that is, the cube is pressed 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:37.610
 the q key select the part that we 

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:40.730
 need to transform 

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:46.790
 or move somewhere further click 

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:48.260
 control + t and move while holding 

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:50.350
 these holes 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.900
 we can reduce or increase 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.610
 proportional to the sixth or 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.120
 disproportionately without shifta 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:00.950
 respectively 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:06.020
 then press enter when everything is done and 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.580
 control + d object will transform 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.000
 those cancellations are done using 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:15.740
 keyboard shortcut control + z move 

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:19.070
 asset that is activated by instrument 

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.170
 hand with the space bar tool when 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.960
 we hold the gap you are fucking with your hands 

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:24.500
 we can navigate through the document so 

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.540
 when 

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:29.680
 rice sketch nears near 

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:32.810
 the bottom layer can be turned off and 

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:34.930
 see where else can you fix 

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.199
 to sketch was 

00:05:34.930 --> 00:05:40.360
 as accurately as possible and because we 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:43.590
 We will soon do this line when 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.229
 maximum finished sketch a pine to 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.030
 drawing the line above the layer with the question there 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:51.759
 create a layer call it 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:54.699
 line she just set opacity 

00:05:51.759 --> 00:05:57.009
 about 50 percent activate the layer 

00:05:54.699 --> 00:05:58.870
 lime line can be drawn 

00:05:57.009 --> 00:06:01.560
 And the same different tools whom as 

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:05.320
 more convenient in this case I use 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:07.750
 pink ink tool with minimal 

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:11.590
 the size of 0 percent so personally 

00:06:07.750 --> 00:06:14.370
 It turns out to be more careful how to do it 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:16.900
 who is more comfortable 200 put one hundred percent 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.400
 increase image resolution for 

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:23.050
 this we climb in a woman is strangled and 

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:24.460
 We put a little more in general, then here and 

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:27.750
 so big enough resolution 

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:30.310
 so at the moment I will not change 

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.780
 the resolution should be somewhere three or four 

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:35.259
 thousand pixels 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:38.080
 Well, it can be like 2000 pixels but 

00:06:35.259 --> 00:06:39.820
 no less start catching here in 

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.060
 In principle, everything is the same as in 

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:45.550
 photoshop if you watched 

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:48.159
 a series of my video lessons on photoshop who 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.650
 it says that the site would not be better 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:53.949
 I do not think to be friends with the tablet 

00:06:50.650 --> 00:06:54.550
 I believe that what is the site that photoshop is 

00:06:53.949 --> 00:06:57.280
 principle 

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:59.669
 the tablet is friends the same difference only 

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:02.710
 in u interface and toolbox 

00:06:59.669 --> 00:07:03.490
 here we adjust all our settings 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:07.750
 tool 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.909
 as well as the keys on the keyboard we can 

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:12.220
 reduce or increase the size of the brush 

00:07:09.909 --> 00:07:14.139
 instead of ears push these buttons it 

00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:19.020
 curly keys 

00:07:14.139 --> 00:07:20.090
 or b and so in that spirit about 

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:22.070
 continue 

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:24.820
 little thread do it all the lines are thicker 

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:24.820
 somewhere longer
