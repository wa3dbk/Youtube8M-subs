00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.429 

welcome<00:00:02.909> to<00:00:03.000> the<00:00:03.090> tutorial<00:00:03.439> understanding

00:00:04.429 --> 00:00:04.439 
welcome to the tutorial understanding

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:06.499 
welcome to the tutorial understanding
the<00:00:04.529> library<00:00:04.979> in<00:00:05.220> this<00:00:05.759> tutorial<00:00:05.939> I'm<00:00:06.480> going

00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:06.509 
the library in this tutorial I'm going

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:08.420 
the library in this tutorial I'm going
to<00:00:06.839> go<00:00:06.959> over<00:00:06.990> the<00:00:07.379> structure<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.979> library

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:08.430 
to go over the structure of the library

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.340 
to go over the structure of the library
as<00:00:08.580> well<00:00:09.150> as<00:00:09.270> go<00:00:09.450> into<00:00:09.660> the<00:00:09.750> concept<00:00:10.230> of

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:10.350 
as well as go into the concept of

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:13.010 
as well as go into the concept of
symbols<00:00:10.860> and<00:00:11.039> templates<00:00:11.639> so<00:00:12.449> to<00:00:12.510> begin<00:00:12.690> let's

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:13.020 
symbols and templates so to begin let's

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.420 
symbols and templates so to begin let's
go<00:00:13.139> to<00:00:13.230> the<00:00:13.350> library<00:00:13.799> which<00:00:14.010> is<00:00:14.129> generally

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:14.430 
go to the library which is generally

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.519 
go to the library which is generally
found<00:00:14.639> behind<00:00:14.910> the<00:00:15.119> tool<00:00:15.389> properties<00:00:15.959> tab<00:00:16.170> and

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
found behind the tool properties tab and

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.010 
found behind the tool properties tab and
then<00:00:17.520> let's<00:00:17.699> expand<00:00:18.150> it<00:00:18.240> so<00:00:18.360> it<00:00:18.540> takes<00:00:18.720> up<00:00:18.900> as

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
then let's expand it so it takes up as

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.110 
then let's expand it so it takes up as
full<00:00:19.260> space<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:22.160> so<00:00:23.160> the<00:00:23.580> library<00:00:24.000> is<00:00:24.060> a

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.120 
full space here so the library is a

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.380 
full space here so the library is a
place<00:00:24.150> that<00:00:24.330> you<00:00:24.570> can<00:00:24.720> store<00:00:25.369> characters

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:26.390 
place that you can store characters

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:28.609 
place that you can store characters
backgrounds<00:00:27.390> props<00:00:27.720> anything<00:00:28.350> that<00:00:28.470> you've

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
backgrounds props anything that you've

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.029 
backgrounds props anything that you've
made<00:00:28.970> in<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.030> software<00:00:30.900> so<00:00:31.650> that<00:00:31.680> you<00:00:31.860> can

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:32.039 
made in the software so that you can

00:00:32.039 --> 00:00:34.520 
made in the software so that you can
reuse<00:00:32.460> it<00:00:32.489> in<00:00:32.940> a<00:00:33.300> different<00:00:33.510> scene<00:00:33.930> throughout

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:34.530 
reuse it in a different scene throughout

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.229 
reuse it in a different scene throughout
different<00:00:34.890> projects<00:00:35.850> on<00:00:35.940> different

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
different projects on different

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:37.939 
different projects on different
computers<00:00:36.329> you<00:00:36.780> can<00:00:36.929> even<00:00:37.050> like<00:00:37.350> transfer

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
computers you can even like transfer

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.479 
computers you can even like transfer
templates<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.909> are<00:00:39.059> stored<00:00:39.359> in<00:00:39.659> the<00:00:39.960> library

00:00:40.479 --> 00:00:40.489 
templates that are stored in the library

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:43.369 
templates that are stored in the library
through<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> network<00:00:41.819> to<00:00:42.659> other<00:00:42.690> people's

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
through the network to other people's

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.809 
through the network to other people's
computers<00:00:43.859> and<00:00:44.100> they<00:00:44.219> can<00:00:44.370> use<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:44.729> the

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:44.819 
computers and they can use it in the

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:47.209 
computers and they can use it in the
software<00:00:45.179> on<00:00:45.269> their<00:00:45.420> own<00:00:45.539> system<00:00:46.069> so<00:00:47.069> there

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
software on their own system so there

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.919 
software on their own system so there
are<00:00:47.309> two<00:00:47.460> types<00:00:47.699> of<00:00:47.969> files<00:00:48.420> that<00:00:48.659> you<00:00:48.749> can

00:00:48.919 --> 00:00:48.929 
are two types of files that you can

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:50.450 
are two types of files that you can
store<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.379> the<00:00:49.499> library<00:00:49.949> and<00:00:50.069> those<00:00:50.309> are

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
store in the library and those are

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.119 
store in the library and those are
symbols<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.089> templates<00:00:51.780> so<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.710> create<00:00:52.949> a

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
symbols and templates so to create a

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:54.829 
symbols and templates so to create a
symbol<00:00:53.579> which<00:00:53.969> we<00:00:54.120> haven't<00:00:54.449> done<00:00:54.539> yet<00:00:54.600> an

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
symbol which we haven't done yet an

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.660 
symbol which we haven't done yet an
animate<00:00:55.199> pro<00:00:55.409> but<00:00:55.739> we<00:00:55.829> did<00:00:56.039> do<00:00:56.249> in<00:00:56.489> the

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
animate pro but we did do in the

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:59.809 
animate pro but we did do in the
previous<00:00:57.239> animate<00:00:58.049> videos<00:00:58.559> and<00:00:58.920> you<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.809 --> 00:00:59.819 
previous animate videos and you just

00:00:59.819 --> 00:01:00.979 
previous animate videos and you just
have<00:00:59.969> to<00:01:00.059> select<00:01:00.329> whatever<00:01:00.539> you<00:01:00.780> want<00:01:00.929> to

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
have to select whatever you want to

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.419 
have to select whatever you want to
create<00:01:01.170> into<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> symbol<00:01:01.799> and<00:01:01.979> you<00:01:02.069> press<00:01:02.249> this

00:01:02.419 --> 00:01:02.429 
create into a symbol and you press this

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:05.750 
create into a symbol and you press this
button<00:01:02.639> here<00:01:02.789> at<00:01:03.269> the<00:01:03.719> top<00:01:04.070> and<00:01:05.070> then<00:01:05.519> you<00:01:05.640> can

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
button here at the top and then you can

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:15.279 
button here at the top and then you can
rename<00:01:06.090> it<00:01:06.299> to<00:01:06.329> whatever<00:01:06.570> you<00:01:06.810> want<00:01:13.130> like<00:01:14.130> that

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:15.289 
rename it to whatever you want like that

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:18.139 
rename it to whatever you want like that
and<00:01:16.289> then<00:01:17.250> you'll<00:01:17.399> see<00:01:17.579> that<00:01:17.700> instead<00:01:18.030> of

00:01:18.139 --> 00:01:18.149 
and then you'll see that instead of

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:19.580 
and then you'll see that instead of
changing<00:01:18.359> anything<00:01:18.719> here<00:01:18.960> the<00:01:19.020> timeline<00:01:19.500> it

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
changing anything here the timeline it

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.730 
changing anything here the timeline it
actually<00:01:19.979> just<00:01:20.100> added<00:01:20.520> this<00:01:20.670> in<00:01:21.200> the<00:01:22.200> symbol

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
actually just added this in the symbol

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.459 
actually just added this in the symbol
library<00:01:22.920> it's<00:01:23.759> denoted<00:01:24.060> by<00:01:24.240> this<00:01:24.390> Lego<00:01:25.049> brick

00:01:25.459 --> 00:01:25.469 
library it's denoted by this Lego brick

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:30.410 
library it's denoted by this Lego brick
icon<00:01:27.500> what<00:01:28.500> as<00:01:28.619> symbol<00:01:28.950> is<00:01:29.039> exactly<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.880> I

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
icon what as symbol is exactly and I

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.450 
icon what as symbol is exactly and I
think<00:01:30.899> flash<00:01:31.229> users<00:01:32.070> are<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.219> bit<00:01:32.369> more

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
think flash users are a bit more

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.940 
think flash users are a bit more
familiar<00:01:32.939> with<00:01:33.090> it<00:01:33.299> then<00:01:33.810> maybe<00:01:34.020> a<00:01:34.229> toon<00:01:34.799> boom

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:34.950 
familiar with it then maybe a toon boom

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.130 
familiar with it then maybe a toon boom
software<00:01:35.369> users<00:01:35.700> but<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:36.420> like<00:01:36.570> a<00:01:36.600> container

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
software users but it's like a container

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
software users but it's like a container
that<00:01:37.409> you<00:01:37.439> can<00:01:37.710> contain<00:01:38.570> an<00:01:39.570> entire<00:01:40.820> animated

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
that you can contain an entire animated

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.849 
that you can contain an entire animated
sequence<00:01:42.240> in<00:01:42.420> you<00:01:42.570> can<00:01:42.719> just<00:01:42.929> have<00:01:43.500> one

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
sequence in you can just have one

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:45.469 
sequence in you can just have one
character<00:01:44.369> in<00:01:44.429> it<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.759> have<00:01:44.909> multiple

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
character in it you can have multiple

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.489 
character in it you can have multiple
body<00:01:45.929> parts<00:01:46.049> a<00:01:46.560> single<00:01:47.549> body<00:01:47.700> part<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.240> then

00:01:48.489 --> 00:01:48.499 
body parts a single body part and then

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.989 
body parts a single body part and then
connect<00:01:49.499> them<00:01:49.590> together<00:01:49.799> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.759> timeline

00:01:50.989 --> 00:01:50.999 
connect them together in the timeline

00:01:50.999 --> 00:01:53.149 
connect them together in the timeline
and<00:01:51.479> it's<00:01:51.689> just<00:01:51.869> like<00:01:51.990> a<00:01:52.020> container<00:01:52.499> that<00:01:53.130> you

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:53.159 
and it's just like a container that you

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.279 
and it's just like a container that you
can<00:01:53.429> then<00:01:53.579> animate<00:01:54.090> directly<00:01:54.570> on<00:01:54.689> but<00:01:55.109> if<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.279 --> 00:01:55.289 
can then animate directly on but if I

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:58.550 
can then animate directly on but if I
drag<00:01:55.770> this<00:01:55.950> into<00:01:56.159> the<00:01:56.369> timeline<00:01:57.229> you<00:01:58.229> can<00:01:58.380> see

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
drag this into the timeline you can see

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.219 
drag this into the timeline you can see
that's<00:01:58.740> denoted<00:01:59.009> by<00:01:59.219> this<00:01:59.880> film<00:02:00.329> strip<00:02:00.780> that's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
that's denoted by this film strip that's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.090 
that's denoted by this film strip that's
how<00:02:01.350> you<00:02:01.409> can<00:02:01.560> tell<00:02:01.590> the<00:02:01.740> difference<00:02:01.920> between

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
how you can tell the difference between

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.010 
how you can tell the difference between
what<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.579> symbol<00:02:02.999> is<00:02:03.119> in<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.390> timeline<00:02:03.630> and

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
what a symbol is in the timeline and

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.739 
what a symbol is in the timeline and
what<00:02:04.619> regular<00:02:05.280> drawings<00:02:05.729> are<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.179> the

00:02:06.739 --> 00:02:06.749 
what regular drawings are in the

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:08.150 
what regular drawings are in the
timeline<00:02:06.990> or<00:02:07.380> even<00:02:07.649> tablets<00:02:08.009> because

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
timeline or even tablets because

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.330 
timeline or even tablets because
templates<00:02:08.670> look<00:02:08.850> identical<00:02:09.509> to<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.170> original

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:10.340 
templates look identical to the original

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:12.860 
templates look identical to the original
the<00:02:11.340> difference<00:02:11.700> though<00:02:11.910> is<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.150> symbols

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
the difference though is that symbols

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.810 
the difference though is that symbols
are<00:02:12.990> actually<00:02:13.560> linked<00:02:14.010> to<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> original<00:02:14.610> and

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:14.820 
are actually linked to the original and

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:15.559 
are actually linked to the original and
with<00:02:15.090> this<00:02:15.210> me

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
with this me

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.569 
with this me
that<00:02:15.900> if<00:02:16.049> I<00:02:16.140> make<00:02:16.319> a<00:02:16.349> change<00:02:16.769> to<00:02:17.069> this<00:02:17.219> symbol

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:17.579 
that if I make a change to this symbol

00:02:17.579 --> 00:02:19.580 
that if I make a change to this symbol
that's<00:02:17.760> currently<00:02:18.239> in<00:02:18.329> my<00:02:18.510> timeline<00:02:18.840> that

that's currently in my timeline that

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.979 
that's currently in my timeline that
change<00:02:20.010> will<00:02:20.189> be<00:02:20.280> saved<00:02:20.609> and<00:02:20.790> updated<00:02:21.450> in<00:02:21.599> the

00:02:38.059 --> 00:02:38.069 
change to a symbol is that you simply

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:40.640 
change to a symbol is that you simply
have<00:02:38.340> to<00:02:38.370> double<00:02:38.760> click<00:02:38.969> somewhere<00:02:39.900> on<00:02:40.230> this

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
have to double click somewhere on this

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
film strip in the timeline and then now

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.170 
film strip in the timeline and then now
you're<00:02:43.709> inside<00:02:44.280> that<00:02:44.549> container<00:02:44.730> you're

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
you're inside that container you're

inside that symbol and what is inside

00:02:47.219 --> 00:02:49.729 
inside that symbol and what is inside
that<00:02:47.459> symbol<00:02:47.849> is<00:02:47.939> exactly<00:02:48.419> what<00:02:48.780> is<00:02:49.049> outside

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
that symbol is exactly what is outside

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.379 
that symbol is exactly what is outside
and<00:02:49.889> that's<00:02:50.159> the<00:02:50.340> template<00:02:50.819> that<00:02:51.269> we

00:02:51.389 --> 00:02:53.270 
and that's the template that we
encapsulated<00:02:52.049> encased<00:02:52.620> in<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.889> symbol<00:02:53.159> it's

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
at karate rabbit master and you can tell

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.830 
at karate rabbit master and you can tell

scenes or multiple projects on your

scenes or multiple projects on your
computer<00:03:37.169> then<00:03:37.290> you'd<00:03:37.470> have<00:03:37.620> to<00:03:37.919> create<00:03:38.189> a

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250

computer then you'd have to create a
template<00:03:38.759> from<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.239> so<00:03:39.870> that's<00:03:40.019> one<00:03:40.169> of<00:03:40.199> the

big<00:03:40.530> differences<00:03:40.739> because<00:03:41.489> with<00:03:42.060> templates

00:03:42.879 --> 00:03:42.889 
big differences because with templates

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.289 
big differences because with templates

would not update throughout these

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.140 
would not update throughout these

up<00:03:57.269> a<00:03:57.449> different<00:03:57.780> scene<00:03:57.959> if<00:03:58.169> I<00:03:58.290> create<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.590> new

00:03:58.699 --> 00:03:58.709 
up a different scene if I create a new

will<00:04:01.949> in<00:04:02.009> fact<00:04:02.189> be<00:04:02.370> there<00:04:02.790> they<00:04:03.540> exist<00:04:03.840> on<00:04:04.079> a

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:04.139 
will in fact be there they exist on a

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:06.740 
will in fact be there they exist on a

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
place on my hard drive so I can always

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.379 
place on my hard drive so I can always
search<00:04:06.900> for<00:04:06.959> them<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:07.620> they<00:04:07.739> will<00:04:07.859> open<00:04:08.280> up

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:08.389 
search for them but they will open up

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.699 
search for them but they will open up
automatically<00:04:09.389> so<00:04:10.019> now<00:04:10.139> let's<00:04:10.319> take<00:04:10.439> a<00:04:10.469> look

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
automatically so now let's take a look

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.920 
automatically so now let's take a look
at<00:04:10.769> the<00:04:10.889> library<00:04:11.400> structure<00:04:12.090> so<00:04:12.689> the<00:04:12.780> first

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:12.930 
at the library structure so the first

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.119 
at the library structure so the first
thing<00:04:13.049> we're<00:04:13.229> going<00:04:13.319> to<00:04:13.379> take<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> look<00:04:13.739> at<00:04:13.889> is

00:04:14.119 --> 00:04:14.129 
thing we're going to take a look at is

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.459 
thing we're going to take a look at is
the<00:04:14.159> View<00:04:14.699> menu<00:04:14.729> which<00:04:15.269> is<00:04:15.419> right<00:04:15.629> here<00:04:15.659> so<00:04:16.409> if

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:16.469 
the View menu which is right here so if

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:17.990 
the View menu which is right here so if
you<00:04:16.530> click<00:04:16.709> on<00:04:16.799> it<00:04:17.099> you<00:04:17.130> can<00:04:17.549> see<00:04:17.789> that<00:04:17.820> your

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
one of the main ones that we use often

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.050 
one of the main ones that we use often
is<00:04:34.530> that<00:04:34.680> there's<00:04:34.830> a<00:04:34.889> lock<00:04:35.160> as<00:04:35.460> you<00:04:35.699> can<00:04:35.820> see<00:04:36.030> on

redundancy<00:05:01.889> which<00:05:01.919> is<00:05:02.190> generally<00:05:02.430> good

00:05:02.689 --> 00:05:02.699 
redundancy which is generally good

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.400 
redundancy which is generally good
sometimes<00:05:03.300> people<00:05:03.660> have<00:05:03.840> difficulties

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:04.410 
sometimes people have difficulties

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.930 
sometimes people have difficulties

you find it sort of bulking it gets in

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:44.600 
you find it sort of bulking it gets in
the<00:05:43.229> way<00:05:43.410> you<00:05:43.470> can<00:05:43.680> always<00:05:43.889> get<00:05:44.039> rid<00:05:44.250> of<00:05:44.280> it<00:05:44.430> by

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610 
the way you can always get rid of it by

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.810 
the way you can always get rid of it by
going<00:05:44.729> to<00:05:44.880> windows<00:05:45.320> toolbars<00:05:46.610> library<00:05:47.610> view

00:05:47.810 --> 00:05:47.820 
going to windows toolbars library view

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:50.029 
going to windows toolbars library view
and<00:05:48.090> it<00:05:48.180> eliminates<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.320> or<00:05:49.500> you<00:05:49.620> can<00:05:49.770> bring<00:05:49.889> it

00:05:50.029 --> 00:05:50.039 
and it eliminates it or you can bring it

00:05:50.039 --> 00:05:55.460 
and it eliminates it or you can bring it
back<00:05:50.250> exactly<00:05:51.180> the<00:05:51.720> same<00:05:51.930> way<00:05:54.199> so<00:05:55.199> this<00:05:55.320> brings

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
back exactly the same way so this brings

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.710 
back exactly the same way so this brings
me<00:05:55.680> into<00:05:55.830> the<00:05:55.979> next<00:05:56.220> part<00:05:56.820> of<00:05:57.000> the<00:05:57.240> library

here like that you can even make this

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:15.430 
here like that you can even make this
bigger<00:06:12.919> so<00:06:13.919> you<00:06:13.979> can<00:06:14.130> even<00:06:14.250> see<00:06:14.370> it<00:06:14.610> bigger

bigger so you can even see it bigger
which<00:06:16.440> is<00:06:16.590> a<00:06:16.620> pretty<00:06:16.830> neat<00:06:17.010> thing

00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:20.910 

00:06:20.910 --> 00:06:23.090 

if<00:06:21.330> you<00:06:21.840> have<00:06:22.020> a<00:06:22.050> template<00:06:22.470> with<00:06:22.620> multiple

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
if you have a template with multiple

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:25.240 
if you have a template with multiple
drawings<00:06:23.340> like<00:06:23.670> I<00:06:23.760> know<00:06:23.820> we<00:06:24.120> have<00:06:24.360> for<00:06:24.780> the

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
drawings like I know we have for the

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.460 
drawings like I know we have for the
karate<00:06:26.250> master<00:06:26.940> then<00:06:27.510> if<00:06:27.690> you<00:06:27.870> slide<00:06:28.230> along

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:28.470 
karate master then if you slide along

00:06:28.470 --> 00:06:30.710 
karate master then if you slide along
these<00:06:28.620> nudges<00:06:29.070> you<00:06:29.310> can<00:06:29.490> see<00:06:29.850> that<00:06:30.540> you<00:06:30.690> know

00:06:30.710 --> 00:06:30.720 
these nudges you can see that you know

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:32.000 
these nudges you can see that you know
you<00:06:30.870> can<00:06:31.080> see<00:06:31.260> the<00:06:31.380> three-quarter<00:06:31.890> and

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:32.010 
you can see the three-quarter and

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:34.430 
you can see the three-quarter and
profile<00:06:32.480> view<00:06:33.480> which<00:06:33.660> is<00:06:33.810> pretty<00:06:33.960> cool<00:06:34.200> so<00:06:34.350> you

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:34.440 
profile view which is pretty cool so you

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:36.080 
profile view which is pretty cool so you
can<00:06:34.560> see<00:06:34.770> what<00:06:34.860> else<00:06:34.950> exists<00:06:35.520> in<00:06:35.670> that

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:36.090 
can see what else exists in that

00:06:36.090 --> 00:06:38.360 
can see what else exists in that
template<00:06:36.570> through<00:06:37.440> this<00:06:37.590> preview<00:06:38.130> window

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:38.370

template through this preview window
here<00:06:39.230> the<00:06:40.230> next<00:06:40.500> part<00:06:40.650> of<00:06:40.740> the<00:06:40.830> library<00:06:41.340> is

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:41.580 
here the next part of the library is

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.360 
here the next part of the library is
where<00:06:41.850> we<00:06:42.000> house<00:06:42.240> the<00:06:43.020> actual<00:06:43.620> library<00:06:44.220> so<00:06:44.310> we

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:44.370 
where we house the actual library so we

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:45.680 
where we house the actual library so we
have<00:06:44.460> a<00:06:44.520> symbol<00:06:44.850> library<00:06:45.000> and<00:06:45.480> we<00:06:45.540> have<00:06:45.630> the

00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:45.690 
have a symbol library and we have the

00:06:45.690 --> 00:06:48.110 
have a symbol library and we have the
anime<00:06:46.020> pro<00:06:46.320> library<00:06:46.830> so<00:06:47.430> the<00:06:47.550> symbol<00:06:47.910> library

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:48.120 
anime pro library so the symbol library

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.260 
anime pro library so the symbol library
is<00:06:48.720> unique<00:06:49.590> you<00:06:50.070> cannot<00:06:50.340> create<00:06:50.700> another

00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:51.270 
is unique you cannot create another

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:53.360 
is unique you cannot create another
symbol<00:06:51.690> library<00:06:51.900> this<00:06:52.590> is<00:06:52.740> the<00:06:52.830> only<00:06:52.860> play

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:53.370 
symbol library this is the only play

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.100 
symbol library this is the only play
that's<00:06:53.640> in<00:06:53.760> your<00:06:53.880> scene<00:06:54.120> where<00:06:54.480> symbols<00:06:54.930> can

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:55.110 
that's in your scene where symbols can

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:57.560 
that's in your scene where symbols can
be<00:06:55.170> housed<00:06:55.530> you<00:06:56.430> can<00:06:56.580> make<00:06:56.700> subfolders<00:06:57.300> for

00:06:57.560 --> 00:06:57.570 
be housed you can make subfolders for

00:06:57.570 --> 00:06:59.360 
be housed you can make subfolders for
your<00:06:57.720> symbol<00:06:58.140> by<00:06:58.410> right-clicking<00:06:58.860> and<00:06:59.070> saying

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 
your symbol by right-clicking and saying

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:02.090 
your symbol by right-clicking and saying
new<00:07:00.000> folder<00:07:00.450> and<00:07:00.900> then<00:07:00.960> one<00:07:01.620> appears<00:07:01.920> beneath

00:07:02.090 --> 00:07:02.100 
new folder and then one appears beneath

00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:04.190 
new folder and then one appears beneath
so<00:07:02.940> you<00:07:03.030> could<00:07:03.150> at<00:07:03.300> least<00:07:03.450> organize<00:07:04.020> your

00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:04.200 
so you could at least organize your

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.990 
so you could at least organize your
symbols<00:07:04.560> but<00:07:04.740> you<00:07:04.830> can<00:07:04.980> never<00:07:05.070> create<00:07:05.490> another

00:07:05.990 --> 00:07:06.000 
symbols but you can never create another

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.540 
symbols but you can never create another
symbol<00:07:06.420> folder<00:07:06.810> because<00:07:07.680> they<00:07:07.830> are<00:07:07.980> so<00:07:08.250> unique

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:08.550 
symbol folder because they are so unique

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:10.390 
symbol folder because they are so unique
in<00:07:08.670> their<00:07:08.760> coding<00:07:09.150> they<00:07:09.270> can<00:07:09.420> only<00:07:09.600> be<00:07:09.870> stored

00:07:10.390 --> 00:07:10.400 
in their coding they can only be stored

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:13.670 
in their coding they can only be stored
here<00:07:11.400> however<00:07:12.210> for<00:07:12.600> the<00:07:12.720> template<00:07:13.230> library

templates<00:07:22.950> in<00:07:23.160> them<00:07:23.370> so<00:07:23.550> templates<00:07:24.060> are<00:07:24.180> less

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:24.420 
templates in them so templates are less

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:26.960 
templates in them so templates are less
finicky<00:07:24.930> the<00:07:25.620> last<00:07:25.860> part<00:07:26.190> of<00:07:26.220> the<00:07:26.340> library<00:07:26.760> is

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:26.970 
finicky the last part of the library is

00:07:26.970 --> 00:07:28.430 
finicky the last part of the library is
the<00:07:27.390> one<00:07:27.540> that<00:07:27.660> I've<00:07:27.810> pretty<00:07:28.080> much<00:07:28.170> already

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:28.440 
the one that I've pretty much already

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:30.890 
the one that I've pretty much already
showed<00:07:28.710> you<00:07:29.060> the<00:07:30.060> only<00:07:30.210> thing<00:07:30.330> that<00:07:30.660> you<00:07:30.690> might

00:07:30.890 --> 00:07:30.900 
showed you the only thing that you might

00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:31.700 
showed you the only thing that you might
want<00:07:31.110> to<00:07:31.170> know<00:07:31.200> is<00:07:31.380> that<00:07:31.410> through

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:31.710 
want to know is that through

00:07:31.710 --> 00:07:34.030 
want to know is that through
right-clicking<00:07:32.130> you<00:07:32.400> can<00:07:32.580> once<00:07:33.210> again<00:07:33.360> change

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:34.040 
right-clicking you can once again change

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:40.010 
right-clicking you can once again change
the<00:07:35.040> views<00:07:38.450> which<00:07:39.450> is<00:07:39.600> I<00:07:39.690> think<00:07:39.720> the<00:07:39.990> only

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:40.020 
the views which is I think the only

00:07:40.020 --> 00:07:42.140 
the views which is I think the only
thing<00:07:40.230> you<00:07:40.470> need<00:07:40.620> to<00:07:40.650> know<00:07:40.770> about<00:07:41.010> it<00:07:41.310> and

00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:42.150 
thing you need to know about it and

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.210 
thing you need to know about it and
otherwise<00:07:42.840> it's<00:07:43.169> really<00:07:43.440> just<00:07:43.590> this<00:07:43.830> you<00:07:44.070> can

00:07:44.210 --> 00:07:44.220 
otherwise it's really just this you can

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:47.810 
otherwise it's really just this you can
see<00:07:44.610> what<00:07:45.270> are<00:07:45.390> in<00:07:45.860> your<00:07:46.860> libraries<00:07:47.490> that<00:07:47.760> are

00:07:47.810 --> 00:07:47.820 
see what are in your libraries that are

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.230 
see what are in your libraries that are
listed<00:07:48.150> here<00:07:48.330> on<00:07:48.780> the<00:07:48.900> left<00:07:49.140> side<00:07:50.030> so<00:07:51.030> that's
