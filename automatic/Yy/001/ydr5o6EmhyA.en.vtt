00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
glue and since they are so simple you

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:52.700 
glue and since they are so simple you
can<00:00:44.969> make<00:00:45.270> a<00:00:45.300> whole<00:00:45.600> bunch<00:00:45.840> really<00:00:46.320> fast<00:00:51.710> and

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.760 
now we made these in February of 2013 so
that<00:00:59.460> makes<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.090> a<00:01:00.300> little<00:01:00.840> over<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.320> year<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.739> a

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
that makes it a little over a year and a

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.460 
that makes it a little over a year and a
half<00:01:01.949> so<00:01:02.430> they're<00:01:03.300> holding<00:01:03.780> up<00:01:03.930> I<00:01:04.110> think

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
half so they're holding up I think

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.710 
half so they're holding up I think
pretty<00:01:04.890> pretty<00:01:05.369> well<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:05.880> I<00:01:06.299> love<00:01:06.479> how<00:01:06.659> the

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
pretty pretty well and I love how the

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.539 
pretty pretty well and I love how the
craft<00:01:07.110> foam<00:01:07.320> got<00:01:07.650> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.950> messed<00:01:08.159> up<00:01:08.369> when

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
craft foam got a little messed up when

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
craft foam got a little messed up when
we<00:01:08.640> cut<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.060> because<00:01:09.210> it<00:01:09.960> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.290> reminds<00:01:10.619> me

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
we cut it because it kind of reminds me

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.190 
we cut it because it kind of reminds me
of<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:10.979> cake<00:01:11.250> crumbling<00:01:11.970> a<00:01:12.119> little<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:13.049> is

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
of the cake crumbling a little and it is

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.750 
of the cake crumbling a little and it is
important<00:01:13.770> to<00:01:13.799> remember<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.280> when<00:01:14.549> making

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
important to remember that when making

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.120 
important to remember that when making
one<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.150> these<00:01:15.240> cakes<00:01:15.650> you<00:01:16.650> really<00:01:16.920> need<00:01:17.070> to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
one of these cakes you really need to

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.980 
one of these cakes you really need to
try<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> get<00:01:17.549> the<00:01:17.670> glue<00:01:17.970> over<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> entire

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
try to get the glue over the entire

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.190 
try to get the glue over the entire
surface<00:01:19.619> of<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.610> foam<00:01:20.970> before<00:01:21.540> adding<00:01:22.110> the

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
surface of the foam before adding the

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.560 
surface of the foam before adding the
layer<00:01:22.409> otherwise<00:01:23.040> when<00:01:23.820> you<00:01:23.909> cut<00:01:24.240> it<00:01:24.450> you're

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
layer otherwise when you cut it you're

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.020 
layer otherwise when you cut it you're
going<00:01:24.750> to<00:01:24.810> get<00:01:24.930> gaps<00:01:25.200> or<00:01:25.619> air<00:01:26.250> pockets<00:01:26.790> between

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
going to get gaps or air pockets between

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.749 
going to get gaps or air pockets between
the<00:01:27.360> layers<00:01:27.600> which<00:01:28.470> can<00:01:28.829> create<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.189> little<00:01:29.549> bit

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the layers which can create a little bit

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.670 
the layers which can create a little bit
of<00:01:29.880> a<00:01:29.970> problem<00:01:30.210> when<00:01:30.570> you<00:01:30.659> go<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:30.900> cut<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
of a problem when you go to cut the

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.039 
of a problem when you go to cut the
slice<00:01:31.979> and<00:01:32.009> your<00:01:32.640> cake<00:01:32.939> completely<00:01:33.450> falls

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
slice and your cake completely falls

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:38.630 
slice and your cake completely falls
apart<00:01:34.759> good<00:01:35.759> then<00:01:36.060> you're<00:01:36.240> like<00:01:36.390> Oh<00:01:37.640> cake

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
apart good then you're like Oh cake

smash I totally understand

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:43.790 
smash I totally understand
and<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.390> it<00:01:42.570> feels<00:01:42.900> to<00:01:43.260> be<00:01:43.290> working<00:01:43.680> on<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:43.800 
and now it feels to be working on a

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.040 
and now it feels to be working on a
project<00:01:44.190> for<00:01:44.220> a<00:01:44.370> while<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.330> to<00:01:45.630> have<00:01:45.900> it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
project for a while I like to have it

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:54.920 
project for a while I like to have it
all<00:01:46.230> fall<00:01:46.620> apart<00:01:46.920> in<00:01:47.310> the<00:01:48.120> end<00:01:52.940> yeah<00:01:53.940> not<00:01:54.720> one

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
all fall apart in the end yeah not one

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.890 
all fall apart in the end yeah not one
of<00:01:54.990> my<00:01:55.260> favorite<00:01:56.100> things<00:01:56.370> but<00:01:57.090> it's<00:01:57.390> how<00:01:57.870> we

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
of my favorite things but it's how we

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.390 
of my favorite things but it's how we
learn<00:01:58.230> what<00:01:58.560> not<00:01:58.800> to<00:01:59.040> do

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
learn what not to do

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.180 
learn what not to do
like<00:01:59.850> I<00:02:00.090> also<00:02:00.330> learned<00:02:00.750> that<00:02:00.990> I<00:02:01.410> prefer<00:02:01.980> it

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
like I also learned that I prefer it

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:04.160 
like I also learned that I prefer it
when<00:02:02.220> I<00:02:02.400> use<00:02:02.460> alternating<00:02:03.270> colors<00:02:03.660> of<00:02:03.930> the

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
when I use alternating colors of the

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.590 
when I use alternating colors of the
craft<00:02:04.470> foam<00:02:04.710> rather<00:02:05.490> than<00:02:05.730> trying<00:02:06.060> to<00:02:06.180> glue

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
craft foam rather than trying to glue

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.499 
craft foam rather than trying to glue
the<00:02:07.590> same<00:02:07.800> color<00:02:08.100> together<00:02:08.399> because<00:02:09.149> then<00:02:09.360> you

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
the same color together because then you

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.230 
the same color together because then you
can<00:02:09.660> see<00:02:09.869> a<00:02:09.899> line<00:02:10.259> for<00:02:11.040> is<00:02:11.190> here<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.850> looks<00:02:12.090> a

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
can see a line for is here it looks a

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.990 
can see a line for is here it looks a
lot<00:02:12.450> cleaner<00:02:12.840> and<00:02:13.110> when<00:02:14.040> storing<00:02:14.550> the<00:02:14.730> cakes

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 
lot cleaner and when storing the cakes

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.260 
lot cleaner and when storing the cakes
side<00:02:15.540> by<00:02:15.750> side<00:02:16.170> over<00:02:16.890> a<00:02:17.100> long<00:02:17.520> period<00:02:18.000> of<00:02:18.030> time

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
side by side over a long period of time

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.010 
side by side over a long period of time
the<00:02:19.140> puff<00:02:19.470> paint<00:02:19.800> may<00:02:20.280> begin<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:21.000> stick<00:02:21.300> which

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:22.020 
the puff paint may begin to stick which

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:24.680 
the puff paint may begin to stick which
can<00:02:22.410> damage<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.340> project<00:02:23.880> so<00:02:24.060> make<00:02:24.360> sure<00:02:24.390> when

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
can damage the project so make sure when

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:26.480 
can damage the project so make sure when
you<00:02:24.780> go<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.959> store<00:02:25.290> them<00:02:25.410> they<00:02:25.980> are<00:02:26.160> not

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:26.490 
you go to store them they are not

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.190
