00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:59.840 

and<00:00:58.560> yeah<00:00:58.830> I<00:00:58.890> know<00:00:58.950> there's<00:00:59.280> some<00:00:59.400> diamonds

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
and yeah I know there's some diamonds

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.790 
and yeah I know there's some diamonds
here<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.300> think<00:01:00.750> they're<00:01:00.900> right<00:01:01.140> there<00:01:01.470> on<00:01:01.500> top

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
here I think they're right there on top

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.390 
here I think they're right there on top
of<00:01:01.950> that<00:01:02.040> that<00:01:02.970> rock<00:01:03.240> there<00:01:03.480> pretty<00:01:04.290> sure<00:01:04.500> and

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
of that that rock there pretty sure and

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.190 
of that that rock there pretty sure and
I<00:01:05.850> think<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.150> only<00:01:06.300> way<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.510> can<00:01:06.660> get<00:01:06.840> them<00:01:07.050> is

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
I think the only way you can get them is

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.490 
I think the only way you can get them is
to<00:01:07.440> take<00:01:07.680> a<00:01:08.010> hang<00:01:08.430> glider

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
to take a hang glider

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.900 
to take a hang glider
somewhere<00:01:10.500> off<00:01:10.680> in<00:01:10.860> the<00:01:11.220> mountains<00:01:11.730> there

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:11.910 
somewhere off in the mountains there

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:15.110 
somewhere off in the mountains there
find<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.660> hang<00:01:12.840> glider<00:01:13.110> and<00:01:13.200> fly<00:01:13.970> over<00:01:14.970> and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
find the hang glider and fly over and

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.870 
find the hang glider and fly over and
grab<00:01:15.390> them<00:01:15.600> pretty<00:01:16.200> sure<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.350> haven't<00:01:16.530> really
