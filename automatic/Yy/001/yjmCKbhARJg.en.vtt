monitor it has an IPS panel High

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.980 
monitor it has an IPS panel High
Definition<00:00:09.990> make<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> contrast<00:00:11.550> ratio<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:12.420> has

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
Definition make a contrast ratio and has

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.930 
Definition make a contrast ratio and has
the<00:00:13.170> energy-saving<00:00:13.740> mark<00:00:14.130> which<00:00:14.490> means<00:00:14.759> it's

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the energy-saving mark which means it's

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.560 
the energy-saving mark which means it's
efficient<00:00:15.420> and<00:00:16.039> HDMI<00:00:17.039> so<00:00:17.640> let's<00:00:18.119> take<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.359> look

first piece and the most important is

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:42.770 
first piece and the most important is
the<00:00:32.910> LED<00:00:33.660> monitor<00:00:38.930> so<00:00:40.760> basically<00:00:41.760> we<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.540> the

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
the LED monitor so basically we have the

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.930 
the LED monitor so basically we have the
monitor<00:00:43.520> made<00:00:44.520> by<00:00:44.670> LG<00:00:44.879> and<00:00:45.800> this<00:00:46.940> IPS

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
monitor made by LG and this IPS

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.229 
monitor made by LG and this IPS
technology<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.840> made<00:00:49.020> popular<00:00:49.350> by<00:00:50.239> the

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
technology was made popular by the

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.529 
technology was made popular by the

iPhone and the iPad they use the same

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.680 
iPhone and the iPad they use the same
components<00:00:55.550> pretty<00:00:56.550> much<00:00:56.730> that's<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.449> we<00:00:57.660> have

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
components pretty much that's it we have

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.170 
components pretty much that's it we have
the<00:00:57.930> base<00:00:58.109> here<00:00:58.410> black<00:00:59.070> pretty<00:00:59.760> much<00:00:59.910> just

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
the base here black pretty much just

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.740 
the base here black pretty much just
sits<00:01:00.449> in<00:01:00.739> the<00:01:01.739> d-sub<00:01:02.219> cable<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:03.300> DVI

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
sits in the d-sub cable and the DVI

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.520 
sits in the d-sub cable and the DVI
cable<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:05.339> course<00:01:05.400> your<00:01:05.700> power<00:01:05.909> cord<00:01:06.270> so

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
cable and of course your power cord so

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.109 
cable and of course your power cord so
that's<00:01:07.530> it<00:01:07.740> I'm<00:01:07.950> gonna<00:01:08.250> set<00:01:08.520> this<00:01:08.670> up<00:01:08.729> and

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
that's it I'm gonna set this up and

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:12.590 
that's it I'm gonna set this up and
we'll<00:01:09.570> take<00:01:09.720> another<00:01:09.869> look<00:01:10.310> okay<00:01:11.390> setup<00:01:12.390> was

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
we'll take another look okay setup was

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.100 
we'll take another look okay setup was
easy

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
easy

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.539 
easy
here<00:01:13.830> we<00:01:13.979> have<00:01:14.189> on<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.670> left<00:01:14.909> side<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.570> IPS<00:01:16.049> 6

00:01:16.539 --> 00:01:16.549 
here we have on the left side the IPS 6

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:22.640 
here we have on the left side the IPS 6
compared<00:01:17.549> to<00:01:17.850> my<00:01:18.180> older<00:01:18.630> TN<00:01:18.990> model<00:01:20.990> front<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
compared to my older TN model front the

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.160 
compared to my older TN model front the
front<00:01:22.830> of<00:01:23.100> it<00:01:23.220> has<00:01:23.520> a<00:01:23.549> smooth<00:01:23.909> surface<00:01:24.210> the<00:01:24.990> on

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
front of it has a smooth surface the on

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.219 
front of it has a smooth surface the on
and<00:01:25.409> off<00:01:25.500> switch<00:01:25.890> is<00:01:26.189> a<00:01:26.250> touchscreen<00:01:26.909> if<00:01:27.720> we

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
and off switch is a touchscreen if we

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.420 
and off switch is a touchscreen if we
look<00:01:28.439> at<00:01:28.530> the<00:01:28.710> sides<00:01:30.229> we<00:01:31.229> can<00:01:31.439> compare<00:01:32.040> the

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
look at the sides we can compare the

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.020 
look at the sides we can compare the
thickness<00:01:34.130> so<00:01:35.130> here<00:01:35.490> is<00:01:35.670> the<00:01:36.090> IPS<00:01:36.540> 6<00:01:38.030> compared

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
thickness so here is the IPS 6 compared

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.190 
thickness so here is the IPS 6 compared
to<00:01:39.420> my<00:01:39.840> older<00:01:40.409> TN<00:01:40.829> model<00:01:41.720> alright<00:01:42.720> let's<00:01:42.990> take

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
to my older TN model alright let's take

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.770 
to my older TN model alright let's take
a<00:01:43.259> look<00:01:43.500> at<00:01:43.619> the<00:01:43.710> picture<00:01:44.070> quality<00:01:44.250> now<00:01:46.610> so

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:47.780 
a look at the picture quality now so

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:50.719 
a look at the picture quality now so
basically<00:01:48.780> let's<00:01:49.380> look<00:01:49.619> at<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:49.860> colors<00:01:50.369> and

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
basically let's look at the colors and

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:54.469 
basically let's look at the colors and
see<00:01:51.689> how<00:01:51.840> they<00:01:51.990> both<00:01:52.170> look<00:01:52.470> together<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> one

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
see how they both look together the one

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:57.469 
see how they both look together the one
on<00:01:54.600> the<00:01:54.659> left<00:01:54.899> right<00:01:55.200> here<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:56.250> IPS<00:01:56.880> 6<00:01:57.210> and

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
on the left right here is the IPS 6 and

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.819 
on the left right here is the IPS 6 and
this<00:01:58.409> is<00:01:58.590> my<00:01:58.770> old<00:01:58.979> TN<00:01:59.310> model<00:02:00.049> what<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.079> did<00:02:01.469> was<00:02:01.710> I

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this is my old TN model what I did was I

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:05.090 
this is my old TN model what I did was I
took<00:02:01.860> a<00:02:02.100> photo<00:02:02.460> with<00:02:02.700> my<00:02:02.880> DSLR<00:02:03.299> camera<00:02:04.259> or<00:02:04.770> put

took a photo with my DSLR camera or put

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.270 
took a photo with my DSLR camera or put
the<00:02:05.399> photo<00:02:05.790> on<00:02:06.149> both<00:02:06.540> screens<00:02:07.069> you<00:02:08.069> can

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
the photo on both screens you can

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:10.070 
the photo on both screens you can
definitely<00:02:08.459> tell<00:02:09.000> the<00:02:09.209> one<00:02:09.360> on<00:02:09.450> the<00:02:09.539> left<00:02:09.780> is

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
definitely tell the one on the left is

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.589 
definitely tell the one on the left is
much<00:02:10.709> more<00:02:10.950> vivid

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:11.599 
much more vivid

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:14.319 
much more vivid
and<00:02:11.989> if<00:02:12.829> we<00:02:13.010> look<00:02:13.310> you<00:02:13.549> can<00:02:13.700> see<00:02:13.939> it's<00:02:14.060> much

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:14.329 
and if we look you can see it's much

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:17.349 
and if we look you can see it's much
more<00:02:14.659> closer<00:02:15.170> to<00:02:15.290> the<00:02:15.530> original<00:02:15.790> which<00:02:16.790> I<00:02:16.999> will

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.359 
more closer to the original which I will

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:21.039 
more closer to the original which I will
show<00:02:17.659> you<00:02:17.719> now<00:02:19.269> yeah<00:02:20.269> the<00:02:20.450> colors<00:02:20.749> are<00:02:20.959> much

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:21.049 
show you now yeah the colors are much

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:24.280 
show you now yeah the colors are much
more<00:02:21.349> closer<00:02:21.739> to<00:02:22.459> the<00:02:22.579> original<00:02:22.730> on<00:02:23.150> this<00:02:24.019> one

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:24.290 
more closer to the original on this one

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.649 
more closer to the original on this one
the<00:02:24.650> LG<00:02:25.099> model<00:02:25.420> okay

00:02:26.649 --> 00:02:26.659 
the LG model okay

00:02:26.659 --> 00:02:28.839 
the LG model okay
I<00:02:26.689> just<00:02:27.139> spent<00:02:27.530> some<00:02:27.739> time<00:02:28.069> playing<00:02:28.459> with<00:02:28.639> this

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
I just spent some time playing with this

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:31.300 
I just spent some time playing with this
but<00:02:29.239> take<00:02:30.019> a<00:02:30.079> look<00:02:30.319> at<00:02:30.439> these<00:02:30.590> different<00:02:30.769> views

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.310 
but take a look at these different views

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.099 
but take a look at these different views
so<00:02:32.139> one<00:02:33.139> of<00:02:33.170> the<00:02:33.409> best<00:02:33.680> things<00:02:34.010> about<00:02:34.159> the<00:02:34.400> IPS

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:35.109 
so one of the best things about the IPS

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:40.750 
so one of the best things about the IPS
panel<00:02:36.109> is<00:02:36.290> that<00:02:36.819> you<00:02:37.819> can<00:02:38.060> see<00:02:38.450> finer<00:02:39.760> quality

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:40.760 
panel is that you can see finer quality

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:43.659 
panel is that you can see finer quality
images<00:02:41.329> from<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:42.200> peripheral<00:02:42.650> vision<00:02:43.099> if

00:02:43.659 --> 00:02:43.669 
images from the peripheral vision if

00:02:43.669 --> 00:02:45.610
