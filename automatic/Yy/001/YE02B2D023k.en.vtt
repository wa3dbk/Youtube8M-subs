00:03:07.059 --> 00:03:07.069 
and then of course I can alternate

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:09.370 
and then of course I can alternate
between<00:03:07.100> the<00:03:07.880> two<00:03:08.090> currencies<00:03:08.450> with<00:03:09.200> that

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
button as well so let's load up our

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.630
