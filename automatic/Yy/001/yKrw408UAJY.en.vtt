00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:08.540
 ok you've finished putting all the 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.980
 veins in the face arms legs that already 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:13.910
 is 

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:15.850
 let's make the number 2 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:17.990
 the color 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:20.940
 skin 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.260
 you are going to take a little bit of the 2 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.260
 in the ashtray 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:34.560
 and with this color we are going to paint the nails 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.350
 I'll see 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.870
 and it is not our stadium to put thinner 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.870
 If necessary, we will put a droplet 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.800
 if it is not then 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:53.350
 so how can I have my hand 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.070
 stick in case we spent 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.070
 good 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.480
 look here this is the doll 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.460
 if you pass 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.870
 as surely it will be true because 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.870
 it is a very small area 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:23.479
 look at what cool imitates with the stick 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.290
 you define the nail well and you take it where you 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:27.450
 you have passed 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:30.730
 and on the little tip like I'm missing a 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.110
 little bit there is 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.370
 Y 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:40.180
 With the toothpick you take it off as I tell you 

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:45.430
 what have you been through 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:48.340
 these mini dolls that are still here 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:52.010
 they will be painting the same 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:55.390
 Making a 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.390
 micro hairline 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:03.260
 if you see that you spent in some resort 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.260
 to the stick 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.680
 this is the one I'm going to define better 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.840
 and this 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:22.290
 This is a 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.290
 and it's true we go with one hand 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:36.420
 so on the pure banks try to make 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.920
 thin stripes 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.020
 so that they look good because 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.470
 obviously the wider they look 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.860
 less 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:50.850
 - real are 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.430
 I took it off besides good let's put it 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.430
 again the hairline 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.440
 and you define it 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.440
 with the stick 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.260
 not like that 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:17.580
 another hairline and another cookie 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.230
 of ends 

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:31.050
 with the stick 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.050
 So there are your finitas 

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:40.590
 in bigger babies obviously it 

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:40.590
 they can mark the moons 

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.860
 here is not 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.110
 it would not be good if you did it because 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.290
 as the area is very small 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:54.310
 if you also paint there is a moon on the nail 

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:56.920
 already going to cover too much the color this 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:01.090
 white that we are putting and no longer knows 

00:03:56.920 --> 00:04:05.260
 see also that's why it's better that way, nothing more 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.159
 in the minis composing 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.159
 the dashes 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.590
 of the nail is more than enough 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:18.950
 you stick 

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.950
 remove 

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:22.319
 excellent 

00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:32.490
 of that remain 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:39.009
 as small as possible 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:42.449
 I have nails in there 

00:04:39.009 --> 00:04:42.449
 from the other foot I quote 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.960
 and nothing else we are missing 

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:54.040
 by the hand 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:56.530
 it may be that 

00:04:54.040 --> 00:05:00.460
 have you noticed that any of the colors 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:05:03.699
 what did you put or veins or whatever 

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:08.310
 it does not feel so much then it's time 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:11.450
 what retouches 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.450
 the colors 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:18.720
 you can put them back the one that has 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:22.680
 missing if you see some part very 

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:27.600
 blanquita or that the oatmeal served us 

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:30.650
 It does not look very good and so on. 

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.650
 any moment 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.770
 in retouching 

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.410
 and so 

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.510
 I touched my nail 

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.700
 and this term 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.710
 a little bit 

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.430
 you make it 

00:05:55.849 --> 00:06:02.310
 if you spent with him with him 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:06.040
 to lillo to return to touch up the 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:12.540
 you are already there, invite them 

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:12.540
 you already have the leaves of your muni
