00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's about it decide about the plane
passing<00:03:24.700> over<00:03:25.800> so<00:03:26.800> pedagogy<00:03:27.580> oil<00:03:27.850> change

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:28.230 
passing over so pedagogy oil change

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.230 
passing over so pedagogy oil change
later
