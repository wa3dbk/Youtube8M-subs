00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
about this painting is obviously the

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:50.559 
about this painting is obviously the
lighting<00:03:48.950> in<00:03:49.100> the<00:03:49.190> colors<00:03:49.520> you<00:03:50.300> know<00:03:50.390> that's

why I choose these kind of screen caps

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.110

from<00:03:53.590> cinematic<00:03:54.590> movies<00:03:54.980> as<00:03:55.550> they're<00:03:55.880> always

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.120 
from cinematic movies as they're always

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.320 
from cinematic movies as they're always
shot<00:03:56.360> really<00:03:56.510> well<00:03:56.920> well<00:03:57.920> yeah<00:03:58.910> I<00:03:58.970> like<00:03:59.209> the

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:02.150 
expression and kind of out focus

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.920 
expression and kind of out focus
background<00:04:02.950> well<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:04.400> think<00:04:04.970> he's<00:04:05.360> making<00:04:05.750> a

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
background well I think he's making a

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.840 
background well I think he's making a
funny<00:04:06.200> expression<00:04:06.560> with<00:04:06.920> his<00:04:07.070> mouth<00:04:07.340> it's

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:07.850 
funny expression with his mouth it's

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:12.060 
funny expression with his mouth it's
kind<00:04:08.120> of<00:04:08.150> like<00:04:09.100> it's<00:04:10.100> like<00:04:10.160> barely<00:04:10.459> open<00:04:10.970> and<00:04:11.300> I
