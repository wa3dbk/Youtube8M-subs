00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:08.519
 Hello dear friends today to you 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:13.400
 talk about the appearance of samsung galaxy 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:16.080
 laptop and so the appearance is made of 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.010
 Plastic at least the back cover 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.430
 this 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:24.480
 glossy side covered i here 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.820
 so here is semi silver paint protection 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.800
 the screen is probably plastic too either 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.210
 glass at least online gorilla 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:33.989
 the voice says nothing 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:36.230
 about this device there is samsung 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:41.730
 galaxy s galaxy s2 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:44.579
 there is ted 10 1 and 1 t here's why the screen 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.460
 most likely some kind of glass either 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.110
 plastic anyway it's covered somehow 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.899
 material that is not subject 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.379
 abrasion and scratching 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:57.360
 at the top is a speaker sensor 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:00.530
 lighting proximity sensor front 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.270
 2 megapixel camera without autofocus 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:06.750
 understandably below the mechanical key 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.540
 exactly the same on galaxy s2 installed 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:12.030
 on the left, on the right, the sensory 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.280
 white backlit keys not 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:19.320
 very bright this back and call 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:22.320
 shortcut menu bottom microusb connector 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.869
 here is the microphone and everywhere 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.030
 he supports for the goal that is possible 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:30.119
 connect flash drives through a special 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.880
 adapter here is the stylus with the left 

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:33.840
 side volume adjustment is small 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.140
 such a rocker 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.970
 on the right side of the on and off 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:43.170
 also lock the device on top 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:45.420
 standard three and a half millimeters 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:49.860
 audio output here here is the second microphone 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:52.229
 is for writing style that is when 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.180
 shooting video, he records a stereo sound 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.939
 also for noise cancellation 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:59.100
 this camera is behind the problem 

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.030
 metal it to someone the base and 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.799
 not a big flash is here 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:05.880
 speaker 

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:09.119
 back surface like this 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:10.890
 grooved now we will try to open 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.050
 body 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.560
 on elements I can show everything approximately 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.010
 and size comparison well firstly it 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.510
 galaxy s 1 unfortunately 2 i don't have 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.690
 so it looks like 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:29.220
 have a healthy phone from sony 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.490
 ericsson is the son of the flame 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.340
 big 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:40.440
 thickness of course x is equally useless 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:45.660
 play big fat here and there too 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:49.110
 very small phone this is nokia e7 here 

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:51.959
 so they look on their own galaxy laptop 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:54.590
 big more than any smartphone but 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:57.989
 for example less than a day 

00:02:54.590 --> 00:03:00.540
 tablet though Samsung is now very 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:04.050
 many different tablets including 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:09.440
 there are 7 and 7 and 7 inches diagonal so 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.980
 the user has plenty to choose from 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:12.989
 back cover 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.120
 open the back cover here there are such 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:20.250
 small holes that's why 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:22.610
 We lid for them very cap 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.209
 thin well, quite so 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:27.590
 unpretentious 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:31.670
 plastic here she bends see how 

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:36.299
 thin-thin that down there 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.459
 so this is a micro sd card and a sim card 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.940
 actually not entirely clear possible 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.150
 there was sd and hot swap inside though 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:47.970
 phone today has 16 gigabytes 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:53.750
 internal memory will be sold 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:57.540
 device with 30 two gigabytes from a flash drive 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:59.970
 close in principle the body does not play but 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:02.010
 there is such a small cruz is unclear with 

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:08.190
 what is the reason may not be so 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:10.650
 got the device here we close everywhere 

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:14.170
 from all sides 

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:16.810
 seemingly nothing at first glance 

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:19.060
 but when operating it is still sometimes 

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.540
 can be heard as he crunches 

00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:24.520
 somewhere as if the lid is not completely 

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:27.880
 closed on here you see here slightly not 

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:31.290
 closed a little bends in another 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.960
 hand in general, then everything is within normal limits 

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:36.130
 as for the use itself but 

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.860
 fingerprints for literally 

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:41.290
 take a few seconds to take away 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:44.639
 there is no special coverage here 

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.210
 100 waiting for fingerprints did not appear 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:56.680
 they are erased relatively easily there 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:05:00.580
 we wash the microfiber cloth in 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:03.639
 The principle of the fields is not a blank screen, which became 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:07.260
 concerns ergonomics control and the 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:09.910
 similar big yes but in general 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:12.100
 does not cause discomfort that is 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:14.380
 at least it's better than driving 

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:16.360
 for example in the subway with a tablet when it 

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:18.669
 heavy enough and p2 

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.030
 here is a site that is somewhat uncomfortable to ride 

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:24.460
 in the subway because people have a lot of crush 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.530
 forever have to keep near yourself so 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.910
 here I pulled 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.639
 ipad and in this way and 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:32.710
 move there sometimes cool on 

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:37.990
 a button to update twitter for example 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:39.789
 or see what they write in safari with 

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.800
 this apparatus problems not that is possible 

00:05:39.789 --> 00:05:44.320
 take in a pinch 

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.289
 put it in your pocket close cover this 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:48.220
 completely covered by the palm 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:51.419
 there is in this plan 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:54.220
 ergonomics ok as for 

00:05:51.419 --> 00:05:57.990
 use as a phone but more 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:06:01.330
 see nothing terrible 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.990
 no problem putting ear to 

00:06:01.330 --> 00:06:04.410
 dynamics 

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:07.240
 since here all the same speaker is 

00:06:04.410 --> 00:06:09.610
 the only speaker is a little bit 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:13.240
 weird seemingly loud but 

00:06:09.610 --> 00:06:16.240
 interlocutor heard as if from afar the 

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:18.320
 there seems to be an idea should be very 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:20.420
 loud could arrange here 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.150
 any speaker is actually it 

00:06:20.420 --> 00:06:25.010
 concerns the main dynamics i.e. 

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:28.100
 it was possible and make it louder almost 

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:30.160
 not all this back part 1 ok 

00:06:28.100 --> 00:06:33.080
 put nevertheless don't know why but 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.330
 the manufacturer decided to save a little 

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:37.580
 the result is a good speaker 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:41.510
 but the interlocutor can be heard from afar 

00:06:37.580 --> 00:06:44.270
 in appearance, I guess you all 

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:48.220
 told sure to see the following 

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:48.220
 video thanks, bye bye
