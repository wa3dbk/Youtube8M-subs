00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:09.360 
everybody few quick tips about some

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.980 
everybody few quick tips about some
ceiling<00:00:09.690> tile<00:00:09.900> installation<00:00:11.480> what<00:00:12.480> I<00:00:12.509> did<00:00:12.750> was

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:12.990 
ceiling tile installation what I did was

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.340 
ceiling tile installation what I did was
I<00:00:13.019> started<00:00:13.440> with<00:00:14.040> the<00:00:14.280> center<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> the<00:00:15.450> room<00:00:15.690> as

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
I started with the center of the room as

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.410 
I started with the center of the room as
opposed<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:17.010> starting<00:00:17.340> with<00:00:17.580> the<00:00:17.730> corner<00:00:18.240> I

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
opposed to starting with the corner I

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.599 
opposed to starting with the corner I
think<00:00:19.020> it<00:00:19.170> looks<00:00:19.380> a<00:00:19.470> lot<00:00:19.590> nicer<00:00:19.800> with<00:00:20.310> the

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:20.609 
think it looks a lot nicer with the

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.750 
think it looks a lot nicer with the
light<00:00:21.060> fixture<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.949> exactly<00:00:22.949> in<00:00:23.070> the<00:00:23.279> center

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
light fixture and exactly in the center

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.130 
light fixture and exactly in the center
of<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.480> 2x2<00:00:25.019> tin<00:00:25.710> tile<00:00:26.539> from<00:00:27.539> there<00:00:27.840> just

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:28.140 
of the 2x2 tin tile from there just

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.170 
of the 2x2 tin tile from there just
worked<00:00:28.949> my<00:00:29.039> way<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.550> at<00:00:29.880> 1<00:00:30.810> foot<00:00:31.019> intervals

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.180 
worked my way out at 1 foot intervals

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.360 
worked my way out at 1 foot intervals
building<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.300> framework<00:00:34.040> I'm<00:00:35.040> trying<00:00:35.250> to

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
building the framework I'm trying to

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.930 
building the framework I'm trying to
show<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.520> over<00:00:35.760> here<00:00:37.430> you're<00:00:38.430> not<00:00:38.610> quite

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
show you over here you're not quite

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.790 
show you over here you're not quite
complete<00:00:39.390> yet<00:00:39.420> on<00:00:39.780> this<00:00:39.989> side<00:00:41.899> so<00:00:42.899> just<00:00:43.559> making

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
complete yet on this side so just making

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.139 
complete yet on this side so just making
the<00:00:44.100> fixture<00:00:44.730> the<00:00:44.969> center<00:00:45.480> point<00:00:45.809> and<00:00:46.079> then

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
the fixture the center point and then

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.020 
the fixture the center point and then
putting<00:00:48.149> up<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.510> 1<00:00:49.050> by<00:00:49.200> 2<00:00:49.309> every<00:00:50.309> one<00:00:50.550> foot<00:00:50.820> on

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
putting up a 1 by 2 every one foot on

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.200 
putting up a 1 by 2 every one foot on
center<00:00:51.920> really<00:00:52.920> comes<00:00:53.219> out<00:00:53.399> nice<00:00:53.670> with<00:00:54.000> the

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
center really comes out nice with the

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.860 
center really comes out nice with the
light<00:00:55.140> fixture<00:00:55.500> centered<00:00:56.420> the<00:00:57.420> other<00:00:57.539> thing<00:00:57.780> I

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
light fixture centered the other thing I

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.430 
light fixture centered the other thing I
wanted<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.230> talk<00:00:58.559> about<00:00:58.590> is<00:00:59.930> something<00:01:00.930> that<00:01:01.230> I

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440 
wanted to talk about is something that I

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.319 
wanted to talk about is something that I
think<00:01:01.649> doesn't<00:01:02.250> get<00:01:02.340> enough<00:01:02.579> attention<00:01:02.699> and

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
think doesn't get enough attention and

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.140 
think doesn't get enough attention and
that<00:01:03.510> is<00:01:03.539> the<00:01:04.019> direction<00:01:05.010> of<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.369> overlap<00:01:05.880> of

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
that is the direction of the overlap of

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:08.690 
that is the direction of the overlap of
these<00:01:06.330> tiles<00:01:06.799> makes<00:01:07.799> a<00:01:07.920> big<00:01:08.100> difference<00:01:08.549> on

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
these tiles makes a big difference on

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.789 
these tiles makes a big difference on
how<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.119> looks<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.600> when<00:01:10.229> I'm<00:01:10.320> trying<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:10.619> show

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
how it looks and when I'm trying to show

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.280 
how it looks and when I'm trying to show
you<00:01:10.830> right<00:01:11.100> now<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.900> that<00:01:12.900> you<00:01:12.990> can<00:01:13.140> actually

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
you right now is that you can actually

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:17.060 
you right now is that you can actually
see<00:01:13.710> into<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.610> seams<00:01:15.530> but<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.830> not<00:01:17.040> the

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
see into the seams but this is not the

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.580 
see into the seams but this is not the
direction<00:01:17.549> then<00:01:18.210> most<00:01:18.780> people<00:01:19.080> will<00:01:19.200> see<00:01:19.409> this

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
direction then most people will see this

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.410 
direction then most people will see this
hallway<00:01:19.830> it'll<00:01:20.520> be<00:01:20.610> the<00:01:20.759> other<00:01:20.790> way<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.299> we

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
hallway it'll be the other way if we

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.149 
hallway it'll be the other way if we
look<00:01:21.600> down<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.810> hallway<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.560> opposite

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
look down the hallway in the opposite

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:23.870 
look down the hallway in the opposite
direction

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
direction

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.730 
direction
you'll<00:01:24.390> see<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.720> I've<00:01:24.900> overlapped<00:01:25.500> the

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
you'll see that I've overlapped the

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.550 
you'll see that I've overlapped the
tiles<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.549> that<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.810> really<00:01:27.990> don't<00:01:28.200> see<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
tiles so that you really don't see the

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.890 
tiles so that you really don't see the
seams<00:01:28.860> from<00:01:29.159> this<00:01:29.400> direction<00:01:29.600> so<00:01:30.600> really

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
seams from this direction so really

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.350 
seams from this direction so really
watch<00:01:31.110> um<00:01:31.560> which<00:01:32.250> way<00:01:32.430> you<00:01:32.490> overlap<00:01:33.180> your

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
watch um which way you overlap your

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.960 
watch um which way you overlap your
tiles<00:01:33.869> I<00:01:34.140> mean<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.950> looks<00:01:35.130> really<00:01:35.490> nice<00:01:35.640> from

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
tiles I mean it looks really nice from

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.490 
tiles I mean it looks really nice from
this<00:01:36.119> direction<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.720> this<00:01:36.810> is<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:37.020> most

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
this direction and this is the most

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:41.240 
this direction and this is the most
commonly<00:01:37.920> used<00:01:38.040> direction<00:01:39.000> I<00:01:40.040> noticed<00:01:41.040> when<00:01:41.189> I

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
commonly used direction I noticed when I

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.580 
commonly used direction I noticed when I
was<00:01:41.430> looking<00:01:41.700> at<00:01:42.600> this<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.079> I<00:01:43.140> have<00:01:43.380> one<00:01:43.680> here

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:45.590 
was looking at this that I have one here

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.880 
was looking at this that I have one here
that<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.649> did<00:01:46.950> wrong<00:01:47.420> fortunately<00:01:48.420> I'm<00:01:48.780> not<00:01:49.259> far

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
that I did wrong fortunately I'm not far

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.649 
that I did wrong fortunately I'm not far
enough<00:01:49.979> along<00:01:50.340> yet<00:01:50.610> that's<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:51.060> problem<00:01:51.479> I'll

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
enough along yet that's a problem I'll

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:54.679 
enough along yet that's a problem I'll
just<00:01:51.689> back<00:01:52.140> the<00:01:52.439> screws<00:01:53.070> out<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.610> then<00:01:54.299> change

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
just back the screws out and then change

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.929 
just back the screws out and then change
the<00:01:55.079> direction<00:01:55.110> of<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.740> overlap<00:01:56.280> so<00:01:56.640> that<00:01:56.790> it

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
the direction of the overlap so that it

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:00.679 
the direction of the overlap so that it
looks<00:01:57.899> the<00:01:58.140> same<00:01:58.380> as<00:01:59.270> the<00:02:00.270> rest<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.600> the

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
looks the same as the rest of the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.179 
looks the same as the rest of the
ceiling<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.350> really<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.770> you<00:02:02.040> won't

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
ceiling and you really want you won't

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.859 
ceiling and you really want you won't
see<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.460> seams<00:02:02.700> at<00:02:02.850> all<00:02:03.000> from<00:02:03.299> this<00:02:03.450> direct

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:07.899 

once<00:02:06.289> I<00:02:06.409> get<00:02:06.560> done<00:02:06.770> with<00:02:06.799> the<00:02:07.130> tiles<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.759> and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
once I get done with the tiles here and

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.140 
once I get done with the tiles here and
a<00:02:07.969> little<00:02:08.209> bit<00:02:08.330> I'll<00:02:08.810> come<00:02:09.500> back<00:02:09.649> with<00:02:10.150> some

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
a little bit I'll come back with some

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.869 
a little bit I'll come back with some
molding<00:02:11.569> at<00:02:11.720> the<00:02:11.840> top<00:02:12.080> and<00:02:12.640> it'll<00:02:13.640> all<00:02:13.849> be

00:02:13.869 --> 00:02:13.879 
molding at the top and it'll all be

00:02:13.879 --> 00:02:16.839 
molding at the top and it'll all be
really<00:02:14.450> really<00:02:14.900> nice<00:02:15.019> I<00:02:15.290> think<00:02:15.590> probably<00:02:16.250> also

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
really really nice I think probably also

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:21.750 
really really nice I think probably also
going<00:02:17.060> to<00:02:17.349> get<00:02:18.349> a<00:02:18.410> bit<00:02:18.650> of<00:02:19.390> white<00:02:20.500> paint

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
going to get a bit of white paint

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.580 
going to get a bit of white paint
probably<00:02:22.760> an<00:02:22.879> epoxy<00:02:23.209> and<00:02:23.720> we'll<00:02:24.049> go<00:02:24.230> over<00:02:24.349> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
probably an epoxy and we'll go over the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.710 
probably an epoxy and we'll go over the
screw<00:02:24.890> heads<00:02:25.190> I<00:02:25.610> don't<00:02:26.299> know<00:02:26.390> if<00:02:26.510> you<00:02:26.599> can

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720 
screw heads I don't know if you can

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.059 
screw heads I don't know if you can
really<00:02:26.959> see<00:02:27.200> them<00:02:28.480> but<00:02:29.799> since<00:02:30.799> they're

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:31.069 
really see them but since they're

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:33.850 
really see them but since they're
unfinished<00:02:31.910> and<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.299> the<00:02:32.780> tin<00:02:33.049> was<00:02:33.410> painted

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
unfinished and the the tin was painted

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.680 
unfinished and the the tin was painted
white<00:02:34.040> they<00:02:34.370> kind<00:02:34.640> of<00:02:34.700> stick<00:02:35.000> out<00:02:35.180> like<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.420> sore

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:35.690 
white they kind of stick out like a sore

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.970 
white they kind of stick out like a sore
thumb<00:02:35.720> so<00:02:36.200> I'm<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.500> go<00:02:36.650> over<00:02:36.680> them<00:02:36.950> with

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
thumb so I'm going to go over them with

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.640 
thumb so I'm going to go over them with
just<00:02:37.340> a<00:02:37.400> little<00:02:37.640> dab<00:02:37.819> of<00:02:37.849> white<00:02:38.780> paint<00:02:39.110> just<00:02:39.530> to

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
just a little dab of white paint just to

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.740 
just a little dab of white paint just to
hide<00:02:39.860> all<00:02:40.069> that<00:02:40.099> and<00:02:40.670> we<00:02:41.420> should<00:02:41.599> have<00:02:41.720> a

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
hide all that and we should have a

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.030 
hide all that and we should have a
really<00:02:42.110> nice<00:02:42.940> product<00:02:43.940> at<00:02:44.120> the<00:02:44.239> end<00:02:45.040> another

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
really nice product at the end another

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.199 
really nice product at the end another
quick<00:02:46.370> tip<00:02:47.349> when<00:02:48.349> measuring<00:02:48.769> the<00:02:48.950> size<00:02:49.910> of<00:02:50.120> the

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
quick tip when measuring the size of the

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:53.830 
quick tip when measuring the size of the
tiles<00:02:50.690> that<00:02:50.930> you're<00:02:51.079> going<00:02:51.319> to<00:02:51.440> cut<00:02:52.629> you<00:02:53.629> see

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
tiles that you're going to cut you see

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.650 
tiles that you're going to cut you see
that<00:02:54.110> there<00:02:54.319> is<00:02:54.349> a<00:02:54.709> channel<00:02:55.700> on<00:02:56.120> the<00:02:56.239> edge<00:02:56.420> of

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
that there is a channel on the edge of

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:00.970 
that there is a channel on the edge of
these<00:02:56.840> tin<00:02:57.170> tiles<00:02:58.840> what<00:02:59.840> I<00:02:59.870> do<00:03:00.019> is<00:03:00.379> I<00:03:00.590> measure

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
these tin tiles what I do is I measure

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.559 
these tin tiles what I do is I measure
from<00:03:01.129> the<00:03:01.489> center<00:03:01.730> of<00:03:02.299> that<00:03:03.200> channel<00:03:04.420> to<00:03:05.420> the

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
from the center of that channel to the

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.860 
from the center of that channel to the
edge<00:03:05.989> of<00:03:06.349> the<00:03:06.440> wall<00:03:07.060> that<00:03:08.060> automatically

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
edge of the wall that automatically

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.140 
edge of the wall that automatically
takes<00:03:09.260> into<00:03:09.560> consideration<00:03:09.590> the<00:03:10.400> overlap

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
takes into consideration the overlap

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.420 
takes into consideration the overlap
because<00:03:11.600> when<00:03:11.810> you<00:03:11.900> bring<00:03:12.079> in<00:03:12.260> your<00:03:12.470> new<00:03:12.650> tin

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
because when you bring in your new tin

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.750 
because when you bring in your new tin
tile<00:03:13.730> it<00:03:14.090> will<00:03:14.329> sit<00:03:14.600> behind<00:03:15.190> the<00:03:16.190> tiles<00:03:16.579> that

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
tile it will sit behind the tiles that

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.479 
tile it will sit behind the tiles that
you've<00:03:16.940> already<00:03:17.150> installed<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:18.680> just<00:03:19.280> find

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
you've already installed I just find

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.979 
you've already installed I just find
it's<00:03:19.670> a<00:03:19.730> lot<00:03:19.849> easier<00:03:20.180> to<00:03:20.329> do<00:03:20.480> that<00:03:20.510> than<00:03:21.130> to

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:22.989 
it's a lot easier to do that than to

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:26.289 
it's a lot easier to do that than to
deduct<00:03:23.989> say<00:03:24.290> a<00:03:24.319> quarter<00:03:24.709> inch<00:03:24.920> off<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:26.180> the

00:03:26.289 --> 00:03:26.299 
deduct say a quarter inch off of the

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:28.390 
deduct say a quarter inch off of the
measurement<00:03:26.780> the<00:03:26.900> actual<00:03:27.230> measurement<00:03:27.739> so

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
measurement the actual measurement so

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.270 
measurement the actual measurement so
just<00:03:29.060> measure<00:03:29.269> from<00:03:29.569> the<00:03:29.690> center<00:03:29.930> of<00:03:30.280> the

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:31.280 
just measure from the center of the

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.089 
just measure from the center of the
overlap<00:03:31.849> at<00:03:32.690> the<00:03:32.780> center<00:03:33.049> of<00:03:33.169> that<00:03:33.290> channel

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:34.099 
overlap at the center of that channel

00:03:34.099 --> 00:03:36.970 
overlap at the center of that channel
there<00:03:34.310> to<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:35.120> edge<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.419> the<00:03:35.540> wall<00:03:35.720> and<00:03:36.019> you

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980 
there to the edge of the wall and you

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.030 
there to the edge of the wall and you
have<00:03:37.220> the<00:03:37.489> exact<00:03:37.819> size<00:03:38.620> when<00:03:39.620> you<00:03:39.739> mark<00:03:39.980> your

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
have the exact size when you mark your

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:42.490 
have the exact size when you mark your
new<00:03:40.400> tile<00:03:40.730> just<00:03:41.599> measure<00:03:41.840> from<00:03:42.079> the<00:03:42.200> center<00:03:42.380> of

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:42.500 
new tile just measure from the center of

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:44.229 
new tile just measure from the center of
the<00:03:42.650> tile<00:03:42.889> over<00:03:43.190> to<00:03:43.310> where<00:03:43.459> your<00:03:43.639> cut<00:03:43.849> needs<00:03:44.060> to

00:03:44.229 --> 00:03:44.239 
the tile over to where your cut needs to

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.979 
the tile over to where your cut needs to
be<00:03:44.389> and<00:03:44.919> boom<00:03:45.970> you've<00:03:46.970> got<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.389> tile<00:03:47.720> that's

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:47.989 
be and boom you've got a tile that's

00:03:47.989 --> 00:03:50.259 
be and boom you've got a tile that's
going<00:03:48.169> to<00:03:48.260> be<00:03:48.319> the<00:03:48.470> exact<00:03:48.799> right<00:03:49.040> size<00:03:49.269> okay

00:03:50.259 --> 00:03:50.269 
going to be the exact right size okay

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.159 
going to be the exact right size okay
now<00:03:50.840> we're<00:03:51.019> getting<00:03:51.109> ready<00:03:51.380> to<00:03:52.060> cut<00:03:53.060> the<00:03:53.169> piece

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:54.169 
now we're getting ready to cut the piece

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.740 
now we're getting ready to cut the piece
of<00:03:54.319> tile<00:03:54.530> for<00:03:54.859> the<00:03:55.010> ceiling<00:03:55.579> what<00:03:56.180> I<00:03:56.209> did<00:03:56.450> was<00:03:56.630> I

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:56.750 
of tile for the ceiling what I did was I

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.470 
of tile for the ceiling what I did was I
went<00:03:56.930> ahead<00:03:57.049> and<00:03:57.319> made<00:03:57.500> a<00:03:57.799> little<00:03:58.190> map<00:03:58.760> with

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.480 
went ahead and made a little map with

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.240 
went ahead and made a little map with
the<00:03:59.599> measurements<00:04:00.079> on<00:04:00.200> it<00:04:00.230> for<00:04:00.590> each<00:04:00.709> piece<00:04:01.010> so

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
the measurements on it for each piece so

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:04.479 
the measurements on it for each piece so
I<00:04:01.310> can<00:04:01.489> get<00:04:01.639> the<00:04:02.450> corner<00:04:03.139> pieces<00:04:03.380> exactly<00:04:04.130> the

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:04.489 
I can get the corner pieces exactly the

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:06.970 
I can get the corner pieces exactly the
right<00:04:04.639> size<00:04:04.940> that<00:04:05.329> I<00:04:05.419> need<00:04:05.530> but<00:04:06.530> what<00:04:06.769> you<00:04:06.889> have

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:06.980 
right size that I need but what you have

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.069 
right size that I need but what you have
to<00:04:07.069> keep<00:04:07.160> in<00:04:07.340> mind<00:04:07.549> is<00:04:07.790> since<00:04:08.030> the<00:04:08.269> ceiling<00:04:08.930> is

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:09.079 
to keep in mind is since the ceiling is

00:04:09.079 --> 00:04:12.550 
to keep in mind is since the ceiling is
overhead<00:04:10.359> what<00:04:11.359> we'll<00:04:11.540> do<00:04:11.720> is<00:04:11.930> we'll<00:04:12.200> cut

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:12.560 
overhead what we'll do is we'll cut

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:15.000 
overhead what we'll do is we'll cut
actually<00:04:13.219> the<00:04:13.610> opposite

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:15.010 
actually the opposite

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:17.099 
actually the opposite
corners<00:04:15.670> so<00:04:15.910> that<00:04:16.060> they<00:04:16.180> come<00:04:16.420> out<00:04:16.450> correctly

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
corners so that they come out correctly

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:20.069 
corners so that they come out correctly
what<00:04:17.290> that<00:04:17.440> means<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.980> is<00:04:18.280> that<00:04:18.690> when<00:04:19.690> this<00:04:19.870> is

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
what that means is is that when this is

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.940 
what that means is is that when this is
the<00:04:20.820> right-hand<00:04:22.050> corner<00:04:23.050> of<00:04:23.290> the<00:04:23.410> ceiling<00:04:23.650> I'm

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
the right-hand corner of the ceiling I'm

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.460 
the right-hand corner of the ceiling I'm
going<00:04:24.160> to<00:04:24.220> cut<00:04:24.490> it<00:04:24.640> out<00:04:24.850> of<00:04:24.910> the<00:04:25.420> left<00:04:26.170> hand

on the edge to the line where I want to
cut<00:05:04.540> right<00:05:05.140> here<00:05:06.300> just<00:05:07.300> use<00:05:07.480> a<00:05:07.510> good<00:05:07.750> pair<00:05:08.020> of

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
cut right here just use a good pair of

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:09.870 
cut right here just use a good pair of
tin<00:05:08.380> snips<00:05:08.410> you<00:05:08.980> don't<00:05:09.160> really<00:05:09.340> need<00:05:09.580> more

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
tin snips you don't really need more

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.900 
tin snips you don't really need more
than<00:05:10.090> that<00:05:10.240> it's<00:05:10.480> pretty<00:05:10.870> easy<00:05:11.080> to<00:05:11.380> cut<00:05:11.910> so
