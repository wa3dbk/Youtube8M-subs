what's up YouTube how you doing Adam

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.450 
what's up YouTube how you doing Adam
here<00:00:13.200> and<00:00:13.410> in<00:00:13.590> this<00:00:13.679> video<00:00:13.860> I'm<00:00:14.190> going<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.340> be

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:14.460 
here and in this video I'm going to be

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.880 
here and in this video I'm going to be
talking<00:00:14.580> to<00:00:14.849> you<00:00:14.969> about<00:00:15.269> ISO<00:00:15.990> on<00:00:16.320> a<00:00:16.379> DSLR

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
talking to you about ISO on a DSLR

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.040 
talking to you about ISO on a DSLR
camera<00:00:17.580> or<00:00:17.789> in<00:00:18.090> fact<00:00:18.240> any<00:00:18.539> camera<00:00:18.900> that<00:00:19.020> allows

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
camera or in fact any camera that allows

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.490 
camera or in fact any camera that allows
you<00:00:19.439> to<00:00:19.560> change<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.550> ISO<00:00:21.210> sensitivity<00:00:21.480> in<00:00:22.320> the

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
you to change the ISO sensitivity in the

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.310 
you to change the ISO sensitivity in the
settings<00:00:23.000> now<00:00:24.000> in<00:00:24.150> fact<00:00:24.359> most<00:00:24.630> compact

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
settings now in fact most compact

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:26.870 
settings now in fact most compact
cameras<00:00:25.740> actually<00:00:26.039> enable<00:00:26.369> you<00:00:26.490> to<00:00:26.519> do<00:00:26.730> this

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
cameras actually enable you to do this

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.330 
cameras actually enable you to do this
now<00:00:27.150> manually<00:00:27.930> if<00:00:28.050> you<00:00:28.199> want<00:00:28.410> to<00:00:28.560> definitely

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
now manually if you want to definitely

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.759 
now manually if you want to definitely
all<00:00:29.910> DSLR<00:00:30.570> cameras<00:00:30.929> allow<00:00:31.140> you<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.410> do<00:00:31.529> it<00:00:31.650> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
all DSLR cameras allow you to do it and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.310 
all DSLR cameras allow you to do it and
sometimes<00:00:32.399> in<00:00:32.579> fact<00:00:32.730> even<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.320> smartphone

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
sometimes in fact even some smartphone

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.900 
sometimes in fact even some smartphone
cameras<00:00:34.680> allow<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:34.950> to<00:00:35.130> change<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.430> ISO

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910 
cameras allow you to change the ISO

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.700 
cameras allow you to change the ISO
sensitivity<00:00:37.129> then<00:00:38.129> what<00:00:38.370> is<00:00:38.579> ISO<00:00:39.270> sensitivity

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:39.710 
sensitivity then what is ISO sensitivity

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:44.389 
sensitivity then what is ISO sensitivity
or<00:00:40.710> ISO<00:00:41.309> is<00:00:41.640> the<00:00:42.329> sensitiveness<00:00:43.260> of<00:00:43.739> the

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
or ISO is the sensitiveness of the

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:48.049 
or ISO is the sensitiveness of the
sensor<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.149> your<00:00:45.390> camera<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:46.140> light<00:00:46.550> so<00:00:47.550> the

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
sensor in your camera to light so the

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.600 
sensor in your camera to light so the
lower<00:00:48.300> the<00:00:48.840> ISO<00:00:49.530> that<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> have<00:00:50.010> set<00:00:50.309> in<00:00:50.460> your

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:50.610 
lower the ISO that you have set in your

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:53.360 
lower the ISO that you have set in your
camera<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:51.840> less<00:00:52.079> sensitive<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.829> is<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:52.980> light

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
camera the less sensitive it is to light

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.959 
camera the less sensitive it is to light
therefore<00:00:54.300> requiring<00:00:55.079> more<00:00:55.620> light<00:00:55.969> the

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
therefore requiring more light the

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.990 
therefore requiring more light the
higher<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.570> ISO<00:00:58.050> setting<00:00:58.260> in<00:00:58.559> your<00:00:58.680> camera

00:00:58.990 --> 00:00:59.000 
higher the ISO setting in your camera

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.270 
higher the ISO setting in your camera
the<00:01:00.000> more<00:01:00.270> sensitive<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:00.989> light<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.469> therefore

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
the more sensitive to light is therefore

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.939 
the more sensitive to light is therefore
requiring<00:01:02.879> less<00:01:03.329> light<00:01:03.629> now<00:01:04.619> how<00:01:04.769> do<00:01:04.830> we

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
requiring less light now how do we

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.950 
requiring less light now how do we
measure<00:01:05.100> our<00:01:05.339> so<00:01:05.670> when<00:01:06.119> it's<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.390> a<00:01:06.420> range<00:01:06.780> of

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
measure our so when it's in a range of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.560 
measure our so when it's in a range of
numbers<00:01:07.140> now<00:01:08.010> most<00:01:08.310> DSLR<00:01:08.939> cameras<00:01:09.330> in<00:01:09.450> the

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
numbers now most DSLR cameras in the

kind<00:01:09.780> of<00:01:09.869> beginners<00:01:10.350> and<00:01:10.500> mid<00:01:10.650> range<00:01:10.680> will<00:01:11.159> go

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
kind of beginners and mid range will go

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.910 
kind of beginners and mid range will go

you<00:01:22.500> may<00:01:22.710> find<00:01:22.979> in<00:01:23.189> something<00:01:23.460> like<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:23.820> 3100

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
you may find in something like the 3100

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.560 
you may find in something like the 3100
or<00:01:24.810> an<00:01:24.900> 1100<00:01:25.500> d<00:01:25.710> that<00:01:26.189> it<00:01:26.310> goes<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.850> the<00:01:27.180> region

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
or an 1100 d that it goes in the region

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.830 
or an 1100 d that it goes in the region
of<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.930> hundred<00:01:28.140> to<00:01:28.579> 3200<00:01:29.579> but<00:01:30.180> that's<00:01:30.420> kind<00:01:30.750> of

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
of a hundred to 3200 but that's kind of

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.469 
of a hundred to 3200 but that's kind of
irrelevant<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.799> point<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> that<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.970> lower

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
irrelevant the point is that the lower

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.920 
irrelevant the point is that the lower
the<00:01:33.810> iso<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.189> less<00:01:35.430> sensitive<00:01:35.909> the<00:01:36.390> sensor<00:01:36.420> is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
the iso the less sensitive the sensor is

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140 
the iso the less sensitive the sensor is
to<00:01:37.079> light<00:01:37.229> therefore<00:01:38.040> requiring<00:01:38.549> more<00:01:38.939> light

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
to light therefore requiring more light

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.480 
to light therefore requiring more light
to<00:01:39.390> correctly<00:01:39.780> expose<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.350> picture<00:01:40.740> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
to correctly expose the picture the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.450 
to correctly expose the picture the
higher<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:42.479> iso<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.500> more<00:01:43.770> sensitive<00:01:44.250> it<00:01:44.340> is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
higher the iso the more sensitive it is

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.789 
higher the iso the more sensitive it is
to<00:01:44.520> light<00:01:44.850> and<00:01:45.149> therefore<00:01:45.810> requiring<00:01:46.170> less

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
to light and therefore requiring less

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.100 
to light and therefore requiring less
light<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.610> light<00:01:47.759> the<00:01:47.939> picture<00:01:48.329> or<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.899> fact

the<00:01:49.229> video<00:01:49.350> if<00:01:49.770> you're<00:01:49.890> doing<00:01:50.040> video<00:01:50.250> work

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
the video if you're doing video work

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.090 
the video if you're doing video work
with<00:01:51.000> your<00:01:51.299> DSLR<00:01:51.689> or<00:01:52.110> your<00:01:52.290> compact<00:01:52.649> camera

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
with your DSLR or your compact camera

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.639 
with your DSLR or your compact camera
now<00:01:53.820> how<00:01:54.000> does<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.240> do<00:01:54.479> this<00:01:54.509> well<00:01:55.229> essentially

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
now how does it do this well essentially

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.490 
now how does it do this well essentially
what<00:01:55.770> happens<00:01:56.219> is<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.610> sensor<00:01:57.360> enlarges<00:01:58.350> the

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
what happens is the sensor enlarges the

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:01.459 
what happens is the sensor enlarges the
pixels<00:01:59.040> and<00:01:59.369> makes<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.600> sensor<00:02:00.869> more

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
pixels and makes the sensor more

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.039 
pixels and makes the sensor more
sensitive<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> light<00:02:02.369> as<00:02:02.759> you<00:02:03.180> go<00:02:03.329> up<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> ISO

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
sensitive to light as you go up the ISO

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.310 
sensitive to light as you go up the ISO
range<00:02:04.640> now<00:02:05.640> the<00:02:05.700> problem<00:02:06.119> is<00:02:06.210> with<00:02:06.600> going<00:02:07.110> up

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
range now the problem is with going up

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.139 
range now the problem is with going up
in<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.649> ISO<00:02:08.039> range<00:02:08.280> because<00:02:08.580> a<00:02:08.610> lot<00:02:08.789> of<00:02:08.819> people

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
in the ISO range because a lot of people

they're<00:02:21.489> also<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:22.180> to<00:02:22.269> lose<00:02:22.629> some<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:23.019> the

they're also going to lose some of the

they're also going to lose some of the

00:02:26.789 --> 00:02:26.799 
color accuracy as well and you may even

00:02:26.799 --> 00:02:29.369 
color accuracy as well and you may even
introduce<00:02:27.519> a<00:02:27.700> range<00:02:27.909> of<00:02:28.180> kind<00:02:28.690> of<00:02:28.750> greens<00:02:29.110> or

00:02:29.369 --> 00:02:29.379 
introduce a range of kind of greens or

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:31.589 
introduce a range of kind of greens or
something<00:02:29.769> into<00:02:30.159> your<00:02:30.280> picture<00:02:30.730> to<00:02:31.180> add<00:02:31.329> to

00:02:31.589 --> 00:02:31.599 
something into your picture to add to

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.649 
something into your picture to add to
that<00:02:31.629> level<00:02:31.959> of<00:02:32.170> grain<00:02:32.440> so<00:02:33.400> the<00:02:33.549> idea<00:02:33.970> is<00:02:34.150> that

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:34.659 
that level of grain so the idea is that

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.589 
that level of grain so the idea is that
you<00:02:34.810> keep<00:02:35.079> the<00:02:35.290> ISO<00:02:35.739> as<00:02:36.010> low<00:02:36.459> as<00:02:36.790> possible<00:02:36.819> all

00:02:37.589 --> 00:02:37.599 
you keep the ISO as low as possible all

00:02:37.599 --> 00:02:39.960 
you keep the ISO as low as possible all
the<00:02:37.659> time<00:02:38.140> while<00:02:38.769> still<00:02:39.190> giving<00:02:39.400> you<00:02:39.760> the

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
the time while still giving you the

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.759 
the time while still giving you the
shutter<00:02:40.239> speed<00:02:40.629> and<00:02:40.810> the<00:02:40.900> aperture<00:02:41.530> that

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:43.319 
shutter speed and the aperture that
you're<00:02:41.950> going<00:02:42.099> to<00:02:42.129> require<00:02:42.250> to<00:02:42.970> correctly

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
performance is if you have something

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:08.470 
like a d3 s for example you're going to

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.380 
like a d3 s for example you're going to
be<00:03:08.530> able<00:03:08.590> to<00:03:08.709> bump<00:03:08.920> the<00:03:09.069> ISO<00:03:09.459> up<00:03:09.609> to<00:03:09.819> a<00:03:09.849> to<00:03:10.359> a

00:03:15.149 --> 00:03:15.159 
grain free pictures however if you've

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
how do we go about actually sitting the

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:36.809 
and there's a few ways in which you can
actually<00:03:34.060> set<00:03:34.540> the<00:03:34.959> ISO<00:03:35.109> on<00:03:35.560> the<00:03:35.650> camera<00:03:36.010> now

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
actually set the ISO on the camera now

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:38.819 
actually set the ISO on the camera now

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:48.930 
that is on the back of the camera we've
got<00:03:46.690> an<00:03:46.780> ISO<00:03:47.290> button<00:03:47.560> we<00:03:48.069> simply<00:03:48.430> hold<00:03:48.699> that

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
got an ISO button we simply hold that

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:53.430 
got an ISO button we simply hold that
down<00:03:49.239> and<00:03:49.540> then<00:03:50.139> we<00:03:50.349> rotate<00:03:50.889> the<00:03:51.870> dial<00:03:52.870> on<00:03:53.169> the

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:53.440 
down and then we rotate the dial on the

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:55.409 
down and then we rotate the dial on the
back<00:03:53.590> of<00:03:53.769> the<00:03:53.859> camera<00:03:54.069> to<00:03:54.430> actually<00:03:54.879> change

00:03:55.409 --> 00:03:55.419 
back of the camera to actually change

00:03:55.419 --> 00:03:58.559 
back of the camera to actually change
the<00:03:55.959> ISO<00:03:56.440> up<00:03:56.739> and<00:03:57.190> down<00:03:57.370> simply<00:03:57.819> by<00:03:58.090> spinning

00:03:58.559 --> 00:03:58.569 
the ISO up and down simply by spinning

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:00.410 
the ISO up and down simply by spinning
the<00:03:58.690> wheel

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
the wheel

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.170 
the wheel
now<00:04:01.260> another<00:04:01.770> way<00:04:01.980> to<00:04:02.010> do<00:04:02.310> this<00:04:02.490> is<00:04:02.910> to

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
now another way to do this is to

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.240 
now another way to do this is to
actually<00:04:03.300> go<00:04:03.660> into<00:04:03.960> the<00:04:04.110> menu<00:04:04.590> on<00:04:04.740> your<00:04:04.890> camera

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:05.250 
actually go into the menu on your camera

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.400 
actually go into the menu on your camera
and<00:04:05.430> then<00:04:05.790> on<00:04:05.970> the<00:04:06.090> back<00:04:06.270> of<00:04:06.450> your<00:04:06.630> camera<00:04:07.080> once

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:07.410 
and then on the back of your camera once

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:09.020 
and then on the back of your camera once
you're<00:04:07.590> in<00:04:07.740> your<00:04:07.920> menu<00:04:08.280> you're<00:04:08.700> going<00:04:08.730> to<00:04:08.910> have

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
you're in your menu you're going to have

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.180 
you're in your menu you're going to have
the<00:04:09.150> ability<00:04:09.510> to<00:04:09.540> go<00:04:10.230> into<00:04:10.530> the<00:04:10.800> ISO

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:11.190 
the ability to go into the ISO

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:14.090 
the ability to go into the ISO
sensitivity<00:04:11.459> there<00:04:12.180> and<00:04:12.360> change<00:04:13.350> it<00:04:13.590> exactly

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
sensitivity there and change it exactly

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.039 
sensitivity there and change it exactly
as<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.310> want<00:04:14.670> to<00:04:14.880> and<00:04:15.090> set<00:04:15.569> it<00:04:15.720> within<00:04:15.840> the

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
as you want to and set it within the

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.330 
as you want to and set it within the
menu<00:04:16.380> itself<00:04:18.140> now<00:04:19.140> there's<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.500> other<00:04:19.709> way<00:04:20.190> in

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:20.340 
menu itself now there's one other way in

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.370 
menu itself now there's one other way in
which<00:04:20.400> you<00:04:20.640> can<00:04:20.760> do<00:04:20.910> it<00:04:21.090> and<00:04:21.269> that<00:04:21.600> is<00:04:21.780> to<00:04:22.049> put

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:22.380 
which you can do it and that is to put

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:25.010 
which you can do it and that is to put
the<00:04:22.470> camera<00:04:22.800> into<00:04:23.220> Live<00:04:23.700> View<00:04:24.000> mode<00:04:24.090> again

00:04:25.010 --> 00:04:25.020 
the camera into Live View mode again

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.950 
the camera into Live View mode again
hold<00:04:25.590> down<00:04:25.740> the<00:04:25.950> our<00:04:26.070> ISO<00:04:26.669> button<00:04:26.970> on<00:04:27.330> the<00:04:27.780> back

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
hold down the our ISO button on the back

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:29.900 
hold down the our ISO button on the back
of<00:04:28.110> the<00:04:28.230> camera<00:04:28.470> or<00:04:28.890> wherever<00:04:29.160> it<00:04:29.430> may<00:04:29.580> be<00:04:29.640> on

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
of the camera or wherever it may be on

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.760 
of the camera or wherever it may be on
your<00:04:29.940> particular<00:04:30.330> brand<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:31.020> then<00:04:31.470> change

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
your particular brand and then change

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.650 
your particular brand and then change
the<00:04:31.980> ISO<00:04:32.430> and<00:04:32.760> you<00:04:32.820> can<00:04:32.970> see<00:04:33.150> it<00:04:33.240> going<00:04:33.390> up<00:04:33.540> and

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660 
the ISO and you can see it going up and

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.430 
the ISO and you can see it going up and
down<00:04:33.810> there<00:04:34.110> at<00:04:34.200> the<00:04:34.230> bottom<00:04:36.080> now<00:04:37.080> obviously

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
down there at the bottom now obviously

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.080 
down there at the bottom now obviously
that<00:04:37.740> is<00:04:37.890> going<00:04:38.040> to<00:04:38.100> change<00:04:38.340> depending<00:04:38.760> on

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
that is going to change depending on

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.090 
that is going to change depending on
what<00:04:39.330> kind<00:04:39.510> of<00:04:39.660> camera<00:04:40.080> you've<00:04:40.200> got<00:04:40.470> if<00:04:40.860> you've

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
what kind of camera you've got if you've

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:43.640 
what kind of camera you've got if you've
got<00:04:41.280> a<00:04:41.460> reasonably<00:04:42.090> new<00:04:42.360> NIC<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.810> then<00:04:43.290> it's

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:43.650 
got a reasonably new NIC on then it's

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:44.990 
got a reasonably new NIC on then it's
going<00:04:43.770> to<00:04:43.830> probably<00:04:44.040> be<00:04:44.280> pretty<00:04:44.730> much<00:04:44.850> the

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:45.000 
going to probably be pretty much the

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.940 
going to probably be pretty much the
same<00:04:45.180> as<00:04:45.390> how<00:04:45.510> I<00:04:45.540> just<00:04:45.900> showed<00:04:46.110> you<00:04:46.140> there<00:04:46.440> if

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:46.950 
same as how I just showed you there if

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.040 
same as how I just showed you there if
you've<00:04:47.100> got<00:04:47.280> a<00:04:47.310> Canon<00:04:47.790> it's<00:04:48.600> probably<00:04:48.960> not

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
you've got a Canon it's probably not

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.360 
you've got a Canon it's probably not
going<00:04:49.169> to<00:04:49.230> be<00:04:49.350> exactly<00:04:49.710> the<00:04:49.830> same<00:04:49.890> button

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370 
going to be exactly the same button

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.890 
going to be exactly the same button
because<00:04:50.610> obviously<00:04:50.730> the<00:04:51.030> buttons<00:04:51.600> are<00:04:51.720> laid

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
because obviously the buttons are laid

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.630 
because obviously the buttons are laid
out<00:04:51.930> and<00:04:52.290> labeled<00:04:52.650> slightly<00:04:52.980> differently<00:04:53.370> but

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
out and labeled slightly differently but

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:55.310 
out and labeled slightly differently but
it<00:04:53.940> probably<00:04:54.419> will<00:04:54.600> be<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.810> question<00:04:55.200> of

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:55.320 
it probably will be a question of

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.710 
it probably will be a question of
holding<00:04:55.560> down<00:04:55.950> the<00:04:56.430> ISO<00:04:56.880> button<00:04:57.120> while<00:04:57.570> I<00:04:57.600> was

turning<00:04:57.990> a<00:04:58.169> dial<00:04:58.350> or<00:04:58.950> going<00:04:59.370> into<00:04:59.580> the<00:04:59.669> menu

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.030
