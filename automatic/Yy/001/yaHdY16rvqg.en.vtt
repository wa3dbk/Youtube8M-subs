00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.730
 So it's in Monaco that ducati has decided 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.739
 to present his new devil the city 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.960
 Monegasque makes a beautiful case for 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.180
 this jewel of the motorcycle industry 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.040
 italian am I going to present you a 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.530
 little bit the small changes that 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:01.610
 we have on this 2014 version and then you 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.610
 give my driving impressions 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.530
 the evolution of the diavel 2014 begins with 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.090
 the aesthetic part with a new fire 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.860
 front fully led 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.750
 above the new jump ahead which has 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.430
 been reworked a little bit more 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.619
 dynamic and behind we have again 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.660
 count on which is fixed a handlebar 

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:23.610
 which was lowered to bring them 

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.380
 driver to promote his comfort as 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.119
 the fact that we find a saddle a 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.680
 little bit more dug that keeps 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.090
 perfectly records one of 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.560
 aesthetic changes you have 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.110
 noticed these beautiful rims in 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:35.670
 cast aluminum rims with 14 branches 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.100
 which would be lighter than on 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.020
 the old version of the diavel but the 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.770
 main changes can be found at 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:44.369
 engine level 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.320
 we find the testastretta 11 Â° of 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.599
 monster 12 cents but also from the 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.940
 multistrada so it's a two-cylinder in 

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:51.750
 l double ignition for better 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.429
 combustion 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.009
 there are also air inlets 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:58.890
 bigger one an exhaust that has 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:02:01.709
 been reworked in free version 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:02.069
 we have the same power as before 162 

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:04.500
 horses 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:08.009
 on the other hand the couple increases on 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.959
 would gain 0.5 m kg of torque all that 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:13.370
 to promote accreditation and in particular 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.370
 low speed flexibility 

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:05.040
 so side driving sensations on 

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:06.780
 find one that was very surprising 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:08.430
 on the first of the wants is when 

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.550
 even a machine with a wheelbase 

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:13.200
 quite large enough and 

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.430
 yet she is well balanced already 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:15.990
 at first and then in a 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.910
 second time we still have to say that 

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.070
 ducati has worked quite a bit on the 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:21.840
 response to acceleration whatever 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:23.550
 the mapping then of course when 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.140
 can be found in the urban mode or on 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.300
 touring modes with power 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:29.880
 delivered fairly gradually 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.870
 we control his subject more easily 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:34.380
 being in sport mode 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:35.520
 despite the debauchery of energy 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:37.200
 open a little big you can 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.910
 still rolled on a gas net 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.380
 so if they had filled him well his 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:42.150
 Mission is a beautiful machine with 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.560
 which one is not ashamed to be 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:45.390
 to have in town but with which one 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.820
 also takes a lot of fun 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.520
 its dynamic qualities are proven 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:53.190
 allen very good fork cycle and 

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:54.960
 damper are well tuned we get 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.760
 still at the limits of the guard at the 

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.500
 soil and we feel a lot of comfort 1 

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.510
 thanks to this seating but also 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.810
 thanks to the flexibility of the shock absorber 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.220
 the back and then the positioning of the 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.410
 controls and very ergonomic 

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:09.840
 braking side it's all good as good 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:12.120
 attack the power is there and then in 

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:14.640
 case of concern on the bsa endowment of 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.690
 series as we find the dtc the ducati 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.220
 traction control 

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:18.840
 if you decide to sell your soul to 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.280
 devil be cracked for the devil of 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:23.670
 at ducati know it will cost you 

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:25.830
 18 90 euros for the black matte version 

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.410
 but if you opt for the gam and 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.890
 carbon available in two colors red 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.260
 and white had 21 1590 euros 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:36.240
 these machines are currently arriving in 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.890
 the ducati network if you want everything 

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.450
