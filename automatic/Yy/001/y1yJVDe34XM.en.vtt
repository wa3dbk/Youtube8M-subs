00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:31.659 
what they think is best for this

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:34.499 
what they think is best for this
football<00:01:31.780> team<00:01:31.990> so<00:01:32.759> we<00:01:33.759> have<00:01:33.909> a<00:01:33.939> draft<00:01:34.240> coming

00:01:34.499 --> 00:01:34.509 
football team so we have a draft coming

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.440 
football team so we have a draft coming
up<00:01:34.799> and<00:01:35.799> there's<00:01:36.610> always<00:01:36.880> players<00:01:37.149> available

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
up and there's always players available

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:39.060 
up and there's always players available
in<00:01:37.720> a<00:01:37.780> draft<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.229> so<00:01:38.350> I'm<00:01:38.500> sure<00:01:38.680> we'll<00:01:38.890> have

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:39.070 
in a draft and so I'm sure we'll have

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:41.730 
in a draft and so I'm sure we'll have
you<00:01:39.939> know<00:01:40.030> some<00:01:40.299> pretty<00:01:40.810> able<00:01:40.930> bodied<00:01:41.470> running

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
you know some pretty able bodied running

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.410 
you know some pretty able bodied running
backs<00:01:41.920> most<00:01:42.189> the<00:01:42.310> season<00:01:42.640> starts<00:01:42.909> no<00:01:43.060> problem

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
backs most the season starts no problem

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.910 
backs most the season starts no problem
but<00:01:43.570> I<00:01:43.659> don't<00:01:43.810> think<00:01:44.020> that<00:01:44.079> it's<00:01:44.380> been<00:01:44.590> proven

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:44.920 
but I don't think that it's been proven

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.550 
but I don't think that it's been proven
in<00:01:45.009> this<00:01:45.159> league<00:01:45.340> that<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.610> have<00:01:45.790> to<00:01:45.939> have<00:01:46.090> a

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
in this league that you have to have a

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.230 
in this league that you have to have a
first-round<00:01:47.560> running<00:01:47.890> back<00:01:48.040> in<00:01:48.250> order<00:01:48.640> to<00:01:48.880> you

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
first-round running back in order to you

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:50.639 
first-round running back in order to you
know<00:01:49.270> be<00:01:49.689> effective<00:01:50.110> in<00:01:50.200> this<00:01:50.290> league<00:01:50.530> I<00:01:50.619> think

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
know be effective in this league I think

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:53.249 
know be effective in this league I think
that's<00:01:51.009> an<00:01:51.130> improvement<00:01:51.399> so<00:01:52.049> I'm<00:01:53.049> sure

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:53.259 
that's an improvement so I'm sure

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:54.990 
that's an improvement so I'm sure
they'll<00:01:53.439> find<00:01:53.469> one<00:01:53.829> at<00:01:53.950> one<00:01:54.100> point<00:01:54.310> whether

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
they'll find one at one point whether

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.810 
they'll find one at one point whether
that's<00:01:55.270> first<00:01:55.509> or<00:01:55.750> third<00:01:55.990> or<00:01:56.740> second<00:01:57.430> or<00:01:57.520> fifth

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:57.820 
that's first or third or second or fifth

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.359 
that's first or third or second or fifth
or<00:01:58.030> sit<00:01:58.270> whatever<00:01:58.570> so<00:01:58.960> you<00:01:59.259> know<00:01:59.350> they<00:02:00.130> have<00:02:00.310> a

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:00.369 
or sit whatever so you know they have a

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:02.610 
or sit whatever so you know they have a
plan
