okay well I'm just going to start with

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.849 
okay well I'm just going to start with
whole<00:03:04.819> new<00:03:05.060> ok<00:03:05.959> so<00:03:06.680> what<00:03:06.799> you<00:03:06.920> do<00:03:07.069> is<00:03:08.859> take

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:09.859 
whole new ok so what you do is take

00:03:09.859 --> 00:03:14.770 
whole new ok so what you do is take
these<00:03:10.100> and<00:03:12.069> you<00:03:13.069> cut<00:03:13.400> it<00:03:13.639> off<00:03:13.819> but<00:03:14.600> be<00:03:14.750> careful

these and you cut it off but be careful

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.540 
these and you cut it off but be careful
because<00:03:15.109> they<00:03:15.380> might<00:03:15.560> fly

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:19.550 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:21.890 

this<00:03:20.550> might<00:03:20.760> not<00:03:20.910> be<00:03:20.970> long<00:03:21.270> enough<00:03:21.510> i'm<00:03:21.720> not

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
this might not be long enough i'm not

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:25.430 
this might not be long enough i'm not
sure<00:03:22.140> but<00:03:23.540> every<00:03:24.540> time<00:03:24.660> I<00:03:24.780> cut<00:03:24.930> it<00:03:25.020> for<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.200> video

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
sure but every time I cut it for a video

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.400 
sure but every time I cut it for a video
it's<00:03:25.650> not<00:03:25.830> long<00:03:26.010> enough<00:03:26.390> and<00:03:27.390> then<00:03:27.930> you<00:03:28.200> just

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:28.410 
it's not long enough and then you just

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:30.260 
it's not long enough and then you just
take<00:03:28.620> it<00:03:28.739> like<00:03:28.770> that<00:03:28.890> if<00:03:29.340> you<00:03:29.550> want<00:03:29.790> to<00:03:30.000> I

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:30.270 
take it like that if you want to I

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:33.500 
take it like that if you want to I
usually<00:03:30.900> don't<00:03:31.020> do<00:03:31.230> this<00:03:32.120> wrap<00:03:33.120> it<00:03:33.300> around<00:03:33.360> the

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:33.510 
usually don't do this wrap it around the

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:39.800 
usually don't do this wrap it around the
pencil<00:03:34.580> and<00:03:35.580> tighten<00:03:36.120> it<00:03:36.709> the<00:03:37.709> tweezers<00:03:38.810> and

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
pencil and tighten it the tweezers and

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.430 
pencil and tighten it the tweezers and
you<00:03:39.959> slide<00:03:40.230> it<00:03:40.410> off<00:03:40.590> and<00:03:41.989> that's<00:03:42.989> basically<00:03:43.230> it

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
you slide it off and that's basically it

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.620 
you slide it off and that's basically it
and<00:03:44.100> then<00:03:44.340> you<00:03:44.459> can<00:03:44.670> just<00:03:44.970> slide<00:03:45.360> it<00:03:45.600> on<00:03:46.370> but<00:03:47.370> um

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:47.630 
and then you can just slide it on but um

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:51.320 
and then you can just slide it on but um
you<00:03:48.630> can<00:03:48.750> paint<00:03:48.989> it<00:03:49.110> too<00:03:49.640> but<00:03:50.640> I'm<00:03:50.880> going<00:03:51.090> to<00:03:51.180> do

you can paint it too but I'm going to do

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:52.490 
you can paint it too but I'm going to do
that<00:03:51.450> right<00:03:51.510> now<00:03:51.660> because<00:03:52.080> I<00:03:52.110> don't<00:03:52.260> know<00:03:52.440> if

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
that right now because I don't know if

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710 
that right now because I don't know if
