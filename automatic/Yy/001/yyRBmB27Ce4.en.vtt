00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.280 
about 10 or 11 panels here there's a
little<00:03:47.290> one<00:03:47.380> down<00:03:47.560> here<00:03:48.510> can't<00:03:49.510> quite<00:03:49.900> get<00:03:50.080> to

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:50.290 
little one down here can't quite get to

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:51.810 
little one down here can't quite get to
it's<00:03:50.470> it's<00:03:50.800> completely<00:03:51.190> poised<00:03:51.610> I<00:03:51.670> think

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:51.820 
it's it's completely poised I think

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:53.040 
it's it's completely poised I think
that's<00:03:51.970> the<00:03:52.030> starting<00:03:52.330> panel<00:03:52.630> that<00:03:52.750> the<00:03:52.870> game

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
that's the starting panel that the game

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.010 
that's the starting panel that the game
will<00:03:53.170> usually<00:03:53.290> give<00:03:53.590> you<00:03:54.600> but<00:03:55.600> as<00:03:55.720> you<00:03:55.810> can<00:03:55.960> see

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:56.020 
will usually give you but as you can see

00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.420 
will usually give you but as you can see
this<00:03:56.320> was<00:03:56.470> just<00:03:56.650> kind<00:03:56.800> of<00:03:56.830> a<00:03:56.950> short<00:03:57.190> little

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
this was just kind of a short little

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.310 
this was just kind of a short little
test<00:03:57.670> room

00:03:58.310 --> 00:03:58.320 
test room

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.870 
test room
test<00:03:59.320> level<00:03:59.590> it's<00:03:59.710> it's<00:04:00.010> not<00:04:00.190> all<00:04:00.370> that<00:04:00.610> good

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
test level it's it's not all that good

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:03.240 
test level it's it's not all that good
like<00:04:01.150> it<00:04:01.300> first<00:04:01.690> first<00:04:02.170> level<00:04:02.410> you<00:04:02.440> know<00:04:02.590> it's

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:03.250 
like it first first level you know it's

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:05.550 
like it first first level you know it's
cool<00:04:03.430> but<00:04:03.700> it<00:04:04.210> doesn't<00:04:04.450> have<00:04:04.600> any<00:04:04.990> atmosphere

00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:05.560 
cool but it doesn't have any atmosphere

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.970 
cool but it doesn't have any atmosphere
it's<00:04:05.740> nothing<00:04:06.010> to<00:04:06.100> go<00:04:06.220> look<00:04:06.580> be<00:04:06.880> proud<00:04:07.120> about

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
it's nothing to go look be proud about

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:10.110 
it's nothing to go look be proud about
I'm<00:04:08.980> pretty<00:04:09.190> much<00:04:09.280> reiterating<00:04:09.790> what<00:04:09.820> I<00:04:09.910> said

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
I'm pretty much reiterating what I said

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.930 
I'm pretty much reiterating what I said
earlier<00:04:11.580> yeah

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
earlier yeah

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:17.120 
earlier yeah
Zachery<00:04:13.770> like<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:15.460> have<00:04:15.760> a<00:04:16.180> decent<00:04:16.510> level

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
Zachery like you have a decent level

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:21.230 
Zachery like you have a decent level
admittedly<00:04:18.130> right<00:04:18.760> here<00:04:19.270> not<00:04:20.260> there<00:04:20.470> here

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:21.240 
admittedly right here not there here

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:24.270 
admittedly right here not there here
this<00:04:22.240> little<00:04:22.540> jump<00:04:22.750> right<00:04:22.900> here<00:04:23.280> that

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
this little jump right here that

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.500 
this little jump right here that
actually<00:04:24.310> screwed<00:04:24.760> me<00:04:24.850> up<00:04:24.880> on<00:04:25.060> my<00:04:25.090> first<00:04:25.270> time

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:25.510 
actually screwed me up on my first time

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:26.580 
actually screwed me up on my first time
so<00:04:25.660> I<00:04:25.690> couldn't<00:04:25.840> get<00:04:25.960> the<00:04:26.050> timing<00:04:26.380> right<00:04:26.470> to

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:26.590 
so I couldn't get the timing right to

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:27.990 
so I couldn't get the timing right to
get<00:04:26.680> over<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.010> because<00:04:27.130> you<00:04:27.310> have<00:04:27.460> short<00:04:27.820> jump

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
get over it because you have short jump

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.550 
get over it because you have short jump
I'm<00:04:28.120> used<00:04:28.300> to<00:04:28.360> having<00:04:29.020> a<00:04:29.200> level<00:04:29.410> where<00:04:29.500> you

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
I'm used to having a level where you

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.350 
I'm used to having a level where you
have<00:04:29.590> the<00:04:29.770> long<00:04:29.950> jump<00:04:30.190> or<00:04:30.280> a<00:04:30.310> double<00:04:30.520> jump<00:04:30.670> so

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:31.360 
have the long jump or a double jump so

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:32.520 
have the long jump or a double jump so
that<00:04:31.480> was<00:04:31.570> a<00:04:31.600> little<00:04:31.750> bit<00:04:31.900> annoying<00:04:32.080> but<00:04:32.350> it's

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
that was a little bit annoying but it's

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:36.900 
that was a little bit annoying but it's
otherwise<00:04:32.770> okay<00:04:35.250> not<00:04:36.250> most<00:04:36.430> the<00:04:36.580> enemies<00:04:36.820> are

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
otherwise okay not most the enemies are

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:41.830 
otherwise okay not most the enemies are
pretty<00:04:37.170> similar<00:04:38.170> easy<00:04:38.620> to<00:04:38.830> do

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.620 

try<00:04:42.840> keep<00:04:43.110> keep<00:04:43.440> trying<00:04:44.330> ii-i'll<00:04:45.330> give<00:04:45.510> you<00:04:45.600> a

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:45.630 
try keep keep trying ii-i'll give you a

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.000 
try keep keep trying ii-i'll give you a
credit<00:04:45.870> for<00:04:45.990> actually<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.530> trying<00:04:46.830> to<00:04:46.890> make

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
credit for actually like trying to make

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:49.850 
credit for actually like trying to make
a<00:04:47.040> level<00:04:47.810> but<00:04:48.810> you<00:04:49.140> know<00:04:49.260> try<00:04:49.650> to<00:04:49.710> make

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
a level but you know try to make

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:50.930 
a level but you know try to make
something<00:04:50.010> a<00:04:50.100> little<00:04:50.250> more<00:04:50.340> larger<00:04:50.730> than<00:04:50.850> this

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
something a little more larger than this

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.670 
something a little more larger than this
one<00:04:51.150> you<00:04:51.660> probably<00:04:52.110> did<00:04:52.290> in<00:04:52.380> a<00:04:52.440> couple<00:04:52.650> hours

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
one you probably did in a couple hours

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:53.990 
one you probably did in a couple hours
once<00:04:52.980> you<00:04:53.040> started<00:04:53.280> learning<00:04:53.370> the<00:04:53.550> tools<00:04:53.730> but

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
once you started learning the tools but

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.460 
once you started learning the tools but
if<00:04:54.150> you<00:04:54.270> can<00:04:54.420> crank<00:04:54.630> are<00:04:54.780> like<00:04:54.900> a<00:04:54.930> really<00:04:55.230> sweet

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:55.470 
if you can crank are like a really sweet

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.100 
if you can crank are like a really sweet
level<00:04:55.860> this<00:04:56.610> would<00:04:56.730> be<00:04:56.820> pretty<00:04:57.060> cool<00:04:57.330> if

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
level this would be pretty cool if

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:59.720 
level this would be pretty cool if
anyone<00:04:58.500> has<00:04:58.650> any<00:04:58.860> opinions<00:04:59.280> they<00:04:59.400> want<00:04:59.580> to
