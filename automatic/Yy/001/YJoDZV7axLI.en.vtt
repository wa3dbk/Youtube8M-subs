it's going to be with drag-and-drop
it's<00:00:41.460> as<00:00:41.670> simple<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:42.060> selecting<00:00:42.270> some<00:00:42.870> images

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:49.560 
what you should expect you move them

alignment is in place now for the
remaining<00:00:56.430> area<00:00:56.700> I'll<00:00:56.850> drag<00:00:57.180> and<00:00:57.360> drop

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
remaining area I'll drag and drop

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.020 
remaining area I'll drag and drop
another<00:00:57.780> image<00:00:58.170> but<00:00:59.010> I'd<00:00:59.130> like<00:00:59.280> a<00:00:59.309> custom<00:00:59.820> size

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030
