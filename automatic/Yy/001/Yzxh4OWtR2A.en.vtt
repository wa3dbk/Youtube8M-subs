00:00:05.189 --> 00:00:09.670
 yes hello is the pink welcomes you 

00:00:07.539 --> 00:00:12.160
 panther and we'll take a look 

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.930
 multiplayer from black ops 2 to us 

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:18.810
 want to make an analysis more accurate 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:18.810
 look at what's new there 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.289
 so there you can for the first interesting 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.510
 there should be something like knife 

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.750
 and the opponent is overruled 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:31.900
 with such an electric shock 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.579
 yes and here he uses the m8 1 32 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.170
 shot in the magazine had low 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:36.370
 setback comes here something completely 

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:37.390
 it is interesting that we look at each other 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.489
 Now again 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.500
 So that seems to be a sight where 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:41.950
 you see the opponents through objects 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.380
 can 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.320
 you can see a scanner visor on the right 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:49.230
 now comes back and so you can 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.790
 then keep it right 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.530
 You already know that from black ops 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:57.520
 you can throw yourself on the floor and 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:58.930
 so is not an easy target yes and 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:01.690
 Here you can see again that with the 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.230
 Visor also through smoke 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.910
 can 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:07.479
 Here we come to the same now 

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:10.750
 a new device because the enemy is with 

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:13.150
 shot down at microwaves and that's heat 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:16.210
 pure heat we already know the visor 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.040
 from mp3 the hybrid visor come now 

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.520
 to a small mini helicopter 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:24.369
 with four rotors so one can from the 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.860
 bird's eye view with the end on his 

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:28.320
 shoot enemy 

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:31.409
 on the other hand there are the 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:34.770
 fh j 18 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:39.450
 In addition , there were also signs there are 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:43.020
 again just as he calls it 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.490
 this time a sentry drone creamy like 

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.430
 stop on modern warfare 3 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 yes he is as a supply crate from 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.710
 dropped helicopter and then everything 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.009
 raushauen what the stuff holds here 

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
 we take a knife 

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.940
 the same will happen again 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.610
 tomahawk like from the first part 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:05.810
 Here we now see the idea sr 50 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.729
 sniper rifle and the train is 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.400
 you have to register now 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.840
 reload times 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:17.700
 now he has a city here can m 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:21.120
 12 16 with 16 shot and c4 thrown there 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:23.360
 times the x10 40 pegasus throne the 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.270
 news conclusion too 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.270
 controllable is known yes 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.490
 I'm from MB 3. I hope I could 

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.260
 give a little insight and 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:35.840
 thank you for watching 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.020
 I'm looking forward to it all 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.070
 especially on the multiplayer 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:45.460
 say goodbye to the last one 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.460
