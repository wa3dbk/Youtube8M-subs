00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.530
 hello my dear viewers with you reviews 

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:18.380
 Brick and we continue to shoot a series 

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.390
 tanks called division and today 

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.520
 on the review we have a tiny tank 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.009
 name and huge size 

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:30.230
 tank maus like this 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:33.770
 boxes let's see how she 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.739
 looks like rubber tracks 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.960
 spinning towers and our loved ones 

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:40.640
 original parts but something to me 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.070
 suggests original parts 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.440
 This set will differ from 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.739
 original kit parts in t-34 and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.379
 KV-1 This type of tank was developed 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.570
 whole two years and two were made 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.749
 prototypes of which only one received 

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:58.519
 turret with weapons but as I already know neither 

00:00:56.749 --> 00:01:01.670
 one tank did not participate in real 

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:03.530
 fighting in general I think that this 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.320
 the tank was invented more for fear 

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:08.650
 and moral repression of enemies than 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:11.150
 for any real fighting 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:13.250
 finally it is time to open this 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.280
 box and see the contents of this 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.830
 set of 6 such bags is pretty 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.820
 after all, let's take a look at tradition 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:25.310
 on instruction 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:28.160
 and this is the reverse side of the instruction here 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:30.070
 presented all the tanks of this series write 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.800
 in the comments which tank do you like 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.290
 on the contents of the package seems to be everything to me 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.520
 can not wait to collect this tank and you 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:43.280
 see it already assembled and immediately 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.860
 on the minuses of this tank the caterpillars are very 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.330
 strong rubber smell but here 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.160
 I generally have this part 

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:51.020
 to replace 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:53.360
 the tank turned out pretty big and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.550
 beautiful in appearance but not in a hurry 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.790
 rejoice friends and I'll tell you now 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:01.780
 why besides those flaws about which 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.550
 I have already said in this tank they are still 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.550
 The first design of this tank is not very 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:09.530
 sturdy 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.720
 collapsed during assembly second 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:14.450
 the tracks of this tank do not match 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.989
 its size, therefore, the tank itself cannot 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:21.260
 move well and the last third is 

00:02:17.989 --> 00:02:24.269
 falling off parts 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.980
 such a tank will not be able to play it 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:29.400
 can only be put on the shelf 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:34.500
 for beauty maximum as you can im 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:36.200
 play it so twist the towers and like me 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.110
 spoke at the beginning of this set 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.760
 alternative details are really different 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:46.860
 the first detail is this decoration 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:50.099
 a destroyed house with one frame 2 this 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:52.410
 Here are three bags, let's compare 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:54.720
 minifigures of this set below 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.989
 represented by two soldiers of the German army and 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:01.680
 above our Russian soldiers and in my 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:03.239
 Germans are also unhappy with their tanks if 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:05.609
 You do not plan to play this tank 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:08.280
 just want to put it on the shelf 

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:11.670
 then you can buy such a tank but still I 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:14.069
 do not advise you to advise those who 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:16.099
 still decided to buy this kit i can 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.530
 wish only patience and good luck 

00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:21.510
