in general as a whole before we begin I
want<00:00:18.600> to<00:00:18.660> remind<00:00:18.750> you<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.260> the<00:00:19.529> most

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
want to remind you that the most

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.130 
want to remind you that the most
accurate<00:00:20.070> color<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.910> testing<00:00:21.510> that<00:00:21.600> you<00:00:21.779> can<00:00:21.990> do

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:22.140 
accurate color a testing that you can do

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.790 
accurate color a testing that you can do
will<00:00:22.470> be<00:00:22.650> using<00:00:23.130> a<00:00:23.279> color<00:00:23.609> a<00:00:23.760> test<00:00:24.240> circle<00:00:24.869> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
will be using a color a test circle this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.920 
will be using a color a test circle this
is<00:00:25.859> a<00:00:26.039> circle<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.640> gems<00:00:26.910> that<00:00:27.090> contain<00:00:27.599> one

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
is a circle of gems that contain one

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.589 
is a circle of gems that contain one
each<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.529> the<00:00:28.619> color<00:00:29.279> a<00:00:29.400> bearing<00:00:30.060> gemstones

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
each of the color a bearing gemstones

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.280 
each of the color a bearing gemstones
plus<00:00:30.990> white<00:00:31.289> barrel<00:00:32.540> this<00:00:33.540> particular

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
plus white barrel this particular

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.740 
plus white barrel this particular
technique<00:00:34.770> allows<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.340> to<00:00:35.700> use<00:00:35.880> any<00:00:36.090> answer

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
technique allows you to use any answer

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.139 
technique allows you to use any answer
receiving<00:00:37.230> method<00:00:37.590> that<00:00:37.800> you<00:00:37.950> know<00:00:38.190> and<00:00:38.610> it

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.149 
receiving method that you know and it

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:40.610 
receiving method that you know and it
will<00:00:39.239> get<00:00:39.420> you<00:00:39.540> started<00:00:39.570> working<00:00:40.260> with<00:00:40.469> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
will get you started working with the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.130 
will get you started working with the
color<00:00:40.829> race<00:00:41.100> at<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> very<00:00:42.180> introductory<00:00:42.690> level

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
color race at a very introductory level

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.190 
color race at a very introductory level
but<00:00:43.530> that's<00:00:43.649> okay<00:00:44.040> so<00:00:44.450> to<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.809> this<00:00:45.930> technique

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
but that's okay so to do this technique

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.229 
but that's okay so to do this technique
you<00:00:46.559> will<00:00:46.680> need<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:46.980> set<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.550> the<00:00:47.640> seven<00:00:48.000> color

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
you will need a set of the seven color

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.900 
you will need a set of the seven color
race<00:00:48.510> phrase<00:00:48.870> and<00:00:49.260> this<00:00:49.950> is<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.219> sample<00:00:50.670> set

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
race phrase and this is the sample set

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.000 
race phrase and this is the sample set
of<00:00:51.120> the<00:00:51.239> one<00:00:51.420> ounce<00:00:51.600> bottles<00:00:52.199> but<00:00:52.530> you<00:00:52.770> could

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
of the one ounce bottles but you could

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.729 
of the one ounce bottles but you could
just<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.309> easily<00:00:53.489> use<00:00:53.910> two<00:00:54.149> ounce<00:00:54.329> bottles<00:00:54.840> and

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
just as easily use two ounce bottles and

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.500 
just as easily use two ounce bottles and
of<00:00:55.980> course<00:00:56.190> you'll<00:00:56.399> also<00:00:56.550> have<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.090> know<00:00:57.480> how

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
of course you'll also have to know how

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.290 
of course you'll also have to know how
to<00:00:57.870> do<00:00:58.260> an<00:00:58.379> answer<00:00:58.739> receiving<00:00:59.219> technique<00:00:59.609> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
to do an answer receiving technique this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.119 
to do an answer receiving technique this
could<00:01:00.510> be<00:01:00.629> anything<00:01:00.809> like<00:01:01.199> muscle<00:01:01.680> testing

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
could be anything like muscle testing

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.359 
could be anything like muscle testing
and<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.640> ative<00:01:02.850> testing<00:01:03.300> using<00:01:03.629> a<00:01:03.719> pendulum

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
and to ative testing using a pendulum

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:07.330 
and to ative testing using a pendulum
anything<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.549> that<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.790> works<00:01:06.240> for<00:01:06.479> you

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
anything like that that works for you

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.210 
anything like that that works for you
okay<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.060> procedure<00:01:09.710> you<00:01:10.710> first<00:01:11.010> of

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
okay so to do the procedure you first of

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.850 
okay so to do the procedure you first of
all<00:01:11.369> think<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.119> a<00:01:12.479> life<00:01:12.780> issue<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.740> would

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
all think of a life issue that you would

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.330 
all think of a life issue that you would
like<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.220> work<00:01:14.400> with<00:01:14.960> so<00:01:15.960> let<00:01:16.860> me<00:01:16.920> just<00:01:17.070> think<00:01:17.280> a

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
like to work with so let me just think a

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.990 
like to work with so let me just think a
second<00:01:18.680> okay<00:01:19.680> I've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.159> one<00:01:20.369> I'm<00:01:20.700> not<00:01:20.850> going

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
heart you're you're higher up than that

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:47.810 
heart you're you're higher up than that
okay<00:01:43.790> now<00:01:44.790> what<00:01:45.180> I'm<00:01:45.270> going<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.479> do<00:01:45.689> is<00:01:46.640> find<00:01:47.640> a

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
okay now what I'm going to do is find a

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.770 
okay now what I'm going to do is find a
collar<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.659> resonates<00:01:49.320> the<00:01:49.500> best<00:01:50.630> and<00:01:51.630> I

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
collar a that resonates the best and I

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.469 
collar a that resonates the best and I
like<00:01:51.990> to<00:01:52.110> use<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.290> pull<00:01:52.649> end<00:01:52.829> technique<00:01:53.479> I'm

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
like to use a pull end technique I'm

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.069 
like to use a pull end technique I'm
going<00:01:54.899> to<00:01:55.020> try<00:01:55.229> pulling<00:01:55.740> in<00:01:55.920> with<00:01:56.280> each<00:01:57.240> of<00:01:57.509> the

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
going to try pulling in with each of the

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
going to try pulling in with each of the
sprays<00:01:58.439> and<00:01:58.710> as<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:58.979> can<00:01:59.130> see<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> was<00:01:59.790> the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
sprays and as you can see it was the

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.190 
sprays and as you can see it was the
