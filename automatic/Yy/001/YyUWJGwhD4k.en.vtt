 hello everyone welcome to my channel in 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.779
 this time I'm going to show you how to do 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:09.839
 pizzas but with bobbin to mustache like 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.539
 know they are very easy and not very rich 

00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.309
 here I have two bobbin hooks to the 

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:23.130
 half 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:23.130
 and here I have a grill as well as 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:34.100
 we shout good what we are going to occupy is 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:42.140
 sauce the brand does not matter but then this 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:45.340
 style to show you how to put here 

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:45.340
 and the will 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.210
 and now salsa 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:55.950
 I like it a lot as you know so much 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.740
 t 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:00.810
 I also have those years here what 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.750
 games and small because if I eat him 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.750
 call carrot if chile vinegar 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.560
 what you 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.950
 a sounds as I know it 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:28.440
 chile bell green the decision 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:33.720
 so they put the group to put fungi 

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:36.490
 mushrooms as you know them and one 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.130
 but even so he tells me to surrender 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.049
 more because I did not have much 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.630
 also precedes better because there is 

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:47.640
 small 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:47.640
 they put him others that are going to look bad 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:54.850
 is going to put some peppers 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.850
 it's something too 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:12.590
 and not much flavor and not just much of 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.590
 example with the other 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:21.240
 and I already have the normal gold is for 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.100
 that is gratin I have them at 300 degrees and 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:26.160
 logic that ends I'll show you 

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:29.210
 I'm going to put in for 10-15 minutes and 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.210
 economic anabel will stay 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:39.070
 The truth is that it is delicious and very 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:42.340
 easy for you to show 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:42.340
 baked 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:57.400
 and a little bit of pastrami down here 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.400
 I'm going to put 

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:04.600
 10-15 minutes maybe 20 maximum within 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.390

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:09.400

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:13.030
