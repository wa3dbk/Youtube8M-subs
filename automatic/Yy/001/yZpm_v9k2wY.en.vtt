00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:16.790 
way we did you know on that restart you
know<00:00:15.660> I<00:00:15.719> thought<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.080> had<00:00:16.260> him<00:00:16.410> he<00:00:16.500> was<00:00:16.619> better

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
know I thought we had him he was better

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.380 
know I thought we had him he was better
than<00:00:17.010> us<00:00:17.160> but<00:00:17.430> I<00:00:17.460> thought<00:00:17.670> you<00:00:18.119> know<00:00:18.180> out<00:00:18.359> in

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
than us but I thought you know out in

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:20.510 
than us but I thought you know out in
front<00:00:18.750> we<00:00:18.900> could<00:00:19.020> hold<00:00:19.170> him<00:00:19.320> off<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:20.100> got<00:00:20.490> a

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
front we could hold him off I got a

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.890 
front we could hold him off I got a
perfect<00:00:20.760> restore<00:00:21.240> on<00:00:21.300> that<00:00:21.420> last<00:00:21.570> one

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:21.900 
perfect restore on that last one

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.470 
perfect restore on that last one
probably<00:00:22.020> jumped<00:00:22.439> him<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.619> little<00:00:22.830> bit<00:00:23.240> and<00:00:24.240> I

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
probably jumped him a little bit and I

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.640 
probably jumped him a little bit and I
moved<00:00:24.660> out<00:00:24.750> in<00:00:24.869> front<00:00:25.050> of<00:00:25.170> them<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.410> it<00:00:25.470> looked

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:25.650 
moved out in front of them and it looked

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:27.259 
moved out in front of them and it looked
like<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:25.920> need<00:00:26.099> to<00:00:26.130> block<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.519> inside<00:00:26.670> so<00:00:27.210> you

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
like I need to block the inside so you

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.880 
like I need to block the inside so you
know<00:00:27.570> I<00:00:27.599> kind<00:00:27.840> of<00:00:27.960> protect<00:00:28.230> the<00:00:28.349> hit<00:00:28.500> side<00:00:28.710> he

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
know I kind of protect the hit side he

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.620 
know I kind of protect the hit side he
blasted<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.460> out<00:00:29.609> there<00:00:29.880> on<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> outside

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
blasted up out there on the outside

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.410 
blasted up out there on the outside
flat<00:00:30.960> out<00:00:31.199> drove<00:00:31.470> me<00:00:31.650> through<00:00:31.890> one<00:00:32.099> and<00:00:32.420> I'm

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
flat out drove me through one and I'm

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.470 
flat out drove me through one and I'm
disappointed<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:34.820> we<00:00:35.820> didn't<00:00:36.000> get<00:00:36.059> this<00:00:36.210> win

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
disappointed that we didn't get this win

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.720 
disappointed that we didn't get this win
just<00:00:37.140> right<00:00:37.530> there<00:00:37.710> in<00:00:37.739> the<00:00:37.920> mix<00:00:38.129> you<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.520> on

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
just right there in the mix you know on

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.490 
just right there in the mix you know on
restarts<00:00:39.270> I<00:00:39.450> felt<00:00:39.690> like<00:00:39.809> we<00:00:39.930> gained<00:00:40.170> spots

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
restarts I felt like we gained spots

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.119 
restarts I felt like we gained spots
each<00:00:40.680> time<00:00:40.950> and<00:00:41.309> the<00:00:42.030> lap<00:00:42.210> times<00:00:42.510> that<00:00:42.809> we<00:00:43.590> were

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
each time and the lap times that we were

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:45.950 
each time and the lap times that we were
running<00:00:44.309> before<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.000> final<00:00:45.210> pit<00:00:45.450> stop<00:00:45.690> we

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
running before that final pit stop we

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.389 
running before that final pit stop we
weren't<00:00:46.170> able<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.410> maintain<00:00:46.590> those<00:00:47.039> at<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
weren't able to maintain those at the

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.220 
weren't able to maintain those at the
end<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:47.820> so<00:00:47.969> temperatures<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.930> the<00:00:48.989> track

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
end and so temperatures of the track

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.020 
end and so temperatures of the track
increased<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.340> don't<00:00:50.550> think<00:00:50.760> we<00:00:50.850> changed

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
increased and I don't think we changed

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.090 
increased and I don't think we changed
anything<00:00:51.449> on<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.840> car<00:00:52.050> but<00:00:52.379> just<00:00:52.920> got<00:00:53.010> to

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
to get better and I don't think we did

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.429 
to get better and I don't think we did
was<00:01:42.299> a<00:01:42.329> little<00:01:42.479> bit<00:01:42.570> loose<00:01:42.659> an<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.049> day<00:01:43.200> little
