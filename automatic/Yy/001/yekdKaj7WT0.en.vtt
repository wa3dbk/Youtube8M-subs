00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
game you know again but I'm for the

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.779 
game you know again but I'm for the
potential<00:00:45.660> playstation<00:00:46.140> 3<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.550> this<00:00:47.550> is<00:00:47.760> a

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
potential playstation 3 and this is a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.100 
potential playstation 3 and this is a
little<00:00:48.030> bit<00:00:48.120> too<00:00:48.210> ridiculous<00:00:48.690> at<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:48.899> moment

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:49.110 
little bit too ridiculous at the moment

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.930 
little bit too ridiculous at the moment
perhaps<00:00:49.230> I'll<00:00:49.469> get<00:00:49.680> it<00:00:49.800> later<00:00:49.829> but<00:00:50.160> I<00:00:50.370> don't

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
perhaps I'll get it later but I don't

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.150 
perhaps I'll get it later but I don't
think<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.300> because<00:00:51.649> although<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.770> have<00:00:52.949> a<00:00:52.980> lot

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
think so because although I have a lot

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.619 
think so because although I have a lot
of<00:00:53.190> fun<00:00:53.399> with<00:00:53.640> this<00:00:53.670> game<00:00:53.820> it's<00:00:54.149> a<00:00:54.239> good<00:00:54.449> game

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
of fun with this game it's a good game

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.439 
of fun with this game it's a good game
anyway<00:00:54.949> I<00:00:55.949> don't<00:00:56.579> think<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.940> worth<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.420> buy

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
anyway I don't think it's worth to buy

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.750 
anyway I don't think it's worth to buy
for<00:00:57.840> a<00:00:57.870> second<00:00:58.230> console<00:00:58.680> you<00:00:58.829> know<00:00:58.980> or<00:00:59.190> I'm<00:00:59.550> not

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
for a second console you know or I'm not

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.029 
for a second console you know or I'm not
gonna<00:00:59.940> trade<00:01:00.239> this<00:01:00.270> in<00:01:00.660> because<00:01:00.870> I'm<00:01:01.710> kind<00:01:01.890> of

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
gonna trade this in because I'm kind of

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.490 
gonna trade this in because I'm kind of
sticking<00:01:02.520> with<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:02.820> same<00:01:02.850> crew<00:01:04.850> you<00:01:05.850> know<00:01:05.970> and

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:12.230 
it's kind of hard to explain but well
it's<00:01:10.500> not<00:01:10.560> hard<00:01:10.770> spacious<00:01:11.220> logic<00:01:11.610> my<00:01:11.970> own<00:01:12.060> my

had<00:02:14.200> a<00:02:14.230> hard<00:02:14.560> hard<00:02:14.860> time<00:02:15.160> getting<00:02:15.790> into<00:02:15.940> it<00:02:16.120> I

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
had a hard hard time getting into it I

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:20.640 
had a hard hard time getting into it I
still<00:02:16.480> need<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:16.959> get<00:02:17.200> into<00:02:17.410> it<00:02:17.530> more<00:02:19.650> the

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:20.650 
still need to get into it more the

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:22.589 
still need to get into it more the
weapons<00:02:20.980> are<00:02:21.099> pretty<00:02:22.000> cool<00:02:22.180> i<00:02:22.239> like<00:02:22.450> the

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:22.599 
weapons are pretty cool i like the

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:25.259 
weapons are pretty cool i like the
sounds<00:02:22.900> of<00:02:22.959> the<00:02:23.019> weapons<00:02:23.410> as<00:02:23.530> well<00:02:24.030> only<00:02:25.030> I

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
sounds of the weapons as well only I

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:26.970 
sounds of the weapons as well only I
think<00:02:25.360> their<00:02:25.840> specs<00:02:26.200> are<00:02:26.440> a<00:02:26.530> little<00:02:26.650> bit<00:02:26.830> to

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
think their specs are a little bit to

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.619 
think their specs are a little bit to
balance<00:02:27.430> and<00:02:27.640> they<00:02:27.730> kind<00:02:27.970> of<00:02:28.030> feel<00:02:28.239> the<00:02:28.360> same

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:28.629 
balance and they kind of feel the same

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:30.860 
balance and they kind of feel the same
there's<00:02:29.260> one<00:02:29.440> you<00:02:29.920> know<00:02:30.010> a<00:02:30.040> few<00:02:30.280> weapons<00:02:30.430> that

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:30.870 
there's one you know a few weapons that

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:35.250 
there's one you know a few weapons that
like<00:02:32.370> kick<00:02:33.370> out<00:02:33.549> the<00:02:33.849> you<00:02:34.209> know<00:02:34.330> but<00:02:34.510> show<00:02:35.080> off

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
like kick out the you know but show off

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.289 
like kick out the you know but show off
basically<00:02:35.500> but<00:02:35.860> it<00:02:36.370> is<00:02:36.519> basically<00:02:37.090> the<00:02:37.269> same

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:37.299 
basically but it is basically the same

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:39.780 
basically but it is basically the same
it's<00:02:37.900> kind<00:02:38.049> of<00:02:38.079> hard<00:02:38.260> to<00:02:38.290> explain<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:39.489> it

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:39.790 
it's kind of hard to explain but it

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:42.120 
it's kind of hard to explain but it
feels<00:02:39.940> pretty<00:02:40.150> much<00:02:40.299> the<00:02:40.510> same<00:02:41.010> except<00:02:42.010> for

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
feels pretty much the same except for

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:43.350 
feels pretty much the same except for
submachine<00:02:42.579> guns<00:02:42.790> we<00:02:42.910> will<00:02:43.000> see<00:02:43.120> if<00:02:43.180> you<00:02:43.239> have

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:47.349 
capacity and stuff like that but that's

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.190
