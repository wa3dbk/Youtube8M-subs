00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
 so franz the session is one and a half 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:05.009
 Weeks to end is the disappointment 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.220
 now completely processed with you 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:10.349
 no, why is it only the small ones? 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.570
 error on you're likely very different 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:14.820
 things 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.510
 that's because how is that 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:20.580
 come of the social business and 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:23.189
 an own stupidity or others 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.830
 referee decision then if you 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.560
 statistic probably also sees the 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.210
 quality in the broad and today too 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.940
 missing 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 that is to financially 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 possibilities than others 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.780
 the team think so very very good 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.540
 season plays in its possibilities 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.950
 will go quite to the maximum 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.800
 optimally this masterpiece that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:49.739
 is just difficult and departure 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:51.449
 I'm actually already satisfied ok 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.500
 short forward-looking or maybe 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:54.420
 again now on the last days 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.710
 back you better recovered or what 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.710
 already fully working on what the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:01.280
 planning for the new season is concerned 

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.400
 I have my second mobile off 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.240
 nothing with that 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:10.940
 gold now the team starts 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.540
 to look for a job again the cheap 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:16.430
 must be like last year and it does 

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.080
 I am very happy because we are from the 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:21.140
 team side, yes, really, everything is done 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.820
 to be successful and will if 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.070
 to come to the spectators 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.000
 I think we have ours 

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.700
 contributed 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.310
 So it's like you speak that 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.540
 possibly cut budget on so you 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.350
 have practical with next year 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:38.150
 manage less money 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.460
 ok come to the planning of the new one 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:41.300
 Seasonally how you plan the whole mainly 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.470
 maybe that one already 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.030
 small foresight on the 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.160
 foreigner positions dare again 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.050
 division as great as a defender 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.750
 three strikers or oysters and none 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:54.350
 We always need to think 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:57.460
 thoughts about his first thoughts 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:02.270
 if you lose the semi- final 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:03.890
 it is very difficult because of the 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:04.580
 Of course, claim is also somewhere 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.100
 gone up 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:09.110
 Rosenheim We now have three very good ones 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.240
 season played 

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.860
 and if you always have to change, you have to 

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.690
 not somewhere the good people can 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.180
 and therefore a little bit at the beginning 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:19.610
 frustrating 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.430
 okay maybe still behind 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.840
 I did not know pasi hakkinen 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:25.040
 What is it that a two year old 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.590
 Contract has stayed with us next year 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.540
 receive 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.730
 So there's nothing critical about it 

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:33.350
 So you do not know anything about it 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:36.800
 a part remained that way now 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.780
 let's wait and see also budget planning hobby 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.959
 to provide money like colitis 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:47.959
 There I have the money somewhere parties 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:49.670
 must save save you about is 

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:52.700
 basically like any player here 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.740
 Doing a good job has the piece 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.960
 continue forward into the defense 

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.640
 dominik and beppo frank stay with us 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.070
 received with the two young max renners 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.780
 offers from dr 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:07.580
 What is the trend? 

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 we are leaving our trainers 

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.810
 confident that he stays one 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.930
 Another one will be sure 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.620
 leave in the hall where or what 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:19.820
 had to talk market itself what not 

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.240
 okay and then one and the last question 

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:24.320
 in the storm we have already with us 

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.000
 roads and acosta are already three 

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.680
 There are players there 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.240
 other cornerstones with which you are stuck 

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:33.710
 plans or maybe a firm commitment 

00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:36.650
 also have to take my specials 

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.470
 from ronja or not that knows now 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.690
 As I said they have a lot of data 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.540
 is considered of course I have to go all 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:47.000
 market like him with the players 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.710
 continued to work but it would be to the 

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.960
 form not be possible 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.670
 who the last question, how 's this year? 

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:54.110
 the summer training how long now 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:55.610
 pause were now on because you have you 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:58.360
 always under his guidance 

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:58.360
 expire 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:02.510
 I have to have the team for the 

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.160
 takes care of summer training and then comes 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:06.290
 to deal with the topic 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.620
 But basically you can see in the mine with the 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:08.620
 start the test
