00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.550
 Y 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.060
 and to talk about a good barbecue 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.520
 first thing we're going to talk about is 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:30.700
 good meats like a beautiful tip of 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:30.700
 haunch 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.980
 leg center 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.680
 cortez also preferred by all 

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.680
 people the beef tenderloin 

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.190
 another one of the cuts that we like a lot 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.300
 for the roast for his grace and for his 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:53.280
 flavor are the flat ones another favorite cut 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.770
 for the roasts is 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.110
 the boy our first 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:00.539
 recommendation for the asados ​​is the 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.899
 heat you can use a 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.000
 coal or gas grill in this case 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.630
 let's use the gas the first 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.210
 recommendation is the heat 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.350
 when you put your hand in front of 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.420
 your grill and reject that is the point 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:20.659
 to put his meat aside has 

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.490
 developed two cuts one that is the 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:28.200
 famous baby beef 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:32.220
 or the beef medallion and the flat 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:34.490
 the famous churrasco has worked 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:38.520
 is simply the cut of the flat 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:43.550
 open with the grease towards 11 this is 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:47.300
 a bife chorizo the same churrasco 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:49.910
 but without opening my recommendations for 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.790
 the roasts when you use meat with 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.330
 enough fat is the first thing that goes to 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:58.790
 put on the grill 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:02.030
 and when we make cuts 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.659
 like the tip of anca in court of 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:08.500
 swords first 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:11.319
 open tip anca fat cut 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:14.500
 butterfly or anything like we told you 

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.690
 put the roast point so we're going to 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.110
 find in the juices that we from the 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:19.110
 meat 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.690
 ah 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:33.660
 Gentlemen, you do not have to meat 

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:35.730
 they are raising their juices depending on the 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.090
 point that you want to do what 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.040
 they leave more or less dark at this time 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.140
 we have a red color that means 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.140
 that meat is on average 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:57.260
 as you will see we have pork with their 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.710
 different cuts and the accompaniments 

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.630
 in this case different for a roast 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:07.650
 potatoes cooked in aluminum foil in the 

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:11.310
 grilled onion grilled paprika 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:14.220
 grilled tomato on the grill and to the 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:16.950
 end we will finish with a delicious 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:21.170
 pineapple that was grilled and a 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:21.170
 sugar candy with rum 

00:03:26.159 --> 00:03:31.900
 in the making of our dessert to the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.500

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.240
 pineapple we remove the heart we leave 

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.660
 more closed 

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:44.010
 in rum sugar and cinnamon powder 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:46.560
 then we take it to the grill 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:52.010

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:52.010
