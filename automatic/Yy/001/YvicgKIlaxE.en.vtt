to the middle strand from the left side
on<00:00:47.070> deck<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.670> will<00:00:48.300> direct<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.930> great<00:00:49.200> to<00:00:49.469> avoid

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
on deck I will direct the great to avoid

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.040 
on deck I will direct the great to avoid
my<00:00:49.890> neck<00:00:50.129> repeating<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.969> following<00:00:51.420> steps<00:00:51.750> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
my neck repeating the following steps I

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
on one it's in the middle now I place

the bottom strand over the middle one

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:00.709 
the bottom strand over the middle one
this<00:00:59.370> way<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.609> becomes<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.210> new<00:01:00.329> needs<00:01:00.570> of

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
this way it becomes the new needs of

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.020 
this way it becomes the new needs of
strands<00:01:01.109> then<00:01:01.859> I<00:01:01.890> section<00:01:02.340> some<00:01:02.520> hair<00:01:02.820> from

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.929 

then<00:01:09.810> again<00:01:10.140> the<00:01:10.590> top<00:01:10.799> strand<00:01:11.159> goes<00:01:11.400> over<00:01:11.880> the
