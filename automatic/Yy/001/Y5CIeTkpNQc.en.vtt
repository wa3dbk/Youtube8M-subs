 with smart tv or enem 65 h 19 mil 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.830
 samsung brought together for the first time the 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.760
 two most popular TV technologies 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.580
 time 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:26.689
 the ultra HD resolution is also known 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:30.470
 like 4k and the curved screen 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:35.040
 videos in 4k has a resolution of 

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:37.170
 3,840 by 2160 pixels which means 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.930
 a definition four times greater than 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:42.329
 full hd content 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 images display sharpness contrast 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.180
 and lush colors 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.620
 besides not missing any detail the 4k 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.760
 also improves the sensation of 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:53.399
 depth 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.239
 The problem is that there are no movies in 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:59.219
 4k in stores tv broadcasts in 4k 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:01.890
 like some of the world cup games 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.100
 shown by the net are still in stage 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.790
 one of the few options for 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.810
 watch videos on 4k is netflix bring in 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.450
 your collection 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.869
 titles such as house of cards and breaking 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:19.439
 bed the full hd pictures of the movies in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.920
 blu ray on hd from open tv are adapted 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:24.990
 to the 4k screen in a process called 

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:27.060
 upscaling on this tv from samsung 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:29.430
 the picture is not as spectacular as it is 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:32.040
 in four cars but the result is 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:36.540
 very good even better than the one seen in 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.290
 other tvs four cars no n 65 to 9 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.259
 thousand 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.549
 all the quality of the ultra hd standard 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:44.189
 displayed on a curved screen 

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:45.780
 in practice the curvature of the display does not 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.220
 has a great impact on the experience of 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.380
 viewer 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.990
 the biggest advantage is the reduction of 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.540
 reflections on the panel an advantage 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.560
 The contoured curved screen is its design 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.469
 it's funky 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.409
 she turns tv into a party of 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:04.079
 decoration so as not to spoil the look of 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.460
 All your TV connections went to 

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:08.099
 this external module 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.849
 the an connect that is connected to the screen by 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.849
 a single wire 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.800
 the smart hang that the low platform 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.110
 tv from samsung is with a visual 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:21.480
 different but even with the help of a 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.130
 quad-core processor often 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.640
 interface does not respond with agility 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.640
 expected 

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:32.459
 navigation is done with this control of the 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:34.739
 pointing stick 

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:38.280
 plus known functions and apps 

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:40.920
 this 4k model has the multilink mode 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:43.140
 screen that serves to place side to 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:48.080
 side the TV signal and some 

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:48.080
 applications such as youtube and the browser 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:58.319
 not in soccer does the tv take the sound 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.080
 stadium environment to record the game in a 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.730
 and also inserts markers in the 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.350
 moments when the mass screams louder 

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:06.600
 like in the goals 

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:10.670
 The bad thing is that it also applies an adjustment 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.670
 too saturating the color
