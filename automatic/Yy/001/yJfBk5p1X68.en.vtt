00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
maybe two micro terrors who knows that

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.139 
maybe two micro terrors who knows that
might<00:01:01.469> sound<00:01:01.649> pretty<00:01:01.859> cool<00:01:02.100> but<00:01:02.789> what<00:01:02.940> we're

it<00:01:04.650> into<00:01:04.769> old<00:01:05.010> faithful<00:01:05.549> so<00:01:05.880> we<00:01:06.360> are<00:01:06.570> running

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
it into old faithful so we are running

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.310 
it into old faithful so we are running
through<00:01:07.229> a<00:01:07.260> better<00:01:07.580> to<00:01:08.580> from<00:01:09.030> 16<00:01:09.600> right<00:01:09.960> so

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
through a better to from 16 right so

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:11.480 
through a better to from 16 right so
what<00:01:10.500> we've<00:01:10.590> got<00:01:10.619> is<00:01:10.799> we've<00:01:10.920> got<00:01:11.040> effects

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
what we've got is we've got effects

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.730 
what we've got is we've got effects
chain<00:01:11.790> works<00:01:12.150> like<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.540> normal<00:01:13.110> effects<00:01:13.409> chain

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
chain works like a normal effects chain

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.249 
chain works like a normal effects chain
would<00:01:14.220> so<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:15.090> can<00:01:15.240> scroll<00:01:15.479> left<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.020> right

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
would so we can scroll left and right

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.080 
would so we can scroll left and right
through<00:01:16.560> it<00:01:16.710> currently<00:01:17.670> we've<00:01:17.820> got<00:01:18.000> about

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
through it currently we've got about

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.690 
through it currently we've got about
five<00:01:18.570> effects<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.619> chain<00:01:19.920> can<00:01:20.189> happen<00:01:20.520> to

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
five effects in the chain can happen to

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.690 
five effects in the chain can happen to
wait<00:01:20.880> and<00:01:21.210> and<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.229> can<00:01:22.439> run<00:01:22.650> any<00:01:22.979> eighth<00:01:23.460> in

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
wait and and you can run any eighth in

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.920 
wait and and you can run any eighth in
any<00:01:23.850> order<00:01:24.090> so<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> can<00:01:24.659> have<00:01:24.750> any

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
any order so you can have any

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.200 
any order so you can have any
distortions<00:01:25.680> you<00:01:25.860> could<00:01:25.979> have<00:01:26.100> a<00:01:26.310> delays<00:01:26.729> blah

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
distortions you could have a delays blah

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.450 
distortions you could have a delays blah
blah<00:01:27.390> blah<00:01:27.420> got<00:01:27.960> revenge<00:01:28.439> modulation<00:01:29.009> effects

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
blah blah got revenge modulation effects

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.240 
blah blah got revenge modulation effects
sample<00:01:30.420> is<00:01:30.570> since<00:01:30.930> those<00:01:31.530> are<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.829> in<00:01:32.040> there

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
sample is since those are all in there

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.359 
sample is since those are all in there
47<00:01:32.820> and<00:01:33.329> we've<00:01:33.659> got<00:01:33.840> 8<00:01:34.049> amps<00:01:34.409> so<00:01:35.159> we're<00:01:35.280> going

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
47 and we've got 8 amps so we're going

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.679 
47 and we've got 8 amps so we're going
to<00:01:35.460> do<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.700> we're<00:01:35.880> going<00:01:36.000> to<00:01:36.060> play<00:01:36.390> a<00:01:36.420> clean

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
to do is we're going to play a clean

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.540 
to do is we're going to play a clean
tone<00:01:37.020> which<00:01:37.439> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.860> my<00:01:38.009> amp<00:01:38.250> tone

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:40.550 
tone which is just my amp tone

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.580 

so<00:01:41.550> that's<00:01:41.760> our<00:01:41.940> naked<00:01:42.450> control<00:01:42.930> track<00:01:43.290> and

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
so that's our naked control track and

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:44.960 
so that's our naked control track and
then<00:01:44.040> we're<00:01:44.130> going<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.310> go<00:01:44.370> to<00:01:44.400> the<00:01:44.580> front<00:01:44.790> of

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
then we're going to go to the front of

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.540 
then we're going to go to the front of
our<00:01:45.090> chain<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:45.690> put<00:01:46.380> on<00:01:46.560> our<00:01:46.830> distortion

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
our chain and put on our distortion

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:50.870 
our chain and put on our distortion
pedal<00:01:47.850> see<00:01:48.270> what<00:01:48.420> that<00:01:48.540> sounds<00:01:48.870> like<00:01:49.880> and

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
we've got a copy of a pro called rat in

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.820 
we've got a copy of a pro called rat in
there<00:01:53.610> which<00:01:54.120> is<00:01:54.300> called<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.720> squeak<00:01:55.110> app<00:01:55.320> so

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:55.830 
there which is called the squeak app so

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:07.440 
there which is called the squeak app so
let's<00:01:56.070> see<00:01:56.220> what<00:01:56.250> that<00:01:56.520> sounds<00:01:56.910> like<00:01:56.970> off
