00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
options we've got three different times

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.850 
options we've got three different times
or<00:01:59.950> our<00:02:00.160> rides<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:01.780> three<00:02:02.020> rides<00:02:02.260> and<00:02:02.680> we<00:02:02.710> have

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
or our rides the three rides and we have

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.130 
or our rides the three rides and we have
three<00:02:03.160> spent<00:02:03.460> set<00:02:03.730> times<00:02:03.970> and<00:02:04.510> across<00:02:04.900> the<00:02:05.110> top

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:05.140 
three spent set times and across the top

three spent set times and across the top
we<00:02:05.440> have<00:02:05.560> four<00:02:06.040> different<00:02:06.400> options<00:02:06.550> so<00:02:07.420> each

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
we have four different options so each

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.139 
we have four different options so each
of<00:02:07.780> these<00:02:07.870> options<00:02:08.320> will<00:02:09.100> give<00:02:09.310> us<00:02:09.490> the<00:02:09.850> same

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
of these options will give us the same

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:17.220 
of these options will give us the same
three<00:02:10.420> rides<00:02:10.660> at<00:02:11.050> different<00:02:12.040> times<00:02:16.230> so
