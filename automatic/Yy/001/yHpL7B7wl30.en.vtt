00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.480 
what's up guys my name is ace and today

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:04.999 
what's up guys my name is ace and today
I<00:00:03.510> have<00:00:03.689> another<00:00:03.899> great<00:00:04.200> drill<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.770> you<00:00:04.830> guys

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
I have another great drill for you guys

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.889 
I have another great drill for you guys
and<00:00:05.250> this<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.640> designed<00:00:06.120> to<00:00:06.240> significantly

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:06.899 
and this is designed to significantly

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:08.600 
and this is designed to significantly
improve<00:00:07.319> your<00:00:07.350> reaction<00:00:07.919> time<00:00:08.099> in<00:00:08.309> a<00:00:08.400> gunfight

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
improve your reaction time in a gunfight

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.430 
improve your reaction time in a gunfight
let's<00:00:09.570> get<00:00:09.780> into<00:00:09.990> it

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:15.440 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.990 

okay<00:00:16.440> so<00:00:16.500> the<00:00:16.740> entire<00:00:16.980> purpose<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.550> this<00:00:17.760> drill

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
okay so the entire purpose of this drill

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.880 
okay so the entire purpose of this drill
is<00:00:18.180> to<00:00:18.270> develop<00:00:18.840> a<00:00:18.930> neural<00:00:19.230> pathway<00:00:19.680> that

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
is to develop a neural pathway that

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:21.439 
is to develop a neural pathway that
allows<00:00:19.949> you<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.340> instantly<00:00:20.880> react<00:00:21.240> to<00:00:21.420> a

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
allows you to instantly react to a

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.090 
allows you to instantly react to a
gunfight<00:00:21.720> without<00:00:22.350> even<00:00:22.619> consciously

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
gunfight without even consciously

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:25.250 
gunfight without even consciously
thinking<00:00:23.550> about<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.970> this<00:00:24.750> means<00:00:25.019> we're

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
thinking about it this means we're

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.929 
thinking about it this means we're
essentially<00:00:25.680> trying<00:00:26.010> to<00:00:26.130> eliminate<00:00:26.369> the<00:00:26.699> step

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
essentially trying to eliminate the step

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:28.519 
essentially trying to eliminate the step
between<00:00:27.150> your<00:00:27.539> brain<00:00:27.720> recognizing<00:00:28.439> that

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
between your brain recognizing that

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:30.470 
between your brain recognizing that
there's<00:00:28.740> an<00:00:28.830> enemy<00:00:28.980> on<00:00:29.220> your<00:00:29.369> screen<00:00:29.730> and<00:00:29.939> your

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
there's an enemy on your screen and your

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
there's an enemy on your screen and your
thumbs<00:00:30.810> or<00:00:31.109> in<00:00:31.349> the<00:00:31.439> case<00:00:31.590> of<00:00:31.740> a<00:00:31.800> PC<00:00:32.219> user<00:00:32.430> your

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
thumbs or in the case of a PC user your

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.700 
thumbs or in the case of a PC user your
fingers<00:00:33.149> making<00:00:33.660> the<00:00:33.899> movements<00:00:34.350> to<00:00:34.469> react<00:00:34.680> to

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
fingers making the movements to react to

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.220 
fingers making the movements to react to
that<00:00:35.030> with<00:00:36.030> enough<00:00:36.300> practice<00:00:36.809> you'll<00:00:37.020> begin

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
that with enough practice you'll begin

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.990 
that with enough practice you'll begin
to<00:00:37.290> notice<00:00:37.380> that<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.829> automatically<00:00:38.430> lock<00:00:38.760> on

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
to notice that you automatically lock on

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.060 
to notice that you automatically lock on
and<00:00:39.239> start<00:00:39.480> firing<00:00:39.750> at<00:00:39.989> an<00:00:40.079> enemy<00:00:40.260> without

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
and start firing at an enemy without

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130 
and start firing at an enemy without
actually<00:00:41.520> thinking<00:00:41.550> to<00:00:42.059> yourself<00:00:42.450> there<00:00:42.989> is

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
actually thinking to yourself there is

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
actually thinking to yourself there is
an<00:00:43.230> enemy<00:00:43.530> there<00:00:43.770> now<00:00:44.250> move<00:00:44.520> your<00:00:44.670> thumbs<00:00:44.910> and

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
an enemy there now move your thumbs and

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
an enemy there now move your thumbs and
kill<00:00:45.450> him<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:46.440> is<00:00:46.620> just<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:46.950> to<00:00:47.039> happen<00:00:47.190> on

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
kill him this is just going to happen on

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.130 
kill him this is just going to happen on
its<00:00:47.670> own<00:00:47.820> and<00:00:48.059> therefore<00:00:48.600> at<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> much<00:00:49.110> faster

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
its own and therefore at a much faster

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.130 
its own and therefore at a much faster
pace<00:00:50.090> so<00:00:51.090> to<00:00:51.180> set<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.480> drill<00:00:51.719> up<00:00:51.840> we're<00:00:52.020> going

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
pace so to set this drill up we're going

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.080 
pace so to set this drill up we're going
to<00:00:52.230> go<00:00:52.350> into<00:00:52.559> a<00:00:52.590> private<00:00:53.010> match<00:00:53.160> select<00:00:53.969> a

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
to go into a private match select a

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.850 
to go into a private match select a
small<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.629> medium<00:00:54.930> sized<00:00:55.140> map<00:00:55.440> that<00:00:55.710> has

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
small to medium sized map that has

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.889 
small to medium sized map that has
somewhat<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.520> a<00:00:56.610> round<00:00:56.879> shape<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.539> rather

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
somewhat of a round shape to it rather

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.170 
somewhat of a round shape to it rather
than<00:00:58.140> more<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.469> linear<00:00:58.770> shape<00:00:59.100> and<00:00:59.340> I<00:01:00.000> like

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
than more of a linear shape and I like

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:02.150 
than more of a linear shape and I like
to<00:01:00.300> use<00:01:00.420> strike<00:01:00.780> zone<00:01:01.050> or<00:01:01.289> Warhawk<00:01:01.890> or

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
to use strike zone or Warhawk or

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.579 
to use strike zone or Warhawk or
something<00:01:02.640> similar<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.969> that<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:04.320> reason

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
something similar to that and the reason

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.320 
something similar to that and the reason
for<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.799> roundish<00:01:05.189> type<00:01:05.489> map<00:01:05.790> is<00:01:06.030> we're

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
for the roundish type map is we're

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:07.580 
for the roundish type map is we're
basically<00:01:06.420> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.930> be<00:01:07.020> running<00:01:07.320> laps

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
basically going to be running laps

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.590 
basically going to be running laps
around<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.100> map<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.520> these<00:01:08.850> maps<00:01:09.090> work<00:01:09.330> best

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
around the map and these maps work best

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.420 
around the map and these maps work best
for<00:01:09.750> that<00:01:09.990> but<00:01:10.409> we'll<00:01:10.590> get<00:01:10.680> into<00:01:10.830> that<00:01:10.950> in<00:01:11.280> a

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
for that but we'll get into that in a

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.460 
for that but we'll get into that in a
bit<00:01:11.600> for<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.689> game<00:01:12.869> mode<00:01:13.080> we<00:01:13.320> want

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:13.470 
bit for the game mode we want

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
bit for the game mode we want
free-for-all<00:01:14.070> and<00:01:14.310> next<00:01:14.850> we're<00:01:14.939> going<00:01:15.030> to<00:01:15.090> go

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
free-for-all and next we're going to go

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.120 
free-for-all and next we're going to go
into<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.540> game<00:01:15.720> options<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.380> set<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.890> score

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:17.130 
into the game options and set the score

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.249 
into the game options and set the score
limit<00:01:17.460> to<00:01:17.640> unlimited<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.600> time<00:01:18.810> limit<00:01:19.110> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
limit to unlimited and the time limit to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:21.020 
limit to unlimited and the time limit to
whatever<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.860> want<00:01:20.100> but<00:01:20.369> I<00:01:20.400> recommend<00:01:20.790> doing

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
whatever you want but I recommend doing

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.780 
whatever you want but I recommend doing
at<00:01:21.299> least<00:01:21.330> 10<00:01:21.930> minutes<00:01:22.170> and<00:01:22.530> the<00:01:23.369> longer<00:01:23.670> you

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
at least 10 minutes and the longer you

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.160 
at least 10 minutes and the longer you
do<00:01:23.939> it<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.090> better<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> results<00:01:24.990> will<00:01:25.140> be

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
do it the better the results will be

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.260 
do it the better the results will be
since<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.979> any<00:01:26.220> drill<00:01:26.520> this<00:01:26.759> is<00:01:26.909> all<00:01:27.119> about

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
since like any drill this is all about

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.080 
since like any drill this is all about
repetition<00:01:28.400> so<00:01:29.400> now<00:01:29.520> we're<00:01:29.640> going<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.790> go<00:01:29.909> down

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
repetition so now we're going to go down

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.760 
repetition so now we're going to go down
to<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.360> gameplay<00:01:30.720> options<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.409> enable

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
to the gameplay options and enable

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.499 
to the gameplay options and enable
hardcore<00:01:32.369> mode<00:01:32.670> and<00:01:32.939> then<00:01:33.240> we're<00:01:33.360> going<00:01:33.479> to

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
hardcore mode and then we're going to

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.340 
hardcore mode and then we're going to
disable<00:01:33.869> kill<00:01:34.290> streaks<00:01:34.619> and<00:01:34.799> field<00:01:35.369> orders

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
disable kill streaks and field orders

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.359 
disable kill streaks and field orders
next<00:01:37.350> we're<00:01:37.470> going<00:01:37.560> to<00:01:37.619> go<00:01:37.710> back<00:01:37.890> up<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.250> the

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
next we're going to go back up to the

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:40.100 
next we're going to go back up to the
team<00:01:38.549> options<00:01:39.000> and<00:01:39.180> it's<00:01:39.450> really<00:01:39.689> important

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
team options and it's really important

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:41.359 
team options and it's really important
that<00:01:40.140> you<00:01:40.290> set<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.619> gameplay<00:01:40.950> options

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
that you set your gameplay options

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:42.740 
that you set your gameplay options
before<00:01:41.520> this<00:01:41.939> because<00:01:42.420> when<00:01:42.570> you<00:01:42.630> turn

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
before this because when you turn

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.810 
before this because when you turn
hardcore<00:01:43.259> mode<00:01:43.439> on<00:01:43.680> it<00:01:43.950> will<00:01:44.100> automatically

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
hardcore mode on it will automatically

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.670 
hardcore mode on it will automatically
add<00:01:44.970> a<00:01:45.000> respawn<00:01:45.570> delay<00:01:45.899> which<00:01:46.140> we<00:01:46.320> don't<00:01:46.530> want

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
add a respawn delay which we don't want

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.760 
add a respawn delay which we don't want
so<00:01:47.009> we<00:01:47.220> want<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.460> set<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.759> to<00:01:48.000> none<00:01:48.619> moving<00:01:49.619> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
so we want to set that to none moving on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.859 
so we want to set that to none moving on
we're<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.220> set<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.460> seven<00:01:50.880> bots<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:51.420> I

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
we're going to set up seven bots and I

we're going to set up seven bots and I

you<00:03:11.190> want<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.430> force<00:03:11.700> yourself<00:03:11.850> to<00:03:12.209> aim<00:03:12.330> down

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
you want to force yourself to aim down

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.270 
you want to force yourself to aim down
sight<00:03:12.810> because<00:03:13.170> it's<00:03:13.350> almost<00:03:13.500> always<00:03:13.890> a<00:03:14.160> good

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
sight because it's almost always a good

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.100 
sight because it's almost always a good
habit<00:03:14.790> to<00:03:14.819> aim<00:03:15.030> down<00:03:15.060> sight<00:03:15.450> at<00:03:15.569> your<00:03:15.690> target

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
habit to aim down sight at your target

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:18.050 
habit to aim down sight at your target
and<00:03:16.260> your<00:03:16.860> training<00:03:17.100> for<00:03:17.310> muscle<00:03:17.610> memory<00:03:17.880> with

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
and your training for muscle memory with

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:19.849 
and your training for muscle memory with
this<00:03:18.209> so<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.870> don't<00:03:19.140> want<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.380> develop<00:03:19.739> the

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:19.859 
this so you don't want to develop the

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:21.770 
this so you don't want to develop the
bad<00:03:20.040> habit<00:03:20.489> of<00:03:20.609> firing<00:03:21.030> from<00:03:21.269> the<00:03:21.329> hip<00:03:21.450> in

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:21.780 
bad habit of firing from the hip in

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:25.099 
bad habit of firing from the hip in
every<00:03:22.140> single<00:03:22.470> situation<00:03:23.209> so<00:03:24.209> honestly<00:03:24.720> the

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:25.109 
every single situation so honestly the

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:26.810 
every single situation so honestly the
drill<00:03:25.350> is<00:03:25.470> that<00:03:25.650> simple<00:03:26.160> just<00:03:26.459> keep<00:03:26.670> doing

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:26.820 
drill is that simple just keep doing

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.060 
drill is that simple just keep doing
laps<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.450> racking<00:03:27.810> up<00:03:27.900> the<00:03:28.019> kills<00:03:28.260> and<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
laps and racking up the kills and the

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.250 
laps and racking up the kills and the
goal<00:03:29.250> is<00:03:29.280> simply<00:03:29.760> to<00:03:29.940> develop<00:03:30.090> a<00:03:30.390> rhythm<00:03:30.600> so

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:31.260 
goal is simply to develop a rhythm so

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:33.140 
goal is simply to develop a rhythm so
that<00:03:31.440> your<00:03:31.560> brain<00:03:31.739> can<00:03:32.010> fall<00:03:32.400> sort<00:03:32.790> of<00:03:32.880> into<00:03:33.120> a

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
that your brain can fall sort of into a

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:34.940 
that your brain can fall sort of into a
trance-like<00:03:33.660> state<00:03:34.109> where<00:03:34.470> it<00:03:34.560> begins<00:03:34.769> to

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
trance-like state where it begins to

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.800 
trance-like state where it begins to
react<00:03:35.190> naturally<00:03:35.790> to<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.060> situation<00:03:36.630> of

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
react naturally to the situation of

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.960 
react naturally to the situation of
seeing<00:03:37.200> an<00:03:37.290> enemy<00:03:37.440> on<00:03:37.680> the<00:03:37.799> screen<00:03:38.130> and<00:03:38.370> you

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
seeing an enemy on the screen and you

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.580 
seeing an enemy on the screen and you
don't<00:03:39.180> have<00:03:39.299> to<00:03:39.450> think<00:03:39.600> about<00:03:39.750> it<00:03:40.049> anymore<00:03:40.260> if

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:40.590 
don't have to think about it anymore if

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:43.160 
don't have to think about it anymore if
you<00:03:41.459> die<00:03:41.670> don't<00:03:42.239> worry<00:03:42.540> about<00:03:42.690> it<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:42.959> keep

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
you die don't worry about it just keep

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:45.229 
you die don't worry about it just keep
moving<00:03:43.680> and<00:03:43.799> consider<00:03:44.370> changing<00:03:44.790> direction

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
moving and consider changing direction

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.300 
moving and consider changing direction
every<00:03:45.570> couple<00:03:45.810> of<00:03:45.900> laps<00:03:46.140> to<00:03:46.470> sort<00:03:46.829> of<00:03:46.920> mix<00:03:47.190> up

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
every couple of laps to sort of mix up

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:48.949 
every couple of laps to sort of mix up
the<00:03:47.430> situations<00:03:48.000> that<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.180> find<00:03:48.450> yourself<00:03:48.540> in

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
the situations that you find yourself in

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.039 
the situations that you find yourself in
if<00:03:49.190> you're<00:03:50.190> dying<00:03:50.400> often<00:03:50.700> I<00:03:51.030> highly<00:03:51.570> recommend

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
if you're dying often I highly recommend

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.960 
if you're dying often I highly recommend
lowering<00:03:52.709> the<00:03:53.010> skill<00:03:53.250> level<00:03:53.519> of<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:53.760> bots

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:53.970 
lowering the skill level of the bots

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:55.880 
lowering the skill level of the bots
until<00:03:54.450> you<00:03:54.540> can<00:03:54.690> confidently<00:03:55.140> develop<00:03:55.769> a

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
until you can confidently develop a

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.160 
until you can confidently develop a
rhythm<00:03:56.070> so<00:03:57.030> now<00:03:57.150> it's<00:03:57.329> time<00:03:57.480> to<00:03:57.630> explain<00:03:57.959> my

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
rhythm so now it's time to explain my

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.690 
rhythm so now it's time to explain my
reasoning<00:03:58.650> for<00:03:58.829> everything<00:03:59.280> in<00:03:59.370> the<00:03:59.459> drill

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
reasoning for everything in the drill

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.280 
reasoning for everything in the drill
because<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.030> often<00:04:00.299> get<00:04:00.600> questioned<00:04:01.079> about

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
because I often get questioned about

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.250 
because I often get questioned about
some<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.769> the<00:04:01.829> aspects<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.430> my<00:04:02.640> drills<00:04:03.260> so

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
some of the aspects of my drills so

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.410 
some of the aspects of my drills so
first<00:04:04.530> why<00:04:04.950> all<00:04:05.190> the<00:04:05.310> sprinting<00:04:05.730> and<00:04:05.910> running

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
first why all the sprinting and running

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.900 
first why all the sprinting and running
laps<00:04:06.600> around<00:04:06.810> the<00:04:07.049> map<00:04:07.260> this<00:04:08.160> is<00:04:08.340> to<00:04:08.459> maximize

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:08.910 
laps around the map this is to maximize

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:10.460 
laps around the map this is to maximize
the<00:04:09.060> number<00:04:09.090> of<00:04:09.329> gunfights<00:04:09.870> while<00:04:10.230> also

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
the number of gunfights while also

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:11.990 
the number of gunfights while also
ensuring<00:04:10.769> that<00:04:11.069> the<00:04:11.280> enemies<00:04:11.609> will<00:04:11.819> almost

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
ensuring that the enemies will almost

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:15.319 
ensuring that the enemies will almost
always<00:04:12.420> be<00:04:12.630> in<00:04:12.989> front<00:04:13.260> of<00:04:13.350> you<00:04:13.530> also<00:04:14.489> we<00:04:15.120> want

regular or hardened bots and wouldn't it

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:08.980 
regular or hardened bots and wouldn't it

you<00:05:36.000> way<00:05:36.270> too<00:05:36.330> much<00:05:36.630> time<00:05:36.930> to<00:05:37.170> react<00:05:37.500> and<00:05:37.800> this

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:38.340 
you way too much time to react and this

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:40.670 
you way too much time to react and this
is<00:05:38.460> why<00:05:38.580> we<00:05:38.760> want<00:05:38.940> regular<00:05:39.360> BOTS<00:05:39.570> or<00:05:39.870> if<00:05:40.500> we're

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
is why we want regular BOTS or if we're

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.350 
is why we want regular BOTS or if we're
feeling<00:05:40.980> like<00:05:41.130> regular<00:05:41.730> BOTS<00:05:41.910> are<00:05:42.120> way<00:05:42.300> too

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:42.360 
feeling like regular BOTS are way too

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.920 
feeling like regular BOTS are way too
easy<00:05:42.750> we<00:05:43.080> can<00:05:43.260> go<00:05:43.350> on<00:05:43.500> to<00:05:43.620> hardened<00:05:44.010> BOTS<00:05:44.780> so<00:05:45.780> if

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:45.930 
easy we can go on to hardened BOTS so if

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.360 
easy we can go on to hardened BOTS so if
you<00:05:46.020> guys<00:05:46.140> have<00:05:46.350> any<00:05:46.590> other<00:05:46.830> questions<00:05:47.280> about
