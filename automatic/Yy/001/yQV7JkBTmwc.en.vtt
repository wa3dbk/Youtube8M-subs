 Serranos like you who have

 tweeter in my university does not enter people 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.890
 as your color door with the use of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.540
 door color term you were revolting 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.550
 of people with Andean traits 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.890
 aggravated by the fact of you being a 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:22.470
 university student as you claim 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.020
 be that I should understand better than anyone 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.270
 like racism and sexism for your 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.550
 woman's condition has already done so much 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.010
 damage to our country replied the professor 

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:34.020
 hugo coya your messages show a 

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.120
 class disdain towards people 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.820
 of different economic conditions 

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:40.790
 which unfortunately are majority 

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.660
 in this country the professor continues 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.610
 remembering that the student also 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:47.369
 He defended beauty in advertising 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.070
 saga finally the teacher culminated the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.509
 missive with a cautionary message 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:53.280
 imagine how people will feel 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:54.660
 alluded to by your words and that have not 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.030
 had not even have yours 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.710
 possibilities in life I invite you to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.200
 turn that door color into a 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:02.670
 symbol for precisely break 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.110
 those doors that prevent us 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.110
 build a plural society
