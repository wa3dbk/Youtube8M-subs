really all you need to know are three
things<00:00:18.899> about<00:00:19.110> your<00:00:19.380> perceptions<00:00:19.950> first<00:00:20.669> of

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
things about your perceptions first of

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:23.060 
things about your perceptions first of
all<00:00:20.970> your<00:00:21.390> perceptions<00:00:21.960> are<00:00:22.200> filtered<00:00:22.919> by

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
all your perceptions are filtered by

all your perceptions are filtered by
which<00:00:23.250> you<00:00:23.430> see<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.790> world<00:00:23.820> you<00:00:24.480> don't<00:00:24.599> see

perceptions<00:00:30.540> are<00:00:30.750> powerful<00:00:31.439> they're<00:00:31.860> so

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
perceptions are powerful they're so

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:33.920 
perceptions are powerful they're so
powerful<00:00:32.340> they'll<00:00:32.820> prevent<00:00:33.270> you<00:00:33.450> from<00:00:33.480> seeing

the<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.320> in<00:00:34.500> front<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.830> you<00:00:35.010> and<00:00:35.220> finally

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:36.150 
the things in front of you and finally

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:38.390 
the things in front of you and finally
your<00:00:36.360> perceptions<00:00:36.930> don't<00:00:37.290> change<00:00:37.680> unless<00:00:37.980> a

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:38.400 
your perceptions don't change unless a

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.690 
your perceptions don't change unless a
significant<00:00:39.360> event<00:00:39.510> occurs<00:00:40.080> well<00:00:41.040> today<00:00:41.640> is

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
significant event occurs well today is

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.400 
significant event occurs well today is
going<00:00:41.910> to<00:00:42.000> be<00:00:42.120> a<00:00:42.150> significant<00:00:42.810> event<00:00:43.050> for<00:00:43.110> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
going to be a significant event for you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.010 
going to be a significant event for you
so<00:00:44.100> let's<00:00:44.310> talk<00:00:44.640> about<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:45.210> process<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:45.840> how

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
so let's talk about the process by how

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.069 
so let's talk about the process by how
our<00:00:46.170> mind<00:00:46.410> works<00:00:46.670> when<00:00:47.670> we<00:00:47.820> went<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.210> school<00:00:48.570> we

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
our mind works when we went to school we

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.020 
our mind works when we went to school we
learned<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.560> certain<00:00:49.800> shapes<00:00:50.220> had<00:00:50.550> a<00:00:50.579> sound

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
learned that certain shapes had a sound

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.600 
learned that certain shapes had a sound
and<00:00:51.360> a<00:00:51.420> meaning<00:00:51.780> you<00:00:52.020> learn<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.350> letter<00:00:52.590> A<00:00:52.800> had

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
and a meaning you learn the letter A had

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.080 
and a meaning you learn the letter A had
a<00:00:53.640> sound<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.360> or<00:00:54.750> aa<00:00:54.930> we<00:00:55.800> memorize<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.670> shape

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
a sound a or aa we memorize that shape

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.660 
a sound a or aa we memorize that shape
and<00:00:57.329> then<00:00:57.390> every<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.290> we<00:00:58.500> saw<00:00:58.800> it<00:00:58.829> we<00:00:59.430> didn't

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
and then every time we saw it we didn't

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.580 
and then every time we saw it we didn't
have<00:00:59.820> to<00:00:59.970> relearn<00:01:00.329> that's<00:01:00.870> the<00:01:01.079> way<00:01:01.200> our<00:01:01.320> mind

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
have to relearn that's the way our mind

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.579 
have to relearn that's the way our mind
works<00:01:01.710> as<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:03.149> went<00:01:03.360> through<00:01:03.480> school<00:01:03.989> we

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
works as we went through school we

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
works as we went through school we
learned<00:01:04.829> that<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.070> particular<00:01:05.369> shape<00:01:05.970> could

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
learned that that particular shape could

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
learned that that particular shape could
have<00:01:06.420> a<00:01:06.450> different<00:01:06.780> look<00:01:07.200> about<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.530> or<00:01:07.800> a

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
have a different look about it or a

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.980 
have a different look about it or a
different<00:01:08.220> font<00:01:08.520> we<00:01:08.790> learned<00:01:09.000> script<00:01:09.600> we

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
different font we learned script we

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.050 
different font we learned script we
learn<00:01:10.140> different<00:01:10.560> things<00:01:10.770> about<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.100> but<00:01:11.820> once

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
learn different things about it but once

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.540 
learn different things about it but once
we<00:01:12.270> learned<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.780> we<00:01:13.200> stopped<00:01:13.560> seeing<00:01:14.010> it

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:14.550 
we learned it we stopped seeing it

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.030 
we learned it we stopped seeing it
well<00:01:15.000> this<00:01:15.630> occurs<00:01:16.020> with<00:01:16.229> everything<00:01:16.800> around

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
well this occurs with everything around

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.880 
well this occurs with everything around
us<00:01:17.310> we<00:01:18.000> stop<00:01:18.360> seeing<00:01:18.810> things<00:01:19.140> it's<00:01:19.470> placed

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
us we stop seeing things it's placed

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.890 
us we stop seeing things it's placed
into<00:01:20.250> our<00:01:20.280> mind<00:01:20.640> into<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.210> pattern<00:01:21.630> of

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
into our mind into a pattern of

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.190 
into our mind into a pattern of
perception<00:01:22.500> and<00:01:22.650> then<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.250> forget<00:01:23.580> about<00:01:23.700> it

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200 
perception and then we forget about it

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.360 
perception and then we forget about it
today<00:01:25.200> what<00:01:25.380> we're<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.620> to<00:01:25.650> be<00:01:25.799> looking<00:01:25.979> at

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:26.370 
today what we're going to be looking at

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.880 
today what we're going to be looking at
is<00:01:26.640> how<00:01:27.210> we<00:01:27.420> can<00:01:27.600> get<00:01:27.900> around<00:01:27.990> the<00:01:28.590> way<00:01:28.740> our

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
is how we can get around the way our

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:34.830 
is how we can get around the way our
mind<00:01:29.130> works

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:34.840 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.510 

all<00:01:35.840> right<00:01:35.960> now<00:01:36.110> I<00:01:36.140> want<00:01:36.469> to<00:01:36.560> draw<00:01:36.710> this<00:01:37.100> entire

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
all right now I want to draw this entire

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:39.520 
all right now I want to draw this entire
chair<00:01:37.909> I<00:01:38.149> can<00:01:38.420> do<00:01:38.509> it<00:01:38.659> by<00:01:38.780> using<00:01:38.840> that<00:01:39.289> one

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:39.530 
chair I can do it by using that one

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.800 
chair I can do it by using that one
measurement<00:01:40.219> the<00:01:40.729> way<00:01:40.850> I<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.360> it<00:01:41.390> I'm<00:01:41.630> going<00:01:41.750> to

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
measurement the way I do it I'm going to

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.929 
measurement the way I do it I'm going to
show<00:01:41.869> you<00:01:41.899> two<00:01:42.229> ways<00:01:42.259> this<00:01:43.159> particular<00:01:43.789> item

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:43.939 
show you two ways this particular item

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:45.399 
show you two ways this particular item
is<00:01:44.240> the<00:01:44.360> proportional<00:01:44.899> divider<00:01:44.990> and<00:01:45.350> I

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
is the proportional divider and I

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.410 
is the proportional divider and I
mentioned<00:01:45.740> it<00:01:45.799> earlier<00:01:46.009> and<00:01:46.579> the<00:01:47.000> way<00:01:47.149> it

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
mentioned it earlier and the way it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.539 
mentioned it earlier and the way it
works<00:01:47.689> is<00:01:48.049> that<00:01:48.110> you<00:01:48.350> select<00:01:48.770> anything<00:01:49.340> on

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
works is that you select anything on

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.760 
works is that you select anything on
your<00:01:49.700> piece<00:01:49.909> of<00:01:50.060> paper<00:01:50.270> on<00:01:50.570> your<00:01:51.170> your

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
your piece of paper on your your

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.240 
your piece of paper on your your
reference<00:01:52.159> photo<00:01:52.429> and<00:01:52.759> you<00:01:53.299> measure<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.869> and

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
reference photo and you measure it and

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.380 
reference photo and you measure it and
then<00:01:55.250> you<00:01:55.399> take<00:01:55.640> the<00:01:55.850> line<00:01:56.060> that<00:01:56.270> you've

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
then you take the line that you've

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.929 
then you take the line that you've
already<00:01:56.569> drawn<00:01:56.990> and<00:01:57.439> you<00:01:58.009> look<00:01:58.640> up<00:01:58.729> there

00:01:58.929 --> 00:01:58.939 
already drawn and you look up there

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:01.719 
already drawn and you look up there
every<00:01:59.360> so<00:01:59.539> often<00:01:59.750> I<00:02:00.020> do<00:02:00.079> this<00:02:00.319> right<00:02:00.590> okay<00:02:01.130> you

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
every so often I do this right okay you

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.270 
every so often I do this right okay you
measure<00:02:02.030> it<00:02:02.240> and<00:02:02.390> it's<00:02:02.780> now<00:02:03.079> matching<00:02:03.829> now<00:02:04.009> if

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
measure it and it's now matching now if

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.069 
measure it and it's now matching now if
it<00:02:04.520> isn't<00:02:04.700> matching<00:02:05.030> I'll<00:02:05.360> slide<00:02:05.689> this<00:02:05.899> back

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
it isn't matching I'll slide this back

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:08.800 
it isn't matching I'll slide this back
and<00:02:06.289> forth<00:02:06.380> until<00:02:06.770> it<00:02:07.039> does<00:02:07.280> now<00:02:08.149> once<00:02:08.569> I<00:02:08.780> have

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
and forth until it does now once I have

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.289 
and forth until it does now once I have
set<00:02:09.229> this<00:02:09.470> from<00:02:09.950> here<00:02:10.250> to<00:02:10.340> here<00:02:10.700> is<00:02:10.849> the<00:02:11.269> same

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
set this from here to here is the same

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:14.170 
set this from here to here is the same
as<00:02:11.750> from<00:02:11.930> here<00:02:12.230> to<00:02:12.349> here<00:02:12.769> anything<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:13.849> measure

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
as from here to here anything I measure

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:16.720 
as from here to here anything I measure
on<00:02:14.540> this<00:02:14.870> particular<00:02:15.440> chair<00:02:15.769> I<00:02:16.040> can<00:02:16.280> measure

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
on this particular chair I can measure

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.850 
on this particular chair I can measure
with<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.120> proportional<00:02:17.690> divider<00:02:17.810> so<00:02:18.680> for

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
with the proportional divider so for

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.910 
with the proportional divider so for
example<00:02:19.370> how<00:02:19.849> long<00:02:19.910> is<00:02:20.510> that<00:02:20.569> leg<00:02:21.230> well<00:02:21.620> it

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
example how long is that leg well it

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.199 
example how long is that leg well it
goes<00:02:22.130> from<00:02:22.430> there

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
goes from there

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:28.569 
goes from there
to<00:02:23.780> down<00:02:23.959> there<00:02:24.230> or<00:02:24.880> it's<00:02:25.880> going<00:02:26.239> to<00:02:26.360> be<00:02:27.579> that

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
to down there or it's going to be that

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:32.289 
to down there or it's going to be that
long<00:02:28.790> okay<00:02:29.360> so<00:02:29.900> there's<00:02:30.140> my<00:02:30.349> chair<00:02:30.590> leg<00:02:31.299> now

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
long okay so there's my chair leg now

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.479 
long okay so there's my chair leg now
why<00:02:32.599> does<00:02:32.840> that<00:02:32.870> chair<00:02:33.349> that<00:02:33.950> part<00:02:34.310> of<00:02:34.430> the

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
why does that chair that part of the

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:37.870 
why does that chair that part of the
chair<00:02:34.790> well<00:02:35.690> it's<00:02:36.049> that<00:02:36.440> white<00:02:36.680> so<00:02:37.250> I'll<00:02:37.549> just

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
chair well it's that white so I'll just

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.690 
chair well it's that white so I'll just
go<00:02:38.630> right<00:02:38.870> here<00:02:39.260> and<00:02:39.290> all<00:02:40.040> right<00:02:40.250> now<00:02:40.459> I've<00:02:40.549> got

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:40.700 
go right here and all right now I've got

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:50.020 
go right here and all right now I've got
the<00:02:40.880> width<00:02:41.090> and<00:02:41.560> I<00:02:42.560> go<00:02:42.950> down<00:02:43.160> this<00:02:44.030> far<00:02:49.030> here

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
the width and I go down this far here

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.970 
the width and I go down this far here
from<00:02:50.359> here<00:02:50.569> to<00:02:50.630> here<00:02:51.049> at<00:02:51.290> this<00:02:51.500> point<00:02:51.739> right

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:51.980 
from here to here at this point right

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.970 
from here to here at this point right
here<00:02:52.040> I<00:02:52.609> have<00:02:53.180> the<00:02:53.660> start<00:02:54.019> of<00:02:54.230> this<00:02:54.620> shape

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
here I have the start of this shape

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.599 
here I have the start of this shape
going<00:02:55.220> across<00:02:55.489> here<00:02:57.280> now<00:02:58.280> I'm<00:02:58.370> going<00:02:58.549> to

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
going across here now I'm going to

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:00.610 
going across here now I'm going to
switch<00:02:58.760> to<00:02:58.910> another<00:02:59.239> item<00:02:59.840> that<00:03:00.049> I<00:03:00.230> would<00:03:00.440> use

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
switch to another item that I would use

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.800 
switch to another item that I would use
in<00:03:00.829> addition<00:03:01.100> to<00:03:01.370> this<00:03:01.519> and<00:03:01.819> that<00:03:02.359> is<00:03:02.540> I<00:03:02.690> would

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
in addition to this and that is I would

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.160 
in addition to this and that is I would
use<00:03:02.840> a<00:03:03.019> ruler<00:03:03.560> not<00:03:04.430> as<00:03:04.730> I'm<00:03:05.030> measuring<00:03:05.780> but<00:03:05.989> as

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:06.170 
use a ruler not as I'm measuring but as

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:08.530 
use a ruler not as I'm measuring but as
a<00:03:06.200> straight<00:03:06.769> edge<00:03:06.980> because<00:03:07.670> if<00:03:08.030> you<00:03:08.329> start

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:08.540 
a straight edge because if you start

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.720 
a straight edge because if you start
getting<00:03:08.810> angles<00:03:09.200> that<00:03:09.319> changes<00:03:09.769> things<00:03:10.010> if<00:03:10.549> I

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
getting angles that changes things if I

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.340 
getting angles that changes things if I
place<00:03:10.970> the<00:03:11.209> ruler<00:03:11.569> and<00:03:11.750> I'm<00:03:11.870> going<00:03:11.989> to<00:03:12.049> use<00:03:12.200> the

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:12.350 
place the ruler and I'm going to use the

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:14.140 
place the ruler and I'm going to use the
edge<00:03:12.530> of<00:03:12.829> this<00:03:12.980> piece<00:03:13.220> of<00:03:13.250> paper<00:03:13.400> right<00:03:13.700> here

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
edge of this piece of paper right here

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.470 
edge of this piece of paper right here
and<00:03:14.359> I<00:03:14.870> place<00:03:15.170> it<00:03:15.200> like<00:03:15.530> this<00:03:15.590> and<00:03:16.220> I<00:03:16.850> look<00:03:17.180> at

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
and I place it like this and I look at

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.610 
and I place it like this and I look at
the<00:03:18.049> location<00:03:18.829> of<00:03:18.889> this<00:03:19.069> arm<00:03:19.370> right<00:03:20.620> here

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
the location of this arm right here

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.789 
the location of this arm right here
notice<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.579> the<00:03:22.730> arm<00:03:22.910> is<00:03:23.150> not<00:03:23.209> level<00:03:23.840> okay

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
notice that the arm is not level okay

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:28.629 
notice that the arm is not level okay
it's<00:03:25.040> going<00:03:25.569> slightly<00:03:26.569> down<00:03:27.380> so<00:03:28.190> that<00:03:28.370> means

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:28.639 
it's going slightly down so that means

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:30.490 
it's going slightly down so that means
in<00:03:28.849> order<00:03:28.970> to<00:03:29.120> do<00:03:29.359> get<00:03:29.510> this<00:03:29.660> next<00:03:30.019> shape<00:03:30.260> right

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
in order to do get this next shape right

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.349 
in order to do get this next shape right
I'm<00:03:30.709> gonna<00:03:30.829> have<00:03:31.069> to<00:03:31.220> take<00:03:31.430> it<00:03:31.579> at<00:03:31.790> a<00:03:31.970> slight

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:32.359 
I'm gonna have to take it at a slight

00:03:32.359 --> 00:03:34.930 
I'm gonna have to take it at a slight
downward<00:03:32.870> angle<00:03:33.200> so<00:03:34.190> I'll<00:03:34.280> just<00:03:34.459> put<00:03:34.609> that<00:03:34.669> in

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
downward angle so I'll just put that in

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.599 
downward angle so I'll just put that in
as<00:03:35.060> a<00:03:35.090> holding<00:03:35.599> place<00:03:35.799> okay<00:03:36.799> so<00:03:36.859> how<00:03:37.190> long<00:03:37.430> is

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
as a holding place okay so how long is

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:41.710 
as a holding place okay so how long is
that<00:03:37.639> well<00:03:38.150> it<00:03:38.389> sticks<00:03:39.079> out<00:03:39.639> about<00:03:40.639> that<00:03:41.359> far

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
that well it sticks out about that far

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:45.670 
that well it sticks out about that far
okay<00:03:42.620> so<00:03:43.430> it's<00:03:43.579> gonna<00:03:43.640> stick<00:03:44.000> out<00:03:44.150> about<00:03:44.680> that

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
okay so it's gonna stick out about that

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.339 
okay so it's gonna stick out about that
far

00:03:48.339 --> 00:03:48.349 

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:51.170 

so<00:03:49.349> now<00:03:49.560> I've<00:03:49.680> got<00:03:49.860> the<00:03:50.010> start<00:03:50.370> of<00:03:50.610> where<00:03:50.940> that

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
so now I've got the start of where that

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:58.449 
so now I've got the start of where that
arm<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.810> going<00:03:52.050> to<00:03:52.140> go<00:03:52.260> it's<00:03:52.830> going<00:03:53.040> to<00:03:53.099> go<00:03:53.190> back

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:04.240 

now<00:03:59.459> this<00:04:00.709> particular<00:04:01.709> pedal<00:04:02.640> right<00:04:03.329> here<00:04:03.930> is

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
now this particular pedal right here is

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.860 
now this particular pedal right here is
actually<00:04:05.250> up<00:04:05.400> in<00:04:05.579> here<00:04:06.030> and<00:04:06.209> this<00:04:06.360> is<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> cast

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
actually up in here and this is a cast

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.750 
actually up in here and this is a cast
shadow<00:04:07.110> so<00:04:08.099> now<00:04:08.220> that<00:04:08.280> I've<00:04:08.459> got<00:04:08.579> some

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
shadow so now that I've got some

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.539 
shadow so now that I've got some
graphite<00:04:09.329> on<00:04:09.659> that<00:04:09.959> paper<00:04:10.230> stump<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.980> can

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:11.549 
graphite on that paper stump I can

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:14.360 
graphite on that paper stump I can
actually<00:04:11.760> push<00:04:12.239> that<00:04:12.450> down<00:04:12.720> and<00:04:13.280> start<00:04:14.280> to

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:14.370 
actually push that down and start to

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:17.150 
actually push that down and start to
create<00:04:14.519> the<00:04:14.819> shadow<00:04:15.090> of<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.650> just<00:04:16.650> using<00:04:17.070> the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
create the shadow of it just using the

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.979 
create the shadow of it just using the
graphite<00:04:17.609> that<00:04:17.639> I<00:04:17.789> already<00:04:18.090> had<00:04:18.299> on<00:04:18.479> that<00:04:18.510> this

this<00:05:01.450> on<00:05:01.660> my<00:05:01.690> drawing<00:05:02.170> but<00:05:02.470> I<00:05:02.830> have<00:05:03.130> to<00:05:03.250> really

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:03.820 
this on my drawing but I have to really

this on my drawing but I have to really
look<00:05:04.000> to<00:05:04.210> see<00:05:04.420> it<00:05:04.510> over<00:05:04.660> there<00:05:04.960> so<00:05:05.920> if<00:05:06.190> it's<00:05:06.370> not

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580

dark<00:05:06.940> enough<00:05:07.120> I<00:05:07.630> can<00:05:07.930> adjust<00:05:08.320> it<00:05:08.470> because

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:08.590 
dark enough I can adjust it because

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.210 
dark enough I can adjust it because
that's<00:05:08.830> a<00:05:09.070> very<00:05:10.440> dark<00:05:11.440> shade<00:05:13.620> so<00:05:14.620> I'll<00:05:14.860> just

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:15.220 
that's a very dark shade so I'll just

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:20.190 
that's a very dark shade so I'll just
push<00:05:15.760> it<00:05:15.910> back<00:05:16.320> with<00:05:17.320> my<00:05:17.500> pencil<00:05:18.900> so<00:05:19.900> that<00:05:20.080> it's

00:05:20.190 --> 00:05:20.200 
push it back with my pencil so that it's

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:32.020 
push it back with my pencil so that it's
only<00:05:20.410> a<00:05:20.560> suggested<00:05:21.310> shape<00:05:22.710> blend<00:05:23.710> it

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.030 

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:35.380
