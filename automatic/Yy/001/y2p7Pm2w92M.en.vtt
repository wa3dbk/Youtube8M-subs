00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:13.679
 the one I have in my hand is a pair of 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:19.289
 triggers ie accessories that are used for 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:23.279
 to make flash and even flashes clear 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:27.180
 to trigger he always has the distance 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:31.940
 camera are produced by 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:35.660
 bild rocks and have some peculiarities 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:39.090
 the most important is the one that 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:43.219
 they work keep the i running 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:47.969
 flash to which they are connected in ttl 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:51.449
 also the various parameters that we 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:54.840
 we can set on the flash we can 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:56.520
 set directly from the machine 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.219
 photographic 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:03.870
 in this way all the flashes connected 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.830
 in ttl through the system this system 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:10.049
 of uiltucs will work together ed 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:14.939
 they will dare according to our settings 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:17.880
 the light on the subjects these triggers do not 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.229
 they only serve to trigger a 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.150
 distance the flashes 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:24.540
 they are also used to trigger a 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:27.560
 distance to the camera 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.659
 so we can build a set 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.520
 totally remotely operable both for 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:38.299
 as for the shot both for what 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.700
 concerns the lighting of the flashes in the 

00:01:38.299 --> 00:01:46.710
 in the box in the package besides the 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:51.119
 two to the trigger pair we find one 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:54.030
 base that serves to position where 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.840
 we want and not exclusively on 

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:01.590
 camera one of the receivers 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:06.149
 and a series of cables that are used for 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:09.869
 connect the trigger to the machine 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:10.600
 photographic or even directly to the various 

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:14.140
 flash 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.980
 also to studio flashes 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:19.480
 let's see now more in details how 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:22.750
 they are made as this is done 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:26.080
 accessory that we remember can work 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:29.140
 in a practically unlimited number of 

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.290
 specimens not only in two that is the couple 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.970
 that we find in the package 

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:37.230
 we set the trigger has its own 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.770
 base so you can see it better 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:43.930
 this is the button you need for 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:49.810
 turn on the flashes or take the picture 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:53.590
 when we work in manual we have 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:59.350
 to the usual hot shoe on the 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.780
 We can put the flash and here 

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.470
 in front we have what we can 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:09.250
 call the control panel ie 

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:13.630
 power button and the switch of 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:17.100
 two channels c1 c2 and for each channel 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.240
 we can use three groups of flashes 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.360
 On the right side 

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:25.810
 we have two sockets this one indicated 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:30.790
 as a room it serves to connect through 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:34.660
 the cable the trigger to the camera in 

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:38.220
 this way we can crush 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.230
 this button we can start the 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.890
 the shutter and shoot or if the 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:46.240
 trigger has connected with other triggers 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:51.660
 even at a distance we can do 

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:56.580
 starting the shutter the power supply 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:04:00.550
 is given by two common stylus batteries 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:02.980
 below and triggers to the contacts that 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:05.200
 allow it to be inserted into the 

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:10.390
 usual hot contact of the machine 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:14.710
 photographic that we see the backstage here 

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:18.669
 of the set we set up for 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:22.870
 test the triggers in real conditions of 

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:25.139
 use and also the images we have 

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.139
 point
