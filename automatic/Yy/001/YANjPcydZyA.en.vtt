00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.000 
don't know world of war actually had
tanks<00:01:28.930> which<00:01:29.080> was<00:01:29.229> pretty<00:01:29.409> cool<00:01:29.530> one<00:01:29.860> of<00:01:29.950> the

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 
tanks which was pretty cool one of the

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:31.500 
tanks which was pretty cool one of the
cool<00:01:30.189> things<00:01:30.220> and<00:01:30.610> it<00:01:30.909> was<00:01:30.970> one<00:01:31.180> of<00:01:31.210> the<00:01:31.330> maps

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:31.510 
cool things and it was one of the maps

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:33.030 
cool things and it was one of the maps
that<00:01:31.659> actually<00:01:32.020> featured<00:01:32.439> those<00:01:32.590> tanks

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
that actually featured those tanks

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.219 
that actually featured those tanks
moving<00:01:33.549> on<00:01:33.700> to<00:01:33.880> our<00:01:34.030> number<00:01:34.390> nine<00:01:34.600> spot<00:01:34.630> we<00:01:35.080> got

00:01:35.219 --> 00:01:35.229 
moving on to our number nine spot we got

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.380 
moving on to our number nine spot we got
standoff<00:01:35.860> from<00:01:36.220> black<00:01:36.610> ops<00:01:36.880> 2<00:01:37.150> this<00:01:37.299> is

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
standoff from black ops 2 this is

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.520 
standoff from black ops 2 this is
actually<00:01:37.689> one<00:01:37.810> of<00:01:37.840> the<00:01:37.900> first<00:01:38.110> maps<00:01:38.380> I

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:38.530 
actually one of the first maps I

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.469 
actually one of the first maps I
actually<00:01:38.680> played<00:01:39.070> when<00:01:39.610> I<00:01:39.640> got<00:01:39.850> black<00:01:40.090> ops<00:01:40.240> 2

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:40.479 
actually played when I got black ops 2

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:42.000 
actually played when I got black ops 2
early<00:01:40.840> and<00:01:40.960> it's<00:01:41.110> actually<00:01:41.470> a<00:01:41.530> really<00:01:41.770> really

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
early and it's actually a really really

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.740 
early and it's actually a really really
well-made<00:01:42.490> map<00:01:42.790> I<00:01:43.030> think<00:01:43.299> it's<00:01:43.390> actually<00:01:43.510> one

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:43.750 
well-made map I think it's actually one

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:45.539 
well-made map I think it's actually one
of<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.869> best<00:01:44.170> received<00:01:44.590> maps<00:01:44.830> in<00:01:45.040> black<00:01:45.250> ops<00:01:45.430> 2

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
of the best received maps in black ops 2

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:48.179 
of the best received maps in black ops 2
along<00:01:45.909> with<00:01:46.090> raid<00:01:46.360> and<00:01:46.630> nuketown<00:01:47.229> but<00:01:47.979> it's

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:48.189 
along with raid and nuketown but it's

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.490 
along with raid and nuketown but it's
just<00:01:48.400> very<00:01:48.580> well<00:01:48.880> made<00:01:49.150> both<00:01:49.990> sides<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.380> the

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
just very well made both sides of the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.050 
just very well made both sides of the
map<00:01:50.680> there's<00:01:50.890> really<00:01:51.040> no<00:01:51.250> negative<00:01:51.700> side<00:01:51.909> to

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 
map there's really no negative side to

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:53.880 
map there's really no negative side to
be<00:01:52.210> on<00:01:52.240> in<00:01:52.479> this<00:01:52.630> map<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.020> got<00:01:53.170> great<00:01:53.470> sniping

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
be on in this map you got great sniping

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.859 
be on in this map you got great sniping
spots<00:01:54.130> on<00:01:54.280> both<00:01:54.430> sides<00:01:54.700> a<00:01:54.939> lot<00:01:55.360> of<00:01:55.479> action<00:01:55.780> on

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
spots on both sides a lot of action on

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.420 
spots on both sides a lot of action on
all<00:01:56.080> sides<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.470> the<00:01:56.560> map<00:01:56.680> and<00:01:56.860> really<00:01:57.070> I<00:01:57.100> can't

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
all sides of the map and really I can't

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.399 
all sides of the map and really I can't
even<00:01:57.520> think<00:01:57.670> of<00:01:58.060> one<00:01:58.570> bad<00:01:58.720> thing<00:01:58.780> that<00:01:59.049> was<00:01:59.290> on

00:01:59.399 --> 00:01:59.409 
even think of one bad thing that was on

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.770 
even think of one bad thing that was on
the<00:01:59.530> map<00:01:59.710> so<00:01:59.979> number<00:02:00.700> 9<00:02:00.880> spot<00:02:01.030> goes<00:02:01.329> to<00:02:01.360> stand

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
the map so number 9 spot goes to stand

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:03.810 
the map so number 9 spot goes to stand
off<00:02:01.960> another<00:02:02.200> really<00:02:02.560> awesome<00:02:02.979> map<00:02:03.189> when<00:02:03.729> we
