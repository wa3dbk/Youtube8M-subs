what<00:00:08.639> is<00:00:08.790> ESD<00:00:09.420> that's<00:00:10.260> probably<00:00:10.620> the<00:00:10.740> first

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
what is ESD that's probably the first

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.310 
what is ESD that's probably the first
question<00:00:11.400> I<00:00:11.460> get<00:00:11.639> asked<00:00:11.940> by<00:00:12.059> any<00:00:12.240> designer<00:00:13.049> or

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
question I get asked by any designer or

question I get asked by any designer or
architect<00:00:14.450> ESD<00:00:15.450> is<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.839> acronym<00:00:16.020> for

00:00:16.689 --> 00:00:16.699 
architect ESD is the acronym for

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:19.429 
architect ESD is the acronym for
electrostatic<00:00:17.699> discharge<00:00:18.210> essentially<00:00:19.199> what

electrostatic discharge essentially what

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:21.859 
electrostatic discharge essentially what
we're<00:00:19.560> talking<00:00:19.920> about<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:21.090> ability<00:00:21.510> for<00:00:21.539> a

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
we're talking about is the ability for a

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.439 
we're talking about is the ability for a
person<00:00:22.350> to<00:00:22.890> move<00:00:23.070> their<00:00:23.430> body<00:00:23.640> while<00:00:24.300> they

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
person to move their body while they

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.929 
person to move their body while they
walk<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:24.960> floor<00:00:25.609> generate<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.640> charge

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
walk on the floor generate a charge

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.210 
walk on the floor generate a charge
store<00:00:27.630> that<00:00:27.840> charge<00:00:28.170> and<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:28.949> they<00:00:29.039> actually

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
store that charge and when they actually

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.250 
store that charge and when they actually
release<00:00:29.849> that<00:00:30.090> charge<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.480> another<00:00:30.990> object

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
release that charge to another object

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.560 
release that charge to another object

electrostatic discharge takes place what
most<00:00:39.120> people<00:00:39.480> don't<00:00:39.660> realize<00:00:39.930> about<00:00:40.350> static

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
is that in order to feel a static

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.180 
is that in order to feel a static
discharge<00:00:45.239> you're<00:00:46.200> generating<00:00:46.649> close<00:00:46.980> to

to an adhesive underneath this tile so

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.490 
to an adhesive underneath this tile so
we<00:01:41.430> talked<00:01:41.670> about<00:01:41.820> ESD<00:01:42.479> flooring<00:01:42.960> we<00:01:43.259> could<00:01:43.409> be

we talked about ESD flooring we could be

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920 
we talked about ESD flooring we could be

talking about vinyl tile we could be

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.340 
talking about vinyl tile we could be

talking about carpet with carbon fibers

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
talking about carpet with carbon fibers
we<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.860> be<00:01:49.950> talking<00:01:50.220> about<00:01:50.630> special

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630 
we could be talking about special

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.960 
we could be talking about special

talking about rubber almost any form of
flooring<00:01:56.939> that<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> can<00:01:57.719> imagine<00:01:58.259> we<00:01:58.770> have<00:01:58.950> a

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
flooring that you can imagine we have a

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.490 
flooring that you can imagine we have a
way<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.520> render<00:02:00.119> it<00:02:00.240> into<00:02:00.600> a<00:02:00.780> static<00:02:01.290> free

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.260 
way to render it into a static free
floor<00:02:01.799> but<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.090> biggest

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
floor but really the biggest

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.810 
floor but really the biggest
consideration<00:02:04.110> is<00:02:04.500> safety<00:02:05.040> one<00:02:05.640> of<00:02:05.759> the

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
consideration is safety one of the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.199 
consideration is safety one of the
things<00:02:06.060> we've<00:02:06.270> discovered<00:02:06.719> in<00:02:07.020> our<00:02:07.530> audits<00:02:07.950> of

things we've discovered in our audits of
flooring<00:02:09.209> installations<00:02:09.899> is<00:02:10.080> a<00:02:10.349> lot<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.770> times

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
flooring installations is a lot of times
