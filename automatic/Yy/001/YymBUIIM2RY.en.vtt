00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:05.140
 the best papers for us of course for fortuna 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.170
 the entrepreneurs in the final round the haagse courant club 

00:00:09.699 --> 00:00:12.439
 chemist actually just promoted again played in the last year 

00:00:12.439 --> 00:00:13.899
 relegation pool 

00:00:13.899 --> 00:00:17.759
 but they managed to promote to the korfball league through the victory kvs 

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:20.560
 from scheveningen 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.550
 are positive news for fortuna 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:24.529
 joost training is back 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.759
 and also his sister monroes 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.079
 he has not played for nearly two years 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.550
 Chris Treling suffered from an infection and Marloes suffered from her knee 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.230
 a serious knee injury 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.740
 fortuna so again quite a strength 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.900
 but the lead is initially only one second up for nec 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:46.900
 47 play 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:49.770
 if it is michiel gerritsen 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.390
 at fortuna they have barry shovel it can also jump from a distance by the way 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.440
 together in the profession with marloes preuninger and the neys bezemer 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.020
 curiously because of that came the fortuna 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.979
 after a shot from barry shovel 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.979
 but he does count both teams back on the same level 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.520
 but the shooters at 9 we are in shape especially and michiel gerritsen 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:19.590
 green 2 and via this penalty throw the 3 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:25.600
 and the fortuna had imagined more of the initial phase of this 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.600
 matches so first match in the korfballeague 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.190
 and that should all lead to the grand finale in her home 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.340
 barry sharper for the 2 2 loss 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.170
 but always the backlog that fortuna left it or her in this 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.520
 contest 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.520
 2 4 for the team from Groningen Annelies Schuitema 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.810
 he must make sure that the backlog does not become too great this 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.640
 is marine ecological 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.020
 he used the penalty 3 to 4 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.149
 and I don't really know how to walk and fortuna doesn't touch 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:05.749
 the margin always fluctuates between one and two here becomes the respiratory tract 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:10.069
 3 against both suspects were left in the first half 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:13.969
 consciously I was ahead of him by twelve, so also for the public 

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.749
 but last year comes out well from the dressing room 

00:02:20.639 --> 00:02:23.639
 we have been told that they have to play a little further 

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:28.479
 now it is eleven twelve marrien ekelmans 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.679
 it is a third goal in this match 

00:02:31.679 --> 00:02:33.709
 not really loose yet 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.639
 but here it is 

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:39.119
 a beautiful point and then very important point 12 12 

00:02:39.119 --> 00:02:42.119
 the fourth of a commotion 

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.439
 and now fortuna must ensure that they can push through Marloes Fellinger's 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:48.459
 distance 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.279
 great point 

00:02:50.279 --> 00:02:53.279
 finally the lead for fortuna 13 12 

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:57.659
 and now it is important to hold it 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:01.249
 and not in the second half 

00:03:01.249 --> 00:03:04.459
 a lot more relaxed not sure than in the first half 

00:03:06.199 --> 00:03:09.319
 also the merit of fortuna this is precisely training with his first point 

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:11.849
 he doesn't look cheerful 

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:14.609
 what is 14 12 

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:17.609
 not yet scored in the second half 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.439
 this is perhaps indicative of fortuna secret second half 

00:03:22.999 --> 00:03:25.549
 further on the bar 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.729
 the wild all the balls go towards the attack the defense is better 

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:31.339
 then in the first half 

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:33.989
 the norwegian shooter has therefore completely come loose 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.650
 then it becomes fun 15 12 again marrien ekelmans l who ran interest margin and that is 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:43.309
 nice after a backlog 

00:03:43.309 --> 00:03:46.499
 and after seventeen minutes of play in the second half, finally another goal 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:47.659
 for nec 

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:50.909
 how could it be otherwise michiel verts it is its the sixth 

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.199
 the position is 20 15 

00:03:54.199 --> 00:03:57.009
 so the difference 5 

00:03:57.009 --> 00:04:00.009
 that's good for fortuna 

00:04:00.749 --> 00:04:02.449
 this is being saved 

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.289
 with the 20 16 

00:04:04.289 --> 00:04:07.359
 dimensions schedules of course but far that they made the goal for the 

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:08.199
 groningers 

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.219
 ignore them 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.219
 he is actually the only one with a clear focus 

00:04:14.749 --> 00:04:17.749
 who did the show of harlingen 20 17 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.439
 but the groningers are no longer dangerous 

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.439
 match in the pocket 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:29.479
 21 17 this can't go wrong anymore 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:34.680
 and fortuna does his first match did good business 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.219
 grab the full profit right away 

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:39.909
 here also becomes 21 18 

00:04:39.909 --> 00:04:42.909
 but the time is too short for the people of Groningen to do anything about it 

00:04:44.039 --> 00:04:47.309
 because of the victory also for the una 

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:50.479
 and actually a victory that is used to saying it might be the game 

00:04:50.479 --> 00:04:53.929
 in the first half could be improved the second half was fine 

00:04:53.929 --> 00:04:55.409
 21 18 is the result
