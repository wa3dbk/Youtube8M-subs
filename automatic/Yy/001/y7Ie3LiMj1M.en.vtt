00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.090 
the ass but I managed to use some tape
to<00:02:15.610> hold<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.270> strings<00:02:16.630> into<00:02:17.020> the<00:02:17.530> tail<00:02:17.770> piece

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.100 
to hold the strings into the tail piece

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:23.160 
to hold the strings into the tail piece
and<00:02:20.430> then<00:02:21.430> kind<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.910> worked<00:02:22.120> on<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.480> from<00:02:22.870> there

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
and then kind of worked on it from there

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:28.190 
and then kind of worked on it from there
but<00:02:23.470> it<00:02:23.590> was<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> pain<00:02:24.220> in<00:02:24.250> the<00:02:24.400> butt<00:02:25.440> the<00:02:26.730> saddle

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
but it was a pain in the butt the saddle

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.050 
but it was a pain in the butt the saddle
was<00:02:29.200> designed<00:02:29.680> for<00:02:30.010> the<00:02:30.099> strings<00:02:30.400> to<00:02:30.580> be<00:02:30.700> flat

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
was designed for the strings to be flat

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.229 
was designed for the strings to be flat
for<00:02:31.480> playing<00:02:31.780> slide<00:02:32.530> so<00:02:33.130> I<00:02:33.160> put<00:02:33.489> some<00:02:33.519> tin<00:02:34.000> foil

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
for playing slide so I put some tin foil

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:35.790 
for playing slide so I put some tin foil
underneath<00:02:34.660> the<00:02:34.900> grooves<00:02:35.170> of<00:02:35.470> the<00:02:35.500> middle

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
underneath the grooves of the middle

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:37.500 
underneath the grooves of the middle
ones<00:02:36.010> and<00:02:36.280> got<00:02:36.430> kind<00:02:36.700> of<00:02:36.760> an<00:02:36.880> arch<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.150> it

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
ones and got kind of an arch to it

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.110 
ones and got kind of an arch to it
because<00:02:37.720> I'm<00:02:37.840> not<00:02:37.989> real<00:02:38.200> good<00:02:38.470> at<00:02:38.530> slide<00:02:39.120> and

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
because I'm not real good at slide and

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:46.350 
because I'm not real good at slide and
didn't<00:02:40.450> want<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.840> thus<00:02:41.760> the<00:02:42.760> nut<00:02:43.110> was<00:02:45.360> look

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:46.360 
didn't want it thus the nut was look

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:48.030 
didn't want it thus the nut was look
like<00:02:46.540> it<00:02:46.690> was<00:02:46.780> done<00:02:46.989> kind<00:02:47.350> of<00:02:47.440> quick<00:02:47.680> it's<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
like it was done kind of quick it's a

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:49.949 
like it was done kind of quick it's a
nice<00:02:48.220> nut<00:02:48.610> it<00:02:48.819> just<00:02:49.030> wasn't<00:02:49.390> finished<00:02:49.750> night

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
nice nut it just wasn't finished night

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.160 
nice nut it just wasn't finished night
nicely<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:51.040> the<00:02:51.190> strings<00:02:52.090> weren't<00:02:52.690> flowing

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:53.170 
nicely and the strings weren't flowing

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.840 
nicely and the strings weren't flowing
through<00:02:53.380> the<00:02:53.470> groove<00:02:53.739> so<00:02:54.069> I<00:02:54.100> just<00:02:54.370> used<00:02:54.640> some

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:54.850 
through the groove so I just used some

00:02:54.850 --> 00:03:00.120 
through the groove so I just used some
nut<00:02:55.030> files<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.720> and<00:02:57.989> finished<00:02:58.989> it<00:02:59.200> out<00:02:59.350> opened

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
nut files and and finished it out opened

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:01.890 
nut files and and finished it out opened
them<00:03:00.280> up<00:03:00.400> a<00:03:00.549> bit<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:00.910> finished<00:03:01.269> him<00:03:01.420> out<00:03:01.569> so

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
them up a bit and finished him out so

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.240 
them up a bit and finished him out so
the<00:03:02.140> strings<00:03:02.590> can<00:03:02.980> slide<00:03:03.280> through<00:03:03.579> better

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
the strings can slide through better

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.460 
the strings can slide through better
it's<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.370> great<00:03:06.640> little<00:03:06.940> guitar<00:03:07.120> I<00:03:07.359> love<00:03:07.959> it
