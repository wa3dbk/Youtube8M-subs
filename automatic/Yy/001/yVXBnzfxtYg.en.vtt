Drive like that all the time oh no no
you<00:01:07.530> shouldn't<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.010> this<00:01:08.130> right<00:01:08.670> all<00:01:08.909> right

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
you shouldn't do this right all right

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.160 
you shouldn't do this right all right
now<00:01:09.150> we're<00:01:09.450> also<00:01:09.659> going<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> talk<00:01:10.049> about

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
now we're also going to talk about

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.750 
now we're also going to talk about
something<00:01:10.470> else<00:01:10.680> and<00:01:10.830> we'll<00:01:10.979> see<00:01:11.130> if<00:01:11.250> you<00:01:11.490> do

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
something else and we'll see if you do

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.789 
something else and we'll see if you do
this<00:01:11.970> one<00:01:12.180> okay<00:01:12.450> all<00:01:12.689> right<00:01:12.990> when<00:01:13.380> you're<00:01:13.530> when

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this one okay all right when you're when

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.320 
this one okay all right when you're when
you<00:01:13.920> watch<00:01:14.100> people<00:01:14.520> with<00:01:14.610> an<00:01:14.700> intersection

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
you watch people with an intersection

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:16.730 
you watch people with an intersection
how<00:01:15.420> do<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> sometimes<00:01:15.840> see<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.380> turn<00:01:16.590> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
how do you sometimes see them turn the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.130 
how do you sometimes see them turn the
steering<00:01:16.950> wheel<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.210> why<00:01:18.960> is<00:01:19.020> that

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
steering wheel like that and why is that

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.200 
steering wheel like that and why is that
probably<00:01:19.530> not<00:01:19.710> a<00:01:19.740> good<00:01:19.920> idea<00:01:19.979> because<00:01:20.939> the

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
probably not a good idea because the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.480 
probably not a good idea because the
steering<00:01:21.540> wheel<00:01:21.689> could<00:01:21.869> come<00:01:22.049> back<00:01:22.229> and<00:01:22.500> break

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
steering wheel could come back and break

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.670 
steering wheel could come back and break
your<00:01:23.670> arm<00:01:23.880> catch<00:01:24.390> your<00:01:24.600> own<00:01:24.630> but<00:01:25.110> if<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.439> if

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
your arm catch your own but if the if

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.620 
your arm catch your own but if the if
the<00:01:25.710> airbag<00:01:26.159> should<00:01:26.400> go<00:01:26.520> off<00:01:26.670> right<00:01:26.970> yeah<00:01:27.270> yeah

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the airbag should go off right yeah yeah

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.090 
the airbag should go off right yeah yeah
so<00:01:27.930> that's<00:01:28.140> that's<00:01:28.439> probably<00:01:28.799> not<00:01:28.950> a<00:01:29.009> good

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
so that's that's probably not a good

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:30.830 
so that's that's probably not a good
idea<00:01:29.250> to<00:01:29.640> do<00:01:29.759> it<00:01:29.790> that<00:01:30.060> way<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.270> what<00:01:30.540> we<00:01:30.659> want

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
idea to do it that way so what we want

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.990 
idea to do it that way so what we want
to<00:01:30.869> do<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.140> make<00:01:31.170> sure<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.650> we<00:01:32.340> that<00:01:32.700> we<00:01:32.729> use<00:01:32.970> a

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
to do is make sure that we that we use a

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.670 
to do is make sure that we that we use a
steering<00:01:33.450> wheel<00:01:33.509> properly<00:01:34.140> having<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.500> light

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
steering wheel properly having a light

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.130 
steering wheel properly having a light
touch<00:01:34.950> keeping<00:01:35.759> our<00:01:35.880> hands<00:01:36.119> usually<00:01:36.600> probably

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
touch keeping our hands usually probably

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.260 
touch keeping our hands usually probably
around<00:01:37.439> nine<00:01:38.100> and<00:01:38.430> three<00:01:38.610> o'clock<00:01:38.880> right

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
around nine and three o'clock right

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
around nine and three o'clock right
right<00:01:39.720> but<00:01:40.110> the<00:01:40.470> other<00:01:40.560> thing<00:01:40.710> that<00:01:40.920> people

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
right but the other thing that people

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.830 
right but the other thing that people
have<00:01:41.460> problems<00:01:41.759> with<00:01:42.119> in<00:01:42.329> the<00:01:42.420> winter<00:01:42.659> time

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
have problems with in the winter time

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.630 
have problems with in the winter time
especially<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.439> getting<00:01:43.649> the<00:01:43.740> car<00:01:43.920> stock<00:01:44.280> time

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
especially is getting the car stock time

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.789 
especially is getting the car stock time
right<00:01:45.030> so<00:01:45.540> that<00:01:45.869> means<00:01:46.110> what<00:01:46.290> we<00:01:46.320> want<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.680> make

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
right so that means what we want to make

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.249 
right so that means what we want to make
sure<00:01:46.829> we<00:01:47.130> use<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.460> brakes<00:01:47.700> effectively<00:01:48.450> right

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
sure we use the brakes effectively right

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.800 
sure we use the brakes effectively right
we<00:01:49.500> want<00:01:49.680> to<00:01:49.770> keep<00:01:49.890> our<00:01:50.040> heel<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.520> floor

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:50.810 
we want to keep our heel on the floor

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.359 
we want to keep our heel on the floor
mm-hmm<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.960> go<00:01:52.320> from<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> gas<00:01:52.829> pedal<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.340> the

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
mm-hmm and go from the gas pedal to the

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.789 
mm-hmm and go from the gas pedal to the
brake<00:01:53.700> and<00:01:53.939> rake<00:01:54.329> lightly<00:01:54.840> yeah<00:01:55.259> so<00:01:55.560> did<00:01:55.680> you

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799 
brake and rake lightly yeah so did you

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.010 
brake and rake lightly yeah so did you
break<00:01:56.040> lightly<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.270> that's<00:01:57.509> why<00:01:57.780> do<00:01:57.840> we

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
break lightly right and that's why do we

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.950 
break lightly right and that's why do we
want<00:01:58.170> to<00:01:58.290> do<00:01:58.409> that<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> we<00:01:59.909> keep<00:02:00.090> control<00:02:00.600> and

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
want to do that so we keep control and

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.499 
want to do that so we keep control and
to<00:02:01.140> keep<00:02:01.320> the<00:02:01.530> tires<00:02:02.430> gripping<00:02:02.939> around<00:02:03.240> right

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
to keep the tires gripping around right

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:04.999 
to keep the tires gripping around right
right<00:02:03.899> because<00:02:04.350> what<00:02:04.500> happens<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.950> people

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
right because what happens is people

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.370 
right because what happens is people
will<00:02:05.790> put<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> brakes<00:02:06.420> on<00:02:06.570> too<00:02:06.810> hard<00:02:07.049> and<00:02:07.290> even

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
will put the brakes on too hard and even

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.460 
will put the brakes on too hard and even
with<00:02:07.680> ABS<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.940> tire<00:02:09.390> will<00:02:09.599> skid<00:02:09.959> and<00:02:09.989> come<00:02:10.289> off

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
with ABS the tire will skid and come off

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.710 
with ABS the tire will skid and come off
skin<00:02:10.830> and<00:02:10.979> come<00:02:11.129> off<00:02:11.280> and<00:02:11.459> as<00:02:11.550> it<00:02:11.700> does<00:02:11.730> that

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
skin and come off and as it does that

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.360 
skin and come off and as it does that
you<00:02:12.810> don't<00:02:13.140> have<00:02:13.320> as<00:02:13.440> good<00:02:13.590> at<00:02:13.740> control<00:02:14.100> as<00:02:14.250> you

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:14.370 
you don't have as good at control as you

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:16.910 
you don't have as good at control as you
do<00:02:14.580> by<00:02:15.060> just<00:02:15.300> breaking<00:02:15.720> even<00:02:15.960> late<00:02:16.380> now<00:02:16.710> one<00:02:16.890> of

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
do by just breaking even late now one of

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.070 
do by just breaking even late now one of
the<00:02:17.040> things<00:02:17.100> that<00:02:17.340> we<00:02:17.550> as<00:02:17.850> I<00:02:18.150> know<00:02:18.690> Brenda

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
the things that we as I know Brenda

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.900 
the things that we as I know Brenda
you're<00:02:19.230> not<00:02:19.350> a<00:02:19.380> more<00:02:19.620> mature<00:02:19.800> driver<00:02:20.250> but<00:02:20.490> I<00:02:20.640> am

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
you're not a more mature driver but I am

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.180 
you're not a more mature driver but I am
and<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.270> my<00:02:21.900> parents<00:02:22.350> told<00:02:22.500> me<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.770> pump<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190 
and and my parents told me to pump the

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.360 
and and my parents told me to pump the
brakes<00:02:23.430> and<00:02:23.840> so<00:02:24.840> we<00:02:25.470> talked<00:02:25.770> about<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.220> out

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
brakes and so we talked about that out

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:27.890 
brakes and so we talked about that out
of<00:02:26.490> evil<00:02:26.760> run<00:02:26.880> and<00:02:27.030> we<00:02:27.090> say<00:02:27.270> that's<00:02:27.480> not<00:02:27.660> a<00:02:27.690> good

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
of evil run and we say that's not a good

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:30.200 
of evil run and we say that's not a good
idea<00:02:27.960> to<00:02:28.320> pump<00:02:28.560> the<00:02:28.680> brakes<00:02:28.920> because<00:02:29.370> what

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:30.210 
idea to pump the brakes because what

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:31.430 
idea to pump the brakes because what
happens<00:02:30.540> when<00:02:30.690> you're<00:02:30.810> pumping<00:02:31.110> the<00:02:31.230> brakes

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
happens when you're pumping the brakes

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.630 
happens when you're pumping the brakes
if<00:02:31.620> you<00:02:31.710> have<00:02:31.800> your<00:02:31.890> foot<00:02:32.070> off<00:02:32.160> the<00:02:32.310> brake<00:02:32.400> the

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:32.640 
if you have your foot off the brake the

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.640 
if you have your foot off the brake the
car<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.880> not<00:02:33.000> going<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.210> stop<00:02:33.330> all<00:02:34.080> right<00:02:34.230> right

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.560 
car is not going to stop all right right
so<00:02:35.100> we<00:02:35.310> want<00:02:35.490> to<00:02:35.520> keep<00:02:35.670> good<00:02:35.940> steady<00:02:36.300> pressure

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:36.570 
so we want to keep good steady pressure

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.030 
so we want to keep good steady pressure
on<00:02:36.810> the<00:02:36.930> brakes<00:02:37.140> as<00:02:37.320> we're<00:02:37.500> trying<00:02:37.710> to<00:02:37.800> stop

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
on the brakes as we're trying to stop

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
we in the wintertime and we've got this

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:49.190 
we in the wintertime and we've got this
steering<00:02:47.370> wheel<00:02:47.640> that<00:02:47.850> we<00:02:48.000> use<00:02:48.360> and<00:02:48.660> what<00:02:49.110> are

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
steering wheel that we use and what are

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:50.270 
steering wheel that we use and what are
one<00:02:49.320> of<00:02:49.440> the<00:02:49.500> things<00:02:49.709> that<00:02:49.830> we<00:02:49.920> talked<00:02:50.190> about

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
one of the things that we talked about

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.610 
one of the things that we talked about
is<00:02:50.550> very<00:02:50.790> important<00:02:51.300> in<00:02:51.420> driving<00:02:51.540> out<00:02:51.990> in<00:02:52.260> in

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
is very important in driving out in in

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.320 
is very important in driving out in in
the<00:02:52.830> winter<00:02:52.950> time<00:02:53.250> making<00:02:53.940> sure<00:02:54.060> that<00:02:54.270> you

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
the winter time making sure that you

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.090 
the winter time making sure that you
look<00:02:54.450> out<00:02:54.630> really<00:02:54.930> far<00:02:55.200> in<00:02:55.260> front<00:02:55.440> of<00:02:55.770> the<00:02:55.860> car

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100 
look out really far in front of the car

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:58.430 
look out really far in front of the car
and<00:02:56.280> not<00:02:56.430> just<00:02:56.700> down<00:02:57.060> at<00:02:57.240> your<00:02:57.360> wheel<00:02:57.570> yeah<00:02:58.140> and

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
and not just down at your wheel yeah and

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.290 
and not just down at your wheel yeah and
why<00:02:58.590> would<00:02:58.770> we<00:02:58.890> want<00:02:59.070> to<00:02:59.100> do<00:02:59.220> that<00:02:59.400> so<00:03:00.030> that<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
why would we want to do that so that you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:01.790 
why would we want to do that so that you
can<00:03:00.420> anticipate<00:03:00.690> things<00:03:01.200> before<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:01.770> happen

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:01.800 
can anticipate things before they happen

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:03.710 
can anticipate things before they happen
that's<00:03:02.430> right<00:03:02.670> you<00:03:02.850> can<00:03:03.000> see<00:03:03.180> farther<00:03:03.450> out<00:03:03.690> you
