 Here I bring you the chapter number 14 of 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.500
 your pixelar and this time we are with diego 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:17.480

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.070

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:22.910
 I would like to see some more things with 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:25.430
 him but it is not a principle we have come 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.480
 to see these pixelar that you have as you see 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.149
 it has a lot but good we're going to 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.340
 start here has a helmet from the 

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:33.739

 incredible pixelar 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.620
 this work is amazing and even though 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.630
 it looks a little weird because there is not 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.610
 enough colors of wool to 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.770
 translate it well but it looks really cool 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.770

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.540
 computer a mario mushroom here has 

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.390

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:06.320
 own bad pack also has it there in 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.659
 its a little more classic version without 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.610
 eyes and without things or simply be the 

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:12.700
 pacman also has here a 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.430

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:24.310
 one of its most pixels would say giants and 

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:26.829
 it's a kind of dragon really flip 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.000

 here a kind of donald duckling in 3-d 

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:41.110
 it's a little weird because it 's pretty 

00:01:39.069 --> 00:01:43.929
 wide but it looks really good and it's 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.520
 in the air it's really great and good 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.679
 I'm going to climb this pyramid that has 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.299
 made of iron blocks to see a 

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.700
 little better from here your pixelar 

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:53.380

 more detail and good look at the dragon that 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.159
 has done is incredible or it has been 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.049
 cured a lot is also that it is 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:06.880
 huge is one of the most pixels 

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.200
 great that I've seen so far is 

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:10.660
 that has currado until the zone of the 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.950
 dragon nails or be awesome me 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.769
 has attracted a lot of attention this 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:16.239
 pixel art and good from here you can see 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:19.060
 a little bit more all the pixel ar and 

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:19.900
 beige the monalisa from afar as 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.579

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.769

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.640
 a little bit is the 3d solar peak that 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.189
 has a kind of creepers with a 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:32.500
 elegant suit is pretty good what 

00:02:30.189 --> 00:02:35.110
 only one arm is missing because it has not 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.629
 finished building but really 

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:39.879
 It's pretty cool I've seen it in 

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:42.640
 a corner of when I played I started this 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:45.269
 character type that kripper with suit 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:48.459
 it's like a suit of those from the mafia of 

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.200
 I do not know if you follow the idea of ​​that suit there 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.840
 in super elegant design with a rose and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.780
 everything is really cool and good too 

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:58.959
 as I said you have a 3d derman that 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.120
 it's quite pretty big it's very 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.819
 well done and good when it comes out in xbox 

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.189
 you will see how it really is like 

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:08.409
 done equally is very very very very 

00:03:06.189 --> 00:03:10.420
 well and very worked it seems to me a great 

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:13.599
 pixelar in 3-d I'm going to show you a 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:15.129
 little bit more closely and good too 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:17.019
 it has been made as a kind of hands 

00:03:15.129 --> 00:03:18.939
 of colors around here that also call 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:21.069
 quite the attention in decorative plan 

00:03:18.939 --> 00:03:22.660
 very good or is an ice has some ideas 

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.280
 very good 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:26.230
 and good for you to see a little bit 

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:29.800
 linderman but good is incredibly 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.360
 giant as you see eh lenderman is not no 

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.400
 is that it is very difficult to build but 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:35.350
 if it takes a lot of work to calculate a 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.700
 little the distances of the legs and 

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:39.130
 all those things with the rest of the body 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.550
 and hey, he's really pretty cool 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:45.010
 He liked it very much and good about everything 

00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:46.870
 I would highlight the monalisa and the dragon 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.950
 in addition to these 3d pixels that 

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:49.810
 have also called me greatly the 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.670
 Attention but good has been a chapter 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.560
