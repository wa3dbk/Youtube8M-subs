ago talking about the frost changes and
they<00:02:07.500> were<00:02:07.560> pretty<00:02:07.649> interesting<00:02:08.369> from<00:02:09.270> all

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:09.480 
they were pretty interesting from all

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:11.840 
they were pretty interesting from all
the<00:02:09.600> stuff<00:02:09.810> that's<00:02:09.840> going<00:02:10.290> on<00:02:10.440> we<00:02:11.340> know<00:02:11.490> ice

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
the stuff that's going on we know ice

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.170 
the stuff that's going on we know ice
wave<00:02:12.150> extending<00:02:13.080> out<00:02:13.410> from

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:14.180 
wave extending out from

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:18.009 
wave extending out from
cone<00:02:14.500> in<00:02:15.500> front<00:02:15.890> of<00:02:16.069> frost<00:02:16.510> enemies<00:02:17.510> froze<00:02:17.840> in

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:18.019 
cone in front of frost enemies froze in

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:20.349 
cone in front of frost enemies froze in
mid<00:02:18.170> air<00:02:18.319> will<00:02:18.920> now<00:02:19.099> fall<00:02:19.459> and<00:02:19.819> potentially

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:20.359 
mid air will now fall and potentially

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:22.929 
mid air will now fall and potentially
smash<00:02:20.420> on<00:02:20.930> the<00:02:20.959> ground<00:02:21.290> kind<00:02:21.650> of<00:02:21.739> cool<00:02:21.939> enemies

00:02:22.929 --> 00:02:22.939 
smash on the ground kind of cool enemies

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:25.539 
smash on the ground kind of cool enemies
that<00:02:23.569> survive<00:02:23.989> avalanche<00:02:24.680> will<00:02:25.129> now<00:02:25.310> have

00:02:25.539 --> 00:02:25.549 
that survive avalanche will now have

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:27.429 
that survive avalanche will now have
their<00:02:25.700> armor<00:02:26.000> broken<00:02:26.510> making<00:02:27.319> them

00:02:27.429 --> 00:02:27.439 
their armor broken making them

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:29.470 
their armor broken making them
vulnerable<00:02:27.620> for<00:02:28.340> future<00:02:28.700> attacks<00:02:29.060> which<00:02:29.329> is

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
vulnerable for future attacks which is

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.509 
vulnerable for future attacks which is
awesome<00:02:29.719> I<00:02:30.109> think<00:02:30.140> that<00:02:30.500> that's<00:02:30.709> a<00:02:30.889> big<00:02:31.250> change

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
awesome I think that that's a big change

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:34.959 
awesome I think that that's a big change
avalanche<00:02:32.650> snow<00:02:33.650> globe<00:02:33.950> will<00:02:34.250> repel<00:02:34.670> enemies

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:34.969 
avalanche snow globe will repel enemies

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.770 
avalanche snow globe will repel enemies
at<00:02:35.870> step<00:02:36.230> inside<00:02:36.650> however<00:02:37.579> that's<00:02:38.120> kind<00:02:38.480> of<00:02:38.599> a

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
at step inside however that's kind of a

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:42.459 
at step inside however that's kind of a
making<00:02:39.349> the<00:02:39.469> current<00:02:39.950> augment<00:02:40.459> mod<00:02:41.469> useless

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:42.469 
making the current augment mod useless

00:02:42.469 --> 00:02:44.890 
making the current augment mod useless
so<00:02:42.859> there<00:02:43.250> hopefully<00:02:43.489> be<00:02:43.969> some<00:02:44.239> changes<00:02:44.750> in

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:44.900 
so there hopefully be some changes in

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.039 
so there hopefully be some changes in
the<00:02:44.989> augment<00:02:45.409> mod<00:02:45.730> freeze<00:02:46.730> can<00:02:47.450> hit<00:02:47.659> the<00:02:47.780> floor

00:02:48.039 --> 00:02:48.049 
the augment mod freeze can hit the floor

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.500 
the augment mod freeze can hit the floor
and<00:02:48.319> create<00:02:48.950> pockets<00:02:49.189> of<00:02:49.489> cold<00:02:49.730> slowing<00:02:50.180> enemy

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
and create pockets of cold slowing enemy

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:53.110 
and create pockets of cold slowing enemy
movement<00:02:50.870> and<00:02:51.019> frost<00:02:51.680> passive<00:02:52.250> will<00:02:52.849> give

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:53.120 
movement and frost passive will give

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:58.059 
movement and frost passive will give
enemies<00:02:53.989> chance<00:02:54.500> of<00:02:55.280> being<00:02:55.819> frozen<00:02:56.769> when<00:02:57.769> mail

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
enemies chance of being frozen when mail

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:00.190 
enemies chance of being frozen when mail
a<00:02:58.189> tactic<00:02:58.730> frost<00:02:59.150> which<00:02:59.599> is<00:02:59.750> kind<00:02:59.959> of<00:03:00.049> cool

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
a tactic frost which is kind of cool

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.530 
a tactic frost which is kind of cool
actually<00:03:00.500> so<00:03:01.010> like<00:03:01.430> I<00:03:01.459> said<00:03:01.609> before<00:03:01.849> in<00:03:02.450> the

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:02.540 
actually so like I said before in the

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:04.330 
actually so like I said before in the
past<00:03:02.750> video<00:03:03.139> let's<00:03:03.859> say<00:03:03.950> you've<00:03:04.129> got<00:03:04.310> a

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:04.340 
past video let's say you've got a

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:06.520 
past video let's say you've got a
low-key<00:03:04.579> out<00:03:04.849> and<00:03:05.150> you<00:03:05.239> disarm<00:03:05.719> now<00:03:06.349> you've

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
low-key out and you disarm now you've

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:08.229 
low-key out and you disarm now you've
got<00:03:06.709> all<00:03:06.859> male<00:03:07.099> attackers<00:03:07.549> and<00:03:07.909> if<00:03:07.969> they<00:03:08.060> come

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:08.239 
got all male attackers and if they come

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:09.819 
got all male attackers and if they come
out<00:03:08.389> to<00:03:08.540> frost<00:03:08.810> have<00:03:09.109> a<00:03:09.139> chance<00:03:09.349> to<00:03:09.469> be<00:03:09.530> frozen

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:09.829 
out to frost have a chance to be frozen

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:11.890 
out to frost have a chance to be frozen
you<00:03:10.489> can't<00:03:10.700> really<00:03:10.849> go<00:03:11.060> wrong<00:03:11.090> with<00:03:11.359> that<00:03:11.659> if

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:11.900 
you can't really go wrong with that if

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:13.509 
you can't really go wrong with that if
you're<00:03:12.049> thinking<00:03:12.200> tactic<00:03:12.889> wise<00:03:13.069> and<00:03:13.340> you<00:03:13.400> have

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
you're thinking tactic wise and you have

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:17.879 
you're thinking tactic wise and you have
the<00:03:13.700> correct<00:03:14.620> frames<00:03:15.620> together<00:03:16.219> in<00:03:16.849> a<00:03:16.909> group

00:03:17.879 --> 00:03:17.889 
the correct frames together in a group

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:21.339 
the correct frames together in a group
so<00:03:18.889> frosty<00:03:19.579> work<00:03:19.940> changes<00:03:20.359> yes<00:03:20.569> no<00:03:20.780> maybe<00:03:21.049> so

00:03:21.339 --> 00:03:21.349 
so frosty work changes yes no maybe so

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.009 
so frosty work changes yes no maybe so
don't<00:03:22.069> like<00:03:22.220> them<00:03:22.459> do<00:03:22.669> like<00:03:22.879> them<00:03:23.120> pinions

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
don't like them do like them pinions

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.550 
don't like them do like them pinions
then<00:03:25.010> we've<00:03:25.099> got<00:03:25.280> some<00:03:25.489> stuff<00:03:25.699> on<00:03:25.819> PvP<00:03:26.239> so<00:03:26.560> PvP

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
then we've got some stuff on PvP so PvP

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.099 
then we've got some stuff on PvP so PvP
players<00:03:27.919> they're<00:03:28.280> wondering<00:03:28.729> if<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.870> think

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:30.109 
players they're wondering if you think

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.520 
players they're wondering if you think
movement<00:03:30.560> is<00:03:30.739> too<00:03:31.040> fast<00:03:31.340> in<00:03:31.639> Conclave<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.530> are

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:33.530 
movement is too fast in Conclave and are

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:36.429 
movement is too fast in Conclave and are
you<00:03:33.859> excited<00:03:34.280> for<00:03:34.669> parkour<00:03:35.599> 2<00:03:35.810> point<00:03:36.079> 0<00:03:36.260> in

00:03:36.429 --> 00:03:36.439 
you excited for parkour 2 point 0 in

00:03:36.439 --> 00:03:40.000 
you excited for parkour 2 point 0 in
Conclave<00:03:37.389> I've<00:03:38.389> only<00:03:38.750> played<00:03:38.989> PvP<00:03:39.680> a<00:03:39.709> few

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:40.010 
Conclave I've only played PvP a few

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.520 
Conclave I've only played PvP a few
times<00:03:40.250> and<00:03:40.639> I<00:03:41.389> thought<00:03:41.659> the<00:03:41.900> movement<00:03:42.290> was

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.530 
times and I thought the movement was

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.860 
times and I thought the movement was
more<00:03:43.519> or<00:03:43.639> less<00:03:43.699> fine<00:03:44.180> I<00:03:44.209> mean<00:03:44.479> it's<00:03:44.689> really

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
more or less fine I mean it's really

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.869 
more or less fine I mean it's really
based<00:03:45.229> off<00:03:45.470> of<00:03:45.500> the<00:03:45.680> current<00:03:46.099> system<00:03:46.280> as<00:03:46.579> it<00:03:46.729> is

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:46.879 
based off of the current system as it is

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:51.219 
based off of the current system as it is
so<00:03:47.209> until<00:03:48.079> park<00:03:48.319> or<00:03:48.560> 2<00:03:48.739> point<00:03:49.009> 0<00:03:49.159> comes<00:03:49.400> in<00:03:50.229> it's

00:03:51.219 --> 00:03:51.229 
so until park or 2 point 0 comes in it's

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:53.740 
so until park or 2 point 0 comes in it's
gonna<00:03:51.379> be<00:03:51.500> kind<00:03:51.680> of<00:03:51.739> hard<00:03:51.919> to<00:03:52.009> say<00:03:52.280> is<00:03:52.750> it

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:53.750 
gonna be kind of hard to say is it

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.439 
gonna be kind of hard to say is it
working<00:03:53.989> correctly<00:03:54.680> in<00:03:55.129> PvP<00:03:55.699> or<00:03:55.729> not<00:03:56.060> i<00:03:56.239> think

00:03:56.439 --> 00:03:56.449 
working correctly in PvP or not i think

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:59.110 
working correctly in PvP or not i think
that's<00:03:56.750> that's<00:03:57.379> just<00:03:57.680> my<00:03:58.250> thought<00:03:58.519> I<00:03:58.699> mean<00:03:58.849> it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
that's that's just my thought I mean it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.749 
that's that's just my thought I mean it
I'm<00:03:59.419> excited<00:04:00.109> for<00:04:00.409> it<00:04:00.530> then<00:04:01.159> it<00:04:01.340> could<00:04:01.489> really

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:01.759 
I'm excited for it then it could really

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.420 
I'm excited for it then it could really
dynamically<00:04:02.419> change<00:04:02.870> everything<00:04:03.430> but

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
dynamically change everything but

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.280 
dynamically change everything but
nobody's<00:04:04.909> had<00:04:05.060> a<00:04:05.090> chance<00:04:05.329> to<00:04:05.509> play<00:04:05.659> it<00:04:05.870> yet<00:04:05.989> so

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.290 
nobody's had a chance to play it yet so

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:09.369 
nobody's had a chance to play it yet so
really<00:04:07.129> it's<00:04:07.489> hard<00:04:07.699> to<00:04:07.849> kind<00:04:08.000> of<00:04:08.120> say<00:04:08.269> yes<00:04:08.379> this

00:04:09.369 --> 00:04:09.379 
really it's hard to kind of say yes this
