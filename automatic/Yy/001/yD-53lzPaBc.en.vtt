00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
forward this really quickly this is

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.130 
forward this really quickly this is
unlike<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:19.979> standards<00:01:20.729> server<00:01:21.360> mission<00:01:21.869> file

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
unlike the standards server mission file

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.320 
unlike the standards server mission file
so<00:01:23.009> it's<00:01:23.220> not<00:01:23.340> gonna<00:01:23.490> be<00:01:23.549> like<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:24.000> on<00:01:24.150> every

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
so it's not gonna be like this on every

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.450 
so it's not gonna be like this on every
server<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.140> a<00:01:25.200> lot<00:01:25.380> of<00:01:25.409> servers<00:01:25.860> are<00:01:26.040> changing

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
server and a lot of servers are changing

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.749 
server and a lot of servers are changing
this<00:01:26.750> but<00:01:27.750> there<00:01:28.110> is<00:01:28.259> still<00:01:28.579> quite<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> few

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
this but there is still quite a few

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.170 
this but there is still quite a few
servers<00:01:30.240> I've<00:01:30.570> seen<00:01:30.840> that<00:01:31.579> with<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.640> traders

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
servers I've seen that with the traders

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020 
servers I've seen that with the traders
like<00:01:33.360> this<00:01:33.650> so<00:01:34.650> you'll<00:01:35.189> be<00:01:35.430> wanting<00:01:35.759> to<00:01:35.850> buy

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
like this so you'll be wanting to buy

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.710 
like this so you'll be wanting to buy
mg36<00:01:36.810> for<00:01:37.200> five<00:01:37.409> gold<00:01:37.770> if<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.790> if<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.390> figure

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
mg36 for five gold if you if you figure

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.679 
mg36 for five gold if you if you figure
out<00:01:39.750> that<00:01:40.140> it's<00:01:40.979> not<00:01:41.130> five<00:01:41.369> gold<00:01:41.700> anymore<00:01:41.909> then

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
out that it's not five gold anymore then

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.450 
out that it's not five gold anymore then
your<00:01:42.899> server<00:01:43.140> has<00:01:43.290> probably<00:01:43.560> been<00:01:43.710> changed<00:01:44.220> a

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
your server has probably been changed a

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:48.920 
your server has probably been changed a
lot<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.329> owners<00:01:45.659> have<00:01:45.899> picked<00:01:46.140> up<00:01:46.320> on<00:01:46.439> this<00:01:47.930> it

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
lot of owners have picked up on this it

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.109 
lot of owners have picked up on this it
is<00:01:49.110> quite<00:01:49.530> well<00:01:49.799> known<00:01:50.040> but<00:01:50.369> it<00:01:50.520> is<00:01:50.700> quite

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
is quite well known but it is quite

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.090 
is quite well known but it is quite
secretly<00:01:51.600> known<00:01:51.899> as<00:01:52.110> well<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.619> that<00:01:52.649> makes<00:01:52.950> any

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
secretly known as well if that makes any

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
secretly known as well if that makes any
sense<00:01:53.369> I<00:01:53.729> suppose<00:01:54.329> it<00:01:54.479> doesn't<00:01:54.659> but<00:01:54.930> then

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
sense I suppose it doesn't but then

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.870 
sense I suppose it doesn't but then
you'll<00:01:55.229> be<00:01:55.259> wanting<00:01:55.649> to<00:01:55.710> go<00:01:55.799> black<00:01:56.040> market<00:01:56.070> mo

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
every six 10 ounce gold you'll make in

one briefcase full and two tenants gulp

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.410 
one briefcase full and two tenants gulp
which<00:02:17.069> is<00:02:17.190> obviously<00:02:17.459> twelve<00:02:17.730> ten<00:02:17.940> ounce<00:02:18.120> gold

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420

which is obviously twelve ten ounce gold
I<00:02:18.690> don't<00:02:19.080> know<00:02:19.349> what<00:02:19.560> it's<00:02:19.680> like<00:02:19.739> on<00:02:20.010> the<00:02:20.069> coin

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
I don't know what it's like on the coin

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.000 
I don't know what it's like on the coin
servers<00:02:21.330> whether<00:02:21.720> they<00:02:21.930> fix<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.440> they

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
servers whether they fix this they

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:24.949 
servers whether they fix this they
probably<00:02:23.280> have<00:02:23.580> CCG<00:02:24.209> of<00:02:24.300> the<00:02:24.420> only<00:02:24.540> ones<00:02:24.780> with

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
probably have CCG of the only ones with

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.229 
probably have CCG of the only ones with
coins<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.560> they'll<00:02:25.950> probably<00:02:26.130> do<00:02:27.060> they're

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
coins and they'll probably do they're

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.820 
coins and they'll probably do they're
our<00:02:27.330> mission<00:02:27.690> files<00:02:27.930> to<00:02:28.380> make<00:02:28.500> everything

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
our mission files to make everything

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:31.009 
our mission files to make everything
fair<00:02:29.220> but<00:02:29.849> a<00:02:29.880> lot<00:02:30.090> of<00:02:30.120> server<00:02:30.420> owners<00:02:30.810> don't

00:02:31.009 --> 00:02:31.019 
fair but a lot of server owners don't

00:02:31.019 --> 00:02:32.780 
fair but a lot of server owners don't
have<00:02:31.110> time<00:02:31.380> or<00:02:31.410> didn't<00:02:31.980> even<00:02:32.130> pick<00:02:32.310> up<00:02:32.459> on<00:02:32.640> it

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
have time or didn't even pick up on it

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.050 
have time or didn't even pick up on it
so<00:02:33.540> there's<00:02:34.440> a<00:02:34.500> gap<00:02:34.650> there<00:02:34.980> I<00:02:35.160> personally

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
so there's a gap there I personally

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.509 
so there's a gap there I personally
don't<00:02:36.450> use<00:02:36.510> this<00:02:36.930> I've<00:02:37.380> just<00:02:37.950> used<00:02:38.160> this<00:02:38.310> for

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
don't use this I've just used this for

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:40.670 
don't use this I've just used this for
this<00:02:38.580> video<00:02:38.910> to<00:02:39.030> show<00:02:39.360> everyone<00:02:39.810> that<00:02:40.019> you<00:02:40.410> can

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
this video to show everyone that you can

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.920 
this video to show everyone that you can
do<00:02:40.920> that<00:02:41.160> I<00:02:41.340> find<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:42.239> takes<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.569> fun<00:02:42.750> out<00:02:42.780> of

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
do that I find it takes the fun out of

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.600 
do that I find it takes the fun out of
the<00:02:43.050> game<00:02:43.110> because<00:02:43.590> you<00:02:43.769> can<00:02:44.040> literally<00:02:44.370> sit

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
the game because you can literally sit

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.490 
the game because you can literally sit
here<00:02:44.819> for<00:02:45.030> an<00:02:45.090> hour<00:02:45.209> and<00:02:45.600> within<00:02:46.140> an<00:02:46.350> hour

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
