00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.620
 sabine kriete neumann has always been 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.720
 value placed on her outer and so on 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.519
 She is currently getting chemotherapy 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.980
 in which the hair does not fail 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.630
 a big relief i do mine 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.080
 Naturally, treatment also does a lot 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:18.000
 much happier and much 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.820
 more confident because I know it works 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.060
 I'm fine and you'll see me 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:27.180
 Now even tell from the outside of that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:30.119
 just no therapies and that 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:32.630
 is great before the chemo therapy in 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.920
 Medical Center Bonn gets the 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.770
 54-year-old put on a cap 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:38.930
 This will help your scalp 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.550
 computer controlled at about four degrees 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.430
 cooled down the cold reduces the 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.469
 circulation the result can be the elevation 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.520
 poorly reaching the hair roots and 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:49.739
 hardly destroy 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:51.870
 sabine brite neumann finds himself with 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:55.129
 cap ugly so she does not want to 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.829
 be filmed from close 

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:00.090
 a cooling and that we can with 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.469
 chemotherapies achieve that 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.850
 Hair loss is significantly reduced or 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.150
 hair loss is avoided too 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.260
 a common side effect of 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.460
 chemotherapy and that is not 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.810
 life threatening but that is for the 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.360
 affected patient that just women 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:13.290
 Of course very stressful because it is on the 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.210
 Of course I had a page in 

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:16.770
 Cosmetic effect has women feel 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.060
 just do not feel well and find her 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.220
 It does not feel nice and that too 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.840
 conditioned by each other that 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.009
 I think that's nice for that, of course 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.780
 usually then that you still have 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:26.400
 feels worse next to the 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.720
 possibly worse 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.850
 and on the other side is natural 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.950
 also stigmatize women online 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.869
 who go without hair on the street 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.220
 usually ford is that 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:36.689
 have any malignant disease 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.600
 therefore get the right therapy 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.909
 need your family and also colleagues in 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.310
 the it industry only know them as 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.140
 power woman and that should stay that way 

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:48.540
 sabine kriete neumann wants to get away from 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 Do not let cancer get by and with 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.740
 fight against it all forces 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.750
 in the medical center bonn complains 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:57.110
 her gynecologist does not do that for women 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.520
 be adequately supported everywhere 

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.409
 25 percent of the patient in Germany 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.270
 actually get what the companions 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.439
 four does not conform to avalanches 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.110
 therapies to improve the resort 

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:08.520
 in bonn, sabine crow neumann gets 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.470
 remedy for nausea 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.540
 therefore, chemistry is good for you now 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.500
 she survived two years ago 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.410
 ever 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.320
 otherwise we treat her constantly because of her 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.090
 was tired and all hair fell out in the 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.550
 Medical Center will be your blood 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.370
 analyzed in other patients as well 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.320
 sometimes the tumor tissue in this way 

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.400
 can be determined on which 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.190
 We address chemotherapy of cancer 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:37.890
 may be from the presence or not 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:39.780
 be present is then the second tour 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.640
 once the prognosis patients estimate 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.510
 but we can not do it 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.430
 count the tour 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.180
 in the course of therapy just stop 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:51.540
 conclusions because the therapy 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.040
 to draw effectiveness that lends itself 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.690
 especially if there are tax therapies 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.730
 to fail 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 the female patient in the center hope 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.500
 a gentle cure of your cancer 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.750
 also includes chemo without 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:09.450
 hair loss sabine kriete neumann is 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:12.570
 I am thrilled to go in here and feel 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:14.190
 I'm fine and I'm going out and for myself 

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.310
 well and i know where the time 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.920
 it just happens to my hair and the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:21.750
 hair roots are protective 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.390
 that makes an awful lot for me 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.790
 the new cold method that your hair 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.290
 sabine kriete neumann has to protect 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.570
 pay your own bag 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:32.790
 she does not mind because she wants 

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:34.590
 Do not lose your hair and 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.730
 So that your disease for everyone 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:40.500
 make it very easy to visualize 

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:43.650
 because I'm a private lecturer dr christian 

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.110
 korbacher gynecologist tumor expert just 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.900
 At this medical center in Bonn 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.430
 first how expensive is that with this 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:55.560
 cap the costs are between 70 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:59.340
 and 100 euros per session that is 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.420
 per therapy application may well 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.459
 already sometimes 1000 euro 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:04.260
 met the one must, however, 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:05.750
 in relation to the costs 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.320
 example human hair wig the 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.710
 insurance providers in general also 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:11.670
 not be taken over and in that respect 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.280
 line will not cost as much 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:15.780
 higher us at 1 it is so 

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.090
 unbelievably important that one 

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:19.800
 patient feels good with it too 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.170
 healthy again why will take over 

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:23.280
 funds so what is not cut for this the 

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:24.930
 warning is new you have to be very clear 

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.550
 samsung is still a very new treatment 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:28.680
 new treatment will be yes within 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.930
 checked on a committee in berlin 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:31.980
 the reimbursement capability that's just 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.560
 have not happened yet 

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:36.030
 the private costumers take over in 

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:38.760
 usually the cost of the therapy 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:40.380
 and so that's good too, just fine 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.290
 Feeling means that you are better 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:45.680
 There are cases where they can handle 

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:48.510
 say this cap is not suitable 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.650
 very clearly so i would this cold 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:51.570
 Not all caps treatment in all 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.130
 make it happen first there are sick 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.660
 that's not the field I'm allowed to do 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.210
 in my department but patient with 

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.310
 leukemia can not do so 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:00.870
 be treated there are 

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:03.000
 fears that there may be in the 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:04.050
 brain to collect malignant cells 

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000
 then not enough 

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:07.260
 there is chemotherapy 

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:08.970
 do not make a house full there you need 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:10.290
 to do and there are also 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:12.500
 motorcycle does not work but the 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:14.790
 Most chemotherapies we use in the 

00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:16.520
 Area of gynecological disease 

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:20.760
 So make breast cancer ovarian cancer 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.750
 the lady's cervix went 

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.380
 two years ago after chemotherapy 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.150
 not so good why are you doing better now 

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:28.740
 what else do you do besides the cap 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:29.880
 because I can not say why you 

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.930
 I'm fine now I do not know what 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.220
 before that was done the 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.870
 I do not have therapy myself 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:35.430
 answer so first is certainly 

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.620
 one of the aspects on the patient himself 

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.450
 at that time you have to see that without hair 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.400
 that may also weigh for them 

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.110
 was 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.580
 I can only say we are doing it 

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.990
 house a very intense too 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:46.950
 accompanying therapy means we give 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:48.510
 patient supporting medications 

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:50.250
 against all kinds of side effects 

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.600
 possibility not to occur at all 

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:52.770
 to let 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.540
 That's exactly what we're doing right now 

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:55.500
 the valid guidelines there are good 

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.730
 now leads for the 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:58.710
 supportive treatment at 

00:05:56.730 --> 00:06:00.150
 chemotherapies and we have great 

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.130
 Success that does not always work 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:03.870
 every patient but most of the best 

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:06.060
 she already succeeds in the worst 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.320
 time to bring reasonably switch 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:08.610
 and the possibility of cold there was 

00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.050
 Of course now another offer that 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.820
 You can also use the quality of life 

00:06:10.050 --> 00:06:16.140
 the patient still rightly say that 

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:19.830
 is not always important so sometimes 

00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:21.480
 it does not even say there is 

00:06:19.830 --> 00:06:23.130
 so with many diseases straight 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:24.199
 of breast cancer is now quite 

00:06:23.130 --> 00:06:26.759
 Well established 

00:06:24.199 --> 00:06:27.840
 but it will still live a therapy 

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.789
 in there we can with this treatment 

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:33.810
 very good, of course 

00:06:28.789 --> 00:06:35.070
 Patients who can differentiate 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:36.930
 so distinguish those 

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.419
 not from the therapy 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:43.039
 will benefit and those who 

00:06:39.419 --> 00:06:43.039
 just profit from it
