and<00:00:47.670> four<00:00:48.670> batteries<00:00:49.150> is<00:00:49.720> I'm<00:00:49.960> playing<00:00:50.140> here

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.320 
and four batteries is I'm playing here

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.600 
and four batteries is I'm playing here
times<00:00:50.650> all<00:00:51.370> good<00:00:51.670> good<00:00:52.150> foot<00:00:53.610> controller

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
times all good good foot controller

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:58.229 
times all good good foot controller
works<00:00:54.909> and<00:00:55.530> this<00:00:56.530> one<00:00:56.799> first<00:00:57.250> started<00:00:57.790> I<00:00:57.850> flew

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:58.239 
works and this one first started I flew

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.850 
works and this one first started I flew
it<00:00:58.420> broke<00:00:58.869> it<00:01:00.690> as<00:01:01.690> you<00:01:01.839> can<00:01:01.989> probably<00:01:02.199> see<00:01:02.379> here

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:02.860 
it broke it as you can probably see here

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:06.120 
it broke it as you can probably see here
on<00:01:03.280> the<00:01:03.489> back<00:01:03.989> was<00:01:04.989> a<00:01:05.080> little<00:01:05.290> bit<00:01:05.440> of<00:01:05.560> a<00:01:05.590> fixer

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
on the back was a little bit of a fixer

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.730 
on the back was a little bit of a fixer
of<00:01:06.310> Culloden<00:01:06.820> with<00:01:07.119> red<00:01:07.840> pen<00:01:08.110> see<00:01:08.409> can't

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
of Culloden with red pen see can't

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:11.370 
of Culloden with red pen see can't
really<00:01:09.070> tell<00:01:09.280> from<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.549> distance<00:01:10.140> but<00:01:11.140> yes

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
really tell from the distance but yes

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:16.050 
really tell from the distance but yes
not<00:01:11.710> that<00:01:11.740> clean<00:01:12.189> off<00:01:13.860> popped<00:01:14.860> out<00:01:15.100> these<00:01:15.790> on

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
not that clean off popped out these on

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.090 
not that clean off popped out these on
the<00:01:16.180> other<00:01:16.330> side<00:01:16.570> as<00:01:16.840> well<00:01:16.869> so<00:01:17.080> popped<00:01:17.740> out<00:01:17.979> the

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.100 
the other side as well so popped out the

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.080 
the other side as well so popped out the
arms<00:01:19.170> up<00:01:21.990> yeah<00:01:23.400> that<00:01:24.400> has<00:01:24.670> got<00:01:24.850> a<00:01:24.880> lot<00:01:25.060> more

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:25.090 
arms up yeah that has got a lot more

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.810 
arms up yeah that has got a lot more
power<00:01:25.540> than<00:01:26.470> this<00:01:26.680> one<00:01:26.950> that's<00:01:27.520> what<00:01:27.640> I'm

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:27.820 
power than this one that's what I'm

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.890 
power than this one that's what I'm
saying<00:01:28.060> these<00:01:29.020> are<00:01:29.560> eight<00:01:29.770> mill<00:01:30.100> motors<00:01:30.900> and

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
saying these are eight mill motors and

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:36.150 
saying these are eight mill motors and
if<00:01:32.050> you<00:01:32.290> next<00:01:33.100> to<00:01:33.250> each<00:01:33.370> other<00:01:34.560> even<00:01:35.560> trying<00:01:36.040> to

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:36.160 
if you next to each other even trying to

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.550 
if you next to each other even trying to
see<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.460> size<00:01:36.700> difference<00:01:40.409> it's<00:01:41.409> not

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
see the size difference it's not

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.470 
see the size difference it's not

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.480 
upgrading to a capital system

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.630 
upgrading to a capital system
this<00:01:43.990> has<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.230> long<00:01:44.440> power<00:01:44.740> I've<00:01:45.340> got<00:01:45.370> out

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
this has a long power I've got out

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:48.390 
this has a long power I've got out
control<00:01:46.150> in<00:01:46.360> high<00:01:46.540> wind<00:01:46.920> drops<00:01:47.920> it<00:01:48.100> on<00:01:48.220> one<00:01:48.370> a

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:48.400 
control in high wind drops it on one a

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.030 
control in high wind drops it on one a
corner<00:01:48.940> that<00:01:49.450> one<00:01:49.659> slapped<00:01:50.530> it<00:01:50.710> off

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
corner that one slapped it off

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.710 
corner that one slapped it off
so<00:01:51.610> yeah<00:01:51.900> sure<00:01:52.930> he<00:01:53.110> says<00:01:53.320> flies<00:01:53.620> over<00:01:53.890> I<00:01:54.720> had

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:55.720 
so yeah sure he says flies over I had

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.020 
so yeah sure he says flies over I had
about<00:01:55.870> half<00:01:56.110> one<00:01:56.380> of<00:01:56.500> these<00:01:56.620> batteries<00:01:57.030> these

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:58.030 
about half one of these batteries these

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.200 
about half one of these batteries these
are<00:01:58.180> the<00:01:58.270> batteries<00:01:58.630> I've<00:01:58.750> got<00:01:58.990> here<00:02:00.120> from<00:02:01.120> the

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:01.210 
are the batteries I've got here from the

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:03.090 
are the batteries I've got here from the
number<00:02:01.450> three<00:02:01.750> mark<00:02:02.380> and<00:02:02.560> we'll<00:02:02.650> leave<00:02:02.830> none

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
number three mark and we'll leave none

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.890 
number three mark and we'll leave none
bosina<00:02:03.460> which<00:02:03.700> one<00:02:03.909> he<00:02:04.060> used<00:02:04.360> that's<00:02:04.690> what<00:02:04.870> I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
bosina which one he used that's what I

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.050 
bosina which one he used that's what I
do<00:02:04.990> every<00:02:05.140> day<00:02:05.380> start<00:02:05.830> at<00:02:05.920> one<00:02:06.100> worth<00:02:06.850> up<00:02:07.030> to

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:07.060 
do every day start at one worth up to

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.919 
do every day start at one worth up to
five<00:02:07.390> and<00:02:08.700> I've<00:02:09.700> main<00:02:10.179> charge<00:02:10.509> that<00:02:10.750> yeah

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
five and I've main charge that yeah

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.740 
five and I've main charge that yeah
before<00:02:11.260> a<00:02:11.440> break<00:02:11.650> it<00:02:11.920> but<00:02:12.730> yeah<00:02:12.879> flag<00:02:13.299> both<00:02:13.540> of

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
before a break it but yeah flag both of

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.390 
before a break it but yeah flag both of
these<00:02:13.840> batteries<00:02:14.170> the<00:02:14.590> both<00:02:14.739> quite<00:02:15.010> good<00:02:15.220> in

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
these batteries the both quite good in

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:18.170 
these batteries the both quite good in
it<00:02:16.049> think<00:02:17.049> now<00:02:17.170> has<00:02:17.290> got<00:02:17.470> a<00:02:17.500> bit<00:02:17.650> more<00:02:17.830> power

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it think now has got a bit more power

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.240 
it think now has got a bit more power
but<00:02:19.180> this<00:02:19.269> one<00:02:19.480> seems<00:02:19.780> to<00:02:19.930> be<00:02:20.680> about<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:21.040> same

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.250 
but this one seems to be about the same

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.820 
but this one seems to be about the same
runtime<00:02:21.849> anyway<00:02:22.569> even<00:02:22.870> though<00:02:23.200> that's<00:02:23.409> I'm

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:23.830 
runtime anyway even though that's I'm

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.100 
runtime anyway even though that's I'm
done<00:02:24.040> for<00:02:24.190> any<00:02:24.310> milliamps<00:02:24.760> more<00:02:25.030> may<00:02:25.900> just

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
done for any milliamps more may just

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.979 
done for any milliamps more may just
because<00:02:26.379> it's<00:02:26.530> delivering<00:02:26.950> more<00:02:27.159> voltage<00:02:27.989> but

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
because it's delivering more voltage but

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:31.140 
because it's delivering more voltage but
yeah<00:02:29.170> to<00:02:29.529> have<00:02:29.709> a<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:30.189> don't<00:02:30.430> really<00:02:30.670> need<00:02:30.939> as

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
yeah to have a you don't really need as

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.269 
yeah to have a you don't really need as
much<00:02:31.389> in<00:02:32.019> one<00:02:32.170> of<00:02:32.260> these<00:02:32.379> is<00:02:32.709> you<00:02:32.829> doing<00:02:33.129> one<00:02:33.249> of

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:33.279 
much in one of these is you doing one of

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:37.769 
much in one of these is you doing one of
these<00:02:34.620> even<00:02:35.620> though<00:02:35.920> it's<00:02:36.099> heavier<00:02:36.779> because

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:37.779 
these even though it's heavier because

00:02:37.779 --> 00:02:40.009 
these even though it's heavier because
the<00:02:37.989> memory<00:02:38.319> card<00:02:38.590> and<00:02:38.829> all<00:02:38.950> the<00:02:39.159> bins<00:02:39.370> inside

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
the memory card and all the bins inside

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.339 
the memory card and all the bins inside
the<00:02:41.019> camera<00:02:41.290> or<00:02:42.159> this<00:02:42.279> one's<00:02:42.519> a<00:02:42.670> lot<00:02:42.879> lighter

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:43.349 
the camera or this one's a lot lighter

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.580 
the camera or this one's a lot lighter
but<00:02:44.349> the<00:02:44.680> motors<00:02:45.010> are<00:02:45.189> smaller<00:02:45.489> so<00:02:46.560> yep

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
but the motors are smaller so yep

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.099 
but the motors are smaller so yep
different<00:02:48.400> flooring<00:02:48.819> experience<00:02:49.359> in<00:02:49.569> my<00:02:49.719> eyes

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:50.109 
different flooring experience in my eyes

00:02:50.109 --> 00:02:52.589 
different flooring experience in my eyes
that's<00:02:51.099> a<00:02:51.370> lot<00:02:51.519> easier<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:51.999> control<00:02:52.120> the

00:02:52.589 --> 00:02:52.599 
that's a lot easier to control the

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:54.209 
that's a lot easier to control the
child's<00:02:52.959> like<00:02:53.139> the<00:02:53.290> low<00:02:53.469> rates<00:02:53.799> are<00:02:54.040> set

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:54.219 
child's like the low rates are set

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.209 
child's like the low rates are set
higher<00:02:54.489> on<00:02:54.849> this<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.359> and<00:02:55.810> on<00:02:55.930> that<00:02:56.139> one<00:02:56.379> so

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:57.219 
higher on this one and on that one so

00:02:57.219 --> 00:03:00.509 
higher on this one and on that one so
when<00:02:57.459> you<00:02:57.579> got<00:02:57.700> in<00:02:58.169> normal<00:02:59.169> mode<00:02:59.349> you<00:03:00.340> will

00:03:00.509 --> 00:03:00.519 
when you got in normal mode you will

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:05.610 
when you got in normal mode you will
find<00:03:00.790> that<00:03:01.169> it's<00:03:02.169> a<00:03:02.290> bit<00:03:02.439> more<00:03:02.590> lively<00:03:04.620> apart

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
find that it's a bit more lively apart

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.470 
find that it's a bit more lively apart
from<00:03:05.799> that<00:03:06.040> all<00:03:06.459> good<00:03:06.700> furnace<00:03:07.120> back<00:03:07.299> together

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:07.480 
from that all good furnace back together

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.869 
from that all good furnace back together
it's<00:03:07.900> fixed<00:03:08.319> i'll<00:03:08.529> put<00:03:08.859> some<00:03:08.889> see<00:03:09.279> a<00:03:09.310> clip<00:03:09.730> on

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:09.879 
it's fixed i'll put some see a clip on

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:13.860 
it's fixed i'll put some see a clip on
the<00:03:09.909> crack<00:03:11.459> largely<00:03:12.459> a<00:03:12.579> perfectly<00:03:13.359> got<00:03:13.599> on<00:03:13.779> a

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
the crack largely a perfectly got on a

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.580 
the crack largely a perfectly got on a
flat<00:03:14.109> surface<00:03:14.349> so<00:03:14.889> it<00:03:15.069> all<00:03:16.019> doesn't<00:03:17.019> wobble<00:03:17.290> or

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
flat surface so it all doesn't wobble or

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.269 
flat surface so it all doesn't wobble or
anything<00:03:17.829> so<00:03:18.279> and<00:03:18.519> strike<00:03:18.879> by

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:20.279 
anything so and strike by

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:23.039 
anything so and strike by
forestay<00:03:21.279> brothers<00:03:21.669> this<00:03:21.969> one<00:03:22.180> has<00:03:22.599> ever<00:03:22.779> done

00:03:23.039 --> 00:03:23.049 
forestay brothers this one has ever done

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:27.839 
forestay brothers this one has ever done
so<00:03:23.409> and<00:03:24.510> with<00:03:25.510> the<00:03:25.629> controllers<00:03:26.349> I'm<00:03:27.219> liking

00:03:27.839 --> 00:03:27.849 
so and with the controllers I'm liking

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.449 
so and with the controllers I'm liking
the<00:03:27.939> way<00:03:28.230> there's<00:03:29.230> actually<00:03:29.590> no<00:03:29.769> aerial<00:03:30.309> on

00:03:30.449 --> 00:03:30.459 
the way there's actually no aerial on

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:32.789 
the way there's actually no aerial on
this<00:03:30.669> you<00:03:31.540> can<00:03:31.659> see<00:03:31.719> I'm<00:03:31.989> taking<00:03:32.260> these<00:03:32.559> off

00:03:32.789 --> 00:03:32.799 
this you can see I'm taking these off

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:40.769 
this you can see I'm taking these off
here<00:03:33.209> but<00:03:38.489> yeah<00:03:39.489> one<00:03:40.209> thing<00:03:40.389> I've<00:03:40.569> noticed

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:40.779 
here but yeah one thing I've noticed

00:03:40.779 --> 00:03:43.259 
here but yeah one thing I've noticed
that's<00:03:41.169> different<00:03:41.709> about<00:03:42.010> this<00:03:42.400> is<00:03:42.700> in

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
that's different about this is in

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:49.610 
that's different about this is in
batteries<00:03:44.219> in<00:03:45.219> eve<00:03:45.609> got<00:03:46.180> little<00:03:47.019> springs<00:03:47.489> that

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:49.620 
batteries in eve got little springs that

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.149 
batteries in eve got little springs that
whereas<00:03:50.620> in<00:03:50.980> the<00:03:51.189> old<00:03:51.370> one<00:03:52.859> you<00:03:53.859> have<00:03:53.980> these

00:03:54.149 --> 00:03:54.159 
whereas in the old one you have these

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:57.239 
whereas in the old one you have these
Springs<00:03:55.139> apart<00:03:56.139> from<00:03:56.260> that<00:03:56.469> not<00:03:56.829> really<00:03:57.040> much

00:03:57.239 --> 00:03:57.249 
Springs apart from that not really much

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.489 
Springs apart from that not really much
of<00:03:57.279> a<00:03:57.459> difference<00:03:57.879> but<00:03:58.150> those<00:03:58.719> developed<00:03:59.409> the

00:03:59.489 --> 00:03:59.499 
of a difference but those developed the

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:01.679 
of a difference but those developed the
battery<00:03:59.829> slightly<00:04:00.340> tighter<00:04:00.609> but<00:04:01.419> I've<00:04:01.480> never

00:04:01.679 --> 00:04:01.689 
battery slightly tighter but I've never

00:04:01.689 --> 00:04:02.970 
battery slightly tighter but I've never
really<00:04:01.900> had<00:04:02.049> problem<00:04:02.439> with<00:04:02.499> the<00:04:02.620> batteries

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
really had problem with the batteries

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.199 
really had problem with the batteries
coming<00:04:03.309> out<00:04:03.400> on<00:04:03.639> this<00:04:03.870> so<00:04:05.069> but<00:04:06.069> the<00:04:06.249> aerial<00:04:06.760> on

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
coming out on this so but the aerial on

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.929 
coming out on this so but the aerial on
the<00:04:07.419> old<00:04:07.540> ones<00:04:07.809> is<00:04:08.109> a<00:04:08.139> dummy<00:04:08.439> one<00:04:08.739> so<00:04:09.699> you<00:04:09.790> can

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
the old ones is a dummy one so you can

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:12.119 
the old ones is a dummy one so you can
take<00:04:10.209> it<00:04:10.389> off<00:04:10.480> if<00:04:10.510> you<00:04:10.809> want<00:04:11.019> there's<00:04:11.680> no<00:04:11.769> need

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:12.129 
take it off if you want there's no need

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:17.129 
take it off if you want there's no need
for<00:04:12.159> it<00:04:12.579> really<00:04:14.579> so<00:04:15.579> yeah<00:04:15.760> quite<00:04:16.600> happy<00:04:17.019> with

00:04:17.129 --> 00:04:17.139 
for it really so yeah quite happy with

00:04:17.139 --> 00:04:19.229 
for it really so yeah quite happy with
it<00:04:17.199> good<00:04:17.650> first<00:04:17.919> light<00:04:18.250> got<00:04:18.639> some<00:04:18.820> video

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
it good first light got some video

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.530 
it good first light got some video
footage<00:04:19.480> of<00:04:20.019> me<00:04:20.590> crush<00:04:20.919> you<00:04:21.130> use<00:04:21.910> my<00:04:22.060> head<00:04:22.240> cam

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
footage of me crush you use my head cam

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.310 
footage of me crush you use my head cam
as<00:04:22.720> well<00:04:23.160> which<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.550> think<00:04:24.970> this<00:04:25.510> point<00:04:25.750> is<00:04:26.020> a

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
as well which I think this point is a

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:29.550 
as well which I think this point is a
bit<00:04:26.710> too<00:04:26.919> high<00:04:26.949> so<00:04:27.699> when<00:04:28.540> I<00:04:28.660> changed<00:04:29.199> it<00:04:29.350> so

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:29.560 
bit too high so when I changed it so

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.680 
bit too high so when I changed it so
it's<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.800> there<00:04:30.160> and<00:04:30.580> pulling<00:04:30.850> down<00:04:30.970> bit<00:04:31.510> more

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690 
it's on there and pulling down bit more

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.450 
it's on there and pulling down bit more
so<00:04:32.500> I'll<00:04:32.560> try<00:04:32.830> that<00:04:33.040> out<00:04:33.070> on<00:04:33.370> the<00:04:33.460> next<00:04:33.760> one

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.460 
so I'll try that out on the next one

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:39.180 
so I'll try that out on the next one
yes<00:04:36.460> good<00:04:37.240> fun<00:04:37.480> happy<00:04:38.470> with<00:04:38.620> it<00:04:38.770> even<00:04:38.980> though

00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:39.190 
yes good fun happy with it even though

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:43.070 
yes good fun happy with it even though
break<00:04:39.490> it<00:04:39.670> on<00:04:39.760> the<00:04:39.880> first<00:04:40.090> flight<00:04:40.560> but<00:04:41.560> yeah

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:43.080 
break it on the first flight but yeah

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.930 
break it on the first flight but yeah
get<00:04:44.080> one<00:04:44.290> that's<00:04:44.890> on<00:04:45.160> foreign<00:04:45.460> tradition

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:45.940

problem<00:04:50.530> with<00:04:50.650> mono<00:04:51.040> they<00:04:51.190> all<00:04:51.370> do<00:04:51.550> it<00:04:51.730> but

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:52.140 
problem with mono they all do it but

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:55.800 
problem with mono they all do it but
yeah<00:04:53.580> thanks<00:04:54.580> for<00:04:54.610> watching<00:04:55.030> I'll<00:04:55.450> see<00:04:55.510> you
