00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
on the future in this game anyway this

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:16.970 
on the future in this game anyway this
is<00:00:15.120> with<00:00:15.269> no<00:00:15.480> arms<00:00:15.870> glitch<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.590> it<00:00:16.710> looks<00:00:16.890> very

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
is with no arms glitch and it looks very

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.950 
is with no arms glitch and it looks very
similar<00:00:17.340> to<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.880> new<00:00:18.240> leg<00:00:18.449> splits<00:00:18.779> from

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
similar to the new leg splits from

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.990 
similar to the new leg splits from
youthfully<00:00:19.770> the<00:00:20.160> only<00:00:20.340> difference<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.789> is

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
youthfully the only difference is is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.820 
youthfully the only difference is is
that<00:00:21.210> your<00:00:21.390> arms<00:00:21.660> are<00:00:21.750> invisible<00:00:21.930> instead<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
that your arms are invisible instead of

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.200 
that your arms are invisible instead of
for<00:00:22.949> your<00:00:23.070> legs<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.460> your<00:00:23.850> hands<00:00:24.119> are

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
for your legs and your hands are

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:25.700 
for your legs and your hands are
floating<00:00:24.539> in<00:00:24.630> the<00:00:24.750> air<00:00:24.779> instead<00:00:25.170> of<00:00:25.289> your<00:00:25.439> feet

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
floating in the air instead of your feet

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.099 
floating in the air instead of your feet
now<00:00:26.490> it<00:00:26.789> looks<00:00:26.910> very<00:00:27.060> funny<00:00:27.480> when<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:27.990> are

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
now it looks very funny when you are

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:29.630 
now it looks very funny when you are
doing<00:00:28.230> arm<00:00:28.500> wrestling<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:29.010> especially<00:00:29.340> when

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
doing arm wrestling and especially when

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.580 
doing arm wrestling and especially when
you're<00:00:29.789> driving<00:00:29.910> around<00:00:30.210> on<00:00:30.480> a<00:00:30.510> bike<00:00:30.779> this<00:00:31.439> is

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
you're driving around on a bike this is

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.020 
you're driving around on a bike this is
probably<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.980> easiest<00:00:32.070> glitz<00:00:32.820> and<00:00:33.000> the

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
probably the easiest glitz and the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.120 
probably the easiest glitz and the
entire<00:00:33.600> game<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.200> I<00:00:34.260> suggest<00:00:34.590> you<00:00:34.680> all<00:00:34.800> get<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
entire game so I suggest you all get it

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.160 
entire game so I suggest you all get it
done<00:00:35.280> before<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.700> next<00:00:35.820> update<00:00:36.120> because<00:00:36.960> even

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
done before the next update because even

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.690 
done before the next update because even
though<00:00:37.440> that<00:00:37.649> they<00:00:37.770> might<00:00:37.950> patch<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.550> way<00:00:38.640> to

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
though that they might patch the way to

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.280 
though that they might patch the way to
do<00:00:38.940> the<00:00:39.059> glitch<00:00:39.180> you<00:00:39.660> can<00:00:39.809> probably<00:00:39.989> still

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
do the glitch you can probably still

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.110 
do the glitch you can probably still
keep<00:00:40.590> invisible<00:00:41.160> arms<00:00:41.489> as<00:00:41.640> long<00:00:41.820> as<00:00:41.940> we<00:00:42.030> have

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
keep invisible arms as long as we have

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.600 
keep invisible arms as long as we have
done<00:00:42.270> the<00:00:42.420> clips<00:00:42.629> before<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:43.110> update<00:00:43.610> before

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
done the clips before the update before

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
done the clips before the update before
you<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:44.969> started<00:00:45.090> with<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> clips<00:00:45.809> you<00:00:46.200> have

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320
