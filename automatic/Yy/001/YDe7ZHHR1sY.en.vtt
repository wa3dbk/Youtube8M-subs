initially started feeding the VMR corn
silage<00:00:30.180> I'd<00:00:30.539> say<00:00:30.779> we<00:00:30.960> noticed<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.619> probably<00:00:32.189> a

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
silage I'd say we noticed a probably a

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.849 
silage I'd say we noticed a probably a
five<00:00:32.520> to<00:00:32.789> eight<00:00:32.909> pound<00:00:33.269> per<00:00:33.780> head<00:00:34.019> per<00:00:34.289> day

difference increase in milk production

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:39.319 
difference increase in milk production
we've<00:00:37.379> been<00:00:37.589> very<00:00:37.649> happy<00:00:37.980> with<00:00:38.370> our<00:00:38.819> milk

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
we've been very happy with our milk

production and our cow health I am a

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.759 
production and our cow health I am a
firm<00:00:41.969> believer<00:00:41.999> that<00:00:42.420> we<00:00:42.839> need<00:00:43.019> to<00:00:43.170> feed<00:00:43.379> cows

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:43.769 
firm believer that we need to feed cows

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:46.129 
firm believer that we need to feed cows
like<00:00:44.339> the<00:00:44.609> ruminants<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.300> they<00:00:45.449> are<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:46.139 
like the ruminants that they are and the

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:47.959 
like the ruminants that they are and the
BMR<00:00:46.559> corn<00:00:46.979> silage<00:00:47.249> with<00:00:47.550> high<00:00:47.729> digestibility

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:47.969 
BMR corn silage with high digestibility

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.809 
BMR corn silage with high digestibility
really<00:00:48.780> helps<00:00:49.109> that<00:00:49.289> rumen<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:50.280> function

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:50.819 
really helps that rumen to function

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:54.469 
really helps that rumen to function
optimally<00:00:51.109> help<00:00:52.109> set<00:00:52.409> cow<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:53.059> be<00:00:54.059> healthy

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:54.479 
optimally help set cow to be healthy

00:00:54.479 --> 00:00:56.509 
optimally help set cow to be healthy
some<00:00:54.989> of<00:00:55.079> the<00:00:55.170> biggest<00:00:55.350> advantages<00:00:56.129> we<00:00:56.309> see

00:00:56.509 --> 00:00:56.519 
some of the biggest advantages we see

00:00:56.519 --> 00:00:58.430 
some of the biggest advantages we see
with<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.789> BMR<00:00:57.210> corn<00:00:57.510> the<00:00:57.719> first<00:00:57.960> year<00:00:58.199> that<00:00:58.229> we

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
with the BMR corn the first year that we

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.489 
with the BMR corn the first year that we
fed<00:00:58.709> it<00:00:59.269> we<00:01:00.269> had<00:01:00.389> actually<00:01:00.600> increased<00:01:01.229> cow

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:01.499 
fed it we had actually increased cow

00:01:01.499 --> 00:01:04.130 
fed it we had actually increased cow
numbers<00:01:01.769> from<00:01:02.249> the<00:01:02.309> previous<00:01:02.429> year<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.359> we

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
numbers from the previous year and we

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.870 
numbers from the previous year and we
knew<00:01:04.290> right<00:01:04.500> away<00:01:04.559> that<00:01:04.829> the<00:01:05.159> cows<00:01:05.339> are<00:01:05.549> making

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
knew right away that the cows are making

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:07.880 
knew right away that the cows are making
more<00:01:06.090> use<00:01:06.119> of<00:01:06.360> that<00:01:06.840> silage<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.799> were

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
more use of that silage because we were

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.050 
more use of that silage because we were
hauling<00:01:08.159> out<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.399> same<00:01:08.579> amount<00:01:08.729> of<00:01:08.969> matter

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
hauling out the same amount of matter

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.840 
hauling out the same amount of matter
from<00:01:09.750> more<00:01:10.020> cows<00:01:10.399> percentage<00:01:11.399> of<00:01:11.549> our<00:01:11.640> acreage

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
from more cows percentage of our acreage

from more cows percentage of our acreage
into<00:01:12.479> BMR<00:01:12.899> has<00:01:13.170> steadily<00:01:13.469> increased<00:01:13.649> over<00:01:14.310> the

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
into BMR has steadily increased over the

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.940 
into BMR has steadily increased over the
six<00:01:14.670> years<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.090> just<00:01:15.509> basically<00:01:15.990> because<00:01:16.770> of

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
six years and just basically because of

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.039 
six years and just basically because of
the<00:01:17.159> success<00:01:17.640> that<00:01:17.880> we've<00:01:18.180> seen<00:01:18.450> with<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.840> this

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
the success that we've seen with it this

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.289 
the success that we've seen with it this
year<00:01:19.289> we<00:01:19.439> harvested<00:01:19.890> over<00:01:20.159> 300<00:01:20.670> acres<00:01:21.000> of<00:01:21.149> it

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
year we harvested over 300 acres of it

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.270 
year we harvested over 300 acres of it
and<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:21.899> year<00:01:22.109> we<00:01:22.229> did<00:01:22.409> not<00:01:22.590> harvest<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
and this year we did not harvest a

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.190 
and this year we did not harvest a
single<00:01:23.640> acre<00:01:23.789> of<00:01:24.000> conventional<00:01:24.689> corn<00:01:24.930> silage

at<00:01:25.590> all<00:01:25.740> neither<00:01:26.219> did<00:01:26.520> we<00:01:26.579> harvest<00:01:27.060> any<00:01:27.240> corn

00:01:27.319 --> 00:01:27.329 
at all neither did we harvest any corn

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:29.990 
at all neither did we harvest any corn
for<00:01:28.049> feet<00:01:28.259> we<00:01:28.469> we<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.100> taken<00:01:29.460> corn<00:01:29.700> out<00:01:29.880> of

for feet we we have taken corn out of

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.120 
for feet we we have taken corn out of
the<00:01:30.060> ration<00:01:30.509> because<00:01:30.929> of<00:01:31.109> the<00:01:31.259> high

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
the ration because of the high

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.370 
the ration because of the high
digestibility<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.299> BMR<00:01:33.689> corn<00:01:33.990> were<00:01:34.140> able

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
advances made with BMR because initially

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.200 
advances made with BMR because initially
he<00:01:52.259> did<00:01:52.439> have<00:01:52.619> concerns<00:01:53.100> we've<00:01:53.759> seen<00:01:54.090> the

he did have concerns we've seen the

he did have concerns we've seen the
varieties<00:01:54.630> really<00:01:55.049> improve<00:01:55.409> on<00:01:55.649> yield

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
varieties really improve on yield

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.859 
varieties really improve on yield
improve<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.210> standability<00:01:57.810> harvest<00:01:58.740> ability

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
improve on standability harvest ability

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:02.719

drought<00:02:00.869> tolerance<00:02:01.530> everything<00:02:02.520> has<00:02:02.700> just

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
drought tolerance everything has just

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.550 
drought tolerance everything has just
continued<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.420> improve<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.200> we've<00:02:04.350> been<00:02:04.530> very

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
continued to improve so we've been very

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.499 
continued to improve so we've been very
confident<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.399> just<00:02:05.579> continue<00:02:06.030> to<00:02:06.149> raise<00:02:06.329> our

with<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.540> BMR<00:02:09.960> when<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.229> start<00:02:10.470> looking<00:02:10.830> at

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
with the BMR when you start looking at

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.120 
with the BMR when you start looking at

the increased cow health and the

potential production I think people

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.480 
potential production I think people
really<00:02:18.660> need<00:02:18.840> to<00:02:19.050> try<00:02:19.320> it<00:02:19.380> at<00:02:19.770> least<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:20.190> see
