00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.350
 Always in one place- 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.200
 One of the reasons why it is possible to reduce the consolidation of portals of the US Navy 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
 It is a reason, but the times are not so good 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:30.779
 Joint 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:33.699
 Like the London Metal Exchange Nickel 

00:00:33.699 --> 00:00:36.850
 I have 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.850
 End 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.920
 End 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.920
 End 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.960
 Kobe volunteers 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.450
 Such as a big drop 

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.860
 Because in advance 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.860
 It was a really big humiliation 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.780
 I think it's gravure 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.140
 By all means 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.470
 Won over 2006 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.590
 I made five thousand parts 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.920
 This is the first year's policy 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.580
 Director Suzuki 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.190
 Because plankton 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:54.350
 f1 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.550
 Michio 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:58.440
 Female candidate weights co.ltd. 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.750
 I want to be the best in this year 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.750
 I have not entered the afternoon 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.750
 I told my heart that imap could have 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:20.139
 It is the lower one 

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:23.139
 If it does this, it will be this 

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.829
 What was announced last month 

00:02:27.439 --> 00:02:30.439
 There each 

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:34.189
 When compared to the minutes 

00:02:34.189 --> 00:02:37.189
 I understand the difference 

00:02:44.259 --> 00:02:47.459
 It is Japanese and big wounds 

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.019
 22- 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.329
 This horse may also come out 

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.689
 A little... 

00:02:53.689 --> 00:02:56.619
 A little life 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.899
 Also 4 meters 94 

00:02:58.899 --> 00:03:01.899
 Japanese people also got up 

00:03:04.919 --> 00:03:07.919
 Man is pampers 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:21.729
 Use is free 

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:22.709
 It seems to be new
