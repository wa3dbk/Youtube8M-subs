00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:27.599 
it was around level 6 yeah then your own

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:29.390 
it was around level 6 yeah then your own

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
that point it was pretty much a one game

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.510 
that point it was pretty much a one game
because<00:00:34.200> they<00:00:34.680> couldn't<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.010> anything<00:00:35.190> bottom

the back foot on another way is like
they<00:01:22.470> just<00:01:22.610> it<00:01:23.610> didn't<00:01:23.940> pretty<00:01:24.480> much<00:01:24.690> exploit

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
they just it didn't pretty much exploit

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.320 
they just it didn't pretty much exploit
their<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.890> advantages<00:01:26.700> they<00:01:26.880> might<00:01:27.090> have<00:01:27.210> had

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:28.800 
in certain situations they shouldn't

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:30.420 
in certain situations they shouldn't
press<00:01:29.460> them<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.940> yeah

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:30.430 
press them and yeah

there as well but this is like another
level<00:01:51.820> like<00:01:52.000> these<00:01:52.720> guys<00:01:52.930> actually<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.680> have

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
level like these guys actually I have

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.450 
level like these guys actually I have
banners<00:01:54.280> and<00:01:54.790> so<00:01:54.869> it's<00:01:55.869> pretty<00:01:55.990> amazing

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
banners and so it's pretty amazing

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.850 
banners and so it's pretty amazing
so<00:01:57.460> since<00:01:57.880> you've<00:01:58.000> just<00:01:58.210> taken<00:01:58.390> out<00:01:58.600> mtw<00:01:59.320> what

00:01:59.850 --> 00:01:59.860 
so since you've just taken out mtw what

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:00.930 
so since you've just taken out mtw what
do<00:01:59.920> you<00:02:00.010> think<00:02:00.190> your<00:02:00.280> chances<00:02:00.460> are<00:02:00.760> for

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:00.940 
do you think your chances are for

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:04.139 
do you think your chances are for
winning<00:02:01.180> the<00:02:01.270> entire<00:02:01.540> tournament<00:02:01.780> I<00:02:02.970> think<00:02:03.970> we

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.149 
winning the entire tournament I think we

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:06.120 
winning the entire tournament I think we
have<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.360> fair<00:02:04.990> chance<00:02:05.020> of<00:02:05.649> winning<00:02:06.040> the

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
have a fair chance of winning the

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.040 
have a fair chance of winning the
tournament

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
tournament

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.210 
tournament
it's<00:02:08.620> not<00:02:08.800> going<00:02:08.979> to<00:02:09.070> be<00:02:09.160> easy<00:02:09.340> of<00:02:09.580> course<00:02:09.850> and

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
it's not going to be easy of course and

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.310 
it's not going to be easy of course and
well<00:02:12.420> let's<00:02:13.420> just<00:02:13.630> see<00:02:13.720> what<00:02:13.870> counts<00:02:14.170> like

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
well let's just see what counts like

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:16.470 
well let's just see what counts like
we're<00:02:14.830> playing<00:02:14.950> TSM<00:02:15.490> next<00:02:15.850> which<00:02:16.180> is<00:02:16.270> a<00:02:16.330> pretty

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:16.480

we're playing TSM next which is a pretty
hard<00:02:16.720> match<00:02:16.900> and<00:02:17.290> then<00:02:18.190> we<00:02:18.520> just<00:02:18.550> see<00:02:18.850> where<00:02:19.120> it

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:19.150 
hard match and then we just see where it

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.780 
hard match and then we just see where it
goes<00:02:19.210> like<00:02:19.570> we<00:02:19.720> can't<00:02:19.870> really<00:02:20.050> tell
