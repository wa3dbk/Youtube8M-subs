maybe<00:02:22.709> if<00:02:22.890> used<00:02:23.129> for<00:02:23.370> free<00:02:23.580> free<00:02:23.790> and

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:23.970 
maybe if used for free free and

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.509 
maybe if used for free free and
constantly<00:02:24.629> cross<00:02:24.900> it<00:02:25.110> they<00:02:25.379> the<00:02:26.069> rent<00:02:26.220> a<00:02:26.340> may

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:28.940 
constantly cross it they the rent a may
work<00:02:26.790> but<00:02:27.060> even<00:02:27.420> still<00:02:27.659> in<00:02:28.110> that<00:02:28.319> one<00:02:28.590> striker

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
work but even still in that one striker

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.649 
work but even still in that one striker
formation<00:02:29.489> i<00:02:29.640> would<00:02:29.760> definitely<00:02:30.030> still<00:02:30.390> use

00:02:30.649 --> 00:02:30.659 
formation i would definitely still use

00:02:30.659 --> 00:02:33.710
