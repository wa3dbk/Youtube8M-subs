that's<00:00:27.300> holding<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.689> thing<00:00:27.750> on<00:00:28.109> is<00:00:28.820> those

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
that's holding this thing on is those

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.650 
that's holding this thing on is those
breaks<00:00:30.240> for<00:00:30.679> you<00:00:31.679> know<00:00:31.830> right<00:00:32.070> up<00:00:32.219> against<00:00:32.550> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
breaks for you know right up against the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:38.049 
breaks for you know right up against the
inside<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.719> that<00:00:33.840> tub<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.680> rust<00:00:34.890> it<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.280> there

00:00:38.049 --> 00:00:38.059 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:40.729 

so<00:00:39.059> pretty<00:00:39.690> much<00:00:39.780> all<00:00:40.050> I'm<00:00:40.200> gonna<00:00:40.320> do<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.500> just

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
so pretty much all I'm gonna do is just

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.340 
so pretty much all I'm gonna do is just
loosen<00:00:41.100> the<00:00:41.160> breaks<00:00:41.399> up<00:00:41.870> stick<00:00:42.870> it<00:00:42.989> back<00:00:43.110> on

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
loosen the breaks up stick it back on

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.250 
loosen the breaks up stick it back on
there<00:00:43.559> so<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.340> it<00:00:44.550> will<00:00:44.670> turn<00:00:44.940> now<00:00:45.930> that<00:00:46.170> I've

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
there so that it will turn now that I've

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.830 
there so that it will turn now that I've
made<00:00:46.469> that<00:00:46.649> puller<00:00:46.980> I<00:00:47.340> might<00:00:48.180> pull<00:00:48.450> these<00:00:48.570> back

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
made that puller I might pull these back

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.630 
made that puller I might pull these back
one's<00:00:48.870> off<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.440> same<00:00:49.680> way<00:00:49.890> there<00:00:50.100> frozen<00:00:50.370> on

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
one's off the same way there frozen on

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:55.420 
one's off the same way there frozen on
to<00:00:50.969> but<00:00:51.750> the<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.079> ones<00:00:52.350> have<00:00:53.510> have<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> shaft

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
to but the back ones have have a shaft

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.959 
to but the back ones have have a shaft
in<00:00:56.430> them<00:00:56.670> that<00:00:57.149> goes<00:00:57.420> to<00:00:58.379> the<00:00:58.530> trans<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.039> so<00:00:59.340> I

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
in them that goes to the trans I so I

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:01.580 
in them that goes to the trans I so I
don't<00:01:00.510> know<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.690> can<00:01:00.780> see<00:01:00.989> that<00:01:01.199> in<00:01:01.379> the

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
don't know if you can see that in the

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.609 
don't know if you can see that in the
dark<00:01:02.239> so<00:01:03.239> I<00:01:03.270> figure<00:01:03.780> there<00:01:03.930> they<00:01:04.290> may<00:01:04.439> be<00:01:04.470> a

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
dark so I figure there they may be a

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.370 
dark so I figure there they may be a
little<00:01:04.680> harder<00:01:05.129> to<00:01:05.159> get<00:01:05.339> off<00:01:05.549> but<00:01:05.909> I<00:01:06.320> wanted<00:01:07.320> to

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
little harder to get off but I wanted to

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.719 
little harder to get off but I wanted to
get<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.560> off<00:01:07.770> because<00:01:08.159> I<00:01:08.340> kept<00:01:08.580> thinking

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
get that off because I kept thinking

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:10.880 
get that off because I kept thinking
about<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.299> know<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.479> hate<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:10.020> start<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.380> job<00:01:10.619> and

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
about you know I hate to start a job and

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.800 
about you know I hate to start a job and
get<00:01:10.950> stuck<00:01:11.340> on<00:01:11.520> something<00:01:11.850> I<00:01:12.240> can't<00:01:12.510> get<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
get stuck on something I can't get it to

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.800 
get stuck on something I can't get it to
work<00:01:12.840> I<00:01:13.320> just<00:01:13.700> keep<00:01:14.700> me<00:01:14.909> awake<00:01:15.150> at<00:01:15.180> night<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:15.750> I

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
work I just keep me awake at night so I

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.770 
work I just keep me awake at night so I
thought<00:01:15.990> if<00:01:16.140> I<00:01:16.229> could<00:01:16.290> get<00:01:16.530> that<00:01:16.770> off<00:01:17.630> that's<00:01:18.630> a

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
thought if I could get that off that's a

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.530 
thought if I could get that off that's a
big<00:01:18.960> deal<00:01:19.460> because<00:01:20.460> basically<00:01:20.790> I<00:01:21.210> come<00:01:21.450> out

whenever<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.479> want<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:43.130> I<00:01:44.810> think<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:45.930> a

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
whenever we want to I think it's a

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.450 
whenever we want to I think it's a
cool-looking<00:01:46.200> car<00:01:46.740> just<00:01:46.979> sitting<00:01:47.280> in<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
cool-looking car just sitting in the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.780 
cool-looking car just sitting in the
yard<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.970> other<00:01:48.930> day<00:01:49.140> I<00:01:49.170> i<00:01:49.619> had<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.369> rat<00:01:50.579> rod

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
yard and other day I i had to rat rod

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.330 
yard and other day I i had to rat rod
parked<00:01:51.149> out<00:01:51.299> by<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.570> garage<00:01:52.100> they<00:01:53.100> looked

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
parked out by the garage they looked

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:54.770 
parked out by the garage they looked
really<00:01:53.460> cool<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:53.970> I<00:01:54.000> thought<00:01:54.180> we'd<00:01:54.390> look<00:01:54.509> even

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
really cool and I thought we'd look even

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.240 
really cool and I thought we'd look even
really<00:01:54.990> cooler<00:01:55.320> if<00:01:55.409> that<00:01:55.530> Volkswagen<00:01:56.130> was

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
really cooler if that Volkswagen was

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:57.289 
really cooler if that Volkswagen was
sitting<00:01:56.490> there<00:01:56.579> peeking<00:01:56.939> around<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.240> corner

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
sitting there peeking around the corner

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.359 
sitting there peeking around the corner
you<00:01:57.630> know<00:01:57.750> so<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.409> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.130> just<00:01:59.189> think

00:01:59.359 --> 00:01:59.369 
you know so I don't know I just think

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.590 
you know so I don't know I just think
it'd<00:01:59.549> be<00:01:59.579> kind<00:01:59.820> of<00:01:59.880> fun<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.090> get<00:02:00.240> it<00:02:00.360> right<00:02:00.509> and

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
it'd be kind of fun to get it right and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:01.999
