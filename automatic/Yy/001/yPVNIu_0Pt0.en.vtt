this data the system could stop taking

this data the system could stop taking

step<00:00:35.420> we<00:00:35.840> made<00:00:36.020> an<00:00:36.170> iOS<00:00:36.530> app<00:00:36.680> the<00:00:36.950> synthesized

step we made an iOS app the synthesized

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.869 
step we made an iOS app the synthesized
