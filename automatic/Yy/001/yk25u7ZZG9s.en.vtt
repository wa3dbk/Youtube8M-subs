00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:31.699 
I also initially tried to run with the
offensive<00:02:30.719> perk<00:02:30.959> which<00:02:31.139> is<00:02:31.260> what<00:02:31.439> Sam

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
offensive perk which is what Sam

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.770 
offensive perk which is what Sam
originally<00:02:32.340> suggested<00:02:32.519> but<00:02:33.359> honestly<00:02:33.689> I

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
originally suggested but honestly I

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.179 
originally suggested but honestly I
found<00:02:34.049> myself<00:02:34.230> getting<00:02:34.530> shot<00:02:34.859> up<00:02:34.889> way<00:02:35.129> too

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
found myself getting shot up way too

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:37.670 
found myself getting shot up way too
easily<00:02:35.609> so<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.569> half<00:02:36.870> of<00:02:37.019> these<00:02:37.200> clips<00:02:37.469> I'm

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
easily so in half of these clips I'm

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.289 
easily so in half of these clips I'm
running<00:02:37.950> with<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.129> defensive<00:02:38.609> perk<00:02:38.819> instead

00:02:39.289 --> 00:02:39.299

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.270 
running with the defensive perk instead
now<00:02:40.109> one<00:02:40.469> thing<00:02:40.650> I<00:02:40.769> actually<00:02:40.950> found

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
now one thing I actually found

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.220 
now one thing I actually found
interesting<00:02:42.000> about<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.359> scar-h<00:02:42.629> in<00:02:43.019> real

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:43.230 
interesting about the scar-h in real

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.199 
interesting about the scar-h in real
life<00:02:43.500> is<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.099> it<00:02:44.219> can<00:02:44.340> actually<00:02:44.730> use<00:02:44.939> pretty

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
life is that it can actually use pretty

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.849 
life is that it can actually use pretty
much<00:02:45.299> all<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.900> the<00:02:46.019> attachments<00:02:46.590> from<00:02:46.709> what

loadout though is because it's

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:23.549 
this loadout performed in game well I

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:25.339 
this loadout performed in game well I
have<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.090> say<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.510> had<00:03:24.629> been<00:03:24.780> quite<00:03:24.989> a<00:03:25.109> while

00:03:25.339 --> 00:03:25.349 
have to say it had been quite a while

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:26.780 
have to say it had been quite a while
since<00:03:25.590> I<00:03:25.769> played<00:03:25.829> with<00:03:26.220> the<00:03:26.310> scar<00:03:26.579> and

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:26.790 
since I played with the scar and

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:28.969 
since I played with the scar and
honestly<00:03:27.540> I<00:03:27.569> expected<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:28.319> to<00:03:28.349> do<00:03:28.530> better<00:03:28.739> than

00:03:28.969 --> 00:03:28.979 
honestly I expected it to do better than

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:31.429 
honestly I expected it to do better than
it<00:03:29.069> actually<00:03:29.220> did<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:30.389> damage<00:03:30.629> model<00:03:31.019> of<00:03:31.199> all

00:03:31.429 --> 00:03:31.439 
it actually did the damage model of all

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.110 
it actually did the damage model of all
the<00:03:31.620> assault<00:03:31.859> rifles<00:03:32.280> got<00:03:32.459> nerfed<00:03:32.699> a<00:03:32.909> few

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
the assault rifles got nerfed a few

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.939 
the assault rifles got nerfed a few
months<00:03:33.389> ago<00:03:33.479> and<00:03:33.810> for<00:03:34.229> a<00:03:34.260> hard-hitting<00:03:34.680> gun

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:34.949 
months ago and for a hard-hitting gun

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:36.619 
months ago and for a hard-hitting gun
like<00:03:35.159> the<00:03:35.310> skull<00:03:35.549> which<00:03:35.760> relies<00:03:36.090> on<00:03:36.120> high

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:36.629

more<00:03:38.819> than<00:03:38.879> most<00:03:39.239> it's<00:03:39.959> not<00:03:40.169> that<00:03:40.319> the<00:03:40.409> sky<00:03:40.620> is

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:40.859

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
the 1911 is not bad for a hard-hitting

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.530 
the 1911 is not bad for a hard-hitting
semi-auto<00:04:08.009> pistol<00:04:08.129> but<00:04:08.970> it<00:04:09.060> does<00:04:09.239> have<00:04:09.509> a

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
semi-auto pistol but it does have a

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
rounds honestly any of the revolvers

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:15.439 
rounds honestly any of the revolvers
would<00:04:14.340> have<00:04:14.430> been<00:04:14.549> a<00:04:14.579> better<00:04:14.790> choice<00:04:14.909> for<00:04:15.299> long

00:04:15.439 --> 00:04:15.449 
would have been a better choice for long

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:17.449 
would have been a better choice for long
range<00:04:15.629> and<00:04:15.930> the<00:04:16.199> 93r<00:04:16.680> would<00:04:17.039> be<00:04:17.159> better<00:04:17.340> for

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459 
range and the 93r would be better for

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:19.099 
range and the 93r would be better for
close<00:04:17.789> range<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:18.389> if<00:04:18.479> it<00:04:18.599> wasn't<00:04:18.930> for<00:04:18.989> the

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:19.109 
close range so if it wasn't for the

00:04:19.109 --> 00:04:20.810 
close range so if it wasn't for the
theme<00:04:19.320> I<00:04:19.530> wouldn't<00:04:19.979> have<00:04:20.070> chosen<00:04:20.220> to<00:04:20.489> run<00:04:20.609> with

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
theme I wouldn't have chosen to run with

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.540

this<00:04:20.940> pistol<00:04:21.299> at<00:04:21.479> all<00:04:21.659> as<00:04:21.930> for<00:04:22.529> the<00:04:22.620> m26<00:04:23.130> Dart

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
this pistol at all as for the m26 Dart

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.159 
this pistol at all as for the m26 Dart
all<00:04:23.700> my<00:04:23.849> thinking<00:04:24.240> was<00:04:24.419> that<00:04:24.630> maybe<00:04:24.960> this

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
all my thinking was that maybe this

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:26.150 
all my thinking was that maybe this
could<00:04:25.349> make<00:04:25.560> up<00:04:25.740> for<00:04:25.919> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
could make up for the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.670 
could make up for the
at<00:04:26.370> the<00:04:26.460> sky<00:04:26.730> and<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.150> 1911<00:04:27.570> both<00:04:28.350> aren't

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
at the sky and the 1911 both aren't

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.260 
at the sky and the 1911 both aren't
particularly<00:04:29.100> good<00:04:29.250> in<00:04:29.700> close<00:04:29.940> range

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:30.270 
particularly good in close range

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.330 
particularly good in close range
honestly<00:04:31.260> I<00:04:31.290> think<00:04:31.410> the<00:04:31.620> noobtube<00:04:31.830> would<00:04:32.250> have

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
honestly I think the noobtube would have

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:33.710 
honestly I think the noobtube would have
been<00:04:32.460> a<00:04:32.490> much<00:04:32.700> better<00:04:32.880> choice<00:04:33.180> for<00:04:33.210> this<00:04:33.510> setup

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
been a much better choice for this setup

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.230 
been a much better choice for this setup
though<00:04:34.020> because<00:04:34.470> the<00:04:34.710> m26<00:04:35.310> is<00:04:35.550> fairly<00:04:36.060> average

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
though because the m26 is fairly average

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.360 
though because the m26 is fairly average

as far as shotguns go and I definitely

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:39.950 
as far as shotguns go and I definitely

guys<00:04:44.460> in<00:04:44.820> close<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.300> you<00:04:45.420> can<00:04:45.570> help<00:04:45.720> it<00:04:45.930> both<00:04:46.410> of

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
guys in close if you can help it both of

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.020 
guys in close if you can help it both of
the<00:04:46.710> weapons<00:04:47.010> in<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.340> loadout<00:04:47.700> have<00:04:47.940> an

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
the weapons in this loadout have an

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.880 
the weapons in this loadout have an
advantage<00:04:48.330> and<00:04:48.720> mid<00:04:48.900> range<00:04:48.930> that<00:04:49.650> very

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
advantage and mid range that very

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.680 
advantage and mid range that very
quickly<00:04:50.190> disappears<00:04:50.790> the<00:04:50.970> closer<00:04:51.210> enemies

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
quickly disappears the closer enemies

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.230 
quickly disappears the closer enemies
get<00:04:51.960> also<00:04:52.800> both<00:04:53.070> of<00:04:53.250> these<00:04:53.370> guns<00:04:53.670> tend<00:04:54.000> to<00:04:54.090> run

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
get also both of these guns tend to run

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:56.210 
get also both of these guns tend to run
out<00:04:54.270> of<00:04:54.540> ammo<00:04:54.780> pretty<00:04:55.020> quickly<00:04:55.260> so<00:04:55.860> if<00:04:55.950> you<00:04:56.070> do

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
out of ammo pretty quickly so if you do

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:57.680 
out of ammo pretty quickly so if you do
see<00:04:56.430> an<00:04:56.550> ammo<00:04:56.790> box<00:04:56.940> make<00:04:57.240> sure<00:04:57.420> to<00:04:57.540> take

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
see an ammo box make sure to take

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.300 
see an ammo box make sure to take
advantage<00:04:57.720> of<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.470> and<00:04:58.650> fill<00:04:58.800> up<00:04:58.920> so<00:04:59.100> that<00:04:59.250> you

00:04:59.300 --> 00:04:59.310 
advantage of it and fill up so that you

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:01.520 
advantage of it and fill up so that you
don't<00:04:59.490> run<00:04:59.670> out<00:04:59.730> later<00:05:00.090> on<00:05:00.240> if<00:05:00.960> you<00:05:01.110> do<00:05:01.290> find

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
don't run out later on if you do find

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:03.050 
don't run out later on if you do find
yourself<00:05:01.680> running<00:05:02.250> out<00:05:02.340> of<00:05:02.460> ammo<00:05:02.730> and<00:05:02.940> you

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060 
yourself running out of ammo and you

00:05:03.060 --> 00:05:04.340 
yourself running out of ammo and you
aren't<00:05:03.390> close<00:05:03.540> quarters<00:05:04.020> then<00:05:04.140> you<00:05:04.230> can

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:04.350 
aren't close quarters then you can

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:06.830 
aren't close quarters then you can
always<00:05:04.560> switch<00:05:04.890> to<00:05:05.130> the<00:05:05.220> m26<00:05:05.850> and<00:05:06.150> save<00:05:06.630> your

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
always switch to the m26 and save your

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.660 
always switch to the m26 and save your
primary<00:05:07.230> rounds<00:05:07.560> for<00:05:07.710> mid-range<00:05:07.860> gunfights

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:08.670 
primary rounds for mid-range gunfights

00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.340 
primary rounds for mid-range gunfights
if<00:05:08.970> you're<00:05:09.540> out<00:05:09.660> in<00:05:09.690> the<00:05:09.840> open<00:05:09.930> though<00:05:10.290> you

if you're out in the open though you

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.860 
if you're out in the open though you
can't<00:05:10.710> really<00:05:10.950> rely<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.280> either<00:05:11.700> the<00:05:11.970> m26<00:05:12.600> or

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
can't really rely on either the m26 or

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:15.410 
can't really rely on either the m26 or
the<00:05:13.050> m1911<00:05:13.950> so<00:05:14.400> save<00:05:14.640> them<00:05:14.820> for<00:05:15.000> taking<00:05:15.150> out

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:15.420 
the m1911 so save them for taking out

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.360 
the m1911 so save them for taking out
enemies<00:05:15.840> by<00:05:15.990> surprise<00:05:16.020> or<00:05:16.740> for<00:05:16.920> finishing<00:05:17.190> off

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370 
enemies by surprise or for finishing off

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.120 
enemies by surprise or for finishing off
enemy<00:05:17.790> equipment<00:05:18.110> so<00:05:19.110> to<00:05:19.260> finish<00:05:19.500> up<00:05:19.740> if<00:05:20.010> I

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
enemy equipment so to finish up if I

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.650 
enemy equipment so to finish up if I
could<00:05:20.190> change<00:05:20.460> anything<00:05:20.850> well<00:05:21.210> like<00:05:21.450> I<00:05:21.600> said

00:05:21.650 --> 00:05:21.660 
could change anything well like I said

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:23.450 
could change anything well like I said
I'd<00:05:22.050> probably<00:05:22.230> throw<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.680> suppressor<00:05:23.250> on<00:05:23.280> the

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:23.460 
I'd probably throw a suppressor on the

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.000 
I'd probably throw a suppressor on the
sky<00:05:23.820> maybe<00:05:24.480> even<00:05:24.960> an<00:05:25.080> angled<00:05:25.410> grip<00:05:25.530> if<00:05:25.770> I<00:05:25.890> was

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.010 
sky maybe even an angled grip if I was

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:28.970 
sky maybe even an angled grip if I was
playing<00:05:26.190> on<00:05:26.430> PC<00:05:26.850> and<00:05:27.030> I'd<00:05:27.390> swap<00:05:27.660> out<00:05:27.840> the<00:05:28.020> m1911

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
playing on PC and I'd swap out the m1911

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.030 
playing on PC and I'd swap out the m1911
for<00:05:29.130> the<00:05:29.190> 93<00:05:29.670> arm<00:05:29.880> also<00:05:30.510> like<00:05:30.930> I<00:05:31.080> said<00:05:31.110> the<00:05:31.410> m26

00:05:32.030 --> 00:05:32.040 
for the 93 arm also like I said the m26

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:33.830 
for the 93 arm also like I said the m26
would<00:05:32.250> have<00:05:32.430> to<00:05:32.580> go<00:05:32.730> for<00:05:32.970> either<00:05:33.090> the<00:05:33.390> D<00:05:33.540> phoebs

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
would have to go for either the D phoebs

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.930 
would have to go for either the D phoebs
or<00:05:34.110> the<00:05:34.260> noob<00:05:34.410> tube<00:05:34.770> and<00:05:35.250> it<00:05:35.340> probably<00:05:35.730> also

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:35.940 
or the noob tube and it probably also

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:37.400 
or the noob tube and it probably also
replaced<00:05:36.480> the<00:05:36.660> fairly<00:05:36.990> ineffective

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:37.410 
replaced the fairly ineffective

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.350 
replaced the fairly ineffective
flashbangs<00:05:38.100> with<00:05:38.610> something<00:05:39.000> more<00:05:39.180> useful

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:39.360 
flashbangs with something more useful

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.450 
flashbangs with something more useful
like<00:05:39.600> the<00:05:39.870> smoke<00:05:40.110> grenades<00:05:40.470> all<00:05:41.070> in<00:05:41.310> all

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:41.460 
like the smoke grenades all in all

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:43.159 
like the smoke grenades all in all
though<00:05:41.640> this<00:05:41.820> loadout<00:05:42.180> was<00:05:42.450> pretty<00:05:42.690> fun<00:05:42.930> and

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:43.169 
though this loadout was pretty fun and

00:05:43.169 --> 00:05:44.720 
though this loadout was pretty fun and
challenging<00:05:43.650> to<00:05:43.800> play<00:05:43.980> with<00:05:44.220> and<00:05:44.460> it<00:05:44.550> wasn't

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:44.730 
challenging to play with and it wasn't

00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:46.550 
challenging to play with and it wasn't
interesting<00:05:45.300> to<00:05:45.419> do<00:05:45.510> some<00:05:45.690> research<00:05:46.080> into

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.560 
interesting to do some research into

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:48.320 
interesting to do some research into
such<00:05:46.860> a<00:05:46.890> new<00:05:47.160> special<00:05:47.550> forces<00:05:47.790> unit<00:05:48.180> like

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 
such a new special forces unit like

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:50.600 
such a new special forces unit like
MARSOC<00:05:48.930> if<00:05:49.200> you<00:05:49.680> do<00:05:49.830> like<00:05:50.040> the<00:05:50.190> sound<00:05:50.340> of<00:05:50.490> this

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:50.610 
MARSOC if you do like the sound of this

00:05:50.610 --> 00:05:52.130 
MARSOC if you do like the sound of this
loadout<00:05:50.940> then<00:05:51.180> definitely<00:05:51.390> give<00:05:51.690> it<00:05:51.810> a<00:05:51.870> try

00:05:52.130 --> 00:05:52.140 
loadout then definitely give it a try

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:53.960 
loadout then definitely give it a try
but<00:05:52.650> just<00:05:52.830> remember<00:05:53.130> to<00:05:53.250> play<00:05:53.400> cautiously

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:53.970 
but just remember to play cautiously

00:05:53.970 --> 00:05:56.180 
but just remember to play cautiously
because<00:05:54.180> the<00:05:54.480> sky<00:05:54.690> and<00:05:54.960> the<00:05:55.169> 1911<00:05:55.590> are

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
because the sky and the 1911 are

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.070 
because the sky and the 1911 are
definitely<00:05:56.760> not<00:05:56.880> guns<00:05:57.180> that<00:05:57.360> are<00:05:57.480> capable<00:05:57.630> of

00:05:58.070 --> 00:05:58.080 
definitely not guns that are capable of

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.590 
definitely not guns that are capable of
doing<00:05:58.260> all<00:05:58.590> of<00:05:58.620> the<00:05:58.890> work<00:05:58.919> for<00:05:59.340> you<00:05:59.550> but<00:06:00.300> anyway
