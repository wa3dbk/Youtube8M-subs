00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
can of formula read the ingredients

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:35.660 
can of formula read the ingredients
partially<00:01:34.140> hydrogenated<00:01:34.950> this<00:01:35.189> that<00:01:35.430> and<00:01:35.579> the

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
partially hydrogenated this that and the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.880 
partially hydrogenated this that and the
other<00:01:35.700> it's<00:01:36.450> like<00:01:36.689> being<00:01:37.049> at<00:01:37.170> McDonald's

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
obviously if you can't avoid it I will

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859

sort of my philosophy first is treating
your<00:02:09.570> child<00:02:09.869> as<00:02:10.080> I<00:02:10.170> would<00:02:10.380> my<00:02:10.560> own<00:02:10.640> now<00:02:11.640> what

this really means is

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.430 
this really means is
sometimes<00:02:16.019> in<00:02:16.200> medicine<00:02:18.050> sometimes<00:02:19.050> in

medicine we have approaches that are

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.290 
medicine we have approaches that are
sort<00:02:22.739> of<00:02:22.830> mainstream<00:02:23.550> but<00:02:24.000> it's<00:02:24.180> a

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
sort of mainstream but it's a

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.020 
sort of mainstream but it's a
one-size-fits-all<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:26.519> might<00:02:26.790> do

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
one-size-fits-all and I might do

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.670 
one-size-fits-all and I might do
something<00:02:27.420> different<00:02:27.810> from<00:02:27.870> my<00:02:28.050> own<00:02:28.170> children

you this is what everybody else is doing
but<00:02:38.879> here's<00:02:39.150> how<00:02:39.330> you<00:02:39.390> might<00:02:39.629> consider<00:02:40.049> doing

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
but here's how you might consider doing

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:41.750

this and I'll give you an example of

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:44.690 
this and I'll give you an example of
that<00:02:41.910> when<00:02:42.060> we<00:02:42.180> talk<00:02:42.360> about<00:02:42.410> immunizations<00:02:43.700> so

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
that when we talk about immunizations so

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.280 
that when we talk about immunizations so
the<00:02:44.819> other<00:02:44.970> thing<00:02:45.209> I<00:02:45.299> like<00:02:45.420> to<00:02:45.599> point<00:02:45.780> out<00:02:45.959> is

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
the other thing I like to point out is

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.680 
the other thing I like to point out is
we<00:02:46.709> cover<00:02:47.010> an<00:02:47.190> individualized<00:02:47.940> immunization

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
we cover an individualized immunization

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.120 
we cover an individualized immunization
schedule<00:02:49.170> which<00:02:49.319> we'll<00:02:49.500> talk<00:02:49.620> about<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.950> a

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
schedule which we'll talk about in a

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:52.610 
schedule which we'll talk about in a
minute<00:02:50.250> my<00:02:50.880> focus<00:02:51.329> is<00:02:51.480> to<00:02:51.510> avoid<00:02:51.900> antibiotics

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
minute my focus is to avoid antibiotics

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.979

if<00:02:52.739> at<00:02:52.890> all<00:02:52.920> possible<00:02:53.549> we<00:02:53.760> have<00:02:53.970> a<00:02:54.120> CBC<00:02:54.630> machine

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
if at all possible we have a CBC machine

00:02:54.989 --> 00:02:57.650 
if at all possible we have a CBC machine
