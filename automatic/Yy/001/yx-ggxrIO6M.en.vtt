00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.990
 today we are going to make some lentils with 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.170
 vegetables to the ankle for that we're going to 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:15.950
 need 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:19.400
 lentils previously soaked with that 

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:22.220
 three horitas are taken is sufficient 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:27.330
 leek a zucchini a carrot 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:32.940
 little green beans onion some garlic 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:35.430
 Salt pepper and paprika first thing 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.790
 we have done is to put the thyme to boil 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:43.250
 to make a strong infusion for 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.250
 pour it into the water of the lentils 

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.470
 let's take 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:50.060
 in water 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:56.240
 we are going to cook slowly with 

00:00:54.550 --> 00:01:00.400
 a little salt 

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:00.400
 we will already incorporate the vegetables 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:06.330
 can be thrown in a group or else 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.880
 fry them 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.910
 but I like to go hard because 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.970
 at home we do not throw a jet on appointment 

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:19.330
 of oil not much 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:22.260
 for the lentils and we put them to cook 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.260
 slowly 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.950
 and we also miss it 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.049
 lentils 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.710
 we have incorporated the onion and now we 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:37.710
 we toss the whole garlic 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.180
 and now let's incorporate the infusion 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:46.180
 from thyme 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:52.790
 and we'll let it boil until it's 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.790
 made 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:06.850
 catching are done then now I have 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.050
 put to fry a little bit of garlic in very 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.890
 little oil 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.460
 and when I'm fried, I'm going to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.460
 peppers 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.150
 in fact the paprika and those separated from the 

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.430
 fire so you do not burn the paprika 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:28.230
 simply to be done with the heat and 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:32.630
 Now I 'm going to take a drop of wine 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.630
 but a droplet nothing else like that 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:43.060
 and now I have done it to the lentils 

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:45.599
 We have already rehashed the 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.599
 lentils 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.950
 and now we're going to take a drop of 

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:55.560
 pepper for people 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.810
 that the resource can not take much salt 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.140
 is to add a little pepper drop 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:01.180
 a lot 

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:04.120
 and so you do not have to throw so much salt at 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.810
 the food then if we see that we have been 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.329
 stayed a little 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:13.239
 liquidate the lentils we can 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:17.829
 pour a little seaweed to gara in 

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:19.120
 place of flour because it is so healthier and 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:21.939
 for people who have problems 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.230
 of diabetes do not want to get fat 

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:25.930
 much better 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:29.670
 this is the agar agar as it sounds 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.940
 and nobody takes a few small pieces 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:35.819
 with this is enough of agar-agar 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.770
 to throw and thicken a bit what 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.870
 cut into pieces and we throw 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:46.220
 inside good now we are going to leave 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.870
 well to rest to me I like that is in 

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:49.580
 finish doing an hour earlier to 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:53.680
 rest because that way he takes all the 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.680
 taste and then warm up a little 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.540
 let's eat now 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:03.920
 healthy 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.799
 the people who do not want to get fat
