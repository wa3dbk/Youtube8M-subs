00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
name of the service that I'm gonna be

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.550 
name of the service that I'm gonna be
doing<00:01:31.400> here<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:31.850> the<00:01:32.330> first<00:01:32.600> port<00:01:33.020> is<00:01:33.200> gonna

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
doing here and the first port is gonna

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.450 
doing here and the first port is gonna
be<00:01:33.740> port<00:01:34.040> 80<00:01:34.310> and<00:01:35.140> then<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.650> ending<00:01:36.980> port<00:01:37.280> is

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
be port 80 and then the ending port is

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:43.200 
be port 80 and then the ending port is
the<00:01:37.670> same<00:01:37.880> 80<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:39.160> these<00:01:40.160> are<00:01:40.340> for<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.610> TCP<00:01:42.160> so

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:43.210 
the same 80 and these are for the TCP so

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.880 
the same 80 and these are for the TCP so
we<00:01:44.210> need<00:01:44.360> to<00:01:44.600> choose<00:01:45.050> that<00:01:45.260> as<00:01:45.410> the<00:01:45.530> protocol

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
we need to choose that as the protocol

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.110 
we need to choose that as the protocol
and<00:01:46.370> then<00:01:47.270> you<00:01:47.420> need<00:01:47.570> your<00:01:47.750> IP<00:01:47.960> address<00:01:48.410> here

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
and then you need your IP address here

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.510 
and then you need your IP address here
so<00:01:50.120> make<00:01:50.300> sure<00:01:50.330> you<00:01:50.600> get<00:01:50.810> your<00:01:50.990> IP<00:01:51.200> address<00:01:51.590> by

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
so make sure you get your IP address by

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.570 
so make sure you get your IP address by
going<00:01:52.910> into<00:01:53.060> command<00:01:53.570> prompt<00:01:54.160> so<00:01:55.160> if<00:01:55.280> you<00:01:55.400> want

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:55.580 
going into command prompt so if you want

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.970 
going into command prompt so if you want
to<00:01:55.640> type<00:01:55.820> CMD<00:01:56.360> there<00:01:56.630> and<00:01:56.870> open<00:01:57.140> it<00:01:57.260> up<00:01:57.380> and

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:57.980 
to type CMD there and open it up and

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:07.780 
to type CMD there and open it up and
then<00:01:58.070> type<00:01:58.400> IP<00:01:59.050> con<00:02:00.050> fig<00:02:02.200> space<00:02:04.840> /al<00:02:06.790> inside

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:07.790 
then type IP con fig space /al inside

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.430 
then type IP con fig space /al inside
here

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
here

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.610 
here
you'll<00:02:09.920> find<00:02:10.310> your<00:02:10.700> IP<00:02:10.940> address<00:02:11.690> the<00:02:12.440> local

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
you'll find your IP address the local

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:15.390 
you'll find your IP address the local
gateway<00:02:13.220> I<00:02:13.520> think<00:02:14.060> is<00:02:14.270> the<00:02:14.690> default<00:02:15.020> gateway

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:15.400 
gateway I think is the default gateway

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380 
gateway I think is the default gateway
that's<00:02:16.400> for<00:02:16.910> most<00:02:17.090> machines<00:02:18.520> but<00:02:19.520> if<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:20.150> are

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:20.390 
that's for most machines but if you are

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.840 
that's for most machines but if you are
like<00:02:20.600> me<00:02:20.870> and<00:02:21.140> you<00:02:21.200> are<00:02:21.650> in<00:02:22.160> a<00:02:22.310> residential

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
like me and you are in a residential

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:26.200 
like me and you are in a residential
gateway<00:02:24.070> this<00:02:25.070> that<00:02:25.430> means<00:02:25.640> that<00:02:25.820> this<00:02:25.970> was

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:26.210 
gateway this that means that this was

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.650 
gateway this that means that this was
provided<00:02:26.840> to<00:02:26.870> me<00:02:27.080> by<00:02:27.260> my<00:02:27.680> ISP<00:02:28.430> then<00:02:29.060> I<00:02:29.090> need<00:02:29.450> to

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
provided to me by my ISP then I need to

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.190 
provided to me by my ISP then I need to
use<00:02:29.900> the<00:02:30.140> one<00:02:30.320> that<00:02:30.500> says<00:02:31.030> ipv4<00:02:32.030> and<00:02:32.390> it's

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
use the one that says ipv4 and it's

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.430 
use the one that says ipv4 and it's
preferred<00:02:34.360> so<00:02:35.360> if<00:02:35.420> you<00:02:35.510> look<00:02:35.720> here<00:02:35.750> it's<00:02:36.080> dot

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
preferred so if you look here it's dot

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.550 
preferred so if you look here it's dot
seven<00:02:36.980> in<00:02:37.130> the<00:02:37.310> end<00:02:37.490> instead<00:02:37.790> of<00:02:38.150> dot<00:02:38.450> one<00:02:38.720> so

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
seven in the end instead of dot one so

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.680 
seven in the end instead of dot one so
just<00:02:39.950> be<00:02:40.130> aware<00:02:40.160> of<00:02:40.430> that<00:02:40.700> that<00:02:40.970> if<00:02:41.360> you<00:02:41.450> bought

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
just be aware of that that if you bought

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.500 
just be aware of that that if you bought
your<00:02:41.810> own<00:02:41.990> router<00:02:42.260> its<00:02:42.740> dot<00:02:43.040> one<00:02:43.310> or<00:02:43.580> you<00:02:44.360> know

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
your own router its dot one or you know

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:47.050 
your own router its dot one or you know
whatever<00:02:44.720> the<00:02:44.930> address<00:02:45.140> is<00:02:45.530> therefore<00:02:46.160> to<00:02:46.910> get

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
whatever the address is therefore to get

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:51.720 
whatever the address is therefore to get
into<00:02:47.330> this<00:02:47.480> and<00:02:47.750> for<00:02:48.740> mine<00:02:49.240> it's<00:02:50.240> actually<00:02:50.930> dot

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
into this and for mine it's actually dot

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.150 
into this and for mine it's actually dot
seven<00:02:52.730> and<00:02:52.910> you<00:02:53.900> know<00:02:54.020> what<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.680> may<00:02:54.860> change

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
seven and you know what that may change

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.940 
seven and you know what that may change
so<00:02:55.580> make<00:02:55.910> sure<00:02:55.940> that<00:02:56.300> you<00:02:56.540> get<00:02:57.170> your<00:02:57.350> proper<00:02:57.740> IP

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
so make sure that you get your proper IP

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.860 
so make sure that you get your proper IP
address<00:02:58.550> I<00:02:58.730> may<00:02:59.000> be<00:02:59.060> talking<00:02:59.330> a<00:02:59.570> bunch<00:02:59.690> of

address I may be talking a bunch of

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.740 
address I may be talking a bunch of
gibberish<00:03:00.020> there<00:03:00.440> but<00:03:01.010> anyways<00:03:01.340> minus<00:03:02.330> seven

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:02.750 
gibberish there but anyways minus seven

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.300 
gibberish there but anyways minus seven
and<00:03:02.870> I<00:03:03.110> know<00:03:03.170> that<00:03:03.410> much<00:03:03.620> and<00:03:03.860> I'm<00:03:03.950> gonna<00:03:04.040> add

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:04.310 
and I know that much and I'm gonna add

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.310 
and I know that much and I'm gonna add
that<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.730> then<00:03:04.790> that's<00:03:05.360> the<00:03:05.600> first<00:03:05.870> one<00:03:06.110> as

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:11.960 
mean my first rule here on this service

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:16.780 
mean my first rule here on this service
bf3<00:03:13.240> 8080<00:03:14.240> TCP<00:03:14.990> and<00:03:15.200> that's<00:03:15.560> the<00:03:15.740> IP<00:03:15.920> now<00:03:16.640> we're

bf3 8080 TCP and that's the IP now we're
going<00:03:16.880> to<00:03:16.970> do<00:03:17.090> the<00:03:17.210> next<00:03:17.420> one<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.670> I'm<00:03:19.670> gonna

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:19.850 
going to do the next one so I'm gonna

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:21.490 
going to do the next one so I'm gonna
pause<00:03:20.150> this<00:03:20.360> video<00:03:20.570> and<00:03:20.930> once<00:03:21.110> I<00:03:21.200> have<00:03:21.410> them

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500 
pause this video and once I have them

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:25.330 
pause this video and once I have them
all<00:03:21.680> done<00:03:21.740> I'll<00:03:22.420> could<00:03:23.420> jump<00:03:23.630> back<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.190> so<00:03:25.190> go

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:25.340 
all done I'll could jump back in so go

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.690 
all done I'll could jump back in so go
ahead<00:03:25.460> and<00:03:25.610> do<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.440> okay<00:03:27.440> so<00:03:28.250> now<00:03:28.460> that<00:03:28.520> I

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
ahead and do that okay so now that I

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.300 
ahead and do that okay so now that I
finish<00:03:29.150> adding<00:03:29.390> all<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:30.050> ports<00:03:30.530> as<00:03:30.740> you<00:03:31.100> can

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
finish adding all the ports as you can

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.630 
finish adding all the ports as you can
see<00:03:31.550> that's<00:03:31.760> a<00:03:31.910> pretty<00:03:31.940> big<00:03:32.390> list<00:03:33.490> just<00:03:34.490> pay

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:34.640 
see that's a pretty big list just pay

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:36.720 
see that's a pretty big list just pay
attention<00:03:34.700> to<00:03:35.240> the<00:03:35.390> one<00:03:35.600> that<00:03:35.870> says<00:03:36.110> like

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
attention to the one that says like

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:40.510 
attention to the one that says like
twenty<00:03:37.730> thousand<00:03:38.360> then<00:03:38.990> it<00:03:39.140> has<00:03:39.290> a<00:03:39.320> -<00:03:39.590> twenty

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:40.520 
twenty thousand then it has a - twenty

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.250 
twenty thousand then it has a - twenty
thousand<00:03:40.940> one<00:03:41.060> hundred<00:03:41.240> because<00:03:41.990> that's<00:03:42.140> a

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:42.260 
thousand one hundred because that's a

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.320 
thousand one hundred because that's a
range<00:03:42.530> that<00:03:42.920> means<00:03:43.580> you<00:03:43.730> have<00:03:43.850> to<00:03:44.000> put<00:03:44.209> the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:44.330 
range that means you have to put the

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.510 
range that means you have to put the
starting<00:03:44.720> port<00:03:44.930> as<00:03:45.200> the<00:03:45.530> twenty<00:03:45.860> thousand<00:03:46.340> and

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:46.520 
starting port as the twenty thousand and

00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:48.670 
starting port as the twenty thousand and
the<00:03:46.760> end<00:03:46.910> port<00:03:47.240> as<00:03:47.420> the<00:03:47.750> twenty<00:03:48.110> thousand<00:03:48.560> one

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
the end port as the twenty thousand one

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:50.800 
the end port as the twenty thousand one
hundred<00:03:48.920> and<00:03:49.760> for<00:03:50.000> the<00:03:50.090> other<00:03:50.270> ones<00:03:50.480> if<00:03:50.660> it

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
hundred and for the other ones if it

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:54.160 
hundred and for the other ones if it
just<00:03:50.959> has<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.440> port<00:03:51.830> number<00:03:52.570> that's<00:03:53.570> just<00:03:53.870> what

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:54.170 
just has a port number that's just what

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:56.500 
just has a port number that's just what
you're<00:03:54.320> gonna<00:03:54.470> use<00:03:54.709> for<00:03:54.950> both<00:03:55.420> for<00:03:56.420> the

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:56.510 
you're gonna use for both for the

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.420 
you're gonna use for both for the
starting<00:03:56.900> and<00:03:57.080> for<00:03:57.350> the<00:03:57.470> end<00:03:57.620> what<00:03:58.340> I'm

00:03:58.420 --> 00:03:58.430 
starting and for the end what I'm
