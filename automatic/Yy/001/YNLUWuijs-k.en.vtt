00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.560
 very good people good today I bring you a 

00:00:03.939 --> 00:00:07.029
 tutorial for the main crack that based on 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.340
 the installation of a three map 

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:11.469
 capital and good here in this way in 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.380
 concrete then we when we go to 

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:16.270
 cut a tree so that we remove the 

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.760
 prima unit of the tree we can throw the 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.680
 tree below and collect the units from 

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.200
 trunk plus the shoppings of that tree 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.420
 It's very good because we do not have to go 

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.480
 one by one removing all the beers 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.370
 and all the trunks and so they could 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:33.310
 follow faster to pick up a bunch 

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:36.370
 of wood and it is already good for 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:37.470
 install this we have to go here and 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.320
 good 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:43.620
 I will leave you the three modes is worth my black 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.510
 force the bsp fall and the caption that 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:49.050
 they need these three more to install 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.020
 this mod and good if we do not have all three 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.520
 very installed will not work 

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.550
 we will have here is worth the link of the mini 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:59.070
 craft force the bs and the trick 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.080
 capi hector or download it I have 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.720
 downloaded a folder to the desktop 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:06.570
 call pull capital same and good 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.270
 we have the three files here once 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:12.060
 I already had this I'm going to install vale 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:13.800
 for version 162 that I have here but 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.740
 well this tutorial is worth it also serves 

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.080
 for future versions like 1718 and 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.810
 all that since I will leave you in the links 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 of the discharges of future pressures 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.580
 plus the installation mode which is the 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.980
 there is no difference then 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.860
 well let's install this 

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:34.290
 we will install microphones quickly not 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.210
 I'm going to put on things but good 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.750
 in the description of channels I will leave a 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.810
 tutorial microphones that explains everything 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.790
 in detail how she installs she is 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:48.710
 little hectic proof mini craft force 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:52.140
 ok and we install a secondary button 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.810
 I would accept java and we will install 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:57.300
 client we install in the directory of 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.590
 micro and is already started intra salma 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.800
 ok because you have to install in the 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.390
 folder mods the other two following 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.090
 well, we give it here to profile 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.100
 we load the micro force and when it 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:10.740
 start for the first time in minicross 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.380
 force we will create the amos folder for 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.670
 put it others 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:16.890
 we give to play 

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:18.790
 and we wait for the client to start 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.920
 with the forge 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.959
 is already finishing downloading all 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:24.700
 the chivas forges and starts by 

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.310
 first time 

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:28.840
 let's go here we have the mini kraft 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.920
 forums with the three modes that come by 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.780
 defect of forge and you even have to close 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.319
 all the customer to install the others 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.780
 mods because if we do not close the two no no 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.610
 we are loaded these two new well 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.950
 you have to copy these two modes worth 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.660
 inside the directory mods folder 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.640
 minecraft gets the directory of 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.519
 minecraft then you have to put this 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.380
 percentage to pepe data percentage in the 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:56.620
 searched for windows that would be down here 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:59.440
 go to him and once you give him the 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:02.170
 percentage of pvp data percentage 

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:04.540
 you give lenses and until you get there and it's there 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.180
 this would be a windows 7 like I have 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.720
 windows 8 of and here run the task 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:13.900
 accept and it would take me exactly here 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:17.470
 that when he says to the entity we go here 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.420
 it's worth once here we see the folder 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:22.970
 minecraft point that you have to go into 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.070
 her and once here in the mod folder 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.990
 there is nothing here inside good 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.290
 depending on whether you install more 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:34.100
 mafioso and you have to install these two 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:36.140
 mods the tri capi and take the other one so what 

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:37.820
 we copy what we put here into the 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:40.340
 map folder and see how easy it is 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.930
 install it with him forge and now 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:43.440
 we started what is the game of 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:46.080
 Minecraft 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.300
 and we will even be charged with the profile of 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:53.430
 forges we initiate 

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.430
 we started to start the client 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.860
 we put this in big 

00:03:58.740 --> 00:04:04.860
 and well here we see 5 max are worth 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.950
 the deals forge the bs and the tri 

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.350
 capital vale we start the huge game and 

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.330
 current and we enter this game that 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:14.850
 I created 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:17.340
 Once here, here we have the two 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:21.180
 pallet stars and to cut down this tree 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.090
 we have to give the ax here and we 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:27.090
 would start from a blow we give here and it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.310
 apart from me as I am in creative 

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:33.300
 it's very fast but we're going to 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.449
 take away from scratch 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.909
 I will explain one thing when we give 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:40.949
 here the trunk is worth against higher or 

00:04:38.909 --> 00:04:43.590
 it takes longer to remove the first 

00:04:40.949 --> 00:04:46.650
 unit as if you will remove this unit 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.050
 of trunk more is more this and all the 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.090
 that has although the time against more 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.729
 longer it will take to remove the first 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.190
 trunk unit but good we 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:57.960
 we will forget to be cutting the other 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:00.840
 units and rising up and that 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.580
 let's go here satalaya everything and we have 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.069
 released all the trunks and sap links 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:09.240
 for the same thing happens with this unit of 

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:11.370
 trunk that goes little by little because in 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:14.400
 it's really like I was cutting three 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.650
 or four trunk units and when 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.139
 it's all we all walk in more 

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:22.500
 the trunk units if you want more 

00:05:19.139 --> 00:05:26.220
 fast as well are diamond axes 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.110
 same you will go faster to soft 

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.540
 how pretty 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.580
 and until we would have the whole cut 

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:35.850
 this tree the same as this there will be 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.680
 about 5 or 6 units and where there with the 

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:40.230
 ax quickly we would have everything 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:43.140
 cut and nothing is on the property of the 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:46.230
 tri capi eto'o and so we can have a 

00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.090
 amount trunk units in nothing 

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:50.460
 with a people I hope you liked it 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.800
 this tutorial since he explained 

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:55.650
 perfectly this how badly it installs and 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.200
 everything and good agent I hope to see you in
