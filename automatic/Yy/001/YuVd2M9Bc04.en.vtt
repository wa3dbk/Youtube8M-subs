00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:05.730
 I don't want to use an injection molding simulator 

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:10.419
 show you what happens when we try to set a profile of 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:13.789
 temperature for injection molding 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:21.279
 suppose we use a 120 ton press a one mold for the 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:25.449
 production of field plates in peril usually used 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:28.060
 material testing laboratory 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:34.110
 3 as a polymer we use naples - hotel rimini 500 of the merry yes 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.920
 it's an acetal resin 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 obtained from the polymerization of formaldehyde 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.960
 the beautiful in 500 nomo medium viscosity polymer has given many applications of 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.230
 injection molding to set the temperature profile 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:56.010
 we need to know some basic data of our material these 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.610
 long these data are generally provided by the manufacturer or can be 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.420
 derived laboratories 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.990
 suppose we print with the conditions currently set and we see that 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.460
 in our have the melt temperature and equal to 200 11 degrees suppose 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.920
 now to increase the temperature of all resistances by 5 degrees 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.119
 let's see what happens to the temperature of the stem 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.969
 the temperature of the melt or mental d about 4, 1 degrees passing add 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:43.910
 215 eng 215 now suppose we do other mental and 5 degrees la 

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.070
 temperature via the melt and see what happens to the temperature of the 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.070
 resistances we see what was not the temperature of the stem 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.560
 inger wendy are in this simulator there are three different temperatures of the 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.000
 resistance that correspond to the area behind the central zone and to the 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.790
 front area of ​​the master store but in reality there may also be a 

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.570
 higher number of resistance if this depends on the length adele 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:17.940
 on the store and therefore from the number of bands and thermals we want to control 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.829
 we try to print with the new conditions set and we see that the 

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:29.839
 temperature from sd 219, 2 degrees that is the freezing temperature of about 8 free 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:37.029
 let's now try every tazzone of each resistance of 20 degrees 

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:41.049
 compared to the temperature from which we started 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.810
 sign in do across this simulator that we can estimate 

00:02:45.809 --> 00:02:49.479
 what will be the final value of the drum temperature 

00:02:58.789 --> 00:03:02.980
 the temperature of the melt is 227, 4 free 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:08.930
 that is, increased by six, 4 degrees with respect to the initial temperature
