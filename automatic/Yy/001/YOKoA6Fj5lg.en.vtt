 you haven't seen it yet go to it a 

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.100

 boys crack 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.809

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.690
 or at least talk to us in his channel that is 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.579
 really really very good but 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.499
 especially very helpful 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.749
 I really fell in love with 

00:00:44.499 --> 00:00:48.460
 of the new intro and I hope nothing 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:50.679
 like it but now let's move on to the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.050
 video now first of all this nawar 

00:00:50.679 --> 00:00:56.620
 made against a clan of Malaysia mi 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:58.149
 looks and won by us 22 21 boy one 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.659
 sincere I was a few days ago it 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.519
 to the clan 

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.139
 so I just got back and this one though 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:03.579
 I did not see her 

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:06.490
 here we are still going to see 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:08.770
 together as he entered without replay 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.520
 have not even seen them so I hope that 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:14.320
 there in this way you can say see 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.350
 the better there is one can analyze pegli 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.580
 in live and then they come out a lot 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.770
 better this way 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.810
 ok let's go and see maybe i 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.700
 best attacks have told me there is 

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.950
 It was a really very nice attack 

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:30.220
 of robbie we go to see him maybe 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.380
 here it was our logic 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:36.820
 fifth attacked their third is 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.560
 attached however with a wipe ship with 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:40.690
 with a pair of hot air balloons to do 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.490
 choose from the clan a few too 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.890
 some tamers and maybe even them 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.700
 he used to get their suns out 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:51.640
 I don't know and then he still had the neighbor 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.920
 and we are two pure fury a leap is 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.350
 the tissue for the 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.290
 the clan here as you can see managed to do 

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.060
 his troops out of the clan and the ditches 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.549
 re immediately say let's go outside 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.350
 towards the two golems he puts in the corner 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:06.259
 top right 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.880
 here certainly poison is now evening 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.160
 we say to kill them all and I hope 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.260
 because I see that they are hit anyway 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.870
 the time here I have not yet used 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.270
 the poison I did n't see if they came out 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.100
 that is all the troops of the clan but not 

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:21.840
 I think because personally some arc 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:24.360
 so maybe they didn't all come out 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.420
 so I don't know about it later 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.739
 and decides to tame the trainer a little now 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.200
 is a little the tamer on the left for the 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:33.090
 anyway a cannon escapes I don't know if there is 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.209
 indeed it succeeds neither to the right nor to 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.390
 left succeeds in fact fails pull 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.040
 the two flaws one goes we take outside europe 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.680
 towards the center then say a very good one 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.120
 take leap let's say three pieces of 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.060
 wall and in fact here I read the boys do not 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:49.950
 were there all the troops they have so 

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:53.640
 pulls a good poison that takes them 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.160
 practically all the boys recommend e 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.799
 after however the addition of this of the 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.540
 new black barracks resign in the clan 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:02.850
 in the case of the clan, however, a dragon 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.400
 maybe a hot air balloon because anyway 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.269
 they read you more 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:09.630
 let's say with the addition of this new one 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.700
 option and very often troops already a 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.489
 are destroyed badly and 

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.709
 really very little time since da 

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:18.030
 however the potion therefore does not 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.340
 I advise you not to use it also because 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.709
 however this potion use it there 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.450
 take away we say the possibility of having i 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.209
 usual two also he out or in any case the 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.160
 a few 4 normal potions so it's one 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.500
 come in very very strong we say 

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.910
 on a hot air balloon dragon doesn't 

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:37.500
 much but on troops like magicians thugs 

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:39.630
 archers also because it also takes the 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.340
 air troops really hurt like 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:44.970
 see you went to do two stars a lot 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.400
 very beautiful and maybe see a nice 3 

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:51.750
 stars if we go to see this here 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:53.370
 on their 8 from our 8 ok it's either 

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:57.120
 to see it was a 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.250
 a town hall viii ok a ricci is ours 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:01.080
 in any case, now our hall is ours 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:04.200
 municipality ix recently passed anyway 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:07.920
 municipio ix to decide to attack with 34 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:09.690
 however tamers at level 4 who are 

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:13.400
 really very very strong 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:17.160
 let's say the strongest tactic to say 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.989
 attack level 8 municipalities and me 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.989
 I always have almost 6 also attached with i 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:23.669
 dragons, however, I really saw that 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.580
 sticking with tamers really is 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.770
 much simpler even with those max 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.199
 ati that still have a village 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.030
 very compact and here as you see him 

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:35.310
 manages to enter the center of the 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.780
 village immediately sucking of troops of the 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.479
 clan with the usual poison it is 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.460
 really very strong and then tell everyone 

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.650
 let us say the tamers in the same place 

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:46.560
 which certainly will go to 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:49.560
 enlarge and being a municipality ix 

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.660
 also 44 cures so it's much more 

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:55.440
 simple for him to go and do the 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:57.180
 police complete with all defenses i 

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:59.460
 still another one still remains 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.229
 still many tamers therefore succeed 

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:03.150
 to easily take all the defenses 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:05.789
 Reggio team and a few magicians 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.440
 behind it really cleans everything then a 

00:05:05.789 --> 00:05:09.389
 100 percent very very nice but 

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.150
 simple enough to receive 

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:15.240
 repeat a town hall ix anyway passed 

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:17.460
 recently and therefore a very good 3 star rating not 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.750
 difficult I repeat is ok 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:24.090
 here they are arouse the two stars is perfect 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:27.599
 3 stars by ricci but see a 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:30.750
 another attack and maybe see this here 

00:05:27.599 --> 00:05:32.460
 on their 10 and even see maybe if there is 

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:36.120
 some municipality ix that attacks the 

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:37.800
 town hall ix their municipality sorry 

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.630
 yes ok perfect this is a three star 

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:43.410
 made by one of our moss 8 against the 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:46.199
 their moss 8 is the attack is given 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:48.870
 chris and decided to stick with one 

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.430
 simple wipe is this here guys and a 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.680
 quite enough village that of 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:55.200
 not very strong enemy but still a lot 

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.630
 wide and therefore not simple 

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.370
 attack these villages but with one 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:02.250
 pipe let's say if he played enough 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:04.050
 well it's not at all difficult as you see 

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:05.940
 he had all ground troops 

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:07.950
 I think now with a leandra poison 

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:13.980
 to exterminate practically all if there 

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:16.170
 will use I do not see the poison to see if and 

00:06:13.980 --> 00:06:17.490
 when he uses it he saw that he didn't 

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:20.520
 is using the tissue we are enough 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:22.440
 strange how what decided not to use 

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.630
 see you I don't understand why 

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:25.950
 however he manages to go straight to the 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:27.300
 center of the village that I am here 

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.610
 anyway he had some bombs 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:32.040
 really badly in front of the town hall 

00:06:29.610 --> 00:06:33.510
 because I am absolutely useless and 

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.460
 will surely go to get the 

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:38.040
 heavier troops of the troops as 

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:40.400
 the magicians who destroy from afar 

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:44.370
 so really a provision 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:46.830
 horrible anti three stars mabo we are if 

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.770
 he also attacks you this way 

00:06:46.830 --> 00:06:51.510
 do you think that was not even the work 

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:52.830
 and eno then attaches in this way 

00:06:51.510 --> 00:06:55.410
 they make you three stars very much 

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:57.930
 simple and no kids here now 

00:06:55.410 --> 00:07:00.240
 the three will arrive between bing seconds 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:03.480
 stars therefore a great find 

00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.130
 account this say chris no boys 

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:08.220
 I tell you guys anyway that it is 

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:09.510
 really late I decided today not 

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.280
 I wanted to get videos out because really 

00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:13.140
 I'm very tired but I've decided anyway 

00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:15.240
 to start making this video because 

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:16.920
