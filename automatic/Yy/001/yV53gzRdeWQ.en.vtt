00:00:02.690 --> 00:00:07.220
 but ask the questions now starting 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:10.850
 for the first one is how do you feel 

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:13.640
 after signing for the liverpool 

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:16.360
 I feel right now that I was stuck 

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:20.180
 in a bubble that I just came out 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:25.070
 for me the liverpool or was a top team 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:27.110
 and where did he get that right now because now 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.350
 I want to enjoy it to the fullest 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.090
 all right 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:36.070
 thanks to this as they have been the last 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 24 hours for you because with many nerves 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.940
 when I've never had one and today 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.340
 changed everything in these 24 hours but 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:46.450
 happy not right now I think I'm the 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:48.730
 happiest man on earth 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.950

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:04.530
 thrilling to come to come to the 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:07.320
 best club in the world and 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:10.260
 to live now another story is not a 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.290
 adventure but in which I have to finish 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:15.200
