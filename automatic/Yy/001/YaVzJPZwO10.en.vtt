00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 hello everyone today I bring you the video 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.290
 about the facial routine that is a video 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.970
 that they have asked me very much and good as 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.010
 I always say I hope you find it useful 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:13.139
 this is the routine that I follow all the 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.750
 mornings later later I will leave the 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 Nocturnal routine I start washing well 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.949
 the face with a soap that is quite 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.130
 I've been using it for 67 years 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:26.849
 months and I feel very good is a soap 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:28.710
 olive and it's organic you know that 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:30.810
 I am always defending the natural 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.960
 then he rinsed my face well with water 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.790
 the water is life after I'm going to take the 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.430
 microfiber cloth that has been 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.960
 become my ally I love it very 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:42.570
 girls try it for you to see 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.270
 It's a little cloth that practically goes to 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.910
 do an exfoliation as if it were a 

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.829
 physical peeling because it will remove all 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.199
 the dead skin cells but what 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.850
 better than we are given of this cloth is that 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.649
 since I'm using it, they have not 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.719
 left more the black points the 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.789
 pimples pimples and all those 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.190
 things and that's why I concentrate on 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.439
 the areas where it usually accumulates 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.830
 the fat that is on the side of the nose and 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.090
 in him 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.700
 and then I'm going to take my two oils and 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.380
 As you can see there are some concepts 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.870
 of refrigerated as is the oil of 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:18.090
 jojoba and rosehip oil 

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.970
 because they are the oils that 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.320
 easily photos are sensitized that 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.350
 grows that with light changes in 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.930
 consistency odor color etc that are cast 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.760
 to lose also refrigerated I have the 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.470
 Aloe I 've also talked to you a lot 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.810
 of her but good in the morning routine 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:37.260
 what I use is this cream 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:39.420
 moisturizer and mixed it with the oil 

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:41.460
 rosehip to me I love to add 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.110
 the natural oils to the creams that 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.870
 I use because in this way we are going to 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.360
 enhance the moisturizing character 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.400
 protective soothing nutrient and so on 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.880
 have the cream how is daddy is 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.580
 in this case rosehip oil 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:58.680
 has a regenerative power that is to say that 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.750
 will rejuvenate the skin will stimulate 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:02.550
 the growth of new cells and 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:04.470
 it also has a whitening character 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.630
 therefore I am doing great 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.760
 because I'm trying to fight 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.800
 the spots on the skin because I already have 

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:13.500
 a certain age 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.270
 s also added one or two droplets of 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.370
 lemon essential oil 

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:19.440
 also adding the oils to the 

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:21.600
 creams make them a little bit more 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.060
 endorsed citations that penetrate more 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.040
 slowly on the skin and therefore I 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.900
 will leave the time to do this 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.270
 a massage that little boys are also very 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:32.130
 important to massage the skin because we're going 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.260
 to activate the circulation and we are going to 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.720
 drain more easily the toxins and 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.230
 liquids as you see here I'm throwing the 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.970
 cream also on the neck is very 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.070
 important not to leave behind the neck that 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.490
 that is another area that also wrinkles and 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:49.320
 the hands this creame is the maximum 

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:51.210
 that girls who live in europe and 

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:53.040
 have access to the cob that are these 

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.200
 supermarkets where they sell them then 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.210
 take advantage of the first ingredient that 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.100
 it contains water and this is something 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.500
 super positive the second is the 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.150
 glycerin and a lot and break a party 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.700
 that we already know is the butter 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.280
 shea and in stock or ferrol which is the 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.080
 In short, I do not bore you with everything 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.670
 this of the ingredients also because 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.500
 I remind you that I already have a video 

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.790
 done where he explained what are the 

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.739
 ingredients in the creams that we should 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.670
 avoid and good explained them also how 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:19.590
 read the link 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.209
 it is important to learn to read the 

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:23.489
 ingredients in the creams because it's the 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.520
 only way we have to choose from 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.800
 intelligently shape effectively the 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.959
 cream that we are going to take in the skin 

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:32.880
 the next step would be to place the 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.620
 sunscreen if we are going out 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:37.260
 remember that you have to protect the skin 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.690
 of the sun and then you can move on to 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.489
 good makeup and chirrinchi RNE 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.890
 finished the video if you thought 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:46.620
 interesting this video denle I like 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:49.769
 well I know it and I could record them the 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.870
 video of the night routine where they 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.330
 I would show the whole part of how I 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.190
 desmaquillo a s13 is a good kiss 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:01.370
 big see you in the next one tweet 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:04:01.370
 by not in the mind
