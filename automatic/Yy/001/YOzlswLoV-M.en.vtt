00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 hello everyone with you again max and channel 

00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:08.130
 beardcam here and come monday how are you 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.650
 understand as always on mondays at 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:11.880
 me a video report about the use 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:20.400
 beard minoxidil 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:22.740
 today is week 6 as you already see i 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:23.340
 tamed his beard thanks to that I could 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.300
 notice 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:30.599
 more visible changes when there was 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.329
 long beard was difficult really 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.840
 evaluate changes because long 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.270
 hair overlapped the new kind with 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.520
 short beard 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:46.289
 the result was noticeable much better then 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.270
 there is only one that progresses 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.940
 let's say if you look at my earlier 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.800
 there are no photos in some places 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:58.020
 hair there are some parts 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:01:00.990
 appear beard shortening allowed 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.760
 improve change tracking 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:06.270
 but there is still such a moment in this week 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.200
 when 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:13.230
 empty cases against peeling beard 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.930
 repeated or resumed 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.060
 call him most likely I 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:22.230
 I assume that this is due to the fact that 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.650
 there used to be a thicker beard more 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:28.140
 volume of hair that absorbed itself 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:30.210
 greater amount of oil or balm and 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:35.600
 because of this, the skin was more hydrated 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:38.220
 since now the volume of hair has decreased then 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.080
 moisturizing properties of the oil for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.410
 therefore, too, reduced well, not that 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:49.260
 so that the properties and then the amount of time and 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:53.040
 the amount of oil or balm that I 

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.770
 I put it not enough general therefore 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:58.400
 again began to improve this 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.520
 strong enough but basically i'm not 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.280
 I am very worried about this 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:07.860
 the only thing that gets in the way 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.600
 one track new hairs because 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:11.250
 how are large enough legs 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:15.290
 come as first line 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.580
 and then look out for hair 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.640
 appearance 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.000
 push all the same goes on many 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.920
 gunfire 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.220
 already got the pigment well enough 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.410
 visible about problem areas here 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.090
 these here 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.210
 together now I don't go with which 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:36.280
 Specifically, we are the parties 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.420
 the problem is almost solved on the other hand 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.900
 she is still in the process 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:43.740
 about the beard and mustache connection 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.470
 it was a long beard and a long mustache and 

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:49.630
 it turned out that in principle the connection 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:52.770
 restored but at the moment, 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.140
 stand Alcohol I drew 

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:57.300
 Kei looked more closely after all 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.010
 is there some more 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:03.340
 the difference between this part of this that is 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.660
 the connection is almost restored to 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.480
 of fluff hair 

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:10.500
 but none the less so as thick as 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.760
 parties therefore even up to this side 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.430
 spun hair will turn into 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.060
 ordinary will still be seen 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.530
 the visual difference is cleanliness 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.709
 germinating hair because it does not 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.670
 it seems to be not very good either 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:26.670
 look because 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.940
 therefore we look further is still unknown 

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:37.500
 what and how will be 

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:41.980
 the second month went jar 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.959
 no changes in dosage made 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.329
 see everything just as I produce 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:51.180
 and most likely I will not wear any 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:51.180
 changes to the end of the three-month course 

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:59.799
 Yes, here in principle, all the new side does not 

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.920
 appeared some strongly 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:06.579
 All these bright changes too 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:13.019
 monotonously slowly but somehow moving 

00:04:06.579 --> 00:04:13.019
 progress but now be the photo 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:43.860
 as you can see in the photos much better 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:47.900
 you can see the change of the beacon than the first 

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.550
 the video therefore most likely over 

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:52.439
 applying the remaining period that is and 

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:56.240
 drink and two months left I will 

00:04:52.439 --> 00:04:59.310
 constantly on a log 

00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.500
 beard trimmed there so that the length is not 

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:05.099
 exceeded there 6 8 millimeters in order 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:07.349
 so that you can be more or less normal 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:10.580
 track change because everyone 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:13.770
 it is difficult to do with a long beard 

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.379
 that's all in a week will be next 

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:17.550
 report thanks for watching you was 

00:05:16.379 --> 00:05:21.110
 max and beardcam channel 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.110
 all beards bye
