00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all guys and welcome to 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.720
 this brand new tutorial episode on 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:07.589
 how to download partners and play with them 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.840
 multiplayer 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:12.960
 then the game has many problems in 

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:18.660
 tibet so a little difficult to play but but 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.000
 however with a bit of discovering the internet 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.900
 because this thing is a little difficult to 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.699
 to find 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.460
 also because the new the game if not 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:27.779
 I managed to find a programmed one 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.660
 as of corner 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:35.670
 but we pass to the game totally a game 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:38.280
 desini type that allows you to play 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:41.579
 all because with his graphics he manages to 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:44.550
 start any day is in 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:46.710
 any computer then service 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.680
 so it can heat up 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:55.949
 from stigma that free but can be downloaded 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:00.190
 windows that adds things to the game 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:02.680
 only for you because I buy but 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.920
 not very necessary even if you are 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:09.729
 game like you could buy it for the 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:12.789
 programmer because he doesn't have many is a 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:15.970
 16 year old boy who wanted to start a 

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:19.330
 I play with what I had available 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:26.080
 so he now enhancing the game is 

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:29.110
 improving and precisely developing the 

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.060
 game therefore costs grateful is free 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:35.159
 though if you want gold for the opposite 

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.159
 help him developed from 5 euros 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:45.179
 ok the game itself is very simple and 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:49.950
 now I will tell you how to download the tango 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:51.940
 tango is a platform to love us that 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:55.360
 precisely it helps 

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:58.330
 I didn't understand how it works but it helps 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.720
 the people just to be in between 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:03.910
 them and dump all the ip's 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.849
 through better virtual lippi than from 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:09.009
 tango and if I understand you right now though 

00:02:06.849 --> 00:02:11.290
 memo video just like me 

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:15.780
 I can always at tables or why not 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:19.090
 I know well how to work discharged so 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.760
 in the corner and just because everything is finished 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.819
 you have also accepted the thing of 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:28.810
 internet point that says you want to download 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.120
 using hosting a thing for dinner in 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:40.330
 this thesis after the companies the computer 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:42.340
 and you have so much ok we open the wait 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:46.659
 that you also need to record why 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:48.819
 seems ok here is if you if you have it 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:51.459
 because it operates formatted game then 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:55.720
 the computer so I do n't have it 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:03:00.970
 adobe for this then here you have to 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:01.840
 create local not know how to put there the 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:07.540
 password 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:11.470
 the name your name and password and 

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:17.440
 get out of late just doing that 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:20.350
 go to network search write research 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.030
 here are all these servers if any 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:25.209
 add many people were only 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:28.270
 from here up until now no more are added 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:32.560
 four so now the boys I don't have 

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.680
 got it right how it works because i for 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.310
 take a server I go on the one the most 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:45.490
 full for example this I enter 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:48.040
 expect a login from a moment 

00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.069
 months charge I put a little goose here 

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.650
 as soon as it loads there are many people of 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:04:00.550
 they write to ask if they are united 

00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:04.090
 where they can tie up to enjoy years 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.720
 pd here pd is meaning if it is not needed 

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:10.599
 pee where you can fight and for example 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.870
 there is so much a lot of people that 

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.300
 splits the pd on servers that are not expensive 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:17.100
 because to which it shows itself 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.510
 commissioned trani of shit they have 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:27.330
 old acquaintances 

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:29.580
 so you write it to fuck and then 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:32.130
 you'll find yourself one hundred per cent 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:39.510

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.860

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:10.500
