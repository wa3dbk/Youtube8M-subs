all<00:00:20.340> this<00:00:20.699> firing<00:00:21.480> works<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:24.289> fit<00:00:25.289> it<00:00:25.380> in<00:00:25.500> the

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
all this firing works I fit it in the

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.920 
all this firing works I fit it in the
bolt<00:00:25.830> and<00:00:26.130> such<00:00:26.490> so<00:00:27.060> I'm<00:00:27.240> going<00:00:27.510> to<00:00:27.599> show<00:00:27.750> that

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
bolt and such so I'm going to show that

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.019 
bolt and such so I'm going to show that
but<00:00:28.170> first<00:00:28.439> I<00:00:28.890> want<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.310> tell<00:00:29.429> you<00:00:29.609> what<00:00:29.849> I've

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:30.029 
but first I want to tell you what I've

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.000 
but first I want to tell you what I've
done<00:00:31.130> and<00:00:32.130> I<00:00:32.250> think<00:00:32.460> is<00:00:32.520> pretty<00:00:32.700> nice

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
done and I think is pretty nice

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.440 
done and I think is pretty nice
so<00:00:35.010> I<00:00:35.719> sandpapered<00:00:36.719> it<00:00:36.840> down<00:00:36.989> because<00:00:37.380> i

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 
so I sandpapered it down because i

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:41.270 
so I sandpapered it down because i
chiseled<00:00:39.450> everything<00:00:40.110> out<00:00:40.260> you<00:00:40.290> know<00:00:40.620> shaped

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
chiseled everything out you know shaped

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.510 
chiseled everything out you know shaped
it<00:00:41.550> and<00:00:41.760> it<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.180> very<00:00:42.270> rough<00:00:43.190> so<00:00:44.190> I<00:00:44.219> had<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
it and it was very rough so I had to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.529 
it and it was very rough so I had to
smooth<00:00:45.149> that<00:00:45.450> and<00:00:45.719> I<00:00:46.469> filled<00:00:46.770> this<00:00:46.920> up<00:00:47.100> with

00:00:47.529 --> 00:00:47.539 
smooth that and I filled this up with

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:50.389 
smooth that and I filled this up with
it's<00:00:48.539> it's<00:00:48.780> not<00:00:49.020> good<00:00:49.200> enough<00:00:49.410> I've<00:00:49.649> to<00:00:49.890> mate<00:00:50.129> a

00:00:50.389 --> 00:00:50.399 
it's it's not good enough I've to mate a

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.040 
it's it's not good enough I've to mate a
little<00:00:50.910> bit<00:00:51.000> thicker<00:00:51.239> but<00:00:51.539> uh<00:00:53.690> yeah<00:00:54.690> I<00:00:54.719> filled

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
little bit thicker but uh yeah I filled

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.560 
little bit thicker but uh yeah I filled
with<00:00:55.320> the<00:00:56.570> uh<00:00:58.010> I<00:00:59.010> don't<00:00:59.219> know<00:00:59.399> an<00:00:59.699> epoxy<00:01:00.090> type

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
with the uh I don't know an epoxy type

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
with the uh I don't know an epoxy type
thing<00:01:01.039> new<00:01:02.039> lady<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.780> in<00:01:03.780> the<00:01:04.019> shed<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.820> I

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
thing new lady in the in the shed so I

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.580 
thing new lady in the in the shed so I
put<00:01:06.360> my<00:01:06.510> reel<00:01:06.689> on<00:01:06.900> it<00:01:07.080> is<00:01:08.630> pretty<00:01:09.630> pretty

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
put my reel on it is pretty pretty

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.719 
put my reel on it is pretty pretty
precise<00:01:11.869> it<00:01:12.869> is<00:01:13.610> 11<00:01:14.610> millimeter<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.270> think<00:01:15.750> so

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
precise it is 11 millimeter I think so

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.740 
precise it is 11 millimeter I think so
if<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:18.240> scope<00:01:18.600> mount<00:01:18.869> fits<00:01:19.799> on<00:01:20.070> it<00:01:20.659> should<00:01:21.659> be

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
if a scope mount fits on it should be

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.330 
if a scope mount fits on it should be
nice<00:01:21.930> so<00:01:22.530> I<00:01:23.270> painted<00:01:24.270> black<00:01:24.689> just<00:01:25.439> a<00:01:25.710> few

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
nice so I painted black just a few

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.300 
nice so I painted black just a few
layers<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> mount<00:01:27.090> block<00:01:27.450> I<00:01:28.040> think<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.189> very

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
layers of mount block I think it's very

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:40.179 
layers of mount block I think it's very
nice<00:01:30.560> so<00:01:33.229> it<00:01:34.229> ejects<00:01:35.000> shelves<00:01:36.000> easily<00:01:37.490> and

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:40.189 
nice so it ejects shelves easily and

00:01:40.189 --> 00:01:44.960 
nice so it ejects shelves easily and
yeah<00:01:41.189> I<00:01:41.490> painted<00:01:42.030> the<00:01:42.150> fall<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:42.570> -<00:01:42.780> so<00:01:43.970> nice

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
yeah I painted the fall over - so nice

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:51.370 
yeah I painted the fall over - so nice
you<00:01:45.420> then<00:01:47.840> push<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:49.470> cartridge<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.579> I

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:51.380 
you then push the cartridge and I

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.480 
you then push the cartridge and I
one-handed<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.000> you<00:01:54.000> have<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> click<00:01:55.130> lock<00:01:56.130> it

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
one-handed so you have the click lock it

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:00.790 
one-handed so you have the click lock it
and

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:00.800 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:05.900 

and<00:02:01.800> eg<00:02:02.100> checks<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:04.070> yeah<00:02:05.070> it's<00:02:05.490> pretty<00:02:05.640> nice<00:02:05.880> I

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:05.910 
and eg checks so yeah it's pretty nice I

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.999 
and eg checks so yeah it's pretty nice I
think<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.429> I<00:02:08.429> made<00:02:08.789> a<00:02:08.820> bolt<00:02:09.119> stop<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
think and I made a bolt stop so you

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.750 
think and I made a bolt stop so you
cannot<00:02:11.600> pull<00:02:12.600> it<00:02:12.750> further<00:02:13.050> than<00:02:13.320> this<00:02:13.590> and<00:02:14.310> I

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
cannot pull it further than this and I

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.050 
cannot pull it further than this and I
will<00:02:14.970> explain<00:02:15.660> that<00:02:15.720> to<00:02:16.020> you<00:02:16.230> sometime

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
will explain that to you sometime

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.460 
will explain that to you sometime
because<00:02:18.060> I<00:02:18.090> have<00:02:18.240> not<00:02:18.390> much<00:02:18.510> time<00:02:18.780> our<00:02:19.020> battery

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
because I have not much time our battery

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.060 
because I have not much time our battery
is<00:02:19.500> running<00:02:19.980> out<00:02:20.100> so<00:02:21.080> I'll<00:02:22.080> explain<00:02:22.440> very<00:02:22.800> fast

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
is running out so I'll explain very fast

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:27.680 
is running out so I'll explain very fast
unique<00:02:23.640> r94<00:02:24.330> how<00:02:25.050> this<00:02:25.260> works<00:02:25.880> so<00:02:26.880> let's

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
unique r94 how this works so let's

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.380 
unique r94 how this works so let's
pretend<00:02:27.990> I<00:02:28.560> made<00:02:29.100> a<00:02:31.430> same<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.459> but<00:02:33.060> with<00:02:33.239> the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
pretend I made a same thing but with the

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:36.500 
pretend I made a same thing but with the
weaker<00:02:33.690> spring<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.640> okay<00:02:35.640> so<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:36.090> white<00:02:36.209> piece

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
weaker spring so okay so the white piece

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.300 
weaker spring so okay so the white piece
is<00:02:36.690> the<00:02:36.810> striking<00:02:37.200> part<00:02:37.620> where<00:02:37.860> it<00:02:37.950> hits<00:02:38.130> the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
is the striking part where it hits the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:44.060 
is the striking part where it hits the
primer<00:02:40.040> this<00:02:41.040> cylinder<00:02:41.459> is<00:02:41.810> glued<00:02:42.810> on<00:02:43.070> you

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
primer this cylinder is glued on you

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.890 
primer this cylinder is glued on you
have<00:02:44.160> the<00:02:44.280> spring<00:02:44.550> and<00:02:44.880> the<00:02:45.090> green<00:02:45.300> part<00:02:45.630> is

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
have the spring and the green part is

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.560 
have the spring and the green part is
not<00:02:46.350> included<00:02:47.250> also<00:02:47.370> it<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.820> slide<00:02:48.180> you<00:02:48.390> see

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
not included also it can slide you see

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.340 
not included also it can slide you see
that<00:02:48.750> and<00:02:48.980> this<00:02:49.980> part<00:02:50.340> is<00:02:50.989> this<00:02:51.989> black<00:02:52.320> thing

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
that and this part is this black thing

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:57.940 
that and this part is this black thing
that<00:02:53.010> hooks<00:02:53.220> on<00:02:53.489> to<00:02:53.850> the<00:02:53.880> trigger<00:02:55.550> assembly

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
that hooks on to the trigger assembly

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:05.650 
that hooks on to the trigger assembly
okay<00:02:58.950> so<00:02:59.209> basically<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:02.760> have<00:03:02.940> it<00:03:03.120> like<00:03:03.330> this

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:05.660 
okay so basically you have it like this

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.850 
okay so basically you have it like this
it's<00:03:06.660> almost<00:03:07.260> the<00:03:07.530> same<00:03:08.239> and<00:03:09.440> then<00:03:10.440> the<00:03:10.620> green

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
it's almost the same and then the green

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:14.330 
it's almost the same and then the green
part<00:03:11.190> is<00:03:11.489> glued<00:03:12.120> in<00:03:12.360> in<00:03:12.930> in<00:03:13.320> the<00:03:13.530> intersection

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:14.340 
part is glued in in in the intersection

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.900 
part is glued in in in the intersection
of<00:03:14.519> the<00:03:14.970> end<00:03:15.090> of<00:03:15.209> the<00:03:15.330> bolt<00:03:15.510> so<00:03:16.440> this<00:03:16.920> would

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910 
of the end of the bolt so this would

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.660 
of the end of the bolt so this would
rest<00:03:18.209> on<00:03:18.450> the<00:03:18.989> end<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.260> the<00:03:19.470> your<00:03:20.160> bolt<00:03:20.430> and

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
rest on the end of the your bolt and

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:25.130 
rest on the end of the your bolt and
there<00:03:20.790> will<00:03:20.940> be<00:03:20.970> tension<00:03:21.980> so<00:03:23.780> yeah<00:03:24.780> what<00:03:24.989> you

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
there will be tension so yeah what you

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.080 
there will be tension so yeah what you
need<00:03:25.320> you<00:03:26.010> have<00:03:26.130> to<00:03:26.370> measure<00:03:26.610> it<00:03:26.820> out<00:03:26.910> of

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
need you have to measure it out of

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.160 
need you have to measure it out of
course<00:03:27.620> and<00:03:28.620> such<00:03:28.950> but<00:03:29.310> uh<00:03:29.540> it's<00:03:30.540> very<00:03:30.600> simple

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
course and such but uh it's very simple

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.410 
course and such but uh it's very simple
so<00:03:32.600> when<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.720> pull<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.080> back<00:03:35.269> but<00:03:36.269> the

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
so when you pull this back but the

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.160 
so when you pull this back but the
camera<00:03:36.840> is<00:03:36.870> I<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.850> show<00:03:38.850> show<00:03:39.750> you<00:03:39.810> much

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
camera is I can show show you much

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:49.320 
camera is I can show show you much
easier<00:03:41.030> okay<00:03:42.799> so

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:49.330 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.500 

so<00:03:50.330> you<00:03:50.390> have<00:03:50.540> the<00:03:50.750> bolt<00:03:51.650> like<00:03:51.890> this<00:03:52.130> and<00:03:52.610> the

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:53.510 
so you have the bolt like this and the

00:03:53.510 --> 00:04:01.180 
so you have the bolt like this and the
green<00:03:53.720> part<00:03:54.020> is<00:03:54.850> with<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:57.970> with<00:03:58.970> the<00:03:59.150> bolt<00:04:00.190> so

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
green part is with the with the bolt so

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:09.809 
green part is with the with the bolt so
very<00:04:01.430> clicks<00:04:01.700> like<00:04:01.910> this<00:04:03.400> and<00:04:04.400> then<00:04:08.170> pressure

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
very clicks like this and then pressure

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:20.610 
very clicks like this and then pressure
is<00:04:10.819> there<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.920> that's<00:04:13.160> same<00:04:13.760> with<00:04:13.910> this<00:04:14.060> one

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:20.620 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.740 

so<00:04:21.620> yeah<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.990> the<00:04:23.990> problem<00:04:24.470> with<00:04:24.620> this<00:04:24.800> one

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
so yeah and the problem with this one

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:31.480 
so yeah and the problem with this one
that<00:04:26.750> it<00:04:26.930> won't<00:04:27.110> shoot<00:04:27.350> it<00:04:27.669> is<00:04:28.669> this<00:04:30.460> when<00:04:31.460> you

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:31.490 
that it won't shoot it is this when you

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:39.070 
that it won't shoot it is this when you
pull<00:04:31.940> the<00:04:32.120> bolt<00:04:32.360> in<00:04:36.280> and<00:04:37.280> you<00:04:38.090> push<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.360> this

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
pull the bolt in and you push it this

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:49.390 
pull the bolt in and you push it this
way<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:40.790> it<00:04:40.910> has<00:04:41.389> to<00:04:41.630> hook<00:04:41.780> on<00:04:42.020> you<00:04:42.200> know<00:04:42.350> oh<00:04:48.400> all

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
way so it has to hook on you know oh all

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:58.300 
way so it has to hook on you know oh all
this<00:04:49.580> hard<00:04:54.729> so<00:04:55.729> okay<00:04:56.000> when<00:04:56.210> I<00:04:56.240> do<00:04:56.360> this<00:04:57.310> it

00:04:58.300 --> 00:04:58.310 
this hard so okay when I do this it

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:02.680 
this hard so okay when I do this it
rides<00:04:58.850> over<00:05:00.100> because<00:05:01.100> this<00:05:01.880> is<00:05:02.060> just<00:05:02.240> a<00:05:02.479> wooden

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:02.690 
rides over because this is just a wooden

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:05.290 
rides over because this is just a wooden
skewer<00:05:02.990> it's<00:05:03.620> very<00:05:03.800> thin<00:05:04.130> and<00:05:04.400> bends<00:05:04.910> very

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
skewer it's very thin and bends very

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.060 
skewer it's very thin and bends very
easily<00:05:05.479> so<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.900> have<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.200> make<00:05:06.350> a<00:05:06.380> new<00:05:06.590> bolt<00:05:06.860> or

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
easily so I have to make a new bolt or

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.270 
easily so I have to make a new bolt or
neo<00:05:07.460> fire<00:05:07.850> pin<00:05:08.060> it<00:05:08.210> if<00:05:08.510> aren't<00:05:08.780> bent<00:05:08.930> at<00:05:09.020> least

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
neo fire pin it if aren't bent at least

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.440 
neo fire pin it if aren't bent at least
that<00:05:10.280> is<00:05:10.430> from<00:05:10.700> metal<00:05:11.090> so<00:05:11.590> it<00:05:12.590> won't<00:05:12.860> Bend<00:05:13.450> so

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
that is from metal so it won't Bend so

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:17.320 
that is from metal so it won't Bend so
then<00:05:14.720> it<00:05:14.870> stays<00:05:15.200> straight<00:05:16.070> and<00:05:16.430> stays<00:05:17.060> this

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
then it stays straight and stays this

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:20.040 
then it stays straight and stays this
way<00:05:17.389> and<00:05:18.260> does<00:05:18.590> not<00:05:18.740> ride<00:05:18.979> over

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:20.050 
way and does not ride over

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:26.170 
way and does not ride over
well<00:05:21.050> yeah<00:05:21.460> it<00:05:22.460> works<00:05:24.039> works<00:05:25.039> perfectly<00:05:25.610> fine

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:26.180

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
I made a new ejector and it flies away
