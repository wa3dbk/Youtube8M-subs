00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.319 
boy weird and kind of sad at the same
time<00:01:31.380> because<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.009> actually<00:01:32.310> liked<00:01:32.670> my<00:01:32.850> length

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:33.329 
time because I actually liked my length

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:35.030 
time because I actually liked my length
like<00:01:33.659> it<00:01:33.960> was<00:01:34.079> think<00:01:34.229> it<00:01:34.290> was<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.500> up<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.770> my

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040

like it was think it was like up to my
collarbone<00:01:35.460> so<00:01:36.299> cool<00:01:36.509> like<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.689> bat<00:01:36.930> much<00:01:37.170> and

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530
