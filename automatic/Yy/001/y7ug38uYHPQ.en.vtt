punt<00:05:17.580> returns<00:05:17.940> this<00:05:18.120> game<00:05:18.419> let's<00:05:18.659> see<00:05:18.810> if<00:05:18.900> I

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:19.020 
punt returns this game let's see if I

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.540 
punt returns this game let's see if I
can<00:05:19.169> change<00:05:19.199> that<00:05:19.680> look<00:05:19.860> at<00:05:19.949> me<00:05:20.039> coming<00:05:20.280> at<00:05:20.370> war

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:20.550 
can change that look at me coming at war

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:22.760 
can change that look at me coming at war
look<00:05:21.180> at<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.419> spin<00:05:21.719> mo<00:05:21.960> oh<00:05:22.110> but<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.710> couldn't

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
look at that spin mo oh but I couldn't

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.370 
look at that spin mo oh but I couldn't
sneak<00:05:23.310> through<00:05:23.550> that<00:05:23.699> crease<00:05:24.120> if<00:05:24.990> I<00:05:25.169> had<00:05:25.349> a

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:25.380 
sneak through that crease if I had a

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.959 
sneak through that crease if I had a
gotten<00:05:25.800> through<00:05:26.009> there<00:05:26.190> and<00:05:26.310> turned<00:05:26.580> on<00:05:26.789> the

00:05:26.959 --> 00:05:26.969 
gotten through there and turned on the

00:05:26.969 --> 00:05:28.490 
gotten through there and turned on the
Jets<00:05:27.240> I<00:05:27.539> probably<00:05:27.840> would<00:05:28.110> have<00:05:28.139> still<00:05:28.440> been

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:28.500 
Jets I probably would have still been

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:31.520 
Jets I probably would have still been
running<00:05:29.130> so<00:05:29.669> second<00:05:30.150> and<00:05:30.270> eight<00:05:30.599> he's<00:05:31.169> looking

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
running so second and eight he's looking

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:34.129 
running so second and eight he's looking
for<00:05:31.680> something<00:05:32.130> incomplete<00:05:32.610> pass<00:05:33.120> he<00:05:33.780> got<00:05:33.990> it

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
for something incomplete pass he got it

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.200 
for something incomplete pass he got it
off<00:05:34.289> right<00:05:34.590> when<00:05:34.800> he<00:05:34.919> was<00:05:35.099> hit<00:05:35.340> so<00:05:35.849> third<00:05:36.180> down

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.210 
off right when he was hit so third down

00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:38.600 
off right when he was hit so third down
and<00:05:36.599> eight<00:05:37.020> we<00:05:37.199> need<00:05:37.440> another<00:05:37.710> stop<00:05:38.069> here<00:05:38.340> can

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:38.610 
and eight we need another stop here can

00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:39.550 
and eight we need another stop here can
we<00:05:38.789> get<00:05:39.090> it

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:49.050 
still have a chance to punch this in

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:56.180 
still have a chance to punch this in
look<00:05:49.469> at<00:05:49.620> that<00:05:49.740> but<00:05:54.229> people<00:05:55.229> your<00:05:55.590> boys<00:05:55.770> hiked

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
look at that but people your boys hiked

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.700 
look at that but people your boys hiked
about<00:05:56.400> that<00:05:56.759> ahead<00:05:56.990> second<00:05:57.990> and<00:05:58.110> seven<00:05:58.560> he's

00:05:58.700 --> 00:05:58.710 
about that ahead second and seven he's

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:01.159 
about that ahead second and seven he's
dropping<00:05:59.159> back<00:05:59.279> again<00:05:59.819> and<00:06:00.240> look<00:06:00.300> I<00:06:01.020> was

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
dropping back again and look I was

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.499 
dropping back again and look I was
playing<00:06:01.469> his<00:06:01.740> own<00:06:01.889> oh<00:06:02.310> but<00:06:02.819> he<00:06:02.909> went<00:06:03.180> to<00:06:03.389> the

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
playing his own oh but he went to the

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:06.649 
playing his own oh but he went to the
corner<00:06:04.020> and<00:06:04.229> he<00:06:05.069> had<00:06:05.310> both<00:06:05.580> feet<00:06:05.940> in<00:06:06.180> can<00:06:06.539> you

00:06:06.649 --> 00:06:06.659 
corner and he had both feet in can you

00:06:06.659 --> 00:06:10.010 
corner and he had both feet in can you
believe<00:06:07.050> that<00:06:07.789> but<00:06:08.789> now<00:06:09.000> they<00:06:09.210> have<00:06:09.419> to<00:06:09.569> go<00:06:09.779> for

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:10.020 
believe that but now they have to go for

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:12.320 
believe that but now they have to go for
two<00:06:10.259> do<00:06:10.889> you<00:06:11.009> think<00:06:11.219> they<00:06:11.340> can<00:06:11.520> get<00:06:11.699> it<00:06:11.849> let's

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330 
two do you think they can get it let's

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:13.430 
two do you think they can get it let's
see<00:06:12.449> if<00:06:12.479> they<00:06:12.659> can<00:06:12.810> get<00:06:12.930> the<00:06:13.050> two-point

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:13.440 
see if they can get the two-point

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:15.200 
see if they can get the two-point
conversion<00:06:13.500> in<00:06:13.979> tie<00:06:14.130> the<00:06:14.190> game<00:06:14.490> up

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:15.210 
conversion in tie the game up

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.469 
conversion in tie the game up
now<00:06:15.449> he<00:06:15.509> goes<00:06:15.900> down<00:06:16.380> for<00:06:16.409> the<00:06:16.740> sack<00:06:17.240> he<00:06:18.240> could

00:06:18.469 --> 00:06:18.479 
now he goes down for the sack he could

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:23.269 
now he goes down for the sack he could
not<00:06:18.719> get<00:06:19.110> it<00:06:19.259> folks<00:06:20.240> so<00:06:21.240> now<00:06:21.539> here<00:06:21.990> we<00:06:22.020> are<00:06:22.279> they

00:06:23.269 --> 00:06:23.279 
not get it folks so now here we are they

00:06:23.279 --> 00:06:25.100 
not get it folks so now here we are they
have<00:06:23.490> the<00:06:23.669> ball<00:06:23.909> back<00:06:23.940> and<00:06:24.270> I<00:06:24.539> was<00:06:24.690> blitzing

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:25.110 
have the ball back and I was blitzing

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:27.290 
have the ball back and I was blitzing
trying<00:06:25.380> to<00:06:25.469> get<00:06:25.620> a<00:06:25.650> safety<00:06:25.979> but<00:06:26.759> he's<00:06:26.909> going<00:06:27.180> to

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:27.300 
trying to get a safety but he's going to

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:30.240 
trying to get a safety but he's going to
the<00:06:27.479> right<00:06:27.719> side<00:06:28.080> and<00:06:28.289> is<00:06:28.409> picked<00:06:28.740> off

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:30.250 
the right side and is picked off

00:06:30.250 --> 00:06:33.810 
the right side and is picked off
an<00:06:30.460> interception<00:06:31.210> right<00:06:31.660> there<00:06:32.460> and<00:06:33.460> I<00:06:33.640> was

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:33.820 
an interception right there and I was

00:06:33.820 --> 00:06:35.310 
an interception right there and I was
trying<00:06:34.060> to<00:06:34.090> get<00:06:34.270> a<00:06:34.300> block<00:06:34.570> but<00:06:34.780> I<00:06:34.840> totally

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:35.320 
trying to get a block but I totally

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.580 
trying to get a block but I totally
missed<00:06:35.590> Kenny<00:06:36.550> Vaccaro<00:06:37.030> with<00:06:37.450> the<00:06:37.570> pic<00:06:37.870> can

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:38.590 
missed Kenny Vaccaro with the pic can

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:40.260 
missed Kenny Vaccaro with the pic can
you<00:06:38.680> believe<00:06:38.980> he<00:06:39.100> got<00:06:39.250> benched<00:06:39.700> in<00:06:39.760> real<00:06:40.060> life

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:40.270 
you believe he got benched in real life

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:41.370 
you believe he got benched in real life
though<00:06:40.510> I<00:06:40.540> thought<00:06:40.810> he<00:06:40.900> was<00:06:41.020> doing<00:06:41.260> better

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:41.380 
though I thought he was doing better

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:42.930 
though I thought he was doing better
than<00:06:41.560> that<00:06:41.770> anyway<00:06:42.370> checking<00:06:42.760> out<00:06:42.850> the

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
than that anyway checking out the

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:45.270 
than that anyway checking out the
simulation<00:06:43.510> we<00:06:44.080> only<00:06:44.260> put<00:06:44.560> a<00:06:44.590> field<00:06:44.890> goal<00:06:45.070> on

00:06:45.270 --> 00:06:45.280 
simulation we only put a field goal on

00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.250 
simulation we only put a field goal on
the<00:06:45.400> board<00:06:45.610> so<00:06:45.790> they<00:06:45.910> still<00:06:46.180> actually<00:06:46.450> have<00:06:46.810> 20

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:47.260 
the board so they still actually have 20

00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:49.380 
the board so they still actually have 20
seconds<00:06:47.710> to<00:06:47.830> do<00:06:47.980> something<00:06:48.370> here<00:06:48.700> and<00:06:48.820> I<00:06:49.240> was

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:49.390 
seconds to do something here and I was

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.020 
seconds to do something here and I was
actually<00:06:49.750> calling<00:06:49.960> timeouts<00:06:50.500> for<00:06:50.770> him<00:06:50.920> I<00:06:51.160> want

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:52.030 
actually calling timeouts for him I want

00:06:52.030 --> 00:06:53.520 
actually calling timeouts for him I want
to<00:06:52.090> try<00:06:52.330> to<00:06:52.390> get<00:06:52.570> me<00:06:52.720> an<00:06:52.810> interception<00:06:53.290> you

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:53.530 
to try to get me an interception you

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.230 
to try to get me an interception you
know<00:06:53.650> what<00:06:53.770> I'm<00:06:53.860> saying<00:06:54.100> so<00:06:54.610> second<00:06:54.910> and<00:06:55.060> 10

00:06:55.230 --> 00:06:55.240 
know what I'm saying so second and 10

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.270 
know what I'm saying so second and 10
drop<00:06:55.480> it<00:06:55.900> any<00:06:56.290> second<00:06:56.650> I'm<00:06:56.740> gonna<00:06:56.860> call<00:06:57.130> the

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:57.280 
drop it any second I'm gonna call the

00:06:57.280 --> 00:07:00.900 
drop it any second I'm gonna call the
timeout<00:06:58.530> for<00:06:59.530> from<00:06:59.770> 16<00:07:00.250> is<00:07:00.460> their<00:07:00.670> last

00:07:00.900 --> 00:07:00.910 
timeout for from 16 is their last

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:03.780 
timeout for from 16 is their last
opportunity<00:07:01.530> no<00:07:02.530> time<00:07:02.890> on<00:07:03.190> the<00:07:03.220> clock<00:07:03.370> he's
