00:00:02.260 --> 00:00:06.290
 hello how welcome are you to prism 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.790
 tutorials I am killer night and today I 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.559
 I bring a free package of actions 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:11.150
 that you can download with the link that 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.250
 you have in the description once what 

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.230
 do you will appreciate a file like this 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:17.570
 simply by double clicking on it 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 you can unzip it and a 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.380
 folder this folder contains three 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:23.210
 files that are the three packages of 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.220
 actions you can select them all three 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.619
 at the same time give a right button and open 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:30.079
 to install them so automatically it 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.759
 will install in photoshop now yes we are going to 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.440
 the action palette that is this button 

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:34.790
 of the play that is here or if not 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.790
 you have there you can come the window and 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.490
 choose actions you can see that they are already 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.770
 installed in this case are these three 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:46.730
 last folders here are effects 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:48.860
 color and portrait effects and skin worth 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.600
 if we deploy each of the folders 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.890
 you can see all the actions that I have 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:54.110
 prepared that surely many 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.480
 they sound because we've seen them already 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.980
 previously in the tutorials so that 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.829
 you can see how they work, let's take 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.960
 some as an example we are worth it because it is 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.519
 colored prism 5 simply 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.560
 select it and give the play button that 

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:08.299
 there's down here to run 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.159
 and so directly that applies to us 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:11.990
 effect that I have recorded and these are 

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:13.430
 steps that I have been following recording the 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:15.770
 so that you simply have 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.530
 to give the play and you apply the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:22.570
 directly effect, let's try 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:25.360
 with another action for example 

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.310
 this approach so you can also see that 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.110
 almost all actions are included 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.720
 with a mask this means that 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.950
 You can exclude parts of the action by 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.900
 example here the image has been focused 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.400
 whole but I still do not want to be 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.619
 Focus the skin for it, it would take 

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.330
 a brush would paint black and 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.060
 directly the whole image would be 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.590
 focused - the part of color net also 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.200
 almost all actions carry a 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:49.000
 opacity at 50% this means that in 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:50.650
 any time you can give more 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.050
 opacity so that the effect is more 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.570
 exaggerated or even less has left them 

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.910
 50 so you can leave them to your 

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.200
 I'm going to show you one more example 

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.330
 so you can see that in some of the 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.610
 actions is going to skip a message from 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.430
 instructions for example here in 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.440
 highlight eyes when I gave the play will 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:10.630
 to skip a message that says paints with 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.630
 the white brush on the mask in the 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:14.890
 area of â€‹â€‹the eyes that you want to highlight 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.570
 this means that the mask has been 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.519
 applied directly of black color is 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.470
 say that the action is not displayed but 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.269
 automatically you have selected the 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.980
 brush with the white color so just 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.959
 you have to paint in the area you want 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.530
 that the action is applied for example 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:30.450
 here I would have to paint in the 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.010
 I also remember that you can always 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:34.380
 modify the opacity to leave the 

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.970
 effect to your liking is worth now 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.170
 to take a quick look at all the 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.880
 actions so you can see the 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.890
 results however on my website 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.690
 in prism tutorials dotcom I leave you 

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.880
 more detailed instructions of the 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.550
 we started seeing lots of portrait and 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.410
 skin here you have two softened are the 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:51.510
 first is the high pass inverted and 

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.790
 the second is the smoothing of skin 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:55.110
 both work with a black mask 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:56.489
 that you will simply have to paint 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.770
 white in the areas where you want 

00:02:56.489 --> 00:03:01.050
 soften the skin the next two are 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:02.550
 two both and separation of frequencies 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.660
 these I will not stop 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.130
 explain them because I already made some 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.989
 tutorials about it I recommend that you 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.390
 you see to understand how these work 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.250
 techniques the next we have already seen 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:13.410
 before that is the eye enhancer 

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.269
 that gives a bit of contrast and 

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.819
 saturation to the eye area and then 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:19.260
 is the red skin reducer that here 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:21.030
 in this case you do not notice much but if 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.769
 you have skins for example here the nose 

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.720
 in a little yes you can tell they are very 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.819
 red you can paint in the mask of 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.430
 white color ok let's move on to the 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:31.080
 following the effects the first one is 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.329
 a texture enhancer that comes with 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:35.190
 the mask in black and you simply have 

00:03:33.329 --> 00:03:37.650
 to paint in the area you want 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.690
 for example I have done it in the hair then 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.940
 you have three types of approach that are a 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.280
 soft focus a stronger focus and a 

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:46.470
 Focus for printing below 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.990
 we have a film grain ie it is 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.570
 a texture like analog grain 

00:03:48.990 --> 00:03:53.610
 you can see that in some of the 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.230
 actions like for example in this was 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.210
 become an intelligent object this 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.710
 means that if you double- click good 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.690
 if we deploy this layer and do double 

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.280
 click on any of the filters you can 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.500
 modify them if for example in this case 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.930
 you would like to add more grain, more noise 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.960
 you can double click and increase the 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:12.210
 to your liking and finally in 

00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:13.530
 this group we have a noise reducer 

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.960
 for images that have a lot of noise 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:17.609
 you simply give the play and we can 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:20.120
 vary by raising or lowering the opacity 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:22.680
 to reduce the noise to your liking 

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:25.310
 let's see now the effects of 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:29.880
 color down here we have a sepia tone 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:31.350
 a look at selenium a saturated tone 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.570
 well all these are the big ones 

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:35.430
 tutorials that I have done previously 

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.830
 and then five different color shades 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.090
 to choose to your liking and took advantage 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.590
 to insist that in any 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:41.820
 moment you can edit the action is to say 

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:43.260
 you can open the group 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.570
 modify this to your liking I for 

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:46.920
 example here I have this layer of color and 

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.510
 this contrast layer that could 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:50.310
 modify for example double click here 

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.080
 in this color I could modify it and 

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:53.550
 leave it to my liking this actions 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:57.060
 it comes in handy to save us time 

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:58.860
 but we can always customize them and 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:00.660
 here we have another color tone that is 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.420
 the color fashion tutorial that already 

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:05.400
 we saw earlier it's worth and to finish 

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:07.190
 five different black and white tones 

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.630
 to choose to your liking and of course 

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:11.430
 customizable these are all 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.230
 actions for the moment little by little what 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.740
 will update and add some 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.330
 new 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:18.000
 meanwhile I hope you enjoy them 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:20.520
 that will save you a lot of time and be of 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:23.210
 much help a very strong hug and we 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:23.210
 we see in the next
