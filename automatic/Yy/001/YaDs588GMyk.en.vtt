00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.060
 what is gothic art gothic art is 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:07.279
 an artistic style of the time 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:09.200
 medieval was developed in France and 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.300
 then it spread throughout the rest of Europe 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.460
 its development began in the middle of 

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.799
 17th century and it came until early 

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:17.690
 16th century was a time of development 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:20.660
 urban and commercial increased the power 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.730
 monarchical culture was secularized or 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:25.130
 scientific advances and the bourgeoisie was born 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.710
 Gothic art was characterized by 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.690
 monumental of their cultures their showy 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.610
 architecture and its particular style of 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.890
 painting and other disciplines was 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:35.990
 replaced in the 16th century by art 

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:38.270
 of the scientist elements of the 

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:40.490
 Gothic architecture 

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.290
 the solution of technical problems 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:43.760
 that the new reality demands with 

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:45.950
 constructions of new proportions 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.230
 that accommodate the inhabitants of the 

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:50.090
 city ​​and considerable height there 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.890
 could bring Romanesque art 

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:53.750
 they required a new construction system 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.540
 that we call Gothic because of its character 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.190
 dynamic art itself the Nordic is 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.530
 a modified creation of the island of 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.930
 France based on the balance of 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.550
 building tensions that allows 

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.980
 choose the masses of the walls 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.960
 the three basic elements are the long 

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.390
 laboriousness point the ribbed vault 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.540
 of warheads and supports as pillars 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.060
 flying buttresses and against arch sources 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.010
 pointed and pointed although this was 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.290
 formerly used by Arabs and 

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:24.660
 Romanesque architects is the most 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.340
 characteristic of the Gothic 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.110
 various types of them the most 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.030
 interesting is the first one that is 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.430
 formed by two segments of circles 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.370
 supported by the top achieving 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.440
 more stability verticality and 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.840
 reduction of the arc pressures 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.790
 pointed indicates effort and dynamism 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.920
 perhaps of the advantages that the 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.290
 pointed arc the most novel is that 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.270
 has two centers which allows not 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:51.570
 there is the forced relationship that 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.210
 originates at half a point between its width 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.460
 and the height with the same width in a 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.620
 long length can be achieved according to 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.890
 the constructive needs heights 

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:03.960
 different rib vault the vault 

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.730
 of ribbed also called vault 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.530
 ribbed is a type of vault 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.020
 characteristic of gothic architecture 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.030
 that receives this name because it is 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:14.520
 conformed by the crossing winters 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.709
 of two cannon balls aimed at 

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.750
 difference of the vault of edge the one of 

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.480
 crucería is characterized by being in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.060
 forced by two or more diagonal lengths 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.520
 that intersect in the usual key 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:28.290
 the ribbed vault is considered one 

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.020
 of the three distinctive elements of the 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.150
 Gothic architecture the work of crucería 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:35.310
 consists of two elements the arcs that 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.810
 constitute their framework or skeleton and 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.670
 cloths supplements that cover 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.340
 intermediate spaces between the arcs 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.650
 first the arches are raised creating the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
 Slender structure resistant and light and 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.400
 Afterwards the cloths are filled 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.620
 intermediate forming the vaults 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.970
 they are framed transversely by 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.910
 the arches fajones the supports pillars 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:58.860
 buttresses and abutments to support 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:00.480
 the push of the weight of the vaults instead 

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:02.610
 to build our walls as 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.319
 they performed in the Romanesque in which 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.870
 abutments adopted in the form of 

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:09.120
 pillars externally attached to the wall 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.980
 with a growing width at its base the 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.260
 Gothic architects devised a system 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.569
 more efficient buttresses with 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.980
 buttresses the buttresses also 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:18.230
 fulfill the mission of housing the 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.930
 channels where 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:23.720
 in the waters of the roofs and thus avoid 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:27.019
 to water them by the flying buttresses 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.239
 and buttresses these controls so the 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:31.220
 lateral thrusts of the dome the Gothic 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.110
 standing outside a system that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.540
 combines an element already used on 

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:38.180
 buttress with a new one the flying buttress 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.610
 what gives the building one more aspect 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:42.890
 complex the thrusts of the vault are 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.410
 transmitted abroad by an arch that 

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:46.910
 joins its start with a buttress this 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:49.489
 system allows to give a greater 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.900
 stability and height to work further 

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.660
 responsible for removing water from the rain 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:57.290
 through the gargoyles the facade 

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:59.420
 doors and windows the facade or portal 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:01.370
 framed by two towers disposes in the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.950
 lower part of several doors and the 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:05.239
 top of the rest the doors are either 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.370
 cooked 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:09.140
 but now they use the pointed bow and 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.720
 time is not divided into several stripes 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:14.390
 horizontals that are decorated with reliefs 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.130
 in the farc and turns the sculptures 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:17.780
 have in the direction of curve and with 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.299
 often they are protected by two 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:21.729
 celestial 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:23.919
 in the stylized pointed arches of 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:26.259
 the contrast windows read climbing 

00:04:23.919 --> 00:04:28.539
 held by thin columns to mode 

00:04:26.259 --> 00:04:30.849
 of light part that serves as a framework for 

00:04:28.539 --> 00:04:32.919
 Polychrome wineries decorated with themes 

00:04:30.849 --> 00:04:34.870
 of the sacred scriptures would seem 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:38.620
 gain a mystic light that illuminates the 

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:41.020
 men's soul the towers are 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.360
 formed by several bodies the lower 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.000
 It is usually a solid cube while the 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.909
 superior has enormous openings that 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.759
 lightweight their weight the auction can be 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:53.500
 flat on terrace or spire with 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.960
 smooth surface or with a rich 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.120
 decoration while it would be set in the 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:00.490
 outside the proliferation of flying buttresses 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:04.330
 and pinnacles of the towers finished in 

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:06.370
 arrows and needles had the same end 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.469
 buttresses by highlighting the surface 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:09.490
 of the wall create a union with space 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.590
 Exterior 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.020
 the building is placed by pinnacles and 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.789
 arrows and the windows set a 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.030
 communication between the inside and the 

00:05:15.789 --> 00:05:21.419
 outside this without producing idea of 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:21.419
 separation 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.420
 structure of the gothic cathedral plant 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:28.310
 and elevation 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:31.310
 the Gothic plant also presents 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.990
 novelties the cruise although it continues 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:34.250
 manifesting itself in the plant is going 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:37.190
 moving towards the center of the 

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:38.900
 church and its ends where they open 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.900
 impressive doors that remind 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.820
 the main thrusts through the vault 

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.770
 Gothic are decomposed into charges 

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:48.110
 verticals that rest on the pillars 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.600
 and laterals that are carried by 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.430
 buttresses to the buttresses with this 

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.830
 system is allowed to free the 

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:57.080
 gothic buildings of its heavy walls and 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.129
 grant them better lighting and a 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.469
 sensory effect 

00:05:59.129 --> 00:06:03.509
 the background we find in the 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:07.399
 romantic chair of say and in the 

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:07.399
 good caliphs from Cordoba
