00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.810
 hey people now i'm back in 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.259
 second sentence and in the previous video 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.519
 about progressive upgrades and 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:12.870
 weight gradients workout talked about 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.340
 if you do not do your training 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:16.020
 the weights are not designed more intensively 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.680
 then the muscle mass increases too 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.830
 no more 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.539
 that means you are leaving one 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.880
 certain weight that means I have 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.109
 now 52.5 I have the first the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.340
 first set with 12 repetition power 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.990
 I always go down further 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.050
 because I'm going to break a little shorter 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.930
 makes and so many are huge 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.880
 confusion of intensity techniques 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:37.020
 different trainings and so on 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.030
 I do not continue in the video now 

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.680
 can explain quickly but for weight 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.960
 Increases, for example, I recommend 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.079
 it starts so you make a month 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.930
 long bank press you make yourself 60 here 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.180
 kilo a month makes her 65 kilos and 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 then notice the 60 mm climb the weight 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:54.239
 you just have to go out of the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.649
 hypertrophy area comes out that 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:57.420
 means if confident repetition 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:58.710
 made in a thing for example that 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.059
 can you generalize I have 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.829
 now, for example, they knew 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.100
 you should always stay down there 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.540
 So at six or eight for example 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.820
 under one then over it if you want me 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.990
 go over and with with 60 kg 10 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.610
 Repetition creates then I think 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.560
 five kilo do not even pack on it 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.119
 then again at six to eight am now 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.799
 my sentence we just see each other 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.100
 Hope you liked it 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.100
 thumbs up 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:50.840
 it was now hours of sleep but never 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.840
 be restarted 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.840
 if I do not sleep, I will not sleep 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.160
 was so well rested his etc are 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.350
 also a few things of battle is 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:07.920
 not important are the comments see 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.929
 us people now comes the next thing 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.760
 he is yes I have a shooting right away 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:16.750
 and photos how can I take photos well 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.640
 how can i look at photos 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.330
 m 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:27.950
 yes nice effect in server on the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.950
 I just have to get out of the camera faster and faster
