00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
 hello ladies and gentlemen today 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:07.440
 I would like to present to your attention 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:10.139
 review your fatal halone exe on u tube 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.759
 almost no russian language videos 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:15.179
 this player 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:19.130
 so I decided to take the initiative 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.250
 player kit includes data cable 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:26.340
 specific 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:27.240
 which by the way is similar to this cable from 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.630
 who on c2 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:33.090
 that I, too, is available and can be 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.790
 use ie date otg cable 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:42.059
 Alonso two sets of included network 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:43.700
 adapter for charging from the network player with 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:48.930
 such a plug 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:50.510
 Well and also included is still here 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.899
 such a strap 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:56.090
 branded with an inscription who I already 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:01.140
 got attached 

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:03.420
 also i will put here for your example to 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.820
 won c2 so you can see the difference in 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.939
 sizes 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:11.220
 I will immediately say the diagonal of this 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.470
 device that is, columns 7 is 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.770
 4 hygiene 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:18.210
 also for these devices myself so 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:22.770
 say do it yourself 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.920
 Covers because well from such henchmen 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.070
 means of such fur 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 so to say in principle they fit 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.049
 there is great and did it because 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.540
 find covers for these players very 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:39.380
 difficult so let's get down to the actual 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 player review 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:47.310
 I want to note that so to say the ax son 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.799
 1 of which this player is very 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:51.689
 similar to the axis 

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:52.320
 i.e. colony software 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.390
 c2 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.560
 here we have all the same features and the 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.020
 flash player watching videos and so on 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.520
 so especially dwell on this I 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.299
 I won't just say one thing 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.970
 huge plus player 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.319
 it's built-in its built-in memory is 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.290
 during option 2 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:16.109
 from 120 gigabytes and 160 from me 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.569
 now in the hands of a black player 

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:20.579
 colors in 120 gigabyte variations also in 

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.129
 the player has a flash memory of 2 gigabytes 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:25.409
 I would also like to mention the long-term 

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:28.230
 the operation time of this player it make up 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.329
 from 3 hours in general in real life is about 

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:34.459
 two or three days of continuous work 

00:02:30.329 --> 00:02:39.319
 music and 10 hours of video viewing 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:41.090
 formats supports a lot 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:43.560
 this is from the pros 

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:47.419
 let's see the music player 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:52.680
 what it looks like is slightly different from 

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:55.199
 the rest of the players who she is like 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.469
 All speakers have your design, we can 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:03:01.829
 select songs we can go to the list and 

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:04.949
 so on in principle who is familiar with 

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:07.939
 it is not difficult 

00:03:04.949 --> 00:03:10.500
 also understand one of the innovations 

00:03:07.939 --> 00:03:12.449
 This interface is what is here 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 there are several desktops like this 

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:16.379
 we had a court colon she now we 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.389
 can bring your widgets here like you 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:21.629
 see the widget and here is the widget 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.000
 write widget on ali g memory widget 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:26.370
 battery percentage brightness widget 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.889
 You can put any picture on 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.030
 Desktop 

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:33.419
 of the minuses I would like to note 

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:36.659
 resistive display which for me 

00:03:33.419 --> 00:03:39.299
 for example , the screen response is a plus 

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:42.359
 very great yourself you are colors yourself 

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:45.000
 the screen is also quite good to view 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.680
 the video is just great too 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.680
 radio notebook 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:52.709
 viewing pictures let's see with 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:52.709
 you 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:04:02.370
 multitouch and of course not we can both 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:02.370
 ic2 approach 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:11.560
 also let's show 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:14.800
 the game if there are no flash games 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:29.430
 any pump they just work 

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:29.430
 very many of them please 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:40.890
 on this I would like to bring my 

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.110
 an overview of the end at the end I want 

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:46.380
 to conclude that the player is just 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.200
 fabulous up its dimensions are great yes he 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.740
 not portable but quality 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.950
 sound 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.380
 claimed battery life up to plus 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.880
 same built-in hard drive 120 add 

00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:58.830
 which can easily be replaced by 

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.800
 any other hard disk suitable for 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:04.710
 size makes this player simple 

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:07.560
 I strongly advise everyone to buy with 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.180
 I say goodbye and as if to new meetings 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.820
 watch my videos 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.820
 put likes or dislikes in
