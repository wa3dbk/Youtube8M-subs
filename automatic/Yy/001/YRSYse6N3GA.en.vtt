00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.590
 hello everyone and today we will learn 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:17.550
 create lanterns for the player we are 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:21.880
 in the project first person template 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:25.390
 accordingly we will add a lantern to 

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.669
 our weapons and when you press f 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.310
 let's say this flashlight will turn on and 

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:35.260
 shut down so the first thing we do 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:37.750
 this is a gasoline event on the f key like 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.290
 this is done on the course go to edit 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.080
 project settings 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.110
 find the input tab and here is the action 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:52.710
 mapping here we see already for gasoline and two 

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:57.280
 events jump off a jump to replace on 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:01:00.010
 space bar and on the gamepad and another 

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:04.059
 some kind of button and accordingly on 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:06.280
 fire on the left mouse button here we are 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:14.189
 want to add one more 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:20.860
 one flashlight event ie flashlight 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:29.380
 on the f button that is when the knife 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:31.480
 all f buttons this button will be called 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.900
 will remain a flashlight event this 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.820
 we need primarily to blueprint a 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:43.350
 then we will see it accordingly here 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:53.530
 close after that we find our 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:02:15.750
 character since 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:20.730
 nobody so find the pier 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:23.450
 Jamaica rector T-shirts pk then press two 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:27.210
 times go to it tab 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:31.230
 component and here we actually see how 

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:35.130
 looks like our character in the game from the third 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:40.140
 faces and here we need to add total 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.280
 just one spotlight component and us 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:47.900
 need to move 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.900
 so that he was in the middle of a weapon 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:03:18.620
 let's do it like this 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:24.290
 how respectively intensity so 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:28.730
 let's reduce this radius a little bit 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:33.760
 you can go to the graph tab here 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:39.250
 we set up how our player acts and 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:42.340
 So we set the mouse movement event here. 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:46.909
 that is, when driving 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.060
 x and y coordinate changes we 

00:03:46.909 --> 00:03:52.970
 should change the position of our light 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:54.370
 source therefore we derive our source 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:04:00.290
 Sveta 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:05.409
 add events world of rotation set 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:09.769
 world rotation associate it with ours 

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:14.599
 males xmas y events and doing here 

00:04:09.769 --> 00:04:22.269
 get control rotation who we are 

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:22.269
 get from our player and bind 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:31.730
 apus 

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:38.320
 you can compile and click play see 

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:46.450
 the light is he is not so strong but he is 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:49.900
 you can come back again to change here 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.900
 various parameters 

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.690
 intensity so on 

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:32.690
 yes, but we see a lantern 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:37.820
 there is but now you need to organize 

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:42.970
 processing the f key return our 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:47.600
 editor here add event 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:06:00.740
 flashlight input action flashlight here 

00:05:47.600 --> 00:06:10.130
 we make that visibility for an object we 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:19.850
 This may need to copy but here 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:20.260
 so here that visibility we connect 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.600
 sleep 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:27.600
 spotlight it then compile and 

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600
 come back 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:37.650
 pressing the flashlight appears 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.650
 cleans up on it all
