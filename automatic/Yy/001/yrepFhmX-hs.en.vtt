start we're gonna take the pencil along
the<00:00:12.450> side<00:00:12.660> of<00:00:12.780> our<00:00:12.870> nose<00:00:13.110> and<00:00:13.469> make<00:00:14.219> one<00:00:14.549> little

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the side of our nose and make one little

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.420 
the side of our nose and make one little
line<00:00:15.809> to<00:00:16.500> determine<00:00:16.949> where<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.220> brow<00:00:17.369> should

end we want to take your pencil

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:22.279 
end we want to take your pencil
diagonally<00:00:20.490> from<00:00:20.910> this<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.630> corner<00:00:22.050> of<00:00:22.170> your

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
diagonally from this the corner of your

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:25.429 
diagonally from this the corner of your
nose<00:00:22.500> and<00:00:22.830> go<00:00:23.640> right<00:00:24.119> along<00:00:24.840> the<00:00:24.990> outside

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
nose and go right along the outside

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.950 
nose and go right along the outside
corner<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.890> your<00:00:26.010> eye<00:00:26.390> that's<00:00:27.390> where<00:00:27.660> my<00:00:27.779> brow

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
corner of your eye that's where my brow

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.200 
corner of your eye that's where my brow
should<00:00:28.170> end<00:00:28.289> now<00:00:28.949> to<00:00:29.010> find<00:00:29.369> your<00:00:29.519> arch<00:00:29.789> this<00:00:30.150> is

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
should end now to find your arch this is

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.959 
should end now to find your arch this is
probably<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.990> most<00:00:31.289> important<00:00:31.920> step<00:00:32.279> so<00:00:32.820> we

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
probably the most important step so we

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.910 
probably the most important step so we
want<00:00:33.149> to<00:00:33.239> take<00:00:33.390> our<00:00:33.540> pencil<00:00:33.780> from<00:00:34.440> the<00:00:34.590> corner

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
want to take our pencil from the corner

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.319 
want to take our pencil from the corner
of<00:00:35.040> our<00:00:35.130> nose<00:00:36.469> through<00:00:37.469> our<00:00:37.800> iris<00:00:38.370> which<00:00:39.180> is

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
of our nose through our iris which is

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.450 
of our nose through our iris which is
the<00:00:39.450> colored<00:00:39.750> part<00:00:40.020> of<00:00:40.110> your<00:00:40.170> eye<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:43.460> that's

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the colored part of your eye and that's

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.889 
the colored part of your eye and that's
where<00:00:44.670> your<00:00:44.789> arch<00:00:44.969> should<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.360> or<00:00:45.570> where<00:00:45.719> my

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
where your arch should be or where my

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:47.690 
where your arch should be or where my
arch<00:00:46.110> should<00:00:46.350> be<00:00:46.530> so<00:00:47.039> now<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.250> I<00:00:47.399> have<00:00:47.460> those

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
arch should be so now that I have those

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.369 
arch should be so now that I have those
little<00:00:47.879> guide<00:00:48.090> lines<00:00:48.329> we're<00:00:48.809> gonna<00:00:48.930> fill<00:00:49.230> in

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
little guide lines we're gonna fill in

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.380 
little guide lines we're gonna fill in
the<00:00:49.500> brow<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:50.070> I'm<00:00:50.399> going<00:00:50.700> to<00:00:50.730> be<00:00:50.969> using

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
the brow and I'm going to be using

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:54.950 
the brow and I'm going to be using
blonde<00:00:52.110> today<00:00:52.620> and<00:00:53.039> I<00:00:53.430> like<00:00:53.879> to<00:00:54.059> start<00:00:54.390> through

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
blonde today and I like to start through

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.720 
blonde today and I like to start through
the<00:00:55.110> center<00:00:55.410> of<00:00:55.530> the<00:00:55.649> brow<00:00:55.800> where<00:00:56.160> the<00:00:56.280> arch<00:00:56.460> is

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
the center of the brow where the arch is

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.729 
the center of the brow where the arch is
because<00:00:57.420> that's<00:00:57.570> where<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:58.079> actually<00:00:58.140> go

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
because that's where you can actually go

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.490 
because that's where you can actually go
a<00:00:59.100> little<00:00:59.789> bit<00:01:00.030> darker<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.780> as<00:01:01.230> you<00:01:01.350> can

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
a little bit darker and as you can

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.640 
a little bit darker and as you can
notice<00:01:01.559> I'm<00:01:02.219> not<00:01:02.399> just<00:01:02.460> drawing<00:01:03.270> one<00:01:03.780> long

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
notice I'm not just drawing one long

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.270 
notice I'm not just drawing one long
stripe<00:01:05.129> I'm<00:01:05.729> doing<00:01:06.210> soft<00:01:06.659> little<00:01:07.020> strokes<00:01:07.500> to

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
stripe I'm doing soft little strokes to

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.609 
stripe I'm doing soft little strokes to
fill<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.729> my<00:01:08.909> brow<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.689> want<00:01:09.869> to<00:01:09.930> go<00:01:10.020> downward

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
fill in my brow you want to go downward

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.160 
fill in my brow you want to go downward
at<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:10.830> tail<00:01:11.100> just<00:01:11.400> to<00:01:12.390> where<00:01:12.510> that<00:01:12.689> point<00:01:13.020> is

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
at the tail just to where that point is

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.859 
at the tail just to where that point is
that<00:01:13.200> I<00:01:13.380> made<00:01:13.619> and<00:01:13.890> then<00:01:14.670> we<00:01:14.820> can<00:01:15.000> softly<00:01:15.630> fill

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
that I made and then we can softly fill

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.230 
that I made and then we can softly fill
in<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.200> front<00:01:16.380> of<00:01:16.560> my<00:01:16.710> brow<00:01:16.920> and<00:01:17.280> I<00:01:17.729> tend<00:01:18.000> to<00:01:18.119> be

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
in the front of my brow and I tend to be

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.469 
in the front of my brow and I tend to be
a<00:01:18.270> little<00:01:18.509> bit<00:01:18.689> sparse<00:01:19.200> toward<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.460> bottom<00:01:20.759> so

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
a little bit sparse toward the bottom so

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.359 
a little bit sparse toward the bottom so
that's<00:01:21.659> where<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:21.869> need<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:22.080> little<00:01:22.350> extra<00:01:22.710> love

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
that's where I need a little extra love

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.580 
that's where I need a little extra love
now<00:01:23.700> we<00:01:23.759> want<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> slip<00:01:24.299> over<00:01:24.450> our<00:01:24.960> brow<00:01:25.140> pencil

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
now we want to slip over our brow pencil

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.060 
now we want to slip over our brow pencil
and<00:01:25.860> kind<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.729> comb<00:01:27.119> through<00:01:27.840> with<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.890> one

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
and kind of comb through with the one

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.370 
and kind of comb through with the one
that's<00:01:29.340> included<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:30.119> this<00:01:30.659> just<00:01:30.930> creates<00:01:31.259> a

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
that's included and this just creates a

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.740 
that's included and this just creates a
softer<00:01:32.070> more<00:01:32.369> natural<00:01:32.430> look<00:01:33.060> to<00:01:33.090> the<00:01:33.329> pencil

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
softer more natural look to the pencil

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.600 
softer more natural look to the pencil
and<00:01:34.079> then<00:01:34.530> you<00:01:34.650> can<00:01:34.829> see<00:01:35.159> where<00:01:35.490> you<00:01:35.579> might

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and then you can see where you might

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.490 
and then you can see where you might
need<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.119> go<00:01:36.270> back<00:01:36.299> and<00:01:36.720> fill<00:01:37.020> in<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.259> little<00:01:37.380> bit

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
need to go back and fill in a little bit

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.249 
need to go back and fill in a little bit
more<00:01:37.829> so<00:01:38.670> as<00:01:38.790> I'm<00:01:38.939> looking<00:01:39.090> I<00:01:39.570> want<00:01:39.780> to<00:01:39.900> define

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
more so as I'm looking I want to define

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.800 
more so as I'm looking I want to define
my<00:01:40.470> arch<00:01:40.740> just<00:01:41.220> a<00:01:41.400> touch<00:01:41.610> more<00:01:41.640> you<00:01:42.540> don't<00:01:42.689> need

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
my arch just a touch more you don't need

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
my arch just a touch more you don't need
to<00:01:42.930> press<00:01:43.110> hard<00:01:43.409> the<00:01:43.680> harder<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:43.979> press<00:01:44.100> the

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
to press hard the harder you press the

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.730 
to press hard the harder you press the
darker<00:01:44.670> they'll<00:01:44.850> go<00:01:45.090> but<00:01:45.810> I<00:01:45.840> like<00:01:46.079> to<00:01:46.229> do<00:01:46.380> soft

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
darker they'll go but I like to do soft

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.050 
darker they'll go but I like to do soft
strokes<00:01:47.070> and<00:01:48.060> I<00:01:48.149> suggest<00:01:48.630> doing<00:01:48.720> soft<00:01:49.140> strokes

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
strokes and I suggest doing soft strokes

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.060 
strokes and I suggest doing soft strokes
so<00:01:51.060> that<00:01:51.090> way<00:01:51.420> we<00:01:52.229> don't<00:01:52.350> get<00:01:52.530> too<00:01:52.680> crazy<00:01:52.829> with

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
so that way we don't get too crazy with

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.649 
so that way we don't get too crazy with
the<00:01:53.250> brow<00:01:53.399> we<00:01:54.060> want<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.420> still<00:01:54.630> look

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
the brow we want it to still look

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.929
