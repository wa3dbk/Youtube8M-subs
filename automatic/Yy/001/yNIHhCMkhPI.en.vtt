00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.429
 one more important 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:28.680
 recent discovery is something that Vedic 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:29.399
 sounds are even more conducive to development 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.199
 brain 

00:00:29.399 --> 00:00:32.519
 gained by practice 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:34.710
 technology maharishi 

00:00:32.519 --> 00:00:37.110
 now a professor will address us 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.079
 fred travis professor of physiology and 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.059
 director of the brain research center 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.159
 consciousness and cognition at the university 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.379
 management of maharishi he will talk about 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:48.839
 the most recent results in his 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:53.940
 research in this area and so 

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:54.930
 Dr. Travis thanks with us today 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.910
 doctor 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.850
 Arjen Ander Institute Director 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.300
 brain research new research with 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 electroencephalography 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.720
 showed that listening vedic 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:09.330
 sounds causes high coherence 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.070
 the brain's electrovolves basis is clearer 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.740
 thinking and more successful action on 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.820
 individual and community level 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.280
 brain work is based on 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:19.770
 electrical impulses to communicate when 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.060
 help words brain cells communicate with each other 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.390
 friend using electric 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.890
 pulses electroencephalograph measures 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.979
 this electrical activity 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.670
 happening the most important parts of the module is 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.489
 brain 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.709
 after all left in the back of the brain 

00:01:32.489 --> 00:01:36.420
 processed visual perception and 

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:38.700
 auditory tactile olfactory and 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.619
 tastes here in this area 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.459
 brain they all add up to a specific 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.220
 picture of the world 

00:01:41.459 --> 00:01:46.770
 the upper part is responsible for the movement we 

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.629
 move your fingers play tennis talking 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.069
 and the grenades they are above while actively 

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:55.349
 part of the brain and highly important 

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:58.530
 the front of the brain is the main 

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:00.989
 head of the whole brain is admission here 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:02.910
 from all parts of the brain integrates and on 

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:06.770
 they are based on a successful plan 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:08.879
 actions and judgments including 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:11.150
 moral as well here 

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:14.069
 supported by a sense of individuality 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.680
 brain waves may be coherent and not 

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:21.750
 coherent here is an example of non coherent 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.340
 waves is the performance of the frontal part 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.269
 brain remove it 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:31.500
 two plots on it are approximately 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:33.720
 two inches apart pay 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.690
 attention to two factors in these two 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.700
 signals of different amplitude at the bottom 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.720
 signal amplitude is significantly less a 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.010
 also Figure bursts do not coincide 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.319
 coherent work means the brain doesn't 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.230
 works as a whole separate 

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:52.290
 parts of the brain do not work consistently with 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:54.450
 other isolated but in contrast 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:57.329
 with this example of coherent work in lol 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:03:00.030
 Moscow, these readings were taken during 

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:02.069
 Listen to Vedic sounds 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:05.280
 focus on higher amplitude and 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.840
 the coincidence of the burst pattern is such 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.810
 brain coherent work is 

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:17.700
 the basis of clear thinking is successful it 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:21.750
 thinking and action and now we 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.760
 see clearly how it happens in 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.950
 normal state when a person is just 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.870
 sits and when he listens to Vedic 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:32.730
 sounds this is doctor david panel 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:36.859
 Lecturer of the University he 

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:38.340
 head elastic cap with sensors 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.970
 catchers 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:47.540
 electrical signals from 32 sections of it 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:51.599
 brain they are connected to 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:56.569
 electroencephalograph and we will see that he 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:56.569
 will show now we see 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.980
 indicators from two points in the frontal part 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.430
 we start with the normal state 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:04.430
 wakefulness 

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:15.440
 This is how the brain works in this 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:19.200
 normal state and now we will turn on 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:21.750
 vedic sounds note how 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.320
 vary the amplitude of the wave and their similarity 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.320
 drawings 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.770
 before 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.840
 he 

00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:49.009
 they Aliya 

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:05.350
 enough let's see what 

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:08.940
 happened we saw what significant 

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:12.330
 changes occurred in just 30 seconds 

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:15.040
 the amplitude of the waves has become much higher and 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:19.080
 similarity of the burst pattern also 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:22.210
 greatly increased this and there are signs 

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:27.190
 high coherence electro wave 

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:31.960
 brain work all the good that can give 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:34.800
 brain work it all gives coherence 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.800
 his work creativity mind 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
 moral 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:46.690
 neuromuscular efficacy self-awareness 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:48.940
 performance improvement and such 

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:51.389
 brain coherent work is observed during 

00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:55.539
 all parts of it 

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:58.570
 the first two signals from the frontal part of the brain 

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:03.030
 doctor pullman and then lower red with 

00:05:58.570 --> 00:06:06.250
 nominal part of the brain and the lowest 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:08.650
 occipital note high 

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:09.460
 the similarity of these waves on a plate of ladies and 

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.789
 pattern 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:14.770
 that is, there is a spread 

00:06:11.789 --> 00:06:16.990
 high coherence out brain with frontal 

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.570
 parts with which we started at all 

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:22.750
 the rest of the brain is global 

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:27.130
 coherence it means the whole brain 

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:30.490
 works as one whole 10 billion 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.340
 neurons in our brain does not act 

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:35.080
 independently in separate 

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:38.349
 isolated areas a 

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:40.180
 as a whole global result 

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:43.990
 coherence achieved due to 

00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:46.180
 listening to Vedic sounds is something 

00:06:43.990 --> 00:06:48.550
 what is such a holistic brain work 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:51.790
 becomes his permanent state 

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:53.110
 and when several thousand people have a bridge 

00:06:51.790 --> 00:06:54.820
 will work so high 

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.100
 orderly lifestyle of everything 

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:59.170
 society will be more orderly 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.920
 holistic brain function is Vedic 

00:06:59.170 --> 00:07:01.920
 brain work
