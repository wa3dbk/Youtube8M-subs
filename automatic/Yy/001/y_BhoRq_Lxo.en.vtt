00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
I'm likely to have the same issues that

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:39.109 
I'm likely to have the same issues that
i<00:01:34.759> had<00:01:35.759> last<00:01:36.090> time<00:01:36.409> with<00:01:37.409> Emory<00:01:37.860> so<00:01:38.610> the<00:01:38.970> high

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
i had last time with Emory so the high

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:42.800 
i had last time with Emory so the high
blood<00:01:39.360> pressure<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.200> low<00:01:40.380> fluid<00:01:41.479> and<00:01:42.479> things

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
blood pressure the low fluid and things

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.170 
blood pressure the low fluid and things
like<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:45.799> yeah<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.100> that's<00:01:47.310> that's<00:01:47.820> the

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
like that so yeah so that's that's the

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.170 
like that so yeah so that's that's the
deal<00:01:48.390> with<00:01:48.570> that<00:01:48.829> so<00:01:49.829> I'll<00:01:50.310> probably<00:01:50.640> end<00:01:51.060> up

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
deal with that so I'll probably end up

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.200 
deal with that so I'll probably end up
going<00:01:51.240> on<00:01:51.750> sick<00:01:52.049> leave<00:01:53.750> early<00:01:54.750> on<00:01:56.210> just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
going on sick leave early on just

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.240 
going on sick leave early on just
because<00:01:57.570> it's<00:01:58.140> probably<00:01:58.320> better<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.770> me<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
because it's probably better for me and

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:04.730 
because it's probably better for me and
the<00:01:59.310> baby<00:01:59.509> to<00:02:00.740> not<00:02:01.740> be<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:03.200> you<00:02:04.200> know<00:02:04.320> stressed

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
the baby to not be so you know stressed

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.490 
the baby to not be so you know stressed
out<00:02:04.950> with<00:02:05.130> work<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.610> stuff<00:02:05.820> like<00:02:06.119> that<00:02:06.180> so<00:02:06.719> yes

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
out with work and stuff like that so yes

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.770 
out with work and stuff like that so yes
i'll<00:02:07.740> probably<00:02:08.009> go<00:02:08.340> on<00:02:08.489> sick<00:02:09.330> leave<00:02:09.509> i'm

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:48.030 
for the weekly non-stress test and the

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:50.990 
for the weekly non-stress test and the
monthly<00:02:48.390> ultrasounds<00:02:49.379> and<00:02:49.849> everything<00:02:50.849> like

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
monthly ultrasounds and everything like

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.379 
monthly ultrasounds and everything like
that<00:02:51.139> in<00:02:52.139> the<00:02:52.769> last<00:02:52.980> trimester<00:02:53.310> which<00:02:53.940> is<00:02:54.150> sort

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:54.389 
that in the last trimester which is sort

00:02:54.389 --> 00:02:56.720 
that in the last trimester which is sort
of<00:02:54.420> what<00:02:54.629> I<00:02:54.659> did<00:02:54.870> last<00:02:55.019> time<00:02:55.319> so<00:02:56.190> now<00:02:56.400> i'm<00:02:56.549> just

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
of what I did last time so now i'm just

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:02.690 
of what I did last time so now i'm just
waiting<00:02:57.079> to<00:02:58.079> find<00:02:58.290> out<00:02:58.530> um<00:03:00.950> like<00:03:01.950> where<00:03:02.670> i

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
waiting to find out um like where i

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.580 
waiting to find out um like where i
would<00:03:02.879> be<00:03:03.030> doing<00:03:03.239> that<00:03:03.510> and<00:03:03.870> if<00:03:04.170> they're<00:03:04.470> going

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
would be doing that and if they're going

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.210 
would be doing that and if they're going
to<00:03:04.680> do<00:03:04.799> it<00:03:04.889> the<00:03:04.950> same<00:03:05.129> way<00:03:05.159> with<00:03:05.519> this<00:03:05.700> baby<00:03:07.220> but

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
to do it the same way with this baby but

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.750 
to do it the same way with this baby but
yeah<00:03:08.400> apparently<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:09.829> regular<00:03:10.829> level<00:03:11.099> for

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
yeah apparently a regular level for

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:15.140 
yeah apparently a regular level for
alpha-fetoprotein<00:03:12.299> at<00:03:13.200> that<00:03:13.530> age<00:03:13.859> is<00:03:14.790> two

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150 
alpha-fetoprotein at that age is two

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:22.430 
alpha-fetoprotein at that age is two
point<00:03:15.480> oh<00:03:17.389> five<00:03:18.389> and<00:03:19.340> we<00:03:20.340> were<00:03:20.459> at<00:03:20.609> 3.03<00:03:21.480> so<00:03:22.230> it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:22.440 
point oh five and we were at 3.03 so it

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.150 
point oh five and we were at 3.03 so it
was<00:03:22.560> quite<00:03:22.799> high<00:03:23.129> she<00:03:23.459> said<00:03:23.730> so<00:03:24.480> yeah<00:03:25.199> anyway

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:26.160 
was quite high she said so yeah anyway

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:32.360 
was quite high she said so yeah anyway
so<00:03:27.290> it<00:03:28.290> may<00:03:28.500> just<00:03:28.530> be<00:03:29.900> it<00:03:30.900> may<00:03:31.049> just<00:03:31.079> be<00:03:31.349> me<00:03:31.949> that

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
so it may just be it may just be me that

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.819 
so it may just be it may just be me that
makes<00:03:32.669> that<00:03:32.970> protein<00:03:33.569> but<00:03:34.319> I<00:03:34.379> guess<00:03:34.650> we'll

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:34.829 
makes that protein but I guess we'll

00:03:34.829 --> 00:03:36.830 
makes that protein but I guess we'll
find<00:03:35.040> out<00:03:35.190> I'm<00:03:35.370> thinking<00:03:36.359> I'm<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.629> to<00:03:36.720> get

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
find out I'm thinking I'm going to get

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.650 
find out I'm thinking I'm going to get
tested<00:03:37.260> once<00:03:37.470> I'm<00:03:37.650> not<00:03:37.889> pregnant<00:03:38.760> to<00:03:39.209> see<00:03:39.419> if<00:03:39.540> I

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
tested once I'm not pregnant to see if I

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.460 
tested once I'm not pregnant to see if I
still<00:03:39.720> have<00:03:40.109> the<00:03:40.319> protein<00:03:41.989> they<00:03:42.989> asked<00:03:43.260> other

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:43.470 
still have the protein they asked other

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.960 
still have the protein they asked other
than<00:03:43.799> that<00:03:43.949> they're<00:03:44.250> going<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> have<00:03:44.609> me<00:03:44.639> come

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
than that they're going to have me come

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.920 
than that they're going to have me come
back<00:03:45.120> for<00:03:45.419> another<00:03:45.660> ultrasound<00:03:46.079> at<00:03:46.440> bc<00:03:46.769> womens

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:47.930 
back for another ultrasound at bc womens

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.689 
back for another ultrasound at bc womens
between<00:03:49.069> 18<00:03:50.069> to<00:03:50.099> 20<00:03:51.560> weeks<00:03:52.560> so<00:03:53.220> in<00:03:53.340> a<00:03:53.400> couple<00:03:53.549> of

00:03:53.689 --> 00:03:53.699 
between 18 to 20 weeks so in a couple of

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:55.879 
between 18 to 20 weeks so in a couple of
weeks<00:03:53.760> basically<00:03:54.480> they're<00:03:55.470> going<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.650> call<00:03:55.829> me

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
weeks basically they're going to call me

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:57.830 
weeks basically they're going to call me
and<00:03:56.159> let<00:03:56.280> me<00:03:56.310> know<00:03:56.430> what<00:03:56.699> I'm<00:03:56.849> coming<00:03:57.209> in<00:03:57.329> just

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
and let me know what I'm coming in just

00:03:57.840 --> 00:03:59.839 
and let me know what I'm coming in just
because<00:03:58.190> right<00:03:59.190> now<00:03:59.220> the<00:03:59.400> baby's<00:03:59.730> still

00:03:59.839 --> 00:03:59.849 
because right now the baby's still

00:03:59.849 --> 00:04:03.110 
because right now the baby's still
pretty<00:04:00.150> small<00:04:00.269> and<00:04:01.459> they<00:04:02.459> need<00:04:02.639> a<00:04:02.669> better<00:04:02.849> look

00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:03.120 
pretty small and they need a better look

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.210 
pretty small and they need a better look
at<00:04:03.299> it<00:04:03.359> so<00:04:03.780> I<00:04:04.019> think<00:04:04.139> everything's<00:04:04.739> fine<00:04:04.949> with

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
at it so I think everything's fine with

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.939 
at it so I think everything's fine with
the<00:04:05.340> baby<00:04:05.519> because<00:04:06.510> we<00:04:06.720> saw<00:04:06.900> the<00:04:06.959> spine<00:04:07.379> and

00:04:07.939 --> 00:04:07.949 
the baby because we saw the spine and

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:10.819 
the baby because we saw the spine and
everything<00:04:08.489> and<00:04:08.849> yeah<00:04:09.659> and<00:04:10.079> it's<00:04:10.319> pretty

00:04:10.819 --> 00:04:10.829 
everything and yeah and it's pretty

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:14.599 
everything and yeah and it's pretty
healthy<00:04:11.310> moving<00:04:11.940> baby<00:04:13.010> but<00:04:14.010> anyway<00:04:14.340> that<00:04:14.370> is

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:14.609 
healthy moving baby but anyway that is

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.050 
healthy moving baby but anyway that is
