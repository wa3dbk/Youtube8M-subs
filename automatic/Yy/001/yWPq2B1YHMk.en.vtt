00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:10.440
 a little about mounting a friend photo itself 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.599
 snap I a lot with them 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.990
 experimented here came to the conclusion 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:19.189
 which is for catching from shore eighth which 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:21.869
 doing up from the boat basically 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.289
 optimal installation at which the hook 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:27.840
 fixed motionless on the fishing line that is 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:31.700
 not using special hooks or there 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:35.550
 knot palomar which fixes the hook 

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:38.870
 perpendicular to the fishing line using normal 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:41.190
 fasteners our usual fastener to you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:45.390
 fixed on the fishing line ordinary 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:48.989
 self- knotting upper part 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.680
 the leash is also with the usual loop for 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.039
 mounts 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:55.350
 carabiner to the main line and lower 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.520
 tooling part 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.520
 sinkers sinkers 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.769
 itself by the hook is attached with 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:08.270
 fasteners 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.880
 as you see she break the leash 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:19.500
 tied himself hook they don and 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:22.229
 all basically no particular know-how 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.060
 there are no nuances such an installation 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:29.369
 gives more freedom to the bait itself 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.920
 After all, she can pretty big 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:36.240
 the limits 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.009
 deviate on the carabiners this 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:41.790
 quite useful since Ilya 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:44.880
 on the bottom when casting especially savings when 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.640
 the long cast is taut 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:50.880
 fairly acute angle wildebeest if fasten 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:55.430
 hook chicken in the classic version he 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:59.159
 will go almost perpendicular to the fishing line 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:01.120
 so for the chain of that 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.080
 bait for fish 

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.850
 it seems to me greatly reduced and 

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.380
 the bait is strictly fixed moment 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.140
 stop on stupidly starts so 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:14.230
 rotate the rowing it is also not very 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:17.200
 like this option mount it 

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:19.660
 goes almost parallel to the bottom of course 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:22.380
 tube mean not fast wiring 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.750
 although quick wiring is really necessary 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.540
 in some cases it is very useful with 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:31.750
 stop in the case of such a statement 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:32.080
 the songs just turn around but 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.430
 and 

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:39.520
 vary angle located no bait 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:43.410
 melt slightly spent she rose will begin 

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:45.520
 gently lowering can turn around and 

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.870
 side to side cartoon 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.390
 so I prefer to use on 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:55.030
 buddy active bait not classic 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.920
 rock reeling such semi-rigid without 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 own games 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.550
 let's say soft when washing no more 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:05.200
 shake tail size depends 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:08.770
 Of course, how do you like this? 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.800
 antique critters for perch practically 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:15.430
 any size fits well that not everyone 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.840
 mouth rejoice in a large piece and here as 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:20.860
 see everything is very simple 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:24.190
 what are the advantages of such a snap in 

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:26.680
 first how would you tie a hook 

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:30.670
 the classic version of the floor by the mayor 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:34.660
 or special tubular hooks in this 

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:37.660
 this node is very weak and often cliffs 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:42.040
 happens exactly on the hooks especially 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:44.260
 sorry when caught a decent fish yes 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:47.980
 and unworthily everything turns out a loss and 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:51.040
 sinker practically accounted for arrival 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:53.850
 for the entire installation in this case, this is already 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.560
 very durable practically not exposed 

00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:58.690
 such loads as using hooks 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:02.100
 not only is no such tied 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:02.100
 for some reason in these places 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.670
 Lizka quickly wear out he just 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:12.190
 I can very quickly change opened shot 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.300
 hook all she ready you can 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.930
 descriptive hook 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:19.870
 larger other bait something 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.070
 already quite quite useful with joy 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:26.050
 Pointing to lose a lot of time and there is no 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:28.120
 opportunities to wind a lot of different 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:30.160
 montages bandage with you understand on 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:34.210
 fishing is not very nice to do 

00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:34.660
 such creativity if there is no time 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.860
 special 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:41.520
 and in the competition competitions us 

00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:46.360
 rescued repeatedly such an installation 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:49.450
 on perch very well you perch pike 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:52.420
 husband and pike is another question of course pike 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.930
 can sweep away handing out so this and not 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.350
 will help 

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:59.290
 you have to leave a small string with 

00:04:56.350 --> 00:05:02.940
 a parties carabiner astra night 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.110
 all problems are presented 

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.370
 chord may rather small not 

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:09.750
 be sure to put the pipe to move 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:13.920
 adding straight reaching sinker 

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:16.150
 the length of the installation itself you too 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.360
 just do not ship it can be changed 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:23.410
 large range standard centimeters 

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:25.180
 40 years ashore as if a little smaller 

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.740
 it all depends on i'm fish is in catch 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.240
 the grass can almost do 

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.970
 so that it will be almost over 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:32.440
 right to go and the server is grass what 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.350
 grass hard soft here options 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:40.240
 million for various conclusions 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:45.870
 crit is better to check in practice so 

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:49.410
 So I recommend this simple variation 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.410
 simple and useful
