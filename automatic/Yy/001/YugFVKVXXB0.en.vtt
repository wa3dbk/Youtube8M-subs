00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.360
 we're back with the automatic your 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.700
 program on the world of automobiles 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.590
 here in the band for all Brazil do not know 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.839
 forget every Saturday from one 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.390
 in the afternoon and now with a well- 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.800
 curious there are lots of creative people out there 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.020
 that turns the car into a 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.480
 true work of art on wheels 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:37.320
 you would be able and would 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:39.239
 paint your car so the street art is 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.370
 very well known in the major centers 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.980
 and functions as a manifestation of 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.579
 of the reality of life in the day-to-day 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.579
 asphalt 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.920
 graphite is today the largest representation 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.870
 of this artistic expression 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.449
 it is enough to observe the space 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.199
 city ​​walls an art that does not have 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.090
 Limits 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.539
 so much so that it is now also reaching 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.539
 automobiles 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.060
 the live paint outdoor painting is a 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.280
 mode of art made to draw the 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.930
 attention of the public but in the case 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.430
 of these two young people 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:19.530
 they went from conventional to 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.180
 really fill the cars bodywork 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.520
 too much ink 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:26.189
 both spoke point could take this place 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.630
 so dirty in the joke to join the dash and 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.640
 in the ete commented thus 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.619
 or it would be nice if it took for a car 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.520
 something more dynamic in which he spoke 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:36.450
 let's play 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:40.409
 the car as it is something different as it is not 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:44.040
 a square panel that paints and 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:45.000
 wall makes the panel very interesting 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.100
 to work 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.380
 the duo frequently participates in 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.810
 events where the main objective is 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.360
 attract the public to this type of art 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:56.340
 in the case of automobiles each category 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.530
 has its own style to which the 

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:01.439
 artists illustration seeks to accompany 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.329
 we usually think about the layout of the 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.240
 car we like a lot of 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:08.250
 to evaluate which car model is the color 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.440
 to be able to make the color choice goes 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.599
 think of which one to apply the 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.340
 people like to follow the line a lot 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:15.420
 of the car so whenever I had 

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.220
 a little detail is more 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.810
 differential in the car we want to use 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.420
 this along with the art 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:23.819
 after setting the drawing on the paper are 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:26.040
 made some markings for ink 

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:28.709
 to adhere in the tin a pen is used 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.720
 special and only a few minutes 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.230
 work so that the figure begins to 

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.230
 take shape 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:51.959
 about the car you can fill 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:54.720
 much much more to the vehicle and art 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.700
 on wheels already arrived in the galleries 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:59.099
 this Argentine artist who lives in são 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.640
 paulo a year and a half ago decided to leave the 

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:04.640
 screens and paint the body of a fusca 67 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:22.440
 very good water that leaves and then has 

00:03:19.859 --> 00:03:24.299
 a sanded process that is important 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:32.880
 that left her without water 

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:36.799
 richa with normal dry water with 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:39.959
 a great one is drawn with no 

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:42.359
 during the painting took two months to 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:45.120
 be ready and on the screen or better in 

00:03:42.359 --> 00:03:47.910
 components were used. 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.980
 Style curious artist and different 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:52.380
 true that this initiative is in 

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:55.019
 think if the car that is so present 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.510
 in our day to day you can even one day 

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:59.760
 gain so many vivid colors and designs 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:04.010
 how these fragments turn into a 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.010
 kind of mobile artwork 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:13.360
 I see the one that has a thing above all 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:16.269
 are paulo to relate the elegance with 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:19.090
 and black with and gray with one thing one 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.310
 little not to expose too much and 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:24.010
 Because I'm walking in this car. 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:25.570
 to that for a moment and start 

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:29.050
 take a photo the streets get a little 

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:30.760
 troubled I think the one that could 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:32.650
 render a little more color on the street 

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:36.600
 payment colors give a little more 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:36.600
 It's cooler than those gray pants
