00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:17.250
 so a long time I had to do it 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:19.720

 Let's start this brand new one right away 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:30.870
 adventure in the yog box we see that 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:34.090
 world is created 

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:42.670
 let's hope it's nice 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:45.040
 come on if ax wins ok we do 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.540
 load the world 

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:52.900
 we open the inventory we start immediately 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:01.750
 world chart the creation quest la miller 

00:00:52.900 --> 00:01:03.430
 and then activates or who then I choose 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:07.120
 I don't know what this is anyway 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 we have the minimum poles as you see above 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:13.510
 we have the days that pass is 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:18.130
 experience in the first hole inventory 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:21.159
 and nothing the york box and so from the pits 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.969
 I will explain briefly an adventure 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.490
 boys is a survival adventure 

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:30.549
 more than anything else where we find others 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.630
 other other mobs and other things 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:37.289
 however, start collecting immediately 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.289
 a bit of wool 

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:45.420
 here's how you see guys have found 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:49.780
 a native resting the woodpecker hate of 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:53.860
 some 10 shit or not I'm dying 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:56.470
 guys i 'm dying because 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:02:01.539
 fortunately because here boys 

00:01:56.470 --> 00:02:04.959
 when he died the cure disappeared 

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:08.979
 all the inventory 

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:10.899
 if I am not mistaken , hearts are the experience 

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:15.489
 that is, that you have accumulated over the course of 

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:17.650
 days if it takes them to 0 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:19.690
 whenever it means experience 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.209
 therefore hearts also increase 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:23.859
 at the beginning it will be necessary to be careful or 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:28.959

00:02:23.859 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.500

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:41.049
 I wanted to collect so much wood 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.329
 however, the same is always better 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.530
