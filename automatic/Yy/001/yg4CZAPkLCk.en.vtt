good so anyways I started by just

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:06.980 
good so anyways I started by just
building<00:02:04.439> a<00:02:04.530> wood<00:02:04.740> frame<00:02:05.659> for<00:02:06.659> different

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
building a wood frame for different

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.260 
building a wood frame for different
elevations<00:02:07.500> of<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.829> wanted<00:02:08.250> and<00:02:08.700> then

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
elevations of what I wanted and then

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.720 
elevations of what I wanted and then
what<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:09.929> did<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.170> I<00:02:10.440> took<00:02:11.099> chunks<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.520> styrofoam

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
what I did is I took chunks of styrofoam

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:12.870 
what I did is I took chunks of styrofoam
screwed<00:02:12.330> them<00:02:12.480> down

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
screwed them down

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.230 
screwed them down
to<00:02:13.030> get<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.980> layout<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.280> some<00:02:15.580> what<00:02:15.790> kind<00:02:16.030> of<00:02:16.120> a

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:16.240 
to get the layout of some what kind of a

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.160 
to get the layout of some what kind of a
rock<00:02:16.650> area<00:02:17.880> but<00:02:18.880> I<00:02:19.180> think<00:02:19.540> they'll<00:02:19.690> be<00:02:19.840> adding

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
rock area but I think they'll be adding

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.980 
rock area but I think they'll be adding
more<00:02:20.350> spray<00:02:20.740> foam<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.280> stuff<00:02:21.520> and<00:02:21.960> then<00:02:22.960> I

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:22.990 
more spray foam and stuff and then I

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:25.590 
more spray foam and stuff and then I
took<00:02:23.140> cardboard<00:02:23.800> add<00:02:24.040> contours<00:02:24.820> and<00:02:25.270> just

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 
took cardboard add contours and just

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.210 
took cardboard add contours and just
bent<00:02:25.900> I<00:02:26.080> don't<00:02:26.230> know<00:02:26.290> if<00:02:26.410> you<00:02:26.530> can<00:02:26.710> see<00:02:26.980> it<00:02:27.100> on

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
bent I don't know if you can see it on

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:32.280 
bent I don't know if you can see it on
the<00:02:27.370> foam<00:02:27.610> but<00:02:28.060> I<00:02:29.040> added<00:02:30.390> all<00:02:31.390> kinds<00:02:31.420> of<00:02:31.960> tried

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
the foam but I added all kinds of tried

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:37.830 
the foam but I added all kinds of tried
to<00:02:32.470> get<00:02:32.620> the<00:02:32.920> different<00:02:35.700> natural<00:02:36.840> rolling

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
to get the different natural rolling

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:47.040 
to get the different natural rolling
landscape<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:45.160> bent<00:02:45.430> the<00:02:45.910> card<00:02:46.150> board

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
landscape and just bent the card board

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.900 
landscape and just bent the card board
forced<00:02:47.410> it<00:02:47.590> into<00:02:47.800> place<00:02:48.040> of<00:02:48.280> how<00:02:48.400> I<00:02:48.430> wanted<00:02:48.820> it

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
forced it into place of how I wanted it

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.590 
forced it into place of how I wanted it
to<00:02:49.060> look<00:02:49.270> and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.920> stapled<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.000> with<00:02:52.210> quarter

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
to look and then stapled it with quarter

00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.920 
to look and then stapled it with quarter

big<00:03:02.110> clam<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.770> course<00:03:02.980> I'll<00:03:03.160> have<00:03:03.280> some<00:03:03.460> rocks

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
big clam of course I'll have some rocks

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.050 
big clam of course I'll have some rocks
in<00:03:03.910> there<00:03:06.870> but<00:03:07.870> here<00:03:08.470> I<00:03:08.710> plan<00:03:08.980> on<00:03:09.010> I<00:03:09.640> don't<00:03:09.850> know

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.610 
reptile of any sort they'll have water
dishes<00:03:15.910> then<00:03:16.480> they<00:03:16.600> look<00:03:16.810> like<00:03:16.990> a<00:03:17.020> rock<00:03:17.290> well

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
dishes then they look like a rock well

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:18.720 
dishes then they look like a rock well
I'm<00:03:17.710> gonna<00:03:17.860> get<00:03:18.040> a<00:03:18.070> bigger<00:03:18.310> one

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
I'm gonna get a bigger one

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.170 
I'm gonna get a bigger one
put<00:03:19.300> it<00:03:19.420> here<00:03:19.780> with<00:03:20.470> a<00:03:20.710> return<00:03:21.340> hose<00:03:21.610> from<00:03:21.970> it

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
put it here with a return hose from it

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.470 
put it here with a return hose from it
with<00:03:22.390> water<00:03:23.250> it'll<00:03:24.250> be<00:03:24.400> through<00:03:24.670> this<00:03:25.060> all<00:03:25.270> be

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:25.480 
with water it'll be through this all be

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:26.850 
with water it'll be through this all be
spray<00:03:25.750> for<00:03:25.930> them<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.200> course<00:03:26.410> this<00:03:26.560> all<00:03:26.770> will

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
spray for them of course this all will

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.730 
spray for them of course this all will
be<00:03:26.950> rock<00:03:27.220> on<00:03:27.430> the<00:03:27.520> back<00:03:28.110> to<00:03:29.110> a<00:03:29.140> fountain<00:03:29.470> over

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:29.740 
be rock on the back to a fountain over

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.940 
be rock on the back to a fountain over
here<00:03:30.160> that'll<00:03:30.640> sit<00:03:30.910> inside<00:03:31.420> of<00:03:32.350> there<00:03:32.740> and

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
here that'll sit inside of there and

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.770 
here that'll sit inside of there and
then<00:03:33.640> the<00:03:33.790> fountain<00:03:34.090> of<00:03:34.120> course<00:03:34.330> of<00:03:34.450> e<00:03:34.540> rocks

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:34.780 
then the fountain of course of e rocks

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.510 
then the fountain of course of e rocks
which<00:03:35.020> will<00:03:35.170> run<00:03:35.350> down<00:03:35.590> into<00:03:36.130> this<00:03:36.280> which

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:36.520 
which will run down into this which

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.600 
which will run down into this which
would<00:03:36.640> be<00:03:36.700> lined<00:03:37.000> with<00:03:37.120> a<00:03:37.240> rubber<00:03:38.230> membrane<00:03:38.610> to

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 
would be lined with a rubber membrane to

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.430 
would be lined with a rubber membrane to
simulate<00:03:40.060> a<00:03:40.090> creek<00:03:40.480> and<00:03:40.750> then<00:03:40.960> I'm<00:03:41.080> going<00:03:41.290> to

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
simulate a creek and then I'm going to

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.580 
simulate a creek and then I'm going to
glue<00:03:42.400> rocks<00:03:43.030> in<00:03:43.360> it<00:03:43.450> so<00:03:43.660> that<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> is<00:03:44.290> like<00:03:44.560> a

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
glue rocks in it so that it is like a

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.699 
glue rocks in it so that it is like a
rock<00:03:44.860> and<00:03:45.130> then<00:03:45.220> it'll<00:03:45.370> be<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.550> continuous

00:03:46.699 --> 00:03:46.709 
rock and then it'll be a continuous

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.690 
rock and then it'll be a continuous
flowing<00:03:47.820> Creek<00:03:49.800> but<00:03:50.800> the<00:03:50.920> biggest<00:03:51.280> thing<00:03:51.520> is

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
flowing Creek but the biggest thing is

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:55.800 
flowing Creek but the biggest thing is
his<00:03:52.060> patience<00:03:52.660> take<00:03:53.260> your<00:03:53.410> time<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.570> plan<00:03:55.570> out

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
his patience take your time and plan out

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:57.360 
his patience take your time and plan out
what<00:03:56.020> you<00:03:56.140> want<00:03:56.320> to<00:03:56.380> do<00:03:56.500> first<00:03:56.770> I<00:03:57.040> got<00:03:57.190> a<00:03:57.220> little

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
what you want to do first I got a little

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.100 
what you want to do first I got a little
excited<00:03:57.700> and<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:57.940> just<00:03:58.150> jumped<00:03:58.450> into<00:03:58.630> it<00:03:58.900> and

00:03:59.100 --> 00:03:59.110 
excited and I just jumped into it and

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.020 
excited and I just jumped into it and
then<00:03:59.500> I<00:03:59.530> just<00:03:59.830> ended<00:04:00.160> up<00:04:00.250> ripping<00:04:00.430> half<00:04:00.790> of<00:04:00.910> it

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:01.030 
then I just ended up ripping half of it

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.440 
then I just ended up ripping half of it
apart<00:04:01.300> because<00:04:01.540> it<00:04:02.520> didn't<00:04:03.520> blend<00:04:04.120> because

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
apart because it didn't blend because

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.080 
apart because it didn't blend because
you<00:04:04.570> want<00:04:04.750> it<00:04:04.840> to<00:04:04.959> blend<00:04:05.340> I'm<00:04:06.340> pretty<00:04:06.850> new<00:04:07.060> to

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
you want it to blend I'm pretty new to

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:09.449 
you want it to blend I'm pretty new to
crawling<00:04:07.600> but<00:04:07.780> did<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.530> lot<00:04:08.709> of<00:04:08.740> research<00:04:09.220> and

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:09.459 
crawling but did a lot of research and

00:04:09.459 --> 00:04:11.850 
crawling but did a lot of research and
the<00:04:09.550> biggest<00:04:09.880> thing<00:04:10.060> is<00:04:10.209> is<00:04:10.390> you<00:04:10.510> just<00:04:10.860> you

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:11.860 
the biggest thing is is you just you

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:14.520 
the biggest thing is is you just you
don't<00:04:12.010> want<00:04:12.280> it<00:04:12.370> to<00:04:13.050> what<00:04:14.050> am<00:04:14.140> I<00:04:14.200> looking<00:04:14.350> for

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:14.530 
don't want it to what am I looking for

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.410 
don't want it to what am I looking for
you<00:04:14.770> you<00:04:14.860> don't<00:04:15.040> want<00:04:15.220> it<00:04:15.310> to<00:04:15.400> be<00:04:15.550> impossible

00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:16.420 
you you don't want it to be impossible

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.320 
you you don't want it to be impossible
right<00:04:16.780> off<00:04:16.959> the<00:04:17.080> get-go<00:04:17.290> it<00:04:17.500> should<00:04:17.680> start<00:04:17.950> off

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:18.330 
right off the get-go it should start off

00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:21.510 
right off the get-go it should start off
fairly<00:04:19.330> easy<00:04:19.510> and<00:04:19.840> then<00:04:20.200> get<00:04:20.410> harder<00:04:20.709> as<00:04:20.890> you

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
fairly easy and then get harder as you

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:23.850 
fairly easy and then get harder as you
progress<00:04:21.700> through<00:04:22.210> the<00:04:22.330> course<00:04:22.620> but<00:04:23.620> I<00:04:23.680> also

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
progress through the course but I also

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:26.070 
progress through the course but I also
kind<00:04:24.280> of<00:04:24.430> tried<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.640> make<00:04:24.880> this<00:04:25.060> one<00:04:25.300> so<00:04:25.900> I

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
kind of tried to make this one so I

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.179 
kind of tried to make this one so I
out<00:04:26.169> of<00:04:26.319> course<00:04:26.560> and<00:04:26.919> a<00:04:27.490> play<00:04:28.300> area<00:04:28.330> of<00:04:28.780> course

00:04:29.179 --> 00:04:29.189 
out of course and a play area of course
