video<00:00:07.500> in<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.490> video<00:00:08.639> here<00:00:09.030> we<00:00:09.179> have<00:00:09.330> some

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
video in this video here we have some

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:11.990 
video in this video here we have some
numbers<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.830> are<00:00:10.950> imported<00:00:11.490> and<00:00:11.639> there<00:00:11.849> are

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
numbers that are imported and there are

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.759 
numbers that are imported and there are
commas<00:00:12.870> where<00:00:13.110> they're<00:00:13.259> supposed<00:00:13.590> to<00:00:13.679> be

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
commas where they're supposed to be

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.910 
commas where they're supposed to be
decimals<00:00:14.519> so<00:00:15.030> we<00:00:15.179> need<00:00:15.330> to<00:00:15.509> convert<00:00:16.320> these<00:00:16.560> in

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
decimals so we need to convert these in

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.859 
decimals so we need to convert these in
essence<00:00:17.310> these<00:00:17.460> are<00:00:17.609> considered<00:00:18.240> text

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
essence these are considered text

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.840 
essence these are considered text
because<00:00:19.109> it<00:00:19.260> sees<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.859> comment<00:00:20.430> it<00:00:20.520> goes<00:00:20.640> up

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
because it sees that comment it goes up

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.120 
because it sees that comment it goes up
this<00:00:21.150> is<00:00:21.300> text<00:00:21.720> but<00:00:22.020> we<00:00:22.140> need<00:00:22.289> to<00:00:22.470> convert<00:00:22.980> them

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:23.130 
this is text but we need to convert them

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.710 
this is text but we need to convert them
to<00:00:23.160> numbers<00:00:23.550> there's<00:00:23.760> two<00:00:24.000> ways<00:00:24.210> we<00:00:24.390> can<00:00:24.510> do<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
to numbers there's two ways we can do it

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:27.500 
to numbers there's two ways we can do it
we<00:00:25.199> do<00:00:25.350> it<00:00:25.380> with<00:00:25.590> a<00:00:25.680> formula<00:00:26.130> or<00:00:26.340> text<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
we do it with a formula or text to

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.169 
we do it with a formula or text to
columns<00:00:27.840> now<00:00:28.740> if<00:00:28.890> you<00:00:29.039> need<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.609> some<00:00:29.789> reason

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
columns now if you need for some reason

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.590 
columns now if you need for some reason
the<00:00:30.689> source<00:00:30.990> data<00:00:31.349> when<00:00:31.710> updated<00:00:32.579> have<00:00:33.390> the

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
the source data when updated have the

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.990 
the source data when updated have the
result<00:00:34.020> updated<00:00:34.770> that's<00:00:34.980> why<00:00:35.579> you<00:00:35.640> do

00:00:35.990 --> 00:00:36.000 
result updated that's why you do

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.209 
result updated that's why you do
formulas<00:00:36.570> but<00:00:36.780> if<00:00:37.320> you<00:00:37.500> just<00:00:37.680> want<00:00:37.829> to<00:00:37.860> convert

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
formulas but if you just want to convert

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.610 
formulas but if you just want to convert
them<00:00:38.399> text<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.000> column<00:00:39.540> absolutely<00:00:40.350> rules

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
them text to column absolutely rules

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.930 
them text to column absolutely rules
data<00:00:41.750> text<00:00:42.750> to<00:00:43.170> columns<00:00:43.559> right<00:00:44.219> here<00:00:44.640> the

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
data text to columns right here the

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:51.920 
data text to columns right here the
keyboard<00:00:45.600> shortcut<00:00:46.289> is<00:00:46.530> alt<00:00:47.030> AE<00:00:48.739> alt<00:00:49.739> AE<00:00:50.930> I'm

keyboard shortcut is alt AE alt AE I'm

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.900 
keyboard shortcut is alt AE alt AE I'm
going<00:00:52.110> to<00:00:52.199> say<00:00:52.320> fixed<00:00:52.920> width<00:00:53.399> because<00:00:53.789> we

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
going to say fixed width because we

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.510 
going to say fixed width because we
don't<00:00:54.090> need<00:00:54.300> to<00:00:54.480> separate<00:00:55.350> out<00:00:55.530> really<00:00:56.370> we're

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
don't need to separate out really we're

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.369 
don't need to separate out really we're
using<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.969> text<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.510> columns<00:00:57.690> not<00:00:58.170> to

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
using the text to columns not to

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.680 
using the text to columns not to
separate<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.980> data<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.520> to<00:00:59.730> convert<00:01:00.239> it<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
separate the data but to convert it so

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.470 
separate the data but to convert it so
next<00:01:00.960> we<00:01:01.710> don't<00:01:01.890> need<00:01:02.730> to<00:01:02.850> do<00:01:02.969> anything<00:01:03.180> here

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
next we don't need to do anything here

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.120 
next we don't need to do anything here
next<00:01:05.570> nothing<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.780> except<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:07.740> this

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
next nothing here except for this

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.310 
next nothing here except for this
advance<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:09.119> simply<00:01:09.600> need<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.840> tell<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
advance we simply need to tell it

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.770 
advance we simply need to tell it
decimal<00:01:11.280> separator<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.960> comma<00:01:13.680> and<00:01:14.100> then

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:14.780 
decimal separator is a comma and then

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.499 
decimal separator is a comma and then
click<00:01:15.780> OK<00:01:16.140> now<00:01:16.950> we<00:01:17.009> could<00:01:17.460> click<00:01:17.700> finish<00:01:18.090> if<00:01:18.270> we

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
click OK now we could click finish if we

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.960 
click OK now we could click finish if we
want<00:01:18.750> it<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:18.990> dump<00:01:19.229> it<00:01:19.380> in<00:01:19.530> replace<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> many

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
want it to dump it in replace and many

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.910 
want it to dump it in replace and many
times<00:01:21.299> you<00:01:21.450> know<00:01:21.570> you<00:01:21.630> do<00:01:21.900> not<00:01:22.140> want<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.710> data

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
times you know you do not want that data

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.240 
times you know you do not want that data
so<00:01:23.130> then<00:01:23.280> just<00:01:23.490> click<00:01:23.670> finish<00:01:24.830> however<00:01:25.830> we<00:01:26.070> can

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
so then just click finish however we can

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.490 
so then just click finish however we can
change<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.790> destination<00:01:27.360> cell<00:01:27.810> also<00:01:28.020> and<00:01:28.380> so

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
change the destination cell also and so

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.020 
change the destination cell also and so
instead<00:01:28.890> of<00:01:29.009> doing<00:01:29.460> it<00:01:29.520> right<00:01:29.670> there<00:01:29.850> if<00:01:29.939> you

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
instead of doing it right there if you

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.609 
instead of doing it right there if you
do<00:01:30.150> it<00:01:30.270> there<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.600> just<00:01:30.630> replaces<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.409> data

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
do it there it just replaces the data

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.580 
do it there it just replaces the data
which<00:01:31.890> is<00:01:31.920> great<00:01:32.490> for<00:01:32.909> many<00:01:33.150> cases<00:01:33.630> but<00:01:34.470> in

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
which is great for many cases but in

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.280 
which is great for many cases but in
this<00:01:34.710> case<00:01:34.890> I'm<00:01:35.100> going<00:01:35.670> to<00:01:35.850> keep<00:01:36.630> the<00:01:36.810> original

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this case I'm going to keep the original

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:38.539 
this case I'm going to keep the original
data<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.740> then<00:01:37.829> dump<00:01:38.070> it<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.460> then

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
data and then dump it here and then

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.819 
data and then dump it here and then
click<00:01:38.729> finish<00:01:38.759> and<00:01:39.210> boom<00:01:39.390> there<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.900> for<00:01:40.770> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
click finish and boom there it is for a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.490 
click finish and boom there it is for a
formula<00:01:41.430> will<00:01:41.909> use<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.360> substitute<00:01:43.229> again

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
formula will use the substitute again

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.440 
formula will use the substitute again
why<00:01:43.680> would<00:01:43.890> you<00:01:44.040> use<00:01:44.250> why<00:01:44.640> do<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:45.030> use<00:01:45.180> form

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
why would you use why do you use form

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.069 
why would you use why do you use form
this<00:01:45.570> why<00:01:45.780> we're<00:01:46.049> formulas<00:01:46.649> invented<00:01:47.220> by

00:01:48.069 --> 00:01:48.079 
this why we're formulas invented by

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.080 
this why we're formulas invented by
Bricklin<00:01:49.079> and<00:01:49.320> Frankston<00:01:49.799> because<00:01:50.159> source

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
Bricklin and Frankston because source

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.480 
Bricklin and Frankston because source
data<00:01:51.540> you<00:01:51.810> put<00:01:52.049> in<00:01:52.170> cells<00:01:52.500> then<00:01:52.890> formulas

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
data you put in cells then formulas

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.819 
data you put in cells then formulas
automatically<00:01:54.119> update<00:01:54.479> so<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.170> this<00:01:55.770> is

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
automatically update so here this is

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.260 
automatically update so here this is
going<00:01:56.250> to<00:01:56.310> be<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.640> bit<00:01:56.820> more<00:01:57.000> involved

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
going to be a little bit more involved

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.060 
that this is not a number because it's

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.910

plus any uh any math operation on the
number<00:02:39.940> stored<00:02:40.390> as<00:02:40.600> text<00:02:40.770> will<00:02:41.770> convert<00:02:42.250> it

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
number stored as text will convert it

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.490 
number stored as text will convert it
back<00:02:42.640> to<00:02:43.300> a<00:02:43.540> number<00:02:43.780> so<00:02:44.020> it<00:02:44.110> doesn't<00:02:44.350> matter

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
back to a number so it doesn't matter

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.260 
back to a number so it doesn't matter
you<00:02:44.650> can<00:02:44.770> multiply<00:02:45.070> by<00:02:45.459> one<00:02:45.700> divided<00:02:46.000> by<00:02:46.030> one

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
you can multiply by one divided by one

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.210 
you can multiply by one divided by one
exponent<00:02:47.110> I'm<00:02:47.380> just<00:02:47.560> going<00:02:47.680> to<00:02:47.709> add<00:02:47.890> zero

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
exponent I'm just going to add zero

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.430 
exponent I'm just going to add zero
control<00:02:49.060> enter<00:02:49.360> double<00:02:49.750> click<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.110> send<00:02:50.320> it

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
control enter double click and send it

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.460 
control enter double click and send it
down<00:02:50.550> now<00:02:51.550> that's<00:02:51.820> dynamic<00:02:52.209> right<00:02:52.750> so<00:02:53.260> if<00:02:53.350> I

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
down now that's dynamic right so if I

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.370 
down now that's dynamic right so if I
change<00:02:53.740> this<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.040> sixty<00:02:54.940> five<00:02:55.180> boom<00:02:56.020> that

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
change this to sixty five boom that

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.410 
change this to sixty five boom that
changes<00:02:56.920> so<00:02:57.220> that's<00:02:57.400> why<00:02:57.610> I<00:02:57.670> do<00:02:57.790> formula<00:02:58.270> if

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
changes so that's why I do formula if

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.990 
changes so that's why I do formula if
you<00:02:58.690> happen<00:02:59.320> to<00:02:59.470> do<00:02:59.650> this<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:00.190> you<00:03:00.640> wanted

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
you happen to do this and you wanted

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.390 
you happen to do this and you wanted
them<00:03:01.120> off<00:03:01.870> to<00:03:02.440> the<00:03:02.560> side<00:03:02.830> or<00:03:03.100> you<00:03:03.160> didn't

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
them off to the side or you didn't

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.100 
them off to the side or you didn't
remember<00:03:03.760> how<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> do<00:03:04.120> text<00:03:04.450> to<00:03:04.510> columns<00:03:04.690> and

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:05.110 
remember how to do text to columns and

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:06.840 
remember how to do text to columns and
you<00:03:05.800> didn't<00:03:06.040> want<00:03:06.220> the<00:03:06.310> phone<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.670> then<00:03:06.760> you

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
you didn't want the phone and then you

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.760 
you didn't want the phone and then you
have<00:03:07.000> to<00:03:07.120> copy<00:03:07.630> paste<00:03:08.050> special<00:03:08.560> values

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:08.770 
have to copy paste special values

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:11.850 
have to copy paste special values
there's<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.310> great<00:03:09.790> way<00:03:10.060> to<00:03:10.090> quickly<00:03:10.600> copy<00:03:11.470> some

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
there's a great way to quickly copy some

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:15.030 
there's a great way to quickly copy some
numbers<00:03:12.160> over<00:03:12.489> to<00:03:12.580> a<00:03:12.610> different<00:03:13.769> column<00:03:14.769> keep
