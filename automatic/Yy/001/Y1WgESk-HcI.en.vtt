telling the truth I think as humans we
have<00:02:42.290> this<00:02:42.410> ability<00:02:43.160> to<00:02:43.400> see<00:02:43.910> falsehood<00:02:44.810> and

truth and a lot of a lot of what's out
there<00:02:47.720> tries<00:02:47.959> to<00:02:48.110> mask<00:02:48.350> whether<00:02:49.190> it's<00:02:49.430> false

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:49.700 
there tries to mask whether it's false

there tries to mask whether it's false
or<00:02:49.880> true<00:02:49.910> but<00:02:50.269> I<00:02:50.299> think<00:02:50.660> it's<00:02:50.780> very<00:02:50.840> difficult

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:51.170 
or true but I think it's very difficult

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:53.400 
or true but I think it's very difficult
to<00:02:51.470> do<00:02:51.650> that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
to do that

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.560 
to do that
we<00:02:53.860> see<00:02:54.040> through<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.910> the<00:02:55.000> idea<00:02:55.060> was<00:02:55.270> to<00:02:55.360> tell<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:55.570 
we see through so the idea was to tell a

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.410 
we see through so the idea was to tell a
true<00:02:55.840> story<00:02:56.140> about<00:02:57.010> coming<00:02:57.400> of<00:02:57.490> age<00:02:57.670> that's

time<00:03:38.440> in<00:03:38.650> our<00:03:38.740> lives<00:03:38.890> where<00:03:39.220> we<00:03:39.250> have<00:03:39.520> to<00:03:40.110> take

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
time in our lives where we have to take

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.440 
time in our lives where we have to take
control<00:03:41.700> in<00:03:42.700> terms<00:03:42.760> of<00:03:42.970> the<00:03:43.060> writing<00:03:43.330> is<00:03:43.420> very

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450 
control in terms of the writing is very

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.990 
control in terms of the writing is very
different<00:03:43.660> in<00:03:44.140> that<00:03:44.290> it<00:03:44.800> rhymes<00:03:45.400> and<00:03:45.760> it's

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:46.000 
different in that it rhymes and it's

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.310 
different in that it rhymes and it's
rhyme<00:03:46.270> scheme<00:03:46.630> like<00:03:46.780> rime<00:03:47.110> of<00:03:47.140> the<00:03:47.230> ancient

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
rhyme scheme like rime of the ancient

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.150 
rhyme scheme like rime of the ancient
mariner<00:03:47.680> so<00:03:48.580> that's<00:03:48.930> for<00:03:49.930> line<00:03:50.110> stands<00:03:50.440> as<00:03:50.740> an

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.160 
mariner so that's for line stands as an

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.370 
mariner so that's for line stands as an
ABC<00:03:51.970> beware<00:03:52.330> the<00:03:52.420> second<00:03:52.750> line<00:03:52.900> rhymes<00:03:53.200> with

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:53.380 
ABC beware the second line rhymes with

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:55.500 
ABC beware the second line rhymes with
the<00:03:53.470> fourth<00:03:53.710> line<00:03:53.950> because<00:03:54.700> if<00:03:54.910> you<00:03:55.000> do<00:03:55.180> all

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:55.510 
the fourth line because if you do all

00:03:55.510 --> 00:03:57.060 
the fourth line because if you do all
couplets<00:03:56.140> it<00:03:56.350> ends<00:03:56.560> up<00:03:56.620> sounding<00:03:56.770> like<00:03:56.920> a

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
couplets it ends up sounding like a

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.250 
couplets it ends up sounding like a
children's<00:03:57.520> book<00:03:57.730> and<00:03:58.209> instead<00:03:58.930> if<00:03:59.020> you<00:03:59.110> look

00:03:59.250 --> 00:03:59.260 
children's book and instead if you look

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:00.540 
children's book and instead if you look
at<00:03:59.350> ryman<00:03:59.590> ancient<00:03:59.890> mariner<00:04:00.130> which<00:04:00.280> is<00:04:00.400> an
