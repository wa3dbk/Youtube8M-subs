00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.690 

I<00:00:02.899> think<00:00:03.899> both<00:00:04.740> robotic<00:00:05.520> and<00:00:05.670> human

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:05.700 
I think both robotic and human

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.670 
I think both robotic and human
exploration<00:00:06.600> has<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> lot<00:00:07.170> to<00:00:07.290> contribute<00:00:07.500> to

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
exploration has a lot to contribute to

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.650 
exploration has a lot to contribute to
solving<00:00:07.919> the<00:00:08.220> asteroid<00:00:08.639> hazard<00:00:09.240> to<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.510> earth

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
solving the asteroid hazard to the earth

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.110 
solving the asteroid hazard to the earth
so<00:00:10.349> robots<00:00:10.920> do<00:00:11.130> reconnaissance<00:00:11.429> they<00:00:11.940> bring

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
so robots do reconnaissance they bring

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.400 
so robots do reconnaissance they bring
back<00:00:12.150> samples<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.809> what<00:00:12.840> asteroids<00:00:13.290> are<00:00:13.380> made

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
back samples of what asteroids are made

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.039 
back samples of what asteroids are made
of<00:00:13.679> if<00:00:13.980> NASA<00:00:14.730> can<00:00:15.030> capture<00:00:15.240> an<00:00:15.450> asteroid<00:00:15.750> and

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
of if NASA can capture an asteroid and

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.349 
of if NASA can capture an asteroid and
give<00:00:16.230> it<00:00:16.260> give<00:00:17.010> access<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.490> astronauts<00:00:18.119> in<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
give it give access to astronauts in the

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.810 
give it give access to astronauts in the
next<00:00:18.600> ten<00:00:18.750> years<00:00:18.779> as<00:00:19.170> they've<00:00:19.830> proposed<00:00:20.220> then

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
next ten years as they've proposed then

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.070 
next ten years as they've proposed then
we'll<00:00:20.970> get<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> lot<00:00:21.300> of<00:00:21.449> important<00:00:21.810> civil

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
we'll get a lot of important civil

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.300 
we'll get a lot of important civil
engineering<00:00:22.500> information<00:00:22.769> from<00:00:23.160> the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
engineering information from the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.480 
engineering information from the
astronaut<00:00:23.900> explorations<00:00:24.900> of<00:00:24.990> that<00:00:25.050> object

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
astronaut explorations of that object

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.080 
astronaut explorations of that object
particularly<00:00:26.490> about<00:00:26.640> the<00:00:26.760> internal

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
particularly about the internal

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.060 
particularly about the internal
structure<00:00:27.449> of<00:00:27.480> the<00:00:27.689> body<00:00:27.869> and<00:00:28.080> how<00:00:28.560> one<00:00:28.769> is<00:00:28.890> put

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
structure of the body and how one is put

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.460 
structure of the body and how one is put
together<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.609> even<00:00:30.330> a<00:00:30.539> small<00:00:30.750> asteroid<00:00:31.109> could

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
together and even a small asteroid could

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.680 
together and even a small asteroid could
be<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.650> larger<00:00:32.130> component<00:00:32.610> of<00:00:32.940> some<00:00:33.239> big<00:00:33.390> rubble

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
be a larger component of some big rubble

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:34.940 
be a larger component of some big rubble
pile<00:00:33.899> that<00:00:34.140> could<00:00:34.260> threaten<00:00:34.380> earth<00:00:34.620> someday

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
pile that could threaten earth someday

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.979 
pile that could threaten earth someday
so<00:00:35.100> we'll<00:00:35.370> learn<00:00:35.489> some<00:00:35.760> very<00:00:35.940> good<00:00:36.120> planetary

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
so we'll learn some very good planetary

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.420 
so we'll learn some very good planetary
defense<00:00:37.260> information<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.950> I<00:00:37.980> think<00:00:38.219> when<00:00:38.340> it

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
defense information but I think when it

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.549 
defense information but I think when it
comes<00:00:38.610> to<00:00:38.730> actually<00:00:39.079> executing<00:00:40.079> a<00:00:40.140> deflection

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
comes to actually executing a deflection

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.200 
comes to actually executing a deflection
of<00:00:40.890> an<00:00:41.430> asteroid<00:00:41.640> that's<00:00:41.790> going<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.030> be<00:00:42.090> done

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
of an asteroid that's going to be done

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.830 
of an asteroid that's going to be done
robotically<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:43.140> you<00:00:43.469> might<00:00:43.620> send<00:00:43.860> a<00:00:43.950> whole

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:44.840 
robotically and you might send a whole

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.049 
robotically and you might send a whole
formation<00:00:45.840> of<00:00:46.230> spacecraft<00:00:46.710> all<00:00:47.280> robots<00:00:47.730> to

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
formation of spacecraft all robots to

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459 
formation of spacecraft all robots to
make<00:00:48.390> sure<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:48.989> job<00:00:49.170> gets<00:00:49.320> done

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
make sure that the job gets done

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.770 
make sure that the job gets done
properly<00:00:50.059> what<00:00:51.059> are<00:00:51.180> some<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.600> strategies

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
properly what are some of the strategies

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.770 
properly what are some of the strategies
from<00:00:52.199> harmless<00:00:52.530> deflection<00:00:53.489> well<00:00:54.300> there<00:00:54.629> are

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
from harmless deflection well there are

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.450 
from harmless deflection well there are
three<00:00:54.840> main<00:00:55.289> ones<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.829> most<00:00:56.010> elegant<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
three main ones the most elegant is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:57.799 
three main ones the most elegant is
probably<00:00:56.730> the<00:00:56.850> gravity<00:00:57.210> tractor<00:00:57.570> if<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> have

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
probably the gravity tractor if you have

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.479 
probably the gravity tractor if you have
a<00:00:57.870> small<00:00:58.140> asteroid<00:00:58.590> with<00:00:58.829> lots<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.190> warning

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
a small asteroid with lots of warning

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.459 
a small asteroid with lots of warning
time<00:00:59.699> you<00:01:00.210> can<00:01:00.359> park<00:01:00.629> next<00:01:00.780> to<00:01:00.930> an<00:01:01.050> asteroid

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
time you can park next to an asteroid

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.920 
time you can park next to an asteroid
and<00:01:01.680> the<00:01:01.980> mutual<00:01:02.309> gravitational<00:01:02.730> tug<00:01:03.210> will

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
and the mutual gravitational tug will

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.899 
and the mutual gravitational tug will
slowly<00:01:04.500> change<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.250> velocity<00:01:05.339> of<00:01:05.729> that

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:05.909 
slowly change the velocity of that

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:08.510 
slowly change the velocity of that
object<00:01:06.140> as<00:01:07.140> your<00:01:07.350> spacecraft<00:01:07.590> toes<00:01:08.220> it<00:01:08.400> with

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
object as your spacecraft toes it with

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.789 
object as your spacecraft toes it with
this<00:01:08.640> minuscule<00:01:09.150> amount<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:09.990> gravity<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.619> that

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
this minuscule amount of gravity so that

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:13.039 
this minuscule amount of gravity so that
you<00:01:11.460> can<00:01:11.640> make<00:01:12.240> it<00:01:12.360> miss<00:01:12.510> its<00:01:12.630> appointment

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
you can make it miss its appointment

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.830 
you can make it miss its appointment
with<00:01:13.140> earth<00:01:13.229> 10<00:01:13.740> or<00:01:13.860> 20<00:01:14.070> years<00:01:14.100> later<00:01:14.840> probably

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
with earth 10 or 20 years later probably

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.359 
with earth 10 or 20 years later probably
the<00:01:15.990> most<00:01:16.140> broadly<00:01:16.500> applicable<00:01:16.830> technique

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
the most broadly applicable technique

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.429 
the most broadly applicable technique
would<00:01:17.549> be<00:01:17.700> the<00:01:17.939> kinetic<00:01:18.180> impact<00:01:18.600> where<00:01:19.350> you

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
would be the kinetic impact where you

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.280 
would be the kinetic impact where you
fly<00:01:19.799> a<00:01:19.830> hypervelocity<00:01:20.369> spacecraft<00:01:21.330> into<00:01:21.630> the

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
fly a hypervelocity spacecraft into the

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.440 
fly a hypervelocity spacecraft into the
body<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.189> that<00:01:23.490> transfers<00:01:23.970> enough<00:01:24.180> momentum

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
body and that transfers enough momentum

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.080 
body and that transfers enough momentum
that<00:01:24.869> firing<00:01:25.409> a<00:01:25.470> bullet<00:01:25.590> into<00:01:25.979> it<00:01:26.009> changes<00:01:26.939> its

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
that firing a bullet into it changes its

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:28.700 
that firing a bullet into it changes its
velocity<00:01:27.299> so<00:01:27.630> that<00:01:27.689> this<00:01:27.960> is<00:01:28.140> its<00:01:28.290> appointment

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
velocity so that this is its appointment

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.710 
velocity so that this is its appointment
later<00:01:28.890> on<00:01:29.130> with<00:01:29.280> earth<00:01:29.400> and<00:01:29.640> if<00:01:30.390> you<00:01:30.540> have

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
later on with earth and if you have

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.020 
later on with earth and if you have
little<00:01:31.290> warning<00:01:31.680> time<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.189> a<00:01:32.610> very<00:01:32.790> large

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
little warning time and a very large

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.880 
little warning time and a very large
object<00:01:33.600> you<00:01:34.049> might<00:01:34.229> have<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> resort<00:01:34.710> to<00:01:34.860> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
object you might have to resort to a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.350 
object you might have to resort to a
nuclear<00:01:35.250> explosive<00:01:35.790> but<00:01:35.909> we<00:01:36.000> already<00:01:36.119> know

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
nuclear explosive but we already know

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.789 
nuclear explosive but we already know
that<00:01:36.570> that's<00:01:36.720> only<00:01:36.869> one<00:01:37.110> or<00:01:37.229> two<00:01:37.259> percent<00:01:37.710> of

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
that that's only one or two percent of

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.160 
that that's only one or two percent of
the<00:01:37.860> possible<00:01:38.430> impact<00:01:39.180> cases<00:01:39.659> we<00:01:39.780> might<00:01:39.960> see

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
the possible impact cases we might see

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.990 
the possible impact cases we might see
in<00:01:40.290> the<00:01:40.350> next<00:01:40.439> thousand<00:01:40.979> years<00:01:41.009> so<00:01:41.400> it's<00:01:41.880> not

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
in the next thousand years so it's not

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.670 
in the next thousand years so it's not
likely<00:01:42.180> we'd<00:01:42.390> have<00:01:42.509> to<00:01:42.600> use<00:01:42.750> that<00:01:42.930> another<00:01:43.530> new

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
likely we'd have to use that another new

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.859 
likely we'd have to use that another new
one<00:01:43.799> that's<00:01:43.950> just<00:01:44.159> been<00:01:44.670> mentioned<00:01:45.030> is<00:01:45.149> you

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
one that's just been mentioned is you

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:48.249 
one that's just been mentioned is you
can<00:01:46.020> take<00:01:46.229> a<00:01:46.259> solar<00:01:46.530> electric<00:01:47.000> rocket<00:01:48.000> motor

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
can take a solar electric rocket motor

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.440 
can take a solar electric rocket motor
an<00:01:49.259> ion<00:01:49.619> engine<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:50.189> your<00:01:50.759> spacecraft<00:01:51.030> can

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
an ion engine and your spacecraft can

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.380 
an ion engine and your spacecraft can
actually<00:01:51.780> direct<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.799> plume<00:01:53.100> of<00:01:53.250> exhaust<00:01:53.640> on

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
actually direct the plume of exhaust on

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.780 
actually direct the plume of exhaust on
to<00:01:54.689> the<00:01:54.780> asteroid<00:01:55.200> and<00:01:55.590> by<00:01:56.310> maintaining

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
to the asteroid and by maintaining

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
to the asteroid and by maintaining
formation<00:01:57.450> with<00:01:57.570> the<00:01:57.659> asteroid<00:01:58.049> including<00:01:58.680> it

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
formation with the asteroid including it

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.920 
formation with the asteroid including it
that's<00:01:59.490> actually<00:01:59.820> more<00:01:59.939> powerful<00:02:00.479> than<00:02:00.570> the

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
that's actually more powerful than the

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:03.020 
that's actually more powerful than the
gravity<00:02:01.290> tractor<00:02:01.680> might<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.310> so<00:02:02.850> you're

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
gravity tractor might be and so you're

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.240 
gravity tractor might be and so you're
harnessing<00:02:03.450> solar<00:02:03.659> energy<00:02:04.110> to<00:02:04.710> divert<00:02:05.130> the

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
harnessing solar energy to divert the

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.190 
harnessing solar energy to divert the
asteroid<00:02:05.640> and<00:02:05.939> that<00:02:06.180> could<00:02:06.360> be<00:02:06.390> an<00:02:06.810> effect

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
asteroid and that could be an effect

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.250 
asteroid and that could be an effect
you<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.649> should<00:02:07.920> be<00:02:08.009> explored
