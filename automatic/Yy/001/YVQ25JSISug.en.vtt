 the approaching butterfly effect requested that he sign the cork oak trees 

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:14.269
 it is an insect that also lives from the cork oaks and that flutters 

00:00:14.269 --> 00:00:16.279
 looking for your site 

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:19.659
 the female of this butterflies heavy and white and does not fly 

00:00:19.659 --> 00:00:23.609
 and the male is very light flying stop and striking antennae 

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:25.859
 are here 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.659
 the adults of a leaf-eating caterpillar 

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:32.719
 in the same rugged and miraculous trunk that so many human efforts with mouth 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.370
 they are starting the procession 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.340
 the butterfly come together in summer to make their posts and their bets 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.540
 millionaire 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.060
 each one of these females 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.030
 can get to put 500 eggs grouped 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:53.530
 in these plaxton is 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.530
 of yellowish color that will remain here several months 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.490
 but let's go back 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.740
 during the spring born these little urns that have passed the 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:15.710
 winter 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.950
 inside the homes 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.960
 safe from the cold 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.960
 your greatest enemy 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.860
 as they grow 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.520
 they have to move 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.750
 arrival health the treetops 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.750
 and nothing better for it than the headquarters of the factory its laptops 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.800
 millions of kilometers of city 

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.800
 that cover the mountain with a veil different from that of the spiders 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.280
 it's time to go on a field trip 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280
 to do climbing 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.140
 Cintra people 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.140
 anything goes in search of the juiciest buds 

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:16.089
 several weeks after birth 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:18.959
 we can call these caterpillars by name 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.519
 hairy lizards 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:24.319
 a plate with which the mediterranean mediterranean mount 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.319
 already counted when he was born millions of years ago

 the Valencian community 1 that in just a few hours 

00:02:48.059 --> 00:02:50.219
 we find that men fight 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:51.859
 but knowing that its wrong 

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.859
 it's newspaper and its spokesperson 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:59.269
 in fact some old people of the place 

00:02:59.269 --> 00:03:02.499
 they say that the lizards at least 

00:03:02.499 --> 00:03:04.629
 and that the cork oak attacked a year 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.629
 two the next year with more force 

00:03:23.229 --> 00:03:25.769
 your life cycle 

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.289
 yes samuel 

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:30.749

00:03:32.389 --> 00:03:34.519
 of caterpillar walking 

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:37.519
 there mobile chrysalis 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:40.319
 and from this one 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.699
 a butterfly in the middle of summer 

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:45.149
 in a complete and perfect process 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.149
 I want to last more than three weeks 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:55.449
 one more summer 

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:58.109
 the fertile newborn butterfly 

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.510
 will seek the primitive coruxo the deed for their offspring
