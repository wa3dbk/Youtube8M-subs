00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.750
 hello I am virginie dubois 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.099
 dietitian nutritionist and I 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.570
 wish to respond with you to the 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:12.300
 question what do sports do 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.769
 makes you lose weight doing sports or more 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.120
 generally do the activity 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.160
 physical when my encourage him to 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.050
 daily cycling walk or 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.000
 simply climbing stairs can 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:23.369
 contribute to weight loss 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.050
 indeed any weight loss will be 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.960
 do from the moment the quantity 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.119
 of calories burned is more important 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 that the amount of calories consumed 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.050
 so from the moment you move 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.510
 the more you do more activities 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.300
 more sports you increase the amount 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.670
 of calories burned and so you have 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.770
 more luck can lose weight but 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.450
 rather in the medium and long term 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.770
 the reasons why the loss of 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:49.379
 weight is not blatant with 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.760
 physical activity is firstly 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.410
 because when we do an activity 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.750
 physical I take the example of the 

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.449
 running the caloric expenditure is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.280
 not so important that it run 20 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:02.280
 minutes for example did lose 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.320
 practically 200 kcal it will be variable 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:07.439
 according to individuals but before where 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.189
 200 kcal which is not even a 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.710
 chocolate bread 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.930
 so obviously we'll have to do it already 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:15.630
 a lot of sport to burn a lot 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.670
 of calories and secondly roncal it 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.030
 there is a compensation effect of 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.670
 activity the loss of calories obtained 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.080
 by physical activity for example a 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.759
 compensation effect that is going to be 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.560
 conscious the person will eat a 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.970
 banana see a glass of fruit juice 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.320
 eat a cereal bar by this 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.570
 that she will do her physical intimacy 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.800
 or unconsciously with a 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.170
 more energy 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.180
 on their packages followed or on the meal 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.070
 who will follow the meal the next day because 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.500
 that his name was there a little bit 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.520
 increased so to the question make the 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:48.400
 sport does it lose weight 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.740
 the answer is yes yes but in 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:53.410
 general it will be seen rather on the average 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.240
 and the long run because the expense 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:57.550
 caloric is not high and because it 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.170
 will there be this compensation phenomenon for 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.080
 to achieve weight loss through activity 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.970
 physical it will have to parallel 

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.110
 manage to control its amount of 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.600
 calories consumed 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.830
 be aware, however, that even if the weight 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.350
 do not go down with physical activity 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:14.050
 it's the body composition that goes 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.000
 to change, we will see a loss of 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.520
 fat mass and and in parallel a 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.900
 increase in muscle mass which 

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:22.570
 wants to counter is still a 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:23.860
 refinement of the silhouette and hans to the 

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.760
 person who does sport will be able to 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.340
 to be satisfied 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.630
 does sport make you lose weight yes and 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:29.110
 you want to put all the chances of 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.150
 your side 

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:32.920
 precisely for this weight loss he 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.200
 is widely advised to follow a 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.940
 food program and in parallel to 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.170
 to do a physical activity in 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.880
 the interest of losing weight but 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.220
 especially in the interest of being able 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:44.820
 then stabilize the weight you 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.820
 will have obtained
