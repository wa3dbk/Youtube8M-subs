00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.719
 image volkswagen golf 7 first row impression so the karma 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.230
 in past and still driving roeland tameling figured out if that is possible 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.060
 it is often said that the current land is too much development 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.919
 group 5 

00:00:17.919 --> 00:00:21.359
 but for the current group that a successor ready one by the end of next year 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:23.739
 group 7 a completely new model 

00:00:23.739 --> 00:00:26.589
 count on the familiar t die and also 

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:30.449
 but that is also no longer in the pipeline because in that area and volkswagen another 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:31.910
 to make a considerable effort 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.530
 because that had a couple walking in that area just for the middle class 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:36.660
 volkswagen 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.220
 completely new platform for the new wave but he is not the first either 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:41.089
 is going to use 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:43.679
 because a few months before the new provincial states 

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:46.450
 and so the new audi a3 

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.500
 in 2008 against the fisker karma is already good to see but now we have continued first 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
 driven by car 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:55.210
 we have a number of lucky tents compared to ourselves 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.090
 he agrees on the technique to a small no car 9 a bit 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.070
 lost so they try prosecuted 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.560
 that's the concept 

00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.900
 at a lot of customers than I say on the porsche panamera mass that quattroporte 

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.140
 djelic zetes busy is just as big as a four-seater 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.030
 she then just a little conflict pet say that she points to 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.020
 picking up customers 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.750
 and that to a small this is very special but there you notice 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.080
 a lot of while driving that takes is completely different I already have a lot 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.600
 driven ex cars and also those open on era and that is the most similar 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.530
 it was also previously known that she offers a lot of torque 13 100 meters a system 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:30.510
 standstill besides of all that good there are boundaries and almost go 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.390
 that does stand still the disease that 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.050
 fifteen parts of that car gets going very well 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.830
 positive 4 one pk that is a lot but not very much in that segment 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.560
 the stops don't seem to expect much 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.009
 in flexibility it is just very big that they are electrically powered and then 

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:48.110
 get goosebumps 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.990
 equally, design does not arrange a second turbo block because of the engine the poets 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:55.420
 in a slum in the opel gt and the pontiac solstice and stuff 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:59.310
 afternoon posture is that your stomach goes if there is a system a first balance 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.200
 indicate sound that seit the biggest downside of japan 

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.320
 but sold in the Netherlands for example 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.909
 unbelievably already 115 have been sold there is messi never 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.209
 driven in that car says Sieneke Scholarship seen from the car brand what does not exist 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.090
 The brand you notice how important that is are the Fisker Tukkers Martin DB9 BMW 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.899
 z8 that man who can do something 

00:02:16.899 --> 00:02:20.229
 yes and then you see recall how that car connects with his sister's terminal 

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:23.089
 what used to with all those free side and all those people scooters 

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:26.089
 didn't think about it with band is that this is such a huge one 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.259
 huge numbers so large and so impressive 

00:02:29.259 --> 00:02:30.719
 yes it could be achieved 

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:32.950
 it is really something special that you can say yes 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:34.879
 also the number of deaths 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:38.140
 but of course you have had to miss this one for a while 

00:02:38.139 --> 00:02:40.879
 been out of the running due to a broken ankle so I could not 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:42.069
 driving 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.459
 but what if you yourself become disabled or disabled and you still want to stay 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:48.949
 we drive a car and of course we have to be able to use it 

00:02:48.949 --> 00:02:52.959
 has made a reputation for the well-being of the disabled fellow man 

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:56.789
 driving a car what should you do then which authorities can go to how
