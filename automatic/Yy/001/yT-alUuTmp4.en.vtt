00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.759
 who knows about the mysterious case of 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:09.269
 find in 1911 in a snow cave 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:11.910
 USA of mummies three meters high 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.730
 red hair were also found great 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.619
 quantity of objects such as sculptures 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.930
 be already and even lures to hunt 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.630
 ducks that are considered the most 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.789
 old found in the new world what 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:25.310
 more curious is that the scientists of the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.630
 epoch did not give importance 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.279
 even many of the remains were 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.189
 buried by the miners themselves 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.770
 locals were actually the Indians 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.440
 natives of the area the parties or peter 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.329
 that they knew about these beings 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.239
 they made their existence known through 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 of legends these Indians have reported 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.860
 that they themselves maintained very hard 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:49.079
 battles since time immemorial with 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.690
 some white giants that lived in that 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:54.449
 area the countries called this town 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:57.660
 yes teak and it was a warrior town almost 

00:00:54.449 --> 00:01:00.359
 impossible to defeat they also ensured 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:02.489
 that these giants were cannibals for 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.979
 this reason several tribes joined 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.659
 Indian to fight them 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 account that the war could last 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.119
 thousand years and during the battle the countries 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:15.000
 and his allies wiped out almost all 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.399
 the giants except a few that are 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.399
 they sheltered in a cave the cave of the 

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:22.770
 fast after surrounding them and surrounding them 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.590
 Indians piled thickets at the entrance 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 from the cave and set them on fire 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.399
 ended the life of the giants that 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.740
 they tried to leave the cave and those who 

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:36.000
 they remained inside they died asphyxiated 

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.829
 many centuries later in 1911 a 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.959
 company that collected the guano from the 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:42.479
 bats in the cave ended up finding 

00:01:39.959 --> 00:01:45.270
 utensils and human remains also 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.129
 broken arrows appeared that could 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.289
 have been fired from outside 

00:01:47.129 --> 00:01:51.090
 of the cave between the objects 

00:01:49.289 --> 00:01:55.079
 found there was a shaped stone 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.450
 of donut and he had 365 notches in the 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:02:00.959
 outside probably to indicate the 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:03.810
 days of the year and 52 inner notches the 

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:06.319
 weeks in some texts it is assured that 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.359
 these remains are more than 4000 years old 

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:11.700
 surprising no doubt another object that 

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:12.819
 highlights is a sling made of fabric 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.950
 vegetable 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:17.530
 he was next to a mummy of 6 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.439
 years has been dated around the year 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.870
 1200 22 before Christ- more data 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:24.819
 amazing after comparing the jaw 

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.219
 from one of those giants with that of a 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.780
 current adult it was found that the size 

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.879
 I was much older 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.980
 in fact the teeth of the supposed 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:35.469
 giant were almost twice the size that 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.389
 those of a man of today but not 

00:02:35.469 --> 00:02:41.169
 here the mysteries or the 

00:02:37.389 --> 00:02:43.719
 findings in 1931 two were found 

00:02:41.169 --> 00:02:46.750
 skeletons on the lake a bolt near 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:48.969
 he sees what one of them measured 250 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:52.989
 meters and the other three meters high 

00:02:48.969 --> 00:02:56.560
 in 1939 another skeleton appeared in a 

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:57.040
 next area although only 230 average 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.980
 meters 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:03.639
 sarah wynn and nape daughter of a boss part 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.349
 public in 1883 a book where he counted 

00:03:03.639 --> 00:03:08.169
 many more things from the tribe of 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.719
 giants that arrived by boat when that 

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:13.680
 area was part of an outer sea were 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:16.870
 about 2,600 of a different race 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.560
 they spoke a language also different and 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:19.560
 they kept
