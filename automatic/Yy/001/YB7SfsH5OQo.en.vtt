00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:10.620 
hi my name is Chris I'm with Laser sport

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.140 
hi my name is Chris I'm with Laser sport
I'd<00:00:10.860> like<00:00:11.099> to<00:00:11.250> talk<00:00:11.400> to<00:00:11.549> you<00:00:11.639> about<00:00:11.730> a<00:00:11.849> feature

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
I'd like to talk to you about a feature

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.449 
I'd like to talk to you about a feature
or<00:00:12.269> two<00:00:12.450> laser<00:00:12.690> helmets<00:00:13.139> that<00:00:13.260> is<00:00:13.379> unique<00:00:13.830> it's

00:00:14.449 --> 00:00:14.459 
or two laser helmets that is unique it's

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:16.400 
or two laser helmets that is unique it's
called<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.059> roll<00:00:15.599> sis<00:00:15.809> retention<00:00:16.290> mechanism

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
called the roll sis retention mechanism

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.290 
called the roll sis retention mechanism
so<00:00:16.919> let's<00:00:17.099> take<00:00:17.250> a<00:00:17.279> closer<00:00:17.550> look<00:00:17.790> at<00:00:17.939> roll<00:00:18.090> sis
