00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 nice all guys who orgasm the of 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.890
 food italia and I'm here with the release 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.889
 del team the week number 28 theme of the 

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.580
 week that was hardly just a little 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.560
 come out from the Iaea and there are several 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.570
 novelty surprises that we don't 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.650
 we were waiting and we're going to see 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.359
 together 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.970
 let's start immediately with the concierge 

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:26.779
 costs that we actually had 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:28.349
 expected with an overall 81 

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:31.730
 statistics 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:34.800
 we took it enough except I think 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:37.050
 however the first two diving endings however 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.670
 be a good goalkeeper who is added to 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.559
 those of the liga 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.320
 let's go with the door to the first defender 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.180
 of the bilbao that he played yesterday we do not 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.300
 we have taken into account the matches that 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:53.280
 they played last night because they were 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.710
 states or postponements or no excuses recoveries 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.469
 or midweek I thought 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.480
 we thought they didn't count instead they have 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.100
 counted the bilbao he played yesterday and 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.359
 which made 0 0 probably 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.100
 probably this player has 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.860
 disputed a great race and so it is 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.110
 released iv 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.420
 then we have a fazio that he doesn't 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:15.000
 we expected a little player 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.070
 interesting to the very slow truth 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.229
 with 

00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.490
 a good tonnage defense shot 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.010
 head to be reviewed 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:24.320
 we do not even let him 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:26.420
 that third and last defender of the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:31.150
 eleven initials it is July 

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:35.060
 andrea cocco is this braga here 

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.040
 he too was an ugly defender 47 of 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.619
 speed really these defenders that 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.040
 they really came out today 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.170
 unwatchable 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.660
 I don't understand why it didn't come out for 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.210
 example schertel how do you take 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.310
 stocks lucy a sif version we do not 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:51.110
 we know why he scored two goals and one 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.700
 assist tell me which defender in one 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.660
 game makes two goals and an assist 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:58.310
 I do not believe that nuno this idiot here and 

00:01:56.660 --> 00:02:00.649
 the other defenders have made one 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.470
 better discrete race but we omit 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.270
 then even a month had marked us 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.920
 He could aspire to be quieted we could 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.019
 stay even with the change of role 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.230
 because played a great game 

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:14.269
 against in the London derby but oh well 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.070
 let's go to the midfield where we find 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:17.959
 we had the aia tourÃ© yaya toure 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:19.519
 predicted they made three goals 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.370
 here we would miss something else, one of which 

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:23.360
 we have almost beautiful spaces 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.830
 He took 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.120
 we missed very little what we have 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:32.390
 wrong shot that raised it by 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:34.670
 one we were wrong even if not 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.650
 the dribbling that they raised is wrong 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.810
 even one of them and then also the 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.489
 header that we raised by 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.560
 their grandfather lowered by euros 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.709
 however, however we say it 

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.630
 almost got then we also eriksen it 

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:49.370
 we took the wrong role 

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:51.950
 we had not seen that he played it from 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.600
 left outside a player a lot 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:58.640
 interesting of which we have taken I believe 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.739
 everything except a header that 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.170
 increases by 1 from them however for the rest 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.390
 we got it all player that 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:08.090
 unfortunately as an outsider I don't know if it will come 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.670
 used a lot though maybe even 

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.769
 if it depends on whether it was 34 sex either 

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:14.810
 been koch cam would have been a lot 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.880
 better in my opinion we go with javi 

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:19.250
 fuego that we expected a little because he has 

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:20.989
 made two goals even if he didn't put it 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.090
 in prediction he put camacho that 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:24.889
 more or less they did the same thing a 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:26.329
 v fuego if I'm not mistaken he scored two goals 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:28.070
 but at home 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:28.840
 camacho I made two goals away from home in 

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:32.620
 transfer 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:35.640
 with the malaga and I think it deserved more 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:39.099
 we could try to care little 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:40.750
 cdc that I'm not even spending too many 

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:43.390
 words because I don't care but 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:45.760
 I don't think so either 

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:49.599
 let's go with bonaventure after having 

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:51.670
 brought the atanta to victory also 

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:55.510
 he expected against inter 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:57.549
 we got it right speed attracting 

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.790
 pass instead we made a mistake of a 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:02.670
 dribbling of impure books instead of defense 

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:05.019
 and shot not defense we got it right 

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:08.049
 header instead raised a 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.849
 interesting player for the series a 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.000
 we must also see how much it will be worth not 

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:14.650
 I think we have oscar too 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:16.209
 we were all waiting for Oscar because he did 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:19.889
 one more double played one 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:24.130
 splendid match against arsenal with 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.020
 84 of 70 shooting pacers against the 80 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:28.030
 which provided for new passage e 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.300
 dribbling we got it right defense va 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.699
 Well 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:32.460
 it does not matter and header as well 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:36.100
 great excellent player 

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:41.050
 then we suarez after the triplet with 

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:44.700
 his liverpool 85 speed is a team 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.660
 swan version cheering 85 speed 94 shooting 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:49.599
 pass instead increases by 1 respect 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.789
 to our dribbling prediction instead 

00:04:49.599 --> 00:04:53.650
 remains the same defense as well as a header 

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:56.740
 decreases by one huge player 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:59.260
 which really will cost a lot then 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.360
 we have iniesta that many had it 

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:05.200
 predicted as a player 

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:08.229
 we had focused more on rooney 

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.180
 because after that goal from the 58-yard chip 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:12.700
 that he had done I think he deserves 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:15.370
 iniesta personam and that is sincerely not 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.580
 I know what he did in the memory though 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.630
 the don andreas cannot fail to give an iv 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.850
 here then we have a porter sippel that 

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:26.770
 okay 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:28.780
 a poor or poor positioning 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.490
 just the rest seems to me a discreet 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:30.880
 goalkeeper but I do not care more than 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.320
 much 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:38.560
 oh well, who cares gacp and madonna is there 

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.690
 the purple head I'm playing this 

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.330
 instead he is a player indeed 

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:47.530
 interesting with 87 of speed 74 i 

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:48.820
 first 74 of shot 70 of header 70 

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:51.160
 of educator steps to try 

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:53.710
 I certainly don't know what he did for 

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:56.860
 get the iv version I don't know how much 

00:05:53.710 --> 00:05:59.230
 but it will cost us then we have bryson 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.690
 that we had predicted even though we 

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:05.260
 we had put it as their cam as cc 

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:08.170
 with 75 speed 77 shooting plus 3 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:10.300
 compared to our version 72 of 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.120
 passage 72 of civilians we took 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:15.730
 then the defense had 70 66 header 

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:18.220
 that we took the player too 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.160
 interesting is certainly better as c 

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:24.030
 or oc with respect to cm, then we have good 

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:28.000
 ciro immobile after the triplet with 

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.160
 been passed to 77 from 75 we had 

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:33.670
 predicted however a more or less 78 

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.710
 we are there good speed 78 of shooting 

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:37.960
 so interesting 81 header 

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.000
 there is a player to definitely try 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.480
 even if he is a priest in shoes 

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.850
 rais 

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:44.650
 then we have elton who personally do not 

00:06:42.850 --> 00:06:46.150
 I'm interested in a cabbage speed e 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.090
 then I don't know what he did then 

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:52.630
 we omit then we have ares that have 

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:56.560
 put as a striker but I tip 

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:58.270
 looking at the formations of his club the 

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:59.830
 alive because he played as an outsider 

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:02.860
 right so I don't know why they have it 

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:04.930
 put as an attacker but it is still valid 

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.610
 a truly phenomenal player there 

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:09.250
 version makes me really strong there 

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.560
 iv version will also be devastating 82 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.390
 of speed 81 of shot 80 of shot of 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:15.640
 also test to pass a good one 

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:17.290
 dribbling I really consider it a 

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.690
 very interesting player and approve 

00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:23.260
 surely, however, prediction is 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.720
 been this one I hope it was from 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:29.020
 help be enjoyed 

00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:30.760
 if you write in the comments what is there 

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:33.070
 perhaps you expected from this prediction 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.650
 I personally expected schertel 

00:07:33.070 --> 00:07:38.290
 honestly, however, it has not come out e 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.240
 nothing so put a nice like it 

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:43.650
 subscribe to the channel we'll see you at 

00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:43.650
