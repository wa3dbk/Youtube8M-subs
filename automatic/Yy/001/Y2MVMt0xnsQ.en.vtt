00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
putting on at least cold-blooded or
scavenger<00:01:27.450> one<00:01:27.900> of<00:01:28.020> these<00:01:28.140> two<00:01:28.350> is<00:01:28.470> the<00:01:28.619> best

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
scavenger one of these two is the best

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
scavenger one of these two is the best
to<00:01:28.979> put<00:01:29.130> on<00:01:29.280> but<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.700> definitely<00:01:30.060> would<00:01:30.689> not<00:01:30.810> go

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
to put on but I definitely would not go

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.830 
to put on but I definitely would not go
at<00:01:31.140> scavenger<00:01:31.790> unless<00:01:32.790> you're<00:01:33.090> like<00:01:33.299> really

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
at scavenger unless you're like really

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.539 
at scavenger unless you're like really
firing<00:01:34.229> off<00:01:34.470> bullets<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.040> put<00:01:35.189> into<00:01:35.340> like

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
firing off bullets if you put into like

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.100 
firing off bullets if you put into like
a<00:01:35.579> full<00:01:35.880> auto<00:01:36.090> mode<00:01:36.240> if<00:01:36.540> you're<00:01:36.689> kind<00:01:37.049> of

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
a full auto mode if you're kind of

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.870 
a full auto mode if you're kind of
switching<00:01:37.409> up<00:01:37.500> my<00:01:37.530> class<00:01:37.860> a<00:01:37.890> bit<00:01:38.040> other<00:01:38.670> than

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
switching up my class a bit other than

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.300 
switching up my class a bit other than
that<00:01:39.000> put<00:01:39.299> it<00:01:39.390> on<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.770> toughness<00:01:40.770> or<00:01:41.100> cool

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
that put it on a toughness or cool

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.940 
that put it on a toughness or cool
blooded<00:01:41.700> if<00:01:41.880> you<00:01:42.090> just<00:01:42.899> are<00:01:43.229> trying<00:01:43.590> to<00:01:43.680> decide

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
blooded if you just are trying to decide

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.499 
blooded if you just are trying to decide
between<00:01:43.979> the<00:01:44.310> 2<00:01:44.460> i'd<00:01:44.640> put<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:44.970> toughness

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
between the 2 i'd put on toughness

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.090 
between the 2 i'd put on toughness
actually<00:01:45.990> so<00:01:46.530> I<00:01:46.560> don't<00:01:46.680> even<00:01:46.799> know<00:01:46.950> what<00:01:47.040> I'm

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
actually so I don't even know what I'm

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.380 
actually so I don't even know what I'm
trying<00:01:47.310> to<00:01:47.430> tell<00:01:47.579> myself<00:01:47.729> right<00:01:48.060> now<00:01:48.090> but

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
trying to tell myself right now but

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.450 
trying to tell myself right now but
definitely<00:01:48.780> put<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:48.990> top<00:01:49.229> of<00:01:49.320> this<00:01:49.409> and<00:01:49.649> then

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
definitely put on top of this and then

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.969 
definitely put on top of this and then
for<00:01:51.450> your<00:01:51.600> third<00:01:51.930> perk<00:01:52.259> you're<00:01:52.500> not<00:01:52.649> gonna

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:52.979 
for your third perk you're not gonna

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:54.649 
for your third perk you're not gonna
really<00:01:53.280> need<00:01:53.490> dexterity<00:01:54.149> because<00:01:54.450> you're

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
really need dexterity because you're

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.719 
really need dexterity because you're
going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.840> be<00:01:54.899> swift<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.380> your<00:01:55.530> feet<00:01:55.680> anyway<00:01:56.040> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
going to be swift on your feet anyway so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.100 
going to be swift on your feet anyway so
I<00:01:56.759> definitely<00:01:57.000> recommend<00:01:57.390> putting<00:01:57.899> on

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
I definitely recommend putting on

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.649 
I definitely recommend putting on
anything<00:01:58.439> else<00:01:58.710> other<00:01:59.009> than<00:01:59.360> dexterity<00:02:00.360> so

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
anything else other than dexterity so

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:04.190 
anything else other than dexterity so
tactile<00:02:01.560> mask<00:02:01.799> is<00:02:02.040> great<00:02:02.369> for<00:02:02.790> flash<00:02:03.659> bangs<00:02:03.990> so

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
tactile mask is great for flash bangs so

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.080 
tactile mask is great for flash bangs so
you<00:02:04.290> don't<00:02:04.439> get<00:02:04.530> like<00:02:04.890> shocked<00:02:05.280> as<00:02:05.520> much<00:02:05.700> and

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you don't get like shocked as much and

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.789 
you don't get like shocked as much and
also<00:02:06.240> shocked<00:02:06.630> charges<00:02:07.110> it<00:02:07.229> reduces<00:02:07.619> them

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
also shocked charges it reduces them

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.529 
also shocked charges it reduces them
when<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.039> run<00:02:08.220> through<00:02:08.369> room<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.209> it<00:02:09.300> kind<00:02:09.509> of

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
when you run through room so it kind of

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.729 
when you run through room so it kind of
depends<00:02:09.810> on<00:02:09.899> what<00:02:10.050> map<00:02:10.229> you<00:02:10.410> think<00:02:10.590> are<00:02:10.679> you

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
depends on what map you think are you

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.710 
depends on what map you think are you
playing<00:02:11.129> on<00:02:11.280> what<00:02:11.459> the<00:02:11.580> other<00:02:11.730> enemy<00:02:12.390> teams<00:02:12.569> in

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:12.720 
playing on what the other enemy teams in

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:13.550 
playing on what the other enemy teams in
immune

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
immune

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.660 
immune
I'm<00:02:13.739> just<00:02:13.950> going<00:02:14.069> to<00:02:14.130> put<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.340> extreme

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:14.670 
I'm just going to put on extreme

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:16.400 
I'm just going to put on extreme
conditioning<00:02:15.120> because<00:02:15.209> extreme<00:02:15.959> connections

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:16.410 
conditioning because extreme connections

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:17.960 
conditioning because extreme connections
makes<00:02:16.650> me<00:02:16.770> like<00:02:16.920> run<00:02:17.160> super<00:02:17.340> fast<00:02:17.459> they<00:02:17.819> feel

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
makes me like run super fast they feel

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.300

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
around the air so that kind of stops you

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.880 
around the air so that kind of stops you
from<00:02:48.239> dying<00:02:48.870> a<00:02:49.110> bit<00:02:49.260> more<00:02:49.530> when<00:02:49.799> you're

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
from dying a bit more when you're

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:51.620 
from dying a bit more when you're
outside<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.310> you're<00:02:50.610> running<00:02:51.030> around<00:02:51.450> like<00:02:51.569> a

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
outside and you're running around like a
