00:05:18.779 --> 00:05:18.789 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.070 

it<00:05:19.789> was<00:05:19.969> a<00:05:20.139> DSP<00:05:21.139> prototype<00:05:21.830> they<00:05:22.009> were<00:05:23.080> gonna

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:24.080 
it was a DSP prototype they were gonna

00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.700 
it was a DSP prototype they were gonna
release<00:05:24.409> this<00:05:24.590> model<00:05:25.069> Ltd<00:05:25.639> MTX

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710

by<00:05:27.710> DSP<00:05:28.599> and<00:05:29.599> this<00:05:29.780> was<00:05:30.020> the<00:05:30.199> one<00:05:30.319> that<00:05:30.500> would

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:30.590 
by DSP and this was the one that would

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:32.939 
by DSP and this was the one that would
have<00:05:30.710> been<00:05:30.800> sent<00:05:31.069> out<00:05:31.189> to<00:05:31.250> guitar<00:05:31.699> shows<00:05:31.939> too

so dealers could get a preview of the

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.809 
so dealers could get a preview of the
next<00:05:36.319> year's<00:05:36.560> model<00:05:36.949> but<00:05:37.129> for<00:05:37.639> whatever

00:05:39.909 --> 00:05:39.919 
reason he SP at the last minute scrapped

00:05:39.919 --> 00:05:42.520 
reason he SP at the last minute scrapped
the<00:05:40.039> project<00:05:40.069> and<00:05:40.699> so<00:05:40.939> they<00:05:41.060> only<00:05:41.210> had<00:05:41.530> however

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:42.530 
the project and so they only had however

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.640 
the project and so they only had however
many<00:05:42.710> prototypes<00:05:42.949> who<00:05:43.400> would<00:05:43.520> have<00:05:43.610> made<00:05:43.789> and

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:44.650 
many prototypes who would have made and

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:47.939 
many prototypes who would have made and
this<00:05:45.650> is<00:05:45.949> one<00:05:46.219> of<00:05:46.250> those<00:05:46.490> prototypes<00:05:46.849> guys

00:05:47.939 --> 00:05:47.949 
this is one of those prototypes guys

00:05:47.949 --> 00:05:51.390
