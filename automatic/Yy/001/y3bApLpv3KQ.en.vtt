00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
you can make a pattern out of it by

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.120

most I used it a great deal but other

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.750 
most I used it a great deal but other
composers<00:01:01.559> have<00:01:01.770> as<00:01:01.949> well<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.340> example<00:01:02.670> if

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
composers have as well for example if

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.810

song<00:01:42.979> you<00:01:43.130> might<00:01:43.340> use<00:01:43.789> it<00:01:43.940> on<00:01:44.090> is<00:01:44.270> like<00:01:44.649> angels

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
song you might use it on is like angels

00:01:45.649 --> 00:02:01.809 
song you might use it on is like angels
we<00:01:45.800> have<00:01:45.830> heard<00:01:45.950> on<00:01:46.130> high<00:02:00.369> now<00:02:01.369> it's<00:02:01.520> best<00:02:01.729> to

00:02:01.809 --> 00:02:01.819 
we have heard on high now it's best to

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:03.190 
we have heard on high now it's best to
use<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.119> in<00:02:02.209> combination<00:02:02.450> with<00:02:02.869> something

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:03.200 
use it in combination with something

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.600 
use it in combination with something
else<00:02:03.319> cuz<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.709> gets<00:02:03.860> kind<00:02:04.069> of<00:02:04.100> boring<00:02:04.159> if<00:02:04.520> you

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:04.610 
else cuz it gets kind of boring if you

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.309 
else cuz it gets kind of boring if you
do<00:02:04.729> it<00:02:04.850> over<00:02:04.909> again<00:02:05.060> so<00:02:05.720> if<00:02:05.929> I<00:02:06.020> was<00:02:06.140> playing

00:02:06.309 --> 00:02:06.319 
do it over again so if I was playing

00:02:06.319 --> 00:02:07.990 
do it over again so if I was playing
that<00:02:06.440> I<00:02:06.560> might<00:02:06.799> do<00:02:07.159> that<00:02:07.190> first<00:02:07.549> section<00:02:07.759> like

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.000 
that I might do that first section like

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:16.900 
that I might do that first section like
that<00:02:08.209> and<00:02:08.450> then

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.190 

in<00:02:17.910> other<00:02:18.090> words<00:02:18.300> combining<00:02:18.780> with<00:02:18.870> the<00:02:18.900> bigger

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
in other words combining with the bigger

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:33.930 
in other words combining with the bigger
sound

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:38.589 

then<00:02:34.940> you<00:02:35.030> might<00:02:35.209> fade<00:02:35.480> up<00:02:37.090> kind<00:02:38.090> of<00:02:38.150> like<00:02:38.330> that

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
then you might fade up kind of like that

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.930 
then you might fade up kind of like that
okay<00:02:39.410> it's<00:02:39.620> called<00:02:39.769> the<00:02:39.920> Alberti<00:02:40.400> bass<00:02:40.610> and

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940
