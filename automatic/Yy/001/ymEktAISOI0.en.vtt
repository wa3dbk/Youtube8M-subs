got 124 votes whereas the g3 got 102 and
I<00:00:36.480> think<00:00:36.840> without<00:00:37.290> actually<00:00:37.710> looking<00:00:37.800> about

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190

I think without actually looking about
any<00:00:38.340> numbers<00:00:38.700> I'm<00:00:38.820> pretty<00:00:39.059> sure<00:00:39.300> it's<00:00:39.480> the

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
any numbers I'm pretty sure it's the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.200 
any numbers I'm pretty sure it's the
first<00:00:39.840> time<00:00:40.140> any<00:00:40.410> device<00:00:40.800> except<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.460> HTC<00:00:42.030> One

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
first time any device except the HTC One

first time any device except the HTC One
m8<00:00:42.480> has<00:00:42.750> got<00:00:43.050> over<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.530> hundred<00:00:43.620> votes<00:00:44.190> so<00:00:44.460> the

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
m8 has got over a hundred votes so the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.209

about the g3 and that's its performance

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.380 
about the g3 and that's its performance
for<00:01:01.500> whatever<00:01:01.800> reason<00:01:02.370> whenever<00:01:02.609> you<00:01:02.940> open<00:01:03.239> an

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
for whatever reason whenever you open an

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:04.939 
for whatever reason whenever you open an
app<00:01:03.539> were<00:01:03.750> using<00:01:04.140> that<00:01:04.229> for<00:01:04.439> an<00:01:04.500> extended

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
app were using that for an extended

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.800 
app were using that for an extended
period<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.400> time<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.850> seems<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.210> kick<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:06.630> home

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
period of time it seems to kick the home

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.899 
period of time it seems to kick the home
screen<00:01:07.200> launcher<00:01:07.229> out<00:01:07.799> of<00:01:08.010> the<00:01:08.159> recent<00:01:08.580> memory

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
screen launcher out of the recent memory

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:10.429 
screen launcher out of the recent memory
and<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.360> when<00:01:09.540> you<00:01:09.659> go<00:01:09.810> back<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.260> home

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
and so when you go back to the home

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:12.020 
and so when you go back to the home
screen<00:01:10.470> it<00:01:10.920> takes<00:01:11.130> a<00:01:11.250> little<00:01:11.400> while<00:01:11.670> to<00:01:11.909> load

different things even us experts we

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.240 
different things even us experts we
don't<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:39.050> think<00:02:39.080> the<00:02:39.500> same<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:40.070> that's

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
don't all think the same and that's

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.250

fingerprint<00:02:49.459> sensors<00:02:49.880> that's<00:02:50.060> another<00:02:50.330> thing

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
fingerprint sensors that's another thing

that's a good topic of discussion so far

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.729 
that's a good topic of discussion so far
in<00:02:53.090> my<00:02:53.270> opinion<00:02:53.600> the<00:02:53.720> only<00:02:53.870> company<00:02:54.530> that's

00:02:54.729 --> 00:02:54.739 
in my opinion the only company that's

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:56.410 
in my opinion the only company that's
got<00:02:54.890> the<00:02:55.040> fingerprint<00:02:55.520> sensor<00:02:55.910> right<00:02:56.150> is

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
got the fingerprint sensor right is

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.840 
got the fingerprint sensor right is
Apple<00:02:56.930> because<00:02:57.650> they<00:02:57.770> put<00:02:57.980> it<00:02:58.100> into<00:02:58.400> a<00:02:58.430> button

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:58.850 
Apple because they put it into a button

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:00.190 
Apple because they put it into a button
that<00:02:58.880> you're<00:02:59.150> going<00:02:59.360> to<00:02:59.420> use<00:02:59.480> all<00:02:59.840> the<00:02:59.989> time

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
that you're going to use all the time

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.800 
that you're going to use all the time
anyway<00:03:00.650> and<00:03:01.070> it's<00:03:01.310> really<00:03:01.670> hard<00:03:01.910> to<00:03:02.090> avoid<00:03:02.420> and

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
anyway and it's really hard to avoid and

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.380 
anyway and it's really hard to avoid and
it<00:03:03.200> adds<00:03:03.380> a<00:03:03.620> really<00:03:03.830> easy<00:03:04.190> level<00:03:04.820> of<00:03:05.000> security

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:05.390 
it adds a really easy level of security

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.660 
it adds a really easy level of security
to<00:03:05.870> your<00:03:06.020> phone<00:03:06.290> so<00:03:06.770> no<00:03:06.920> one<00:03:07.070> else<00:03:07.190> can<00:03:07.459> get
