00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.049
 yes we dutch are of course one 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.120
 people of bridge builders have but that 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.859
 does not always prove well the many 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.330
 emails that we are at cannabis ware 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:12.360
 get in 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:14.969
 best la graduates but three immediately 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.789
 All bridge complainants at once 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.750
 that are built but not 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.789
 used 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.990
 Well take purmerend was there a 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.910
 bridge come 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.460
 since October in purmerend have a 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.849
 bridge that connects two neighborhoods the center 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.489
 shared with their suburbs and the high 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:34.320
 so 12 meters high so a walkway and 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.190
 the lower part that his bike 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.440
 back 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.079
 the intention is that fishermen are wheelchair users 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
 and prams go underneath and 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 pedestrians then along the top 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:49.379
 well if you agree that clear anyway 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:52.170
 yes yes yes no I don't no indeed 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.430
 nobody goes over that footbridge 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.620
 why not it is one anyway 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.620
 beautiful burg 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.480
 I want this life why because it is under 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.370
 man's easy friend the low part 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.180
 was absolutely necessary to the neighborhoods 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:08.189
 but the bow is a shame 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.280
 and high pedestrian bridge that nobody 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.960
 used and that cost it 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.789
 the bridge has a total of eight million 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:17.640
 cost 

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.500
 value of 1.2 million for that walkway 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.270
 which is therefore not used 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 but we are not there yet 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 Noord-Holland is the place your koedijk 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.759
 You know that's where that picture is 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.009
 are vlotbrug 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:31.110
 What are the bridge to flop again 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:33.929
 are traditionally built 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:36.929
 wooden bridges very beautiful to see now 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.090
 lie since time immemorial and they 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:39.899
 meet excellent and float bridge exists 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.359
 from two 

00:01:39.899 --> 00:01:43.200
 floating pontoons that are in the quays 

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.689
 to scroll 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 as soon as a ship arrives you are koedijk 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:49.349
 unknown so it is logical that there is again 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.939
 a raft bridge was chosen 

00:01:49.349 --> 00:01:53.759
 then a little further on a new one 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.000
 connection had to come in 2012 is the 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.329
 bridge opened in June 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.530
 yes it is now 2013 and nobody can go there anymore 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.110
 across 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.610
 no because he is not safe the makers 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.610
 of the new raft bridge 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.079
 have changed one thing about it 200 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.390
 year old design 

00:02:10.079 --> 00:02:15.000
 The pontoons are now plastic 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.890
 the bridge is currently experiencing 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.850
 that when closing the 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:23.040
 pontoons that then the upper deck through it 

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:24.030
 Under Actal teeth wheels of it 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.980
 above deck 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.720
 literally sag through the lower deck 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.090
 is strong enough 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.920
 since June last year, the calculation 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:35.099
 float bridge now closed 

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:37.319
 the bridge worked exactly 11 days 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:40.480
 it is a raft bridge but we call it 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:43.959
 here the not too smooth bridge 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.909
 we understand why yes the first raft bridge 

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:48.519
 from 1821 

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:51.069
 those costs, once converted to 45 hundred 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.769
 euros and how much did the new one cost 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:56.769
 improved raft bridge two the nickname of 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:58.209
 This bridge is the bridge of 8 million but 

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:01.180
 well then you still have beautiful 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.489
 Had 11 days of pleasure ahead of it 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:06.099
 one to ruurlo 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.560
 a footbridge had to be built there because the 

00:03:06.099 --> 00:03:10.120
 region Achterhoek a bridge over the railway 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:11.140
 wanted associated with extra 

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.760
 parking lots 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.160
 so that people are also across the street from the 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.900
 could park the bridge and there as the 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.560
 region Achterhoek a lot of money for it 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.329
 about 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:21.489
 in fact there was even money 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:22.390
 available to the entire station area 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:24.790
 refurbish 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:26.950
 there are 30 parking spaces in total 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.900
 added across 

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.129
 but there are 18 on the front 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.109
 taken away 

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:34.060
 So he effectively there are twelve times 

00:03:32.109 --> 00:03:37.209
 places added 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.819
 12 extra parking spaces and a nice one 

00:03:37.209 --> 00:03:42.010
 new bridge to get there 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:45.190
 but how many cars are there now on that 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.049
 new parking area on average 3 to 4 and 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.739
 as you can see there are now even more 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.569
 tring 

00:03:47.739 --> 00:03:51.190
 that's you ever I didn't get it and 

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:53.349
 ask the questions in the odorless 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.870
 city ​​council and I was told that 

00:03:53.349 --> 00:03:57.639
 the money for the refurbishment alone would 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:00.130
 be issued if there is also one 

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:01.510
 in other words, walkway did not come 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.120
 subsidy 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:05.349
 if no bridge had come and is 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.910
 ruurlo station 

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:10.019
 a new bicycle parking a beautiful one 

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.680
 waiting area but also a walkway for 2 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.130
 motorists 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.910
 costs only for the 750,000 walkway 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.579
 euros 

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:22.180
 well so just recapitulate a bridge 

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:24.940
 for 2 motorists 750,000 euros and 

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:29.020
 do not use the 1.2 million walkway 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:33.000
 and a floating bridge of 8 million together 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.000
 9 million 950,000 euros
