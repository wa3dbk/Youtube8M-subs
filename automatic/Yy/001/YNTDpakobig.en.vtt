00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.620
 according to our traditionally understand and not 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.420
 domestic products only 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.750
 producers well, apparently out of habit 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.839
 and from the closest neighbors in the cis therefore on 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.529
 on the shelves we have Azerbaijani tomatoes 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:21.570
 grapes uzbek cucumbers 

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:23.820
 near Moscow but sometimes under the counters 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.439
 just grow barricades and in boxes on 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.840
 which is written turkey 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.300
 spain greece from where party often 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
 The result is the most plastic vegetables and 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.899
 fruits 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.219
 so see what you take unnecessarily 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:40.920
 glossy shine or sticky surface 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.050
 will issue a processed product which 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:45.690
 prepared for a long journey and 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:48.030
 long-term storage now with regard to 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:51.360
 new crop new alas it sometimes 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.090
 well disguised old and young 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:56.129
 potatoes can be imported scoured and 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.329
 apples to lie winter 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.059
 again attention to the product cucumber even 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.640
 if it is paraffin-treated it spoils 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:09.270
 there will be a stem, so this part 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:13.439
 Feel if it's a soft cucumber 

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.990
 stale well and fresh tomatoes on a branch 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.020
 only the sheet is often elastic and not 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.420
 dried and well with young potatoes think 

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.860
 also all more or less clear from her 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.920
 how thin the skin 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:31.350
 that it is literally taken off like a fingernail 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.100
 another problem is nitrates and other 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.759
 chemicals 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:37.920
 right there cucumber if it is processed by chemistry then 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.180
 cipher he will be literally the same 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.150
 prickly like a rose 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:44.759
 after all, just with your finger, these spines are not 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:46.380
 you have gathered with respect to tomatoes 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.530
 should alert you 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:52.049
 overly dense skin which damage 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.600
 can be well, except that a knife that's when you 

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:55.799
 will cut nitrate tomatoes will be such 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.119
 unaccustomed 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.070
 orange flesh with light streaks 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:03.390
 hydrated cabbage was reflected 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.730
 specific mold and it is covered 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.820
 such dark spots 

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:11.640
 but again, there are potatoes here 

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.920
 a simple test needs to be poked slightly 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.780
 the potatoes you feel which 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.970
 characteristic crunch it means that 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:21.240
 good potatoes and if the nail goes like 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.360
 On butter potatoes do not take lucky you 

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.360
 shopping
