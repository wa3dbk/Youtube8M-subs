00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840 

this<00:00:00.690> exercise<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.469> to<00:00:01.680> work<00:00:02.399> on<00:00:02.580> the

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:02.850 
this exercise is to work on the

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:05.240 
this exercise is to work on the
popliteus<00:00:03.389> muscle<00:00:03.480> now<00:00:04.200> popliteus<00:00:04.710> is<00:00:05.040> or

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
popliteus muscle now popliteus is or

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:06.829 
popliteus muscle now popliteus is or
popliteus<00:00:05.700> depending<00:00:06.210> on<00:00:06.299> what<00:00:06.480> continent

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839 
popliteus depending on what continent

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:09.290 
popliteus depending on what continent
you<00:00:06.990> live<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.610> popliteus<00:00:08.610> is<00:00:08.880> a<00:00:08.910> muscle<00:00:09.269> that

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:09.300 
you live on popliteus is a muscle that

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.870 
you live on popliteus is a muscle that
is<00:00:09.480> inherently<00:00:10.550> important<00:00:11.550> when<00:00:11.730> we're

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
is inherently important when we're

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.150 
is inherently important when we're
talking<00:00:12.330> about<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.900> rotational<00:00:13.590> control<00:00:13.980> of

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
talking about the rotational control of

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:14.930 
talking about the rotational control of
the<00:00:14.280> knee

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940 
the knee

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.269 
the knee
runners<00:00:15.660> often<00:00:16.139> if<00:00:16.470> they've<00:00:16.650> got<00:00:16.859> weakness

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
runners often if they've got weakness

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.680 
runners often if they've got weakness
through<00:00:17.490> those<00:00:17.609> popliteus<00:00:18.119> get<00:00:18.359> a<00:00:18.390> lot<00:00:18.539> of

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
through those popliteus get a lot of

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.540 
through those popliteus get a lot of
cartilage<00:00:18.990> pain<00:00:19.350> but<00:00:19.920> it's<00:00:20.039> important<00:00:20.460> for

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
cartilage pain but it's important for

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.880 
cartilage pain but it's important for
cyclists<00:00:21.029> as<00:00:21.119> well<00:00:21.359> because<00:00:22.289> when<00:00:22.680> we're

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:22.890 
cyclists as well because when we're

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.009 
cyclists as well because when we're
talking<00:00:22.920> about<00:00:23.369> the<00:00:24.029> reduction<00:00:24.539> of<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> cue

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
talking about the reduction of the cue

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.810 
talking about the reduction of the cue
angle<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.529> making<00:00:25.859> sure<00:00:26.039> that<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> kneecap

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
angle and making sure that the kneecap

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.359 
angle and making sure that the kneecap
is<00:00:27.029> tracking<00:00:27.510> straight<00:00:27.869> a<00:00:28.140> big<00:00:28.710> element<00:00:29.279> of

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
is tracking straight a big element of

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:31.669 
is tracking straight a big element of
that<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.849> where<00:00:30.330> is<00:00:30.510> the<00:00:30.689> insertion<00:00:31.019> point<00:00:31.230> of

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
that is where is the insertion point of

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.950 
that is where is the insertion point of
a<00:00:32.130> kneecap<00:00:32.489> falling<00:00:33.000> so<00:00:33.540> I'm<00:00:33.630> going<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:33.840> just

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960 
a kneecap falling so I'm going to just

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.260 
a kneecap falling so I'm going to just
zoom<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.500> a<00:00:34.620> little<00:00:34.710> bit<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.160> show<00:00:35.730> you<00:00:35.790> at

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
zoom in a little bit and show you at

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.549 
zoom in a little bit and show you at
first<00:00:36.510> just<00:00:36.750> what<00:00:36.899> the<00:00:37.110> movement<00:00:37.320> of

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
first just what the movement of

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:39.650 
first just what the movement of
popliteus<00:00:38.070> looks<00:00:38.399> like<00:00:38.610> and<00:00:38.879> then<00:00:39.360> we'll<00:00:39.510> go

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
popliteus looks like and then we'll go

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
popliteus looks like and then we'll go
over<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.930> exercise<00:00:40.379> so<00:00:41.129> if<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.730> look<00:00:41.940> at

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
over the exercise so if we look at

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.170 
over the exercise so if we look at
popliteus<00:00:42.930> its<00:00:43.559> roll<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.430> can<00:00:44.579> see<00:00:44.730> my<00:00:44.910> bony

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
popliteus its roll you can see my bony

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.369 
popliteus its roll you can see my bony
knees<00:00:45.450> here<00:00:45.809> is<00:00:45.989> to<00:00:46.860> adjust<00:00:47.579> where<00:00:48.120> this<00:00:48.989> bone

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
knees here is to adjust where this bone

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.189 
knees here is to adjust where this bone
here<00:00:49.980> Falls<00:00:50.760> now<00:00:51.149> that<00:00:51.360> bone<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.719> the

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
here Falls now that bone is the

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.080 
here Falls now that bone is the
insertion<00:00:52.680> you<00:00:52.770> can<00:00:52.920> see<00:00:53.039> the<00:00:53.309> patellar

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
insertion you can see the patellar

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.610 
insertion you can see the patellar
tendon<00:00:54.210> if<00:00:54.629> it's<00:00:54.780> over<00:00:55.020> here

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
tendon if it's over here

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.439 
tendon if it's over here
my<00:00:56.100> patella<00:00:56.460> tendon<00:00:56.850> is<00:00:56.940> going<00:00:57.059> to<00:00:57.120> be<00:00:57.210> on<00:00:57.329> an

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
my patella tendon is going to be on an

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:58.700 
my patella tendon is going to be on an
angle<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.870> could<00:00:58.079> give<00:00:58.230> me<00:00:58.379> patellar

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
angle that could give me patellar

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.470 
angle that could give me patellar
tendonitis<00:00:59.370> but<00:00:59.670> it's<00:00:59.820> also<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.359> make

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:00.480 
tendonitis but it's also going to make

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.080 
tendonitis but it's also going to make
my<00:01:00.660> it's<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:01.800> to<00:01:01.859> make<00:01:01.980> my<00:01:02.129> kneecap<00:01:02.640> want<00:01:02.940> to

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
my it's going to make my kneecap want to

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.719 
my it's going to make my kneecap want to
track<00:01:03.500> laterally<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> number<00:01:05.580> one

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
track laterally which is the number one

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.630 
track laterally which is the number one
cause<00:01:05.970> of<00:01:06.330> pain<00:01:06.900> behind<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.409> knee<00:01:07.560> so<00:01:08.280> this<00:01:08.430> is

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
cause of pain behind the knee so this is

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.170 
cause of pain behind the knee so this is
how<00:01:08.820> we<00:01:08.880> train<00:01:09.540> popliteus<00:01:10.229> as<00:01:10.500> an<00:01:10.830> exercise<00:01:11.250> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
how we train popliteus as an exercise so

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
how we train popliteus as an exercise so
we're<00:01:12.299> on<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.540> the<00:01:12.630> exercise<00:01:12.930> now<00:01:13.380> so<00:01:13.680> I'm

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
we're on to the exercise now so I'm

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.980 
we're on to the exercise now so I'm
sitting<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.369> a<00:01:14.460> relatively<00:01:14.880> low<00:01:15.330> chair<00:01:15.750> this

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990 
sitting in a relatively low chair this

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.690 
sitting in a relatively low chair this
one<00:01:16.140> might<00:01:16.290> be<00:01:16.320> a<00:01:16.439> tiny<00:01:16.799> bit<00:01:17.009> too<00:01:17.159> low<00:01:17.369> for<00:01:17.580> me

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
one might be a tiny bit too low for me

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.789 
one might be a tiny bit too low for me
but<00:01:17.909> you<00:01:18.450> want<00:01:18.630> your<00:01:18.780> knee<00:01:18.900> around<00:01:19.049> 90<00:01:19.770> degrees

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
but you want your knee around 90 degrees

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.100 
but you want your knee around 90 degrees
you<00:01:20.340> want<00:01:20.880> your<00:01:21.030> heel<00:01:21.299> located<00:01:21.900> right

you want your heel located right

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.649 
you want your heel located right
underneath<00:01:22.470> your<00:01:22.830> knee<00:01:23.009> a<00:01:23.820> perfect<00:01:24.450> height

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
underneath your knee a perfect height

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.719 
underneath your knee a perfect height
for<00:01:25.200> most<00:01:25.350> people<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> actually<00:01:26.100> the<00:01:26.310> toilet

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
for most people is actually the toilet

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:28.700 
for most people is actually the toilet
and<00:01:27.509> then<00:01:27.659> you<00:01:27.780> make<00:01:27.960> sure<00:01:28.110> you<00:01:28.229> practice<00:01:28.409> this

base of the knee right in the crease and

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.370 
base of the knee right in the crease and
palpating<00:01:42.240> or<00:01:42.360> touching<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.840> hamstring

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
palpating or touching the hamstring

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.319 
palpating or touching the hamstring
tendons<00:01:43.799> because<00:01:44.460> if<00:01:44.640> you<00:01:44.790> fire<00:01:45.119> your

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
tendons because if you fire your

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:47.300 
tendons because if you fire your
hamstrings<00:01:45.990> doing<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:47.009> a<00:01:47.189> mistake

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
hamstrings doing this that's a mistake

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.350 
hamstrings doing this that's a mistake
that's<00:01:47.729> wrong

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
that's wrong

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.510 
that's wrong
okay<00:01:48.630> they<00:01:48.840> will<00:01:49.110> produce<00:01:49.409> the<00:01:49.799> popliteus

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
okay they will produce the popliteus

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
okay they will produce the popliteus
movement<00:01:50.970> but<00:01:51.450> if<00:01:51.600> you're<00:01:51.720> using<00:01:51.899> your

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
movement but if you're using your

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.480 
movement but if you're using your
hamstrings<00:01:52.530> instead<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.009> the<00:01:53.070> popliteus

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
hamstrings instead of the popliteus

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.620 
hamstrings instead of the popliteus
guess<00:01:53.850> what<00:01:54.000> you're<00:01:54.119> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.299> get<00:01:54.450> a

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
guess what you're going to get a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.350 
guess what you're going to get a
hamstring<00:01:55.259> tendonitis<00:01:55.829> so<00:01:56.189> we<00:01:56.939> start<00:01:57.240> with

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
hamstring tendonitis so we start with

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.480 
hamstring tendonitis so we start with
our<00:01:57.509> foot<00:01:57.719> rotated<00:01:58.200> out<00:01:58.320> as<00:01:58.590> far<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.100> can<00:01:59.340> go

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
our foot rotated out as far as it can go

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:01.219 
our foot rotated out as far as it can go
now<00:01:59.759> mine<00:01:59.969> goes<00:02:00.149> a<00:02:00.180> long<00:02:00.390> way<00:02:00.630> I've<00:02:00.869> got<00:02:01.020> a<00:02:01.049> lot

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
now mine goes a long way I've got a lot

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.539 
now mine goes a long way I've got a lot
of<00:02:01.350> flexibility<00:02:01.890> with<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.280> particular

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
of flexibility with this particular

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.730 
of flexibility with this particular
thing<00:02:02.820> and<00:02:03.180> what<00:02:03.840> we<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.229> do<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.439> we<00:02:04.530> want

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
thing and what we want to do is we want

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.800 
thing and what we want to do is we want
to<00:02:04.799> just<00:02:04.950> turn<00:02:05.250> the<00:02:05.310> foot<00:02:05.729> in<00:02:05.909> words<00:02:06.180> as<00:02:06.360> far<00:02:06.630> as

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
to just turn the foot in words as far as

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.660 
to just turn the foot in words as far as
we<00:02:06.960> can<00:02:07.110> go<00:02:07.290> with

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:07.670 
we can go with

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.910 
we can go with
the<00:02:07.820> hamstrings<00:02:08.300> firing<00:02:08.720> okay<00:02:09.170> what<00:02:09.710> that's

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
the hamstrings firing okay what that's

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.160 
the hamstrings firing okay what that's
doing<00:02:10.280> again<00:02:10.520> is<00:02:10.670> lining<00:02:11.360> up<00:02:11.510> this<00:02:12.170> patellar

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:14.170 
doing again is lining up this patellar

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:17.110 
doing again is lining up this patellar
tendons<00:02:15.170> insertion<00:02:16.010> point<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.760> tibial

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
tendons insertion point the tibial

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:18.910 
tendons insertion point the tibial
tubercle<00:02:17.390> now<00:02:17.630> it<00:02:17.900> should<00:02:18.140> ideally<00:02:18.500> fall

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:18.920 
tubercle now it should ideally fall

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.250 
tubercle now it should ideally fall
right<00:02:19.790> in<00:02:19.940> the<00:02:20.000> middle<00:02:20.150> of<00:02:20.300> your<00:02:20.450> knee<00:02:20.540> but

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
right in the middle of your knee but

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.020 
right in the middle of your knee but
when<00:02:21.650> we're<00:02:21.800> trying<00:02:21.980> to<00:02:22.160> work<00:02:22.400> on<00:02:22.580> the<00:02:22.700> muscle

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
when we're trying to work on the muscle

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.460 
when we're trying to work on the muscle
it's<00:02:23.240> okay<00:02:23.540> to<00:02:23.600> bring<00:02:23.900> it<00:02:24.050> too<00:02:24.170> far<00:02:24.410> and

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
it's okay to bring it too far and

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.960 
it's okay to bring it too far and
actually<00:02:24.830> bring<00:02:24.980> it<00:02:25.070> as<00:02:25.160> far<00:02:25.459> as<00:02:25.640> it<00:02:25.790> can

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
actually bring it as far as it can

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.840 
actually bring it as far as it can
possibly<00:02:26.000> go<00:02:26.660> now<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:28.280> point<00:02:28.610> of<00:02:28.760> this

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:28.850 
possibly go now the point of this

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.670 
possibly go now the point of this
exercise<00:02:29.060> you're<00:02:29.959> not<00:02:30.110> going<00:02:30.320> to<00:02:30.380> get<00:02:30.470> much<00:02:30.620> of

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:30.680 
exercise you're not going to get much of

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.770 
exercise you're not going to get much of
a<00:02:30.890> burning<00:02:31.400> sensation<00:02:31.610> you<00:02:32.150> may<00:02:32.420> if<00:02:32.630> you're

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
a burning sensation you may if you're

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.550 
a burning sensation you may if you're
really<00:02:33.080> good<00:02:33.230> at<00:02:33.380> it

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
really good at it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.100 
really good at it
learn<00:02:34.100> to<00:02:34.430> feel<00:02:34.790> sort<00:02:35.120> of<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.300> sense<00:02:35.510> of<00:02:35.660> effort

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
learn to feel sort of a sense of effort

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:37.900 
learn to feel sort of a sense of effort
of<00:02:36.560> this<00:02:36.800> popliteus<00:02:37.310> and<00:02:37.580> it<00:02:37.640> kind<00:02:37.850> of

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
of this popliteus and it kind of

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.729 
of this popliteus and it kind of
produced<00:02:38.209> this<00:02:38.510> weird<00:02:38.870> all<00:02:39.110> over<00:02:39.410> achy

00:02:39.729 --> 00:02:39.739 
produced this weird all over achy

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.199 
produced this weird all over achy
fatigue<00:02:40.100> when<00:02:40.310> you're<00:02:40.430> when<00:02:40.820> you're<00:02:40.850> firing

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
fatigue when you're when you're firing

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:43.720 
fatigue when you're when you're firing
it<00:02:41.510> but<00:02:42.080> the<00:02:42.170> main<00:02:42.350> thing<00:02:42.560> is<00:02:42.590> can<00:02:43.010> you<00:02:43.130> use<00:02:43.459> the

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:43.730 
it but the main thing is can you use the

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.729 
it but the main thing is can you use the
muscle<00:02:44.090> without<00:02:44.630> compensation<00:02:45.380> now<00:02:45.680> the

00:02:45.729 --> 00:02:45.739 
muscle without compensation now the

00:02:45.739 --> 00:02:47.560 
muscle without compensation now the
number<00:02:46.070> one<00:02:46.100> compensation<00:02:46.910> is<00:02:47.060> to<00:02:47.090> fire<00:02:47.360> the

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:47.570 
number one compensation is to fire the

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:48.940 
number one compensation is to fire the
medial<00:02:47.840> hamstring<00:02:48.320> in<00:02:48.440> which<00:02:48.590> case<00:02:48.769> you'll

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:48.950 
medial hamstring in which case you'll

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.130 
medial hamstring in which case you'll
feel<00:02:49.220> the<00:02:49.400> tendon<00:02:49.760> tensing<00:02:50.600> up<00:02:50.720> underneath

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
feel the tendon tensing up underneath

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.330 
feel the tendon tensing up underneath
your<00:02:51.290> fingers<00:02:51.560> it's<00:02:51.709> easy<00:02:51.860> to<00:02:52.010> feel<00:02:52.160> it's<00:02:52.310> a

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:52.340 
your fingers it's easy to feel it's a

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.330 
your fingers it's easy to feel it's a
big<00:02:52.519> fat<00:02:52.760> tendon<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.870> other<00:02:54.340> compensation

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
big fat tendon the other compensation

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.220 
big fat tendon the other compensation
and<00:02:55.550> it's<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.239> little<00:02:56.480> bit<00:02:56.570> harder<00:02:56.780> to<00:02:56.840> fix<00:02:57.050> this

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
and it's a little bit harder to fix this

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.410 
and it's a little bit harder to fix this
one<00:02:57.380> is<00:02:57.500> when<00:02:57.680> people<00:02:57.860> use<00:02:58.040> sort<00:02:58.760> of<00:02:58.820> an<00:02:58.940> ankle

00:02:59.410 --> 00:02:59.420 
one is when people use sort of an ankle

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.180 
one is when people use sort of an ankle
sweep<00:02:59.690> and<00:02:59.900> they<00:02:59.959> kind<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.260> do<00:03:00.470> this<00:03:00.980> with

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
sweep and they kind of do this with

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.590 
sweep and they kind of do this with
their<00:03:01.280> ankles<00:03:01.580> so<00:03:01.640> if<00:03:01.760> you<00:03:01.880> watch<00:03:02.090> this<00:03:02.360> bone

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:02.600 
their ankles so if you watch this bone

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.570 
their ankles so if you watch this bone
underneath<00:03:02.930> my<00:03:03.140> fingertips<00:03:03.709> when<00:03:04.190> I<00:03:04.220> do<00:03:04.370> it

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:04.580 
underneath my fingertips when I do it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:07.300 
underneath my fingertips when I do it
right<00:03:04.820> this<00:03:05.360> bone<00:03:05.780> and<00:03:06.110> my<00:03:06.410> foot<00:03:06.709> are<00:03:06.920> moving

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:07.310 
right this bone and my foot are moving

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
right this bone and my foot are moving
simultaneously<00:03:07.940> but<00:03:08.900> if<00:03:09.170> I<00:03:09.320> do<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:10.030> my<00:03:11.030> foot

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:11.330 
simultaneously but if I do that my foot

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.390 
simultaneously but if I do that my foot
is<00:03:11.360> moving<00:03:11.840> my<00:03:12.260> knee<00:03:12.320> isn't<00:03:12.709> moving<00:03:12.829> at<00:03:13.040> all<00:03:13.100> in

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
is moving my knee isn't moving at all in

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.759 
is moving my knee isn't moving at all in
fact<00:03:13.579> I<00:03:13.790> could<00:03:13.970> put<00:03:14.180> my<00:03:14.329> patellar<00:03:15.320> tendon<00:03:15.680> way

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
fact I could put my patellar tendon way

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.170 
fact I could put my patellar tendon way
over<00:03:16.010> here<00:03:16.160> and<00:03:16.280> do<00:03:16.340> this<00:03:16.489> with<00:03:16.640> my<00:03:16.760> foot

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
over here and do this with my foot

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.509 
over here and do this with my foot
I<00:03:17.209> still<00:03:17.630> got<00:03:17.840> a<00:03:18.049> massive<00:03:18.590> deviation<00:03:19.370> in

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:19.519 
I still got a massive deviation in

00:03:19.519 --> 00:03:21.970 
I still got a massive deviation in
epital<00:03:19.850> a<00:03:19.910> tendon<00:03:20.329> that's<00:03:20.870> not<00:03:21.470> going<00:03:21.709> to<00:03:21.769> fix

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
epital a tendon that's not going to fix

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.160 
epital a tendon that's not going to fix
my<00:03:22.250> patellar<00:03:22.579> tendinitis<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:23.600> the<00:03:23.720> foot<00:03:23.959> has

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
my patellar tendinitis so the foot has

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.840 
my patellar tendinitis so the foot has
to<00:03:24.410> stay<00:03:24.620> flat<00:03:24.950> and<00:03:25.160> one<00:03:25.280> of<00:03:25.340> the<00:03:25.430> best<00:03:25.579> ways<00:03:25.820> to

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
to stay flat and one of the best ways to

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.630 
to stay flat and one of the best ways to
think<00:03:26.269> about<00:03:26.480> it<00:03:26.630> is<00:03:26.750> if<00:03:27.230> the<00:03:27.380> base<00:03:27.739> of<00:03:28.070> the<00:03:28.459> big

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
think about it is if the base of the big

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.880 
think about it is if the base of the big
toe<00:03:28.840> comes<00:03:29.840> up<00:03:30.019> in<00:03:30.140> the<00:03:30.230> air<00:03:30.350> as<00:03:30.500> you<00:03:30.620> do<00:03:30.709> this

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
toe comes up in the air as you do this

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.650 
toe comes up in the air as you do this
then<00:03:31.160> you're<00:03:31.280> doing<00:03:31.430> a<00:03:31.579> foot<00:03:31.790> sweep<00:03:31.970> your<00:03:32.450> fort

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.660 
then you're doing a foot sweep your fort

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.810 
then you're doing a foot sweep your fort
should<00:03:32.810> stay<00:03:33.049> totally<00:03:33.320> flat<00:03:33.799> I<00:03:34.010> like<00:03:34.370> to<00:03:34.519> touch

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:34.820 
should stay totally flat I like to touch

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.580 
should stay totally flat I like to touch
the<00:03:35.060> bone<00:03:35.239> of<00:03:35.420> my<00:03:35.450> knees<00:03:35.780> I'm<00:03:36.049> doing<00:03:36.290> this<00:03:36.380> and

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:36.590 
the bone of my knees I'm doing this and

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:39.550 
the bone of my knees I'm doing this and
watch<00:03:36.829> my<00:03:37.130> foot<00:03:37.430> so<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.269> make<00:03:38.690> sure<00:03:38.959> that

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:39.560 
watch my foot so that I make sure that

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.890 
watch my foot so that I make sure that
there's<00:03:39.799> a<00:03:40.150> simultaneousness<00:03:41.150> if<00:03:41.690> that's

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:41.900 
there's a simultaneousness if that's

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.960 
there's a simultaneousness if that's
even<00:03:42.049> a<00:03:42.200> word<00:03:42.230> of<00:03:42.650> the<00:03:43.250> movement<00:03:43.579> and<00:03:43.670> I'm<00:03:43.760> not

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:43.970 
even a word of the movement and I'm not

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.789 
even a word of the movement and I'm not
moving<00:03:44.299> my<00:03:44.329> foot<00:03:44.690> more<00:03:45.049> than<00:03:45.260> I'm<00:03:45.380> moving<00:03:45.650> my

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:45.799 
moving my foot more than I'm moving my

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.789 
moving my foot more than I'm moving my
shin<00:03:46.070> so<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.820> tricky<00:03:47.090> exercise<00:03:47.660> our<00:03:48.260> aim<00:03:48.620> is

00:03:48.789 --> 00:03:48.799 
shin so the tricky exercise our aim is

00:03:48.799 --> 00:03:51.009 
shin so the tricky exercise our aim is
to<00:03:48.829> kind<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.280> come<00:03:49.700> across<00:03:49.850> as<00:03:50.390> far<00:03:50.630> as<00:03:50.750> we<00:03:50.900> can

00:03:51.009 --> 00:03:51.019 
to kind of come across as far as we can

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:52.600 
to kind of come across as far as we can
go<00:03:51.170> without<00:03:51.320> cheating<00:03:51.769> so<00:03:52.040> for<00:03:52.250> me<00:03:52.340> it's<00:03:52.489> about

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610 
go without cheating so for me it's about

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.030 
go without cheating so for me it's about
there<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:53.269> now<00:03:53.720> I<00:03:53.780> want<00:03:54.049> to<00:03:54.140> hold<00:03:54.350> that<00:03:54.500> for<00:03:54.860> 10

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 
there and now I want to hold that for 10

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.190 
there and now I want to hold that for 10
seconds<00:03:55.640> and<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.150> want<00:03:56.360> to<00:03:56.420> repeat<00:03:56.690> it<00:03:56.720> 10<00:03:56.989> times

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
seconds and I want to repeat it 10 times

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.830 
seconds and I want to repeat it 10 times
to<00:03:57.470> let<00:03:57.590> our<00:03:57.739> brains<00:03:58.070> learn<00:03:58.489> how<00:03:59.239> to<00:03:59.299> use<00:03:59.600> this

00:03:59.830 --> 00:03:59.840 
to let our brains learn how to use this

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.230 
to let our brains learn how to use this
muscle
