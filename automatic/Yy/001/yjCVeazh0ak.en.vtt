00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:11.620 
just transfer it in to your PSP folder
so<00:04:09.739> that's<00:04:10.160> all<00:04:10.370> you<00:04:10.519> really<00:04:10.670> do<00:04:11.000> the<00:04:11.420> only

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:11.630 
so that's all you really do the only

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.000 
so that's all you really do the only
reason<00:04:11.930> you<00:04:12.019> have<00:04:12.049> to<00:04:12.139> convert<00:04:12.470> is<00:04:12.650> because

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
reason you have to convert is because

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.479 
reason you have to convert is because
the<00:04:13.700> PSP<00:04:14.209> only<00:04:14.569> takes<00:04:14.810> mpeg-4<00:04:15.620> I'm<00:04:16.010> not<00:04:16.340> sure

00:04:16.479 --> 00:04:16.489 
the PSP only takes mpeg-4 I'm not sure

00:04:16.489 --> 00:04:18.129 
the PSP only takes mpeg-4 I'm not sure
why<00:04:16.729> I've<00:04:16.970> tried<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.239> with<00:04:17.269> ABI<00:04:17.599> doesn't<00:04:18.019> work

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
why I've tried it with ABI doesn't work

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:20.920 
why I've tried it with ABI doesn't work
but<00:04:18.680> that's<00:04:19.250> the<00:04:19.489> only<00:04:19.609> way<00:04:19.789> it<00:04:19.910> works<00:04:20.060> and

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:20.930 
but that's the only way it works and

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:21.969 
but that's the only way it works and
that's<00:04:21.320> basically<00:04:21.620> it

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:21.979 
that's basically it

00:04:21.979 --> 00:04:23.409 
that's basically it
