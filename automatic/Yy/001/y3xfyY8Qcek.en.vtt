00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
totalizations and it just seems to

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.190

learning to recognize and feel and

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:52.639 
learning to recognize and feel and
reproduce<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.390> beautiful<00:00:51.960> tone<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.559> we

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
reproduce the beautiful tone that we

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.880 
reproduce the beautiful tone that we
hear<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:53.070> Masters<00:00:53.489> playing<00:00:53.879> and<00:00:54.680> it<00:00:55.680> has<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
second benefit and that is it utilizes

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.070 
second benefit and that is it utilizes
the<00:00:59.760> Rini<00:01:00.030> notes<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.600> our<00:01:00.660> violin<00:01:02.359> namely<00:01:03.359> the

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
the Rini notes on our violin namely the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:06.950 
the Rini notes on our violin namely the
ones<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:04.589> ring<00:01:04.830> with<00:01:05.040> our<00:01:05.189> open<00:01:05.580> strings<00:01:06.060> so

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
ones that ring with our open strings so

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.850 
ones that ring with our open strings so
this<00:01:07.229> exercise<00:01:07.680> has<00:01:08.430> lots<00:01:08.760> of<00:01:08.939> G's<00:01:09.270> DS<00:01:09.869> A's<00:01:10.409> and

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
this exercise has lots of G's DS A's and

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.440 
this exercise has lots of G's DS A's and
E's<00:01:11.760> in<00:01:12.000> it<00:01:12.270> and<00:01:12.530> that<00:01:13.530> really<00:01:14.299> improves<00:01:15.299> our

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
E's in it and that really improves our

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.359 
E's in it and that really improves our
intonation<00:01:15.780> because<00:01:16.439> if<00:01:16.560> you<00:01:16.650> can<00:01:16.860> latch<00:01:17.100> on

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
intonation because if you can latch on

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.850 
intonation because if you can latch on
to<00:01:17.580> those<00:01:17.670> ringy<00:01:18.060> notes<00:01:18.360> it's<00:01:19.320> kind<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.710> like

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
to those ringy notes it's kind of like

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.249 
to those ringy notes it's kind of like
having<00:01:20.070> little<00:01:20.369> frets<00:01:20.820> or<00:01:21.060> little<00:01:21.630> tapes<00:01:21.960> on

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
having little frets or little tapes on

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.020 
having little frets or little tapes on
your<00:01:22.530> violin<00:01:22.979> even<00:01:23.430> though<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.790> you<00:01:23.909> don't

your violin even though if you don't
have<00:01:24.299> any<00:01:24.479> tapes<00:01:24.780> so<00:01:25.740> it's<00:01:25.920> kind<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.280> a<00:01:26.369> little

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:26.490 
have any tapes so it's kind of a little

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.819 
have any tapes so it's kind of a little
crutch<00:01:26.880> even<00:01:27.330> in<00:01:27.450> third<00:01:27.810> position<00:01:28.049> even<00:01:28.500> in

00:01:28.819 --> 00:01:28.829 
crutch even in third position even in

it helps you to to not drift we all know
what<00:01:39.090> it's<00:01:39.240> like<00:01:39.329> when<00:01:39.720> you're<00:01:39.869> playing<00:01:40.110> a

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
what it's like when you're playing a

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.170 
what it's like when you're playing a
scale<00:01:40.650> high<00:01:41.070> up<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.630> fourth<00:01:42.630> position<00:01:42.899> and<00:01:44.180> we

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
scale high up in fourth position and we

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:46.999 
scale high up in fourth position and we
come<00:01:45.420> down<00:01:45.450> to<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:45.930> bottom<00:01:46.229> of<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.409> scale<00:01:46.740> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
come down to the bottom of the scale and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:52.550 
come down to the bottom of the scale and
we<00:01:47.189> started<00:01:47.579> in<00:01:47.729> C<00:01:48.090> but<00:01:48.869> we're<00:01:49.290> now<00:01:49.409> in<00:01:49.649> B<00:01:51.049> so<00:01:52.049> if

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
we started in C but we're now in B so if

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.100 
we started in C but we're now in B so if
you<00:01:52.979> learn<00:01:53.220> to<00:01:53.549> latch<00:01:54.000> onto<00:01:54.329> those<00:01:54.540> Rini<00:01:54.840> notes

1/5<00:02:28.860> so<00:02:29.310> then<00:02:29.460> it's<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.730> C<00:02:30.060> major<00:02:30.270> arpeggio<00:02:31.080> you

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
1/5 so then it's a C major arpeggio you

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:42.750 
1/5 so then it's a C major arpeggio you
just<00:02:31.770> move<00:02:31.980> it<00:02:32.100> over<00:02:32.160> a<00:02:32.340> string

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.809 

okay<00:02:43.760> so<00:02:43.819> both<00:02:44.209> of<00:02:44.239> those<00:02:44.540> are<00:02:44.780> helpful<00:02:45.260> and<00:02:45.829> of

00:02:46.809 --> 00:02:46.819 
okay so both of those are helpful and of

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:48.970 
okay so both of those are helpful and of
course<00:02:47.090> I'm<00:02:47.540> always<00:02:47.840> looking<00:02:48.319> for<00:02:48.349> a<00:02:48.590> shortcut

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:48.980 
course I'm always looking for a shortcut

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.170 
course I'm always looking for a shortcut
so<00:02:49.519> I<00:02:49.549> kind<00:02:49.939> of<00:02:50.090> morphed<00:02:50.989> those<00:02:51.379> two<00:02:51.680> together

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
so I kind of morphed those two together

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.690 
so I kind of morphed those two together
it<00:02:53.180> hits<00:02:53.599> most<00:02:54.079> of<00:02:54.409> our<00:02:54.530> rainy<00:02:54.799> notes<00:02:55.129> that<00:02:55.549> we

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
it hits most of our rainy notes that we

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.599 
it hits most of our rainy notes that we
need<00:02:55.939> and<00:02:56.209> it<00:02:56.840> saves<00:02:57.140> some<00:02:57.470> time<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.159> here's<00:02:58.430> my

00:02:58.599 --> 00:02:58.609 
need and it saves some time so here's my

00:02:58.609 --> 00:03:09.100 
need and it saves some time so here's my
combined<00:02:59.180> version

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:09.110 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.750 

gives<00:03:10.110> you<00:03:10.200> lots<00:03:10.440> of<00:03:10.560> fourth<00:03:10.860> finger<00:03:11.250> work<00:03:11.490> and

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
gives you lots of fourth finger work and

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.360 
gives you lots of fourth finger work and
I<00:03:12.720> have<00:03:13.020> my<00:03:13.200> students<00:03:13.680> learn<00:03:13.890> that<00:03:14.130> one

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
I have my students learn that one

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.790 
I have my students learn that one
instead<00:03:14.880> of<00:03:15.030> doing<00:03:15.600> the<00:03:15.750> two<00:03:15.960> totalizations

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
instead of doing the two totalizations

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:20.360 
instead of doing the two totalizations
the<00:03:17.700> G<00:03:17.910> major<00:03:18.120> and<00:03:18.480> the<00:03:18.570> C<00:03:18.840> major<00:03:19.020> I<00:03:19.410> have<00:03:20.160> them

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:20.370 
the G major and the C major I have them

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.110 
the G major and the C major I have them
do<00:03:20.550> the<00:03:20.580> hybrid<00:03:21.860> totalization<00:03:22.890> okay<00:03:23.790> now

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
do the hybrid totalization okay now

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:27.640 
do the hybrid totalization okay now
let's<00:03:24.720> talk<00:03:24.930> about<00:03:25.110> the<00:03:25.770> ringing<00:03:25.980> notes

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:27.650 
let's talk about the ringing notes

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.470 
let's talk about the ringing notes
everyone<00:03:28.650> can<00:03:28.830> hear<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.100> but<00:03:29.940> not<00:03:30.120> everyone

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
everyone can hear it but not everyone

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.200 
everyone can hear it but not everyone
pays<00:03:30.690> attention<00:03:31.670> listen<00:03:32.670> to<00:03:32.790> this<00:03:32.940> note

pays attention listen to this note

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:40.720

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
string vibrating it's my g string

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:56.570 
string vibrating it's my g string
because<00:03:53.220> I'm<00:03:53.340> playing<00:03:53.580> the<00:03:53.760> note<00:03:53.970> G<00:03:54.270> and<00:03:55.310> my<00:03:56.310> g

it's dead and we all instinctively know

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.150 
it's dead and we all instinctively know
that<00:04:21.210> note<00:04:21.750> should<00:04:21.989> be<00:04:22.140> resonating<00:04:22.590> more<00:04:22.980> than

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160 
that note should be resonating more than

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:35.600 
that note should be resonating more than
that<00:04:33.200> it's<00:04:34.200> hideous<00:04:34.590> when<00:04:35.190> you're<00:04:35.370> really

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
that it's hideous when you're really

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:39.470 
that it's hideous when you're really
paying<00:04:35.820> attention<00:04:37.520> okay<00:04:38.520> so<00:04:38.580> Rini<00:04:39.030> threes

00:04:39.470 --> 00:04:39.480 
paying attention okay so Rini threes

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.570 
paying attention okay so Rini threes
those<00:04:40.140> are<00:04:40.290> our<00:04:40.410> rainiest<00:04:40.950> notes<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.460> the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
those are our rainiest notes on the

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.610 
those are our rainiest notes on the
violin<00:04:42.000> and<00:04:42.240> then<00:04:42.750> of<00:04:42.870> course<00:04:43.110> our<00:04:43.290> fourth

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
violin and then of course our fourth

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.370 
violin and then of course our fourth
fingers<00:04:44.040> should<00:04:44.820> sound<00:04:45.120> identical<00:04:45.990> to<00:04:46.230> our

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
fingers should sound identical to our

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.850 
fingers should sound identical to our
open<00:04:46.770> strings<00:04:47.250> by<00:04:47.970> the<00:04:48.030> same<00:04:48.360> name<00:04:48.630> so<00:04:49.560> those

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:49.860 
open strings by the same name so those

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:51.860 
open strings by the same name so those
are<00:04:50.070> really<00:04:50.490> ringing<00:04:50.760> notes<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.330> then<00:04:51.750> you've

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:51.870 
are really ringing notes and then you've

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.930 
are really ringing notes and then you've
got<00:04:52.020> a<00:04:52.050> few<00:04:52.380> others<00:04:52.650> you've<00:04:52.920> got<00:04:52.950> first<00:04:53.610> finger

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:53.940 
got a few others you've got first finger

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:56.180 
got a few others you've got first finger
a

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:56.190 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.129 

that<00:04:57.190> makes<00:04:57.400> my<00:04:57.580> a<00:04:57.610> string<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.240> my<00:04:58.570> E<00:04:58.600> string

00:04:59.129 --> 00:04:59.139 
that makes my a string and my E string

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:11.189 
that makes my a string and my E string
talk<00:05:01.800> and<00:05:02.800> then<00:05:03.610> this<00:05:03.760> first<00:05:04.090> finger<00:05:04.360> e<00:05:10.199> it's

00:05:11.189 --> 00:05:11.199 
talk and then this first finger e it's

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:15.659 
talk and then this first finger e it's
obvious<00:05:13.290> loafing<00:05:14.290> low<00:05:14.650> second<00:05:15.130> finger<00:05:15.400> G

00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:15.669 
obvious loafing low second finger G

00:05:15.669 --> 00:05:22.500 
obvious loafing low second finger G
natural<00:05:19.260> beautiful<00:05:20.260> and<00:05:20.620> then<00:05:21.510> technically

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:22.510 
natural beautiful and then technically

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:26.040 
natural beautiful and then technically
the<00:05:22.870> note<00:05:23.050> B<00:05:23.380> on<00:05:24.130> our<00:05:24.190> violin<00:05:24.760> is<00:05:25.630> a<00:05:25.690> ring<00:05:26.020> e

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
the note B on our violin is a ring e

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.320 
the note B on our violin is a ring e
note<00:05:26.290> but<00:05:27.070> it's<00:05:27.190> really<00:05:27.520> hard<00:05:27.850> to<00:05:28.000> hear<00:05:28.180> the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
note but it's really hard to hear the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:31.260 
note but it's really hard to hear the
ring<00:05:28.570> it<00:05:29.200> takes<00:05:29.470> a<00:05:29.620> little<00:05:29.740> experience<00:05:30.280> B

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:31.270 
ring it takes a little experience B

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.690 
ring it takes a little experience B
qualifies<00:05:31.960> as<00:05:32.260> a<00:05:32.290> ringing<00:05:32.740> note<00:05:32.889> because<00:05:33.220> it

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:33.700 
qualifies as a ringing note because it

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:36.540 
qualifies as a ringing note because it
is<00:05:34.150> a<00:05:34.450> prominent<00:05:35.229> note<00:05:35.560> in<00:05:35.740> our<00:05:35.919> overtone

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:36.550 
is a prominent note in our overtone

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:40.530 
is a prominent note in our overtone
series<00:05:36.910> and<00:05:37.919> more<00:05:38.919> simply<00:05:39.340> put<00:05:39.370> if<00:05:39.760> we<00:05:39.970> had<00:05:40.180> a

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:40.540 
series and more simply put if we had a

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.320 
series and more simply put if we had a
string<00:05:41.320> higher<00:05:41.919> than<00:05:42.160> our<00:05:42.250> E<00:05:42.430> string<00:05:42.460> it<00:05:43.180> would

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:43.330 
string higher than our E string it would

00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.010 
string higher than our E string it would
be<00:05:43.450> a<00:05:43.479> B<00:05:43.750> string<00:05:44.110> and<00:05:44.550> that<00:05:45.550> just<00:05:46.270> situate<00:05:46.780> sit

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
be a B string and that just situate sit

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:48.650 
be a B string and that just situate sit
in<00:05:47.169> the<00:05:47.410> overtone<00:05:47.830> series<00:05:48.130> so<00:05:48.580> that

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:48.660 
in the overtone series so that

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.060 
in the overtone series so that
technically<00:05:49.660> it<00:05:49.840> is<00:05:49.960> a<00:05:49.990> ring<00:05:50.200> e<00:05:50.229> note<00:05:50.440> and<00:05:50.650> it

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:51.070 
technically it is a ring e note and it

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:58.770 
technically it is a ring e note and it
is<00:05:51.190> a<00:05:51.220> harmonic<00:05:55.350> that's<00:05:56.350> a<00:05:56.470> B<00:05:57.300> okay<00:05:58.300> so<00:05:58.360> B<00:05:58.630> is<00:05:58.690> a

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
is a harmonic that's a B okay so B is a

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:02.250 
is a harmonic that's a B okay so B is a
ring<00:05:59.020> e<00:05:59.050> note<00:05:59.289> as<00:05:59.440> well<00:05:59.650> so<00:06:00.660> please<00:06:01.660> play<00:06:02.139> these

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
ring e note as well so please play these

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:05.629 
ring e note as well so please play these

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:08.350 
nailing the rainiest it's not good

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.140 
nailing the rainiest it's not good
enough<00:06:08.620> i<00:06:08.860> tell<00:06:09.100> my<00:06:09.220> students<00:06:09.580> it's<00:06:09.729> not<00:06:09.760> good

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
enough i tell my students it's not good

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:13.230 
enough i tell my students it's not good
enough<00:06:10.389> to<00:06:10.690> be<00:06:10.870> sort<00:06:11.680> of<00:06:11.740> ringing<00:06:12.039> you<00:06:12.910> need<00:06:13.090> to

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.240 
enough to be sort of ringing you need to

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.350 
enough to be sort of ringing you need to
find<00:06:13.450> the<00:06:13.660> maximum<00:06:14.470> ring<00:06:15.010> enos<00:06:15.310> and<00:06:15.550> your

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:16.360 
find the maximum ring enos and your

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:18.810 
find the maximum ring enos and your
intonation<00:06:16.630> will<00:06:17.169> improve<00:06:17.590> so<00:06:18.340> I<00:06:18.370> tell<00:06:18.669> my

00:06:18.810 --> 00:06:18.820 
intonation will improve so I tell my

00:06:18.820 --> 00:06:20.820 
intonation will improve so I tell my
students<00:06:19.240> give<00:06:19.510> yourself<00:06:19.870> four<00:06:20.200> try<00:06:20.530> as<00:06:20.590> at

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:20.830 
students give yourself four try as at

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:26.360 
students give yourself four try as at
first

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:26.370 

00:06:26.370 --> 00:06:29.640 

go<00:06:27.370> ahead<00:06:27.580> and<00:06:27.729> fish<00:06:27.969> around<00:06:28.330> but<00:06:29.199> by<00:06:29.590> the

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:29.650 
go ahead and fish around but by the

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.490 
go ahead and fish around but by the
fourth<00:06:30.069> bow<00:06:30.490> you<00:06:31.419> need<00:06:31.599> to<00:06:31.750> be<00:06:31.870> on<00:06:32.050> the

00:06:32.490 --> 00:06:32.500 
fourth bow you need to be on the

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:34.860 
fourth bow you need to be on the
bullseye<00:06:32.889> and<00:06:33.879> it<00:06:34.090> helps<00:06:34.389> to<00:06:34.539> fish<00:06:34.719> around

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:34.870 
bullseye and it helps to fish around

00:06:34.870 --> 00:06:37.439 
bullseye and it helps to fish around
because<00:06:35.469> you<00:06:36.219> might<00:06:36.400> be<00:06:36.430> thinking<00:06:37.150> it's<00:06:37.270> the

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:37.449 
because you might be thinking it's the

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:38.969 
because you might be thinking it's the
right<00:06:37.599> spot<00:06:37.960> because<00:06:38.139> it's<00:06:38.349> kind<00:06:38.650> of<00:06:38.740> rainy

00:06:38.969 --> 00:06:38.979 
right spot because it's kind of rainy

00:06:38.979 --> 00:06:41.999 
right spot because it's kind of rainy
but<00:06:39.219> if<00:06:39.879> you<00:06:39.969> fish<00:06:40.270> a<00:06:40.300> little<00:06:40.719> bit<00:06:41.009> you

00:06:41.999 --> 00:06:42.009 
but if you fish a little bit you

00:06:42.009 --> 00:06:44.520 
but if you fish a little bit you
discover<00:06:42.460> even<00:06:42.699> a<00:06:42.909> ring<00:06:43.210> ear<00:06:43.360> spot<00:06:43.780> when

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:44.530 
discover even a ring ear spot when

00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:48.029 
discover even a ring ear spot when
you're<00:06:44.620> fishing<00:06:44.889> don't<00:06:45.879> fish<00:06:46.210> a<00:06:46.509> lot<00:06:47.289> just

00:06:48.029 --> 00:06:48.039 
you're fishing don't fish a lot just

00:06:48.039 --> 00:06:51.059 
you're fishing don't fish a lot just
roll<00:06:48.310> your<00:06:48.520> finger<00:06:48.939> tip<00:06:49.180> a<00:06:49.389> little<00:06:49.919> because<00:06:50.919> in

00:06:51.059 --> 00:06:51.069 
roll your finger tip a little because in

00:06:51.069 --> 00:06:54.689 
roll your finger tip a little because in
violin<00:06:51.610> we<00:06:51.969> deal<00:06:52.300> in<00:06:52.530> nanometers<00:06:53.530> on<00:06:54.490> the

00:06:54.689 --> 00:06:54.699 
violin we deal in nanometers on the

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:57.119 
violin we deal in nanometers on the
fingerboard<00:06:55.139> one<00:06:56.139> nanometer<00:06:56.530> makes<00:06:57.009> a

00:06:57.119 --> 00:06:57.129 
fingerboard one nanometer makes a

00:06:57.129 --> 00:07:01.610 
fingerboard one nanometer makes a
difference<00:06:57.580> in<00:06:57.759> our<00:06:57.849> intonation<00:06:58.150> so<00:06:58.719> just

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:01.620 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:05.850 

just<00:07:02.620> gently<00:07:03.099> fish<00:07:03.550> okay<00:07:04.389> then<00:07:05.199> when<00:07:05.710> you're

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:05.860 
just gently fish okay then when you're

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.869 
just gently fish okay then when you're
nailing<00:07:06.069> your<00:07:06.729> four<00:07:07.090> tries<00:07:07.770> consistently

00:07:08.869 --> 00:07:08.879 
nailing your four tries consistently

00:07:08.879 --> 00:07:18.650 
nailing your four tries consistently
only<00:07:09.879> give<00:07:10.029> yourself<00:07:10.419> three<00:07:10.779> tries

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:18.660 

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.180 

and<00:07:19.230> so<00:07:20.100> on<00:07:20.280> then<00:07:20.670> two<00:07:20.940> tries<00:07:21.300> and<00:07:21.510> finally<00:07:22.470> the

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:23.190 
and so on then two tries and finally the

00:07:23.190 --> 00:07:25.580 
and so on then two tries and finally the
beautiful<00:07:23.640> totalization<00:07:24.480> where<00:07:25.020> you<00:07:25.440> are

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:25.590 
beautiful totalization where you are

00:07:25.590 --> 00:07:28.070 
beautiful totalization where you are
nailing<00:07:25.890> it<00:07:26.160> on<00:07:26.340> the<00:07:26.700> first<00:07:26.940> try<00:07:27.180> every<00:07:27.600> time<00:07:27.840> I

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080 
nailing it on the first try every time I

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:30.560 
nailing it on the first try every time I
hope<00:07:28.830> that<00:07:29.100> the<00:07:29.280> the<00:07:30.030> concept<00:07:30.510> of

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:30.570 
hope that the the concept of

00:07:30.570 --> 00:07:32.720 
hope that the the concept of
totalizations<00:07:31.410> will<00:07:31.680> serve<00:07:31.920> you<00:07:32.100> well<00:07:32.250> like

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:32.730 
totalizations will serve you well like

00:07:32.730 --> 00:07:35.000 
totalizations will serve you well like
