 namely one day can be read about the state 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:35.420
 In the following we want to go through the three steps of planning together 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.120
 first draw in the floor plan secondly 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.580
 Apartment in the 3 the facility 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:42.479
 thirdly 

00:00:42.479 --> 00:00:44.560
 Present planning 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:49.080
 In order to start planning, the first thing to do is go over the top of the head 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.980
 a new planning law and licks 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.649
 We decided to let her know the ceiling height of her apartment 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.350
 or the revised floor 

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.820
 Reason for this is a sign of the surround assistant 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:08.940
 The quickest way is to use the floor plan with the room assistant 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.120

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:19.990
 for example, the right shape 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.469

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.740
 You can enter the exact room data manually afterwards 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.159

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:13.330
 about the apartments or the house

 then drag the window to the appropriate position in the wall 

00:02:35.779 --> 00:02:40.029
 so they gradually provide the entire apartment with windows and doors

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:23.799
 this sand is done 

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:27.869
 through the continuous metro-shares, they managed the managed 

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:32.619
 Apartments in three that set up his motos and catalog 

00:03:33.969 --> 00:03:39.169
 We have now created the floor plan including the doors and windows 

00:03:39.169 --> 00:03:42.299
 Now we can turn to the device 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:47.959
 We should be despondent about the construction mode of India 

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:52.569

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:54.010
 Switch mode back 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:57.650
 and if the window to move doors and miscellaneous 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:02.540

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:10.299
 and many more 

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:13.169
 the central element is the catalog 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:17.209
 the catalog contains all three of the objects colors and textures 

00:04:17.949 --> 00:04:20.949
 and many more practical elements 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.100
 the catalog opens automatically when in this mode 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:30.610
 you should have accidentally closed the catalog 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:35.740
 switch it on again via the switch catalog on in the upper right corner 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:38.120
 Open the corner 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:43.520
 In the catalog, they essentially have the choice between furniture and textures 

00:04:44.620 --> 00:04:48.960

 Color or a new surface to provide 

00:05:07.349 --> 00:05:10.910
 Let's start with the furniture using the example of the kitchen 

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:16.009
 Change to the folder Furniture and open the folder Kitchen 

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:21.580
 In order to pull objects into the apartment, it is best to take a look into the eaves 

00:05:21.579 --> 00:05:23.309
 switch 

00:05:23.309 --> 00:05:26.649
 For example, drag a beach into the kitchen 

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:31.469

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:35.319
 drag the object to the desired position 

00:05:36.039 --> 00:05:39.380

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:44.209
 gradually expand the kitchen in Aachen their taste 

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:47.860
 Now switch to textures 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.099
 and try the materials and colors of the kitchen to our liking 

00:05:52.099 --> 00:05:53.689
 change 

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:58.339
 Colors and textures are changed as already mentioned throughout the final sprint 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.949
 so through

 Plans to showcase apartments can wander through their planning 

00:06:14.229 --> 00:06:18.879
 In a 3d environment, hikers push for this takes the free ones 

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:24.739
 Mode the switch homes and pay attention to the mouse Eike Lenz this 

00:06:24.739 --> 00:06:25.879

 There is still much to discover 

00:06:54.509 --> 00:06:58.299
 Also keep a look in the included PDF handshake 

00:06:58.930 --> 00:07:02.050
