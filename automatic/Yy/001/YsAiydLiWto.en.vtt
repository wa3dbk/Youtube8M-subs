00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:20.490
 very good and welcome to another video of 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:24.029
 seen from the school of monza and online 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.470
 this is a puppy and it's here I saw her 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.990
 video helmet that you street is not 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.180
 hungry classist this is a sparrow a 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.040
 to be domestic that is called 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:35.290
 this one that I said has the black chest is a 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.630
 male the males have the black chest and 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.490
 in the head are the head have 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.650
 a grayish tone and the females are 

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:44.510
 completely brown with brown 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.090
 clarity makes me very excited because 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.830
 I put that feeder some time ago and it gave us 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.180
 many results in arriving now are 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.220
 coming to eat finally makes me a lot 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.140
 illusion a lot of illusion I do not care that 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.270
 be sparrows here there are also canaries 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.910
 of these Spanish stamps there are also 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.250
 goldfinches some capon nor have I seen a 

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:05.930
 nymph once we do normal 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:07.760
 native are the light sparrows 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:12.020
 and the canaries' stamped there are others 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.000
 little ones also called 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:16.009
 that are called because I do not remember but 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.390
 Well, there is not much 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:18.560
 say of the sparrows of this tradition 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.969
 I'm discovering a new world but 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.950
 I'm very excited to see why 

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:23.929
 Cometter understands with great enthusiasm and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.700
 I put it there and I had not seen it with him 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:28.610
 I had never even seen down 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.159
 at the level of the floors so we already have 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:33.439
 irrefutable evidence that they have a 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.369
 eat and I'm very excited I'm 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:39.350
 here so it means that there is habit because 

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:41.569
 I'm literally seven eight meters 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:42.740
 there are here from there and I do not want 

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:44.560
 scare them I want them to eat 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.970
 quietly because even if they are males 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.950
 they are still in the breeding season 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.929
 consumed and with your things so there 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.130
 to give them peace of mind that as in 

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:53.260
 he quietly eats everything is put 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:55.390
 there 

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.340
 the problem that I have scab and 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.700
 some birdseed in the 11 that are 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:59.700
 below and 

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.490
 if they have the pinche germinate in the bases 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.020
 fill me with grass and if they throw the 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.670
 husk as the dirty ones a bit all 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.040
 then that is there so that it 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:13.130
 get used and get familiar and then 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.270
 will be hung from the roof bars for 

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.550
 that is suspended in the air but 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.050
 first they have to get used to eating 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.390
 there so 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:23.670
 that with this beautiful image I love 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.140
 really because I really like the 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:28.020
 I really like birds 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.820
 but I do not like the classrooms then there 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:31.440
 the phrase of an anonymous that says yes 

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:34.020
 you want to hear the birds singing 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.210
 do not buy classrooms plant a tree here 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.280
 for trees there are very many what is 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.410
 I really do not like the classrooms 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.420
 then the way to enjoy 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.510
 the little birds put 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:47.370
 is this the healthiest way for everything 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:48.510
 the world and that's it is already wanted 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.980
 sharing it with you makes me a lot 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:51.209
 illusion here you see me I have a smile 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.099
 In the mouth of David, how handsome are you? 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.110
 I know I can not be so it's already 

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:56.849
 I want to enjoy that I hope you like it 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:03:00.740
 just as I like to me is a female not 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.470
 is a young male the chest 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.970
 in macho males, well, it's already 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:07.300
 is that I enjoy it and really that a 

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.480
 I love it if you do a little bit with 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:10.480
 the Sparrow 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.950
 Y
