00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:05.360
 we have come here to be able to perceive the progress in the works 

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.949
 of the construction of the stadium 

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:13.080
 national stadium that should be ready for next June quique by 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.630
 one hundred as we can see from this place is still 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:22.820
 p let's say the hand of the answering worker on the right side of the 

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.720
 national stadium that we can see from here we can see already 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.939
 let's see this cover that will cover the national stadium which area 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:34.050
 practice now very common to cover the outside first 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.530
 of the works for then it is to work the interior inside the stadium the 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.680
 court is already 100 ready list 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.000
 It is worth mentioning that this stadium used to have an artificial bleachers court 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.380
 of artificial turf and now has a court 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.770
 Thank you 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.890
 natural all-natural that has been the scene for several 

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.750
 months and several weeks ago 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.880
 and that's why now the stadium already has a grass court 

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:06.690
 totally natural from here then the progress of the works can be observed 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:12.520
 we are in what would be the eastern tribune is not in the part that we can 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:15.390
 see from here and the south grandstand that is also 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.270
 in this one for then we can see that the progress of the works is 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.050
 completely normal 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.950
 there is no 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.040
 let's say same act as the one that stands out at the moment about the construction 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.049
 of the national stadium during this week the president 

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:35.090
 of the Peruvian institute of sports arturo woodman kindle and 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.050
 was the person let's say the one who proposed the remodeling of the stadium 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.290
 national 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.240
 announced today that 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:48.980
 it's not going to be possible to play with a level team for the date of its 

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:51.220
 inauguration as I mention samuel 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.780
 the stadium to be inaugurated in the month of June 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.750
 incredible for a few weeks ago he had commented to the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:02.090
 possibility of bringing a selection of first level case like that of Spain that 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.650
 he is currently world champion in soccer works and then argentina non ti 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.159
 I love the two selections 

00:02:09.159 --> 00:02:13.209
 strongest of South America was also talked about the possibility of Barcelona 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:16.409
 and Real Madrid 2 of the most important clubs in the world 

00:02:17.029 --> 00:02:20.129
 but this week arturo guzmÃ¡n came out to deny this information 

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.579
 i to announce that the most likely is the most logical would be 

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:28.229
 that at the opening of the stadium he left 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:32.049
 like nobody that little local election a combined team 

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.860
 of Lima players with players from the interior 

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:37.709
 of the country in peace
