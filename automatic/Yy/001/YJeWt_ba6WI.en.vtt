00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
and we have considered many different

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.940 
and we have considered many different
options<00:02:11.640> of<00:02:12.300> what<00:02:12.840> we<00:02:12.989> can<00:02:13.260> include<00:02:13.680> in<00:02:13.830> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.420 
options of what we can include in the
game<00:02:14.160> but<00:02:15.200> at<00:02:16.200> this<00:02:16.590> time<00:02:16.650> we're<00:02:17.220> really

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
game but at this time we're really

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.170 
game but at this time we're really
unsure<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:18.270> what's<00:02:18.510> going<00:02:18.720> to<00:02:18.780> be<00:02:18.959> in<00:02:18.989> the<00:02:19.620> end

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180
