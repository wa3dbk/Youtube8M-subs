console<00:01:01.519> there<00:01:02.420> are<00:01:02.539> several<00:01:02.780> ways<00:01:03.109> to<00:01:03.170> open

that but I think by far the easiest way

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.010 
that but I think by far the easiest way
is<00:01:06.290> to<00:01:06.500> go<00:01:06.680> through<00:01:07.130> my<00:01:07.370> computer<00:01:08.000> or<00:01:08.360> if<00:01:08.870> you

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.440 
and will be again by the way but there
might<00:04:13.049> have<00:04:13.110> been<00:04:13.260> corrupt<00:04:13.860> files<00:04:14.220> or<00:04:14.610> a<00:04:14.640> virus

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:15.450 
might have been corrupt files or a virus

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:18.170 
might have been corrupt files or a virus
or<00:04:15.540> something<00:04:15.959> else<00:04:16.109> in<00:04:16.950> any<00:04:17.280> case<00:04:17.609> the

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:18.180 
or something else in any case the

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:19.849 
or something else in any case the
solution<00:04:18.690> here<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.230> shotgun<00:04:19.709> approach

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:19.859 
solution here is the shotgun approach

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:23.180 
solution here is the shotgun approach
get<00:04:20.820> rid<00:04:21.150> of<00:04:21.180> everything<00:04:21.690> the<00:04:22.620> plan<00:04:22.889> is<00:04:23.160> to

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
get rid of everything the plan is to

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.460 
get rid of everything the plan is to
delete<00:04:23.639> until<00:04:24.360> there's<00:04:24.570> nothing<00:04:24.750> left<00:04:24.990> to

delete until there's nothing left to

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:28.070 
delete until there's nothing left to
delete<00:04:25.830> and<00:04:26.150> the<00:04:27.150> way<00:04:27.300> to<00:04:27.360> do<00:04:27.630> that<00:04:27.810> is

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
delete and the way to do that is

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.860 
delete and the way to do that is
actually<00:04:28.740> very<00:04:28.770> simple<00:04:29.370> right<00:04:30.270> click<00:04:30.630> and

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
actually very simple right click and

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.200 
actually very simple right click and
look<00:04:31.380> in<00:04:31.560> the<00:04:31.650> context<00:04:32.190> menu<00:04:32.400> for<00:04:32.610> the<00:04:33.030> word

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:49.770 
remember the reason for this operation

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:52.100 
remember the reason for this operation
in<00:04:49.950> the<00:04:50.040> first<00:04:50.220> place<00:04:50.610> the<00:04:51.360> hard<00:04:51.570> drive<00:04:51.870> does

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:54.450 
not appear in my computer so it's

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:57.080 
not appear in my computer so it's
worthless<00:04:54.990> if<00:04:55.590> you<00:04:56.070> want<00:04:56.250> to<00:04:56.400> recover<00:04:56.760> lost
