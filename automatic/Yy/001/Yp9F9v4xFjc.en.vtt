there it is nice if you have someone to

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.290 
there it is nice if you have someone to
run<00:01:06.050> up<00:01:06.170> there<00:01:06.380> it<00:01:06.950> saves<00:01:07.280> little<00:01:07.670> time<00:01:07.909> the

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:08.300 
run up there it saves little time the

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.780 
run up there it saves little time the
way<00:01:08.420> I<00:01:08.450> do<00:01:08.570> it<00:01:08.720> anyway<00:01:08.960> that<00:01:09.409> you<00:01:09.440> just<00:01:09.890> it's

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:10.790 
way I do it anyway that you just it's

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.510 
way I do it anyway that you just it's
easier<00:01:11.270> in<00:01:11.420> my<00:01:11.450> opinion<00:01:11.600> so<00:01:12.500> this<00:01:13.190> is<00:01:13.220> what<00:01:13.490> I

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:13.520 
easier in my opinion so this is what I

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.240 
easier in my opinion so this is what I
do<00:01:13.640> first<00:01:14.180> thing<00:01:14.420> I<00:01:14.540> do<00:01:14.600> is<00:01:14.720> I<00:01:15.320> have<00:01:15.800> a<00:01:15.830> sniper

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
do first thing I do is I have a sniper

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.170 
do first thing I do is I have a sniper
rifle<00:01:16.400> that<00:01:16.940> is<00:01:17.270> getting<00:01:17.780> a<00:01:17.869> thousand<00:01:19.060> if<00:01:20.060> you

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
rifle that is getting a thousand if you

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.510 
rifle that is getting a thousand if you
don't<00:01:20.360> have<00:01:20.540> a<00:01:20.570> sniper<00:01:20.930> rifle<00:01:21.080> that<00:01:21.530> is<00:01:21.830> over<00:01:22.369> a

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:22.520 
don't have a sniper rifle that is over a

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.620 
don't have a sniper rifle that is over a
thousand<00:01:23.030> without<00:01:23.630> any<00:01:23.960> damage<00:01:24.229> or<00:01:24.590> whatever

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:25.630 
thousand without any damage or whatever

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.460 
thousand without any damage or whatever
probably<00:01:26.630> won't<00:01:26.690> be<00:01:26.840> able<00:01:26.869> to<00:01:27.050> do<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.409> in

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
probably won't be able to do this in

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.359 
probably won't be able to do this in
particular<00:01:28.190> which

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
particular which

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:34.440 
particular which
just<00:01:30.369> because<00:01:30.729> the<00:01:31.979> amount<00:01:32.979> of<00:01:33.220> burst<00:01:33.640> dps<00:01:33.909> you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
just because the amount of burst dps you

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:38.340 
just because the amount of burst dps you
need<00:01:34.720> at<00:01:35.200> the<00:01:35.380> end<00:01:36.119> it<00:01:37.119> will<00:01:37.270> take<00:01:37.540> a<00:01:37.570> while<00:01:37.840> and

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
need at the end it will take a while and

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.670 
need at the end it will take a while and
chances<00:01:39.009> are<00:01:39.310> you'll<00:01:39.580> probably<00:01:39.790> mess<00:01:40.030> up

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
chances are you'll probably mess up

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.899 
chances are you'll probably mess up
before<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.770> can<00:01:41.890> do<00:01:42.009> it<00:01:42.130> but<00:01:42.310> he'll<00:01:42.490> if<00:01:42.729> you

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
before you can do it but he'll if you

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.760 
before you can do it but he'll if you
can<00:01:43.060> do<00:01:43.180> with<00:01:43.330> a<00:01:43.420> rifle<00:01:43.630> go<00:01:43.930> for<00:01:44.229> it<00:01:44.320> here<00:01:44.530> I<00:01:44.560> get
