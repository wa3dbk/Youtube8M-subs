00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:18.099 
the previous tutorials this is a very

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.239 
the previous tutorials this is a very
simple<00:00:18.609> process<00:00:19.589> so<00:00:20.589> the<00:00:20.710> first<00:00:20.949> thing<00:00:21.009> we'll

00:00:21.239 --> 00:00:21.249 
simple process so the first thing we'll

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:26.310 
simple process so the first thing we'll
do<00:00:21.429> is<00:00:21.460> click<00:00:21.820> pc<00:00:22.329> and<00:00:23.249> here<00:00:24.249> we<00:00:24.400> can<00:00:24.579> have<00:00:25.320> here

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
do is click pc and here we can have here

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:30.359 
do is click pc and here we can have here
we<00:00:26.409> have<00:00:26.499> a<00:00:26.529> list<00:00:26.769> of<00:00:27.630> folders<00:00:28.949> which<00:00:29.949> we<00:00:30.189> can

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:30.369 
we have a list of folders which we can

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.910 
we have a list of folders which we can
select<00:00:30.819> as<00:00:31.779> a<00:00:32.410> destination<00:00:33.180> folder<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.829> our

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:35.920 
select as a destination folder for our

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:47.350 
select as a destination folder for our
music

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:47.360 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.819 

once<00:00:48.050> we<00:00:48.230> do<00:00:48.350> that<00:00:48.580> just<00:00:49.580> go<00:00:49.730> into<00:00:50.000> that<00:00:50.150> folder

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
once we do that just go into that folder

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:55.750 
once we do that just go into that folder
and<00:00:52.280> now<00:00:52.519> we<00:00:52.850> see<00:00:52.879> here<00:00:53.420> that<00:00:53.449> pc<00:00:53.989> tracks<00:00:54.519> in<00:00:55.519> my

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:55.760 
and now we see here that pc tracks in my

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.860 
and now we see here that pc tracks in my
music<00:00:56.179> folder<00:00:56.390> is<00:00:56.870> where<00:00:57.129> the<00:00:58.129> destination

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:58.870 
music folder is where the destination

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.189 
music folder is where the destination
source<00:00:59.870> tracks<00:01:00.079> are<00:01:00.229> going<00:01:00.379> to<00:01:00.440> be<00:01:00.500> copied<00:01:00.800> to

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
source tracks are going to be copied to

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:07.510 
source tracks are going to be copied to
so<00:01:03.199> what<00:01:03.979> we'll<00:01:04.129> do<00:01:04.280> here<00:01:04.899> is<00:01:06.159> what<00:01:07.159> I<00:01:07.189> want<00:01:07.430> to

folder and in place the tracks within

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:15.730 
folder and in place the tracks within
there<00:01:13.700> and<00:01:14.479> we<00:01:14.600> do<00:01:14.720> this<00:01:14.930> by<00:01:15.170> selecting<00:01:15.200> the

there and we do this by selecting the
output<00:01:16.100> format<00:01:17.439> so<00:01:18.439> these<00:01:18.710> percent<00:01:19.490> a<00:01:19.700> %<00:01:20.240> b<00:01:20.420> %<00:01:20.869> e

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:21.140 
output format so these percent a % b % e

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.580 
output format so these percent a % b % e
and<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.189> other<00:01:22.310> percents<00:01:22.759> will<00:01:23.119> represent

and no conversion

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:22.710 
and no conversion
it's<00:04:20.380> going<00:04:20.560> to<00:04:20.590> be<00:04:20.739> a<00:04:20.769> straightforward<00:04:21.720> copy
