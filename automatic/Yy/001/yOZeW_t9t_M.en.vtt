a<00:00:23.249> lot<00:00:23.429> of<00:00:23.699> times<00:00:23.909> there<00:00:24.089> is<00:00:24.119> water<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.480> I

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:24.599 
a lot of times there is water that I

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.599 
a lot of times there is water that I
could<00:00:24.810> get<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.199> that<00:00:25.470> easily<00:00:25.800> and<00:00:26.419> I<00:00:28.159> do<00:00:29.159> have

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
could get to that easily and I do have

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.030 
could get to that easily and I do have
to<00:00:29.640> rappel<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> little<00:00:30.300> bit<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:31.289> I'm<00:00:31.800> just

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040 
to rappel a little bit and I'm just

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.580 
to rappel a little bit and I'm just
using<00:00:32.220> this<00:00:32.540> wall<00:00:33.540> here<00:00:33.930> as<00:00:34.110> an<00:00:34.230> extreme

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
using this wall here as an extreme

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.099 
using this wall here as an extreme
example<00:00:35.180> normally<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> would<00:00:36.480> never<00:00:36.690> have<00:00:36.960> to

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
example normally I would never have to

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.459 
example normally I would never have to
rappel<00:00:37.620> off<00:00:37.649> of<00:00:37.949> something<00:00:38.100> this<00:00:38.340> steep<00:00:39.469> but

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
rappel off of something this steep but

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:43.099 
rappel off of something this steep but
you<00:00:40.649> can<00:00:40.800> see<00:00:41.269> you<00:00:42.269> can<00:00:42.480> control<00:00:42.809> your<00:00:42.989> descent

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109

you can see you can control your descent
very<00:00:43.649> easily<00:00:45.649> it's<00:00:46.649> not<00:00:46.829> very<00:00:47.070> comfortable

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:50.030 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:53.209 

it's<00:00:51.030> definitely<00:00:51.480> not<00:00:51.539> comfortable<00:00:52.129> but<00:00:53.129> you

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219

can do it and it's lightweight I want to
show<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.440> some<00:00:58.589> other<00:00:58.679> ways<00:00:58.890> you're

light weight repelling system that is

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.450 
light weight repelling system that is
great<00:01:06.330> for<00:01:06.510> backpacking<00:01:06.690> if<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.920> have<00:01:08.130> water

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
that's hard reach and back pegye trips

so I would definitely suggest a rivers

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.790 
so I would definitely suggest a rivers
belt<00:02:18.000> or<00:02:18.780> some<00:02:18.990> sort<00:02:19.170> of<00:02:19.230> climate<00:02:19.470> harness

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
belt or some sort of climate harness

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:25.590 
belt or some sort of climate harness
over<00:02:20.010> this

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:25.600 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.540 

so<00:02:26.600> I<00:02:26.660> showed<00:02:26.870> you<00:02:26.990> one<00:02:27.200> way<00:02:27.350> out<00:02:27.560> of<00:02:27.650> it<00:02:27.740> I<00:02:27.950> show

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550 
so I showed you one way out of it I show

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:31.960 
so I showed you one way out of it I show
you<00:02:28.580> how<00:02:28.700> I<00:02:28.730> get<00:02:28.880> down<00:02:28.940> and<00:02:30.460> that<00:02:31.460> was<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:31.610> visit

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
you how I get down and that was a visit

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:33.340 
you how I get down and that was a visit
an<00:02:32.060> extreme<00:02:32.330> example<00:02:32.720> usually<00:02:32.840> the<00:02:33.110> slopes

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
an extreme example usually the slopes

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.060 
an extreme example usually the slopes
not<00:02:33.530> that<00:02:33.680> steep<00:02:33.890> you<00:02:34.100> that's<00:02:34.310> more<00:02:34.430> like<00:02:34.580> this

00:03:38.390 --> 00:03:38.400 
so I split up next to that one that way
