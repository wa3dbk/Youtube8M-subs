as a base because you maybe already have
some<00:01:35.040> of<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.189> parts<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.580> need<00:01:35.760> to<00:01:35.850> put

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
some of the parts that you need to put

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:37.580 
some of the parts that you need to put
this<00:01:36.119> thing<00:01:36.270> together<00:01:36.450> then<00:01:37.020> you<00:01:37.140> can<00:01:37.320> build

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
this thing together then you can build

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.130 
this thing together then you can build
on<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.130> from<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.700> because<00:01:39.630> of<00:01:39.750> course<00:01:39.930> with

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
on it from there because of course with

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.810 
on it from there because of course with
the<00:01:40.260> chassis<00:01:40.650> setup<00:01:40.799> itself<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.369> can<00:01:41.400> add

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:41.820 
the chassis setup itself you can add

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:43.609 
the chassis setup itself you can add
different<00:01:42.420> links<00:01:42.810> later<00:01:42.960> you<00:01:43.200> can<00:01:43.409> add

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
different links later you can add

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:45.410 
different links later you can add
different<00:01:44.070> axles<00:01:44.610> later<00:01:44.790> but<00:01:44.970> at<00:01:45.060> least<00:01:45.210> you

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
different axles later but at least you

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.240 
different axles later but at least you
have<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.840> you<00:01:45.930> need<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.200> start<00:01:46.500> to<00:01:46.950> help<00:01:47.159> you

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
have what you need to start to help you

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:49.039 
have what you need to start to help you
get<00:01:47.400> into<00:01:47.549> a<00:01:47.700> great<00:01:48.119> quality<00:01:48.360> chassis<00:01:48.750> look

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
get into a great quality chassis look

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.230 
get into a great quality chassis look
with<00:01:49.200> GCM<00:01:49.500> makes<00:01:49.830> now<00:01:50.460> if<00:01:50.610> you<00:01:50.700> take<00:01:50.880> a<00:01:50.909> look<00:01:51.000> at

devil recon to still be viable trucks so
it<00:02:41.579> will<00:02:41.790> take<00:02:42.000> me<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> little<00:02:42.329> bit<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.659> get<00:02:42.750> the

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
it will take me a little bit to get the

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.869 
it will take me a little bit to get the
GCM<00:02:43.260> chassis<00:02:43.650> built<00:02:43.829> but<00:02:44.189> believe<00:02:44.519> me<00:02:44.549> it's

00:02:44.869 --> 00:02:44.879 
GCM chassis built but believe me it's

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:46.849 
GCM chassis built but believe me it's
going<00:02:44.970> to<00:02:45.060> be<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.209> phenomenal<00:02:45.480> truck<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.409> the

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
going to be a phenomenal truck of the

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.679 
going to be a phenomenal truck of the
highest<00:02:47.219> quality<00:02:47.370> because<00:02:47.849> it<00:02:47.969> is<00:02:48.090> using<00:02:48.359> GCM

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
highest quality because it is using GCM

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.179 
highest quality because it is using GCM
parts<00:02:49.079> and<00:02:49.260> of<00:02:49.590> course<00:02:49.769> it's<00:02:49.920> going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.099> be

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
parts and of course it's going to be

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.860
