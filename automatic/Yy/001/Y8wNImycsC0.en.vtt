against the countertop

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.819 
against the countertop
it's<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.059> countertop<00:00:48.510> around<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.410> moldings

it's a countertop around the moldings
there<00:00:50.070> just<00:00:50.370> because<00:00:50.610> it's<00:00:50.760> flexible<00:00:51.300> the

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
there just because it's flexible the

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.420 
there just because it's flexible the
grout<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.989> dry<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.289> crack<00:00:52.680> oh<00:00:52.920> I<00:00:52.949> see<00:00:53.219> so<00:00:53.340> we

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430 
grout will dry and crack oh I see so we

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.340 
grout will dry and crack oh I see so we
don't<00:00:53.579> don't<00:00:54.030> put<00:00:54.239> grout<00:00:54.420> along<00:00:54.989> any<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.289> those

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
well next move I guess is to mix the

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.580 
well next move I guess is to mix the
grout<00:01:06.360> up<00:01:06.479> right<00:01:06.689> yeah<00:01:06.869> let's<00:01:07.200> go<00:01:07.320> do<00:01:07.409> that

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
grout up right yeah let's go do that

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.219 
grout up right yeah let's go do that
all<00:01:07.710> right<00:01:08.010> so<00:01:08.909> Cory<00:01:09.360> what's<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.659> secret<00:01:09.990> to

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
all right so Cory what's the secret to

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:11.899 
all right so Cory what's the secret to
mixing<00:01:10.530> grout<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.189> just<00:01:11.369> want<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:11.549> use<00:01:11.670> water

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
mixing grout you just want to use water

you<00:01:12.299> want<00:01:12.360> to<00:01:12.450> mix<00:01:12.600> it<00:01:12.750> slow<00:01:12.990> try<00:01:13.619> to<00:01:13.710> keep<00:01:13.890> the

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
you want to mix it slow try to keep the

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.710 
you want to mix it slow try to keep the
mess<00:01:14.159> down<00:01:14.400> dump<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.030> powder<00:01:15.180> in<00:01:15.479> there<00:01:15.600> the

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
mess down dump the powder in there the

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.840 
mess down dump the powder in there the
grout<00:01:15.900> mix<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.860> just<00:01:17.009> a<00:01:17.100> little<00:01:17.189> bit<00:01:17.340> maybe<00:01:17.670> add

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
grout mix it just a little bit maybe add

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.880 
grout mix it just a little bit maybe add
a<00:01:17.880> little<00:01:18.090> bit<00:01:18.270> more<00:01:18.299> water<00:01:18.659> as<00:01:19.020> we<00:01:19.350> go<00:01:19.530> we

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
a little bit more water as we go we

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.950 
a little bit more water as we go we
don't<00:01:20.070> want<00:01:20.220> it<00:01:20.310> too<00:01:20.580> wet<00:01:20.610> we<00:01:21.150> want<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.509> kind<00:01:21.900> of

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
don't want it too wet we want it kind of

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.420 
don't want it too wet we want it kind of
like<00:01:22.110> peanut<00:01:22.530> butter<00:01:22.710> it's<00:01:22.890> probably<00:01:23.189> a<00:01:23.250> good

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
like peanut butter it's probably a good

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.749 
like peanut butter it's probably a good
idea<00:01:25.280> when<00:01:26.280> it's<00:01:26.430> ready

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
idea when it's ready

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.370 
idea when it's ready
Cory<00:01:27.210> shows<00:01:27.479> me<00:01:27.689> his<00:01:27.780> technique<00:01:28.200> for

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
Cory shows me his technique for

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.590 
Cory shows me his technique for
installing<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.979> grout<00:01:29.250> first<00:01:30.060> he<00:01:30.180> grabs<00:01:30.450> a

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
installing the grout first he grabs a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.910 
installing the grout first he grabs a
little<00:01:30.810> bit<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:30.990> grout<00:01:31.170> with<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:31.409> float<00:01:31.740> and

little bit of grout with this float and

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.770 
little bit of grout with this float and
then<00:01:32.400> smears<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.939> grout<00:01:33.180> into<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.600> void

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
then smears the grout into the void

okay<00:02:13.670> this<00:02:13.820> part<00:02:14.060> gets<00:02:14.210> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.540> tedious

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
okay this part gets a little tedious

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.810 
okay this part gets a little tedious
you'll<00:02:15.500> need<00:02:15.680> to<00:02:15.800> change<00:02:16.010> the<00:02:16.280> water<00:02:16.490> often

you'll need to change the water often

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:18.670 
you'll need to change the water often
since<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.660> dirty<00:02:17.900> water<00:02:18.170> will<00:02:18.410> leave<00:02:18.590> behind

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
since the dirty water will leave behind

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
leaking out of the sponge as you work

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.670 
leaking out of the sponge as you work
it's<00:02:25.040> too<00:02:25.550> wet<00:02:25.960> after<00:02:26.960> the<00:02:27.080> grout<00:02:27.230> is<00:02:27.410> set<00:02:27.560> up
