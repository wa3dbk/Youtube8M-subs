00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.650
 Hello everyone with you lumberjack and this review 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.620
 mods 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:34.380
 Today we will review the mod which 

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.840
 forever change your ideas 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:42.900
 and in the caves in minecraft so today 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:47.090
 Today our mod was called caves 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:50.100
 which means wild caves 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.510
 This mod adds this 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.510
 a small number of blocks 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:58.370
 which will be generated along with 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.370
 world generation cave 

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.580
 let's go out of creativity we will break everything 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:09.920
 these blocks start with that block and than 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:13.900
 a pawn file seems to fall out of it 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:19.630
 cobblestone skull skeletons also bones and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:19.630
 sometimes arrows now you'll see it all 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:27.620
 here are his friend 's reds 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:31.130
 next we go icicles here about him 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:34.320
 green blocks drop from them 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.170
 further we go mushrooms stronger 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.479
 and green mushrooms 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.650
 caves they shine on as now 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.650
 day it would not 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:48.840
 how of them comes across so on with us 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:51.610
 go sandy 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.950
 stalactites and stalagmites 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.950
 promises fall out of them sometimes 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.950
 and then we go ordinary stalactites and 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.780
 stalagmites 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.090
 they differ from sandy ones only 

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.270
 the texture of them has a normal 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.270
 cobblestone 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:13.200
 we also have the identity now 

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:17.380
 from the caves and see what of the days 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:19.960
 changed water found more or less 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.000
 normal cave and how to look 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.550
 changes 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.530
 capital caves now we will 

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:33.690
 often generated creepers spider webs also 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.690
 where are our stalactites and stalagmites 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.180
 buy 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:43.970
 here they are also on a gray background 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:45.900
 may not be very visible here again 

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.560
 Amen 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:52.890
 the torch is also sometimes in caves you can 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:54.960
 meet the generated skeleton skull 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:58.260
 and 

00:02:54.960 --> 00:03:00.930
 and there is such a bug when generating that they 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:03.990
 in the caves are generated right on each 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.530
 I had this step on one of 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:06.530
 servers 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:14.450
 so as you see here are our glowing mushrooms 

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:16.580
 green 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:17.500
 also now quite often possible 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.010
 meet 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:24.430
 ice caves since 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:28.980
 fashion developer he decided to bring closer 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:31.409
 reality all this fashion 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:33.690
 its all my colors of reality and how you 

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:36.720
 you know in ordinary caves in real 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.010
 life they are deep and very cold in them 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.409
 and too much ice 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:43.140
 so hatch minecraft will now be in 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.950
 many ice caves 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.710
 but he would have concealed a little and therefore 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.080
 where are we here 7 

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:54.340
 mushrooms 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.340
 here are the icicles 

00:03:56.210 --> 00:04:00.270
 yes that 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.569
 what are you 

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:06.870
 we have nothing further 

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:08.939
 let's go here too when we 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.849
 go through pays and we stalagmites 

00:04:08.939 --> 00:04:15.109
 slow down a bit like when 

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.109
 pass through get 

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.280
 here is our god file 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.099
 here is the glowing green grass 

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.099
 but the skull 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:31.570
 doc 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:39.110
 here the cave is not ending okay 

00:04:35.959 --> 00:04:43.249
 principle based on setting mond you can 

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:48.529
 see for yourself what's interesting here 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:52.429
 and now I'll show you a sand cave 

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:55.129
 see sand beads like you probably 

00:04:52.429 --> 00:04:57.500
 understand they are most often generated from 

00:04:55.129 --> 00:05:00.230
 deserts 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.220
 here are our sandy lines you are stalagmites 

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.210
 also there are the usual guide this loop i 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:10.970
 lit up a little and already 

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:16.760
 already bows to the share of us below there is no 

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:20.710
 there is nothing so let's explore a little 

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.710
 then he is interesting to us 

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:26.430
 sand sandstone 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:34.310
 sand of sandstone web again 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:43.510
 I think 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.510
 here 's the most love me do 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:51.229
 Well, in principle, this mode will exhaust itself 

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:54.350
 now and talk about the minuses and small 

00:05:51.229 --> 00:05:59.320
 shortcomings the main disadvantage is 

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.320
 that this mod is relative 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:05.880
 it forces the processor to load as 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:07.850
 does not change the generation of the world and when generating 

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:12.960
 the world you may have varnishes 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:17.699
 There are also bugs with the lighting of these 

00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:22.190
 mushrooms and the last tank is 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:24.840
 that sometimes u can sometimes have skulls 

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:27.030
 generated in the world right on every 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.830
 step 

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.849
 that's basically on it 

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:34.279
 review completed 

00:06:31.849 --> 00:06:36.979
 Thank you all for watching with you 

00:06:34.279 --> 00:06:41.529
 woodcutter subscribe put huskies 

00:06:36.979 --> 00:06:41.529
 all until we meet again
