00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:39.050
 and today we are going to do we are going to demonstrate 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:43.460
 the two basic things of building your 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:46.510
 chronicle the calculation stem and the monkey or 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:46.510
 the fake cast 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.399
 Thank you 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.769
 the stolen invoice an essential movement 

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:56.600
 for crops the falls we use 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.070
 in a diagonal way so 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 distribute the force of the impact 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:02.610
 around the body 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.159
 Now I'm going to show you the shot 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.899
 Parkour 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:08.509
 As a first step we are going to double the 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.060
 Knee going to look for our 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:12.469
 hand in front of where we have our feet ok 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.979
 once we put our hands we are going to 

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:17.240
 bend the elbows holding the fall 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:21.100
 then we are going to look for the torso's anger 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:23.900
 putting the shoulder and looking to stop it 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.130
 by the rows together 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:27.860
 we need to be in a position 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.100
 grouped once we're rolling to 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:34.300
 so the strength of the rotation helps us 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.850
 get up in a more effective way 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.620
 progressions for rolling invoices 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.440
 the first progression is to start from 

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:45.790
 zero dayz ok to put the hands of the 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.840
 same way as we explain and push ourselves 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:53.720
 from here the second progression we are going to 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.180
 start by pulling out one knee and leaving 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.120
 just one foot ok in the same way we 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.560
 we push with the back leg 

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:06.830
 flexed we are all stopping 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:08.030
 third progression ok with the knees 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.130
 bent 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.440
 both feet the joints we put our hands 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:17.690
 in the front we select and we stop 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.490
 fourth progression and last from above 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.460
 stopped ok 

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.030
 we started bending knee flexed and 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:26.400
 we stop 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.050
 the school for the progressions the 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.270
 hip has to pass over the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:32.370
 head and not on the side so that 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.920
 wheel will be totally diagonal but 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.480
 totally on the side the roadside procure a 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.920
 movement that not just for 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.110
 sport but that can help us 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.110
 also for many occasions 

00:02:50.690 --> 00:03:02.099
 is one of the most famous and most famous companies 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:03:04.910
 used in the calculation and study to 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.670
 this important skill 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.180
 that we lean towards the object once 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.200
 we see towards the object not very close to the 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:18.770
 ok little bit further we're going to look for the 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:22.700
 repulsion a reject a push with the 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:25.100
 shoulders ok I do not know looking to push 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.990
 all the body to the front not 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.380
 we spend only one part of the body 

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.790
 but passing the whole body in one 

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.670
 piece is when we are doing the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.040
 mobile we have to raise our hips to 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.660
 so we can move forward if not 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:41.150
 we raise the hips it may be that the 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.980
 feet are caught where in the 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.590
 obstacle that we are going through if it is well 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.660
 important that the face go up ok 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.460
 above the head or at least 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.310
 goes up the obstacle that we are 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:56.230
 surpassing so once we focus 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.230
 the pits we pass more easily 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.610
 progressions for the progression module 

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.890
 wall we will seek to do the same 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:06.800
 steps in poster of before and what we are going 

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:09.560
 to do is only climb one foot up 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:12.140
 where we have our hands in between 

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.340
 hands we will look for the foot 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:17.959
 in this way ok we stop if we want 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:21.440
 the valve I repeat 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.669
 hands and one foot ok 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.039
 we are for progression two 

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:28.819
 progression two let's do the same 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:32.000
 looking to put both feet on hands 

00:04:28.819 --> 00:04:33.789
 and we can look for a jump to take 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:37.160
 the fluidity of moving forward 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:40.099
 three progression instead of putting the feet 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.380
 here we are going to look for the impulse and look 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:46.220
 the feet in front in this way 

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:48.409
 we put our hands we push and we look 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:50.209
 a fall 

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:52.489
 very important with the issues has been in 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:04:55.699
 boxes is to divide the obstacle into three 

00:04:52.489 --> 00:04:57.229
 parts number one the first edge is not 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:58.729
 best place with hands here few and 

00:04:57.229 --> 00:05:01.819
 we would not have to do more strength to 

00:04:58.729 --> 00:05:04.759
 surpass all the obstacle part 2 

00:05:01.819 --> 00:05:07.789
 the other edge not very good to put your hand 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.229
 here because with just the little 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.939
 strength that we do we can leave 

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:12.939
 front and not have a good fall 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:25.940
 recapitulating remember that the first 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.370
 stands are not very good to put 

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.690
 hands since they do not help us look 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:32.990
 better quality so 

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:35.390
 preferably we search the center for 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:39.910
 the brother in the center to thus have 

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:39.910
 a good fall and a good 

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.490
 we go
