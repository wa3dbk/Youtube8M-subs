only requires a moderate amount of

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.410 
only requires a moderate amount of
soldering<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.340> you<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.579> easily<00:00:59.940> build<00:01:00.090> it<00:01:00.270> in

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
soldering so you can easily build it in
