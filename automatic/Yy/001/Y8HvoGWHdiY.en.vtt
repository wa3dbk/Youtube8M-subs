00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:54.630 

you

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:54.640 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.430 

so<00:00:55.640> let's<00:00:55.850> start<00:00:56.150> with<00:00:56.420> understeer<00:00:57.170> or<00:00:57.380> a

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:57.440 
so let's start with understeer or a

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.740 
so let's start with understeer or a
front-end<00:00:58.100> skid<00:00:58.430> I'm<00:00:59.000> going<00:00:59.180> to<00:00:59.239> go<00:00:59.300> on<00:00:59.390> onto

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
front-end skid I'm going to go on onto

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.990 
front-end skid I'm going to go on onto
the<00:00:59.870> skin<00:01:00.140> area<00:01:00.440> now<00:01:00.620> and<00:01:00.890> go<00:01:01.400> into<00:01:01.520> the<00:01:01.700> corner

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
the skin area now and go into the corner

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.780 
the skin area now and go into the corner
a<00:01:02.030> little<00:01:02.090> bit<00:01:02.330> too<00:01:02.480> fast<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.699> set<00:01:04.699> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
a little bit too fast and set the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.820 
a little bit too fast and set the
front-end<00:01:05.180> slide<00:01:05.510> let's<00:01:06.050> just<00:01:06.229> see<00:01:06.380> see<00:01:06.680> what

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
front-end slide let's just see see what

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.160 
front-end slide let's just see see what
happens<00:01:07.220> so<00:01:08.000> we're<00:01:08.390> building<00:01:08.479> up<00:01:08.690> our<00:01:08.840> speed

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
happens so we're building up our speed

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.469 
happens so we're building up our speed
now<00:01:09.410> coming<00:01:09.979> into<00:01:10.190> the<00:01:10.340> corner<00:01:10.700> it's<00:01:11.210> quite

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
now coming into the corner it's quite

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.630 
now coming into the corner it's quite
slippery<00:01:11.780> we're<00:01:12.380> turning<00:01:12.710> in<00:01:12.860> the<00:01:13.190> front<00:01:13.490> and

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
slippery we're turning in the front and

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.150 
slippery we're turning in the front and
sliding<00:01:14.119> and<00:01:14.270> the<00:01:14.330> car<00:01:14.570> is<00:01:15.110> going<00:01:15.350> straight<00:01:15.979> on

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
sliding and the car is going straight on

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.760 
sliding and the car is going straight on
off<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.430> road<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.570> as<00:01:18.170> you<00:01:18.290> can<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:18.590> by

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
off the road so as you can see by

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:20.290 
off the road so as you can see by
entering<00:01:19.100> a<00:01:19.160> corner<00:01:19.340> a<00:01:19.490> little<00:01:19.700> bit<00:01:19.790> too<00:01:19.970> fast

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:20.300 
entering a corner a little bit too fast

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:22.840 
entering a corner a little bit too fast
putting<00:01:21.200> on<00:01:21.290> steering<00:01:21.680> lock<00:01:21.979> the<00:01:22.490> front<00:01:22.759> of

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
putting on steering lock the front of

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.450 
putting on steering lock the front of
the<00:01:22.910> car<00:01:23.090> can<00:01:23.240> begin<00:01:23.509> to<00:01:23.660> slide<00:01:23.899> so<00:01:24.500> how<00:01:25.160> can<00:01:25.220> we

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460 
the car can begin to slide so how can we

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.430 
the car can begin to slide so how can we
control<00:01:25.850> that<00:01:26.090> what<00:01:26.330> can<00:01:26.509> we<00:01:26.600> do<00:01:26.810> to<00:01:27.020> bring<00:01:27.200> the

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440 
control that what can we do to bring the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.830 
control that what can we do to bring the
vehicle<00:01:27.619> back<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:28.130> control<00:01:28.600> there<00:01:29.600> are<00:01:29.630> two

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
vehicle back in control there are two

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.660 
vehicle back in control there are two
factors<00:01:30.320> that<00:01:30.410> take<00:01:30.770> into<00:01:30.979> consideration

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
factors that take into consideration

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.580 
factors that take into consideration
steering<00:01:32.360> and<00:01:32.570> weight<00:01:32.960> distribution

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:33.590 
steering and weight distribution

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.219 
steering and weight distribution
don't<00:01:34.399> overdo<00:01:34.670> this<00:01:34.970> steering<00:01:35.390> the<00:01:36.020> main

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
don't overdo this steering the main

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.230 
don't overdo this steering the main
thing<00:01:36.500> with<00:01:36.619> steering<00:01:36.979> is<00:01:37.310> keep<00:01:37.670> it<00:01:37.820> pointed

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
thing with steering is keep it pointed

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:39.609 
thing with steering is keep it pointed
in<00:01:38.360> the<00:01:38.450> direction<00:01:38.479> that<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.110> want<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.440> go

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
in the direction that you want to go

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.710 
in the direction that you want to go
that<00:01:40.040> way<00:01:40.100> you're<00:01:40.790> getting<00:01:40.910> the<00:01:41.090> maximum<00:01:41.270> out

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:41.720 
that way you're getting the maximum out

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.450 
that way you're getting the maximum out
of<00:01:41.750> the<00:01:41.930> tires<00:01:42.170> and<00:01:42.530> when<00:01:42.770> it<00:01:42.890> does<00:01:43.040> get<00:01:43.190> grip

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
of the tires and when it does get grip

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.510 
of the tires and when it does get grip
it<00:01:43.850> will<00:01:44.030> go<00:01:44.210> in<00:01:44.420> a<00:01:44.690> safe<00:01:44.960> direction<00:01:45.560> weight

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:46.520 
it will go in a safe direction weight

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.790 
it will go in a safe direction weight
distribution<00:01:47.240> is<00:01:47.360> a<00:01:47.570> different<00:01:48.050> thing<00:01:48.229> to

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
distribution is a different thing to

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.680 
distribution is a different thing to
alter<00:01:49.190> the<00:01:49.280> weight<00:01:49.430> distribution<00:01:49.640> you<00:01:50.479> need

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
alter the weight distribution you need

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.109 
alter the weight distribution you need
to<00:01:50.840> alter<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.320> throttle<00:01:51.710> position<00:01:52.119> easing

00:01:53.109 --> 00:01:53.119 
to alter the throttle position easing

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:54.910 
to alter the throttle position easing
off<00:01:53.240> the<00:01:53.390> throttle<00:01:53.570> puts<00:01:54.200> more<00:01:54.409> weight<00:01:54.619> on<00:01:54.650> the

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:54.920 
off the throttle puts more weight on the

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.520 
off the throttle puts more weight on the
tires<00:01:55.159> because<00:01:55.880> he<00:01:56.060> tires<00:01:56.360> they<00:01:56.930> work<00:01:57.140> exactly

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.530 
tires because he tires they work exactly

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.590 
tires because he tires they work exactly
the<00:01:57.710> same<00:01:57.799> way<00:01:57.979> as<00:01:58.250> your<00:01:58.340> shoes<00:01:58.610> do<00:01:58.850> the<00:01:59.299> moment

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
the same way as your shoes do the moment

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.480 
the same way as your shoes do the moment
weight<00:01:59.780> you<00:02:00.049> can<00:02:00.229> put<00:02:00.380> on<00:02:00.500> the<00:02:00.590> tire<00:02:00.799> the<00:02:01.310> more

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:01.490 
weight you can put on the tire the more

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.090 
weight you can put on the tire the more
grip<00:02:01.760> that<00:02:01.970> tire<00:02:02.240> will<00:02:02.479> have<00:02:02.720> so<00:02:03.170> easing<00:02:03.979> off

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:04.100 
grip that tire will have so easing off

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.219 
grip that tire will have so easing off

direction you want to go will help you
again<00:02:08.630> control<00:02:09.049> of<00:02:09.260> a<00:02:09.410> front<00:02:09.649> end<00:02:09.830> skid<00:02:10.180> let's

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:11.180 
again control of a front end skid let's

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.449 
again control of a front end skid let's
try<00:02:11.480> it<00:02:11.540> again<00:02:11.660> this<00:02:11.930> time<00:02:11.989> same<00:02:12.709> situation

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459 
try it again this time same situation

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
car too hard in a corner particularly if

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.080 
car too hard in a corner particularly if
you<00:02:48.560> use<00:02:48.650> too<00:02:48.799> much<00:02:48.829> throttle<00:02:49.220> you'll<00:02:49.790> get<00:02:50.000> the

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
you use too much throttle you'll get the

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.360 
you use too much throttle you'll get the
car<00:02:50.269> going<00:02:50.480> sideways<00:02:50.810> or<00:02:51.230> into<00:02:51.530> a<00:02:51.560> spin<00:02:51.980> so

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
car going sideways or into a spin so

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:53.500 
car going sideways or into a spin so
let's<00:02:52.549> just<00:02:52.700> have<00:02:52.820> a<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.000> look<00:02:53.120> at<00:02:53.299> that

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:53.510 
let's just have a little look at that

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.210 
let's just have a little look at that
we're<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.140> to<00:02:54.200> drive<00:02:54.440> into<00:02:54.680> the<00:02:54.769> corner<00:02:55.100> now

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
we're going to drive into the corner now

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.069 
we're going to drive into the corner now
it's<00:02:55.519> a<00:02:55.579> wet<00:02:55.790> surface<00:02:56.060> I'm<00:02:56.660> going<00:02:56.840> to<00:02:56.930> use<00:02:57.049> a

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:57.079 
it's a wet surface I'm going to use a

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:59.590 
it's a wet surface I'm going to use a
little<00:02:57.350> bit<00:02:57.530> too<00:02:57.680> much<00:02:57.829> throttle

00:02:59.590 --> 00:02:59.600 
little bit too much throttle

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.810 
little bit too much throttle
immediately<00:03:00.600> got<00:03:00.780> into<00:03:01.490> quite<00:03:02.490> a<00:03:02.520> violent

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:02.820 
immediately got into quite a violent

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:05.240 
immediately got into quite a violent
spin<00:03:03.450> so<00:03:03.960> even<00:03:04.320> though<00:03:04.410> the<00:03:04.530> cows<00:03:04.710> are<00:03:04.890> fun<00:03:05.070> to

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
spin so even though the cows are fun to

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.280 
spin so even though the cows are fun to
drive<00:03:05.430> if<00:03:05.730> you<00:03:05.850> get<00:03:06.060> it<00:03:06.210> wrong<00:03:06.450> it<00:03:06.840> can<00:03:07.140> be<00:03:07.170> a

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
drive if you get it wrong it can be a

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.530 
drive if you get it wrong it can be a
real<00:03:07.530> problem<00:03:07.800> so<00:03:08.130> let's<00:03:09.000> have<00:03:09.120> a<00:03:09.180> little<00:03:09.300> look

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
real problem so let's have a little look

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.560 
real problem so let's have a little look
at<00:03:09.630> how<00:03:09.780> we<00:03:09.840> can<00:03:10.050> actually<00:03:10.200> control<00:03:10.530> that<00:03:10.920> and

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:11.570 
at how we can actually control that and

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:13.820 
at how we can actually control that and
instead<00:03:12.570> of<00:03:12.690> spinning<00:03:13.170> around<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.680> leaving

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.830 
instead of spinning around and leaving

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:15.860 
instead of spinning around and leaving
the<00:03:14.040> road<00:03:14.220> how<00:03:14.610> we<00:03:14.670> can<00:03:14.910> actually<00:03:15.060> stay<00:03:15.840> in

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
the road how we can actually stay in

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.840 
the road how we can actually stay in
control<00:03:16.470> them<00:03:16.650> and<00:03:16.800> drift<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.430> around<00:03:17.700> the

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
control them and drift it around the

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:19.910 
control them and drift it around the
corner<00:03:18.240> and<00:03:18.870> it's<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.170> it's<00:03:19.470> something<00:03:19.800> that

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
corner and it's a it's something that

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.830 
corner and it's a it's something that
takes<00:03:20.100> a<00:03:20.250> little<00:03:20.370> bit<00:03:20.490> of<00:03:20.550> practice<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.300> it

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
takes a little bit of practice but it

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.050 
takes a little bit of practice but it
can<00:03:22.050> be<00:03:22.230> done<00:03:22.380> if<00:03:23.100> I<00:03:23.220> go<00:03:23.400> through<00:03:23.640> the<00:03:23.760> same

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
can be done if I go through the same

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.540 
can be done if I go through the same
bend<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.960> time<00:03:25.230> use<00:03:25.500> a<00:03:25.710> little<00:03:26.220> bit<00:03:26.340> less

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
bend but this time use a little bit less

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.490 
bend but this time use a little bit less
throttle<00:03:26.820> and<00:03:27.150> a<00:03:27.570> little<00:03:27.870> bit<00:03:27.960> of<00:03:28.050> corrective

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
throttle and a little bit of corrective

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.570 
throttle and a little bit of corrective
steering<00:03:30.290> you<00:03:31.290> can<00:03:31.440> see<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.770> then<00:03:31.980> I<00:03:32.220> can

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
steering you can see that then I can

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:34.400 
steering you can see that then I can
control<00:03:32.940> the<00:03:33.120> car<00:03:33.330> so<00:03:33.720> it's<00:03:33.870> a<00:03:33.930> balance

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 
control the car so it's a balance

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:36.820 
control the car so it's a balance
between<00:03:34.470> not<00:03:35.250> using<00:03:35.640> too<00:03:35.790> much<00:03:35.970> power<00:03:36.270> and

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:36.830 
between not using too much power and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:38.870 
between not using too much power and
correcting<00:03:37.830> with<00:03:37.950> the<00:03:38.040> steering<00:03:38.280> keeping<00:03:38.760> the

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
correcting with the steering keeping the

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.850 
correcting with the steering keeping the
steering<00:03:39.330> pointing<00:03:39.840> in<00:03:39.990> the<00:03:40.290> direction<00:03:40.320> that

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:40.860 
steering pointing in the direction that

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:42.560 
steering pointing in the direction that
we<00:03:40.980> want<00:03:41.220> the<00:03:41.340> car<00:03:41.520> to<00:03:41.550> go<00:03:41.850> and<00:03:42.090> then<00:03:42.330> we<00:03:42.420> can

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
we want the car to go and then we can

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:44.210 
we want the car to go and then we can
just<00:03:42.720> drift<00:03:43.140> it<00:03:43.290> around<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.680> corner<00:03:44.070> as

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
just drift it around the corner as

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:50.000 
just drift it around the corner as
easily<00:03:44.700> as<00:03:45.060> that<00:03:48.440> so<00:03:49.440> we've<00:03:49.560> been<00:03:49.680> looking<00:03:49.800> at

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
easily as that so we've been looking at

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.500 
easily as that so we've been looking at
controlling<00:03:50.400> skids<00:03:50.820> in<00:03:51.000> a<00:03:51.150> rear-wheel<00:03:51.480> drive
