00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
a result from this comes good knowledge

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.699 
a result from this comes good knowledge
for<00:01:34.550> a<00:01:34.970> second<00:01:35.270> right<00:01:35.500> yeah<00:01:36.500> I<00:01:36.530> think

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:36.709 
for a second right yeah I think

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:37.839 
for a second right yeah I think
especially<00:01:36.860> with<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.220> size<00:01:37.399> of<00:01:37.580> the<00:01:37.670> French

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:37.849 
especially with the size of the French

00:01:37.849 --> 00:01:38.979 
especially with the size of the French
Packers<00:01:38.209> laughing<00:01:38.509> they've<00:01:38.599> got<00:01:38.690> some<00:01:38.869> big

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:38.989 
Packers laughing they've got some big

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:40.839 
Packers laughing they've got some big
men<00:01:39.170> in<00:01:39.289> there<00:01:39.470> so<00:01:40.039> if<00:01:40.130> we<00:01:40.250> let<00:01:40.369> them<00:01:40.489> take<00:01:40.729> down

00:01:40.839 --> 00:01:40.849 
men in there so if we let them take down

00:01:40.849 --> 00:01:42.880 
men in there so if we let them take down
the<00:01:40.940> size<00:01:41.330> of<00:01:41.420> the<00:01:41.509> gap<00:01:41.690> and<00:01:41.899> get<00:01:42.020> hits<00:01:42.470> on<00:01:42.619> us<00:01:42.739> I

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:42.890 
the size of the gap and get hits on us I

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.930 
the size of the gap and get hits on us I
think<00:01:42.979> we're<00:01:43.130> gonna<00:01:43.250> be<00:01:43.399> in<00:01:43.700> for<00:01:43.819> a<00:01:43.849> long
