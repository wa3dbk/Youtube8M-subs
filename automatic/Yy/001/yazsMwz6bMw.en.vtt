things moving that was kind of the
moment<00:02:40.019> where<00:02:40.200> I<00:02:40.230> realized<00:02:40.500> that<00:02:40.920> I<00:02:40.950> had

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
moment where I realized that I had

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.890 
moment where I realized that I had
something<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:41.670> contribute<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.540> so<00:02:42.630> I<00:02:42.660> made

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
something to contribute and so I made

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.360 
something to contribute and so I made
that<00:02:43.019> first<00:02:43.260> video<00:02:43.410> and<00:02:43.680> I<00:02:43.800> jumped<00:02:44.069> out<00:02:44.190> of<00:02:44.220> the
