00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:20.040
 recipe i will be told colored children to 

00:00:17.189 --> 00:00:22.320
 Soon the summer is just around the corner 

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.079
 think figs were go on easy 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:27.689
 food but low-calorie recipes can 

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:30.080
 to be not only useful and light but also 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:32.820
 tastes and today we have for dessert 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.430
 crispy oatmeal on the road 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:38.940
 pillows with strawberries and for that to us 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.620
 will need from the pasty gate here 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.739
 I like this one most 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:47.210
 In principle you can select any that 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:50.909
 It is such a soft kefir 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.930
 oatmeal is the largest size and 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.360
 strawberry 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.699
 well, and also olive oil a little bit for 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.100
 fry our flakes so they 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.750
 turned out crispy 

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 we wait until will understand our pan 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:10.890
 I also see one tablespoon there 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:16.500
 olive oil by about eye too 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:18.719
 I measured 30 grams will need more 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.420
 forgot to say about the most important 

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:23.909
 ingredient for me a principle for that 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.249
 to the top ten sweet this is this style 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:30.420
 and which I use almost everywhere 

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:32.640
 instead of sugar in not 0 calories in general, two 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:35.369
 tens of all calories and carbohydrates of proteins and 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.440
 fat and therefore hands sugar note 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.840
 so i don't 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:43.510
 There is use boldly in all their 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:52.160
 the desserts were just warming up 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:55.790
 pan pour there fucked and not at 

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.430
 we have to fry a little 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:02.260
 important when roasting course constantly 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:02.260
 interfere otherwise cannot burn 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.480
 we will make our most tender curd 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:27.160
 pad 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.480
 cottage cheese ruble whichever 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:35.640
 how much do you like to eat a lot 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.640
 about 50 grams it will turn out 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:59.170
 kefir acacia left so that 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:06.459
 The consistence such as how turned out 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:08.760
 sour cream and mix all good 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:12.220
 a variety of straight to fully 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:16.230
 then this cottage cheese dissolved 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:16.230
 it will be so empty 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:35.290
 when oatmeal will start to pass 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:37.989
 emit everything will start to smell good here 

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.010
 it means it's time to stir them 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.959
 if included because after a few 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:50.590
 literally seconds will not be bad 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:53.549
 smell so i turn on the same and let 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.549
 they dry up 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:12.519
 here we add a bed here with me 

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:14.790
 coefficient Vlad 125 that is she 

00:04:12.519 --> 00:04:17.669
 pretty sweet therefore missing 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:20.910
 for sweets like this on the tip of a knife 

00:04:17.669 --> 00:04:20.910
 principle enough 

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:29.590
 they are good too 

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:37.620
 shuffle not yet and the mixture was like 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:40.620
 melted important that all cook 

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:40.620
