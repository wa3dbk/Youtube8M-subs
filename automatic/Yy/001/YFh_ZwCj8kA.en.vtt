00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.490
 How many gamers are we in white box and 

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:06.490
 let's play chess 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.920
 as you have seen in this point of the map 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.510
 we have here a gentleman to play the 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.240
 last moves of chess and I'm going to 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.640
 teach how to do it with three stars 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.610
 the first phase we go is pretty 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:31.130
 we have to catch the queen and 

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:33.790
 by putting us by his side we will leave you 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.790
 cornered 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:43.200
 in the second what we are going to do 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.040
 is to move our bishop 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:51.080
 to place it here, it does not have 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.080
 possible movement 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:01:00.600
 in the third we are going to catch the queen 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.220
 let's eat your pawn and let him 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.170
 equally cornered because if you eat 

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.260
 the queen we use our horse 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.180
 Lord check lover 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.120
 here we have to use already from 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.280
 now two plays the first the first 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:17.560
 movement would be the queen move it a 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.560
 little by his side he is going to move 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:22.010
 and it was before the horse protecting us 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:25.060
 that's why the queen has not eaten and now 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.060
 the horse when putting it here 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.310
 Well, what do we say checkmate 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:38.590
 in the fifth we're going to do that other 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.530
 Once with the queen, we will place them in 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.240
 this box here 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.830
 will not have any choice but to move 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.110
 because if we do not eat it with the 

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.030
 horse and now again again the 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.150
 horse is the one that returns to check 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.150
 mate 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.780
 the sixth move what we are going to do is 

00:01:57.079 --> 00:02:02.420
 catch the queen walk us all the 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.979
 board but not until the end we 're going 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:05.929
 to stay there threatening him because if not 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:09.140
 we eat the tower we can in the last 

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:11.810
 we move the queen again and place it 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.459
 a little here and not even with its towers 

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.180
 we can not defend anything with anything 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:17.900
 cornered 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.900
 starts 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.450
 in the seventh we have here the two 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.370
 Towers I think this is the easiest 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:26.439
 of all we moved away a little bit that yes 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.409
 because if we do it forward it 

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:31.540
 is going to zoom in and now to two lanes 

00:02:29.409 --> 00:02:34.130
 come on there is no possible way out so now 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.460
 you see checkmate 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:41.220
 is ready if in the eighth 

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:45.230
 let's catch the queen 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.230
 to move it to the end 

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.370
 now we just take off this pawn 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:52.520
 of the middle and we are again in check 

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.520
 mate 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.910
 well done 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:08.320
 in 9 we're going to catch another one of the queen 

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.850
 to place it in front of us we see daughter that 

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.730
 is going to put the queen to protect him but 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.170
 simply by eating the queen no longer 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.190
 we leave it option because if it does not 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.190
 we would eat with the tower 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.880
 and finally we are going to move our 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.890
 Queen 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:31.870
 exactly this box here that 

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:34.570
 you see to the right of the king trying 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:37.270
 protect yourself but equally when we 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.790
 let's eat that bishop since we have there 

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:40.709
 cornered 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:44.099
 but now it has helped you we have done 

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:45.930
 the 10 levels there is what it means 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:48.120
 that we unlock an ability 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.859
 special that improves our 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.019
 concentration you see here already gives me the 

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:54.120
 notice what you will see in the menu right away 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:56.099
 that we have chess here 10 out of 10 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:59.780
 and the maximum conjuration 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:59.780
 see you in future videos see you later
