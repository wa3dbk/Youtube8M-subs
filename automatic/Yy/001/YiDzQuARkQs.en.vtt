00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:33.570

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:36.949
 cream is this beautifully colored 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.230
 it's a tone came off with a lot of 

00:00:36.949 --> 00:00:42.210
 flashes in the same tone 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.910
 I have a review of the four shades 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:47.130
 of chanel in cream that I have in the 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.140

 with the eyes tutorial and ended there the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:05.700
 bid to contour I've used the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.050
 palette of street la face formed in the 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.890
 medium tone 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:14.280
 and I liked it 

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.560
 the dark tone to make the outline and 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.780
 the illuminator is the one used 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.070
 also the rouge not as blusher 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:25.700
 also used one of schlink's 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:29.090
 is the rose goal that they say is a clone 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.220
 of the organ is tenacious and this one if 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:35.130
 I open today 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:39.429
 this pretty color is a tone 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:43.780
 pink but toast tossing the coral 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:47.710
 with gold sparkles very beautiful the 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:50.829
 it is really beautiful this this blusher and 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.649
 Well, on the lips, I used a 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:57.929
 profiler as always this from cuatris 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:02:00.929
 It is long lasting waterproof in tone 0 

00:01:57.929 --> 00:02:00.929
 80 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:11.649
 rosadito and like lipstick used this 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:11.649
 stage line palette 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:20.000
 this is the color that I have put 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:20.000
 what is 09 if I'm not wrong 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.350
 lips I have wanted to make more 

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:27.730
 soft because the eyes are already quite 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.370
 loader I put false eyelashes 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.980
 but good is an option as always 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:36.640
 you can adapt it all 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.440
 look to your tastes and nothing else 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.580
 I leave you watching the tutorial and I hope that 

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:42.820
 I like you 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:46.740
 we started by putting a prebase both in 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:49.110
 the upper eyelid as in the lower 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.790
 I use the clearest shadow of this trio 

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:56.010
 of English with a brush to blur 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:59.310
 planito between the 27 of zoÃ© goes for 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.260
 mark the entire basin I start from the 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.710
 end of the eye to leave there is greater 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.830
 amount of shadow plus concentration of 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:09.830
 color and I'm going up the entire account 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:15.470
 I'm blurring upwards at the same time 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:15.470
 what am I applying 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.750
 I also put it on the bottom boat 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.380
 with a brush with a rounded tip this 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.960
 is 231 of this eva I'm going to take a 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:34.110
 shadow color matte wine and I keep marking 

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:36.760
 the basin the same I start from the 

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:39.130
 end of the eye 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.770
 going up 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:43.990
 this time I will not raise it as much as 

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:46.680
 Like the other one I'm going to leave in the 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:46.680
 crease is worth 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:57.640
 we add color until we find the 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.640
 intensity that we seek 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:02.410
 always matching with the other eye what 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:05.200
 It is better to go by doing both to the 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:09.030
 in this way we will do the same 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:13.340
 better now we blur the cut a little 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:13.340
 with the first brush that we use 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:27.020
 now with a pencil type brush and a 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:27.020
 matte black shadow let's mark the ub 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.669
 we started 

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:39.560
 we make like a kind of gravel 

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:43.629
 we took it out a little 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.460
 and join with the bank 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:57.290
 and we blend a little bit in 

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:03.410
 and now we take the redondito brush that 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:06.730
 we use to put the wine tone to 

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.730
 blur that black 

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.050
 for the mobile eyelid I will use 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:24.200
 this shadow of chanel is a shadow in 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:26.930
 cream in this tone it came so beautiful with 

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.830
 a synthetic hair brush 

00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:35.350
 this is the 227 new and touches what 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.350
 We are applying on all the eyelid mobile 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:42.630
 we are blurring with the rest of 

00:05:38.890 --> 00:05:42.630
 shadows that we had already put 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:53.969
 Now with the same shadow and a brush 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:57.080
 synthetic hair flat I will mark the 

00:05:53.969 --> 00:05:57.080
 lower lashes 

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:09.410
 with the pencil type brush marked the end 

00:06:05.610 --> 00:06:09.410
 of lashes with black shadow 

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:18.120
 with a matte beige shadows we illuminate 

00:06:14.069 --> 00:06:21.499
 the arch of the eyebrow and we blend with the 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:21.499
 shadows that we have below 

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:29.410
 to finish with the shadows I use 

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:32.050
 is in a satin beige tone with a 

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:35.009
 beveled brush to put a point of 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.009
 light in the lacrimal 

00:06:38.930 --> 00:06:43.449
 these are the products that I'm going to 

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:43.449
 use to delineate 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:08.390
 the black pencil inside the eye both in 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:11.390
 the lower eyelid as the upper 

00:07:08.390 --> 00:07:14.030
 We use lashes we apply mask 

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:16.720
 eyelashes to taste ended up putting some 

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:16.720
 false eyelashes 

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:25.949
 Rest the delineated and it would be 

00:07:23.379 --> 00:07:25.949
 finished
