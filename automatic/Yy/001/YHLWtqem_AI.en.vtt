now<00:00:15.750> that<00:00:15.929> we<00:00:16.020> have<00:00:16.170> a<00:00:16.340> assembled<00:00:17.630> coilover

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:18.949 
now that we have a assembled coilover

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:21.349 
now that we have a assembled coilover
we're<00:00:19.949> going<00:00:20.100> to<00:00:20.189> talk<00:00:20.340> about<00:00:20.490> how<00:00:20.730> to<00:00:20.789> lower<00:00:21.029> a

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
we're going to talk about how to lower a

we're going to talk about how to lower a
car<00:00:21.689> on<00:00:21.840> this<00:00:22.340> they're<00:00:23.340> very<00:00:23.369> much<00:00:23.970> the<00:00:24.150> same

process to selecting a right height as

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.870 
process to selecting a right height as
you<00:00:27.060> would<00:00:27.240> with<00:00:27.449> pro<00:00:27.750> s<00:00:28.279> with<00:00:29.279> two<00:00:29.519> unique

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
consumer this is stuff that you would

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.610 
consumer this is stuff that you would
really<00:00:43.079> not<00:00:43.350> find<00:00:43.739> on<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.730> normal<00:00:45.059> car<00:00:45.300> or

00:00:49.869 --> 00:00:49.879 
even a car loaded with that point apart

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:52.700 
even a car loaded with that point apart
you<00:00:50.879> have<00:00:51.090> the<00:00:51.239> ability<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> preload<00:00:52.379> this

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
you have the ability to preload this

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.380 
you have the ability to preload this
spring<00:00:53.539> this<00:00:54.539> is<00:00:54.780> of<00:00:54.899> course<00:00:55.020> lowering<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> but

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
spring this is of course lowering it but

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.299 
spring this is of course lowering it but
once<00:00:57.390> you<00:00:57.510> actually<00:00:57.719> start<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.379> take<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
once you actually start to take the

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.080 
once you actually start to take the
spanner<00:00:59.969> or<00:01:00.329> this<00:01:00.690> perch<00:01:01.079> and<00:01:01.469> move<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.489> upward

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
spanner or this perch and move it upward

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.910 
spanner or this perch and move it upward
you're<00:01:03.420> actually<00:01:03.870> compressing<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.650> spring

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
you're actually compressing the spring

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.100 
you're actually compressing the spring
that<00:01:05.220> means<00:01:05.460> that<00:01:05.700> you're<00:01:05.820> putting<00:01:06.390> force<00:01:06.869> on

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
that means that you're putting force on

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.020 
that means that you're putting force on
the<00:01:07.229> spring<00:01:07.350> before<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.130> vehicles<00:01:08.580> ever<00:01:08.760> even

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
the spring before the vehicles ever even

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.109 
the spring before the vehicles ever even
put<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.330> the<00:01:09.420> ground<00:01:10.040> we<00:01:11.040> all<00:01:11.070> know<00:01:11.340> that<00:01:11.520> once

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
put on the ground we all know that once

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.210 
put on the ground we all know that once
you<00:01:12.240> lower<00:01:12.930> a<00:01:13.049> car<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.710> a<00:01:13.770> certain<00:01:14.070> amount

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
you lower a car there's a certain amount

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.760 
you lower a car there's a certain amount
of<00:01:14.369> sag<00:01:14.640> or<00:01:15.000> through<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:16.350> spring<00:01:16.650> will

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
of sag or through the spring will

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.219 
of sag or through the spring will
compress<00:01:17.100> itself<00:01:17.580> to<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:17.850> certain<00:01:18.030> point<00:01:18.390> you

00:01:19.219 --> 00:01:19.229 
compress itself to a certain point you

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:20.840 
compress itself to a certain point you
can<00:01:19.409> do<00:01:19.619> that<00:01:19.799> before<00:01:19.920> you<00:01:20.159> ever<00:01:20.280> put<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> car

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
can do that before you ever put the car

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.300 
can do that before you ever put the car
on<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.000> ground<00:01:21.060> most<00:01:21.930> people<00:01:22.650> I<00:01:22.920> would<00:01:23.070> just

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
on the ground most people I would just

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.760 
on the ground most people I would just
simply<00:01:23.490> suggest<00:01:24.090> that<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:25.170> take<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> lot<00:01:25.740> of

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
simply suggest that you take a lot of

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.620 
simply suggest that you take a lot of
the<00:01:25.890> free<00:01:26.159> player<00:01:26.490> slack<00:01:26.970> out<00:01:27.240> of<00:01:27.299> the<00:01:27.420> lower

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
the free player slack out of the lower

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.690 
the free player slack out of the lower
perch<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.290> the<00:01:28.530> spring<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:30.079> hard<00:01:31.079> to<00:01:31.380> move<00:01:31.700> but

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
perch so the spring is hard to move but

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.090 
perch so the spring is hard to move but
not<00:01:32.909> impossible<00:01:33.180> to<00:01:33.630> move<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.140> that<00:01:34.350> tells<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
not impossible to move so that tells you

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.550 
not impossible to move so that tells you
that<00:01:35.280> this<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:36.360> point<00:01:36.659> at<00:01:36.810> this<00:01:36.960> point<00:01:37.290> all

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
that this this point at this point all

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.140 
that this this point at this point all
the<00:01:37.770> slack<00:01:38.009> is<00:01:38.159> taking<00:01:38.460> up<00:01:38.579> the<00:01:38.700> spring<00:01:39.000> is

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:39.150 
the slack is taking up the spring is

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.050 
the slack is taking up the spring is
under<00:01:39.390> somewhat<00:01:39.840> some<00:01:40.110> load<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:41.280> then<00:01:41.549> you<00:01:41.700> go

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
under somewhat some load and then you go

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.090 
under somewhat some load and then you go
ahead<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.360> spin<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.930> jam<00:01:43.200> nut<00:01:43.439> up<00:01:43.619> towards

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
ahead and spin the jam nut up towards

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.950 
ahead and spin the jam nut up towards
the<00:01:44.340> lower<00:01:44.579> perch<00:01:44.939> there

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:46.960 
the lower perch there

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.230 
the lower perch there
you<00:01:47.740> take<00:01:47.920> the<00:01:48.040> two<00:01:48.190> wrenches<00:01:48.460> that<00:01:48.940> are

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
you take the two wrenches that are

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.120 
you take the two wrenches that are
included<00:01:49.600> and<00:01:50.049> you<00:01:50.290> basically<00:01:50.470> tighten<00:01:51.040> them

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.130 
included and you basically tighten them

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:55.200 
included and you basically tighten them
into<00:01:51.369> each<00:01:51.490> other<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:53.560> is<00:01:53.970> taking<00:01:54.970> care<00:01:55.150> of

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
into each other this is taking care of

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.830 
into each other this is taking care of
spring<00:01:56.080> portion<00:01:56.700> now<00:01:57.700> to<00:01:57.760> adjust<00:01:58.119> ride<00:01:58.600> height

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
spring portion now to adjust ride height

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.660 
spring portion now to adjust ride height
you<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.140> it<00:01:59.260> entirely<00:01:59.560> different<00:02:00.130> from<00:02:00.369> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
you do it entirely different from the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.740 
you do it entirely different from the
pro<00:02:00.880> s<00:02:01.060> counterpart<00:02:01.630> you<00:02:02.380> know<00:02:02.440> the<00:02:02.710> pro<00:02:02.950> s<00:02:03.750> you

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:04.750 
pro s counterpart you know the pro s you

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:07.590 
pro s counterpart you know the pro s you
again<00:02:05.380> have<00:02:05.619> to<00:02:06.060> play<00:02:07.060> with<00:02:07.210> the<00:02:07.300> springs

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600 
again have to play with the springs

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.740 
again have to play with the springs
position<00:02:08.229> which<00:02:08.830> ultimately<00:02:09.429> plays<00:02:09.759> with<00:02:10.209> the

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
position which ultimately plays with the

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.850 
position which ultimately plays with the
amount<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.350> travel<00:02:12.069> you<00:02:12.100> have<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.810> pro<00:02:14.050> C<00:02:14.380> on

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
amount of travel you have the pro C on

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.370 
amount of travel you have the pro C on
the<00:02:15.100> other<00:02:15.220> hand<00:02:15.510> this<00:02:16.510> is<00:02:16.720> all<00:02:16.900> a<00:02:16.930> fixed

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:17.380 
the other hand this is all a fixed

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.530 
the other hand this is all a fixed
position<00:02:17.640> you<00:02:18.640> don't<00:02:18.760> have<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.180> worry<00:02:19.420> about

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:15.800 
what I've measured on my car I don't

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:17.830 
what I've measured on my car I don't
drive<00:03:15.980> my<00:03:16.190> car<00:03:16.370> this<00:03:16.490> way<00:03:16.730> I<00:03:16.970> didn't<00:03:17.510> even<00:03:17.570> turn

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:17.840 
drive my car this way I didn't even turn

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:20.140 
drive my car this way I didn't even turn
but<00:03:18.200> it<00:03:19.040> does<00:03:19.250> go<00:03:19.430> to<00:03:19.490> show<00:03:19.610> that<00:03:19.880> the

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
but it does go to show that the

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.770 
but it does go to show that the
flexibility<00:03:21.110> of<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.380> shock<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.770> there<00:03:22.600> so<00:03:23.600> now

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
flexibility of the shock is there so now

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.300 
flexibility of the shock is there so now
you're<00:03:23.960> able<00:03:24.110> to<00:03:24.260> raise<00:03:24.620> and<00:03:24.890> lower<00:03:24.920> your<00:03:25.100> car
