for<00:00:03.570> the<00:00:03.750> para<00:00:03.989> Rita<00:00:04.319> a<00:00:04.650> classic<00:00:05.220> Spanish

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
for the para Rita a classic Spanish

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:07.190 
for the para Rita a classic Spanish
model<00:00:05.729> we<00:00:06.060> need<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.270> square<00:00:06.569> sheet<00:00:06.689> of<00:00:06.930> paper

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:07.200 
model we need a square sheet of paper

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.930 
model we need a square sheet of paper
begins<00:00:08.010> by<00:00:08.370> calling<00:00:08.940> a<00:00:09.059> sangamore<00:00:09.660> and

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:10.940 
begins by calling a sangamore and

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.169 
begins by calling a sangamore and
unfolding<00:00:11.940> it<00:00:12.089> again<00:00:12.919> and<00:00:13.919> we<00:00:14.549> repeat<00:00:14.969> the

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
unfolding it again and we repeat the

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.350 
unfolding it again and we repeat the
same<00:00:15.210> thing<00:00:15.890> the<00:00:16.890> other<00:00:16.920> way<00:00:17.100> around<00:00:17.580> and<00:00:17.820> we

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:18.360 
same thing the other way around and we

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:23.960 
same thing the other way around and we
will<00:00:18.420> begin<00:00:18.690> form<00:00:20.270> windmill<00:00:21.270> base<00:00:22.340> so<00:00:23.340> after

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:23.970 
will begin form windmill base so after

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.860 
will begin form windmill base so after
we<00:00:24.150> fold<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.690> diagonally<00:00:24.840> and<00:00:26.180> did<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.420> white

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:27.870 
we fold it diagonally and did the white

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:35.060 
we fold it diagonally and did the white
precisely<00:00:30.740> we<00:00:31.740> begin<00:00:32.719> with<00:00:33.719> folding<00:00:34.320> every

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
precisely we begin with folding every

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.860 
precisely we begin with folding every
corner<00:00:35.489> to<00:00:35.789> the<00:00:35.940> center<00:00:37.129> like<00:00:38.129> so<00:00:38.510> our<00:00:39.510> bird

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
corner to the center like so our bird

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.239 
corner to the center like so our bird
will<00:00:40.170> have<00:00:40.620> a<00:00:40.649> blue<00:00:41.219> body<00:00:41.489> and<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.879> white<00:00:42.089> hat<00:00:42.390> so

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:43.249 
will have a blue body and a white hat so

00:00:43.249 --> 00:00:46.970 
will have a blue body and a white hat so
watch<00:00:44.249> out<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:45.019> the<00:00:46.019> position<00:00:46.499> of<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.620> paper

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
watch out for the position of the paper

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:58.000 
watch out for the position of the paper
if<00:00:47.579> you<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.999> to<00:00:48.480> be<00:00:48.890> your<00:00:50.059> model<00:00:51.089> dual<00:00:51.480> color

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.180 

there<00:00:59.010> is<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.490> last<00:00:59.790> corner<00:01:00.300> and<00:01:00.920> now<00:01:01.920> we'll

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
there is a last corner and now we'll

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.330 
there is a last corner and now we'll
just<00:01:02.490> unfold<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.390> whole<00:01:03.420> thing<00:01:03.840> again<00:01:04.340> turn

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:05.340 
just unfold the whole thing again turn

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:09.140 
just unfold the whole thing again turn
the<00:01:05.489> sheet<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:05.940> now<00:01:06.300> we'll<00:01:06.960> fall<00:01:07.770> from<00:01:08.160> here

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the sheet and now we'll fall from here

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.230 
the sheet and now we'll fall from here
to<00:01:09.630> here<00:01:09.840> so<00:01:10.170> just<00:01:11.840> make<00:01:12.840> a<00:01:12.870> fold<00:01:13.350> from<00:01:14.240> one

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
to here so just make a fold from one

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
to here so just make a fold from one
diagonal<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.140> other<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.920> don't<00:01:17.130> need<00:01:17.370> two

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
diagonal to the other you don't need two

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:21.200 
diagonal to the other you don't need two
creases<00:01:17.910> entirely<00:01:18.600> if<00:01:19.020> you<00:01:19.200> do<00:01:19.440> it's<00:01:20.010> not<00:01:20.400> bad

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
creases entirely if you do it's not bad

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:35.469 
creases entirely if you do it's not bad
but<00:01:21.510> it's<00:01:21.690> simply<00:01:22.080> not<00:01:22.110> necessary

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:40.070 

the<00:01:36.479> last<00:01:36.690> one<00:01:38.180> now<00:01:39.180> comes<00:01:39.479> the<00:01:39.690> tricky<00:01:39.869> part

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:40.080 
the last one now comes the tricky part

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.810 
the last one now comes the tricky part
we'll<00:01:40.979> need<00:01:41.340> to<00:01:42.619> fold<00:01:43.619> like<00:01:43.950> so<00:01:44.010> picture<00:01:44.580> says

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
we'll need to fold like so picture says

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.080 
we'll need to fold like so picture says
but<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.810> make<00:01:45.960> it<00:01:46.050> easier<00:01:46.380> we<00:01:46.619> love<00:01:46.800> first

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
but to make it easier we love first

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:55.450 
but to make it easier we love first
crease<00:01:49.520> the<00:01:50.520> corners<00:01:51.060> just<00:01:53.300> make<00:01:54.300> a<00:01:54.630> simple

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
crease the corners just make a simple

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:05.230 
crease the corners just make a simple
valley-fold<00:01:57.979> in<00:01:58.979> each<00:01:59.190> corner<00:02:02.360> by<00:02:03.360> so<00:02:04.259> C

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
valley-fold in each corner by so C

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:11.059 
valley-fold in each corner by so C
crease<00:02:06.240> nice<00:02:06.960> and<00:02:07.200> sharp

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.140 

and<00:02:11.519> we're<00:02:11.849> done<00:02:11.969> now<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.599> can<00:02:13.340> just<00:02:14.340> pull

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
and we're done now you can just pull

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.330 
and we're done now you can just pull
them<00:02:15.420> to<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.140> center<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.680> you<00:02:16.799> get<00:02:16.980> this

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
them to the center and you get this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.170 
them to the center and you get this
shape<00:02:17.810> will<00:02:18.810> fall<00:02:19.109> to<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.709> four<00:02:20.069> flaps<00:02:20.370> in<00:02:20.849> one

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
shape will fall to the four flaps in one

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:27.229 
shape will fall to the four flaps in one
direction<00:02:21.329> and<00:02:22.640> fold<00:02:24.769> those<00:02:25.769> two<00:02:26.069> flaps<00:02:26.459> onto

00:02:27.229 --> 00:02:27.239 
direction and fold those two flaps onto

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:29.119 
direction and fold those two flaps onto
each<00:02:27.689> other<00:02:27.840> so<00:02:28.230> folding<00:02:28.650> the<00:02:28.739> model<00:02:29.010> in<00:02:29.099> half

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:29.129 
each other so folding the model in half

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:33.830 
each other so folding the model in half
we<00:02:30.060> get<00:02:30.269> that<00:02:30.599> new<00:02:31.590> shape<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.840> outside

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
we get that new shape and outside

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.170 
we get that new shape and outside
reverse-fold<00:02:34.379> the<00:02:36.260> cops<00:02:37.260> one<00:02:37.530> and<00:02:37.939> that<00:02:38.939> will

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
reverse-fold the cops one and that will

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.259 
reverse-fold the cops one and that will
be<00:02:39.359> our<00:02:39.569> hat<00:02:40.189> and<00:02:41.189> if<00:02:41.310> you<00:02:41.459> done<00:02:41.609> that<00:02:41.790> we'll

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
be our hat and if you done that we'll

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:47.059 
be our hat and if you done that we'll
just<00:02:42.599> flatten<00:02:43.200> it<00:02:44.000> there<00:02:45.000> we<00:02:45.120> go<00:02:45.329> our<00:02:46.260> power

00:02:47.059 --> 00:02:47.069 
just flatten it there we go our power

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.859 
just flatten it there we go our power
