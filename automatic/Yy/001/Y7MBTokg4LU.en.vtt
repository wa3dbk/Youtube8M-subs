00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:14.549
 good afternoon today we will consider 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.070
 clinical example of afferent syndrome 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.470
 motor aphasia 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.270
 referent motor aphasia due to 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.240
 local cerebral dysfunction 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.869
 blood circulation in the motor sections 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.869
 clinical cortex 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.790
 manifestations of the syndrome are expressed 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.320
 perseveration 

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.550
 involuntary repetition of words and syllables 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.290
 speech is scanned 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.590
 trim mechanism on motor aphasia 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.780
 is a violation of the kinetic motor 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.879
 programs 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.180
 Consider the patient a syndrome 

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:54.260
 efferent motor aphasia in a patient 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.579
 according to computed tomography 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.079
 determined cerebral disorder 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.870
 blood circulation 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.439
 anterior branch of the left middle cerebral 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:05.720
 arteries clinical picture given speech 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:09.470
 about violation 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.470
 as follows 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:21.780
 or honor from your youth ahead take care 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:31.640
 with hunger and that was so was frolov 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:39.980
 Roll Frol Frol on laurel more nor more 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:39.980
 of honor the hole again scam lied 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.369
 so the patient has a major 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:49.369
 speech disturbance speaking difficulty 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:53.000
 switch from single articulation 

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:55.759
 act to another when repeated occurs 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.689
 perseveration involuntary repetitions of words 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.780
 and syllables 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.969
 to overcome the kinetic disturbances 

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:05.240
 motor program with a moderate degree 

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:08.929
 severity of speech therapy practice 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.349
 quite often offer a direct path 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:13.420
 recovery namely word making 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.430
 and syllables 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.410
 consider an example of doing this 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.410
 type of job sick 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:30.140
 Lily 

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:40.880
 so wicket it is long 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:40.880
 tasks on sick you at all 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:49.830
 oh-oh-oh-oh 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.239
 similar tasks at the initial stage 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:53.370
 recovery 

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:54.299
 causes a pronounced patient 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:56.569
 difficulties 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.849
 the dynamics is observed 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:02.640
 insignificant therefore along with 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:06.060
 in the traditional way of recovery we 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:07.730
 offered the patient a translation of the text from 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.069
 vertical direction 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.440
 horizontal target of the given task 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:16.040
 kinetic motor restoration 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:19.470
 programs we will consider an example of performance 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:23.120
 this type of assignment is sick on 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:23.120
 initial stage of rehabilitation 

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.920
 Oleg has been writing for a long time 

00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:05.170
 to the door 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:19.509
 further we carried out rehabilitation 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.509
 the patient and the subsequent direction 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.759
 restoration of translation 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.100
 text from vertical direction 

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:31.310
 horizontal bridging front 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.520
 grammatism by writing prepositions 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:38.300
 and endings restore meaning 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.830
 structure words conjugate and reflected 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:43.759
 pronouncing difficult speech 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:46.250
 designs work on the deployed 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.080
 oral speech as a result 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:51.759
 restorative and speech therapy 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:55.900
 occupations at the patient managed to be reached 

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:55.900
 practical speech recovery 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:05.960
 we repeat for the night table chair 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:08.790
 house house partition shore rue 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.730
 lieutenant colonel lieutenant colonel teacher 

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:14.720
 got to give shelter and ships Shia case 

00:05:11.730 --> 00:05:18.350
 stupid shinhan volcanic eruption 

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:18.350
 volcano dive 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:24.130
 today we looked at a conical example 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:27.720
 manifestations of afferent motor syndrome 

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:33.120
 aphasia and determined the direction of it 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.120
 rehab thank you for your attention
