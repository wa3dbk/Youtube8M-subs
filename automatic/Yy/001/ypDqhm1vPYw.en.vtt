00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:35.110 
strength exactly i call it away because

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.670 
strength exactly i call it away because
um<00:00:35.470> if<00:00:35.860> you<00:00:35.980> take<00:00:36.190> seven<00:00:36.880> levels<00:00:37.090> from<00:00:37.680> 99

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
um if you take seven levels from 99

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.340 
um if you take seven levels from 99
that's<00:00:38.890> 92<00:00:39.190> that's<00:00:39.580> half<00:00:39.820> of<00:00:40.030> the<00:00:40.120> XP<00:00:40.480> and<00:00:40.750> then

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
that's 92 that's half of the XP and then

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.630 
that's 92 that's half of the XP and then
you<00:00:41.500> hop<00:00:41.620> it<00:00:41.800> again<00:00:41.980> with<00:00:42.190> seven<00:00:42.460> levels

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:42.640 
you hop it again with seven levels

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.560 
you hop it again with seven levels
that's<00:00:42.970> 85<00:00:43.570> so<00:00:44.320> yeah<00:00:44.940> 25<00:00:45.940> sin<00:00:46.270> of<00:00:46.360> the<00:00:46.450> way

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
monetizing it because of the amount of

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:10.180 
monetizing it because of the amount of
views<00:05:05.479> i<00:05:05.660> got<00:05:05.810> on<00:05:05.930> my<00:05:06.080> 99<00:05:06.800> mage<00:05:07.220> vid<00:05:08.080> yeah<00:05:09.080> but<00:05:10.010> i
