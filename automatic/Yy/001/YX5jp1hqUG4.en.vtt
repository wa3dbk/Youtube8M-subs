the corners again and make a crease when
I'm<00:01:28.760> making<00:01:29.030> a<00:01:29.120> book<00:01:29.330> I<00:01:29.480> like<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:30.200> the<00:01:30.620> way<00:01:30.710> I

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
I'm making a book I like to the way I

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.680 
I'm making a book I like to the way I
look<00:01:31.040> at<00:01:31.220> it<00:01:31.250> is<00:01:31.490> it's<00:01:31.700> nice<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.180> try<00:01:32.360> to<00:01:32.420> be<00:01:32.570> as

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:32.690 
look at it is it's nice to try to be as

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.810 
look at it is it's nice to try to be as
careful<00:01:32.900> as<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.290> can<00:01:33.320> to<00:01:33.980> try<00:01:34.220> to<00:01:34.250> really<00:01:34.700> get

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:34.820 
careful as you can to try to really get

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.340 
careful as you can to try to really get
the<00:01:34.910> corners<00:01:35.240> lined<00:01:35.720> up<00:01:35.900> and<00:01:36.080> make<00:01:36.170> it<00:01:36.200> as

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
the corners lined up and make it as

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.660 
the corners lined up and make it as
perfect<00:01:36.680> as<00:01:36.740> you<00:01:36.800> can<00:01:37.010> but<00:01:37.340> if<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.490> doesn't

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:37.670 
perfect as you can but if it doesn't

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.430 
perfect as you can but if it doesn't
turn<00:01:37.880> out<00:01:37.940> exactly<00:01:38.450> that<00:01:38.630> way<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:39.140> okay

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
turn out exactly that way that's okay

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.920 
turn out exactly that way that's okay
it's<00:01:39.710> no<00:01:39.860> big<00:01:40.040> deal<00:01:40.090> now<00:01:41.090> I've<00:01:41.360> got<00:01:41.540> it<00:01:41.570> creased

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
it's no big deal now I've got it creased

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:43.960 
it's no big deal now I've got it creased
here<00:01:42.230> I'm<00:01:42.500> going<00:01:42.800> to<00:01:42.860> take<00:01:43.100> just<00:01:43.400> one<00:01:43.460> layer

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:43.970 
here I'm going to take just one layer

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.380 
here I'm going to take just one layer
and<00:01:44.650> I'm<00:01:45.650> going<00:01:45.830> to<00:01:45.860> fold<00:01:46.130> flip<00:01:46.790> it<00:01:46.910> back<00:01:47.120> so

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
and I'm going to fold flip it back so

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:48.960 
and I'm going to fold flip it back so
this<00:01:47.600> edge<00:01:47.870> is<00:01:48.080> going<00:01:48.260> to<00:01:48.320> get<00:01:48.410> flipped<00:01:48.740> back

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:48.970 
this edge is going to get flipped back

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:51.160 
this edge is going to get flipped back
I'm<00:01:49.970> going<00:01:50.150> to<00:01:50.210> line<00:01:50.450> it<00:01:50.480> up<00:01:50.660> with<00:01:50.720> the<00:01:50.930> fold

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
I'm going to line it up with the fold

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:57.010 
I'm going to line it up with the fold
and<00:01:51.730> then<00:01:52.730> I'm<00:01:52.940> going<00:01:53.210> to<00:01:53.300> crease<00:01:53.600> it<00:01:53.840> and<00:01:56.020> then

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.020 
and then I'm going to crease it and then

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.750 
and then I'm going to crease it and then
I'm<00:01:57.080> going<00:01:57.230> to<00:01:57.290> turn<00:01:57.410> it<00:01:57.560> over<00:01:57.680> so<00:01:58.040> now<00:01:58.460> the<00:01:58.520> big

00:01:58.750 --> 00:01:58.760 
I'm going to turn it over so now the big

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.570 
I'm going to turn it over so now the big
side<00:01:59.000> is<00:01:59.150> on<00:01:59.270> the<00:01:59.360> top<00:01:59.570> take<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.140> edge<00:02:00.430> flip<00:02:01.430> it

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
side is on the top take the edge flip it

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.790 
side is on the top take the edge flip it
back<00:02:01.610> to<00:02:02.060> meet<00:02:02.240> the<00:02:02.390> fold<00:02:02.660> make<00:02:03.380> sure<00:02:03.650> it's

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
back to meet the fold make sure it's

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.380 
back to meet the fold make sure it's
lined<00:02:04.070> up<00:02:04.310> and<00:02:04.520> then<00:02:05.510> crease<00:02:05.780> it

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:06.390 
lined up and then crease it

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.120 
lined up and then crease it
now<00:02:06.960> this<00:02:07.230> is<00:02:07.350> all<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.620> folding<00:02:07.920> we've<00:02:08.009> got

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.130 
now this is all the folding we've got

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:09.920 
now this is all the folding we've got
all<00:02:08.280> our<00:02:08.310> folding<00:02:08.729> done<00:02:08.940> and<00:02:09.509> we're<00:02:09.780> going<00:02:09.899> to

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
all our folding done and we're going to

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.100 
all our folding done and we're going to
get<00:02:10.110> ready<00:02:10.320> to<00:02:10.560> make<00:02:10.710> a<00:02:10.890> cut<00:02:11.810> I'm<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:12.900> to

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.170 
get ready to make a cut I'm going to
open<00:02:13.380> it<00:02:13.620> up<00:02:13.770> and<00:02:14.040> if<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.610> look<00:02:14.820> at<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.030> edge

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
open it up and if you look at the edge

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.970 
open it up and if you look at the edge
you'll<00:02:15.630> see<00:02:15.870> that<00:02:16.020> it<00:02:16.140> looks<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.470> the<00:02:16.770> letter

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
you'll see that it looks like the letter

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.240 
you'll see that it looks like the letter

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
going to cut right along that fold in

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:35.180 
going to cut right along that fold in
the<00:02:32.459> center<00:02:32.870> till<00:02:33.870> I<00:02:33.990> get<00:02:34.050> to<00:02:34.560> the<00:02:34.590> next<00:02:34.950> fold

get as up to the fold if you cut it too

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.780 
get as up to the fold if you cut it too
short<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:43.560> next<00:02:43.890> step<00:02:44.070> isn't<00:02:44.280> going<00:02:44.520> to<00:02:44.610> work

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
short the next step isn't going to work

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.390 
short the next step isn't going to work
now<00:02:45.750> I'm<00:02:46.020> going<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.200> take<00:02:46.410> the<00:02:46.560> turn<00:02:47.070> it<00:02:47.220> and
