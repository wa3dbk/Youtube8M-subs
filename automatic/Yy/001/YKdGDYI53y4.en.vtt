00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
and only 74 on premium shells so we

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.950

there's large repair tips but let's go

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.330 
there's large repair tips but let's go
back<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.600> the<00:01:51.780> T<00:01:51.899> 15<00:01:52.320> and<00:01:52.500> see<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:52.710> in<00:01:52.770> action<00:01:52.920> as

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
back to the T 15 and see it in action as

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.179 
back to the T 15 and see it in action as
we<00:01:53.939> just<00:01:54.119> saw<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.570> actually<00:01:54.780> bounced<00:01:55.530> three

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
we just saw I actually bounced three

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.289 
we just saw I actually bounced three
times<00:01:56.460> in<00:01:56.759> a<00:01:56.820> row<00:01:56.969> on<00:01:57.240> a<00:01:57.299> pun<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.869> too<00:01:58.170> and

00:01:59.289 --> 00:01:59.299 
times in a row on a pun so too and

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:01.490 
times in a row on a pun so too and
that's<00:02:00.299> the<00:02:00.450> reason<00:02:00.600> why<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:00.960> should<00:02:01.320> pack

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
that's the reason why you should pack

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.950 
that's the reason why you should pack
just<00:02:01.710> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.219> bit<00:02:02.399> premium<00:02:03.299> ammo<00:02:03.420> because

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
just a little bit premium ammo because

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.920 
just a little bit premium ammo because
this<00:02:04.320> is<00:02:04.530> a<00:02:04.740> tier<00:02:05.009> 3<00:02:05.040> tank<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.299> premium

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
this is a tier 3 tank so the premium

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.010 
this is a tier 3 tank so the premium
ammo<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.350> actually<00:02:07.829> dirt<00:02:08.190> cheap<00:02:08.789> and<00:02:09.090> you'll

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
ammo is actually dirt cheap and you'll

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.930 
ammo is actually dirt cheap and you'll
see<00:02:10.259> me<00:02:10.470> earning<00:02:10.890> quite<00:02:11.069> a<00:02:11.099> lot<00:02:11.250> of<00:02:11.340> money<00:02:11.370> even

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:11.940 
see me earning quite a lot of money even

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:13.350 
see me earning quite a lot of money even
though<00:02:12.090> i'm<00:02:12.360> going<00:02:12.720> to<00:02:12.870> use

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:13.360 
though i'm going to use

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.870 
though i'm going to use
this<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:14.200> premium<00:02:14.500> ammo<00:02:14.680> on<00:02:14.980> another<00:02:15.610> tank

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
this is premium ammo on another tank

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.120 
this is premium ammo on another tank
coming<00:02:16.180> my<00:02:16.270> way<00:02:16.300> because<00:02:17.290> that<00:02:17.500> is<00:02:17.680> another

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:18.130 
coming my way because that is another

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.400 
coming my way because that is another
tank<00:02:18.460> which<00:02:18.670> I<00:02:18.880> usually<00:02:19.210> bounce<00:02:19.690> on<00:02:19.930> even<00:02:20.290> with

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410 
tank which I usually bounce on even with

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.740 
tank which I usually bounce on even with
42<00:02:20.920> penetration<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.700> Panther<00:02:21.970> combatants<00:02:22.510> by

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:22.750 
42 penetration the Panther combatants by

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.490 
42 penetration the Panther combatants by
gay<00:02:23.650> is<00:02:24.210> tank<00:02:25.210> I<00:02:25.360> just<00:02:25.780> due<00:02:25.930> to<00:02:25.960> the<00:02:26.080> bounce<00:02:26.290> on

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:26.500 
gay is tank I just due to the bounce on

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:29.220 
gay is tank I just due to the bounce on
which<00:02:26.800> is<00:02:26.980> a<00:02:27.010> little<00:02:27.250> annoying<00:02:27.460> but<00:02:28.050> he<00:02:29.050> comes

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
which is a little annoying but he comes

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.800 
which is a little annoying but he comes
around<00:02:29.440> the<00:02:29.530> corner<00:02:29.560> and<00:02:29.920> fires<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.790> well<00:02:31.450> not

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
around the corner and fires is well not

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.460 
around the corner and fires is well not
fully<00:02:32.050> upgraded<00:02:32.500> gun<00:02:33.000> or<00:02:34.000> maybe<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.330> was<00:02:34.470> him

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:35.470 
fully upgraded gun or maybe it was him

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:37.440 
fully upgraded gun or maybe it was him
therefore<00:02:35.710> it<00:02:36.190> didn't<00:02:36.640> really<00:02:37.090> do<00:02:37.210> that<00:02:37.240> much

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
therefore it didn't really do that much

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:40.250 
therefore it didn't really do that much
damage<00:02:37.630> for<00:02:37.960> me<00:02:38.260> because<00:02:38.830> his<00:02:39.130> upgrade<00:02:39.400> gun<00:02:39.880> is

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
damage for me because his upgrade gun is

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.730 
damage for me because his upgrade gun is
I<00:02:41.260> think<00:02:41.650> it's<00:02:41.740> 95<00:02:42.720> penetration<00:02:43.720> and<00:02:43.959> very<00:02:44.560> low

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:44.740 
I think it's 95 penetration and very low

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.030 
I think it's 95 penetration and very low
damage<00:02:44.980> like<00:02:45.640> yes<00:02:46.209> we<00:02:46.450> saw<00:02:46.600> 30<00:02:47.320> every<00:02:47.709> single

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:48.040 
damage like yes we saw 30 every single

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:50.550 
damage like yes we saw 30 every single
shot<00:02:48.280> but<00:02:49.000> quickly<00:02:49.420> remembering<00:02:50.200> to<00:02:50.350> switch

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 
shot but quickly remembering to switch

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.430 
shot but quickly remembering to switch
back<00:02:50.800> to<00:02:50.830> a<00:02:51.220> pmo<00:02:51.880> because<00:02:52.360> we<00:02:53.020> are<00:02:53.170> in<00:02:53.350> a

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
back to a pmo because we are in a

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.020 
back to a pmo because we are in a
premium<00:02:53.739> tank<00:02:53.920> and<00:02:54.130> we<00:02:54.310> want<00:02:54.640> to<00:02:54.850> earn<00:02:54.910> some

premium tank and we want to earn some

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.050 
premium tank and we want to earn some
money<00:02:55.450> so<00:02:56.110> just<00:02:56.140> firing<00:02:56.830> all<00:02:57.190> premium<00:02:57.820> shells

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:58.060 
money so just firing all premium shells

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.830 
money so just firing all premium shells
is<00:02:58.330> pretty<00:02:59.170> redundant<00:03:00.510> unless<00:03:01.510> you<00:03:01.660> want<00:03:01.810> a

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:01.840 
is pretty redundant unless you want a

is pretty redundant unless you want a
stat<00:03:02.050> pat<00:03:02.320> and<00:03:02.970> really<00:03:03.970> doing<00:03:04.239> that<00:03:04.270> into<00:03:04.600> your

stat pat and really doing that into your
threes<00:03:04.989> you<00:03:05.350> won't<00:03:05.560> get<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:05.950> much

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
threes you won't get that much

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.030 
threes you won't get that much
efficiency<00:03:06.790> out<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:07.030> it<00:03:07.239> so<00:03:07.480> back<00:03:08.380> to<00:03:08.410> normal

in<00:03:53.739> the<00:03:53.860> game<00:03:53.890> because<00:03:54.280> his<00:03:54.670> team<00:03:54.880> is<00:03:55.060> actually

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
in the game because his team is actually

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:57.449 
in the game because his team is actually
losing<00:03:55.989> so<00:03:56.230> getting<00:03:56.590> to<00:03:56.769> some<00:03:56.920> cover<00:03:57.190> where

00:03:57.449 --> 00:03:57.459 
losing so getting to some cover where

00:03:57.459 --> 00:04:01.830 
losing so getting to some cover where
you<00:03:57.670> can<00:03:59.310> fake<00:04:00.310> your<00:04:00.640> opponents<00:04:01.180> into<00:04:01.360> going

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:01.840 
you can fake your opponents into going

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.720 
you can fake your opponents into going
around<00:04:02.049> a<00:04:02.170> corner<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.650> then<00:04:02.890> you<00:04:03.100> shoot<00:04:03.430> and

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:03.730 
around a corner and then you shoot and

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:06.150 
around a corner and then you shoot and
retreat<00:04:04.299> at<00:04:04.480> the<00:04:04.540> same<00:04:04.780> time<00:04:04.959> that<00:04:05.799> is<00:04:05.950> a<00:04:06.130> very

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
retreat at the same time that is a very

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.759 
retreat at the same time that is a very
good<00:04:06.489> thing<00:04:07.000> to<00:04:07.060> do<00:04:07.299> you<00:04:07.900> can<00:04:08.110> see<00:04:08.350> here<00:04:08.620> the

00:04:08.759 --> 00:04:08.769 
good thing to do you can see here the

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:13.199 
good thing to do you can see here the
LTP<00:04:09.310> is<00:04:09.519> down<00:04:09.910> there<00:04:10.150> he<00:04:10.959> is<00:04:11.170> in<00:04:11.410> a<00:04:11.739> 5<00:04:12.100> I<00:04:12.489> guessed

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
LTP is down there he is in a 5 I guessed

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.140 
LTP is down there he is in a 5 I guessed
60<00:04:14.070> actually<00:04:15.070> hit<00:04:15.190> that<00:04:15.220> building<00:04:15.579> right<00:04:15.970> next

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
60 actually hit that building right next

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.699 
60 actually hit that building right next
