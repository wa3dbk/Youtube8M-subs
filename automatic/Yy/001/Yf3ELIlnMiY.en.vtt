00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
Scott just picked this up yesterday it's

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.560 
Scott just picked this up yesterday it's
a<00:00:16.460> s<00:00:17.460> t12

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
a s t12

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:29.060 
a s t12
it's<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.850> 73<00:00:20.850> 74<00:00:22.400> 76<00:00:23.400> to<00:00:23.550> 73<00:00:24.060> or<00:00:24.150> 74<00:00:27.920> it's<00:00:28.920> got<00:00:29.039> a

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
it's a 73 74 76 to 73 or 74 it's got a

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.250 
it's a 73 74 76 to 73 or 74 it's got a
low<00:00:29.400> serial<00:00:29.910> number<00:00:30.179> some<00:00:30.420> I'm<00:00:30.810> guessing

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
low serial number some I'm guessing

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.209 
low serial number some I'm guessing
intra<00:00:32.239> just<00:00:33.239> 73<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.050> serial<00:00:34.350> numbers<00:00:34.620> 40<00:00:35.070> to

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
intra just 73 the serial numbers 40 to

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.600 
intra just 73 the serial numbers 40 to
75<00:00:35.700> which<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.600> actually<00:00:36.899> pretty<00:00:37.050> close<00:00:37.200> to<00:00:37.410> my

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
75 which is actually pretty close to my

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.049 
75 which is actually pretty close to my
16<00:00:39.469> but<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.590> cool<00:00:40.829> thing<00:00:40.860> that<00:00:41.370> it<00:00:41.850> has<00:00:41.879> is

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
16 but the cool thing that it has is

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.340 
16 but the cool thing that it has is
this<00:00:42.570> front<00:00:43.020> taupe<00:00:44.010> box<00:00:44.899> which<00:00:45.899> does<00:00:46.140> have

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
this front taupe box which does have

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.340 
this front taupe box which does have
some<00:00:47.420> pretty<00:00:48.420> noticeable<00:00:48.870> rust<00:00:49.770> damage<00:00:51.350> but

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
some pretty noticeable rust damage but

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.459 
some pretty noticeable rust damage but
I'm<00:00:52.559> just<00:00:52.680> going<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.789> it<00:00:53.910> to<00:00:53.940> Shane<00:00:57.469> hop

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
I'm just going to take it to Shane hop

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:12.710 
I'm just going to take it to Shane hop
on<00:00:58.680> or<00:00:59.070> show<00:00:59.550> it<00:00:59.579> how<00:00:59.820> it<00:00:59.940> dumps

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.370 

so<00:01:13.830> basically<00:01:14.830> what<00:01:15.070> this<00:01:15.220> war<00:01:15.909> is<00:01:16.210> like<00:01:17.110> just

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
so basically what this war is like just

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:18.960 
so basically what this war is like just
carrying<00:01:17.650> stuff<00:01:17.860> around<00:01:18.100> the<00:01:18.220> yard<00:01:18.490> or<00:01:18.790> like

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
carrying stuff around the yard or like

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.000 
carrying stuff around the yard or like
putting<00:01:19.300> tools<00:01:19.479> in<00:01:19.660> there<00:01:19.840> or<00:01:19.960> whatever<00:01:20.229> or

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:21.010 
putting tools in there or whatever or

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.750 
putting tools in there or whatever or
mulch<00:01:21.310> so<00:01:21.970> it's<00:01:22.150> kind<00:01:22.360> of<00:01:23.010> it's<00:01:24.010> not<00:01:24.190> anything

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:24.760 
mulch so it's kind of it's not anything

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:26.130 
mulch so it's kind of it's not anything
close<00:01:25.030> to<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.270> front-end<00:01:25.600> loader<00:01:25.630> but<00:01:25.900> you<00:01:25.990> can

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
close to a front-end loader but you can

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.719 
close to a front-end loader but you can
put<00:01:26.320> stuff<00:01:26.530> in<00:01:26.650> there<00:01:26.770> and<00:01:26.860> it<00:01:26.950> dumps<00:01:27.190> out<00:01:27.280> so

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:27.729 
put stuff in there and it dumps out so

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:31.499 
put stuff in there and it dumps out so
what<00:01:28.720> it's<00:01:28.869> got<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:30.790> got<00:01:30.850> the<00:01:31.060> nose<00:01:31.210> cone

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
what it's got it's got the nose cone

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:35.600 
what it's got it's got the nose cone
which<00:01:31.900> is<00:01:31.930> pretty<00:01:32.890> mint<00:01:33.240> the<00:01:34.240> lights<00:01:34.450> work

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
which is pretty mint the lights work

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.400 
which is pretty mint the lights work

it's got the grille piece the always

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.279 
it's got the grille piece the always
missing<00:01:41.710> side<00:01:41.950> cover<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:43.270> got<00:01:43.479> this<00:01:43.960> which
