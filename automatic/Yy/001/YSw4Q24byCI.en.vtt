00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:06.029
 hey people today wanted to be with the 

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:08.700
 resources therefore gold humana deal 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.880
 Often one reads on the forum that some 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.740
 players call for successful 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.719
 defense any rewards too 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:17.930
 received and many players have too 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.770
 to keep the problems of their sauces 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.689
 you have to think about which 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.470
 I have my options and my pace too 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.859
 defend 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.359
 Basically, you have exactly two 

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:29.640
 possibilities so either you try 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:33.600
 Of course, a particularly strong pace too 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.860
 build the attack then stops 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.200
 but you have the problem that you are very 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.790
 has many attacks or you try that 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.930
 second concept and makes a base you 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.200
 in an attack in any case 100 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.000
 is talked 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.289
 we'll just have a look here 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.890
 my defense report from yesterday 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.020
 here we see 14 11 percent neat 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.940
 Resources lost here where I once 

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.710
 100 percent sometimes arrives 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.539
 but otherwise we see many here 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.990
 attacks 23 23 percent 0 percent of 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.909
 Michael was here again 

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.909
 37 14 I often become a team man 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.840
 always sees high resources of you 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:14.460
 I'm not really interested in shares 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:17.130
 since I only really for 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:21.509
 experience raider gold is there enough 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:22.979
 You can watch them here like that 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.479
 a successful world looks like 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:26.909
 there we see through the weak points 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.680
 a base if you come in up there 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.780
 and of course already very strong 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.600
 Heroes but then break the debt 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.310
 through the strong core through and 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.880
 then he is actually still 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:40.280
 Formache happens to defeat the base 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:44.009
 but relatively rare 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:48.420
 Often you see the attacks here in 23 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:50.250
 percent so that from the outside is precisely where 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.200
 The children started here 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.990
 mostly a country or the second 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.390
 stay if we with the parks at 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:59.640
 complete two but mostly 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.219
 not even reach them 50 percent as 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.540
 I usually can not get a sign 

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.040
 with that, I know I deserve 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:06.390
 many resources I've always enough 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.990
 Maya of the whole world is not 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.420
 problem 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.819
 So my pace was very strong 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:12.640
 core 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.599
 we have already broken off before 

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:15.879
 he surrounds his hero 

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.409
 what does a strong pace look like? 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.409
 Often they make the mistake of the people 

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.129
 spread your hands over the whole map 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:23.019
 if you think about how to do it 

00:02:21.129 --> 00:02:24.099
 is attacked come all the heroes in 

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:25.629
 a pulk on withdrawal 

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:27.549
 that is, an individual becomes bright 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:30.459
 Overrunning many positions always 

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:31.900
 hero pro heerlager utter nonsense if 

00:02:30.459 --> 00:02:34.239
 you think like a strong one 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.239
 pace farmers try on all heroes 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:37.870
 to focus on one point 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.609
 but I come I still 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:46.900
 defense report 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:48.459
 We also see the attack coming in nicely 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.219
 by the middle, however , he had 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.799
 I think I misplaced the hang 

00:02:51.219 --> 00:02:55.959
 are vulnerable also has many heroes 

00:02:53.799 --> 00:02:57.129
 lost but still successful 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:03.219
 get through 

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:05.620
 here we have 14 percent we see 

00:03:03.219 --> 00:03:07.180
 in the room when the draw comes outside 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.250
 shoot the whole here already 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.840
 grieving the heroes will die 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:12.250
 most of them will leave immediately 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.829
 out before he dies hero 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.229
 I can unfortunately no current video 

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:18.430
 show but mostly is so if so 

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:19.569
 the heroes first a page here 

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:21.310
 they have come then 

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:25.540
 automatically to the middle and there they are waiting 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:27.370
 then the 15 cases that only survives 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.449
 with magic and only if we have the 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:33.400
 I had energy well placed anyway 

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:34.810
 yes somehow said a lot of raw materials because 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.310
 my pace did not set it up that way 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:37.599
 my raw materials are defended 

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:39.040
 but just here like monster because 

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.799
 his raw materials are not for me 

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:43.750
 Primarily important you can still do it now 

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:45.509
 Try the raw materials here 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.659
 to accommodate the raw materials 

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:49.180
 defend 

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:52.019
 but basically you should 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:54.129
 consider how important the raw materials are 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:57.669
 if you say the raw materials are because 

00:03:54.129 --> 00:03:58.840
 I really really care if he does 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:01.599
 not exactly from the beginning 

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:03.939
 Low so loud account to have 

00:04:01.599 --> 00:04:05.829
 it is recommended to build the base so that 

00:04:03.939 --> 00:04:07.930
 you completely saved in an attack 

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:09.639
 that is to say, he will be on when he is on 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.549
 go out all your heroes from all over 

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:14.979
 the garnison then cashed one 

00:04:12.549 --> 00:04:16.539
 attack war expensive ten hours shield 

00:04:14.979 --> 00:04:18.760
 and can not be molded permanently 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.560
 because he has many players on this 

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:22.240
 the middle one made him exactly that 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:24.250
 mistake yes they obstruct 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:26.620
 supposedly a strong pace and annoying 

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:29.099
 then over just stronger players, the 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:32.289
 all these resources and colors 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:33.789
 it is even among the top 100 players 

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.530
 so there is no base that does not exist 

00:04:33.789 --> 00:04:38.139
 so can be talked about this 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.729
 I thought my pace was unacceptable 

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:40.900
 you should say goodbye quickly 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:43.590
 you have to make the decision for yourself 

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:47.410
 the resources are important to me 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.970
 then you should think twice 

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:50.229
 I really like him to build the base 

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.090
 that I'll be overrun once and 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:53.289
 with it ten hours sign 

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:55.180
 otherwise you can hardly change it 

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:58.120
 that you have a lot of resources overnight 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.610
 loses simple variant is still from 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:03.250
 the active one played before he 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:05.020
 In the evening then out a friend goes out of the 

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:08.199
 said come give me a sign with it 

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:10.360
 of course, the heroes out and the 

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:14.020
 garnison makes you learn then rolls through 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:16.000
 a friend about possibility 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:19.569
 of course here on rankings on the da 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.370
 he just loses 1 12 the raw materials like that 

00:05:19.569 --> 00:05:25.120
 It's easy to make sure of that 

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:26.949
 that you have ten hours sign and you 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:28.150
 has not lost so much rouge needs 

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:30.539
 but still one somewhere 

00:05:28.150 --> 00:05:32.800
 player here in the top 1000 x 

00:05:30.539 --> 00:05:34.090
 can reach so can attack because 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:36.280
 he will not click though 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.810
 He now even space 30,000 and 40,000 

00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:38.500
 side wants to be able to attack at the 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.539
 to give step 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:42.430
 as I said that is why the offers 

00:05:40.539 --> 00:05:43.870
 second variant you all hero out 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:46.780
 revision then learn he gets in any 

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:48.460
 fall in the ten hours sign is on 

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:50.650
 easiest to secure the resources 

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:52.659
 Of course you have a share 

00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:54.090
 losses but the loss frame holds 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:59.889
 in limits 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:06:02.860
 yes, as much as you have your resources 

00:05:59.889 --> 00:06:05.259
 can protect if you want to know how 

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:07.990
 you have a lot of resources in a short time 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:10.210
 can pile up then look at you 

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:13.000
 times a video where it goes around so one 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.349
 mofa account and i hope i have 

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.229
 could explain you a little bit how 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:20.800
 you deal with your gold and mahner 

00:06:17.229 --> 00:06:23.250
 so much of me have to make unsightly scars 

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.250
 through yet
