00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560 
you how to make a lemonade which is how

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.240 
you how to make a lemonade which is how
my<00:00:07.830> grandma<00:00:08.400> used<00:00:08.639> to<00:00:08.790> make<00:00:08.849> it<00:00:09.240> it<00:00:10.139> is<00:00:11.099> very

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:11.250 
my grandma used to make it it is very

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.350 
my grandma used to make it it is very
different<00:00:11.849> from<00:00:12.389> the<00:00:12.660> traditional<00:00:14.360> lemonade

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.360 
different from the traditional lemonade

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:19.090 
different from the traditional lemonade
then<00:00:15.960> we<00:00:16.139> make<00:00:16.410> that<00:00:16.710> we<00:00:16.980> squeeze<00:00:17.369> the<00:00:17.640> lemons

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:19.100 
then we make that we squeeze the lemons

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.250 
then we make that we squeeze the lemons
so<00:00:20.100> this<00:00:20.369> is<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.580> different<00:00:21.150> let's<00:00:21.750> say<00:00:21.990> it's

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
so this is a different let's say it's

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.890 
so this is a different let's say it's
the<00:00:22.410> same<00:00:22.619> at<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.039> same<00:00:23.220> ingredients<00:00:24.090> it<00:00:24.539> just

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
the same at the same ingredients it just

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.220 
the same at the same ingredients it just
tastes<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.470> bit<00:00:25.500> different<00:00:26.250> and<00:00:26.930> it's<00:00:27.930> much

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:28.230 
tastes a bit different and it's much

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.780 
tastes a bit different and it's much
easier<00:00:28.830> to<00:00:29.099> do<00:00:29.310> well<00:00:30.029> for<00:00:30.660> me<00:00:31.250> you're<00:00:32.250> going<00:00:32.610> to

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270 

and<00:01:24.270> now<00:01:25.020> we're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.590> to<00:01:25.680> get<00:01:25.920> ready<00:01:26.130> to

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
and now we're going to get ready to

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.030 
and now we're going to get ready to
blend<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.910> you<00:01:27.570> need<00:01:27.750> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.050> very<00:01:28.350> careful

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
blend it you need to be very careful

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.870

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
because if you blend it too much it's

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.370 
because if you blend it too much it's
gonna<00:01:33.120> taste<00:01:33.540> bad<00:01:34.230> so<00:01:34.650> make<00:01:35.520> sure<00:01:36.050> you<00:01:37.050> just

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
gonna taste bad so make sure you just

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.700 
gonna taste bad so make sure you just
blend<00:01:37.710> it<00:01:37.920> for<00:01:37.950> about<00:01:38.160> five<00:01:38.820> seconds<00:01:39.680> to<00:01:40.680> the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
blend it for about five seconds to the

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.280 
blend it for about five seconds to the
highest<00:01:41.070> speed<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:41.790> can<00:01:42.030> do<00:01:42.210> you<00:01:42.540> can<00:01:42.780> use<00:01:43.080> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
highest speed you can do you can use the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.730 
highest speed you can do you can use the
ice<00:01:43.470> crush<00:01:43.950> setting<00:01:44.670> just<00:01:45.510> 5<00:01:45.930> seconds<00:01:46.500> and

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
ice crush setting just 5 seconds and

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.600 
ice crush setting just 5 seconds and
that's<00:01:47.010> it<00:01:47.630> that's<00:01:48.630> all<00:01:49.020> you're<00:01:49.890> going<00:01:50.160> to<00:01:50.280> do

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
that's it that's all you're going to do

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:58.969 
that's it that's all you're going to do
to<00:01:51.210> this<00:01:52.250> lemonade<00:01:54.050> and<00:01:55.880> you<00:01:56.880> could<00:01:57.119> see<00:01:57.979> in

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
to this lemonade and you could see in

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.219 
to this lemonade and you could see in
here<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.490> it's<00:01:59.670> its<00:02:00.000> final<00:02:00.450> blend<00:02:00.690> but<00:02:00.990> it's

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
here that it's its final blend but it's

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:04.190 
here that it's its final blend but it's
not<00:02:01.470> too<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:02.570> you're<00:02:03.570> gonna<00:02:03.720> take<00:02:04.050> your

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
not too much you're gonna take your

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 
then you're gonna take any strainer and

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.220 
then you're gonna take any strainer and
you're<00:02:11.970> going<00:02:12.150> to<00:02:12.510> strain<00:02:13.670> the<00:02:14.670> all<00:02:15.630> this

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230

mixture together and that's basically it

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.900 
mixture together and that's basically it
I<00:02:21.750> mean<00:02:21.930> my<00:02:22.260> strainer<00:02:22.740> was<00:02:23.190> not<00:02:23.400> in<00:02:23.520> the<00:02:23.640> good

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:23.910 
I mean my strainer was not in the good

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:26.930 
I mean my strainer was not in the good
condition<00:02:24.570> but<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.080> know<00:02:25.620> you<00:02:26.490> know<00:02:26.610> sometimes

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:26.940 
condition but I know you know sometimes

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:29.540
