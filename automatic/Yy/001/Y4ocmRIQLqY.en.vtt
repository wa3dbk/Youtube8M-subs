okay<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.620> what<00:00:01.979> we<00:00:02.100> have<00:00:02.310> here<00:00:02.700> is<00:00:02.879> a<00:00:03.270> fuel

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
okay so what we have here is a fuel

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.099 
okay so what we have here is a fuel
injection<00:00:05.180> project<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.330> have<00:00:06.450> been<00:00:06.629> working<00:00:06.960> on

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
injection project I have been working on

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:09.530 
injection project I have been working on
I've<00:00:07.379> been<00:00:07.620> working<00:00:08.010> on<00:00:08.099> this<00:00:08.250> project<00:00:08.540> I'm

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
I've been working on this project I'm

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.020 
I've been working on this project I'm
converting<00:00:10.530> a<00:00:10.620> carburetor<00:00:11.250> to<00:00:11.639> a<00:00:11.670> fuel

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
converting a carburetor to a fuel

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.970 
converting a carburetor to a fuel
injection<00:00:12.389> system<00:00:13.139> and<00:00:13.610> what<00:00:14.610> I<00:00:14.639> have<00:00:15.000> here<00:00:15.480> is

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:15.980 
injection system and what I have here is

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.269 
injection system and what I have here is
the<00:00:16.980> circuit<00:00:17.670> diagram<00:00:18.740> I'm<00:00:19.740> going<00:00:19.920> to<00:00:19.980> point

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
the circuit diagram I'm going to point

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.390 
the circuit diagram I'm going to point
out<00:00:20.400> a<00:00:20.430> couple<00:00:20.490> key<00:00:21.710> factors<00:00:22.710> of<00:00:22.740> what<00:00:23.070> I<00:00:23.100> got

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
out a couple key factors of what I got

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:30.410 
out a couple key factors of what I got
going<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.350> right<00:00:27.949> here<00:00:28.949> what<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.760> have<00:00:29.880> is<00:00:30.390> I

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
going on right here what I have is I

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.770 
going on right here what I have is I
have<00:00:31.189> the<00:00:32.189> 100k<00:00:33.290> ohm<00:00:34.520> resistors<00:00:35.520> and<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.630> is

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
have the 100k ohm resistors and that is

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.750 
have the 100k ohm resistors and that is
not<00:00:37.050> going<00:00:37.320> directly<00:00:37.710> to<00:00:37.890> ground<00:00:38.070> that<00:00:38.640> you

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
not going directly to ground that you

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.680 
not going directly to ground that you
will<00:00:38.910> see<00:00:39.090> in<00:00:39.180> a<00:00:39.270> couple<00:00:39.420> postings<00:00:40.110> and<00:00:40.410> uh

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
will see in a couple postings and uh

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.510 
will see in a couple postings and uh
tutorials<00:00:42.690> they<00:00:43.410> have<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:43.800> lead<00:00:44.040> going<00:00:44.309> to

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
tutorials they have this lead going to

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.310 
tutorials they have this lead going to
ground<00:00:44.820> I<00:00:45.059> haven't<00:00:45.360> tried<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.690> with<00:00:45.960> going<00:00:46.110> the

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
ground I haven't tried it with going the

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.490 
ground I haven't tried it with going the
ground<00:00:46.559> but<00:00:47.340> uh<00:00:47.370> I<00:00:48.059> know<00:00:48.719> that<00:00:49.020> it<00:00:49.110> works<00:00:49.289> this

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
ground but uh I know that it works this

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.069 
ground but uh I know that it works this
way<00:00:49.559> I've<00:00:49.829> tried<00:00:50.129> it<00:00:50.280> this<00:00:50.430> way<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:51.059> this<00:00:52.020> is

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
way I've tried it this way and this is

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.130 
way I've tried it this way and this is
how<00:00:52.230> I<00:00:52.379> actually<00:00:52.920> have<00:00:53.309> wired<00:00:53.610> it<00:00:53.879> up<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.270> add

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
how I actually have wired it up and add

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.029 
how I actually have wired it up and add
all<00:00:55.469> my<00:00:55.649> injection<00:00:56.129> injectors<00:00:57.090> running<00:00:57.480> um

00:00:58.029 --> 00:00:58.039 
all my injection injectors running um

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:02.000 
all my injection injectors running um
now<00:00:59.039> I'm<00:00:59.250> what<00:01:00.120> I<00:01:00.149> do<00:01:00.270> is<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.930> ran<00:01:01.289> it<00:01:01.469> from<00:01:01.770> the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
now I'm what I do is I ran it from the

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.109 
now I'm what I do is I ran it from the
far<00:01:02.550> left-hand<00:01:03.270> side<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:04.830> MOSFET<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:06.000> I

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
far left-hand side of the MOSFET and I

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.929 
far left-hand side of the MOSFET and I
ran<00:01:06.390> that<00:01:06.630> directly<00:01:07.290> to<00:01:07.680> the<00:01:08.010> far<00:01:08.490> right-hand

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
ran that directly to the far right-hand

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:11.390 
ran that directly to the far right-hand
side<00:01:09.540> and<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.020> goes<00:01:10.500> directly<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:11.130> crap

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
side and then that goes directly to crap

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.719 
side and then that goes directly to crap
then<00:01:12.240> also<00:01:12.570> on<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.320> couple<00:01:13.770> of<00:01:13.860> tutorials<00:01:14.100> I've

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
then also on a couple of tutorials I've

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.630 
then also on a couple of tutorials I've
watched<00:01:15.060> the<00:01:15.720> signal<00:01:16.320> wire<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.890> always<00:01:17.430> before

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
watched the signal wire is always before

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.270 
watched the signal wire is always before
the<00:01:18.150> resistor<00:01:18.750> or<00:01:18.900> always<00:01:19.170> before<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> goes<00:01:20.009> to

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
the resistor or always before it goes to

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.850 
the resistor or always before it goes to
ground<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:21.150> what<00:01:21.330> I<00:01:21.360> did<00:01:21.509> is<00:01:22.049> I<00:01:22.320> put<00:01:22.650> this

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
ground so what I did is I put this

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.789 
ground so what I did is I put this
before<00:01:23.369> now<00:01:24.180> like<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.720> said<00:01:25.049> before<00:01:25.080> we

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
before now like I have said before we

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.999 
before now like I have said before we
might<00:01:26.070> be<00:01:26.220> able<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.820> maybe<00:01:27.450> go<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:28.470> after<00:01:28.920> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
might be able to maybe go the after the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.310 
might be able to maybe go the after the
resistor<00:01:29.520> I<00:01:29.790> went<00:01:30.450> before<00:01:30.600> because<00:01:31.140> that's

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
resistor I went before because that's

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:32.990 
resistor I went before because that's
all<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.619> tutorials<00:01:31.950> I've<00:01:32.340> watched<00:01:32.610> on<00:01:32.790> how<00:01:32.939> to

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
all the tutorials I've watched on how to

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.060 
all the tutorials I've watched on how to
do<00:01:33.240> this<00:01:33.479> this<00:01:34.110> is<00:01:34.320> the<00:01:34.439> first<00:01:34.680> circuit

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
do this this is the first circuit

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.190 
do this this is the first circuit
project<00:01:35.520> I've<00:01:35.670> had<00:01:36.030> like<00:01:36.270> this<00:01:36.509> i<00:01:36.750> watch<00:01:36.990> I've

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
project I've had like this i watch I've

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.280 
project I've had like this i watch I've
read<00:01:38.100> plenty<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.579> diagrams<00:01:39.299> and<00:01:39.720> drawn<00:01:40.110> up

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
read plenty of diagrams and drawn up

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:45.020 
read plenty of diagrams and drawn up
plenty<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.579> this<00:01:41.790> is<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:43.250> first<00:01:44.250> one<00:01:44.640> that's

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
plenty but this is the first one that's

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.359 
plenty but this is the first one that's
ever<00:01:45.299> went<00:01:45.689> into<00:01:46.110> detail<00:01:46.470> like<00:01:46.920> this<00:01:47.840> R<00:01:49.369> has

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
ever went into detail like this R has

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.990 
ever went into detail like this R has
been<00:01:50.820> into<00:01:51.210> an<00:01:51.329> injection<00:01:52.130> project<00:01:53.130> now

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
been into an injection project now

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.060 
been into an injection project now
anyways<00:01:54.630> what<00:01:54.899> I<00:01:54.930> have<00:01:55.110> going<00:01:55.470> on<00:01:55.590> here<00:01:55.920> is

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
anyways what I have going on here is

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:57.649 
anyways what I have going on here is
this<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.369> going<00:01:56.520> to<00:01:56.579> be<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.790> my<00:01:56.939> signals<00:01:57.450> out

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
this is going to be all my signals out

00:01:57.659 --> 00:02:00.469 
this is going to be all my signals out
or<00:01:58.290> all<00:01:58.439> my<00:01:58.590> outputs<00:01:59.130> and<00:01:59.460> then<00:02:00.210> we're<00:02:00.360> going

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
or all my outputs and then we're going

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:03.319 
or all my outputs and then we're going
to<00:02:00.509> go<00:02:00.659> into<00:02:00.840> all<00:02:01.110> my<00:02:01.290> injectors<00:02:02.040> now<00:02:02.880> another

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
to go into all my injectors now another

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.149 
to go into all my injectors now another
thing<00:02:03.479> that<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:03.960> want<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.200> point<00:02:04.439> out<00:02:04.619> is<00:02:04.890> right

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.290 
can put a 5 volt USB hookup
right<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.290> your<00:02:14.740> Arduino<00:02:15.400> board<00:02:15.760> I'm<00:02:15.970> gonna<00:02:16.120> be

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
right in your Arduino board I'm gonna be

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.210 
right in your Arduino board I'm gonna be
running<00:02:16.570> a<00:02:16.660> sub<00:02:16.930> board<00:02:17.260> and<00:02:17.800> I'm<00:02:17.890> gonna<00:02:18.070> hook

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
running a sub board and I'm gonna hook

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.940 
running a sub board and I'm gonna hook
that<00:02:18.430> directly<00:02:18.820> after<00:02:19.090> 12<00:02:19.540> volt<00:02:19.870> power<00:02:20.110> then

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
that directly after 12 volt power then

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.640 
that directly after 12 volt power then
I'm<00:02:21.040> also<00:02:21.190> going<00:02:21.400> to<00:02:21.490> have<00:02:21.640> my<00:02:21.870> it<00:02:22.870> restricted

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:23.650 
I'm also going to have my it restricted

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.430 
I'm also going to have my it restricted
right<00:02:23.920> here<00:02:24.370> with<00:02:25.360> own<00:02:25.570> resistors<00:02:26.200> and<00:02:26.350> I'm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
right here with own resistors and I'm

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:29.490 
right here with own resistors and I'm
going<00:02:26.560> to<00:02:26.590> be<00:02:26.680> putting<00:02:26.890> them<00:02:27.190> in<00:02:27.520> so<00:02:28.480> that<00:02:28.510> it

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
going to be putting them in so that it

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.970 
going to be putting them in so that it
doesn't<00:02:29.920> get<00:02:30.040> too<00:02:30.310> much<00:02:30.520> power<00:02:31.000> and<00:02:31.990> causes

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
doesn't get too much power and causes

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:35.790 
doesn't get too much power and causes
the<00:02:33.130> chip<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.490> fry<00:02:33.790> up<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:35.290> one<00:02:35.560> more<00:02:35.740> thing

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:35.800 
the chip to fry up the one more thing

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:38.370 
the chip to fry up the one more thing
that<00:02:36.040> I<00:02:36.280> want<00:02:36.460> to<00:02:36.520> point<00:02:36.730> out<00:02:37.000> is<00:02:37.270> that<00:02:37.330> I<00:02:38.050> also

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
that I want to point out is that I also

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.130 
that I want to point out is that I also
on<00:02:38.890> my<00:02:39.010> throttle<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:39.820> ran<00:02:40.030> into<00:02:40.210> this<00:02:40.390> problem<00:02:40.450> I

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:41.140 
on my throttle I ran into this problem I

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:46.170 
on my throttle I ran into this problem I
ran<00:02:41.980> my<00:02:42.220> Hotwire<00:02:43.030> directly<00:02:43.750> to<00:02:43.960> my<00:02:44.140> 5<00:02:44.440> volt<00:02:45.180> or

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
ran my Hotwire directly to my 5 volt or

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:51.270 
ran my Hotwire directly to my 5 volt or
my<00:02:46.480> um<00:02:47.140> my<00:02:48.070> power<00:02:48.580> going<00:02:48.940> into<00:02:49.420> my<00:02:50.130> edition<00:02:51.130> my

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:51.280 
my um my power going into my edition my

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.280 
my um my power going into my edition my
throttle<00:02:51.610> position<00:02:51.730> sensor<00:02:52.420> I<00:02:52.660> ran<00:02:53.140> that

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
throttle position sensor I ran that

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.220 
throttle position sensor I ran that
directly<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:53.890> my<00:02:54.010> 5<00:02:54.310> volt<00:02:54.610> and<00:02:54.990> that<00:02:55.990> caused

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
directly to my 5 volt and that caused

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:58.650 
directly to my 5 volt and that caused
the<00:02:56.410> injectors<00:02:56.950> not<00:02:57.250> to<00:02:57.430> all<00:02:57.610> call<00:02:57.970> some<00:02:58.510> of

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660 
the injectors not to all call some of

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:01.740 
the injectors not to all call some of
them<00:02:58.780> were<00:02:59.610> kind<00:03:00.610> of<00:03:00.790> opening<00:03:01.330> but<00:03:01.510> not

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:01.750 
them were kind of opening but not

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.140 
them were kind of opening but not
shutting<00:03:02.530> or<00:03:03.040> they're<00:03:03.280> gonna<00:03:03.490> care

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:04.150 
shutting or they're gonna care

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.720 
shutting or they're gonna care
kinda<00:03:04.810> they<00:03:05.440> weren't<00:03:05.650> doing<00:03:06.220> their<00:03:06.490> full

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 
kinda they weren't doing their full

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:09.450 
kinda they weren't doing their full
process<00:03:07.380> it<00:03:08.380> wasn't<00:03:08.800> getting<00:03:08.860> enough<00:03:09.220> power

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:09.460 
process it wasn't getting enough power

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.580 
process it wasn't getting enough power
to<00:03:09.610> actually<00:03:10.000> complete<00:03:10.270> the<00:03:10.450> circuit<00:03:10.900> so<00:03:11.410> what

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
to actually complete the circuit so what

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.100 
to actually complete the circuit so what
I<00:03:11.620> ended<00:03:11.980> up<00:03:12.100> doing<00:03:12.160> is<00:03:13.000> I<00:03:13.210> ran<00:03:13.510> that<00:03:13.690> directly

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:14.110 
I ended up doing is I ran that directly

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:17.010 
I ended up doing is I ran that directly
to<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.740> positive<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.430> my<00:03:15.580> battery<00:03:16.090> and<00:03:16.360> I<00:03:16.810> also

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:17.020 
to the positive of my battery and I also

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:20.790 
to the positive of my battery and I also
put<00:03:17.410> a<00:03:17.440> hundred<00:03:17.710> uh<00:03:18.300> K<00:03:19.300> ohm<00:03:19.570> resistor<00:03:20.200> and<00:03:20.230> as

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
put a hundred uh K ohm resistor and as

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:25.740 
put a hundred uh K ohm resistor and as
well<00:03:22.410> so<00:03:23.410> here<00:03:23.950> is<00:03:24.190> my<00:03:24.520> circuit<00:03:25.030> diagram<00:03:25.510> I

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
well so here is my circuit diagram I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.590 
well so here is my circuit diagram I
will<00:03:26.110> be<00:03:26.290> posting<00:03:27.390> this<00:03:28.390> up<00:03:28.690> on<00:03:29.430> line<00:03:30.430> so<00:03:31.180> you

any questions or anything let me know
one<00:04:24.130> last<00:04:24.400> thing<00:04:24.610> before<00:04:24.760> I<00:04:24.970> get<00:04:25.150> off<00:04:25.270> here

00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:25.300 
one last thing before I get off here

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:26.250 
one last thing before I get off here
that<00:04:25.510> I'm<00:04:25.690> going<00:04:25.810> to<00:04:25.840> point

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:26.260 
that I'm going to point

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.830 
that I'm going to point
is<00:04:26.560> that<00:04:27.070> I<00:04:27.100> have<00:04:27.430> not<00:04:27.670> hooked<00:04:27.910> up<00:04:28.150> this<00:04:28.510> water

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
is that I have not hooked up this water

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.630 
is that I have not hooked up this water
time<00:04:29.140> census<00:04:29.650> um<00:04:30.030> so<00:04:31.030> I<00:04:32.130> might<00:04:33.130> have<00:04:33.160> to<00:04:33.340> change

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
time census um so I might have to change

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:37.320 
time census um so I might have to change
my<00:04:33.880> code<00:04:34.120> up<00:04:34.300> a<00:04:34.420> little<00:04:34.600> bit<00:04:34.780> for<00:04:35.110> it<00:04:36.150> but<00:04:37.150> this

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
my code up a little bit for it but this

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:39.300 
my code up a little bit for it but this
from<00:04:37.720> like<00:04:37.930> from<00:04:38.290> what<00:04:38.560> I've<00:04:38.680> done<00:04:39.100> in

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
from like from what I've done in

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.720 
from like from what I've done in
circuitry<00:04:40.030> and<00:04:40.710> drawing<00:04:41.710> circuit<00:04:42.100> boards<00:04:42.520> and

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:42.730 
circuitry and drawing circuit boards and

00:04:42.730 --> 00:04:45.690 
circuitry and drawing circuit boards and
stuff<00:04:42.970> this<00:04:43.300> is<00:04:43.510> what<00:04:43.780> I<00:04:43.810> would<00:04:44.250> assume<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.550> how

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
stuff this is what I would assume is how

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:47.760 
stuff this is what I would assume is how
it<00:04:45.880> goes<00:04:46.180> together<00:04:46.480> like<00:04:46.870> I<00:04:46.990> said<00:04:47.230> I<00:04:47.260> have<00:04:47.470> not

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
it goes together like I said I have not

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.190 
it goes together like I said I have not
actually<00:04:47.950> hooked<00:04:48.370> this<00:04:48.520> up<00:04:48.580> for<00:04:49.150> that<00:04:49.420> so<00:04:50.140> I

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:50.200 
actually hooked this up for that so I

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:52.560 
actually hooked this up for that so I
want<00:04:50.380> to<00:04:50.440> point<00:04:50.590> that<00:04:50.740> out<00:04:50.860> to<00:04:51.340> uh<00:04:51.370> if<00:04:52.120> you

00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:52.570 
want to point that out to uh if you

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:54.480 
want to point that out to uh if you
would<00:04:52.870> hook<00:04:53.080> it<00:04:53.230> up<00:04:53.350> a<00:04:53.440> different<00:04:53.470> way<00:04:53.800> modify

00:04:54.480 --> 00:04:54.490 
would hook it up a different way modify

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.540 
would hook it up a different way modify
it<00:04:54.550> definitely<00:04:55.510> check<00:04:55.840> your<00:04:56.830> terminals<00:04:57.340> with

00:04:57.540 --> 00:04:57.550 
it definitely check your terminals with

00:04:57.550 --> 00:04:59.490 
it definitely check your terminals with
a<00:04:57.580> multi<00:04:58.150> test<00:04:58.390> or<00:04:58.660> make<00:04:58.900> sure<00:04:59.080> you're<00:04:59.380> not

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
a multi test or make sure you're not

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.830 
a multi test or make sure you're not
crossing<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.790> accidentally<00:05:01.420> in<00:05:01.510> business

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:01.840 
crossing this accidentally in business

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.510 
crossing this accidentally in business
and<00:05:02.080> you<00:05:02.140> hook<00:05:02.230> it<00:05:02.350> up<00:05:02.470> to<00:05:02.590> a<00:05:02.620> sub<00:05:02.950> board<00:05:03.280> or<00:05:03.490> a

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
and you hook it up to a sub board or a

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.680 
and you hook it up to a sub board or a
breadboard<00:05:04.030> um<00:05:04.480> oh<00:05:05.880> when<00:05:06.880> you<00:05:06.940> solder<00:05:07.240> it<00:05:07.510> make

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
breadboard um oh when you solder it make

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.920 
breadboard um oh when you solder it make
sure<00:05:07.840> none<00:05:08.080> of<00:05:08.110> your<00:05:08.290> solder<00:05:09.010> ZAR<00:05:09.400> getting

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:09.930 
sure none of your solder ZAR getting

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.720 
sure none of your solder ZAR getting
connected<00:05:10.930> because<00:05:11.320> that<00:05:11.620> could<00:05:11.890> end<00:05:12.550> up

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:12.730 
connected because that could end up

00:05:12.730 --> 00:05:17.160 
connected because that could end up
burning<00:05:13.030> something<00:05:13.450> out<00:05:13.630> or<00:05:13.870> causing<00:05:14.650> a<00:05:16.170> short

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:17.170 
burning something out or causing a short

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:19.050 
burning something out or causing a short
somewhere<00:05:17.530> on<00:05:17.800> the<00:05:17.920> line<00:05:18.130> so<00:05:18.430> definitely<00:05:18.910> you

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:21.720 
somewhere on the line so definitely you
want<00:05:19.180> to<00:05:19.300> check<00:05:19.540> that<00:05:19.570> make<00:05:20.020> sure<00:05:20.370> so<00:05:21.370> hope

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:21.730
