00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.280
 lol 

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.260
 lol 

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.549
 number one like me that somehow 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.569
 has grown the world of racing is always 

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.230
 it's great to be directly on the competition field but I have to say that 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.640
 we are organized in such a way as to power 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.850
 work very well autonomously on the track to you the work I do now 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.970
 does not allow me to be ever present, I miss you for sure 

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:31.119
 but I'm happy 

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:35.000
 well there is a fairly continuous contact with the track 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:39.530
 and then obviously legal that goes on television is not the same thing 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.530
 but I must say that the proximity to girls is always a fortress 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.370
 we have an organization in which filippo precious of the ducati general manager 

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.519
 corse also he is not present directly on the track but 

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:55.840
 has a direct link with the ability to view data acquisition files 

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.020
 exchange information continuously with track turns 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:02.090
 let's say I feel with 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:05.140
 singing bones rather than on pomonte alone it departs 

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:08.509
 let's say management and organization the whole game of piero 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.950
 ducati today a company 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.380
 suffers as many other taxes for the difficulty 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.340
 but much less our other competitors today 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.120
 somehow in extinction 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.909
 which we can define as stable 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:24.909
 we have 

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:25.810
 as soon as 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.540
 passed 2008 which was the best year in the history of duchies then a year 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:31.470
 where we have 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.550
 sold almost 43,000 motorcycles which is a historical recor 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:36.510
 ele 

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.620
 our plans are to grow with great moderation because we want to 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.670
 keep it company as a company capable of making motorcycles 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:47.120
 very particular and very 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:49.410
 somehow 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.810
 earthquake research that anyway 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.170
 buy them 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.180
 and one this was a generic product but euromoto for real fans 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.080
 and therefore 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.410
 the numbers we content are numbers that could become 50 60 thousand people 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:06.630
 within a few years 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.050
 we consider reasonable with the development plans changing the near future 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.929
 ethylhexyl 

00:02:11.929 --> 00:02:14.929
 driver who brought us the GP motorcycle world title so obviously 

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:19.280
 the answer is a poke to be in that very important state 

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:23.849
 however the ducati has a great tradition of change I have you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.489
 from 

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:27.789
 camfrog also with the one who won 

00:02:27.789 --> 00:02:31.079
 400 world super bike point foibe ske 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:33.989
 he replaced it and filled our hearts 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:35.119
 with 

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:38.419
 to tie fantastic that he started from 

00:02:38.419 --> 00:02:40.879
 overtaking of monza 

00:02:40.879 --> 00:02:45.200
 in 2000 in Puglia exceeded 4 pilots only once I lost my heart then sad 

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:46.719
 loris capirossi 

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:49.019
 if the rabbit asi moto gp 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.819
 certainly 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:53.259
 I had a large part, I asked 

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:56.499
 continues in some way very big clutch costs 

00:02:56.499 --> 00:02:59.409
 has brought you great results 

00:02:59.409 --> 00:03:01.329
 and therefore I must say that 

00:03:01.329 --> 00:03:04.329
 we are very happy to have a boy in the team who 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:09.609
 I think I still have a lot of growth power, I did a lot 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:12.829
 it's definitely sweet I think the best crisis can still come 

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.430
 tamoto a great passion as the car as is the engine in general 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.959
 eh i care nothing. the part also of 

00:03:22.229 --> 00:03:27.339
 d company as a community and society, I believe the company is one 

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:31.319
 a nice place where you can 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:33.639
 methane fuckin talents 

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:35.459
 they 

00:03:35.459 --> 00:03:40.539
 somehow managed with passion with dedication with commitment you can give 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.009
 really the possibility so many people to prospect to hope 

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:47.009
 I believe we all have somehow 

00:03:47.689 --> 00:03:51.040
 the will to do well therefore to commit ourselves with great satisfaction 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:52.939
 work 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:54.309
 Italy 

00:03:54.309 --> 00:03:56.269
 often 

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:59.249
 they criticized me we have criticisms you mean management of companies 

00:03:59.249 --> 00:04:01.669
 industrial management so I guess it is 

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:04.969
 the idea of ​​being able to do Italy stimulates me intellectually 

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:09.920
 the company seriously competent in the professional world 

00:04:10.669 --> 00:04:12.619
 and somehow 

00:04:12.619 --> 00:04:15.729
 portal also around the world an Italy that 

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:19.219
 successful not only in the world of wedding enterprise 

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:23.619
 please do so many passions ranging from Alban sports photography 1 choose 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:25.189
 7 

00:04:25.189 --> 00:04:27.279
 so the sea is not 

00:04:27.279 --> 00:04:31.249
 legrand intellectual commitment portal - quelqu'un est à part entière company 

00:04:31.249 --> 00:04:33.999
 it is not perhaps to be paid to como 

00:04:33.999 --> 00:04:36.719
 summary 

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:39.719
 cagliari soccer 

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:50.559
 well they kill you valentina are very good so it's perfect like all those 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:51.889
 is opposed 

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:54.909
 therefore managing a team is reasoning 

00:04:54.909 --> 00:04:57.580
 on pilots' choices e 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:01.159
 has made me more than a little thought both various phases of ours 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.830
 of history I had contact with both then 

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:08.279
 many reasons 

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:11.499
 Understanding fish went in different directions I must say that 

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:14.620
 closer states fit together however competing for a team 

00:05:15.689 --> 00:05:18.689
 close to our penis with our bike last year 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:22.949
 I really hope the pilot did it 

00:05:22.949 --> 00:05:25.949
 of great things and then again f 

00:05:26.509 --> 00:05:28.889
 there are choices that are 

00:05:28.889 --> 00:05:30.210
 more complex 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:35.729
 compared to the simple somewhat admiration ookay identification of the 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.199
 person with the z will then go somehow 

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:40.949
 a week not only live album 

00:05:40.949 --> 00:05:41.969
 I go into me
