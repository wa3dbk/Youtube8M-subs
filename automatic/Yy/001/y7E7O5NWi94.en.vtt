00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.110
 bit complicated because the apple 

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.480

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.369

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.039

 ringing tone and yours and collections dane 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.140

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:00.909
 for example, in klingelton I have 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:02.649

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.860

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:07.750
 just into your music and then 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:09.610
 I just want to find it again 

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:12.210

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:15.899

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:23.560
 information and then click here 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:25.299
 options because the song may not exceed 30 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.310
 be seconds and that's why I have to 

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.460
 now here then enter that with 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.290
 the 30 second stops or even from the 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:33.969
 time of that you want because man 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.649
 if that's only from the tenth second 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:38.289
 you want to have that from one then 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:41.350
 tenths of seconds to 40 seconds to be so 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:45.189
 the song may be a maximum of 30 seconds 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:48.100
 then click ok and then go back 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.829
 with the right mouse button on it and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.390
