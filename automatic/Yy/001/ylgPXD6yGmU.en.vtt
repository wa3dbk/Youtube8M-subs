00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:18.619 
is pretty much how I do it I strapped a

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:21.670 
is pretty much how I do it I strapped a
tripod<00:01:19.220> to<00:01:19.490> my<00:01:19.640> body<00:01:19.880> and<00:01:20.119> put<00:01:20.659> the<00:01:20.899> 550d<00:01:21.470> on

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
top of it you may ask why not just use a

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.770 
top of it you may ask why not just use a
GoPro<00:01:25.009> or<00:01:25.250> anything<00:01:25.520> similar<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:26.570> the

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:26.780 
GoPro or anything similar but the

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.560 
GoPro or anything similar but the
advantage<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.680> having<00:01:27.920> camera<00:01:28.610> right<00:01:29.390> in

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:29.570 
advantage of having camera right in

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.469 
advantage of having camera right in
front<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.869> you<00:01:30.049> is<00:01:30.560> that<00:01:30.740> you<00:01:30.890> can<00:01:31.070> aim<00:01:31.479> exactly

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:32.479 
front of you is that you can aim exactly

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:37.210 
front of you is that you can aim exactly
where<00:01:32.840> you<00:01:32.960> want<00:01:35.470> it's<00:01:36.470> pretty<00:01:36.679> hard<00:01:36.950> way<00:01:37.159> to

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
where you want it's pretty hard way to

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.389 
where you want it's pretty hard way to
do<00:01:37.520> it<00:01:37.700> and<00:01:38.170> due<00:01:39.170> to<00:01:39.200> the<00:01:39.409> chrome<00:01:39.619> factor<00:01:40.070> since

00:01:40.389 --> 00:01:40.399 
do it and due to the chrome factor since

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:42.580 
do it and due to the chrome factor since
it's<00:01:40.580> not<00:01:40.700> the<00:01:40.880> full<00:01:41.030> frame<00:01:41.360> camera<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:42.500> have

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590 
it's not the full frame camera you have

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.120 
it's not the full frame camera you have
to<00:01:42.740> do<00:01:42.890> pretty<00:01:43.610> much<00:01:43.729> like<00:01:44.119> this<00:01:45.100> the<00:01:46.100> whole

Sweden<00:03:17.870> on<00:03:18.049> my<00:03:18.200> channel<00:03:18.560> when<00:03:19.069> I'm<00:03:19.189> actually

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:19.370

Sweden on my channel when I'm actually
from<00:03:19.670> Norway<00:03:20.060> the<00:03:21.049> reason<00:03:21.379> for<00:03:21.409> this<00:03:21.560> is

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:21.980 
from Norway the reason for this is

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.009 
from Norway the reason for this is
because<00:03:22.040> we<00:03:22.640> don't<00:03:22.790> have<00:03:22.970> a<00:03:23.000> real<00:03:23.359> partnership

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:24.019 
because we don't have a real partnership

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:27.339 
because we don't have a real partnership
program<00:03:24.530> in<00:03:24.709> Norway<00:03:25.129> so<00:03:26.000> in<00:03:26.269> able<00:03:26.629> to<00:03:26.810> become<00:03:27.140> a

lens<00:03:48.349> would<00:03:48.739> definitely<00:03:49.250> be<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.819> 24<00:03:50.450> to<00:03:50.659> 105<00:03:51.470> l

00:03:51.699 --> 00:03:51.709 
lens would definitely be the 24 to 105 l

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.819 
lens would definitely be the 24 to 105 l
lens<00:03:52.159> it<00:03:52.639> gives<00:03:53.599> very<00:03:54.049> sharp<00:03:54.439> and<00:03:54.620> crisp

stabilizer

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.199 

it's<00:04:07.349> probably<00:04:07.530> a<00:04:07.770> bit<00:04:07.950> overkill<00:04:08.550> to<00:04:08.790> use<00:04:09.030> this

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
it's probably a bit overkill to use this

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:11.600 
it's probably a bit overkill to use this
for<00:04:09.480> filming<00:04:09.810> only<00:04:10.260> but<00:04:10.920> if<00:04:11.040> you<00:04:11.130> also<00:04:11.310> work<00:04:11.580> a

for filming only but if you also work a

for filming only but if you also work a
lot<00:04:11.849> with<00:04:11.880> photography<00:04:12.630> this<00:04:13.170> is<00:04:13.440> a<00:04:13.470> very<00:04:13.620> good

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:14.010 
lot with photography this is a very good

all-round<00:04:14.880> lens<00:04:15.209> that<00:04:15.840> being<00:04:16.169> said<00:04:16.440> another

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
lens I've used a whole lot is also the

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.850 
lens I've used a whole lot is also the
cheapest<00:04:20.280> which<00:04:20.940> is<00:04:21.239> the<00:04:21.780> canon<00:04:22.200> 50

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860

millimeter<00:04:23.220> this<00:04:24.120> can<00:04:24.300> actually<00:04:24.419> be<00:04:24.690> quite

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:24.990 
millimeter this can actually be quite

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.890 
millimeter this can actually be quite
helpful<00:04:25.380> due<00:04:25.980> to<00:04:26.190> its<00:04:26.340> large<00:04:26.610> aperture<00:04:27.210> at<00:04:27.389> one

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
helpful due to its large aperture at one

helpful due to its large aperture at one
point<00:04:28.169> eight<00:04:28.500> which<00:04:29.280> makes<00:04:29.520> it<00:04:29.639> easier<00:04:30.030> to

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
point eight which makes it easier to

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.960 
point eight which makes it easier to
film<00:04:30.480> in<00:04:30.690> low<00:04:30.960> light<00:04:31.169> situations<00:04:31.830> of<00:04:32.070> course

film in low light situations of course

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.940 
film in low light situations of course
it<00:04:33.240> also<00:04:33.450> makes<00:04:33.750> it<00:04:33.870> harder<00:04:34.200> to<00:04:34.230> focus<00:04:34.500> that

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
it also makes it harder to focus that

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.610 
it also makes it harder to focus that
can<00:04:35.760> also<00:04:35.940> give<00:04:36.240> a<00:04:36.389> very<00:04:36.720> nice<00:04:36.960> film<00:04:37.320> attic

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:37.620 
can also give a very nice film attic

we feel me holding this imac then by

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.110 
we feel me holding this imac then by
using<00:05:18.840> after<00:05:19.530> effects<00:05:19.770> we<00:05:20.370> added<00:05:20.729> a<00:05:20.850> layer

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120 
using after effects we added a layer

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.110 
using after effects we added a layer
where<00:05:21.780> we<00:05:21.900> on<00:05:22.080> for<00:05:22.350> hand<00:05:22.620> had<00:05:22.830> filmed<00:05:23.250> and<00:05:23.370> ipad

where we on for hand had filmed and ipad
one<00:05:24.570> screen<00:05:24.930> and<00:05:25.140> put<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:25.620> on<00:05:25.770> top<00:05:25.800> of<00:05:26.190> the<00:05:26.400> imac

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
one screen and put it on top of the imac

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.330 
one screen and put it on top of the imac
oh<00:05:26.970> and<00:05:27.270> we<00:05:27.930> used<00:05:28.080> something<00:05:28.440> called<00:05:28.620> motion

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
oh and we used something called motion

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.400 
oh and we used something called motion
tracking<00:05:29.580> to<00:05:30.240> make<00:05:30.390> sure<00:05:30.600> it<00:05:30.870> was<00:05:31.080> in<00:05:31.320> the

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
tracking to make sure it was in the

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.390 
tracking to make sure it was in the
right<00:05:31.590> position<00:05:33.530> then<00:05:34.530> we<00:05:34.919> added<00:05:35.130> another

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400 
right position then we added another

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.020 
right position then we added another
layer<00:05:36.030> where<00:05:36.630> we<00:05:36.810> used<00:05:36.990> a<00:05:37.169> technique<00:05:37.350> called

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:38.030 
layer where we used a technique called

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:41.330 
layer where we used a technique called
rotoscoping<00:05:39.030> also<00:05:39.750> in<00:05:39.960> after<00:05:40.260> effects<00:05:40.620> which

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:41.340 
rotoscoping also in after effects which

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:43.850 
rotoscoping also in after effects which
made<00:05:41.760> it<00:05:41.880> look<00:05:42.060> like<00:05:42.090> my<00:05:42.660> hand<00:05:42.930> was<00:05:43.320> on<00:05:43.470> top<00:05:43.710> of

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:43.860 
made it look like my hand was on top of

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:46.070 
made it look like my hand was on top of
the<00:05:43.950> screen<00:05:44.130> yeah<00:05:44.460> and<00:05:44.760> to<00:05:45.510> get<00:05:45.630> the<00:05:45.780> sliding

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
the screen yeah and to get the sliding

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:50.230 
the screen yeah and to get the sliding
effect<00:05:46.320> we<00:05:47.100> simply<00:05:47.340> timed<00:05:48.150> it

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
effect we simply timed it

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:54.070
