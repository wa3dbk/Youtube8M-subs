consumers was the exterior coating which
not<00:00:22.260> only<00:00:22.529> made<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.830> casebook<00:00:23.039> plastic<00:00:23.760> but

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
not only made the casebook plastic but

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.980 
not only made the casebook plastic but
feel<00:00:24.539> weak<00:00:24.869> and<00:00:25.109> toy<00:00:25.800> like<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:26.820> NZXT<00:00:27.420> got<00:00:27.840> the
