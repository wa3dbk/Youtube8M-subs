00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.030
 plus 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.960
 ah 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:25.769
 did you know that the remake of the opening of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.900
 metro and prime that is in super smash 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.880
 bros road makes references to the material 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:31.880
 not used in metro and prime 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.090
 and has a small opening monologue 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:45.940
 this monologue is in fact a version 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.540
 shorter of the monologue has spoken for the 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.540
 voice of that music 

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.750
 the recording is still on the game disk 

00:01:00.829 --> 00:01:04.489
 of the metro this prime but don't 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.979
 was used to maintain the image of 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.990
 let's be like a quieter protagonist 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:10.700
 the series after more roberts has a 

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:12.830
 lot of curiosities and secrets in your 

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:15.290
 music the theme of the super smash menu 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.090
 3000 and it sounds surprisingly similar to 

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:19.390
 a segment of the horror opening and 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.390
 Clear 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.490
 but no more never came out in North America 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:35.110
 but it was published by nintendo in 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.549
 europe the first part of the theme of 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:38.530
 earth itself has a very melody 

00:01:36.549 --> 00:01:40.509
 similar to the one used in the opening of milk 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:42.399
 and so maybe then the composer of 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.500
 milly was inspired by the soundtrack of 

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:46.750
 said title the music of the area of 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.000
 Rest in star mode is a remake 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.670
 of the subject of the safe area of ​​the stage 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.439
 great offensive game key write 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.659
 super star also a game mode 

00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:56.770
 probably based on a new line 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.899
 of writing superstar 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.340
 given that in both the player chesed against 

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:02.319
 a random number of enemies 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.360
 finishing off with a consistent opponent 

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:06.130
 final both modes show what the 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:07.720
 players are going to face each other and in both 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:09.910
 there are rest areas where the 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:11.950
 players can restore their health in 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.680
 the remastering of kill bill kirby 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.019
 super star ultra for nintendo ds la 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.390
 same music is used in the area of 

00:02:17.019 --> 00:02:21.519
 rest between the combat sands what 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.530
 same as emily taking advantage of that we are 

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:25.930
 talking about Kirby the music of 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:28.540
 source scenario of dreams is a 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.450
 remastered and orchestrated version of 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.700
 gourmet theme erase this remix was used 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.460
 in kill bill nighy in dreamland during 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.170
 the battle against with diddy 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.570
 the source of dreams in certain 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.520
 sense had already been recognized as the 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.560
 source theme of dreams since 

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.390
 knight mary ann dreamland came out a year 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:46.830
 after the release of emily and it's 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:48.840
 sure to assume that both games 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.820
 they were in development at the same time 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.860
 the stage and the song probably 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:55.080
 they added to me as a teaser of 

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:56.760
 next kirby game this was not the 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:58.650
 only time that nintendo showed 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.990
 content of super smash roll is for 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.460
 promote another roy franchise was included 

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:05.100
 in a thousand and as a playable character 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:07.230
 even before appearing in a game of 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:09.630
 fire emblem this was done to promote 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:12.030
 the next fire emblem launch in 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.590
 japan the presence of marc and roy in milk 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.540
 increased the interest of 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.070
 players by fire emblem level 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:19.710
 World prompting the games 

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:21.930
 internationally launched from 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.460
 the seventh installment onwards content 

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.740
 from the series of super smash games 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.810
 roberts has also been used in others 

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:30.480
 games the voice of mario of his movement 

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:32.850
 special down was used in mario 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.650
 vs donkey kong of the game boy advance this 

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.900
 is the only occasion when the voice of a 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.060
 character of super smash waters has been 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.860
 re used in a game that has nothing 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.100
 what to do with the series what results 

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:43.100
 interesting 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:49.080
 originally it would be recycled 164 as 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:51.930
 they finished recording the voice of don king 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.670
 compared to 64 attempts he requested that 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.530
 the same sounds will be reused in 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.849
 mili but like the first title 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.590
 of super smash players the 

00:03:56.849 --> 00:04:00.930
 developers decided to give him something 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.050
 with more realistic gorilla grunts 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.849
 so that they fit the game better if 

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:08.250
 in super smash robert schmilling changes 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.170
 the language of the game to Japanese youtube 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:11.910
 I will speak four sentences for some of 

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:13.739
 his four poses of victories when the 

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.420
 game is in english on youtube only 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:18.889
 laughs his poses of victories but in 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.889
 Japanese yuto says 

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:28.200
 similarly changing the language of 

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:30.090
 thousands of Japanese for Falco to speak 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.540
 during their teasing when the game is 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.729
 in English 

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:35.360
 falco simply makes fun while 

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:35.360
 Japanese will say 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:43.050
 when it was to govern the fight in Japanese 

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.700
 also says eric suit mart and roy talk 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.740
 in Japanese even if the language of 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.480
 game is set to English so what 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.100
 they say goes unnoticed by the 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:52.230
 players who speak English or other 

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:53.760
 languages ​​although Ruiz does not speak during his 

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:58.070
 teasing has three lines for their 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.070
 victories today says recited calla 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:05.840
 and marc is more emotional than roy and if he speaks 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:07.460
 during their teasing and during the 

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:10.250
 execution of his special movement 

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:12.650
 down mark and you read half and 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.170
 tiger while doing the special counter 

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:17.720
 mart will say his face 

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.000
 sacyr and nun marta also has three 

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:22.640
 possible victory phrases that express 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.100
 with fall because they are not as ginobili 

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:26.900
 putting the amateur box track and 

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:29.150
 Latin American in having petite 

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.120
 debugging emily sea ​​has more phrases 

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:34.130
 he says straight lines probably he 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.200
 discarded to burn will only speak 

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:38.060
 Japanese for when my book too 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:39.770
 come out no only dance game in 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:41.390
 well it is well located to marta for 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.220
 North America this is maybe to see why 

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.020
 nintendo did not translate the dialogues of 

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:47.240
 English, a detail that changed during the 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.950
 location of the first super the oldest 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.260
 it was the special effect of the sword 

00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:53.390
 laser the laser sword sounded as if 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:55.490
 you were waving a saber of the saga 

00:05:53.390 --> 00:05:57.410
 star wars the special effect was changed 

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:59.370
 to avoid problems for rights of 

00:05:57.410 --> 00:06:01.380
 Author 

00:05:59.370 --> 00:06:03.240
 previously we had mentioned that 

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:05.520
 some trophies have references or 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.100
 hidden things but there are some other 

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.139
 that were left out for example the 

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.570
 reflection of the metal part of the briefcase 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:14.669
 of ayumi is shaped like a cat and 

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:17.699
 Reflection of the kivi game trophy has 

00:06:14.669 --> 00:06:20.460
 a relief shaped baby face 

00:06:17.699 --> 00:06:23.010
 trophy of doctor stuart jordi summers and 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:25.440
 the tank the master use as a reflection 

00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:27.780
 this image which is a capture of 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.630
 screen of a game canceled art 

00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:32.699
 bound for the nintendo 64 bizarrely 

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:34.590
 there is an image of a gun in the 

00:06:32.699 --> 00:06:37.530
 trophy texture of feather gun 

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:39.120
 it seems to be a rifle r the texture of the 

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:41.370
 Roy's sword has some textures 

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.470
 hidden in which you can read the 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:45.510
 laboratory some other details not 

00:06:43.470 --> 00:06:48.360
 seen is that instead of mister del 

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.720
 water be just a spray plane actually 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:54.539
