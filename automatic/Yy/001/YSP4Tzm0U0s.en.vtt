00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.629
 welcome people this is new video again 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.940
 on my channel 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:09.030
 and this is again that lives rimmert 

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:11.010
 video I would like a live winter car 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:15.240
 again nice video to the only problem it 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:17.279
 in the problem of course that is 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.640
 file does not want to cooperate anymore 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.670
 reason the web cam file suddenly appears 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.590
 no more loading in adam who tries 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.539
 red hair is that the file is on anyway 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.060
 first and foremost I could do that 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 So there giving work to them and I 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.780
 I couldn't make it a find yet 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.309
 wait a day and upload I thought so 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 that all this cool video is the reason why 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.140
 that is until I have a procession very much 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.020
 input let frenchers my argument 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.430
 fight half siebe writers 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.590
 go for paul the elliot but really then 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.350
 150 comments when I asked for balotelli 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:52.469
 wing forest grows sick movies 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.500
 and the other players as well as me 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:58.949
 I show you have achieved and I speak 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.609
 just sort out the luxor grass in that 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.049
 the cpu so many players 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.390
 and yes that was from below 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:09.390
 but I so then then so does this and 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.450
 This knight will also do longer 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.220
 also because I am indeed becoming more interactive 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.590
 want to keep because I think it's a 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.210
 nice idea for people to say what 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.070
 have a choice because if I suggest 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.830
 cheap ego people i know i know 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.390
 not that boring so i keep the original 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.490
 purchases and therefore seeks people too 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.950
 very often give their opinion of 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.630
 who will I pick up leaf then takes 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.890
 and sometimes right names come from which 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.350
 I think I'd never used that 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.610
 so often have a good idea 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.630
 my days do not even have this video 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.100
 because no yes I have a troll more I have 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.210
 also in side effects because I have to go fast 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.149
 because I have today 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.329
 first because I flat or I have 30 minutes 

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.950
 I have an appointment with an optician that is 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.140
 so before i go i want to go we are 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.880
 ordinary glasses therefore mainly take over 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.470
 independently close I always see fine 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.530
 but the distance is still common 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.880
 me and go so becomes the tape 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.570
 orthopedically I believe it was one 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.240
 very good plan 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.689
 remember duty no idea but in case 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.080
 about a couple of hund it already takes something 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.340
 from three o'clock and first go kind 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.319
 ribs may do it 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.300
 care dog with all my eye 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:16.620
 apparently such a thing that normal 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.360
 spoken you just look both eyes 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.680
 at the same time where my eyes from here century 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.840
 was so I have my right eye 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:23.489
 for example better than my left and 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.920
 then you often notice that first my 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:27.629
 right eye so quickly teach viewers 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.940
 i never look the same at the height 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.560
 I look to the actual but immediate eye 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.330
 depending on where i am going i can 

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.709
 for example left and right already 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.920
 Quickly changes that I don't look mine 

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:40.500
 arrows and they otherwise behaved 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.180
 so they give my eyes some what 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.709
 difficult short distance and that they are 

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:45.540
 I ca n't say that about my 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.860
 cannot compensate so then can 

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.120
 they measure my strength better no 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:49.739
 probably your glasses i have a brother 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.870
 I found that is pretty fat 

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:54.480
 themselves and other people could too 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:57.060
 tenders the hot hot yes I have it 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.590
 maybe as if you were the sometimes 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.900
 purely there maybe i see live crew we i 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.519
 look small eyes and there you can 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.590
 maybe it would be finished 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:06.510
 be nice because it is I really need it 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.980
 with studio you will just notice 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:09.420
 things that are in the back of the cyclists 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.810
 with even more for colleagues and that kind 

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.000
 Affairs 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.620
 so i have maybe you can wear glasses 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.849
 maybe more video about vlog or 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.709
 something in that direction 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:18.720
 but what is 4 mostly about and that 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.739
 is also the title is I have a guest role 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.359

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.590

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:40.470
