00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
a really heavy project it measures about

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:16.289 
a really heavy project it measures about
oh<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:13.780> need<00:01:13.990> about<00:01:14.110> 7<00:01:14.619> inches<00:01:14.799> tall<00:01:15.090> 7<00:01:16.090> inches

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:16.299 
oh I need about 7 inches tall 7 inches

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:21.719 
oh I need about 7 inches tall 7 inches
wide<00:01:16.540> and<00:01:17.340> 7<00:01:18.340> inches<00:01:19.320> depth<00:01:20.320> so<00:01:20.619> it's<00:01:20.770> about<00:01:21.100> 7

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:21.729 
wide and 7 inches depth so it's about 7

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.890 
wide and 7 inches depth so it's about 7
by<00:01:21.850> 7<00:01:21.909> by<00:01:22.240> 7<00:01:22.479> so<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.590> is<00:01:23.619> huge<00:01:24.310> it<00:01:24.549> is<00:01:24.640> heavy<00:01:25.570> and

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
by 7 by 7 so it is huge it is heavy and

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:32.040 
by 7 by 7 so it is huge it is heavy and
it<00:01:26.470> is<00:01:27.810> absolute<00:01:28.980> pleasure<00:01:29.980> to<00:01:30.550> go<00:01:30.910> through<00:01:31.240> so

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
it is absolute pleasure to go through so

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.950 
it is absolute pleasure to go through so
why<00:01:32.920> I<00:01:32.950> say<00:01:33.280> that<00:01:33.460> is<00:01:33.700> it<00:01:33.910> has<00:01:34.090> 40<00:01:34.510> separate

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
why I say that is it has 40 separate

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.680 
why I say that is it has 40 separate
tags<00:01:35.200> at<00:01:35.590> each<00:01:35.770> of<00:01:35.890> the<00:01:35.950> tag<00:01:36.160> on<00:01:36.520> the<00:01:37.210> front<00:01:37.510> and

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:37.690 
tags at each of the tag on the front and

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:39.480 
tags at each of the tag on the front and
the<00:01:37.750> back<00:01:37.780> is<00:01:38.230> lined<00:01:38.470> with<00:01:38.560> paper<00:01:38.800> and<00:01:39.159> that's

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:39.490 
the back is lined with paper and that's

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.890 
the back is lined with paper and that's
another<00:01:39.700> reason<00:01:39.940> why<00:01:40.180> it's<00:01:40.270> really<00:01:40.420> heavy<00:01:40.659> and

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:40.900 
another reason why it's really heavy and

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.470 
another reason why it's really heavy and
it<00:01:40.990> has<00:01:41.470> photo<00:01:42.130> of<00:01:42.250> the<00:01:42.370> person<00:01:42.790> who<00:01:43.360> the
