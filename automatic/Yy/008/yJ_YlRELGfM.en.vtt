and<00:00:07.859> this<00:00:08.100> fits<00:00:08.460> were<00:00:08.700> like<00:00:09.090> the

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:10.680 
and this fits were like the

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:13.900 
and this fits were like the
hundreds<00:00:11.220> example<00:00:11.790> like

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:13.910 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.690 

how<00:00:14.210> do<00:00:14.269> they<00:00:14.540> know<00:00:14.570> they<00:00:14.990> don't<00:00:15.110> look<00:00:15.290> back

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:15.700 
how do they know they don't look back

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.640 
how do they know they don't look back
and<00:00:16.700> if<00:00:17.180> they<00:00:17.330> still<00:00:17.570> know<00:00:17.750> how<00:00:18.350> they<00:00:18.590> should

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:18.650 
and if they still know how they should

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:25.570 
and if they still know how they should
move<00:00:18.920> yes<00:00:19.490> what<00:00:20.180> did<00:00:20.450> the<00:00:20.570> birds<00:00:20.840> or<00:00:21.170> whatever

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:25.580 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:28.620 

I

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:28.630 

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.700 

what<00:00:29.589> it<00:00:29.890> doesn't<00:00:30.189> use<00:00:30.310> mirror<00:00:30.609> as<00:00:31.000> an<00:00:31.029> ear<00:00:31.710> but

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
what it doesn't use mirror as an ear but

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.470 
what it doesn't use mirror as an ear but
you<00:00:32.860> can<00:00:33.040> say<00:00:33.219> this<00:00:33.430> is<00:00:33.610> all<00:00:33.760> you<00:00:34.000> can<00:00:34.149> always

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:34.480 
you can say this is all you can always

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:36.840 
you can say this is all you can always
just<00:00:34.690> explain<00:00:35.140> very<00:00:35.410> simply<00:00:35.469> this<00:00:35.920> chemistry

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:36.850 
just explain very simply this chemistry

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.210 
just explain very simply this chemistry
like<00:00:37.239> you<00:00:37.390> can<00:00:37.570> say<00:00:37.750> there's<00:00:38.290> a<00:00:38.379> hormone<00:00:39.040> that

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
like you can say there's a hormone that

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.160 
like you can say there's a hormone that
he<00:00:39.399> sends<00:00:39.730> out<00:00:39.879> and<00:00:40.210> it's<00:00:40.660> just<00:00:40.930> another

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
he sends out and it's just another

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:43.170 
he sends out and it's just another
hormone<00:00:41.440> in<00:00:41.800> eggs<00:00:42.040> so<00:00:42.550> he<00:00:42.640> doesn't<00:00:42.850> know<00:00:43.030> how

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
hormone in eggs so he doesn't know how

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
hormone in eggs so he doesn't know how
he<00:00:43.239> looks<00:00:43.570> or<00:00:43.780> what<00:00:43.930> he's<00:00:44.140> attracting<00:00:44.879> like

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
he looks or what he's attracting like

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.819 
he looks or what he's attracting like
like<00:00:47.739> like<00:00:48.699> many<00:00:49.629> many<00:00:50.079> animals<00:00:50.530> don't<00:00:50.650> have

00:00:50.819 --> 00:00:50.829 
like like many many animals don't have

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:53.579 
like like many many animals don't have
any<00:00:51.070> eyes<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.670> they<00:00:51.760> still<00:00:52.089> attract<00:00:52.690> each

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:53.589 
any eyes and they still attract each

00:00:53.589 --> 00:01:00.140 
any eyes and they still attract each
other<00:00:53.829> yes

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.990 

when<00:01:01.150> they're<00:01:01.360> all<00:01:01.510> sharing<00:01:01.810> because

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
when they're all sharing because

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.600 
when they're all sharing because
yeah<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.019> this<00:01:05.170> is<00:01:05.350> all<00:01:05.650> this<00:01:05.890> quantum<00:01:06.460> this

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
yeah but this is all this quantum this

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.260 
yeah but this is all this quantum this
quantum<00:01:07.060> stuff<00:01:07.330> see<00:01:10.560> yes<00:01:11.729> but<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:12.910> see<00:01:12.940> this

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
quantum stuff see yes but you see this

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:15.690 
quantum stuff see yes but you see this
is<00:01:13.330> this<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.960> the<00:01:14.110> thing<00:01:14.320> is<00:01:14.500> when<00:01:15.190> when<00:01:15.550> they

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
is this is the thing is when when they

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.930 
is this is the thing is when when they
all<00:01:16.150> call<00:01:16.420> their<00:01:16.660> systems<00:01:17.170> now<00:01:17.320> quantum

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:17.940 
all call their systems now quantum

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.130 
all call their systems now quantum
mechanical<00:01:18.940> or<00:01:19.090> quantum<00:01:19.950> devices<00:01:21.960> this<00:01:22.960> is

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
mechanical or quantum devices this is

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.480 
mechanical or quantum devices this is
jay<00:01:23.320> and<00:01:23.560> then<00:01:23.650> you<00:01:23.740> asked<00:01:24.070> what<00:01:24.250> means

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
jay and then you asked what means

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:28.440 
jay and then you asked what means
quantum<00:01:25.119> actually<00:01:25.540> yes<00:01:26.910> well<00:01:27.910> then<00:01:28.090> they<00:01:28.240> give

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
quantum actually yes well then they give

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.010 
quantum actually yes well then they give
some<00:01:28.979> very<00:01:29.979> exotic<00:01:30.420> experiment<00:01:31.420> of<00:01:31.600> somebody

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
some very exotic experiment of somebody

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.170 
some very exotic experiment of somebody
did<00:01:32.290> 10<00:01:32.500> years<00:01:32.530> ago<00:01:32.860> that<00:01:33.250> they<00:01:33.400> had<00:01:33.520> a<00:01:33.550> photon

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
did 10 years ago that they had a photon

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.600 
did 10 years ago that they had a photon
here<00:01:34.570> they<00:01:35.500> changed<00:01:35.920> the<00:01:36.040> spin<00:01:36.250> of<00:01:36.310> this

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
here they changed the spin of this

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.460 
here they changed the spin of this
photon<00:01:36.910> and<00:01:37.210> they<00:01:37.420> could<00:01:37.690> maybe<00:01:38.110> somehow

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
photon and they could maybe somehow

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.100 
photon and they could maybe somehow
measure<00:01:38.860> they'll<00:01:39.610> change<00:01:39.910> to<00:01:40.149> spin<00:01:40.450> thousand

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:41.110 
measure they'll change to spin thousand

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.370 
measure they'll change to spin thousand
miles<00:01:41.290> away<00:01:41.850> but<00:01:42.850> why<00:01:43.030> do<00:01:43.090> we<00:01:43.360> use<00:01:43.630> this<00:01:44.080> kind

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
miles away but why do we use this kind

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.650 
miles away but why do we use this kind
of<00:01:44.530> exotic<00:01:44.950> examples<00:01:45.850> for<00:01:46.000> something<00:01:46.420> that<00:01:46.540> we

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:46.660 
of exotic examples for something that we

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.490 
of exotic examples for something that we
see<00:01:46.840> everywhere<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.560> with<00:01:48.220> our<00:01:48.340> own<00:01:48.610> eyes<00:01:48.820> that

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
see everywhere on with our own eyes that

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.650 
see everywhere on with our own eyes that
fishes<00:01:50.500> move<00:01:50.729> all<00:01:51.729> together<00:01:52.030> in<00:01:52.360> the<00:01:52.479> same

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:52.660 
fishes move all together in the same

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:54.120 
fishes move all together in the same
move<00:01:52.899> when<00:01:53.080> they<00:01:53.170> make<00:01:53.350> it<00:01:53.530> make<00:01:53.830> a<00:01:53.860> right

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.130 
move when they make it make a right

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:57.719 
move when they make it make a right
movement<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:55.360> together<00:01:55.810> or<00:01:56.250> these<00:01:57.250> examples

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:57.729 
movement all together or these examples

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.510 
movement all together or these examples
about<00:01:58.180> us<00:01:58.920> that<00:01:59.920> our<00:02:00.210> future<00:02:01.210> is<00:02:01.479> predictable

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
about us that our future is predictable

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.760 
about us that our future is predictable
just<00:02:03.520> as<00:02:03.670> it<00:02:03.850> as<00:02:04.420> photons<00:02:04.899> are<00:02:05.080> predictable

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:05.770 
just as it as photons are predictable

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.699 
just as it as photons are predictable
that<00:02:06.399> we<00:02:06.610> know<00:02:06.789> if<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.660> are<00:02:07.780> part<00:02:08.110> of<00:02:08.290> the<00:02:08.470> group

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
that we know if we are part of the group

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:14.070 
that we know if we are part of the group
we<00:02:09.640> will<00:02:09.850> die<00:02:10.830> with<00:02:11.830> this<00:02:12.070> prediction<00:02:13.080> River

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
we will die with this prediction River

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.210 
we will die with this prediction River
you<00:02:14.680> will<00:02:14.830> have<00:02:14.980> this<00:02:16.769> likelihood<00:02:17.769> of<00:02:18.040> having

you will have this likelihood of having

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:20.039 
you will have this likelihood of having
a<00:02:18.459> heart<00:02:18.640> attack<00:02:18.730> this<00:02:19.209> likelihood<00:02:19.630> of<00:02:19.900> for

having a this kind of disease our future
is<00:02:22.900> completely<00:02:23.530> predictable<00:02:24.180> so<00:02:25.180> we<00:02:25.299> don't

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
is completely predictable so we don't

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:27.720 
is completely predictable so we don't
have<00:02:25.600> to<00:02:25.810> think<00:02:26.500> about<00:02:26.590> quantum<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.489> and

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
have to think about quantum and and

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:31.470 
have to think about quantum and and
there<00:02:28.450> and<00:02:29.049> the<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.370> photons<00:02:30.880> we<00:02:31.120> can<00:02:31.299> see

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
there and the the photons we can see

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.240 
there and the the photons we can see
this<00:02:31.600> everywhere<00:02:31.930> in<00:02:32.200> our<00:02:32.320> life<00:02:32.560> and<00:02:32.829> then

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:33.250 
this everywhere in our life and then

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:36.870 
this everywhere in our life and then
it's<00:02:33.430> more<00:02:33.640> it's<00:02:34.150> more<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:35.880> threatening

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
it's more it's more really threatening

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.600 
it's more it's more really threatening
because<00:02:37.209> then<00:02:37.750> we<00:02:38.140> can<00:02:38.290> ask<00:02:38.560> the<00:02:39.040> question<00:02:39.459> how

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
because then we can ask the question how

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:42.990 
because then we can ask the question how
can<00:02:39.790> we<00:02:39.910> get<00:02:40.090> out<00:02:40.269> of<00:02:40.420> this<00:02:41.579> because<00:02:42.579> this<00:02:42.940> is

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 
can we get out of this because this is

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.830 
can we get out of this because this is
Einstein<00:02:43.959> was<00:02:44.920> really<00:02:45.190> a<00:02:45.400> Newtonian<00:02:46.360> thinker

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:49.540 
he said quantum mechanics is another

he said quantum mechanics is another
science<00:02:50.049> he<00:02:50.860> didn't<00:02:51.160> like<00:02:51.280> quantum<00:02:51.579> mechanics

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
why until his death he said it's not a

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:00.210 
why until his death he said it's not a
science<00:02:55.959> why

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:00.220 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.830 

because<00:03:01.220> he<00:03:01.520> said<00:03:03.340> you<00:03:04.340> first<00:03:04.670> of<00:03:04.820> all<00:03:05.000> he<00:03:05.600> said

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
because he said you first of all he said

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
universe like a clock we can say in 10

universe like a clock we can say in 10
million<00:03:46.820> years<00:03:47.060> where<00:03:47.570> will<00:03:47.720> be<00:03:47.750> the<00:03:47.900> small

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:48.350 
million years where will be the small

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.940 
million years where will be the small
and<00:03:48.770> the<00:03:48.830> above<00:03:49.760> is<00:03:50.060> the<00:03:50.209> large<00:03:50.950> indicator

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950 
and the above is the large indicator

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.570 
and the above is the large indicator
beyond<00:03:52.310> this<00:03:52.459> clock<00:03:52.840> any<00:03:53.840> part<00:03:54.290> so<00:03:54.830> ein<00:03:55.280> Schein

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:55.580 
beyond this clock any part so ein Schein

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.090 
beyond this clock any part so ein Schein
was<00:03:55.760> really<00:03:56.000> very<00:03:56.480> backward<00:03:57.020> in<00:03:57.320> many<00:03:57.800> parts

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
was really very backward in many parts

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.530 
was really very backward in many parts
and<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:01.070> now<00:04:01.310> for<00:04:01.580> us<00:04:02.000> is<00:04:02.209> really<00:04:02.480> interesting

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and so now for us is really interesting

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.550 
and so now for us is really interesting
that<00:04:05.540> when<00:04:06.019> we<00:04:06.230> do<00:04:06.440> an<00:04:06.560> analysis<00:04:08.260> we<00:04:09.260> really

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:09.560 
that when we do an analysis we really

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:13.720 
that when we do an analysis we really
make<00:04:09.769> an<00:04:09.890> analysis<00:04:10.580> that<00:04:11.170> is<00:04:12.170> statistics<00:04:13.100> so

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:13.730 
make an analysis that is statistics so

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:16.930 
make an analysis that is statistics so
we<00:04:13.910> give<00:04:14.090> a<00:04:14.170> probability<00:04:15.340> so<00:04:16.340> what<00:04:16.519> you<00:04:16.669> see

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
we give a probability so what you see

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:20.860 
we give a probability so what you see
here<00:04:16.970> is<00:04:17.709> not<00:04:18.790> even<00:04:19.790> let's<00:04:20.030> say<00:04:20.090> cancer<00:04:20.630> comes

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:20.870 
here is not even let's say cancer comes

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:25.030 
here is not even let's say cancer comes
up<00:04:21.580> it's<00:04:22.580> a<00:04:22.820> probability<00:04:23.660> for<00:04:24.169> what<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.860> the

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
up it's a probability for what that the

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.570 
up it's a probability for what that the
person<00:04:25.460> has<00:04:25.640> it<00:04:25.820> or<00:04:26.000> has<00:04:26.180> it<00:04:26.330> not<00:04:27.250> it<00:04:28.250> just

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:28.580 
person has it or has it not it just

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:30.760 
person has it or has it not it just
shows<00:04:28.850> a<00:04:28.880> probability<00:04:29.840> for<00:04:30.169> a<00:04:30.200> resonance

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:33.909 
shows a probability for a resonance
factor<00:04:31.310> like<00:04:31.580> a<00:04:31.790> resonance<00:04:32.390> is<00:04:32.540> dead<00:04:32.840> which<00:04:33.560> it

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
factor like a resonance is dead which it

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.040 
factor like a resonance is dead which it
makes<00:04:34.490> you<00:04:34.700> attract<00:04:35.150> the<00:04:35.630> things<00:04:35.870> in<00:04:36.020> your

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
life if you don't resonate to cancer you

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.170 
life if you don't resonate to cancer you
will<00:04:39.050> never<00:04:39.320> get<00:04:39.620> it<00:04:39.770> if<00:04:40.310> you<00:04:40.370> don't<00:04:40.910> resonate

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:41.180 
will never get it if you don't resonate

will never get it if you don't resonate

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:45.740 
to the letter A you never can hear it

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:48.850 
to the letter A you never can hear it
like<00:04:46.700> in<00:04:46.850> India<00:04:47.210> I<00:04:47.240> was<00:04:47.450> often<00:04:47.810> they<00:04:48.710> have

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
like in India I was often they have

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.700 
like in India I was often they have
different<00:04:49.430> types<00:04:49.910> of<00:04:50.090> B

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:52.710 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:57.960 

so<00:04:53.710> in<00:04:54.669> their<00:04:54.910> language<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.540> so<00:04:55.750> I<00:04:56.110> I<00:04:57.040> could

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:57.970 
so in their language and so I I could

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:00.810 
so in their language and so I I could
not<00:04:58.150> hear<00:04:58.389> it<00:04:58.419> I<00:04:58.660> said<00:04:59.080> repeat<00:04:59.979> and<00:05:00.250> this<00:05:00.340> you

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:00.820 
not hear it I said repeat and this you

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:02.250 
not hear it I said repeat and this you
can't<00:05:01.180> you<00:05:01.300> hear<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:01.540> difference<00:05:01.930> that<00:05:02.020> they

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:02.260 
can't you hear the difference that they

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:05.250 
can't you hear the difference that they
repeated<00:05:02.800> the<00:05:02.830> same<00:05:03.100> two<00:05:03.630> sounds<00:05:04.630> yes<00:05:04.870> from<00:05:05.050> my

repeated the same two sounds yes from my
ear<00:05:05.590> I<00:05:05.740> said<00:05:06.130> I<00:05:06.310> cannot<00:05:06.729> hear<00:05:06.910> different<00:05:07.330> but

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:07.690 
ear I said I cannot hear different but

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:09.300 
ear I said I cannot hear different but
is<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.960> this<00:05:08.080> one<00:05:08.229> means<00:05:08.500> banana<00:05:08.889> this<00:05:09.160> other

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
is it this one means banana this other

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.400 
is it this one means banana this other
means<00:05:09.810> what<00:05:10.810> not<00:05:11.020> yes<00:05:12.510> why<00:05:13.510> because<00:05:14.020> I<00:05:14.050> don't

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:14.410 
means what not yes why because I don't

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:16.920 
means what not yes why because I don't
resonate<00:05:14.590> to<00:05:15.010> this<00:05:15.160> I<00:05:15.340> cannot<00:05:15.669> hear<00:05:15.940> it<00:05:16.060> so<00:05:16.900> I

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:16.930 
resonate to this I cannot hear it so I

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.719 
resonate to this I cannot hear it so I
say<00:05:17.229> all<00:05:17.470> for<00:05:17.800> example<00:05:18.100> I<00:05:18.130> pointed<00:05:18.610> at

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:18.729 
say all for example I pointed at

00:05:18.729 --> 00:05:20.760 
say all for example I pointed at
something<00:05:19.150> and<00:05:19.600> I<00:05:19.750> said<00:05:19.870> I<00:05:20.020> want<00:05:20.199> this<00:05:20.350> banana

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
something and I said I want this banana

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.650 
something and I said I want this banana
and<00:05:21.130> they<00:05:21.280> speak<00:05:21.490> English<00:05:21.880> everybody<00:05:22.389> speaks

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:22.660 
and they speak English everybody speaks

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.330 
and they speak English everybody speaks
English<00:05:22.780> i<00:05:23.050> said<00:05:23.260> i<00:05:23.350> want<00:05:23.530> this<00:05:23.620> banana<00:05:23.979> and<00:05:24.220> he

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:24.340 
English i said i want this banana and he

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.060 
English i said i want this banana and he
was<00:05:24.520> not<00:05:24.729> reacting<00:05:25.440> it<00:05:26.440> was<00:05:26.560> just<00:05:26.710> not<00:05:26.889> moving

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.070 
was not reacting it was just not moving

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:31.140 
was not reacting it was just not moving
I<00:05:27.370> said<00:05:27.610> I<00:05:27.760> want<00:05:28.120> this<00:05:28.240> banana<00:05:28.919> no<00:05:29.919> reaction<00:05:30.400> so

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
I said I want this banana no reaction so

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.650 
I said I want this banana no reaction so
why<00:05:31.750> because<00:05:32.460> this<00:05:33.460> was<00:05:33.699> not<00:05:33.880> a<00:05:33.910> banana<00:05:34.330> plane

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
why because this was not a banana plane

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:37.170 
why because this was not a banana plane
this<00:05:34.960> was<00:05:35.139> another<00:05:35.440> yet<00:05:36.280> another<00:05:36.550> word<00:05:36.940> for

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:37.180 
this was another yet another word for

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.070 
this was another yet another word for
this<00:05:37.270> because<00:05:37.389> they<00:05:37.660> have<00:05:37.780> certainty

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:38.080 
this because they have certainty

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.230 
this because they have certainty
different<00:05:38.440> bananas<00:05:38.889> so<00:05:39.639> this<00:05:39.850> was<00:05:40.060> not<00:05:40.210> a

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:40.240 
different bananas so this was not a

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.960 
different bananas so this was not a
banana<00:05:40.600> so<00:05:41.560> he<00:05:41.680> did<00:05:41.860> not<00:05:42.010> react<00:05:42.340> he<00:05:42.699> didn't

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:42.970 
banana so he did not react he didn't

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:45.240 
banana so he did not react he didn't
hear<00:05:43.180> it<00:05:43.210> he<00:05:44.080> did<00:05:44.380> not<00:05:44.410> hear<00:05:44.889> if<00:05:45.010> you<00:05:45.130> see

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
hear it he did not hear if you see

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.750 
hear it he did not hear if you see
that's<00:05:45.430> the<00:05:45.580> interesting<00:05:45.820> thing<00:05:46.150> is<00:05:46.180> if<00:05:46.630> you

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:47.760 
that's the interesting thing is if you

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:49.920 
that's the interesting thing is if you
informational<00:05:48.760> II<00:05:48.910> don't<00:05:49.180> resonate<00:05:49.419> to

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:49.930 
informational II don't resonate to

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:51.300 
informational II don't resonate to
another<00:05:50.169> concept<00:05:50.620> you<00:05:50.800> don't<00:05:51.010> hear<00:05:51.280> it

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:51.310 
another concept you don't hear it

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:53.580 
another concept you don't hear it
energetically<00:05:52.150> that's<00:05:53.139> the<00:05:53.320> interesting

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:53.590 
energetically that's the interesting

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:56.089 
energetically that's the interesting
thing<00:05:53.919> you<00:05:54.070> talked<00:05:54.340> to<00:05:54.639> your<00:05:55.090> children<00:05:55.150> say

00:05:56.089 --> 00:05:56.099 
thing you talked to your children say

00:05:56.099 --> 00:06:01.379 
thing you talked to your children say
please<00:05:57.099> make<00:05:57.760> up<00:05:57.940> your<00:05:57.970> bed<00:05:58.750> and<00:05:59.910> they<00:06:00.910> just<00:06:01.150> do

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:01.389 
please make up your bed and they just do

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:03.270 
please make up your bed and they just do
as<00:06:01.539> if<00:06:01.720> they<00:06:02.500> have<00:06:02.590> not<00:06:02.710> heard<00:06:02.979> it<00:06:03.160> and

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:03.280 
as if they have not heard it and

00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.370 
as if they have not heard it and

actually they have not heard it that's

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.080 
actually they have not heard it that's
the<00:06:05.590> amazing<00:06:05.919> thing<00:06:06.160> this<00:06:06.430> is<00:06:06.610> the<00:06:06.729> connection

00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:07.090 
the amazing thing this is the connection

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.140 
the amazing thing this is the connection
between<00:06:07.240> information<00:06:07.870> energy<00:06:08.760> if<00:06:09.760> you<00:06:09.970> don't

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:10.150 
between information energy if you don't

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.820 
between information energy if you don't
resonate<00:06:10.560> information<00:06:11.560> into<00:06:11.950> a<00:06:12.010> concept<00:06:13.830> it's

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:14.830 
resonate information into a concept it's

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:16.440 
resonate information into a concept it's
not<00:06:15.039> that<00:06:15.250> you<00:06:15.370> can<00:06:15.520> do<00:06:15.639> what<00:06:15.789> did<00:06:16.120> you<00:06:16.270> not

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:16.450 
not that you can do what did you not

increase<00:06:23.320> does<00:06:23.530> not<00:06:23.710> help<00:06:23.949> why<00:06:24.849> because<00:06:25.690> you

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:25.960 
increase does not help why because you

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:28.589 
increase does not help why because you

healer has to be good in to find how to

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:36.180 
healer has to be good in to find how to

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:36.190 
formulate the information to the person

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.960 
formulate the information to the person
resonates<00:06:36.639> if<00:06:37.060> I<00:06:37.270> say<00:06:37.479> what<00:06:37.810> your<00:06:38.289> problem<00:06:38.860> is

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:38.970 
resonates if I say what your problem is

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:43.200 
resonates if I say what your problem is
eating<00:06:39.970> too<00:06:40.150> much<00:06:40.860> what<00:06:41.860> what<00:06:42.370> how<00:06:42.820> much<00:06:43.030> do

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:43.210 
eating too much what what how much do

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.010 
eating too much what what how much do
you<00:06:43.300> think<00:06:43.360> how<00:06:43.539> much<00:06:43.780> effect<00:06:44.320> will<00:06:44.560> this<00:06:44.590> have

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:46.020 
you think how much effect will this have

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:49.200 
you think how much effect will this have
zero<00:06:47.020> why<00:06:47.889> because<00:06:48.310> they<00:06:48.460> know<00:06:48.580> it<00:06:48.729> himself

00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:49.210 
zero why because they know it himself

00:06:49.210 --> 00:06:51.300 
zero why because they know it himself
they<00:06:49.570> have<00:06:49.690> a<00:06:49.720> problem<00:06:49.960> is<00:06:50.229> this<00:06:50.500> evening<00:06:50.919> most

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:51.310 
they have a problem is this evening most

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:52.590 
they have a problem is this evening most
most<00:06:51.669> of<00:06:51.789> the<00:06:51.849> time<00:06:52.060> as

00:06:52.590 --> 00:06:52.600 
most of the time as

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:54.690 
most of the time as
so<00:06:53.260> you<00:06:53.350> have<00:06:53.620> to<00:06:53.800> formulate<00:06:54.070> this<00:06:54.370> in<00:06:54.580> another

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:54.700 
so you have to formulate this in another

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:57.180 
so you have to formulate this in another
way<00:06:54.970> and<00:06:55.300> the<00:06:55.390> core<00:06:55.720> can<00:06:55.960> give<00:06:56.170> you<00:06:56.380> an<00:06:57.040> idea

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:57.190 
way and the core can give you an idea

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.030 
way and the core can give you an idea
yes
