00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
learned from the experience but myself

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.660 
learned from the experience but myself
included<00:00:24.180> so<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.869> always<00:00:25.320> learn<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:26.099> few<00:00:26.430> new

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
included so I always learn a few new

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.550 
included so I always learn a few new
things<00:00:26.699> and<00:00:27.269> I<00:00:27.330> make<00:00:27.539> new<00:00:27.720> friends<00:00:28.289> and<00:00:28.439> it's

things and I make new friends and it's

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.510 
things and I make new friends and it's
it<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.160> just<00:00:29.400> a<00:00:29.519> very<00:00:29.699> positive<00:00:30.170> experience

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:31.520 
it was just a very positive experience

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:33.860 
it was just a very positive experience
so<00:00:32.520> I<00:00:32.550> decided<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.120> keep<00:00:33.300> going<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.780> the

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:33.870 
so I decided to keep going with the

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.470 
so I decided to keep going with the
painting<00:00:34.230> and<00:00:34.500> add<00:00:35.219> a<00:00:35.760> little<00:00:36.120> bit<00:00:36.270> more

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
painting and add a little bit more

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.750 
painting and add a little bit more
detail<00:00:36.960> also<00:00:37.440> explain<00:00:38.040> a<00:00:38.070> little<00:00:38.309> bit<00:00:38.550> about

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
detail also explain a little bit about

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.270 
detail also explain a little bit about
my<00:00:38.969> limited<00:00:39.480> palette<00:00:39.719> and<00:00:40.110> why<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.379> use<00:00:40.800> it<00:00:40.829> I

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
my limited palette and why I use it I

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.950 
my limited palette and why I use it I
think<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.969> already<00:00:42.090> told<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.629> about<00:00:42.719> the

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
think I already told you about the

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:44.540 
think I already told you about the
colors<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:43.500> I<00:00:43.590> use<00:00:43.890> but<00:00:44.100> they're<00:00:44.309> a<00:00:44.340> little

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
colors that I use but they're a little

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.600 
colors that I use but they're a little
bit<00:00:44.730> easier<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.180> see<00:00:45.390> right<00:00:45.870> now<00:00:46.129> these<00:00:47.129> are<00:00:47.340> my

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
bit easier to see right now these are my

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.910 
bit easier to see right now these are my
actual<00:00:48.030> beginning<00:00:48.600> pick<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.410> pigments<00:00:49.860> that

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
actual beginning pick the pigments that

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.740 
actual beginning pick the pigments that
I<00:00:50.070> started<00:00:50.640> with<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.420> we've<00:00:51.570> got<00:00:51.750> yellow<00:00:52.219> red

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
I started with so we've got yellow red

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.189 
I started with so we've got yellow red
magenta<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:55.160> fellows<00:00:56.160> blue<00:00:56.760> so<00:00:57.629> those<00:00:57.989> are

00:00:58.189 --> 00:00:58.199 
magenta and fellows blue so those are

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:00.049 
magenta and fellows blue so those are
the<00:00:58.289> only<00:00:58.559> colors<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:59.129> I'm<00:00:59.250> using<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.820> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
the only colors that I'm using in this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.900 
the only colors that I'm using in this
painting<00:01:00.410> I<00:01:01.410> find<00:01:02.010> that<00:01:02.129> a<00:01:02.190> limited<00:01:02.699> palette

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
painting I find that a limited palette

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.090 
painting I find that a limited palette
really<00:01:03.239> helps<00:01:03.719> harmonize<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.439> painting<00:01:04.830> it

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
really helps harmonize the painting it

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.210 
really helps harmonize the painting it
also<00:01:05.790> helps<00:01:06.600> keep<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:06.990> colors<00:01:07.320> very<00:01:07.680> vibrant

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
also helps keep the colors very vibrant

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.730 
also helps keep the colors very vibrant
I<00:01:08.520> don't<00:01:09.090> know<00:01:09.270> why<00:01:09.450> but<00:01:09.780> the<00:01:09.990> more<00:01:10.170> colors<00:01:10.560> are

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
I don't know why but the more colors are

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.280 
I don't know why but the more colors are
used<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.820> less<00:01:12.060> vibrant<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.869> painting

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
used the less vibrant the painting

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.260 
used the less vibrant the painting
becomes<00:01:13.650> and<00:01:13.950> then<00:01:14.040> I<00:01:14.070> go<00:01:14.340> back<00:01:14.369> to<00:01:14.760> a<00:01:14.790> limited

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
becomes and then I go back to a limited

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:18.649 
becomes and then I go back to a limited
palette<00:01:15.600> every<00:01:16.110> once<00:01:16.320> in<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> while<00:01:16.680> also<00:01:17.659> just

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
palette every once in a while also just

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.160 
palette every once in a while also just
to<00:01:18.780> get<00:01:18.900> back<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.320> basics<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.180> get<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.240> more

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
to get back to basics and get a more

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.020 
to get back to basics and get a more
feel<00:01:22.500> for<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.890> pigments<00:01:23.369> themselves

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
feel for the pigments themselves

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.120 
feel for the pigments themselves
everything<00:01:24.509> between<00:01:24.840> those<00:01:25.320> pigments<00:01:25.979> is<00:01:26.100> a

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:26.130 
everything between those pigments is a

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:30.859 
everything between those pigments is a
mixture<00:01:26.640> that<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.990> did<00:01:29.000> that<00:01:30.000> I<00:01:30.030> kind<00:01:30.420> of<00:01:30.479> mixed

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
mixture that I did that I kind of mixed

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.050 
mixture that I did that I kind of mixed
them<00:01:31.020> up<00:01:31.140> previously<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.400> little<00:01:32.700> bit<00:01:32.850> like

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
them up previously and a little bit like

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.410 
them up previously and a little bit like
my<00:01:33.270> portraits<00:01:33.750> I've<00:01:33.960> got<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.439> local<00:01:34.890> colors

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
my portraits I've got the local colors

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.260 
my portraits I've got the local colors
so<00:01:36.420> I'm<00:01:36.720> still<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.500> with<00:01:37.650> my<00:01:37.890> you<00:01:38.670> can't<00:01:38.909> see

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.010 
again is a very deep violet I often use
violets<00:01:48.390> instead<00:01:48.840> of<00:01:48.960> black<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:50.570> some<00:01:51.570> kind<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
version of violet it's not always this

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.850 
version of violet it's not always this
vibrant<00:01:54.360> this<00:01:54.479> particular<00:01:55.020> violent<00:01:55.470> again

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
vibrant this particular violent again

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.730 
vibrant this particular violent again
it's<00:01:56.070> just<00:01:56.189> it's<00:01:57.060> super<00:01:57.540> saturated<00:01:58.140> but

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
it's just it's super saturated but

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.149 
it's just it's super saturated but
having<00:01:59.250> any<00:01:59.460> sort<00:01:59.820> of<00:02:00.590> transparent<00:02:01.590> color<00:02:01.829> is
