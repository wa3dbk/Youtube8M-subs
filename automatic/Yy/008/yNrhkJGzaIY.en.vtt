00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that you lost or something of that and

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.539 
that you lost or something of that and
because<00:01:57.869> there<00:01:58.110> is<00:01:58.259> just<00:01:58.560> as<00:01:59.040> just<00:01:59.280> a<00:01:59.340> short

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
because there is just as just a short

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:02.719 
because there is just as just a short
and<00:01:59.780> it's<00:02:00.780> not<00:02:00.990> a<00:02:01.020> story<00:02:01.439> so<00:02:02.040> maybe<00:02:02.460> think

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
and it's not a story so maybe think

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.030 
and it's not a story so maybe think
about<00:02:02.759> that<00:02:03.030> maybe<00:02:03.210> try<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.659> work<00:02:03.930> in<00:02:04.200> the

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
about that maybe try and work in the

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
about that maybe try and work in the
idea<00:02:05.460> of<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:05.759> magazine<00:02:06.479> and<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.750> calculator

e-book hair I going on and I see Africa
and<00:02:38.490> I<00:02:38.940> would<00:02:39.090> say<00:02:39.210> the<00:02:39.300> composition<00:02:39.810> needs<00:02:40.170> to

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and I would say the composition needs to

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.560 
and I would say the composition needs to
be<00:02:40.740> tightened<00:02:41.250> up<00:02:41.550> a<00:02:41.670> little<00:02:41.850> bit<00:02:41.970> it's<00:02:42.450> kind

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
be tightened up a little bit it's kind

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.320 
be tightened up a little bit it's kind
of<00:02:42.660> bottom<00:02:43.140> left<00:02:43.470> and<00:02:43.770> looks<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.760> little<00:02:45.150> bit

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
of bottom left and looks a little bit

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.730 
of bottom left and looks a little bit
under<00:02:45.540> exposed<00:02:45.960> for<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.260> flower<00:02:46.530> which

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:46.740 
under exposed for the flower which

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:48.050 
under exposed for the flower which
you're<00:02:46.920> trying<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.190> bring<00:02:47.370> the<00:02:47.490> attention<00:02:47.580> to

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
you're trying to bring the attention to

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.270 
you're trying to bring the attention to
so<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.930> kind<00:02:49.140> of<00:02:49.200> most<00:02:49.410> exposed<00:02:49.740> ones<00:02:50.010> are<00:02:50.190> the

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
so the kind of most exposed ones are the

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
so the kind of most exposed ones are the
ones<00:02:50.310> at<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.550> background<00:02:51.030> where<00:02:51.180> they're

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
ones at the background where they're

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.270 
ones at the background where they're
kind<00:02:51.450> of<00:02:51.480> almost<00:02:51.690> blown<00:02:52.020> out<00:02:52.200> with<00:02:52.380> the<00:02:52.530> bits

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:53.280 
kind of almost blown out with the bits

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.710 
kind of almost blown out with the bits
there<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.880> they've<00:02:54.120> got<00:02:54.150> random<00:02:54.570> flower

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
there and they've got random flower

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.910 
there and they've got random flower
there<00:02:54.960> and<00:02:55.080> a<00:02:55.200> little<00:02:55.290> bit<00:02:55.440> sticking<00:02:55.770> out

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:55.920 
there and a little bit sticking out

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.830 
there and a little bit sticking out
there<00:02:56.070> so<00:02:56.250> watch<00:02:56.460> out<00:02:56.640> again<00:02:57.000> just<00:02:57.510> watch<00:02:57.690> out

wedding let's see if we can make them

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.220 
wedding let's see if we can make them
because<00:03:30.750> it<00:03:30.900> touch<00:03:31.080> bigger<00:03:31.470> for<00:03:31.770> you<00:03:33.230> okay

because it touch bigger for you okay
what<00:03:34.410> to<00:03:34.560> do<00:03:34.650> is<00:03:34.920> a<00:03:35.160> good<00:03:35.580> little<00:03:35.700> thing<00:03:35.940> is

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150 
what to do is a good little thing is

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:38.840 
what to do is a good little thing is
make<00:03:36.420> a<00:03:36.450> duplicate<00:03:36.780> layer<00:03:37.440> and<00:03:37.710> then<00:03:38.430> you've

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:38.850 
make a duplicate layer and then you've

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.380 
make a duplicate layer and then you've
got<00:03:38.880> these<00:03:39.300> layer<00:03:39.870> modes<00:03:40.530> here<00:03:40.830> and<00:03:41.400> there's<00:03:42.300> a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
got these layer modes here and there's a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:43.699 
got these layer modes here and there's a
whole<00:03:42.510> bunch<00:03:42.690> of<00:03:42.750> what<00:03:42.900> like<00:03:43.050> multiply<00:03:43.530> will

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
whole bunch of what like multiply will

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.530 
whole bunch of what like multiply will
just<00:03:43.890> make<00:03:44.010> it<00:03:44.040> have<00:03:44.660> that<00:03:45.660> and<00:03:46.340> and<00:03:47.340> I<00:03:48.150> would

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
just make it have that and and I would

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:51.680 
just make it have that and and I would
say<00:03:48.780> you'd<00:03:49.080> want<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.320> do<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.620> soft<00:03:50.130> light<00:03:50.690> now

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
say you'd want to do is soft light now

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.630 
say you'd want to do is soft light now
initially<00:03:52.260> all<00:03:52.560> kind<00:03:52.740> of<00:03:52.770> all<00:03:53.070> replicas<00:03:53.580> the

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
initially all kind of all replicas the

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.710 
initially all kind of all replicas the
contrast<00:03:54.030> is<00:03:54.120> kind<00:03:54.330> of<00:03:54.390> going<00:03:54.450> a<00:03:54.540> bit<00:03:54.660> crazy

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
contrast is kind of going a bit crazy

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.410 
contrast is kind of going a bit crazy
and<00:03:55.290> you<00:03:55.950> can<00:03:56.100> see<00:03:56.190> the<00:03:56.220> difference<00:03:56.610> from<00:03:56.820> that

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
and you can see the difference from that

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.760 
and you can see the difference from that
was<00:03:57.570> it<00:03:57.720> before<00:03:58.080> and<00:03:59.000> that's<00:04:00.000> it<00:04:00.450> after<00:04:01.200> but

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
was it before and that's it after but

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.350 
was it before and that's it after but
that's<00:04:01.980> always<00:04:02.130> too<00:04:02.459> strong<00:04:02.790> so<00:04:03.000> obviously

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:03.360 
that's always too strong so obviously

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.750 
that's always too strong so obviously
bring<00:04:03.750> that<00:04:03.990> down<00:04:04.230> to<00:04:04.290> around<00:04:04.680> about<00:04:05.010> thirty

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
bring that down to around about thirty

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:09.980 
bring that down to around about thirty
percent<00:04:06.830> there<00:04:07.830> and<00:04:08.130> I<00:04:08.640> say<00:04:08.940> know<00:04:09.209> that<00:04:09.540> from

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:09.990 
percent there and I say know that from

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.810 
percent there and I say know that from
there<00:04:10.320> today<00:04:10.920> we're<00:04:11.250> talking<00:04:11.340> about<00:04:11.459> tiny

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:11.820 
there today we're talking about tiny

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:14.720 
there today we're talking about tiny
differences<00:04:12.650> might<00:04:13.650> be<00:04:13.860> quite<00:04:14.070> good<00:04:14.370> let's

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
differences might be quite good let's

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:16.039 
differences might be quite good let's
see<00:04:14.910> is<00:04:15.090> there<00:04:15.120> any<00:04:15.360> other<00:04:15.390> cute<00:04:15.780> ones<00:04:15.959> that

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
see is there any other cute ones that

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.680 
see is there any other cute ones that
might<00:04:16.140> be<00:04:16.290> an<00:04:16.470> overlay<00:04:17.430> I<00:04:17.790> won't<00:04:18.330> do<00:04:18.420> anything

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
might be an overlay I won't do anything

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:25.370 
might be an overlay I won't do anything
at<00:04:19.790> screen<00:04:20.790> that'll<00:04:21.330> make<00:04:21.479> it<00:04:22.070> lighter<00:04:24.380> so

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
at screen that'll make it lighter so

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.810 
at screen that'll make it lighter so
yeah<00:04:25.560> I've<00:04:25.710> got<00:04:25.890> letters

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
yeah I've got letters

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.070 
yeah I've got letters
all<00:04:26.910> bunch<00:04:27.180> of<00:04:27.300> different<00:04:27.600> ones<00:04:27.750> that<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:27.960> can

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:28.080 
all bunch of different ones that you can

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.380 
all bunch of different ones that you can
play<00:04:28.290> around<00:04:28.410> with<00:04:28.890> their<00:04:29.220> which<00:04:29.820> will<00:04:30.060> have

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:30.390 
play around with their which will have

00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:31.760 
play around with their which will have
slightly<00:04:30.570> different<00:04:30.780> effects<00:04:31.320> on<00:04:31.530> your

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
slightly different effects on your

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.380 
slightly different effects on your
images<00:04:32.070> and<00:04:32.250> sometimes<00:04:32.820> you<00:04:32.910> might<00:04:33.030> want<00:04:33.300> it

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
images and sometimes you might want it

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.580 
images and sometimes you might want it
so<00:04:33.600> it's<00:04:33.750> kind<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:33.960> a<00:04:34.020> little<00:04:34.260> bit<00:04:34.380> more

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:34.590 
so it's kind of a little bit more

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:36.950 
so it's kind of a little bit more
glowing<00:04:35.130> at<00:04:35.340> the<00:04:35.430> top<00:04:35.640> and<00:04:35.820> bottom<00:04:36.150> and<00:04:36.780> if<00:04:36.870> you

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:36.960 
glowing at the top and bottom and if you

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.510 
glowing at the top and bottom and if you
want<00:04:37.080> to<00:04:37.140> do<00:04:37.260> that<00:04:37.380> so<00:04:37.560> for<00:04:37.680> example<00:04:37.800> if<00:04:38.070> I<00:04:38.220> go

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:38.520 
want to do that so for example if I go

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:42.680 
want to do that so for example if I go
for<00:04:39.030> a<00:04:40.430> hard<00:04:41.430> light<00:04:42.030> that<00:04:42.330> will<00:04:42.390> give<00:04:42.540> me<00:04:42.630> a

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:42.690 
for a hard light that will give me a

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.440 
for a hard light that will give me a
strong<00:04:43.490> contrast<00:04:44.490> going<00:04:44.790> on<00:04:44.880> here<00:04:45.090> not<00:04:45.270> the

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:45.450 
strong contrast going on here not the

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.660 
strong contrast going on here not the
top<00:04:45.690> here<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:45.960> really<00:04:46.500> bright<00:04:46.860> but<00:04:47.490> what<00:04:47.640> i

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:47.670 
top here that's really bright but what i

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:49.640 
top here that's really bright but what i
can<00:04:47.820> do<00:04:47.970> is<00:04:48.000> i<00:04:48.180> can<00:04:48.210> just<00:04:48.450> quickly<00:04:48.660> do<00:04:49.080> a<00:04:49.110> layer

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:49.650 
can do is i can just quickly do a layer

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:54.850 
can do is i can just quickly do a layer
mask<00:04:50.780> do<00:04:51.780> that<00:04:52.110> and<00:04:52.500> then<00:04:52.830> on<00:04:53.100> this<00:04:53.370> ad<00:04:53.670> are<00:04:54.150> a

00:04:54.850 --> 00:04:54.860 
mask do that and then on this ad are a

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.170 
mask do that and then on this ad are a
gradient<00:04:55.860> or<00:04:56.010> black<00:04:56.460> and<00:04:56.640> white<00:04:56.790> you've<00:04:57.030> got

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:57.180 
gradient or black and white you've got

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:58.730 
gradient or black and white you've got
to<00:04:57.270> make<00:04:57.360> sure<00:04:57.420> that<00:04:57.540> your<00:04:57.780> colors<00:04:58.080> are<00:04:58.110> black

00:04:58.730 --> 00:04:58.740 
to make sure that your colors are black

00:04:58.740 --> 00:05:00.860 
to make sure that your colors are black
and<00:04:58.800> white<00:04:59.010> that's<00:04:59.250> fine<00:04:59.490> and<00:04:59.730> then<00:05:00.600> down

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
and white that's fine and then down

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.260 
and white that's fine and then down
there<00:05:01.170> we<00:05:01.380> can<00:05:01.500> do<00:05:01.620> it<00:05:01.710> so<00:05:01.890> that<00:05:02.130> the<00:05:02.670> top<00:05:03.000> bit

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270 
there we can do it so that the top bit

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.570 
there we can do it so that the top bit
is<00:05:03.420> less<00:05:03.720> blowing<00:05:04.410> out<00:05:04.560> going<00:05:05.190> on<00:05:05.310> there

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:05.580 
is less blowing out going on there

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:08.420 
is less blowing out going on there
predict<00:05:06.420> the<00:05:06.540> bottom<00:05:06.900> up<00:05:07.500> the<00:05:07.740> week<00:05:07.890> then<00:05:08.310> the

predict the bottom up the week then the

top facility bright in the bottom come

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.230 
top facility bright in the bottom come
back<00:05:10.110> to<00:05:10.260> what<00:05:10.650> it<00:05:10.680> was<00:05:10.770> before<00:05:11.130> on<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.850> image

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
back to what it was before on the image

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:14.390 
back to what it was before on the image
below<00:05:12.270> and<00:05:12.750> so<00:05:13.260> I<00:05:13.290> would<00:05:13.620> probably<00:05:13.800> actually

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:14.400 
below and so I would probably actually

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:17.080 
below and so I would probably actually
promoted<00:05:15.030> it<00:05:15.120> from<00:05:15.330> right<00:05:15.450> there<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.170> then

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
promoted it from right there and then

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.770 
promoted it from right there and then
mmm<00:05:18.090> maybe<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.660> as<00:05:18.750> strong<00:05:18.990> as<00:05:19.110> that<00:05:20.510> ya<00:05:21.510> see

00:05:21.770 --> 00:05:21.780 
mmm maybe not as strong as that ya see

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:23.330 
mmm maybe not as strong as that ya see
that<00:05:21.990> that's<00:05:22.230> kind<00:05:22.560> of<00:05:22.590> a<00:05:22.740> waiting<00:05:23.130> can

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
that that's kind of a waiting can

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.670 
that that's kind of a waiting can
control<00:05:23.760> the<00:05:24.330> difference<00:05:24.810> in<00:05:24.960> your<00:05:25.080> things

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680

to be approached porn um I think though

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:08.090

you could do more with that and if you'd

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.070 
you could do more with that and if you'd
have<00:06:08.310> a<00:06:08.340> circular<00:06:08.640> polarizer<00:06:09.270> and<00:06:09.600> get<00:06:09.750> rid<00:06:10.050> of

the reflections of the water here that

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.140 
the reflections of the water here that
might<00:06:13.710> have<00:06:13.830> helped<00:06:14.220> and<00:06:14.340> just<00:06:14.490> get<00:06:14.670> the<00:06:14.880> kind

might have helped and just get the kind

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:18.200 
might have helped and just get the kind
of<00:06:15.210> situation<00:06:15.450> in<00:06:15.960> the<00:06:16.080> colors<00:06:16.410> there<00:06:16.710> and<00:06:17.210> but

yet<00:06:18.390> no<00:06:18.570> good<00:06:19.260> location<00:06:19.620> I<00:06:19.680> really<00:06:20.190> want<00:06:20.310> to<00:06:20.400> go

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:20.610 
yet no good location I really want to go

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:22.790 
yet no good location I really want to go
there<00:06:20.750> when<00:06:21.750> I<00:06:21.810> heard<00:06:21.960> difficulties<00:06:22.440> together

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800 
there when I heard difficulties together

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.450 
there when I heard difficulties together
from<00:06:22.890> Scotland<00:06:23.720> last<00:06:24.960> the<00:06:25.260> last<00:06:26.010> shot

00:06:26.450 --> 00:06:26.460 
from Scotland last the last shot

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:30.410 
from Scotland last the last shot
the<00:06:26.820> mad<00:06:27.000> skills<00:06:27.830> mid<00:06:28.830> short<00:06:29.190> or<00:06:29.700> yet<00:06:30.120> they're

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:30.420 
the mad skills mid short or yet they're

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:33.290 
the mad skills mid short or yet they're
sticking<00:06:31.050> the<00:06:31.410> tongue<00:06:31.440> out<00:06:32.120> friend<00:06:33.120> playing

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:33.300 
sticking the tongue out friend playing

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:34.970 
sticking the tongue out friend playing
soccer<00:06:33.510> against<00:06:33.930> another<00:06:34.230> high<00:06:34.440> school<00:06:34.740> I

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:34.980 
soccer against another high school I

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.990 
soccer against another high school I
like<00:06:35.130> it<00:06:35.220> because<00:06:35.310> I<00:06:35.640> think<00:06:35.700> it<00:06:35.820> really<00:06:35.850> shows

00:06:35.990 --> 00:06:36.000 
like it because I think it really shows

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.020 
like it because I think it really shows
the<00:06:36.150> action<00:06:36.900> of<00:06:37.110> the<00:06:37.290> game<00:06:37.580> doesn't<00:06:38.580> it<00:06:38.760> it

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:39.030 
the action of the game doesn't it it

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:40.550 
the action of the game doesn't it it
kind<00:06:39.270> of<00:06:39.300> looks<00:06:39.480> like<00:06:39.570> he's<00:06:39.840> just<00:06:40.020> do<00:06:40.230> some

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:40.560 
kind of looks like he's just do some

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.790 
kind of looks like he's just do some
keep<00:06:40.710> yuppies<00:06:41.720> okay<00:06:42.720> you<00:06:42.780> could<00:06:42.960> I<00:06:43.200> don't

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
keep yuppies okay you could I don't

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.110 
keep yuppies okay you could I don't
think<00:06:43.919> it<00:06:43.980> does<00:06:44.130> I<00:06:44.400> think<00:06:44.790> it<00:06:44.850> just<00:06:44.910> shows<00:06:45.000> a

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:45.120 
think it does I think it just shows a

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.629 
think it does I think it just shows a
guy<00:06:45.330> could<00:06:45.510> have<00:06:45.660> not<00:06:46.230> kicking<00:06:47.190> a<00:06:47.250> ball<00:06:47.280> he

00:06:47.629 --> 00:06:47.639 
guy could have not kicking a ball he

00:06:47.639 --> 00:06:48.770 
guy could have not kicking a ball he
just<00:06:47.669> kind<00:06:47.970> of<00:06:48.000> leave<00:06:48.090> ladies<00:06:48.360> got<00:06:48.510> a<00:06:48.540> broken

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
just kind of leave ladies got a broken

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.390 
just kind of leave ladies got a broken
ankle<00:06:49.020> he<00:06:49.350> actually<00:06:49.590> looks<00:06:49.980> like<00:06:50.100> he's<00:06:50.220> broken

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:50.400 
ankle he actually looks like he's broken

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:52.070 
ankle he actually looks like he's broken
his<00:06:50.490> ankle<00:06:50.669> there<00:06:51.030> and<00:06:51.240> they're<00:06:51.720> just<00:06:51.900> people

00:06:52.070 --> 00:06:52.080 
his ankle there and they're just people

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.680 
his ankle there and they're just people
that<00:06:52.169> say<00:06:52.410> can<00:06:52.620> I<00:06:52.650> boo<00:06:53.000> you<00:06:54.000> broken<00:06:54.300> your<00:06:54.330> ankle

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:54.690 
that say can I boo you broken your ankle

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.170 
that say can I boo you broken your ankle
so<00:06:55.200> I<00:06:55.590> don't<00:06:56.400> think<00:06:56.580> that<00:06:56.639> really<00:06:56.880> has

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
so I don't think that really has

00:06:57.180 --> 00:06:58.580 
so I don't think that really has
shouldn't<00:06:57.600> be<00:06:57.660> the<00:06:57.780> action<00:06:58.050> of<00:06:58.139> the<00:06:58.230> game<00:06:58.380> that

00:06:58.580 --> 00:06:58.590 
shouldn't be the action of the game that

00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.590 
shouldn't be the action of the game that
could<00:06:58.919> have<00:06:59.040> been<00:06:59.190> when<00:06:59.880> I<00:06:59.910> first<00:07:00.240> saw<00:07:00.389> that<00:07:00.540> I

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:00.600 
could have been when I first saw that I

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.300 
could have been when I first saw that I
thought<00:07:00.630> it<00:07:00.810> was<00:07:00.900> just<00:07:00.990> him<00:07:01.230> kicking<00:07:02.100> the<00:07:02.160> ball

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:02.310 
thought it was just him kicking the ball

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:04.490 
thought it was just him kicking the ball
around<00:07:02.370> not<00:07:02.940> necessary<00:07:03.300> having<00:07:03.690> a<00:07:03.810> game<00:07:04.230> there

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:04.500 
around not necessary having a game there

00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.830 
around not necessary having a game there
so<00:07:04.770> I<00:07:05.100> really<00:07:05.790> would<00:07:05.910> involve<00:07:06.240> like<00:07:06.480> people

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:06.840 
so I really would involve like people

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.320 
so I really would involve like people
get<00:07:07.050> it<00:07:07.380> gets<00:07:07.590> a<00:07:07.680> motion<00:07:08.220> blur<00:07:08.520> as<00:07:08.730> well<00:07:09.060> like

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:09.330 
get it gets a motion blur as well like

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.180 
get it gets a motion blur as well like
if<00:07:09.450> he's<00:07:09.780> running<00:07:10.169> and<00:07:10.320> kicking<00:07:10.710> the<00:07:10.770> ball<00:07:10.889> get

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:11.190 
if he's running and kicking the ball get

00:07:11.190 --> 00:07:13.070 
if he's running and kicking the ball get
some<00:07:11.430> blur<00:07:11.639> going<00:07:11.880> in<00:07:12.090> into<00:07:12.780> the<00:07:12.840> image<00:07:13.050> that

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:13.080 
some blur going in into the image that

00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.500 
some blur going in into the image that
