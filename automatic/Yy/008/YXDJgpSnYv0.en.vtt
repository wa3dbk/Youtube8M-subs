00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
to use root explorer we're going to fire

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.160 
to use root explorer we're going to fire

root explorer up and we're gonna head to
the<00:01:04.320> system<00:01:04.949> folder

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.810 

and<00:01:13.060> then<00:01:14.060> we're<00:01:14.180> going<00:01:14.270> to<00:01:14.330> head<00:01:14.480> down<00:01:14.540> to<00:01:14.750> USR

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.010 

hop<00:01:20.820> on<00:01:20.970> us<00:01:21.300> our<00:01:21.480> folder<00:01:22.400> and<00:01:23.870> we're<00:01:24.870> going<00:01:24.990> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
hop on us our folder and we're going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.990 
hop on us our folder and we're going to
go<00:01:25.200> to<00:01:25.260> key<00:01:25.980> layout

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.250 

now<00:01:32.000> we're<00:01:32.120> gonna<00:01:32.210> see<00:01:32.420> a<00:01:32.450> whole<00:01:32.690> series<00:01:33.080> of

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:33.260 
now we're gonna see a whole series of

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.820 
now we're gonna see a whole series of
different<00:01:33.740> keyboard<00:01:34.280> layout<00:01:34.970> files<00:01:35.650> now<00:01:36.650> I've

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:36.830 
different keyboard layout files now I've

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:38.620 
different keyboard layout files now I've
already<00:01:37.340> performed<00:01:37.580> this<00:01:38.120> hack<00:01:38.330> so<00:01:38.510> it's

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
already performed this hack so it's

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:39.969 
already performed this hack so it's
going<00:01:38.750> to<00:01:38.810> be<00:01:38.930> a<00:01:38.960> little<00:01:39.200> easier<00:01:39.590> for<00:01:39.650> me<00:01:39.860> to

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:39.979 
going to be a little easier for me to

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.150 
going to be a little easier for me to
find<00:01:40.400> and<00:01:41.110> what<00:01:42.110> we<00:01:42.229> have<00:01:42.440> to<00:01:42.590> do<00:01:42.740> is<00:01:42.890> we<00:01:42.979> have

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
find and what we have to do is we have

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.180 
find and what we have to do is we have

readwrite which means now we can change
files<00:02:07.039> within<00:02:07.640> this<00:02:08.000> folder<00:02:08.289> as<00:02:09.289> you<00:02:09.410> can<00:02:09.530> see

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
files within this folder as you can see

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:10.660 
files within this folder as you can see
there's<00:02:09.800> a<00:02:09.830> little<00:02:09.950> button<00:02:10.160> here<00:02:10.369> which<00:02:10.489> says

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
there's a little button here which says

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.420 
there's a little button here which says
mount<00:02:11.000> read-only<00:02:11.650> so<00:02:12.650> that<00:02:12.920> means<00:02:13.130> you<00:02:13.280> can

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:13.430 
mount read-only so that means you can

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.610 
mount read-only so that means you can
see<00:02:13.640> the<00:02:13.670> files<00:02:14.000> you<00:02:14.239> just<00:02:14.270> can't<00:02:14.660> edit<00:02:15.350> the

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
see the files you just can't edit the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.470 
see the files you just can't edit the
files<00:02:15.860> so<00:02:16.160> we're<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.459> readwrite<00:02:17.030> right<00:02:17.300> now

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:17.480 
files so we're in readwrite right now

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.120 
files so we're in readwrite right now
which<00:02:17.660> means<00:02:17.870> we<00:02:18.020> can<00:02:18.260> edit<00:02:18.470> the<00:02:18.680> files<00:02:18.920> and

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
which means we can edit the files and

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.910 
which means we can edit the files and
we're<00:02:19.250> gonna<00:02:19.340> long<00:02:19.670> press<00:02:20.030> on<00:02:20.270> this<00:02:20.840> and<00:02:21.200> we're

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
we're gonna long press on this and we're

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.550 
we're gonna long press on this and we're
going<00:02:22.250> to<00:02:22.280> rename<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.480> basically<00:02:24.410> we<00:02:24.530> just

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
going to rename it so basically we just

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.860 
going to rename it so basically we just
want<00:02:24.769> to<00:02:24.980> put<00:02:25.160> something<00:02:25.700> else<00:02:25.940> after<00:02:26.269> that

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
want to put something else after that

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.949 
want to put something else after that
dot<00:02:27.260> K<00:02:27.650> L<00:02:27.980> so<00:02:28.340> that'll<00:02:29.090> change<00:02:29.420> the<00:02:29.630> file

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
dot K L so that'll change the file

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:31.930 
dot K L so that'll change the file
