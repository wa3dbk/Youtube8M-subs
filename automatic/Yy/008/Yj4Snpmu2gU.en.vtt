sometimes<00:05:38.300> that<00:05:38.540> could<00:05:38.720> be<00:05:38.810> a<00:05:38.840> problem<00:05:39.200> with

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:39.470 
sometimes that could be a problem with

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.130 
sometimes that could be a problem with
your<00:05:39.710> edges<00:05:40.520> right<00:05:40.760> here<00:05:40.820> but<00:05:41.810> I'm<00:05:41.930> going<00:05:42.110> to

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:42.140 
your edges right here but I'm going to

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:44.740 
your edges right here but I'm going to
make<00:05:42.350> sure<00:05:42.410> I<00:05:42.590> cut<00:05:42.980> the<00:05:43.160> lace<00:05:43.370> very<00:05:43.880> close<00:05:44.300> but

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750 
make sure I cut the lace very close but

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.900

I<00:05:44.990> really<00:05:45.620> love<00:05:45.830> the<00:05:45.980> construction<00:05:46.640> of<00:05:46.760> this

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:51.440 
closure the parts are excellent I don't

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:53.890 
closure the parts are excellent I don't
think<00:05:51.710> I<00:05:51.890> would<00:05:52.160> have<00:05:52.370> to<00:05:52.730> do<00:05:53.180> anything<00:05:53.630> to

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
think I would have to do anything to

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:57.460 
think I would have to do anything to
them<00:05:54.080> and<00:05:54.350> it<00:05:55.100> comes<00:05:55.870> they<00:05:56.870> have<00:05:56.900> it<00:05:57.230> pinned

00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:57.470 
them and it comes they have it pinned

00:05:57.470 --> 00:05:59.470 
them and it comes they have it pinned
back<00:05:57.740> for<00:05:58.100> you<00:05:58.250> so<00:05:58.430> you<00:05:58.490> can<00:05:58.730> see<00:05:58.940> the<00:05:59.120> parts

00:05:59.470 --> 00:05:59.480 
back for you so you can see the parts

00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:02.470 
back for you so you can see the parts
when<00:05:59.690> you<00:05:59.810> get<00:06:00.080> it<00:06:00.340> the<00:06:01.340> texture<00:06:01.910> is<00:06:02.120> gorgeous

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:02.480 
when you get it the texture is gorgeous

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:07.000 
when you get it the texture is gorgeous
it<00:06:03.669> feels<00:06:04.669> just<00:06:04.970> like<00:06:05.120> the<00:06:05.450> bundles<00:06:06.010> well

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.010

actually<00:06:07.220> it's<00:06:07.550> a<00:06:07.610> little<00:06:07.730> bit<00:06:07.850> softer<00:06:08.419> than

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
actually it's a little bit softer than

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.670 
actually it's a little bit softer than
the<00:06:08.690> bundles<00:06:10.120> but<00:06:11.120> I<00:06:11.180> love<00:06:11.479> that<00:06:11.720> as<00:06:11.930> pattern

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
I hope that we can get this pattern to

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.580 
I hope that we can get this pattern to
stay<00:06:15.410> once<00:06:16.340> I<00:06:16.520> wash<00:06:16.789> it<00:06:16.870> but<00:06:17.870> yes<00:06:18.139> you<00:06:18.380> guys
