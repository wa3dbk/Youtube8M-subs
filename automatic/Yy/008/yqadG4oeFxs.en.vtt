00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:05.529
 hello friends of mine today I am going to 

00:00:02.949 --> 00:00:09.340
 make a paving and the ingredients 

00:00:05.529 --> 00:00:15.400
 they are watched potato tomatoes cooked beans 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:18.870
 olives cheese tuna eggs oil and salt and 

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.870
 apart a pot with water 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.609
 and it starts to boil the water and what 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.970
 let's do now is to boil 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:28.829
 the potatoes I look at the potatoes before 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.680
 put them boiled went under the 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:34.350
 tap and they go a little look at that 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.059
 they are so medium because they were before and 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.059
 now we are going to put them 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.010
 we already put them in the water in the 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.860
 potatoes always have to cover them on 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.989
 water is if you see that it boils and if rather 

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.700
 when the water adds a little bit of 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.670
 moment when it starts to boil 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.800
 let's leave half an hour and then the 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.470
 we will puncture and see if they are cooked or 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.320
 they need more and put aside already the 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:05.570
 eggs with water in the fire also the 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:09.970
 eggs when they start to boil 10 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.970
 minutes and you take it out that they are already cooked 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:16.950
 already spending half an hour now we are going to 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:20.800
 click here you see 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:23.440
 and it comes out clean perfect 

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:27.160
 this is now now let's turn off the 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:29.740
 fire and we're going to take them out and we're going to 

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:33.060
 let it cool a bit 

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.060
 feel good to peel them 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:40.440
 now you have to take one more tray or 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:42.210
 thus less probe and let's start 

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:45.720
 cut the potatoes I already have them 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.800
 peeled look at them do to this extent 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:52.850
 you do not need bigger 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.380
 or what is the potato you do not do like this and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 then like this 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:59.090
 and so that you have more or less the 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.000
 same measures you do it in two and is 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:04.990
 the measure is expensive we are going to make a 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.990
 layer of potato 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.410
 we have already cut part of the 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.959
 potatoes we have already made a base and now 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:18.870
 here we are going to take a part of the 

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:18.870
 beans and we are going to distribute it well 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.950
 we have already thrown a part of the beans 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.930
 and now we're going to throw everything 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.830
 little the potatoes below a little 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.550
 of salt 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:36.800
 Look, persie, and now what are we going to do? 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:36.800
 not having it a little bit so that the salt 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:40.110
 carefully 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:47.050
 then salt as I always tell you 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.760
 always at the table that likes to lie down 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.000
 a little more salt you put the 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.600
 saltshaker and matching healthier 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.740
 and now we are going to put a part of the 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.470

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:32.250
 Well, we're going to take a part 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:32.250

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:11.750
 potatoes we are not going to take salt anymore 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:11.750
