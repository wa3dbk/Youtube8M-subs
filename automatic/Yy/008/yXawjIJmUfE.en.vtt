00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
right so the names were often

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.080 
right so the names were often
appropriate<00:00:58.500> for<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.739> characters<00:00:59.129> but<00:00:59.399> where

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
appropriate for the characters but where

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.110 
appropriate for the characters but where
did<00:01:00.329> he<00:01:00.539> get<00:01:01.410> the<00:01:01.710> inspiration<00:01:02.129> for<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.760> from

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
did he get the inspiration for that from

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.299 
did he get the inspiration for that from
and<00:01:03.390> for<00:01:04.110> han<00:01:04.350> Solo<00:01:04.650> it's<00:01:04.860> pretty<00:01:05.070> interesting

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
and for han Solo it's pretty interesting

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:08.270 
and for han Solo it's pretty interesting
just<00:01:06.299> because<00:01:06.450> it's<00:01:06.570> so<00:01:06.720> mundane<00:01:07.280> according

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
just because it's so mundane according

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.130

to<00:01:08.340> George<00:01:08.580> Lucas<00:01:08.640> I<00:01:09.240> think<00:01:09.659> this<00:01:09.750> is<00:01:09.810> in<00:01:10.049> the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
to George Lucas I think this is in the

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.310 
to George Lucas I think this is in the
making<00:01:10.290> of<00:01:10.530> Star<00:01:10.740> Wars<00:01:10.770> by<00:01:11.119> Jonathan<00:01:12.119> Rinzler
