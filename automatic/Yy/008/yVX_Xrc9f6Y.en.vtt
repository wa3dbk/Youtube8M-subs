tree storage is the place where we're
going<00:00:45.170> to<00:00:45.260> see<00:00:45.410> all<00:00:45.620> of<00:00:45.650> our<00:00:45.860> volumes<00:00:46.370> so<00:00:47.060> we

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
going to see all of our volumes so we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.780 
going to see all of our volumes so we
can<00:00:47.540> have<00:00:47.780> organizer<00:00:48.350> volumes<00:00:48.860> with<00:00:49.250> folders

can have organizer volumes with folders
and<00:00:50.060> we<00:00:50.270> can<00:00:50.480> apply<00:00:50.920> replay<00:00:51.920> profiles<00:00:52.490> as<00:00:52.760> well

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:52.940 
and we can apply replay profiles as well

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.850 
and we can apply replay profiles as well
as<00:00:53.060> storage<00:00:53.420> profiles<00:00:53.870> either<00:00:54.290> on<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> volume

replay<00:01:02.480> profiles<00:01:02.989> are<00:01:03.519> the<00:01:04.519> Compellent

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:05.329 
replay profiles are the Compellent

replay profiles are the Compellent
version<00:01:05.899> of<00:01:06.140> snapshotting<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.030> you<00:01:08.090> can

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.510 
version of snapshotting so you can

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.330 
version of snapshotting so you can
create<00:01:08.720> replay<00:01:09.229> profiles<00:01:09.770> that<00:01:10.040> have

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:10.340 
create replay profiles that have

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.670 
create replay profiles that have
multiple<00:01:12.760> snapshot<00:01:13.780> retention<00:01:14.780> policies<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
multiple snapshot retention policies and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.920 
multiple snapshot retention policies and
snapshot<00:01:16.100> times<00:01:16.430> within<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:16.940> replay<00:01:17.420> profile

snapshot times within a replay profile

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:19.539 
snapshot times within a replay profile
so<00:01:18.200> that<00:01:18.320> you<00:01:18.409> don't<00:01:18.650> necessarily<00:01:18.830> need<00:01:19.490> to

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:19.549 
so that you don't necessarily need to

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.969 
so that you don't necessarily need to
have<00:01:19.820> three<00:01:20.720> or<00:01:20.750> four<00:01:20.960> or<00:01:21.440> five<00:01:21.710> different

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
have three or four or five different

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:24.969 
have three or four or five different

snapshot schedules on an individual
volume<00:01:25.310> at<00:01:25.490> you<00:01:25.640> have<00:01:25.760> one<00:01:26.000> replay<00:01:26.510> profile

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:27.170 
volume at you have one replay profile

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.680 
volume at you have one replay profile
with<00:01:27.830> a<00:01:28.340> bunch<00:01:28.640> of<00:01:28.760> different<00:01:29.120> schedules<00:01:29.540> in

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:29.690 
with a bunch of different schedules in

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.160 
with a bunch of different schedules in
it<00:01:29.870> storage<00:01:30.860> profiles<00:01:31.400> are<00:01:31.940> the<00:01:32.170> mechanism

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:33.170 
it storage profiles are the mechanism

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.380 
it storage profiles are the mechanism
with<00:01:33.380> which<00:01:33.560> we<00:01:33.890> can<00:01:34.130> determine<00:01:34.580> where<00:01:35.090> our

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
with which we can determine where our

with which we can determine where our
storage<00:01:35.690> resides<00:01:36.140> so<00:01:36.409> whether<00:01:36.619> we<00:01:36.799> want<00:01:37.070> to

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
storage resides so whether we want to

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.109 
storage resides so whether we want to
have<00:01:37.760> a<00:01:38.030> volume<00:01:38.630> span<00:01:39.170> all<00:01:39.500> three<00:01:40.220> tiers<00:01:40.580> raid

maybe<00:01:45.590> we<00:01:45.860> just<00:01:46.070> want<00:01:46.250> volumes<00:01:46.790> to<00:01:46.970> stay<00:01:47.210> on

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
maybe we just want volumes to stay on

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.630 
maybe we just want volumes to stay on
tier<00:01:48.080> 1<00:01:48.290> which<00:01:48.530> might<00:01:48.770> be<00:01:48.950> our<00:01:49.070> solid-state

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:49.640

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
want that data to be on raid 6 tier 3 so

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.789 
want that data to be on raid 6 tier 3 so

if<00:02:15.019> you<00:02:15.230> do<00:02:15.409> want<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.680> delete<00:02:15.829> a<00:02:16.010> volume

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
if you do want to delete a volume

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.060 
if you do want to delete a volume
you<00:02:17.120> have<00:02:17.690> not<00:02:17.870> ran<00:02:18.080> out<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.230> space<00:02:18.560> yet<00:02:18.860> you

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.070 
you have not ran out of space yet you

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:21.550 
you have not ran out of space yet you
can<00:02:19.370> move<00:02:20.210> that<00:02:20.390> volume<00:02:20.600> to<00:02:20.720> the<00:02:20.930> recycle<00:02:21.380> bin

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
can move that volume to the recycle bin

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.260 
can move that volume to the recycle bin
for<00:02:22.780> recovery<00:02:23.780> later<00:02:23.990> if<00:02:24.350> needed<00:02:25.060> moving<00:02:26.060> down

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 
for recovery later if needed moving down

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:30.070 
for recovery later if needed moving down
here<00:02:26.300> we<00:02:26.960> have<00:02:27.260> servers<00:02:28.120> so<00:02:29.120> again<00:02:29.690> we<00:02:29.930> can

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
here we have servers so again we can

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:31.990 
here we have servers so again we can
have<00:02:30.230> folders<00:02:30.650> we<00:02:31.160> can<00:02:31.190> have<00:02:31.430> some<00:02:31.700> folders

00:02:31.990 --> 00:02:32.000 
have folders we can have some folders

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.690 
have folders we can have some folders
within<00:02:32.240> a<00:02:32.390> folder<00:02:32.810> and<00:02:33.040> we<00:02:34.040> can<00:02:34.220> have<00:02:34.340> clusters

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
within a folder and we can have clusters

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.590 
within a folder and we can have clusters
so<00:02:35.270> this<00:02:35.690> is<00:02:35.870> how<00:02:36.020> we<00:02:36.760> manage<00:02:37.760> our<00:02:38.030> access

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:38.600 
so this is how we manage our access

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.270 
so this is how we manage our access
control<00:02:39.340> policies<00:02:40.340> so<00:02:41.000> we<00:02:41.270> are<00:02:41.630> going<00:02:41.870> to<00:02:41.959> map

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
control policies so we are going to map

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.860 
control policies so we are going to map
volumes<00:02:43.280> to<00:02:43.580> either<00:02:43.880> server<00:02:44.240> objects<00:02:44.720> or

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
volumes to either server objects or

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.400 
volumes to either server objects or
cluster<00:02:45.260> objects<00:02:46.450> within<00:02:47.450> the<00:02:47.690> storage

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
cluster objects within the storage

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.620 
cluster objects within the storage
center<00:02:48.590> to<00:02:49.160> mask<00:02:49.550> those<00:02:49.820> volumes<00:02:50.209> from<00:02:50.390> other

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
center to mask those volumes from other

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:52.830 
center to mask those volumes from other
hosts<00:02:51.050> that<00:02:51.140> we<00:02:51.260> don't<00:02:51.470> want<00:02:51.680> to<00:02:51.830> see<00:02:52.070> and

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:52.840 
hosts that we don't want to see and

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:56.290 
hosts that we don't want to see and
lastly<00:02:53.840> we<00:02:54.020> do<00:02:54.260> have<00:02:54.610> users<00:02:55.610> down<00:02:55.850> here<00:02:56.120> where

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
lastly we do have users down here where

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.360 
lastly we do have users down here where
we<00:02:56.330> can<00:02:56.660> create<00:02:57.020> different<00:02:57.170> users<00:02:57.770> who<00:02:58.250> have

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
we can create different users who have

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:00.760 
we can create different users who have
access<00:02:58.610> to<00:02:59.090> different<00:02:59.380> folders<00:03:00.380> underneath

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:00.770 
access to different folders underneath

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.850 
access to different folders underneath

pane<00:03:10.670> also<00:03:11.390> we<00:03:11.930> do<00:03:12.110> have<00:03:12.380> a<00:03:12.709> tab<00:03:13.130> here<00:03:13.160> that<00:03:13.760> we

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
pane also we do have a tab here that we

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:16.330 
pane also we do have a tab here that we
can<00:03:14.590> take<00:03:15.590> a<00:03:15.620> look<00:03:15.800> at<00:03:15.980> some<00:03:16.220> additional

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
can take a look at some additional

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:19.390 
can take a look at some additional
components<00:03:16.970> so<00:03:17.900> one<00:03:18.500> example<00:03:19.100> would<00:03:19.340> be

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:19.400 
components so one example would be

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:21.610 
components so one example would be
online<00:03:20.060> storage<00:03:20.360> to<00:03:20.660> give<00:03:20.810> us<00:03:20.930> an<00:03:21.049> example<00:03:21.530> of

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
online storage to give us an example of

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:23.440 
online storage to give us an example of
how<00:03:21.799> much<00:03:22.010> storage<00:03:22.310> we're<00:03:22.580> using<00:03:22.880> across<00:03:23.180> the

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
how much storage we're using across the

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.810 
how much storage we're using across the
system<00:03:23.870> what<00:03:24.560> do<00:03:24.709> those<00:03:24.830> trends<00:03:25.310> look<00:03:25.519> like

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
system what do those trends look like

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.120 
system what do those trends look like
data<00:03:26.600> progression<00:03:27.200> pressure<00:03:27.470> reports<00:03:27.980> to

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.130 
data progression pressure reports to

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:29.710 
data progression pressure reports to
tell<00:03:28.340> us<00:03:28.489> how<00:03:28.640> much<00:03:28.820> is<00:03:28.970> moving<00:03:29.299> up<00:03:29.420> and<00:03:29.600> how

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:29.720 
tell us how much is moving up and how

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.720 
tell us how much is moving up and how
much<00:03:29.780> is<00:03:30.049> moving<00:03:30.380> down<00:03:30.560> and<00:03:30.799> also<00:03:31.370> volume

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
much is moving down and also volume

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.140 
much is moving down and also volume
distribution<00:03:31.970> reports<00:03:33.040> lastly<00:03:34.040> this<00:03:34.880> is

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
distribution reports lastly this is

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.590 
distribution reports lastly this is
