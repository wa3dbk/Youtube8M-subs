00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.060 
there's going to be a change of tactics

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:39.370 
there's going to be a change of tactics
or<00:04:38.180> you're<00:04:38.330> going<00:04:38.419> to<00:04:38.479> stick<00:04:38.990> to<00:04:39.139> what<00:04:39.289> you

00:04:39.370 --> 00:04:39.380 
or you're going to stick to what you

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.110 
or you're going to stick to what you
know<00:04:39.409> are<00:04:39.860> you<00:04:39.979> going<00:04:40.099> to<00:04:40.190> worry<00:04:40.400> about<00:04:40.520> the

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
know are you going to worry about the

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.390 
know are you going to worry about the
other<00:04:41.270> teams<00:04:41.539> doing<00:04:42.440> as<00:04:42.650> much<00:04:42.770> research<00:04:43.190> on

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:43.400 
other teams doing as much research on

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:46.450 
other teams doing as much research on
you<00:04:43.580> like<00:04:43.760> you<00:04:43.909> did<00:04:44.060> on<00:04:44.150> Navi<00:04:45.130> we<00:04:46.130> don't<00:04:46.340> know

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:46.460 
you like you did on Navi we don't know

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.070 
you like you did on Navi we don't know
probably<00:04:46.909> they've<00:04:47.210> been<00:04:47.419> doing<00:04:47.810> the<00:04:47.930> research

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:48.080 
probably they've been doing the research

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.339 
probably they've been doing the research
for<00:04:48.289> on<00:04:49.070> you<00:04:49.580> know<00:04:49.699> before<00:04:50.599> the<00:04:50.840> game<00:04:50.990> as<00:04:51.169> well

00:04:51.339 --> 00:04:51.349 
for on you know before the game as well

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:53.890 
for on you know before the game as well
but<00:04:51.590> we<00:04:52.460> have<00:04:52.610> lost<00:04:52.880> two<00:04:53.180> games<00:04:53.389> in<00:04:53.630> the<00:04:53.720> group

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:53.900 
but we have lost two games in the group

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:56.589 
but we have lost two games in the group
stage<00:04:54.199> one<00:04:54.650> even<00:04:54.979> against<00:04:55.280> the<00:04:55.520> scale<00:04:55.789> like<00:04:55.909> 32

00:04:56.589 --> 00:04:56.599 
stage one even against the scale like 32

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.909 
stage one even against the scale like 32
16<00:04:57.110> so<00:04:57.349> I<00:04:57.610> think<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:59.419> level<00:04:59.750> is<00:05:00.050> so<00:05:00.260> cool<00:05:00.650> that

00:05:00.909 --> 00:05:00.919 
16 so I think the level is so cool that

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:03.270 
16 so I think the level is so cool that
anyone<00:05:01.430> can<00:05:01.580> win<00:05:01.820> so<00:05:02.090> it's<00:05:02.300> not<00:05:02.479> it's<00:05:02.990> not<00:05:03.199> like

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
anyone can win so it's not it's not like

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.640 
anyone can win so it's not it's not like
you<00:05:04.280> know<00:05:04.449> yeah<00:05:05.449> but<00:05:05.659> that<00:05:05.810> was<00:05:05.990> the<00:05:06.139> second

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:06.650 
you know yeah but that was the second

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.159 
you know yeah but that was the second
major<00:05:06.830> even<00:05:07.159> that<00:05:07.789> we<00:05:07.970> have<00:05:08.090> one<00:05:08.300> in<00:05:08.570> a<00:05:08.599> row<00:05:08.840> so

00:05:09.159 --> 00:05:09.169 
major even that we have one in a row so

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.260 
major even that we have one in a row so
I<00:05:10.300> don't<00:05:11.300> know<00:05:12.400> yeah<00:05:13.400> let's<00:05:13.880> just<00:05:14.000> hope

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
I don't know yeah let's just hope

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.480 
I don't know yeah let's just hope
they're<00:05:14.479> gonna<00:05:14.599> be<00:05:14.780> even<00:05:15.710> more<00:05:15.860> afraid<00:05:16.159> of

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
they're gonna be even more afraid of

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:20.580 
they're gonna be even more afraid of
playing<00:05:17.240> against<00:05:17.900> us<00:05:18.020> then<00:05:18.830> they<00:05:19.280> were<00:05:19.610> before

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:20.590 
playing against us then they were before

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:23.620 
playing against us then they were before
so<00:05:21.590> esc<00:05:22.370> gaming<00:05:22.699> and<00:05:22.820> now<00:05:22.940> support<00:05:23.389> and<00:05:23.539> you

so<00:05:38.660> far<00:05:38.960> it's<00:05:39.140> been<00:05:39.260> great<00:05:39.560> we've<00:05:40.070> got<00:05:40.750> really

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
so far it's been great we've got really

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:47.640 
so far it's been great we've got really
a<00:05:42.020> lot<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.820> support<00:05:43.820> from<00:05:44.030> the<00:05:44.900> management<00:05:46.090> and

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:47.650 
a lot of support from the management and

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:51.520 
a lot of support from the management and
so<00:05:48.650> far<00:05:48.980> it<00:05:49.250> seems<00:05:49.760> great<00:05:50.600> but<00:05:50.870> you<00:05:51.500> know

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.530 
so far it seems great but you know

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.740 
so far it seems great but you know
anything<00:05:52.190> can<00:05:52.340> happen<00:05:52.460> like<00:05:52.910> you<00:05:53.210> did<00:05:53.480> with

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:53.750 
anything can happen like you did with

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:58.600 
anything can happen like you did with
mutual<00:05:54.620> makers<00:05:54.950> for<00:05:55.220> example<00:05:55.700> so<00:05:57.400> let's<00:05:58.400> just

00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:58.610 
mutual makers for example so let's just

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:02.260 
mutual makers for example so let's just
wait<00:05:58.790> and<00:05:58.970> see<00:05:59.150> let's<00:05:59.630> hope<00:06:00.280> to<00:06:01.280> you<00:06:01.700> know<00:06:01.820> to

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:02.270 
wait and see let's hope to you know to

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:06.310 
wait and see let's hope to you know to
be<00:06:03.670> PSC<00:06:04.670> to<00:06:04.820> be<00:06:04.940> a<00:06:04.970> stable<00:06:05.450> home<00:06:05.480> for<00:06:05.630> us<00:06:06.020> like

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
be PSC to be a stable home for us like

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.370 
be PSC to be a stable home for us like
for<00:06:06.620> example<00:06:06.650> fnatic<00:06:07.460> order<00:06:07.850> sk<00:06:08.240> had<00:06:08.510> for<00:06:09.050> so

00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:09.380 
for example fnatic order sk had for so

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:12.040 
for example fnatic order sk had for so
many<00:06:09.530> years<00:06:09.730> it<00:06:10.730> probably<00:06:11.390> would<00:06:11.600> have<00:06:11.630> been<00:06:11.840> a

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:12.050 
many years it probably would have been a

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:13.840 
many years it probably would have been a
big<00:06:12.470> difference<00:06:12.950> for<00:06:13.250> us<00:06:13.400> because<00:06:13.580> we've<00:06:13.790> been

00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:13.850 
big difference for us because we've been

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:16.990 
big difference for us because we've been
changing<00:06:14.390> the<00:06:14.570> team<00:06:14.780> and<00:06:15.550> struggling<00:06:16.550> a<00:06:16.850> lot

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:17.000
