00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.700
 gold island theory warning 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.650
 the theory that you will listen to next 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.410
 should be taken as what it really is 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:41.129
 a simple theory that might or might not be 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.170
 true the following theory is totally 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:45.840
 mine and any resemblance to another is 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.850
 because it makes a lot of sense xd yes 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.129
 you will find evidence that this 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.900
 theory is not true let me know in the 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:55.500
 comments 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.390
 let's start the golden island a lot has been 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.090
 speculated about this strange place 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.239
 many hypotheses that pendleton keeps 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.710
 denied by passing the chapters 

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 but what many have asked 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.240
 fans is what is there outside the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.729
 today's earth as seen in 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.190
 different chapters the land of eye is 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.289
 just an island a small island of the 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.080
 which have not been discovered all their 

00:01:16.289 --> 00:01:22.050
 surroundings as you can see on the map 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.479
 official of the land of gold that's why it's 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:26.640
 that the company greg days and associated to 

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:28.979
 have nothing to do we decided to do 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:31.020
 one theory one of many but with 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.530
 enough images and arguments from the 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.810
 series supporting him 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.600
 today's land is not the only place 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.770
 alive but there is life human life 

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.759
 out of it in the rest of the world 

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:46.119
 survivors of the great war of the 

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.920
 mushrooms look at the immense amount of 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:50.080
 objects that we use today and 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:52.659
 we find destroyed in the whole 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.280
 of the chapters that is garbage of the 

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:57.310
 survivors of the war that 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:59.710
 they ended up stranded in the land of gold and 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.180
 I know what they will say no, that is not true 

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:04.360
 are debris from the war of the 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:06.330
 mushrooms but not they have not 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:08.619
 put to think that all the debris 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.660
 buildings and appliances would not have been 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:13.000
 covered by vegetation and earth 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.100
 in all that time and that because of that 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.980
 there would be very little technology from our 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.989
 it was in view of all the land 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.440
 today receives garbage from humans 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:25.720
 survivors I talk about that thanks to the 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:27.670
 great mushroom war many 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.890
 rubble ended on that island 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.440
 us at the end of the great war of the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:34.390
 mushrooms we decided to throw all the 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.090
 debris and radioactive products in 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.010
 that island that after a thousand years the 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.750
 humans we forget that island 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.930
 with a small amount of 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.540
 humans that populate few places and 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:48.849
 possibly end can come from a group 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.260
 of fined humans which were 

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:52.750
 banished by humans 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.480
 survivors and finished on that island 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:57.610
 and order to be a baby his mother could have 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.610
 mutated and carried away to the island where 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:04.030
 was banished to protect it so it's 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:06.819
 I talk about them and humans but good 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.129
 I left the subject what I want to say with 

00:03:06.819 --> 00:03:11.349
 all this is that possibly the earth 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.109
 of gold is an island forgotten among the 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:15.849
 thousands existing but she is product 

00:03:14.109 --> 00:03:19.120
 of all the radiation of the war of the 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:21.970
 mushrooms and we humans the 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.250
 we have forgotten but of course within a thousand 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:26.170
 years because I do not think a bomb 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.720
 nuclear can end all life 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.269
 existing on the planet the bomb could 

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:34.180
 have fallen in the USA but I do not think 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:36.069
 destroy China too because for that 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.049
 the enemies would send a bomb to a 

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:40.030
 place to end up destroying 

00:03:38.049 --> 00:03:41.320
 everyone and killing them 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:44.150
 same 

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:46.430
 possibly an American country sent to 

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:49.460
 nuclear bomb to china and one of its islands 

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.290
 it became the land of gold this is 

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.390
 reinforces when we see the amount of 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:56.930
 products and announcements written a Japanese 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.670
 Chinese or such a language think about it 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:01.330
 I speak with you 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.330
 grace day
