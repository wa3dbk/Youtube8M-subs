00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:07.870
 They were created in 1958 by the cartoonist 

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:09.820
 pierre culliford this is really not 

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.499
 they were new main characters 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:13.419
 as we know it actually 

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.160
 we were secondary to a story 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:16.930
 called the peewee varnish adventures 

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.820
 in fact and its characters in some 

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.070
 chapter come out and the smurfs help them 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.870
 but well this is they had their comic that 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.220
 they see in the Smurfs nothing more and then already 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:26.830
 I do not know how they held their series of 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.720
 television in the 80s the Smurfs 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:30.670
 they are small beings that live in a 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:32.619
 village whose houses are shaped like mushrooms 

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.059
 this village is led by dad 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.590
 Smurf that is the most making of the 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:37.450
 smurfs although the fact afterwards in a 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.820
 chapter leaves grandfather Smurf who is 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:41.500
 even older is said to be born 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.000
 when the full moon comes out although the 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.920
 'Smurf' came to the village in a stork 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.560
 and then if I remember that in a chapter 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.610
 It goes where they are in a mushroom and leaves 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.899
 the pp smurf and so they give him something and with that 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.700
 is what is going to be for example cook 

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.399
 they gave him a spoon with a spoon 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.930
 Strain is constantly grab him 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:00.070
 he tried to catch them but the smurfs 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.800
 they always find a way to escape 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:04.420
 of him and his cat azrael about life in 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:06.310
 village you could say it 's pretty 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.530
 fun and parties pretty food e 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.510
 even sports competitions 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.950
 not typical Israeli gargamel student are 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:15.030
 bad but now I'm going to 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.770
 tell that it is counted upside down 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.210
 the titles have like that history 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.740
 of the ancient medieval sermons 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.240
 where they remind us that in the souls of 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.159
 the deceased babies and receive the 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.080
 sacrament of baptism or babies 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.549
 who died without being baptized in 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.170
 these stories the souls of babies 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.970
 they stay floating in limbo with the 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.159
 purgatory without the opportunity to go to 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.899
 sky because although they have their 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:36.030
 innocence because they carried the protagonist 

00:01:33.899 --> 00:01:37.680
 of inherited from the snow there are those who say 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.780
 that the Smurfs are blue because it's 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.130
 precisely the tonality of the skin in 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.500
 the bodies of the babies when they were 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.060
 found dead in their cribs these 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.770
 innocent souls become then 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.810
 in the representation of sins 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.280
 and the names and offices of the 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.039
 whistles are not responsible for remembering 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.500
 venial sins or deadly sins or 

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:58.200
 deadly sins' by I had like that 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:00.149
 they were seven sins but then counting 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.819
 the titles came out last good 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.920
 such are represented so lust is 

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.619
 Smurfette is the only woman who is 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.149
 among 100 Smurfs and apart she was 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.069
 created by gargamel only remains of 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.989
 black hair and it was ugly and then dad 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.120
 Smurf with a potion made her blonde and 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:17.970
 pretty voluptuous 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:20.250
 then it is angular that represents the 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:24.200
 greedy smurf greed of spirit 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.200
 it was selfish laziness obviously he
