and<00:01:22.890> more<00:01:23.490> importantly<00:01:23.820> when<00:01:24.030> it<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> synchro

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
and more importantly when it is synchro

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.140 
and more importantly when it is synchro
summon<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.290> synchro<00:01:25.439> summon<00:01:25.970> cannot<00:01:26.970> be

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
summon the synchro summon cannot be

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.789 
summon the synchro summon cannot be
negated<00:01:27.540> so<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:27.990> basically<00:01:28.080> stops<00:01:28.560> them<00:01:28.770> from

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
negated so it basically stops them from

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:31.249 
negated so it basically stops them from
getting<00:01:29.310> rid<00:01:29.579> of<00:01:29.610> it<00:01:29.759> at<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.299> start<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.750> very

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
getting rid of it at the start so very

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:33.050 
getting rid of it at the start so very
difficult<00:01:31.680> card<00:01:31.950> to<00:01:32.159> kind<00:01:32.460> of<00:01:32.520> get<00:01:32.640> rid<00:01:32.820> of<00:01:32.850> I

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
difficult card to kind of get rid of I

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.700 
difficult card to kind of get rid of I
know<00:01:33.119> compulsive<00:01:33.659> still<00:01:33.840> card<00:01:34.110> but<00:01:34.380> thing<00:01:34.650> is

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
know compulsive still card but thing is

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.410 
know compulsive still card but thing is
the<00:01:35.009> car<00:01:35.189> technically<00:01:35.670> is<00:01:35.820> out<00:01:35.909> one<00:01:36.090> right<00:01:36.270> now

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
the car technically is out one right now

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.170 
the car technically is out one right now
but<00:01:37.259> this<00:01:37.380> car<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.619> just<00:01:37.799> really<00:01:38.340> good<00:01:38.579> against

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
but this car is just really good against

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.090 
but this car is just really good against
certain<00:01:39.540> stalled<00:01:40.020> ex<00:01:40.259> anything<00:01:40.650> like<00:01:40.799> the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
certain stalled ex anything like the

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.999 
certain stalled ex anything like the
runs<00:01:41.280> battle<00:01:41.700> faders<00:01:42.290> scarecrows<00:01:43.290> those<00:01:43.799> cars

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
runs battle faders scarecrows those cars

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:45.710 
runs battle faders scarecrows those cars
just<00:01:44.189> really<00:01:44.490> good<00:01:44.640> because<00:01:44.820> you<00:01:45.119> make<00:01:45.270> it<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
just really good because you make it and

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.999 
just really good because you make it and
they<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.079> can't<00:01:46.259> respond<00:01:46.619> to<00:01:46.770> it<00:01:46.920> and

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
they just can't respond to it and

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:49.100 
they just can't respond to it and
therefore<00:01:47.640> you're<00:01:48.149> at<00:01:48.270> hacking<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> you<00:01:49.020> know

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
therefore you're at hacking and you know

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.539 
therefore you're at hacking and you know
it's<00:01:49.229> just<00:01:49.290> a<00:01:49.409> fantastic<00:01:49.770> hard<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.250> house<00:01:50.369> but

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
it's just a fantastic hard the house but

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:52.399 
it's just a fantastic hard the house but
plus<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.210> got<00:01:51.270> a<00:01:51.390> relatively<00:01:51.750> large<00:01:51.990> attack

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
plus it's got a relatively large attack

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.100 
plus it's got a relatively large attack
and<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> also<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.369> light<00:01:53.850> so<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.180> was<00:01:54.630> honest<00:01:54.990> if

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
and it also is light so it was honest if

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.139 
and it also is light so it was honest if
you<00:01:55.140> really<00:01:55.380> have<00:01:55.530> that<00:01:56.280> in<00:01:56.399> your<00:01:56.520> deck<00:01:56.700> but

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
you really have that in your deck but

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:59.060 
you really have that in your deck but

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
combo unfortunately we never really got

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.220 
combo unfortunately we never really got
to<00:02:11.069> see<00:02:11.280> this<00:02:11.430> see<00:02:11.970> much<00:02:12.239> play<00:02:12.480> I<00:02:12.690> know

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
to see this see much play I know

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.809 
to see this see much play I know
we'll<00:02:13.349> bring<00:02:13.500> out<00:02:13.620> maybe<00:02:13.800> one<00:02:14.220> per<00:02:14.459> duel<00:02:14.640> now

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
we'll bring out maybe one per duel now

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.000 
we'll bring out maybe one per duel now
but<00:02:15.239> i<00:02:15.300> think<00:02:15.390> is<00:02:15.510> before<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.900> was<00:02:16.170> like<00:02:16.349> every

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.010 
but i think is before it was like every

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:18.500 
but i think is before it was like every
game<00:02:17.159> you<00:02:17.190> could<00:02:17.430> just<00:02:17.580> spend<00:02:17.819> multiple<00:02:18.269> horse

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
