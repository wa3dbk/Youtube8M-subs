lumber and dirt to play with so let's

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:17.420 
lumber and dirt to play with so let's

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
open the box and take a look at what we

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:43.369 
open the box and take a look at what we
get<00:00:40.280> so<00:00:41.280> guys<00:00:41.550> it<00:00:41.850> only<00:00:42.030> came<00:00:42.329> with<00:00:42.629> like<00:00:42.899> four

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
get so guys it only came with like four

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.139 
get so guys it only came with like four
main<00:00:43.649> parts<00:00:43.950> but<00:00:44.430> there<00:00:44.610> and<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:45.030> no

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
main parts but there and there's no

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.400 
main parts but there and there's no
instructions<00:00:45.629> how<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:45.750> club<00:00:45.960> together<00:00:46.110> but

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
instructions how to club together but

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.900 
instructions how to club together but
I'm<00:00:46.469> sure<00:00:46.710> we'll<00:00:46.890> be<00:00:46.920> able<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.280> figure<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.789> out

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.840 
I'm sure we'll be able to figure it out
so<00:00:48.719> let's<00:00:48.960> take<00:00:49.260> a<00:00:49.289> look<00:00:49.620> guessing<00:00:50.370> this<00:00:50.520> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
so let's take a look guessing this the

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.049 
so let's take a look guessing this the
base<00:00:51.379> so<00:00:52.379> this<00:00:52.920> looks<00:00:53.100> like<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.550> would<00:00:53.610> fit<00:00:53.670> in

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
base so this looks like it would fit in

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:04.520 
base so this looks like it would fit in
here<00:00:54.680> pop<00:00:55.680> that<00:00:55.920> on<00:01:01.730> there<00:01:02.730> we<00:01:02.910> go<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
here pop that on there we go then this

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.350 
here pop that on there we go then this
is<00:01:04.830> the<00:01:05.390> sawmill<00:01:06.390> part<00:01:06.720> of<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.189> so<00:01:08.189> this<00:01:09.090> goes

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
is the sawmill part of it so this goes

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:18.490 
is the sawmill part of it so this goes
on<00:01:09.540> here<00:01:12.770> it's<00:01:13.770> kind<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> tricky<00:01:15.860> there<00:01:16.860> we<00:01:17.009> go

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
on here it's kind of tricky there we go

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:26.060 
on here it's kind of tricky there we go
forth<00:01:19.500> and<00:01:22.729> this<00:01:23.729> orange<00:01:24.180> bit<00:01:24.420> is<00:01:25.350> for<00:01:25.710> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
forth and this orange bit is for the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.109 
forth and this orange bit is for the
lumber<00:01:26.490> so<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:26.820> can<00:01:27.150> either<00:01:27.270> do<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.990> triangle

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
lumber so you can either do a triangle

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:37.370 
lumber so you can either do a triangle
circle<00:01:30.950> square<00:01:33.560> it's<00:01:34.560> pretty<00:01:34.860> cool

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.780 

going<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.440> pop<00:01:38.620> that<00:01:38.799> on<00:01:38.860> there<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:42.369> it<00:01:42.520> also

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:42.790 
going to pop that on there and it also

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.020 
going to pop that on there and it also
comes<00:01:43.299> with<00:01:43.710> small<00:01:44.710> count<00:01:45.070> of<00:01:45.369> brown<00:01:45.790> play-doh

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.040 
start making some number so i think i'll
start<00:02:24.250> off<00:02:24.459> with<00:02:24.940> the<00:02:24.970> triangle<00:02:25.660> shape<00:02:25.840> just

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
start off with the triangle shape just

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.229 
start off with the triangle shape just
cuts<00:02:26.320> already<00:02:26.590> there<00:02:27.040> i'm<00:02:27.640> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.880> use<00:02:28.030> some

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:28.239 
cuts already there i'm going to use some

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.270 
cuts already there i'm going to use some
brown<00:02:28.510> play-doh<00:02:29.370> open<00:02:30.370> metal<00:02:32.220> so<00:02:33.220> now<00:02:33.400> a

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.010 
Idol and then there's a hole in there

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.300 
Idol and then there's a hole in there
that<00:02:42.280> you<00:02:42.400> can<00:02:42.579> feed<00:02:42.850> the<00:02:43.030> play-doh<00:02:43.239> true

that you can feed the play-doh true

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.000 
that you can feed the play-doh true
let's<00:02:45.310> squeeze<00:02:45.610> that<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.440> it's<00:02:47.440> all<00:02:47.650> nicely

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.010 
let's squeeze that in it's all nicely

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.810 
let's squeeze that in it's all nicely
popped<00:02:48.549> in<00:02:49.620> so<00:02:50.620> that<00:02:50.769> way<00:02:50.980> when<00:02:51.370> you<00:02:51.549> push<00:02:51.790> down

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
popped in so that way when you push down

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.120 
popped in so that way when you push down
the<00:02:52.180> grey<00:02:52.360> part<00:02:52.630> again<00:02:52.930> it<00:02:53.560> comes<00:02:53.769> out<00:02:53.980> with

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
the grey part again it comes out with

00:02:54.130 --> 00:03:02.009 
the grey part again it comes out with
the<00:02:54.250> other<00:02:54.280> side<00:02:55.709> like<00:02:56.709> this<00:02:58.290> as<00:02:59.290> a<00:03:01.019> triangle

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
the other side like this as a triangle

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:06.810 
the other side like this as a triangle
look<00:03:04.049> now<00:03:05.049> that<00:03:05.079> we<00:03:05.410> have<00:03:05.440> that<00:03:05.620> shape<00:03:06.160> what

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
look now that we have that shape what

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:09.509 
look now that we have that shape what
we're<00:03:07.000> going<00:03:07.090> to<00:03:07.180> do<00:03:07.329> is<00:03:07.540> use<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.840> saw<00:03:08.519> so
