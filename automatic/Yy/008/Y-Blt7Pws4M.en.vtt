very straight to the point and talk
about<00:00:29.160> three<00:00:29.460> basic<00:00:30.060> reasons<00:00:30.480> you'll<00:00:30.689> want<00:00:30.929> to

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
about three basic reasons you'll want to

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.959 
about three basic reasons you'll want to
take<00:00:31.230> a<00:00:31.260> look<00:00:31.470> at<00:00:31.650> first<00:00:31.890> before<00:00:32.399> stressing

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
take a look at first before stressing

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:34.670 
take a look at first before stressing
out<00:00:33.059> about<00:00:33.090> your<00:00:33.390> diet<00:00:33.600> further<00:00:33.899> the<00:00:34.440> first

out about your diet further the first

out about your diet further the first
thing<00:00:34.860> we<00:00:34.950> want<00:00:35.100> to<00:00:35.160> talk<00:00:35.309> about<00:00:35.370> is<00:00:35.760> actually

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
thing we want to talk about is actually

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940 
thing we want to talk about is actually
under<00:00:36.510> estimating<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.230> amount<00:00:37.469> of<00:00:37.559> food<00:00:37.739> that

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
under estimating the amount of food that

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:40.040 
under estimating the amount of food that
you're<00:00:38.070> taking<00:00:38.399> in<00:00:38.579> so<00:00:39.210> what<00:00:39.360> I<00:00:39.390> mean<00:00:39.629> by<00:00:39.690> this

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
you're taking in so what I mean by this

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.869 
you're taking in so what I mean by this
is<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.260> lot<00:00:40.500> of<00:00:40.620> us<00:00:40.739> don't<00:00:41.040> measure<00:00:41.309> out<00:00:41.610> the

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
is a lot of us don't measure out the

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.209 
is a lot of us don't measure out the
food<00:00:42.149> that<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.480> eat<00:00:42.530> instead<00:00:43.530> what<00:00:43.739> we<00:00:43.860> do<00:00:44.070> is

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
food that we eat instead what we do is

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.220 
food that we eat instead what we do is
we<00:00:44.340> go<00:00:44.550> off<00:00:44.730> of<00:00:44.910> packages<00:00:45.480> and<00:00:45.510> serving<00:00:45.989> sizes

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
we go off of packages and serving sizes

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.410 
we go off of packages and serving sizes
and<00:00:46.739> generally<00:00:47.309> estimate<00:00:47.910> how<00:00:48.059> much<00:00:48.210> we're

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
and generally estimate how much we're

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.840 
and generally estimate how much we're
eating<00:00:48.750> well<00:00:49.440> this<00:00:49.620> helps<00:00:49.950> us<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.309> stress<00:00:50.670> out

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
eating well this helps us not stress out

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.520 
eating well this helps us not stress out
about<00:00:50.879> actually<00:00:51.600> counting<00:00:51.930> these<00:00:52.079> and<00:00:52.320> making

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
about actually counting these and making

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.410 
about actually counting these and making
it<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.680> lot<00:00:52.829> easier<00:00:53.219> what<00:00:53.879> it<00:00:53.969> also<00:00:54.120> could

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
it a lot easier what it also could

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.270 
it a lot easier what it also could
potentially<00:00:54.899> do<00:00:55.050> is<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.320> adding<00:00:55.710> in<00:00:55.829> hundreds

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
potentially do is be adding in hundreds

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
potentially do is be adding in hundreds
of<00:00:56.340> extra<00:00:56.760> calories<00:00:56.969> to<00:00:57.360> our<00:00:57.480> diet<00:00:57.750> that<00:00:57.899> go

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
of extra calories to our diet that go

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.619 
of extra calories to our diet that go
unaccounted<00:00:58.770> for<00:00:58.800> other<00:00:59.760> ways<00:01:00.120> we<00:01:00.329> can<00:01:00.510> go

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
unaccounted for other ways we can go

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.330 
unaccounted for other ways we can go
about<00:01:00.660> this<00:01:01.079> is<00:01:01.289> not<00:01:01.410> counting<00:01:01.649> certain<00:01:02.070> foods

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
about this is not counting certain foods

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.210 
about this is not counting certain foods
maybe<00:01:02.640> such<00:01:02.940> as<00:01:03.059> vegetables<00:01:03.629> dressings<00:01:04.439> also

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
maybe such as vegetables dressings also

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.289 
maybe such as vegetables dressings also
a<00:01:05.250> lot<00:01:05.489> of<00:01:05.519> the<00:01:05.729> drinks<00:01:06.090> that<00:01:06.119> contain

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
a lot of the drinks that contain

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.090 
a lot of the drinks that contain
calories<00:01:07.020> that<00:01:07.170> we<00:01:07.290> might<00:01:07.500> forget<00:01:07.740> to<00:01:07.920> count

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
calories that we might forget to count

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.700 
calories that we might forget to count
so<00:01:08.939> this<00:01:09.540> is<00:01:09.720> something<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:10.080> take<00:01:10.260> a<00:01:10.290> look<00:01:10.560> at

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
so this is something to take a look at

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:12.530 
so this is something to take a look at
and<00:01:10.950> take<00:01:11.040> into<00:01:11.220> consideration<00:01:12.000> if<00:01:12.180> you're

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and take into consideration if you're

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.760 
and take into consideration if you're
not<00:01:12.720> losing<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.290> weight<00:01:13.439> that<00:01:13.619> you're

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
not losing the weight that you're

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.710 
not losing the weight that you're
wanting<00:01:13.890> to<00:01:14.210> playing<00:01:15.210> along<00:01:15.509> those<00:01:15.689> same

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
wanting to playing along those same

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.420 
wanting to playing along those same
lines<00:01:15.960> and<00:01:16.439> other<00:01:16.590> things<00:01:16.890> we<00:01:17.100> might<00:01:17.250> be

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
lines and other things we might be

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.460 
lines and other things we might be
overestimating<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.540> the<00:01:18.840> amount<00:01:19.020> of<00:01:19.049> exercise

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
overestimating is the amount of exercise

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.080 
overestimating is the amount of exercise
we're<00:01:19.710> actually<00:01:19.830> doing<00:01:20.220> or<00:01:20.400> our<00:01:20.610> activity

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
we're actually doing or our activity

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
we're actually doing or our activity
level<00:01:21.420> so<00:01:21.960> what<00:01:22.080> I<00:01:22.110> mean<00:01:22.290> by<00:01:22.470> that<00:01:22.500> is<00:01:22.920> if<00:01:23.159> we're

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
level so what I mean by that is if we're

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.280 
level so what I mean by that is if we're
using<00:01:23.580> maybe<00:01:24.030> let's<00:01:24.270> say<00:01:24.420> the<00:01:24.540> treadmill<00:01:25.049> or

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
using maybe let's say the treadmill or

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.469 
using maybe let's say the treadmill or
the<00:01:25.770> stair<00:01:26.009> stepper<00:01:26.340> at<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.670> gym<00:01:26.939> to<00:01:27.240> really

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the stair stepper at the gym to really

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:28.969 
the stair stepper at the gym to really
get<00:01:27.600> a<00:01:27.630> good<00:01:27.840> idea<00:01:27.930> of<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.320> many<00:01:28.380> calories<00:01:28.770> are

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
get a good idea of how many calories are

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.920 
get a good idea of how many calories are
burning<00:01:29.250> that<00:01:29.909> might<00:01:30.240> not<00:01:30.420> be<00:01:30.450> a<00:01:30.659> true

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
burning that might not be a true

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.810 
burning that might not be a true
indicator<00:01:31.439> of<00:01:31.740> our<00:01:31.920> actual<00:01:32.070> total<00:01:32.610> caloric

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
indicator of our actual total caloric

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.990
