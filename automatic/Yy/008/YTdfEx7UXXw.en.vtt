00:00:01.820 --> 00:00:04.820
 good 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.180
 of course one of them is that it's going to 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.119
 play iker squares in the goal in the 

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.980
 defense these two as I told you one 

00:00:17.119 --> 00:00:21.220
 to the bench in the best of the 

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.220
 scenarios 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:25.820
 and another to the tier 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:28.579
 right now pp has no choice of 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.439
 be concentrated with what and here is 

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:32.439
 just a change that is rafa ballan 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.140
 carvajal will make bouquets with entering and 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:40.690
 squares these five give them for landlines is 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:44.270
 say more marcelo a sidewalk that would say 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.890
 that these five give them for landlines 

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.350
 now comes the debate that I want 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.300
 tell you and I want to throw at the table 

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:52.430
 tiki taka because here is some 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.130
 variant there are not many but here there 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:58.130
 some variables remain six positions and 

00:00:55.130 --> 00:01:00.530
 There are two possibilities that ancelotti chooses 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.100
 that he is thinking that he is 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.430
 thinking 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.380
 according to I speak with you who opts for a 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:08.750
 4-4-2 as he did for example against the 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.820
 barça in the cup final truth or 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.860
 some more party or that opts for a 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.800
 4-3-3 what 90 has done for 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.990
 hundred of the matches of the year are worth 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:21.040
 option 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.579
 first option 442 here the option that 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:27.159
 I would have 0 you would be di Maria 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:30.070
 illarramendi modric isco and above belli 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:31.659
 Christian I already tell you there are six players 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.000
 and I told you that the other five are 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.270
 fixed is worth of the other six that remain 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.020
 what are these six there are four fixed 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.689
 We are really talking about two 

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:44.289
 put nothing else because it's fixed limaría 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.930
 is fixed mobile is fixed Christian and is 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.790
 fixed gareth bale 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:51.030
 that is to say right now the madrid has 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.500
 nine safe players to play the 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:59.560
 Saturday lisbon nine insurance 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.040
 carvajal squares vamos coentrao 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.710
 di maría 

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:06.830
 modric bale and christian 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.060
 has two sites and both are center 

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the field or center of the field and attack 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.759
 It depends on what you decide or gives more 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:12.890
 tracks 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:16.760
 morata is not going to be a morata is not going to 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:21.050
 play first then there may 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:22.970
 be 4 4 ​​2 or 4 3 3 with 4 4 2 is that at 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:25.700
 final I'm removing cards from the deck and 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.850
 many are not and they were of Illarra 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:31.700
 isco is a possibility now I take the 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.709
 another about this you tell me look is more 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:35.569
 feasible seems to me the most 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:37.070
 likely I think ancelotti to play 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:38.900
 with four in the middle he also did 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.970
 before the bayern and it worked very well for me 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.590
 not qualify Gareth Bale beat of 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.360
 left and with and with di maría in the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.550
 right band I think it's going to be that the 

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.930
 option and from there is that you 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:49.459
 you said is that you do not have many more 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:51.380
 dolls is that you have left 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:54.019
 casemiro and is that he has left khedira and already 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.700
 is at the time of using those six 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.920
 put then already the variant of playing 

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:00.050
 433 I see it more improbable I think 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.489
 that not being benzema the team to 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.450
 playing midfield for dante is going to be 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:04.450
 that sure I 'm going
