in<00:01:50.490> marshmallow<00:01:51.030> fondant<00:01:51.300> because<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.560> thought

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
in marshmallow fondant because I thought

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.540 
in marshmallow fondant because I thought
was<00:01:52.979> cheaper<00:01:53.520> and<00:01:53.729> and<00:01:54.619> everything<00:01:55.619> else<00:01:55.800> but

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:56.550 
was cheaper and and everything else but

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.719 
was cheaper and and everything else but
I<00:01:57.030> just<00:01:57.270> cover<00:01:57.750> them<00:01:58.110> so<00:01:58.470> much<00:01:58.649> easier<00:01:59.250> to<00:01:59.490> work

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
I just cover them so much easier to work

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.899 
I just cover them so much easier to work
or<00:02:00.330> the<00:02:00.479> real<00:02:00.690> fondant<00:02:01.259> and<00:02:03.170> the<00:02:04.170> finishing

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:04.909 
or the real fondant and the finishing

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:07.640 
or the real fondant and the finishing
appearance<00:02:05.909> is<00:02:06.119> so<00:02:06.479> much<00:02:06.659> better<00:02:06.869> itself<00:02:07.409> I

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
appearance is so much better itself I

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:10.280 
appearance is so much better itself I
decide<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.519> start<00:02:08.880> using<00:02:09.119> that<00:02:09.479> one<00:02:09.660> actually

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:10.290 
decide to start using that one actually

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:12.949 
decide to start using that one actually
the<00:02:10.500> the<00:02:11.130> pink<00:02:11.459> is<00:02:12.090> marshmallow<00:02:12.720> fondant

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the the pink is marshmallow fondant

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:16.100 
the the pink is marshmallow fondant
because<00:02:13.590> you<00:02:13.950> don't<00:02:14.160> need<00:02:15.030> to<00:02:15.180> put<00:02:15.390> pink<00:02:15.810> color

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
because you don't need to put pink color

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:19.910 
because you don't need to put pink color
on<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.590> I<00:02:16.769> use<00:02:17.220> them<00:02:17.519> strawberry<00:02:18.920> marshmallow

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
on it I use them strawberry marshmallow

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.449 
on it I use them strawberry marshmallow
so<00:02:20.640> is<00:02:20.790> already<00:02:21.120> think<00:02:21.390> so<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.890> don't<00:02:23.130> need<00:02:23.250> to

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:23.459 
so is already think so you don't need to

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.140 
so is already think so you don't need to
use<00:02:23.670> anything<00:02:23.970> else<00:02:24.239> is<00:02:24.570> already<00:02:24.750> done<00:02:25.140> so

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
use anything else is already done so

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.750 
use anything else is already done so
