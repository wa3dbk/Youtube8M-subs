00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
running at those four different settings

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:06.570 
running at those four different settings
at<00:01:04.570> 1440p<00:01:05.379> those<00:01:06.039> of<00:01:06.130> you<00:01:06.220> that<00:01:06.310> are<00:01:06.399> curious

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
at 1440p those of you that are curious

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.249 
at 1440p those of you that are curious
how<00:01:06.759> to<00:01:06.820> run<00:01:07.030> at<00:01:07.119> 1080p<00:01:07.660> we're<00:01:07.960> going<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.140> give

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:08.259 
how to run at 1080p we're going to give

00:01:08.259 --> 00:01:09.630 
how to run at 1080p we're going to give
you<00:01:08.289> a<00:01:08.380> list<00:01:08.500> of<00:01:08.619> benchmarks<00:01:09.039> for<00:01:09.100> that<00:01:09.250> after

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
you a list of benchmarks for that after

00:01:09.640 --> 00:02:52.290 
you a list of benchmarks for that after
the<00:01:09.729> video<00:01:09.940> as<00:01:10.149> well<00:01:10.180> so<00:01:10.780> let's<00:01:11.170> check<00:01:11.350> it<00:01:11.440> out

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:52.300 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.970 

so<00:02:52.870> that's<00:02:52.990> how<00:02:53.110> the<00:02:53.170> game<00:02:53.350> looks<00:02:53.380> running<00:02:53.890> at

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:53.980 
so that's how the game looks running at

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.040 
so that's how the game looks running at
those<00:02:54.160> four<00:02:54.460> different<00:02:54.730> settings<00:02:54.910> at<00:02:55.210> 1440p

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
those four different settings at 1440p

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.320 
those four different settings at 1440p
now<00:02:56.470> if<00:02:56.650> you<00:02:56.740> run<00:02:56.920> it<00:02:57.040> at<00:02:57.130> 1080p<00:02:57.670> you<00:02:57.970> are<00:02:58.180> of

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
now if you run it at 1080p you are of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:59.700 
now if you run it at 1080p you are of
course<00:02:58.480> going<00:02:58.750> to<00:02:58.840> see<00:02:58.990> an<00:02:59.110> improvement<00:02:59.410> in

00:02:59.700 --> 00:02:59.710 
course going to see an improvement in

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.620 
course going to see an improvement in
the<00:02:59.770> framerate<00:03:00.160> at<00:03:00.550> low<00:03:00.760> settings<00:03:01.150> our<00:03:01.330> system

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:01.630 
the framerate at low settings our system

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:03.900 
the framerate at low settings our system
was<00:03:01.750> getting<00:03:01.960> about<00:03:02.050> 67<00:03:02.770> point<00:03:03.010> 3<00:03:03.400> frames<00:03:03.730> per

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
was getting about 67 point 3 frames per

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:06.930 
was getting about 67 point 3 frames per
second<00:03:04.270> at<00:03:04.390> medium<00:03:05.080> we<00:03:05.200> were<00:03:05.320> seeing<00:03:05.670> 63.8<00:03:06.670> at

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:06.940 
second at medium we were seeing 63.8 at

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.670 
second at medium we were seeing 63.8 at
high<00:03:07.570> 55<00:03:08.170> point<00:03:08.590> 6<00:03:08.950> and<00:03:09.190> at<00:03:09.700> Ultra<00:03:10.150> 47<00:03:10.960> point<00:03:11.260> 3

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.770 
high 55 point 6 and at Ultra 47 point 3
now<00:03:12.310> as<00:03:12.490> far<00:03:12.640> as<00:03:12.700> the<00:03:12.880> actual<00:03:13.000> gameplay<00:03:13.510> itself

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
now as far as the actual gameplay itself

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.990 
now as far as the actual gameplay itself
goes<00:03:14.020> not<00:03:14.320> just<00:03:14.350> how<00:03:14.710> it<00:03:14.740> looks<00:03:15.160> I'm<00:03:15.700> still

00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:16.000 
goes not just how it looks I'm still

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.280 
goes not just how it looks I'm still
working<00:03:16.270> my<00:03:16.300> way<00:03:16.390> through<00:03:16.510> it<00:03:16.720> right<00:03:16.930> now<00:03:17.080> so<00:03:17.260> I

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
working my way through it right now so I

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.930 
working my way through it right now so I
don't<00:03:17.440> feel<00:03:17.590> comfortable<00:03:17.800> just<00:03:18.310> yet<00:03:18.400> bringing

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:18.940 
don't feel comfortable just yet bringing
