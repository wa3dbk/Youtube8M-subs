yeah<00:03:49.290> we<00:03:49.949> really<00:03:50.189> had<00:03:50.340> to<00:03:50.370> go<00:03:50.639> through<00:03:50.819> the

00:03:50.929 --> 00:03:50.939 
yeah we really had to go through the

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:53.149 
yeah we really had to go through the
process<00:03:51.090> of<00:03:51.530> making<00:03:52.530> sure<00:03:52.799> that<00:03:52.829> we<00:03:53.040> were

00:03:53.149 --> 00:03:53.159 
process of making sure that we were

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:55.640 
process of making sure that we were
ready<00:03:53.310> before<00:03:53.909> we<00:03:54.090> adopted<00:03:54.750> but<00:03:54.959> adopting<00:03:55.500> was

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
ready before we adopted but adopting was

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:57.679 
ready before we adopted but adopting was
definitely<00:03:56.099> better<00:03:56.250> than<00:03:56.400> buying<00:03:57.000> from<00:03:57.299> a<00:03:57.479> pet

00:03:57.679 --> 00:03:57.689 
definitely better than buying from a pet

I<00:03:58.229> guess<00:03:58.739> these<00:03:58.889> animals<00:03:59.370> they've<00:03:59.549> been

00:03:59.949 --> 00:03:59.959 
I guess these animals they've been

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.509 
I guess these animals they've been
abandoned<00:04:00.959> or<00:04:01.259> given<00:04:01.620> away<00:04:01.829> by<00:04:01.859> their<00:04:02.159> owners

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:02.519 
abandoned or given away by their owners

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:04.009 
abandoned or given away by their owners
and<00:04:02.819> I<00:04:02.939> think<00:04:03.150> they<00:04:03.239> deserve<00:04:03.389> a<00:04:03.689> lot<00:04:03.840> more<00:04:03.870> than

00:04:04.009 --> 00:04:04.019 
and I think they deserve a lot more than

00:04:04.019 --> 00:04:06.610 
and I think they deserve a lot more than
that
