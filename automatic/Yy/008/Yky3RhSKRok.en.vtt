surveying them to see what kind of
damage<00:00:45.059> we<00:00:45.390> might<00:00:45.539> have<00:00:45.660> experienced<00:00:46.110> from

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
damage we might have experienced from

the<00:00:46.289> most<00:00:46.469> recent<00:00:46.829> rains<00:00:47.120> so<00:00:48.120> that's<00:00:48.300> re-wrote

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
the most recent rains so that's re-wrote

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.049 
the most recent rains so that's re-wrote
an<00:00:48.840> issue<00:00:48.989> right<00:00:49.200> here<00:00:49.460> and<00:00:50.460> we<00:00:50.550> put<00:00:50.730> a<00:00:50.760> drain

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
an issue right here and we put a drain

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.260 
an issue right here and we put a drain
in<00:00:51.980> but<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.129> obvious<00:00:53.520> we<00:00:53.730> thought<00:00:54.000> we<00:00:54.149> were

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
in but it's obvious we thought we were

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.850 
in but it's obvious we thought we were
capturing<00:00:54.660> where<00:00:55.050> most<00:00:55.260> the<00:00:55.379> water<00:00:55.500> drains

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
capturing where most the water drains

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.319 
capturing where most the water drains
but<00:00:55.980> we<00:00:56.070> need<00:00:56.190> to<00:00:56.309> lower<00:00:56.489> this<00:00:56.699> and<00:00:56.910> maybe<00:00:57.000> put

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
but we need to lower this and maybe put

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.849 
but we need to lower this and maybe put
a<00:00:57.360> little<00:00:57.539> channel<00:00:58.050> or<00:00:58.170> curtain<00:00:58.620> drain

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
a little channel or curtain drain

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:02.049 
a little channel or curtain drain
something<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.520> direct<00:01:00.000> it<00:01:00.149> more<00:01:00.359> into<00:01:00.750> the

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:02.059 
something to direct it more into the

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.670 
something to direct it more into the
drain<00:01:03.059> itself<00:01:03.390> it's<00:01:04.199> just<00:01:04.350> learning<00:01:04.559> your

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
drain itself it's just learning your

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:05.929 
drain itself it's just learning your
vineyard<00:01:04.949> it<00:01:05.100> takes<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.339> couple<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.610> years<00:01:05.760> to

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
vineyard it takes a couple of years to

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.520 
vineyard it takes a couple of years to
figure<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.240> where<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.510> water<00:01:06.720> travels<00:01:07.350> and

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
figure out where the water travels and

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.950 
figure out where the water travels and
then<00:01:07.650> take<00:01:08.159> care<00:01:08.310> of<00:01:08.369> it<00:01:08.610> and<00:01:08.729> that's<00:01:08.930> kind<00:01:09.930> of

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
then take care of it and that's kind of

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.030 
then take care of it and that's kind of
what<00:01:10.049> we're<00:01:10.200> going<00:01:10.290> to<00:01:10.380> be<00:01:10.560> doing<00:01:10.680> here<00:01:10.920> in<00:01:10.979> the

it's so pretty in the mouth and see
that's<00:02:05.390> when<00:02:05.510> you're<00:02:05.600> talking<00:02:05.870> about<00:02:05.990> dig<00:02:06.170> was

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:06.260 
that's when you're talking about dig was

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:07.810 
that's when you're talking about dig was
asking<00:02:06.530> about<00:02:06.590> bottling<00:02:07.070> I<00:02:07.220> just<00:02:07.400> tasted<00:02:07.580> that

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:07.820 
asking about bottling I just tasted that

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.460 
asking about bottling I just tasted that
04<00:02:08.240> and<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:08.540> barrel<00:02:08.840> I<00:02:08.930> just<00:02:09.140> felt<00:02:09.260> like<00:02:09.320> the

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:09.470 
04 and the barrel I just felt like the

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.440 
04 and the barrel I just felt like the
texture<00:02:09.860> was<00:02:09.890> there<00:02:10.430> the<00:02:10.730> intensity<00:02:11.150> of<00:02:11.300> fruit

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
texture was there the intensity of fruit

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:12.280 
texture was there the intensity of fruit
was<00:02:11.570> there<00:02:11.720> we<00:02:11.840> didn't<00:02:11.990> want<00:02:12.110> to<00:02:12.170> lose

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
was there we didn't want to lose

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:14.620 
was there we didn't want to lose
anything<00:02:12.560> by<00:02:12.830> barrel-aging<00:02:13.280> it<00:02:13.520> more<00:02:13.760> I<00:02:14.060> think

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
anything by barrel-aging it more I think

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.790 
anything by barrel-aging it more I think
it<00:02:14.840> came<00:02:14.930> together<00:02:15.110> beautifully<00:02:15.380> in<00:02:15.740> the

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
it came together beautifully in the

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:19.570 
it came together beautifully in the
bottle<00:02:16.160> back<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:18.170> think<00:02:19.040> Pinot<00:02:19.190> Noir<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.430> the

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
bottle back I think Pinot Noir is the

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.910 
bottle back I think Pinot Noir is the
hardest<00:02:20.000> variety<00:02:20.510> of<00:02:20.540> grape<00:02:20.780> to<00:02:21.110> make<00:02:21.290> and<00:02:21.620> do

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
hardest variety of grape to make and do

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.550 
hardest variety of grape to make and do
it<00:02:22.100> well<00:02:22.250> and<00:02:22.550> i<00:02:23.390> like<00:02:23.630> to<00:02:23.750> say<00:02:23.930> if<00:02:24.140> you've<00:02:24.290> done

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.320 

normally<00:04:06.620> I<00:04:06.680> would<00:04:06.800> spit<00:04:07.010> this<00:04:07.099> out<00:04:07.280> it's<00:04:08.180> too

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:08.330 
normally I would spit this out it's too

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:11.440 
normally I would spit this out it's too
good<00:04:08.420> to<00:04:08.480> spit<00:04:08.750> out<00:04:09.519> when<00:04:10.519> we're<00:04:10.640> finished<00:04:10.910> and

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
good to spit out when we're finished and

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:13.030 
good to spit out when we're finished and
you<00:04:12.200> have<00:04:12.349> the<00:04:12.470> sense<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:12.800> accomplishment

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
you have the sense of accomplishment

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.729 
you have the sense of accomplishment
because<00:04:13.580> a<00:04:13.730> lot<00:04:13.940> of<00:04:13.970> the<00:04:14.180> tasks<00:04:14.660> in<00:04:15.019> winemaking

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:15.739 
because a lot of the tasks in winemaking

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:19.210 
because a lot of the tasks in winemaking
are<00:04:16.810> finite<00:04:17.810> you<00:04:18.019> get<00:04:18.260> through<00:04:18.560> them<00:04:18.739> and<00:04:19.010> you

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:19.220 
are finite you get through them and you

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:21.099 
are finite you get through them and you
know<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.430> put<00:04:19.970> the<00:04:20.090> wine<00:04:20.269> to<00:04:20.600> barrel<00:04:20.930> and

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
know you put the wine to barrel and

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:22.870 
know you put the wine to barrel and
that's<00:04:21.260> done<00:04:21.620> are<00:04:21.889> you<00:04:21.919> rack<00:04:22.430> to<00:04:22.639> wine<00:04:22.850> and

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:22.880 
that's done are you rack to wine and

00:04:22.880 --> 00:04:24.850 
that's done are you rack to wine and
that's<00:04:23.240> done<00:04:23.570> and<00:04:23.840> so<00:04:24.139> you<00:04:24.229> can<00:04:24.410> have<00:04:24.560> a<00:04:24.590> sense

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:24.860 
that's done and so you can have a sense

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:26.560 
that's done and so you can have a sense
of<00:04:24.949> accomplishment<00:04:25.190> but<00:04:26.150> there's<00:04:26.360> always

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:26.570 
of accomplishment but there's always

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:27.939 
of accomplishment but there's always
again<00:04:27.139> there's<00:04:27.350> always<00:04:27.530> that<00:04:27.650> kind<00:04:27.830> of

00:04:27.939 --> 00:04:27.949 
again there's always that kind of

00:04:27.949 --> 00:04:30.430 
again there's always that kind of
planning<00:04:28.520> and<00:04:28.760> thinking<00:04:29.030> ahead<00:04:29.660> that<00:04:30.199> takes

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
planning and thinking ahead that takes

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200 
planning and thinking ahead that takes
place<00:04:30.650> and<00:04:30.919> so<00:04:31.010> after<00:04:31.220> you've<00:04:31.490> done<00:04:31.699> that<00:04:31.760> task

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:32.210 
place and so after you've done that task

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:35.310 
place and so after you've done that task
and<00:04:32.660> I<00:04:32.900> should<00:04:33.560> go<00:04:33.620> home<00:04:33.770> and<00:04:33.830> go<00:04:34.010> for<00:04:34.220> a<00:04:34.250> walk

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.320 
and I should go home and go for a walk

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:39.969 
and I should go home and go for a walk
but<00:04:37.660> kind<00:04:38.660> of<00:04:38.810> straighten<00:04:39.650> out<00:04:39.740> in<00:04:39.830> my<00:04:39.950> head

00:04:39.969 --> 00:04:39.979 
but kind of straighten out in my head

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.700 
but kind of straighten out in my head
okay<00:04:40.729> what's<00:04:41.000> kind<00:04:41.630> of<00:04:41.690> the<00:04:41.750> next<00:04:41.990> game<00:04:42.380> plan

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:42.710 
okay what's kind of the next game plan

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.590 
okay what's kind of the next game plan
for<00:04:43.070> the<00:04:43.160> week<00:04:43.340> for<00:04:43.639> the<00:04:43.760> month<00:04:43.940> for<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.270> year

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 
for the week for the month for the year

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.659 
for the week for the month for the year
and<00:04:44.840> I<00:04:44.930> do<00:04:44.990> a<00:04:45.110> lot<00:04:45.350> of<00:04:45.380> thinking<00:04:45.889> about<00:04:46.010> the

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
and I do a lot of thinking about the

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:51.040 
and I do a lot of thinking about the
future<00:04:48.430> winter<00:04:49.430> doesn't<00:04:50.150> seem<00:04:50.479> very<00:04:50.510> slow<00:04:51.020> to

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
future winter doesn't seem very slow to

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.320 
future winter doesn't seem very slow to
us
