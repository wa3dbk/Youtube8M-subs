00:00:08.749 --> 00:00:09.829

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:11.899
 integration 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:14.679

 I walked around the market trying to decipher 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.020
 I was expecting the killer 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.340
 and it was difficult to identify 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.589
 however conditioned 

00:00:39.589 --> 00:00:41.250
 to be honest 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.280

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.080
 this exit here 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:46.880

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.800
