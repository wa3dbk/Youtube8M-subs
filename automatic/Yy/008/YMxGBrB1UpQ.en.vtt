00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.559 

and<00:00:00.269> let's<00:00:00.840> get<00:00:01.050> in<00:00:01.260> take<00:00:01.740> you<00:00:01.890> for<00:00:02.100> a<00:00:02.129> ride

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.600 

okay<00:00:06.569> I'm<00:00:07.140> going<00:00:07.290> to<00:00:07.350> start<00:00:07.620> it<00:00:07.770> watch<00:00:08.460> the

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:08.610 
okay I'm going to start it watch the

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.040 
okay I'm going to start it watch the
temperature<00:00:09.000> come<00:00:09.240> down<00:00:09.420> it's<00:00:09.690> just<00:00:09.900> from

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:10.050 
temperature come down it's just from

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.959 
temperature come down it's just from
sitting<00:00:11.450> starts<00:00:12.450> right<00:00:12.690> up<00:00:13.759> idles<00:00:14.759> well

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
sitting starts right up idles well

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.470 
sitting starts right up idles well
you'll<00:00:15.929> gauge<00:00:16.199> works<00:00:17.240> temperature<00:00:18.240> coming

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
you'll gauge works temperature coming

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.210 
you'll gauge works temperature coming
down<00:00:18.750> now<00:00:18.990> that<00:00:19.140> the<00:00:19.230> water<00:00:19.439> pump<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.830> spinning

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:20.220 
down now that the water pump is spinning

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.670 
down now that the water pump is spinning
and<00:00:20.369> this<00:00:20.820> is<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> fly<00:00:21.390> off<00:00:21.570> emergency<00:00:22.439> brake

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
and this is a fly off emergency brake

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:31.010 
and this is a fly off emergency brake
which<00:00:23.519> works<00:00:23.789> great<00:00:24.800> here<00:00:25.800> we<00:00:25.980> go

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:31.020 

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.920 

it's<00:00:31.320> an<00:00:31.470> amazing<00:00:32.160> sound<00:00:32.550> but<00:00:33.390> the<00:00:33.540> sound<00:00:33.810> of

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:33.930 
it's an amazing sound but the sound of

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.960 
it's an amazing sound but the sound of
the<00:00:34.020> spark<00:00:37.130> so<00:00:38.130> now<00:00:38.280> the<00:00:38.340> temperature<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:38.790> down

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:38.970 
the spark so now the temperature is down

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.330 
the spark so now the temperature is down
about<00:00:39.239> 185<00:00:40.020> which<00:00:40.559> is<00:00:40.739> where<00:00:40.950> we'd<00:00:41.129> like<00:00:41.309> to

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
about 185 which is where we'd like to

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:47.320 
about 185 which is where we'd like to
see<00:00:41.700> it<00:00:44.780> there<00:00:45.780> we<00:00:45.900> go

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:47.330 
see it there we go

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.550 
see it there we go
burnings<00:00:48.330> in<00:00:48.449> the<00:00:48.540> road

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:51.560 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:56.510 

you<00:00:51.830> hear<00:00:52.040> how<00:00:52.160> great<00:00:52.430> it<00:00:52.730> sounds

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.530 

microphones<00:00:57.520> aren't<00:00:57.879> very<00:00:58.059> good<00:00:58.270> especially

00:00:58.530 --> 00:00:58.540 
microphones aren't very good especially

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.950 
microphones aren't very good especially
when<00:00:58.960> they<00:00:59.110> go<00:00:59.260> online<00:00:59.469> the<00:01:00.280> video<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:00.960> get

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
when they go online the video and get

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:20.530 
when they go online the video and get
scratchy<00:01:02.379> but<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:03.220> sounds<00:01:03.879> beautiful

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:20.540 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.610 

really<00:01:21.540> well<00:01:21.860> oil<00:01:22.860> pressure<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> up<00:01:23.610> at<00:01:24.620> 74

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
really well oil pressure is up at 74

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.270 
really well oil pressure is up at 74
about<00:01:25.860> 3,000<00:01:26.730> rpms<00:01:27.180> so<00:01:27.530> really<00:01:28.530> strong<00:01:28.860> engine

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280 
about 3,000 rpms so really strong engine

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.160 
about 3,000 rpms so really strong engine
that<00:01:29.460> was<00:01:29.580> recently<00:01:29.970> rebuilt<00:01:32.930> nicely<00:01:33.930> here<00:01:34.140> in

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
that was recently rebuilt nicely here in

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:52.690

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.959 

4000<00:01:53.700> rpm<00:01:54.119> I<00:01:55.100> just<00:01:56.100> want<00:01:56.340> to<00:01:56.399> do<00:01:56.490> that<00:01:56.640> all<00:01:56.820> day

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
4000 rpm I just want to do that all day

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:09.980 
4000 rpm I just want to do that all day
long<00:01:57.000> it<00:01:57.329> sounds<00:01:57.659> so<00:01:57.810> good
