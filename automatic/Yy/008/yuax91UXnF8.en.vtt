right so what a color stays well this

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.940 
right so what a color stays well this

then<00:01:59.780> you<00:01:59.990> notice<00:02:00.619> that<00:02:00.649> my<00:02:01.009> left<00:02:01.430> hand<00:02:01.759> side

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
then you notice that my left hand side

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.300 
then you notice that my left hand side
collar<00:02:02.329> is<00:02:02.540> still<00:02:02.869> a<00:02:02.899> little<00:02:03.259> bit<00:02:03.469> more<00:02:03.920> neater

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:04.310 
collar is still a little bit more neater

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.969 
collar is still a little bit more neater
and<00:02:04.460> cleaner<00:02:04.670> than<00:02:05.450> the<00:02:05.780> right<00:02:06.020> hand<00:02:06.350> side<00:02:06.710> and

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979 
and cleaner than the right hand side and

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:09.370 
and cleaner than the right hand side and
again<00:02:07.369> there<00:02:07.610> is<00:02:07.729> a<00:02:07.759> reason<00:02:08.269> for<00:02:08.299> this<00:02:08.540> the

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
again there is a reason for this the

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.350 
again there is a reason for this the
extension<00:02:10.129> of<00:02:10.220> the<00:02:10.399> traditional<00:02:10.640> collar

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
extension of the traditional collar

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.220 
extension of the traditional collar
state<00:02:11.690> is

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
state is

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.470 
state is
magnetic<00:02:12.830> collar<00:02:13.310> state<00:02:13.640> which<00:02:13.879> is<00:02:14.030> basically

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
magnetic collar state which is basically

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.869 
magnetic collar state which is basically
just<00:02:14.599> the<00:02:14.989> traditional<00:02:15.860> metal<00:02:16.099> collar<00:02:16.489> state

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:16.879 
just the traditional metal collar state

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:19.420 
just the traditional metal collar state
which<00:02:17.360> also<00:02:17.629> includes<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.319> little<00:02:18.709> magnet<00:02:19.250> like

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
which also includes a little magnet like

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.220 
which also includes a little magnet like
this<00:02:19.780> so<00:02:20.780> my<00:02:21.440> left<00:02:22.129> hand<00:02:22.430> side<00:02:22.760> collar<00:02:23.180> has<00:02:23.569> the

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:24.230 
this so my left hand side collar has the

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.520 
this so my left hand side collar has the
metal<00:02:24.640> collar<00:02:25.640> state<00:02:25.970> plus<00:02:26.510> a<00:02:26.750> magnet

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
metal collar state plus a magnet

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:29.830 
metal collar state plus a magnet
attached<00:02:28.220> to<00:02:28.519> it<00:02:28.610> and<00:02:28.730> that<00:02:29.150> brings<00:02:29.540> it<00:02:29.720> in

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
attached to it and that brings it in

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.199 
attached to it and that brings it in
very<00:02:30.080> close<00:02:30.500> and<00:02:30.769> neat<00:02:30.950> whereas<00:02:31.670> my

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
very close and neat whereas my

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.080 
very close and neat whereas my
right-hand<00:02:32.569> side<00:02:32.930> call<00:02:33.379> it<00:02:33.500> just<00:02:33.769> has<00:02:34.010> a<00:02:34.250> metal

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:35.090 
right-hand side call it just has a metal

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.289 
right-hand side call it just has a metal
collar<00:02:35.780> stay<00:02:36.080> in<00:02:36.290> it<00:02:36.410> but<00:02:36.590> no<00:02:36.830> no<00:02:37.370> magnet<00:02:37.970> so

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:38.299 
collar stay in it but no no magnet so

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:40.809 
collar stay in it but no no magnet so
what<00:02:38.900> you<00:02:39.049> do<00:02:39.230> is<00:02:39.410> just<00:02:39.440> put<00:02:39.860> in<00:02:40.010> that<00:02:40.190> metal

00:02:40.809 --> 00:02:40.819 
what you do is just put in that metal

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.319 
what you do is just put in that metal
collar<00:02:41.450> state<00:02:41.780> and<00:02:42.049> then<00:02:42.590> on<00:02:42.799> the<00:02:42.950> inside<00:02:43.329> edge

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:44.329 
collar state and then on the inside edge

00:02:44.329 --> 00:02:47.229 
collar state and then on the inside edge
of<00:02:44.989> your<00:02:45.200> shirt<00:02:45.470> you<00:02:46.310> actually<00:02:46.790> then<00:02:47.000> just

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
of your shirt you actually then just

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:50.949 
of your shirt you actually then just
attach<00:02:47.690> the<00:02:48.579> magnet<00:02:49.579> and<00:02:49.760> it'll<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.209> stop

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
attach the magnet and it'll just stop

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:52.360 
attach the magnet and it'll just stop
for<00:02:51.290> you<00:02:51.410> basically<00:02:51.620> it<00:02:51.799> will<00:02:51.859> just<00:02:52.040> pick<00:02:52.250> up

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
for you basically it will just pick up

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.420 
for you basically it will just pick up
that<00:02:52.720> metal<00:02:53.720> collar<00:02:53.959> stay<00:02:54.200> inside<00:02:54.620> and<00:02:54.980> then

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
that metal collar stay inside and then

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:58.390 
that metal collar stay inside and then
now<00:02:55.700> can<00:02:56.150> you<00:02:56.239> see<00:02:56.510> that<00:02:56.750> both<00:02:57.290> sides<00:02:58.010> of<00:02:58.250> my

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
now can you see that both sides of my

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.729 
now can you see that both sides of my
neck<00:02:58.700> are<00:02:58.910> very<00:02:59.420> neat<00:02:59.780> and<00:02:59.810> tidy<00:03:00.079> and<00:03:00.560> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
neck are very neat and tidy and the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.099 
neck are very neat and tidy and the
colors<00:03:01.160> come<00:03:01.730> in<00:03:01.760> nice<00:03:02.120> and<00:03:02.390> close<00:03:02.450> which<00:03:02.959> has

00:03:03.099 --> 00:03:03.109 
colors come in nice and close which has

00:03:03.109 --> 00:03:05.949 
colors come in nice and close which has
been<00:03:03.260> brought<00:03:03.560> in<00:03:03.890> by<00:03:04.209> attaching<00:03:05.209> that<00:03:05.329> magnet

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
been brought in by attaching that magnet

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:09.069 
been brought in by attaching that magnet
color<00:03:06.290> to<00:03:06.859> the<00:03:07.040> the<00:03:07.340> metal<00:03:07.670> collar<00:03:07.910> state<00:03:08.269> so

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:09.079 
color to the the metal collar state so

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:10.900 
color to the the metal collar state so
I'll<00:03:09.319> just<00:03:09.500> take<00:03:09.739> it<00:03:09.920> off<00:03:10.010> again<00:03:10.160> for<00:03:10.579> you<00:03:10.700> so

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.050 
I'll just take it off again for you so
you<00:03:11.000> can<00:03:11.180> see<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.540> difference<00:03:12.069> okay<00:03:13.069> so<00:03:13.129> this

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:14.060 
you can see the difference okay so this

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.750 
you can see the difference okay so this
side<00:03:14.420> has<00:03:14.720> a<00:03:14.750> metal<00:03:15.620> collar<00:03:15.980> state<00:03:16.370> with<00:03:16.730> a

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
side has a metal collar state with a

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.699 
side has a metal collar state with a
small<00:03:17.359> little<00:03:17.630> magnet<00:03:18.049> attached<00:03:18.380> on<00:03:18.620> the

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:18.709 
small little magnet attached on the

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.449 
small little magnet attached on the
inside<00:03:19.400> and<00:03:19.760> then<00:03:20.359> this<00:03:20.840> side<00:03:21.230> has<00:03:21.620> just<00:03:21.889> a

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
inside and then this side has just a

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.270 
inside and then this side has just a
metal<00:03:23.030> collar<00:03:23.269> and<00:03:23.569> no<00:03:23.840> magnet<00:03:24.410> and<00:03:24.590> then<00:03:25.010> I'll

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
metal collar and no magnet and then I'll

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.759 
metal collar and no magnet and then I'll
take<00:03:25.609> out<00:03:25.819> the<00:03:26.450> collar<00:03:27.109> stay<00:03:27.440> all<00:03:27.620> together

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
take out the collar stay all together

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:31.860 
take out the collar stay all together
and<00:03:28.310> then<00:03:29.299> now<00:03:30.169> it<00:03:30.590> completely<00:03:31.370> droops<00:03:31.730> down

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:31.870 
and then now it completely droops down

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:35.349 
and then now it completely droops down
so<00:03:32.870> that's<00:03:33.470> the<00:03:33.889> three<00:03:34.430> variants<00:03:35.180> or

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
so that's the three variants or

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.140 
so that's the three variants or
graduations<00:03:36.260> of<00:03:36.470> looking<00:03:37.400> after<00:03:37.760> your<00:03:37.880> collar

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
graduations of looking after your collar

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.990 
graduations of looking after your collar
and<00:03:38.389> making<00:03:38.750> it<00:03:38.840> neater<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.440> as<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.519> say<00:03:40.790> I

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:41.000 
and making it neater and as I say I

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:42.759 
and making it neater and as I say I
think<00:03:41.060> your<00:03:41.540> best<00:03:41.720> option<00:03:42.169> is<00:03:42.260> to<00:03:42.410> go<00:03:42.560> with<00:03:42.709> the

00:03:42.759 --> 00:03:42.769 
think your best option is to go with the

00:03:42.769 --> 00:03:45.039 
think your best option is to go with the
magnetic<00:03:43.459> collar<00:03:43.790> stay<00:03:44.090> so<00:03:44.389> there's<00:03:44.840> the

00:03:45.039 --> 00:03:45.049 
magnetic collar stay so there's the

00:03:45.049 --> 00:03:47.289 
magnetic collar stay so there's the
collar<00:03:45.290> stay<00:03:45.590> there's<00:03:46.370> a<00:03:46.459> little<00:03:46.760> magnet<00:03:47.180> that

00:03:47.289 --> 00:03:47.299 
collar stay there's a little magnet that

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.039 
collar stay there's a little magnet that
attaches<00:03:47.840> to<00:03:48.049> it<00:03:48.349> and<00:03:48.639> detaches<00:03:49.639> I<00:03:50.450> guess<00:03:50.840> it's

00:03:51.039 --> 00:03:51.049 
attaches to it and detaches I guess it's

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:53.289 
attaches to it and detaches I guess it's
just<00:03:51.200> personal<00:03:51.410> preference<00:03:52.130> I<00:03:52.370> like<00:03:53.030> to<00:03:53.180> have

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
just personal preference I like to have

just personal preference I like to have
the<00:03:53.450> collar<00:03:53.690> and<00:03:53.870> nice<00:03:54.109> and<00:03:54.349> neat<00:03:54.530> like<00:03:54.799> that

00:03:55.059 --> 00:03:55.069
