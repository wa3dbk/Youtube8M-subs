00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.520
 goals 

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:11.940
 the miracle match of the class of 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:13.920
 wood of having lost of history 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.780
 of the cougars does not allow 90 minute 

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.430
 a footballer of contention 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.430
 come back the ball came back 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.580
 First 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.700
 is so that there should be a 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.700
 president with sizes 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.140
 the president was not very worried 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.120
 right now because it's been named 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.489
 but what happened with light garcia the 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 president of the website pan presiente is 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.850
 worried about selling to shell 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.649
 Texaco the gas stations are no longer 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:01.800
 worried orphans form to nahuel 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:01:02.920
 pachuca does not take it off that 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.299
 good 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.299
 and not what I now return placing in the 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.299
 wall 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:16.750
 outsiders out of context of what 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.940
 has been the story 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.330
 you do not see it and you say experience they 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.330
 team 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:34.320
 will continue to weigh the nonsense of Garcia 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:37.650
 I'm serious but it has to do with 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.650
 against that 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.280
 garcía luis garcía charged 120 thousand 

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.410
 dollars in the university monthly to 

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.460
 who removes that from cougars today if not 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.960
 make the team you have to follow 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.530
 paying august leandro they brought him 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.530
 so that I want it 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.119
 that puts him on a diet but not the 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.459
 physically reach workers now 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:14.140
 it's just logical that it's not going to 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:16.750
 reach 

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.790
 the truth is incredible that you bring 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.650
 leandro and bring health owner if they are like 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:27.620
 75 years together 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:29.599
 they are 68 they have 34 and 35 69 years they brought to 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.129
 Diego Lagos made only one goal in a year 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.390
 football the central rosary that 

00:02:31.129 --> 00:02:39.270
 he has 18 in his career 

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:44.090
 in the mine he did 45 

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:44.090
 [Laughs] 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:54.859
 of a cup 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.420
 I do not think he sticks with pumas me anymore 

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:58.930
 I do not think it's going to be worse than the year 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.930
 past 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:11.739
 the team of rafa should have 4 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.959
 with that with these errors but it is not 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:25.069
 defend the whole party 

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:26.000
 Christian for back we are 

00:03:25.069 --> 00:03:32.350
 different 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:32.350
 in the normal match 20 to 85 

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:58.880
 and america 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:04:00.830
 we are long with the ball without 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.739
 to be wonderful was better than the rival 

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.100
 with the ball when he tried it and half 

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:05.570
 gas 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:09.470
 he was winning the town in the first 

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:11.959
 time was missing five minutes ago a 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.580
 equipment you can afford this is the 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.020
 midfield and the place is on top of the 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.370
 enemy goal this one is flipped to see 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:25.360
 to the pikolin the return as the redemption 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:28.360
 David Cabrera and that's called winning 2 

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:28.360
 060 

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:41.380
 maybe in 20 minutes 

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:41.380
 if you are telling me 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:55.400
 when the goal of alústiza falls you do not 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.500
 there is the feeling that even when 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.090
 it took two minutes to convince them 

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.260
 they can tie because they had 33 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.150
 more to the players of that take where the 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:08.380
 half half that all the 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:08.380
 players all 

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:26.560
 they are terribly wrong and 

00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.560
 will determine how long without playing 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.290
 and take it out of the field 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:54.610
 to defend
