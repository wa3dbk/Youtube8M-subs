when he was breathing nice to meet you
actually<00:00:38.860> we<00:00:39.100> did<00:00:39.309> meet<00:00:39.520> about<00:00:40.000> two<00:00:40.180> years<00:00:40.210> ago

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
actually we did meet about two years ago

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.569 
actually we did meet about two years ago
you<00:00:40.720> came<00:00:40.989> to<00:00:41.050> New<00:00:41.290> York<00:00:41.559> to<00:00:41.770> the<00:00:42.010> green<00:00:42.340> thumb

00:00:42.569 --> 00:00:42.579 
you came to New York to the green thumb

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.460 
you came to New York to the green thumb
grow<00:00:42.730> together<00:00:42.910> wide<00:00:43.390> and<00:00:43.900> I<00:00:44.050> told<00:00:44.260> you<00:00:44.410> that

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:44.470 
grow together wide and I told you that

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.840 
grow together wide and I told you that
you<00:00:44.680> had<00:00:44.710> to<00:00:44.949> do<00:00:45.040> a<00:00:45.070> piece<00:00:45.309> of<00:00:45.370> that<00:00:45.550> rainwater

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:45.850 
you had to do a piece of that rainwater

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.189 
you had to do a piece of that rainwater
harvesting<00:00:46.239> and<00:00:46.809> you're<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.809> tell<00:00:50.019> them

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
harvesting and you're here so tell them

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.930 
harvesting and you're here so tell them
about<00:00:50.320> your<00:00:50.589> sister<00:00:50.949> Linney<00:00:51.190> we<00:00:51.610> helped<00:00:51.820> the

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:51.940 
about your sister Linney we helped the

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.600 
about your sister Linney we helped the
gardens<00:00:52.300> to<00:00:52.600> conserve<00:00:53.379> water<00:00:53.650> and<00:00:53.890> a<00:00:54.309> great

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:54.610 
gardens to conserve water and a great

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.939 
gardens to conserve water and a great
way<00:00:54.640> to<00:00:54.820> do<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:55.650> collect<00:00:56.650> rainwater

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
way to do that is to collect rainwater

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.549 
way to do that is to collect rainwater
so<00:00:57.460> we've<00:00:57.640> attached<00:00:58.150> piping<00:00:58.839> to<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.379> roof

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
so we've attached piping to the roof

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.590 
so we've attached piping to the roof
that's<00:00:59.920> right<00:01:00.129> behind<00:01:00.460> us<00:01:00.640> here<00:01:00.850> right<00:01:01.420> and

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:01.600 
that's right behind us here right and

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.750 
that's right behind us here right and
those<00:01:01.870> pipes<00:01:02.199> funnel<00:01:02.650> the<00:01:02.739> water<00:01:02.920> into<00:01:03.400> four

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
those pipes funnel the water into four

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.609 
those pipes funnel the water into four
barrels<00:01:04.360> right<00:01:04.930> down<00:01:05.140> here<00:01:05.350> that<00:01:05.530> are

00:01:05.609 --> 00:01:05.619 
barrels right down here that are

00:01:05.619 --> 00:01:07.320 
barrels right down here that are
connected<00:01:06.100> together<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.700> see<00:01:06.940> how<00:01:07.090> you<00:01:07.150> have

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.330 
connected together I see how you have

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
connected together I see how you have
them<00:01:07.450> talk<00:01:07.659> to<00:01:07.840> you<00:01:07.900> have<00:01:08.020> each<00:01:08.140> of<00:01:08.290> the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
them talk to you have each of the

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.230 
them talk to you have each of the
barrels<00:01:08.680> kind<00:01:08.920> of<00:01:09.010> tucked<00:01:09.310> towards<00:01:09.939> the<00:01:10.060> back

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:10.240 
barrels kind of tucked towards the back

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.060 
barrels kind of tucked towards the back
of<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.510> fence<00:01:10.750> here<00:01:11.020> we<00:01:11.350> came<00:01:11.560> up<00:01:11.619> with<00:01:11.920> this

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:12.070 
of the fence here we came up with this

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:14.450 
of the fence here we came up with this
this<00:01:12.610> plan<00:01:12.909> here<00:01:13.150> to<00:01:13.270> use<00:01:13.420> these<00:01:13.600> for<00:01:13.930> smaller

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
this plan here to use these for smaller

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.820 
this plan here to use these for smaller
recycled<00:01:15.659> olive<00:01:16.659> barrels<00:01:17.049> so<00:01:17.680> your

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
recycled olive barrels so your

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:19.950 
recycled olive barrels so your
repurposed<00:01:18.400> into<00:01:18.520> we're<00:01:19.060> repurposing<00:01:19.659> is<00:01:19.810> all

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:19.960 
repurposed into we're repurposing is all

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.080 
repurposed into we're repurposing is all
right<00:01:20.140> and<00:01:20.380> then<00:01:20.770> right<00:01:21.070> over<00:01:21.369> here<00:01:21.820> is<00:01:21.970> the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:22.090 
right and then right over here is the

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:23.910 
right and then right over here is the
spigot<00:01:22.540> they<00:01:22.780> can<00:01:22.960> drain<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.259> right<00:01:23.500> them<00:01:23.680> over

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
spigot they can drain it right them over

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:25.530 
spigot they can drain it right them over
there<00:01:24.040> what<00:01:24.250> was<00:01:24.369> cool<00:01:24.520> about<00:01:24.580> your<00:01:24.970> system<00:01:25.390> is

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
there what was cool about your system is

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.420 
there what was cool about your system is
you<00:01:25.720> using<00:01:26.200> gravity<00:01:26.799> so<00:01:26.979> that<00:01:27.130> there<00:01:27.310> is<00:01:27.400> no

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
you using gravity so that there is no

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.880 
you using gravity so that there is no
power<00:01:27.939> no<00:01:28.750> electricity<00:01:29.110> had<00:01:29.380> me<00:01:29.530> you<00:01:29.680> try<00:01:29.830> to

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
power no electricity had me you try to

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:31.499 
power no electricity had me you try to
bring<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.280> like<00:01:30.400> a<00:01:30.460> generator<00:01:30.970> or<00:01:31.060> anything

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
bring in like a generator or anything

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:34.109 
bring in like a generator or anything
really<00:01:32.140> all<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.470> do<00:01:32.650> is<00:01:32.830> that<00:01:33.009> gravity<00:01:33.549> supply

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
really all you do is that gravity supply

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:35.880 
really all you do is that gravity supply
the<00:01:34.539> force<00:01:34.840> to<00:01:35.289> get<00:01:35.409> the<00:01:35.499> water<00:01:35.619> out<00:01:35.740> the

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:35.890 
the force to get the water out the

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.279 
the force to get the water out the
spigot<00:01:36.189> we<00:01:36.429> try<00:01:36.700> to<00:01:36.759> do<00:01:37.090> like<00:01:37.329> no<00:01:37.840> moving<00:01:38.140> parts

00:01:38.279 --> 00:01:38.289 
spigot we try to do like no moving parts

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.590 
spigot we try to do like no moving parts
the<00:01:38.710> only<00:01:38.979> moving<00:01:39.189> part<00:01:39.549> is<00:01:39.789> the<00:01:39.969> spigot<00:01:40.359> that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
the only moving part is the spigot that

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:42.599 
the only moving part is the spigot that
valve<00:01:41.020> it<00:01:41.229> and<00:01:41.469> you<00:01:41.619> can<00:01:41.829> bet<00:01:42.070> so<00:01:42.310> that<00:01:42.429> that's

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:42.609 
valve it and you can bet so that that's

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:44.069 
valve it and you can bet so that that's
just<00:01:42.820> that's<00:01:42.969> a<00:01:43.119> half<00:01:43.359> hours<00:01:43.780> there's<00:01:44.020> a

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
just that's a half hours there's a

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:45.569 
just that's a half hours there's a
little<00:01:44.259> bit<00:01:44.469> of<00:01:44.530> maintenance<00:01:44.770> that<00:01:45.219> has<00:01:45.399> to<00:01:45.549> be

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
little bit of maintenance that has to be

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:47.789 
little bit of maintenance that has to be
done<00:01:45.850> you've<00:01:46.060> gotta<00:01:46.299> turn<00:01:46.659> the<00:01:46.929> system<00:01:47.140> on<00:01:47.530> in

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:47.799 
done you've gotta turn the system on in

00:01:47.799 --> 00:01:49.529 
done you've gotta turn the system on in
the<00:01:47.920> spring<00:01:48.369> and<00:01:48.609> turn<00:01:48.789> it<00:01:48.939> off<00:01:49.060> in<00:01:49.240> the<00:01:49.299> fall

00:01:49.529 --> 00:01:49.539 
the spring and turn it off in the fall

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:52.289

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
think this is also cool i was looking

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.590 
think this is also cool i was looking
over<00:03:05.160> it<00:03:05.460> how<00:03:05.790> people<00:03:06.120> were<00:03:06.210> putting<00:03:06.420> together

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
over it how people were putting together

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.660 
over it how people were putting together
they<00:03:07.290> got<00:03:07.470> their<00:03:07.680> trellises<00:03:08.250> to<00:03:08.400> give<00:03:08.550> them<00:03:08.640> a

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
they got their trellises to give them a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.010 
they got their trellises to give them a
little<00:03:08.790> vertical<00:03:09.210> space<00:03:09.540> because<00:03:09.780> if<00:03:09.930> you

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
little vertical space because if you

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:12.440 
little vertical space because if you
don't<00:03:10.230> have<00:03:10.470> a<00:03:10.740> lot<00:03:10.860> of<00:03:11.130> ground<00:03:11.460> space<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:12.300> got

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
don't have a lot of ground space you got

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.090 
don't have a lot of ground space you got
to<00:03:12.540> figure<00:03:12.750> another<00:03:12.930> strategy<00:03:13.350> and<00:03:13.800> so<00:03:13.920> looks

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
to figure another strategy and so looks

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.090 
to figure another strategy and so looks
like<00:03:14.190> they<00:03:14.520> have<00:03:14.550> built<00:03:15.420> in<00:03:15.660> some<00:03:16.500> trellises

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.100 
like they have built in some trellises

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.430 
like they have built in some trellises
and<00:03:17.130> put<00:03:17.700> in<00:03:17.820> some<00:03:18.060> cages<00:03:18.570> so<00:03:19.050> they<00:03:19.170> can<00:03:19.320> get

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
and put in some cages so they can get

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.960 
and put in some cages so they can get
some<00:03:19.620> of<00:03:19.770> their<00:03:19.920> squash<00:03:20.250> and<00:03:20.550> things<00:03:20.730> growing

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
some of their squash and things growing

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.170 
some of their squash and things growing
up<00:03:21.209> yes<00:03:21.720> and<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.620> people<00:03:23.220> will<00:03:23.580> use<00:03:23.760> anything

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
up yes and and people will use anything

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.240 
up yes and and people will use anything
as<00:03:24.540> a<00:03:24.570> planter<00:03:25.140> as<00:03:25.260> you<00:03:25.410> as<00:03:25.620> you<00:03:25.650> can<00:03:26.010> see

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
as a planter as you as you can see

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.430 
as a planter as you as you can see
they're<00:03:26.459> using<00:03:26.940> old<00:03:27.360> milk<00:03:27.780> containers<00:03:28.290> and

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
they're using old milk containers and

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:30.440 
they're using old milk containers and
juice<00:03:28.620> containers<00:03:29.250> its<00:03:29.459> container<00:03:29.820> here<00:03:30.030> yeah

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
juice containers its container here yeah

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.680 
juice containers its container here yeah
well<00:03:31.200> I<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:31.440> this<00:03:31.920> is<00:03:32.160> this<00:03:32.820> is<00:03:33.090> the<00:03:33.270> epitome

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:33.690 
well I think this is this is the epitome

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.470 
well I think this is this is the epitome
of<00:03:33.980> sustainability<00:03:34.980> to<00:03:35.730> do<00:03:35.940> something<00:03:36.360> like

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
of sustainability to do something like

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.870 
of sustainability to do something like
this<00:03:36.720> where<00:03:37.020> you<00:03:37.170> will<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.590> reuse<00:03:38.130> a<00:03:38.160> product

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
this where you will you reuse a product
