00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.800
 the Ã©rika I have here a wine pencil that 

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:16.529
 just broke the tip and a pocketknife 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:19.770
 I use the penknife I have here in 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.890
 table but you can use a stylus to 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.470
 Secret here is very quiet, you go. 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.770
 point out in a way that points to 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.919
 well no, not little, not like that 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:41.269
 has to aim is too small 

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:41.269
 make several several cuts and yes but only 

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.520
 be careful with your fingers 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.630
 begins to spend the wood here in this 

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:02.630
 Part goes near the tip 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:23.980
 Look, I'm just cutting here and then. 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:27.180
 last I'm cutting here next graffiti 

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.180
 just not to break 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:44.180
 I leave graffiti looks well one see that 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:47.390
 she points out it was well in squares here 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:51.680
 I do not aim now with the stylus 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:54.290
 I pass it on a paper or 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:57.770
 then a sandpaper to be able to do contained 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 fine as good cool break for now 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.820
 This is what I hope has helped 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:03.440
 pencil pointing tip 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.330

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.330
