00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:38.450 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.200 

do<00:00:39.450> it<00:00:39.540> being<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.780> bit<00:00:39.930> hotter<00:00:40.700> in<00:00:41.700> actual<00:00:42.030> fact

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:49.489 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:01:00.990 

I'm<00:00:50.489> getting<00:00:50.730> laughed<00:00:50.879> at<00:00:51.120> by<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.329> locals

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.000 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.060

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
I've never seen this before I think this

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:06.420 
I've never seen this before I think this
might<00:01:03.250> be<00:01:03.280> specific<00:01:03.730> to<00:01:04.320> the<00:01:05.320> temple<00:01:05.770> fair<00:01:05.980> but

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
might be specific to the temple fair but

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.940 
might be specific to the temple fair but
it's<00:01:06.640> basically<00:01:06.910> powdered<00:01:07.420> tea<00:01:07.630> and<00:01:07.990> what

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:08.950 
it's basically powdered tea and what

it's basically powdered tea and what
they<00:01:09.040> do<00:01:09.100> is<00:01:09.280> they<00:01:09.400> put<00:01:09.580> the<00:01:09.670> tea<00:01:09.880> in<00:01:10.210> the

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:10.510 
they do is they put the tea in the

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:12.690 
they do is they put the tea in the
dragon<00:01:11.140> pot<00:01:11.410> which<00:01:12.070> is<00:01:12.100> full<00:01:12.340> of<00:01:12.370> boiling

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:12.700

00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:02.330 
secret recipe so let's let's give it a
try<00:02:52.290> you<00:02:55.380> got<00:02:56.380> it

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.620 

so<00:03:03.340> he<00:03:03.459> tried<00:03:03.670> to<00:03:03.700> give<00:03:03.880> me<00:03:03.970> an<00:03:04.060> ostrich<00:03:04.420> burger

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:04.630 
so he tried to give me an ostrich burger

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:06.240 
so he tried to give me an ostrich burger
where<00:03:04.870> are<00:03:05.019> we<00:03:05.110> going<00:03:05.350> for<00:03:05.500> a<00:03:05.560> land<00:03:05.769> to<00:03:06.160> us

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
where are we going for a land to us

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:07.890 
where are we going for a land to us
that's<00:03:06.640> the<00:03:06.760> traditional<00:03:07.269> one<00:03:07.420> so<00:03:07.570> let's<00:03:07.720> see

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
that's the traditional one so let's see

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.810 
that's the traditional one so let's see
these<00:03:08.110> are<00:03:08.170> these<00:03:08.560> are<00:03:08.739> three<00:03:09.370> times<00:03:09.640> the

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:09.820 
these are these are three times the

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.600 
these are these are three times the
price<00:03:09.940> of<00:03:10.209> a<00:03:10.239> regular<00:03:10.269> lamb<00:03:11.200> kebab<00:03:11.590> down<00:03:12.400> in

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
price of a regular lamb kebab down in

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:20.570 
price of a regular lamb kebab down in
town<00:03:12.820> so<00:03:13.150> let's<00:03:13.180> see<00:03:13.480> if<00:03:13.540> they're<00:03:13.690> any<00:03:13.750> better

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:20.580 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:24.920 

it's<00:03:21.150> a<00:03:21.210> bit<00:03:21.360> tough<00:03:22.190> could<00:03:23.190> be<00:03:23.280> nicer<00:03:23.870> but<00:03:24.870> the

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:24.930 
it's a bit tough could be nicer but the

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.170 
it's a bit tough could be nicer but the
flavors<00:03:25.290> there<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.590> flavors<00:03:25.920> good<00:03:26.130> friend<00:03:27.090> of

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:27.180 
flavors there the flavors good friend of

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.150 
flavors there the flavors good friend of
the<00:03:27.270> lamb<00:03:27.450> is<00:03:27.660> from<00:03:27.900> Inner<00:03:28.470> Mongolia<00:03:28.560> so<00:03:29.130> I

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:29.160 
the lamb is from Inner Mongolia so I

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:32.050 
the lamb is from Inner Mongolia so I
don't<00:03:29.340> know<00:03:29.430> if<00:03:29.490> that<00:03:29.580> makes<00:03:29.700> a<00:03:29.850> difference

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:32.060 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:39.190 

let's<00:03:33.060> try<00:03:33.240> a<00:03:33.270> bit<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.450> the

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:42.940 

that's<00:03:40.200> good<00:03:40.440> that's<00:03:41.069> much<00:03:41.310> better<00:03:41.550> than<00:03:41.819> me

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:42.950 
that's good that's much better than me

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.180 
that's good that's much better than me
look<00:03:43.950> wise<00:03:44.160> healthy<00:03:44.550> obviously<00:03:44.880> but<00:03:45.030> much
