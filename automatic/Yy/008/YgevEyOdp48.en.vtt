00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:11.730
 I like dance because when I dance 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.990
 I feel free it's as if I had 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.840
 a little song inside me 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.689
 the song is the music and the 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.400
 music is dance and I love 

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:21.930
 dance 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:22.380
 I like dance because she was able to 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:25.170
 release 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.750
 I could express my deep being 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.320
 sensitivity my energy just power 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.119
 breathe 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.119
 so yes I like the job of dancing 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:38.239
 dancing is a mental commitment and 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.239
 physical 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:46.200
 as for the dances you find them the 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:49.379
 pleasure there are all the emotions that 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:55.020
 take out your heart 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:01:00.600
 lived all your passion is everything all 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:03.629
 things that linger from in if I think about 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.990
 my life every morning when I get up 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:09.320
 and I make you my eyes but there is a 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:09.320
 worry 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.119
 I like dance because it helps 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.890
 to go beyond psychological limits 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:19.470
 sentimental or even physical for them 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.659
 to give to the viewer but before 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.000
 all that I like dance because despite 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.369
 cultural geographical barriers 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.400
 or even language we come to 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.620
 understand in the same movement 

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.200
 I like dance 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:35.660
 I like dance because it gives me 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.310
 a lot of joy a lot of happiness on 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.520
 scene I can express my emotions 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.190
 my anger my sadness I would like in 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.240
 do my job because it's beautiful dancing 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.560
 and I would like to be a star dancer 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.140
 I like dance because that's 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.940
 how I expressed my emotions too 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.840
 in the future I want to do the dance 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.680
 professional 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:02:01.700
 when my job I like dance is 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:02.330
 Too cool I love dancing I have 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:07.119
 do my job 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:09.230
 in fact I started late the dance 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.410
 before I did a lot of music 

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:13.000
 but I was self-taught but I had 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.430
 not the solfÃ¨ge 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:20.930
 I did a lot of sport but 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:22.460
 I was not a high level athlete and 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.490
 I did the fine arts that I like 

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.820
 a lot but in the drawing I had not 

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:31.850
 of pencil stroke at 20 years after the 

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:34.790
 various services I took a course of 

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:36.320
 dance and there suddenly I got 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.800
 realized that these three elements 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:43.220
 I find them in advance 

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:44.840
 now so after that of course I 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:46.790
 did the training I did a beautiful 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.190
 career here and now 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:53.860
 at 64 I can say 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:58.030
 that I chose a good thousand dance 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.280
 it's great I like dance but matter 

00:02:58.030 --> 00:03:03.070
 because it will allow me to do 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.670
 in the moment to connect with 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:10.990
 my emotions the emotions that are 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:14.740
 women too strong your delicate four 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:16.780
 others have to express otherwise as soon 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.360
 that I go back to the studio to dance 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:23.350
 to work I close my life 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.270
 outdoor everyone outside with 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:29.280
 the dance I find myself in a language 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.280
 universal like nothing else 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:32.820
 dance is my life
