 listening to your album I thought 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.360
 that maybe it was the album of the 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.360
 maturity 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.660
 I grew up it was not my 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.720
 goal 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.900
 without I had the other goal to do 

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:06.240
 moccio and I feel a little mature people 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.670
 because I was forced because I 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.770
 am to lose now that has changed 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.950
 many things to become daddy of 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:16.920
 this two-year-old girl in mans 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.690
 it touches everything changed my life it's 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.610
 the whole universe of differences 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:24.420
 the entire planet and the universe 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:29.760
 li na was said personally I 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:33.840
 stopped smoking cigarette I sleep a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.490
 way of affirming I slept is preparing the 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:41.390
