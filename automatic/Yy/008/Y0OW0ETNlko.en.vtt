00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
they're asleep usually the doors are

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.899 
they're asleep usually the doors are
locked<00:01:57.020> so<00:01:58.020> I'm<00:01:58.170> gonna<00:01:58.350> have<00:01:58.560> to<00:01:58.799> pick<00:01:59.700> those

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
locked so I'm gonna have to pick those

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.300 
locked so I'm gonna have to pick those
locks<00:02:00.210> and<00:02:00.570> get<00:02:00.719> inside<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.439> see<00:02:02.070> what<00:02:02.219> they

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.940 
locks and get inside and see what they
have<00:02:02.430> in<00:02:02.460> their<00:02:02.700> buckets<00:02:03.320> seems<00:02:04.320> like<00:02:04.469> a<00:02:04.500> fun

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
have in their buckets seems like a fun

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.130 
have in their buckets seems like a fun
idea<00:02:05.130> to<00:02:05.340> me<00:02:05.549> then<00:02:06.090> you<00:02:06.210> have<00:02:06.299> novice<00:02:06.630> locks<00:02:06.869> I

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
idea to me then you have novice locks I

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.279 
idea to me then you have novice locks I
put<00:02:08.129> one<00:02:08.310> actual<00:02:08.910> point<00:02:09.209> inside<00:02:09.660> of<00:02:09.810> here<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
put one actual point inside of here so

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.650 
put one actual point inside of here so
now<00:02:10.739> this<00:02:10.890> locks<00:02:11.099> are<00:02:11.280> much<00:02:11.400> easier<00:02:11.430> to<00:02:11.790> pick

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:44.730 
honestly even the act of shooting

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:46.760 
honestly even the act of shooting
somebody<00:03:45.330> with<00:03:45.780> his<00:03:45.959> bow<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:46.110> arrow<00:03:46.380> would<00:03:46.650> be

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:46.770 
somebody with his bow and arrow would be

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.250 
somebody with his bow and arrow would be
kind<00:03:47.070> of<00:03:47.130> traumatizing<00:03:47.670> and<00:03:48.239> I<00:03:48.510> don't<00:03:49.080> think

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
kind of traumatizing and I don't think

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.290 
kind of traumatizing and I don't think
it<00:03:49.470> would<00:03:49.560> actually<00:03:49.590> happen<00:03:49.890> not<00:03:50.520> without

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
it would actually happen not without

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:55.699 
it would actually happen not without
some<00:03:51.780> severe<00:03:52.880> provocation<00:03:53.880> and<00:03:54.510> I<00:03:55.410> just<00:03:55.530> don't

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
some severe provocation and I just don't

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.170 
some severe provocation and I just don't
see<00:03:55.890> it<00:03:55.920> happening<00:03:56.010> I<00:03:56.520> just<00:03:56.730> don't<00:03:56.910> see<00:03:57.060> that

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
see it happening I just don't see that

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:00.290 
see it happening I just don't see that
happening<00:03:58.580> but<00:03:59.580> anyway<00:03:59.820> moving<00:04:00.090> on

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
happening but anyway moving on

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.390 
happening but anyway moving on
restoration<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:01.170> also<00:04:01.320> put<00:04:01.590> one<00:04:01.800> point<00:04:02.070> inside

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
restoration I also put one point inside

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.030 
restoration I also put one point inside
of<00:04:02.550> restoration<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:04.440> I'm<00:04:04.830> thinking

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:05.040 
of restoration and I'm thinking

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.620 
of restoration and I'm thinking
restoration<00:04:05.730> is<00:04:05.850> about<00:04:06.000> the<00:04:06.150> only<00:04:06.180> skill<00:04:06.570> that

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:06.630 
restoration is about the only skill that

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.570 
restoration is about the only skill that
i<00:04:06.810> can<00:04:06.989> use<00:04:07.020> as<00:04:07.440> a<00:04:07.470> child<00:04:07.739> you<00:04:08.070> know<00:04:08.220> if<00:04:08.310> I<00:04:08.400> get

00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:08.580 
i can use as a child you know if I get

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:10.970 
i can use as a child you know if I get
really<00:04:08.790> badly<00:04:09.060> hurt<00:04:09.620> it's<00:04:10.620> almost<00:04:10.800> like

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:10.980 
really badly hurt it's almost like

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.890 
really badly hurt it's almost like
bandaging<00:04:11.580> myself<00:04:12.030> and<00:04:13.489> there's<00:04:14.489> also

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:14.900 
bandaging myself and there's also

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.599 
bandaging myself and there's also
illusion<00:04:15.900> which<00:04:16.680> again<00:04:16.980> I<00:04:17.040> don't<00:04:17.340> think<00:04:17.520> I'm

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
illusion which again I don't think I'm

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.190 
illusion which again I don't think I'm
going<00:04:17.700> to<00:04:17.760> be<00:04:17.820> using<00:04:17.970> any<00:04:18.359> of<00:04:18.480> those<00:04:18.630> spells<00:04:18.959> at
