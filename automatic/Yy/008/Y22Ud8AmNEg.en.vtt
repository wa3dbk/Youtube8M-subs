people can get into the game and I think

people do take csgo seriously as I've
said<00:03:08.480> earlier<00:03:08.840> it<00:03:09.050> is<00:03:09.080> one<00:03:09.380> of<00:03:09.410> the<00:03:09.530> most

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:09.650 
said earlier it is one of the most

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.800 
said earlier it is one of the most
competitive<00:03:10.040> first-person<00:03:10.850> shooters<00:03:11.180> of<00:03:11.300> all

competitive first-person shooters of all

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:13.630 
competitive first-person shooters of all
time<00:03:12.140> so<00:03:12.650> a<00:03:12.680> lot<00:03:12.860> of<00:03:12.890> people<00:03:13.130> want<00:03:13.310> to<00:03:13.370> take<00:03:13.520> it

time so a lot of people want to take it
more<00:03:13.850> seriously<00:03:14.330> but<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:14.990> want<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.290> to

on<00:03:19.430> tivo<00:03:19.820> just<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.390> get<00:03:20.510> the<00:03:20.600> experience<00:03:20.930> that

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
on tivo just to get the experience that

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:22.840 
on tivo just to get the experience that
they<00:03:21.380> should<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.710> getting<00:03:22.010> from<00:03:22.370> the<00:03:22.700> base

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
they should be getting from the base

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:24.490 
they should be getting from the base
game<00:03:22.880> itself<00:03:23.480> I<00:03:23.720> think<00:03:23.960> this<00:03:24.050> is<00:03:24.200> a<00:03:24.230> win-win

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
game itself I think this is a win-win

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.350 
game itself I think this is a win-win
for<00:03:24.650> everyone<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:25.550> make<00:03:25.730> valve<00:03:26.030> more

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:26.360 
for everyone it would make valve more

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.000 
for everyone it would make valve more
money<00:03:26.630> and<00:03:26.900> it<00:03:27.020> would<00:03:27.110> make<00:03:27.260> everyone<00:03:27.590> a<00:03:27.740> lot

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
money and it would make everyone a lot

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:29.890 
money and it would make everyone a lot
more<00:03:28.190> happy<00:03:28.550> to<00:03:28.700> know<00:03:28.850> that<00:03:28.880> a<00:03:29.090> valve<00:03:29.450> funded

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
more happy to know that a valve funded

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.900 
more happy to know that a valve funded
game<00:03:30.110> actually<00:03:30.410> has<00:03:30.620> these<00:03:31.040> changes<00:03:31.520> that

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
game actually has these changes that

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.670 
game actually has these changes that
guess<00:03:32.209> what<00:03:32.300> the<00:03:32.570> community<00:03:32.720> has<00:03:32.959> been<00:03:33.260> asking

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
guess what the community has been asking

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:36.280 
guess what the community has been asking
for<00:03:33.920> for<00:03:34.130> a<00:03:34.459> very<00:03:34.640> long<00:03:35.180> time<00:03:35.240> but<00:03:35.990> this<00:03:36.110> still

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
for for a very long time but this still

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.650 
for for a very long time but this still
poses<00:03:36.650> the<00:03:36.740> question<00:03:36.770> is<00:03:37.310> matchmaking<00:03:38.030> broken

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
poses the question is matchmaking broken

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:40.240 
poses the question is matchmaking broken
the<00:03:38.840> reason<00:03:39.140> I<00:03:39.200> think<00:03:39.410> it's<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:39.709> broken<00:03:39.920> is<00:03:40.220> the

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
the reason I think it's so broken is the

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.460 
the reason I think it's so broken is the
fact<00:03:40.580> that<00:03:40.730> like<00:03:41.270> I<00:03:41.390> said<00:03:41.600> valves<00:03:42.020> hands<00:03:42.290> are

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
fact that like I said valves hands are

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:44.590 
fact that like I said valves hands are
tied<00:03:42.680> here<00:03:42.709> if<00:03:43.070> they<00:03:43.340> want<00:03:43.459> to<00:03:43.580> create<00:03:43.760> 128<00:03:44.360> six

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:44.600 
tied here if they want to create 128 six

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
tied here if they want to create 128 six
servers<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.020> have<00:03:45.110> a<00:03:45.140> more<00:03:45.320> intrusive

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
servers and have a more intrusive

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.110 
servers and have a more intrusive
anti-cheat<00:03:46.310> they're<00:03:46.490> going<00:03:46.640> to<00:03:46.700> get<00:03:46.790> a<00:03:46.850> lot<00:03:47.090> of

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:47.120 
anti-cheat they're going to get a lot of

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.850 
anti-cheat they're going to get a lot of
backlash<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:47.780> a<00:03:47.870> lot<00:03:48.050> more<00:03:48.200> people<00:03:48.530> aren't

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
backlash and a lot more people aren't

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:50.410 
backlash and a lot more people aren't
gonna<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.100> able<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.340> play<00:03:49.400> the<00:03:49.580> game<00:03:49.820> so<00:03:50.270> I<00:03:50.300> do

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
gonna be able to play the game so I do

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.330 
gonna be able to play the game so I do
understand<00:03:51.050> why<00:03:51.140> valve<00:03:51.350> does<00:03:51.590> this<00:03:51.860> but<00:03:52.250> this

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
understand why valve does this but this

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.310 
understand why valve does this but this
doesn't<00:03:52.760> make<00:03:52.850> matchmaking<00:03:53.420> any<00:03:53.690> more<00:03:53.900> broken

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:54.320 
doesn't make matchmaking any more broken

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:56.140 
doesn't make matchmaking any more broken
but<00:03:54.709> I'm<00:03:54.800> grateful<00:03:55.100> for<00:03:55.250> the<00:03:55.550> services<00:03:55.970> like

seriously their services out there for
people<00:04:10.610> like<00:04:11.000> us<00:04:11.180> but<00:04:11.750> yes<00:04:11.989> matchmaking<00:04:12.680> at

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
people like us but yes matchmaking at

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.560 
people like us but yes matchmaking at
the<00:04:13.070> higher<00:04:13.280> rank<00:04:13.610> seems<00:04:13.940> to<00:04:14.060> be<00:04:14.150> completely

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:14.570 
the higher rank seems to be completely

00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:16.270 
the higher rank seems to be completely
broken<00:04:14.930> and<00:04:15.260> it's<00:04:15.440> fundamentally<00:04:16.160> broken

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:16.280 
broken and it's fundamentally broken

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:18.099 
broken and it's fundamentally broken
because<00:04:16.970> a<00:04:17.030> lot<00:04:17.299> of<00:04:17.330> these<00:04:17.540> features<00:04:17.989> that

00:04:18.099 --> 00:04:18.109 
because a lot of these features that

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.080 
because a lot of these features that
were<00:04:18.230> implemented<00:04:18.820> originally<00:04:19.820> when<00:04:20.000> the

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:20.090 
were implemented originally when the

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:22.180 
were implemented originally when the
game<00:04:20.270> came<00:04:20.510> out<00:04:20.570> and<00:04:20.989> guess<00:04:21.500> what<00:04:21.770> they're

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
game came out and guess what they're

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:23.530 
game came out and guess what they're
probably<00:04:22.460> gonna<00:04:22.700> stay<00:04:22.970> there<00:04:23.150> for<00:04:23.330> a<00:04:23.360> while

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:23.540 
probably gonna stay there for a while

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.120 
probably gonna stay there for a while
and<00:04:23.900> I<00:04:24.140> honestly<00:04:24.560> don't<00:04:24.770> think<00:04:24.890> the

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 
and I honestly don't think the

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.830 
and I honestly don't think the
tournament<00:04:25.490> edition<00:04:25.850> I<00:04:26.030> recommended<00:04:26.660> is

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:26.840 
tournament edition I recommended is
