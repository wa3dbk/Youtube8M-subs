abnormal you can normally feel the

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.400 
abnormal you can normally feel the
bladder<00:01:31.590> kidneys<00:01:32.720> liver<00:01:33.720> if<00:01:33.960> it<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.260> a

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:34.410 
bladder kidneys liver if it is a

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.910

abnormally enlarged and again lift nodes

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.390 
abnormally enlarged and again lift nodes
at<00:01:41.130> the<00:01:41.250> hind<00:01:41.430> end<00:01:42.200> so<00:01:43.200> the<00:01:43.320> exam<00:01:43.650> typically<00:01:44.250> is

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
at the hind end so the exam typically is

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:47.900 
at the hind end so the exam typically is
quite<00:01:44.700> brief<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:46.230> only<00:01:46.530> thing<00:01:46.800> that<00:01:47.010> I<00:01:47.280> mean

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:47.910 
quite brief the only thing that I mean

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.880 
quite brief the only thing that I mean
if<00:01:48.060> an<00:01:48.450> owner<00:01:48.600> has<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.870> particular<00:01:49.350> concern<00:01:49.710> we

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
if an owner has a particular concern we

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.260 
if an owner has a particular concern we
will<00:01:49.920> focus<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.610> that<00:01:50.790> aspect<00:01:53.030> next<00:01:54.030> we<00:01:54.150> will

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
will focus on that aspect next we will

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:31.680 
will focus on that aspect next we will
listen<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.540> the<00:01:54.690> heart

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.030 

now<00:02:32.690> when<00:02:32.810> we<00:02:32.900> listen<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> heart<00:02:33.590> we're

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
now when we listen to the heart we're

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.650 
now when we listen to the heart we're
normally<00:02:34.370> listening<00:02:34.640> for<00:02:34.820> the<00:02:34.910> rate<00:02:35.120> the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 
normally listening for the rate the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.900 
normally listening for the rate the
rhythm<00:02:36.020> and<00:02:36.230> listening<00:02:36.560> for<00:02:36.770> any<00:02:36.860> murmurs<00:02:37.340> and

rhythm and listening for any murmurs and

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.520 
rhythm and listening for any murmurs and
again<00:02:38.300> if<00:02:38.510> an<00:02:38.630> owner<00:02:38.780> has<00:02:38.990> a<00:02:39.050> particular

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
again if an owner has a particular

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.530 
again if an owner has a particular
concern<00:02:39.920> that<00:02:40.130> a<00:02:40.160> dog<00:02:40.400> is<00:02:40.430> very<00:02:40.670> lethargic<00:02:41.000> or
