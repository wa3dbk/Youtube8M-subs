now in this ad minor the accidentals are

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.040 
now in this ad minor the accidentals are
the<00:00:51.390> same<00:00:51.660> with<00:00:51.930> f<00:00:52.199> sharp<00:00:52.500> major

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:54.050 
the same with f sharp major

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.139 
the same with f sharp major
we<00:00:55.050> can<00:00:55.260> just<00:00:55.829> start<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.610> little<00:00:56.730> bit<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:56.940> a

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
we can just start a little bit with a

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:04.310 
we can just start a little bit with a
sharp<00:01:00.020> G<00:01:01.020> sharp<00:01:01.219> and<00:01:02.219> Asia<00:01:02.989> they<00:01:03.989> would<00:01:04.140> have

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
sharp G sharp and Asia they would have

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.649 
sharp G sharp and Asia they would have
been<00:01:04.769> natural<00:01:05.240> then<00:01:06.240> C<00:01:06.720> sharp<00:01:07.140> d<00:01:07.799> sharp<00:01:07.830> F

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:08.659 
been natural then C sharp d sharp F

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:14.090 
been natural then C sharp d sharp F
natural<00:01:10.580> connection<00:01:11.720> now<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:12.780> same<00:01:13.170> happens

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
natural connection now the same happens

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.399 
natural connection now the same happens
in<00:01:14.369> this<00:01:15.090> sharp<00:01:15.680> minor<00:01:16.680> so<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.549> this<00:01:17.880> chart<00:01:18.240> we

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
in this sharp minor so in this chart we

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:38.260 
in this sharp minor so in this chart we
start<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.590> this<00:01:19.770> sharp<00:01:25.280> F<00:01:26.280> sharp<00:01:29.150> a<00:01:30.150> sharp

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:49.370 

so<00:01:39.010> only<00:01:40.010> two<00:01:40.190> natural

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.560 

now<00:01:50.380> at<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> very<00:01:50.710> beginning<00:01:51.250> there<00:01:51.460> that<00:01:52.390> we

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:52.570 
now at the very beginning there that we

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.240 
now at the very beginning there that we
can<00:01:52.750> just<00:01:52.960> try<00:01:53.260> to<00:01:53.790> imitate<00:01:54.790> us<00:01:55.500> as<00:01:56.500> best<00:01:56.980> as

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.250 
can just try to imitate us as best as

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:02.790 
can just try to imitate us as best as
possible<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:59.020> introduction<00:01:59.680> with<00:02:01.620> which<00:02:02.620> is

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:02.800 
possible the introduction with which is

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:16.780 
possible the introduction with which is
does<00:02:02.980> with<00:02:03.190> voices

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:16.790 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.369 

so<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:18.670> very<00:02:19.670> first<00:02:19.879> phrase<00:02:20.269> belongs<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:21.260> the
