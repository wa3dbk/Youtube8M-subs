00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
one thing that has caught my eye is the

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:37.700 
one thing that has caught my eye is the
thing<00:00:32.340> called<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> stone<00:00:33.570> um<00:00:36.530> well<00:00:37.530> that's

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
thing called the stone um well that's

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.860 
thing called the stone um well that's
escaped<00:00:38.250> the<00:00:38.550> name<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:39.059> the<00:00:39.149> name<00:00:39.270> escapes<00:00:39.570> me

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
escaped the name of the name escapes me

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.840 
escaped the name of the name escapes me
at<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.110> moment<00:00:40.230> but<00:00:40.579> anyway<00:00:41.579> it<00:00:41.640> has

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
at the moment but anyway it has

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.069 
at the moment but anyway it has
something<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.210> do<00:00:42.390> it's<00:00:42.570> like<00:00:42.629> the<00:00:42.809> stone

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
something to do it's like the stone

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340 
something to do it's like the stone
cutter<00:00:43.379> I<00:00:43.860> think<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.309> what's<00:00:44.489> called<00:00:44.760> and<00:00:45.350> so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
cutter I think it's what's called and so

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.150 
cutter I think it's what's called and so
and<00:00:46.710> what<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> says<00:00:47.610> it<00:00:47.820> does<00:00:47.850> is<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.660> is<00:00:48.870> um<00:00:49.260> you

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
and what it says it does is to is um you

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.369 
and what it says it does is to is um you
know<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> can<00:00:50.550> create<00:00:50.850> stone<00:00:51.420> from<00:00:51.840> Col<00:00:52.050> stone

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
know you can create stone from Col stone

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.130 
know you can create stone from Col stone
like<00:00:52.680> with<00:00:52.949> it<00:00:53.129> so<00:00:53.370> they're<00:00:54.300> trying<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.690> make<00:00:54.780> a

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
like with it so they're trying to make a

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.010 
like with it so they're trying to make a
I<00:00:55.559> think<00:00:55.739> a<00:00:56.190> pocket<00:00:56.699> edition<00:00:56.789> exclusive<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.780> new

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
I think a pocket edition exclusive a new

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.880 
I think a pocket edition exclusive a new
one<00:00:58.289> item<00:00:58.890> and<00:00:59.660> that<00:01:00.660> can<00:01:01.100> maybe<00:01:02.539> convert

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:03.890 
one item and that can maybe convert

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.020 
one item and that can maybe convert
converted<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:04.979> lot<00:01:05.010> quicker<00:01:05.309> than<00:01:05.430> a<00:01:05.640> furnace

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
converted a lot quicker than a furnace

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.050 
converted a lot quicker than a furnace
can<00:01:06.770> back<00:01:07.770> into<00:01:07.979> stone<00:01:08.220> I'm<00:01:08.430> not<00:01:08.790> completely

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
can back into stone I'm not completely

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.609 
can back into stone I'm not completely
sure<00:01:09.240> on<00:01:09.840> this<00:01:10.020> so<00:01:10.409> what<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.920> propose<00:01:11.430> is<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.659> put
