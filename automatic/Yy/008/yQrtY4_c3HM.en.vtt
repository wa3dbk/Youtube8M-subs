00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.489
 I am AndrÃ© Pigu called some basic notions about the track 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:22.329
 to encourage them and especially so that the ppc grandson 

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:24.589
 an instrument 

00:00:24.589 --> 00:00:27.589
 and as grateful as it is 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.940
 in a series of easily arresting components 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.040
 basin so that the vibration is modified 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.080
 the bridge that 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.000
 there they are tied because some fixed way 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
 The mast 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.700
 they only serve to silence our notes and that something similar does not sound 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.910
 bishop 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.990
 and then there's 

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.400
 one decides rolls where they are threaded 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.500
 and when tightening it allows loosening 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.500
 or think a bit about our rope to get the foundation 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.030
 is a system that is based 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.580
 the citation to a vibration 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.180
 of a single door 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.180
 to exemplify it I'm going to follow 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.340
 that does not mean pretty well 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:25.760
 that's why the rope is 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.470
 hostel room 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.880
 that the rope is subjected 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 Way to old 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.630
 what would I have if I do it 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.900
 slowing down your travel 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.510
 in the guitar in the operation that we are going to have is exactly the same with 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.350
 a hand 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.070
 we will manage the height 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.780
 which we want to live 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.030
 and with the other pulsar 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.910
 every time we get closer 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:52.880
 it's not bad the bridge wants peace 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:54.350
 Sound 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 that occurs will be quite below 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.630
 the exhibition of the tate gallery as well 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.630
 the sixth string to the air 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:30.059
 with this you should be able to play at least a little melody 

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:35.509
 everything to be tested 

00:02:35.509 --> 00:02:36.879
 a this would be a sun 

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:37.949
 study 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:40.949
 and this can 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:44.899
 palm in quito 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:48.649
 tuco ayma high part of the mast to see what are the cures that 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:49.649
 Really 

00:02:49.649 --> 00:02:52.649
 soto with this song 

00:03:07.369 --> 00:03:10.219
 the encryption hello tablature 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:13.219
 is a system a legal literal transcript 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.409
 on paper what we see 

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.819
 an outline of how it would be 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:21.049
 pillar 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:24.499
 you will see six horizontal lines that will represent each of 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:25.789
 our ropes 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:28.379
 i on each of the ropes 

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:30.089
 in a series of numbers 

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:32.629
 numbers means the frets in which 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:33.829
 position 

00:03:33.829 --> 00:03:36.829
 if for example in the first line does not come out 2 

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:43.949
 and so on 

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:49.179
 impossible 

00:03:49.179 --> 00:03:51.639
 that is arrived 

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:54.639
 that someone believes that the divine 

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.339
 it surely goes 

00:04:09.339 --> 00:04:10.669
 we can identify it
