very weird very back here yeah well I
did<00:03:32.400> this<00:03:32.640> just<00:03:33.060> because<00:03:34.099> someone<00:03:35.099> mentioned

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:35.610 
did this just because someone mentioned

00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:39.710 
did this just because someone mentioned
in<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:36.540> first<00:03:36.930> or<00:03:37.319> the<00:03:37.380> last<00:03:37.590> week<00:03:38.400> of<00:03:39.120> top<00:03:39.450> 10

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:39.720 
in the first or the last week of top 10

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:42.680 
in the first or the last week of top 10
tanks<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:41.069> the<00:03:41.790> chance<00:03:42.120> of<00:03:42.269> getting<00:03:42.330> them

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:42.690 
tanks that the chance of getting them

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.580 
tanks that the chance of getting them
all<00:03:42.900> right<00:03:43.230> was<00:03:43.500> insanely<00:03:44.190> small<00:03:45.290> but<00:03:46.290> i<00:03:46.319> have

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
all right was insanely small but i have

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.309 
all right was insanely small but i have
just<00:03:46.769> thought<00:03:47.130> i<00:03:47.340> had<00:03:47.550> just<00:03:47.880> thought<00:03:48.060> that<00:03:48.319> i

00:03:49.309 --> 00:03:49.319 
just thought i had just thought that i

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:52.940 
just thought i had just thought that i
had<00:03:49.590> cleared<00:03:50.550> my<00:03:50.849> views<00:03:51.209> on<00:03:51.510> some<00:03:51.870> tanks<00:03:52.319> of

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
had cleared my views on some tanks of

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.289 
had cleared my views on some tanks of
course<00:03:53.310> getting<00:03:53.549> them<00:03:53.760> in<00:03:53.940> the<00:03:54.060> right<00:03:54.239> order

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
course getting them in the right order

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.070 
course getting them in the right order
would<00:03:55.170> be<00:03:55.230> tough<00:03:55.739> but<00:03:56.549> if<00:03:56.819> you<00:03:57.209> are<00:03:57.569> still

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
would be tough but if you are still

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.530 
would be tough but if you are still
listening<00:03:58.650> and<00:03:58.860> have<00:03:59.580> stuck<00:04:00.000> through<00:04:00.330> the

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:00.540 
listening and have stuck through the
