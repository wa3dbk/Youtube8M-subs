00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.360
 back to Frankfurt Completion of my childhood in Frankfurt am Main 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.289
 There is a whole lot of disco 

00:00:09.289 --> 00:00:12.079
 Personally, I find discotheques Kaka 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:13.199
 Wallander 

00:00:13.199 --> 00:00:15.039
 Hansen bouncer 

00:00:15.039 --> 00:00:17.380
 this is mostly a countryman 

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.199
 feel with the name 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.199
 she is so entangled 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.699
 Duco debt relief 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:32.790
 in the league is FP 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.790
 and you look like Switzerland 

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.800
 Look at shoe ass 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.640
 al-assad 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.610
 When discussing the old one he will open sour text passage studio 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.740
 Bucher is completely different always and everywhere good 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.500
 and not just by 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.420
 through communities back to the German client 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.150
 has 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.720
 then I come in the nightclub 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.320
 that compensates for everything 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.450
 ple 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.820

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.820
 Weischer Germans love to dance 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 not a question like her with us tonight 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.160
 one keeps dancing to the rhythm on the words 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.290
 and I told Swan the boys 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.900
 because the woman unintentionally too 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:43.900
 the woman if that is when the covenant now has good night 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.060
 What did Rolfes mean? 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.730
 why they think so, even if they can be 

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:54.730
 in discos go to the toilet it is so super replace 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.320
 I knew that with this good path 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.490
 "I have to go seat 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.779
 like last in the cash register like the plague we want well now 

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.919
 at the cabins 

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.459
 what do the boys have 

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.799
 that was it 

00:02:13.799 --> 00:02:16.459
 maximum two cabins 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:19.069
 Davos a broken but the whole staff 

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.269
 and more complements because I use but men too 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.749
 Just curious these years now these calls know construction 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.680
 and I will not do that any more in the gyms of the men you give 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.309
 everything is always super caps are not us but not inconspicuously open 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:39.629

00:02:56.149 --> 00:02:57.839
 I arrive 

00:02:57.839 --> 00:03:00.899
 the cabins are occupied defect whatever it is only the urinals 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.289
 I make the front in front of the last pass 

00:03:05.289 --> 00:03:08.289
 so that only one bed can be placed next to it 

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:13.599
 and not everyone is happy to buy nothing but Slavik 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.169
 behind the leader 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 after initially adopted relaxation techniques 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.259
 I felt calm 

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.539

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.309
 right at the moment 

00:03:48.309 --> 00:03:50.269
 Compliments and bums 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:52.469
 there is not right next to it 

00:03:52.469 --> 00:03:54.249
 I was the other day 

00:03:54.249 --> 00:03:57.249
 because there is something unthinkably explained 

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:05.319
 Börger and now always 

00:04:08.279 --> 00:04:11.279
 Here we are further where it can, therefore it is 

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:13.589
 they are on every occasion 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:16.589

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.019
 Cool Logroño 

00:04:24.979 --> 00:04:27.979
 so it's already burned 

00:04:29.159 --> 00:04:31.659
 win in the port of Lingen 

00:04:31.659 --> 00:04:34.659
 who's going to be the carpenter's doorman next? 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:40.039
 never stand up to 8 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.120
 but always in the 

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.919
 RAA 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:48.139
 where the group never got the idea him 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.139
 should with a direct eye 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.099
 Coking plant Ulrich Kuhl Paul Albers GDL
