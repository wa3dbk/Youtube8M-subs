less like fused or attached to the
rotator<00:00:29.039> cuff<00:00:30.320> so<00:00:31.320> he<00:00:31.439> had<00:00:31.560> to<00:00:31.710> go<00:00:31.890> in<00:00:32.099> there

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
rotator cuff so he had to go in there

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.680 
rotator cuff so he had to go in there
and<00:00:32.600> separate<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.840> two<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.700> then<00:00:35.700> fix<00:00:36.300> the

rock a rotator cuff tear so so that

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.280 
rock a rotator cuff tear so so that
means<00:00:41.700> that<00:00:41.850> my<00:00:41.969> recovery<00:00:42.300> time<00:00:42.690> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> lot

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.230 
feeling a little nauseated I think from
I<00:01:13.760> think<00:01:14.760> from<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.330> anesthesia<00:01:15.840> um<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:17.240> haven't

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
I think from the anesthesia um I haven't

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.840 
I think from the anesthesia um I haven't
really<00:01:18.509> been<00:01:18.570> able<00:01:18.869> to<00:01:19.020> eat<00:01:19.259> much<00:01:19.560> my<00:01:20.430> arm<00:01:20.640> is

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
really been able to eat much my arm is

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:23.420 
really been able to eat much my arm is
still<00:01:21.150> numb<00:01:21.420> from<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:22.530> nerve<00:01:22.710> block<00:01:22.890> they<00:01:23.159> put

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
still numb from the nerve block they put

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.590 
still numb from the nerve block they put
in<00:01:23.549> for<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.909> surgery

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
in for the surgery

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.420 
in for the surgery
I'll<00:01:24.960> stay<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.470> for<00:01:25.920> several<00:01:26.130> more
