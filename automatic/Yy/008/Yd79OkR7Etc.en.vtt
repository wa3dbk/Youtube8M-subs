00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:22.600 

she<00:02:19.940> finds<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.660> height<00:02:20.960> is<00:02:21.080> good<00:02:21.320> but<00:02:21.680> she's

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:22.610 
she finds the height is good but she's

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:27.340 
she finds the height is good but she's
not<00:02:22.700> used<00:02:22.910> to<00:02:23.030> the<00:02:23.120> handle<00:02:23.450> so<00:02:23.980> we'll<00:02:24.980> see<00:02:26.350> and

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:27.350 
not used to the handle so we'll see and

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.090 
not used to the handle so we'll see and
she<00:02:27.890> did<00:02:28.160> take<00:02:28.370> your<00:02:28.580> gloves<00:02:29.150> off<00:02:29.980> they<00:02:30.980> were<00:02:31.070> a

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:31.100 
she did take your gloves off they were a

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.640 
she did take your gloves off they were a
little<00:02:31.190> bit<00:02:31.400> too<00:02:31.580> tight<00:02:31.790> restrictive<00:02:32.450> so<00:02:32.690> I'm

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
little bit too tight restrictive so I'm

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:36.520 
little bit too tight restrictive so I'm
gonna<00:02:33.920> have<00:02:34.160> to<00:02:34.400> either<00:02:35.000> get<00:02:35.530> more

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
gonna have to either get more

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.660 
gonna have to either get more
unrestricted<00:02:37.220> gloves<00:02:37.460> for<00:02:37.760> her<00:02:39.040> or<00:02:40.040> do

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
unrestricted gloves for her or do

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.040 
unrestricted gloves for her or do
something<00:02:40.940> with<00:02:41.060> the<00:02:41.240> brakes

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
something with the brakes

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.210 
something with the brakes
I<00:02:42.370> find<00:02:43.370> that<00:02:43.520> the<00:02:43.760> gas<00:02:44.000> bars<00:02:44.840> are<00:02:45.410> a<00:02:45.980> little

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
I find that the gas bars are a little

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.030 
I find that the gas bars are a little
bit<00:02:46.430> thicker<00:02:46.640> than<00:02:46.760> our<00:02:47.000> other<00:02:47.120> scooter<00:02:48.040> but

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
bit thicker than our other scooter but

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.550 
bit thicker than our other scooter but
we<00:02:49.670> are<00:02:49.850> pretty<00:02:50.120> pleased<00:02:50.390> with<00:02:50.420> it<00:02:50.810> I've<00:02:51.410> had

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
we are pretty pleased with it I've had

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.370 
we are pretty pleased with it I've had
it<00:02:51.710> up<00:02:51.890> so<00:02:52.550> far<00:02:52.760> up<00:02:52.880> to<00:02:53.060> about<00:02:53.270> 120<00:02:54.310> no<00:02:55.310> problem

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
it up so far up to about 120 no problem

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:00.070 
it up so far up to about 120 no problem
I've<00:02:57.380> seen<00:02:57.710> them<00:02:57.860> do<00:02:58.070> 150<00:02:59.060> I<00:02:59.300> think<00:02:59.630> on<00:02:59.780> on

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:00.080 
I've seen them do 150 I think on on

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.040 
I've seen them do 150 I think on on
YouTube<00:03:01.240> and<00:03:02.240> it's<00:03:02.570> got<00:03:02.690> plenty<00:03:02.840> of<00:03:02.960> power

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
YouTube and it's got plenty of power

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:04.870 
YouTube and it's got plenty of power
it's<00:03:03.770> very<00:03:03.980> quiet<00:03:04.220> though<00:03:04.400> it's<00:03:04.580> almost<00:03:04.670> like

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:04.880 
it's very quiet though it's almost like

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:06.790 
it's very quiet though it's almost like
an<00:03:05.000> electric<00:03:05.330> scooter<00:03:05.540> it's<00:03:06.140> not<00:03:06.320> roaring

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:06.800 
an electric scooter it's not roaring

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.480 
an electric scooter it's not roaring
like<00:03:07.010> my<00:03:07.160> old<00:03:07.310> scooter<00:03:07.720> so<00:03:08.720> it's<00:03:09.490> it's

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
like my old scooter so it's it's

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.760 
like my old scooter so it's it's
powerful<00:03:10.910> and<00:03:11.180> torquey<00:03:11.690> but<00:03:12.080> yet<00:03:12.290> not<00:03:12.470> noisy

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:17.770 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:19.920 

as<00:03:18.310> you<00:03:18.520> can<00:03:18.670> see<00:03:18.790> it's<00:03:19.270> really<00:03:19.390> not<00:03:19.510> noisy<00:03:19.900> you

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
as you can see it's really not noisy you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.170 
as you can see it's really not noisy you
can<00:03:20.140> see<00:03:20.740> from<00:03:20.920> here

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:22.180 
can see from here

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:23.850 
can see from here
there<00:03:22.480> is<00:03:22.570> a<00:03:22.600> lot<00:03:22.810> of<00:03:22.960> gravel<00:03:23.320> around<00:03:23.530> here<00:03:23.680> so

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:23.860 
there is a lot of gravel around here so

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:25.650 
there is a lot of gravel around here so
I<00:03:23.890> she's<00:03:24.190> going<00:03:24.400> to<00:03:24.460> be<00:03:24.520> really<00:03:25.000> super<00:03:25.270> careful

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
I she's going to be really super careful

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.870 
I she's going to be really super careful
I<00:03:25.750> told<00:03:25.930> her<00:03:26.020> be<00:03:26.170> really<00:03:26.380> careful<00:03:26.770> with<00:03:27.760> the

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
I told her be really careful with the

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:29.550 
I told her be really careful with the
gravel<00:03:28.210> don't<00:03:28.510> do<00:03:28.660> torrents<00:03:29.020> on<00:03:29.140> the<00:03:29.230> gravel

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.560 
gravel don't do torrents on the gravel

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.230 
gravel don't do torrents on the gravel
if<00:03:29.800> you<00:03:29.980> have<00:03:30.070> to<00:03:30.250> just<00:03:30.550> drive<00:03:30.730> through<00:03:30.910> it<00:03:31.090> and

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:31.240 
if you have to just drive through it and

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:34.800 
if you have to just drive through it and
look<00:03:31.570> to<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.810> smallest<00:03:32.370> spot<00:03:33.370> so<00:03:34.060> that<00:03:34.120> you

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:34.810 
look to the smallest spot so that you

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.000 
look to the smallest spot so that you
don't<00:03:34.990> have<00:03:35.110> any<00:03:36.360> crashes<00:03:37.360> there<00:03:38.010> she's

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:39.010 
don't have any crashes there she's

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.260 
don't have any crashes there she's
practicing<00:03:39.400> with<00:03:39.550> the<00:03:39.640> blinkers<00:03:39.910> and<00:03:40.120> stuff

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
practicing with the blinkers and stuff

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:42.240 
practicing with the blinkers and stuff
like<00:03:40.420> that<00:03:40.540> -<00:03:40.750> I<00:03:40.960> think<00:03:41.470> she's<00:03:41.770> slowly<00:03:41.950> getting

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
like that - I think she's slowly getting

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.340 
like that - I think she's slowly getting
more<00:03:42.370> confident<00:03:42.850> with<00:03:42.940> it

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
more confident with it

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:48.000 
more confident with it
and<00:03:44.350> probably<00:03:45.250> hopefully<00:03:45.910> within<00:03:46.240> a<00:03:47.010> couple

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
and probably hopefully within a couple

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.040 
and probably hopefully within a couple
weeks<00:03:48.340> so<00:03:48.640> we'll<00:03:48.880> get<00:03:49.420> on<00:03:49.540> the<00:03:49.630> road<00:03:49.780> but<00:03:50.020> I

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.050 
weeks so we'll get on the road but I

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:51.290 
weeks so we'll get on the road but I
just<00:03:50.230> want<00:03:50.380> to<00:03:50.410> practice<00:03:50.590> them<00:03:50.860> that<00:03:51.040> on<00:03:51.220> the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
just want to practice them that on the

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.360 
just want to practice them that on the
parking<00:03:52.300> lot<00:03:52.420> first<00:03:52.950> so<00:03:53.950> you've<00:03:54.040> done<00:03:54.130> a<00:03:54.190> lot

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
parking lot first so you've done a lot

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:56.280 
parking lot first so you've done a lot
riding<00:03:54.880> with<00:03:55.060> other<00:03:55.270> scooters<00:03:55.510> we've<00:03:56.020> been<00:03:56.170> to

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:56.290 
riding with other scooters we've been to

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.740 
riding with other scooters we've been to
BAM<00:03:56.470> she's<00:03:56.770> run<00:03:56.950> road<00:03:57.820> hundreds<00:03:58.330> and<00:03:58.480> hundreds

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
BAM she's run road hundreds and hundreds

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.200 
BAM she's run road hundreds and hundreds
of<00:03:58.840> kilometres<00:03:59.200> with<00:03:59.380> me<00:03:59.590> on<00:03:59.890> the<00:04:00.610> scooter<00:04:00.940> but

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
of kilometres with me on the scooter but

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:02.460 
of kilometres with me on the scooter but
not<00:04:01.420> with<00:04:01.540> this<00:04:01.630> one<00:04:01.690> here's<00:04:02.020> a<00:04:02.200> little<00:04:02.380> bit

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:02.470 
not with this one here's a little bit

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.810 
not with this one here's a little bit
bigger<00:04:02.650> so<00:04:03.270> 330<00:04:04.270> cc's<00:04:04.750> or<00:04:05.110> 350<00:04:05.950> CC<00:04:06.280> so<00:04:06.580> it's<00:04:06.730> a

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
bigger so 330 cc's or 350 CC so it's a

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:10.230 
bigger so 330 cc's or 350 CC so it's a
little<00:04:07.030> more<00:04:07.120> powerful<00:04:08.070> but<00:04:09.070> it'll<00:04:09.970> be<00:04:10.060> good

00:04:10.230 --> 00:04:10.240 
little more powerful but it'll be good

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.020 
little more powerful but it'll be good
because<00:04:10.360> then<00:04:10.660> we<00:04:10.750> can<00:04:10.870> go<00:04:10.960> cruising<00:04:11.350> with<00:04:11.440> it

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
because then we can go cruising with it

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.850 
because then we can go cruising with it

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:45.730 
highway freeway so I think it's much

00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:48.570 
highway freeway so I think it's much
more<00:04:45.760> suitable<00:04:46.450> for<00:04:46.660> her<00:04:47.170> than<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:47.770> ninja<00:04:48.310> at

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:48.580 
more suitable for her than a ninja at

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.710 
more suitable for her than a ninja at
this<00:04:48.760> time<00:04:48.970> anyways<00:04:49.330> you<00:04:49.450> know<00:04:49.540> they'll

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
this time anyways you know they'll

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.720 
this time anyways you know they'll
probably<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:50.140> ninja<00:04:50.440> in<00:04:50.500> the<00:04:50.530> future<00:04:50.890> but<00:04:51.640> at

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:51.730 
probably a ninja in the future but at

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.460 
probably a ninja in the future but at
the<00:04:51.820> moment<00:04:52.000> I<00:04:52.240> think<00:04:52.300> this<00:04:52.600> is<00:04:52.780> perfect<00:04:53.260> for

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:53.470

for her so what's your impression so far

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.230 
for her so what's your impression so far
not<00:04:58.060> too<00:04:58.210> bad<00:04:58.360> right<00:04:58.950> it's<00:04:59.950> smooth<00:05:00.310> smooth<00:05:01.090> you

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
not too bad right it's smooth smooth you

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.460 
not too bad right it's smooth smooth you
don't<00:05:01.270> get<00:05:01.510> to<00:05:01.600> give<00:05:01.690> it<00:05:01.780> a<00:05:01.840> lot<00:05:01.960> of<00:05:01.990> gas<00:05:02.200> to<00:05:02.350> get

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:02.470 
don't get to give it a lot of gas to get

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:04.390 
don't get to give it a lot of gas to get
going<00:05:02.710> right
