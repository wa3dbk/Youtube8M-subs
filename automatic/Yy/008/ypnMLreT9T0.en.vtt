00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:06.569 
I received from our PG show this is my

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:09.770 
I received from our PG show this is my
most<00:00:06.899> recent<00:00:07.140> one<00:00:07.560> and<00:00:07.980> I<00:00:08.510> decided<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.599> pick

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
most recent one and I decided to pick

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.839 
most recent one and I decided to pick
this<00:00:09.929> one<00:00:09.990> because<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.910> looked<00:00:11.910> believable

00:00:13.839 --> 00:00:13.849 
this one because it looked believable

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.129 
this one because it looked believable
even<00:00:14.849> though<00:00:15.000> it's<00:00:15.179> a<00:00:15.269> straight<00:00:15.570> wing<00:00:15.780> so

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
even though it's a straight wing so

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.080 
even though it's a straight wing so
normally<00:00:16.560> more<00:00:17.100> natural-looking<00:00:17.550> ones<00:00:17.940> are

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
normally more natural-looking ones are

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.029 
normally more natural-looking ones are
like<00:00:18.210> curly<00:00:18.539> or<00:00:18.690> kinky<00:00:18.990> curly<00:00:19.170> this<00:00:19.830> one's

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
like curly or kinky curly this one's

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:21.080 
like curly or kinky curly this one's
straight<00:00:20.400> but<00:00:20.609> it<00:00:20.699> still<00:00:20.850> looks<00:00:21.029> pretty

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
straight but it still looks pretty

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.900 
straight but it still looks pretty
believable<00:00:21.510> I<00:00:21.810> think<00:00:22.170> if<00:00:22.859> you<00:00:23.070> take<00:00:23.250> a<00:00:23.279> look<00:00:23.730> at

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:23.910 
believable I think if you take a look at

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.429 
believable I think if you take a look at
the<00:00:24.029> texture<00:00:24.420> close-up<00:00:26.960> thank<00:00:27.960> you

is kind of sexy but you can part it

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.420 
is kind of sexy but you can part it
anywhere<00:01:03.510> it's<00:01:03.690> a<00:01:03.809> full<00:01:04.019> lace<00:01:04.170> tweak<00:01:04.439> as

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
anywhere it's a full lace tweak as

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.140 
anywhere it's a full lace tweak as
normal<00:01:06.110> it's<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.409> thick<00:01:07.909> density<00:01:08.909> so<00:01:09.119> I

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
normal it's really thick density so I

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.120 
normal it's really thick density so I
did<00:01:09.420> end<00:01:09.630> up<00:01:09.720> tweezing<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.409> part<00:01:10.680> as<00:01:10.860> well<00:01:11.010> as

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
did end up tweezing the part as well as

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.800 
did end up tweezing the part as well as
putting<00:01:11.280> a<00:01:11.490> bit<00:01:11.640> of<00:01:11.729> concealer<00:01:12.119> on<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.600> and

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
putting a bit of concealer on it and

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.080 
putting a bit of concealer on it and
this<00:01:13.260> one<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.619> a<00:01:13.650> 16<00:01:14.220> inch<00:01:14.369> so<00:01:14.640> it's<00:01:14.760> not<00:01:14.880> too

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
this one is a 16 inch so it's not too

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.840 
this one is a 16 inch so it's not too
long<00:01:15.299> it's<00:01:16.200> not<00:01:16.439> too<00:01:16.890> hard<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.250> manage<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.640> think

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
long it's not too hard to manage I think

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.719 
long it's not too hard to manage I think
because<00:01:18.150> the<00:01:18.330> length<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.830> pretty

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
because the length and this is pretty

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.670 
because the length and this is pretty
much<00:01:20.850> right<00:01:21.540> out<00:01:21.630> of<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> box<00:01:21.990> I<00:01:22.229> did<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.650> some

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
much right out of the box I did put some

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.060 
much right out of the box I did put some
curls<00:01:23.189> in<00:01:23.400> it<00:01:23.580> just<00:01:23.759> to<00:01:23.880> test<00:01:24.210> out<00:01:24.420> how<00:01:24.630> its

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.070 
curls in it just to test out how its

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.760 
curls in it just to test out how its
held<00:01:26.070> heat<00:01:26.400> and<00:01:26.610> as<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.509> expected<00:01:28.080> it<00:01:28.229> does<00:01:28.439> hold

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
held heat and as I expected it does hold

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.710 
held heat and as I expected it does hold
heat<00:01:28.950> very<00:01:29.310> well<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.150> think<00:01:30.210> it's<00:01:30.540> so

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
heat very well because I think it's so

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.350 
heat very well because I think it's so
coarse<00:01:32.150> and<00:01:33.150> thick<00:01:33.210> I<00:01:33.720> even<00:01:34.110> did<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.320> flat<00:01:34.560> twist

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 
coarse and thick I even did a flat twist

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.550 
coarse and thick I even did a flat twist
just<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.479> if<00:01:36.659> it<00:01:36.780> would<00:01:36.869> hold<00:01:37.110> and<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.350> flat

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
just as if it would hold and the flat

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.100 
just as if it would hold and the flat
twist<00:01:37.829> held<00:01:38.040> as<00:01:38.220> well<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.150> yeah<00:01:39.689> I<00:01:39.720> think<00:01:39.900> this

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
twist held as well so yeah I think this

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:42.020 
twist held as well so yeah I think this
is<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.259> really<00:01:40.500> good<00:01:40.680> one<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.979> like<00:01:41.189> it<00:01:41.430> so<00:01:41.939> I'll
