00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:33.609 
music video or if you see him play alive
it's<00:01:31.700> just<00:01:31.969> one<00:01:32.390> name<00:01:32.600> record<00:01:33.079> a<00:01:33.200> song<00:01:33.409> like

00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
that they really emphasize that note

and then I'm strumming through it and
I'm<00:02:24.130> hammering<00:02:24.459> on

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:42.410 

so<00:02:29.850> watch<00:02:30.090> very<00:02:30.330> slowly

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.750 

that's<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.260> intro<00:02:43.590> alright<00:02:44.220> for<00:02:44.490> the<00:02:44.550> verse

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
that's the intro alright for the verse

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.449 
that's the intro alright for the verse
the<00:02:45.240> chord<00:02:45.600> progression<00:02:46.230> switches<00:02:47.100> up<00:02:47.220> just<00:02:47.400> a

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
the chord progression switches up just a

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:48.860 
the chord progression switches up just a
little<00:02:47.490> bit<00:02:47.819> and<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.480> strumming<00:02:48.840> pattern

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:48.870 
little bit and the strumming pattern

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:50.710 
little bit and the strumming pattern
switches<00:02:49.440> up<00:02:49.560> just<00:02:49.740> a<00:02:49.800> little<00:02:49.830> bit<00:02:50.040> okay<00:02:50.370> so

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:50.720 
switches up just a little bit okay so

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.960 
switches up just a little bit okay so
what<00:02:51.720> the<00:02:51.990> strumming<00:02:52.590> pattern<00:02:52.920> and<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
what the strumming pattern and what the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.940 
what the strumming pattern and what the
verse<00:02:54.120> looks<00:02:54.390> like<00:02:54.569> is<00:02:54.690> this<00:02:54.840> it<00:02:55.140> starts<00:02:55.800> off

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:55.950 
verse looks like is this it starts off

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:15.080 
verse looks like is this it starts off
with<00:02:55.980> G<00:02:56.250> it<00:02:56.459> goes

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:20.600 

okay<00:03:15.629> so<00:03:15.690> instead<00:03:16.260> of<00:03:16.319> having<00:03:16.620> that<00:03:19.459> just<00:03:20.459> like

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
okay so instead of having that just like

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:21.830 
okay so instead of having that just like
the<00:03:20.700> intro<00:03:20.940> instead<00:03:21.150> of<00:03:21.239> having<00:03:21.360> that<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.660> minor

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
the intro instead of having that a minor

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:24.110 
the intro instead of having that a minor
7<00:03:22.200> in<00:03:22.260> there<00:03:22.379> we<00:03:22.470> don't<00:03:22.709> we<00:03:23.220> just<00:03:23.430> have<00:03:23.640> for<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
7 in there we don't we just have for the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.420 
7 in there we don't we just have for the
verse<00:03:27.349> addy<00:03:28.349> says<00:03:28.590> for<00:03:28.860> a<00:03:28.890> little<00:03:29.160> hammer<00:03:29.310> on

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:29.430 
verse addy says for a little hammer on

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:30.050 
verse addy says for a little hammer on
thing<00:03:29.670> okay

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
thing okay

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.720 
thing okay
and<00:03:31.019> how<00:03:31.769> that<00:03:31.920> strumming<00:03:32.280> pattern<00:03:32.549> looks

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
and how that strumming pattern looks

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:43.670 
and how that strumming pattern looks
like<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:35.810> so<00:03:36.810> it's<00:03:36.959> down

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:51.839 

put<00:03:44.680> me<00:03:44.950> down

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:51.849 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:53.880 

so<00:03:52.629> when<00:03:52.870> you<00:03:52.930> get<00:03:53.019> to<00:03:53.140> the<00:03:53.230> D<00:03:53.379> you<00:03:53.499> go<00:03:53.620> down

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
so when you get to the D you go down

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:59.099 
so when you get to the D you go down
down<00:03:54.489> and<00:03:55.030> hammer<00:03:55.239> on<00:03:57.389> okay<00:03:58.389> so<00:03:58.450> watch<00:03:58.840> very

00:03:59.099 --> 00:03:59.109 
down and hammer on okay so watch very

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:14.640 
down and hammer on okay so watch very
closely

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.180 

that's<00:04:15.250> it<00:04:15.400> right<00:04:15.549> there<00:04:15.849> okay<00:04:16.169> the<00:04:17.190> when

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:18.190 
that's it right there okay the when

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:20.520 
that's it right there okay the when
you're<00:04:18.310> going<00:04:18.489> through<00:04:18.790> the<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.329> verse<00:04:19.540> and

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
you're going through the the verse and

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:23.159 
you're going through the the verse and
into<00:04:20.799> the<00:04:20.919> chorus<00:04:21.310> the<00:04:21.519> pre-chorus<00:04:22.060> goes<00:04:22.900> like

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
into the chorus the pre-chorus goes like

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:36.100 
into the chorus the pre-chorus goes like
this<00:04:23.320> okay<00:04:23.500> it<00:04:24.310> goes

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:36.110 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:53.850 

in<00:04:36.530> the<00:04:36.680> inch<00:04:36.800> of<00:04:36.919> the<00:04:36.979> sauna

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:53.860 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.320 

okay<00:04:54.860> and<00:04:55.100> that's<00:04:55.430> the<00:04:55.580> chorus<00:04:55.880> just<00:04:56.060> as<00:04:56.210> the

intro was okay the same chord

00:04:57.560 --> 00:04:58.629 
intro was okay the same chord
progression<00:04:57.590> in<00:04:58.070> the<00:04:58.130> same<00:04:58.280> strumming

00:04:58.629 --> 00:04:58.639 
progression in the same strumming

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:00.129 
progression in the same strumming
pattern<00:04:58.910> so<00:04:59.450> let's<00:04:59.660> talk<00:04:59.810> about<00:04:59.960> that
