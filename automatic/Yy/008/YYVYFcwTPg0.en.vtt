00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:12.740
 worm and buscats he is our some 

00:00:10.999 --> 00:00:15.889
 videos and today I bring you how to find 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.310
 the jumping balls or last 3 lines or 

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:21.650
 the lemons or how do you say poop 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.720
 hopper to the truth I do not know how they say 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.759
 you and today we see when you want 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:27.740
 to make a video to find them 

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:29.359
 of the west in the swamp biome good 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.369
 in this panda language it's not a little 

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:32.960
 easier to find them and at night 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.000
 so that you are more likely to get 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.640
 appear by day is very low probability 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.430
 make it look good since we 're on 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:44.750
 night we have to go and look is what 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:47.050
 I do not like it obviously you have to look 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:50.000
 do not speak line will come for you but 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.830
 you have to look for it and the thing the truth 

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.989
 I do not know why they want it but that 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.900
 is the video that you have a way 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.489
 that when more people of things and the house 

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.710
 to look for I have made it so that they are 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.059
 saying of the comments that happens to me 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.190
 the oil or something like that that does not 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:06.440
 be I did it to give you a 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:09.560
 retouch to the language so that we will go 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.690
 carrying and it 's good to have a bit of 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.479
 patience in the video is that I walk 

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:17.390
 looking good is still line but is that 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.450
 these animals do not understand that they are 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:23.270
 cluttering though that's your job or is 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.470
 what you should do in this magnet no longer 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.520
 they have already I am saying it but 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:29.609
 good 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:32.750
 let's go find them I'm using 

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:38.930

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:45.140

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:47.630

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.320
 four other things that is a bit 

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.620
 of some came out about 16 I was 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.190
 make 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:03.320
 on paper 

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:05.150
 this is not something false that I have put 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.830
 les line this is so that those who do not 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:08.830
 They know how to find online 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.640
 good the information of all the video 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.290
 with what degree and that is in the 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.910
 description of the video if it gives me 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.300
 you read there is in the destruction 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:22.340

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.500
 between ones and there were no cuts here we are going to 

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.300
 notice as an hour looking but good 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.940

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.160
 we continue good friends there we have 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.110
 found other line what a coincidence that 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.790
 we have shown it in the same place in 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.010

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:39.140
 minecraft good some look that what of 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.590
 scanned not studied it seemed 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.209
 If you do not believe me do the same is the 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.830
 swamp at night and for that too they go 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:47.930
 to find a slide although it's a bit 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:50.390
 tedious looking for the guides as we see here 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.550
 we see some where is the incited because lines 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.430
 when you want lemon is the truth I do not know 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.650
 how to say in you here we see many 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.200
 say nothing 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:02.530
 a friends also some will say we are 

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:05.110

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:08.769
