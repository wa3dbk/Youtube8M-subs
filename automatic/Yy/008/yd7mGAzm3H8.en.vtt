00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
everything over but you still want to

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.679 
everything over but you still want to
give<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> good<00:01:07.740> walk<00:01:08.010> around<00:01:08.340> just<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.060> case<00:01:09.119> you

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
give a good walk around just in case you

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.620 
give a good walk around just in case you
see<00:01:09.960> anything<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.380> might<00:01:10.560> have<00:01:10.710> not<00:01:10.830> noticed

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
see anything they might have not noticed

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.420 
see anything they might have not noticed
all<00:01:12.630> right<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:12.930> can<00:01:13.049> go<00:01:13.170> ahead<00:01:13.409> and<00:01:13.619> lift<00:01:14.250> the

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
all right you can go ahead and lift the

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.820 
all right you can go ahead and lift the
hood<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.850> so<00:01:15.810> we've<00:01:15.930> already<00:01:16.080> filled<00:01:16.439> our<00:01:16.590> tank

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
hood up so we've already filled our tank

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.070 
hood up so we've already filled our tank
with<00:01:17.009> gas<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.729> this<00:01:18.060> engine<00:01:18.420> is<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> two-stroke

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
with gas and this engine is a two-stroke

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.499 
with gas and this engine is a two-stroke
motor<00:01:19.380> so<00:01:19.830> it<00:01:19.950> also<00:01:20.100> burns<00:01:20.460> oil<00:01:20.820> because<00:01:21.360> it

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
motor so it also burns oil because it

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.170 
motor so it also burns oil because it
doesn't<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.930> any<00:01:21.960> oil<00:01:22.580> like<00:01:23.580> your<00:01:23.729> car<00:01:23.970> does

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
doesn't have any oil like your car does

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.230 
doesn't have any oil like your car does
down<00:01:24.479> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:25.530> bottom<00:01:25.770> that<00:01:25.830> crankcase<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.939> we

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
down in the bottom that crankcase so we

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.969 
down in the bottom that crankcase so we
got<00:01:27.390> our<00:01:27.479> oil<00:01:27.720> here<00:01:28.049> make<00:01:28.350> sure<00:01:28.500> that's<00:01:28.680> good

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
got our oil here make sure that's good

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.679 
got our oil here make sure that's good
and<00:01:29.130> topped<00:01:29.340> off<00:01:29.579> because<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.360> run<00:01:30.540> out<00:01:30.570> of

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
and topped off because if you run out of

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.980 
and topped off because if you run out of
oil<00:01:30.869> and<00:01:31.200> your<00:01:31.590> engine<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:31.920> going<00:01:32.040> to<00:01:32.130> quit<00:01:32.990> its

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
oil and your engine is going to quit its

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.140 
oil and your engine is going to quit its
water-cooled<00:01:34.560> so<00:01:35.159> we<00:01:35.310> have<00:01:35.430> a<00:01:35.460> reservoir<00:01:35.909> here

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 
water-cooled so we have a reservoir here

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.300 
water-cooled so we have a reservoir here
for<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.479> water<00:01:36.659> and<00:01:36.960> just<00:01:37.110> kind<00:01:37.860> of<00:01:37.920> make<00:01:38.100> sure

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
for the water and just kind of make sure

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.140 
for the water and just kind of make sure
that<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.759> reservoir<00:01:39.570> has<00:01:40.310> has<00:01:41.310> water<00:01:41.640> in<00:01:41.850> it

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
that the reservoir has has water in it

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.660 
that the reservoir has has water in it
our<00:01:42.840> coolant<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:44.250> an<00:01:44.310> on<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.549> off<00:01:44.610> switch

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
our coolant there's an on and off switch

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.940 
our coolant there's an on and off switch
for<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.210> fuel<00:01:45.479> so<00:01:45.689> in<00:01:46.259> storing<00:01:46.770> and

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
for the fuel so in storing and

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.010 
for the fuel so in storing and
trailering<00:01:47.310> we<00:01:47.579> turn<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.880> switch<00:01:48.090> to<00:01:48.240> off<00:01:48.270> so

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
trailering we turn the switch to off so

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.020 
trailering we turn the switch to off so
the<00:01:49.140> fuel<00:01:49.350> doesn't<00:01:49.619> fill<00:01:50.250> up<00:01:50.340> the<00:01:50.460> carburetors

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
the fuel doesn't fill up the carburetors

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.990 
the fuel doesn't fill up the carburetors
so<00:01:51.689> we<00:01:51.780> want<00:01:51.930> to<00:01:52.020> turn<00:01:52.170> that<00:01:52.320> on<00:01:52.530> and<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:53.820> give

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
so we want to turn that on and just give

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.090 
so we want to turn that on and just give
give<00:01:54.420> a<00:01:54.450> quick<00:01:54.720> look<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:55.049> make<00:01:55.799> sure<00:01:55.829> the

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.170 
starter the cord looks like it's in good
condition<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> this<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.640> where<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.939> drive

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
condition so this is where the drive

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.090 
condition so this is where the drive
belt<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.630> housed<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:04.259> talked<00:02:04.590> about<00:02:04.680> having<00:02:04.950> a

and<00:02:07.860> we<00:02:07.920> can<00:02:08.039> just<00:02:08.190> check<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.550> condition<00:02:08.940> of

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060
