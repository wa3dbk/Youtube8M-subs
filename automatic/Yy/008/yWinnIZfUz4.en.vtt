otherwise it worse if you keep a few

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.550 
otherwise it worse if you keep a few
seconds<00:03:23.690> more<00:03:25.030> so<00:03:26.030> we<00:03:26.209> call<00:03:26.390> it<00:03:26.510> it<00:03:26.989> comes<00:03:27.320> up

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
seconds more so we call it it comes up

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.610 
seconds more so we call it it comes up
to<00:03:27.739> you<00:03:27.890> so<00:03:28.340> it<00:03:28.489> is<00:03:28.520> exactly<00:03:28.970> the<00:03:29.270> time<00:03:29.620> you

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
to you so it is exactly the time you

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:46.840 
to you so it is exactly the time you
take<00:03:31.280> it<00:03:31.430> out<00:03:31.580> roll<00:03:31.850> in<00:03:32.000> five

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.110 

we<00:03:47.300> should<00:03:47.540> miss<00:03:48.140> that<00:03:48.410> moment<00:03:48.700> so<00:03:49.700> you<00:03:49.730> should

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:50.120 
we should miss that moment so you should

00:03:50.120 --> 00:04:03.199 
we should miss that moment so you should
watch<00:03:50.300> it<00:03:50.330> carefully

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:08.660 

probably<00:04:04.209> a<00:04:04.299> few<00:04:04.510> seconds

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:12.080 

oh<00:04:08.760> the<00:04:09.630> line<00:04:09.810> was<00:04:10.080> cold<00:04:10.380> yeah<00:04:11.069> really<00:04:11.760> cold

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:12.090

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:26.740 
oh the line was cold yeah really cold
thing

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:26.750 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:46.060 

so<00:04:27.320> boils<00:04:29.170> keep<00:04:30.170> it<00:04:30.290> up

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:47.660
