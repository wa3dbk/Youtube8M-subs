00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
or something else but I chose those I

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:51.960 
or something else but I chose those I
chose<00:02:49.690> also<00:02:50.410> a<00:02:50.680> just<00:02:51.100> a<00:02:51.160> regular<00:02:51.340> tank<00:02:51.730> top

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:51.970 
chose also a just a regular tank top

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:54.810 
chose also a just a regular tank top
because<00:02:52.330> i<00:02:52.600> think<00:02:53.140> i<00:02:53.440> think<00:02:53.860> in<00:02:54.190> every<00:02:54.310> outfit

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:54.820 
because i think i think in every outfit

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.910 
because i think i think in every outfit
there<00:02:55.060> should<00:02:55.510> be<00:02:55.630> one<00:02:55.900> key<00:02:56.170> piece<00:02:56.380> that<00:02:56.620> pops

00:02:56.910 --> 00:02:56.920 
there should be one key piece that pops

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.949 
there should be one key piece that pops
because<00:02:57.880> if<00:02:58.000> you<00:02:58.090> have<00:02:58.209> too<00:02:58.390> many<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.750> just

00:02:58.949 --> 00:02:58.959 
because if you have too many is just

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:03.240 
because if you have too many is just
confusing<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.220> i<00:03:00.880> chose<00:03:01.620> just<00:03:02.620> the<00:03:02.739> pants<00:03:03.130> were

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
confusing so i chose just the pants were

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.610 
confusing so i chose just the pants were
kind<00:03:03.430> of<00:03:03.489> the<00:03:03.610> big<00:03:03.700> item<00:03:04.090> in<00:03:04.330> the<00:03:04.570> outfit<00:03:05.260> and

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
kind of the big item in the outfit and

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.160 
kind of the big item in the outfit and
the<00:03:06.209> tank<00:03:07.209> top<00:03:07.360> is<00:03:07.510> really<00:03:07.690> simple<00:03:07.870> it<00:03:08.140> just

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
couldn't find anything that really

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:52.620 
couldn't find anything that really
matched<00:03:49.239> the<00:03:49.420> outfit<00:03:50.970> so<00:03:51.970> what<00:03:52.330> I'd<00:03:52.450> probably

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
matched the outfit so what I'd probably

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.030 
matched the outfit so what I'd probably
do<00:03:52.840> just<00:03:53.049> take<00:03:53.230> this<00:03:53.350> out<00:03:53.560> and<00:03:53.590> click<00:03:53.860> like<00:03:54.010> a

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:54.040 
do just take this out and click like a

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.940 
do just take this out and click like a
different<00:03:54.700> kind<00:03:54.910> or<00:03:55.060> whatever<00:03:55.299> but<00:03:56.049> I<00:03:56.500> mean

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:56.950 
different kind or whatever but I mean

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.289 
different kind or whatever but I mean
these<00:03:57.040> are<00:03:57.220> so<00:03:57.370> perfect<00:03:57.640> for<00:03:57.820> the<00:03:57.970> summer<00:03:58.150> and

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:14.590 
all together because I mean I don't I

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.099 
all together because I mean I don't I
wear<00:04:15.190> necklaces<00:04:15.790> but<00:04:16.239> it's<00:04:16.510> very<00:04:16.780> rare

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
wear necklaces but it's very rare

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:18.720 
wear necklaces but it's very rare
because<00:04:17.320> my<00:04:17.620> hair<00:04:17.829> oh<00:04:17.859> it<00:04:18.100> always<00:04:18.280> gets<00:04:18.459> caught

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:18.730 
because my hair oh it always gets caught

00:04:18.730 --> 00:04:20.670 
because my hair oh it always gets caught
my<00:04:18.880> hair<00:04:19.090> and<00:04:19.299> I<00:04:19.510> don't<00:04:19.900> like<00:04:20.139> how<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.380> feels

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:20.680 
my hair and I don't like how it feels

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.040 
my hair and I don't like how it feels
sometimes<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:22.060> I<00:04:22.090> always<00:04:22.570> have<00:04:22.780> something

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:23.050 
sometimes so I always have something

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:26.460 
sometimes so I always have something
else<00:04:23.260> that<00:04:23.320> pops<00:04:23.650> more<00:04:24.120> so<00:04:25.169> no<00:04:26.169> necklace

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:26.470 
else that pops more so no necklace

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:28.590 
else that pops more so no necklace
because<00:04:26.889> I<00:04:27.100> think<00:04:27.160> sometimes<00:04:27.580> necklaces<00:04:28.360> take

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:28.600 
because I think sometimes necklaces take

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.510 
because I think sometimes necklaces take
away<00:04:29.080> from<00:04:29.380> the<00:04:29.530> outfit<00:04:29.919> and<00:04:29.950> she<00:04:30.250> kind<00:04:30.490> of

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:30.520 
away from the outfit and she kind of

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.340 
away from the outfit and she kind of
looks<00:04:30.700> like<00:04:30.790> you're<00:04:30.970> trying<00:04:31.150> too<00:04:31.330> hard<00:04:31.360> but
