be squishy so this was the 15 second one
it's<00:02:28.769> not<00:02:29.010> very<00:02:29.370> squishy<00:02:29.640> but<00:02:29.910> it's<00:02:30.030> kind<00:02:30.360> of

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:30.510 
it's not very squishy but it's kind of

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.089 
it's not very squishy but it's kind of
squishy<00:02:31.019> and<00:02:32.330> um<00:02:33.330> I<00:02:33.930> put<00:02:34.410> a<00:02:34.470> face<00:02:34.709> on<00:02:34.860> this<00:02:35.040> one

00:02:35.089 --> 00:02:35.099 
squishy and um I put a face on this one

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:36.559 
squishy and um I put a face on this one
better<00:02:35.430> than<00:02:35.549> put<00:02:35.760> a<00:02:35.790> face<00:02:35.970> on<00:02:36.000> this<00:02:36.209> one<00:02:36.390> yet

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
better than put a face on this one yet

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.979 
better than put a face on this one yet
so<00:02:36.950> but<00:02:37.950> it<00:02:38.430> doesn't<00:02:38.819> crack<00:02:39.180> that<00:02:39.450> much<00:02:39.720> but

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
so but it doesn't crack that much but

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:42.589 
so but it doesn't crack that much but
it's<00:02:40.140> not<00:02:40.319> very<00:02:40.560> squishy<00:02:41.269> so<00:02:42.269> you<00:02:42.420> don't

00:02:42.589 --> 00:02:42.599 
it's not very squishy so you don't

00:02:42.599 --> 00:02:44.120 
it's not very squishy so you don't
really<00:02:42.690> have<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.049> be<00:02:43.170> careful<00:02:43.349> you<00:02:43.709> just<00:02:44.010> have

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
really have to be careful you just have

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.309 
really have to be careful you just have
to<00:02:44.250> be<00:02:44.370> um<00:02:44.670> very<00:02:45.450> careful<00:02:45.900> on<00:02:46.049> this<00:02:46.260> one

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
to be um very careful on this one

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.440 
to be um very careful on this one
because<00:02:47.250> if<00:02:47.430> you<00:02:47.519> squish<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.819> too<00:02:48.090> hard<00:02:48.299> it

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:48.450 
because if you squish it too hard it

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:48.979 
because if you squish it too hard it
cracks

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
cracks

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.060 
cracks
cuz<00:02:49.290> this<00:02:49.500> was<00:02:49.709> the<00:02:50.010> ten-second<00:02:50.760> one<00:02:51.000> and<00:02:52.070> yeah
