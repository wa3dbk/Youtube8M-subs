00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.720
 of course everyone is your case 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.070
 I hope you all go very well 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.170
 we are today for a 

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:24.420
 new video on benfica a new 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.369
 class reviews this time it's 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.200
 the class is supporting so I was trying to 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.400
 take all the weapons to support to 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:31.410
 separate them into two groups well 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:33.960
 distinct so the first group will be 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.550
 long-range weapons or at least 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.690
 medium range and then it will be 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.000
 short-range weapons that have 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:42.360
 really done for shooting about 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.309
 shot really very very close so that 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 some of these weapons 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:47.760
 put on battlefield 3 weapons 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.110
 really to judge it they are 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.330
 currently medium range weapons 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:53.250
 out of 24 so what really does not happen 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:55.650
 proud of the name because the characteristics of 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.420
 these weapons have really changed and you 

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.110
 will be amazed at some weapons that are 

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:59.339
 medium range 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.900
 by the way we will start with this one 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:03.570
 medium and long range weapons 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:06.299
 so the rp quarters 74 m 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:09.420
 at 602 pace and 60 a ball with 61 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.799
 a ball is more likely to believe 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.120
 that it is a weapon of average and 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:14.280
 long range because in general the 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.430
 short-range weapons have a lot of 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 balls so that's a choice it's rather 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.690
 something we expected 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.070
 the m249 on the other hand is classified in the 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.140
 long and medium range also she 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.280
 800 pace and 200 balls in the 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.600
 charger so a lot of people 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.500
 would tend to think they 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.150
 were made for melee 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.470
 but that's wrong she has a very very 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.370
 poor melee effectiveness 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.650
 contrary to what we might think 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:36.330
 and not precise blow to the melee 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.400
 we do not know who says it is the 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.490
 battlelog statistics so on it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.260
 we can finally not refute that then 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.910
 there is the type 88 that was already on 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.610
 battlefield 3 an average weapon for 

00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.690
 bring the 702 to 200 bullets qu'avancer 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.490
 in the loader currently under 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:50.970
 battlefield 4 and remains a weapon of 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:53.310
 medium range 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.600
 the m200 40 country that was really a 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.460
 weapon of very very short door is 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.780
 really done to judge him on 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:59.570
 battlefield 3 is currently rather 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.320
 a medium range weapon 

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:02.100
 difficult to wear because she has 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.540
 still a lot of hindsight 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.890
 so she's still a weapon of 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.800
 mid-range currently saubade actually 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.149
 4 and then the pkp schnegg who she 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.440
 also really says a weapon typically 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.769
 two bodies worn you go there with a 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.090
 laser stuffing on bf3 and you go for it 

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:16.470
 like crazy and there you have a lot 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:18.420
 damage but this time it has 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.390
 really a very very large reach 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.940
 this peach neg 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:25.040
 so really it's a weapon of average 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.740
 reach even long-range until seen 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.470
 her reach she has 6 years of cadence and 

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:31.670
 100 balls in the magazine so the 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.100
 accessories that I advise you 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.440
 really for this weapon and for the 

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.630
 medium and long range weapons 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.580
 it is the compensator the handle 

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:42.470
 collapsible and you can put a laser 

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.780
 if it tempts you the laser does not even offer 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.770
 not very useful by donation since we 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.540
 are not going to do a lot of judging that 

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:49.730
 these armies but you risk doing yourself 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.370
 spot if you are targeting enemies so 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.920
 the compensator and the folding handle 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:55.550
 have the huge advantage of increasing the 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.350
 stability 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.220
 so it will be very effective in the case 

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.630
 where you shoot at medium and long range 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.370
 especially and high speed weapons 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:07.010
 like the m249 or so the type 88 which 

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.360
 have each 800 and 710 cadence and its 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.980
 compensators and this folding handle 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:11.450
 will give you a serious asset 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:13.459
 now to short range weapons 

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:14.780
 like jade show you for weapons 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.000
 long and medium range some of 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.920
 these weapons were on battlefield 3 of 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.600
 typically average weapons or 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:22.370
 long range but are no longer 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.160
 weapons to behave are that very 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.470
 effective at the judge so is there she statue 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:28.790
 is a medium range weapon is 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.590
 now typically huge of course 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:33.709
 worn the very very efficient to the judges 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:37.790
 and 7 centers cadence and 100 balls 

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:40.510
 in the charger the cub and 95 she at 652 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.260
 cadence and 80 a white ball charge 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.820
 it's really a weapon that I am 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:45.500
 advise against standards that I think 

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.250
 it is not effective medium has 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.500
 featured 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:50.550
 in any way is really not 

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.690
 effective so if you have the choice 

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:53.370
 between other support weapons 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.940
 do not hesitate to take more 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.220
 this is the mjc good month one of the weapons 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.810
 the most effective yet brought to the judge 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:03.630
 and she's really really fearsome 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:05.610
 she at 802 pace and 200 balls in the 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:07.110
 charger so she combines both a 

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:08.040
 charger really very big and a 

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.080
 very high rate 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.030
 she has relatively effective damage 

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.680
 and this is for me one of the only weapons 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:16.230
 include to use to judge and who this 

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:18.030
 which is the most effective next 

00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:19.590
 he had 100 m k 5 so you the 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.190
 know all will be all tried during 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.550
 beta was my basic tear of the 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:28.620
 support which does that 590 pace and 

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.370
 46 balls in the magazine so bound 

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.880
 total inefficiency compared to 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.140
 other weapons 

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:36.419
 in case you really shoot 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.160
 very close to effective dadu and you 'll have 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:39.480
 chained trouble that the garden after well 

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.020
 sure if you are excellent you will 

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:42.330
 always chained 

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.890
 then there is the r pk 12 which is a 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:46.110
 weapon anyway pretty interesting that has 

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.880
 six years of kippa cadence that is not 

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:50.160
 very high I agree but who to 

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:51.690
 60 bullets in the magazine and who 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.620
 the advantage is pretty precise do not 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:57.270
 have too much recoil so his lands pk12 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.260
 even 10 to use it at the judge you 

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:00.450
 can always try a can be 

00:04:58.260 --> 00:05:02.220
 interesting even if for me in the 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:05.100
 weapons of what to wear the best and the 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:06.360
 mg 4 maybe this is it you're in 

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:09.600
 the long-range weapons for me 

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:10.830
 this is the m249 where fishing with mostly 

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:12.210
 peace schleck by the way so that's it 

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:14.100
 really the type guns that I you 

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:15.540
 therefore recommend to continue on these 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.530
 short- range weapons what I what 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.479
 I really advise it is to put a 

00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:20.340
 blaze inevitably since do not forget 

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:22.020
 that you take this weapon for you in 

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.850
 serve very closely so you need a 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.180
 laser this would be the most effective and most 

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:26.370
 useful 

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:28.020
 you then need a compensator 

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:29.040
 because anyway stability 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.300
 nobody spits on it 

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.770
 it's always nice to have a 

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.770
 little more even if you are not 

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:36.560
 aim all the time then he will have the 

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.540
 ergo handle the handle argovie really 

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:42.249
 indispensable in the case you want 

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:44.709
 play judged 

00:05:42.249 --> 00:05:46.989
 it's really going to give you the ability 

00:05:44.709 --> 00:05:48.609
 of high shot so here I hope that 

00:05:46.989 --> 00:05:49.989
 I managed to motivate you to play this 

00:05:48.609 --> 00:05:51.099
 support class that I managed you 

00:05:49.989 --> 00:05:52.659
 save time you do not have 

00:05:51.099 --> 00:05:53.979
 tried all the weapons but you 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.109
 can immediately use the 

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:57.669
 best of these weapons and hoping you 

00:05:56.109 --> 00:05:59.319
 will take as much pleasure as me with 

00:05:57.669 --> 00:06:01.779
 this class we find ourselves for a 

00:05:59.319 --> 00:06:03.519
 next video review that will be on the 

00:06:01.779 --> 00:06:05.259
 cup engineers have mostly to the 

00:06:03.519 --> 00:06:07.769
 next time by then frei well 

00:06:05.259 --> 00:06:07.769
 Chubais
