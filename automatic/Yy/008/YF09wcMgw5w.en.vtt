minutes<00:00:36.750> of<00:00:36.989> absorption<00:00:37.649> and<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:38.640> can<00:00:38.790> get

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:39.050 
minutes of absorption and you can get

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.690 
minutes of absorption and you can get
ambushed<00:00:40.050> at<00:00:40.260> any<00:00:40.500> time<00:00:40.800> like<00:00:41.100> this<00:00:41.219> guy<00:00:41.430> tried
