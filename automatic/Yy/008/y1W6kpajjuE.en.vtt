00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
I'll have to do more tests on that

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:03.900 
I'll have to do more tests on that
before<00:04:02.079> I<00:04:02.109> can<00:04:02.440> recommend<00:04:02.799> that<00:04:03.250> so<00:04:03.639> for<00:04:03.819> now

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
before I can recommend that so for now

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.640 
before I can recommend that so for now
I'm<00:04:04.030> just<00:04:04.150> gonna<00:04:04.389> go<00:04:04.480> with<00:04:04.629> blind<00:04:04.930> eye<00:04:05.139> so<00:04:05.590> I

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:05.650 
I'm just gonna go with blind eye so I

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:07.399 
I'm just gonna go with blind eye so I
can<00:04:05.799> stay<00:04:06.099> out<00:04:06.280> of<00:04:06.310> sight<00:04:06.669> from<00:04:06.909> those

00:04:07.399 --> 00:04:07.409 
can stay out of sight from those

00:04:07.409 --> 00:04:11.460 
can stay out of sight from those
automatic<00:04:08.409> air<00:04:08.940> support<00:04:10.019> choppers<00:04:11.019> and<00:04:11.260> and

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
automatic air support choppers and and

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.069 
automatic air support choppers and and
the<00:04:11.859> like<00:04:12.099> in<00:04:12.819> the<00:04:13.060> second<00:04:13.419> slot<00:04:13.569> though<00:04:13.840> you

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:14.079 
the like in the second slot though you

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:15.420 
the like in the second slot though you
can<00:04:14.230> choose<00:04:14.409> either<00:04:14.560> cold-blooded<00:04:15.310> or

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:15.430 
can choose either cold-blooded or

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:17.099 
can choose either cold-blooded or
scavenger<00:04:15.940> if<00:04:16.090> you<00:04:16.359> want<00:04:16.539> to<00:04:16.599> choose<00:04:16.780> the<00:04:16.810> perk

00:04:17.099 --> 00:04:17.109 
scavenger if you want to choose the perk

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.319 
scavenger if you want to choose the perk
to<00:04:17.320> breed<00:04:17.650> I'd<00:04:17.859> probably<00:04:18.130> recommend

00:04:19.319 --> 00:04:19.329 
to breed I'd probably recommend

00:04:19.329 --> 00:04:21.210 
to breed I'd probably recommend
scavenger<00:04:19.870> over<00:04:20.139> cold-blooded<00:04:20.769> since<00:04:20.979> it<00:04:21.069> is

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220 
scavenger over cold-blooded since it is

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.460 
scavenger over cold-blooded since it is
definitely<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.849> lot<00:04:22.180> stronger<00:04:22.629> now<00:04:23.050> in<00:04:23.379> the

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
definitely a lot stronger now in the

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:25.969 
definitely a lot stronger now in the
third<00:04:23.740> slot<00:04:24.039> it's<00:04:24.370> a<00:04:24.460> very<00:04:24.669> interesting<00:04:24.789> slot

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979 
third slot it's a very interesting slot

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:28.649 
third slot it's a very interesting slot
dead<00:04:26.979> silence<00:04:27.250> and<00:04:27.550> awareness<00:04:28.030> I<00:04:28.210> would<00:04:28.449> not

00:04:28.649 --> 00:04:28.659 
dead silence and awareness I would not

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:30.779 
dead silence and awareness I would not
recommend<00:04:28.840> this<00:04:29.319> time<00:04:29.560> around<00:04:29.710> I<00:04:30.129> mean<00:04:30.490> sound

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:30.789 
recommend this time around I mean sound

00:04:30.789 --> 00:04:32.520 
recommend this time around I mean sound
whoring<00:04:31.240> doesn't<00:04:31.569> really<00:04:31.689> happen<00:04:31.900> as<00:04:32.169> much<00:04:32.199> as

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
whoring doesn't really happen as much as

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.770 
whoring doesn't really happen as much as
it<00:04:32.650> did<00:04:32.770> a<00:04:32.830> modern<00:04:33.159> warfare<00:04:33.310> 3<00:04:33.520> so<00:04:34.389> if<00:04:34.629> you

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:34.780 
it did a modern warfare 3 so if you

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:36.749 
it did a modern warfare 3 so if you
don't<00:04:34.900> want<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.199> choose<00:04:35.409> tactical<00:04:36.009> mask<00:04:36.280> I

00:04:36.749 --> 00:04:36.759 
don't want to choose tactical mask I

00:04:36.759 --> 00:04:40.050 
don't want to choose tactical mask I
would<00:04:37.360> choose<00:04:37.870> engineer<00:04:38.800> over<00:04:39.280> dead<00:04:39.520> silence

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:40.060 
would choose engineer over dead silence

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.290 
would choose engineer over dead silence
or<00:04:40.240> awareness<00:04:40.629> now<00:04:41.020> engineer<00:04:41.680> is<00:04:41.939> very<00:04:42.939> strong

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
or awareness now engineer is very strong

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.929 
or awareness now engineer is very strong
in<00:04:43.569> that<00:04:44.229> it<00:04:44.469> delays<00:04:44.830> triggered<00:04:45.280> explosives

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:45.939 
in that it delays triggered explosives

00:04:45.939 --> 00:04:47.369 
in that it delays triggered explosives
and<00:04:46.090> allows<00:04:46.270> you<00:04:46.389> to<00:04:46.509> re-roll<00:04:46.900> those<00:04:47.139> care

00:04:47.369 --> 00:04:47.379 
and allows you to re-roll those care

00:04:47.379 --> 00:04:49.709 
and allows you to re-roll those care
packages<00:04:47.409> and<00:04:48.039> it<00:04:48.129> also<00:04:48.370> shows<00:04:49.000> you<00:04:49.030> enemy

00:04:49.709 --> 00:04:49.719 
packages and it also shows you enemy

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:51.600 
packages and it also shows you enemy
equipment<00:04:49.840> that<00:04:50.379> is<00:04:50.409> placed<00:04:50.830> throughout<00:04:51.340> the

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:51.610 
equipment that is placed throughout the

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:54.570 
equipment that is placed throughout the
world<00:04:51.879> so<00:04:52.659> I<00:04:53.319> choose<00:04:53.770> tactical<00:04:54.190> mask<00:04:54.340> over

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
world so I choose tactical mask over

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:55.680 
world so I choose tactical mask over
engineer<00:04:55.000> because<00:04:55.180> i<00:04:55.360> don't<00:04:55.629> like

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
engineer because i don't like

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:57.899 
engineer because i don't like
concussions<00:04:56.289> or<00:04:56.379> flashes<00:04:56.889> either<00:04:57.219> as<00:04:57.610> well<00:04:57.789> as

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:01.210 
shocked charges but that delays bouncing

my ballistic knife now the ballistic
knife<00:05:35.740> is<00:05:36.219> a<00:05:36.279> very<00:05:36.580> special<00:05:36.819> kind<00:05:37.389> of<00:05:37.599> knife

00:05:37.769 --> 00:05:37.779 
knife is a very special kind of knife

00:05:37.779 --> 00:05:40.379 
knife is a very special kind of knife
since<00:05:38.319> it<00:05:38.440> has<00:05:38.529> a<00:05:38.560> spring-loaded<00:05:39.339> blade<00:05:39.819> that

00:05:40.379 --> 00:05:40.389 
since it has a spring-loaded blade that

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:42.659 
since it has a spring-loaded blade that
actually<00:05:40.900> shoots<00:05:41.319> so<00:05:41.919> it<00:05:42.069> gives<00:05:42.190> you<00:05:42.370> more

00:05:42.659 --> 00:05:42.669 
actually shoots so it gives you more

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
really sure if that's true if it

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.719 
really sure if that's true if it
actually<00:06:17.169> gets<00:06:17.469> more<00:06:17.800> kills<00:06:18.099> and<00:06:18.400> is<00:06:18.490> actually

actually gets more kills and is actually

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.999 
actually gets more kills and is actually
more<00:06:19.029> accurate<00:06:19.139> when<00:06:20.139> you<00:06:20.289> go<00:06:20.529> for<00:06:20.710> the<00:06:20.740> kill

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:21.009 
more accurate when you go for the kill

00:06:21.009 --> 00:06:22.499 
more accurate when you go for the kill
because<00:06:21.219> this<00:06:21.520> knifing<00:06:21.879> system<00:06:22.180> is<00:06:22.330> really

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:16.990 
if you use engineer maybe you can switch

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.570 
if you use engineer maybe you can switch
it<00:07:17.020> and<00:07:17.260> get<00:07:17.380> a<00:07:17.410> knife<00:07:17.590> only<00:07:17.770> option<00:07:18.190> within<00:07:18.370> it

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:20.560 
but I would recommend the UAV counter

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.710 
but I would recommend the UAV counter
UAV<00:07:20.710> and<00:07:21.160> orbital<00:07:21.580> vsat<00:07:21.790> as<00:07:22.210> your<00:07:22.420> scores
