00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:15.179
 yes to those who need to use the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.090
 in major cities around the world. 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:21.270
 world, more and more 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.449
 for the harsh reality of traffic 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.150
 However, it is also a fact that today we have 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.880
 interesting novelties created for 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.800
 make this task less painful and 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.460
 ensure more safety 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.930
 an example the bluetooth system 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:39.570
 tool already present in the 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.329
 automotive sound systems but 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.070
 still not well used by pure 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.829
 lack of information 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:50.399
 one knows no longer have car does not 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.160
 not only do not have installed but know 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.710
 I think it's very good, even if it's good. 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.410
 still do not know do not be alarmed with the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.750
 different name pronounced in English 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:03.539
 bluetooth is nothing more than a 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.790
 technology that allows the connection between 

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:08.340
 electronic equipment without 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.810
 Using cables is very easy 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.880
 You do not even have to take your phone out of your pocket. 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.640
 enters the cell phone in his pocket and 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:17.400
 everything is already talked about the radio but for 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.950
 that the two devices can interact 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.770
 first of all it is necessary to make the call 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.290
 between them, it is very simple to 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.600
 first we make the car audio 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.939
 is detectable then we trigger the 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.270
 bluetooth car second sound 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:37.049
 step is to make the connection on the smartphone 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:40.079
 that people in network configurations without 

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.090
 Bluetooth settings and 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:43.710
 activated the bluetooth of the device was 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.360
 recognized here he will ask you to 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.689
 make the payment 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.280
 So we'll pair and that's the 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.770
 ask again if we wish 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.869
 make connection via bluetooth grip 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.600
 here is five and the device is 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.310
 connected is very fast and easy 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.810
 it's just once every time you 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.030
 get in the car you already have yours 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.750
 completely connected to the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:05.750
 automotive sound 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.590
 Okay but with so many advantages. 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:14.050
 you can not just turn your back 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.990
 for technology bluetooth really 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:19.240
 changed a lot is not a connectivity 

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:21.880
 very cool that you really do not use 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.470
 had a pendrive was four years old 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.360
 There is no more today, there is everything. 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.030
 kept on the shelf of the house and was nothing 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:30.819
 really an important advance that brings 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:33.310
 comfort and practicality more than 

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.680
 also deserves attention 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:38.290
 we gained with this technology when 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.040
 think of driver safety and 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.040
 passenger
