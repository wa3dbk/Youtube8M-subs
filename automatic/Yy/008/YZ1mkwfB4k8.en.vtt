00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
by default the duration of a transition

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.719 
by default the duration of a transition
is<00:01:35.369> set<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.210> two<00:01:36.479> seconds<00:01:37.020> but<00:01:38.010> you<00:01:38.190> can<00:01:38.369> adjust

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
don't want to use a transition just set

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.759 
don't want to use a transition just set
the<00:01:55.259> duration<00:01:55.560> timer<00:01:56.009> to<00:01:56.460> zero
