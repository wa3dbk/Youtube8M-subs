Halloween as I'm walking it's also
starting<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:24.869> rise<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> little<00:01:25.380> bit<00:01:25.740> just

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
starting to rise a little bit just

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.359 
starting to rise a little bit just
because<00:01:27.259> when<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.409> walk<00:01:28.710> in<00:01:28.890> front<00:01:29.100> of<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.280> it

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
because when you walk in front of it it

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.870 
because when you walk in front of it it
makes<00:01:29.520> the<00:01:30.299> fog<00:01:30.600> come<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:31.020> but<00:01:31.700> come<00:01:32.700> around

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
makes the fog come up but come around

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
makes the fog come up but come around
here<00:01:35.570> and<00:01:36.570> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.290> see<00:01:37.560> it<00:01:38.570> laying<00:01:39.570> on<00:01:39.720> the

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
here and you can see it laying on the

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:43.940 
here and you can see it laying on the
ground<00:01:41.659> some<00:01:42.659> of<00:01:42.780> us<00:01:42.869> coming<00:01:43.170> up<00:01:43.409> a<00:01:43.530> little<00:01:43.649> bit

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
ground some of us coming up a little bit

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:45.440 
ground some of us coming up a little bit
but<00:01:44.220> I<00:01:44.310> think<00:01:44.549> that's<00:01:44.729> just<00:01:44.880> because<00:01:45.090> I<00:01:45.360> was

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
fog is still pouring out because the

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.740 
fog is still pouring out because the
cauldrons<00:01:52.829> effect<00:01:53.610> stopped<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:54.299> snap<00:01:54.540> going
