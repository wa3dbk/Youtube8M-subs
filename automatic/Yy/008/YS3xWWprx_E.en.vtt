00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:00.710 
extended mags I really don't think
that's<00:02:59.849> why<00:02:59.970> I<00:03:00.030> don't<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.239> anything

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:00.720 
that's why I don't have anything

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.920 
that's why I don't have anything
actually<00:03:01.019> on<00:03:01.260> it<00:03:01.819> it's<00:03:02.819> just<00:03:02.970> my<00:03:03.090> standard<00:03:03.750> on

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
actually on it it's just my standard on

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.220 
actually on it it's just my standard on
my<00:03:04.500> standard<00:03:04.889> magazine<00:03:05.730> so<00:03:06.420> it<00:03:06.900> still<00:03:07.200> works

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:07.230 
my standard magazine so it still works

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.179 
my standard magazine so it still works
out<00:03:07.530> fine<00:03:07.829> and<00:03:08.370> this<00:03:08.939> gun<00:03:09.409> it's<00:03:10.409> just<00:03:10.530> it<00:03:10.920> seems

00:03:11.179 --> 00:03:11.189 
out fine and this gun it's just it seems

00:03:11.189 --> 00:03:12.589 
out fine and this gun it's just it seems
like<00:03:11.670> you<00:03:11.819> know<00:03:11.909> for<00:03:12.060> some<00:03:12.180> people<00:03:12.209> it<00:03:12.450> seems

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
like you know for some people it seems

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:14.089 
like you know for some people it seems
like<00:03:12.720> a<00:03:12.750> little<00:03:12.930> like<00:03:13.200> another<00:03:13.409> little<00:03:13.769> you

00:03:14.089 --> 00:03:14.099 
like a little like another little you

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:16.550 
like a little like another little you
feel<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.819> something<00:03:15.090> like<00:03:15.209> that<00:03:15.269> and<00:03:15.750> it

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
feel or something like that and it

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.319 
feel or something like that and it
actually<00:03:17.040> doesn't<00:03:17.310> feel<00:03:17.669> like<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:18.000> at<00:03:18.030> all

00:03:18.319 --> 00:03:18.329 
actually doesn't feel like that at all

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:19.159 
actually doesn't feel like that at all
to<00:03:18.720> me

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
to me

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.170 
to me
I<00:03:19.199> don't<00:03:20.010> even<00:03:20.190> put<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.340> silencer<00:03:20.549> on<00:03:20.790> this<00:03:20.970> gun

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
I don't even put a silencer on this gun

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.360 
I don't even put a silencer on this gun
I<00:03:21.449> just<00:03:22.049> wanna<00:03:22.230> you<00:03:22.349> know<00:03:22.379> try<00:03:22.590> to<00:03:22.620> get<00:03:22.829> try<00:03:23.250> it

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
I just wanna you know try to get try it

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.819 
I just wanna you know try to get try it
out<00:03:23.489> so<00:03:23.639> I<00:03:23.699> never<00:03:23.819> put<00:03:24.090> in<00:03:24.180> a<00:03:24.209> silencer<00:03:24.660> but<00:03:24.840> it

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:25.829 
out so I never put in a silencer but it

00:03:25.829 --> 00:03:28.159 
out so I never put in a silencer but it
you<00:03:26.280> know<00:03:26.400> even<00:03:27.180> if<00:03:27.269> it<00:03:27.389> looks<00:03:27.690> like<00:03:27.870> the<00:03:28.079> you

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
you know even if it looks like the you

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:29.869 
you know even if it looks like the you
feel<00:03:28.349> it<00:03:28.590> just<00:03:28.829> somewhat<00:03:29.310> if<00:03:29.459> it<00:03:29.579> looks<00:03:29.730> like

00:03:29.869 --> 00:03:29.879 
feel it just somewhat if it looks like

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.479 
feel it just somewhat if it looks like
it<00:03:30.000> doesn't<00:03:30.599> mean<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.810> it<00:03:31.129> performs<00:03:32.129> as<00:03:32.280> well

00:03:32.479 --> 00:03:32.489 
it doesn't mean that it performs as well

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:34.250 
it doesn't mean that it performs as well
as<00:03:32.609> it<00:03:32.730> because<00:03:32.970> it<00:03:33.510> actually<00:03:33.659> says<00:03:33.959> this<00:03:34.049> gun

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
as it because it actually says this gun

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.860 
as it because it actually says this gun
handles<00:03:34.650> I<00:03:34.859> gotta<00:03:35.519> say<00:03:35.699> I'm<00:03:35.879> I'm<00:03:36.269> gonna<00:03:36.659> have

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:36.870 
handles I gotta say I'm I'm gonna have

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.360 
handles I gotta say I'm I'm gonna have
to<00:03:37.019> say<00:03:37.139> it<00:03:37.260> probably<00:03:37.409> handles<00:03:37.859> better<00:03:38.190> than

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
to say it probably handles better than

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.140 
to say it probably handles better than
the<00:03:38.639> you<00:03:38.790> fiea<00:03:39.090> on<00:03:39.299> in<00:03:40.260> terms<00:03:41.220> of<00:03:41.370> damage

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:42.150 
the you fiea on in terms of damage

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:43.699 
the you fiea on in terms of damage
I<00:03:42.180> think<00:03:42.780> I'm<00:03:42.930> not<00:03:43.079> too<00:03:43.229> sure<00:03:43.379> about<00:03:43.409> that<00:03:43.650> I

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:43.709 
I think I'm not too sure about that I

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:45.319 
I think I'm not too sure about that I
think<00:03:43.769> this<00:03:44.040> gun<00:03:44.190> on<00:03:44.519> has<00:03:44.970> a<00:03:45.000> little<00:03:45.209> more

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
think this gun on has a little more

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:48.259 
think this gun on has a little more
damage<00:03:45.540> but<00:03:46.530> it's<00:03:47.310> still<00:03:47.459> a<00:03:47.519> really<00:03:47.970> good<00:03:48.090> gun

00:03:48.259 --> 00:03:48.269 
damage but it's still a really good gun

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:50.449 
damage but it's still a really good gun
you<00:03:48.750> know<00:03:48.840> you<00:03:48.930> can<00:03:49.079> really<00:03:49.319> fast<00:03:49.650> it<00:03:50.129> has

00:03:50.449 --> 00:03:50.459 
you know you can really fast it has

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:52.129 
you know you can really fast it has
pretty<00:03:50.940> good<00:03:51.090> range<00:03:51.329> you<00:03:51.780> know<00:03:51.870> you're<00:03:52.079> not

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
pretty good range you know you're not

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:53.990 
pretty good range you know you're not
gonna<00:03:52.260> get<00:03:52.440> rained<00:03:52.680> you<00:03:52.949> know<00:03:53.099> you<00:03:53.849> know<00:03:53.970> like

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:54.000 
gonna get rained you know you know like

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.430 
gonna get rained you know you know like
across<00:03:54.479> the<00:03:54.720> map<00:03:54.870> you<00:03:54.959> can<00:03:55.019> probably<00:03:55.260> get

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
across the map you can probably get

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.869 
across the map you can probably get
range<00:03:55.650> it<00:03:55.739> would<00:03:55.859> be<00:03:55.979> like<00:03:56.159> like<00:03:56.400> if<00:03:56.609> you<00:03:56.729> see

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
range it would be like like if you see

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:58.099 
range it would be like like if you see
you<00:03:56.970> got<00:03:57.120> in<00:03:57.180> front<00:03:57.329> of<00:03:57.419> you<00:03:57.479> maybe<00:03:57.629> like<00:03:57.810> five

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
you got in front of you maybe like five

00:03:58.109 --> 00:03:59.270 
you got in front of you maybe like five
feet<00:03:58.409> or<00:03:58.530> wear<00:03:58.650> like<00:03:58.829> ten<00:03:58.979> feet<00:03:59.129> you<00:03:59.190> can

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
feet or wear like ten feet you can

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.969 
feet or wear like ten feet you can
probably<00:03:59.430> get<00:03:59.609> them<00:03:59.699> like<00:03:59.819> that<00:03:59.970> but<00:04:00.900> on<00:04:01.229> you

00:04:01.969 --> 00:04:01.979 
probably get them like that but on you

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:03.860 
probably get them like that but on you
know<00:04:02.069> I<00:04:02.099> really<00:04:02.609> don't<00:04:02.849> see<00:04:02.940> any<00:04:03.269> much<00:04:03.510> recoil

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 
know I really don't see any much recoil

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.920 
know I really don't see any much recoil
in<00:04:03.989> this<00:04:04.109> gun<00:04:04.290> at<00:04:04.440> all<00:04:04.650> I<00:04:04.680> do<00:04:04.979> have<00:04:05.220> a<00:04:05.549> I<00:04:06.150> do<00:04:06.690> have

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
in this gun at all I do have a I do have

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.020 
in this gun at all I do have a I do have
a<00:04:06.989> grit<00:04:07.290> but<00:04:07.500> still<00:04:07.769> the<00:04:08.099> recoil<00:04:08.609> doesn't<00:04:08.849> seem

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.030 
a grit but still the recoil doesn't seem

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:11.449 
a grit but still the recoil doesn't seem
at<00:04:09.239> all<00:04:09.510> it<00:04:10.379> seems<00:04:10.650> like<00:04:10.799> there's<00:04:10.949> there<00:04:11.220> is<00:04:11.250> no

00:04:11.449 --> 00:04:11.459 
at all it seems like there's there is no

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.180 
at all it seems like there's there is no
recoil<00:04:11.790> really<00:04:12.150> um<00:04:12.680> so<00:04:13.680> it's<00:04:13.799> really<00:04:13.979> awesome

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 
recoil really um so it's really awesome

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.729 
recoil really um so it's really awesome
and<00:04:14.609> you<00:04:15.479> know<00:04:15.510> not<00:04:15.720> many<00:04:16.229> people<00:04:16.530> use<00:04:16.650> this

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
and you know not many people use this

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.930 
and you know not many people use this
gun<00:04:16.889> because<00:04:17.070> it<00:04:17.190> does<00:04:17.340> cost<00:04:17.549> a<00:04:17.639> lot<00:04:17.789> so<00:04:17.880> you

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
gun because it does cost a lot so you

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.310 
gun because it does cost a lot so you
guys<00:04:18.060> gotta<00:04:18.239> save<00:04:18.570> up<00:04:18.599> your<00:04:18.750> tokens<00:04:19.199> and

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:36.690 
one I really like so I decided to

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.600 
one I really like so I decided to
precision<00:04:37.110> what<00:04:37.259> really<00:04:37.770> came<00:04:38.039> good<00:04:38.370> out<00:04:38.460> of

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
precision what really came good out of

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.570 
precision what really came good out of
that<00:04:38.759> was<00:04:39.690> that<00:04:39.960> when<00:04:40.560> I<00:04:40.590> went<00:04:40.830> in<00:04:40.949> ahead<00:04:41.250> and

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
that was that when I went in ahead and

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.249 
that was that when I went in ahead and
went<00:04:42.570> in<00:04:42.660> the<00:04:42.720> game

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:43.259 
went in the game

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:46.159 
went in the game
I<00:04:43.289> actually<00:04:43.800> went<00:04:44.160> with<00:04:44.310> no<00:04:44.669> perks<00:04:45.330> at<00:04:45.539> all<00:04:45.690> so

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
I actually went with no perks at all so

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.409 
I actually went with no perks at all so
it<00:04:46.229> was<00:04:46.320> just<00:04:46.590> the<00:04:46.770> gun<00:04:46.949> itself<00:04:47.460> so<00:04:48.090> in<00:04:48.330> this

00:04:48.409 --> 00:04:48.419 
it was just the gun itself so in this

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:49.909 
it was just the gun itself so in this
