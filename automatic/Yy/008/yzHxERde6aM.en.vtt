and the other knob is a different kind
of<00:00:56.810> pitch<00:00:56.990> bin<00:00:57.200> it's<00:00:57.380> like<00:00:57.470> a<00:00:57.500> almost<00:00:58.310> like

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
of pitch bin it's like a almost like

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.610 
of pitch bin it's like a almost like
kind<00:00:58.700> of<00:00:58.760> like<00:00:58.880> sequence<00:00:59.390> sound<00:00:59.750> which<00:01:00.530> you

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
like a distorted oscillation kind of

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:45.240 
like a distorted oscillation kind of
sound<00:01:42.990> and<00:01:43.990> when<00:01:44.259> you<00:01:44.350> run<00:01:44.530> all<00:01:44.890> three
