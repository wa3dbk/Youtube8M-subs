disliking<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.840> actually<00:00:28.230> feel<00:00:28.619> like<00:00:28.830> this<00:00:29.010> is

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
disliking I actually feel like this is

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.769 
disliking I actually feel like this is
probably<00:00:29.340> one<00:00:29.580> of<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.730> most<00:00:29.880> brilliant<00:00:30.300> skill

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:30.779 
probably one of the most brilliant skill

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:34.069 
probably one of the most brilliant skill
swaps<00:00:31.050> you<00:00:31.500> can<00:00:31.710> use<00:00:32.189> onto<00:00:33.059> slaking<00:00:33.329> right

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
swaps you can use onto slaking right

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.270 
swaps you can use onto slaking right
there<00:00:34.380> so<00:00:35.309> now<00:00:35.850> we<00:00:35.910> have<00:00:36.270> xatu<00:00:37.079> that<00:00:37.710> has<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
there so now we have xatu that has the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.450 
there so now we have xatu that has the
truant<00:00:38.760> ability<00:00:40.010> slinking<00:00:41.010> doesn't<00:00:41.340> have

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
truant ability slinking doesn't have

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.190 
truant ability slinking doesn't have
that<00:00:41.579> n<00:00:41.760> he<00:00:42.030> has<00:00:42.149> magic<00:00:42.510> bounce<00:00:42.690> which<00:00:42.960> means

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
that n he has magic bounce which means

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.900 
that n he has magic bounce which means
he's<00:00:43.410> not<00:00:43.710> going<00:00:44.070> to<00:00:44.100> get<00:00:44.309> status<00:00:46.250> so<00:00:47.250> sylveon

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
he's not going to get status so sylveon

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.420 
he's not going to get status so sylveon
in<00:00:48.300> all<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:48.989> confusion<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:49.739> tries<00:00:50.399> to

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
in all the confusion of this tries to

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.770 
in all the confusion of this tries to
you<00:00:51.300> know<00:00:51.329> y'all<00:00:51.690> and<00:00:51.870> slaking<00:00:52.280> however<00:00:53.780> it

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
you know y'all and slaking however it

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.810 
you know y'all and slaking however it
gets<00:00:55.530> magic<00:00:55.860> bounce<00:00:56.039> back<00:00:56.250> because<00:00:56.550> you<00:00:56.699> know

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
gets magic bounce back because you know

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.979 
gets magic bounce back because you know
they<00:00:56.969> pony<00:00:57.180> didn't<00:00:57.390> know<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.539> was<00:00:57.600> going<00:00:57.780> on

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
they pony didn't know what was going on

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.220 
they pony didn't know what was going on
and<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.800> would<00:00:59.100> imagine<00:00:59.340> that<00:00:59.789> if<00:01:00.239> xatu

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
and I would imagine that if xatu

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:03.650 
and I would imagine that if xatu
survives<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:01.920> true<00:01:02.100> reveal<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.940> true<00:01:03.210> on<00:01:03.390> hub

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
survives the true reveal the true on hub

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.469 
survives the true reveal the true on hub
turn<00:01:04.530> with<00:01:05.280> his<00:01:05.489> lay<00:01:05.670> him<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.030> being<00:01:06.180> able<00:01:06.330> to
