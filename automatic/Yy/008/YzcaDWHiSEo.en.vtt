to<00:00:29.000> have<00:00:29.150> as<00:00:29.300> much<00:00:29.450> fun<00:00:29.509> with<00:00:29.899> it<00:00:29.930> as<00:00:30.110> I<00:00:30.290> did<00:00:30.590> it

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
to have as much fun with it as I did it

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:32.830 
to have as much fun with it as I did it
just<00:00:31.640> when<00:00:31.849> I<00:00:31.880> was<00:00:32.060> playing<00:00:32.329> around<00:00:32.540> with<00:00:32.689> the

just when I was playing around with the
move<00:00:32.989> set<00:00:33.230> out<00:00:33.410> in<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.649> air<00:00:33.739> it<00:00:33.890> seemed<00:00:34.130> to<00:00:34.340> be

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:34.370 
move set out in the air it seemed to be

a<00:00:34.489> little<00:00:34.730> bit<00:00:34.850> bland<00:00:35.300> and<00:00:35.660> boring<00:00:35.720> seconds<00:00:36.620> or

00:00:36.729 --> 00:00:36.739 
a little bit bland and boring seconds or

00:00:36.739 --> 00:00:38.799 
a little bit bland and boring seconds or
twos<00:00:36.980> of<00:00:37.130> course<00:00:37.370> with<00:00:37.640> that<00:00:37.790> fiery<00:00:38.030> explosion

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809

some<00:01:55.030> other<00:01:55.119> numbers<00:01:55.450> and<00:01:55.570> it<00:01:55.630> ends<00:01:55.840> up<00:01:55.900> being

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
some other numbers and it ends up being

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.429 
some other numbers and it ends up being
to<00:01:56.970> 568<00:01:57.970> with<00:01:58.270> the<00:01:58.420> ring<00:01:58.540> employees<00:01:58.810> plus<00:01:58.990> 2<00:01:59.229> as

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
to 568 with the ring employees plus 2 as

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:01.770 
to 568 with the ring employees plus 2 as
I've<00:01:59.619> said<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.640> has<00:02:00.880> a<00:02:00.909> counter<00:02:01.299> strength<00:02:01.600> of

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:01.780 
I've said it has a counter strength of

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.680 
I've said it has a counter strength of
100<00:02:02.049> poise<00:02:02.770> damage<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.310> 60<00:02:03.880> and<00:02:04.090> this<00:02:04.509> is

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:04.690 
100 poise damage of 60 and this is

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:06.149 
100 poise damage of 60 and this is
actually<00:02:05.049> the<00:02:05.140> heaviest<00:02:05.409> weapon<00:02:05.740> I've<00:02:05.860> used

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:06.159 
actually the heaviest weapon I've used

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:08.040 
actually the heaviest weapon I've used
up<00:02:06.310> until<00:02:06.670> this<00:02:06.759> point<00:02:07.000> it<00:02:07.240> weighs<00:02:07.450> a<00:02:07.479> total<00:02:07.960> of

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
up until this point it weighs a total of

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.430 
up until this point it weighs a total of
24<00:02:08.619> units<00:02:09.009> so<00:02:09.610> I<00:02:09.640> actually<00:02:09.940> had<00:02:10.420> to<00:02:10.630> put<00:02:10.660> on<00:02:11.050> the

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
24 units so I actually had to put on the

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.800 
24 units so I actually had to put on the
Royal<00:02:11.770> soldiers<00:02:12.250> ring<00:02:12.550> to<00:02:12.910> use<00:02:13.360> this<00:02:13.569> thing

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
Royal soldiers ring to use this thing

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.110 
Royal soldiers ring to use this thing
and<00:02:14.050> still<00:02:14.380> move<00:02:14.650> at<00:02:14.770> a<00:02:14.830> decent<00:02:15.069> speed<00:02:15.250> so<00:02:15.910> the

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
and still move at a decent speed so the

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.580 
and still move at a decent speed so the
weight<00:02:16.300> is<00:02:16.330> something<00:02:16.780> that<00:02:17.110> you<00:02:17.260> definitely

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
weight is something that you definitely

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.830 
weight is something that you definitely
need<00:02:18.130> to<00:02:18.160> keep<00:02:18.550> in<00:02:18.670> mind<00:02:18.880> if<00:02:19.120> you<00:02:19.300> plan<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.720> use

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
need to keep in mind if you plan to use

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.590 
need to keep in mind if you plan to use
this<00:02:20.230> thing<00:02:20.560> and<00:02:20.860> you<00:02:21.640> know<00:02:21.760> that<00:02:22.150> leads<00:02:22.360> me<00:02:22.569> to

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:22.600 
this thing and you know that leads me to

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.780 
this thing and you know that leads me to
the<00:02:22.870> biggest<00:02:23.350> pros<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:23.860> cons<00:02:24.069> now<00:02:24.730> the

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:24.790 
the biggest pros and cons now the

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.160 
the biggest pros and cons now the
biggest<00:02:25.030> pro<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> the<00:02:25.510> weapon<00:02:25.840> I<00:02:25.959> would

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
biggest pro of the weapon I would

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.110 
biggest pro of the weapon I would
definitely<00:02:26.590> have<00:02:26.620> to<00:02:26.739> say<00:02:26.860> is<00:02:27.280> the<00:02:27.700> fact<00:02:27.940> that

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:28.120 
definitely have to say is the fact that

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.479 
definitely have to say is the fact that
you<00:02:28.330> can<00:02:28.480> came<00:02:28.690> into<00:02:28.870> tax<00:02:29.200> after<00:02:29.769> you<00:02:30.190> pressed

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
you can came into tax after you pressed

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.030 
you can came into tax after you pressed
r1<00:02:30.700> now<00:02:31.480> I<00:02:31.510> was<00:02:31.930> complaining<00:02:32.260> about<00:02:32.440> that<00:02:32.769> when

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:33.040 
r1 now I was complaining about that when

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.220 
r1 now I was complaining about that when
I<00:02:33.069> was<00:02:33.280> using<00:02:33.519> the<00:02:34.030> pursuers<00:02:34.750> ultra<00:02:35.019> great

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
I was using the pursuers ultra great

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.009 
I was using the pursuers ultra great
sword<00:02:35.470> and<00:02:35.650> that's<00:02:36.069> because<00:02:36.400> its<00:02:36.670> attacks

00:02:37.009 --> 00:02:37.019 
sword and that's because its attacks

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.080 
sword and that's because its attacks
there<00:02:38.019> they're<00:02:38.620> just<00:02:38.950> a<00:02:39.100> straight<00:02:39.459> down<00:02:39.640> chop

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
there they're just a straight down chop

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.320 
there they're just a straight down chop
like<00:02:40.690> sort<00:02:41.050> of<00:02:41.080> like<00:02:41.200> that<00:02:41.350> but<00:02:41.620> faster<00:02:42.330> now

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:43.330 
like sort of like that but faster now

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.979 
like sort of like that but faster now
with<00:02:43.660> this

00:02:43.979 --> 00:02:43.989 
with this

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:46.380 
with this
it's<00:02:44.110> our<00:02:44.470> ones<00:02:44.769> when<00:02:45.160> two-handed<00:02:45.700> they<00:02:46.120> swing

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
it's our ones when two-handed they swing

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.449 
it's our ones when two-handed they swing
horizontally<00:02:47.019> so<00:02:47.799> the<00:02:47.890> fact<00:02:48.069> that<00:02:48.220> you<00:02:48.310> can

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
horizontally so the fact that you can

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.380 
horizontally so the fact that you can
aim<00:02:48.700> after<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:50.110> do<00:02:50.470> that<00:02:50.799> makes<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.910> very<00:02:52.209> easy

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
aim after you do that makes it very easy

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.170 
aim after you do that makes it very easy
to<00:02:52.810> catch<00:02:53.019> an<00:02:53.110> opponent<00:02:53.200> off<00:02:53.650> guard<00:02:53.680> and<00:02:54.220> if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
to catch an opponent off guard and if

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:56.550 
to catch an opponent off guard and if
they're<00:02:55.330> trying<00:02:55.569> to<00:02:55.600> roll<00:02:55.810> around<00:02:55.900> you<00:02:56.200> they

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
they're trying to roll around you they

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.140 
they're trying to roll around you they
really<00:02:57.100> don't<00:02:57.310> have<00:02:57.430> much<00:02:57.760> of<00:02:57.790> a<00:02:57.940> chance

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
really don't have much of a chance

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:00.270 
really don't have much of a chance
unless<00:02:58.330> they're<00:02:58.660> out<00:02:58.810> of<00:02:58.840> your<00:02:59.110> reach<00:02:59.440> now

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:00.280 
unless they're out of your reach now

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.069 
unless they're out of your reach now
that<00:03:00.519> being<00:03:00.700> said<00:03:00.790> the<00:03:01.180> biggest<00:03:01.360> con<00:03:01.750> of<00:03:01.959> this

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:02.079 
that being said the biggest con of this

00:03:02.079 --> 00:03:03.870 
that being said the biggest con of this
weapon<00:03:02.260> I<00:03:02.620> would<00:03:03.130> have<00:03:03.220> to<00:03:03.340> say<00:03:03.489> is<00:03:03.640> not<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880 
weapon I would have to say is not the

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.000 
weapon I would have to say is not the
fact<00:03:04.269> that<00:03:04.420> it<00:03:04.600> requires<00:03:04.930> 50<00:03:05.410> strength<00:03:05.739> or

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
fact that it requires 50 strength or

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.009 
fact that it requires 50 strength or
weighs<00:03:06.370> 24<00:03:06.910> units<00:03:07.269> both<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.600> those<00:03:07.720> are

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
weighs 24 units both of those are

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.770 
weighs 24 units both of those are
significant<00:03:08.769> cons<00:03:09.269> but<00:03:10.269> I<00:03:10.299> would<00:03:10.450> have<00:03:10.540> to<00:03:10.630> say

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:10.780 
significant cons but I would have to say

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:12.539 
significant cons but I would have to say
that<00:03:10.810> the<00:03:11.019> biggest<00:03:11.230> con<00:03:11.560> would<00:03:12.070> be<00:03:12.190> the<00:03:12.310> fact

00:03:12.539 --> 00:03:12.549 
that the biggest con would be the fact

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.210 
that the biggest con would be the fact
that<00:03:12.880> it<00:03:13.150> has<00:03:13.329> such<00:03:13.810> short<00:03:13.989> reach<00:03:14.290> in<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> fight

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.220 
that it has such short reach in a fight

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:16.650 
that it has such short reach in a fight
later<00:03:15.400> on<00:03:15.640> you'll<00:03:15.880> see<00:03:15.910> me<00:03:16.120> fighting<00:03:16.329> against

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:16.660 
later on you'll see me fighting against

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.150 
later on you'll see me fighting against
someone<00:03:16.989> who's<00:03:17.170> using<00:03:17.380> a<00:03:17.530> large<00:03:17.739> Club<00:03:18.040> I

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
someone who's using a large Club I

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:20.370 
someone who's using a large Club I
believe<00:03:18.459> it<00:03:18.519> is<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.850> you<00:03:19.420> can<00:03:19.600> really<00:03:19.870> see<00:03:20.200> the

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
believe it is and you can really see the

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:21.930 
believe it is and you can really see the
difference<00:03:20.769> in<00:03:20.920> the<00:03:21.010> reach<00:03:21.220> for<00:03:21.579> yourself

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
difference in the reach for yourself

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:24.120 
difference in the reach for yourself
then<00:03:22.150> because<00:03:22.959> they're<00:03:23.290> both<00:03:23.530> weapons<00:03:23.769> in<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:24.130 
then because they're both weapons in the

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:27.449 
then because they're both weapons in the
same<00:03:24.310> class<00:03:24.609> but<00:03:25.030> the<00:03:25.959> reach<00:03:26.170> difference<00:03:26.680> the

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459 
same class but the reach difference the

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:28.740 
same class but the reach difference the
length<00:03:27.700> of<00:03:27.880> the<00:03:27.970> weapon<00:03:28.090> it's<00:03:28.450> just

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:28.750 
length of the weapon it's just

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.479 
length of the weapon it's just
completely<00:03:29.140> different<00:03:29.560> you<00:03:29.950> I<00:03:30.220> mean

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
completely different you I mean

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.190 
completely different you I mean
obviously<00:03:30.670> it's<00:03:31.120> it's<00:03:31.420> completely<00:03:31.959> different

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:32.200 
obviously it's it's completely different

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.449 
obviously it's it's completely different
weapons<00:03:32.470> other<00:03:32.590> reason<00:03:33.010> the<00:03:33.130> length<00:03:33.310> is

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
weapons other reason the length is

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.550 
weapons other reason the length is
different<00:03:33.700> but<00:03:34.140> you<00:03:35.140> know<00:03:35.260> what<00:03:35.350> I'm<00:03:35.440> trying

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:35.560 
different but you know what I'm trying

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.160 
different but you know what I'm trying
to<00:03:35.680> say<00:03:35.890> it's<00:03:36.239> really<00:03:37.239> a<00:03:37.269> significant

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
to say it's really a significant

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.199 
to say it's really a significant
difference<00:03:38.620> and<00:03:38.890> you<00:03:39.130> can<00:03:39.280> really<00:03:39.609> see<00:03:39.940> it<00:03:40.060> in

00:03:40.199 --> 00:03:40.209 
difference and you can really see it in

00:03:40.209 --> 00:03:43.890 
difference and you can really see it in
that<00:03:40.600> fight<00:03:40.870> so<00:03:41.880> being<00:03:42.880> able<00:03:43.000> to<00:03:43.150> trade<00:03:43.750> hits

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
that fight so being able to trade hits

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.479 
that fight so being able to trade hits
with<00:03:44.049> your<00:03:44.260> opponent<00:03:44.620> really<00:03:44.920> is<00:03:45.010> not<00:03:45.190> always

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
with your opponent really is not always

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:47.340 
with your opponent really is not always
possible<00:03:45.700> because<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.540> short<00:03:46.870> reach<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.200> this

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:47.350 
possible because the short reach of this

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:49.289 
possible because the short reach of this
weapon<00:03:47.709> now<00:03:48.370> I<00:03:48.400> mean<00:03:48.609> it's<00:03:48.760> not<00:03:48.880> like<00:03:49.000> a<00:03:49.090> BHEL

00:03:49.289 --> 00:03:49.299 
weapon now I mean it's not like a BHEL

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.870 
weapon now I mean it's not like a BHEL
axe<00:03:49.540> or<00:03:49.690> anything<00:03:49.870> with<00:03:50.200> the<00:03:50.350> reach<00:03:50.530> but<00:03:50.880> as

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
axe or anything with the reach but as

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.300 
axe or anything with the reach but as
far<00:03:52.120> as<00:03:52.150> the<00:03:52.620> weapons<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:53.799> class<00:03:54.100> are

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
far as the weapons and class are

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.099 
far as the weapons and class are
concerned<00:03:54.670> I<00:03:54.910> do<00:03:55.030> believe<00:03:55.450> this<00:03:55.569> one<00:03:55.750> has<00:03:55.870> the

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
concerned I do believe this one has the

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:57.960 
concerned I do believe this one has the
shortest<00:03:56.470> reach<00:03:56.680> right<00:03:57.400> here<00:03:57.579> this<00:03:57.730> is<00:03:57.790> the

00:03:57.960 --> 00:03:57.970 
shortest reach right here this is the

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:00.360 
shortest reach right here this is the
fight<00:03:58.150> I<00:03:58.180> was<00:03:58.359> talking<00:03:58.660> about<00:03:58.720> so<00:03:59.230> I<00:03:59.440> also<00:04:00.040> had

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:02.340 
fight I was talking about so I also had
a<00:04:00.400> really<00:04:00.760> hard<00:04:00.910> time<00:04:01.000> in<00:04:01.180> this<00:04:01.420> fight<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.660> was<00:04:02.140> I

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
a really hard time in this fight I was I

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.740 
a really hard time in this fight I was I
was<00:04:02.590> just<00:04:02.769> not<00:04:02.889> doing<00:04:03.370> good<00:04:03.609> at<00:04:03.729> all<00:04:03.910> I<00:04:04.180> just

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
was just not doing good at all I just

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
was just not doing good at all I just
got<00:04:04.989> combo

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:05.770 
got combo

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:08.730

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:08.740 
and just fail to dodge I had to come

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.220 
and just fail to dodge I had to come
back<00:04:08.890> going<00:04:09.250> right<00:04:09.490> around<00:04:09.670> here<00:04:10.000> but<00:04:10.660> it<00:04:10.960> got

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:11.230 
back going right around here but it got

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:13.470 
back going right around here but it got

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:13.480 
cut short by a ring which I really don't

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:16.920 
cut short by a ring which I really don't
care<00:04:13.750> for<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.010> you<00:04:15.460> know<00:04:15.550> it<00:04:16.390> is<00:04:16.420> what<00:04:16.720> it<00:04:16.810> is

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:16.930 
care for so you know it is what it is

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.640 
care for so you know it is what it is
but<00:04:17.320> whatever<00:04:18.120> so<00:04:19.120> overall<00:04:19.780> this<00:04:20.230> is<00:04:20.290> a<00:04:20.440> fun

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:20.650 
but whatever so overall this is a fun

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.500 
but whatever so overall this is a fun
weapon<00:04:20.980> I<00:04:21.160> really<00:04:21.459> did<00:04:21.670> enjoy<00:04:21.790> using<00:04:22.270> this

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
weapon I really did enjoy using this

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:25.590 
weapon I really did enjoy using this
thing<00:04:22.720> a<00:04:22.780> lot<00:04:23.700> some<00:04:24.700> other<00:04:24.880> things<00:04:25.210> about<00:04:25.360> the

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
thing a lot some other things about the

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.000 
thing a lot some other things about the
weapon<00:04:25.870> that<00:04:25.900> I<00:04:26.080> feel<00:04:26.500> are<00:04:26.650> worth<00:04:26.800> mentioning

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:27.010 
weapon that I feel are worth mentioning

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.760 
weapon that I feel are worth mentioning
you<00:04:27.460> can<00:04:27.610> use<00:04:27.820> six<00:04:28.180> of<00:04:28.330> its<00:04:28.390> Artoo's<00:04:28.840> before

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
you can use six of its Artoo's before

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:31.080 
you can use six of its Artoo's before
the<00:04:29.860> weapon<00:04:30.010> will<00:04:30.280> break<00:04:30.550> unless<00:04:30.940> you're

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:31.090 
the weapon will break unless you're

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:32.580 
the weapon will break unless you're
wearing<00:04:31.210> a<00:04:31.420> bracing<00:04:31.780> knuckle<00:04:32.050> ring<00:04:32.230> of<00:04:32.350> course

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:32.590 
wearing a bracing knuckle ring of course

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:34.800 
wearing a bracing knuckle ring of course
and<00:04:32.800> then<00:04:32.890> I<00:04:32.920> believe<00:04:33.370> it's<00:04:33.550> ten<00:04:33.940> and<00:04:34.390> that

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
and then I believe it's ten and that

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.360 
and then I believe it's ten and that
seems<00:04:35.020> to<00:04:35.170> be<00:04:35.260> pretty<00:04:35.500> much<00:04:35.680> like<00:04:35.860> a<00:04:35.890> standard

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:36.370 
seems to be pretty much like a standard

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:38.550 
seems to be pretty much like a standard
thing<00:04:36.610> six<00:04:36.940> are<00:04:37.090> to<00:04:37.270> war<00:04:37.690> breaks<00:04:37.990> right<00:04:38.320> there

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:38.560 
thing six are to war breaks right there

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.500 
thing six are to war breaks right there
managed<00:04:39.400> to<00:04:39.520> get<00:04:39.640> out<00:04:39.760> of<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.940> way<00:04:40.060> of<00:04:40.330> my

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:40.510 
managed to get out of the way of my

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:43.470 
managed to get out of the way of my
hammer<00:04:41.170> itself<00:04:41.710> but<00:04:42.010> not<00:04:42.250> the<00:04:42.340> fire<00:04:42.520> so<00:04:43.180> that's

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.480 
hammer itself but not the fire so that's

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.000 
hammer itself but not the fire so that's
pretty<00:04:43.660> cool<00:04:43.870> it's<00:04:44.140> nice<00:04:44.290> being<00:04:44.530> able<00:04:44.710> to<00:04:44.830> kill

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
pretty cool it's nice being able to kill

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.610 
pretty cool it's nice being able to kill
someone<00:04:45.220> with<00:04:45.550> the<00:04:45.940> AoE<00:04:46.360> fire<00:04:46.840> from<00:04:47.350> the

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:47.620 
someone with the AoE fire from the

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:51.210 
someone with the AoE fire from the
weapon<00:04:48.480> really<00:04:49.480> though<00:04:49.750> overall<00:04:50.200> this<00:04:50.920> weapon

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:51.220 
weapon really though overall this weapon

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.210 
weapon really though overall this weapon
is<00:04:51.310> pretty<00:04:51.550> straightforward<00:04:51.850> and<00:04:52.330> I<00:04:53.020> am<00:04:53.590> a<00:04:53.980> bit

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
is pretty straightforward and I am a bit

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.220 
is pretty straightforward and I am a bit
scared<00:04:54.490> to<00:04:54.850> see<00:04:55.120> how<00:04:55.360> much<00:04:55.510> damage<00:04:55.810> it<00:04:56.140> would

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:56.230 
scared to see how much damage it would

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:59.490 
scared to see how much damage it would
really<00:04:56.500> do<00:04:56.920> if<00:04:57.730> I<00:04:58.090> had<00:04:58.510> taken<00:04:58.900> advantage<00:04:59.110> of

really do if I had taken advantage of

really do if I had taken advantage of

that see scaling and fire because as I

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:03.570 
that see scaling and fire because as I
said<00:05:02.530> in<00:05:02.620> the<00:05:02.680> beginning<00:05:02.770> of<00:05:03.040> the<00:05:03.130> video<00:05:03.220> guys

doing<00:05:13.180> this<00:05:13.300> good<00:05:13.480> damage<00:05:13.780> a<00:05:14.400> bit<00:05:15.400> scary<00:05:15.670> to

00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:15.730 
doing this good damage a bit scary to

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.150 
doing this good damage a bit scary to
think<00:05:16.000> of<00:05:16.150> so<00:05:17.050> that's<00:05:17.770> something<00:05:18.040> you<00:05:18.130> should

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.160 
think of so that's something you should

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:20.010 
think of so that's something you should
keep<00:05:18.370> in<00:05:18.520> mind<00:05:18.550> if<00:05:18.910> you<00:05:19.030> do<00:05:19.210> plan<00:05:19.450> on<00:05:19.480> using<00:05:19.600> it

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
keep in mind if you do plan on using it

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.060 
keep in mind if you do plan on using it
you<00:05:20.470> don't<00:05:20.680> necessarily<00:05:20.860> need<00:05:21.840> the<00:05:22.840> fire

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
you don't necessarily need the fire

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.470 
you don't necessarily need the fire
scaling<00:05:24.070> to<00:05:24.610> be<00:05:24.730> something<00:05:25.300> you<00:05:25.360> take

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:25.480 
scaling to be something you take

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.150 
scaling to be something you take
advantage<00:05:25.750> of<00:05:26.020> for<00:05:26.290> it<00:05:26.410> to<00:05:26.470> be<00:05:26.590> a<00:05:26.620> viable

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:27.160 
advantage of for it to be a viable

00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:29.520 
advantage of for it to be a viable
weapon<00:05:27.370> for<00:05:27.760> you<00:05:27.850> use<00:05:28.090> so<00:05:28.930> that's<00:05:29.140> interesting

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:29.530 
weapon for you use so that's interesting

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.050 
weapon for you use so that's interesting
and<00:05:29.950> really<00:05:30.130> goes<00:05:30.280> to<00:05:30.310> show<00:05:30.430> that<00:05:30.580> scaling

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
and really goes to show that scaling

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:32.580 
and really goes to show that scaling
probably<00:05:31.660> doesn't<00:05:31.870> really<00:05:31.960> mean<00:05:32.260> too<00:05:32.440> much

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:32.590 
probably doesn't really mean too much

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:34.350 
probably doesn't really mean too much
from<00:05:32.920> what<00:05:33.220> we<00:05:33.400> can<00:05:33.640> see<00:05:33.820> so<00:05:34.060> far

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
from what we can see so far

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.390 
from what we can see so far
I<00:05:34.540> mean<00:05:35.200> I've<00:05:35.350> noticed<00:05:35.710> it<00:05:35.800> myself<00:05:35.920> that

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:36.400 
I mean I've noticed it myself that

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:37.740 
I mean I've noticed it myself that
scaling<00:05:36.700> doesn't<00:05:37.060> really<00:05:37.210> mean<00:05:37.420> too<00:05:37.600> much

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:37.750 
scaling doesn't really mean too much

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:39.900 
scaling doesn't really mean too much
with<00:05:38.050> the<00:05:38.200> weapons<00:05:38.590> in<00:05:38.740> this<00:05:38.950> game<00:05:39.040> that<00:05:39.760> as

00:05:39.900 --> 00:05:39.910 
with the weapons in this game that as

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:41.040 
with the weapons in this game that as
far<00:05:40.150> as<00:05:40.300> you<00:05:40.450> know<00:05:40.540> comparing<00:05:40.930> them<00:05:41.020> to

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.050 
far as you know comparing them to

00:05:41.050 --> 00:05:43.950 
far as you know comparing them to
previous<00:05:41.680> games<00:05:41.860> but<00:05:42.340> anyway<00:05:43.090> I'm<00:05:43.300> getting<00:05:43.810> a

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:43.960 
previous games but anyway I'm getting a

00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:46.230 
previous games but anyway I'm getting a

00:05:46.230 --> 00:05:46.240 
bit distracted this is the last fight

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.520 
bit distracted this is the last fight

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:47.530 
very fitting
