Hello, Let's show another tip of Windows 8:

I will access the menu Charm

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.230
Move the mouse cursor to the right side of the screen

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.530
Place the mouse cursor at the top right and scroll
the cursor up and down to access the menu Charm

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.270
Click "Settings"

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:28.590

the eyes and a row on the mouth

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.570
