way we've got the facilities for mass
producing<00:05:57.979> hardware<00:05:58.369> on<00:05:58.489> that<00:05:58.669> scale<00:05:58.969> and

00:05:59.139 --> 00:05:59.149 
producing hardware on that scale and

00:05:59.149 --> 00:06:00.850 
producing hardware on that scale and
here<00:05:59.449> I<00:05:59.479> was<00:05:59.629> thinking<00:05:59.899> you<00:06:00.499> could<00:06:00.529> build

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
scale I'm gonna figure it out don't you

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:08.379 
scale I'm gonna figure it out don't you
worry<00:06:06.860> and<00:06:07.309> I'll<00:06:07.519> come<00:06:07.699> up<00:06:07.729> with<00:06:07.909> something<00:06:08.029> a
