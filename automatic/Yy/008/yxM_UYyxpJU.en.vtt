with<00:00:13.889> the<00:00:13.950> alien<00:00:14.690> these<00:00:15.690> Warriors<00:00:16.560> are<00:00:16.590> here

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
with the alien these Warriors are here

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:25.550 
with the alien these Warriors are here
are<00:00:18.050> my<00:00:19.050> number<00:00:19.770> input<00:00:21.260> name<00:00:22.260> run<00:00:22.680> to<00:00:23.960> the<00:00:24.960> may

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
are my number input name run to the may

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.720 
are my number input name run to the may
register<00:00:25.859> which<00:00:27.740> shows<00:00:28.740> number<00:00:29.250> obviously<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:31.730 
register which shows number obviously I

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:34.639 
register which shows number obviously I
and<00:00:32.730> then<00:00:32.850> that<00:00:33.030> goes<00:00:33.300> into<00:00:33.690> the<00:00:33.899> alien<00:00:34.350> I'll

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
and then that goes into the alien I'll

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.500 
and then that goes into the alien I'll
follow<00:00:35.130> got<00:00:35.700> fired<00:00:37.489> all<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.969> I<00:00:39.000> can<00:00:39.329> get

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
follow got fired all right I can get

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.490 
follow got fired all right I can get
three<00:00:40.250> have<00:00:41.250> this<00:00:41.460> terrible<00:00:41.820> lag<00:00:43.670> having<00:00:44.670> fun

three have this terrible lag having fun
and<00:00:46.500> now<00:00:47.309> this<00:00:47.940> wire<00:00:48.270> on<00:00:48.450> a<00:00:48.539> lot<00:00:48.750> is<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.260> rough

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
and now this wire on a lot is a rough

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.799 
and now this wire on a lot is a rough
surf<00:00:49.770> bar<00:00:50.219> on<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.550> right<00:00:50.579> is<00:00:50.910> an<00:00:51.149> e<00:00:51.300> register

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:51.809 
surf bar on the right is an e register

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:57.049 
surf bar on the right is an e register
which<00:00:52.559> comes<00:00:53.010> from<00:00:53.370> up<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:55.280> now<00:00:56.280> let's<00:00:56.760> say

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
which comes from up there now let's say

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.049 
which comes from up there now let's say
I<00:00:57.090> follow<00:00:57.510> adding<00:00:58.370> it<00:00:59.370> goes<00:00:59.640> into<00:00:59.940> this

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
I follow adding it goes into this

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:07.149 
I follow adding it goes into this
bladder<00:01:02.420> and<00:01:05.659> right<00:01:06.659> here<00:01:06.900> the<00:01:07.080> output

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
bladder and right here the output

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.750 
bladder and right here the output
there's<00:01:08.159> Carrie<00:01:09.680> and<00:01:10.680> then<00:01:10.860> it<00:01:11.010> gets<00:01:11.159> ended

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
there's Carrie and then it gets ended

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.810 
there's Carrie and then it gets ended
with<00:01:12.060> this<00:01:12.270> slut<00:01:12.630> supplier<00:01:14.540> and<00:01:16.220> then<00:01:17.220> it<00:01:17.430> goes

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
with this slut supplier and then it goes

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:24.170 
with this slut supplier and then it goes
up<00:01:18.210> into<00:01:18.540> this<00:01:18.750> top<00:01:19.020> liar<00:01:22.369> you<00:01:23.369> later<00:01:23.790> on<00:01:24.000> this

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
up into this top liar you later on this

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:32.060 
up into this top liar you later on this
back<00:01:24.509> into<00:01:25.259> the<00:01:25.830> being<00:01:26.640> registered<00:01:29.540> and<00:01:30.860> the<00:01:31.860> B

complicated<00:01:52.700> soft-sided<00:01:55.399> video<00:01:56.399> would<00:01:56.610> be

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
complicated soft-sided video would be

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.590 
complicated soft-sided video would be
too<00:01:56.939> long<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.270> five<00:01:57.479> explain<00:01:59.869> and

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
too long the five explain and

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.370 
too long the five explain and
comes<00:02:03.320> all<00:02:03.619> the<00:02:03.650> way<00:02:03.860> over<00:02:04.640> to<00:02:04.810> 12<00:02:05.810> actually<00:02:06.350> I

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
comes all the way over to 12 actually I

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.919 
comes all the way over to 12 actually I
am<00:02:06.560> going<00:02:07.130> to<00:02:07.400> sleep<00:02:07.970> right<00:02:08.240> now<00:02:08.450> because<00:02:08.810> it's

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:08.929 
am going to sleep right now because it's

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:31.210 
am going to sleep right now because it's
getting<00:02:09.259> dark<00:02:09.530> out<00:02:27.370> okay<00:02:28.690> over<00:02:29.690> here<00:02:29.720> it<00:02:30.220> comes

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:31.220 
getting dark out okay over here it comes

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:37.420 
getting dark out okay over here it comes
down<00:02:31.720> now<00:02:32.720> you<00:02:32.780> mess<00:02:33.560> up<00:02:33.739> here<00:02:34.959> the<00:02:35.959> be<00:02:36.650> bus

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
down now you mess up here the be bus

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:43.479 
down now you mess up here the be bus
right<00:02:38.000> here<00:02:39.010> and<00:02:40.010> goes<00:02:40.459> into<00:02:41.269> the<00:02:41.720> spiral<00:02:42.489> that

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
right here and goes into the spiral that

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:48.220 
right here and goes into the spiral that
goes<00:02:44.450> into<00:02:44.900> all<00:02:45.800> of<00:02:45.860> the<00:02:46.580> inputs<00:02:46.819> of<00:02:47.180> all<00:02:47.750> of

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
goes into all of the inputs of all of

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.470 
goes into all of the inputs of all of
the<00:02:48.470> members<00:02:50.260> and<00:02:51.550> how<00:02:52.550> it<00:02:52.610> works<00:02:52.910> so<00:02:53.180> it

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
the members and how it works so it

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.390 
the members and how it works so it
doesn't<00:02:53.840> write<00:02:54.019> to<00:02:54.140> every<00:02:54.350> single<00:02:54.650> one<00:02:54.830> you

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:55.400 
doesn't write to every single one you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:58.630 
doesn't write to every single one you
have<00:02:55.519> to<00:02:55.700> select<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.360> team<00:02:57.230> right<00:02:57.560> to<00:02:57.769> it<00:02:57.920> if

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:58.640 
have to select it team right to it if

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.180 
have to select it team right to it if
you<00:02:58.880> select<00:02:59.209> it<00:02:59.690> since<00:03:00.110> this<00:03:00.230> is<00:03:00.470> the<00:03:00.500> selector

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
you select it since this is the selector

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.940 
you select it since this is the selector
torch<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.640> says<00:03:01.880> this<00:03:02.090> is<00:03:02.239> glutted<00:03:02.950> there's

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
torch that says this is glutted there's

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.449 
torch that says this is glutted there's
a<00:03:04.040> lot<00:03:04.250> of<00:03:04.280> them<00:03:04.519> um<00:03:05.500> it<00:03:06.500> automatically<00:03:07.100> reads

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
a lot of them um it automatically reads

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.210 
a lot of them um it automatically reads
it<00:03:07.640> if<00:03:07.760> you<00:03:07.880> select<00:03:08.180> it<00:03:08.470> but<00:03:09.470> if<00:03:09.739> you<00:03:09.799> want<00:03:10.130> to

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
it if you select it but if you want to

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:13.810 
it if you select it but if you want to
write<00:03:10.430> to<00:03:10.730> it<00:03:10.910> then<00:03:11.480> you<00:03:11.870> have<00:03:12.110> to<00:03:12.440> use<00:03:13.250> an<00:03:13.489> end

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
write to it then you have to use an end

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:17.250 
write to it then you have to use an end
gate<00:03:14.060> right<00:03:14.239> here<00:03:14.299> that<00:03:14.900> ends<00:03:15.320> it<00:03:15.440> with<00:03:16.130> this

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:17.260 
gate right here that ends it with this

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.840 
gate right here that ends it with this
spiral<00:03:18.260> like<00:03:18.620> here<00:03:19.010> so<00:03:19.549> that<00:03:19.760> wire<00:03:20.560> and<00:03:21.850> that's

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:22.850 
spiral like here so that wire and that's

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.530 
spiral like here so that wire and that's
like<00:03:23.299> you're<00:03:23.810> right<00:03:24.410> wire<00:03:25.160> that<00:03:25.880> commands

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
like you're right wire that commands

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:35.050 
like you're right wire that commands
well<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.320> am<00:03:27.769> too<00:03:28.010> white<00:03:28.840> so<00:03:31.120> what's<00:03:32.120> that<00:03:34.060> and

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060 
well I am too white so what's that and

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:39.130 
well I am too white so what's that and
it's<00:03:35.900> just<00:03:36.370> complete<00:03:37.370> repetition<00:03:38.269> every

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:39.140 
it's just complete repetition every

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:41.289 
it's just complete repetition every
single<00:03:39.350> rain<00:03:39.709> bank<00:03:39.980> except<00:03:40.430> grandmother's<00:03:41.090> do

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
single rain bank except grandmother's do

single rain bank except grandmother's do
since<00:03:41.690> I<00:03:41.840> had<00:03:41.989> to<00:03:42.230> look<00:03:42.859> this<00:03:43.250> little<00:03:43.640> workshop

00:03:44.729 --> 00:03:44.739 
since I had to look this little workshop

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:49.710 
since I had to look this little workshop
to<00:03:45.739> take<00:03:46.160> our<00:03:46.609> markets<00:03:47.120> Nero<00:03:47.590> over<00:03:48.590> to<00:03:48.829> my

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:49.720 
to take our markets Nero over to my

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:54.970 
to take our markets Nero over to my
command<00:03:50.720> lee<00:03:52.720> hunger<00:03:53.720> me<00:03:53.900> not<00:03:54.109> everything<00:03:54.620> the

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
command lee hunger me not everything the

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:58.660 
command lee hunger me not everything the
same<00:03:55.540> it<00:03:56.540> look<00:03:56.780> eats<00:03:56.989> every<00:03:57.410> four<00:03:57.440> layers<00:03:57.890> so

00:03:58.660 --> 00:03:58.670 
same it look eats every four layers so

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.150 
same it look eats every four layers so
right<00:03:58.910> there's<00:03:59.150> one<00:03:59.709> human<00:04:00.709> right<00:04:00.829> there<00:04:01.040> is

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
right there's one human right there is

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.920 
right there's one human right there is
one<00:04:01.370> I<00:04:01.579> think<00:04:01.730> it's<00:04:02.030> pretty<00:04:02.209> compact<00:04:02.660> it's

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
one I think it's pretty compact it's

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.199 
one I think it's pretty compact it's
full<00:04:03.230> wide<00:04:03.500> and<00:04:03.859> one<00:04:04.040> seven<00:04:04.790> or<00:04:04.850> eight<00:04:04.970> long

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
full wide and one seven or eight long

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.349 
full wide and one seven or eight long
run<00:04:05.540> rupture<00:04:06.079> I<00:04:07.390> have<00:04:08.390> a<00:04:08.420> stack<00:04:08.810> of<00:04:08.840> eight<00:04:09.290> and

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:10.359 
run rupture I have a stack of eight and

00:04:10.359 --> 00:04:15.110 
run rupture I have a stack of eight and
then<00:04:11.359> over<00:04:12.320> there<00:04:12.500> is<00:04:12.620> not<00:04:12.859> a<00:04:12.889> sack<00:04:13.220> of<00:04:13.250> eight

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
then over there is not a sack of eight

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.190 
then over there is not a sack of eight
pretty<00:04:16.120> high<00:04:17.520> except<00:04:18.520> I<00:04:18.670> can<00:04:18.880> still<00:04:19.120> go<00:04:19.300> on<00:04:19.600> to

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
pretty high except I can still go on to

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.930 
pretty high except I can still go on to
a<00:04:20.230> four<00:04:20.500> hundred<00:04:20.709> that<00:04:21.040> I<00:04:21.100> wanna<00:04:21.370> get<00:04:21.610> to<00:04:21.820> be

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
a four hundred that I wanna get to be

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:29.870 
a four hundred that I wanna get to be
even<00:04:22.390> eight<00:04:24.870> and<00:04:25.870> so<00:04:26.410> there's<00:04:26.770> the<00:04:27.160> RAM<00:04:28.470> um

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
even eight and so there's the RAM um

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:44.160 
even eight and so there's the RAM um
let's<00:04:30.880> go<00:04:31.060> to<00:04:31.330> the<00:04:31.570> program<00:04:32.050> counter<00:04:32.230> now<00:04:43.170> okay

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.170 
let's go to the program counter now okay

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.590 
let's go to the program counter now okay
right<00:04:44.740> here's<00:04:45.010> my<00:04:45.220> fuck<00:04:45.460> that<00:04:45.880> pulsing<00:04:46.480> is

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
right here's my fuck that pulsing is

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.820 
right here's my fuck that pulsing is
ever<00:04:46.810> so<00:04:47.080> often<00:04:47.320> and<00:04:48.420> it<00:04:49.420> comes<00:04:49.780> over<00:04:50.350> this

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:50.830 
ever so often and it comes over this

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.430 
ever so often and it comes over this
actually<00:04:51.400> don't<00:04:52.270> yell<00:04:52.510> Nate<00:04:52.720> this<00:04:52.960> actually

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
actually don't yell Nate this actually

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.290 
actually don't yell Nate this actually
works<00:04:53.710> because<00:04:54.430> right<00:04:54.700> now<00:04:54.730> it's<00:04:55.150> being

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:55.300 
works because right now it's being

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:59.550 
works because right now it's being
powered<00:04:55.630> by<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:57.090> which<00:04:58.090> ends<00:04:58.390> but<00:04:58.810> when<00:04:59.410> it's

00:04:59.550 --> 00:04:59.560 
powered by that which ends but when it's

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:01.230 
powered by that which ends but when it's
running<00:04:59.770> it<00:05:00.070> gets<00:05:00.100> proud<00:05:00.550> about<00:05:00.670> that<00:05:00.850> I

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:01.240 
running it gets proud about that I

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:04.640 
running it gets proud about that I
actually<00:05:01.600> designed<00:05:02.200> it<00:05:02.380> so<00:05:02.560> it<00:05:02.590> ends<00:05:02.950> there

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:04.650 
actually designed it so it ends there

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:09.390 
actually designed it so it ends there
and<00:05:05.820> this<00:05:06.820> runs<00:05:07.150> into<00:05:07.570> a<00:05:07.600> series<00:05:08.470> of<00:05:08.800> T

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
and this runs into a series of T

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:12.480 
and this runs into a series of T
