00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:10.560
 hello if you want to learn how to do this 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:14.580
 little bottle to leave your boyfriend or some 

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:16.320
 friend keep watching this video 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.640
 and so good and material that we are going to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.290
 need is a jar of these more or 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.210
 less so can be bigger or more 

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.920
 small scissors glue a down 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.090
 colored sheets of which you 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:35.570
 I want to use a piece of cloth 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.280
 and a rope 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:40.670
 Well, the first thing we are going to do is 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:44.360
 take our leaves and our scissors 

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.920
 and we are going to cut like that several strips 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.920
 It can be the size that you 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.380
 and then since we have our 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.510
 strips we will write in each 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.940
 paper what we want can 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.870
 be for example 10 reasons why what 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:05.910
 you love or you can put this little piece of paper 1 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.950
 and you write write a letter but 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:10.590
 divide it into the pieces of paper and you can 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.690
 put here just put a number for 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.220
 that he knows in what order 

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:19.370
 things so 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:22.430
 or things that we still have to do together 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.730
 things like that and well I'm going to start 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:24.730
 write 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:35.240
 and since we have our little papers 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.240
 written what we are going to do is 

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.240
 fold them 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:43.409
 since we have it like this all folded it 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:49.170
 what we are going to do is take our 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:49.170
 flask and we are going to put them 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.670
 and I'm going to put a few 

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:58.510
 stars to make it look a little or 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.200
 much later 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.430
 well I'm going to stir 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:03.430
 it was up to a fingernail 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.330
 you can also put some candy 

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:16.850
 along with the little things things so 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.360
 be creative about what they put 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.360
 want 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.990
 and then let's close it 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:32.480
 and we're going to leave it for one thing I'm going to 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.480
 drink 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.620
 a little of this fabric and I'm going to cut a 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:42.870
 as a square more or less that can 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:42.870
 stay here on top of the jar 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.730
 and well here I cut it and I do not stay 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.739
 very similar but I wanted it to stay 

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:58.189
 as well as that redondito 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:03:00.319
 and I'm going to put it over and I'm going to 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:02.659
 take my 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.260
 of the kitten can be a ribbon what 

00:03:02.659 --> 00:03:05.260
 you want 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.150
 we raise 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:29.950
 what I think 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:33.400
 because he needs 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:33.400
 is a heart 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:45.910
 or 

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:45.910
 and heart 

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.790
 Quick 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.290
