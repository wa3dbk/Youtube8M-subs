uphill<00:00:48.660> I<00:00:48.930> mean<00:00:49.079> you<00:00:49.170> feel<00:00:49.320> it<00:00:49.469> immediately

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
uphill I mean you feel it immediately

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:52.189

that when you push off on this gate it

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:53.869 
that when you push off on this gate it
transmits<00:00:52.770> that<00:00:52.920> energy<00:00:53.309> directly<00:00:53.640> to<00:00:53.789> the

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
transmits that energy directly to the

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.220 
transmits that energy directly to the
wheels<00:00:54.059> for<00:00:54.600> sure<00:00:54.750> and<00:00:54.930> that<00:00:55.020> great

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
and then talking about it as an urban

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.330 
and then talking about it as an urban
skate<00:01:15.930> the<00:01:16.229> kind<00:01:16.409> of<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.619> go<00:01:16.799> anywhere<00:01:17.159> do

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
skate the kind of that go anywhere do

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.890 
skate the kind of that go anywhere do
anything<00:01:17.490> type<00:01:17.729> of<00:01:18.000> skate<00:01:18.240> what<00:01:18.450> really<00:01:18.570> helps

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
anything type of skate what really helps

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.630 
anything type of skate what really helps
there<00:01:19.080> is<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.409> the<00:01:19.740> frame<00:01:20.040> length<00:01:20.310> on<00:01:20.520> this

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
there is the the frame length on this

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.580 
there is the the frame length on this
skate<00:01:20.880> right<00:01:21.090> yeah<00:01:21.540> so<00:01:21.750> this<00:01:21.900> is<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> you<00:01:22.530> know

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
skate right yeah so this is a you know

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.190 
skate right yeah so this is a you know
480<00:01:23.070> millimeter<00:01:23.520> wheels<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.360> 243

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:25.200 
480 millimeter wheels and a 243

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.200 
480 millimeter wheels and a 243
millimeter<00:01:25.740> hot<00:01:25.979> rod<00:01:26.189> frame<00:01:26.549> so<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.939> frame<00:01:27.180> is

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
millimeter hot rod frame so the frame is

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.060 
millimeter hot rod frame so the frame is
shorter<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.320> is<00:01:28.380> gonna<00:01:28.500> make<00:01:28.650> this<00:01:28.860> skate

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
shorter so this is gonna make this skate

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:31.039 
shorter so this is gonna make this skate
really<00:01:29.400> maneuverable<00:01:29.880> easy<00:01:30.390> to<00:01:30.600> turn<00:01:30.780> like

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
really maneuverable easy to turn like

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.899 
really maneuverable easy to turn like
that<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.950> it's<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:32.189> quick

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that so it's very quick

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.999 
that so it's very quick
you'd<00:01:33.119> say<00:01:33.390> definitely<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.619> then<00:01:34.740> talking

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
you'd say definitely and then talking

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.620 
you'd say definitely and then talking
about<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.369> wheels<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.670> little<00:01:35.700> bit<00:01:35.850> -<00:01:36.090> a<00:01:36.119> little

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
about the wheels a little bit - a little

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.050 
about the wheels a little bit - a little
different<00:01:37.350> profile<00:01:37.799> here<00:01:38.280> than<00:01:38.700> what<00:01:38.909> you're

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
different profile here than what you're

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.660 
different profile here than what you're
getting<00:01:39.540> in<00:01:39.960> say<00:01:40.380> like<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> macro<00:01:40.920> blade<00:01:41.280> they

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
getting in say like a macro blade they

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.370 
getting in say like a macro blade they
are<00:01:41.820> these<00:01:42.000> are<00:01:42.060> supreme<00:01:42.630> wheels<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.320> a

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
are these are supreme wheels so it's a

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:45.260 
are these are supreme wheels so it's a
high<00:01:43.530> rebound<00:01:43.799> high<00:01:44.250> performance<00:01:44.759> wheel<00:01:44.939> and
