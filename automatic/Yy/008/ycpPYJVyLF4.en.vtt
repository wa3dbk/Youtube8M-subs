00:00:02.270 --> 00:00:02.280 
the US Geological Survey has done a

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.180 
the US Geological Survey has done a
study<00:00:02.610> into<00:00:03.389> fecal<00:00:03.990> matter<00:00:04.200> human<00:00:04.799> fecal

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
study into fecal matter human fecal

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:06.980 
study into fecal matter human fecal
matter<00:00:05.370> raw<00:00:05.700> sewage<00:00:06.089> and<00:00:06.420> whether<00:00:06.720> or<00:00:06.899> not

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:06.990 
matter raw sewage and whether or not

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:10.009 
matter raw sewage and whether or not
that<00:00:07.890> raw<00:00:08.160> sewage<00:00:08.460> can<00:00:08.820> become<00:00:09.210> profitable

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
that raw sewage can become profitable

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.310 
that raw sewage can become profitable
now<00:00:10.740> it's<00:00:11.099> profitable<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.300> a<00:00:12.389> very<00:00:12.690> unexpected

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
now it's profitable in a very unexpected

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.890 
now it's profitable in a very unexpected
way<00:00:13.910> apparently<00:00:14.910> there<00:00:15.150> are<00:00:15.179> precious<00:00:15.570> metals

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
way apparently there are precious metals

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.560 
way apparently there are precious metals
in<00:00:16.049> our<00:00:16.170> poo<00:00:16.410> and<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:17.609> researchers<00:00:18.210> want<00:00:18.480> to

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
in our poo and the researchers want to

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.130 
in our poo and the researchers want to
extract<00:00:19.439> those<00:00:19.830> precious<00:00:20.279> metals<00:00:20.670> and

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.140 
extract those precious metals and

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:24.769 
extract those precious metals and
possibly<00:00:22.140> use<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.279> as<00:00:23.490> profit<00:00:24.060> so<00:00:24.449> let<00:00:24.689> me

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
possibly use them as profit so let me

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.970 
possibly use them as profit so let me
give<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.019> an<00:00:25.109> example<00:00:25.230> of<00:00:25.650> this<00:00:25.769> it's

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
give you an example of this it's

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.160 
give you an example of this it's
absolutely<00:00:26.220> insane<00:00:26.930> according<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.050> an

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
and silver so you consume these precious

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.139 
and silver so you consume these precious
metals<00:00:52.980> oftentimes<00:00:53.699> unwittingly<00:00:54.329> they<00:00:55.110> are

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
metals oftentimes unwittingly they are

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.150 
metals oftentimes unwittingly they are
you<00:00:57.149> know<00:00:57.320> taken<00:00:58.320> out<00:00:58.410> of<00:00:58.530> your<00:00:58.649> body<00:00:58.829> by<00:00:59.100> the

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
you know taken out of your body by the

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.400 
you know taken out of your body by the
national<00:00:59.579> natural<00:01:00.000> process<00:01:00.719> yes<00:01:01.140> and<00:01:01.289> then

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
national natural process yes and then

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.560 
national natural process yes and then
they<00:01:01.530> end<00:01:01.739> up<00:01:02.010> in<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.520> sewage<00:01:02.820> systems<00:01:03.270> and

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
they end up in the sewage systems and

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.800 
they end up in the sewage systems and
also<00:01:04.379> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:04.920> of<00:01:05.040> people<00:01:05.280> lose<00:01:05.489> jewelry<00:01:06.180> when

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
also a lot of people lose jewelry when

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.359 
also a lot of people lose jewelry when
they<00:01:06.930> accidentally<00:01:07.710> throw<00:01:08.070> it<00:01:08.189> down<00:01:08.340> the

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
they accidentally throw it down the

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.300 
they accidentally throw it down the
drain<00:01:08.700> okay<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> so<00:01:10.260> they're<00:01:10.710> thinking<00:01:10.740> the

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
drain okay and so they're thinking the

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:12.620 
drain okay and so they're thinking the
researchers<00:01:11.790> in<00:01:11.909> this<00:01:12.000> case<00:01:12.180> are<00:01:12.330> thinking

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
researchers in this case are thinking

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:13.730 
researchers in this case are thinking
why<00:01:12.900> are<00:01:12.990> we<00:01:13.110> just<00:01:13.260> gonna<00:01:13.320> leave<00:01:13.560> these

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
why are we just gonna leave these

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.679 
why are we just gonna leave these
precious<00:01:13.979> metals<00:01:14.280> behind<00:01:14.880> why<00:01:15.270> don't<00:01:15.450> we<00:01:15.509> find

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
precious metals behind why don't we find

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.830 
precious metals behind why don't we find
a<00:01:15.810> way<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.930> extract<00:01:16.229> them<00:01:16.619> previous<00:01:17.610> research

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:17.840 
a way to extract them previous research

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.940 
a way to extract them previous research
estimated<00:01:18.840> the<00:01:18.960> waste<00:01:19.200> from<00:01:19.470> 1<00:01:19.680> million

this is amazing because you know there's
the<00:01:53.310> oldest<00:01:54.000> science<00:01:54.990> was<00:01:55.740> alchemy<00:01:56.399> where

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
the oldest science was alchemy where

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.910 
the oldest science was alchemy where
they<00:01:56.790> try<00:01:56.969> to<00:01:57.030> turn<00:01:57.500> non-precious<00:01:58.500> metals

00:01:58.910 --> 00:01:58.920

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.370 
they try to turn non-precious metals
into<00:01:59.040> precious<00:01:59.130> metals<00:01:59.850> take<00:02:00.450> a<00:02:00.659> metal<00:02:01.170> that

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
into precious metals take a metal that

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:02.690 
into precious metals take a metal that
isn't<00:02:01.649> worth<00:02:01.740> that<00:02:01.799> much<00:02:02.100> in<00:02:02.250> turn<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.610> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
isn't worth that much in turn in the

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.539 
isn't worth that much in turn in the
gold<00:02:02.909> little<00:02:03.899> did<00:02:04.079> they<00:02:04.229> know<00:02:04.259> they<00:02:05.219> actually

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
gold little did they know they actually

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.429 
gold little did they know they actually
could<00:02:05.759> turn<00:02:06.000> shit<00:02:06.540> into<00:02:06.810> gold

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
could turn shit into gold

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:10.400 
could turn shit into gold
we<00:02:08.009> have<00:02:08.220> mastered<00:02:08.970> the<00:02:09.539> greatest<00:02:09.989> form<00:02:10.289> of

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
we have mastered the greatest form of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.430 
we have mastered the greatest form of
alchemy<00:02:10.860> so<00:02:11.790> here's<00:02:12.239> the<00:02:12.390> question

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:13.440 
alchemy so here's the question

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.610 
alchemy so here's the question
they're<00:02:13.710> a<00:02:14.220> good<00:02:15.090> way<00:02:15.360> an<00:02:15.600> efficient<00:02:16.170> way<00:02:16.320> to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
they're a good way an efficient way to

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.770 
they're a good way an efficient way to
extract<00:02:17.490> the<00:02:17.610> precious<00:02:17.970> metals<00:02:18.330> from<00:02:18.570> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
extract the precious metals from the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.370 
extract the precious metals from the
human<00:02:19.050> waste<00:02:19.260> and<00:02:19.560> also<00:02:20.570> aside<00:02:21.570> from<00:02:21.900> the

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
human waste and also aside from the

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.450 
human waste and also aside from the
precious<00:02:22.740> metals<00:02:23.070> that<00:02:23.190> you'll<00:02:23.310> obtain

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
precious metals that you'll obtain

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:26.120 
precious metals that you'll obtain
through<00:02:23.940> doing<00:02:24.360> this<00:02:24.530> there's<00:02:25.530> another<00:02:25.770> great

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.130 
through doing this there's another great

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:29.270 
through doing this there's another great
upside<00:02:26.430> to<00:02:27.210> it<00:02:27.240> you<00:02:27.960> will<00:02:28.080> be<00:02:28.230> able<00:02:28.590> to<00:02:28.770> use<00:02:29.040> the

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:29.280 
upside to it you will be able to use the

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:31.520 
upside to it you will be able to use the
human<00:02:29.520> waste<00:02:29.850> as<00:02:30.150> fertilizer<00:02:30.210> and<00:02:31.200> it<00:02:31.320> won't

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
human waste as fertilizer and it won't

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.110 
human waste as fertilizer and it won't
be<00:02:31.680> harmful<00:02:31.950> to<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.280> environment<00:02:32.400> because

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
be harmful to the environment because

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.630 
be harmful to the environment because
the<00:02:33.240> metals<00:02:33.540> and<00:02:33.810> sometimes<00:02:34.440> hurt<00:02:35.400> whatever

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
the metals and sometimes hurt whatever

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.940 
the metals and sometimes hurt whatever
you've<00:02:35.970> put<00:02:36.210> the<00:02:36.330> fertilizer<00:02:36.510> in<00:02:37.110> so<00:02:37.740> it's<00:02:37.860> a

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
you've put the fertilizer in so it's a

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.560 
you've put the fertilizer in so it's a
win-win<00:02:38.370> for<00:02:38.400> everybody<00:02:38.850> the<00:02:39.120> question<00:02:39.480> is

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:39.570 
win-win for everybody the question is

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:40.730 
win-win for everybody the question is
can<00:02:39.690> you<00:02:39.750> do<00:02:39.930> it<00:02:39.960> efficiently<00:02:40.440> enough

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:40.740 
can you do it efficiently enough

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:42.260 
can you do it efficiently enough
obviously<00:02:41.250> you've<00:02:41.550> got<00:02:41.670> to<00:02:41.730> do<00:02:41.820> it<00:02:41.910> on<00:02:42.000> a<00:02:42.030> mass

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
obviously you've got to do it on a mass

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:45.080 
obviously you've got to do it on a mass
scale<00:02:42.450> so<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:43.190> dig<00:02:44.190> in<00:02:44.400> tonight<00:02:44.760> be<00:02:44.970> like

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
scale so don't dig in tonight be like

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.360 
scale so don't dig in tonight be like
wait<00:02:45.300> I<00:02:45.410> there's<00:02:46.410> gold<00:02:46.680> in<00:02:46.860> these<00:02:47.010> Elle's

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
wait I there's gold in these Elle's

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.880 
wait I there's gold in these Elle's
don't<00:02:48.360> do<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:49.370> so<00:02:50.370> but<00:02:50.850> maybe<00:02:51.890> scientists

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
don't do that so but maybe scientists

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.980 
don't do that so but maybe scientists
can<00:02:53.010> figure<00:02:53.160> out<00:02:53.250> a<00:02:53.340> way<00:02:53.520> to<00:02:53.550> actually<00:02:54.450> just

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:54.990 
can figure out a way to actually just

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:56.330 
can figure out a way to actually just
make<00:02:55.140> things<00:02:55.350> a<00:02:55.410> little<00:02:55.530> bit<00:02:55.680> more<00:02:55.860> efficient

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
make things a little bit more efficient

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.340 
make things a little bit more efficient
find<00:02:56.910> a<00:02:57.000> filtering<00:02:57.390> process<00:02:57.420> where<00:02:58.050> we<00:02:58.170> get

00:02:58.340 --> 00:02:58.350 
find a filtering process where we get

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:01.040 
find a filtering process where we get
the<00:02:58.560> gold<00:02:59.370> and<00:02:59.670> the<00:03:00.270> better<00:03:00.420> fertilizer<00:03:00.870> right

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:01.050 
the gold and the better fertilizer right

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.870 
the gold and the better fertilizer right
and<00:03:01.230> it's<00:03:01.350> not<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.620> Gold's<00:03:02.070> Platinum<00:03:02.640> silver

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880 
and it's not just Gold's Platinum silver

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.340 
and it's not just Gold's Platinum silver
or<00:03:03.150> other<00:03:03.180> precious<00:03:03.600> metals<00:03:04.050> so<00:03:04.170> that's

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
or other precious metals so that's

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.680 
or other precious metals so that's
that's<00:03:04.560> good<00:03:04.710> news<00:03:05.300> often<00:03:06.300> times<00:03:06.510> when<00:03:06.660> we

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
that's good news often times when we

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.540 
that's good news often times when we
talk<00:03:06.990> about<00:03:07.140> scientists<00:03:07.740> I<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.340> little

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:08.550 
talk about scientists I get a little

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.190 
talk about scientists I get a little
jealous<00:03:08.730> because<00:03:09.090> they're<00:03:09.360> so<00:03:09.600> incredibly

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
jealous because they're so incredibly

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.900 
jealous because they're so incredibly
intelligent<00:03:10.530> and<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.400> lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.670> them<00:03:11.790> are

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
intelligent and a lot of them are

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.910 
intelligent and a lot of them are
innovative<00:03:12.450> and<00:03:12.720> they<00:03:13.110> do<00:03:13.170> so<00:03:13.560> many<00:03:13.710> great

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
innovative and they do so many great

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.860 
innovative and they do so many great
things<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.400> society<00:03:14.910> but<00:03:15.390> these<00:03:15.630> are

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
things for society but these are

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:18.170 
things for society but these are
researchers<00:03:16.860> that<00:03:17.040> I'm<00:03:17.160> not<00:03:17.370> jealous<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.970> I

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
researchers that I'm not jealous of I

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.390 
researchers that I'm not jealous of I
have<00:03:18.780> no<00:03:18.930> interest<00:03:19.230> in<00:03:19.410> that<00:03:19.590> I<00:03:19.830> have<00:03:20.370> no
