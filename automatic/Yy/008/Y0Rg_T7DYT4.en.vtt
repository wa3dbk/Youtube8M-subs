I<00:00:51.539> couldn't<00:00:51.809> fit<00:00:51.899> those<00:00:52.050> my<00:00:52.230> inventory<00:00:52.440> but

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
I couldn't fit those my inventory but

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.369 
I couldn't fit those my inventory but
that's<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.730> know<00:00:53.789> pretty<00:00:54.090> easy<00:00:54.989> to<00:00:55.170> grab

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
that's you know pretty easy to grab

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:56.930 
that's you know pretty easy to grab
anyway<00:00:55.770> so<00:00:55.829> go<00:00:56.100> ahead<00:00:56.219> and<00:00:56.309> make<00:00:56.399> a<00:00:56.430> shape<00:00:56.699> like

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
anyway so go ahead and make a shape like

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.090 
anyway so go ahead and make a shape like
this<00:00:57.000> so<00:00:57.510> how<00:00:57.660> you<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.960> that<00:00:57.989> is<00:00:58.350> space<00:00:58.620> them<00:00:58.890> to

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
this so how you do that is space them to

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.700 
this so how you do that is space them to
a<00:00:59.129> part<00:00:59.520> like<00:01:00.149> this<00:01:00.420> build<00:01:00.809> this<00:01:00.989> one<00:01:01.170> up<00:01:01.320> three

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
a part like this build this one up three

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.490 
a part like this build this one up three
and<00:01:02.010> on<00:01:02.370> the<00:01:02.520> outside<00:01:02.910> do<00:01:03.270> two<00:01:03.510> and<00:01:03.809> then<00:01:04.320> just

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
and on the outside do two and then just

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.399 
and on the outside do two and then just
kind<00:01:04.650> of<00:01:04.710> repeat<00:01:05.070> that<00:01:05.280> four<00:01:05.790> times<00:01:06.060> and<00:01:06.540> once

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
kind of repeat that four times and once

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.050 
kind of repeat that four times and once
you<00:01:07.500> have<00:01:07.680> that<00:01:07.710> basic<00:01:08.280> structure<00:01:08.549> built<00:01:08.880> we

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
you have that basic structure built we

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:10.520 
you have that basic structure built we
can<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.330> ahead<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:09.600> move<00:01:09.840> on<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.290> walls

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
can go ahead and move on to the walls

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.590 
can go ahead and move on to the walls
just<00:01:10.890> take<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.520> cobble<00:01:11.820> stone<00:01:12.000> stairs<00:01:12.270> place

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
just take your cobble stone stairs place

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:15.580 
just take your cobble stone stairs place
them<00:01:12.840> right<00:01:13.650> way<00:01:13.950> and<00:01:14.250> then<00:01:14.520> upside<00:01:14.939> down<00:01:15.180> in

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
them right way and then upside down in

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.469 
them right way and then upside down in
the<00:01:16.590> outer<00:01:16.830> edge<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.670> so<00:01:17.939> you<00:01:18.000> have<00:01:18.150> one

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the outer edge of it so you have one

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.330 
the outer edge of it so you have one
space<00:01:18.840> on<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.170> inside<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.710> this<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:19.979> gives<00:01:20.130> a

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
space on the inside so this just gives a

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.920 
space on the inside so this just gives a
much<00:01:21.000> roomier<00:01:21.479> interior<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:23.450> you<00:01:24.450> know<00:01:24.600> just

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
much roomier interior and you know just

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
much roomier interior and you know just
add<00:01:25.140> some<00:01:25.650> depth<00:01:26.430> to<00:01:26.549> your<00:01:26.790> walls<00:01:27.030> I<00:01:27.270> mean<00:01:27.450> I

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
add some depth to your walls I mean I

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.990 
add some depth to your walls I mean I
guess<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.960> could<00:01:27.990> do<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.680> but<00:01:29.610> again<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
guess you could do this but again it

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.929 
guess you could do this but again it
would<00:01:30.119> not<00:01:30.299> look<00:01:30.509> as<00:01:30.659> good<00:01:30.840> and<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:31.500> like<00:01:31.680> to

00:01:31.929 --> 00:01:31.939 
would not look as good and I like to

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.640 
would not look as good and I like to
sort<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:32.970> design<00:01:33.390> my<00:01:33.600> houses<00:01:33.990> with<00:01:34.170> some<00:01:34.380> depth

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
sort of design my houses with some depth

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.230 
sort of design my houses with some depth
so<00:01:35.280> there<00:01:35.490> we<00:01:35.670> go

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
so there we go

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.330 
so there we go
and<00:01:36.329> on<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.380> side<00:01:37.590> here<00:01:37.619> you<00:01:37.950> can<00:01:38.070> go<00:01:38.280> ahead

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
and on the side here you can go ahead

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.880 
and on the side here you can go ahead
and<00:01:38.490> just<00:01:38.579> throw<00:01:38.670> some<00:01:38.970> wood<00:01:39.500> maybe<00:01:40.500> an<00:01:40.710> oak

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
and just throw some wood maybe an oak

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.670 
and just throw some wood maybe an oak

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:20.470 
anvil over here these two anvils we

00:04:20.470 --> 00:04:26.820 
anvil over here these two anvils we

there Wow
so<00:04:30.250> we<00:04:30.310> could<00:04:30.400> do<00:04:30.490> that<00:04:30.840> and<00:04:31.840> then<00:04:32.020> maybe<00:04:32.199> right

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:32.500 
so we could do that and then maybe right

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.570 
so we could do that and then maybe right
