00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.720
 effect the other Italian competitor's favorite 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:05.670
 who has for the moment the bordeaux 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.359
 since he has the back of sebastian k and to 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.309
 outdoors 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:09.900
 rajaona hirschi and lufti kolgjini who 

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.400
 will go back again 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.110
 acceleration the race and yet some 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.490
 left on a funny foot to 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.139
 the rearguard is formula one reduced 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.670
 in powder that tempted me who have 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:19.080
 decided in any case to wait then 

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.609
 we see that timo coup we are not 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.710
 far away with the jazz wonders he 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.029
 is rather in the worlds or to build 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.350
 and there is an expectation 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.630
 in any case we do not wait with the radja 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.310
 mirchi and sebastian khaki in bassens where 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.689
 both side by side 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.270
 the aude is besides one goes from bart de 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:35.489
 sebastian karachi rope side next 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.350
 but it is indeed with particular to 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.940
 prat income but then we said 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.290
 a lot that is a free pants 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.210
 now wants to walk with arch 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.829
 madness who did not start him 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.420
 that he wanted and also to pawn there 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.370
 with the formula one that has infiltrated 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.950
 the rope side finally him that was leaving 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.870
 everything on the outside with rakia mirchi who 

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:53.340
 had a big big pressure finally 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.140
 on these machines kdc material case the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.590
 favorite seems to answer him very very 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.629
 easily 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.640
 we then have a step very far after the 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.660
 no one who in the back of the favorites and then 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.250
 we now see that we were shifting 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.660
 towards the recovery of cases from the back 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.369
 guard is what you did with va 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.960
 jump into the art wheel with timo qu 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:09.060
 is that it can in any case Timoko 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.829
 and sziget for now and he 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.479
 not just outside there was no 

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.130
 not for the moment of art kicker in the 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.810
 homeland makes the screen outside in the 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.729
 final round that out there very very well 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:19.200
 for a Sebastian the case and that I 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.000
 do you know who control the race in the 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.799
 rate of sebastian broke his more serious 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.720
 opponent these destinies effect the Italian 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:26.039
 they are extremely grouped between 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.080
 rk Basz straight and attempting to leave 

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:29.820
 in chelsea we also scored new 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 are are tracks that may be your doors 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.909
 and club CD of Ukraine did not require 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.310
 in the right for the difference 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.750
 can not easily wear with 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.030
 the wait-and-see market madness is also 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:39.700
 intimately cost will be third set and the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.299
 club 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.380
 and well senart who imposes the number 4 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.570
 in this final 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.579
 look at the joy of his partner 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.020
 last is the training of robert 

00:01:48.579 --> 00:01:52.390

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.460
 in the es8 loeb 2013 it's done 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.539
 does that art that prevail 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.490
 he made a good effort in mourning 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.810
 both in the nude win and timoko has 

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.729
 provided a nice end of race he is 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.100
 third is that jean charles a he is 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:04.299
 3rd he is 3rd timoko jazz verbeek the 

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.789
 extremely good to dream it's about 

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:08.200
 finishers who formed the podium 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:11.049
 jazz look that tries to infiltrate 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:13.180
 between hartmann thanks to his outside is 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.120
 attached to bercy on these purposes vouchers 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:18.690

 turning happened
