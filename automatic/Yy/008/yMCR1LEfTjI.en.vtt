so you can see what my friend Nate has

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:34.870 
so you can see what my friend Nate has
done<00:01:33.439> there<00:01:33.680> it's<00:01:33.890> a<00:01:34.010> transforming

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:34.880 
done there it's a transforming

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.010 
done there it's a transforming
controller<00:01:35.330> you<00:01:35.600> see<00:01:35.750> how<00:01:35.869> he's<00:01:35.990> just

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:36.020 
controller you see how he's just

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:37.810 
controller you see how he's just
transforming<00:01:36.710> it<00:01:36.799> Nate<00:01:37.189> can<00:01:37.310> you<00:01:37.430> put<00:01:37.610> it<00:01:37.700> back

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
transforming it Nate can you put it back

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.429 
transforming it Nate can you put it back
to<00:01:38.000> its<00:01:38.030> original<00:01:38.180> position<00:01:38.600> so<00:01:39.020> I<00:01:39.049> can<00:01:39.259> talk

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
to its original position so I can talk

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.679 
to its original position so I can talk
through<00:01:39.909> the<00:01:40.909> way<00:01:41.060> that<00:01:41.210> you've<00:01:41.299> done<00:01:41.509> that

00:01:41.679 --> 00:01:41.689 
through the way that you've done that

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.240 
through the way that you've done that
there<00:01:41.930> hopefully<00:01:42.259> the<00:01:42.530> camera<00:01:42.710> can<00:01:42.950> pick<00:01:43.100> that

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.250 
there hopefully the camera can pick that

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.010 
there hopefully the camera can pick that
up<00:01:43.310> so<00:01:43.610> you<00:01:43.729> see<00:01:43.939> that<00:01:44.150> in<00:01:44.360> its<00:01:44.810> standard

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
up so you see that in its standard

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.980 
up so you see that in its standard
travel<00:01:45.530> configuration<00:01:46.340> I<00:01:46.520> like<00:01:47.509> so<00:01:47.750> many<00:01:47.810> of

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
travel configuration I like so many of

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.450 
travel configuration I like so many of
the<00:01:48.080> big<00:01:48.290> controllers<00:01:48.860> out<00:01:48.979> there<00:01:49.220> on<00:01:49.369> the

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
the big controllers out there on the

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.460 
the big controllers out there on the
market<00:01:49.790> today<00:01:49.939> this<00:01:50.540> one<00:01:50.750> will<00:01:50.990> fit<00:01:51.259> inside

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
when the controllers pre-built into this

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.699 
when the controllers pre-built into this
configuration<00:02:20.629> it's<00:02:21.629> really<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.140> same<00:02:22.379> size

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
full complement of action buttons it's

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:33.470 
full complement of action buttons it's
also<00:02:32.069> got<00:02:32.250> triggers<00:02:32.640> on<00:02:32.760> the<00:02:32.790> top<00:02:33.090> maybe<00:02:33.299> you

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
also got triggers on the top maybe you

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.770 
also got triggers on the top maybe you
can<00:02:33.629> show<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.930> triggers<00:02:34.290> there<00:02:34.500> too<00:02:35.780> but

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
can show the triggers there too but

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.030 
can show the triggers there too but
there's<00:02:37.019> more<00:02:37.200> we've<00:02:37.439> tried<00:02:37.680> to<00:02:37.709> think<00:02:37.799> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
there's more we've tried to think of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.009 
there's more we've tried to think of
everything<00:02:38.159> so<00:02:38.849> we've<00:02:39.150> got<00:02:39.359> a<00:02:39.390> full<00:02:39.659> range<00:02:39.870> of

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:40.019 
everything so we've got a full range of

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:42.229 
everything so we've got a full range of
media<00:02:40.349> buttons<00:02:40.769> so<00:02:41.549> the<00:02:41.670> action<00:02:41.939> buttons

00:02:42.229 --> 00:02:42.239 
media buttons so the action buttons

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.599 
media buttons so the action buttons
double<00:02:42.599> up<00:02:42.720> as<00:02:42.870> media<00:02:43.290> buttons<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
double up as media buttons the

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:46.520 
double up as media buttons the
thumbsticks<00:02:45.090> will<00:02:45.329> double<00:02:45.659> up<00:02:45.780> as<00:02:46.019> a<00:02:46.049> mouse

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
thumbsticks will double up as a mouse

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.770 
thumbsticks will double up as a mouse
cursor<00:02:47.129> as<00:02:47.310> well<00:02:47.549> on<00:02:47.819> screen<00:02:48.209> if<00:02:48.389> you're<00:02:48.510> using

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
cursor as well on screen if you're using

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.539 
cursor as well on screen if you're using
this<00:02:49.049> with<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.319> set-top<00:02:49.590> box<00:02:50.010> or<00:02:50.220> media

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
this with the set-top box or media

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.990 
this with the set-top box or media
streamer<00:02:50.879> box<00:02:51.209> to<00:02:51.900> control<00:02:52.319> your<00:02:52.590> media<00:02:53.000> at

streamer box to control your media at
the<00:02:54.120> top<00:02:54.299> of<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> controller<00:02:54.900> we<00:02:55.049> have<00:02:55.079> an<00:02:55.379> OFN

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
the top of the controller we have an OFN

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.759 
the top of the controller we have an OFN
one-finger<00:02:57.060> navigation<00:02:57.810> device<00:02:58.170> so<00:02:58.560> that's

00:02:58.759 --> 00:02:58.769 
one-finger navigation device so that's

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:00.740 
one-finger navigation device so that's
gonna<00:02:58.980> mimic<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.609> movement<00:03:00.000> of<00:03:00.090> a<00:03:00.180> mouse<00:03:00.420> on

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:00.750 
gonna mimic the movement of a mouse on

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.599 
gonna mimic the movement of a mouse on
the<00:03:00.900> screen<00:03:00.959> if<00:03:01.409> you're<00:03:01.530> using<00:03:01.739> it<00:03:01.950> with<00:03:01.980> a<00:03:02.069> PC

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
the screen if you're using it with a PC

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:05.270 
the screen if you're using it with a PC
or<00:03:02.639> a<00:03:02.879> media<00:03:03.180> streamer<00:03:03.510> box<00:03:04.010> there's<00:03:05.010> four

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.869 
right hand side we have the mode button
so<00:03:19.139> that's<00:03:19.319> gonna<00:03:19.620> swap<00:03:20.400> between<00:03:20.730> the

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
so that's gonna swap between the
