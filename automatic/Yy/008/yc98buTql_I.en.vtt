00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.170
 I still have chances to win 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:03:00.480

00:02:51.360 --> 00:03:00.959

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.000

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:49.950

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.880

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:46.979
 cut off any path from the right 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:48.360

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:52.910
 that alex can not go to the right 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.910
