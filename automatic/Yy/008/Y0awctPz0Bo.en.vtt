so<00:00:06.910> we<00:00:07.029> can<00:00:07.150> expect<00:00:07.480> that<00:00:07.660> price<00:00:07.870> this<00:00:08.080> cup

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:08.320 
so we can expect that price this cup

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.130

business<00:00:09.250> is<00:00:09.400> about<00:00:09.519> people<00:00:10.000> being<00:00:10.540> available

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:11.140

right<00:00:11.559> and<00:00:11.800> we<00:00:12.340> all<00:00:12.460> know<00:00:12.700> how<00:00:12.880> complex<00:00:13.330> we<00:00:13.450> are

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:13.630 
right and we all know how complex we are

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.900 
right and we all know how complex we are
in<00:00:13.810> how<00:00:13.990> I<00:00:14.020> think<00:00:14.320> it's<00:00:14.920> really<00:00:15.190> the<00:00:15.490> case<00:00:15.670> that

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:15.910 
in how I think it's really the case that

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:18.390 
in how I think it's really the case that
there<00:00:16.150> is<00:00:16.299> a<00:00:16.650> single<00:00:17.650> course<00:00:17.830> of<00:00:17.980> action<00:00:18.369> that

usage<00:01:20.439> of<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.710> video<00:01:21.009> so<00:01:21.100> I<00:01:21.310> think<00:01:21.520> what<00:01:21.640> you

00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:21.759 
usage of the video so I think what you

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:23.520 
usage of the video so I think what you
find<00:01:22.090> is<00:01:22.360> that<00:01:22.390> people<00:01:22.570> are<00:01:22.930> the<00:01:23.110> same<00:01:23.320> the

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
find is that people are the same the

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.800 
find is that people are the same the
world<00:01:23.649> over<00:01:23.920> even<00:01:24.759> though<00:01:24.850> their<00:01:25.030> experiences
