00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
freezer

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:20.899 
freezer
I<00:02:18.840> stood<00:02:19.260> that<00:02:19.439> about<00:02:19.709> four<00:02:20.129> times<00:02:20.400> in<00:02:20.700> total

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:22.899

now<00:02:21.659> it's<00:02:21.810> a<00:02:21.840> good<00:02:21.989> idea<00:02:22.260> because<00:02:22.379> with<00:02:22.739> these

00:02:22.899 --> 00:02:22.909 
now it's a good idea because with these

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:26.390 
now it's a good idea because with these
normal<00:02:23.909> machine<00:02:24.290> ice<00:02:25.290> creams<00:02:25.739> they<00:02:25.950> go<00:02:26.129> a

normal machine ice creams they go a

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.220 
normal machine ice creams they go a
little<00:02:26.730> firmer<00:02:26.969> so<00:02:27.269> take<00:02:27.480> it<00:02:27.599> out<00:02:27.720> for<00:02:27.959> two<00:02:28.140> or

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
little firmer so take it out for two or

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.390 
little firmer so take it out for two or
three<00:02:28.379> minutes<00:02:28.470> before<00:02:28.799> you're<00:02:29.129> going<00:02:29.310> to
