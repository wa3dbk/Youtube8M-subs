 beef I learned so here 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.010
 soup meat is the advantage here 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.130
 is firstly cheaper and secondly 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:22.170
 it shares see, hear and fat share 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.769
 and is very good 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.300
 just for a conscious suitable then 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:31.800
 I have this whole thing here too 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.460

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:51.329

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.809
 stood as a single stand 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:59.250

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.559

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.060
 I start that my beef 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.060
 to make wide 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.110
 I will now briefly what has come to 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.110
 give 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:49.650
 and now run around 10.15 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:02:05.100
 let it be reasonable bond 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:02:08.600

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:19.190
 so now it comes to the seasoning 

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:28.370
 and now the whole thing is completed 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.090

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:33.170
