00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:15.030
 hello good how about in this video we're going 

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:18.690
 to learn how to make an omelette 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.000
 potatoes in the microwave is healthier and 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.460
 does not suck so much oil the potato for 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.860
 we're going to need a few 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.990
 potatoes we want according to the 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.349
 tortilla that we are going to make if big or 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.560
 small onion this is optional for 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:37.140
 that you like and some eggs 

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:41.070
 we will also pour a little oil 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:43.740
 olive and salt let's first thing 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.480
 let's do is chop the potatoes as 

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:49.810
 for tortilla in sheets and we're going to 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.580
 throw 

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:58.510
 in a bowl can be a crystal bowl of 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:02.820
 methacrylate or good that you have in the 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:06.239
 kitchen we are also going to throw the onion 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.239
 the one we want 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.190
 Salt 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.080
 a little oil 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.840
 and we cover it 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.719
 with this stage that comes if you do not have 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.740
 a lid because it's a crystal bowl 

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:35.740
 can you use 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.750
 plastic end and make a few 

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:46.579
 holes now we take it to 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:48.740
 microwave about 78 minutes of all 

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:52.700
 ways will depend on the potato there 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.439
 if there is a lot then more minutes you will see 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.830
 pricking the potato until it stays 

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:56.830
 soft 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.080
 Well, we just got the potatoes out of the 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.530
 microwave oven 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:10.000
 I have taken them several times and I have 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:11.710
 turned around the cidh gone mixing 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.520
 so that they would be the same for all 

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:17.380
 sides at the end he had them between 10 and 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.190
 15 minutes depends on the amount that 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:24.340
 you have thrown and we are going puncturing and 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:28.960
 starting a bit seeing that they are already 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.540
 more or less soft now like all the 

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.720
 we will mix tortillas with eggs 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:38.760
 let's go with the eggs I'm going to start 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:42.630
 for 4 eggs that I think more or less 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.630
 are the ones that I will need 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.400
 and if I need more, I 'll tell you 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:59.300
 Enough 

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:02.060
 once beaten the egg and already with a 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:05.260
 little bit of salt that we have thrown 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:05.260
 we are going to 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.380
 to move to potatoes like all the 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.380
 tortillas go 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.959
 Well, I think that in the end I was left 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:22.120
 pretty good egg and now we have 

00:03:19.959 --> 00:03:24.760
 two options or set it in the micro or 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:25.420
 more by putting it again or curdling it in 

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:28.030
 the pan 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.010
 I'm going to take it in the pan because it 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:33.459
 will brown on both sides and will give 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:36.000
 an omelette sensation made like 

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:36.000
 of all life 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.430
 and well here we put our tortilla 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:52.700
 potato 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:58.730
 already finished golden 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:01.160
 by lasarte and nothing I hope you take advantage 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:03.790
 and that you do often to the 

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.790
 next video 

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:27.010
 and here we have our tortilla 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:27.010
 potato 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.510
 what we have done in the microwave 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.480
 God
