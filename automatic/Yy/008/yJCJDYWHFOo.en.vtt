back<00:00:26.810> pain<00:00:27.109> what<00:00:27.619> I<00:00:27.650> want<00:00:27.919> to<00:00:28.009> go<00:00:28.160> through<00:00:28.460> was

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:28.849 
back pain what I want to go through was

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:32.109 
back pain what I want to go through was
how<00:00:29.419> to<00:00:29.449> stretch<00:00:30.289> your<00:00:30.619> iliacus<00:00:31.130> so<00:00:31.939> there

00:00:32.109 --> 00:00:32.119 
how to stretch your iliacus so there

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.350 
how to stretch your iliacus so there
ends<00:00:32.390> up<00:00:32.480> being<00:00:32.689> two<00:00:33.199> hip<00:00:33.590> flexor<00:00:34.190> muscles<00:00:35.090> and

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.360 
ends up being two hip flexor muscles and

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.700 
ends up being two hip flexor muscles and
it's<00:00:35.899> important<00:00:36.440> to<00:00:36.649> stretch<00:00:37.250> those<00:00:37.610> muscles

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:38.710 
it's important to stretch those muscles

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.140 
it's important to stretch those muscles
individually<00:00:39.710> so<00:00:40.040> we<00:00:40.159> end<00:00:40.280> up<00:00:40.309> having<00:00:40.400> iliacus

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:41.150 
individually so we end up having iliacus

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.020 
individually so we end up having iliacus
and<00:00:41.600> so<00:00:42.230> ass<00:00:42.470> and<00:00:42.829> i<00:00:43.129> wanted<00:00:43.519> to<00:00:43.550> go<00:00:43.730> through

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
and so ass and i wanted to go through

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.210 
and so ass and i wanted to go through
what's<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.809> most<00:00:45.019> effective<00:00:45.409> way<00:00:45.710> of

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:46.220 
what's the most effective way of

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.939 
what's the most effective way of
stretching<00:00:46.850> that<00:00:47.089> iliacus<00:00:47.659> muscle<00:00:47.930> and<00:00:48.620> I'll

00:00:48.939 --> 00:00:48.949 
stretching that iliacus muscle and I'll

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:51.969 
stretching that iliacus muscle and I'll
get<00:00:49.159> or<00:00:49.399> seed<00:00:49.729> to<00:00:50.030> do<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.420> it<00:00:50.600> ends<00:00:51.409> up<00:00:51.500> being<00:00:51.800> a

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:51.979 
get or seed to do it it ends up being a

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:55.689 
get or seed to do it it ends up being a
90<00:00:52.640> 90<00:00:53.120> hip<00:00:53.629> flexor<00:00:54.140> stretch<00:00:54.220> with<00:00:55.220> your<00:00:55.430> arm

00:00:55.689 --> 00:00:55.699 
90 90 hip flexor stretch with your arm

00:00:55.699 --> 00:00:56.590 
90 90 hip flexor stretch with your arm
overhead

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:56.600 
overhead

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.799 
overhead
so<00:00:57.379> Orsi<00:00:57.769> ends<00:00:57.949> up<00:00:58.040> being<00:00:58.460> in<00:00:58.610> this<00:00:58.809> 9090

00:00:59.799 --> 00:00:59.809 
so Orsi ends up being in this 9090

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:02.410 
so Orsi ends up being in this 9090
position<00:00:59.949> in<00:01:00.949> the<00:01:01.129> in<00:01:01.400> the<00:01:01.549> in<00:01:01.790> the<00:01:01.909> back<00:01:02.089> and
