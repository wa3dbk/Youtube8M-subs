00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:16.680
 guy I was in the northeast 32 degrees 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:20.130
 Every day there I caught a plane the least. 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.990
 8 degrees in event in Sao Paulo that tatsu 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.539
 the nine degrees 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.189
 so guess I got the flu and I 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.369
 said that I have to eat vitamins and 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.550
 You hit the stick and then we 'll go 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.079
 then make the orange flag to 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:42.270
 able to eat all the vitamin c that is 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:45.300
 need we will need cream of 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.829
 condensed milk and orange and for 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.160
 give a different touch we will go 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.559
 put the champagne cookies to 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.050
 give that crunch of that volume in the 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.079
 our dessert and make a crate the 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.750
 animal for him in the end a can 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:03.989
 whole cream and the same 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.659
 amount of condensed milk and 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.939
 the ideal is for us to achieve 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.150
 also a measure that the measurement of a 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:14.790
 can of orange juice 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:18.030
 so I have some oranges here that 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.430
 I'm going to take the south for doing this more 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.520
 I'll take the shavings off her because 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.890
 I want to save them more scent silver 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.970
 in our mix and a little bit too 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.970
 for the final decoration 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:40.290
 the same amount of orange juice 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.950
 so now it's just hit this guy is going 

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:47.770
 ride that way total secret khama day 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:51.290
 champagne wafer 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.890
 I do not even want to wet the 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:02:01.250
 wafer because we will have someone to 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:05.540
 she's going to have to absorb all this 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:09.440
 this liquid of our priest here 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.570
 layer of wafer or biscuit is already 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.320
 here we can play with our 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.060
 mixed with lime 

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.090
 spreading everything to make sure that 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.230
 all the biscuits here all our 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:33.890
 discussing who finally umidecidos by 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:37.370
 this next from here refrigerator for 4 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:40.160
 hours it will stiffen it will stay 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.900
 much more famous the biscuits are 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.120
 still floating because they are well 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.890
 wrong but as I'm going to pull everything 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.670
 They're going to settle. I'm going to be in the middle of the 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:52.480
 mix and in the meantime we wait and 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.480
 will prepare our chocolate 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:03:00.000
 dominate our chocolate ganache 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:03.160
 with the guy using the bitter medium 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.470
 way to microwave t 30 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.300
 seconds and moves 30 seconds to and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:09.420
 stir 30 seconds to Mexico to li 

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:09.420
 all 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.830
 Now from the mixing rate is only 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.830
 milk cream 

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.849
 if you want and you could give 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.849
 a Turkish in your in with the rate 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:39.120
 brandy any orange in color 

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:44.220
 thing is a little just give a go 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.950
 really cool do you think I am 

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:48.209
 using a text that I think already gives 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.870
 for us to work 

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.310
 It's more or less it's just the hyper creamy 

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:59.430
 We had to spread it and go. 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:02.579
 spreading well, lightly blink until firm and 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.920
 he'll be like this by taking out the car 

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:10.440
 that was where I tried it step 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:12.840
 normal to this mass is so if you 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.780
 leave in the freezer the night she 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.549
 it will grow a lot 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.680
 so I suggest you give one 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.750
 refrigerator an hour an hour and a half 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.090
 table up to two hours before you are 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:26.580
 Life, because then she'll give it to you. 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:29.070
 slice equal to about a pie 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.080
 good paper but it's a dessert that goes 

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.389
 teacher to harden 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:42.080
 now we can play our galaxy 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:42.080
 teaching and spreading on the back 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.940
 Do you remember that we already 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.360
 pine cones 

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:58.020
 just put it on top to remember everything 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:05:02.250
 world that although it looks like chocolate 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.250
 This is our ex Flemish paulo. 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.030
 I think tomorrow will be proud of 

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:35.050
 the so much of vitamin c that we will see as 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:40.120
 such that then there is something very 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:49.150
 magic in combining chocolate with 

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:52.540
 I do not know how to be an animal and from our 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:06:00.450
 Champagne shop absorbs everything gives a 

00:05:52.540 --> 00:06:03.700
 different texture in each hour 

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:06.400
 then that's it 

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:09.970
 If you will also see table, do it yourself. 

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:12.090
 Do not you have it too and see you this week. 

00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.090
 next
