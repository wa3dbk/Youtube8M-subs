00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.530 
from the very beginning the quality is
crap<00:00:13.559> and<00:00:13.920> the<00:00:14.670> only<00:00:14.820> reason<00:00:14.940> why<00:00:15.240> I<00:00:15.269> decided

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:15.540

video for our TNT this week is because I

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.880 
video for our TNT this week is because I
got<00:00:21.660> both<00:00:21.810> of<00:00:21.840> these<00:00:22.050> nukes<00:00:22.320> in<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.529> live<00:00:22.680> stream

got both of these nukes in a live stream
that<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.160> did<00:00:23.340> last<00:00:24.240> week<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:24.750> I<00:00:24.990> wanted<00:00:25.230> to

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
that I did last week and I wanted to

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.679 
that I did last week and I wanted to
upload<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:25.890> videos<00:00:26.130> that<00:00:26.160> I<00:00:26.340> got<00:00:26.519> I'll<00:00:27.060> from

the<00:00:27.779> live<00:00:27.900> stream<00:00:28.109> but<00:00:28.320> really<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.830> reason

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:28.980 
the live stream but really the reason

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.380 
the live stream but really the reason
why<00:00:29.189> i'm<00:00:29.310> uploading<00:00:29.789> both<00:00:30.090> of<00:00:30.240> them<00:00:30.330> is

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
why i'm uploading both of them is

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.179 
why i'm uploading both of them is
because<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.630> quality<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.960> so<00:00:31.170> bad<00:00:31.199> i<00:00:31.650> didn't

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189

definitely<00:04:31.020> love<00:04:31.199> that<00:04:31.400> also<00:04:32.400> I<00:04:32.699> got<00:04:33.479> one<00:04:33.930> on<00:04:34.290> I

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
definitely love that also I got one on I

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:36.350 
definitely love that also I got one on I
think<00:04:34.770> another<00:04:35.310> one<00:04:35.520> on<00:04:35.550> run<00:04:35.790> down<00:04:35.970> and<00:04:36.270> then

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
think another one on run down and then

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.200 
think another one on run down and then
one<00:04:36.540> on<00:04:36.570> Salvage<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:38.340> another<00:04:38.880> one<00:04:39.030> of<00:04:39.060> those

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
one on Salvage and another one of those

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:40.790 
one on Salvage and another one of those
maps<00:04:39.510> I<00:04:39.660> think<00:04:39.840> that<00:04:39.960> I<00:04:39.990> can<00:04:40.080> pull<00:04:40.410> off<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.560> nuke

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:40.800 
maps I think that I can pull off a nuke

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:43.460 
maps I think that I can pull off a nuke
on<00:04:40.919> Salvage<00:04:41.340> almost<00:04:41.669> anytime<00:04:41.940> we<00:04:42.260> have<00:04:43.260> the

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:43.470 
on Salvage almost anytime we have the

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:45.710 
on Salvage almost anytime we have the
upper<00:04:43.710> hand<00:04:43.740> when<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.610> enemy<00:04:44.850> has<00:04:45.000> a<00:04:45.030> mostest

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:45.720 
upper hand when the enemy has a mostest

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:47.600 
upper hand when the enemy has a mostest
fun<00:04:45.960> it<00:04:46.199> makes<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.620> difficult<00:04:46.770> but<00:04:47.070> right<00:04:47.490> here

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:47.610 
fun it makes a difficult but right here

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.520 
fun it makes a difficult but right here
is<00:04:47.729> tough<00:04:48.120> because<00:04:48.270> they<00:04:48.780> have<00:04:48.930> I<00:04:48.960> think<00:04:49.320> is<00:04:49.410> it

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:49.530 
is tough because they have I think is it

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:54.219 
is tough because they have I think is it
a<00:04:50.389> excuse<00:04:51.389> live<00:04:52.139> and<00:04:52.590> see<00:04:52.860> I'm<00:04:53.160> tired<00:04:53.460> man<00:04:53.669> um

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
a excuse live and see I'm tired man um

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.710 
a excuse live and see I'm tired man um
no<00:04:55.229> way<00:04:55.380> do<00:04:55.560> we<00:04:55.590> have<00:04:55.770> B<00:04:55.949> and<00:04:56.130> C<00:04:56.419> okay<00:04:57.419> so<00:04:57.479> they

00:04:57.710 --> 00:04:57.720 
no way do we have B and C okay so they

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.860 
no way do we have B and C okay so they
have<00:04:57.840> they<00:04:58.380> have<00:04:58.610> B<00:04:59.610> and<00:04:59.760> C<00:04:59.940> and<00:05:00.180> we<00:05:00.330> have<00:05:00.449> a<00:05:00.630> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
have they have B and C and we have a and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:02.810 
have they have B and C and we have a and
this<00:05:01.590> makes<00:05:01.830> it<00:05:01.949> difficult<00:05:02.130> because<00:05:02.430> they<00:05:02.699> are

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:02.820 
this makes it difficult because they are

00:05:02.820 --> 00:05:04.100 
this makes it difficult because they are
going<00:05:02.940> to<00:05:03.000> be<00:05:03.090> spawning<00:05:03.330> closer<00:05:03.600> to<00:05:03.750> me<00:05:03.870> or

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:04.110 
going to be spawning closer to me or

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.230 
going to be spawning closer to me or
most<00:05:04.680> likely<00:05:04.770> right<00:05:05.550> now<00:05:05.669> if<00:05:05.729> you<00:05:05.820> can<00:05:05.970> see<00:05:06.120> my

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
most likely right now if you can see my

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.580 
most likely right now if you can see my
team<00:05:06.449> is<00:05:06.570> coming<00:05:06.720> in<00:05:06.990> and<00:05:07.139> going<00:05:07.289> to<00:05:07.410> flip<00:05:07.560> it

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:07.590 
team is coming in and going to flip it

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:09.710 
team is coming in and going to flip it
right<00:05:07.770> here<00:05:07.949> so<00:05:08.190> that's<00:05:08.639> actually<00:05:09.030> good<00:05:09.240> I

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
right here so that's actually good I

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:12.560 
right here so that's actually good I
called<00:05:10.380> in<00:05:10.530> my<00:05:10.820> hairy<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.030> I'm<00:05:12.090> just<00:05:12.240> waiting

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
called in my hairy and I'm just waiting

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:14.090 
called in my hairy and I'm just waiting
for<00:05:12.720> it<00:05:12.780> to<00:05:12.840> do<00:05:13.289> some<00:05:13.470> work<00:05:13.500> I<00:05:13.680> think<00:05:13.740> I<00:05:13.919> call<00:05:14.070> it

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
for it to do some work I think I call it

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.580 
for it to do some work I think I call it
an<00:05:14.370> actually<00:05:14.669> on<00:05:14.760> the<00:05:14.789> seaside<00:05:15.210> but<00:05:15.960> uh<00:05:15.990> but

00:05:19.159 --> 00:05:19.169 
people are spawning over I think over by

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.500 
people are spawning over I think over by
the<00:05:19.229> the<00:05:19.620> beef<00:05:19.800> beef<00:05:20.130> flag<00:05:20.310> area<00:05:20.639> and<00:05:20.820> finally

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:25.440 
got my my AC 130 I got I got 11 kills in

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:28.670 
got my my AC 130 I got I got 11 kills in
I<00:05:26.310> got<00:05:26.700> one<00:05:26.820> extra<00:05:27.090> one<00:05:27.300> from<00:05:27.479> the<00:05:27.599> Harrier<00:05:28.500> and

00:05:28.670 --> 00:05:28.680 
I got one extra one from the Harrier and

00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.980 
I got one extra one from the Harrier and
then<00:05:29.160> this<00:05:29.610> I<00:05:29.849> mean<00:05:30.000> sometimes<00:05:30.180> it<00:05:30.539> spawns<00:05:30.810> in

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
then this I mean sometimes it spawns in

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:32.270 
then this I mean sometimes it spawns in
this<00:05:31.169> map<00:05:31.349> work<00:05:31.590> out<00:05:31.740> really<00:05:31.950> really<00:05:32.070> well

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280 
this map work out really really well

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:34.190 
this map work out really really well
sometimes<00:05:32.789> they<00:05:32.940> work<00:05:33.090> out<00:05:33.210> really<00:05:33.360> bad<00:05:33.599> you

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
sometimes they work out really bad you

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.659 
sometimes they work out really bad you
just<00:05:34.229> got<00:05:34.470> to<00:05:34.500> follow<00:05:34.710> those<00:05:34.950> red<00:05:35.160> dots<00:05:35.190> man

00:05:35.659 --> 00:05:35.669 
just got to follow those red dots man

00:05:35.669 --> 00:05:37.010 
just got to follow those red dots man

be able to pull off and just look for

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.700 
be able to pull off and just look for
the<00:05:38.880> white<00:05:39.270> dudes<00:05:39.780> just<00:05:39.960> popping<00:05:40.349> up<00:05:40.440> you<00:05:40.590> can

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
the white dudes just popping up you can

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.409 
the white dudes just popping up you can
see<00:05:40.830> right<00:05:40.860> there<00:05:41.190> that<00:05:41.220> guy<00:05:41.849> popped<00:05:42.120> up<00:05:42.300> and

00:05:42.409 --> 00:05:42.419 
see right there that guy popped up and

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:44.060 
see right there that guy popped up and
so<00:05:42.510> I<00:05:42.539> knew<00:05:42.870> that<00:05:42.900> was<00:05:43.139> another<00:05:43.320> good<00:05:43.500> spot<00:05:43.830> and

00:05:44.060 --> 00:05:44.070 
so I knew that was another good spot and

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.650 
so I knew that was another good spot and
I<00:05:44.520> believe<00:05:44.580> I<00:05:44.849> had<00:05:45.000> a<00:05:45.030> four<00:05:45.270> bar<00:05:45.389> because

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:45.660 
I believe I had a four bar because

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.879 
I believe I had a four bar because
there's<00:05:45.810> no<00:05:45.930> way<00:05:46.080> that<00:05:46.229> little<00:05:46.470> itty<00:05:46.680> bitty

00:05:46.879 --> 00:05:46.889 
there's no way that little itty bitty

00:05:46.889 --> 00:05:48.290 
there's no way that little itty bitty
burst<00:05:47.190> fire<00:05:47.520> would<00:05:47.729> have<00:05:47.820> actually<00:05:48.000> killed

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:48.300 
burst fire would have actually killed

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:49.610 
burst fire would have actually killed
the<00:05:48.900> other<00:05:49.020> guy<00:05:49.050> that<00:05:49.289> was<00:05:49.380> the<00:05:49.440> other<00:05:49.470> thing

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:49.620 
the other guy that was the other thing

00:05:49.620 --> 00:05:50.719 
the other guy that was the other thing
else<00:05:49.830> find<00:05:50.039> the<00:05:50.130> whole<00:05:50.250> time<00:05:50.370> with<00:05:50.520> a<00:05:50.550> live

with a c-130 it makes it really

00:05:59.089 --> 00:05:59.099 
difficult for me to pull off a nuke but
