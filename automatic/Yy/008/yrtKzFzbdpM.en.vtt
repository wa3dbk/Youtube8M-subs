goes<00:01:42.509> inside<00:01:43.670> of<00:01:44.670> this<00:01:45.090> piece<00:01:45.450> I<00:01:45.869> guess<00:01:46.680> so

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
goes inside of this piece I guess so

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:56.209 
goes inside of this piece I guess so
this<00:01:48.720> kind<00:01:49.320> of<00:01:50.540> how<00:01:51.540> does<00:01:51.720> it<00:01:51.899> work<00:01:52.140> I<00:01:55.219> don't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
this kind of how does it work I don't

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.220
