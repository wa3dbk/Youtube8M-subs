00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.600
 antenor the house is unlike anything 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.699
 you already saw here there is nothing at all 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.189
 that is conventional 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.680
 it is no wonder that it has become by far the 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:28.349
 main tourist point of the community 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:38.550
 of paraisópolis in the south zone of são paulo 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:42.020
 and there is no lack of visitors here 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:51.600
 out of Brazil 

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:55.980
 for who is accustomed but same 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:58.559
 so hit the card in the bungalow 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:02.309
 Do you think of the house? 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:03.989
 cool, it's beautiful, I really like myself 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:15.619
 here for us to see right? 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:15.619
 his house is pretty cool on the street and 

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:33.650
 He asks what he could do this. 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:35.369
 with that idea that you found 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:37.909
 cool huh 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.909
 liked it 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:54.899
 believe it or not but almost everything here is 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:58.200
 made with pet bottles including some 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.570
 walls to start the facade is already 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.880
 decorated with the greens the corridor of 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.920
 entrance has no 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.100
 many bottles other than a wall that 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.950
 makes a border with the neighbor but before 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.260
 to get into this issue we have other 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.230
 to show 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:18.590
 antenor is in Alagoas and in honor of its 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.390
 state worsened on the wall the name of 88 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.200
 in the municipalities of Alagoas that 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.260
 map 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.980
 between them the two natal cities, yes 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.959
 two 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.989
 he states that he was born in the union motto 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:32.450
 of palmares with santana do mundaú and 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.640
 to remember the time of the field as well 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.299
 painted a horse and an ox in the 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:40.790
 input plus a map mix 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:45.110
 world with map of brazil 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:48.110
 I do not know, I still do not understand and in front of him 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:52.180
 built a blinking star star 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:56.030
 flashing is what he said to be that 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:57.079
 all this is just the façade and corridor of the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.000
 house of antenor 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.560
 now imagine that there is in there and 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.569
 to get an idea to get into the 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.890
 home we have to go through a door 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:09.940
 rotary made with 266 bottles 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.940
 pet do not know 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:24.889
 on the living room table he shows the bike 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.790
 that you are building with 

00:03:24.889 --> 00:03:29.750
 bottles 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.819
 there are more than a thousand and there are still 150 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:35.299
 He said he just did not finish because he's 

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:37.670
 missing the red cap on the market at 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:41.239
 tablecloth he made with rings of 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:42.980
 like the curtain of the door and 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:47.239
 You think things are done. 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:49.790
 so in the olhômetro none of this is almost a 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:53.120
 engineering project he calculates 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.450
 ring plug 

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:58.670
 all note down in the room b 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:04:01.430
 that is on the ground floor we go to the floor 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.670
 from above the stairs and the ceiling are also 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:05.900
 all decorated with pet bottles and there in 

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:08.849
 top 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.920
 upstairs 

00:04:08.849 --> 00:04:13.540
 this is the room of the antenor the place 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:15.579
 His favorite in the house 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.639
 How does he live alone with the women who 

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:20.530
 painted on the wall keep you company 

00:04:17.639 --> 00:04:23.889
 in addition he built with caps 

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:26.949
 two towers that have flashing lamps and 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:29.020
 on top put his own name written 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.919
 with letters formed by small 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:36.960
 watches and in the free time like 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:36.960
 Always sing in this little corner. 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:56.979
 originality and good 

00:04:49.539 --> 00:05:00.160
 arrived the moment arrives already arrives 

00:04:56.979 --> 00:05:03.220
 It has more thing for us to see only looks 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:09.460
 henhouse with bottle walls is the 

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:11.680
 reign of the Centaur do you think this 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:15.820
 and everything is not 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:18.699
 there is still the balcony, this is the balcony 

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:20.199
 the antenor sits on top of the house and has the 

00:05:18.699 --> 00:05:22.000
 view of the entire 

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:24.669
 paraisopolis that has a kiosk 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.220
 effect of pet bottles with 

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:28.780
 chairs also made of pet bottles 

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:31.090
 that gather friends and neighbors 

00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.520
 To have a coffee and invited me. 

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:35.520
 gently i will have coffee with him 

00:05:45.949 --> 00:05:49.369
 there a toast 

00:06:00.529 --> 00:06:05.969
 because he is and from where he takes so much bottle 

00:06:03.929 --> 00:06:10.139
 the updated number is under the door 

00:06:05.969 --> 00:06:13.559
 swivel of the corridor more than 25 thousand 

00:06:10.139 --> 00:06:15.300
 well, this is a long story 

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:18.059
 I said that with a neighbor who at the time 

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:21.569
 I was very selling gas to have the streets 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:25.800
 person consumes a lot of 

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:28.439
 has a very large population and I think 

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:33.119
 I 'm going to gather a lot of bottles and talk to 

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:35.969
 it is 30 cents each bottle and he 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:36.869
 He thought it was a business and started 

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:40.589
 bottle 

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:44.249
 Let's meet your jair and confirm the 

00:06:40.589 --> 00:06:46.249
 facts of bottle history is the 

00:06:44.249 --> 00:06:50.809
 Following 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:53.279
 Then I'll do a different job . 

00:06:50.809 --> 00:06:56.279
 you walk a lot on the street 

00:06:53.279 --> 00:07:00.360
 go and pick a bottle for me, I'll pay you 

00:06:56.279 --> 00:07:03.029
 30 cents each bottle walking around 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:05.639
 that he told this joke 48 

00:07:03.029 --> 00:07:09.449
 bottle he thought his idea was 

00:07:05.639 --> 00:07:11.639
 great this is a beast, I admire it 

00:07:09.449 --> 00:07:12.839
 much intelligence of his wisdom 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:14.309
 his patience 

00:07:12.839 --> 00:07:16.889
 This is a job for nobody to throw. 

00:07:14.309 --> 00:07:19.649
 This is a defect that is 

00:07:16.889 --> 00:07:21.389
 partnership in antenor if it was not the jair 

00:07:19.649 --> 00:07:24.070
 You would not have turned that celebrity. 

00:07:21.389 --> 00:07:25.840
 all not 

00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:27.280
 Some people do not tell me is that 

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.350
 here one day it will happen on television 

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:32.560
 You will continue to do so 

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:34.470
 your attention and it will start on television is 

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.180
 this happened and is happening 

00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:40.660
 there's always someone here to make a 

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:43.240
 matter that the preliminary hearing 

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:56.620
 but from now on you will continue 

00:07:43.240 --> 00:08:01.780
 enlarging the house with the bottles that the 

00:07:56.620 --> 00:08:02.650
 idea is not lacking and will always 

00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:08.670
 practice 

00:08:02.650 --> 00:08:08.670
 I'll continue doing what God wants 

00:08:13.230 --> 00:08:16.230
 ah
