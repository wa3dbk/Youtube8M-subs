because I was struggling with making the
buttons<00:00:11.490> using<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> molds<00:00:12.630> so<00:00:12.840> I<00:00:13.410> just<00:00:13.590> wanted

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
buttons using the molds so I just wanted

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.519 
buttons using the molds so I just wanted

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
obviously this is a flower mold and that

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.510 
obviously this is a flower mold and that
I<00:00:18.810> was<00:00:19.109> too<00:00:19.320> heavy-handed<00:00:19.680> really<00:00:20.400> were

I was too heavy-handed really were
taking<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.029> clay<00:00:21.270> out<00:00:21.380> but<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.410> still<00:00:22.650> got<00:00:22.800> a

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
taking the clay out but I still got a

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:25.160 
taking the clay out but I still got a
great<00:00:23.130> result<00:00:23.460> the<00:00:23.850> flowers<00:00:24.600> are<00:00:24.630> really<00:00:24.900> easy

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
great result the flowers are really easy

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.160 
great result the flowers are really easy
to<00:00:25.439> make<00:00:25.619> but<00:00:26.210> with<00:00:27.210> the<00:00:27.390> buttons<00:00:27.840> because

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
to make but with the buttons because

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.250 
to make but with the buttons because
they've<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.800> to<00:00:28.980> be<00:00:29.010> round<00:00:29.960> they've<00:00:30.960> got<00:00:31.140> to

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
they've got to be round they've got to

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.020 
they've got to be round they've got to
keep<00:00:31.410> their<00:00:31.619> shape<00:00:31.890> I<00:00:32.219> just<00:00:32.520> found<00:00:32.669> it<00:00:32.880> that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
keep their shape I just found it that

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.630 
keep their shape I just found it that
much<00:00:33.180> harder<00:00:33.210> I<00:00:33.930> heard<00:00:34.469> of<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.620> clip<00:00:34.860> careful<00:00:35.579> i

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
much harder I heard of a clip careful i

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.819 
much harder I heard of a clip careful i
was<00:00:35.850> trying<00:00:36.210> to<00:00:36.300> take<00:00:36.450> them<00:00:36.600> out<00:00:36.780> they<00:00:37.680> would

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
was trying to take them out they would

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.680 
was trying to take them out they would
still<00:00:38.040> warp<00:00:38.309> him<00:00:38.719> so<00:00:39.719> i<00:00:39.960> came<00:00:40.290> up<00:00:40.500> with<00:00:40.770> a<00:00:40.800> way

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:41.690 
still warp him so i came up with a way

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.560 
still warp him so i came up with a way
to<00:00:42.690> make<00:00:43.020> perfectly<00:00:43.590> round<00:00:43.890> buttons<00:00:44.539> so<00:00:45.539> i

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.570 
to make perfectly round buttons so i

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.170 
to make perfectly round buttons so i
just<00:00:45.719> thought<00:00:45.870> i'd<00:00:46.020> share<00:00:46.910> ok<00:00:47.910> now<00:00:48.120> the

just thought i'd share ok now the

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.930 
just thought i'd share ok now the
buttons<00:00:48.629> that<00:00:49.050> i'm<00:00:49.170> showing<00:00:49.500> you<00:00:49.710> are<00:00:50.700> all

dry and ready to be peeled off the
blocks<00:00:59.090> they've<00:01:00.090> been<00:01:00.270> drying<00:01:00.570> overnight<00:01:01.730> and

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
blocks they've been drying overnight and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.990 
blocks they've been drying overnight and

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
as you can see they're all perfectly

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.990 
as you can see they're all perfectly
formed<00:01:06.450> perfectly<00:01:06.990> round<00:01:07.229> and<00:01:07.939> there<00:01:08.939> are

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
formed perfectly round and there are

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.910 
formed perfectly round and there are
nice<00:01:09.150> thickness<00:01:09.450> and<00:01:10.020> I'm<00:01:10.380> really<00:01:10.710> pleased

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
nice thickness and I'm really pleased

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.620 
nice thickness and I'm really pleased
with<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.130> results<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:12.210> only<00:01:12.420> thing

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
with the results the only thing

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.200 
with the results the only thing
obviously<00:01:13.280> that<00:01:14.280> hasn't<00:01:14.460> happened<00:01:14.939> is<00:01:15.060> the

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
obviously that hasn't happened is the

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.940 
obviously that hasn't happened is the
Middle's<00:01:15.509> haven't<00:01:15.810> been<00:01:15.960> pierced<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.710> but

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
Middle's haven't been pierced out but

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:24.980 
Middle's haven't been pierced out but
you<00:01:17.400> can<00:01:17.549> easily<00:01:17.759> do<00:01:18.150> that

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:27.950 

okay<00:01:25.799> so<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.310> you<00:01:26.460> can<00:01:26.549> see<00:01:26.790> the<00:01:26.970> clay<00:01:27.149> comes<00:01:27.509> in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
okay so as you can see the clay comes in

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.990 
okay so as you can see the clay comes in
a<00:01:28.200> resealable<00:01:28.590> bag<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.340> get<00:01:29.490> quite<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.790> lot<00:01:29.880> in

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
a resealable bag you get quite a lot in

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.960 
a resealable bag you get quite a lot in
there<00:01:30.350> obviously<00:01:31.350> make<00:01:31.890> sure<00:01:32.100> you<00:01:32.430> seal<00:01:32.939> the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
there obviously make sure you seal the

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.460 
there obviously make sure you seal the
bag<00:01:33.270> after<00:01:33.750> use<00:01:34.710> because<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.250> clay<00:01:35.430> will<00:01:35.700> dry

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:36.470 
bag after use because the clay will dry

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.380 
bag after use because the clay will dry
and<00:01:37.470> I'm<00:01:37.649> using<00:01:37.830> an<00:01:38.220> embossing<00:01:38.610> buddy<00:01:38.820> to

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
and I'm using an embossing buddy to

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.160 
and I'm using an embossing buddy to
release<00:01:39.659> some<00:01:39.930> powder<00:01:40.229> into<00:01:40.590> the<00:01:40.740> mold<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
release some powder into the mold I

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.330 
release some powder into the mold I
don't<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.320> this<00:01:43.470> when<00:01:43.619> i'm<00:01:43.710> using<00:01:44.039> the<00:01:44.130> flower

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
don't do this when i'm using the flower

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:45.859 
don't do this when i'm using the flower
molds<00:01:44.759> i<00:01:44.820> don't<00:01:45.030> need<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.450> but<00:01:45.600> with<00:01:45.780> the

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
molds i don't need to but with the

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:47.960 
molds i don't need to but with the
buttons<00:01:46.289> with<00:01:46.590> this<00:01:46.740> technique<00:01:47.189> i'm<00:01:47.429> using<00:01:47.850> i

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
buttons with this technique i'm using i

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.800 
buttons with this technique i'm using i
do<00:01:48.030> need<00:01:48.420> my<00:01:48.630> boss<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.049> buddy<00:01:49.229> okay<00:01:53.630> this<00:01:54.630> is<00:01:54.780> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
secret to the perfectly formed buttons

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.930 
secret to the perfectly formed buttons
is<00:01:57.720> using<00:01:58.140> acrylic<00:01:58.590> block<00:01:58.799> make<00:01:59.549> sure<00:01:59.789> it's

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
is using acrylic block make sure it's

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.690 
is using acrylic block make sure it's
really<00:02:00.240> clean<00:02:00.509> and<00:02:00.830> make<00:02:01.830> sure<00:02:02.100> that<00:02:02.549> you're

00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:04.679 
only using as much clay as you need

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:07.279 
only using as much clay as you need
