00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.590
 hi to all in this drive I will make you 

00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:06.420
 see how to restore my via r 

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.099
 that is the normal way of windows in 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.320
 following the installation of a 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.440
 linux distribution that could be 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.150
 precisely lubuntu et cetera 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.740
 first we put the disc of 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.820
 windows restoration that i this 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.410
 is windows seven 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.119
 I created it with the special sol.co 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.060
 windows you can make records of 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.279
 recovery from start but with no view 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.169
 you can still if you have a cd of 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.719
 installation is fine for both view and 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:36.390
 for seven, however, let's ask, I'll tell al 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.780
 sent system and discover reading but 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.250
 we 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.379
 we restart the computer this point where 

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:49.890
 54 the urchin created is installed 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:52.350
 however before installing it I had a 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.859
 any key I can't say a 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.350
 let you see what was written 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:00:59.280
 because otherwise I will normally start in 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.859
 group 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.410
 however it is written to press a key 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.320
 any to start cd rom or 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.130
 dvd rom that says windows easy 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:15.650
 praise in file we expect we hold that the 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.650
 loading bar at the bottom 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 first I take this time for 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:27.000
 explain to you that if you do the DVD of 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.130
 restoration 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.070
 when the system has already been installed 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.660
 ubuntu from inside windows is useless 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.680
 because files that are not copied will be copied 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.760
 there are and have already been overwritten 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:42.150
 dowie from ubuntu 

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:46.470
 so it is useless to do it again 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:48.300
 so you need to be careful and dvd's 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.030
 restoration when it has not yet been 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.040
 installed point if you have already installed 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:56.030
 tip no less busy if you have a dvd 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 installation as I said before 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:02.670
 you can take the DVD very well 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.530
 insert it in and start paying attention 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.940
 have click on install that in this 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.659
 case will not let you see why 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:12.020
 this is the restoration here, however 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.870
 train click on install because 

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.080
 install lose all files and then 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.670
 that is to say, you will no longer hold anything in 

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.680
 this method of recovery instead 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.720
 just go to rewrite a file that is 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.160
 been canceled 

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:27.440
 well he uploaded the files but you have to 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:31.730
 still wait a little will load the 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:34.040
 screen as windows server at sight yes 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.560
 is loading 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.670
 but soon this will load this 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.670
 screen look forward to 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:54.920
 I will not end the operation of 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:56.720
 restore because you don't want to 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.330
 allocate the computer anyway we choose 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.260
 the Italian language and star ahead is 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.170
 searching for operating systems 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:04.600
 installed windows of course 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:11.980
 microsoft 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:14.540
 we wait found windows seven 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:20.720
 select if we want to restore it 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.410
 forward you must click on restore 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:27.530
 on startup and then on restore on startup 

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:29.690
 that is he is he will start looking 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:34.010
 super startup problems you will write files 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:37.190
 missing and at the end of this 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.959
 operation you can click I have here here 

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:41.300
 is the task that will be restarted 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.540
 I don't pro if I don't proceed because not 

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:46.310
 I want to lose ubuntu anyway 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.530
 reboot as if I had already done the 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.380
 recovery and attention procedure 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:53.570
 during restart to open the cd rom 

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.440
 because otherwise they will be recharged 

00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:56.709
 another time 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:03.350
 you will have a loading screen 

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:05.269
 directly like this in windows e 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.100
 now windows has left and we have to 

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:08.510
 wait for it to load you don't have 

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.870
 the purple screen for which they mimic 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.989
 restored the computer we can 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:18.560
 remove the disc that you see is 

00:04:14.989 --> 00:04:24.400
 this is a cd that is only taken care of 

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:24.400
