00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 hello everyone guys there are me there 36 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 and today we are here with another video 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.700
 of my career 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.370
 let's go make a last game of the 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.219
 our second 10-day contract 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:26.699
 let's see who it will be against then 

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:32.880
 begin immediately we do 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:37.649
 get sellers if we go like this 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:41.460
 however they take rebound and 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:44.610
 this piamo games we put ourselves in 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.500
 melee and make us gay rudy do it 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.210
 perhaps he has not yet recovered from the 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.210
 stuck that we have trimmed them first 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:59.100
 and inside the first second free throw 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.070
 instead it is not good and here is the 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.589
 counterattack the passage for attention 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.589
 workers and the assist 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.770
 without going out of fashion for collins e 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:16.350
 we missed the ugly section 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.060
 this visa defended now does not make it 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:22.080
 we will keep until the end we will find ad 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:26.300
 go in and make two accounts e 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.300
 then we leave again, we have it split up and 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:33.360
 realize attack pulls and we take it 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:39.420
 rebound and we can leave we can 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:44.540
 take them that way and in fact there are two 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.540
 points that we have a motorway in front 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:50.750
 if we go to take the phallus 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.160
 today free throws do not want to enter 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.160
 we are already one in three 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:09.180
 and this enters less badly than we see if 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:12.180
 someone brings us a block, here it is e 

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:17.430
 we make the assist that among other things i 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:19.470
 guys I remember on mc that I did 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:22.440
 always so the assists played i 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:26.010
 phoenix suns and I remember the assists 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.750
 there were at least five between me and gortat 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:32.280
 in every game 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:34.530
 He brought me the block and io him 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:37.070
 passed let's let us bring the block 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.390
 we send from somewhere else 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:45.810
 and in fact we mark of cunning angers 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:49.430
 is that we pull and we take rebound 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.430
 and here we go again 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.630
 and we do not sin could be 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:08.260
 more foul hoop instead you are alone 

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:10.450
 two free throws and here we are back 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.760
 boys at minus 10 we must overturn them 

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:16.420
 I can't talk we have to overturn 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:19.140
 this match so they will give us a 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:19.140
 contract 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:30.239
 let's start by marking this basket e 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:30.239
 then let's go from qua odd to that basket 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:39.160
 and we keep the ball in with a 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.350
 rebound and the ball for the armature with a 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:46.450
 styles cass 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:48.569
 I love you woman and then we repeat with 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:56.560
 wind that makes you do it again 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:59.350
 we have to do something very fast and 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:04.390
 here is the inspiration that leads us to less 

00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:07.690
 four and ends here 72 64 no 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.340
 we made it up and now guys 

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:12.250
 to get the interesting part we see 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:15.840
 what the general manager will tell us 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.840
 if we stay in the team or not 

00:04:21.269 --> 00:04:24.680
 to health
