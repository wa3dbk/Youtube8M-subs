00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.170 
in october and we have the norwegian

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:30.180 
championship so it's we have some a few

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.130 
championship so it's we have some a few
races<00:02:30.510> before<00:02:30.930> this<00:02:31.640> in<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.910> fur<00:02:33.300> before<00:02:33.840> we

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
races before this in the fur before we

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.460 
races before this in the fur before we
have<00:02:34.490> the<00:02:35.490> team<00:02:35.730> ready<00:02:36.030> for<00:02:36.470> World

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
have the team ready for World

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:40.280 
have the team ready for World
Championship<00:02:38.010> so<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.670> think<00:02:39.480> we<00:02:39.690> have<00:02:39.720> log<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.200> a

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
Championship so I think we have log in a

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.460 
Championship so I think we have log in a
long<00:02:40.440> time<00:02:40.620> it's<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.160> 15k<00:02:41.790> is<00:02:41.850> first<00:02:42.810> of<00:02:43.020> marsh

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
long time it's the 15k is first of marsh

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.880 
long time it's the 15k is first of marsh
so<00:02:44.000> it's<00:02:45.000> a<00:02:45.180> couple<00:02:45.450> of<00:02:45.510> months<00:02:45.600> ago<00:02:45.890> you're

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so it's a couple of months ago you're

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.910 
so it's a couple of months ago you're
only<00:02:47.100> looking<00:02:47.340> forward<00:02:47.850> to<00:02:48.000> the<00:02:48.120> 15k<00:02:48.810> no

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
only looking forward to the 15k no

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.410 
only looking forward to the 15k no
championships<00:02:49.920> also<00:02:50.220> also<00:02:50.610> for<00:02:50.790> a<00:02:50.820> relay<00:02:51.180> I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
championships also also for a relay I

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.190 
championships also also for a relay I
think<00:02:52.020> if<00:02:52.620> I<00:02:52.830> ski<00:02:53.550> fast<00:02:53.880> in<00:02:54.120> the<00:02:54.209> 15k<00:02:54.720> it<00:02:54.780> really

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:55.200 
think if I ski fast in the 15k it really

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.370 
think if I ski fast in the 15k it really
will<00:02:55.350> come<00:02:55.530> so<00:02:55.890> but<00:02:56.250> I<00:02:56.520> know<00:02:57.240> where<00:02:57.420> we<00:02:57.540> have<00:02:57.720> I

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
will come so but I know where we have I

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.900
