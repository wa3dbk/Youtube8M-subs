shows no nose of seated cable row and
this<00:02:10.709> machine<00:02:11.129> that<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.300> cable<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.750> kind<00:02:12.959> of

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
this machine that the cable is kind of

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.390

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
long and my legs are too short so it

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820 
long and my legs are too short so it
bottoms<00:02:17.849> out<00:02:17.970> before<00:02:18.870> I<00:02:18.900> can<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.349> a<00:02:19.410> stretch

I'm staying forward and moving into it
that<00:03:04.409> way<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.590> kind<00:03:04.800> of<00:03:04.950> engage<00:03:05.489> and<00:03:05.819> use<00:03:05.940> your

that way you kind of engage and use your

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:09.860 
that way you kind of engage and use your
core<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.810> little<00:03:07.230> bit<00:03:07.349> and<00:03:08.420> be<00:03:09.420> careful<00:03:09.659> that

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
core a little bit and be careful that

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.330 
core a little bit and be careful that
you<00:03:10.019> don't<00:03:10.110> do<00:03:10.319> these<00:03:10.440> too<00:03:10.680> fast<00:03:10.920> at<00:03:11.159> first

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
you don't do these too fast at first

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.640 
you don't do these too fast at first
because<00:03:12.800> you<00:03:13.800> can<00:03:13.980> trip<00:03:14.209> I've<00:03:15.209> seen<00:03:15.420> it<00:03:15.540> happen

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
because you can trip I've seen it happen

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.770 
because you can trip I've seen it happen
so<00:03:16.650> just<00:03:16.980> take<00:03:17.970> your<00:03:18.090> time<00:03:18.150> when<00:03:18.450> you<00:03:18.540> first

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:18.780 
so just take your time when you first

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.540 
so just take your time when you first
start<00:03:19.019> you<00:03:19.140> can<00:03:19.290> pick<00:03:19.470> up<00:03:19.590> speed<00:03:19.830> if<00:03:20.099> you<00:03:20.340> want

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:20.550 
start you can pick up speed if you want

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:26.030 
start you can pick up speed if you want
to<00:03:20.700> as<00:03:20.970> you<00:03:21.180> get<00:03:21.330> going<00:03:21.659> and<00:03:23.390> this<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.659> a<00:03:25.260> little

00:03:26.030 --> 00:03:26.040 
to as you get going and this is a little

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:27.979 
to as you get going and this is a little
I<00:03:26.430> think<00:03:26.700> a<00:03:27.000> little<00:03:27.180> bit<00:03:27.330> different<00:03:27.690> angle

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
I think a little bit different angle

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:32.410 
I think a little bit different angle
than<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.140> first<00:03:28.890> one<00:03:29.159> but<00:03:30.680> again<00:03:31.680> you<00:03:31.890> want<00:03:32.129> a

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
than the first one but again you want a

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.360 
than the first one but again you want a
slight<00:03:33.620> slight<00:03:34.620> bending<00:03:35.069> your<00:03:35.220> knees<00:03:35.459> and

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
slight slight bending your knees and

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.559 
slight slight bending your knees and

up in the air and i'm pulling my
shoulders<00:04:56.990> back<00:04:57.170> as<00:04:57.380> much<00:04:57.560> as<00:04:57.620> i<00:04:57.860> can<00:04:57.920> to<00:04:58.370> so

00:04:58.630 --> 00:04:58.640 
shoulders back as much as i can to so

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:02.290 
shoulders back as much as i can to so
I'm<00:04:58.730> squeezing<00:04:59.180> it<00:05:00.310> from<00:05:01.310> left<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.670> right<00:05:01.760> and

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
I'm squeezing it from left to right and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:05.710 
I'm squeezing it from left to right and
I'm<00:05:02.450> also<00:05:02.690> arching<00:05:03.790> to<00:05:04.790> get<00:05:04.910> a<00:05:04.940> contraction

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:05.720 
I'm also arching to get a contraction

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.290 
I'm also arching to get a contraction
and<00:05:06.070> it's<00:05:07.070> kind<00:05:07.310> of<00:05:07.340> hard<00:05:07.520> for<00:05:07.580> me<00:05:07.730> to<00:05:07.940> explain

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:08.300 
and it's kind of hard for me to explain

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.870 
and it's kind of hard for me to explain
talking<00:05:09.020> about<00:05:09.140> it<00:05:10.630> but<00:05:11.630> anyway<00:05:12.850> here<00:05:13.850> goes

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
talking about it but anyway here goes

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.080 
talking about it but anyway here goes
the<00:05:14.330> high<00:05:14.690> two<00:05:14.750> taps<00:05:15.140> again<00:05:15.470> and<00:05:16.010> you<00:05:16.790> can<00:05:16.880> see

00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:17.090 
the high two taps again and you can see

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.450 
the high two taps again and you can see
how<00:05:17.240> I'm<00:05:17.360> like<00:05:17.570> moving<00:05:18.020> I'm<00:05:18.200> leaning<00:05:18.919> into<00:05:19.130> it

00:05:19.450 --> 00:05:19.460 
how I'm like moving I'm leaning into it

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:21.730 
how I'm like moving I'm leaning into it
and<00:05:19.640> I'm<00:05:20.120> lifting<00:05:20.330> my<00:05:20.540> legs<00:05:20.660> up<00:05:21.050> so<00:05:21.110> that<00:05:21.350> kind

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:21.740 
and I'm lifting my legs up so that kind

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.200 
and I'm lifting my legs up so that kind
of<00:05:21.800> helps<00:05:22.160> you<00:05:22.340> to<00:05:24.550> kind<00:05:25.550> of<00:05:25.610> just<00:05:25.760> engage<00:05:26.060> your

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
of helps you to kind of just engage your

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:28.180 
of helps you to kind of just engage your
core<00:05:26.450> better<00:05:27.080> I<00:05:27.350> think<00:05:27.800> it<00:05:27.860> makes<00:05:27.980> them<00:05:28.070> a

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
core better I think it makes them a

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:29.770 
core better I think it makes them a
little<00:05:28.340> bit<00:05:28.520> harder<00:05:28.850> to<00:05:28.880> you<00:05:29.360> get<00:05:29.480> a<00:05:29.510> lot<00:05:29.750> more

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:29.780 
little bit harder to you get a lot more

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:33.030 
little bit harder to you get a lot more
out<00:05:30.169> of<00:05:30.200> it<00:05:30.730> band<00:05:31.730> if<00:05:31.850> you<00:05:31.970> lean<00:05:32.120> back<00:05:32.150> too<00:05:32.540> far

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:33.040 
out of it band if you lean back too far

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:37.560 
out of it band if you lean back too far
okay<00:05:34.040> so<00:05:34.120> next<00:05:35.120> exercise<00:05:35.720> and<00:05:36.050> I<00:05:36.110> did<00:05:36.290> I<00:05:36.530> did

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:37.570 
okay so next exercise and I did I did

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.659 
okay so next exercise and I did I did
three<00:05:38.570> sets<00:05:38.900> of<00:05:39.110> these<00:05:39.320> but<00:05:39.710> my<00:05:40.010> video<00:05:40.400> camera

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:40.669
