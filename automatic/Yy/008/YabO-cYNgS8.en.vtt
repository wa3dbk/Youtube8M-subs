00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:08.230
 I do not know what to really say 

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:14.289
 three minutes 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:16.059
 for the greatest battle of our lives 

00:00:14.289 --> 00:00:19.230
 professionals 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.640
 everything comes down to today 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:22.990
 two 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.750
 we are cured 

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.350
 as a team or we woke up 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:33.600
 move to move inch by inch until 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.320
 the end now we are in hell 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.980
 gentlemen 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:43.720
 trust me 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.720
 and we stay here letting them crush 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:52.290
 we struggle to return to light 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:52.290
 we can get out of hell 

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.880
 for every inch 

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:02.699
 I can not do it for you I'm very 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.699
 old 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:08.100
 I look around and see those young faces 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.909
 and I think 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:15.920
 I think I have made all the mistakes that 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:15.920
 a middle- aged man can commit 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.340
 squandered all my money 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:25.159
 can you believe 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:27.549
 I have thrown out of my life to everyone who 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:27.549
 loves 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:34.790
 lately I can not even stand my face 

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.790
 I see in the mirror 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:47.170
 when you get older in life there are 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:49.420
 things that look but when you start 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.270
 lose those things 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:56.220
 you discover that life is a matter of 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:02:00.030
 inches like that is football 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:04.110
 because every life football game 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.750
 the margin of error is very small 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:09.810
 second slower or faster if not 

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.750
 you get to spend it half a second slower 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.540
 or faster and you do not get to pick it up 

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.330
 inches that we need to be to our 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.510
 around 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:23.680
 they are in every moment of the game in each 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.680
 minute and every second 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:30.530
 in this team we fight for that terrain 

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:33.710
 in this team we leave them the skin 

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:36.470
 us and each other for that 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:41.190
 inch that is earned 

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:43.770
 because when we add one after another 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.620
 because we know that if we add those 

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:51.350
 inches that's what will mark the 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.350
 slut difference to rule 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:03:00.239
 and will die 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:04.819
 I will tell you one thing in each fight that 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:07.969
 stronger is the one who wins that land 

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:12.819
 so life the end is because even 

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:16.350
 I want to fight and die for that inch 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:18.630
 sport live consists of that 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:19.680
 the 6 inches to clean our 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.360
 faces 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.430
 I can not convince you not to do 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.900
 you have to look at the one you have at your 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.900
 side look him in the eye 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:35.060
 willing to win the compassion you go to 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.580
 see an uncle who will sacrifice himself for this 

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:43.010
 team because he knows that when the 

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:46.300
 chance you have the same thing for that 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:46.300
 this is a team 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.410
 we do not cure ourselves now as a team 

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:57.300
 we will die as individuals 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.730
 that's football guys 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:10.409
 that's all it is 

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.409
 now 

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.690
 but you are going to do
