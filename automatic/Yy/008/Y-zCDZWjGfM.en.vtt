00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
design now it's not the most raised I've

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:47.810 
design now it's not the most raised I've
seen<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.190> definitely<00:00:47.340> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.700> get

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
seen but it's definitely going to get

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.229 
seen but it's definitely going to get
the<00:00:47.940> job<00:00:48.180> done<00:00:48.739> now<00:00:49.820> probably<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.000> main

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
the job done now probably the main

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.410 
the job done now probably the main
feature<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> case<00:00:51.809> is<00:00:52.230> the<00:00:53.059> slider<00:00:54.059> part

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
feature of the case is the slider part

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.680 
feature of the case is the slider part
basically<00:00:55.289> it<00:00:55.500> has<00:00:55.710> two<00:00:56.039> parts<00:00:56.390> to<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.480> case

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
basically it has two parts to the case

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.779 
basically it has two parts to the case
one<00:00:58.320> of<00:00:58.350> them<00:00:58.469> pulls<00:00:58.770> off<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.250> you<00:00:59.340> can<00:00:59.579> easily

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
one of them pulls off so you can easily

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.000 
one of them pulls off so you can easily
dock<00:01:00.149> your<00:01:00.300> phone<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.809> then<00:01:01.379> within<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.829> case

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
dock your phone and then within the case

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.219 
dock your phone and then within the case
there's<00:01:02.250> actually<00:01:02.640> felt<00:01:03.090> lining<00:01:03.359> so<00:01:04.049> that's

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
there's actually felt lining so that's

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.289 
there's actually felt lining so that's
going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> do<00:01:04.559> one<00:01:04.769> of<00:01:04.799> two<00:01:04.890> things<00:01:05.060> one<00:01:06.060> it's

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
going to do one of two things one it's

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:07.640 
going to do one of two things one it's
going<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.540> prevent<00:01:07.110> your<00:01:07.320> phone<00:01:07.470> from

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
going to prevent your phone from

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.920 
going to prevent your phone from
scratching<00:01:08.250> wallets<00:01:08.640> in<00:01:08.760> the<00:01:08.850> case<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.360> two

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
scratching wallets in the case and two

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.390 
scratching wallets in the case and two
it's<00:01:10.110> going<00:01:10.260> to<00:01:10.320> definitely<00:01:10.470> absorb<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.220> lot<00:01:11.340> of

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
it's going to definitely absorb a lot of

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.340 
it's going to definitely absorb a lot of
the<00:01:11.460> shock<00:01:11.760> if<00:01:12.030> you<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.540> indeed<00:01:12.900> drop<00:01:13.170> your

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
the shock if you do indeed drop your

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.320 
the shock if you do indeed drop your
phone<00:01:13.560> now<00:01:14.220> it's<00:01:14.250> also<00:01:14.520> incorporated<00:01:15.180> on<00:01:15.240> the

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
phone now it's also incorporated on the

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.960 
phone now it's also incorporated on the
bottom<00:01:15.689> part<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.049> the<00:01:16.110> case<00:01:16.320> so<00:01:17.189> let's<00:01:17.310> go<00:01:17.400> just

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
bottom part of the case so let's go just

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.910 
bottom part of the case so let's go just
go<00:01:18.090> ahead<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.299> jump<00:01:18.509> into<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.020> pros<00:01:19.650> about

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
go ahead and jump into the pros about

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.710 
go ahead and jump into the pros about
this<00:01:20.070> case<00:01:20.280> the<00:01:20.970> first<00:01:21.210> thing<00:01:21.360> i<00:01:21.450> really<00:01:21.570> like

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
this case the first thing i really like

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.859 
this case the first thing i really like
it's<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.140> slim<00:01:22.470> profile<00:01:23.040> of<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.369> case

00:01:23.859 --> 00:01:23.869 
it's a slim profile of this case

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:27.289 
it's a slim profile of this case
definitely<00:01:24.869> doesn't<00:01:25.619> take<00:01:26.580> away<00:01:26.729> from<00:01:26.850> the

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
definitely doesn't take away from the

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.780 
definitely doesn't take away from the
design<00:01:27.600> of<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.020> iphone<00:01:28.350> 4<00:01:28.650> now<00:01:29.340> the<00:01:29.400> second

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
design of the iphone 4 now the second

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:31.399 
design of the iphone 4 now the second
thing<00:01:29.820> i<00:01:29.970> like<00:01:30.150> is<00:01:30.180> if<00:01:30.450> felt<00:01:30.689> lining<00:01:30.900> within

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409 
thing i like is if felt lining within

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.499 
thing i like is if felt lining within
the<00:01:31.500> case<00:01:31.710> it<00:01:32.009> adds<00:01:32.280> very<00:01:32.729> nice<00:01:32.970> protection

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
the case it adds very nice protection

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.340 
the case it adds very nice protection
overall<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:34.619> third<00:01:34.860> thing<00:01:35.040> i<00:01:35.159> like<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.369> the

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:36.350 
overall the third thing i like is the

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:39.499 
overall the third thing i like is the
rubber<00:01:37.350> ish<00:01:37.560> or<00:01:37.799> marshmallow<00:01:38.700> feeling<00:01:39.180> of<00:01:39.329> the

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
rubber ish or marshmallow feeling of the

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.270 
rubber ish or marshmallow feeling of the
case<00:01:39.720> it<00:01:39.960> definitely<00:01:40.350> gives<00:01:40.560> you<00:01:40.710> a<00:01:40.770> nice<00:01:40.950> grip

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
case it definitely gives you a nice grip

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.480 
case it definitely gives you a nice grip
on<00:01:41.549> the<00:01:42.299> phone<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:42.840> you<00:01:42.869> don't<00:01:43.259> so<00:01:44.130> it's<00:01:44.369> going

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
on the phone so you don't so it's going

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.219 
on the phone so you don't so it's going
to<00:01:44.549> minimize<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.299> number<00:01:45.570> of<00:01:45.720> times<00:01:45.990> you

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
to minimize the number of times you

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:50.510 
to minimize the number of times you
actually<00:01:46.590> drop<00:01:47.100> your<00:01:47.310> phone<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:49.520> jumping

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
actually drop your phone now jumping

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.010 
actually drop your phone now jumping
into<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> cons<00:01:51.030> here<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.570> first<00:01:51.780> thing<00:01:51.930> i

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
into the cons here the first thing i

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.300 
into the cons here the first thing i
didn't<00:01:52.259> like<00:01:52.290> is<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.619> fact<00:01:52.649> that<00:01:52.950> it<00:01:53.159> actually

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:53.310 
didn't like is the fact that it actually

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.090 
didn't like is the fact that it actually
bubbled<00:01:53.820> my<00:01:53.909> screen<00:01:54.270> shield<00:01:54.450> i<00:01:54.810> use<00:01:55.590> an<00:01:55.710> sgp

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
bubbled my screen shield i use an sgp

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.280 
bubbled my screen shield i use an sgp
screen<00:01:56.369> shield<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:56.969> it's<00:01:57.659> actually<00:01:57.869> cut

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
screen shield and it's actually cut

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:59.929 
screen shield and it's actually cut
smaller<00:01:58.619> than<00:01:58.799> the<00:01:58.920> screen<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.490> even<00:01:59.790> then

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
smaller than the screen and even then

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.300 
smaller than the screen and even then
the<00:02:00.090> case<00:02:00.360> actually<00:02:00.659> bubbles<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.710> now<00:02:02.250> the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the case actually bubbles it now the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.010 
the case actually bubbles it now the
second<00:02:02.790> thing<00:02:02.820> i<00:02:03.060> didn't<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.390> was<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.750> fact

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
second thing i didn't like was the fact

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.740 
second thing i didn't like was the fact
