00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:06.590 
numerical expressions when you use them
to<00:00:05.069> solve<00:00:05.339> word<00:00:05.609> problems<00:00:05.640> and<00:00:06.359> we're<00:00:06.450> going

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
to solve word problems and we're going

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.089 
to solve word problems and we're going
to<00:00:06.660> review<00:00:07.020> a<00:00:07.080> little<00:00:07.170> bit<00:00:07.500> with<00:00:07.740> order<00:00:08.040> of

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099

miles a day for the first week of his
exercise<00:00:26.760> plan<00:00:27.150> then<00:00:27.840> he<00:00:27.930> walked<00:00:28.140> three<00:00:28.410> miles

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
exercise plan then he walked three miles

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.460 
exercise plan then he walked three miles
a<00:00:28.949> day<00:00:28.980> for<00:00:29.340> the<00:00:29.429> next<00:00:29.730> nine<00:00:30.060> minutes<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:31.260> many

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
a day for the next nine minutes how many

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:34.250 
a day for the next nine minutes how many
miles<00:00:31.740> did<00:00:32.099> he<00:00:32.250> walk<00:00:32.460> in<00:00:32.730> home<00:00:32.940> well<00:00:33.870> in<00:00:34.079> this

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
miles did he walk in home well in this

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.139 
miles did he walk in home well in this
word<00:00:34.469> problem<00:00:34.770> they<00:00:35.130> give<00:00:35.280> us<00:00:35.460> some<00:00:35.640> key<00:00:35.910> words

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
word problem they give us some key words

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.479 
word problem they give us some key words
first<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:36.870> tell<00:00:37.110> us<00:00:37.260> that<00:00:37.410> he<00:00:37.469> walked<00:00:37.800> two

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
first they tell us that he walked two

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.970 
first they tell us that he walked two
miles<00:00:38.790> a<00:00:39.270> day<00:00:40.730> for<00:00:41.730> a<00:00:42.030> week<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.780> would<00:00:43.680> tell

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:43.980 
miles a day for a week that would tell

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.580 
miles a day for a week that would tell
me<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.700> he<00:00:45.030> walked<00:00:45.770> two<00:00:47.120> miles<00:00:48.379> seven<00:00:49.379> days

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
me that he walked two miles seven days

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.670 
me that he walked two miles seven days
so<00:00:50.399> for<00:00:50.700> each<00:00:50.969> day<00:00:51.539> he<00:00:51.989> walked<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.379> same

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
so for each day he walked the same

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.369 
so for each day he walked the same
amount<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.520> would<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.149> repeated<00:00:54.809> addition

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
amount that would be repeated addition

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.250 
amount that would be repeated addition
also<00:00:55.710> known<00:00:56.190> as<00:00:56.340> multiplication<00:00:56.960> and<00:00:57.960> it<00:00:58.109> goes

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
also known as multiplication and it goes

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.279 
also known as multiplication and it goes
on<00:00:58.469> to<00:00:58.620> say<00:00:58.890> then<00:00:59.370> he<00:00:59.489> walked<00:00:59.760> three<00:01:00.510> miles<00:01:00.840> a

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
on to say then he walked three miles a

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.570 
on to say then he walked three miles a
day<00:01:02.210> for<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.329> next<00:01:03.600> nine<00:01:03.899> days<00:01:04.309> again<00:01:05.309> he's

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
day for the next nine days again he's

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.050 
day for the next nine days again he's
walking<00:01:06.000> three<00:01:06.360> miles<00:01:06.659> the<00:01:07.350> same<00:01:07.850> amount<00:01:08.850> of

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
walking three miles the same amount of

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.410 
walking three miles the same amount of
times<00:01:09.479> again<00:01:10.350> this<00:01:10.470> is<00:01:10.619> repeated<00:01:10.950> addition

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
times again this is repeated addition

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:16.429 
times again this is repeated addition
also<00:01:12.420> known<00:01:12.659> as<00:01:14.000> multiplication<00:01:15.320> in<00:01:16.320> the

also known as multiplication in the

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.980 
also known as multiplication in the
bottom<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.250> question<00:01:17.610> asks<00:01:18.060> how<00:01:18.540> far<00:01:18.840> did<00:01:18.960> he

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
bottom the question asks how far did he

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:23.030 
bottom the question asks how far did he
walk<00:01:19.320> in<00:01:19.650> all<00:01:20.119> remember<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.330> all<00:01:21.860> means<00:01:22.860> we're

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
walk in all remember and all means we're

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.550 
walk in all remember and all means we're
going<00:01:23.130> to<00:01:23.220> add<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.820> first<00:01:24.090> week<00:01:24.360> in<00:01:24.689> the<00:01:24.750> nine

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
going to add the first week in the nine

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.130 
going to add the first week in the nine
days<00:01:25.830> distance<00:01:26.659> using<00:01:27.659> your<00:01:27.900> order<00:01:28.080> of

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
give you key words like adding plus and

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.400 
give you key words like adding plus and
