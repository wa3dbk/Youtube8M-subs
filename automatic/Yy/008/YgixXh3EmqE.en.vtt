00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.550
 Hello, everybody, ready to go. 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.439
 one more uncomplicated biology 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.930
 I hope so, because I hope that 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:29.160
 now with this module everybody can 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:33.300
 to understand easily h meto genesis 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.360
 now now what is the genesis ayment 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.550
 and the creation of judgments is the 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.670
 creation of gametes is the process that 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.879
 occurs in your ovary is the process that 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.760
 occurs in my purse thus guaranteeing 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 production of ova, the production of 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.920
 sperm agent's fault drew 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.729
 a cold word is is it occurs in my 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:58.739
 scrotal sac on my testicle pardon 

00:00:55.729 --> 00:01:02.939
 thus ensuring the production of the egg 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:05.339
 woman and the spermatozoon in man 

00:01:02.939 --> 00:01:08.790
 we start with the simplest people 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.790
 begins with man for spermatozoa 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:13.350
 the genesis of what happens to the 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.259
 genesis in man 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.140
 before the man was born there in the 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.620
 testicle and being in the ball of kut sim 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.480
 that little cell that 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:28.950
 call germ cells 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:33.659
 primordial primordial germs 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:37.200
 they differ in spermatozoa 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:41.270
 then they generate more spermatozoa 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.210
 they begin immediately to divide 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.760
 divide divide generating there a 

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:50.010
 cell repository that is fundamental 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.930
 so that man may be fertile life 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:54.270
 entire 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.940
 this first cell division that occurs 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:02:00.740
 in the testis is a division that occurs 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:03.270
 by mitos people is not yet the best 

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.610
 Why do you imagine if all the cells 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.099
 did meiosis at once 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.259
 one of us would be born with 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.000
 a scrotal pouch she's standing there in the 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.459
 and there as long as people 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.810
 to age we empty the sale of 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.640
 varzean farms 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.220
 or we already have an average of 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:24.090
 circulation type ramie rahman're wrong 

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:25.810
 good now tu tu tu tu tu tu tu tu and 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:28.480
 then never again 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:31.810
 It is important that there is always mitosis 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:34.780
 mitosis, mitosis, mitosis, storing 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.300
 of spermatozoa so that they can 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:39.190
 from puberty every day 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:41.590
 man can produce millions of 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.110
 spermatozoa that will be produced until 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:46.180
 the last day of your life 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:49.900
 then like these times times by weeds 

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:53.500
 gomes they have not yet suffered meiosis 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.880
 these cells are still 2 veni cells 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:03:00.299
 Blog Cells are Still Seeing the Whole 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:04.600
 life occurs the multiplication phase 

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:07.690
 occur these mitosis that occurs 

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:10.780
 From tests and nests tad 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.989
 the little boy is growing influence of the 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:16.390
 testosterone hormones 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:19.319
 this boy he starts to enter the 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.040
 puberty and puberty centered 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.739
 entails that it is expected to kill them 

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.500
 give spermatozoon genes 

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:32.140
 for these other phases growth 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:35.019
 and maturation expertise they can 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.010
 also take place from the 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:39.579
 puberty 

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.790
 every day a few thousand or even 

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:45.940
 million sperm see the 

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:49.440
 spermatophors a primary passing through 

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.390
 this phase called the growth phase 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:55.900
 in the growth phase 

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:58.900
 Aster killed goiÃ¢nia grows generating 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:04.350
 spermatozoa making an accumulation of 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:04.350
 nutrients an agreement calf 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.709
 nutrients that are important for the 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:15.549
 formation of spermatozoids 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:18.639
 so the primates quote a gent nothing more 

00:04:15.549 --> 00:04:20.229
 is what a sperm wants to be the 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.620
 which accumulated nutrients 

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:27.430
 then the favela is still 2 n is still 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:32.770
 to prohibit and then yes is this taking possession with 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:35.950
 who will enter meiosis by doing the two 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.780
 divisions generating first 

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:40.110
 2 

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:41.940
 already killed both and then four 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:44.430
 spermatic says 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.889
 with this division she is a better eleven 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.910
 make up in the face that the four 

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:53.190
 spermatozoa are 

00:04:49.910 --> 00:04:55.110
 haploids any doubt is just to see the 

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.540
 mitosis modules best for you 

00:04:55.110 --> 00:05:00.350
 will understand what better than cells 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:03.270
 daughters of meiosis are haploid cells 

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:06.150
 now and formats it 2 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:08.850
 he is deployed he haploid for 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.930
 To answer that you have to remember that 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.200
 the first division here is a division 

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:19.650
 reductionism and the second division is 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:22.290
 equational division, ie in the first 

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.870
 The best tip division is already 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:27.210
 separation of the homologous chromosomes 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:30.630
 generating spermatozoids of the two 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:33.930
 blogs that will have the separation of 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.900
 chromatic sisters for sister's generation 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:39.419
 matildes also haploids then this 

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:43.380
 phase of the system will thorton asper 

00:05:39.419 --> 00:05:48.990
 haploid matildes it is the phase of 

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:52.260
 maturation which corresponds to 6 to 11 and 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:57.570
 meiosis then generates as daughter cells 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:59.880
 the sister hue by her aunt said that the 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.289
 improvement will generate sperm're 

00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:04.680
 Right. 

00:06:01.289 --> 00:06:06.780
 the only difference that the themes do not 

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.479
 are you ready to swim swim yet? 

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:11.940
 in search of the egg in the enchanted one is not 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:15.270
 ready to continue the year of the 

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:17.580
 anadarko continue to swim not so okay 

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:19.740
 that has to occur but allows 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.100
 that undergo a process of specialization 

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:25.050
 called permeated gender to ensure 

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:28.770
 formation of the spermatozoon 

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:31.740
 Do you know a rabbit swimming for 

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:34.229
 help find the egg luzim of the last 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.810
 phase that is the specialization corresponds 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:39.140
 a series of changes that allow them to 

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:43.550
 have to suffer for the formation of a 

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:47.340
 sperm then feasible in a nutshell 

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:49.409
 This is the genesis sperm that has the 

00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:52.639
 multiplication phase that the myth 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:55.529
 eleven of the spermatozoa that 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:58.319
 sperm grows accumulating 

00:06:55.529 --> 00:07:01.679
 calf nutrients generating spermatophores 

00:06:58.319 --> 00:07:04.050
 a diploma and then say that 

00:07:01.679 --> 00:07:07.919
 maturation than meiosis where a 

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:11.639
 spermatozoa 11 generates 2 spermatophores 

00:07:07.919 --> 00:07:14.849
 2 and 4 spermatic says 

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:18.509
 and these four sperms suffer the 

00:07:14.849 --> 00:07:21.559
 work of a shape of a 

00:07:18.509 --> 00:07:24.629
 will work the sperm generating the 

00:07:21.559 --> 00:07:26.759
 sperm is the role of the legs 

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:29.429
 genesis that we will understand now 

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:32.550
 in detail what are the changes that 

00:07:29.429 --> 00:07:36.919
 killed sperm from have to suffer to 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.919
 that it can generate spermatozoa
