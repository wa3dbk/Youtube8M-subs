00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.640

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.539
 attractive which shades and you 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.149

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:39.690
 original makeup I will combine 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:41.610
 gold with violet what else shades 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.260
 besides this one will suit me 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.149
 bright purple you can use in 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.340
 principle the whole palette of shades which 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.340
 contains red ie pink 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:52.920
 lilac purple for example 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 neutral beige and pink palette 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.239
 brown shades very wide for 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.530
 but you today we will do very much 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.420
 original makeup which 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.270
 really makes the eyes truly 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.369
 bright and attractive say whether you need 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.200
 pull up the base is gel shadow color 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.790
 tattoo that does not need to impose 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.220
 not what base because they themselves 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.190
 yourself are good foundations under any 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.340
 to shade the border of these 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.750
 bright lilac shadows I'll be compact 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:20.430
 from the new collection 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.220
 shadows them he and meybellin new york 

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:26.580
 I use gold with my finger 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.299
 I put one layer it will dry up then I 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.299
 I will repeat 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.009
 bright lilac shadows can also be applied 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.780
 fingertip but in your case I 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:39.670
 I want to create a slightly more graphical form 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.350
 so use a brush 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.630
 Synthetic for books is enough 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.840
 wide here is this bright shade of shadows i 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:56.829
 I emphasize the crease of the century and a little 

00:01:45.840 --> 00:02:00.789
 extending the line of the fixed ages 

00:01:56.829 --> 00:02:02.950
 most visually it will stretch the eye and bright 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:08.049
 lilac shadows mono i just 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.590
 I spread the border like 

00:02:08.049 --> 00:02:15.000
 bases open re-put a little 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:18.220
 gold on the mobile eyelid cover shook 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.660
 because it will be a little brighter and second 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.660
 I offer an eye on transactions 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:37.360
 let's apply another thin layer 

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.050
 golden shadows on the mobile eyelid straight 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:41.370
 goddaughter 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:43.660
 just do not go on violet fine 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:45.610
 dark purple pencil I stressed 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.530
 ciliary contour and slightly lengthened 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.530
 eyelash growth line in the manner of eyeliner 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:04.170
 in the same pencil I emphasized 

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.170
 inner part of the century 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.140
 i emphasize the inside of the century for 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:16.420
 the pencil to the maximum 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.340
 close to the iris look 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.709
 it feels like it put in 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.810
 bright green lens because next 

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:26.260
 is bright contrasting 

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.760
 extra purple border i 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:37.020
 feather to make the eye a little 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:37.020
 2 class itself holds more 

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.150
 a small pencil border 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:56.850
 number of compact 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:59.670
 three functions each i will use mascara 

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:01.650
 go extreme it is lengthening or for 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.140
 the volume of this which is increasing 

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.690
 eyelashes and in length and gives a good 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.090
 volume open wider perhaps this 

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:10.800
 brush helps to paint over even the most 

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.900
 small cilia for open please 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:21.480
 such as internal or external 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:22.800
 keep your eyes slightly up 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:25.580
 higher chin it will help you 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:28.500
 paint the eyelashes from the roots themselves 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.630
 The final touch for this makeup is gentle 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:33.660
 and translucent lip gloss more 

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:35.250
 warm tint hold sofia it can 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:39.450
 carry quite a bit on the inside 

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:41.520
 even lower lip so chic 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.210
 makeup and so simple and most importantly you 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.210
 made herself
