00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
other dealer we make some in a bid-ask

spread so the physical market trades at

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.259 
spread so the physical market trades at

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:10.269 
a premium to the paper market because

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:11.460 
a premium to the paper market because
there's<00:02:10.420> a<00:02:10.450> fabrication<00:02:10.899> charge<00:02:11.260> and

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
there's a fabrication charge and

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:13.770 
there's a fabrication charge and
transportation<00:02:12.160> and<00:02:12.910> but<00:02:13.060> because<00:02:13.270> we<00:02:13.540> bid<00:02:13.690> it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
transportation and but because we bid it

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.000 
transportation and but because we bid it
out<00:02:13.870> these<00:02:14.050> market<00:02:14.349> dealers<00:02:14.590> we're<00:02:14.739> able<00:02:14.800> to

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
out these market dealers we're able to

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:17.339 
out these market dealers we're able to
collapse<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.610> spread<00:02:15.970> and<00:02:16.510> then<00:02:16.930> we<00:02:17.110> charge

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:17.349 
collapse that spread and then we charge

00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:17.900 
collapse that spread and then we charge
our<00:02:17.410> clients

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:17.910 
our clients

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.820 
our clients
which<00:02:18.270> is<00:02:18.390> a<00:02:18.420> very<00:02:18.780> similar<00:02:18.990> charge<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.410> an<00:02:19.470> ETF

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
which is a very similar charge to an ETF

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.740 
which is a very similar charge to an ETF
so<00:02:20.070> our<00:02:20.490> real<00:02:20.640> thesis<00:02:21.150> is<00:02:21.300> that<00:02:21.420> we<00:02:21.510> can<00:02:21.660> make

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
so our real thesis is that we can make

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:23.930 
so our real thesis is that we can make
it<00:02:21.870> as<00:02:22.020> liquid<00:02:22.470> and<00:02:22.650> as<00:02:23.040> easy<00:02:23.280> to<00:02:23.370> do<00:02:23.580> as<00:02:23.610> buying

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
it as liquid and as easy to do as buying

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.430 
it as liquid and as easy to do as buying
an<00:02:24.120> ETF<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.660> the<00:02:24.810> other<00:02:24.930> products<00:02:25.290> out<00:02:25.380> there

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
seems to have been stuck in a range for

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.940 
seems to have been stuck in a range for
the<00:02:30.540> past<00:02:30.720> couple<00:02:30.930> of<00:02:31.080> months<00:02:31.170> yeah<00:02:31.440> what<00:02:31.890> do

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:31.950 
the past couple of months yeah what do

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.870 
the past couple of months yeah what do
you<00:02:32.010> think<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.190> going<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:32.340> happen<00:02:32.490> is<00:02:32.670> going<00:02:32.790> to

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:32.880 
you think is going to happen is going to

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.820 
you think is going to happen is going to
stay<00:02:33.090> there<00:02:33.360> or<00:02:33.630> is<00:02:33.690> it<00:02:33.840> set<00:02:34.080> to<00:02:34.200> break<00:02:34.350> out<00:02:34.590> or

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
stay there or is it set to break out or

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.410 
stay there or is it set to break out or
break<00:02:35.010> down<00:02:35.250> yeah<00:02:35.550> you<00:02:35.790> know<00:02:35.880> I<00:02:35.910> think<00:02:36.150> with

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
break down yeah you know I think with

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.150 
break down yeah you know I think with
the<00:02:36.510> coordinated<00:02:36.930> action<00:02:37.200> of<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.620> central

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
the coordinated action of the central

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.100 
the coordinated action of the central
bank's<00:02:38.370> this<00:02:38.520> week<00:02:38.700> in<00:02:38.970> the<00:02:39.330> US<00:02:39.630> continued<00:02:40.020> to

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
bank's this week in the US continued to

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.570 
bank's this week in the US continued to
probably<00:02:40.350> provide<00:02:40.800> liquidity<00:02:40.950> to<00:02:41.340> all<00:02:41.400> the

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
probably provide liquidity to all the

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:44.210 
probably provide liquidity to all the
banks<00:02:41.970> in<00:02:42.180> Europe<00:02:42.420> I<00:02:42.930> think<00:02:43.800> you<00:02:43.860> start<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> see

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
banks in Europe I think you start to see

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:45.710 
banks in Europe I think you start to see
some<00:02:44.400> momentum<00:02:44.970> especially<00:02:45.120> with<00:02:45.630> the

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:45.720 
some momentum especially with the

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.300 
some momentum especially with the
possibility<00:02:46.230> of<00:02:46.260> the<00:02:46.320> ECB<00:02:46.620> cutting<00:02:46.950> rates<00:02:47.070> and

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
possibility of the ECB cutting rates and

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:48.560 
possibility of the ECB cutting rates and
maybe<00:02:47.490> even<00:02:47.580> the<00:02:47.730> Fed<00:02:47.910> cutting<00:02:48.150> the<00:02:48.210> discount

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
maybe even the Fed cutting the discount

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.690 
maybe even the Fed cutting the discount
rate<00:02:48.720> cheapens<00:02:49.350> currency<00:02:49.860> strengthens<00:02:50.340> gold

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
rate cheapens currency strengthens gold

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.040 
rate cheapens currency strengthens gold
right<00:02:50.940> in<00:02:50.970> environments<00:02:51.780> when<00:02:51.900> there's

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
right in environments when there's

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.390 
right in environments when there's
negative<00:02:52.470> real<00:02:52.620> rates<00:02:52.650> of<00:02:52.980> return<00:02:53.250> and

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
negative real rates of return and

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.700 
negative real rates of return and
getting<00:02:53.820> more<00:02:53.940> negative<00:02:54.120> or<00:02:54.590> moving<00:02:55.590> more

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710

getting more negative or moving more
towards<00:02:56.010> zero<00:02:56.220> gold<00:02:56.700> does<00:02:56.820> very<00:02:57.000> well<00:02:57.090> in

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
towards zero gold does very well in

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:58.370 
towards zero gold does very well in
those<00:02:57.270> environment<00:02:57.720> what's<00:02:57.870> your<00:02:58.050> price

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380 
those environment what's your price

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.900 
those environment what's your price
target<00:02:58.740> what<00:02:58.920> do<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.070> think<00:02:59.370> gold<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.700> going

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
target what do you think gold is going

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:01.910 
target what do you think gold is going
to<00:03:00.060> you<00:03:00.570> know<00:03:00.660> we<00:03:00.810> don't<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.200> price<00:03:01.560> targets

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
to you know we don't have price targets

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:04.280 
to you know we don't have price targets
I<00:03:01.980> think<00:03:02.220> most<00:03:02.610> people<00:03:02.850> try<00:03:03.000> in<00:03:03.090> 2000<00:03:03.720> I<00:03:03.840> think

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
I think most people try in 2000 I think

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.870 
I think most people try in 2000 I think
it<00:03:04.410> will<00:03:04.530> and<00:03:04.740> I<00:03:04.980> think<00:03:05.010> most<00:03:05.400> people<00:03:05.610> look<00:03:05.700> at

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
it will and I think most people look at

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.480 
it will and I think most people look at
the<00:03:06.030> pre<00:03:06.390> nineteen<00:03:07.320> eighties<00:03:07.500> peak<00:03:07.710> inflation

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:08.490 
the pre nineteen eighties peak inflation

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:10.010 
the pre nineteen eighties peak inflation
adjusted<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.060> that's<00:03:09.480> probably<00:03:09.660> the<00:03:09.900> wrong

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
adjusted but that's probably the wrong

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.210 
adjusted but that's probably the wrong
way<00:03:10.260> to<00:03:10.320> do<00:03:10.500> it<00:03:10.530> because<00:03:10.680> so<00:03:10.920> much<00:03:11.040> has<00:03:11.190> changed

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:11.220 
way to do it because so much has changed

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.280 
way to do it because so much has changed
since<00:03:11.520> then<00:03:11.850> there<00:03:12.240> was<00:03:12.390> no<00:03:12.480> ETF<00:03:12.900> then<00:03:13.110> there

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
since then there was no ETF then there

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:14.780 
since then there was no ETF then there
were<00:03:13.380> companies<00:03:13.800> like<00:03:14.010> so<00:03:14.280> access<00:03:14.700> has

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:14.790 
were companies like so access has

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:16.340 
were companies like so access has
changed<00:03:15.210> in<00:03:15.630> the<00:03:15.750> first<00:03:15.960> half<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:16.200> this<00:03:16.290> year

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
changed in the first half of this year

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:18.260 
changed in the first half of this year
half<00:03:16.830> the<00:03:17.040> buying<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.520> gold<00:03:17.730> was<00:03:17.880> actually<00:03:18.180> at

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:18.270 
half the buying of gold was actually at

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:20.120 
half the buying of gold was actually at
Asia<00:03:18.420> particularly<00:03:19.320> in<00:03:19.380> China<00:03:19.560> and<00:03:19.710> India<00:03:19.920> so

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
Asia particularly in China and India so

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.650 
Asia particularly in China and India so
we<00:03:20.490> have<00:03:20.610> some<00:03:20.790> dynamics<00:03:21.210> that<00:03:21.330> didn't<00:03:21.480> exist

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
we have some dynamics that didn't exist

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.630 
we have some dynamics that didn't exist
before<00:03:21.780> so<00:03:22.230> we<00:03:22.770> try<00:03:22.950> not<00:03:23.070> to<00:03:23.160> peg<00:03:23.280> it<00:03:23.400> to<00:03:23.490> that

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:23.640 
before so we try not to peg it to that

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.120 
before so we try not to peg it to that
where<00:03:23.970> do<00:03:24.060> you<00:03:24.150> keep<00:03:24.330> your<00:03:24.540> gold<00:03:24.840> I<00:03:25.380> try<00:03:26.070> to

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
where do you keep your gold I try to

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.490 
where do you keep your gold I try to
keep<00:03:26.370> it<00:03:26.459> in<00:03:26.520> Zurich<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.240> we<00:03:27.510> eyes<00:03:28.110> your<00:03:28.380> work

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 
keep it in Zurich so we eyes your work

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:30.110 
keep it in Zurich so we eyes your work
because<00:03:29.100> I<00:03:29.280> think<00:03:29.520> one<00:03:29.610> of<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:29.730> advantages<00:03:29.790> of

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:30.120 
because I think one of the advantages of

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.460 
because I think one of the advantages of
having<00:03:30.390> the<00:03:30.480> real<00:03:30.660> asset<00:03:30.990> is<00:03:31.080> you<00:03:31.200> can<00:03:31.320> add

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:31.470 
having the real asset is you can add

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.840 
having the real asset is you can add
more<00:03:31.650> diversification<00:03:32.040> so<00:03:32.430> I<00:03:32.490> can<00:03:32.700> have<00:03:32.820> a

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
more diversification so I can have a

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.010 
more diversification so I can have a
real<00:03:33.030> asset<00:03:33.209> but<00:03:33.480> I<00:03:33.510> can<00:03:33.660> also<00:03:33.750> store<00:03:33.959> it

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:34.020 
real asset but I can also store it

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:35.870 
real asset but I can also store it
outside<00:03:34.380> the<00:03:34.500> country<00:03:34.800> so<00:03:34.980> well<00:03:35.430> all<00:03:35.610> my<00:03:35.730> other

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
outside the country so well all my other

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.820 
outside the country so well all my other
assets<00:03:36.240> are<00:03:36.330> stored<00:03:36.540> in<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:36.720> US<00:03:36.959> I<00:03:37.170> can<00:03:37.680> just

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
assets are stored in the US I can just

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:38.960 
assets are stored in the US I can just
type<00:03:37.980> in<00:03:38.100> a<00:03:38.160> ticker<00:03:38.310> and<00:03:38.490> get<00:03:38.610> it<00:03:38.700> I<00:03:38.760> might<00:03:38.910> as

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:38.970 
type in a ticker and get it I might as

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.310 
type in a ticker and get it I might as
well<00:03:39.030> do<00:03:39.209> that<00:03:39.330> to<00:03:39.480> pits<00:03:39.690> the<00:03:39.840> cost<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.170> same

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
well do that to pits the cost the same

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.900 
well do that to pits the cost the same
