videos of this drill in action that way
you<00:00:47.610> can<00:00:47.760> see<00:00:47.940> what<00:00:48.090> it<00:00:48.149> looks<00:00:48.329> like<00:00:48.450> so<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
you can see what it looks like so the

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:50.630 
you can see what it looks like so the
drill<00:00:49.350> itself<00:00:49.620> really<00:00:49.829> simple<00:00:50.190> as<00:00:50.460> you<00:00:50.610> can

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
drill itself really simple as you can

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.080 
drill itself really simple as you can
see<00:00:50.850> we've<00:00:51.000> got<00:00:51.379> powerage<00:00:52.379> Pro<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.030> let's<00:00:54.030> just

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
see we've got powerage Pro or let's just

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:55.340 
see we've got powerage Pro or let's just
call<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.390> attack<00:00:54.629> triangle<00:00:55.050> because<00:00:55.199> that's

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
call that attack triangle because that's

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.049 
call that attack triangle because that's
what<00:00:55.500> I've<00:00:55.590> been<00:00:55.739> using<00:00:55.890> so<00:00:56.640> three<00:00:56.879> attack

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
what I've been using so three attack

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:00.080 
what I've been using so three attack
triangles<00:00:57.539> one<00:00:57.750> here<00:00:58.109> facing<00:00:58.739> out<00:00:59.100> one<00:00:59.850> here

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
triangles one here facing out one here

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.660 
triangles one here facing out one here
facing<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.660> and<00:01:00.899> then<00:01:01.379> one<00:01:01.620> facing<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.430> line

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
facing in and then one facing the line

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.009 
facing in and then one facing the line
up<00:01:02.850> you've<00:01:03.000> got<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.239> line<00:01:03.420> up<00:01:03.600> starting<00:01:03.960> at

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
up you've got the line up starting at

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:05.780 
up you've got the line up starting at
the<00:01:04.110> hash<00:01:04.260> marks<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.890> on<00:01:05.369> a<00:01:05.400> real<00:01:05.610> life

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
the hash marks and on a real life

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:07.399 
the hash marks and on a real life
surface<00:01:06.119> obviously<00:01:06.510> you'll<00:01:06.810> have<00:01:06.840> more<00:01:07.110> room

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
surface obviously you'll have more room

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.490 
surface obviously you'll have more room
than<00:01:07.650> on<00:01:07.860> this<00:01:08.189> diagram<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:09.840> is<00:01:09.900> a<00:01:10.049> great

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
than on this diagram this is a great

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.890 
than on this diagram this is a great
drill<00:01:10.830> for<00:01:10.860> station<00:01:11.790> work<00:01:11.970> and<00:01:12.299> as<00:01:12.720> you<00:01:12.810> can

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
drill for station work and as you can

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.210 
drill for station work and as you can
see<00:01:13.080> we've<00:01:13.229> got<00:01:13.350> the<00:01:13.500> net<00:01:13.710> pulled<00:01:13.979> over<00:01:14.189> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
see we've got the net pulled over so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.370 
see we've got the net pulled over so
you'll<00:01:14.400> have<00:01:14.490> a<00:01:14.580> goalie<00:01:14.820> in<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.060> net<00:01:15.210> and<00:01:15.420> you

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
you'll have a goalie in the net and you

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.050 
you'll have a goalie in the net and you
can<00:01:16.500> do<00:01:16.680> multiple<00:01:16.979> stations<00:01:17.610> or<00:01:17.729> you<00:01:17.790> can<00:01:17.909> just

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
can do multiple stations or you can just

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.039 
can do multiple stations or you can just
run<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.299> same<00:01:18.540> drill

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
run the same drill

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.499
