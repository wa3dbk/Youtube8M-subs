00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.529
 ah 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.099
 story counter 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:19.759
 a man called me the someone put in 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:21.619
 March since 2008 his idea to become 

00:00:19.759 --> 00:00:24.020
 in the master carpenter for the 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:26.419
 construction of ecological housing in 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:27.970
 the canadian ski resort of 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.210
 whistler 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:33.460
 now they already have ski chalets houses 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.739
 in the trees that look like palaces and 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:38.199
 a magical atmosphere among the forest 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.860
 which is the best place to escape 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:40.860
 from the city 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.109
 I love 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 it was an act of rebellion and what he wanted 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:10.350
 that was his contribution to the containment of 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.690
 the destruction of the planet 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.280
 joel allen seemed to point eyes 

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.680
 closed a place in the woods 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.840
 Canadians and towards there he went to 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.790
 build your home away from the hustle 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.790
 and of civilization 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:33.719
 the designer used his 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.329
 professional knowledge and since 2008 

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:38.399
 began to give the first strokes of a 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.799
 environmental eco dream that he imagined 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.170
 embedded in a tree and whose shape is 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.479
 I would go drawing to the point of materials 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:48.630
 reused able to give an appearance 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:53.000
 oval to the most particular home that 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:53.000
 someone from there would have never seen 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:03.840
 I participate, I think that people really 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.729
 like the discovery process for 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.710
 it is fascinating to find the 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.750
 secret among the forest there are some 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:11.430
 clues hidden in the website and the 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.110
 people have to make an effort to 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:14.850
 find it and I think it 's very 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 rewarding and exciting to go out to 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:19.530
 look for something so you already know for me is 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.620
 great to be able to do it is a whole 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.620
 adventure 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.950
 everything imagined the agitated mind of joel 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.280
 at least that his work was 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:36.079
 becoming a master carpenter 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.849
 inspiring of great builders that 

00:02:36.079 --> 00:02:40.489
 they would see his invention as an ingenious 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.760
 futuristic work and an example that should 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:44.690
 melt within the world of engineering 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:46.910
 residential 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.130
 the idea of ​​the oval house was made 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.560
 large before its inventor achieved 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.680
 overcome their fears for having built 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.780
 without permission on government land 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:59.000
 lacking licenses and with all the 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:00.710
 legal objections with which they are 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.650
 marked the works of character 

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.170
 subnormal the truth is that at 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:08.720
 wrapped up in that libertarian impulse that 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:11.330
 he knew he owned a few years ago he just thought 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.240
 in that in love as he loves to call his house 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.180
 it should be a distant place of easy 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:19.580
 access on foot camouflaged by the forest and 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:22.460
 completely private but now that many 

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.440
 they know her became attraction in 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:26.510
 ecological solution for future 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 housing complexes and in a 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.980
 crossroads for the authorities since 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:34.510
 they act in accordance with the laws 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:34.510
 they should knock it down 

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:41.180
 I think as a designer and builder 

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:43.190
 the industry I have the moral obligation 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.260
 of protecting the environment the impact 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.840
 which has the construction as a whole 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:49.160
 about this is important when we have 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.190
 the opportunity to use materials 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:54.020
 local to reuse them you know is 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:57.490
 a project that can contribute 

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:57.490
 positive way to the solar 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.260
 I in german knew how to document step by step 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:06.890
 your entire construction process in a 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:09.170
 website that I call at love dotcom a 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:10.959
 process of two years that went on the 

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:13.610
 search for recyclable material 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.590
 including the 200 square meters of 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:18.500
 wood required to complete the 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:20.900
 project in money went a quantity 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.790
 not at all despicable but the inventor 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.169
 he stopped doing accounts when there was 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:26.169
 spent several thousand 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:34.720
 it was that web page that 

00:04:32.919 --> 00:04:37.180
 they discovered both architects and 

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:39.729
 media and followed him the 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.250
 trace until the invention of joel is 

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:44.590
 became the standard of all that 

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:47.050
 that in that part of Canada it tends to 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:50.110
 impact as little as possible the 

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:52.479
 environment through its 'm' shape and what 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:55.030
 true is that the oval house combines the 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:57.430
 low toxicity of the materials with the 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.530
 rainwater performance and 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.900
 natural ventilation that the 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.690
 concept of green roofs with which you 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:07.660
 plans to build new housing 

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:10.389
 whistler so the station has been made 

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:12.759
 of firefighters and the certified library 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.370
 for his leadership in energy design and 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:17.830
 environment and led gold for its 

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:21.070
 passive solar heating design 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.860
 geometric and cooling system and 

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:25.479
 high efficiency heaters 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:29.220
 required within the strategy for 

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:29.220
 The protection of green in Canada 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:39.880
 in this project we try to do everything 

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:42.190
 possible to make it self-sustaining 

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.050
 I think that in the whistler area there is a 

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:46.150
 real demand sometimes for this kind of 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:50.340
 structures or in fact some of 

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.340
 size so we see it and we compare it 

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:09.070
 floors made with old woods 

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:11.530
 warehouses mills and even hangars 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.760
 aircraft paints manufactured with shallow 

00:06:11.530 --> 00:06:17.080
 levels of organic compounds 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:20.110
 volatile earth tamped windows in 

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:22.150
 fiberglass and drywall there 

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:24.310
 the most practical inventions are conjugated 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:26.320
 so that man lives in harmony with 

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:29.350
 nature in a decision 

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:32.169
 inclaudicable and quite respectful that 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.610
 joel allen knew how to inspire from 

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:35.610
 his house appeared in eggs 

00:06:40.289 --> 00:06:43.430
