00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.839
 Hi, I will tell you how I did the button 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:08.040
 Varenica immunization on his motorcycle 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:09.990
 I will tell you as much as possible with 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.240
 description of all the elements to remain 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.620
 less questions from people who are bad 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.529
 do not understand electrical 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.539
 understands the electrical circuit that you are all 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:22.529
 everything worked out quickly the first time not 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:25.580
 the question remains need less to 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.930
 at the same time earned 4 blinkers 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.929
 we need to try each on 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.430
 collar to connect with each other and 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.460
 throw them on the output wire of the relay 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.399
 turns then all four pores not 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:41.460
 developed times 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:45.170
 first we will find a relay turns me on 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.170
 motorcycle she is right here 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.300
 is such a box 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:54.930
 with two postings 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.440
 one posting is black another sulfur you have 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.379
 colors can be completely any 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.270
 in some cases they do not even match 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:06.330
 from the circuit that goes along with a motorcycle 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.130
 but the Chinese collect as they want to 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.640
 determine what is our right input and 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:12.720
 output we need a tester 

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:16.530
 be sure to include any of the 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:21.030
 level if we turn on nobody 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:25.400
 we will not find this wire check 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:29.880
 black throw on the nose 

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:34.510
 see indications of 11 6 volts and a lot 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:42.070
 a battery of fifty is planted 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:47.240
 jump gray wire readings change 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:48.980
 895 11 it means that the gray wire is and 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:54.880
 we have an output wire from the relay 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:02:00.500
 turns on which we throw on 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:02:03.350
 two wires from bortovik to find them 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.410
 I personally disassembled my control panel 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.770
 left looked what wires go 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:15.100
 on the left throw out but promo wires 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.780
 turned out to be in colors orange and blue 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:22.760
 pulled this wire see where 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:31.150
 it goes further from the remote I found it under 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:31.150
 sideways here somewhere chip disassembled 

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:51.549
 look we have a blue wire here 

00:02:46.189 --> 00:02:53.930
 in the middle is orange and gray 

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.420
 I did not sell the cut 

00:02:53.930 --> 00:03:00.819
 but ate extra posting on 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:02.930
 gap right in the bushes of this cream 

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:06.709
 neatly here pressed the tongue 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.409
 stuck out soldered and all for doing 

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:13.629
 shrink well, so as not to not remove all 

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:15.609
 it was that everything was as reliable as possible 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:18.470
 means 

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:21.650
 orange wire and blue need 

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:24.489
 interconnect to interconnect 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:29.650
 between us we need two diodes 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:32.450
 If anyone remembers the diode in one direction 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:36.169
 skips all the other side not 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:39.200
 misses but the ends of the wires we 

00:03:36.169 --> 00:03:42.709
 We cheat solder podi ode end 

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:46.669
 the diodes are soldered to each other and throw them on 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:49.040
 one posting if you are 2 increments 

00:03:46.669 --> 00:03:52.069
 wires from blue and orange just 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:53.629
 hide and then between themselves when turned on 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:55.970
 any of the turn signals you will immediately 

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:59.510
 burn and 4 and separately turn signals 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:04.159
 can not use here if you do 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:08.780
 like this 4 turn signals will work 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:09.620
 only with pressing or not pressing the button i 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:12.379
 lengthened 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:18.199
 blue and orange and lengthened sulfur 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:21.519
 the wire put on heat shrink so 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.519
 all neatly then collect 

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:30.180
 warm up 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:33.900
 and all insulated this common wire from 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:39.240
 blue and orange said curses it 

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:40.710
 wire from gray they go to the button 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.300
 took the cheapest button 

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:48.719
 12-volt latching button 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.669
 which with the indicator usually goes to 220 

00:04:48.719 --> 00:04:53.099
 volt if you take the button on 220 

00:04:50.669 --> 00:04:55.259
 Volt to put with the indicator, then rather 

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:57.240
 the whole fins burns you dimly dimly 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:05:00.289
 because the button itself will lock 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:03.319
 voltage which medium 3 to rotate 

00:05:00.289 --> 00:05:06.569
 therefore, I recommend taking the buttons 

00:05:03.319 --> 00:05:08.310
 volatility and rather all is not 

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:10.919
 there will be no indicator of fixation 

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:13.340
 sure which button to choose here already 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.020
 everyone decides for himself and accordingly 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:21.180
 depending who will put where I probably 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:23.689
 I'll put it somewhere on the plastic here 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:27.210
 here Iâ€™m probably hitting maybe 

00:05:23.689 --> 00:05:29.819
 somewhere in the dashboard but not the essence 

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:31.680
 important you can buy a button on 

00:05:29.819 --> 00:05:35.550
 two pin aliexpress or 

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.199
 three-pin lead on the steering wheel but here 

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:38.789
 already someone as you like, I took the usual 

00:05:37.199 --> 00:05:39.830
 the button is undecided as long as I am 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:43.849
 to put 

00:05:39.830 --> 00:05:43.849
 actually when you press the button 

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:55.250
 in our case it did not happen because all 

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:55.250
 what we soldered need to connect back 

00:06:01.370 --> 00:06:20.780
 I collect the chip back look here 

00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:20.780
 light up at the same time but the turn signal 

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:32.840
 push the button 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:35.270
 turn signal also do not believe when working 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:38.810
 buttons you both light up 

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:43.150
 on the instrument panel is very convenient unlikely 

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.150
 forget that you have alaric on 

00:06:44.110 --> 00:06:51.440
 here it burns separately 

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:53.360
 first turn here is a separate right if 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:56.000
 I would not put on the connection 2 wires 

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:59.600
 at the diode then when pressed 

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:02.290
 any of the tanning tanner 

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:02.290
 immediately 4 

00:07:10.469 --> 00:07:14.849
 that 's all thanks to all
