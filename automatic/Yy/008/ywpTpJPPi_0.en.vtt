this<00:03:11.129> is<00:03:11.310> basically<00:03:11.970> three<00:03:12.299> things<00:03:12.329> one<00:03:12.840> is

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
this is basically three things one is

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.949 
this is basically three things one is
your<00:03:13.769> headphone<00:03:14.159> port<00:03:14.489> here<00:03:14.879> the<00:03:15.450> other<00:03:15.659> is<00:03:15.930> a

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
your headphone port here the other is a

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.860 
your headphone port here the other is a
USB<00:03:16.650> port<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.250> the<00:03:17.340> other<00:03:17.849> is<00:03:18.180> whoops<00:03:18.690> it

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
USB port and the other is whoops it

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.720 
USB port and the other is whoops it
slipped<00:03:19.079> up<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:19.859> is<00:03:20.010> another<00:03:20.280> port<00:03:20.549> where<00:03:20.669> you
