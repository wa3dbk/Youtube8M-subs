00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.240 
because in comparable positions you
always<00:03:37.730> have<00:03:38.000> Knight<00:03:38.270> c3<00:03:38.540> and<00:03:39.110> you<00:03:39.830> don't<00:03:40.070> have

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
always have Knight c3 and you don't have

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:47.250 
always have Knight c3 and you don't have
this<00:03:40.430> year<00:03:42.430> so<00:03:43.430> maybe<00:03:43.640> this<00:03:43.880> isn't<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.420> great

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:47.260 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:54.240 

94<00:03:49.000> 94<00:03:50.000> was<00:03:50.210> a<00:03:50.240> direct<00:03:50.660> a<00:03:50.930> direct<00:03:51.920> way<00:03:52.100> to<00:03:52.160> play

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:54.250 
94 94 was a direct a direct way to play

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:58.210 
94 94 was a direct a direct way to play
the<00:03:55.250> point<00:03:55.550> is<00:03:55.730> if<00:03:56.420> white<00:03:56.810> takes<00:03:57.110> I<00:03:57.500> can<00:03:58.040> take

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
the point is if white takes I can take

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.460 
the point is if white takes I can take
him<00:03:59.590> check<00:04:01.270> yeah<00:04:02.270> another<00:04:02.630> problem<00:04:03.200> with<00:04:03.350> the

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
him check yeah another problem with the

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:08.770 
him check yeah another problem with the
setup<00:04:05.080> it's<00:04:06.080> a<00:04:06.380> however<00:04:07.130> however<00:04:07.910> if<00:04:08.450> you<00:04:08.600> look

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
setup it's a however however if you look

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:19.539 
setup it's a however however if you look
at<00:04:08.959> this<00:04:11.500> hmm<00:04:12.500> i<00:04:16.090> can<00:04:17.090> i<00:04:17.299> can<00:04:17.359> go<00:04:17.660> back<00:04:18.549> white

00:04:19.539 --> 00:04:19.549 
at this hmm i can i can go back white

00:04:19.549 --> 00:04:29.680 
at this hmm i can i can go back white
gets<00:04:19.790> many<00:04:20.209> many<00:04:20.540> 10pm<00:04:27.550> really<00:04:28.550> messy<00:04:28.910> 94<00:04:29.540> was

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690 
gets many many 10pm really messy 94 was

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.100 
gets many many 10pm really messy 94 was
interesting<00:04:30.230> as<00:04:30.320> well<00:04:30.500> but<00:04:30.680> okay<00:04:31.610> i<00:04:31.640> was<00:04:31.790> just

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
interesting as well but okay i was just

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:35.470 
interesting as well but okay i was just
playing<00:04:33.110> normal<00:04:33.710> moves<00:04:33.919> and<00:04:34.220> this<00:04:34.970> I<00:04:35.120> think<00:04:35.150> is

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
playing normal moves and this I think is

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.450 
playing normal moves and this I think is
just<00:04:35.750> not<00:04:36.230> working<00:04:36.500> I<00:04:36.890> mean<00:04:36.919> taking<00:04:39.100> it's<00:04:40.100> just

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
just not working I mean taking it's just

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:47.409 
just not working I mean taking it's just
a<00:04:41.860> double<00:04:42.860> attack<00:04:44.080> why<00:04:45.080> can<00:04:45.350> take<00:04:45.590> here<00:04:46.390> but<00:04:47.390> I

00:04:47.409 --> 00:04:47.419 
a double attack why can take here but I

00:04:47.419 --> 00:04:49.510 
a double attack why can take here but I
was<00:04:47.630> thinking<00:04:48.080> that<00:04:48.110> just<00:04:48.530> knight<00:04:48.770> c6<00:04:49.040> would

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
was thinking that just knight c6 would

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.860 
was thinking that just knight c6 would
be<00:04:49.700> sufficient

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:54.870 

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.110 

and<00:04:55.870> I<00:04:56.110> also<00:04:56.410> if<00:04:57.160> white<00:04:57.400> plays<00:04:57.580> something<00:04:57.940> like

00:04:58.110 --> 00:04:58.120 
and I also if white plays something like

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.520 
and I also if white plays something like
that<00:04:58.420> i'm<00:04:58.630> going<00:04:58.810> to<00:04:58.930> take<00:04:59.200> here<00:04:59.760> not<00:05:00.760> on<00:05:00.790> a<00:05:01.030> one

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:01.530 
that i'm going to take here not on a one

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:05.730 
that i'm going to take here not on a one
this<00:05:02.530> is<00:05:02.710> more<00:05:03.040> more<00:05:03.430> valuable<00:05:04.740> also

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
this is more more valuable also

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:09.410 
this is more more valuable also
