if<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.590> want<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.770> look<00:00:58.829> at<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.010> pictures<00:00:59.399> go

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
if you want to look at the pictures go

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.830 
if you want to look at the pictures go
there<00:00:59.850> and<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.120> reason<00:01:00.359> I'm<00:01:00.449> not<00:01:00.600> putting

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
there and the reason I'm not putting

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:01.610 
there and the reason I'm not putting
them<00:01:00.930> up<00:01:01.020> there<00:01:01.199> is<00:01:01.260> because<00:01:01.410> that<00:01:01.590> just

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
them up there is because that just

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.399 
them up there is because that just
increases<00:01:01.890> my<00:01:02.309> shitty<00:01:02.550> render<00:01:02.879> time<00:01:03.059> but

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 
increases my shitty render time but

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:05.990 
increases my shitty render time but
there's<00:01:04.409> 4<00:01:04.650> multiplayer<00:01:04.890> maps<00:01:05.280> one<00:01:05.519> zombies

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
there's 4 multiplayer maps one zombies

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.550 
there's 4 multiplayer maps one zombies
and<00:01:06.299> let's<00:01:06.450> go<00:01:06.570> over<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> multiplayer<00:01:07.260> maps

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
and let's go over the multiplayer maps

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.760 
and let's go over the multiplayer maps
there<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.860> hydro<00:01:08.400> and<00:01:08.960> when<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.320> open<00:01:10.680> up

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
there is hydro and when if you open up

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.050 
there is hydro and when if you open up
while<00:01:11.040> I'm<00:01:11.159> talking<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.580> now<00:01:11.700> and<00:01:11.820> look<00:01:11.970> at

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
while I'm talking right now and look at

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.840 
while I'm talking right now and look at
one<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.180> the<00:01:12.299> pictures<00:01:12.950> it's<00:01:13.950> a<00:01:14.310> hydroelectric

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
one of the pictures it's a hydroelectric

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.670 
one of the pictures it's a hydroelectric
dam<00:01:15.270> it's<00:01:15.780> what<00:01:15.900> it<00:01:15.990> looked<00:01:16.110> like<00:01:16.140> in<00:01:16.259> the<00:01:16.380> or

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
dam it's what it looked like in the or

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.140 
dam it's what it looked like in the or
what<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> looks<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.340> in<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.549> background<00:01:18.000> so

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
what it looks like in the background so

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.580 
what it looks like in the background so
it<00:01:18.180> looks<00:01:18.390> like<00:01:18.540> it<00:01:18.659> could<00:01:18.780> be<00:01:18.810> a<00:01:18.900> long<00:01:19.290> narrow

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
it looks like it could be a long narrow

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.410 
it looks like it could be a long narrow
type<00:01:19.890> map<00:01:20.130> and<00:01:20.369> that's<00:01:20.520> just<00:01:20.580> speculation<00:01:20.850> for

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
type map and that's just speculation for

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.320 
type map and that's just speculation for
me<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.810> the<00:01:22.710> next<00:01:22.740> map<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.369> grind<00:01:23.790> and<00:01:24.060> that<00:01:24.180> is

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
me and the next map is grind and that is

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:25.850 
me and the next map is grind and that is
a<00:01:24.360> skatepark<00:01:24.869> you<00:01:25.350> know<00:01:25.439> you<00:01:25.500> could<00:01:25.710> tell

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
a skatepark you know you could tell

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.230 
a skatepark you know you could tell
there's<00:01:26.040> ramps<00:01:26.400> in<00:01:26.520> the<00:01:26.580> backgrounds<00:01:27.090> looks

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
there's ramps in the backgrounds looks

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.490 
there's ramps in the backgrounds looks
like<00:01:27.390> that's<00:01:27.540> going<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.780> be<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:28.020> colorful

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
like that's going to be a very colorful

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:31.640 
like that's going to be a very colorful
map<00:01:28.979> I'm<00:01:29.329> downhill<00:01:30.329> this<00:01:30.810> one<00:01:31.020> looks<00:01:31.140> very

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
map I'm downhill this one looks very

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.010 
map I'm downhill this one looks very
interesting<00:01:31.909> because<00:01:32.909> as<00:01:33.299> you<00:01:33.540> guys<00:01:33.689> know<00:01:33.750> in

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
interesting because as you guys know in

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.600 
interesting because as you guys know in
my<00:01:34.110> past<00:01:34.350> few<00:01:34.530> videos<00:01:34.860> i've<00:01:35.280> talked<00:01:35.520> about

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
my past few videos i've talked about

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.609 
my past few videos i've talked about
interactive<00:01:36.329> maps<00:01:36.570> how<00:01:36.840> I<00:01:36.869> like<00:01:37.140> them<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.500> the

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
interactive maps how I like them in the

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:39.319 
interactive maps how I like them in the
original<00:01:37.860> black<00:01:38.280> ops<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:38.729> how<00:01:38.790> I<00:01:38.820> like<00:01:39.060> to<00:01:39.090> see

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
original black ops and how I like to see

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.870 
original black ops and how I like to see
some<00:01:39.600> interactive<00:01:40.110> stuff<00:01:40.320> return<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:41.009> if<00:01:41.790> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
some interactive stuff return and if you

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.179 
some interactive stuff return and if you
look<00:01:42.060> closely<00:01:42.360> it<00:01:43.020> actually<00:01:43.619> looks<00:01:43.860> like<00:01:44.070> the

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
look closely it actually looks like the

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.760 
look closely it actually looks like the
guy<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.399> sitting<00:01:44.880> on<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> cable<00:01:45.540> car<00:01:45.930> so<00:01:46.590> could

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
guy is sitting on a cable car so could

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.530 
guy is sitting on a cable car so could
that<00:01:46.799> mean<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.670> could<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.970> up<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.390> down

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
that mean that you could go up and down

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.139 
that mean that you could go up and down
the<00:01:48.720> cable<00:01:48.899> car<00:01:49.229> and<00:01:49.470> or<00:01:50.430> up<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:50.790> down<00:01:50.880> the

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the cable car and or up and down the

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:52.639 
the cable car and or up and down the
hill<00:01:51.329> on<00:01:51.570> the<00:01:51.659> cable<00:01:51.840> car<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.350> I<00:01:52.409> fight<00:01:52.619> I

hill on the cable car and I fight I

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.710 
hill on the cable car and I fight I
think<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.070> don't<00:01:53.640> know<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.729> forgot<00:01:54.149> to<00:01:54.299> mention<00:01:54.329> I

think I don't know I forgot to mention I
don't<00:01:54.899> know<00:01:54.990> but<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.950> map<00:01:56.130> is<00:01:56.250> called

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
don't know but the map is called

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:59.300 
don't know but the map is called
downhill<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.149> a<00:01:57.270> snowy<00:01:57.770> slope<00:01:58.770> e-type<00:01:59.100> map

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
downhill it's a snowy slope e-type map

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.310 
downhill it's a snowy slope e-type map
it<00:01:59.460> looks<00:01:59.490> like<00:01:59.790> so<00:02:00.060> yeah<00:02:00.719> let's<00:02:00.960> go<00:02:01.079> ahead<00:02:01.200> and

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
it looks like so yeah let's go ahead and

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.469 
it looks like so yeah let's go ahead and
move<00:02:01.380> on<00:02:01.560> to<00:02:01.649> mirage<00:02:02.100> this<00:02:02.759> is<00:02:03.030> the<00:02:03.210> last

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
move on to mirage this is the last

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.690 
move on to mirage this is the last
multiplayer<00:02:04.079> map<00:02:04.350> and<00:02:04.619> from<00:02:05.369> what<00:02:05.490> I've<00:02:05.670> heard

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
multiplayer map and from what I've heard

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.999 
multiplayer map and from what I've heard
people<00:02:06.060> have<00:02:06.299> said<00:02:06.509> this<00:02:06.659> resembles<00:02:07.320> castle

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
people have said this resembles castle

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.369 
people have said this resembles castle
from<00:02:08.399> world<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.819> war<00:02:09.030> and<00:02:09.330> it<00:02:09.840> does<00:02:10.080> actually

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
from world of war and it does actually

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:13.320 
from world of war and it does actually
kind<00:02:10.920> of<00:02:10.979> look<00:02:11.099> like<00:02:11.129> castle<00:02:11.790> but<00:02:12.510> its<00:02:12.989> kind

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
kind of look like castle but its kind

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.970 
kind of look like castle but its kind
weird<00:02:13.540> because<00:02:13.720> castle<00:02:14.350> will<00:02:14.440> be<00:02:14.560> making<00:02:14.710> its

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980 
weird because castle will be making its

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.280 
weird because castle will be making its
third<00:02:15.250> appearance<00:02:15.580> in<00:02:15.850> black<00:02:16.090> ops<00:02:16.330> are<00:02:16.960> in<00:02:17.020> the

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
third appearance in black ops are in the

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.020 
third appearance in black ops are in the
treyarch<00:02:17.890> franchise<00:02:18.460> I<00:02:18.610> mean<00:02:18.760> it<00:02:18.820> was<00:02:18.880> in

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.790 
it's going to be returning his Mirage
that<00:02:25.450> seems<00:02:25.630> a<00:02:25.720> bit<00:02:25.750> crazy<00:02:26.140> I<00:02:26.500> don't<00:02:26.680> know

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:26.800 
that seems a bit crazy I don't know

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:28.590 
that seems a bit crazy I don't know
we'll<00:02:27.190> just<00:02:27.280> have<00:02:27.400> to<00:02:27.490> wait<00:02:27.610> and<00:02:27.670> see<00:02:27.820> let's<00:02:28.450> go

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.600 
we'll just have to wait and see let's go

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:31.800 
we'll just have to wait and see let's go
over<00:02:29.230> zombies<00:02:30.160> the<00:02:30.490> map<00:02:30.700> is<00:02:30.730> called<00:02:31.120> die<00:02:31.420> riser

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
over zombies the map is called die riser

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.980 
over zombies the map is called die riser
I<00:02:32.380> know<00:02:32.830> i<00:02:32.860> watched<00:02:33.250> alireza<00:02:33.760> and<00:02:34.450> since<00:02:34.750> died

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:34.990 
I know i watched alireza and since died

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:37.950 
I know i watched alireza and since died
is<00:02:35.050> in<00:02:35.350> red<00:02:35.620> it<00:02:36.580> could<00:02:36.730> potentially<00:02:36.850> mean<00:02:37.630> or

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:37.960 
is in red it could potentially mean or

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.170 
is in red it could potentially mean or
actually<00:02:38.380> die<00:02:38.800> means<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.310> in<00:02:39.460> German<00:02:39.880> so<00:02:40.030> it

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
actually die means the in German so it

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.360 
actually die means the in German so it
could<00:02:40.300> just<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.570> for<00:02:40.840> added<00:02:41.110> effect<00:02:41.170> and<00:02:41.680> if

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
could just be for added effect and if

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:43.860 
could just be for added effect and if
you<00:02:42.460> look<00:02:42.610> closely<00:02:42.850> I<00:02:43.060> mean<00:02:43.240> a<00:02:43.270> cutter<00:02:43.480> room<00:02:43.690> it

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
you look closely I mean a cutter room it

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.500 
you look closely I mean a cutter room it
resembles<00:02:44.710> Duriez<00:02:45.310> you<00:02:45.850> know<00:02:45.970> that's<00:02:46.210> what<00:02:46.480> I

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:46.510 
resembles Duriez you know that's what I

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:47.730 
resembles Duriez you know that's what I
thought<00:02:46.720> at<00:02:46.870> first<00:02:46.900> I<00:02:47.230> was<00:02:47.410> like<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.560> weight's

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:47.740 
thought at first I was like a weight's

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:50.100 
thought at first I was like a weight's
die<00:02:47.980> rise<00:02:48.250> so<00:02:48.610> and<00:02:48.820> diamonds<00:02:49.390> the<00:02:49.630> sobe<00:02:49.960> the

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.110 
die rise so and diamonds the sobe the

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.780 
die rise so and diamonds the sobe the
rise<00:02:50.290> of<00:02:50.500> the<00:02:50.530> zombie<00:02:50.620> so<00:02:51.040> there's<00:02:51.280> no<00:02:51.400> telling

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
rise of the zombie so there's no telling

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.280 
rise of the zombie so there's no telling
whether<00:02:51.970> or<00:02:52.209> not<00:02:52.390> this<00:02:52.600> was<00:02:52.780> going<00:02:52.930> to<00:02:52.990> branch

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:53.290 
whether or not this was going to branch

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:36.210 
that's pretty cool because black ops 2
takes<00:03:34.180> place<00:03:34.420> in<00:03:34.570> 2025<00:03:35.530> that's<00:03:36.010> the

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
takes place in 2025 that's the

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.390 
takes place in 2025 that's the
multiplayer<00:03:36.670> portion<00:03:36.940> the<00:03:37.209> least<00:03:37.450> and<00:03:38.400> you

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
multiplayer portion the least and you

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.979 
multiplayer portion the least and you
know<00:03:39.519> it<00:03:39.700> would<00:03:39.820> fit<00:03:40.000> the<00:03:40.120> scenario<00:03:40.269> perfect

00:03:40.979 --> 00:03:40.989 
know it would fit the scenario perfect

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.520 
know it would fit the scenario perfect
if<00:03:41.110> it's<00:03:41.230> being<00:03:41.410> designed<00:03:41.830> 2013<00:03:42.640> 2025<00:03:43.600> I'm<00:03:44.140> it

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.530 
if it's being designed 2013 2025 I'm it

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:46.380 
if it's being designed 2013 2025 I'm it
be<00:03:44.680> a<00:03:44.709> future<00:03:45.040> weapon<00:03:45.519> and<00:03:45.760> it<00:03:46.090> just<00:03:46.239> seems

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
be a future weapon and it just seems

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.000 
be a future weapon and it just seems
like<00:03:46.480> it<00:03:46.630> fit<00:03:46.810> the<00:03:46.930> scenario<00:03:47.050> perfect<00:03:47.769> but<00:03:47.920> if

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:48.010 
like it fit the scenario perfect but if

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:50.009 
like it fit the scenario perfect but if
you<00:03:48.070> look<00:03:48.190> deep<00:03:48.400> into<00:03:48.580> it<00:03:48.820> how<00:03:49.330> would<00:03:49.390> they<00:03:49.660> fit

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
you look deep into it how would they fit

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.509 
you look deep into it how would they fit
a<00:03:51.300> new<00:03:52.300> weapon<00:03:52.780> into<00:03:53.170> multiplayer<00:03:53.500> adding<00:03:54.430> it

00:03:54.509 --> 00:03:54.519 
a new weapon into multiplayer adding it

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.040 
a new weapon into multiplayer adding it
in<00:03:54.640> as<00:03:54.820> a<00:03:54.850> submachine<00:03:55.450> gun<00:03:55.630> I<00:03:55.660> mean<00:03:55.840> what<00:03:55.959> if

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
in as a submachine gun I mean what if

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:57.540 
in as a submachine gun I mean what if
you<00:03:56.170> already<00:03:56.320> have<00:03:56.530> diamond<00:03:56.860> camos<00:03:57.250> for<00:03:57.430> those

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:57.550 
you already have diamond camos for those

00:03:57.550 --> 00:03:59.640 
you already have diamond camos for those
like<00:03:57.760> me<00:03:57.910> you<00:03:58.480> know<00:03:58.630> what<00:03:58.900> how's<00:03:59.320> that<00:03:59.530> going

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
like me you know what how's that going

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.380 
like me you know what how's that going
to<00:03:59.680> work<00:03:59.739> out<00:04:00.040> I<00:04:00.250> was<00:04:00.400> thinking<00:04:00.790> they<00:04:01.030> if<00:04:01.239> they

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
to work out I was thinking they if they

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.690 
to work out I was thinking they if they
added<00:04:01.660> in<00:04:01.780> a<00:04:01.840> multiplayer<00:04:02.140> um<00:04:02.560> they<00:04:03.459> would

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
added in a multiplayer um they would

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:06.630 
added in a multiplayer um they would
make<00:04:03.910> it<00:04:04.180> to<00:04:04.540> like<00:04:04.930> a<00:04:04.959> DLC<00:04:05.650> portion<00:04:06.160> playlist

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
make it to like a DLC portion playlist

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.580 
make it to like a DLC portion playlist
for<00:04:06.820> weapons<00:04:07.150> and<00:04:07.300> stuff<00:04:07.510> in<00:04:07.660> hdl-c<00:04:08.050> maybe<00:04:08.410> add

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:08.590 
for weapons and stuff in hdl-c maybe add

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:10.590 
for weapons and stuff in hdl-c maybe add
one<00:04:08.800> more<00:04:08.920> weapon<00:04:09.130> but<00:04:09.880> the<00:04:09.970> Peacekeeper<00:04:10.570> SMG

was<00:04:31.480> actually<00:04:31.990> released<00:04:32.350> and<00:04:32.860> they<00:04:33.070> were

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.130 
was actually released and they were

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:35.520 
was actually released and they were
legit<00:04:33.610> so<00:04:33.940> I<00:04:34.150> think<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.840> this<00:04:35.200> is<00:04:35.350> pretty

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
legit so I think that this is pretty

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:39.270 
legit so I think that this is pretty
much<00:04:35.620> real<00:04:36.010> but<00:04:36.850> the<00:04:37.680> Peacekeeper<00:04:38.680> SMG<00:04:38.710> has

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
much real but the Peacekeeper SMG has

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:42.090 
much real but the Peacekeeper SMG has
got<00:04:39.580> me<00:04:39.760> going<00:04:40.570> crazy<00:04:40.600> and<00:04:41.110> that's<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.890> cool
