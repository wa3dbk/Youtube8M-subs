keep the trussing high enough where

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.819 
keep the trussing high enough where
anybody<00:00:44.850> doesn't<00:00:45.719> run<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> risk<00:00:46.260> of<00:00:46.379> trying

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
anybody doesn't run the risk of trying

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.299 
anybody doesn't run the risk of trying

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
to jump and grab it and hang on it now

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.590 
to jump and grab it and hang on it now
if<00:00:50.399> you're<00:00:50.520> to<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.789> that<00:00:51.000> then<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.239> would<00:00:51.390> want

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
if you're to do that then you would want

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.170 
if you're to do that then you would want
to<00:00:51.660> go<00:00:51.780> at<00:00:52.050> least<00:00:52.170> 12<00:00:52.649> feet<00:00:52.890> across<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:54.000> dance

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
to go at least 12 feet across the dance

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.840 
to go at least 12 feet across the dance
floor<00:00:54.329> or<00:00:57.230> get<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.410> six<00:00:59.070> footers<00:00:59.430> and<00:00:59.460> put<00:00:59.820> a

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
floor or get to six footers and put a

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.609 
floor or get to six footers and put a
4-footer<00:01:00.680> so<00:01:01.680> it'd<00:01:01.829> be<00:01:01.949> nice<00:01:02.190> and<00:01:02.430> long<00:01:03.619> that

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
4-footer so it'd be nice and long that

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:05.660 
4-footer so it'd be nice and long that
way<00:01:04.739> it<00:01:04.860> would<00:01:04.979> stretch<00:01:05.280> all<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.489> way<00:01:05.580> across

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
way it would stretch all the way across

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.370 
way it would stretch all the way across
and<00:01:06.150> then<00:01:06.210> as<00:01:06.420> far<00:01:06.600> as<00:01:06.750> the<00:01:06.840> base<00:01:07.020> plates<00:01:07.290> I

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
and then as far as the base plates I

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.429 
and then as far as the base plates I
wouldn't<00:01:07.680> use<00:01:07.970> if<00:01:08.970> you're<00:01:09.689> going<00:01:09.810> to<00:01:09.869> go<00:01:10.080> into

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
wouldn't use if you're going to go into

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:13.359 
wouldn't use if you're going to go into
the<00:01:10.830> dance<00:01:11.040> floor<00:01:11.280> these<00:01:11.880> two<00:01:12.600> foot<00:01:12.840> square

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:13.369 
the dance floor these two foot square

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:16.969 
the dance floor these two foot square
base<00:01:14.369> plates<00:01:14.700> i<00:01:14.909> would<00:01:15.060> go<00:01:15.390> with<00:01:15.420> a<00:01:15.930> minimum<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
base plates i would go with a minimum of

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.950 
base plates i would go with a minimum of
three<00:01:17.430> foot<00:01:17.670> square<00:01:17.970> or<00:01:18.150> four<00:01:18.450> foot<00:01:18.600> square

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
three foot square or four foot square

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.200 
three foot square or four foot square
but<00:01:19.890> three<00:01:20.100> foot<00:01:20.280> square<00:01:20.549> would<00:01:20.729> probably<00:01:21.090> be

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
but three foot square would probably be

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.510 
but three foot square would probably be
