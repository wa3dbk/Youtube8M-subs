00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
cards the frustration of finding a

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.760 
cards the frustration of finding a
formation<00:01:54.030> card<00:01:54.420> can<00:01:54.659> take<00:01:54.899> a<00:01:54.930> long<00:01:55.259> time<00:01:55.290> to

formation card can take a long time to

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:57.920 
formation card can take a long time to
get<00:01:55.979> it<00:01:56.100> at<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.219> right<00:01:56.280> price<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.969> I'm<00:01:57.750> just

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930 
get it at the right price and I'm just

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.440 
get it at the right price and I'm just
thinking<00:01:57.990> of<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.640> of<00:01:59.640> course<00:01:59.820> put<00:02:00.329> your

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
thinking of that of course put your

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.929 
thinking of that of course put your
opinions<00:02:00.750> down<00:02:00.930> there<00:02:01.140> and<00:02:01.320> another<00:02:02.250> thing<00:02:02.399> is

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
opinions down there and another thing is

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:04.969 
opinions down there and another thing is
a<00:02:03.210> stat<00:02:03.719> search<00:02:04.020> and<00:02:04.500> I<00:02:04.530> think<00:02:04.799> this<00:02:04.920> is

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
a stat search and I think this is

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:08.059 
a stat search and I think this is
absolutely<00:02:05.969> no<00:02:06.090> problem<00:02:06.360> at<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.890> rinses<00:02:07.890> if

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
absolutely no problem at all rinses if

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.320

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.130 
overall for everybody then that'd be a
great<00:05:04.980> addition<00:05:05.940> to<00:05:06.180> it<00:05:06.390> and<00:05:06.480> it<00:05:06.570> did<00:05:06.750> it

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:07.140 
great addition to it and it did it

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.080 
great addition to it and it did it
wasn't<00:05:07.440> in<00:05:07.500> fifa<00:05:07.890> 11<00:05:08.100> but<00:05:08.520> some<00:05:08.730> reason<00:05:09.000> they

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
wasn't in fifa 11 but some reason they

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:14.210 
wasn't in fifa 11 but some reason they
just<00:05:09.240> removed<00:05:09.990> it<00:05:10.200> in<00:05:10.380> fifa<00:05:10.770> 12<00:05:11.450> so<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:13.220> I

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:14.220 
just removed it in fifa 12 so that I

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.880 
just removed it in fifa 12 so that I
want<00:05:14.430> them<00:05:14.520> to<00:05:14.640> bring<00:05:14.790> that<00:05:14.910> back<00:05:15.290> i<00:05:16.290> would

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:16.890 
want them to bring that back i would

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.719 
want them to bring that back i would
also<00:05:16.919> like<00:05:17.520> them<00:05:18.210> to<00:05:18.510> fix<00:05:18.810> price<00:05:19.320> fixing<00:05:19.919> I<00:05:20.130> see

00:05:20.719 --> 00:05:20.729 
also like them to fix price fixing I see

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:22.219 
also like them to fix price fixing I see
I<00:05:20.760> was<00:05:20.910> just<00:05:21.090> some<00:05:21.270> people<00:05:21.630> on<00:05:21.690> the<00:05:21.750> market<00:05:22.080> but

00:05:22.219 --> 00:05:22.229 
I was just some people on the market but

00:05:22.229 --> 00:05:24.409 
I was just some people on the market but
I<00:05:22.470> would<00:05:22.950> think<00:05:23.130> it's<00:05:23.520> fairly<00:05:23.880> easy<00:05:24.030> to<00:05:24.240> a

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
I would think it's fairly easy to a

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:26.120 
I would think it's fairly easy to a
fixed<00:05:25.050> price<00:05:25.169> fixing<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:25.770> just<00:05:25.950> say<00:05:26.100> a

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:26.130 
fixed price fixing you just say a

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:28.820 
fixed price fixing you just say a
maximum<00:05:26.760> of<00:05:26.910> three<00:05:27.210> players<00:05:27.510> per<00:05:28.020> account<00:05:28.590> of

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830 
maximum of three players per account of

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.400 
maximum of three players per account of
a<00:05:28.919> certain<00:05:29.340> player<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.810> I<00:05:30.870> would<00:05:31.169> only<00:05:31.260> be

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:31.410 
a certain player so I would only be

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:33.440 
a certain player so I would only be
allowed<00:05:31.500> three<00:05:32.280> Welbeck's<00:05:32.669> so<00:05:32.910> for<00:05:33.210> me<00:05:33.300> to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:33.450 
allowed three Welbeck's so for me to

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:34.940 
allowed three Welbeck's so for me to
price<00:05:33.660> fix<00:05:33.870> the<00:05:33.960> market<00:05:34.260> would<00:05:34.350> be<00:05:34.590> pretty

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950 
price fix the market would be pretty

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:36.620 
price fix the market would be pretty
much<00:05:35.010> impossible<00:05:35.280> of<00:05:36.090> course<00:05:36.300> it's<00:05:36.419> going<00:05:36.570> to

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:36.630 
much impossible of course it's going to

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.320 
much impossible of course it's going to
be<00:05:36.720> possible<00:05:37.590> if<00:05:38.010> you<00:05:38.100> have<00:05:38.220> 10<00:05:38.790> people<00:05:38.940> doing

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:39.330 
be possible if you have 10 people doing

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:40.940 
be possible if you have 10 people doing
it<00:05:39.419> and<00:05:39.450> they<00:05:39.570> have<00:05:39.660> 30<00:05:39.900> cards<00:05:40.290> there<00:05:40.470> you<00:05:40.830> go

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950 
it and they have 30 cards there you go

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:42.200 
it and they have 30 cards there you go
but<00:05:41.130> that<00:05:41.250> is<00:05:41.340> going<00:05:41.460> to<00:05:41.520> be<00:05:41.610> hard<00:05:41.790> to<00:05:41.880> sort<00:05:42.090> out

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:42.210 
but that is going to be hard to sort out

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:44.659 
but that is going to be hard to sort out
and<00:05:42.450> fix<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:43.710> it<00:05:43.950> would<00:05:44.039> overall<00:05:44.340> make<00:05:44.550> the

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:44.669 
and fix so it would overall make the

00:05:44.669 --> 00:05:46.850 
and fix so it would overall make the
market<00:05:45.030> much<00:05:45.300> more<00:05:45.510> stable<00:05:45.810> I<00:05:46.110> think<00:05:46.320> instead

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
market much more stable I think instead

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:50.620 
market much more stable I think instead
of<00:05:46.979> cad<00:05:47.520> being<00:05:47.789> randomly<00:05:48.210> overpriced<00:05:48.750> and

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:50.630 
of cad being randomly overpriced and

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.760 
of cad being randomly overpriced and
unaffordable<00:05:51.630> to<00:05:51.900> people<00:05:52.320> who<00:05:52.380> don't<00:05:52.740> have

00:05:52.760 --> 00:05:52.770 
unaffordable to people who don't have

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:56.180 
unaffordable to people who don't have
that<00:05:52.979> one<00:05:53.010> with<00:05:53.190> coinage<00:05:55.010> another<00:05:56.010> thing

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
that one with coinage another thing

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:58.159 
that one with coinage another thing
would<00:05:56.340> be<00:05:56.490> maybe<00:05:56.789> to<00:05:57.120> allow<00:05:57.360> us<00:05:57.539> to<00:05:57.660> change<00:05:57.930> our

00:05:58.159 --> 00:05:58.169 
would be maybe to allow us to change our

00:05:58.169 --> 00:05:59.990 
would be maybe to allow us to change our
team<00:05:58.500> name<00:05:58.770> and<00:05:59.100> it's<00:05:59.580> not<00:05:59.729> that<00:05:59.880> bothered

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:00.000 
team name and it's not that bothered

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.909 
team name and it's not that bothered
really<00:06:00.419> you<00:06:00.870> pick<00:06:01.050> your<00:06:01.080> name<00:06:01.289> that's<00:06:01.500> it<00:06:01.680> but

00:06:01.909 --> 00:06:01.919 
really you pick your name that's it but

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:03.320 
really you pick your name that's it but
you<00:06:02.250> know<00:06:02.340> it's<00:06:02.460> just<00:06:02.550> a<00:06:02.669> little<00:06:02.789> dish<00:06:03.030> in<00:06:03.180> that

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:03.330 
you know it's just a little dish in that

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:04.460 
you know it's just a little dish in that
could<00:06:03.570> make<00:06:03.780> people<00:06:04.080> a<00:06:04.110> little<00:06:04.169> bit<00:06:04.320> more

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:04.470 
could make people a little bit more

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:06.500 
could make people a little bit more
happy<00:06:04.800> and<00:06:05.010> want<00:06:05.550> to<00:06:05.700> get<00:06:05.910> all<00:06:06.030> missing<00:06:06.360> and

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:06.510 
happy and want to get all missing and

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.340 
happy and want to get all missing and
flails<00:06:06.810> my<00:06:06.930> team<00:06:07.140> and<00:06:07.729> and<00:06:09.080> another<00:06:10.080> thing<00:06:10.200> is

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:10.350 
flails my team and and another thing is

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:12.230 
flails my team and and another thing is
the<00:06:10.380> leaderboards<00:06:11.160> think<00:06:11.820> what<00:06:11.970> I've<00:06:12.120> done

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:12.240 
the leaderboards think what I've done

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.460 
the leaderboards think what I've done
for<00:06:12.570> the<00:06:12.630> leaderboard<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:12.990> really<00:06:13.169> good<00:06:13.289> so

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:13.470 
for the leaderboard is really good so

00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:15.290 
for the leaderboard is really good so
far<00:06:13.680> and<00:06:13.950> I<00:06:14.039> think<00:06:14.280> just<00:06:14.520> some<00:06:14.640> more<00:06:14.729> diversity

00:06:15.290 --> 00:06:15.300 
far and I think just some more diversity

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:17.450 
far and I think just some more diversity
maybe<00:06:15.660> to<00:06:16.320> allow<00:06:16.710> people<00:06:16.740> to<00:06:17.190> look<00:06:17.280> at

00:06:17.450 --> 00:06:17.460 
maybe to allow people to look at

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:19.010 
maybe to allow people to look at
people's<00:06:17.789> winter<00:06:18.090> lost<00:06:18.240> records<00:06:18.419> that'll<00:06:18.960> be

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
people's winter lost records that'll be

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.100 
people's winter lost records that'll be
quite<00:06:19.169> good<00:06:19.880> how<00:06:20.880> many<00:06:21.450> times<00:06:21.600> in<00:06:21.780> a<00:06:21.870> day<00:06:22.080> I

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:22.110 
quite good how many times in a day I

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:25.460 
quite good how many times in a day I
don't<00:06:22.440> know<00:06:22.610> just<00:06:23.610> something<00:06:24.180> too<00:06:24.450> deep<00:06:25.050> in

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:25.470 
don't know just something too deep in

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.260 
don't know just something too deep in
further<00:06:25.740> deepen<00:06:26.250> the<00:06:26.370> leaderboard<00:06:26.789> so<00:06:27.030> mate

00:06:27.260 --> 00:06:27.270 
further deepen the leaderboard so mate

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.760 
further deepen the leaderboard so mate
makes<00:06:27.600> it<00:06:27.720> feel<00:06:28.260> more<00:06:28.320> like<00:06:28.470> an<00:06:28.680> actual

00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:28.770 
makes it feel more like an actual

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.469 
makes it feel more like an actual
leaderboard<00:06:29.750> the<00:06:31.039> last<00:06:32.039> one<00:06:32.190> here<00:06:32.580> i<00:06:32.760> have<00:06:33.300> is

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:33.479 
leaderboard the last one here i have is

00:06:33.479 --> 00:06:35.029 
leaderboard the last one here i have is
really<00:06:33.960> i<00:06:33.990> think<00:06:34.200> important<00:06:34.740> for<00:06:34.830> the<00:06:34.890> next

00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:35.039 
really i think important for the next

00:06:35.039 --> 00:06:37.010 
really i think important for the next
one<00:06:35.220> to<00:06:35.400> make<00:06:35.789> people<00:06:36.180> want<00:06:36.360> to<00:06:36.479> combat<00:06:36.720> all<00:06:36.750> my

00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:37.020 
one to make people want to combat all my

00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:40.490 
one to make people want to combat all my
team<00:06:37.229> is<00:06:37.409> a<00:06:37.710> faster<00:06:38.280> way<00:06:38.460> to<00:06:38.729> traverse<00:06:39.720> the

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
team is a faster way to traverse the

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.360 
team is a faster way to traverse the
ever

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:41.370
