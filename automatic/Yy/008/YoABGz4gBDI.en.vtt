review on which is a new lacrosse head

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.990 
review on which is a new lacrosse head
from<00:00:18.000> sts<00:00:18.680> designed<00:00:19.680> for<00:00:19.890> defenseman<00:00:20.250> so<00:00:20.940> it

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
from sts designed for defenseman so it

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.359 
from sts designed for defenseman so it
was<00:00:21.150> really<00:00:21.330> nice<00:00:21.570> that<00:00:21.630> someone<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:23.010> finally

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:23.369 
was really nice that someone is finally

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:25.160 
was really nice that someone is finally
decided<00:00:23.970> ahead<00:00:24.240> specifically<00:00:24.930> for

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
decided ahead specifically for

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.900 
decided ahead specifically for
defenseman<00:00:25.530> seems<00:00:26.280> like<00:00:26.430> they<00:00:26.550> put<00:00:26.670> a<00:00:26.730> lot<00:00:26.880> of

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
defenseman seems like they put a lot of

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.640 
defenseman seems like they put a lot of
thought<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.450> into<00:00:27.870> it<00:00:28.020> and<00:00:28.170> a<00:00:28.260> lot<00:00:28.350> of<00:00:28.410> zine

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:28.650 
thought in it into it and a lot of zine

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.330 
thought in it into it and a lot of zine
a<00:00:29.240> initial<00:00:30.240> reaction<00:00:30.920> pulling<00:00:31.920> on<00:00:32.040> the<00:00:32.129> box

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
a initial reaction pulling on the box

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.340 
a initial reaction pulling on the box
it's<00:00:32.610> definitely<00:00:33.000> stiff<00:00:33.270> so<00:00:33.930> i<00:00:33.960> really<00:00:34.260> like

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
it's definitely stiff so i really like

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:36.470 
it's definitely stiff so i really like
that<00:00:34.559> a<00:00:34.829> problem<00:00:35.309> i<00:00:35.460> always<00:00:35.760> had<00:00:35.940> with<00:00:36.239> all<00:00:36.390> the

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
that a problem i always had with all the

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.630 
that a problem i always had with all the
heads<00:00:36.660> i<00:00:36.750> buy<00:00:36.930> is<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.890> when<00:00:38.070> I<00:00:38.160> poke<00:00:38.399> check

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
heads i buy is that when I poke check

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.000 
heads i buy is that when I poke check
they're<00:00:39.600> too<00:00:39.750> flexible<00:00:40.290> and<00:00:40.530> so<00:00:40.770> that<00:00:40.920> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
they're too flexible and so that it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.850 
they're too flexible and so that it
tends<00:00:41.220> to<00:00:41.340> flare<00:00:41.730> out<00:00:41.760> up<00:00:42.150> top<00:00:42.360> and<00:00:42.660> pinched<00:00:43.560> in

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
tends to flare out up top and pinched in

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.830 
tends to flare out up top and pinched in
the<00:00:44.010> bottom<00:00:44.340> and<00:00:44.490> so<00:00:45.240> then<00:00:45.390> what<00:00:45.510> happens<00:00:45.780> is

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
the bottom and so then what happens is

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.020 
the bottom and so then what happens is
thick<00:00:46.050> becomes<00:00:46.350> illegal<00:00:46.560> at<00:00:46.770> the<00:00:47.430> bottom<00:00:47.850> and

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
thick becomes illegal at the bottom and

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:50.620 
thick becomes illegal at the bottom and
then<00:00:48.450> I<00:00:48.570> get<00:00:48.900> a<00:00:48.930> lot<00:00:49.140> of<00:00:49.170> breakage<00:00:49.710> up<00:00:49.980> here<00:00:50.370> arm

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:50.630 
then I get a lot of breakage up here arm

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.540 
then I get a lot of breakage up here arm
and<00:00:51.710> puts<00:00:52.710> a<00:00:52.739> lot<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:52.920> pressure<00:00:53.220> when<00:00:53.430> it

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and puts a lot of pressure when it

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.250 
and puts a lot of pressure when it
flares<00:00:53.730> out<00:00:53.970> and<00:00:54.239> tends<00:00:54.450> to<00:00:54.570> break<00:00:54.780> up<00:00:55.020> in<00:00:55.170> this

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
flares out and tends to break up in this

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.440 
flares out and tends to break up in this
area<00:00:55.320> so<00:00:55.820> rude<00:00:56.820> like<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.090> fact<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.360> it's

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
area so rude like the fact that it's

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.229 
area so rude like the fact that it's
stiff<00:00:57.810> that<00:00:58.079> should<00:00:58.200> be<00:00:58.260> really<00:00:58.440> nice<00:00:58.680> and<00:00:59.239> my

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
stiff that should be really nice and my

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.270 
stiff that should be really nice and my
other<00:01:00.510> first<00:01:01.350> reaction<00:01:01.800> was<00:01:01.980> that<00:01:02.040> it's

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
other first reaction was that it's

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.999 
other first reaction was that it's
actually<00:01:02.460> really<00:01:02.760> wide<00:01:03.059> so<00:01:03.870> I'm<00:01:04.379> compared<00:01:04.920> to

00:01:04.999 --> 00:01:05.009 
actually really wide so I'm compared to

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.789 
actually really wide so I'm compared to
what<00:01:05.129> I<00:01:05.159> play<00:01:05.399> with<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:06.000> either<00:01:06.360> TI<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:07.170> if

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:07.799 
what I play with now is either TI and if

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:09.740 
what I play with now is either TI and if
you<00:01:07.890> compare<00:01:08.310> them<00:01:08.369> face<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.759> face<00:01:09.030> you<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
you compare them face to face you can

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.320 
you compare them face to face you can
see<00:01:09.930> how<00:01:10.110> much<00:01:10.290> wider<00:01:10.590> it<00:01:10.979> is<00:01:11.159> armed<00:01:11.490> and

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
see how much wider it is armed and

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.969 
see how much wider it is armed and
especially<00:01:12.810> this<00:01:12.990> is<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.170> either<00:01:13.350> TI<00:01:13.680> tens

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
especially this is the either TI tens

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.590 
especially this is the either TI tens
that<00:01:14.100> really<00:01:14.280> flare<00:01:14.610> out<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.090> bottom<00:01:15.240> here

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
that really flare out in the bottom here

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.950 
that really flare out in the bottom here
inside<00:01:16.049> um<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:17.450> stays<00:01:18.450> pretty<00:01:18.630> straight

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
inside um this stays pretty straight

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.930 
inside um this stays pretty straight
down<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.320> tends<00:01:19.470> to<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.620> pretty<00:01:19.650> wide<00:01:20.010> i<00:01:20.190> know

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:20.940 
down and tends to be pretty wide i know

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:22.850 
down and tends to be pretty wide i know
a<00:01:21.060> lot<00:01:21.150> of<00:01:21.299> defenders<00:01:21.720> prefer<00:01:22.110> wide<00:01:22.350> heads<00:01:22.650> um

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
a lot of defenders prefer wide heads um

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.460 
a lot of defenders prefer wide heads um
and<00:01:23.790> I've<00:01:24.000> really<00:01:24.570> never<00:01:24.690> played<00:01:25.080> with<00:01:25.229> white

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:25.470 
and I've really never played with white

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:27.950 
and I've really never played with white
head<00:01:25.650> of<00:01:26.030> since<00:01:27.030> high<00:01:27.390> school<00:01:27.420> I<00:01:27.720> played<00:01:27.900> of

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
head of since high school I played of

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.500 
head of since high school I played of
the<00:01:28.020> proton<00:01:28.409> and<00:01:28.590> that<00:01:29.190> was<00:01:29.310> a<00:01:29.340> wider<00:01:29.850> head<00:01:30.119> I

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
the proton and that was a wider head I

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.300 
the proton and that was a wider head I
like<00:01:30.900> playing<00:01:31.080> with<00:01:31.229> water<00:01:31.409> head<00:01:31.740> because<00:01:32.100> it

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:32.310 
like playing with water head because it

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:34.580 
like playing with water head because it
allows<00:01:32.580> the<00:01:32.909> head<00:01:33.090> to<00:01:33.330> pinch<00:01:34.080> more<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.500> you

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
allows the head to pinch more when you

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.410 
allows the head to pinch more when you
poke<00:01:34.799> check<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.250> when<00:01:35.490> it<00:01:35.610> kind<00:01:35.850> of<00:01:35.940> deforms

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
poke check and when it kind of deforms

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.080 
poke check and when it kind of deforms
it<00:01:36.570> it<00:01:36.810> gets<00:01:37.170> to<00:01:37.350> the<00:01:37.439> way<00:01:37.560> you<00:01:37.619> like<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
it it gets to the way you like it the

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.280 
it it gets to the way you like it the
reason<00:01:39.330> why<00:01:39.420> I<00:01:39.450> didn't<00:01:39.689> play<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.869> Whitehead

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
reason why I didn't play the Whitehead

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.469 
reason why I didn't play the Whitehead
college<00:01:40.680> is<00:01:40.830> because<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:41.760> played<00:01:42.090> a<00:01:42.119> lot<00:01:42.330> of

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
college is because I played a lot of

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.240 
college is because I played a lot of
long<00:01:42.659> stick<00:01:42.900> mini<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.770> I<00:01:43.830> like<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.070> go<00:01:44.189> to

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
long stick mini and I like to go to

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:45.859 
long stick mini and I like to go to
carry<00:01:44.490> the<00:01:44.610> ball<00:01:44.760> feel<00:01:45.090> and<00:01:45.270> be<00:01:45.360> an<00:01:45.420> offensive

carry the ball feel and be an offensive

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:49.070 
carry the ball feel and be an offensive
threat<00:01:45.930> as<00:01:46.200> well<00:01:46.380> so<00:01:47.040> I'm<00:01:47.670> interested<00:01:48.420> how<00:01:48.930> it

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.080 
threat as well so I'm interested how it

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.260 
threat as well so I'm interested how it
strings<00:01:49.409> up<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.920> how<00:01:50.520> I<00:01:50.549> like<00:01:50.880> playing<00:01:51.030> with

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
strings up and how I like playing with

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
strings up and how I like playing with
it<00:01:51.479> I'm<00:01:51.869> gonna<00:01:52.170> prolly<00:01:52.500> string<00:01:52.830> it<00:01:52.920> up<00:01:52.979> with

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
it I'm gonna prolly string it up with

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:56.179 
it I'm gonna prolly string it up with
six<00:01:53.850> diamond<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.450> way<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.600> like<00:01:54.900> to<00:01:55.189> four

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
six diamond the way I like to four

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:59.120 
six diamond the way I like to four
defenders<00:01:56.520> get<00:01:56.880> good<00:01:57.090> hold<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.830> so<00:01:58.830> will<00:01:58.979> feel

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
defenders get good hold and so will feel

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.280 
defenders get good hold and so will feel
that<00:01:59.250> guys<00:01:59.400> so<00:01:59.700> on<00:01:59.909> the<00:02:00.600> first<00:02:00.810> thing<00:02:01.080> that<00:02:01.229> I

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
that guys so on the first thing that I

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.399 
that guys so on the first thing that I
before<00:02:01.740> in<00:02:02.009> defensive<00:02:02.670> head<00:02:02.820> is<00:02:03.720> I<00:02:04.140> look<00:02:04.320> at

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
before in defensive head is I look at

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.560 
before in defensive head is I look at
the<00:02:04.500> sidewall<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.579> I<00:02:05.610> want<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.970> see<00:02:06.119> if<00:02:06.390> it

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
the sidewall so I want to see if it

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.029 
the sidewall so I want to see if it
looks<00:02:06.780> like<00:02:06.960> there's<00:02:07.140> going<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.350> be<00:02:07.380> any<00:02:07.500> weak

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
looks like there's going to be any weak

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.190 
looks like there's going to be any weak
points<00:02:08.069> in<00:02:08.610> the<00:02:08.729> sidewall<00:02:09.149> with<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> head<00:02:10.019> could

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
points in the sidewall with a head could

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.949 
points in the sidewall with a head could
snap<00:02:10.439> arm<00:02:10.760> you<00:02:11.760> know<00:02:11.790> if<00:02:12.090> you<00:02:12.360> can<00:02:12.510> see<00:02:12.689> I've

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
snap arm you know if you can see I've

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:15.679 
snap arm you know if you can see I've
broken<00:02:13.290> a<00:02:13.530> lot<00:02:13.709> of<00:02:13.920> UTIs<00:02:14.519> even<00:02:15.150> with<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
broken a lot of UTIs even with the

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:19.100 
broken a lot of UTIs even with the
titanium<00:02:16.380> arm<00:02:16.760> right<00:02:17.760> up<00:02:17.940> here<00:02:18.180> but<00:02:18.720> I<00:02:18.750> like

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
titanium arm right up here but I like

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.360 
titanium arm right up here but I like
the<00:02:19.170> head<00:02:19.470> right<00:02:19.800> now<00:02:19.830> they're<00:02:20.099> pretty<00:02:20.310> cheap

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
the head right now they're pretty cheap

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:21.510 
the head right now they're pretty cheap
so<00:02:20.849> I

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
so I

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:24.090 
so I
picked<00:02:21.850> up<00:02:21.940> a<00:02:22.030> couple<00:02:22.210> but<00:02:22.900> um<00:02:23.110> so<00:02:23.410> right<00:02:23.740> here

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
picked up a couple but um so right here

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:25.380 
picked up a couple but um so right here
where<00:02:24.340> you<00:02:24.400> can<00:02:24.460> see<00:02:24.520> doesn't<00:02:24.970> have<00:02:25.090> a<00:02:25.120> lot<00:02:25.360> of

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
where you can see doesn't have a lot of

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.940 
where you can see doesn't have a lot of
sidewall<00:02:25.690> space<00:02:26.050> and<00:02:26.290> this<00:02:26.440> is<00:02:26.560> just<00:02:26.650> kind<00:02:26.830> of

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
sidewall space and this is just kind of

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:28.980 
sidewall space and this is just kind of
turn<00:02:27.340> I<00:02:27.550> know<00:02:27.850> it's<00:02:28.090> got<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.210> titanium<00:02:28.570> minute

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:28.990 
turn I know it's got a titanium minute

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:31.320 
turn I know it's got a titanium minute
which<00:02:29.140> does<00:02:29.350> help<00:02:29.620> but<00:02:30.190> I<00:02:30.220> definitely<00:02:30.940> broke

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
which does help but I definitely broke

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.120 
which does help but I definitely broke
two<00:02:31.600> or<00:02:31.720> three<00:02:31.900> days<00:02:32.050> in<00:02:32.290> college<00:02:32.710> even<00:02:33.040> with

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
two or three days in college even with

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.920 
two or three days in college even with
the<00:02:33.220> titanium<00:02:33.670> so<00:02:34.180> when<00:02:34.360> you<00:02:34.420> can<00:02:34.540> see<00:02:34.720> down

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:34.930 
the titanium so when you can see down

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:36.870 
the titanium so when you can see down
here<00:02:35.140> on<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.320> bottom<00:02:35.380> it's<00:02:35.980> got<00:02:36.190> a<00:02:36.220> nice<00:02:36.400> thick

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:36.880 
here on the bottom it's got a nice thick

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:39.300 
here on the bottom it's got a nice thick
area<00:02:37.180> and<00:02:37.540> so<00:02:38.080> it's<00:02:38.290> less<00:02:38.650> tendency<00:02:38.980> to<00:02:39.160> break

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
area and so it's less tendency to break

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:41.040 
area and so it's less tendency to break
it<00:02:39.520> there<00:02:39.730> when<00:02:39.970> in<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.330> cold<00:02:40.540> weather<00:02:40.720> when

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
it there when in the cold weather when

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:43.200 
it there when in the cold weather when
it<00:02:41.140> could<00:02:41.260> snap<00:02:41.500> and<00:02:41.710> stuff<00:02:41.860> like<00:02:41.980> that<00:02:42.040> so<00:02:42.940> I'm

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:43.210 
it could snap and stuff like that so I'm

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:45.510 
it could snap and stuff like that so I'm
looking<00:02:43.420> at<00:02:43.600> this<00:02:43.660> head<00:02:44.020> I<00:02:44.200> like<00:02:44.710> up<00:02:44.920> top<00:02:45.190> where

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
looking at this head I like up top where

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.250 
looking at this head I like up top where
I<00:02:45.580> break<00:02:45.970> most<00:02:46.240> of<00:02:46.390> my<00:02:46.480> defensive<00:02:46.870> heads<00:02:47.050> on

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:47.260 
I break most of my defensive heads on

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:48.990 
I break most of my defensive heads on
they've<00:02:48.070> definitely<00:02:48.400> put<00:02:48.790> a<00:02:48.820> lot<00:02:48.970> of

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:49.000 
they've definitely put a lot of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.910 
they've definitely put a lot of
reinforcement<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:49.840> sidewall<00:02:50.260> helping<00:02:50.650> us<00:02:50.770> so

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
reinforcement the sidewall helping us so

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.220 
reinforcement the sidewall helping us so
the<00:02:51.460> gaps<00:02:51.760> aren't<00:02:52.150> too<00:02:52.300> large<00:02:52.630> in<00:02:52.900> between

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:53.230 
the gaps aren't too large in between

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.010 
the gaps aren't too large in between
each<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:54.550> I<00:02:54.580> like<00:02:54.820> that<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.390> definitely<00:02:55.750> don't

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:56.020 
each so I like that I definitely don't

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
each so I like that I definitely don't
think<00:02:56.230> it'll<00:02:56.380> break<00:02:56.530> is<00:02:56.680> easy<00:02:56.860> up<00:02:57.010> there

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.040 
think it'll break is easy up there

00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:58.470 
think it'll break is easy up there
because<00:02:57.280> like<00:02:57.430> I<00:02:57.520> said<00:02:57.580> when<00:02:57.850> you<00:02:57.880> co<00:02:58.090> check<00:02:58.360> it

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
because like I said when you co check it

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.050 
because like I said when you co check it
has<00:02:58.630> to<00:02:58.780> flare<00:02:59.080> out<00:02:59.110> and<00:02:59.500> put<00:02:59.980> pressure<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.640> the

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
has to flare out and put pressure on the

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:02.790 
has to flare out and put pressure on the
side<00:03:01.270> wall<00:03:01.510> which<00:03:01.660> they<00:03:01.840> don't<00:03:02.320> end<00:03:02.500> of<00:03:02.560> snap

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:02.800 
side wall which they don't end of snap

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:04.860 
side wall which they don't end of snap
on<00:03:03.010> at<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.820> bottom<00:03:04.120> it's<00:03:04.240> got<00:03:04.390> a<00:03:04.420> relatively

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
on at the bottom it's got a relatively

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.260 
on at the bottom it's got a relatively
big<00:03:04.990> yet<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:05.860> if<00:03:06.070> you<00:03:06.280> look<00:03:06.490> at<00:03:06.580> the<00:03:06.610> face<00:03:06.940> it's

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
big yet but if you look at the face it's

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.590 
big yet but if you look at the face it's
actually<00:03:07.510> a<00:03:07.720> really<00:03:07.960> thick<00:03:08.350> nice<00:03:09.240> side<00:03:10.240> piece

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
actually a really thick nice side piece

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.360 
actually a really thick nice side piece
of<00:03:10.720> plastic<00:03:11.110> here<00:03:11.350> which<00:03:11.530> I<00:03:11.680> like<00:03:11.890> especially

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
of plastic here which I like especially

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.940 
of plastic here which I like especially
at<00:03:12.460> the<00:03:12.580> bottom<00:03:12.990> and<00:03:13.990> then<00:03:14.170> another<00:03:14.530> thing<00:03:14.770> is

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
at the bottom and then another thing is

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.470 
at the bottom and then another thing is
they<00:03:15.040> went<00:03:15.220> with<00:03:15.280> square<00:03:15.670> sidewall<00:03:16.240> holes

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480 
they went with square sidewall holes

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:18.720 
they went with square sidewall holes
which<00:03:17.200> puts<00:03:17.470> a<00:03:17.530> little<00:03:17.830> more<00:03:18.010> plastic<00:03:18.550> in

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
which puts a little more plastic in

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.400 
which puts a little more plastic in
between<00:03:19.060> the<00:03:19.180> bottom<00:03:19.480> of<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.660> stick<00:03:19.930> and<00:03:20.110> the

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:20.410 
between the bottom of the stick and the

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:22.080 
between the bottom of the stick and the
