00:00:00.489 --> 00:00:04.689
 I took a look at missing you will find this wonderful Christmas throughout 

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:10.049
 part in all kinds of accordion of jet airplanes aluminum has many 

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:14.330
 because it is very light and strong and is corrosion resistant. 

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 what the cracks when reading in the mini-market but with time it is saved 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.779
 money 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:23.550
 ansa 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.409
 The 

00:00:24.409 --> 00:00:28.609
 so widely used today the most abundant metallic element in the world does not 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:33.070
 naturally occur the most available source of lolinha in fact 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.510
 what to belgium 

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.420
 she was full of liberation mainly in tropical countries that 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.890
 took the ship to the port from there well have to download 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:45.160
 like automotive line good way is linked to oxygen molecules 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.180
 of these bonds have to be broken down by electrolysis to produce the 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.610
 pure aluminum 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.290
 the tip snowed by rail to the siena where it will be very good after 

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.370
 through a chemical transformation called baier process that is 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:00.920
 removed the monitor 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.270
 then it is burned in searing to eliminate all the moisture this Friday 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.270
 are mills and reduction in spam 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:15.720
 susana has 432 caveirÃµes after making pass a powerful electric current 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.720
 to produce the electrolysis 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.790
 I do not think it's time for the champions 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.830
 then the electric current on the opposite side of the Romanian passes through the coin. 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:31.830
 we see here in the bottom of the cauldron 

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:42.929
 in a fast replacement process of the luminapar 950 degrees Celsius 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:44.590
 when you lose with the moment 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.050
 it will have to be replaced 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:51.860
 is a continuous operation on each side I have life time of about 20 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.860
 days 

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:00.230
 year old eyes are taken out of the cauldron with this tati quintet 

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.300
 taken for recycling 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.090
 not 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.320
 ae 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.320
 not 

00:02:11.169 --> 00:02:12.529
 this season 

00:02:12.529 --> 00:02:15.889
 thanks to this year - are seen after they will be reused 

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:22.329
 24 

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:25.809
 let's fight for what we saw the crust formed over the referee 

00:02:26.719 --> 00:02:30.139
 all votes are replaced the accumulated impurities have to be 

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:34.509
 withdrawn from the top of the cauldrons this is achieved by these feathers 

00:02:35.249 --> 00:02:39.479
 after one year of the new inserted in the name of bp the electrolysis continued 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.180
 7 

00:02:43.719 --> 00:02:46.659
 but the electrical current that these molecular bonds 

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:50.739
 the heaviest condo is at the bottom of the cauldron while watching 

00:02:50.739 --> 00:02:52.670
 to the flu is released as the gas 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.669
 which removes from the text that deals with the subject 

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:58.669
 Paulo 

00:02:59.869 --> 00:03:03.829
 the aluminum vitor boy continues on the bottom of the cauldron he has to 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:06.829
 recover from the big thump with everything 

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:11.359
 This is all dipped into the bottom of the cauldron and the vacuum system 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:14.359
 fired aluminum singer 

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:17.569
 check out 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.629
 the aluminum is removed quickly the air is drawn from the corner by a whole was 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:25.629
 possible insured by a coast operator 

00:03:27.399 --> 00:03:30.749
 finally chose to withdraw from the river so I think there is another amount 

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:32.699
 of aluminum in the cauldron 

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:34.499
 not 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.689
 the aluminum manufacturing process continues without interruption 

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:43.349
 the pulls and melted aluminum wires are transported to the house 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:47.349
 the contents are poured into containment forms with 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.159
 capacity of 60 tons in these baked very hot your domain 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.609
 melted is stored to wait for the melt 

00:03:55.609 --> 00:03:59.979
 finally start casting the molten aluminum vertically so that the 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:03.800
 ceni continued to produce source ingots as blocks 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.769
 directly used products in finished coast 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:13.099
 but for the cooling of the aluminum parts has accelerated by jets 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:14.829
 water 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.849
 codes of $ 7 large which can weigh up to 25 tons went through 

00:04:19.849 --> 00:04:22.849
 a hot spiral at a later time the manufacture of 

00:04:22.849 --> 00:04:25.849
 products such as coffee the monument 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:30.830
 from 4 to 5 tons of bauxite were produced two tons of aluminum 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:33.830
 which in turn produce a ton of aluminum 

00:04:37.059 --> 00:04:40.969
 we are going in particular produces 200 thousand tons of aluminum per year 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:44.919
 while others can produce about 400,000 tons 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:48.699
