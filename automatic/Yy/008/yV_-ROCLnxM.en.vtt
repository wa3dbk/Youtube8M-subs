00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.089
 very good to all welcome to the channel 

00:00:02.139 --> 00:00:06.670
 of youtube of vadejuegos as you see 

00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:08.710
 We are giving you final straw night and 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.480
 failed and we come to tell you some of 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:12.099
 these secrets of this shooter 

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.769
 multiplayer of electronic arts that 

00:00:12.099 --> 00:00:18.609
 will arrive this spring to xbox one xbox 

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:20.289
 360 and pc one of the keys of tight and 

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.060
 fail is to run a lot, not stop 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:23.859
 still for example here I have a titan 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:25.630
 enemy let's keep running and 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:26.999
 avoid running on the ground which is what 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.429
 I'm doing our moments 

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:32.520
 vital let's see if we get 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.680
 destroy it before it goes on we're going 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.690
 they have not finished with me as you 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.010
 he said you have to avoid running on the ground 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.560
 Maybe it's using verticality 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:44.440
 climb up the walls charge us for the 

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.570
 windows first because we had everything 

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.820
 the chaos that the titans unleash in the 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:50.170
 ground as you can see and on the other hand 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.000
 because it gives us strategic advantage 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.800
 to end the clueless as 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.000
 this here that is not seeing me we're going 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:59.960
 die bastard dies there is 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.720
 and we avoid therefore good to be a fixed target 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:06.270
 we are on the map in game mode 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.479
 hard point that is the catch the flag 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:12.150
 there are three there are three brave hot spots 

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:13.830
 charly and alpha and what you need to do is 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.740
 get to capture them because they give us 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:20.130
 points for it here we see this dies 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.229
 dies dies for son dies good I 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.140
 I am using these moments the class 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:26.700
 so sainz assassin assassin who's going to 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.170
 equipped with one of the most weapons 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.750
 interesting of the game that is the esm 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.229
 argan is a smart gun that 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:36.899
 detects the enemies fixes them and we 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.970
 helps kill them if they are enemies of the 

00:01:36.899 --> 00:01:41.160
 artificial intelligence like this or like 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.289
 this one with a fixed shot is already 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:45.539
 dead if they are human enemies there are 

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:48.210
 set three points and wait for it to 

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:50.340
 put as now because it is not very 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:52.649
 Skillful wait for it to turn red 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.490
 our points shoot and we kill them 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:55.490
 automatically 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.010
 besides this smart gun we have a 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:04.960
 anti titan weapon that allows us then 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.820
 as it is this case allows us to face 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.649
 a match against the titan with 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.929
 guarantees but if you alone and body to 

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:13.810
 body as it is now my case is quite 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 Fucked as you can see good welcome 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:19.810
 to the reinforcements and between the two we have 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.580
 could finish this good titan go 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:24.640
 winning the game I think it's very 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.770
 little for this game to end 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.959
 actually just won victory 

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:32.200
 and now the epilogue that is 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:35.769
 this moment that gives us the game in 

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:37.989
 the one that the losers have a few seconds 

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.110
 in these cases about 35 seconds there there 

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.800
 you can see it to get to the ships of 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:47.709
 evacuation that are coming and we 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.480
 we have those extra seconds for good 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:51.940
 as you can see the parkour is still not 

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:54.760
 mine those extra seconds to get to 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:57.670
 that point of the equation 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:58.480
 and finish the enemies and kill 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.629
 your ships 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:05.560
 you have to run quite a lot for the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:08.349
 two sides and it's a frantic moment 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:09.819
 because you see that escape that you see that 

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.500
 desperate house 

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:14.079
 the ship has to be here is there 

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.090
 then with the titanic winter antitank 

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:19.870
 I think he will not give time 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:22.420
 play and we're going to finish it off by shitting 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:25.000
 milks indeed there comes another 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.459
 titan between him and I see with the other 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.650
 titan there good support well we have 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:31.000
 won the game where have a 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.310
 discreet performance as you can see 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.769
 was the third of my team four 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:39.639
 deaths of pilots have killed me six 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:42.609
 times in 690 points in attack and 850 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.500
 points in defense good as well as os 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:46.930
 said there are several keys meanwhile the 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.730
 we will be recording several videos that 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.409
 we will go up these days so yes 

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:53.200

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.819
 know that you like these videos the 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:01.780
 we remember the keys verticality 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:06.069
 always use the 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:08.410
 heights use the distances and run 

00:04:06.069 --> 00:04:10.569
 do not stop still because the titans are going to 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.880
 finish with us as soon as we 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:14.590
 we despise and the enemies also in 

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:17.260
