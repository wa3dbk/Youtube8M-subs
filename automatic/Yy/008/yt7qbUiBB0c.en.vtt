00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
that we dis presented our next question

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.190 
that we dis presented our next question
is<00:01:51.960> by<00:01:52.170> galaxy<00:01:52.770> 101<00:01:53.280> end<00:01:53.549> why<00:01:54.479> do<00:01:54.540> you<00:01:54.810> play<00:01:55.049> as

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
is by galaxy 101 end why do you play as

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
is by galaxy 101 end why do you play as
Freddie<00:01:55.530> in<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:55.920> little<00:01:56.189> cutscenes<00:01:56.759> sadly<00:01:57.689> as

Freddie in the little cutscenes sadly as

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.719 
Freddie in the little cutscenes sadly as
of<00:01:57.990> now<00:01:58.170> there<00:01:58.439> isn't<00:01:58.649> much<00:01:58.920> information<00:01:59.640> on

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
of now there isn't much information on

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:01.850 
of now there isn't much information on
these<00:01:59.939> Scott<00:02:00.899> Calvin<00:02:01.170> made<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> lot<00:02:01.829> more

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
these Scott Calvin made a lot more

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.980 
these Scott Calvin made a lot more
questions<00:02:02.549> than<00:02:02.700> answers<00:02:03.299> and<00:02:03.540> five<00:02:03.810> nights

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
questions than answers and five nights

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.109 
questions than answers and five nights
at<00:02:04.170> Freddy's<00:02:04.469> 2<00:02:04.500> but<00:02:05.399> one<00:02:05.549> thing<00:02:05.790> that's

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
at Freddy's 2 but one thing that's

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.760 
at Freddy's 2 but one thing that's
obvious<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:06.899> that<00:02:06.960> these<00:02:07.380> are<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> original

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
obvious is that these are the original

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.249 
obvious is that these are the original

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
animatronics you're looking at as of now

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.650 
animatronics you're looking at as of now
the<00:02:10.649> only<00:02:11.039> time<00:02:11.310> that<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:11.670> know<00:02:11.940> that<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> rich

five nights at Freddy's location let's

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.440 
five nights at Freddy's location let's
do<00:02:23.909> a<00:02:23.940> side-by-side<00:02:24.180> comparison<00:02:24.690> of<00:02:26.450> fanatica

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
do a side-by-side comparison of fanatica

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:29.990 
do a side-by-side comparison of fanatica
and<00:02:27.659> the<00:02:27.989> cutscene<00:02:28.440> chica<00:02:28.860> a<00:02:29.069> side-by-side

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
and the cutscene chica a side-by-side

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.559 
and the cutscene chica a side-by-side
comparison<00:02:30.360> you<00:02:31.019> can<00:02:31.049> see<00:02:31.349> that<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.950> beak<00:02:32.760> the

00:02:33.559 --> 00:02:33.569 
comparison you can see that the beak the

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:36.830 
comparison you can see that the beak the
nose<00:02:33.840> holes<00:02:34.140> the<00:02:34.680> eyes<00:02:34.860> the<00:02:35.579> eyebrows<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.360> the

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
nose holes the eyes the eyebrows and the

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.440 
nose holes the eyes the eyebrows and the
bib<00:02:37.079> are<00:02:37.319> pretty<00:02:37.829> similar<00:02:38.129> but<00:02:38.519> when<00:02:39.360> you

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
bib are pretty similar but when you

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.210 
bib are pretty similar but when you
compare<00:02:39.870> it<00:02:39.900> side<00:02:40.230> by<00:02:40.260> side<00:02:40.650> with<00:02:40.829> the<00:02:40.950> Fred

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
bears family diners chica you can see

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:47.119 
bears family diners chica you can see
that<00:02:44.700> none<00:02:45.120> of<00:02:45.150> those<00:02:45.470> similarities<00:02:46.470> are<00:02:46.739> in

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:47.129 
that none of those similarities are in

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:49.520 
that none of those similarities are in
this<00:02:47.370> one<00:02:47.609> and<00:02:47.879> when<00:02:48.390> you<00:02:48.480> compare<00:02:48.720> Bonnie<00:02:49.230> you

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
this one and when you compare Bonnie you

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.949 
this one and when you compare Bonnie you
also<00:02:49.950> get<00:02:50.069> the<00:02:50.220> similar<00:02:50.459> result<00:02:51.000> so<00:02:51.750> when

00:02:51.949 --> 00:02:51.959 
also get the similar result so when

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:53.839 
also get the similar result so when
we're<00:02:52.140> seeing<00:02:52.470> these<00:02:52.650> cutscenes<00:02:53.190> are<00:02:53.459> we

00:02:53.839 --> 00:02:53.849 
we're seeing these cutscenes are we

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:56.479 
we're seeing these cutscenes are we
seeing<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.359> glimpse<00:02:54.750> into<00:02:54.870> the<00:02:55.049> future<00:02:55.099> if<00:02:56.099> so
