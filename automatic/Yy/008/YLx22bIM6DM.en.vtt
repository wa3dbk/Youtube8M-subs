00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
mentioned about Windows RT so we kind of

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.069 
mentioned about Windows RT so we kind of
assumed<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.760> Microsoft<00:00:36.239> wasn't<00:00:36.750> going<00:00:36.960> to

be developing it further many in the
industry<00:00:39.239> simply<00:00:39.840> thought<00:00:40.200> that<00:00:40.379> this<00:00:40.500> meant

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770

industry simply thought that this meant
that<00:00:40.829> Microsoft<00:00:41.399> was<00:00:41.550> no<00:00:41.790> longer<00:00:42.030> interested

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
that Microsoft was no longer interested

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
sets but it turns out this might not

that these screenshots are for a Windows

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.990 
that these screenshots are for a Windows

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
10 mobile build that's designed for

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.660 
10 mobile build that's designed for
devices<00:01:42.630> larger<00:01:43.140> than<00:01:43.290> phablets<00:01:43.799> but<00:01:44.310> smaller

in size so what will we be seeing in
this<00:01:50.310> update<00:01:50.549> to<00:01:50.729> Windows<00:01:50.909> RT<00:01:51.329> that

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
this update to Windows RT that

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.270 
this update to Windows RT that
supposedly<00:01:52.290> will<00:01:52.560> be<00:01:52.649> coming<00:01:52.950> out<00:01:53.070> in<00:01:53.100> the

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
supposedly will be coming out in the

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.639 
supposedly will be coming out in the
next<00:01:53.549> couple<00:01:53.700> of<00:01:53.850> months<00:01:54.320> Microsoft<00:01:55.320> did<00:01:55.500> say

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
next couple of months Microsoft did say

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.109 
next couple of months Microsoft did say
that<00:01:55.829> we<00:01:55.920> will<00:01:56.070> be<00:01:56.189> getting<00:01:56.369> some<00:01:56.759> of<00:01:56.939> the

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
that we will be getting some of the

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.660 
that we will be getting some of the
features<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> Windows<00:01:57.899> 10<00:01:58.439> we<00:01:59.219> would<00:01:59.340> expect

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
features of Windows 10 we would expect

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.370 
features of Windows 10 we would expect
that<00:01:59.790> Microsoft<00:02:00.329> would<00:02:00.420> want<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:00.719> put<00:02:00.930> the

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:01.380 
that Microsoft would want to put the

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:04.100 
that Microsoft would want to put the
most<00:02:01.619> crucial<00:02:02.070> consumer<00:02:03.030> facing<00:02:03.210> features<00:02:03.899> on

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
most crucial consumer facing features on

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.289 
most crucial consumer facing features on
there<00:02:04.439> so<00:02:04.860> I<00:02:04.890> would<00:02:05.219> say<00:02:05.340> Cortana<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:06.030> very

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:06.299 
there so I would say Cortana is very

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:08.479 
there so I would say Cortana is very
likely<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:07.110> action<00:02:07.500> center<00:02:07.890> would<00:02:08.009> also<00:02:08.190> be

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
likely the action center would also be

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:10.850 
likely the action center would also be
likely<00:02:08.729> hopefully<00:02:09.599> access<00:02:10.110> to<00:02:10.289> the<00:02:10.379> new

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
likely hopefully access to the new

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.220 
likely hopefully access to the new
or<00:02:10.979> and<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.700> new<00:02:11.820> MSN<00:02:12.390> apps<00:02:12.630> things<00:02:13.020> like

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
or and the new MSN apps things like

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.770 
or and the new MSN apps things like
weather<00:02:13.530> and<00:02:13.980> Finance<00:02:14.580> and<00:02:14.820> health<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.360> new

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
weather and Finance and health the new

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.590 
weather and Finance and health the new
music<00:02:16.350> and<00:02:16.700> now<00:02:17.700> I<00:02:17.730> think<00:02:17.850> it's<00:02:18.120> called<00:02:18.270> movies

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
music and now I think it's called movies

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.780 
music and now I think it's called movies
and<00:02:18.780> TV<00:02:19.140> apps<00:02:19.470> should<00:02:20.130> also<00:02:20.280> be<00:02:20.550> available

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
and TV apps should also be available

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.210 
and TV apps should also be available
there<00:02:21.270> we<00:02:21.990> also<00:02:22.140> hope<00:02:22.440> that<00:02:22.470> Microsoft<00:02:23.100> is

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
there we also hope that Microsoft is

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
there we also hope that Microsoft is
smart<00:02:23.490> enough<00:02:23.580> to<00:02:23.670> realize<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.270> most<00:02:24.480> people

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
smart enough to realize that most people

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.900 
smart enough to realize that most people
purchase<00:02:25.380> these<00:02:25.590> devices<00:02:26.220> because<00:02:26.640> it<00:02:26.760> gave

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
purchase these devices because it gave

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.540 
purchase these devices because it gave
them<00:02:27.120> free<00:02:27.480> access<00:02:28.320> to<00:02:28.860> the<00:02:28.980> full<00:02:29.190> suite<00:02:29.520> of

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:29.550 
them free access to the full suite of

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.000 
them free access to the full suite of
office<00:02:30.150> apps<00:02:30.480> so<00:02:31.200> we<00:02:31.290> hope<00:02:31.410> that<00:02:31.560> Microsoft

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
office apps so we hope that Microsoft

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.980 
office apps so we hope that Microsoft
retains<00:02:32.400> access<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:33.150> the<00:02:33.300> desktop<00:02:33.720> or<00:02:33.930> at

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
retains access to the desktop or at

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:36.680 
retains access to the desktop or at
least<00:02:34.200> somehow<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:35.100> the<00:02:35.280> office<00:02:35.700> 2013<00:02:35.850> and

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
least somehow to the office 2013 and

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.470 
least somehow to the office 2013 and
going<00:02:37.230> forward<00:02:37.470> the<00:02:37.590> office<00:02:37.890> 2016<00:02:38.430> apps<00:02:39.000> and

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
going forward the office 2016 apps and

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.320 
going forward the office 2016 apps and
not<00:02:39.930> just<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.380> mobile<00:02:40.590> variants<00:02:41.220> many<00:02:42.060> of<00:02:42.240> the

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
not just the mobile variants many of the
