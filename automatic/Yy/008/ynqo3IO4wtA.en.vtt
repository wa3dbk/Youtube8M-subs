00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
ports on the machine and next we'll move

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.960 
ports on the machine and next we'll move
on<00:00:57.900> to<00:00:58.200> installing<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.710> software<00:00:59.010> so<00:00:59.910> to

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.430 
options but what we want to do here is
program<00:04:54.960> the<00:04:55.200> ECU<00:04:55.650> memory<00:04:56.810> so<00:04:57.810> this<00:04:58.140> now

00:04:58.430 --> 00:04:58.440 
program the ECU memory so this now

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.150 
program the ECU memory so this now
points<00:04:58.860> me<00:04:58.980> to<00:04:59.010> the<00:04:59.460> USB<00:05:00.030> key<00:05:00.240> and<00:05:00.830> as<00:05:01.830> I<00:05:01.920> said

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.160 
points me to the USB key and as I said

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.460 
points me to the USB key and as I said
earlier<00:05:02.460> on<00:05:02.810> first<00:05:03.810> of<00:05:03.960> all<00:05:04.020> we<00:05:04.170> need<00:05:04.290> to

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:04.470 
earlier on first of all we need to

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:06.830 
earlier on first of all we need to
update<00:05:04.620> with<00:05:05.040> update<00:05:05.640> with<00:05:06.060> me<00:05:06.210> first<00:05:06.510> file

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:06.840 
update with update with me first file

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.840 
update with update with me first file
which<00:05:07.110> brings<00:05:07.440> the<00:05:07.740> Ford<00:05:08.160> calibrations

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:08.850 
which brings the Ford calibrations

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:16.070 
which brings the Ford calibrations
up-to-date<00:05:09.330> in<00:05:09.930> the<00:05:10.560> ECU<00:05:11.930> so

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.320 

this<00:05:16.710> takes<00:05:16.979> a<00:05:17.250> while<00:05:17.430> longer<00:05:18.120> than<00:05:18.300> just

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:18.330 
this takes a while longer than just

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.850 
this takes a while longer than just
installing<00:05:18.960> the<00:05:19.050> tunes<00:05:19.319> this<00:05:19.560> takes

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
installing the tunes this takes

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.040 
installing the tunes this takes
approximately<00:05:20.610> four<00:05:20.669> minutes<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.870> you<00:05:21.960> only

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
approximately four minutes but you only

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.529 
approximately four minutes but you only
have<00:05:22.199> to<00:05:22.289> do<00:05:22.409> it<00:05:22.500> once<00:05:23.000> when<00:05:24.000> it<00:05:24.090> comes<00:05:24.300> to

00:05:24.529 --> 00:05:24.539 
have to do it once when it comes to

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:27.409 
have to do it once when it comes to
installing<00:05:24.990> the<00:05:25.319> tunes<00:05:25.590> later<00:05:25.889> on<00:05:26.240> they<00:05:27.240> take

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:27.419 
installing the tunes later on they take

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:29.659 
installing the tunes later on they take
about<00:05:27.689> 17<00:05:28.199> or<00:05:28.229> 18<00:05:28.590> seconds<00:05:29.129> so<00:05:29.250> it's<00:05:29.370> very<00:05:29.520> very

00:05:29.659 --> 00:05:29.669 
about 17 or 18 seconds so it's very very

00:05:29.669 --> 00:05:33.170 
about 17 or 18 seconds so it's very very
quick<00:05:29.939> and<00:05:30.000> easy<00:05:30.270> to<00:05:31.039> swap<00:05:32.039> between<00:05:32.159> maps<00:05:32.909> if

00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:33.180 
quick and easy to swap between maps if

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:41.469 
quick and easy to swap between maps if
you<00:05:33.300> have<00:05:33.479> more<00:05:33.659> than<00:05:33.780> one

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:41.479 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:45.100 

okay<00:05:42.259> so<00:05:42.319> we're<00:05:42.770> nearly<00:05:42.919> done<00:05:42.979> I<00:05:43.930> think<00:05:44.930> this

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:45.110 
okay so we're nearly done I think this

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:46.779 
okay so we're nearly done I think this
has<00:05:45.199> been<00:05:45.229> faster<00:05:45.740> than<00:05:45.770> four<00:05:46.249> minutes<00:05:46.580> this

00:05:46.779 --> 00:05:46.789 
has been faster than four minutes this

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.200 
has been faster than four minutes this
is<00:05:46.999> looking<00:05:47.509> like<00:05:47.569> it's<00:05:47.870> just<00:05:48.020> gonna<00:05:48.169> be<00:05:49.210> about

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:50.210 
is looking like it's just gonna be about

00:05:50.210 --> 00:06:00.960 
is looking like it's just gonna be about
three<00:05:50.479> and<00:05:50.569> a<00:05:50.599> quarter<00:05:50.749> minutes

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:00.970 

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:02.730 

okay<00:06:01.660> so<00:06:01.720> now<00:06:02.110> I<00:06:02.140> need<00:06:02.260> to<00:06:02.380> turn<00:06:02.530> the<00:06:02.680> ignition

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:02.740 
okay so now I need to turn the ignition

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:22.900 
okay so now I need to turn the ignition
off<00:06:04.170> McNish<00:06:05.170> is<00:06:05.230> off

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.690 

okay<00:06:24.530> so<00:06:25.530> the<00:06:25.710> base<00:06:25.860> collaborations<00:06:26.520> have

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:26.700 
okay so the base collaborations have

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:28.310 
okay so the base collaborations have
been<00:06:26.850> successfully<00:06:27.540> programmed<00:06:27.990> into<00:06:28.170> the

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:28.320 
been successfully programmed into the

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.130 
been successfully programmed into the
ECU<00:06:28.680> and<00:06:29.150> now<00:06:30.150> we<00:06:30.210> can<00:06:30.450> turn<00:06:30.600> the<00:06:30.780> ignition<00:06:30.840> key

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:31.140 
ECU and now we can turn the ignition key

00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:34.510 
ECU and now we can turn the ignition key
back<00:06:31.500> on<00:06:31.740> and<00:06:32.400> now<00:06:32.880> we<00:06:32.940> can<00:06:33.120> program<00:06:33.390> it<00:06:33.690> with

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:34.520 
back on and now we can program it with

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.700 
back on and now we can program it with
one<00:06:35.520> of<00:06:35.610> the<00:06:35.670> high-performance<00:06:36.270> Tunes<00:06:36.570> so<00:06:37.080> I'm

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
one of the high-performance Tunes so I'm

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.400 
one of the high-performance Tunes so I'm
gonna<00:06:37.860> go<00:06:38.040> straight<00:06:38.340> for<00:06:38.580> the<00:06:38.810> Focus<00:06:39.810> RS<00:06:39.930> CP

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:40.410 
gonna go straight for the Focus RS CP

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.170 
gonna go straight for the Focus RS CP
for<00:06:40.650> twenty<00:06:41.040> days<00:06:41.580> three<00:06:42.440> map<00:06:43.880> choose<00:06:44.880> that

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:45.180 
for twenty days three map choose that

00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:48.020 
for twenty days three map choose that
and<00:06:45.540> you'll<00:06:46.260> see<00:06:46.320> here<00:06:46.620> this<00:06:46.800> is<00:06:46.860> much<00:06:47.760> much

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.030 
and you'll see here this is much much

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:51.530 
and you'll see here this is much much
quicker<00:06:48.240> so<00:06:48.720> it<00:06:48.780> should<00:06:49.020> take<00:06:49.260> about<00:06:50.090> 17<00:06:51.090> or<00:06:51.240> 18

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:51.540 
quicker so it should take about 17 or 18

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:56.810 
quicker so it should take about 17 or 18
seconds<00:06:52.050> to<00:06:52.140> install<00:06:54.380> and<00:06:55.490> you<00:06:56.490> can<00:06:56.640> just

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:56.820 
seconds to install and you can just

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:58.370 
seconds to install and you can just
change<00:06:57.030> between<00:06:57.330> maps<00:06:57.750> as<00:06:57.930> often<00:06:58.140> as<00:06:58.260> you<00:06:58.350> like

00:06:58.370 --> 00:06:58.380 
change between maps as often as you like

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.500 
change between maps as often as you like
if<00:06:58.770> you<00:06:58.860> have<00:06:59.010> more<00:06:59.220> than<00:06:59.310> one<00:06:59.490> and<00:06:59.880> it<00:07:00.360> always

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:00.510 
if you have more than one and it always

00:07:00.510 --> 00:07:08.430 
if you have more than one and it always
takes<00:07:00.750> this<00:07:00.990> long<00:07:01.050> to<00:07:01.380> install

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:08.440 

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:26.130 

ignition<00:07:09.310> off

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:26.140 

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:28.690 

and<00:07:27.140> that's<00:07:27.440> it<00:07:27.770> tune<00:07:28.130> successfully

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:28.700 
and that's it tune successfully

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.780 
and that's it tune successfully
installed<00:07:33.130> you<00:07:34.130> can<00:07:34.280> close<00:07:34.490> the<00:07:34.610> software

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:34.790 
installed you can close the software

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:35.500 
installed you can close the software
down<00:07:35.180> there

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:35.510 
down there

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.600 
down there
now<00:07:35.750> we<00:07:35.810> don't<00:07:35.990> we<00:07:36.740> can<00:07:36.890> take<00:07:37.070> the<00:07:37.160> laptop<00:07:37.490> out

00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:37.610 
now we don't we can take the laptop out

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:39.880 
now we don't we can take the laptop out
of<00:07:37.670> the<00:07:37.730> way<00:07:37.910> and<00:07:38.780> push<00:07:39.050> the<00:07:39.170> cable<00:07:39.350> to<00:07:39.590> newbie
