00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.690
 ok we're here to start the goal 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:11.070
 two points of fox first movement 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:14.190
 turn arrow right 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.160
 according to the movement pass 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.310
 the march is asking clutch clearance 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.539
 first third movement 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.699
 release the handbrake holding was standing 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:30.420
 to always leave the car firm in 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:36.079
 move the room to the window 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:39.750
 back to see the tip of the goal 

00:00:36.079 --> 00:00:44.190
 when she gets more like you 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:47.180
 I think it's better for you to line up the car. 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.180
 inside the goal 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:53.250
 ok finding point on target turns steering wheel 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.660
 all right 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.180
 Do not forget to relax the movement to 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.589
 the car does not die puts the car in 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:10.880
 movement to see the second point 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:10.880
 which is the third goal just the tip 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:23.600
 finding the target turns the steering wheel all the way 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.170
 left 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.060
 do not forget to relax direction to the 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:33.170
 car does not die 

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:35.840
 check it or reconnect it and placing it 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:40.369
 the car in motion looking back and 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:43.340
 forward to back and forward to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:48.590
 get close to the back mark 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:56.420
 Okay, let's go to the car. 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:58.970
 first the line direction and end with 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.750
 arrow on by placing the car in 

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:06.320
 moving forward always coming 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:09.590
 next never coming close 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.870
 for you to have a safe distance 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:16.250
 At that moment the examiner will ask 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:22.489
 Do you take the car out or park it outside? 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:25.730
 put into reverse and turned in 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:26.930
 direction to the right and arrow to the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.790

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.299

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:52.269
 memorizes this moment because it is 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:57.130
 very important at the exit of the vehicle 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:03:01.690

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.690

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.250
 head looking out 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.400

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.400
