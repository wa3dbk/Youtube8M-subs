that the wheel hub may have failed one

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.089 
that the wheel hub may have failed one
of<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:27.869> more<00:00:28.050> likely<00:00:28.380> reasons<00:00:28.710> why<00:00:28.859> you<00:00:28.920> might

it<00:00:36.870> can<00:00:37.079> be<00:00:37.230> kind<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.559> tricky<00:00:37.860> procedure<00:00:38.190> but

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:38.640 
it can be kind of a tricky procedure but

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:40.520 
it can be kind of a tricky procedure but
it's<00:00:38.820> not<00:00:38.940> too<00:00:39.120> bad<00:00:39.300> you<00:00:40.079> just<00:00:40.140> want<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.410> make

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
it's not too bad you just want to make

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.080 
it's not too bad you just want to make
sure<00:00:40.559> you<00:00:40.770> sort<00:00:41.129> observe<00:00:41.579> all<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.879> torque

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
sure you sort observe all the torque

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.000 
sure you sort observe all the torque
specifications<00:00:42.809> and<00:00:43.020> take<00:00:43.649> your<00:00:43.800> time

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
specifications and take your time

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.979 
specifications and take your time
because<00:00:44.219> this<00:00:44.850> especially<00:00:45.329> this<00:00:45.390> vehicle<00:00:45.809> can

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
because this especially this vehicle can

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.630 
because this especially this vehicle can
be<00:00:46.020> very<00:00:46.320> sensitive<00:00:46.710> if<00:00:46.980> you've<00:00:47.129> got<00:00:47.309> anything

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
be very sensitive if you've got anything

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.639 
be very sensitive if you've got anything
that's<00:00:47.850> loose<00:00:48.420> or<00:00:48.690> out<00:00:48.809> of<00:00:48.960> spec<00:00:49.140> even<00:00:49.410> just<00:00:49.559> a

that's loose or out of spec even just a
little<00:00:49.680> bit<00:00:50.059> so<00:00:51.059> let's<00:00:51.390> get<00:00:51.510> started<00:00:51.930> first<00:00:52.530> we

manager of the brake line I see some

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.570 
manager of the brake line I see some
people<00:01:18.780> use<00:01:18.960> zip<00:01:19.320> ties<00:01:19.560> or<00:01:19.950> whatever<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.549> just

people use zip ties or whatever you just

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:21.620 
people use zip ties or whatever you just
want<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.820> make<00:01:20.939> sure<00:01:20.970> that<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.270> have<00:01:21.450> the

want to make sure that you have the

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.020 
want to make sure that you have the

caliper secured and completely out of
the<00:01:24.090> way<00:01:24.439> after<00:01:25.439> removing<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:25.770> caliper<00:01:26.040> we

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
the way after removing the caliper we

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.340 
the way after removing the caliper we
were<00:01:27.000> able<00:01:27.180> to<00:01:27.210> remove<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.479> rotor<00:01:27.750> there's<00:01:28.229> a

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
were able to remove the rotor there's a

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.109 
were able to remove the rotor there's a
tiny<00:01:28.890> bit<00:01:29.040> of<00:01:29.130> a<00:01:29.159> lip<00:01:29.310> on<00:01:29.460> there<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:29.850> it<00:01:29.939> can<00:01:30.060> be

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
tiny bit of a lip on there so it can be

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:31.969 
tiny bit of a lip on there so it can be
hard<00:01:30.299> to<00:01:30.420> get<00:01:30.509> the<00:01:30.720> caliper<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.439> disengage

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
hard to get the caliper to disengage

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:35.030 
hard to get the caliper to disengage
sometimes<00:01:32.430> then<00:01:33.360> also<00:01:33.570> the<00:01:34.020> rotor<00:01:34.530> was

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
sometimes then also the rotor was

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:37.670 
sometimes then also the rotor was
further<00:01:35.670> support<00:01:36.180> by

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
further support by

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:41.249 
further support by

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:38.460 
of with these aluminum parts but with a
few<00:03:36.459> whacks<00:03:36.639> I<00:03:37.000> was<00:03:37.419> able<00:03:37.510> to<00:03:37.660> get<00:03:37.870> it<00:03:37.989> to<00:03:38.019> get

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
few whacks I was able to get it to get

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.140 
few whacks I was able to get it to get
it<00:03:38.590> loose<00:03:38.709> without<00:03:39.130> any<00:03:39.609> damage<00:03:40.000> whatsoever

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
it loose without any damage whatsoever

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.870 
it loose without any damage whatsoever
to<00:03:40.569> the<00:03:40.690> control<00:03:41.019> arm<00:03:41.260> just<00:03:41.709> I<00:03:42.130> mean<00:03:42.430> try<00:03:42.669> and

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
to the control arm just I mean try and

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.339 
to the control arm just I mean try and
be<00:03:43.329> careful<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.959> and<00:03:44.260> be<00:03:45.040> gentle<00:03:45.430> but

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:46.349 
be careful and and be gentle but

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:48.600 
be careful and and be gentle but
sometimes<00:03:47.349> it's<00:03:47.590> the<00:03:47.680> force<00:03:48.129> that<00:03:48.310> gets<00:03:48.489> it

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
sometimes it's the force that gets it

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.790 
sometimes it's the force that gets it
loose<00:03:48.760> and<00:03:48.909> sometimes<00:03:49.120> it's<00:03:49.510> the<00:03:49.569> vibration

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:50.800 
loose and sometimes it's the vibration

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.090 
loose and sometimes it's the vibration
from<00:03:51.370> striking<00:03:52.330> it<00:03:52.570> metal-on-metal<00:03:53.100> that's

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
from striking it metal-on-metal that's

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:56.130 
from striking it metal-on-metal that's
just<00:03:54.280> what<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.490> took<00:03:54.640> with<00:03:55.120> with<00:03:56.050> this

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 
just what it took with with this

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
just what it took with with this
particular<00:03:56.680> guy

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
particular guy

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.120 
particular guy

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:07.750 
fasteners right here and get them I've

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:10.620 
fasteners right here and get them I've
just<00:04:07.900> got<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.080> breaker<00:04:08.320> bar<00:04:08.970> with<00:04:09.970> an<00:04:10.180> adapter

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.630 
just got a breaker bar with an adapter

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.900 
just got a breaker bar with an adapter
and<00:04:10.810> then<00:04:10.990> a<00:04:11.050> t-55<00:04:11.770> socket<00:04:12.220> which<00:04:12.430> is<00:04:12.610> kind<00:04:12.820> of

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:12.910 
and then a t-55 socket which is kind of

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:15.690 
and then a t-55 socket which is kind of
an<00:04:13.090> unusually<00:04:13.810> large<00:04:13.960> t-55<00:04:14.710> so<00:04:15.190> make<00:04:15.340> sure<00:04:15.370> you

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
an unusually large t-55 so make sure you

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:17.490 
an unusually large t-55 so make sure you
you've<00:04:16.570> got<00:04:16.750> one<00:04:16.900> of<00:04:16.960> these<00:04:17.020> in<00:04:17.080> your<00:04:17.320> kit

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
you've got one of these in your kit

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:19.740 
you've got one of these in your kit
before<00:04:17.650> you<00:04:17.860> get<00:04:17.980> started<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:18.850> let's<00:04:18.910> let's

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
before you get started so let's let's

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.810 
before you get started so let's let's
get<00:04:19.900> them<00:04:20.080> removed<00:04:20.230> and<00:04:21.130> then<00:04:21.280> also<00:04:21.580> make<00:04:21.790> sure

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:21.820 
get them removed and then also make sure

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.270 
get them removed and then also make sure
that<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.210> disconnect<00:04:22.390> your<00:04:22.750> ABS<00:04:23.740> wheel<00:04:24.010> speed

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:24.280 
that you disconnect your ABS wheel speed

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.220 
that you disconnect your ABS wheel speed
sensor<00:04:24.670> so<00:04:24.970> you<00:04:25.000> don't<00:04:25.240> damage<00:04:25.450> the<00:04:25.780> connector

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.230 
sensor so you don't damage the connector

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:31.800 
sensor so you don't damage the connector
when<00:04:26.530> you<00:04:26.790> remove<00:04:27.930> the<00:04:28.930> wheel<00:04:29.110> hub<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:31.000> after

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:31.810 
when you remove the wheel hub and after

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:34.020 
when you remove the wheel hub and after
moving<00:04:32.080> those<00:04:32.260> t-55<00:04:32.860> fasteners<00:04:33.340> we<00:04:33.550> have<00:04:33.760> the

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:34.030 
moving those t-55 fasteners we have the

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:37.440 
moving those t-55 fasteners we have the
wheel<00:04:34.180> hub<00:04:34.390> assembly<00:04:34.840> and<00:04:35.490> I've<00:04:36.490> got<00:04:36.670> this<00:04:36.910> new

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:37.450 
wheel hub assembly and I've got this new

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:40.230 
wheel hub assembly and I've got this new
move<00:04:37.870> wheel<00:04:38.440> hub<00:04:38.650> assembly<00:04:39.070> which<00:04:39.730> I<00:04:39.850> think<00:04:40.060> is

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
move wheel hub assembly which I think is

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.780 
move wheel hub assembly which I think is
the<00:04:40.590> one<00:04:41.590> of<00:04:41.710> the<00:04:41.740> better<00:04:41.950> assemblies<00:04:42.490> you<00:04:42.640> can

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:42.790 
the one of the better assemblies you can

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:46.710 
the one of the better assemblies you can
get<00:04:42.940> for<00:04:43.210> a<00:04:43.240> reasonable<00:04:43.960> price<00:04:44.400> and<00:04:45.720> basically

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:46.720 
get for a reasonable price and basically

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:47.760 
get for a reasonable price and basically
we're<00:04:46.960> just<00:04:46.990> going<00:04:47.200> to<00:04:47.230> do<00:04:47.350> everything<00:04:47.560> in

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
we're just going to do everything in

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:49.200 
we're just going to do everything in
reverse<00:04:48.010> order<00:04:48.310> paying<00:04:48.820> very<00:04:49.030> close

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:49.210 
reverse order paying very close

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.000 
reverse order paying very close
attention<00:04:49.300> to<00:04:49.780> all<00:04:49.990> of<00:04:50.110> our<00:04:50.170> torque

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.010 
attention to all of our torque

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.570 
attention to all of our torque
specifications<00:04:52.920> but<00:04:53.920> really<00:04:54.310> nothing
