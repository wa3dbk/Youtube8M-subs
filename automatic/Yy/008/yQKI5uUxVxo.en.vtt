00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:09.340
 Hello, Assassins! 

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:12.020
 Gabe Graziani, one of the developers of the community 

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.069
 of Assassin's Creed Unity and of Assassin's Creed Rogue in particular, 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:19.650
 brings you another video of questions and answers. 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.089
 Let's go fast, because they tell me that you want me to answer you 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:23.478
 to a few questions. 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:27.019
 So we go directly to the first, which comes from our 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:27.710
 forums, 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.280
 from the user LotesDeOro, who asks: 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.950
 "Can a weapon be used in every hand in Assassin's Creed Rogue?" 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:39.130
 Let's say it's an option, as it was for Edward Kenway. 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:40.940
 Edward wrestles with two 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:44.920
 Cutlasses, and Shay also uses two weapons. Handles a normal sword 

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.993
 and another shorter one called "main-gauche", which in French 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.019
 means "left hand". 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.032
 So he uses a weapon in each hand, but he can not wield a sword 

00:00:54.032 --> 00:00:55.038
 and at the same time a club or something similar. 

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:58.737
 It's what we've done in previous Assassin's Creed games, or similar. 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:02.900
 The following doubt comes from Reddit. 

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.880
 Limp_Hispanic_Thief asks: "Shay has 'The Gift'? 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.960
 Does he have an eagle view because he acquired it when he was a 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.660
 Assassin? " 

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:12.960
 The answer to both questions is: yes! 

00:01:13.149 --> 00:01:16.450
 Shay has an eagle view, which she learned while training to be 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.020
 an Assassin. 

00:01:17.039 --> 00:01:20.770
 It is extremely useful for an Assassin who is after his prey. 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.757
 Surprise, surprise! We have a fragment of the game trailer 

00:01:24.759 --> 00:01:25.760
 showing how Shay 

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:29.119
 It acts like a real Assassin hunter. 

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:32.164
 The next question comes, again, from Reddit. 

00:01:32.299 --> 00:01:36.959
 VictorShade1 wants to know: "Will there be a Templar base in Rogue? 

00:01:36.959 --> 00:01:41.010
 like the Assassins lairs of the other games? "I'm afraid it's 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.520
 Soon to answer that. We must keep certain things 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.500
 in secret. Be patient, and in the next few weeks you will know 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.140
 anything else... 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.187
 Maybe even next week! In this Q &amp; A about Rogue, we see two 

00:01:56.529 --> 00:02:00.538
 fantastic images of Shay Patrick Cormac, from two of the best artists of our 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:01.380
 community. 

00:02:01.389 --> 00:02:04.403
 The one on the left is from Sazienas, whose typical style 

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:07.531
 Chibi is adorable. And to the right, 

00:02:07.531 --> 00:02:10.991
 an image of the bright and prolific Sunsetagain. 

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.074
 As always, below there are links to both artists in the description of the video, 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.040
 in case you want to follow these geniuses. Surely you are going to do it. 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.799
 Well, we're out of time 

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:25.804
 for this series of Assassins Q &amp; A videos. 

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:29.109
 See you another day. Goodbye!
