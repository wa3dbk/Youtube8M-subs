the same exact thing it looks the same

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.150 
the same exact thing it looks the same
maybe<00:00:39.030> move<00:00:39.660> differently<00:00:40.260> but<00:00:40.559> it's<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.890> same

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
maybe move differently but it's the same
