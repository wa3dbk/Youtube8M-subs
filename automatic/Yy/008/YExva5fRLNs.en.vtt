00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:10.520
 Hi everyone, how are you? 

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:12.619
 with video showing you how to take 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.789
 the excess of enamel that when step 

00:00:12.619 --> 00:00:15.980
 dark enamel 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.170
 I'll show the way I do 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:20.420
 I hope your help this hand that 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:21.710
 I've tried now'll clean this one 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.890
 It's fast 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.930
 despite being the good guy all over the planet 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:33.980
 I came here and I'll take a look at the 

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:37.570
 talita to roll and I roll and I 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.570
 start removing the excess here 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:52.340
 Here I like to make it so low. 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:54.950
 to ask me to ruin the nail polish 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.930
 The big problem is when we are 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:01:00.530
 cleaning stick space unintentionally in 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:07.070
 top of the nail and so on all the work already 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:09.710
 A lot of girls suffer from this, right? 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.260
 Why did the nail look beautiful? 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.330
 wonderful time to clean spoils 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:17.060
 all 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:20.150
 I counted the firm hand 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:22.479
 takes some excess is not so 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:25.640
 very soggy 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:29.020
 because there you can run right on top of the 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:29.020
 Enamel can ruin 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:39.320
 I always start over here always 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.390
 running the corinthians and never dragging 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.070
 because if you drag you will lose 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:50.720
 anyway, so I'll go to the 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:55.340
 running to my best shape 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:02:00.760
 I hope this video helps you is a 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.760
 simple but that helps 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.210
 It is fast and takes no 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.050
 here is so messed up the event 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:39.760
 political right 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.760
 Let's go here at the last verdÃ£o 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.849
 so this is what I hope you have 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.220
 Help you, you have not much secret. 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:15.459
 but I came to show that some people 

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:23.819
 have doubts so I hope you have 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:23.819
 helped you and until the next video such 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:32.330
