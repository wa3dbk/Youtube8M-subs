00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.080
 hi goats misguided welcome a 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.400
 day more to my channel this time 

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:26.200
 I bring aventure island juezo I am me 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.350
 and I always say you play everything and we ask for a 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.060
 great game but it's true 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:32.189
 well let's go to this game for your time 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.640
 to see is that it was a bit complicated my 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.640
 principle no 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:40.260
 but then it gets complicated the thing is 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:42.430
 that you have to go picking fruits 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:46.240
 Shooting 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.750
 the enemies that move a lot to the 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.220
 that treats a lot of something good 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.740
 you have to go eat fruits for 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:54.930
 survive up the apparent bars 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:57.210
 from above these are going down if not 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 take fruit 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.090
 and this one we also had videos ending 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.140
 in time we do as now it can be 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:06.140
 the toilet for example 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.659
 1 patiently give 

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:16.900
 that yes a life as a whole was a 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.900
 scare 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.409
 today according to you 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:29.200
 I ask you 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:31.270
 well then pull this back 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.990
 to phase 3 here I think I'm going 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.990
 keeping the phases 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:43.829
 there's too much complication they kill me but 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.829
 as if he is so chump 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.950
 I believe that I am phase 3 be perfect not 

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:51.260
 It happens a whole step forward time the 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:53.770
 advance that would be kept in quotes 

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.770
 the games 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:03.340
 we will go 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.689
 but if a rock falls 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.869
 Well, I remember the woman of the 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.869
 pull 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.780
 the edges that you see below colorines 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:15.080
 it was not my fault it's your debut fault of 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080
 game 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.670
 enough that we can play with 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.900
 emulators 

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.900
 with a teeth singing 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.360
 here's something the team will jump 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.390
 pull h 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.390
 and 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.340
 I'm not going back or bad 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.300
 If you also want other is that I was 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.220
 do all eyes that I upload in series 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.190
 but is that as you do not mention me below 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:52.370
 if you want to 

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.370
 that continues with the series or not at the moment 

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:58.640
 look like I like this series you can 

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:02.090
 do the four chapters got 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.090
 no more hassle 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.410
 started to upload mega man and expenses to 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:08.380
 go up subway metro and it's way more 

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.180
 complicated as normal 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:13.780
 it's not that it's more complicated but 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:17.610
 have more more things we're going 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:21.710
 what is a bitch because I can not stop 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.710
 not luxurious to slow down a little bit 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:32.209
 do not 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:32.209
 Vale phase 2 of fucking mother 

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:38.330
 past number with a skateboard but 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.280
 good if I tried 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:43.330
 Well, I 'm going to bring more insurance 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.390
 bring metroid and bring 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.390
 i 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.270
 metroid delivery 22 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:58.290
 I do not know when but I'll bring it 

00:03:56.069 --> 00:04:01.049
 now how am I to a video per day 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.120
 because this does not require any 

00:04:01.049 --> 00:04:05.310
 type of editing as 

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:07.610
 like the other jesus this is what you do and 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.610
 point 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:15.620
 freezing this means that you can not 

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.920
 spend nothing look I do not shoot all the 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:22.730
 world 

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:22.730
 as if you had an oxide a mackerel 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.409
 we are leaving, there is also the fourth 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.310
 sir I do not know how many phases each 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:35.310
 little island of this I think that has 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.350
 five oceans we will see 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.350
 at the moment this facilitates everything 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:51.159
 Do not come 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.150
 Well, if it is accurate, it is impossible 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.150
 hungry 

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.729
 plus 

00:04:59.150 --> 00:05:03.870
 41 life 

00:05:00.729 --> 00:05:03.870
 future contracts 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.710
 so I invite you patience and care 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:18.099
 this is a mixture of a 

00:05:15.289 --> 00:05:18.099
 it has not been done 

00:05:20.629 --> 00:05:25.639
 but I already say you balconies or as 

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.639
 entails 

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.020
 to see this is the good jump 

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:39.690
 bitch and you get something 

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.909
 well let's go there 

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:53.349
 Let's see 

00:05:48.169 --> 00:05:53.349
 ok do not come the bonus 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:57.390
 and good I have one more life as soon as 

00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.160
 To matter 

00:05:57.390 --> 00:06:03.170
 order and that also little 

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.170
 Nor heavy our eyes 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.670
 for here I do not know if it was already albos or not 

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.670
 he 

00:06:09.169 --> 00:06:13.569
 God 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:16.070
 since it is complicated that it is other than 

00:06:13.569 --> 00:06:19.630
 shoot palante of sides 

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.630
 I am very connected with these games 

00:06:22.310 --> 00:06:28.300
 and this delays the pump vehicles all 

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:31.380
 I am very connected with our games the 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:33.790
 who has refused is that the fucking controls 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:36.270
 they are quite complicated 

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:38.990
 three buttons 

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:38.990
 fuck 

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:45.830
 in a phase 2 phase 

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:45.830
 It feels like a life 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:51.629
 see how the work screen changes 

00:06:49.949 --> 00:06:53.990
 that what happens is that the graph is 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:53.990
 what madness 

00:06:57.249 --> 00:07:03.590
 I had to get to phase 3 

00:07:00.529 --> 00:07:06.080
 before I got any more bug 

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.260
 why is not it safe for them to kill that 

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:08.260
 country 

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.209
 I have denied the holy virgin 

00:07:13.529 --> 00:07:17.989
 is that fat point of shit 

00:07:15.209 --> 00:07:17.989
 I would jump in conditions 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:22.000
 what is it 

00:07:28.449 --> 00:07:31.449
 tradition 

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:35.010
 the mother who bore me 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:41.110

 daiwa other than a game of nintendo 

00:07:58.879 --> 00:08:03.120
