00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:06.460 
thirteen foot easily this year it's a

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:08.400 
thirteen foot easily this year it's a
little<00:03:06.580> bit<00:03:06.790> under<00:03:06.970> that<00:03:07.060> but<00:03:07.570> still<00:03:08.110> seems<00:03:08.350> to

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:08.410 
little bit under that but still seems to

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:11.100 
little bit under that but still seems to
be<00:03:08.500> growing<00:03:09.180> hopefully<00:03:10.180> we're<00:03:10.330> gonna<00:03:10.480> get

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
be growing hopefully we're gonna get

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.070 
be growing hopefully we're gonna get
about<00:03:11.350> what<00:03:11.800> we<00:03:11.920> did<00:03:12.070> last<00:03:12.250> year<00:03:12.520> some<00:03:13.210> cameras

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:14.080 
about what we did last year some cameras

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:19.020 
about what we did last year some cameras
this<00:03:14.260> way<00:03:15.450> some<00:03:16.450> really<00:03:16.690> twelve<00:03:17.020> plants<00:03:18.030> it's

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
this way some really twelve plants it's

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.729 
this way some really twelve plants it's
one<00:03:19.209> under<00:03:19.420> the<00:03:19.570> corn<00:03:19.840> leaf<00:03:20.020> here<00:03:20.260> you<00:03:20.380> can<00:03:20.530> see

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
one under the corn leaf here you can see

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:24.270 
one under the corn leaf here you can see
that's<00:03:20.950> pretty<00:03:21.100> tall<00:03:22.020> and<00:03:23.020> over<00:03:23.380> here<00:03:23.800> we<00:03:24.010> have

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
that's pretty tall and over here we have

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:27.990 
that's pretty tall and over here we have
my<00:03:24.610> patch<00:03:25.030> of<00:03:25.270> giant<00:03:26.020> amaranth

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
my patch of giant amaranth

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.870 
my patch of giant amaranth
there's<00:03:28.450> a<00:03:28.540> pretty<00:03:28.720> big<00:03:28.900> plants<00:03:29.350> over<00:03:29.590> there

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:29.880 
there's a pretty big plants over there

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.150 
there's a pretty big plants over there
some<00:03:30.880> probably<00:03:31.150> around<00:03:31.239> the<00:03:31.390> 20<00:03:31.810> foot<00:03:31.989> 19<00:03:32.890> 20

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:33.160 
some probably around the 20 foot 19 20

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:38.160 
some probably around the 20 foot 19 20
foot<00:03:33.400> area<00:03:34.709> they<00:03:35.709> are<00:03:36.070> a<00:03:36.100> hybrid<00:03:36.520> out<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.989> ones

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
foot area they are a hybrid out the ones

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.050 
foot area they are a hybrid out the ones
in<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.380> back<00:03:38.590> the<00:03:38.800> really<00:03:39.130> tall<00:03:39.370> ones<00:03:39.640> are<00:03:40.000> a

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.060 
in the back the really tall ones are a

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:43.979 
in the back the really tall ones are a
hybrid<00:03:40.840> of<00:03:41.020> a<00:03:41.770> tidal<00:03:42.760> marsh<00:03:42.940> amaranth<00:03:43.600> and<00:03:43.750> a

hybrid of a tidal marsh amaranth and a

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:46.710 
hybrid of a tidal marsh amaranth and a
giant<00:03:44.260> amaranth<00:03:44.770> I<00:03:45.430> grew<00:03:46.239> those<00:03:46.450> because<00:03:46.660> I

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:46.720 
giant amaranth I grew those because I

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:47.670 
giant amaranth I grew those because I
was<00:03:46.840> hoping<00:03:47.020> they'd<00:03:47.140> grow<00:03:47.320> quicker

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
was hoping they'd grow quicker

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.890 
was hoping they'd grow quicker
unfortunately<00:03:48.489> they<00:03:48.610> seem<00:03:48.850> to<00:03:48.970> flower<00:03:49.330> much

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:49.900 
unfortunately they seem to flower much

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:53.420 
unfortunately they seem to flower much
earlier<00:03:50.320> than<00:03:50.380> the<00:03:50.770> pure<00:03:51.340> giant<00:03:51.910> AMRAP

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:53.430 
earlier than the pure giant AMRAP

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.160 
earlier than the pure giant AMRAP
those<00:03:54.430> plants<00:03:55.030> actually<00:03:55.510> started<00:03:55.870> flowering

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:56.170 
those plants actually started flowering

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.199 
those plants actually started flowering
at<00:03:56.920> the<00:03:57.040> beginning<00:03:57.370> of<00:03:57.459> this<00:03:57.550> month<00:03:57.850> and<00:04:00.209> once

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
at the beginning of this month and once

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.780 
at the beginning of this month and once
they<00:04:01.390> started<00:04:01.780> to<00:04:01.860> flower<00:04:02.860> I<00:04:05.519> panicked<00:04:06.519> and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
they started to flower I panicked and

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.710 
they started to flower I panicked and
hoped<00:04:07.300> that<00:04:07.600> I<00:04:07.750> could<00:04:08.730> stop<00:04:09.730> them<00:04:10.030> from

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:10.720 
hoped that I could stop them from

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.590 
hoped that I could stop them from
flowering<00:04:11.470> so<00:04:11.709> what<00:04:12.010> I<00:04:12.040> did<00:04:12.340> at<00:04:13.060> least<00:04:13.209> to<00:04:13.390> slow

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
flowering so what I did at least to slow

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:16.199 
flowering so what I did at least to slow
it<00:04:13.750> down<00:04:14.010> so<00:04:15.010> what<00:04:15.160> I<00:04:15.190> did<00:04:15.430> was<00:04:15.640> I<00:04:15.670> tried

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:16.209 
it down so what I did was I tried

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:17.909 
it down so what I did was I tried
something<00:04:16.390> new<00:04:16.630> this<00:04:16.780> year<00:04:16.840> and<00:04:17.320> gave<00:04:17.739> them

00:04:17.909 --> 00:04:17.919 
something new this year and gave them

00:04:17.919 --> 00:04:19.890 
something new this year and gave them
really<00:04:18.190> high<00:04:18.340> doses<00:04:18.789> of<00:04:18.820> plant<00:04:19.120> hormones

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:19.900 
really high doses of plant hormones

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:22.920 
really high doses of plant hormones
to<00:04:20.169> try<00:04:21.160> to<00:04:21.220> increase<00:04:21.549> stem<00:04:21.970> elongation<00:04:22.000> and

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:22.930 
to try to increase stem elongation and

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:25.620 
to try to increase stem elongation and
it<00:04:23.259> seems<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.560> work<00:04:23.800> because<00:04:24.400> they<00:04:25.210> actually

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
it seems to work because they actually

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:28.439 
it seems to work because they actually
started<00:04:25.960> flowering<00:04:26.580> several<00:04:27.580> feet<00:04:27.790> above<00:04:28.000> the

00:04:28.439 --> 00:04:28.449 
started flowering several feet above the

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:31.620 
started flowering several feet above the
trellis<00:04:28.870> I<00:04:29.050> see<00:04:29.500> minor<00:04:30.009> flowering<00:04:30.940> on<00:04:31.150> the<00:04:31.419> top

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:31.630 
trellis I see minor flowering on the top

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.360 
trellis I see minor flowering on the top
of<00:04:31.780> the<00:04:31.840> plant<00:04:32.020> there's<00:04:32.229> some<00:04:32.410> on<00:04:32.560> the<00:04:32.650> more<00:04:33.310> of

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
of the plant there's some on the more of

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:36.659 
of the plant there's some on the more of
it's<00:04:33.520> on<00:04:33.639> the<00:04:33.759> sides<00:04:34.000> but<00:04:34.930> the<00:04:35.110> main<00:04:35.669> growing

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
it's on the sides but the main growing

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:38.580 
it's on the sides but the main growing
tip<00:04:37.030> of<00:04:37.180> the<00:04:37.240> plant<00:04:37.449> seems<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:38.020> have<00:04:38.139> very<00:04:38.350> few

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
tip of the plant seems to have very few

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:41.129 
tip of the plant seems to have very few
flowers<00:04:39.130> and<00:04:39.400> it<00:04:39.639> still<00:04:40.060> is<00:04:40.360> continuing<00:04:40.960> to

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:41.139 
flowers and it still is continuing to

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.689 
flowers and it still is continuing to
grow<00:04:41.560> I<00:04:41.949> mean<00:04:42.660> easily<00:04:43.660> has<00:04:43.960> grown<00:04:44.400> five<00:04:45.400> feet

00:04:45.689 --> 00:04:45.699 
grow I mean easily has grown five feet

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.969 
grow I mean easily has grown five feet
since<00:04:46.360> the<00:04:46.509> time<00:04:46.780> it<00:04:46.960> started<00:04:47.289> flowering<00:04:47.500> and

00:04:47.969 --> 00:04:47.979 
since the time it started flowering and

00:04:47.979 --> 00:04:50.990 
since the time it started flowering and
it's<00:04:48.400> growing<00:04:48.610> on<00:04:48.729> a<00:04:48.789> pretty<00:04:49.060> decent<00:04:49.449> clip<00:04:49.660> I

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
it's growing on a pretty decent clip I

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.110 
it's growing on a pretty decent clip I
have<00:04:52.000> not<00:04:52.479> seen<00:04:52.780> any<00:04:52.930> slowdown<00:04:53.440> whatsoever

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
have not seen any slowdown whatsoever

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:56.490 
have not seen any slowdown whatsoever
with<00:04:55.120> the<00:04:55.240> flowering<00:04:55.690> so<00:04:55.870> that's<00:04:56.050> a<00:04:56.139> good<00:04:56.289> sign

00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:56.500 
with the flowering so that's a good sign

00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:58.310 
with the flowering so that's a good sign
okay<00:04:57.220> let's<00:04:57.460> go<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:57.639> the<00:04:57.729> other<00:04:57.910> bathroom

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:36.239 
here is a pure giant amaranth this one's

00:05:36.239 --> 00:05:37.819 
here is a pure giant amaranth this one's
going<00:05:36.479> pretty<00:05:36.779> good<00:05:36.989> it's<00:05:37.199> up<00:05:37.319> to<00:05:37.469> the<00:05:37.559> window

going pretty good it's up to the window
here<00:05:39.860> this<00:05:40.860> plant<00:05:41.249> has<00:05:41.549> no<00:05:42.110> flowers

go and over to the left here
here's<00:05:54.539> a<00:05:55.249> sterile<00:05:56.249> hybrid<00:05:56.719> there's<00:05:57.719> another

00:05:57.949 --> 00:05:57.959 
here's a sterile hybrid there's another

00:05:57.959 --> 00:06:00.219 
here's a sterile hybrid there's another
one<00:05:58.199> down<00:05:58.349> here<00:05:58.409> this<00:05:58.709> one<00:05:58.919> kind<00:05:59.159> of<00:05:59.219> fell<00:05:59.369> over
