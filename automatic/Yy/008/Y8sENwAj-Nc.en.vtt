in there on a horse someplace they stay
on<00:01:46.119> horses<00:01:50.159> flies<00:01:51.159> are<00:01:51.340> amazing<00:01:51.670> they're

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:51.790 
on horses flies are amazing they're

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.330 
on horses flies are amazing they're
inside<00:01:52.119> they're<00:01:53.020> flying<00:01:53.380> all<00:01:53.740> over<00:01:53.770> the<00:01:54.250> place

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:54.340 
inside they're flying all over the place

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:55.980 
inside they're flying all over the place
until<00:01:54.790> they<00:01:54.909> find<00:01:55.150> a<00:01:55.240> mirror<00:01:55.540> have<00:01:55.900> you

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:55.990 
until they find a mirror have you

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:57.359 
until they find a mirror have you
noticed<00:01:56.259> that<00:01:56.320> they<00:01:56.470> find<00:01:56.680> a<00:01:56.770> bathroom<00:01:57.130> mirror

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
noticed that they find a bathroom mirror

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:58.920 
noticed that they find a bathroom mirror
and<00:01:57.610> they're<00:01:57.729> there<00:01:57.970> for<00:01:58.000> about<00:01:58.270> an<00:01:58.450> hour<00:01:58.570> they

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
and they're there for about an hour they

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.469 
and they're there for about an hour they
don't<00:01:59.080> move<00:01:59.229> I<00:02:00.030> think<00:02:01.030> it's<00:02:01.149> because<00:02:01.300> they

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
don't move I think it's because they

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:04.260 
don't move I think it's because they
think<00:02:01.540> they<00:02:02.080> found<00:02:02.320> another<00:02:02.530> fly<00:02:02.860> and<00:02:03.430> they're

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
think they found another fly and they're

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:05.520 
think they found another fly and they're
having<00:02:04.450> a<00:02:04.509> conversation<00:02:04.690> with<00:02:05.110> that<00:02:05.350> flight

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:05.530
