00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.860
 video editing program yo

 I usually use the sony vegas and the other 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.199
 program is the audacity then 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.879
 let's start the first step is to choose which 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.480
 we want to double or that will be our 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.190
 fan that 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.770
 once chosen what you want for your 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.570
 fan tab you must download the video with 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.640

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.770
 multiple formats youtube files 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.559
 this will help us to download our 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.480
 file that we will double continue and 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.570
 We download our video in format 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:53.670

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.190
 once downloaded this we open in 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.960
 audacity the mp3 of our archive 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.180
 here what we should do is divide the 

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.550
 stereo track to mono the two tracks of 

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:04.949
 audio and when we have our two 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.689
 tracks in mono we incorporate the effect 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.520
 of investment to the lower runway of the 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.170
 audio and there we will have our 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.270
 soundtrack without voices 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:16.110

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.340
