00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
then they go down and so basically if

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:14.990

you're<00:01:13.439> not<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.770> highest<00:01:13.979> you<00:01:14.580> don't<00:01:14.790> have<00:01:14.970> a

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.000 
you're not the highest you don't have a

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.550

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
whole bunch of chance in getting the

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.230 
whole bunch of chance in getting the
money<00:01:16.770> because<00:01:17.280> they<00:01:17.430> don't<00:01:17.640> have<00:01:17.700> any<00:01:18.060> much

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
money because they don't have any much

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.600 
money because they don't have any much
so<00:01:18.780> they<00:01:18.900> didn't<00:01:19.200> have<00:01:19.350> money<00:01:19.590> and<00:01:19.950> so<00:01:20.340> luckily

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
so they didn't have money and so luckily

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
so they didn't have money and so luckily
I<00:01:20.880> got<00:01:21.090> hope<00:01:21.479> from<00:01:21.900> one<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.229> my<00:01:22.320> family<00:01:22.740> members

realized they couldn't pay for it how to
take<00:01:43.950> all<00:01:44.130> their<00:01:44.340> stuff<00:01:44.610> back<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.630> not<00:01:45.960> even

money<00:01:56.700> together<00:01:56.969> like<00:01:57.509> just<00:01:57.869> know<00:01:58.110> where

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
money together like just know where

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.149 
money together like just know where
everything<00:01:59.310> is<00:01:59.399> coming<00:01:59.820> from

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:00.159 
everything is coming from

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:03.569 
everything is coming from
calculate<00:02:00.609> the<00:02:01.149> price<00:02:01.420> of<00:02:02.280> your<00:02:03.280> first

00:02:03.569 --> 00:02:03.579 
calculate the price of your first

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:05.219 
calculate the price of your first
semester<00:02:03.759> and<00:02:04.270> your<00:02:04.390> second<00:02:04.780> semester<00:02:04.899> is

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:05.229 
semester and your second semester is

00:02:05.229 --> 00:02:07.699 
semester and your second semester is
very<00:02:05.499> easy<00:02:05.740> leadership<00:02:06.670> first<00:02:06.969> semesters

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
very easy leadership first semesters

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:10.020 
very easy leadership first semesters
balance<00:02:08.709> you're<00:02:09.160> basically<00:02:09.670> going<00:02:09.940> to

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
balance you're basically going to

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.110 
balance you're basically going to
subtract<00:02:10.539> it<00:02:10.690> from<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.989> estimated<00:02:11.790> price<00:02:12.790> so

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
subtract it from the estimated price so

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:15.960 
subtract it from the estimated price so
I<00:02:13.390> mean<00:02:13.629> the<00:02:13.750> estimated<00:02:14.319> tuition<00:02:14.920> so<00:02:15.129> let's

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
I mean the estimated tuition so let's

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:19.770 
I mean the estimated tuition so let's
say<00:02:16.209> your<00:02:16.959> first<00:02:17.560> semester<00:02:18.030> covered<00:02:19.030> twenty

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
say your first semester covered twenty

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.720 
say your first semester covered twenty
five<00:02:20.019> thousand<00:02:20.709> and<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:21.220> says<00:02:21.459> that<00:02:21.489> the

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
five thousand and that says that the

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.059 
five thousand and that says that the
overall<00:02:22.360> expenses<00:02:23.349> are<00:02:23.500> going<00:02:23.560> to<00:02:23.709> be<00:02:23.769> thirty

00:02:24.059 --> 00:02:24.069 
overall expenses are going to be thirty

00:02:24.069 --> 00:02:26.070 
overall expenses are going to be thirty
six<00:02:24.430> thousand<00:02:24.910> you're<00:02:25.269> going<00:02:25.450> to<00:02:25.510> subtract<00:02:25.900> it

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
six thousand you're going to subtract it

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.420 
six thousand you're going to subtract it
from<00:02:26.110> each<00:02:26.410> other<00:02:26.650> and<00:02:26.920> then<00:02:27.069> you're<00:02:27.250> also

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
from each other and then you're also

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.390 
from each other and then you're also
going<00:02:27.640> to<00:02:27.940> put<00:02:28.720> in<00:02:28.959> half<00:02:29.440> of<00:02:29.709> your<00:02:29.890> financial

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
going to put in half of your financial

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.770 
going to put in half of your financial
aid<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:31.030> that<00:02:31.360> should<00:02:31.540> give<00:02:31.629> you<00:02:31.750> your

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
aid and that should give you your

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.830 
aid and that should give you your
remaining<00:02:32.230> balance<00:02:32.560> for<00:02:33.010> the<00:02:33.129> year<00:02:33.810> so<00:02:34.810> you

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
remaining balance for the year so you

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.690 
remaining balance for the year so you
should<00:02:35.079> definitely<00:02:35.440> try<00:02:35.560> to<00:02:35.650> figure<00:02:35.950> out<00:02:36.040> how

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
should definitely try to figure out how

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.520 
should definitely try to figure out how
much<00:02:37.000> you're<00:02:37.810> going<00:02:38.019> to<00:02:38.170> need<00:02:40.110> so<00:02:41.110> basically

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
much you're going to need so basically

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:46.650 
much you're going to need so basically
all<00:02:41.650> the<00:02:42.040> events<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.910> happened<00:02:43.629> um<00:02:45.660> second
