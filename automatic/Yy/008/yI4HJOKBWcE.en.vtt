into the hair mid lengths and ends and

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.690 
into the hair mid lengths and ends and
using<00:02:00.990> heat<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.560> really<00:02:01.830> emphasize<00:02:02.070> the

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
using heat to really emphasize the

using heat to really emphasize the
volume<00:02:03.240> and<00:02:03.390> make<00:02:03.929> that<00:02:04.080> put<00:02:04.350> up<00:02:04.440> work<00:02:04.649> for<00:02:04.979> you

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
volume and make that put up work for you

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.690 
volume and make that put up work for you
so<00:02:05.759> this<00:02:05.910> gave<00:02:06.119> me<00:02:06.390> a<00:02:06.690> mist<00:02:07.410> loooser<00:02:08.280> feel<00:02:08.519> to

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
so this gave me a mist loooser feel to

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.509 
so this gave me a mist loooser feel to
the<00:02:08.820> hair<00:02:09.110> and<00:02:10.110> then<00:02:10.259> to<00:02:10.380> finish<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.769> off<00:02:10.920> we

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
the hair and then to finish that off we

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:13.850 
the hair and then to finish that off we
used<00:02:11.940> force<00:02:12.390> to<00:02:12.690> really<00:02:13.230> hold<00:02:13.410> that<00:02:13.620> shape

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
used force to really hold that shape

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:27.600 
used force to really hold that shape
into<00:02:14.310> place<00:02:14.519> and<00:02:15.180> I<00:02:15.239> think<00:02:15.420> it<00:02:15.510> looks<00:02:15.630> fabulous

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.670
