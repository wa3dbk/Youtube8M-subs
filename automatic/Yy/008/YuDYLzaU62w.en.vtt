00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:14.639
 hello turns it 's back to 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.950
 victor yale makeup so this is a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.110
 simple makeup so we have to unify the 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.970
 eyelid and we made a dash 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.280
 eye liner with blue eyeshadow 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.110
 night suffers aurassi inside so 

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.350
 I mainly worked with the 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:31.230
 pallet paris from sigma and waltz 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.440
 so pallet of urban decay that justice 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.610
 it's very very simple to do 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.360
 I hope you like it, it says change 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.860
 orianne that I usually do 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.540
 I usually put everything on my face 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.040
 eyelids so according to mobile stone here 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.480
 I really wanted to emphasize the island 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.600
 really do a cat's eye if you 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.770
 really want in the eyes 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.870
 how I say had the good 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.310
 the long well deserved it is really the 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.780
 makeup that you need the blosne and 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.860
 you can replace with all 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.690
 colors that you want for example the 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.210
 spring and varied you can the 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.130
 pity you replace it with green blue 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.899
 turquoise 

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.430
 finally really you can adapt it 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.360
 as you want - the prices of the blue 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.530
 night because today I was 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.090
 dressed in nude blue simply 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.829
 finally here girls volleyball is 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.950
 that he says nothing then as usual 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:12.719
 I apply a base so always the 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.880
 penven of evil when anne minh you reread 

00:01:12.719 --> 00:01:17.100
 and I track the entire eyelid 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.350
 and I make sure in my right hand 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.569
 inferior seen how to put makeup on 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.560
 eyelids to follow while they 

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:24.389
 hold all day 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.310
 so when these do I use the 

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.799
 urban ride dickey and I come 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:32.509
 take the anonymous lighthouse that justifies 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:34.770
 if with a fluffy brush like these 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:37.810
 and come back unified all the eyelid 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.550
 mobile is the fixed eyelid to avoid 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.260
 to see the veins or and that was the end 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.430
 imperfections that adventure 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.750
 the eyelid to have a clean cut 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:49.909
 always from the aespa lehto takes the lighthouse 

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.010
 lists with a liability did it as 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:53.450
 this is May 25 at sigma and 

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:55.160
 I come to trace the hollow of the eye 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.490
 just to say to support as long as the 

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.490
 look 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:09.729
 so now i'm going to come traced out my 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.140
 Elsewhere I will not give you 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.840
 explanations now if you want 

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:15.220
 you do a tutorial to link it 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.540
 will start ringing again liner treats 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.140
 let me know in the comments in 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.140
 below the video 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:22.990
 so either to draw my liner I am 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.050
 take the precise mask from mary lyn 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:28.830
 I think so, that's it's a tip 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.420
 fine like these which is pretty accurate 

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:33.450
 and so I come to trace our emails and 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.450
 our 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.460
 we see there the line of liner and racé 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.880
 now we are going to come take a 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.130
 fine brush so like these and the 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.460
 see scene of the palette paris of chez 

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:12.660

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.660
 the previous rat poison 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:32.430

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.830
 so they really quite fluently they 

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:46.080
