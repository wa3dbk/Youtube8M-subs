00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:05.040
 one of the examples of indie games 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.290
 sometimes they are a step ahead of the big ones 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.540
 trippy projects already proved faster 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.610
 than light and many others before it 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.679
 but often in such independent 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.450
 development focuses on one thing 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.970
 and brings already defined game 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.369
 element to mind today in the first release 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.710
 andy for a snack we look at kentucky 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:33.510
 elder finalists independent games 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:35.399
 festival in the category best story game 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.370
 manages from beginning to end 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.960
 the first act to keep the atmosphere 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.980
 mysticism of what is happening at the same time 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.079
 tensions 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.969
 that after some time you will 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:48.180
 feel like not in your 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:49.980
 the plate a lot in the game creates a secret and you 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.829
 ready to get more out and get 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 answers but having passed the first act you understand 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.949
 what do you want at least a little more 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 that atmosphere 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.989
 what makes the game ideally the first 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.550
 the part is not as long as 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.550
 stick to the right path 

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:18.110
 but if you start exploring local 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.360
 back streets you will not lose anything alish 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.270
 get a lot of impressions from 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.770
 how simple and at the same time 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.630
 excellently made this game you 

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:29.090
 start your way to the refueling 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:31.280
 station detecting that you are playing a law 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.040
 and the delivery man 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.330
 antiques that are lost and looking 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.850
 the road he needs 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.280
 this is the main goal in the game 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.930
 find the road at number zero in fact 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.630
 offer us limited opportunities 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:46.610
 in management basically you can only 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.430
 move around and talk to people 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.229
 whom you will meet and do not be afraid 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.479
 such a limited arsenal of gaming 

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.729
 believe the mechanics that the game 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:02:00.560
 offers she copes quite well 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:02:02.660
 and sometimes even more in the dialogues you 

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.790
 choose what the canvas will say and and 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:06.470
 this is not one of those games where you are 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.050
 choosing the right option in the dialogue 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.300
 pass one or another moment in the game 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.570
 here every conversation is filled 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.490
 atmosphere and creates a certain flavor 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:19.040
 for example how would you call your dog 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.590
 you were late for work because of a hangover if 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.080
 storm options that you choose 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.959
 very important because it is through them 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.390
 you build a pre-history canvas i 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:31.670
 the personality is a given choice in this game 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:33.950
 not available in advance 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.080
 the plot in real life we ​​just 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.760
 talking we move on we don't 

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.590
 fail shopping in the store and only 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.140
 just because you forgot to buy milk 

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.910
 we can do it later and in this game 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.640
 similar to reality you accept 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:49.160
 decision and no matter if they are correct or not 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.100
 because as a rule there is no right way 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.440
 and we just move forward in the game not 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.510
 so much music or sound effects 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.209
 but where they should be you them 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.160
 to meet her sometimes you even wonder with 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.590
 playing guitar people somewhere on 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:06.340
 foreground while you will 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:06.340
 somewhere far away 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:24.530
 if a 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:26.750
 she is 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.940
 the end of the first act you will have 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:31.130
 feeling like you saw one of 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.680
 strange dreams that are hard to remember 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:36.319
 but the feeling during such a dream was 

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:38.360
 inexpressible mysticism that create 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.160
 developers are quite understandable something 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.410
 inexplicable happen in one of 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.120
 evenings with our courier escort but 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:47.120
 we have to learn it only in 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.770
 the next act and on this I still do not 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.290
 forget to subscribe to new releases 

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:53.290
 and with you was the edge before the meeting
