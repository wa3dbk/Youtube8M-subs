00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:04.460
 I started playing I had 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.100
 9 years maybe 9 years 

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.430
 he begins to study the piano then I discovered that I could 

00:00:11.129 --> 00:00:14.969
 I could give up the canonical books a little and do some of that 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:20.499
 that I certainly wanted to use it as a means of communication 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:24.829
 and so around the 12th 13 years he started writing my pieces 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.029
 in addition to the piano started to play the guitar not his very well though 

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:36.000
 writing to the reminder also write some things, I like guitar in every 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 case is a different breath than the piano 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:43.890
 to me too you are a crazy omg 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.980
 it is a piece that speaks of the end of a cohabitation 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.080
 it is not autobiographical 

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.790
 however in sum we found ourselves with saverio 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.850
 because I respect in an infinite way 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.080
 we found with him to write this piece we immediately trad in tune 

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.140
 also on what we want to talk about then 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.899
 the discourse of the end of cohabitation is a metaphor obviously now 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:13.389
 you make the fool we talk about empty rooms we talk about ram eyes closed but really 

00:01:13.389 --> 00:01:15.820
 in the sense of flying 

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.850
 look the other way because sometimes you can't 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.950
 between rationalize one then metabolize right away maybe you first time 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.950
 not to simply look 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.510
 generally when I write 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.690
 I'm one who pays a lot of attention to music 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.240
 so much weight to words 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.270
 but I am also aware of the fact that holy music 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.520
 irrational and instinctive 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.090
 awn amber must keep that component there in the sense it must anyway 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.110
 being impulsive 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.950
 you will say that generally this is the beginning of a rush idea in something me 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.630
 i want one in care i try to find 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.729
 for a music that can give this idea 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.110
 first of all to me 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:12.239
 if he then ties it up, then the music that starts first 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:16.340
 the night because it returns in my texts probably clothes come to me at night 

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:19.410
 manage not to be nini 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:24.859
 also because in short there was alda merini bici rai and at the moment more 

00:02:24.859 --> 00:02:27.069
 nice is the night no when you 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.540
 when all my awareness lets go 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.069
 and therefore 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.649
 probably because of the night chases a little in my texts and al 

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:37.849
 moment in which 

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.239
 and of wind lets me go I become olympus ivo also not being for it 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:44.199
 nature 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:49.829
 look and I will be a nice memory because it was still euro 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.759
 a period 

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:55.299
 nice for me because he's 21 years old 

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:57.259
 twenty years anxiety be 

00:02:57.259 --> 00:03:01.729
 to be discovered the big record company has taken to san remo 

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:03.759
 in short, remained 

00:03:03.759 --> 00:03:09.059
 It was a beautiful moment, probably I also have unripe vamos I would like that 

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:12.469
 we will be a you 

00:03:12.469 --> 00:03:18.029
 something that is not an eye navigator in the sense but there are clichÃ©s 

00:03:18.029 --> 00:03:20.129
 no they then form 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.129
 then at the talent show in san remo 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:26.129
 we will be an amazing opportunity for those who make music 

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:28.959
 we could not deny it 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:33.009
 but you can go there just because I did it and I know it 

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:35.910
 we must go there with knowledge of the facts 

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:39.490
 in short, the right time is for 

00:03:40.249 --> 00:03:44.689
 i wish i would like it to be something co 

00:03:44.689 --> 00:03:46.639
 the right one at the right time
