eat ain't here is your boy for this part
so<00:06:10.629> fire<00:06:10.900> those<00:06:11.139> things<00:06:11.439> just<00:06:12.159> pretty<00:06:12.370> much

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:12.490 
so fire those things just pretty much

00:06:12.490 --> 00:06:16.260 
so fire those things just pretty much
dish<00:06:12.960> just<00:06:13.960> fly<00:06:14.229> right<00:06:14.469> through<00:06:14.770> them<00:06:15.339> Ryan

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:16.270 
dish just fly right through them Ryan

00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:19.189 
dish just fly right through them Ryan
the<00:06:16.419> huge<00:06:16.629> gap<00:06:16.900> he<00:06:17.469> should<00:06:17.740> be<00:06:17.770> all<00:06:18.009> the<00:06:18.250> doctor

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:19.199 
the huge gap he should be all the doctor

00:06:19.199 --> 00:06:22.230 
the huge gap he should be all the doctor
and<00:06:20.199> again<00:06:20.860> wait<00:06:21.339> till<00:06:21.490> Carmelita<00:06:21.939> shoots

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:22.240 
and again wait till Carmelita shoots

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.760 
and again wait till Carmelita shoots
clockwork<00:06:22.779> at<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:23.020> certain<00:06:23.229> part<00:06:23.499> of<00:06:23.529> his<00:06:23.650> body

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:23.770 
clockwork at a certain part of his body

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:27.959 
clockwork at a certain part of his body
and<00:06:24.099> then<00:06:24.669> shoot<00:06:25.180> at<00:06:25.419> that<00:06:25.719> area<00:06:26.849> so<00:06:27.849> I<00:06:27.879> think

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:27.969 
and then shoot at that area so I think

00:06:27.969 --> 00:06:29.839 
and then shoot at that area so I think
the<00:06:28.210> next<00:06:28.419> one<00:06:28.569> should<00:06:28.719> be<00:06:28.779> on<00:06:29.050> this<00:06:29.139> other<00:06:29.289> way

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:29.849 
the next one should be on this other way

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:37.379 
the next one should be on this other way
go<00:06:33.479> ok<00:06:34.770> Carmelita<00:06:35.770> fires<00:06:36.009> again

00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:37.389 
go ok Carmelita fires again

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:42.359 
go ok Carmelita fires again
she'll<00:06:38.389> probably<00:06:38.419> fire<00:06:38.929> at<00:06:39.199> its<00:06:39.349> head<00:06:39.619> oh

00:06:42.359 --> 00:06:42.369 

00:06:42.369 --> 00:06:47.019
