00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.450
 Hello everyone I am today 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:10.019
 the nokia asha carry you five in front of it 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:12.660
 is a dual sim mobile phone where it is good 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.660
 a touch mobile phone with 12 inch screen 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.520
 and costs only 80 euros 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:20.580
 when I saw that bavaria thought 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:23.090
 i alright let i just order a lot 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.410
 I can not much lose 50 euros 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:29.400
 came as noticed I have 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.439
 I realized it is easy after that 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.369
 noticed that is a 2 megapixel 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:37.620
 camera installed 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:41.760
 without lightning on the scarf a bit but 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.649
 right at the beginning noticed here 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.000
 there is that for the second sim card 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.690
 and the memory card slot for 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.930
 Memory cards social 30 gigabytes 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:57.410
 When we think about losing weight I have it 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 first dropped as well 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.969
 But you can hear that was plastic garbage as 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.909
 also felt or on weight you have 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:09.240
 also noticed that plastic the manacor 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:18.270
 exception is here on the bottom 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:20.130
 the 1100 mm thick so I focus 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.820
 was with my camera itself 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:26.610
 Well, quite loud when I open it 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:29.579
 permanent folk I do it will be 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:32.070
 always a bit longer here we see 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:34.310
 that it resembles here under the cover 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.570
 the sim card number one installed 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:39.990
 are inserted that is what also sat 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:44.729
 1 if we make a lid so 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:47.850
 poke it in again and neckel again 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.220
 we could do the same 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:53.180
 but I'll tell you something else 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.619
 I have so many here at the side 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:02:00.299
 quietly and the lockscreen is there 

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.759
 Unfortunately no photo button which I'm sorry 

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:04.350
 think it's great because suddenly come camera 

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.740
 That's why I had to start over 

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.280
 I start 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.420
 up here we see a 3.5 mm 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:15.530
 jack connection on youtube too 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:21.400
 called micro usb standard under nokia 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:21.400
 nokia father now exactly the same 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:27.380
 the first thing I noticed here completely 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.090
 just nokia so I expected 

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:31.870
 that shake hands now but comes 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.690
 No, unfortunately not 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:38.920
 Although second rate of blau.de must 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.920
 I'll write a password right away 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:56.580
 Now think about his time now look 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.370
 it's true that password a bit 

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:02.370
 longer until it is a bit slow 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:05.430
 the operating system is symbian s40 has 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:12.330
 no wlan but at least they had 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:19.110
 two sim-cards 80 euro as I said 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:21.170
 no handshake is a pity 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:23.270
 again against an opponent quickly 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.890
 here 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:29.550
 here it is tiring the media that 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:32.880
 you will be able to go this way and that 

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:37.320
 this is the caller here the menu mask 

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:40.700
 by the way down here and yes that 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:43.500
 normally out in measured menu 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.270
 So that would not be in the videos I show 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:49.530
 you like the time you want between the 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.720
 two SIM cards changes see up here 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.040
 Welcome blue.de and the greens 

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:55.830
 lit the sim card is the 

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:59.040
 now that is being used so if i have 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:00.810
 press studio sessions then I search 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.640
 either the first or the second off 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:08.840
 I decide now for the second 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:12.630
 it is the second one lit here 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:16.130
 can i call and write sms 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:18.600
 from the mhtg has been selected and so 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:24.900
 has a normal takes on the three 

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.670
 player if it concerns then it looks me 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.960
 I have a lot of annoying songs 

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:30.690
 post afr a bit long until that 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:31.920
 Radio has opened the tickets 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.640
 I think I will be interesting to you 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:39.500
 Do not show everyone normally 

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:39.500
 these are located via a satellite yes 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:48.960
 mobile data not able no matter 

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:50.910
 This cellphone will be over a funkmast 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.910
 you will find out immediately 

00:04:50.910 --> 00:04:55.890
 about when satellite is accurate 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:59.390
 but takes a long time did not take long 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:06.350
 on board sort of 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:08.510
 but her quickly same time this has 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.180
 he captured me correctly this time he has 

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:13.700
 he is always bad, always bad 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.000
 That's why another radio mast is chosen 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:20.240
 already the third time dglg 200 gave earlier 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.160
 it's such a funkmast here and in the past 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.410
 There was quite a place somewhere 

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:33.530
 somewhere back here a year at the 

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:36.160
 Railway road application after 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:39.410
 I wanted to show through the camera 

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:44.810
 that was surprisingly good so i have 

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:46.160
 said okay 2 megapixel nokia a and a 

00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:49.130
 screen is not synonymous itself 

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:51.920
 good resistive then oh my god the 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:54.560
 photos very bad from what I because the 

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.900
 photos made and downloaded to the PC 

00:05:54.560 --> 00:06:01.520
 Boah I was surprised the photos 

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:02.810
 were surprisingly good and I was sharp 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:04.760
 I would recommend that now 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.950
 now it's down zonelink 

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:08.270
 Illuminated there I would just look 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:11.060
 Now go take a look at the photos 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.350
 get up nokia asha 300 5 then you can 

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:15.050
 you look what photos I with it 

00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.730
 So what did I do after all ? 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:21.040
 Handy surprised here apart 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:27.550
 First of photos is a multi touch 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:27.550
 resistive multitouch surprising 

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:33.439
 Now the memory card was full and closed 

00:06:31.789 --> 00:06:36.769
 Last but not least, you can still do that 

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:40.339
 make videos but I have the same 

00:06:36.769 --> 00:06:43.519
 the videos were are it the absolute 

00:06:40.339 --> 00:06:46.819
 Contrary to photos the videos are 

00:06:43.519 --> 00:06:47.569
 just bad when i put it over 

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:50.959
 carried 

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:56.949
 Here you can start to find one then 

00:06:50.959 --> 00:06:56.949
 one can change one can also look at 

00:06:59.079 --> 00:07:02.359
 that's it with today's 

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:04.519
 presentation 

00:07:02.359 --> 00:07:07.789
 if you have any further questions or 

00:07:04.519 --> 00:07:11.569
 so she just turns me on, I will 

00:07:07.789 --> 00:07:14.029
 answer all of you and still too good 

00:07:11.569 --> 00:07:16.339
 Last and the last tip will be yes 

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:17.659
 Mobile just looks for calling 

00:07:16.339 --> 00:07:21.399
 maybe such a flight fast 

00:07:17.659 --> 00:07:23.389
 take a photo or and year 2000 cards 

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:26.149
 and did not want more than 100 

00:07:23.389 --> 00:07:31.009
 it is the absolute one 

00:07:26.149 --> 00:07:36.819
 perfect for the water to the 

00:07:31.009 --> 00:07:36.819
 next time and for that was the youth
