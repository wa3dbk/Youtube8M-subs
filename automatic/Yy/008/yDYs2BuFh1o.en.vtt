here for something else on the side like

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.270 
here for something else on the side like
another<00:00:54.930> flash<00:00:55.289> or<00:00:56.239> currently<00:00:57.239> I<00:00:57.329> have<00:00:57.449> a

another flash or currently I have a
ExpoDisc<00:00:59.280> in<00:00:59.789> here<00:01:00.770> but<00:01:01.770> I<00:01:01.829> could<00:01:01.980> very<00:01:02.100> easily

00:01:02.349 --> 00:01:02.359 
ExpoDisc in here but I could very easily

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.740 
ExpoDisc in here but I could very easily
put<00:01:03.359> another<00:01:03.570> flash<00:01:03.899> in<00:01:04.140> here<00:01:04.400> so<00:01:05.750> there's

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
put another flash in here so there's

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.719 
put another flash in here so there's
plenty<00:01:06.900> of<00:01:07.140> room<00:01:07.380> inside<00:01:07.830> of<00:01:08.280> it

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
plenty of room inside of it

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.490 
plenty of room inside of it
however<00:01:10.580> with<00:01:11.580> my<00:01:11.729> 5d<00:01:12.210> mark<00:01:12.840> ii<00:01:12.900> and<00:01:13.380> that

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
however with my 5d mark ii and that

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.670 
however with my 5d mark ii and that
24-105<00:01:14.070> i<00:01:14.700> have<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.810> the<00:01:15.990> hood<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.439> the

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
24-105 i have to have the hood in the

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.530 
24-105 i have to have the hood in the
closed<00:01:17.520> position<00:01:17.820> if<00:01:18.509> I<00:01:18.830> put<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:19.979> hood<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.540> its

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
closed position if I put the hood on its

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.170 
closed position if I put the hood on its
exit<00:01:21.930> wrong<00:01:22.110> now<00:01:22.320> but<00:01:22.380> that's<00:01:22.920> better<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.610> the

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
exit wrong now but that's better in the

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.590 
exit wrong now but that's better in the
on<00:01:25.170> position<00:01:25.229> I<00:01:26.009> can't<00:01:26.820> close<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> bag<00:01:27.360> pretty

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
on position I can't close the bag pretty

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.100 
on position I can't close the bag pretty
well<00:01:28.280> so<00:01:29.390> that's<00:01:30.390> something<00:01:30.570> to<00:01:30.720> keep<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:31.049> mind

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
well so that's something to keep in mind

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.770 
well so that's something to keep in mind
I<00:01:31.530> think<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> sling<00:01:32.009> bag<00:01:32.250> a<00:01:32.549> single<00:01:33.270> Matic<00:01:33.479> 20

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
I think the sling bag a single Matic 20

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.109 
I think the sling bag a single Matic 20
it's<00:01:34.409> probably<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.829> better<00:01:34.950> choice<00:01:35.340> so

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:38.119 
it's probably the better choice so

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:41.480 
it's probably the better choice so
there's<00:01:39.119> a<00:01:39.210> little<00:01:39.530> handle<00:01:40.530> here<00:01:40.590> to<00:01:41.070> grab<00:01:41.280> it

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
there's a little handle here to grab it

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.929 
there's a little handle here to grab it
in<00:01:41.579> the<00:01:41.610> wells<00:01:42.180> in<00:01:42.299> the<00:01:42.329> handle<00:01:42.780> here<00:01:43.939> there's

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
in the wells in the handle here there's

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:54.249 
in the wells in the handle here there's
a<00:01:45.000> nice<00:01:45.149> top<00:01:45.420> pocket<00:01:46.850> side<00:01:47.990> pocket<00:01:48.990> here

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:58.460 

right<00:01:55.259> pocket<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.030> there's<00:01:57.990> tons<00:01:58.320> of

00:01:58.460 --> 00:01:58.470 
right pocket here so there's tons of

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:00.230 
right pocket here so there's tons of
storage<00:01:58.680> space<00:01:59.159> despite<00:01:59.579> it<00:01:59.729> being<00:01:59.759> at<00:02:00.000> really

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
storage space despite it being at really

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.520 
storage space despite it being at really
small<00:02:00.509> bag<00:02:01.490> and<00:02:02.490> what's<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.820> cool<00:02:03.530> it's

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
small bag and what's really cool it's

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.509 
small bag and what's really cool it's
got<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> really<00:02:05.009> thick<00:02:06.560> padded<00:02:09.950> strap<00:02:10.950> here<00:02:11.280> and

00:02:11.509 --> 00:02:11.519 
got a really thick padded strap here and

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:15.440 
got a really thick padded strap here and
on<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.420> other<00:02:12.540> side<00:02:14.030> pocket<00:02:15.030> where<00:02:15.180> you<00:02:15.300> could

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
on the other side pocket where you could

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.570 
on the other side pocket where you could
actually<00:02:15.599> put<00:02:15.959> a<00:02:16.340> lightweight<00:02:17.340> hiking<00:02:18.260> tripod

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
actually put a lightweight hiking tripod

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.350 
actually put a lightweight hiking tripod
so<00:02:21.230> despite<00:02:22.230> its<00:02:22.410> compact<00:02:22.620> size<00:02:23.160> it's<00:02:24.060> quite

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:24.360 
so despite its compact size it's quite

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.220 
so despite its compact size it's quite
good<00:02:24.390> and<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.930> is<00:02:24.989> padded<00:02:25.980> as<00:02:26.130> well<00:02:26.340> so

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:27.230 
good and this is padded as well so

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:31.100 
good and this is padded as well so
despite<00:02:28.230> my<00:02:28.260> disdain<00:02:28.860> for<00:02:29.190> sling<00:02:29.700> bags<00:02:30.110> it's

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
despite my disdain for sling bags it's

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:34.250 
despite my disdain for sling bags it's
really<00:02:31.290> quite<00:02:31.470> comfortable<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:33.049> that's<00:02:34.049> kind

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
really quite comfortable so that's kind

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.680 
really quite comfortable so that's kind
of<00:02:34.290> a<00:02:34.380> quick<00:02:34.500> overview<00:02:34.709> up<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.880> bag<00:02:36.060> consult
