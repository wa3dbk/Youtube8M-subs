00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:33.050
 add mode add this little balloon 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.090
 by which we can browse our 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.260
 world well happy and quietly like 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.540
 can see the animations are 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:40.610
 pretty good there we see health and all 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.010
 we see everything perfect and here too 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.750
 we can see how the propellers those and 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.510
 well I'm very happy here sailing 

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:49.790
 how can you realize here 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.540
 for my bridge and the truth is very 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.579
 ok this mod 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:55.280
 it's like to be peacefully by 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:56.840
 your world and good so that it works 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.390
 What do you send in our balloon? 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.920
 have carbon in our inventory as 

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.170
 they will be able to realize they are consuming 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.089
 you have to put it where you want and then 

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.610
 automatically nothing else will work 

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:10.250
 Do not forget the coal too 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.590
 we can shoot arrows with control 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.049
 right I do not say the left control anymore 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.729
 well and well, what will happen is 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.829
 I'm going to zoom in as you can 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.049
 account because I have the optician and the 

00:01:18.829 --> 00:01:23.450
 Optical, what he does is get hold of 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:25.340
 the left control not but how can 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.889
 listen and as you can see below the 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.109
 arrows are decreasing that wants 

00:01:27.889 --> 00:01:31.850
 say that we are shooting and so 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:34.159
 Well , I'll take the zoom out and jacques stop 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.539
 shoot not good to go down we need to 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.359
 then press the key with which we 

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:40.310
 we crouch in this way and we are supposed to 

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:44.270
 it has to come down only the movements 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:46.609
 are slow for this balloon and do not want 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:48.770
 bye bye bye bye we go well happy to 

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:51.079
 down to rise we need 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.819
 press the space key something very 

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:55.249
 logical and obviously to move anything 

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:57.600
 plus the w key of the keys 

00:01:55.249 --> 00:02:00.240
 basic to move 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.610
 let's go let's calculate we are 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.220
 all pilots look just look at nothing 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:08.069
 look nothing more than landing more 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.560
 perfect haha you guys can even put 

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:12.120
 what would be a guy a type 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.160
 place to park your balloon and in 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.810
 happy of life and good while there 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:17.880
 our balloon is rotting 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.730
 to see the craft and how it can be given 

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:22.110
 account here I have what they sold 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.280
 cloisters then we're going to put in 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.500
 the crafter table so they can see what it is 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.239
 what each does each thing not when 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.220
 we need some leather around and 

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.330
 will give us the ball as I have 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.500
 our ball 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.390
 we need to make this kraft but 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.780
 also with iron and a piston in the 

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.670
 center then we do it quickly 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:42.010
 to see how you can find out here 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.500
 we give engine the engine we need it for 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:45.730
 let our globe work and simply 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:48.670
 we put what had been our 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 globito here a furnace in the center what 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:54.010
 that would be string or remember 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:57.100
 those in the corners two engines in each 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.989
 side and a boat down in this way we 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.830
 has to give the crafter only I do not know 

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.730
 why do not I live in this one this time 

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:06.569
 it makes me that's why it comes 

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.269
 being the fornells 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:11.909
 we are going to put is that how will be given 

00:03:09.269 --> 00:03:13.590
 account there are two types of furnace there is 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:14.999
 As you can see, the oven changes and now 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:17.099
 is our plastic we have our 

00:03:14.999 --> 00:03:19.739
 ship and now we can just 

00:03:17.099 --> 00:03:23.670
 put where we want to go to 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:25.379
 put it here or jojo what perfection 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.159
 and we can go well happy 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:30.659
 again for our world 

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:33.480
 and well I put this taste of this 

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.680
 that's what I add 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.930
 I would recommend the creator of the mod that 

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:39.389
 they had animation the bullets rather 

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:41.639
 the arrows not because when you shoot 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.680
 they look like you can realize 

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:45.569
 shot and arrows are not seen by 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.590
 some strange reason I also 

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:49.019
 I would recommend the creator of the molds 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:50.549
 that I put a kind of I do not know explosives 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.919
 salgado something that released the balloon for 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:54.959
 make it a little more entertaining but 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:57.000
 outside of that, our 

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.620
 globito is because you like it this way 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.879
 and let's see how it is installed and good 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.829

 folder comes minimized after 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.150
 to need deleted from the folder 

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.370
 goal and since if it's there then it's going to 

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:24.780

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.250
 you get it and vice you have to put it 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.750
 then we select everything and we have it 

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:36.600
 amen that founded heart and we're going to 

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:38.760
 automatically accept the goal and it goes 

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:40.410
 to pass this metal do not eliminate it since 

00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:42.480
 it's in the way so it's not going to affect anything 

00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.310
 more eliminate the first one and we already close what 

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:46.380
 that he was doing our mods and he 

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:48.150
 minecraft dot hard we open now the 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:50.280
 bean folder that we minimized a while ago 

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:52.440
 knots a space back and here where 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.500
 it was fine resort 6 and others we click 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:57.150
 right new folder mods or take a 

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.520
 new carteya mammoths and inside that 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.560
 folder we put the steam ship of this 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:04.080
 way we just drag the file 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.730
 direct and ready I would have to stay 

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.070
 all perfection without any kind of 

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:09.710
 crash any kind of failure then 

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:11.910
 we open our minecraft so you can see 

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.010
 and anything that the escrache 

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.690
 Make sure you have what 

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:17.430
 so it would be no way 

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:19.410
 installed since if they have some way 

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:20.730
 that is not compatible will grow 

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:23.280
 let's go to the modes and here is our 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:24.610
 skin sip is already well installed and good 

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:28.500
 hits because he likes 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.500
 do not feel and goodbye
