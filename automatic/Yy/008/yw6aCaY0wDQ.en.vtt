00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
the first fable was really good and I

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.250 
the first fable was really good and I
was<00:02:33.940> actually<00:02:34.209> quite<00:02:34.300> nervous<00:02:34.660> when<00:02:34.989> I<00:02:35.020> heard

was actually quite nervous when I heard

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:36.720 
was actually quite nervous when I heard
that<00:02:35.319> they<00:02:35.620> were<00:02:35.650> planning<00:02:35.920> on<00:02:36.190> changing<00:02:36.400> it

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
that they were planning on changing it

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.880 
that they were planning on changing it
for<00:02:36.910> the<00:02:37.000> sequel<00:02:37.470> especially<00:02:38.470> when<00:02:38.590> I<00:02:38.650> heard

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:38.890 
for the sequel especially when I heard

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:40.559 
for the sequel especially when I heard
that<00:02:38.950> they<00:02:39.489> had<00:02:39.640> planned<00:02:39.880> a<00:02:39.940> really<00:02:40.150> simple

00:02:40.559 --> 00:02:40.569 
that they had planned a really simple

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.050 
that they had planned a really simple
system<00:02:41.050> however<00:02:41.890> they<00:02:42.400> have<00:02:42.430> come<00:02:42.700> up<00:02:42.819> with<00:02:43.030> a

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:43.060 
system however they have come up with a

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.300 
system however they have come up with a
really<00:02:43.360> clever<00:02:43.720> solution<00:02:44.430> you<00:02:45.430> should<00:02:45.610> get

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
really clever solution you should get

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.980 
really clever solution you should get

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:21.710 
more when i had completed it in all able

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.890 
more when i had completed it in all able
to<00:05:21.740> as<00:05:22.250> a<00:05:22.340> game<00:05:22.729> that<00:05:22.910> very<00:05:23.150> much<00:05:23.360> builds<00:05:23.750> on

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:23.900 
to as a game that very much builds on

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:26.350 
to as a game that very much builds on
the<00:05:24.560> best<00:05:24.919> parts<00:05:25.220> from<00:05:25.340> his<00:05:25.520> predecessor<00:05:26.060> and

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:26.360 
the best parts from his predecessor and

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:28.390 
the best parts from his predecessor and
it's<00:05:26.780> probably<00:05:27.020> even<00:05:27.139> closer<00:05:27.500> to<00:05:27.740> what<00:05:27.919> Melina

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
it's probably even closer to what Melina

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.330 
it's probably even closer to what Melina
and<00:05:28.690> dissipated<00:05:29.690> the<00:05:29.720> first<00:05:29.960> came<00:05:30.169> to<00:05:30.320> be<00:05:30.500> it's

00:05:33.919 --> 00:05:35.650 
got a exceptionally good fighting system
that's<00:05:34.130> far<00:05:34.520> better<00:05:34.699> than<00:05:35.000> in<00:05:35.150> the<00:05:35.180> first<00:05:35.270> game

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:35.660 
that's far better than in the first game

00:05:35.660 --> 00:05:39.370 
that's far better than in the first game
and<00:05:35.900> also<00:05:36.880> the<00:05:37.880> story<00:05:38.180> in<00:05:38.389> itself<00:05:38.690> is<00:05:38.900> just<00:05:39.169> far

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.380 
and also the story in itself is just far

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.040

better<00:05:40.030> unfortunately<00:05:41.030> it's<00:05:41.270> far<00:05:41.599> too<00:05:41.630> short

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:42.050 
better unfortunately it's far too short
