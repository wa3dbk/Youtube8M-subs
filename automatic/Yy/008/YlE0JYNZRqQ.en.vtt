farm supply incorporated and we're going
to<00:00:03.840> do<00:00:03.959> a<00:00:03.990> float<00:00:04.259> test<00:00:04.500> on<00:00:04.740> these<00:00:04.830> Ekans<00:00:05.220> that

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
to do a float test on these Ekans that

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.930 
to do a float test on these Ekans that
we<00:00:05.490> picked<00:00:05.730> up<00:00:05.910> while<00:00:06.060> ago<00:00:07.220> supposedly<00:00:08.220> the<00:00:08.910> a

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
we picked up while ago supposedly the a

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.490 
we picked up while ago supposedly the a
currents<00:00:09.240> that<00:00:09.389> will<00:00:09.570> germinate<00:00:09.780> or<00:00:10.200> that<00:00:10.410> are

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
currents that will germinate or that are

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.789 
currents that will germinate or that are
the<00:00:10.650> best<00:00:10.860> germinator<00:00:11.360> will<00:00:12.360> sink<00:00:12.599> and<00:00:12.870> the

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
the best germinator will sink and the

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:16.580 
the best germinator will sink and the
ones<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.450> float<00:00:15.450> have<00:00:15.839> air<00:00:16.170> in<00:00:16.289> them<00:00:16.410> or

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:16.590 
ones that float have air in them or

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:18.200 
ones that float have air in them or
they're<00:00:17.490> don't<00:00:17.699> have<00:00:17.820> enough<00:00:18.000> moisture

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
they're don't have enough moisture

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.179 
they're don't have enough moisture
they're<00:00:18.810> not<00:00:18.930> as<00:00:19.050> solid<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.470> nut<00:00:19.740> therefore

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
they're not as solid a nut therefore

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.010 
they're not as solid a nut therefore
they<00:00:20.310> float<00:00:20.580> and<00:00:20.789> they're<00:00:21.449> not<00:00:21.600> likely<00:00:21.810> to

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
they float and they're not likely to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.599 
they float and they're not likely to
come<00:00:22.170> up<00:00:22.199> so<00:00:22.769> we're<00:00:22.920> just<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.220> take<00:00:23.400> the

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
come up so we're just going to take the

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.140 
come up so we're just going to take the
the<00:00:24.500> live<00:00:25.500> okay<00:00:25.859> currents<00:00:26.180> the<00:00:27.180> burr<00:00:27.359> Oaks<00:00:29.150> and

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
the live okay currents the burr Oaks and

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.150 
the live okay currents the burr Oaks and
the<00:00:30.210> Spanish<00:00:30.750> okay<00:00:31.080> currents<00:00:31.320> we're<00:00:31.920> just<00:00:32.040> all

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
the Spanish okay currents we're just all

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.350 
the Spanish okay currents we're just all
going<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.399> jump<00:00:32.550> dump<00:00:32.820> them<00:00:32.940> in<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.120> and<00:00:33.180> see

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
going to jump dump them in here and see

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.180 
going to jump dump them in here and see
which<00:00:33.510> ones<00:00:33.690> float<00:00:33.989> we'll<00:00:34.590> pour<00:00:34.829> off<00:00:34.950> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
which ones float we'll pour off the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.970 
which ones float we'll pour off the
floating<00:00:35.550> ones<00:00:35.700> and<00:00:35.910> leave<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:37.500> sinking<00:00:37.829> ones

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
floating ones and leave the sinking ones

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.619 
floating ones and leave the sinking ones
in<00:00:38.100> the<00:00:38.160> bottom<00:00:40.399> as<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.489> can<00:00:41.760> see<00:00:41.969> just<00:00:42.540> a

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
in the bottom as you can see just a

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.490 
in the bottom as you can see just a
multitude<00:00:42.930> of<00:00:43.140> them<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.440> floated<00:00:45.170> and<00:00:46.170> so

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
multitude of them have floated and so

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.060 
multitude of them have floated and so
what<00:00:46.680> we'll<00:00:46.860> do<00:00:47.070> is<00:00:47.610> I'll<00:00:48.539> slowly<00:00:48.930> pour<00:00:49.920> off

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
what we'll do is I'll slowly pour off

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:54.130 
what we'll do is I'll slowly pour off
the<00:00:50.100> floaters<00:00:50.899> whoop<00:00:51.930> well<00:00:52.500> said<00:00:53.430> it<00:00:53.520> would

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:54.140 
the floaters whoop well said it would

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.680 
the floaters whoop well said it would
those<00:00:55.140> are<00:00:55.289> floaters<00:00:55.559> anyway<00:00:55.910> the<00:00:56.910> sinkers

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
those are floaters anyway the sinkers

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.380 
those are floaters anyway the sinkers
are<00:00:57.809> on<00:00:57.899> the<00:00:57.960> bottom<00:00:58.670> I'll<00:00:59.670> pour<00:00:59.940> out<00:01:00.059> the<00:01:00.210> ones

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
are on the bottom I'll pour out the ones

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:04.880 
are on the bottom I'll pour out the ones
that<00:01:00.510> float<00:01:02.449> majority<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.600> them<00:01:03.719> and<00:01:04.140> I'll

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
that float majority of them and I'll

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.240 
that float majority of them and I'll
take<00:01:05.129> off<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.549> rest<00:01:05.700> of<00:01:05.939> them<00:01:06.890> by<00:01:07.890> hand<00:01:08.189> and

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:10.250 
take off the rest of them by hand and

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.950 
take off the rest of them by hand and
we'll<00:01:11.250> be<00:01:11.400> able<00:01:11.490> to<00:01:11.640> see<00:01:11.939> the<00:01:12.540> ones<00:01:12.689> that<00:01:12.869> are

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
we'll be able to see the ones that are

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.560 
we'll be able to see the ones that are
laying<00:01:13.080> on<00:01:13.229> the<00:01:13.380> bottom<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:14.330> there's<00:01:15.330> not

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
laying on the bottom and there's not

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.039 
laying on the bottom and there's not
very<00:01:15.600> many<00:01:16.520> there's<00:01:17.520> a<00:01:17.700> appears<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> be<00:01:18.840> like

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
very many there's a appears to be like

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:27.800 
very many there's a appears to be like
four<00:01:19.439> of<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:21.799> burr<00:01:22.799> Oaks<00:01:24.409> and

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:37.010 

Oh<00:01:28.850> a<00:01:29.960> dozen<00:01:30.960> a<00:01:33.950> dozen<00:01:34.950> of<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.369> live<00:01:35.549> oaks<00:01:36.020> none

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
Oh a dozen a dozen of the live oaks none

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:43.940 
Oh a dozen a dozen of the live oaks none
of<00:01:37.200> the<00:01:37.290> Spanish<00:01:37.650> Oaks<00:01:38.330> have<00:01:39.330> floated<00:01:42.950> well

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
of the Spanish Oaks have floated well

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810 
of the Spanish Oaks have floated well
we'll<00:01:44.130> put<00:01:44.250> these<00:01:44.340> back<00:01:44.550> in<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> I'm<00:01:47.580> going<00:01:47.759> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
we'll put these back in and I'm going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
we'll put these back in and I'm going to
pick<00:01:48.000> up<00:01:48.800> these<00:01:49.800> because<00:01:50.100> we're<00:01:50.250> going<00:01:50.430> to

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
pick up these because we're going to

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:56.660 
pick up these because we're going to
plant<00:01:53.960> especially<00:01:54.960> the<00:01:55.020> Spanish<00:01:55.380> Oaks<00:01:55.619> I<00:01:55.860> know

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
plant especially the Spanish Oaks I know

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.889 
plant especially the Spanish Oaks I know
that<00:01:56.940> some<00:01:57.119> of<00:01:57.210> those<00:01:57.270> will<00:01:57.479> come<00:01:57.659> up<00:01:59.090> and<00:02:00.090> I

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
that some of those will come up and I

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:04.219 
that some of those will come up and I
know<00:02:00.960> that<00:02:01.110> some<00:02:01.470> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:02.160> of<00:02:02.250> these<00:02:02.570> lava<00:02:03.570> burr

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
know that some a lot of these lava burr

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:05.600 
know that some a lot of these lava burr
Oaks<00:02:04.410> will<00:02:04.590> probably<00:02:04.950> come<00:02:05.130> up<00:02:05.160> so<00:02:05.490> we're

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
Oaks will probably come up so we're

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.070 
Oaks will probably come up so we're
going<00:02:05.729> to<00:02:05.850> see<00:02:06.030> we're<00:02:06.690> going<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.899> take<00:02:06.990> them

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
going to see we're going to take them

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.290 
going to see we're going to take them
back<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.619> we're<00:02:08.070> going<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.220> pop<00:02:08.429> them<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:08.759> see

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
back and we're going to pop them and see

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.289 
back and we're going to pop them and see
how<00:02:09.390> many<00:02:09.570> I'm<00:02:09.750> actually<00:02:09.899> come<00:02:10.170> up
