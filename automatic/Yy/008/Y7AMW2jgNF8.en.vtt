design<00:05:26.390> works<00:05:26.630> of<00:05:26.780> course<00:05:26.930> has<00:05:27.169> known<00:05:27.320> the

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:27.350 
design works of course has known the

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:29.290 
design works of course has known the
world<00:05:27.590> over<00:05:27.860> for<00:05:28.070> all<00:05:28.430> the<00:05:28.610> different<00:05:28.910> designs

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:29.300 
world over for all the different designs

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:31.420 
world over for all the different designs
it<00:05:29.419> does<00:05:29.600> not<00:05:29.870> just<00:05:30.110> for<00:05:30.229> BMW<00:05:30.860> all<00:05:30.979> kinds<00:05:31.370> of

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:31.430 
it does not just for BMW all kinds of

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:34.270 
it does not just for BMW all kinds of
things<00:05:31.700> but<00:05:32.210> how<00:05:32.390> did<00:05:32.450> this<00:05:32.720> bobsled<00:05:33.650> project

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
things but how did this bobsled project

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:39.520 
things but how did this bobsled project
come<00:05:34.460> together<00:05:34.990> yeah<00:05:35.990> i<00:05:36.020> think<00:05:36.380> the<00:05:37.479> BMW<00:05:38.530> spoke

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
come together yeah i think the BMW spoke

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:43.690 
come together yeah i think the BMW spoke
with<00:05:39.710> the<00:05:40.419> ioc<00:05:41.419> and<00:05:42.020> the<00:05:42.289> u.s.<00:05:42.830> BSF<00:05:43.340> which<00:05:43.520> is

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:43.700 
with the ioc and the u.s. BSF which is

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.570 
with the ioc and the u.s. BSF which is
the<00:05:43.910> bobsled<00:05:44.750> federation<00:05:45.289> and<00:05:46.220> really

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
the bobsled federation and really

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:49.210 
the bobsled federation and really
determined<00:05:47.060> that<00:05:47.180> a<00:05:47.680> critical<00:05:48.680> need<00:05:48.710> really

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:49.220 
determined that a critical need really

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.050 
determined that a critical need really
was<00:05:49.400> in<00:05:49.610> the<00:05:49.729> two-man<00:05:50.110> bobsled<00:05:51.110> and<00:05:51.919> so<00:05:52.490> that's

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:53.060 
was in the two-man bobsled and so that's

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.719 
was in the two-man bobsled and so that's
really<00:05:53.650> what<00:05:54.650> we<00:05:54.770> focused<00:05:55.130> on<00:05:55.250> with<00:05:55.580> this

00:05:55.719 --> 00:05:55.729 
really what we focused on with this

00:05:55.729 --> 00:06:00.040 
really what we focused on with this
project<00:05:55.940> and<00:05:56.950> the<00:05:57.950> i<00:05:58.669> think<00:05:59.120> the<00:05:59.720> really<00:05:59.870> great

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
project and the i think the really great

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.320 
project and the i think the really great
thing<00:06:00.380> about<00:06:00.770> that<00:06:01.100> is<00:06:01.160> that<00:06:01.370> that<00:06:01.760> also

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:02.330 
thing about that is that that also

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.659 
thing about that is that that also
allows<00:06:02.479> us<00:06:02.870> to<00:06:03.110> contribute<00:06:03.620> to<00:06:03.800> not<00:06:04.250> only<00:06:04.400> to

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:04.669 
allows us to contribute to not only to

00:06:04.669 --> 00:06:05.980 
allows us to contribute to not only to
the<00:06:04.700> men's<00:06:04.940> team<00:06:05.150> but<00:06:05.360> also<00:06:05.479> the<00:06:05.690> women's<00:06:05.930> team

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:05.990 
the men's team but also the women's team

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:09.909 
the men's team but also the women's team
because<00:06:06.380> they<00:06:06.530> each<00:06:07.630> run<00:06:08.630> two<00:06:09.050> men<00:06:09.200> slides<00:06:09.680> and

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:09.919 
because they each run two men slides and

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.730 
because they each run two men slides and
so<00:06:10.610> we're<00:06:11.060> actually<00:06:11.210> facilitating<00:06:11.990> them<00:06:12.139> the

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:12.740 
so we're actually facilitating them the

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.650 
so we're actually facilitating them the
most<00:06:12.979> amount<00:06:13.220> of<00:06:13.340> athletes<00:06:13.760> that<00:06:13.910> we<00:06:14.030> can<00:06:14.240> so

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:14.660 
most amount of athletes that we can so

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.900 
most amount of athletes that we can so
that's<00:06:14.960> it's<00:06:15.770> pretty<00:06:16.010> cool<00:06:16.160> of<00:06:16.520> course<00:06:16.760> it's

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:16.910 
that's it's pretty cool of course it's

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.020 
that's it's pretty cool of course it's
