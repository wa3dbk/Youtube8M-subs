tool I've don't overlap the spanner
fitting<00:01:22.280> because<00:01:23.280> you're<00:01:23.520> gonna<00:01:23.610> be<00:01:23.729> clamping

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:24.060 
fitting because you're gonna be clamping

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.999 
fitting because you're gonna be clamping
this<00:01:24.240> into<00:01:24.600> a<00:01:24.630> vise<00:01:26.900> until<00:01:27.900> this<00:01:28.020> washer<00:01:28.439> going

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
this into a vise until this washer going

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.850 
this into a vise until this washer going
to<00:01:29.100> thread<00:01:29.280> on<00:01:29.369> your<00:01:29.430> last<00:01:29.670> nut<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.869> you<00:01:31.680> want

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
to thread on your last nut and you want

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.670 
to thread on your last nut and you want
to<00:01:31.950> do<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> nut<00:01:32.610> nice<00:01:33.299> and<00:01:33.600> tight<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.110> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
to do up the nut nice and tight so the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.450 
to do up the nut nice and tight so the
freewheel<00:01:35.159> tool<00:01:36.060> will<00:01:36.750> not<00:01:36.930> slip<00:01:37.200> or<00:01:37.470> move

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460
