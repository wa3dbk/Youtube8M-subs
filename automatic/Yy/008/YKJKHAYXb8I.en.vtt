those<00:02:06.930> assassins<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.280> that's<00:02:08.489> why<00:02:08.580> we<00:02:08.640> just

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
those assassins so that's why we just

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.370 
those assassins so that's why we just
first<00:02:09.119> picked<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.539> and

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:10.380 
first picked it and

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.700 
first picked it and
he<00:02:10.800> plays<00:02:11.010> scale<00:02:11.340> too<00:02:11.550> so<00:02:12.150> yeah<00:02:12.600> he<00:02:12.810> does<00:02:13.020> some

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:13.710 
he plays scale too so yeah he does some

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.470 
he plays scale too so yeah he does some
other<00:02:13.860> things<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.790> didn't<00:02:15.060> ban<00:02:15.150> out<00:02:15.330> the

something<00:02:18.000> that<00:02:18.030> you<00:02:18.240> didn't<00:02:18.780> think<00:02:18.810> was<00:02:19.200> a

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
something that you didn't think was a

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.520 
something that you didn't think was a
threat<00:02:19.730> we<00:02:20.730> were<00:02:20.820> scared<00:02:21.180> about<00:02:21.750> Kenan<00:02:22.350> we

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
threat we were scared about Kenan we

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:24.410 
threat we were scared about Kenan we
fought<00:02:22.860> about<00:02:22.890> banning<00:02:23.340> kid<00:02:23.700> but<00:02:23.910> then<00:02:24.120> I<00:02:24.150> was

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:24.420 
fought about banning kid but then I was

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.530 
fought about banning kid but then I was
like<00:02:24.450> I<00:02:24.930> would<00:02:25.860> just<00:02:26.100> be<00:02:26.160> calm<00:02:26.460> against<00:02:27.060> it<00:02:27.210> but

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
like I would just be calm against it but

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.980 
like I would just be calm against it but
we<00:02:28.170> picked<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:28.680> trash<00:02:29.160> he'll<00:02:29.490> years<00:02:29.790> so<00:02:30.150> this

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.000 
is fine against the cannon to but this

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.170 
is fine against the cannon to but this
shell<00:02:33.360> in<00:02:33.570> the<00:02:33.720> jungle<00:02:34.170> like<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.850> hard<00:02:36.060> to

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
shell in the jungle like is we hard to

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.350 
shell in the jungle like is we hard to

in the recent patch obvious you've seen

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.580 
in the recent patch obvious you've seen
a<00:02:41.190> lot<00:02:41.220> more<00:02:41.580> to<00:02:42.120> V<00:02:42.300> 2<00:02:42.510> lanes<00:02:42.780> now<00:02:43.110> and<00:02:43.320> in<00:02:43.530> the

bottom line and if I just step back to
to<00:02:47.010> ganger<00:02:47.460> there<00:02:47.640> I<00:02:47.670> mean<00:02:47.880> he<00:02:48.180> had<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:49.410> worst

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:49.770 
to ganger there I mean he had the worst

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.890 
to ganger there I mean he had the worst

they gave a lot of first blood Zog in

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.970 
they gave a lot of first blood Zog in
that<00:02:54.030> bottom<00:02:54.300> line<00:02:54.480> how<00:02:54.900> confident<00:02:55.440> were<00:02:55.950> you

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:55.980 
that bottom line how confident were you

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.030 
that bottom line how confident were you
going<00:02:56.970> into<00:02:57.180> this<00:02:57.480> matchup<00:02:57.780> as<00:02:58.080> a<00:02:58.140> duo<00:02:58.530> when

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
going into this matchup as a duo when

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:02.960 
going into this matchup as a duo when
you<00:02:59.160> realize<00:02:59.700> it's<00:02:59.910> gonna<00:03:00.060> be<00:03:00.270> a<00:03:00.300> 2v2<00:03:00.660> I<00:03:01.970> think

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
you realize it's gonna be a 2v2 I think

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.500 
you realize it's gonna be a 2v2 I think
cannon<00:03:03.330> is<00:03:03.480> weak<00:03:04.260> champion<00:03:04.770> LD<00:03:05.130> he<00:03:05.970> threw<00:03:06.390> his

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
cannon is weak champion LD he threw his

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.660 
cannon is weak champion LD he threw his
trunk<00:03:06.780> at<00:03:06.900> six<00:03:07.200> but<00:03:07.500> before<00:03:07.920> he<00:03:07.950> doesn't<00:03:08.520> drink

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
trunk at six but before he doesn't drink

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.910 
trunk at six but before he doesn't drink
too<00:03:08.880> much<00:03:09.500> so<00:03:10.500> that<00:03:10.800> may<00:03:11.010> be<00:03:11.040> the<00:03:11.190> case<00:03:11.340> and<00:03:12.920> I

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
too much so that may be the case and I

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.890 
too much so that may be the case and I
think<00:03:14.040> we<00:03:14.370> just<00:03:14.490> play<00:03:14.730> every<00:03:15.330> game<00:03:15.360> the<00:03:15.660> same

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
think we just play every game the same

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.860 
think we just play every game the same
we<00:03:16.230> don't<00:03:16.740> underestimate<00:03:17.460> our<00:03:18.120> opponents<00:03:18.720> we

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:18.870 
we don't underestimate our opponents we

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:21.680 
we don't underestimate our opponents we
are<00:03:18.960> not<00:03:19.080> scared<00:03:19.440> on<00:03:19.950> the<00:03:20.160> line<00:03:20.390> so<00:03:21.390> we<00:03:21.510> just

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
are not scared on the line so we just

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:24.110 
are not scared on the line so we just
play<00:03:21.960> the<00:03:22.170> same<00:03:22.440> every<00:03:23.040> game<00:03:23.280> see<00:03:23.910> how<00:03:24.060> the

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
play the same every game see how the

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.360 
play the same every game see how the
line<00:03:24.390> is<00:03:24.420> working<00:03:25.080> if<00:03:25.590> they<00:03:25.860> do<00:03:25.920> some<00:03:26.220> good

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370
