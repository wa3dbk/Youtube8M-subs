hiccup

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.380 

and<00:01:24.820> I'm<00:01:25.720> use<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:27.000> instructions<00:01:28.000> with<00:01:28.270> the

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:28.390 
and I'm use the instructions with the

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:34.260 
and I'm use the instructions with the
code<00:01:28.660> of<00:01:28.690> course<00:01:32.310> number<00:01:33.310> one<00:01:33.340> put<00:01:33.880> the<00:01:34.090> wings

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:34.270 
code of course number one put the wings

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.130 
code of course number one put the wings
on<00:01:34.600> palm<00:01:35.320> back<00:01:35.620> then<00:01:35.680> make<00:01:36.370> him<00:01:36.400> and<00:01:36.880> I<00:01:37.660> think<00:01:37.990> I

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.289 
cool and I love the tail woods a little
thin<00:03:08.620> and<00:03:08.650> then<00:03:08.950> a<00:03:09.190> bond<00:03:09.430> one<00:03:09.730> which<00:03:09.910> is<00:03:09.940> fake

thin and then a bond one which is fake

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:13.860 
thin and then a bond one which is fake

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
so it doesn't look cool but it's

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.920 
so it doesn't look cool but it's
toothless<00:03:14.110> tail<00:03:14.590> so<00:03:14.920> it<00:03:14.950> doesn't<00:03:15.310> matter<00:03:15.930> and

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930
