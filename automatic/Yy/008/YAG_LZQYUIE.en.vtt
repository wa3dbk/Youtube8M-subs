00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 
problems and I noticed that the earlier

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.240 
problems and I noticed that the earlier
I<00:01:17.540> showed<00:01:17.780> up<00:01:18.020> at<00:01:18.170> the<00:01:18.290> event<00:01:18.590> the<00:01:18.920> better<00:01:19.100> I

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
I showed up at the event the better I

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:21.940 
I showed up at the event the better I
was<00:01:19.960> sometimes<00:01:20.960> I<00:01:21.110> went<00:01:21.320> there<00:01:21.440> my<00:01:21.620> speaker

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
was sometimes I went there my speaker

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.220 
was sometimes I went there my speaker
might<00:01:22.220> have<00:01:22.370> been<00:01:22.580> blowing<00:01:22.820> over<00:01:23.180> my<00:01:23.870> mixer

might have been blowing over my mixer

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.890 
might have been blowing over my mixer
might<00:01:24.440> have<00:01:24.620> went<00:01:25.580> completely<00:01:26.090> from<00:01:26.600> the<00:01:26.690> last

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
might have went completely from the last

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:31.510 
might have went completely from the last
event<00:01:27.400> so<00:01:28.400> arriving<00:01:29.120> on<00:01:29.240> time<00:01:30.070> gives<00:01:31.070> me<00:01:31.340> more

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
event so arriving on time gives me more

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:36.399
