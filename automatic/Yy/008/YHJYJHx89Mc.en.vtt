00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:09.110
 fucking not who is my first tutorial and 

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.150
 is how to see the screen of your Nokia 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:16.410
 5530 and 5800 and 5230 on the screen of your 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.410
 pc 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 here you can connect via bluetooth 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:23.369
 without substance they do not have bluetooth 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:26.670
 the problem can be done via 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:28.510
 usb let's take a small look at what 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.510
 What is it 

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.510
 how can we interact with the menu 

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:38.090
 I'm going to get in I want apps 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.560
 and then we can do all we want 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:53.890
 good let's start 

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:59.579
 but it's downloading the file or it's not 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:05.950
 for the pc and another for the good cell 

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:10.649
 we go to what is my web page we 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:14.590
 let's block here I have 35 thousand 

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:18.040
 852 back although games applications and 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:21.119
 texts are from applications I'm just 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.119
 adding content 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.780
 in this remote but 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:45.660
 we turn off the music 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:45.660
 and we go here in the download button 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.710
 and it is already downloading has not happened 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.710
 almost nothing 2000 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:59.149
 and good good you have not downloaded us 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:02.860
 there is a windar file we extract it with 

00:01:59.149 --> 00:02:02.860
 right click and extract here 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:08.670
 and we will have a folder 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.030
 we open it in to the file for 

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.640
 the cell phone and the application for 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:20.880
 computer we go to the application of the 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.990
 Double click 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.990

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.280
 and next and install 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:35.250
 It is a very fast procedure 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:40.510
 Y 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:43.659

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:48.140

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:57.570
 then we go 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:04.239
 options 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:07.230
 they are sent to Nokia 5530 and I was not me 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:07.230
 because I already have it 

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.660
 and now I'm doing as installed 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:15.660
 on the cell phone 

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:34.409
 well we go once we have the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:36.739
 cell and proceed to install the 

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:36.739

00:03:56.209 --> 00:04:00.609
 file here is the mound 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:07.690
 and we give double click we can accept 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.290

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.290
 to adapt 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.620
 and we put where the chrome recommend the 

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:16.620
 continuous memory card 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.240

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:52.880
 but we open it we give options and 

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.880
 connect it 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.320
 and it will be 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:06.970
 As you can see, they can manipulate it 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:08.500
 they can do whatever they want and well 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:14.010
