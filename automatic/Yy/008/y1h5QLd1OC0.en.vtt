00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:37.579
 will begin by matching the tone of the 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:39.379
 eyelid with this mac corrector and it's 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.269
 one long-lasting this helps that 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:42.559
 the shadows last more simple to be gouged over 

00:00:41.269 --> 00:00:44.360
 all on those special occasions 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.539
 we want them to last a long time I will apply 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:49.940
 this creamy but indelible eyeliner 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.829
 in golden tone of tone 09 of this 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:54.890
 called review and I'm going to apply it to 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:57.399
 all the eyelid except in the corner 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:00.440
 external of what is the eyelid mobile 

00:00:57.399 --> 00:01:02.659
 under the fold to the line of the 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.670
 tabs and then I'm going to apply the 

00:01:02.659 --> 00:01:07.429
 another is one can use as a base the two 

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.550
 the other one is black and I'm going to apply it 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:13.009
 nothing more to the outer corner of the eye 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:15.560
 where I want to put a more tonality 

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:19.310
 This will help the blurring of the 

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.050
 gradient of the look and with a lot 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.400
 I'm going to blur it with 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:26.310
 the fingers 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.560
 and on top of that our shadow goes there 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.780
 that is going to have enough brightness is a 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.670
 smoked look to give a touch 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.950
 interesting color I'm going to apply this 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.470
 shadow that is beautiful from fl x does not 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:40.340
 they ask nothing of the organdÃ­ cake of my 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:43.110
 beige palette and it's a metallic tone and 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.300
 purple pretty dark and I'm going to apply it 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.330
 to the whole fold applied little by little 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:51.180
 but quite intense enough does not 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.670
 has faded perfectly and now the 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.330
 Perfect touch for this look and it's the 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:02:00.180
 of the brightness is this precious pigment of 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.880
 adhara that is black with golden shine and 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.650
 of various colors is a preciousness of 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.840
 this shadow I love I'm going to put a 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.420
 little a towel under the eyelid 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.820
 because there is some pretty glitter 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:14.130
 Glitter and pounding on the eyeliner 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.070
 golden I will 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:19.440
 apply perfectly and covering very 

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:21.200
 very well the whole area even up 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.360
 where is the black color aligner 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:28.640
 I want to give dimension for that applies 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.640
 fic those two tones before him 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.020
 of the pigment 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:36.970
 and now with the color palette of my 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.280
 visu land of veracruz i am 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:42.920
 applying this black color to give the 

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:45.950
 depth to the crease 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.810
 I am applying perfectly only in the 

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.580
 fold after I'll blur a 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:52.370
 little bit more I'm giving like the way 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:53.840
 what I want and I'm looking aside 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.840
 because he is seeing me in the mirror and in 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.360
 the camera too but I'm giving a 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:01.310
 form a little bit elongated 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.810
 then I'm going to blur it again 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:06.050
 I think I do not want it to be that super 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:08.450
 black and supermarked but I want it to be 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:11.510
 see super super smoked and now I go back 

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:14.480
 again with these are purple shadow and 

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:18.080
 with a brush to blur clean and I'll 

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:20.600
 to apply the tone and I'm going to blur it 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.080
 more than you can but always applying 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.670
 the color so that it does not fade 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.260
 so I'm going to blur it but it's going 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.549
 losing I'm going to apply more because 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.209
 I want it to be pretty enough 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.209
 intense 

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:35.680
 now I'm going to light up the inner part 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:38.590
 of the eye with this precious pigment of 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:40.570
 adhara is also a metallic pigment 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:43.810
 but it does not have glitter it 's one thing 

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:46.750
 precious is pearly is a champagne gold 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:48.520
 it's not a very yellow forum but it 's 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:52.480
 perfect to illuminate the inner part 

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:55.090
 of the eye and after this I'm going to apply 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.830
 this is also a little yellow does not reach 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.960
 to be golden a little yellow with something 

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:01.180
 reflex with which I will blur the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:04.240
 high part of this default what I put that 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.360
 is let's say the main smoking of this 

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:09.760
 part of the fold and I will blur it 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:12.550
 with this brightness tone the brightness quoted for 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:14.920
 to give him something extra and to clean the 

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:17.110
 eyebrow bone I'm going to apply this 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:20.110
 object the number 9 of the isu I'm going to apply 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:22.240
 this yellow color is matt notice nothing 

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:25.639
 of shine in weapons is for the part of 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.620
 down the eyebrow bone as I said 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.419
 and now I define the eyebrows I'm applying 

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:34.639
 a gray color with a violet tint on 

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:36.800
 several videos this step and now I'm going to 

00:04:34.639 --> 00:04:39.289
 delineate with a gel eyeliner that is 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.969
 my favorite way and I'm going to make a 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.759
 pretty pronounced tail I'm going to 

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:46.460
 delineate completely in the line of the 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:49.430
 upper lashes and I will continue more or 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:51.620
 less the way I gave to what is the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:54.050
 discriminated from the shadow and so on like 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.669
 always following the natural line of the 

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.629
 bottom part of the line eye 

00:04:55.669 --> 00:04:59.090
 lower 

00:04:56.629 --> 00:05:02.300
 I have a video part where he explained 

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.819
 perfectly the ways of delineating and 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:07.849
 all very very step by step and very in 

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:10.400
 detail and this is how it is outlined but 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:12.080
 now I want to smoke it and also smoke 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.939
 a little bit more give it a little more 

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.520
 depth with a matte color that's going 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:19.279
 to give depth no matter what and without 

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.800
 miss out because it's a pretty shade 

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:23.360
 in the face of the fixed very well the 

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:25.849
 delineated also with that black shadow 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.940
 that you from the same palette of bias 

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:30.970
 visu 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:34.900
 and with this tone the same violet tone 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:37.510
 I'm going to define the bottom part I'm going to 

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:39.520
 apply is the same indelible eyeliner 

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:42.730
 Gold color on the bottom too 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.380
 I'm going to apply the pigment to give the 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.920
 I'll also put golden color 

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:49.650
 that part of the eye 

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:52.530
 and now I'm going to apply the corrector that 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.510
 is the neutralizing color is more base 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.430
 yellow for dark circles is 

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:59.640
 Maybelline and I'll blur it 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:02.040
 perfectly with a synthetic brush and 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:04.530
 that's to clean at the end any 

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:06.270
 pigment fall or anything I go 

00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.520
 to fix with this high dust 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.590
 definition of the weight that the tone has 

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:13.170
 yellow is nothing else I apply it in the 

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:14.730
 part of the dark circles this helps 

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.250
 illuminate very well and with the same 

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.990
 eyeliner I'm going to outline the part 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:21.090
 inside of the eyelashes this blush that 

00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:23.610
 comes in the palette is perfect is a 

00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:27.210
 very natural tone and fascinates me I love 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:30.510

 where they sell those products are super 

00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:43.020
 economic 

00:06:40.770 --> 00:06:44.610
