00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.330 

so<00:00:03.370> today<00:00:04.180> I<00:00:04.690> think<00:00:04.840> I'm<00:00:05.319> going<00:00:05.439> to<00:00:05.560> learn<00:00:05.740> a

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:06.340 
so today I think I'm going to learn a

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.629 
so today I think I'm going to learn a
little<00:00:06.850> bit<00:00:07.330> of<00:00:07.569> an<00:00:07.690> old-school<00:00:08.170> trick<00:00:08.639> it's

00:00:09.629 --> 00:00:09.639 
little bit of an old-school trick it's

00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.779 
little bit of an old-school trick it's
pretty<00:00:09.879> old-school

00:00:11.779 --> 00:00:11.789 
pretty old-school

00:00:11.789 --> 00:00:15.330 
pretty old-school
it's<00:00:12.789> a<00:00:12.879> pressure<00:00:13.180> flip<00:00:13.660> so<00:00:14.529> a<00:00:14.559> pressure<00:00:14.920> flip

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:15.340 
it's a pressure flip so a pressure flip

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:17.070 
it's a pressure flip so a pressure flip
is<00:00:15.549> where<00:00:15.760> you<00:00:15.940> pressure<00:00:16.270> with<00:00:16.690> your<00:00:16.869> back

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:17.080 
is where you pressure with your back

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:18.930 
is where you pressure with your back
foot<00:00:17.380> it's<00:00:17.680> all<00:00:17.770> in<00:00:17.920> your<00:00:18.010> back<00:00:18.220> foot<00:00:18.520> and<00:00:18.760> then

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:18.940 
foot it's all in your back foot and then

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:21.120 
foot it's all in your back foot and then
it<00:00:19.030> goes<00:00:19.150> like<00:00:19.360> this<00:00:19.390> and<00:00:19.930> it's<00:00:20.770> kind<00:00:20.980> of<00:00:21.040> like

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.130 
it goes like this and it's kind of like

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.390 
it goes like this and it's kind of like
spins<00:00:21.940> it<00:00:22.420> spins<00:00:22.480> like<00:00:23.290> an<00:00:23.530> inward<00:00:23.890> heel<00:00:24.160> flip

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:24.400 
spins it spins like an inward heel flip

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:27.900 
spins it spins like an inward heel flip
would<00:00:24.550> spin<00:00:24.880> and<00:00:25.330> yeah<00:00:26.200> basically<00:00:26.640> it's<00:00:27.640> just

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:27.910 
would spin and yeah basically it's just

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:30.420 
would spin and yeah basically it's just
that<00:00:28.410> and<00:00:29.410> you<00:00:29.500> might<00:00:29.650> think<00:00:29.950> that<00:00:30.010> I<00:00:30.130> have

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:30.430 
that and you might think that I have

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:33.290 
that and you might think that I have
that<00:00:30.640> really<00:00:31.000> easy<00:00:31.210> because<00:00:31.510> I<00:00:31.660> do<00:00:31.720> this<00:00:32.050> a<00:00:32.110> lot

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
that really easy because I do this a lot

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.150 
that really easy because I do this a lot
but<00:00:34.300> you<00:00:34.360> would<00:00:34.690> be<00:00:34.719> surprised<00:00:35.380> at<00:00:35.650> how<00:00:35.680> hard

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
but you would be surprised at how hard

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.020 
but you would be surprised at how hard
it<00:00:36.340> is<00:00:36.370> to<00:00:37.079> land<00:00:38.079> it<00:00:38.440> like<00:00:38.980> right<00:00:39.489> on<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.790> board

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
it is to land it like right on the board

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.110 
it is to land it like right on the board
make<00:00:40.300> the<00:00:40.450> board<00:00:40.660> do<00:00:40.840> that<00:00:41.079> and<00:00:41.649> then<00:00:42.610> land<00:00:42.880> it

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.120 
make the board do that and then land it

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.270 
make the board do that and then land it
and<00:00:43.300> not<00:00:43.690> have<00:00:43.930> the<00:00:44.079> board<00:00:44.290> fly<00:00:44.620> up<00:00:44.800> and<00:00:45.010> hit<00:00:45.250> me

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:45.280 
and not have the board fly up and hit me

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.700 
and not have the board fly up and hit me
in<00:00:45.520> the<00:00:45.550> nets<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.810> that's<00:00:46.930> kind<00:00:47.200> of<00:00:47.290> what<00:00:47.559> it

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710 
in the nets so that's kind of what it

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.979 
in the nets so that's kind of what it
wants<00:00:47.980> to<00:00:48.070> do<00:00:48.190> all<00:00:48.370> the<00:00:48.460> time<00:00:48.670> go<00:00:49.540> like<00:00:49.690> this<00:00:51.989> so

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:52.989 
wants to do all the time go like this so

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:56.250 
wants to do all the time go like this so
I<00:00:53.020> have<00:00:53.200> to<00:00:53.880> basically<00:00:54.880> avoid<00:00:55.540> that<00:00:55.780> at<00:00:56.110> all

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
I have to basically avoid that at all

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.180 
I have to basically avoid that at all
costs<00:00:57.239> so<00:00:58.320> what<00:00:59.320> I'm<00:00:59.410> going<00:00:59.530> to<00:00:59.620> try<00:00:59.800> and<00:00:59.920> do<00:01:00.010> is

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 
costs so what I'm going to try and do is

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.910 
costs so what I'm going to try and do is
break<00:01:00.969> this<00:01:01.149> down<00:01:01.329> into<00:01:01.570> some<00:01:01.840> steps

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.410 

basically<00:01:08.920> what<00:01:09.280> I<00:01:09.310> want<00:01:09.549> to<00:01:09.609> do<00:01:09.789> is<00:01:09.969> keep<00:01:10.209> the

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:10.420 
basically what I want to do is keep the

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.080 
basically what I want to do is keep the
board<00:01:10.770> close<00:01:11.770> to<00:01:11.950> the<00:01:12.100> ground<00:01:12.280> because

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:13.090 
board close to the ground because

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.669 
board close to the ground because
whenever<00:01:13.329> I'm<00:01:13.569> trying<00:01:13.840> to<00:01:13.990> land<00:01:14.229> on<00:01:14.439> it<00:01:14.560> it

00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
whenever I'm trying to land on it it

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.699 
whenever I'm trying to land on it it
pops<00:01:14.709> up<00:01:15.130> so<00:01:15.340> high<00:01:15.609> I<00:01:15.639> can't<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:17.049> my<00:01:17.200> feet<00:01:17.469> over

00:01:17.699 --> 00:01:17.709 
pops up so high I can't get my feet over

00:01:17.709 --> 00:01:21.149 
pops up so high I can't get my feet over
it<00:01:18.029> so<00:01:19.029> I<00:01:19.060> got<00:01:19.240> to<00:01:19.329> get<00:01:19.450> it<00:01:19.770> got<00:01:20.770> to<00:01:20.889> keep<00:01:21.039> it

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
it so I got to get it got to keep it

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:27.239 
it so I got to get it got to keep it
close<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.369> the<00:01:21.579> ground<00:01:26.039> feels<00:01:27.039> a<00:01:27.130> little

00:01:27.239 --> 00:01:27.249 
close to the ground feels a little

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:30.109 
close to the ground feels a little
better<00:01:27.520> now<00:01:28.060> I'm<00:01:28.149> going<00:01:28.270> to<00:01:28.329> practice<00:01:28.659> with<00:01:28.689> my

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:30.119 
better now I'm going to practice with my

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.599 
better now I'm going to practice with my
front<00:01:31.119> foot<00:01:31.270> on<00:01:31.569> there<00:01:31.810> to<00:01:31.959> start<00:01:32.229> with

00:01:32.599 --> 00:01:32.609 
front foot on there to start with

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:36.359 
front foot on there to start with
stepping<00:01:33.609> off<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:35.439> see<00:01:35.619> even<00:01:35.889> with<00:01:36.009> my<00:01:36.159> front

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:36.369 
stepping off you see even with my front

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:37.830 
stepping off you see even with my front
foot<00:01:36.490> on<00:01:36.700> there<00:01:36.880> it's<00:01:36.999> popping<00:01:37.450> up<00:01:37.569> way<00:01:37.779> too

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
foot on there it's popping up way too

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.510 
foot on there it's popping up way too
high<00:01:38.200> I'm<00:01:38.259> not<00:01:38.529> gonna<00:01:38.679> be<00:01:38.799> able<00:01:38.859> to<00:01:39.009> jump<00:01:39.279> above

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
high I'm not gonna be able to jump above

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.569 
high I'm not gonna be able to jump above
that<00:01:41.490> that<00:01:42.490> will<00:01:42.670> be<00:01:42.759> a<00:01:42.789> problem<00:01:44.490> that<00:01:45.490> was

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:45.579 
that that will be a problem that was

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:51.730 
that that will be a problem that was
better<00:01:48.090> that's<00:01:49.090> better

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:51.740 

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.109 

good<00:01:52.740> eye<00:01:52.979> feels<00:01:53.369> good<00:01:53.549> now<00:01:53.819> I'm<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.060> to

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.969 
good eye feels good now I'm going to
practice<00:01:54.270> stepping<00:01:54.990> off<00:01:55.109> my<00:01:55.289> back<00:01:55.530> foot<00:01:55.740> leave

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
practice stepping off my back foot leave

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:02.749 
practice stepping off my back foot leave
my<00:01:56.159> front<00:01:56.429> foot<00:01:56.490> on<00:02:01.130> that's<00:02:02.130> basically<00:02:02.520> how

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
my front foot on that's basically how

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:09.619 
my front foot on that's basically how
you<00:02:02.819> catch<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.979> trick<00:02:08.269> with<00:02:09.269> your<00:02:09.420> front

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
you catch this trick with your front

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:24.920 
you catch this trick with your front
foot<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:10.049> a<00:02:10.110> front<00:02:10.319> foot<00:02:10.530> catch<00:02:23.780> notice<00:02:24.780> how

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
foot it's a front foot catch notice how

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:36.710 
foot it's a front foot catch notice how
many<00:02:24.989> times<00:02:25.410> I'm<00:02:25.650> practicing<00:02:35.510> it<00:02:36.510> almost

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720 
many times I'm practicing it almost

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.839 
many times I'm practicing it almost
feels<00:02:36.989> like<00:02:37.079> I'm<00:02:37.260> doing<00:02:37.470> it<00:02:40.640> okay<00:02:41.640> now<00:02:41.760> I'm

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
feels like I'm doing it okay now I'm

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:47.750 
feels like I'm doing it okay now I'm
going<00:02:41.940> to<00:02:42.030> try<00:02:42.180> and<00:02:42.329> land<00:02:42.450> I<00:02:46.340> see<00:02:47.340> it's<00:02:47.549> such<00:02:47.730> a

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
going to try and land I see it's such a

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.550 
going to try and land I see it's such a
weird<00:02:48.120> trick<00:02:48.510> because<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.840> second<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:49.290> try<00:02:49.349> and

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:49.560 
weird trick because the second I try and

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:52.339 
weird trick because the second I try and
land<00:02:49.859> on<00:02:50.040> it<00:02:50.239> the<00:02:51.239> board<00:02:51.480> pops<00:02:51.750> up<00:02:51.959> too<00:02:52.140> high

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
land on it the board pops up too high

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:57.300 
land on it the board pops up too high
and<00:02:52.560> I'm<00:02:52.650> not<00:02:52.799> over<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:54.079> man

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:25.710 

I<00:03:00.030> was<00:03:01.030> it<00:03:01.209> I<00:03:01.240> can<00:03:01.480> do<00:03:01.600> that<00:03:24.420> something<00:03:25.420> I'm<00:03:25.540> not

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
I was it I can do that something I'm not

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.830 
I was it I can do that something I'm not
quite<00:03:26.020> getting<00:03:26.050> about<00:03:26.530> this<00:03:26.709> trick<00:03:27.660> and<00:03:28.660> as

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
quite getting about this trick and as

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.270 
quite getting about this trick and as
soon<00:03:29.020> as<00:03:29.140> I<00:03:29.260> figure<00:03:29.470> it<00:03:29.590> out<00:03:29.800> I'm<00:03:29.950> just<00:03:30.160> going

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
soon as I figure it out I'm just going

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.100 
soon as I figure it out I'm just going
to<00:03:30.310> do<00:03:30.519> it<00:03:32.880> like<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.970> need<00:03:34.030> to<00:03:34.180> be<00:03:34.360> able<00:03:34.420> to<00:03:34.600> pop

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
to do it like I need to be able to pop

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.560 
to do it like I need to be able to pop
it<00:03:35.350> scoop<00:03:36.010> it<00:03:36.190> but<00:03:36.550> send<00:03:36.820> it<00:03:36.940> in<00:03:37.060> front<00:03:37.330> of<00:03:37.420> me

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:37.570 
it scoop it but send it in front of me

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:39.750 
it scoop it but send it in front of me
so<00:03:37.750> I<00:03:38.440> need<00:03:38.650> to<00:03:38.739> be<00:03:38.860> more<00:03:39.070> in<00:03:39.160> the<00:03:39.220> back<00:03:39.459> seat

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:39.760 
so I need to be more in the back seat

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:52.259 
so I need to be more in the back seat
and<00:03:39.880> push<00:03:40.090> it<00:03:40.239> forward<00:03:40.269> or<00:03:46.080> like<00:03:47.080> that<00:03:51.269> also

00:03:52.259 --> 00:03:52.269 
and push it forward or like that also

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:55.290 
and push it forward or like that also
the<00:03:52.450> wind<00:03:52.750> is<00:03:53.280> the<00:03:54.280> second<00:03:54.670> the<00:03:54.730> wind<00:03:54.970> starts

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:55.300 
the wind is the second the wind starts

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:56.820 
the wind is the second the wind starts
going<00:03:55.540> like<00:03:55.690> this<00:03:55.870> you're<00:03:56.110> trying<00:03:56.380> to<00:03:56.440> do<00:03:56.560> flip

00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:56.830 
going like this you're trying to do flip

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:59.640 
going like this you're trying to do flip
tricks<00:03:57.510> forget<00:03:58.510> about<00:03:58.660> it<00:03:59.019> because<00:03:59.200> the<00:03:59.380> wind

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
tricks forget about it because the wind

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:02.150 
tricks forget about it because the wind
just<00:04:00.250> blows<00:04:00.519> you're<00:04:00.730> bored<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.180> gone

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:02.160 
just blows you're bored it's gone

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:08.479 
just blows you're bored it's gone
so<00:04:03.160> with<00:04:03.670> that<00:04:05.400> added<00:04:06.400> mother<00:04:06.670> nature

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
so with that added mother nature

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:13.020 
so with that added mother nature
probably<00:04:09.489> if<00:04:09.579> I<00:04:09.670> go<00:04:11.430> directly<00:04:12.430> with<00:04:12.640> the<00:04:12.850> wind

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
probably if I go directly with the wind

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:28.330 
probably if I go directly with the wind
that<00:04:13.209> will<00:04:13.299> help

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:37.820 

okay<00:04:29.340> I<00:04:29.550> got<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:36.260> I'm<00:04:37.260> just<00:04:37.410> going<00:04:37.500> to<00:04:37.590> invent
