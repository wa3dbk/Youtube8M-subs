headlights are very very very foggy and

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:32.659 
headlights are very very very foggy and
I<00:00:29.820> did<00:00:30.449> notice<00:00:30.689> that<00:00:30.840> over<00:00:31.380> time<00:00:31.669> my

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
I did notice that over time my

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.700 
I did notice that over time my
headlights<00:00:33.420> weren't<00:00:33.660> that<00:00:33.780> powerful<00:00:34.170> anymore

headlights weren't that powerful anymore
and<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.829> thought<00:00:35.070> maybe<00:00:35.280> my<00:00:35.550> actual<00:00:36.329> bulb<00:00:36.660> was

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
and I thought maybe my actual bulb was

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.080 
and I thought maybe my actual bulb was
getting<00:00:37.230> leaker<00:00:37.440> but<00:00:37.739> after<00:00:38.730> further

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:39.090 
getting leaker but after further

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:40.760 
getting leaker but after further

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110 
information if it's focused enough do

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:16.979

that and again here's the fight okay all
right<00:03:17.139> so<00:03:17.290> I'm<00:03:17.380> going<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.560> get<00:03:17.680> started<00:03:17.950> so<00:03:18.579> the

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:18.609 
right so I'm going to get started so the

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:20.190 
right so I'm going to get started so the
first<00:03:18.910> thing<00:03:19.329> you're<00:03:19.450> supposed<00:03:19.600> to<00:03:19.840> do<00:03:20.019> is

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:20.200 
first thing you're supposed to do is

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:22.770 
first thing you're supposed to do is
wash<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.280> headlight<00:03:21.670> lens<00:03:22.000> to<00:03:22.329> remove<00:03:22.569> any

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:56.500 
I went to step one which basically said

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.290 
I went to step one which basically said
to<00:03:56.530> use<00:03:56.860> the<00:03:57.160> lens<00:03:58.060> clarifying<00:03:58.720> compound<00:03:59.260> to

rub the headlight I don't know if you
could<00:04:03.069> see<00:04:03.450> that<00:04:04.450> the<00:04:04.660> headlight<00:04:05.020> has

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:05.380 
could see that the headlight has

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:07.860 
could see that the headlight has
improved<00:04:05.830> a<00:04:06.069> little<00:04:06.190> bit<00:04:06.340> but<00:04:06.790> still<00:04:06.970> it's

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:07.870 
improved a little bit but still it's

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:10.650 
improved a little bit but still it's
still<00:04:08.110> pretty<00:04:08.320> dirty<00:04:08.590> and<00:04:09.400> then<00:04:10.239> on<00:04:10.480> the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:10.660 
still pretty dirty and then on the

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.140 
still pretty dirty and then on the
directions<00:04:11.140> it<00:04:11.290> says<00:04:11.530> if<00:04:11.980> that<00:04:12.160> cleared<00:04:12.820> it<00:04:13.000> up

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
directions it says if that cleared it up

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.479 
directions it says if that cleared it up
then<00:04:13.420> pretty<00:04:14.110> much<00:04:14.200> proceed<00:04:14.769> to<00:04:14.890> step<00:04:15.130> seven

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
then pretty much proceed to step seven

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.130 
then pretty much proceed to step seven
and<00:04:15.640> you're<00:04:15.760> done<00:04:15.970> but<00:04:16.540> it<00:04:16.630> didn't<00:04:16.930> so<00:04:17.019> we're

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
and you're done but it didn't so we're

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.140 
and you're done but it didn't so we're
going<00:04:17.230> to<00:04:17.320> proceed<00:04:17.650> to<00:04:17.799> step<00:04:18.010> four<00:04:18.340> which<00:04:19.120> is

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
going to proceed to step four which is

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.580 
going to proceed to step four which is
to<00:04:19.480> use<00:04:19.660> the<00:04:19.900> sanding<00:04:20.410> pad<00:04:21.120> so<00:04:22.120> it<00:04:22.150> says<00:04:22.590> apply

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
to use the sanding pad so it says apply

forth motion using the spray here the
spray<00:04:45.880> lubricant<00:04:46.419> so<00:04:47.380> I'll<00:04:47.440> do<00:04:47.590> that

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:58.360 

see<00:05:50.870> what's<00:05:51.050> next<00:05:51.319> here<00:05:56.409> much<00:05:57.409> until<00:05:57.949> much<00:05:58.189> of

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
see what's next here much until much of

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:01.209 
see what's next here much until much of
the<00:05:58.430> oxidation<00:05:58.969> is<00:05:59.270> removed<00:05:59.860> spray<00:06:00.860> Lube<00:06:01.069> is

00:06:01.209 --> 00:06:01.219 
the oxidation is removed spray Lube is

00:06:01.219 --> 00:06:04.959 
the oxidation is removed spray Lube is
necessary<00:06:01.879> now<00:06:02.870> switched<00:06:03.349> to<00:06:03.499> the<00:06:04.430> tan<00:06:04.669> side

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:04.969 
necessary now switched to the tan side

00:06:04.969 --> 00:06:10.689 
necessary now switched to the tan side
number<00:06:05.389> two<00:06:05.629> it's<00:06:06.620> this<00:06:06.800> one<00:06:06.979> here<00:06:07.009> and<00:06:09.699> rub

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:10.699 
number two it's this one here and rub

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:13.469 
number two it's this one here and rub
back<00:06:10.939> and<00:06:11.150> forth<00:06:11.419> an<00:06:12.169> opposite<00:06:12.860> motion

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:13.479 
back and forth an opposite motion

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:18.279 
back and forth an opposite motion
directly<00:06:14.479> 90<00:06:14.870> degrees<00:06:16.060> of<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.479> green<00:06:17.719> pad<00:06:17.990> for

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:18.289 
directly 90 degrees of the green pad for

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:19.899 
directly 90 degrees of the green pad for
about<00:06:18.439> one<00:06:18.740> minute<00:06:18.979> keeping<00:06:19.400> the<00:06:19.520> pad<00:06:19.729> and

00:06:19.899 --> 00:06:19.909 
about one minute keeping the pad and

00:06:19.909 --> 00:06:21.850 
about one minute keeping the pad and
land<00:06:20.120> surface<00:06:20.539> wet<00:06:20.990> using<00:06:21.439> the<00:06:21.529> spray

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:21.860 
land surface wet using the spray

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:24.999 
land surface wet using the spray
lubricant<00:06:22.430> and<00:06:23.319> then<00:06:24.319> I'm<00:06:24.439> basically<00:06:24.560> going

00:06:24.999 --> 00:06:25.009 
lubricant and then I'm basically going

00:06:25.009 --> 00:06:28.839 
lubricant and then I'm basically going
to<00:06:25.069> switch<00:06:25.310> to<00:06:25.550> three<00:06:25.909> and<00:06:26.560> then<00:06:27.560> four<00:06:27.889> I<00:06:28.189> get

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:28.849 
to switch to three and then four I get

00:06:28.849 --> 00:06:47.330
