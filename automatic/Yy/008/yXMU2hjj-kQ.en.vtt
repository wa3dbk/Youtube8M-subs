00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.410
 creepers look and what falls with them and 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:48.739
 how do the guys actually explode 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:52.309
 well then let's start everything mod 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:54.440
 adds 7 new creepers 1 creeper 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.720
 It called fair spawn creeper Well 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.640
 We look like he explodes and that with him 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:04.660
 falls but first let's see what the snow 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.850
 drops of volume from it falls stick of efreet 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:08.300
 may fall from it 2 and which are three 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.990
 things 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:14.270
 our let's watch how it explodes 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.000
 seize it like a regular fire 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.520
 doesn't even explode just disappears and 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.759
 instead it appears the fire so 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:25.280
 the next creeper is called 

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:30.979
 spawn lightning creeper let's watch 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:37.420
 how it explodes and what falls from it 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.420
 for some reason nothing fell again 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:47.119
 did not understand the joke so again so guys 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.250
 sorry a little bit interrupted but 

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:52.099
 for some reason, with this creeper I have before 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.979
 dropped out that 1000 but from this creeper 

00:01:52.099 --> 00:01:57.380
 guys we get diamonds sometimes 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.990
 fly out 2 typo3 diamonds in principle 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.209
 this creeper can even be very useful 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:05.149
 add your build and don't bother 

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:07.130
 where to find diamond frames and and so on 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:11.840
 In general, I showed how 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:16.700
 what falls off him now let's see how 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:19.610
 it explodes to the pain of me adding 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:22.640
 why i'm creeper i died it was the third 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:25.330
 creeper as he explodes you looked 2 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:28.210
 fix give watch as 2 explodes 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:31.660
 and the creeper also basically lights up and 

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:34.360
 you are struck by lightning 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:37.660
 exploded look like exploded 3 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:43.710
 the creeper is very guys cool so 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:46.150
 exploded you could be flying out of here 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:50.590
 we will fly away and 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.830
 And on Lena here guys here 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:55.720
 for some reason it turns off in the record I can't 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:01.480
 understand why with 3 creeper us 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:03.190
 crashes pretty again and died in 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.800
 general met the creeper we fly headlights 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.170
 charger 

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:09.940
 you hear what's going on outside and not 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:12.459
 it is not another guys what a crap 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.340
 Today I am recording I do not understand 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:16.810
 with 3 creeper we have such headlights 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:19.930
 charge I do not know which of them can be done 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:22.150
 but maybe they will be useful to you so well 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:27.220
 what let's watch what we do 4 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.410
 creeper 4 creeper here explodes like this 

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:31.360
 but he can also 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.810
 move from side to side 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.430
 most you can't most likely him 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:42.459
 kill let's see what's up with it 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:46.239
 flies out with him again why is there neither 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:48.220
 fuck does not crash give watch 5 

00:03:46.239 --> 00:03:49.750
 blew up the trial that the tuba is waiting to be treated not 

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:57.280
 there will be places even a steel project 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:04:03.970
 creeps yes damn lol not just about 

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:07.600
 table why so okay fashion 0 and fashion 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:11.440
 one everything is fine let's see what with 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:15.610
 nothing will fly out of it 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:18.280
 creeper husband why it is in principle not 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:21.820
 Should I take off guys? Maybe I 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:24.310
 I don't know, but our new creeper is already 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:25.660
 added go walking around the mines so 

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:29.140
 let's see what we have to do barter 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:30.520
 and a creeper well, an orchestra creeper, he is not very 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.840
 Mind like I can say that here 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:36.410
 creeper is not very dangerous 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:38.930
 it just turns the earth into sand and 

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:44.660
 the most you can get resources 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:47.150
 In principle, this is not very difficult from 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:47.960
 he gets something out of him 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:58.280
 falls out 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:05:00.830
 I again forgot that in my opinion they are nothing 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.080
 it also falls wand this blaze 

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:05.090
 or what is it called in general left 

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.020
 last 2 creeper let's see them 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:14.200
 and in principle, I think this series is over 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:17.660
 given mod so what does this creeper 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:21.669
 the creeper also explodes like everyone else 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:21.669
 the rest are basically whining like him 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:29.060
 explodes and and leave behind 

00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:34.760
 resources in principle not bad but let's 

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:37.220
 watch and put one fashion now 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.680
 let's see what's wrong with him why he 

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:51.070
 I also explode game mod 1 set 

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:53.800
 why it falls out that the teeth with him 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:59.479
 he falls goldstone 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:06:01.400
 the paint is shorter the dust the dust falls off 

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:03.320
 and let's watch the last guys 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.450
 creepers are just getting tired and confused 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.460
 in everything and I am interrupted by recording not 

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.940
 you know what's happening with my 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.880
 by recording 

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:13.000
 the last creeper looks like this 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.000
 way 

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:21.500
 we will get a blaze of blow from it 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:24.050
 I don't know what that means but I saw it 

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.760
 somewhere with ifritov in my opinion it also falls 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:28.880
 and give as looked it will explode and in 

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:32.229
 Iâ€™m going to finish this guys 

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:32.229
 the series is finally 

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:42.150
 mow creeper exploded and i don't understand need 

00:06:36.240 --> 00:06:45.240
 how it exploded basically explodes 

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:47.730
 but it usually looks like the guys here are unusually 

00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:51.390
 would once again start from basically you 

00:06:47.730 --> 00:06:53.490
 showed all the creeper it is very cool 

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.050
 creepers if you want to eliminate everything 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:56.790
