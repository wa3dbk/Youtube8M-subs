00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:18.780 
clearly well here goes nothing

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:24.220 
clearly well here goes nothing
what<00:00:19.410> car<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.890> I<00:00:19.950> want<00:00:20.310> to<00:00:20.430> use

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:24.230 

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.130 

I'm<00:00:24.770> arguing<00:00:25.100> one<00:00:25.670> of<00:00:25.820> these<00:00:26.000> three<00:00:26.300> well

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:27.140 
I'm arguing one of these three well

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.220 
I'm arguing one of these three well
actually<00:00:27.260> what<00:00:27.470> do<00:00:27.529> I<00:00:27.590> got<00:00:27.710> over<00:00:27.740> here<00:00:28.070> yeah

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
actually what do I got over here yeah

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:34.930 
actually what do I got over here yeah
what<00:00:30.230> one<00:00:30.410> of<00:00:30.560> these<00:00:30.740> three<00:00:32.949> and<00:00:33.949> that<00:00:34.550> Nissan

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
what one of these three and that Nissan

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.350 
what one of these three and that Nissan
is<00:00:35.239> for<00:00:36.020> something<00:00:36.500> specific<00:00:36.890> so<00:00:37.579> I'm

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
is for something specific so I'm

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.840 
is for something specific so I'm
branching<00:00:38.900> a<00:00:38.960> little<00:00:39.230> bit<00:00:39.320> away<00:00:39.500> from<00:00:39.530> that<00:00:39.920> so

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
branching a little bit away from that so

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.810 
branching a little bit away from that so
it's<00:00:40.970> probably<00:00:41.059> between<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:42.080> Viper<00:00:42.260> and<00:00:42.820> the

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820 
it's probably between the Viper and the

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.479 
it's probably between the Viper and the
Lamborghini<00:00:44.390> which<00:00:44.750> I'm<00:00:44.930> thinking<00:00:45.489> the

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
Lamborghini which I'm thinking the

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:48.030 
Lamborghini which I'm thinking the
Lamborghini<00:00:47.030> because<00:00:47.239> the<00:00:47.330> Lamborghini<00:00:47.780> is

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
Lamborghini because the Lamborghini is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:52.540 
Lamborghini because the Lamborghini is
clearly<00:00:49.040> faster<00:00:50.860> just<00:00:51.860> the<00:00:52.040> fact<00:00:52.250> that<00:00:52.339> it's

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:52.550 
clearly faster just the fact that it's

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.790 
clearly faster just the fact that it's
all-wheel<00:00:52.820> drive<00:00:53.210> so<00:00:54.079> we'll<00:00:54.230> try<00:00:54.440> it<00:00:54.470> we'll

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:54.800 
all-wheel drive so we'll try it we'll

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.369 
all-wheel drive so we'll try it we'll
try<00:00:54.980> it<00:00:55.040> take<00:00:55.430> the<00:00:55.550> Lamborghini<00:00:56.120> oh<00:00:56.379> it's

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
try it take the Lamborghini oh it's

00:00:57.379 --> 00:00:59.139 
try it take the Lamborghini oh it's
mixed<00:00:57.680> surface<00:00:58.160> the<00:00:58.340> Viper<00:00:58.550> wouldn't<00:00:58.910> handle

00:00:59.139 --> 00:00:59.149 
mixed surface the Viper wouldn't handle

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:01.720 
mixed surface the Viper wouldn't handle
on<00:00:59.300> dirt<00:00:59.510> for<00:00:59.960> anyway<00:01:00.320> I<00:01:00.640> don't<00:01:01.640> know

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:01.730 
on dirt for anyway I don't know

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:04.450 
on dirt for anyway I don't know
well<00:01:02.030> it<00:01:02.300> might<00:01:02.539> but<00:01:02.840> not<00:01:03.739> gonna<00:01:03.890> not<00:01:04.369> gonna

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:04.460 
well it might but not gonna not gonna

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:10.899 
well it might but not gonna not gonna
try<00:01:04.759> it
