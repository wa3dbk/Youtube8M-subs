00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.160
 9.5 update has brought into play the second branch of the British CT-ACS, 

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:05.626
 separate combat missions, 

00:00:05.626 --> 00:00:07.983
 two new maps and much more. 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.146
 Details - in this review. 

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.066
 "Upgrade Overview 9.5" 

00:00:15.146 --> 00:00:18.060
 In the tree view of British art - updating. 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.720
 There were five new tanks: 

00:00:19.893 --> 00:00:20.826
 two lungs - 

00:00:20.826 --> 00:00:22.360
 M2 and «Stuart 1" 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:23.266
 three high - 

00:00:23.266 --> 00:00:24.983
 «Grant 1», «Sherman 3 ' 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.613
 and the legendary «Sherman Firefly» - 

00:00:27.826 --> 00:00:29.040
 fans of military history 

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.760
 We have long wanted to see this famous car in the game. 

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.920
 But the main thing - 

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:36.146
 Now the British have the second branch of PT-ACS: 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.466
 it starts on the 5th level, the CT-ACS «Archer», 

00:00:38.626 --> 00:00:42.266
 which has the property that it integrates with the car quite a different class - 

00:00:42.453 --> 00:00:43.680
 ACS «Crusader»: 

00:00:43.853 --> 00:00:46.640
 both reverse travel much faster than the front. 

00:00:46.853 --> 00:00:47.746
 It is unusual, 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.160
 but opens up new tactical possibilities. 

00:00:50.306 --> 00:00:52.200
 Next, in the 6th and 7th levels - 

00:00:52.373 --> 00:00:53.813
 more mobile machines, 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.983
 that with ACS «Archer» combines 17-pounder gun. 

00:00:57.106 --> 00:00:59.546
 With this gun will have to go through three levels, 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.026
 it will be easy: 

00:01:01.026 --> 00:01:01.983
 nice gun. 

00:01:02.226 --> 00:01:03.533
 It gives a small one-time damage, 

00:01:03.586 --> 00:01:06.706
 but has a very high rate of fire and good accuracy. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.453
 Interesting CT-ACS is located on the 8th level - 

00:01:09.626 --> 00:01:10.493
 «Charioteer» - 

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:13.200
 very mobile machine, in which the tower is rotated. 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.680
 It has a good gun, 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.680
 and ladunak includes explosive armor-piercing projectiles with removable head, 

00:01:17.973 --> 00:01:20.826
 which differ from the conventional high praboynastsyu bombs. 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.373
 At 9th level, should «Conway». 

00:01:23.573 --> 00:01:25.120
 Compared with CT-ACS «Charioteer» 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.983
 machine has a lower highest speed, 

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:29.133
 but mobility has remained at a very high level. 

00:01:29.426 --> 00:01:31.266
 This CT-ACS has just appeared in the game, 

00:01:31.266 --> 00:01:34.106
 but its full gun has earned a good reputation: 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.613
 This 120-millimeter gun - 

00:01:35.613 --> 00:01:37.746
 is the same as in the heavy tank «Tortoise». 

00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:40.960
 This gun makes it very comfortable to play - 

00:01:41.146 --> 00:01:42.840
 everything will depend on you. 

00:01:43.333 --> 00:01:44.493
 One disadvantage of the CT-ACS «Conway» - 

00:01:44.493 --> 00:01:45.573
 large size, 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.546
 that makes playing very carefully. 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.546
 This habit will be useful at the 10th level, 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.546
 because here waiting FV4005 - 

00:01:53.866 --> 00:01:55.706
 this machine is not just a large - 

00:01:55.826 --> 00:01:56.983
 it is huge, 

00:01:56.983 --> 00:01:58.680
 height can be compared with the tank «Maus». 

00:01:58.983 --> 00:02:00.880
 Gun corresponds to size: 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.253
 183 mm gun, 

00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:07.680
 already familiar from the CT-ACS «FV215b (183)." 

00:02:07.983 --> 00:02:10.320
 Features guns are a little different: 

00:02:10.453 --> 00:02:13.320
 4005-s has the best accuracy and sighting time. 

00:02:13.506 --> 00:02:15.346
 But the main purpose of the tank is the same - 

00:02:15.346 --> 00:02:18.360
 causing huge damage to a single shot. 

00:02:18.533 --> 00:02:22.253
 The main difference between the British CT-ACS 10 level - 

00:02:22.253 --> 00:02:24.013
 in mobility and braniravanastsi: 

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:26.400
 FV4005 is much faster, 

00:02:26.466 --> 00:02:28.983
 but the armor is poor. 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.880
 With the release of the new British CT-ACS, players can choose from: 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.586
 fight on well armored, 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:36.500
 but slower machines first branch, 

00:02:36.586 --> 00:02:38.720
 or use is not so protected, 

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.986
 but more mobile CT-ACS with the second branch. 

00:02:41.293 --> 00:02:43.983
 In addition to the "British" update display on the battlefields 

00:02:43.983 --> 00:02:45.586
 premiyumny new German tank. 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.733
 Read more about «Panther 8.8 L / 71 ' 

00:02:48.733 --> 00:02:51.373
 can be found in a special video. 

00:02:52.833 --> 00:02:55.200
 "Upgrade Overview 9.5" 

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.533
 The game added two new maps: 

00:02:57.653 --> 00:02:59.280
 The first - "Lost City" - 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.653
 designed specifically for team battles. 

00:03:01.983 --> 00:03:03.533
 On the second map - "Mitengard" - 

00:03:03.533 --> 00:03:06.640
 will go to the battle technique initial levels only. 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.146
 Gone card "Severagorsk" and "Ruinberg on fire" 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:12.173
 but there was "Winter Ruinberg". 

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:16.066
 "Upgrade Overview 9.5" 

00:03:16.346 --> 00:03:19.853
 After the update 9.5 will separate combat missions - 

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.680
 a chain of assignments, after which performance 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:23.986
 the player will receive the award - 

00:03:23.986 --> 00:03:26.200
 unique tank and female crew. 

00:03:26.626 --> 00:03:29.306
 Tasks are issued for each class separately techniques. 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.706
 More details we will talk about them in a special video, 

00:03:31.706 --> 00:03:34.466
 which will be released prior to the launch of "separate combat missions." 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.183
 Access to them will be opened after the New Year shares. 

00:03:38.633 --> 00:03:40.933
 "Upgrade Overview 9.5" 

00:03:41.106 --> 00:03:43.600
 Altered shells hit effects in the tank. 

00:03:43.826 --> 00:03:46.120
 Good news for lovers of light tanks: 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:47.586
 after update 9.5 

00:03:47.773 --> 00:03:49.893
 enter the high-level battle - profitable 

00:03:50.213 --> 00:03:51.933
 because now for zasvettsy of damage player will receive 

00:03:51.933 --> 00:03:55.093
 an additional 10% experience 

00:03:55.093 --> 00:03:57.546
 for each level of the difference between your tank 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:59.080
 and highlighted tsellyu - 

00:03:59.293 --> 00:04:01.026
 but not more than 30%. 

00:04:01.346 --> 00:04:03.493
 The capacity of mini-cards: 

00:04:03.493 --> 00:04:05.040
 now displayed viewing vector, 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.733
 tanks titles 

00:04:06.866 --> 00:04:09.280
 third exposure tank, 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:11.146
 and for ACS - sector of fire. 

00:04:11.733 --> 00:04:13.226
 On this we all. 

00:04:13.413 --> 00:04:14.813
 Success on the battlefield.
