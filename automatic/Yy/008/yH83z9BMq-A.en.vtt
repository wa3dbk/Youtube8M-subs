who asks our side missions going to be
repetitive<00:02:05.490> kill<00:02:06.090> guy<00:02:06.240> X<00:02:06.450> missions<00:02:06.810> what

00:02:07.039 --> 00:02:07.049 
repetitive kill guy X missions what

00:02:07.049 --> 00:02:10.160 
repetitive kill guy X missions what
variety<00:02:07.469> will<00:02:07.649> there<00:02:07.829> be<00:02:07.859> so<00:02:08.840> kill<00:02:09.840> guy<00:02:09.960> X

variety will there be so kill guy X
missions<00:02:10.560> are<00:02:10.770> not<00:02:11.160> exactly<00:02:11.490> what<00:02:11.670> the<00:02:11.760> side

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
missions are not exactly what the side

missions are at all to give you one

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.090 
missions are at all to give you one
example

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
example

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.890 
example
of<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.970> kind<00:02:15.210> of<00:02:15.300> mission<00:02:15.540> that<00:02:15.630> you<00:02:15.750> can

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
of the kind of mission that you can

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.460 
of the kind of mission that you can
expect<00:02:16.290> as<00:02:16.500> an<00:02:17.160> additional<00:02:17.610> mission<00:02:18.440> would<00:02:19.440> be

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
expect as an additional mission would be

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:22.760 
expect as an additional mission would be
a<00:02:20.100> murder<00:02:20.610> mystery<00:02:21.000> so<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:22.170> murder<00:02:22.350> mysteries

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:22.770 
a murder mystery so the murder mysteries

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.470 
a murder mystery so the murder mysteries
are<00:02:22.980> a<00:02:23.040> whole<00:02:23.310> series<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.700> missions<00:02:23.940> in<00:02:24.330> which

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
are a whole series of missions in which

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.950 
are a whole series of missions in which
you<00:02:24.960> will<00:02:25.140> work<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.950> uncover<00:02:26.460> the<00:02:27.330> who<00:02:27.540> what

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:27.960 
you will work to uncover the who what

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.130 
you will work to uncover the who what
when<00:02:28.320> why<00:02:28.740> where<00:02:29.490> and<00:02:29.700> how<00:02:30.180> somebody<00:02:31.050> is

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
when why where and how somebody is

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.160 
when why where and how somebody is
killed<00:02:32.090> because<00:02:33.090> there's<00:02:33.240> been<00:02:33.390> a<00:02:33.450> murder<00:02:33.630> so

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
killed because there's been a murder so

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:35.690 
killed because there's been a murder so
just<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.500> a<00:02:34.530> real<00:02:34.770> police<00:02:35.100> officer<00:02:35.250> and<00:02:35.580> this

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
just like a real police officer and this

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.080 
just like a real police officer and this
is<00:02:35.820> based<00:02:36.000> on<00:02:36.120> the<00:02:36.240> fact<00:02:36.450> that<00:02:36.540> during<00:02:37.290> the<00:02:38.090> the

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
is based on the fact that during the the

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.110 
is based on the fact that during the the
French<00:02:40.020> Revolution<00:02:40.700> there<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> French

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
French Revolution there was a French

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.610 
French Revolution there was a French
individual<00:02:42.600> who<00:02:42.720> actually<00:02:42.900> came<00:02:43.230> up<00:02:43.290> with<00:02:43.590> a

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
individual who actually came up with a

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.100 
individual who actually came up with a
methodology<00:02:44.310> for<00:02:44.340> solving<00:02:45.150> crimes<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.930> will

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.110 
methodology for solving crimes you will

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.050 
methodology for solving crimes you will
learn<00:02:46.230> this<00:02:46.440> methodology<00:02:46.890> and<00:02:47.190> employ<00:02:47.790> it<00:02:47.940> in

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:48.060 
learn this methodology and employ it in

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.390 
learn this methodology and employ it in
order<00:02:48.330> to<00:02:48.480> find<00:02:48.750> out<00:02:48.930> who<00:02:49.410> committed<00:02:49.590> a<00:02:50.070> murder

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400 
order to find out who committed a murder

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.000 
order to find out who committed a murder
and<00:02:51.050> that's<00:02:52.050> just<00:02:52.140> one<00:02:52.320> example<00:02:52.350> we<00:02:52.890> have<00:02:52.980> a

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
and that's just one example we have a

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.290 
and that's just one example we have a
bunch<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.340> other<00:02:53.490> different<00:02:53.640> side<00:02:53.970> missions

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:54.300 
bunch of other different side missions

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.480 
bunch of other different side missions
as<00:02:54.420> well<00:02:54.570> like<00:02:55.110> the<00:02:55.230> Nostradamus<00:02:55.860> enigmas<00:02:56.280> for

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:56.490 
as well like the Nostradamus enigmas for

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:59.030 
as well like the Nostradamus enigmas for
example<00:02:56.990> so<00:02:57.990> yeah<00:02:58.350> there's<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.680> bunch<00:02:58.890> of

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
example so yeah there's a bunch of

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.800 
example so yeah there's a bunch of
different<00:02:59.190> stuff<00:02:59.550> it's<00:02:59.730> not<00:02:59.880> just<00:03:00.060> kill<00:03:00.390> guy<00:03:00.570> x

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
different stuff it's not just kill guy x

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.600 
different stuff it's not just kill guy x
it's<00:03:01.050> not<00:03:01.200> that<00:03:01.320> kind<00:03:01.530> of<00:03:01.680> it's<00:03:02.160> not<00:03:02.310> that<00:03:02.460> kind

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
it's not that kind of it's not that kind

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.290 
it's not that kind of it's not that kind
of<00:03:02.670> tally<00:03:02.970> tallying<00:03:03.890> kills<00:03:04.890> game<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:05.760> that's

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
of tally tallying kills game and that's

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.210 
of tally tallying kills game and that's
all<00:03:06.450> we<00:03:06.570> have<00:03:06.750> time<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:06.990> today<00:03:07.410> assassins<00:03:08.130> I

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
all we have time for today assassins I

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
video qas and at some point we're going

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:15.560 
video qas and at some point we're going
to<00:03:13.230> have<00:03:13.350> to<00:03:13.530> get<00:03:13.970> esco<00:03:14.970> blades<00:03:15.240> in<00:03:15.360> front<00:03:15.510> of

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:15.570 
to have to get esco blades in front of

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:16.850 
to have to get esco blades in front of
that<00:03:15.630> camera<00:03:15.780> on<00:03:15.990> one<00:03:16.080> of<00:03:16.170> these<00:03:16.260> he's<00:03:16.620> behind

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:16.860 
that camera on one of these he's behind

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:20.080 
that camera on one of these he's behind
the<00:03:16.980> camera<00:03:17.310> so<00:03:17.490> it's<00:03:17.610> not<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.240> makes<00:03:18.420> sense

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
the camera so it's not it makes sense

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.360 
the camera so it's not it makes sense
makes<00:03:21.090> sense<00:03:21.300> because<00:03:21.390> he's

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:23.370 
makes sense because he's

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.400 
makes sense because he's
