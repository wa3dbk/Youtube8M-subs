00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
want to know why does it have to be in

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.189 
want to know why does it have to be in
such<00:03:46.829> a<00:03:46.859> hell<00:03:47.489> forsaken<00:03:48.000> place<00:03:48.269> so<00:03:48.659> remote<00:03:48.689> and

00:03:49.189 --> 00:03:49.199 
such a hell forsaken place so remote and

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.439 
such a hell forsaken place so remote and
such<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:49.829> cold<00:03:50.159> place<00:03:50.400> if<00:03:50.579> if<00:03:50.759> there<00:03:51.299> is<00:03:51.419> a

00:03:51.439 --> 00:03:51.449 
such a cold place if if there is a

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:54.110 
such a cold place if if there is a
catastrophe<00:03:52.439> how<00:03:53.009> can<00:03:53.250> human<00:03:53.579> beings<00:03:53.879> get

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:54.120 
catastrophe how can human beings get

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.920 
catastrophe how can human beings get
there<00:03:54.419> oh<00:03:55.939> well<00:03:56.939> that<00:03:57.090> like<00:03:57.269> that's<00:03:57.569> a<00:03:57.689> very

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
there oh well that like that's a very

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.809 
there oh well that like that's a very
good<00:03:58.049> point<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.709> the<00:03:58.829> idea<00:03:59.250> of<00:03:59.400> this<00:03:59.549> is<00:03:59.609> that

00:03:59.809 --> 00:03:59.819 
good point but the idea of this is that

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:02.599 
good point but the idea of this is that
these<00:04:00.060> seeds<00:04:00.419> need<00:04:00.930> to<00:04:00.989> be<00:04:01.169> frozen<00:04:01.769> inside<00:04:02.430> an

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:02.609 
these seeds need to be frozen inside an

00:04:02.609 --> 00:04:04.580 
these seeds need to be frozen inside an
extremely<00:04:03.329> secure<00:04:03.719> environment<00:04:04.379> I<00:04:04.439> mean

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
extremely secure environment I mean

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.770 
extremely secure environment I mean
Norwegian<00:04:05.159> government<00:04:05.340> decided<00:04:06.120> that<00:04:06.569> they

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
Norwegian government decided that they

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.429 
Norwegian government decided that they
this<00:04:07.290> would<00:04:07.469> be<00:04:07.620> a<00:04:07.650> good<00:04:08.069> a<00:04:08.129> place<00:04:08.579> as<00:04:08.819> any<00:04:09.439> you

00:04:10.429 --> 00:04:10.439 
this would be a good a place as any you

00:04:10.439 --> 00:04:12.110 
this would be a good a place as any you
make<00:04:10.799> a<00:04:10.829> very<00:04:11.069> good<00:04:11.219> point<00:04:11.400> if<00:04:11.789> there<00:04:11.939> is<00:04:12.090> a

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
make a very good point if there is a

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.580 
make a very good point if there is a
disaster<00:04:12.479> who's<00:04:12.870> going<00:04:13.079> to<00:04:13.139> be<00:04:13.199> able<00:04:13.289> to<00:04:13.439> get

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:13.590 
disaster who's going to be able to get

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:14.959 
disaster who's going to be able to get
up<00:04:13.739> here<00:04:13.979> but<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.310> guess<00:04:14.579> if<00:04:14.729> there's<00:04:14.909> a

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:14.969 
up here but I guess if there's a

00:04:14.969 --> 00:04:16.550 
up here but I guess if there's a
disaster<00:04:15.539> people<00:04:16.019> are<00:04:16.109> going<00:04:16.199> to<00:04:16.289> find<00:04:16.440> it

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
disaster people are going to find it

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.199 
disaster people are going to find it
difficult<00:04:16.739> to<00:04:17.070> get<00:04:17.250> anywhere<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:17.849> point<00:04:18.090> of

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
difficult to get anywhere the point of

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.610 
difficult to get anywhere the point of
this<00:04:18.359> place<00:04:18.659> is<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:18.989> you<00:04:19.049> can<00:04:19.169> keep<00:04:19.409> these

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620 
this place is that you can keep these

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.949 
this place is that you can keep these
seeds<00:04:19.949> frozen<00:04:20.789> at<00:04:20.880> the<00:04:20.969> temperature<00:04:21.509> but<00:04:21.870> they

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:21.959 
seeds frozen at the temperature but they

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:25.070 
seeds frozen at the temperature but they
need<00:04:22.229> to<00:04:22.260> be<00:04:22.440> frozen<00:04:22.889> which<00:04:23.789> is<00:04:23.969> minus<00:04:24.210> 20<00:04:24.900> in
