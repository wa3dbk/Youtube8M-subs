00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:33.840 
build on this channel time lapses also

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:39.229 
build on this channel time lapses also
as<00:02:34.019> well<00:02:34.489> sometimes<00:02:35.489> and<00:02:37.220> here<00:02:38.239> the

as well sometimes and here the

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.160 
as well sometimes and here the
occasional<00:02:39.840> tutorial<00:02:40.530> of<00:02:40.680> course<00:02:41.810> will<00:02:42.810> stay

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170

tutorial<00:02:46.260> series<00:02:46.530> which<00:02:47.459> are<00:02:48.120> will<00:02:49.700> giving

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:50.700 
tutorial series which are will giving

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.259 
tutorial series which are will giving
the<00:02:50.730> time<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:52.280> then<00:02:53.280> you<00:02:53.489> will<00:02:53.579> have<00:02:53.639> a<00:02:53.790> map

00:02:54.259 --> 00:02:54.269 
the time and then you will have a map

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.170 
the time and then you will have a map
download<00:02:54.750> of<00:02:54.959> it<00:02:55.079> of<00:02:55.230> us<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.919> well<00:02:56.159> so<00:02:56.459> that's

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
download of it of us as well so that's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.210 
download of it of us as well so that's
basically<00:02:57.450> the<00:02:57.750> idea<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.379> the<00:02:58.500> GOG<00:02:58.650> antic<00:02:58.980> map

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
basically the idea for the GOG antic map

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.080 
basically the idea for the GOG antic map
