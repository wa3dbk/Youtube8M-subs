00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:03.590
 My name is Sonia 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.010
 Sonic the Hedgehog 

00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:08.760
 maybe you remind me of video games like sonic and secret rings or 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.419
 series like sonic 

00:00:10.419 --> 00:00:14.480
 Today I am here to tell you about one of my beloved adventures that I had behind 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.839
 of videogames 

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.689
 you will see I was one day running what else but would say some 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.899
 shit that were called are worthy ter sony thicke by the way vic in 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:28.070
 English means cock and other mindless shit 

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:34.899
 so I went to the fool of sony master's ass to ask him why he was using 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:38.440
 my name to be made that mote shit and tell him where he had 

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:40.980
 escaped with all those townspeople 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.070
 then they are and master told me with the voice of the sea and with the bitter we are going to create 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.820
 the like sonic clan because we have no life of our own we're fucking 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.790
 brainless with the intelligence of a bacterium and the power of juanjo 

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.220
 will destroy the world 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:57.940
 and there he began to neglect in front of his friends as if a bitch 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:01.620
 drunk 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:05.430
 then I approached the fool of the sony ass and I hit him four 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.110
 poyatos in the mouth so that zas all over the mouth zas all over the mouth zas 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.580
 all over the mouth, all over the mouth 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.600
 in this his friends refused in their pants shit altogether to a hundred and he 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.870
 they ran which rabbit rabbits 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:23.730
 Then I picked up sony from the floor and I said look at him, he said as he 

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.520
 happen to you to create for fun between all that we are going to leave the ass as the 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.520
 Japan's flag 

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.850
 for what they are and master began to cry like a mask and while leaving 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:39.150
 shot in front of his friends he kept telling me I'll get revenge I'll take revenge 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.500
 Of course, there are people in the world who have to really fuck themselves instead 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.140
 to create something productive for the people of this country not 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.550
 better a program is downloaded from the internet so that you arias and believe yourself the fucking masters 

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.800
 of the universe 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.890
 already clear 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:55.880
 and in their asses a table football 

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.880
 those raising children do not have half a host 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:01.970
 anyway 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.520
 I already say goodbye to all the ceticos floors explain ska latinas com and irish and 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.259
 tell you that looting does not lead anywhere 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:11.099
 better to create than to destroy 

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:15.969
 and from here the coolest blue hedgehog in the whole world sonic the hedgehog we 

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:16.889
