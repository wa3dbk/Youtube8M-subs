00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
playing what's the other sharpshooter

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:39.350 
playing what's the other sharpshooter
which<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.400> wasn't<00:01:38.700> really<00:01:38.790> that<00:01:38.970> big<00:01:39.119> of<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.329> fan

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
which I wasn't really that big of a fan

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:40.700 
which I wasn't really that big of a fan
of<00:01:39.630> because<00:01:39.750> I<00:01:39.930> didn't<00:01:40.110> know<00:01:40.200> what<00:01:40.439> the<00:01:40.560> hell

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
of because I didn't know what the hell

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.319 
of because I didn't know what the hell
was<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:41.070> on<00:01:41.189> and<00:01:41.790> what<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> problem<00:01:42.270> with

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
was going on and what the problem with

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.240 
was going on and what the problem with
sharpshooter<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> think<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:43.409> like<00:01:43.680> if<00:01:43.979> you<00:01:44.100> get

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
sharpshooter I think is like if you get

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.249 
sharpshooter I think is like if you get
that<00:01:44.430> doubler<00:01:44.880> bonus<00:01:45.270> thing<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> you<00:01:46.020> go<00:01:46.140> on

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
that doubler bonus thing and you go on

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.050 
that doubler bonus thing and you go on
to<00:01:46.290> Terra<00:01:46.619> but<00:01:46.770> you<00:01:46.890> end<00:01:47.040> up<00:01:47.100> getting<00:01:47.670> pummeled

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
to Terra but you end up getting pummeled

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.210 
to Terra but you end up getting pummeled
the<00:01:48.270> rest<00:01:48.450> of<00:01:48.600> the<00:01:48.659> round<00:01:48.810> you<00:01:49.560> could<00:01:49.979> still

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
the rest of the round you could still

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.469 
the rest of the round you could still
win<00:01:50.460> which<00:01:50.670> I<00:01:50.790> think<00:01:51.000> it's<00:01:51.119> a<00:01:51.149> little<00:01:51.390> bit

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
win which I think it's a little bit

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.929 
win which I think it's a little bit
unfair<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:52.110> I<00:01:52.200> should<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:53.189> main<00:01:53.700> thing

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
unfair I think I should the main thing

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.940 
unfair I think I should the main thing
that<00:01:53.970> should<00:01:54.299> be<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.479> winner<00:01:54.659> there<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.170> who

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
that should be the winner there is who

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.110 
that should be the winner there is who
has<00:01:56.189> the<00:01:56.670> most
