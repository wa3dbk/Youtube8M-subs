this is a picture of a loss of an area

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.969 
this is a picture of a loss of an area
of<00:01:11.700> the<00:01:11.880> epithelium<00:01:12.659> here<00:01:13.049> it's<00:01:13.260> very<00:01:13.680> painful

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
of the epithelium here it's very painful

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.550 
of the epithelium here it's very painful
with<00:01:14.520> photophobia<00:01:15.090> lacrimation<00:01:15.840> but<00:01:16.350> it

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.160 

so<00:01:23.130> what<00:01:23.340> is<00:01:23.520> the<00:01:23.640> etiology<00:01:23.970> of<00:01:24.180> a<00:01:24.690> corneal

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
so what is the etiology of a corneal

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.290 
so what is the etiology of a corneal
ulcer<00:01:25.590> a<00:01:26.150> microbial<00:01:27.150> corneal<00:01:27.930> ulcer<00:01:29.300> all

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:30.300 
ulcer a microbial corneal ulcer all

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:33.620 
ulcer a microbial corneal ulcer all
organisms<00:01:31.290> need<00:01:31.500> a<00:01:31.850> predisposing<00:01:32.850> factor<00:01:33.420> to

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
organisms need a predisposing factor to

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.740 
organisms need a predisposing factor to
get<00:01:33.780> into<00:01:34.230> the<00:01:34.350> cornea<00:01:34.740> except<00:01:35.750> gonococcal

and of Tyria they can invade intact
epithelium<00:01:40.350> destroy<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.100> and<00:01:41.430> get<00:01:41.670> access

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:41.910 
epithelium destroy it and get access

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:46.070 
epithelium destroy it and get access
into<00:01:42.690> the<00:01:42.840> tissues<00:01:43.700> so<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.150> predisposing

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.460 
tissue will gradually be more and more
so<00:03:03.790> in<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.030> early<00:03:04.480> stages<00:03:04.780> there<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.319> a

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:05.470 
so in the early stages there is a

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.920 
so in the early stages there is a

to minimize the sensation of pain to

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:49.920 
to minimize the sensation of pain to
examine<00:03:48.340> the<00:03:48.459> patient<00:03:48.940> you<00:03:49.150> need<00:03:49.299> to<00:03:49.540> apply<00:03:49.810> a

examine the patient you need to apply a

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:52.470 
examine the patient you need to apply a
local<00:03:50.380> anesthesia<00:03:50.859> so<00:03:51.430> you<00:03:51.700> can<00:03:51.910> open<00:03:52.060> the<00:03:52.450> eye

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
local anesthesia so you can open the eye

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:55.800 
local anesthesia so you can open the eye
then<00:03:53.380> you<00:03:53.530> will<00:03:53.680> see<00:03:53.950> a<00:03:53.980> redness<00:03:54.280> around<00:03:55.209> the

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810 
then you will see a redness around the

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:59.059 
then you will see a redness around the
limbus<00:03:56.260> this<00:03:56.680> is<00:03:56.859> a<00:03:57.040> sillier<00:03:57.549> injection

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069

the<00:04:59.400> ciliary<00:04:59.820> injection<00:05:00.599> as<00:05:00.860> these<00:05:01.860> vessels

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370 
the ciliary injection as these vessels

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:05.629 
the ciliary injection as these vessels
are<00:05:02.580> not<00:05:03.000> on<00:05:03.240> the<00:05:03.419> surface<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.800> we<00:05:05.159> don't<00:05:05.400> see

00:05:05.629 --> 00:05:05.639 
are not on the surface so we don't see

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:08.480 
are not on the surface so we don't see
individual<00:05:06.330> vessels<00:05:06.780> and<00:05:07.070> because<00:05:08.070> there<00:05:08.370> is

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:08.490 
individual vessels and because there is

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:11.420 
individual vessels and because there is
some<00:05:08.729> tissue<00:05:09.260> covering<00:05:10.260> these<00:05:10.710> vessels<00:05:11.190> that

the color is light another sign is

00:05:16.169 --> 00:05:19.370 
the color is light another sign is
opacity<00:05:17.070> here<00:05:17.760> you<00:05:17.970> get<00:05:18.210> some<00:05:18.510> infiltration

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:19.380 
opacity here you get some infiltration

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:24.830 
opacity here you get some infiltration
and<00:05:19.860> edema<00:05:20.490> and<00:05:20.669> the<00:05:20.849> spots<00:05:23.479> then<00:05:24.479> there<00:05:24.750> is

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:24.840 
and edema and the spots then there is

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:27.500 
and edema and the spots then there is
loss<00:05:25.110> of<00:05:25.289> luster<00:05:25.889> loss<00:05:26.400> of<00:05:26.610> lessers<00:05:27.090> means

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
loss of luster loss of lessers means

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.620 
loss of luster loss of lessers means
that<00:05:28.229> is<00:05:28.380> licit<00:05:29.099> the<00:05:29.250> normal<00:05:29.699> where<00:05:30.150> you<00:05:30.419> get

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
that is licit the normal where you get

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.810 
that is licit the normal where you get

this<00:05:33.630> luster<00:05:34.289> is<00:05:34.500> due<00:05:34.889> to<00:05:35.070> reflection<00:05:35.310> of

this luster is due to reflection of

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.260 
to see it clearly we can use the blue
light<00:06:24.750> then<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.770> area<00:06:26.160> of<00:06:26.370> the<00:06:26.610> effect<00:06:26.940> will

fluorescent<00:06:46.380> stain<00:06:46.740> in<00:06:47.390> this<00:06:48.390> example<00:06:48.900> you

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:49.620 
fluorescent stain in this example you

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.560 
fluorescent stain in this example you
see<00:06:49.920> the<00:06:50.100> curvature<00:06:50.520> of<00:06:50.760> the<00:06:50.910> cornea<00:06:51.270> is

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
see the curvature of the cornea is

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.750 
see the curvature of the cornea is
flattened<00:06:52.350> here<00:06:52.650> because<00:06:53.070> there<00:06:53.280> is<00:06:53.400> loss<00:06:53.610> of

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:53.760 
flattened here because there is loss of

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.630 
flattened here because there is loss of
tissue<00:06:54.000> so<00:06:54.750> this<00:06:54.960> is<00:06:55.110> the<00:06:55.260> area<00:06:55.680> of<00:06:55.890> ulcer<00:06:56.400> if

tissue so this is the area of ulcer if

00:06:56.640 --> 00:06:58.640 
tissue so this is the area of ulcer if
you<00:06:56.700> put<00:06:57.060> stain<00:06:57.390> it<00:06:57.540> will<00:06:57.750> take<00:06:58.020> stain<00:06:58.410> and

00:06:58.640 --> 00:06:58.650 
you put stain it will take stain and

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:01.810 
you put stain it will take stain and
this<00:06:59.220> is<00:06:59.460> the<00:06:59.610> area<00:06:59.970> of<00:07:00.030> infiltration<00:07:01.020> the

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:01.820 
this is the area of infiltration the

00:07:01.820 --> 00:07:05.380 
this is the area of infiltration the
base<00:07:02.820> and<00:07:03.240> the<00:07:03.750> surrounding<00:07:04.590> of<00:07:04.710> the<00:07:04.950> else

is<00:07:09.419> heavily<00:07:10.140> infiltrated<00:07:10.790> this<00:07:11.790> is<00:07:12.000> the<00:07:12.120> area

00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:12.560 
is heavily infiltrated this is the area

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:15.890
