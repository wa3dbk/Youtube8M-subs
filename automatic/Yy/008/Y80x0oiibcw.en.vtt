00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:12.460
Hey, this probably the easiest bouquet you'll
ever grow.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.420
It's always exciting to me when the Dahlias
begin to bloom in my garden.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.560
This particular type of Dahlia is one that,
well, is considered a dwarf, because it's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.909
under 30 inches, or so, high.

00:00:23.909 --> 00:00:25.960
And I love it's dark, almost red, foliage.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.789
And just look at these bright red to magenta
flowers.

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.940
You can see, as the buds begin to open, they're
really dark red like this.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:40.000
And as they fade, they become lighter, until
they totally fade away like this.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.969
And this is when you want to come in and just
dead head them off, like that.

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:48.859
You see, by taking the spent blooms away,
the plant is programmed to produce more and

00:00:48.859 --> 00:00:49.920
more buds.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:53.899
This little guy will bloom throughout the
entire summer into the fall.

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:59.280
It'll really show out in the fall when temperatures
cool off, right up until the first hard freeze.

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.810
If you really start to get into Dahlias, you'll
find that, well, they come in all different

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:04.910
kinds of flower shapes and colors.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.470
I mean, they're really kaleidoscopic when
it comes to color.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.510
And what's fun about these dwarf varieties
is that they're excellent for growing in containers.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.820
Now, if you wanna grow Dahlias, whether it's
in a container or in the garden, they love

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.530
full, hot sun.

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.150
You wanna make sure they're planted in a well
drained soil, and that they get consistent

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
moisture.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.080
They can go through some periods of dryness,
because they have a tuber–they grow from

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:28.610
a big root.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.700
And actually, the root is edible.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.280
But they grow from this tuber, which can store
moisture, but it's really better if you wanna

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.890
keep lots of blooms going like this–you
just wanna make sure that the soil stays consistently

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.670
moist, and they have moisture available to
them all the time to continue to have this

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:44.880
kind of bloom set.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.410
Now, talk about bloom set, come on up here,
I wanna show you another variety.

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:54.430
Now, this variety of Dahlias, just coming
into flower, is one called Classic Poem.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:59.180
And I like it because it's, well, the color's
beautiful, and I love the simple, subtle flower

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.100
and these purplish stems.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.120
So, this is a midrange size with a small flower.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.220
But in this grouping, I have planted seven
tubers, and they have continually come back

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.110
over the last couple of years.

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.580
They're very satisfying to cut and put a single
bloom in a vase in the windowsill–they last

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.750
a long time.

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.740
The beauty of Dahlias is if you live in a
warmer part of the country, they'll come back

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.790
year after year.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.470
You see, if it gets really cold were you live,
you'll have to dig them up and bring them

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:29.670
in and replant them each spring.

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:34.840
But in my Zone 7 garden, I leave them in the
ground, I mulch them heavily in fall after

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.640
I cut them back, and they come back every
year.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.690
Give Dahlias a try, you'll love them.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.569
