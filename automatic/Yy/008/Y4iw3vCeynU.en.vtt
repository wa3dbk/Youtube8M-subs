think that that if we stop concentrating
about<00:02:05.490> doing<00:02:06.420> this<00:02:06.539> and<00:02:06.810> doing<00:02:06.840> that<00:02:07.020> in<00:02:07.229> the

the<00:02:09.060> swing<00:02:09.270> up<00:02:09.450> because<00:02:09.720> how<00:02:09.810> much<00:02:09.959> can<00:02:10.110> you

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
the swing up because how much can you

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.020 
the swing up because how much can you
concentrate<00:02:10.380> on<00:02:10.740> on<00:02:11.220> average<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.730> golf<00:02:11.910> swing

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
concentrate on on average the golf swing

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.809 
concentrate on on average the golf swing
is<00:02:12.209> billy<00:02:13.140> not<00:02:13.349> even<00:02:13.620> barely<00:02:14.040> over<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.400> second

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:14.819 
is billy not even barely over a second

00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:17.600 
is billy not even barely over a second
alright<00:02:15.180> and<00:02:15.330> so<00:02:16.040> most<00:02:17.040> people<00:02:17.220> say<00:02:17.490> you're

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610 
alright and so most people say you're

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.980 
alright and so most people say you're
lucky<00:02:17.880> if<00:02:17.970> you<00:02:18.000> can<00:02:18.060> have<00:02:18.300> one<00:02:18.480> swing<00:02:18.750> thought

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
lucky if you can have one swing thought

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:22.850 
lucky if you can have one swing thought
and<00:02:19.200> so<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.780> always<00:02:21.780> combat<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.379> by<00:02:22.590> saying

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
and so I always combat that by saying

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.220 
and so I always combat that by saying

swinging really hard because that way I

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.280 
swinging really hard because that way I

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
everything because I'm swing a little

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:06.070 
everything because I'm swing a little
slow<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.880> can<00:03:05.120> really<00:03:05.240> feel<00:03:05.450> the<00:03:05.510> muscles<00:03:05.990> and

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
slow I can really feel the muscles and

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.960 
slow I can really feel the muscles and
then<00:03:06.620> when<00:03:06.710> i<00:03:06.800> get<00:03:06.980> then<00:03:07.130> i<00:03:07.160> say<00:03:07.430> yes<00:03:07.730> that's

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
then when i get then i say yes that's

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.240 
then when i get then i say yes that's
the<00:03:08.240> move<00:03:08.420> did<00:03:08.840> i<00:03:08.900> just<00:03:08.930> get<00:03:09.230> up<00:03:09.380> and<00:03:09.530> get<00:03:10.100> into

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
the move did i just get up and get into

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.490 
the move did i just get up and get into
that<00:03:10.400> set<00:03:10.670> up<00:03:10.790> and<00:03:10.970> swing<00:03:11.390> the<00:03:11.570> field<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.380> I'm

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
that set up and swing the field so I'm

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.810 
that set up and swing the field so I'm
not<00:03:12.650> concentrating<00:03:13.280> on<00:03:13.370> any<00:03:13.490> one<00:03:13.640> particular

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:13.820 
not concentrating on any one particular

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.180 
not concentrating on any one particular
movement<00:03:14.420> I'm<00:03:14.870> thinking<00:03:15.500> about<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.860> overall

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
movement I'm thinking about the overall

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.310 
movement I'm thinking about the overall
movement<00:03:16.490> to<00:03:16.700> reef<00:03:16.910> to<00:03:17.390> replicate<00:03:17.900> that<00:03:17.930> feel

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
movement to reef to replicate that feel

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:21.460 
movement to reef to replicate that feel
I<00:03:18.350> just<00:03:18.740> had<00:03:18.950> so<00:03:19.400> I<00:03:19.430> think<00:03:20.120> that<00:03:20.510> that<00:03:20.690> if<00:03:21.230> you

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:21.470 
I just had so I think that that if you

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:22.780 
I just had so I think that that if you
can<00:03:21.650> get<00:03:21.800> yourself<00:03:21.920> out<00:03:22.280> of<00:03:22.310> thinking<00:03:22.640> about

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:22.790 
can get yourself out of thinking about

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:24.490 
can get yourself out of thinking about
concentrating<00:03:23.360> on<00:03:23.510> a<00:03:23.540> particular<00:03:23.870> thing<00:03:24.200> or<00:03:24.320> I

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:24.500 
concentrating on a particular thing or I

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.860 
concentrating on a particular thing or I
wanted<00:03:25.070> the<00:03:25.220> most<00:03:25.430> but<00:03:26.000> still<00:03:26.240> engaged

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
wanted the most but still engaged

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.900 
wanted the most but still engaged
yourself<00:03:27.860> in<00:03:28.010> trying<00:03:28.220> to<00:03:28.340> swing<00:03:28.580> the<00:03:28.700> feel<00:03:28.880> I

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:28.910 
yourself in trying to swing the feel I

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.700 
yourself in trying to swing the feel I
think<00:03:29.180> you'll<00:03:29.300> be<00:03:29.390> a<00:03:29.420> lot<00:03:29.570> better<00:03:29.720> off<00:03:29.960> so<00:03:30.680> that

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:30.710 
think you'll be a lot better off so that

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:32.530 
think you'll be a lot better off so that
brings<00:03:30.950> me<00:03:31.100> back<00:03:31.310> to<00:03:31.520> Barry's<00:03:31.880> problem<00:03:32.209> the

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:32.540 
brings me back to Barry's problem the

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:35.500 
brings me back to Barry's problem the
heads<00:03:32.720> coming<00:03:32.810> up<00:03:33.880> the<00:03:34.880> odds<00:03:35.060> are<00:03:35.270> the<00:03:35.360> head

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:35.510 
heads coming up the odds are the head

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.260 
heads coming up the odds are the head
coming<00:03:35.750> up<00:03:35.990> is<00:03:36.140> that<00:03:36.650> is<00:03:36.920> that<00:03:37.459> most<00:03:38.000> people

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
coming up is that is that most people

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:39.490 
coming up is that is that most people
think<00:03:38.420> picking<00:03:38.750> head<00:03:38.870> up<00:03:38.990> as<00:03:39.110> they<00:03:39.230> pick<00:03:39.410> the

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
think picking head up as they pick the

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.080 
think picking head up as they pick the
head<00:03:39.620> up<00:03:39.709> you<00:03:39.800> can't<00:03:40.010> do<00:03:40.190> that<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.490> a<00:03:40.520> swing<00:03:40.760> if

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
head up you can't do that in a swing if

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:42.460

all<00:03:41.270> your<00:03:41.450> energy<00:03:41.810> is<00:03:41.870> going<00:03:42.170> this<00:03:42.260> way<00:03:42.410> you

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:42.470 
all your energy is going this way you

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:43.630 
all your energy is going this way you
break<00:03:42.770> it<00:03:42.950> up<00:03:43.070> like<00:03:43.220> that<00:03:43.340> you<00:03:43.490> could<00:03:43.610> actually

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 
break it up like that you could actually

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.100 
break it up like that you could actually
hurt<00:03:43.970> your<00:03:44.150> neck<00:03:44.300> you<00:03:44.780> could<00:03:44.930> hurt<00:03:45.050> yourself

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
hurt your neck you could hurt yourself

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.900 
hurt your neck you could hurt yourself
your<00:03:45.709> head<00:03:45.860> or<00:03:45.950> whatever<00:03:46.190> your<00:03:46.580> neck<00:03:46.760> or

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
shoulders or whatever but only if the

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.310 
shoulders or whatever but only if the
head<00:03:49.790> comes<00:03:49.970> up<00:03:50.180> it<00:03:50.360> means<00:03:50.480> that<00:03:50.690> the<00:03:50.810> torso<00:03:51.260> is

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:51.320 
head comes up it means that the torso is

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.110 
head comes up it means that the torso is
coming<00:03:51.680> up<00:03:51.800> so<00:03:52.220> you<00:03:52.280> have<00:03:52.490> to<00:03:52.640> look<00:03:52.790> at<00:03:52.970> the

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
coming up so you have to look at the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.449 
coming up so you have to look at the
issues<00:03:53.720> that<00:03:53.750> that<00:03:54.110> can<00:03:54.230> cause<00:03:54.440> that<00:03:54.470> one<00:03:55.250> can

00:03:55.449 --> 00:03:55.459 
issues that that can cause that one can

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:57.430 
issues that that can cause that one can
you<00:03:55.730> know<00:03:55.820> I<00:03:56.060> think<00:03:56.720> we<00:03:56.840> just<00:03:56.870> go<00:03:57.110> out<00:03:57.230> and<00:03:57.260> say

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
you know I think we just go out and say

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:58.990 
you know I think we just go out and say
that<00:03:57.470> one<00:03:57.800> might<00:03:58.010> be<00:03:58.040> just<00:03:58.400> be<00:03:58.550> standing<00:03:58.730> too

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
that one might be just be standing too

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.280 
that one might be just be standing too
close<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.390> the<00:03:59.450> ball<00:03:59.600> and<00:03:59.780> you're<00:04:00.050> going<00:04:00.230> to

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.290 
close to the ball and you're going to

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.080 
close to the ball and you're going to
make<00:04:00.380> room<00:04:00.650> for<00:04:00.890> it<00:04:00.920> I<00:04:01.130> think<00:04:01.550> another<00:04:01.790> one

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
make room for it I think another one

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
make room for it I think another one
without<00:04:02.240> a<00:04:02.390> doubt<00:04:02.690> would<00:04:03.230> be<00:04:03.440> if<00:04:03.650> you're<00:04:04.190> a

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
without a doubt would be if you're a

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.010 
without a doubt would be if you're a
right<00:04:04.459> hander<00:04:04.490> a<00:04:05.030> min<00:04:05.450> to<00:04:05.540> the<00:04:05.630> right<00:04:05.780> too<00:04:05.990> much

right hander a min to the right too much

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:08.440 
right hander a min to the right too much
and<00:04:06.470> and<00:04:07.100> and<00:04:07.340> you<00:04:07.430> have<00:04:07.820> to<00:04:07.970> pull<00:04:08.150> your<00:04:08.270> body

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:14.720 
there's a high probability Barry you're

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.810 
there's a high probability Barry you're
aiming<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.500> the<00:05:15.620> right<00:05:15.830> if<00:05:16.340> you're<00:05:16.400> a<00:05:16.580> righty

and that change the direction is causing

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:22.390 
and that change the direction is causing
you<00:05:21.110> to<00:05:21.260> have<00:05:21.350> to<00:05:21.470> tighten<00:05:21.680> up<00:05:21.890> and<00:05:22.070> change<00:05:22.310> the

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:22.400 
you to have to tighten up and change the

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:23.410 
you to have to tighten up and change the
Rex<00:05:22.550> into<00:05:22.700> the<00:05:22.760> club<00:05:22.910> and<00:05:23.090> that's<00:05:23.240> where

00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:23.420 
Rex into the club and that's where

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:25.510 
Rex into the club and that's where
you're<00:05:23.870> feeling<00:05:24.200> the<00:05:24.320> the<00:05:24.740> head<00:05:25.040> come<00:05:25.250> up<00:05:25.280> but

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:25.520 
you're feeling the the head come up but

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:28.540 
you're feeling the the head come up but
it's<00:05:25.670> the<00:05:25.820> whole<00:05:26.000> body<00:05:26.270> is<00:05:26.480> coming<00:05:26.840> up<00:05:27.550> for

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:28.550 
it's the whole body is coming up for

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:30.160 
it's the whole body is coming up for
either<00:05:28.700> that<00:05:28.970> or<00:05:29.000> standing<00:05:29.540> too<00:05:29.660> close<00:05:29.690> or

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:30.170 
either that or standing too close or

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:32.260 
either that or standing too close or
maybe<00:05:30.980> the<00:05:31.130> ball<00:05:31.250> position<00:05:31.460> is<00:05:31.760> too<00:05:31.880> far<00:05:32.060> back

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.270 
maybe the ball position is too far back

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:34.270 
maybe the ball position is too far back
and<00:05:32.510> trying<00:05:32.660> to<00:05:32.750> come<00:05:32.900> up<00:05:32.930> but<00:05:33.410> either<00:05:33.500> way<00:05:33.770> we

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:34.280 
and trying to come up but either way we

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:36.130 
and trying to come up but either way we
got<00:05:34.460> to<00:05:34.550> figure<00:05:34.730> out<00:05:34.940> something's<00:05:35.630> causing<00:05:35.840> it

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
got to figure out something's causing it

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:38.230 
got to figure out something's causing it
to<00:05:36.170> happen<00:05:36.350> and<00:05:36.710> it's<00:05:37.280> it's<00:05:37.610> consuming<00:05:38.030> a<00:05:38.120> lot

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
to happen and it's it's consuming a lot

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.340 
to happen and it's it's consuming a lot
of<00:05:38.360> energy<00:05:38.540> and<00:05:38.780> that's<00:05:38.930> why<00:05:39.080> you're<00:05:39.200> getting

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:39.350 
of energy and that's why you're getting

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.680 
of energy and that's why you're getting
tired<00:05:39.650> so<00:05:40.310> but<00:05:40.580> I<00:05:40.610> would<00:05:40.790> always<00:05:40.940> say<00:05:41.210> no<00:05:41.480> now

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
tired so but I would always say no now

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.870 
tired so but I would always say no now
more<00:05:41.960> often<00:05:42.140> than<00:05:42.290> not<00:05:42.350> stop<00:05:43.340> by<00:05:43.490> checking<00:05:43.730> the

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:43.880 
more often than not stop by checking the

00:05:43.880 --> 00:05:47.950 
more often than not stop by checking the
alignment<00:05:44.530> parallel<00:05:45.530> left<00:05:46.060> alright<00:05:47.060> so<00:05:47.690> Barry

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:47.960 
alignment parallel left alright so Barry

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.680 
alignment parallel left alright so Barry
I<00:05:48.310> think<00:05:49.310> I<00:05:49.490> think<00:05:49.760> of<00:05:49.910> duty<00:05:50.270> couple<00:05:50.570> good
