00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:12.379
 I think that I want to show everyone this kind of feeling even if it is just a place Here 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:18.680
 It is outline, isn't it? 

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:20.640
 It will be the outer line The outer side of the stream of the river is that if you have flowed geology 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.630
 Along the flow 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:28.859
 The touch was right 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:30.390
 The city ​​is more outside than inside the curving area of ​​the flow . 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.930
 It is flowing a lot 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:37.680
 If you look at the map in such a place and do it while searching for such a place 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:41.650

 Easy-to-understand the it is According the way of this power you were this river 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:53.890
 If you look at it, there is a point that roughly this area is the most hit . 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.490
 You that where I went so selling Nde 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:59.720
 Winning putter 

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:04.130
 It is best to get fishing at 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:07.200
 If you use the range properly and say in the order you used it with the top and the support 

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:11.219
 If you draw the most Well above 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.920
 9 round 3 dream normal 

00:01:11.219 --> 00:01:17.290
 I did that 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.610
 Bad of two- under Hachimaru 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:24.730
 Below that 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:29.590
 Under the power of the 9th round slim under it is Hachimaru Lee 

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:34.570
 Lastly , I said that in the last days there are 6 qo dounder marks 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:39.130
 Well, I like how to make a timely fishing like that 

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:41.010
 Are you going to compete in that punishment season ? 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:46.500
 Choi or below that of 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:48.900
 Well Toka a little 30 centimeters Toka whether the about a of whether Toka 50 centimeters thing is that side 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:56.310
 Matched to it while discerning 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:59.550
 Gua select I will come, so of course if you throw it to the upstream of that and that 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.030
 If you throw it down or cross down again 

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:01.930
 Range is changing 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:09.070
 Yonen 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:16.060
 In such a time how to put together If you simply put the rod up and down 

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:17.980
 It is a retrieve speed, so I wonder if I want to go through the range that I also aim for 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.310
 There are a lot of things out 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:25.800
 Because we can use variously 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:28.750
 Because there are various house series of that wonder because of its weight length 

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:33.750
 Because this will be a great weapon already 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:33.750
 Yahoo think I want to use all means the case in recommended
