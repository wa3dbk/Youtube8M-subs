outside here to engage the haunches we

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.850 
outside here to engage the haunches we
lead<00:01:22.450> our<00:01:22.479> way<00:01:22.810> to<00:01:22.870> the<00:01:23.140> outside<00:01:23.170> we<00:01:23.680> get<00:01:23.830> a

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
lead our way to the outside we get a

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:25.380 
lead our way to the outside we get a
little<00:01:23.950> bit<00:01:24.190> of<00:01:24.220> haunches<00:01:24.640> out<00:01:24.820> rather<00:01:25.060> than<00:01:25.240> a

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390 
little bit of haunches out rather than a

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:27.870 
little bit of haunches out rather than a
true<00:01:25.660> then<00:01:25.840> so<00:01:26.470> on<00:01:26.710> the<00:01:26.860> ground<00:01:27.100> we'll<00:01:27.310> see<00:01:27.610> if

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:27.880 
true then so on the ground we'll see if

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.680 
true then so on the ground we'll see if
we<00:01:28.479> can<00:01:28.720> free<00:01:29.020> up<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:29.470> lower<00:01:29.680> back<00:01:30.540> now<00:01:31.540> this

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:31.690 
we can free up the lower back now this

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.380 
we can free up the lower back now this
exercise<00:01:32.259> is<00:01:32.590> very<00:01:32.770> good<00:01:33.220> to<00:01:34.000> keep<00:01:34.150> them

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:34.390 
exercise is very good to keep them

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.670 
exercise is very good to keep them
together<00:01:34.570> it's<00:01:34.930> quite<00:01:35.110> tight<00:01:35.350> to<00:01:35.560> the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 
together it's quite tight to the

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.410 
together it's quite tight to the
distance<00:01:36.100> so<00:01:36.700> they<00:01:36.820> really<00:01:36.970> have<00:01:37.150> to<00:01:37.270> come

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:37.420 
distance so they really have to come

00:01:37.420 --> 00:02:10.050 
distance so they really have to come
from<00:01:37.540> behind<00:01:46.290> good<00:01:47.290> here

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.250 

the<00:02:11.060> question<00:02:11.450> is<00:02:11.570> what<00:02:11.780> is<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.080> minimum

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
the question is what is the minimum

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.320 
the question is what is the minimum
level<00:02:12.680> of<00:02:12.740> horsemanship<00:02:13.190> that<00:02:13.970> one<00:02:14.120> has<00:02:14.300> to

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:14.330 
level of horsemanship that one has to

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.790 
level of horsemanship that one has to
have<00:02:14.630> before<00:02:14.870> you<00:02:15.080> have<00:02:15.230> all<00:02:15.380> of<00:02:15.410> the<00:02:15.650> other

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:15.800 
have before you have all of the other

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:18.850 
have before you have all of the other
qualities<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.490> a<00:02:16.670> judge<00:02:16.970> requires<00:02:17.600> well<00:02:18.590> you

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
qualities that a judge requires well you

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.070 
qualities that a judge requires well you
know<00:02:18.980> thinking<00:02:19.490> of<00:02:19.670> the<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.270> top<00:02:20.570> level<00:02:20.990> I

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:21.080 
know thinking of the the top level I

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.510 
know thinking of the the top level I
mean<00:02:21.110> they<00:02:21.440> don't<00:02:21.620> have<00:02:21.800> to<00:02:21.950> be<00:02:21.980> Olympic

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
mean they don't have to be Olympic

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:26.140 
mean they don't have to be Olympic
medalists<00:02:23.120> but<00:02:23.810> I<00:02:24.170> do<00:02:24.440> think<00:02:24.770> it's<00:02:25.150> important

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
medalists but I do think it's important

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.510 
medalists but I do think it's important
that<00:02:26.209> they<00:02:26.480> have<00:02:26.630> a<00:02:26.660> feel<00:02:27.320> for<00:02:27.740> the<00:02:27.920> for<00:02:28.490> the

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 
that they have a feel for the for the

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.430 
that they have a feel for the for the
training<00:02:29.030> and<00:02:29.150> a<00:02:29.570> little<00:02:29.930> bit<00:02:30.020> for<00:02:30.140> what<00:02:30.290> it's

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
training and a little bit for what it's

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.460 
training and a little bit for what it's
like<00:02:30.709> as<00:02:31.130> a<00:02:31.550> competitor<00:02:32.390> no<00:02:32.930> I<00:02:32.959> think<00:02:33.110> it<00:02:33.320> makes

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
like as a competitor no I think it makes

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:37.030 
like as a competitor no I think it makes
a<00:02:33.650> big<00:02:33.740> difference<00:02:34.120> sage<00:02:35.120> is<00:02:35.150> 20<00:02:35.900> and<00:02:36.170> she<00:02:36.770> will

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:37.040 
a big difference sage is 20 and she will

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:38.949 
a big difference sage is 20 and she will
have<00:02:37.160> stiffening<00:02:37.580> in<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.790> body<00:02:38.000> because<00:02:38.870> of

00:02:38.949 --> 00:02:38.959 
have stiffening in the body because of

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.590 
have stiffening in the body because of
her<00:02:39.080> age<00:02:39.260> this<00:02:40.100> is<00:02:40.280> just<00:02:40.400> a<00:02:40.550> fun<00:02:40.820> exercise<00:02:41.120> for

was<00:03:02.630> happy<00:03:02.930> with<00:03:03.050> that<00:03:03.260> if<00:03:04.130> she<00:03:04.310> she<00:03:04.370> kind<00:03:04.730> of

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
was happy with that if she she kind of

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.110 
was happy with that if she she kind of
did<00:03:06.440> a<00:03:06.470> little<00:03:06.680> bitty<00:03:06.890> sliding<00:03:07.370> stop<00:03:07.640> here<00:03:08.000> at

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
did a little bitty sliding stop here at

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.840 
did a little bitty sliding stop here at
the<00:03:08.239> fence<00:03:08.890> and<00:03:09.890> once<00:03:10.100> I've<00:03:10.250> got<00:03:10.459> a<00:03:10.489> running

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:10.850 
the fence and once I've got a running

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.310 
the fence and once I've got a running
straight<00:03:11.180> then<00:03:11.510> I'm<00:03:11.600> gonna<00:03:11.660> start<00:03:11.930> adding<00:03:12.140> a

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:12.320 
straight then I'm gonna start adding a

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:14.860 
straight then I'm gonna start adding a
little<00:03:12.440> speed<00:03:12.970> the<00:03:13.970> horse<00:03:14.180> has<00:03:14.360> got<00:03:14.420> to<00:03:14.750> have

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
little speed the horse has got to have

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.870 
little speed the horse has got to have
quite<00:03:15.140> a<00:03:15.200> bit<00:03:15.290> of<00:03:15.440> momentum<00:03:15.650> to<00:03:16.130> do<00:03:16.280> a<00:03:16.310> sliding

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
quite a bit of momentum to do a sliding

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.690 
quite a bit of momentum to do a sliding
stop<00:03:17.150> so<00:03:17.959> I'm<00:03:18.709> gonna<00:03:18.950> start<00:03:19.160> adding<00:03:19.400> some

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:19.700 
stop so I'm gonna start adding some

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.300 
stop so I'm gonna start adding some
speed<00:03:19.940> and<00:03:20.090> just<00:03:20.239> make<00:03:20.420> sure<00:03:20.450> that<00:03:21.010> she<00:03:22.010> still

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
speed and just make sure that she still

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:26.710 
speed and just make sure that she still
stays<00:03:22.640> straight<00:03:23.030> run<00:03:23.540> straight<00:03:25.540> what's<00:03:26.540> in

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
stays straight run straight what's in

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.509 
stays straight run straight what's in
the<00:03:26.810> mind<00:03:27.049> of<00:03:27.170> selector<00:03:27.709> how<00:03:27.920> do<00:03:27.980> you<00:03:28.160> do<00:03:28.340> your

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:30.440 
job it's actually a lot easier than it

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.250 
job it's actually a lot easier than it
sounds<00:03:30.620> because<00:03:30.890> the<00:03:31.400> horses<00:03:31.730> pick<00:03:32.260> pick
