00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
that's a good good option but you can

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.340 
that's a good good option but you can

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
with your forearms keeping them away you

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.340 
with your forearms keeping them away you
shoot<00:00:41.820> your<00:00:41.940> hips<00:00:42.149> back<00:00:42.329> not<00:00:42.930> only<00:00:43.110> that<00:00:43.230> but

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
shoot your hips back not only that but

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.750 
shoot your hips back not only that but
their<00:00:43.500> heads<00:00:43.710> low<00:00:43.890> for<00:00:44.160> a<00:00:44.190> knee<00:00:44.370> to<00:00:44.520> the<00:00:44.550> face

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
their heads low for a knee to the face

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:46.279 
their heads low for a knee to the face
that's<00:00:45.000> kind<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.270> dangerous<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> better

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
that's kind of dangerous so a better

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.500 
that's kind of dangerous so a better
takedown<00:00:46.710> that<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.920> like<00:00:47.219> is<00:00:47.399> blocking<00:00:48.210> keeping

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
elbows only take a couple because some

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.450 
elbows only take a couple because some
could<00:00:52.260> sneak<00:00:52.469> through<00:00:52.500> but<00:00:53.129> here<00:00:53.280> you<00:00:53.340> can<00:00:53.430> see
