00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:10.469
 Hello everyone, so there is a stove which 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.070
 smokes stove was restored to 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:17.010
 ordinary house with natural gas was 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.010
 relocated them a private house 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.780
 balloon connected decree 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.140
 whose pressure is greater than private 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.790
 home 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:28.620
 need to change the jets here and then there will be 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:31.320
 normal mix stove will cease 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.960
 smoke using the jets internet on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:39.320
 those failed but similar to the closest 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:42.390
 the market helped find here they look like 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:46.410
 Now we will install them 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:55.220
 Now let's see how the balloon gas burns 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:55.220
 before replacing the nozzles and then after replacing 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:04.470
 faq 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:09.780
 after replacing the yellow should not at all 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:12.720
 to be or almost not to be given 

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:15.780
 the procedure can still be regulated but 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:22.369
 remove to do regulated 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.369
 gearbox nozzles safer and 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:35.090
 parse brought me already bolts shot 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.090
 it was easier 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:51.240
 hike with us especially nobody to climb this 

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:58.170
 unscrew before in the common dish we have disassembled 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:01.170
 and starting to break the nozzles one broke 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:05.430
 what will be one less comfort but 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.619
 nevertheless thats so uncomplicated 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:13.310
 tool that was once 

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:15.959
 acquired and ran aimlessly we 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:18.620
 turn the nozzles and we will screw 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:18.620
 new ones 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:31.640
 and the old nozzles on 8 head on 

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:31.640
 new at 7 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:53.510
 here is such a unit 

00:02:47.570 --> 00:03:02.690
 so old they have for nothing and here's a hole in 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:03:07.620
 new somewhere 4 5 times less so here 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.460
 flat us un cylinders here but 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.920
 we hope 

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:20.880
 I will stop smoking 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:22.310
 the rest will be hard to screw as 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:29.630
 comfort and 

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:29.630
 which broke but will 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.790
 giving was about 7 and will conclude 

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:09.790
 new ones 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.750
 but in general the tower is a new nozzle 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:05:18.180
 oysters so now we will check 

00:04:57.510 --> 00:05:21.780
 Look at the result of replacing the understudy 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:30.060
 yellow still somewhere slightly visible but already 

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:34.120
 let's not see how the dishes will be 

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:40.560
 will repair as before or less or 

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:40.560
 in general will not be until all collect plate 

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:48.070
 Well 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:53.590
 the part that broke off is obtained on 

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:58.200
 the regulator drowned out what a little 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:06:02.040
 baby will turn you go god forbid 

00:05:58.200 --> 00:06:02.040
 who so here 

00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:17.030
 so here is clogged abandoned in general here 

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:20.919
 the result is bad that there is a fork which 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:24.979
 At first it was turned on but it broke 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:31.729
 the rest burned about as well 

00:06:24.979 --> 00:06:37.039
 now is completely different in essence 

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:39.169
 and a tool that is all 

00:06:37.039 --> 00:06:47.020
 I understand that such a key with 

00:06:39.169 --> 00:06:48.610
 eat with such heads and and 

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:54.740
 adapters 

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:57.710
 but not worth the bits turned out to be garbage 

00:06:54.740 --> 00:06:59.270
 you can't really twist his hand because 

00:06:57.710 --> 00:07:03.560
 what is this part she just 

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:07.760
 scrolls so she and fight and need 

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:14.150
 modify it here either in this 

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:19.940
 case how to unleash the tool here 

00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:22.880
 good need to make a face and score 

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:26.990
 Well, the nose is still looking what kind of metal is here 

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:33.610
 but this sleeve and sat soft then confused 

00:07:26.990 --> 00:07:33.610
 it will not be on there ending 

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:40.210
 Thanks for attention 

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:40.210
 like this
