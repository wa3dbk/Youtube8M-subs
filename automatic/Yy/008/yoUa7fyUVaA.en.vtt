00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.660
 I gave you my heart and you walked away 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.980
 Secrets that we share 

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.540
 and moments that we take care of 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.200
 I gave you my heart and you walked away 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.780
 We were striped in the park, 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.920
 naked, bathed in darkness 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:22.040
 I gave you my heart and you walked away 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.520
 depressing melodies, 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.660
 suppressing fantasies 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.860
 I gave you my heart 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.960
 and you walked away 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:40.440
 I always loved my own brother 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.460
 And on our door appeared 

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.700
 I did not ask where he came from 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.580
 I would never be alone 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.140
 Soon we did everything together 

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.041
 He taught me how to fly a kite 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.560
 I saw him grow up on a stallion 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.640
 I saw him sleep at night 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.140
 That's not 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.180
 Rare 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.420
 But then he signed that seal 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:09.713
 A nice quintet of a youth group 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:13.659
 But now that everyone loves him 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:15.920
 I'm just a face in the crowd 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.901
 I threw myself in my studies 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:21.972
 To have the world in my control 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.007
 And I vaporized the competition 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.332
 No one understands me 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.921
 That's not 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.972
 Bad 

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.280
 I gave you my heart and you walked away 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.380
 Romantic dreams of pony, which never came to be 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.580
 I gave you my heart and you walked away 

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:41.320
 Girl ends the song, 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:42.860
 we are floating heads! 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.480
 You took it from me and then you ran away from it 

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.920
 Although this is forbidden, it is destiny 

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.660
 Saying I ACCEPT and seal our souls together 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.780
 Voulez-vous, our love will last forever 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.460
 Since we are not related, it will be fine 

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:09.100
 So different now than it seemed 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.000
 Now life has killed the dream that I dreamed
