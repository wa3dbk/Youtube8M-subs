00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.210 

with<00:00:00.719> the<00:00:00.840> dip<00:00:01.079> we<00:00:01.290> have<00:00:01.380> several<00:00:01.620> possible

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:02.220 
with the dip we have several possible

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.340 
with the dip we have several possible
variations<00:00:02.879> I'm<00:00:03.449> going<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.720> teach<00:00:04.200> you<00:00:04.319> all

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.350 
variations I'm going to teach you all

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.110 
variations I'm going to teach you all
the<00:00:04.710> different<00:00:04.830> ones<00:00:05.250> but<00:00:05.490> we're<00:00:05.940> going<00:00:06.029> to

00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:06.120 
the different ones but we're going to

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.080 
the different ones but we're going to
first<00:00:06.359> start<00:00:06.540> with<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.470> basic<00:00:07.500> dip<00:00:08.460> position

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:09.090 
first start with the basic dip position

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.169 
first start with the basic dip position
we<00:00:09.990> have<00:00:10.139> several<00:00:10.950> variation<00:00:11.639> that<00:00:11.730> are<00:00:11.910> based

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:12.179 
we have several variation that are based

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:15.680 
we have several variation that are based
on<00:00:12.420> body<00:00:12.960> position<00:00:13.559> for<00:00:14.309> example<00:00:14.790> we<00:00:15.570> have

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
on body position for example we have

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.320 
on body position for example we have
three<00:00:16.049> possible<00:00:16.650> lower<00:00:17.220> body<00:00:17.640> position<00:00:18.270> you

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
three possible lower body position you

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.620 
three possible lower body position you
can<00:00:18.480> take<00:00:18.750> three<00:00:19.529> different<00:00:19.680> angle<00:00:20.640> Bend<00:00:21.330> you

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
can take three different angle Bend you

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.390 
can take three different angle Bend you
can<00:00:21.810> take<00:00:22.020> and<00:00:22.230> two<00:00:22.650> different<00:00:22.949> elbows

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
can take and two different elbows

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.340 
can take and two different elbows
position<00:00:23.910> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.119> be<00:00:24.269> if<00:00:24.449> you<00:00:24.840> compound<00:00:25.199> that

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
position you can be if you compound that

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.710 
position you can be if you compound that
all<00:00:25.619> together<00:00:25.859> that's<00:00:26.220> several<00:00:27.029> possible

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720 
all together that's several possible

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.439 
all together that's several possible
exercises<00:00:28.529> but<00:00:29.039> when<00:00:29.220> we<00:00:29.340> use<00:00:29.490> the<00:00:29.760> basic<00:00:30.029> one

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
exercises but when we use the basic one

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.350 
exercises but when we use the basic one
which<00:00:30.720> use<00:00:30.960> the<00:00:31.230> middle<00:00:31.529> position<00:00:32.120> for<00:00:33.120> all

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
which use the middle position for all

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.290 
which use the middle position for all
three<00:00:34.020> segments<00:00:34.530> so<00:00:35.010> the<00:00:35.399> first<00:00:35.670> portion<00:00:36.030> is

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
three segments so the first portion is

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.020 
three segments so the first portion is
the<00:00:36.570> leg<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.350> want<00:00:37.590> the<00:00:37.829> upper<00:00:38.340> leg<00:00:38.550> to<00:00:38.879> be

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
the leg you want the upper leg to be

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.389 
the leg you want the upper leg to be
pointed<00:00:39.420> straight<00:00:39.899> downward<00:00:40.500> you<00:00:40.920> can<00:00:41.129> bend

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
pointed straight downward you can bend

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.010 
pointed straight downward you can bend
your<00:00:41.460> legs<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.120> you're<00:00:42.270> tall<00:00:42.510> and<00:00:42.899> then

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
your legs because you're tall and then

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.380 
your legs because you're tall and then
your<00:00:43.170> lower<00:00:43.290> legs<00:00:43.590> nor<00:00:44.370> like<00:00:44.579> but<00:00:44.789> you<00:00:44.940> can't

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
your lower legs nor like but you can't

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.139 
your lower legs nor like but you can't
move<00:00:46.079> that<00:00:46.500> that's<00:00:46.860> pointed<00:00:47.489> straight<00:00:47.850> down

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
move that that's pointed straight down

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:50.690 
move that that's pointed straight down
to<00:00:48.420> the<00:00:48.539> floor<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:49.500> the<00:00:49.530> torso<00:00:50.160> angle<00:00:50.579> is

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
to the floor then the torso angle is

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.600 
to the floor then the torso angle is
going<00:00:50.820> to<00:00:50.879> be<00:00:50.940> slightly<00:00:51.559> angled<00:00:52.559> forward<00:00:52.949> not

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
going to be slightly angled forward not

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.970 
going to be slightly angled forward not
an<00:00:53.760> extreme<00:00:54.270> ban<00:00:54.570> not<00:00:55.140> straight<00:00:55.590> forward<00:00:55.949> just

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
an extreme ban not straight forward just

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.220 
an extreme ban not straight forward just
like<00:00:56.340> a<00:00:56.550> thirty<00:00:57.000> degrees<00:00:57.420> bend<00:00:57.660> forward<00:00:58.020> and

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
like a thirty degrees bend forward and

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.770 
like a thirty degrees bend forward and
your<00:00:58.739> elbows<00:00:59.250> will<00:00:59.579> not<00:00:59.820> be<00:01:00.030> tucked<00:01:00.329> in<00:01:00.480> too

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
your elbows will not be tucked in too

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.990 
your elbows will not be tucked in too
close<00:01:01.320> not<00:01:02.100> too<00:01:02.309> wide<00:01:02.489> they're<00:01:02.699> really

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000 
close not too wide they're really

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.299 
close not too wide they're really
neutral<00:01:03.449> I<00:01:03.690> can<00:01:03.989> imagine<00:01:04.110> like<00:01:04.379> I<00:01:04.619> call<00:01:05.159> it<00:01:05.280> a

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
neutral I can imagine like I call it a

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.520 
neutral I can imagine like I call it a
gunslinger<00:01:05.909> position<00:01:06.659> you're<00:01:07.080> like<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.380> like

don't bend forward don't extend just

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.969 
don't bend forward don't extend just
stay<00:01:52.970> in<00:01:53.030> a<00:01:53.149> neutral<00:01:53.509> position<00:01:56.590> don't<00:01:57.590> look<00:01:57.830> up

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
stay in a neutral position don't look up

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:03.449 
stay in a neutral position don't look up
just<00:01:58.700> keep<00:01:58.880> it<00:01:58.970> neutral<00:01:59.409> exactly<00:02:01.840> that's<00:02:02.840> the

00:02:03.449 --> 00:02:03.459 
just keep it neutral exactly that's the

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:06.639 
just keep it neutral exactly that's the
first<00:02:04.459> variation<00:02:04.850> you<00:02:05.270> can<00:02:05.450> make<00:02:05.659> is<00:02:05.929> to

00:02:06.639 --> 00:02:06.649 
first variation you can make is to

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.370 
first variation you can make is to
increase<00:02:07.130> chest<00:02:07.729> involvement<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.929> dip

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:09.380 
increase chest involvement in the dip

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.009 
increase chest involvement in the dip
so<00:02:09.890> we'll<00:02:10.100> do<00:02:10.310> two<00:02:10.670> modification<00:02:11.540> first<00:02:11.840> of

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
so we'll do two modification first of

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.370 
so we'll do two modification first of
all<00:02:12.170> we'll<00:02:12.860> bend<00:02:13.280> forward<00:02:13.910> more<00:02:14.330> to<00:02:14.989> increase

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
all we'll bend forward more to increase

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.440 
all we'll bend forward more to increase
the<00:02:15.650> involvement<00:02:15.950> of<00:02:16.250> the<00:02:16.400> chest<00:02:16.730> second

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 
the involvement of the chest second

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.140 
the involvement of the chest second
you'll<00:02:17.840> bring<00:02:18.140> the<00:02:18.350> legs<00:02:18.560> forward<00:02:19.160> to<00:02:19.819> shift

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
you'll bring the legs forward to shift

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.820 
you'll bring the legs forward to shift
the<00:02:20.480> weight<00:02:20.690> forward<00:02:20.720> so<00:02:21.380> that<00:02:21.530> more<00:02:21.739> emphasis

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:21.830 
the weight forward so that more emphasis

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.350 
the weight forward so that more emphasis
will<00:02:22.220> put<00:02:22.370> on<00:02:22.519> chest<00:02:22.790> so<00:02:23.830> bend<00:02:24.830> forward<00:02:25.360> legs

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
will put on chest so bend forward legs

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.630 
will put on chest so bend forward legs
forward<00:02:26.810> squeeze<00:02:27.200> your<00:02:27.319> inner<00:02:27.380> four<00:02:28.340> and

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
forward squeeze your inner four and

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:32.810 
forward squeeze your inner four and
squeeze<00:02:29.360> your<00:02:29.480> hands

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:40.590 

legs<00:02:33.820> forward<00:02:38.220> that's<00:02:39.220> that's<00:02:39.640> the<00:02:39.910> chest<00:02:40.240> dip

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
legs forward that's that's the chest dip

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.010 
legs forward that's that's the chest dip
go<00:02:41.410> forward<00:02:41.950> legs<00:02:42.820> forward<00:02:43.240> shift<00:02:43.660> of<00:02:43.870> weight

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
go forward legs forward shift of weight

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.440 
go forward legs forward shift of weight
in<00:02:44.710> front<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.160> you<00:02:45.280> increase<00:02:46.060> chest

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:46.450 
in front of you increase chest

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:49.290 
in front of you increase chest
involvement<00:02:47.020> the<00:02:47.770> other<00:02:47.890> big<00:02:48.220> dip<00:02:48.520> variation

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300 
involvement the other big dip variation

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.320 
involvement the other big dip variation
is<00:02:49.510> to<00:02:49.570> increase<00:02:50.560> triceps<00:02:51.310> involvement<00:02:51.850> so

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
is to increase triceps involvement so

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.210 
is to increase triceps involvement so
with<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.660> chest<00:02:52.990> dip<00:02:53.290> we<00:02:53.620> bend<00:02:53.890> forward

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:54.220 
with the chest dip we bend forward

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:57.360 
with the chest dip we bend forward
brought<00:02:54.970> the<00:02:55.150> legs<00:02:55.360> forward<00:02:55.740> with<00:02:56.740> triceps

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
brought the legs forward with triceps

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.400 
brought the legs forward with triceps
we'll<00:02:57.610> do<00:02:57.730> the<00:02:57.850> opposite<00:02:58.300> so<00:02:58.570> we<00:02:58.720> make<00:02:58.990> all<00:02:59.200> the

00:02:59.400 --> 00:02:59.410 
we'll do the opposite so we make all the

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.170 
we'll do the opposite so we make all the
efforts<00:02:59.710> possible<00:03:00.190> to<00:03:00.310> keep<00:03:00.490> the<00:03:00.640> upper<00:03:00.970> torso

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
efforts possible to keep the upper torso

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.750 
efforts possible to keep the upper torso
perfectly<00:03:01.870> straight<00:03:02.500> and<00:03:02.710> you<00:03:03.190> bring<00:03:03.460> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
perfectly straight and you bring the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.790 
perfectly straight and you bring the
legs<00:03:03.940> backwards<00:03:04.420> as<00:03:04.900> much<00:03:05.110> as<00:03:05.260> you<00:03:05.380> can<00:03:05.590> and

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:05.800 
legs backwards as much as you can and

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.080 
legs backwards as much as you can and
you<00:03:06.040> maintain<00:03:06.370> that<00:03:06.400> position<00:03:06.850> when<00:03:06.940> you<00:03:07.000> go

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
you maintain that position when you go

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.960 
you maintain that position when you go
down<00:03:07.300> so<00:03:07.750> to<00:03:08.230> maintain<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.040> chest<00:03:09.490> position

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
down so to maintain the chest position

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:11.850 
down so to maintain the chest position
the<00:03:10.420> chest<00:03:10.690> deposition<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.350> squeeze<00:03:11.710> your

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:11.860 
the chest deposition you squeeze your

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.920 
the chest deposition you squeeze your
abs<00:03:12.160> to<00:03:12.820> prevent<00:03:13.180> your<00:03:13.300> legs<00:03:13.480> from<00:03:13.630> moving

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
abs to prevent your legs from moving

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.630 
abs to prevent your legs from moving
back<00:03:14.110> so<00:03:14.590> not<00:03:14.770> what<00:03:15.100> not<00:03:15.250> what<00:03:15.400> you're<00:03:15.520> going

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
back so not what not what you're going

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.670 
back so not what not what you're going
to<00:03:15.670> be<00:03:15.790> doing<00:03:16.000> is<00:03:16.330> squeezing<00:03:16.810> your<00:03:17.050> glutes<00:03:17.440> and

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
to be doing is squeezing your glutes and

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:19.560 
to be doing is squeezing your glutes and
lower<00:03:18.010> back<00:03:18.310> to<00:03:18.580> keep<00:03:18.760> the<00:03:18.880> proper<00:03:19.210> upright

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
lower back to keep the proper upright

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.869 
lower back to keep the proper upright
position

00:03:23.869 --> 00:03:23.879 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:31.319 

x-pac<00:03:25.049> stay<00:03:26.049> upright<00:03:29.099> that's<00:03:30.099> now<00:03:30.730> obviously

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:31.329 
x-pac stay upright that's now obviously

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:33.660 
x-pac stay upright that's now obviously
if<00:03:32.230> you<00:03:32.379> want<00:03:32.530> to<00:03:32.620> make<00:03:32.739> the<00:03:33.010> variation<00:03:33.459> even

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
if you want to make the variation even

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.390 
if you want to make the variation even
more<00:03:33.819> effective<00:03:34.239> you<00:03:34.689> change<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.829> hand<00:03:36.159> width

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:36.400 
more effective you change the hand width

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.360 
more effective you change the hand width
so<00:03:36.909> for<00:03:37.150> triceps<00:03:37.420> should<00:03:37.810> be<00:03:37.930> closer<00:03:38.200> in

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
so for triceps should be closer in

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.920 
so for triceps should be closer in
closer<00:03:39.370> in<00:03:39.670> those<00:03:40.180> will<00:03:40.329> be<00:03:40.450> closer<00:03:40.689> to<00:03:40.810> the

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:40.930 
closer in those will be closer to the

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:43.649 
closer in those will be closer to the
body<00:03:41.200> so<00:03:41.500> that's<00:03:41.530> more<00:03:41.889> triceps<00:03:42.459> here<00:03:43.120> if<00:03:43.299> it's

00:03:43.649 --> 00:03:43.659 
body so that's more triceps here if it's

00:03:43.659 --> 00:03:45.479 
body so that's more triceps here if it's
wider<00:03:44.019> and<00:03:44.379> it's<00:03:44.650> gonna<00:03:44.769> be<00:03:44.889> a<00:03:44.920> bit<00:03:45.069> more<00:03:45.189> chest

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:45.489 
wider and it's gonna be a bit more chest

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:46.949 
wider and it's gonna be a bit more chest
I'm<00:03:45.579> going<00:03:45.609> to<00:03:45.760> use<00:03:45.909> a<00:03:46.150> slightly<00:03:46.510> narrower

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
I'm going to use a slightly narrower

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.640 
I'm going to use a slightly narrower
grip<00:03:47.230> squeeze<00:03:48.010> the<00:03:48.129> glute<00:03:48.370> legs<00:03:48.879> back<00:03:49.650> upper

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:50.650 
grip squeeze the glute legs back upper

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:57.629 
grip squeeze the glute legs back upper
body<00:03:50.829> straight<00:03:53.639> good<00:03:55.919> for<00:03:56.919> this<00:03:57.040> one<00:03:57.189> lock<00:03:57.459> up

00:03:57.629 --> 00:03:57.639 
body straight good for this one lock up

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:02.710 
body straight good for this one lock up
at<00:03:57.849> the<00:03:58.030> end

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:02.720 

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.330 

that's<00:04:03.290> it

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.570 

so<00:04:07.340> these<00:04:07.520> are<00:04:07.760> the<00:04:08.060> three<00:04:08.390> basic<00:04:09.100> tips<00:04:10.100> the

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:10.580 
so these are the three basic tips the

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.030 
so these are the three basic tips the
first<00:04:10.819> one<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.120> the<00:04:11.270> neutral<00:04:11.750> which<00:04:12.290> works<00:04:12.830> the

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
first one is the neutral which works the
