00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.350

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.790

 videos we're going to start with this 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:48.929
 tutorial we saw more let's start 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.969
 preparing the mobile eyelid so that we 

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.280
 lasts much longer the shadows and look 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.870
 more pigmented we will apply it for all 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:02.819
 the mobile eyelids and a little bit by the 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:04.860
 Lower soul of eyelashes as shadows 

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:06.840
 I'm going to choose this blue shadow that is and 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.420
 endorsed with a very beautiful color and a 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.730
 finished in silver that according to the 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:15.110
 sun looks darker clearer creating 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:15.110
 the volume effect itself 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:23.640
 for this type of makeup only 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.100
 a shadow opts for pretty shadows 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:37.740
 special and that give that unique touch to 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:39.840
 make-up let's give the final touch 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.460
 let's create a shadow eyeliner 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.680
 this shadow is pronounced dry and in 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.110
 wet let's delineate the superior good 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.730
 of eyelashes and concentrating mostly on 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.730
 the hole that we left in tears 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.150
 we went to give the intensity and 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.150
 also apply the mascara 

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:14.940
 works well in shadow blur 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:16.740
 to have a polished finish we're going to 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.660
 move to the face first let's correct 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.610
 and at the same time we will use it to polish the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.030
 makeup and then we will pass on our 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.830
 base 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:25.520
 trip that I am going to apply with a 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.520
 wet sponge 

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.770
 and 

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:49.720
 Now it's time to return that volume 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.000
 that we have removed from the face and also 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.590
 let's apply some color using 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.420
 a blusher that can also be used in 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:03.160
 the lips and that we will also use in 

00:02:55.420 --> 00:03:05.290
 lips but for that first we're going to 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:07.450
 delineate the lips especially in the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.310
 area of ​​the commissures then we're going to 

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.770
 apply this product in the center and 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:15.180
 let's polish the lips applying a 

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:15.180
 little concealer on the edges 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.180
 and 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.430

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.410

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.410
