00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.570
 charny fishermen hello we are you 

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:36.460
 hydrate in four sequences of our 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.120
 new editing section for dummies 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.070
 indeed this little sequence that is going to 

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.930
 take place in a dozen parties 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:47.140
 not allow me to mount montages 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.480
 more simply and I had told everyone 

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.670
 beginning fishermen who do not know it 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.379
 not too much how to ride more to that 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.870
 I presented them from simple to 

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.030
 more basic without trying to do 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.410
 complicated but everyone after made 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.629
 some sequences can be mounted 

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:04.560
 effective advantage to fish the map 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:08.130
 it either channel where you are in in 

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:08.130
 Thank you for your attention 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.860
 no 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:31.280
 for the first edit it will us 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.560
 have a needle at war 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:42.460
 input your ticket for a child blinds 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:42.460
 and so why inventory 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:55.060
 cut slightly larger than the 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.970
 montage that you want to do here on 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:03.579
 just make a little loop that goes 

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:11.769
 serve to fix the boilie stock or the 

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:14.430
 polka dot castle in general not to 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:19.330
 for not that the wii is a forgiveness 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:21.190
 then we will put our ticket to 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:22.480
 using a needle is what you 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.870
 find in the trade we find 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.000
 everywhere for you can adjust your 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.599
 tan choice with vrillette 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.120
 choice of the strike is the same you 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:39.519
 train your report so why 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.470
 put the intake before the moment all 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:42.780
 just to adjust the length of the 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:45.370
 hair 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:49.810
 in Switzerland this assembly can you 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:52.239
 refill because your hair will be 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:55.390
 already settled so here we put two no 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.989
 will take place we will push the logic 

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:58.420
 until the end 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:01.900
 here you see it can not leave 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:07.150
 it's very simple then we take the 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:10.600
 hand are always enter your trait 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.139
 in both directions to come out side 

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:14.019
 point 

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:15.190
 it's very very very important otherwise 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.639
 your running fixture are going 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:22.389
 very well so the principle is to 

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:24.910
 block your hair at the height of the 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:27.489
 tip of the man are leaving a 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:29.609
 some freedom to old me I 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:34.060
 always leave about one cm 

00:03:29.609 --> 00:03:35.889
 this is what must be able to pass in front of 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:39.549
 him without being completely free like 

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:43.950
 that when you all blocked us 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:46.510
 turn your room side closed eye 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.519
 because in manufacturing you have 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.849
 always had a small opening of the wire 

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.940
 of iron 

00:03:48.849 --> 00:03:54.370
 it is important not to go through there 

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:55.810
 you turn that you turn 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:00.629
 make hoverflies next to 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:05.379
 others just caa1 the height of the time 

00:04:00.629 --> 00:04:06.819
 and you iron your line of 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:10.450
 the outside of the house towards 

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:17.620
 the copied inside tip you shoot you 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:19.690
 tighten your assembly here and toulon is 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:23.290
 able to do this montage there this 

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:28.840
 fitting the man is effective but passes 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:31.419
 attention left between 5 to 10 mm 

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:33.460
 between your budget and for 1200 

00:04:31.419 --> 00:04:35.440
 the more your learning to the more will 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.150
 stay the space so on my agenda is 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.820
 scheduled for July of 18 thousand beasts 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:41.740
 you can reuse it will wear this 

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:44.800
 always piquing with this same type of 

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:47.680
 boilies then you still here 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:52.300
 to attach a small cricket to the end 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.710
 is your suitcase will be ready for the 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:55.900
 first sequence you know how to ride a 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:59.130
 basic ballet that takes the fish 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.130
 generally everywhere 

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.510
 m 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:11.409
 and 

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.409
 and 

00:05:11.409 --> 00:05:13.409
 and
