00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:45.770 
going to have to give it its own power

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:47.590 
going to have to give it its own power
source<00:00:46.100> and<00:00:46.580> then<00:00:46.880> you<00:00:47.000> should<00:00:47.060> charge<00:00:47.330> it

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
source and then you should charge it

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.770 
source and then you should charge it
whenever<00:00:47.750> it's<00:00:48.080> running<00:00:48.350> low<00:00:48.940> you<00:00:49.940> get<00:00:50.120> two

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:50.780 
whenever it's running low you get two

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:55.000 
whenever it's running low you get two
big<00:00:51.110> Duracell<00:00:51.770> batteries<00:00:52.430> and<00:00:53.110> just<00:00:54.110> out<00:00:54.950> of

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
big Duracell batteries and just out of

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.910 
big Duracell batteries and just out of
it<00:00:55.190> they<00:00:55.610> are<00:00:56.030> in<00:00:56.210> the<00:00:56.530> container<00:00:57.530> for<00:00:57.890> the

00:00:57.910 --> 00:00:57.920 
it they are in the container for the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.710 
it they are in the container for the
keyboard<00:00:58.310> make<00:00:58.790> sure<00:00:58.940> that<00:00:59.060> positive<00:00:59.600> ends

00:00:59.710 --> 00:00:59.720 
keyboard make sure that positive ends

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:01.120 
keyboard make sure that positive ends
are<00:00:59.900> facing<00:01:00.290> towards<00:01:00.590> the<00:01:00.680> outer<00:01:00.860> edge

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:01.130 
are facing towards the outer edge

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.999 
are facing towards the outer edge
because<00:01:02.170> we<00:01:03.170> only<00:01:03.320> need<00:01:03.500> them<00:01:03.650> attached<00:01:03.980> to

00:01:03.999 --> 00:01:04.009 
because we only need them attached to

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:06.340 
because we only need them attached to
one<00:01:04.759> little<00:01:04.939> thing<00:01:05.239> so<00:01:05.900> it'll<00:01:06.109> be<00:01:06.170> more

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.350 
one little thing so it'll be more

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:07.719 
one little thing so it'll be more
convenient<00:01:06.710> to<00:01:06.950> have<00:01:07.100> the<00:01:07.189> negative<00:01:07.369> ends

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
convenient to have the negative ends

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.380 
convenient to have the negative ends
angled<00:01:08.420> toward<00:01:08.630> off<00:01:08.780> space<00:01:09.429> so<00:01:10.429> have<00:01:11.240> the

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
angled toward off space so have the

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.999 
angled toward off space so have the
power<00:01:11.570> source

00:01:11.999 --> 00:01:12.009 
power source

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.249 
power source
next<00:01:13.009> what<00:01:13.100> really<00:01:13.310> is<00:01:13.929> big<00:01:14.929> man<00:01:15.079> it's<00:01:15.200> a

we're going to want to attach a charger
to<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:20.780> power<00:01:20.960> source<00:01:21.259> before<00:01:21.530> we<00:01:21.890> put

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
to the power source before we put

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.160 
to the power source before we put
anything<00:01:22.310> else<00:01:22.520> in<00:01:22.780> so<00:01:23.780> what<00:01:23.899> you're<00:01:24.020> going<00:01:24.140> to
