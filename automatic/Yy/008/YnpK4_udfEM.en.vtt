00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:10.220
 requesting your services and help 

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:11.660
 vowels good as the title says 

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.360
 that is already quite obvious for the 

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:16.610
 I need and it is for me machinima link to 

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.170
 ugly trailer that I made in three hours in the 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:19.820
 description the machinima do not have 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.550
 basically nothing to do with the trailer 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.290
 but it's nice anyway good of 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.450
 done is not even pretty as it is 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.220
 well I need your vocal help because of 

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.800
 that makes a greater one with only one 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.360
 voice is something difficult and I do not know how is the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.379
 last player with global help but it's 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:35.149
 another story 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:36.800
 Well, I need your help in the 

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:38.510
 following circumstances because 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.309
 obviously there are requirements that must be 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.230
 meet for a little machine first that 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.079
 nothing you should have an external microphone 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.909
 like this one or a microphone that 

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:49.399
 connect your computer to a microphone 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:51.559
 internal not a microphone any 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.210
 you can use any microphone 

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:55.609
 that connects to your pc and you can narrate 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.010
 with him as I was just good 

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.870
 they will ask why if nobody uses those 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.269
 copies good because when you put the 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.460
 microphone that I'm not wrong to put 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:06.920
 internal microphone is achieved capturing the 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.049
 background sound of someone speaking the 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.980
 cars going on and on and it's not that I 

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.960
 I complained about many of those 

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.820
 and also when putting it for background music 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:16.220
 it distorts a bit is to hear ugly 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.620
 with the vegas very study so I think 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:20.390
 which is better that way with a non-external piece 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.070
 where quality also counts in the 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.200
 audio another thing that they should do is have 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.480
 a slightly mature voice I do not say that 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.390
 have the voice of adults or gentlemen of 45 

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.130
 years not a voice a little bit mature that is 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.620
 my bike is very mature but something is something 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.990
 as from my voice onwards for putting a 

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.060
 standard more or less good the other thing 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.010
 that must continue exist in all this 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.740
 will send an audition of at least one 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.200
 minute in an audio file any 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.030
 audio format of the problem in what 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.550
 you record on any recording thing already 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:51.080
 sawdust ibi sony vegas of recorder 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.720
 sounds of live tastes not those of 

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:55.610
 record it where they are and I pass it to this 

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.470
 mail that appears on the screen there is what 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:59.870
 bigger and I read in the mails if 

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.950
 they pass the quality test and all that 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:02.930
 they killed them better by performing 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.990
 congratulations to the cattle blah blah blah but 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:08.210

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.649
