slope<00:00:58.780> down<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.500> other<00:00:59.649> side<00:00:59.949> and<00:01:00.219> if<00:01:00.280> you're

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
slope down the other side and if you're

slope down the other side and if you're
sitting<00:01:00.670> in<00:01:00.760> the<00:01:00.850> 4<00:01:01.059> or<00:01:01.180> the<00:01:01.239> five<00:01:01.510> seats

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
sitting in the 4 or the five seats

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.959 
sitting in the 4 or the five seats
there's<00:01:02.590> a<00:01:02.680> slot<00:01:03.039> on<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:03.370> side<00:01:03.550> of<00:01:03.579> the<00:01:03.760> dealer

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
there's a slot on the side of the dealer

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:05.340 
there's a slot on the side of the dealer
you<00:01:04.059> can<00:01:04.210> go<00:01:04.300> right<00:01:04.479> through<00:01:04.539> that<00:01:04.780> slot<00:01:05.170> and

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
you can go right through that slot and

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:06.510 
you can go right through that slot and
that's<00:01:05.470> what<00:01:05.590> I<00:01:05.619> have<00:01:05.710> my<00:01:05.830> car<00:01:06.039> just<00:01:06.310> slowly

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
that's what I have my car just slowly

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.540 
that's what I have my car just slowly
slid<00:01:07.110> down<00:01:08.110> the<00:01:08.140> slot<00:01:08.530> and<00:01:08.770> on<00:01:08.890> the<00:01:09.039> floor<00:01:09.280> and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
slid down the slot and on the floor and

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:12.240 
slid down the slot and on the floor and
the<00:01:10.479> rule<00:01:10.690> is<00:01:10.930> anyway<00:01:11.380> your<00:01:11.560> cards<00:01:11.830> get<00:01:12.009> off

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
the rule is anyway your cards get off

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:13.980 
the rule is anyway your cards get off
the<00:01:12.520> table<00:01:12.700> it's<00:01:13.090> a<00:01:13.180> ten-minute<00:01:13.600> penalty<00:01:13.720> it's

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990 
the table it's a ten-minute penalty it's

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.870 
the table it's a ten-minute penalty it's
it's<00:01:14.200> a<00:01:14.320> pretty<00:01:14.500> ridiculous<00:01:15.100> rule<00:01:15.369> especially

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:15.880 
it's a pretty ridiculous rule especially

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.120 
it's a pretty ridiculous rule especially
here<00:01:16.060> where<00:01:16.090> the<00:01:16.330> tables<00:01:16.720> are<00:01:16.899> such<00:01:17.140> that<00:01:17.890> two

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130 
here where the tables are such that two

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.490 
here where the tables are such that two
of<00:01:18.160> the<00:01:18.340> seats<00:01:18.550> have<00:01:18.700> a<00:01:18.759> big<00:01:19.000> disadvantage<00:01:19.500> now

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
of the seats have a big disadvantage now

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:21.929 
of the seats have a big disadvantage now
the<00:01:20.560> tables<00:01:21.039> aren't<00:01:21.220> bowed<00:01:21.460> so<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.729> probably

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
the tables aren't bowed so I probably

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:23.580 
the tables aren't bowed so I probably
won't<00:01:22.119> get<00:01:22.330> any<00:01:22.479> more<00:01:22.600> penalties<00:01:23.140> like<00:01:23.350> that

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
won't get any more penalties like that

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.469 
won't get any more penalties like that
well<00:01:24.220> that's<00:01:24.400> good<00:01:24.580> no<00:01:24.759> you're<00:01:24.970> not<00:01:25.060> expecting

00:01:25.469 --> 00:01:25.479 
well that's good no you're not expecting

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:27.090 
well that's good no you're not expecting
any<00:01:25.600> more<00:01:25.689> penalties<00:01:26.140> tell<00:01:26.380> us<00:01:26.470> how<00:01:26.680> how<00:01:27.040> the

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:27.100 
any more penalties tell us how how the

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.350 
any more penalties tell us how how the
game's<00:01:27.369> going<00:01:27.490> how<00:01:27.939> are<00:01:28.060> things<00:01:28.090> at<00:01:28.299> your

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
game's going how are things at your

game's going how are things at your
table<00:01:29.250> I've<00:01:30.250> been<00:01:30.460> really<00:01:30.640> struggling<00:01:31.030> I've

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450 
table I've been really struggling I've

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:33.630 
table I've been really struggling I've
had<00:01:31.780> a<00:01:31.810> pair<00:01:32.140> of<00:01:32.170> nines<00:01:32.530> that's<00:01:33.189> been<00:01:33.490> my

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
had a pair of nines that's been my

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.550

biggest big hand and a pair of fives

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.179 
biggest big hand and a pair of fives
once<00:01:35.950> I<00:01:36.159> think<00:01:36.220> that's<00:01:36.640> been<00:01:36.820> about<00:01:37.000> it<00:01:37.060> and

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
once I think that's been about it and

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.560 
once I think that's been about it and
I've<00:01:39.189> been<00:01:39.490> short<00:01:39.759> on<00:01:39.880> chips<00:01:40.210> when<00:01:40.420> you're

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:40.570 
I've been short on chips when you're
