airplane<00:01:10.650> at<00:01:10.799> low<00:01:10.950> altitude<00:01:11.549> simply<00:01:12.119> because

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
airplane at low altitude simply because

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.710 
airplane at low altitude simply because
it<00:01:12.689> isn't<00:01:12.869> as<00:01:13.110> efficient<00:01:13.650> down<00:01:13.860> low

it isn't as efficient down low

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.690 
it isn't as efficient down low
thus<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.960> non<00:01:16.170> turbo<00:01:16.650> will<00:01:16.860> likely<00:01:17.100> do<00:01:17.400> better

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
thus the non turbo will likely do better

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.700 
thus the non turbo will likely do better

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
active seasons there's the question of

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.090 
active seasons there's the question of

reliability - there's more to break when

weather<00:02:02.159> than<00:02:02.579> to<00:02:02.790> the<00:02:02.880> mechanicals<00:02:03.570> we'll

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
weather than to the mechanicals we'll

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.490 
weather than to the mechanicals we'll
talk<00:02:04.469> about<00:02:04.619> that<00:02:04.979> a<00:02:05.009> bit<00:02:05.100> more<00:02:05.250> later

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
talk about that a bit more later

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.639 
talk about that a bit more later
how<00:02:07.190> does<00:02:07.370> a<00:02:07.400> turbocharger<00:02:08.179> work<00:02:08.450> the<00:02:09.289> device

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
how does a turbocharger work the device

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.790 
how does a turbocharger work the device
has<00:02:09.920> a<00:02:09.950> turbine<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.700> a<00:02:10.880> compressor<00:02:11.450> section

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
has a turbine and a compressor section

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.770 
has a turbine and a compressor section
the<00:02:12.800> turbine<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.370> driven<00:02:13.610> by<00:02:13.910> exhaust<00:02:14.360> flow

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780 
the turbine is driven by exhaust flow

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.720 
the turbine is driven by exhaust flow
and<00:02:15.110> is<00:02:15.230> connected<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.800> the<00:02:15.890> compressor<00:02:16.280> by<00:02:16.700> a

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:16.730 
and is connected to the compressor by a

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.150 
and is connected to the compressor by a
shaft
