education<00:02:59.100> for<00:02:59.250> everybody<00:02:59.580> but<00:02:59.760> but<00:03:00.240> meantime

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
education for everybody but but meantime

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:01.700 
education for everybody but but meantime
is<00:03:00.900> there<00:03:01.020> going<00:03:01.110> to<00:03:01.170> be<00:03:01.230> some<00:03:01.440> sort<00:03:01.650> of

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
is there going to be some sort of

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:03.170 
is there going to be some sort of
punishment<00:03:01.920> since<00:03:02.400> you're<00:03:02.610> not<00:03:02.730> supposed<00:03:03.090> to

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
punishment since you're not supposed to

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.710 
punishment since you're not supposed to
have<00:03:03.390> a<00:03:03.420> lighter<00:03:03.750> on<00:03:04.020> campus<00:03:05.210> right<00:03:06.210> and<00:03:06.540> the

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
have a lighter on campus right and the

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.180 
have a lighter on campus right and the
punishment<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.290> guess<00:03:07.440> will<00:03:07.620> be<00:03:07.650> determined

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
punishment I guess will be determined

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.800 
punishment I guess will be determined
later<00:03:08.370> and<00:03:08.700> they'll<00:03:08.790> kind<00:03:08.940> of<00:03:09.090> that<00:03:09.660> really

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
later and they'll kind of that really

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.110 
later and they'll kind of that really
wasn't<00:03:10.110> even<00:03:10.380> disclosed<00:03:10.830> today<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.550> I<00:03:11.580> guess

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
wasn't even disclosed today so I guess

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.910 
wasn't even disclosed today so I guess
there's<00:03:12.420> an<00:03:12.570> assumption<00:03:12.870> I<00:03:13.080> made<00:03:13.260> that<00:03:13.530> at

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
there's an assumption I made that at

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.440 
there's an assumption I made that at
least<00:03:14.100> on<00:03:14.280> the<00:03:14.340> investigators<00:03:14.970> part<00:03:15.239> that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
least on the investigators part that

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.760 
least on the investigators part that
there<00:03:15.810> would<00:03:15.989> be<00:03:16.020> some<00:03:16.320> sort<00:03:16.500> of<00:03:16.530> punishment

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
there would be some sort of punishment

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.560 
there would be some sort of punishment
for<00:03:17.190> that<00:03:17.310> student<00:03:17.730> but<00:03:17.850> again<00:03:18.090> he's<00:03:18.270> hoping

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:18.570 
for that student but again he's hoping

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.150 
for that student but again he's hoping
that<00:03:18.630> he<00:03:19.020> can<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.290> of<00:03:19.410> use<00:03:19.650> this<00:03:19.860> to<00:03:20.010> go<00:03:20.130> back

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
that he can kind of use this to go back

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.070 
that he can kind of use this to go back
