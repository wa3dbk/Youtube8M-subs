00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.900 
and pot agreed were reprinted I mean
they've<00:04:56.710> been<00:04:56.740> reprinting<00:04:57.370> top<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.790> your

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
frequently as they are now but I think

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.530 
frequently as they are now but I think
that's<00:05:02.260> really<00:05:02.590> good<00:05:02.740> for<00:05:02.770> the<00:05:03.010> game<00:05:03.540> unlike

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
the important thing to remember is that

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:15.030 
the important thing to remember is that
in<00:06:12.730> ueo<00:06:13.300> cards<00:06:13.960> are<00:06:14.050> going<00:06:14.170> to<00:06:14.230> get<00:06:14.560> reprinted

forever<00:06:17.290> and<00:06:17.820> now<00:06:18.820> it<00:06:19.030> looks<00:06:19.090> like<00:06:19.300> they<00:06:19.510> might

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:19.630 
forever and now it looks like they might

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.240
