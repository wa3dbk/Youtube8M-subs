00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.510
 hello friends welcome to the analyzes 

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.570
 behind ember dotcom today we present 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:15.169
 a new thermal jacket of the house 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:17.240
 rap the rap model is about hood and like 

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:19.520
 you see a jacket that is a bit 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.110
 everything is well and well preserved 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.809
 the heat to explain them and is that 

00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:26.809
 has the polar tech alpha this new 

00:00:23.809 --> 00:00:29.180
 technology that what it does is a fabric 

00:00:26.809 --> 00:00:31.550
 synthetic interlacing that we 

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:33.980
 It provides a very good thermal power 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.450
 thought to do physical activity but 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.100
 that does not compromise the design 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.080
 note that many of the garments 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:41.060
 thermal if we think of down or in 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.460
 otherwise they usually have cells for 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.980
 keep in place and distribute 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:48.140
 correctly the thermal capacity with 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.360
 the alpha this is not necessary and in addition 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:52.340
 although it gets wet the alpha follows 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.810
 providing calorific power this is 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.989
 one of the advantages of this fiber 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.940
 synthetic good deal fix all 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:02.180
 This garment is also made with per 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.820
 text or is at home the model that is 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.579
 using for rap is the micro light is 

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.799
 the lightest model in the house 

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:10.880
 perth ex good all this technology 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:12.649
 mounted here 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.110
 to favor when we are going to 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:17.630
 run feel comfortable or a garment a 

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.100
 little elastic and very breathable like os 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.110
 we said even if he got wet with our 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.240
 sweat will continue to have very good 

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.810
 thermal properties we start sleeves 

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:30.440
 fijaros Quilted you agree something 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:32.840
 remember a little to those old 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.810
 Tracks that we used is worth something 

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:39.830
 similar agreement but with very good 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:41.480
 thermal capacity set here the logo 

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:44.060
 of the house you lose micro light and here 

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.220
 rubber on the bottom to favor 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.350
 the fixation fix all this rubber here 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:50.240
 to favor the subjection and prevent 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:52.100
 here the heat escapes us and 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.080
 keep much more in the armpits 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.500
 no special ventilation to fix 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:59.270
 all the same all this layer per text 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.500
 micro light also incorporates 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:01.760
 small squares in case we 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.970
 we hook up when we are running through 

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:07.070
 areas with trees with brambles does not break 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.380
 all the jacket and with a zipper 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.090
 central to play with the 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.850
 thermal capacity if we are in zones 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.470
 where it gets hot we go running 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.810
 in the morning and at noon he takes us in 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:19.400
 pieces with more heat we can open for 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.190
 favor the thermal capacity I teach you 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.210
 how it is inside to see you all worth 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.800
 these squares 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:33.030
 that is not island and inside is the alpha 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:35.610
 lapel interior large truck easy to 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.350
 maneuver with the logo of the house to fix 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.930
 the logo of the house here of rap workshop 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.960
 good and easy to maneuver does not stay 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.750
 still okay so we'll have to see 

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:47.850
 what happens when we run with him and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:49.290
 It incorporates hat to fix the hat that does not 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.040
 it is tight that closes us from 

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:54.540
 up here and it covers almost the entire 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.970
 mouth in here inside 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.720
 all this part very soft to avoid 

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:03.050
 chafing back 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:08.890
 As you can see cap is worth adjusted and that something 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:11.230
 red with this from here and inside incorporates 

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:16.000
 a little one to see you find it here 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:18.400
 it is worth fixing this tie is used to 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.650
 tie with this from here we are the hat 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:22.180
 agree why because it's a pledge 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.430
 thought to do physical activity and 

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:26.020
 when we are running the hat many 

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.060
 sometimes it will bounce if we do not have it 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.490
 use so we can roll it up and tie it 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:33.750
 with that little clip then in the part 

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:36.790
 central here rapp the logo of the house 

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.100
 reflective and next to fix a 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:42.400
 Zipper with a large pocket 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:44.020
 ability to set lady is not worth all this 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.970
 pocket where we can save bands 

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:47.110
 gloves when we are running in 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.450
 winter we can bring here all the 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.080
 things saved then two pockets 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.530
 also very large sides 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:58.230
 fix and on the two sides also 

00:03:55.530 --> 00:04:02.010
 a small carabiner to finish off 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.370
 adjust according to tell you that apart the 

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.000
 micro light 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.970
 the perfect micro light 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.310
 it is water repellent wind proof voucher 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:13.660
 fijaros'll show it is not 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:18.220
 impermeable but yes that if we are 

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:20.950
 running and there agrees we take water 

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.990
 it starts to snow we will be able to 

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.020
 Garment will protect us for a while 

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:27.880
 do not think that we are going is not a membrane 

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:30.850
 but it is simply repellent to 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.830
 water is also easily shareable 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:35.140
 I teach it also how can we 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:37.150
 compact it in the event that what 

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:39.529
 we carry in the backpack and use it alone 

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:44.449
 in high areas 

00:04:39.529 --> 00:04:47.809
 fix the alpha is badly done 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:49.789
 we have managed to compact enough 

00:04:47.809 --> 00:04:51.050
 well it's worth anyway a lump 

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:53.749
 considerable you have to take into account that 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:56.990
 it's a thermal garment so it's from 

00:04:53.749 --> 00:04:59.449
 difficult sometimes to compress and with a hat 

00:04:56.990 --> 00:05:02.240
 good and as always if not then we can 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:03.860
 do the waist and run with 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:06.559
 she tied to the waist this is the 

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.589
 rap proposal with polartec technology 

00:05:06.559 --> 00:05:11.569
 alpha the hyper text micro light rap 

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:14.889
 extra is hood and analyzed by train 

00:05:11.569 --> 00:05:14.889
 red dot com see you in the next
