when i get in the house i'm ready taking
off<00:04:18.410> so<00:04:18.709> i<00:04:18.919> think<00:04:19.489> i'm<00:04:19.880> a<00:04:19.970> switch<00:04:20.239> with

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:21.220

off so i think i'm a switch with
tomorrow<00:04:22.220> and<00:04:22.699> I'll<00:04:23.060> figure<00:04:23.810> out<00:04:23.960> something

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
tomorrow and I'll figure out something

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:25.659 
tomorrow and I'll figure out something
else<00:04:24.500> because<00:04:24.710> I<00:04:24.949> can't<00:04:25.190> take<00:04:25.400> it<00:04:25.430> with<00:04:25.610> them

00:04:25.659 --> 00:04:25.669

00:04:25.669 --> 00:04:27.700 
else because I can't take it with them
day<00:04:26.030> how<00:04:26.240> probably<00:04:26.660> more<00:04:27.169> than<00:04:27.320> likely<00:04:27.500> I

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:27.710 
day how probably more than likely I

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:32.920 
day how probably more than likely I
won't<00:04:27.919> be<00:04:28.130> wearing<00:04:28.250> this<00:04:28.490> and<00:04:28.669> I<00:04:28.789> normal<00:04:31.930> so
