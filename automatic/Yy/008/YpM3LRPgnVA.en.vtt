00:06:35.559 --> 00:06:35.569 
serves as an engine of change I think it

00:06:35.569 --> 00:06:37.749 
serves as an engine of change I think it
does<00:06:35.779> but<00:06:36.259> slowly<00:06:36.560> and<00:06:36.979> there's<00:06:37.430> some

00:06:37.749 --> 00:06:37.759 
does but slowly and there's some

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:40.149 
does but slowly and there's some
resistance<00:06:38.150> to<00:06:38.690> that<00:06:38.870> but<00:06:39.590> you<00:06:39.860> know<00:06:40.009> at

00:06:40.149 --> 00:06:40.159 
resistance to that but you know at

resistance to that but you know at

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:45.399 
ballroom openings we have ranchers come
we<00:06:42.740> have<00:06:42.949> a<00:06:43.190> really<00:06:43.969> diverse<00:06:44.270> crowd<00:06:44.870> come<00:06:45.259> in

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:47.649 
we have a really diverse crowd come in
and<00:06:45.680> so<00:06:45.830> I<00:06:45.860> think<00:06:46.250> just<00:06:46.940> by<00:06:47.089> the<00:06:47.150> nature<00:06:47.419> of

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:47.659 
and so I think just by the nature of

00:06:47.659 --> 00:06:49.059 
and so I think just by the nature of
being<00:06:47.839> here<00:06:48.110> you<00:06:48.229> start<00:06:48.529> to<00:06:48.560> change<00:06:48.860> the

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:49.069 
being here you start to change the

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:50.409 
being here you start to change the
