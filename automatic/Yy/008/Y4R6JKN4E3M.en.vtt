anymore<00:04:52.830> I<00:04:53.010> mean<00:04:53.280> it's<00:04:53.430> like<00:04:53.580> it's<00:04:54.030> a<00:04:54.120> good

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.330 
anymore I mean it's like it's a good

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:55.790 
anymore I mean it's like it's a good
game<00:04:54.540> and<00:04:54.600> I<00:04:54.870> think<00:04:55.080> I<00:04:55.139> was<00:04:55.290> probably<00:04:55.500> a<00:04:55.770> little

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
game and I think I was probably a little

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:58.700 
game and I think I was probably a little
hard<00:04:56.220> on<00:04:56.400> it<00:04:56.610> in<00:04:56.780> the<00:04:57.780> beginning<00:04:57.930> just<00:04:58.410> because

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
hard on it in the beginning just because

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:01.460 
hard on it in the beginning just because
it<00:04:58.830> was<00:04:58.949> so<00:04:59.190> frustrating<00:04:59.520> and<00:05:00.210> with<00:05:01.110> Team

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
it was so frustrating and with Team

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.710 
it was so frustrating and with Team
Deathmatch<00:05:01.680> and<00:05:02.250> I<00:05:02.520> think<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> spawns<00:05:03.479> for

00:05:03.710 --> 00:05:03.720 
Deathmatch and I think the spawns for

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.900 
Deathmatch and I think the spawns for
death<00:05:04.139> match<00:05:04.440> obviously<00:05:05.340> I<00:05:05.370> mean<00:05:05.760> they<00:05:05.850> were

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
death match obviously I mean they were

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.710 
death match obviously I mean they were
patched<00:05:06.210> but<00:05:06.600> for<00:05:07.199> death<00:05:07.350> match<00:05:07.590> itself<00:05:08.720> they

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:09.720 
patched but for death match itself they

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.330 
patched but for death match itself they
seemed<00:05:09.960> to<00:05:09.990> help<00:05:10.229> the<00:05:10.410> game<00:05:10.620> go<00:05:10.979> a<00:05:11.010> little

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:11.340 
seemed to help the game go a little

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.460 
seemed to help the game go a little
smoother<00:05:11.970> a<00:05:13.010> lot<00:05:14.010> and<00:05:15.169> you<00:05:16.169> know<00:05:16.289> that's
