00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
we've seen that a sous tiny laptop

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.240 
we've seen that a sous tiny laptop
computer<00:00:03.419> but<00:00:03.750> now<00:00:04.049> we<00:00:04.110> get<00:00:04.470> to<00:00:04.560> see<00:00:04.710> the<00:00:04.890> dell

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:08.189 
tiny laptop computer Gary so what's the

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.089 
tiny laptop computer Gary so what's the
difference<00:00:08.309> what<00:00:08.700> we<00:00:08.820> have<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.920> this<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.070> the

difference what we have here this is the

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.280 
difference what we have here this is the
asaurus<00:00:11.519> the<00:00:11.700> white<00:00:11.880> one<00:00:12.120> this<00:00:12.990> is<00:00:13.170> the

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:13.290 
asaurus the white one this is the

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.279 
asaurus the white one this is the
brand-new<00:00:13.469> dell<00:00:14.070> inspiron<00:00:14.849> mini<00:00:15.299> nine<00:00:15.839> and

brand-new dell inspiron mini nine and

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:19.359 
brand-new dell inspiron mini nine and
it's<00:00:17.250> taken<00:00:17.580> them<00:00:17.670> a<00:00:17.730> while<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.000> get<00:00:18.810> it<00:00:18.869> out

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
it's taken them a while to get it out

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.950 
it's taken them a while to get it out
out<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.640> public<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.240> it<00:00:21.390> is<00:00:21.510> out<00:00:21.660> in<00:00:21.779> time

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:25.980 
really a nice machine it's better than

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.830 
really a nice machine it's better than
all<00:00:26.160> the<00:00:26.310> other<00:00:26.490> wannabes<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:27.420> I've<00:00:27.570> played

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
all the other wannabes that I've played

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.960 
all the other wannabes that I've played
with<00:00:28.109> for<00:00:28.710> this<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:29.010> better<00:00:29.220> than<00:00:29.400> the<00:00:29.460> Intel

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
with for this it's better than the Intel

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:32.420 
with for this it's better than the Intel
version<00:00:30.840> it's<00:00:31.230> much<00:00:31.470> better<00:00:31.679> than<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:31.949> HP

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
version it's much better than the HP

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.049 
version it's much better than the HP
which<00:00:32.669> seemed<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.059> be<00:00:33.180> very<00:00:33.210> slow<00:00:33.750> and<00:00:34.489> just<00:00:35.489> it

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
which seemed to be very slow and just it

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.160 
which seemed to be very slow and just it
the<00:00:36.840> HP<00:00:37.440> didn't<00:00:37.829> make<00:00:38.010> it<00:00:38.040> although<00:00:39.020> it's<00:00:40.020> a

on<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.570> computer<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.290> is<00:01:16.400> absolutely<00:01:17.400> wonderful

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
on a computer it is absolutely wonderful

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.280 
on a computer it is absolutely wonderful
and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.570> makes<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:20.009> laptop

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290 
and it makes this this little laptop

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.870 
and it makes this this little laptop
lightning<00:01:22.290> fast<00:01:22.560> especially<00:01:23.100> with<00:01:23.430> the<00:01:23.520> intel

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
lightning fast especially with the intel

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.670 
lightning fast especially with the intel
atom<00:01:24.090> processor<00:01:24.270> which<00:01:24.990> isn't<00:01:25.290> the<00:01:25.350> fastest

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
atom processor which isn't the fastest

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:29.149 
atom processor which isn't the fastest
thing<00:01:25.799> in<00:01:25.830> the<00:01:25.950> world<00:01:26.450> this<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.740> these<00:01:28.740> are

thing in the world this is these are

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.819 
thing in the world this is these are
really<00:01:29.520> great<00:01:29.790> computers<00:01:30.360> both<00:01:30.689> of<00:01:30.900> them<00:01:31.079> a

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
they see something in here that there'll

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.450 
they see something in here that there'll
be<00:01:36.090> new<00:01:36.450> models<00:01:36.840> what<00:01:37.439> time<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.009> there'll

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
be new models what time is it there'll

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.980 
be new models what time is it there'll
be<00:01:38.490> a<00:01:38.579> new<00:01:38.759> model<00:01:39.119> there'll<00:01:39.360> be<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.479> new<00:01:39.659> model

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
be a new model there'll be a new model

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.859 
be a new model there'll be a new model
right<00:01:40.110> away<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:42.119> biggest<00:01:42.329> difference<00:01:42.479> the

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
right away the biggest difference the

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.469 
right away the biggest difference the
lenox<00:01:43.399> well<00:01:44.399> you<00:01:44.640> can<00:01:44.790> get<00:01:44.939> this<00:01:45.090> you<00:01:45.240> can<00:01:45.360> get

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
lenox well you can get this you can get

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.910 
lenox well you can get this you can get
both<00:01:45.600> of<00:01:45.780> them<00:01:45.869> with<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.200> extra<00:01:46.470> here<00:01:46.680> both

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
both of them with one extra here both

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.050 
both of them with one extra here both
with<00:01:47.130> Windows<00:01:47.520> x.x<00:01:48.119> okay<00:01:48.560> I'm<00:01:49.560> sure<00:01:49.890> that<00:01:50.100> as

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
with Windows x.x okay I'm sure that as

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.880 
with Windows x.x okay I'm sure that as
