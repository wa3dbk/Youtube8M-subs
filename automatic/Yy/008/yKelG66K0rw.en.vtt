00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.059
 today we return here to our piece 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.670
 preferred of the river the technical section of 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.560
 the boxing night of marcatv with that 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.840
 let's go today after having been 

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.850
 two weeks hitting us in the body and 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:20.130
 descending we are going to leave a 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.170
 little liposuction to knuckle and we 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.410
 let's go with combined defenses that 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.270
 I mean with combined defense is the 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.980
 union of two defenses because because 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.260
 normally people do not throw you just a 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.270
 hit us throw two three or four hits 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.909
 about that we're going to look for the defense 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.579
 of two strokes for that we will work 

00:00:35.909 --> 00:00:40.579
 what we call the combined defense 

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:49.230
 first blocking and avoiding blocking your 

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:52.560
 brooch or straight right continuing 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.810
 with the horse or crossbow to avoid 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.760
 impossible left hand blow the 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:58.270
 blocking as we work in the season 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.970
 previous 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:06.400
 we look for a bit of the rival's blow as 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:09.430
 shortening it would be very interesting if we 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.160
 give time to move your foot a little 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:15.460
 the second time comes second 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.850
 defense horse or crossbow in this 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:21.250
 defensive system weighbridge we throw the 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.670
 weight back and as in the previous defense 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:27.220
 Above all we avoid that we get the 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.090
 weight of the center of the box 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:35.140
 Support of our feet 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:37.810
 we see the right snap we block and 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:40.960
 we take a horse or crossbow 

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:42.520
 we passed the left crochet of the 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.070
 rival well and now we see how 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:47.759
 we develop this technique at school 

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:51.600
 typical combat and we are increasing 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.600
 speed 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.189
 well it's already here I think it's been 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.219
 very clear what a defense is 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:03.310
 combined let's start a cycle on 

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:05.200
 combined defense varying the all type 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.689
 of defensive system but we will continue 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.729
 little by little slowly so we can go 

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:13.420
 learning here at boxing school 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.610
 boxing little by little the week that 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:17.620
 come we're going to come back with some defenses 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.870
 that we left in the ink and that 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.319
 you have claimed us through 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.860
 of the network the defenses the deviations of 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:29.380
 the direct ones to the body diverting and their 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.450
 possible contras that we will touch it here 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.840
 within seven days at night in the 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.680
 boxing 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.680
 marcatv
