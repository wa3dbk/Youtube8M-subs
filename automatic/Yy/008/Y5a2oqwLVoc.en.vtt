00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.229 
the back to bolts pretty much um that's
just<00:00:37.680> so<00:00:37.829> it<00:00:37.980> doesn't<00:00:38.340> slip<00:00:38.579> off<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.790> end<00:00:39.090> if

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239 
just so it doesn't slip off the end if

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:40.490 
just so it doesn't slip off the end if
you<00:00:39.270> want<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.570> keep<00:00:39.690> your<00:00:39.809> back<00:00:39.989> foot<00:00:40.260> on<00:00:40.440> the

you want to keep your back foot on the

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.010 
you want to keep your back foot on the
tail<00:00:40.770> throughout<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.489> entire<00:00:41.760> trick<00:00:42.059> your

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020 
tail throughout the entire trick your

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.069 
tail throughout the entire trick your
front<00:00:43.260> foot<00:00:43.469> should<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> hanging<00:00:44.760> off<00:00:45.079> like

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
front foot should be hanging off like

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.090 
front foot should be hanging off like
that<00:00:46.379> so<00:00:46.829> it<00:00:46.890> can<00:00:47.039> easily<00:00:47.190> slip<00:00:47.550> off<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:47.879> board

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
that so it can easily slip off the board

00:00:49.100 --> 00:01:06.980 
that so it can easily slip off the board
so<00:00:54.170> you're<00:00:55.170> gonna<00:00:55.260> catch<00:00:55.590> down<00:01:05.060> steps<00:01:06.060> you<00:01:06.840> do

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
so you're gonna catch down steps you do

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.429 
so you're gonna catch down steps you do
that

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
that

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.260

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
going to do you slide your front foot

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.920 
going to do you slide your front foot
off<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.430> board<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.000> plant<00:01:18.360> it<00:01:18.509> on<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.720> ground

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
off the board and plant it on the ground

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.800 
off the board and plant it on the ground
um<00:01:20.330> I'll<00:01:21.330> give<00:01:21.540> you<00:01:21.659> a<00:01:21.720> better<00:01:21.900> view<00:01:22.560> of<00:01:22.590> this

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:23.810 
um I'll give you a better view of this

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:31.910 
um I'll give you a better view of this
so<00:01:26.299> your<00:01:27.299> front<00:01:27.659> foot<00:01:28.640> is<00:01:29.640> right<00:01:30.000> there<00:01:30.920> back

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
so your front foot is right there back

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.069 
so your front foot is right there back
foot<00:01:32.240> right<00:01:33.240> there<00:01:34.549> squarely<00:01:35.549> on<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.880> tail

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:36.079 
foot right there squarely on the tail

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:41.660 
foot right there squarely on the tail
then<00:01:37.079> you're<00:01:37.259> gonna<00:01:37.880> grab<00:01:38.880> the<00:01:39.450> board<00:01:40.460> got<00:01:41.460> the

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
then you're gonna grab the board got the

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.460 
then you're gonna grab the board got the
would<00:01:41.850> step<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:42.689> foot<00:01:42.990> now<00:01:43.710> um<00:01:44.369> unlike<00:01:45.090> the

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470 
would step on foot now um unlike the

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:48.249 
would step on foot now um unlike the
boneless<00:01:46.470> there's<00:01:47.430> like<00:01:47.579> a<00:01:47.700> little

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
boneless there's like a little

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:50.149 
boneless there's like a little
difference<00:01:49.259> with<00:01:49.470> how<00:01:49.560> you<00:01:49.619> step<00:01:49.890> off<00:01:49.979> your

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
difference with how you step off your

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:50.749 
difference with how you step off your
foot

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759 
foot

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.630 
foot
it<00:01:51.509> works<00:01:51.840> either<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.229> but<00:01:52.439> I<00:01:52.979> find<00:01:53.399> that<00:01:53.490> it

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
it works either way but I find that it

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.609 
it works either way but I find that it
helps<00:01:53.820> if<00:01:54.390> you<00:01:54.450> step<00:01:54.750> your<00:01:54.840> pump<00:01:55.049> foot<00:01:55.229> off<00:01:55.380> at

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
helps if you step your pump foot off at

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.190 
helps if you step your pump foot off at
an<00:01:55.740> angle<00:01:55.829> like<00:01:56.280> that<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:57.509> gets<00:01:57.719> you<00:01:57.960> all<00:01:58.170> the

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
an angle like that it gets you all the

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.550 
an angle like that it gets you all the
way<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:59.159> you<00:01:59.310> like<00:01:59.460> already<00:02:00.090> rotating<00:02:00.750> so

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
way get you like already rotating so

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.700 
way get you like already rotating so
like<00:02:01.829> when<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.070> spin<00:02:02.369> you<00:02:02.579> have<00:02:02.729> less

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
like when you spin you have less

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.560 
like when you spin you have less
rotation<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:04.829> do<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:05.670> if<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.060> step<00:02:06.299> off<00:02:06.420> like

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
rotation to do so if you step off like

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.109 
rotation to do so if you step off like
that<00:02:06.780> an<00:02:07.250> angle<00:02:08.250> like<00:02:08.399> that<00:02:08.459> helps<00:02:08.940> a<00:02:09.000> lot

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that an angle like that helps a lot

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.220 
that an angle like that helps a lot
instead<00:02:09.479> of<00:02:09.660> just<00:02:09.840> stepping<00:02:10.050> off<00:02:10.259> like<00:02:10.440> that

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
instead of just stepping off like that

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.770 
instead of just stepping off like that
so<00:02:11.860> step<00:02:12.280> off<00:02:12.430> with<00:02:12.670> that<00:02:12.879> um<00:02:14.879> so<00:02:15.879> you<00:02:16.420> step<00:02:16.629> off

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
so step off with that um so you step off

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:17.970 
so step off with that um so you step off
with<00:02:16.930> that<00:02:17.080> you're<00:02:17.319> grabbing<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.709> board

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
with that you're grabbing the board

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.540 
with that you're grabbing the board
you're<00:02:18.879> going<00:02:18.910> to<00:02:19.420> spin<00:02:21.000> with<00:02:22.000> it<00:02:22.980> and<00:02:23.980> then

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
you're going to spin with it and then

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:26.900 
you're going to spin with it and then
keep<00:02:24.940> your<00:02:25.090> back<00:02:25.269> foot<00:02:25.569> on<00:02:25.810> the<00:02:26.140> entire<00:02:26.440> time

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
keep your back foot on the entire time

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:29.070 
keep your back foot on the entire time
that's<00:02:27.910> really<00:02:28.209> important<00:02:28.660> you<00:02:28.720> want<00:02:28.900> to<00:02:28.959> keep

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
that's really important you want to keep

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.160 
that's really important you want to keep
your<00:02:29.230> back<00:02:29.410> foot<00:02:30.060> glued<00:02:31.060> to<00:02:31.269> the<00:02:31.420> tail<00:02:31.630> pretty

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:32.170 
your back foot glued to the tail pretty

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.630 
your back foot glued to the tail pretty
much<00:02:32.319> the<00:02:32.530> entire<00:02:32.769> time<00:02:32.800> just<00:02:33.130> imagine<00:02:33.550> your

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
much the entire time just imagine your

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.059 
much the entire time just imagine your
back<00:02:33.760> foot<00:02:34.000> stuck<00:02:34.360> there<00:02:34.599> if<00:02:35.349> it<00:02:35.590> goes<00:02:35.830> off<00:02:36.040> to

00:02:36.059 --> 00:02:36.069 
back foot stuck there if it goes off to

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:38.339 
back foot stuck there if it goes off to
board<00:02:36.519> my<00:02:36.640> flip<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.660> they<00:02:37.930> don't<00:02:38.110> look<00:02:38.170> this

00:02:38.339 --> 00:02:38.349 
board my flip and they don't look this

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:38.610 
board my flip and they don't look this
good

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
good

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.750 
good
um<00:02:42.810> yeah<00:02:43.810> that<00:02:44.140> the<00:02:44.500> boneless<00:02:44.709> 180<00:02:45.250> it's<00:02:45.459> a

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:45.760 
um yeah that the boneless 180 it's a

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:46.830 
um yeah that the boneless 180 it's a
pretty<00:02:46.030> simple<00:02:46.239> trick

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
pretty simple trick

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:51.539 
pretty simple trick
um<00:02:47.790> there's<00:02:48.790> not<00:02:48.970> a<00:02:49.329> whole<00:02:49.569> lot<00:02:49.810> that<00:02:50.549> you

00:02:51.539 --> 00:02:51.549 
um there's not a whole lot that you

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:57.089 
um there's not a whole lot that you
really<00:02:51.849> need<00:02:52.030> to<00:02:52.239> do<00:02:52.900> to<00:02:54.959> plan<00:02:55.959> this<00:02:56.170> check<00:02:56.410> you

00:02:57.089 --> 00:02:57.099 
really need to do to plan this check you

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.280 
really need to do to plan this check you
just<00:02:57.130> pretty<00:02:58.030> much<00:02:58.209> do<00:02:58.540> a<00:02:58.569> regular<00:02:58.840> boneless

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
just pretty much do a regular boneless

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.350 
just pretty much do a regular boneless
except<00:02:59.890> step<00:03:00.130> off<00:03:00.340> and<00:03:00.640> I'm<00:03:00.700> good<00:03:00.910> at<00:03:01.090> more<00:03:01.329> of

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:01.360 
except step off and I'm good at more of

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:03.920 
except step off and I'm good at more of
an<00:03:01.540> angle<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.140> then<00:03:02.709> spin<00:03:03.099> your<00:03:03.250> upper<00:03:03.459> body

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
an angle and then spin your upper body

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.080 
an angle and then spin your upper body
with<00:03:04.930> the<00:03:05.049> board<00:03:05.349> and<00:03:06.220> then<00:03:06.340> jump<00:03:06.640> back<00:03:06.819> on

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
with the board and then jump back on

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:12.180 
with the board and then jump back on
once<00:03:07.450> you<00:03:07.599> reach<00:03:09.000> 180<00:03:10.000> degrees<00:03:10.450> so<00:03:11.010> like<00:03:12.010> this

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
once you reach 180 degrees so like this

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:33.539 
once you reach 180 degrees so like this
time<00:03:28.049> um<00:03:29.760> is<00:03:30.760> not<00:03:31.500> like<00:03:32.500> that<00:03:33.040> many<00:03:33.190> problems

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:33.549 
time um is not like that many problems

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:36.530 
time um is not like that many problems
you<00:03:34.090> can<00:03:34.420> have<00:03:34.569> with<00:03:34.750> boneless<00:03:34.959> checks<00:03:35.380> but<00:03:35.620> a

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
you can have with boneless checks but a

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.590 
you can have with boneless checks but a
few<00:03:37.540> things<00:03:37.780> that<00:03:38.019> may<00:03:38.200> happen<00:03:38.620> wrong<00:03:39.069> is<00:03:39.280> that

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:39.600 
few things that may happen wrong is that

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.890 
few things that may happen wrong is that
um<00:03:40.600> you<00:03:41.220> might<00:03:42.220> under<00:03:42.609> rotate<00:03:43.000> and<00:03:43.480> if<00:03:43.750> that's

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
um you might under rotate and if that's

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.110 
um you might under rotate and if that's
the<00:03:44.049> case<00:03:44.109> just<00:03:45.040> step<00:03:45.250> your<00:03:45.280> front<00:03:45.670> foot<00:03:45.850> off

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:46.120 
the case just step your front foot off

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.770 
the case just step your front foot off
at<00:03:46.420> more<00:03:46.630> of<00:03:46.660> an<00:03:46.810> angle<00:03:47.370> so<00:03:48.370> um

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
at more of an angle so um

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.470 
at more of an angle so um
that<00:03:50.170> should<00:03:50.350> help<00:03:50.470> you<00:03:50.620> all<00:03:51.430> the<00:03:51.730> way<00:03:51.850> like

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:52.480 
that should help you all the way like

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:56.430 
that should help you all the way like
rotate<00:03:52.870> all<00:03:52.989> the<00:03:53.019> way<00:03:53.139> around<00:03:53.910> and<00:03:54.989> you<00:03:55.989> can

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
rotate all the way around and you can

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:58.199 
rotate all the way around and you can
you<00:03:56.739> guys<00:03:56.920> can<00:03:57.130> like<00:03:57.340> spin<00:03:57.700> on<00:03:57.880> your<00:03:58.030> front

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
you guys can like spin on your front

00:03:58.209 --> 00:04:00.870 
you guys can like spin on your front
foot<00:03:58.389> slightly<00:03:58.630> before<00:03:58.930> you<00:03:59.260> jump<00:03:59.700> you<00:04:00.700> don't

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:00.880 
foot slightly before you jump you don't

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.400 
foot slightly before you jump you don't
have<00:04:00.970> to<00:04:01.060> jump<00:04:01.239> right<00:04:01.450> off<00:04:01.510> our<00:04:01.900> way<00:04:02.079> that'll

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
have to jump right off our way that'll

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.170 
have to jump right off our way that'll
help<00:04:02.530> you<00:04:02.709> spend<00:04:02.980> more<00:04:03.160> and<00:04:04.799> you<00:04:05.799> may<00:04:05.980> be<00:04:06.430> over

help you spend more and you may be over

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:09.990 
help you spend more and you may be over
rotating<00:04:07.780> if<00:04:08.019> that's<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.470> case<00:04:08.650> just<00:04:09.010> so<00:04:09.790> do

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.000 
rotating if that's the case just so do

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.720 
rotating if that's the case just so do
the<00:04:10.120> opposite<00:04:10.599> of<00:04:10.810> the<00:04:11.290> other<00:04:11.829> problem<00:04:12.430> just

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:12.730 
the opposite of the other problem just

00:04:12.730 --> 00:04:15.030 
the opposite of the other problem just
maybe<00:04:13.419> put<00:04:13.780> your<00:04:13.930> front<00:04:14.169> foot<00:04:14.349> off<00:04:14.500> at<00:04:14.709> less<00:04:14.889> of

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:15.040 
maybe put your front foot off at less of

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.289 
maybe put your front foot off at less of
an<00:04:15.130> angle<00:04:15.280> and<00:04:17.099> just<00:04:18.099> don't<00:04:18.370> spin<00:04:18.700> as<00:04:18.849> much<00:04:19.030> on

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:19.299 
an angle and just don't spin as much on

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:21.120 
an angle and just don't spin as much on
your<00:04:19.479> front<00:04:19.659> foot<00:04:19.840> before<00:04:20.049> you<00:04:20.260> jump<00:04:20.620> on<00:04:20.829> and

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.130 
your front foot before you jump on and

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.580 
your front foot before you jump on and
just<00:04:21.789> sort<00:04:22.030> of<00:04:22.060> Twister<00:04:22.419> Scholz<00:04:22.659> up

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:23.590 
just sort of Twister Scholz up

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:27.870 
just sort of Twister Scholz up
and<00:04:23.830> then<00:04:23.919> jump<00:04:24.190> on<00:04:24.310> um<00:04:26.220> one<00:04:27.220> final<00:04:27.520> problem<00:04:27.639> I

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:27.880 
and then jump on um one final problem I

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.580 
and then jump on um one final problem I
can<00:04:28.030> think<00:04:28.150> of<00:04:28.300> is<00:04:28.389> that<00:04:28.419> when<00:04:28.690> you<00:04:28.780> pop<00:04:29.020> the

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:29.590 
can think of is that when you pop the

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.270 
can think of is that when you pop the
board<00:04:29.830> goes<00:04:30.610> at<00:04:30.820> an<00:04:30.910> angle<00:04:31.270> and<00:04:31.620> like<00:04:32.620> sort<00:04:33.250> of

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:33.280 
board goes at an angle and like sort of

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.610 
board goes at an angle and like sort of
hits<00:04:33.460> you<00:04:33.610> in<00:04:33.700> the<00:04:33.730> shin<00:04:33.970> and<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.510> that's<00:04:35.500> a

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:35.620 
hits you in the shin and that that's a

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:37.530 
hits you in the shin and that that's a
problem<00:04:35.800> just<00:04:36.280> grab<00:04:36.610> your<00:04:37.030> board<00:04:37.300> make<00:04:37.510> sure

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:37.540 
problem just grab your board make sure

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:40.170 
problem just grab your board make sure
you're<00:04:37.750> holding<00:04:37.930> it<00:04:38.230> in<00:04:38.320> place<00:04:38.620> and<00:04:38.970> kick<00:04:39.970> your

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:40.180 
you're holding it in place and kick your

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:44.159 
you're holding it in place and kick your
front<00:04:40.600> foot<00:04:41.500> out<00:04:41.770> more<00:04:42.160> like<00:04:42.700> when<00:04:43.630> you<00:04:43.810> pop

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:44.169 
front foot out more like when you pop

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:46.890 
front foot out more like when you pop
down<00:04:44.410> pivot<00:04:44.860> it<00:04:45.070> out<00:04:45.250> more<00:04:45.490> I'm<00:04:46.090> here<00:04:46.810> I'll

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
down pivot it out more I'm here I'll

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.340 
down pivot it out more I'm here I'll
show<00:04:47.050> you<00:04:47.080> what<00:04:47.290> I<00:04:47.320> mean<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:48.780> like<00:04:49.780> when<00:04:50.050> you<00:04:50.139> go

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:50.350 
show you what I mean so like when you go

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:55.140 
show you what I mean so like when you go
around<00:04:52.650> when<00:04:53.650> you<00:04:53.770> go<00:04:53.919> like<00:04:54.040> this<00:04:54.070> just<00:04:54.730> check

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:55.150 
around when you go like this just check

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:57.659 
around when you go like this just check
it<00:04:55.270> out<00:04:55.360> more<00:04:55.630> like<00:04:55.840> that<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:57.130> get<00:04:57.310> it<00:04:57.430> out<00:04:57.520> of

00:04:57.659 --> 00:04:57.669 
it out more like that to get it out of

00:04:57.669 --> 00:05:03.629 
it out more like that to get it out of
the<00:04:57.729> way<00:04:57.850> more<00:04:58.150> instead<00:04:58.660> of<00:05:02.130> and<00:05:03.130> then<00:05:03.280> jumping

00:05:03.629 --> 00:05:03.639 
the way more instead of and then jumping

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:08.400 
the way more instead of and then jumping
forwards<00:05:04.030> onto<00:05:04.389> it<00:05:04.510> so<00:05:06.960> that<00:05:07.960> was<00:05:08.050> my<00:05:08.139> tutorial

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:08.410 
forwards onto it so that was my tutorial
