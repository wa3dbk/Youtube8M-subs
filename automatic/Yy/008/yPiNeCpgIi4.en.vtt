00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:42.989 
masculine on my electrical tape and it

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:45.290 
masculine on my electrical tape and it
was<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.290> kind<00:00:43.440> of<00:00:43.559> grippy<00:00:43.950> know<00:00:44.610> I<00:00:44.820> deliver

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
was I kind of grippy know I deliver

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.619 
was I kind of grippy know I deliver
grippy<00:00:45.570> feel<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.620> then<00:00:46.800> I<00:00:46.829> put<00:00:46.920> one<00:00:47.370> sheet<00:00:47.629> on

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
grippy feel so then I put one sheet on

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.970 
grippy feel so then I put one sheet on
here<00:00:49.379> and<00:00:50.149> then<00:00:51.149> it<00:00:51.600> wasn't<00:00:51.840> thick<00:00:52.469> enough<00:00:52.500> are

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
here and then it wasn't thick enough are

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.000 
here and then it wasn't thick enough are
long<00:00:53.250> enough<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:54.270> I<00:00:54.300> added<00:00:54.809> another<00:00:55.050> couple<00:00:55.800> I

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
long enough so I added another couple I

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:57.979 
long enough so I added another couple I
kept<00:00:56.640> adding<00:00:56.879> and<00:00:57.210> writing<00:00:57.480> them<00:00:57.570> so<00:00:57.750> I'd<00:00:57.840> be

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
kept adding and writing them so I'd be

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.459 
kept adding and writing them so I'd be
like<00:00:58.020> thickness<00:00:58.590> of<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:58.829> tape<00:00:59.899> in<00:01:00.899> what<00:01:01.140> you

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:02.630 
like thickness of the tape in what you
could<00:01:01.620> do<00:01:01.739> is<00:01:01.920> you<00:01:02.100> could<00:01:02.190> fold<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.550> over
