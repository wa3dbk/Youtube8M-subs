00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:44.590 
on a finger we'll see if that changes

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:50.490 
on a finger we'll see if that changes
with<00:00:45.220> this<00:00:45.460> hitting<00:00:46.000> up<00:00:46.180> the<00:00:46.270> hammer<00:00:48.059> and<00:00:49.500> here

00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:08.170 
hitting this hammer and as you can see

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.029 
hitting this hammer and as you can see
the<00:01:08.979> ring<00:01:09.310> the<00:01:09.759> white<00:01:10.030> gold<00:01:10.390> ring<00:01:10.630> is

00:01:11.029 --> 00:01:11.039 
the ring the white gold ring is

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:15.600 
the ring the white gold ring is
significantly<00:01:12.720> damaged<00:01:13.720> it's<00:01:14.710> gone<00:01:15.369> from

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
significantly damaged it's gone from

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.060 
significantly damaged it's gone from
being<00:01:15.789> circular<00:01:16.390> to<00:01:16.660> more<00:01:17.200> of<00:01:17.320> an<00:01:17.410> oval<00:01:17.740> egg

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
being circular to more of an oval egg

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.910 
being circular to more of an oval egg
shape<00:01:18.430> and<00:01:19.050> would<00:01:20.050> probably<00:01:20.410> be<00:01:20.500> extremely

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
shape and would probably be extremely

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.550 
shape and would probably be extremely
tough<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.250> wear<00:01:21.750> on<00:01:22.750> the<00:01:22.930> finger<00:01:23.200> that<00:01:23.320> it<00:01:23.440> was

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
tough to wear on the finger that it was

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.779 
tough to wear on the finger that it was
chosen<00:01:23.830> for<00:01:24.190> so<00:01:25.830> this<00:01:26.830> again<00:01:27.190> is<00:01:27.250> the<00:01:27.610> white

00:01:27.779 --> 00:01:27.789 
chosen for so this again is the white

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.770 
chosen for so this again is the white
gold<00:01:28.030> ring<00:01:28.530> hammer<00:01:29.530> test<00:01:29.950> and<00:01:30.479> we<00:01:31.479> are<00:01:31.600> going

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:31.780 
gold ring hammer test and we are going

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:37.080 
gold ring hammer test and we are going
to<00:01:32.039> move<00:01:33.039> on<00:01:33.190> down<00:01:33.220> the<00:01:33.429> line

alright again we're going to continue on
with<00:01:40.180> a<00:01:40.360> hammer<00:01:40.600> test<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:42.040> time<00:01:42.340> we<00:01:42.729> are

a hammer the pressure applied to the
hammer<00:02:07.540> it<00:02:07.899> was<00:02:08.110> hopefully<00:02:08.800> you<00:02:08.920> can<00:02:09.039> see<00:02:09.250> that

on<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.729> video<00:02:09.970> it<00:02:10.209> wasn't<00:02:10.630> extremely<00:02:10.989> hard

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
on the video it wasn't extremely hard

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.290 
on the video it wasn't extremely hard
not<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> lot<00:02:11.800> of<00:02:11.830> pressure<00:02:12.130> not<00:02:12.430> a<00:02:12.489> lot<00:02:12.640> of<00:02:12.790> power

00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:16.269 
put into the hammer and taking a look at

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.420 
put into the hammer and taking a look at
the<00:02:16.330> ring<00:02:16.480> it<00:02:16.600> is<00:02:16.720> now<00:02:16.959> significantly<00:02:17.620> damaged

the ring it is now significantly damaged

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:22.050 
the ring it is now significantly damaged
but<00:02:19.030> it's<00:02:19.930> definitely<00:02:20.110> ruined<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.040> ring<00:02:21.340> and

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
but it's definitely ruined the ring and

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:23.790 
but it's definitely ruined the ring and
now<00:02:22.209> will<00:02:22.390> no<00:02:22.540> longer<00:02:22.720> be<00:02:22.930> circular<00:02:23.530> like<00:02:23.680> it

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:23.800 
now will no longer be circular like it

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:25.220 
now will no longer be circular like it
once<00:02:23.980> was

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
once was

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.530 
once was
and<00:02:26.400> now<00:02:27.400> we're<00:02:27.610> going<00:02:27.790> to<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> moving<00:02:28.269> to<00:02:28.450> the

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:28.540 
and now we're going to the moving to the

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:34.040 
and now we're going to the moving to the
titanium<00:02:28.900> ring<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:31.150> ring<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:32.640> wider

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050 
titanium ring this ring is wider

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:36.780 
titanium ring this ring is wider
stronger<00:02:35.050> than<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.319> previous<00:02:35.709> two<00:02:35.920> rings<00:02:36.160> so

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
stronger than the previous two rings so

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.610 
stronger than the previous two rings so
there'll<00:02:36.970> be<00:02:37.000> a<00:02:37.090> little<00:02:37.269> bit<00:02:37.450> more<00:02:37.630> pressure

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:38.620 
there'll be a little bit more pressure

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.900 
there'll be a little bit more pressure
applied<00:02:38.980> with<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:39.340> hammer<00:02:39.580> a<00:02:39.670> little<00:02:39.819> bit

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
applied with the hammer a little bit

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.240 
applied with the hammer a little bit
more<00:02:40.060> power<00:02:40.680> to<00:02:41.680> see<00:02:41.829> if<00:02:41.950> we<00:02:42.640> caused<00:02:42.880> any<00:02:44.250> marks

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
more power to see if we caused any marks

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.810 
more power to see if we caused any marks
or<00:02:45.459> any<00:02:45.940> damage<00:02:46.329> to<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.570> ring<00:02:46.750> and<00:02:47.610> once<00:02:48.610> again

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
or any damage to the ring and once again

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.229 
or any damage to the ring and once again
this<00:02:49.150> is<00:02:49.299> titanium<00:02:49.780> and<00:02:50.230> as<00:02:50.739> you<00:02:50.829> can<00:02:50.950> see<00:02:51.239> from

00:02:52.229 --> 00:02:52.239 
this is titanium and as you can see from

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:00.030 
this is titanium and as you can see from
this<00:02:52.390> angle<00:02:52.870> that<00:02:53.019> it's<00:02:53.640> circular<00:02:58.920> all<00:02:59.920> right

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
this angle that it's circular all right

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.640 
this angle that it's circular all right
I<00:03:00.310> only<00:03:00.790> did<00:03:00.970> three<00:03:01.209> hits<00:03:01.510> there<00:03:02.290> was<00:03:02.410> more

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:02.650 
I only did three hits there was more

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:04.530 
I only did three hits there was more
power<00:03:02.920> increased<00:03:03.610> on<00:03:03.790> the<00:03:03.880> hammer<00:03:04.060> because

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
power increased on the hammer because

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.940 
power increased on the hammer because
it's<00:03:04.690> a<00:03:04.780> tougher<00:03:05.140> ring<00:03:05.350> but<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:07.269> you<00:03:07.600> can<00:03:07.720> see

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:07.950 
it's a tougher ring but as you can see

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:12.170 
it's a tougher ring but as you can see
the<00:03:08.950> ring<00:03:09.190> has<00:03:09.400> definitely<00:03:10.209> been<00:03:10.769> the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the ring has definitely been the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.390 
the ring has definitely been the
circular<00:03:13.180> ring<00:03:13.690> is<00:03:13.900> now<00:03:14.049> again<00:03:14.739> more<00:03:15.010> oval

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:15.400 
circular ring is now again more oval

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.390 
circular ring is now again more oval
more<00:03:15.790> egg-shaped<00:03:16.420> and<00:03:17.350> so<00:03:17.680> that's<00:03:17.950> that<00:03:18.220> we're

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
more egg-shaped and so that's that we're

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.869 
more egg-shaped and so that's that we're
going<00:03:18.489> to<00:03:18.549> move<00:03:18.700> on

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
going to move on

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.509 
going to move on
okay<00:03:21.749> now<00:03:22.230> with<00:03:22.439> the<00:03:22.530> past<00:03:22.769> three<00:03:23.069> rings<00:03:23.310> we

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
okay now with the past three rings we

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.649 
okay now with the past three rings we
did<00:03:23.700> white<00:03:24.359> gold<00:03:24.659> platinum<00:03:25.430> titanium<00:03:26.430> all<00:03:27.209> of

00:03:27.649 --> 00:03:27.659 
did white gold platinum titanium all of

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:29.780 
did white gold platinum titanium all of
them<00:03:27.749> have<00:03:27.900> gone<00:03:28.049> for<00:03:28.319> being<00:03:28.499> circles<00:03:29.040> to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790 
them have gone for being circles to

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.509 
them have gone for being circles to
being<00:03:30.389> oval-shaped<00:03:30.980> basically<00:03:31.980> ruining<00:03:32.370> the

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:32.519 
being oval-shaped basically ruining the

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:35.330 
being oval-shaped basically ruining the
ring<00:03:33.170> we'll<00:03:34.170> see<00:03:34.379> if<00:03:34.469> this<00:03:34.590> happens<00:03:35.010> with<00:03:35.249> the

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340 
ring we'll see if this happens with the

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.349 
ring we'll see if this happens with the
tungsten<00:03:35.609> ring<00:03:36.030> tungsten<00:03:36.780> is<00:03:36.900> up<00:03:37.049> now<00:03:38.150> use<00:03:39.150> the

00:03:39.349 --> 00:03:39.359 
tungsten ring tungsten is up now use the

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:41.720 
tungsten ring tungsten is up now use the
pliers<00:03:39.590> as<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.799> can<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.159> the<00:03:41.340> ring<00:03:41.549> is

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:41.730 
pliers as you can see the ring is

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:43.819 
pliers as you can see the ring is
circular<00:03:42.269> now<00:03:42.900> I'm<00:03:43.049> really<00:03:43.290> going<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.590> slug

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
circular now I'm really going to slug

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:45.229 
circular now I'm really going to slug
this<00:03:44.040> because<00:03:44.370> obviously<00:03:44.579> this<00:03:44.939> is<00:03:45.000> the

00:03:45.229 --> 00:03:45.239 
this because obviously this is the

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:49.220 
this because obviously this is the
tungsten<00:03:45.480> test<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.859> I'm<00:03:47.310> going<00:03:48.209> to<00:03:48.299> do<00:03:48.450> more

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
tungsten test so I'm going to do more

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.899 
tungsten test so I'm going to do more
than<00:03:49.290> more<00:03:49.950> hits<00:03:50.189> than<00:03:50.340> I've<00:03:50.489> done<00:03:50.639> with<00:03:50.760> any

00:03:50.899 --> 00:03:50.909 
than more hits than I've done with any

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.119 
than more hits than I've done with any
of<00:03:50.999> the<00:03:51.060> other<00:03:51.180> rings<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:51.749> as<00:03:52.499> with<00:03:52.769> the<00:03:52.799> last

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:53.129 
of the other rings and as with the last

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:55.369 
of the other rings and as with the last
one<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:53.849> titanium<00:03:54.569> ring<00:03:54.959> I'm<00:03:55.079> going<00:03:55.200> to<00:03:55.260> hit

00:03:55.369 --> 00:03:55.379 
one the titanium ring I'm going to hit

00:03:55.379 --> 00:03:58.129 
one the titanium ring I'm going to hit
it<00:03:55.500> just<00:03:55.739> as<00:03:55.950> hard<00:03:56.069> if<00:03:56.310> not<00:03:56.370> harder<00:03:56.719> so<00:03:57.719> we<00:03:57.750> will

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
it just as hard if not harder so we will

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.720 
it just as hard if not harder so we will
see<00:03:58.349> what<00:03:58.620> kind<00:03:58.739> of<00:03:58.829> an<00:03:58.949> effect<00:03:59.040> this<00:03:59.459> has<00:03:59.699> on

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
see what kind of an effect this has on

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:15.349 
see what kind of an effect this has on
the<00:04:00.090> tungsten<00:04:00.870> ring<00:04:13.069> all<00:04:14.069> right<00:04:14.299> give<00:04:15.299> it

00:04:15.349 --> 00:04:15.359 
the tungsten ring all right give it

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:18.589 
the tungsten ring all right give it
about<00:04:15.480> seven<00:04:15.959> whacks<00:04:16.169> eight<00:04:16.530> wax<00:04:17.419> just<00:04:18.419> as

00:04:18.589 --> 00:04:18.599 
about seven whacks eight wax just as

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:21.770 
about seven whacks eight wax just as
much<00:04:18.840> power<00:04:19.250> if<00:04:20.250> not<00:04:20.519> more<00:04:20.849> than<00:04:21.269> what<00:04:21.479> we<00:04:21.599> did

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
much power if not more than what we did

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:28.279 
much power if not more than what we did
on<00:04:22.019> the<00:04:22.380> titanium<00:04:23.160> ring<00:04:26.240> there's<00:04:27.240> no<00:04:27.449> no
