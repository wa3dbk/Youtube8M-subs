 what you will be seeing right now 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.340
 on our screens and it's one thing 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:59.260
 spectacular is worth it because it has no other 

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.720
 name that is what you are seeing 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:04.540
 sorry on our screens so what 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.990
 you are watching is dreamhack sweden vale 

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:09.820
 is where dreamhack was born really and 

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.920
 for those who do not know is the festival 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:15.520
 the world's largest digital 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.830
 They have 19 editions and have three 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.230
 Guinness records we are talking about 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.090
 something spectacular we are talking about the 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.670
 mother of all the plans of the mother of 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.160
 all the events and it's something incredible 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.410
 because it's because they mix video games 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.230
 musical culture there are concerts 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:35.020
 electronics a lot of things really 

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:36.640
 of his age or incredible and therefore I 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.860
 personally what I'm going to try is 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.440

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.510

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.800
 winter so he does not understand it and I'm going to 

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:47.440
 try to go to the one that is going to celebrate 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.700
 well that's the same in winter but the most 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.370
 important is that you too 

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.900

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.120

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.450
 odds of winning a trip to 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.849

 that you like the events and so on 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.420
