running these things that come to life

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:56.859 
running these things that come to life
and<00:01:54.590> then<00:01:54.860> be<00:01:55.610> careful<00:01:56.030> because<00:01:56.390> they<00:01:56.570> do<00:01:56.630> take

00:01:56.859 --> 00:01:56.869 
and then be careful because they do take

00:01:56.869 --> 00:02:00.039 
and then be careful because they do take
a<00:01:56.900> lot<00:01:56.960> of<00:01:57.080> damage<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:58.030> I'll<00:01:59.030> explain<00:01:59.450> the

00:02:00.039 --> 00:02:00.049 
a lot of damage and I'll explain the

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.740 
a lot of damage and I'll explain the
evils<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.799> that<00:02:01.009> in<00:02:01.159> a<00:02:01.220> bit

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.350 

they<00:02:04.710> do<00:02:04.800> a<00:02:05.280> lot<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.550> damage

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
they do a lot of damage

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.640 
they do a lot of damage
just<00:02:07.930> be<00:02:08.050> careful<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.840> make<00:02:11.260> sure<00:02:11.290> you<00:02:11.470> dodge

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
just be careful so make sure you dodge

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.740 
just be careful so make sure you dodge
those<00:02:12.010> if<00:02:12.550> you<00:02:12.730> can<00:02:12.910> try<00:02:13.210> to<00:02:13.270> get<00:02:13.420> them<00:02:13.510> to<00:02:13.570> come

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
those if you can try to get them to come

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.210 
those if you can try to get them to come
near<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:14.050> and<00:02:14.200> piece<00:02:14.530> of<00:02:14.680> power<00:02:14.830> is<00:02:15.010> really

near you and piece of power is really

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:17.670 
near you and piece of power is really

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:17.680 
useful because it knocks them away and

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.500 
useful because it knocks them away and
it<00:02:17.860> keeps<00:02:18.040> them<00:02:18.160> far<00:02:18.610> enough<00:02:18.700> away<00:02:18.880> that<00:02:19.030> I<00:02:19.240> can

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:19.510 
it keeps them far enough away that I can

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.510 
it keeps them far enough away that I can
have<00:02:19.930> space<00:02:20.200> to<00:02:20.380> run<00:02:20.530> between<00:02:20.830> them<00:02:21.190> a<00:02:21.220> run

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:21.520 
have space to run between them a run

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.730 
have space to run between them a run
before<00:02:21.670> them<00:02:22.000> that's<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.170> see<00:02:23.440> you'll<00:02:23.590> see<00:02:23.650> I

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:23.740 
before them that's it see you'll see I

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:25.110 
before them that's it see you'll see I
can<00:02:23.980> knock<00:02:24.100> them<00:02:24.220> back<00:02:24.370> really<00:02:24.610> far<00:02:24.820> if<00:02:24.970> I<00:02:25.060> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
can knock them back really far if I the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.550 
can knock them back really far if I the
regular<00:02:25.510> swords<00:02:25.870> and<00:02:25.960> I<00:02:25.990> won't<00:02:26.140> be<00:02:26.200> able<00:02:26.290> to<00:02:26.380> do
