00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
I'm alright in my immediate area I try

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.140 
I'm alright in my immediate area I try
to<00:03:23.170> be<00:03:23.350> as<00:03:23.500> effective<00:03:24.010> as<00:03:24.220> possible<00:03:24.400> with<00:03:24.970> them

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
to be as effective as possible with them

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.850 
to be as effective as possible with them
and<00:03:25.390> there's<00:03:25.900> kind<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.170> an<00:03:26.260> example<00:03:26.530> of<00:03:26.740> me

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
and there's kind of an example of me

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:28.620 
and there's kind of an example of me
shifting<00:03:27.370> the<00:03:27.520> pattern<00:03:27.940> of<00:03:28.300> where<00:03:28.510> these

shifting the pattern of where these

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.300 
shifting the pattern of where these
things<00:03:28.870> are<00:03:28.990> going<00:03:29.170> as<00:03:29.440> I'm<00:03:29.590> trying<00:03:29.950> to<00:03:30.100> work

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
things are going as I'm trying to work

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.490 
things are going as I'm trying to work
towards<00:03:30.640> the<00:03:30.730> EM<00:03:30.850> calm<00:03:31.150> as<00:03:31.450> I'm<00:03:31.960> waiting<00:03:32.350> for

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
towards the EM calm as I'm waiting for

squad<00:03:33.130> mates<00:03:33.370> to<00:03:33.520> spawn<00:03:33.820> on<00:03:34.030> me<00:03:34.150> sometimes<00:03:34.660> I

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:34.930 
squad mates to spawn on me sometimes I

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.990 
squad mates to spawn on me sometimes I
will<00:03:35.110> sit<00:03:35.320> back<00:03:35.500> if<00:03:35.740> I<00:03:35.890> am<00:03:36.100> the<00:03:36.610> aggressive

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
will sit back if I am the aggressive

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.780 
will sit back if I am the aggressive
bush<00:03:37.210> wookie<00:03:37.630> with<00:03:38.350> the<00:03:38.500> pokeballs<00:03:39.040> and<00:03:39.370> if<00:03:39.700> I

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
bush wookie with the pokeballs and if I

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.700 
bush wookie with the pokeballs and if I
see<00:03:40.090> that<00:03:40.120> I've<00:03:40.540> got<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.780> great<00:03:40.960> position<00:03:41.230> and

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.710 
see that I've got a great position and

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:43.650 
see that I've got a great position and
my<00:03:41.800> squad<00:03:42.070> mates<00:03:42.250> are<00:03:42.400> slowly<00:03:42.610> dying<00:03:43.000> I<00:03:43.210> might

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
my squad mates are slowly dying I might

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:45.840 
my squad mates are slowly dying I might
play<00:03:43.810> super<00:03:44.230> defensive<00:03:44.680> but<00:03:45.310> the<00:03:45.400> problem<00:03:45.760> is

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:45.850 
play super defensive but the problem is

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:48.720 
play super defensive but the problem is
as<00:03:46.000> you<00:03:46.240> kill<00:03:46.480> 2<00:03:46.750> or<00:03:46.990> 3<00:03:47.290> or<00:03:47.440> 4<00:03:47.470> people<00:03:48.190> they're

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:48.730 
as you kill 2 or 3 or 4 people they're

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.220 
as you kill 2 or 3 or 4 people they're
probably<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.270> come<00:03:49.450> back<00:03:49.690> for<00:03:49.930> you<00:03:49.990> their

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
probably to come back for you their

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.050 
probably to come back for you their
squad<00:03:50.440> mate<00:03:50.620> for<00:03:50.800> more<00:03:51.040> than<00:03:51.220> likely<00:03:51.400> alive<00:03:51.880> in

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:52.060 
squad mate for more than likely alive in

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.940 
squad mate for more than likely alive in
the<00:03:52.120> rubble<00:03:52.420> because<00:03:52.540> there's<00:03:52.810> just<00:03:52.870> so<00:03:53.320> much

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:53.950 
the rubble because there's just so much

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:55.770 
the rubble because there's just so much
cover<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.520> then<00:03:54.610> of<00:03:54.730> course<00:03:54.760> beacons<00:03:55.450> can<00:03:55.660> be

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
cover and then of course beacons can be

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.750 
cover and then of course beacons can be
around<00:03:56.050> that<00:03:56.590> you<00:03:56.830> have<00:03:56.980> to<00:03:57.100> worry<00:03:57.340> about<00:03:57.460> that

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
around that you have to worry about that

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.940 
around that you have to worry about that
so<00:03:58.090> you<00:03:58.210> have<00:03:58.390> to<00:03:58.480> Pillar<00:03:58.720> and<00:03:59.050> play<00:03:59.500> super

00:03:59.940 --> 00:03:59.950 
so you have to Pillar and play super

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:01.260 
so you have to Pillar and play super
aggressive<00:04:00.340> as<00:04:00.460> I<00:04:00.580> get<00:04:00.730> that<00:04:00.850> kill<00:04:01.030> trade

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
aggressive as I get that kill trade

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.630 
aggressive as I get that kill trade
there<00:04:01.510> as<00:04:01.900> quick<00:04:02.170> as<00:04:02.200> I'm<00:04:02.440> in<00:04:02.650> you<00:04:03.190> got<00:04:03.370> to<00:04:03.490> get

there as quick as I'm in you got to get

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.150 
there as quick as I'm in you got to get
that<00:04:03.820> pokeball<00:04:04.480> out<00:04:04.690> that<00:04:04.930> information<00:04:05.350> is

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:06.160 
that pokeball out that information is

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.640 
that pokeball out that information is
just<00:04:06.190> massive<00:04:06.730> for<00:04:07.390> your<00:04:07.510> team<00:04:07.720> and<00:04:08.290> this<00:04:08.470> is

just massive for your team and this is

just massive for your team and this is
taking<00:04:09.460> a<00:04:09.520> trade<00:04:09.790> for<00:04:10.240> the<00:04:10.360> team<00:04:10.770> tanks

rolling<00:04:12.040> in<00:04:12.190> hot<00:04:12.370> probably<00:04:13.360> would<00:04:13.630> have

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
rolling in hot probably would have

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.420 
rolling in hot probably would have
wrecked<00:04:14.080> a<00:04:14.380> lot<00:04:14.410> of<00:04:14.560> face<00:04:14.860> and<00:04:15.100> I<00:04:15.130> will<00:04:15.280> gladly

go down with that ship as my body has

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.630 
go down with that ship as my body has
places<00:04:18.489> to<00:04:18.609> go<00:04:19.320> quick<00:04:20.320> to<00:04:20.710> my<00:04:20.830> people<00:04:21.190> and

places to go quick to my people and

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:23.159 
places to go quick to my people and
here's<00:04:22.030> another<00:04:22.240> example<00:04:22.419> of<00:04:22.750> us<00:04:22.900> kind<00:04:23.110> of

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:23.169 
here's another example of us kind of

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:23.850 
here's another example of us kind of
spamming<00:04:23.620> it<00:04:23.710> out

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860 
spamming it out

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:25.379 
spamming it out
just<00:04:24.069> a<00:04:24.129> little<00:04:24.370> bit<00:04:24.520> but<00:04:24.849> nothing's<00:04:25.240> really

00:04:25.379 --> 00:04:25.389 
just a little bit but nothing's really

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:27.899 
just a little bit but nothing's really
going<00:04:25.479> on<00:04:25.810> it's<00:04:26.349> always<00:04:26.830> very<00:04:27.280> nice<00:04:27.550> when

00:04:27.899 --> 00:04:27.909 
going on it's always very nice when

00:04:27.909 --> 00:04:29.850 
going on it's always very nice when
you've<00:04:28.030> got<00:04:28.180> a<00:04:28.210> squad<00:04:28.509> mate<00:04:28.810> that's<00:04:29.199> dropping

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
you've got a squad mate that's dropping

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.619 
you've got a squad mate that's dropping
their<00:04:30.039> sack<00:04:30.370> whether<00:04:30.669> it's<00:04:30.849> a<00:04:30.909> medic<00:04:31.270> or<00:04:31.419> the

their sack whether it's a medic or the
crate<00:04:31.990> more<00:04:32.259> than<00:04:32.409> portly<00:04:32.889> so<00:04:33.250> if<00:04:33.340> I<00:04:33.430> didn't

00:04:33.749 --> 00:04:33.759 
crate more than portly so if I didn't

00:04:33.759 --> 00:04:35.129 
crate more than portly so if I didn't
have<00:04:33.909> that<00:04:33.939> levelled<00:04:34.449> all<00:04:34.599> the<00:04:34.719> way<00:04:34.810> up<00:04:34.930> with<00:04:35.050> a

have that levelled all the way up with a
speck<00:04:35.349> on<00:04:35.469> this<00:04:35.620> class<00:04:35.830> I<00:04:35.979> wouldn't<00:04:36.280> have<00:04:36.400> as

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:36.520 
speck on this class I wouldn't have as

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.580 
speck on this class I wouldn't have as
many<00:04:36.639> pokeballs<00:04:37.389> so<00:04:37.960> it's<00:04:38.080> nice<00:04:38.259> to<00:04:38.289> be<00:04:38.530> able

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:38.590 
many pokeballs so it's nice to be able

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.469 
many pokeballs so it's nice to be able
to<00:04:38.710> sit<00:04:38.919> on<00:04:38.949> that<00:04:39.280> and<00:04:39.490> throw<00:04:39.849> the<00:04:40.000> pokeball

to sit on that and throw the pokeball

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:42.209 
to sit on that and throw the pokeball
out<00:04:40.659> getting<00:04:41.050> one<00:04:41.169> back<00:04:41.409> instantly<00:04:41.830> as<00:04:42.069> long

in<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:19.539> round<00:05:19.840> had<00:05:20.110> a<00:05:20.139> ton<00:05:20.889> of<00:05:21.090> action<00:05:22.090> just

00:05:22.439 --> 00:05:22.449 
in this round had a ton of action just

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:24.179 
in this round had a ton of action just
non-stop<00:05:22.779> actually<00:05:23.680> that's<00:05:23.830> the<00:05:24.009> thing

00:05:24.179 --> 00:05:24.189 
non-stop actually that's the thing

00:05:24.189 --> 00:05:25.920 
non-stop actually that's the thing
that's<00:05:24.310> really<00:05:24.460> happened<00:05:25.060> when<00:05:25.180> they<00:05:25.330> change

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
that's really happened when they change

that's really happened when they change
teaches<00:05:26.229> Shanghai<00:05:26.529> is<00:05:26.590> that<00:05:26.800> guy<00:05:26.919> actually

00:05:27.149 --> 00:05:27.159 
teaches Shanghai is that guy actually

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:29.309 
teaches Shanghai is that guy actually
crater<00:05:27.729> it<00:05:28.029> did<00:05:28.150> enough<00:05:28.300> damage<00:05:28.330> that<00:05:28.930> his

00:05:29.309 --> 00:05:29.319 
crater it did enough damage that his

00:05:29.319 --> 00:05:31.529 
crater it did enough damage that his
little<00:05:29.589> fall<00:05:29.949> finish<00:05:30.699> the<00:05:30.849> job<00:05:31.060> so<00:05:31.120> kind<00:05:31.479> of

00:05:31.529 --> 00:05:31.539 
little fall finish the job so kind of

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:33.420 
little fall finish the job so kind of
robbed<00:05:31.750> him<00:05:31.930> kill<00:05:32.169> there<00:05:32.409> but<00:05:32.860> I<00:05:32.889> think<00:05:33.099> it's

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:33.430 
robbed him kill there but I think it's

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.279 
robbed him kill there but I think it's
even<00:05:33.699> funnier<00:05:33.969> than<00:05:34.120> he<00:05:34.300> actually<00:05:34.389> crater<00:05:34.870> is

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:35.289 
even funnier than he actually crater is

00:05:35.289 --> 00:05:36.600 
even funnier than he actually crater is
when<00:05:35.500> they<00:05:35.560> took<00:05:35.710> away<00:05:35.860> the<00:05:36.009> spawn<00:05:36.250> beacons

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
when they took away the spawn beacons

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:38.129 
when they took away the spawn beacons
and<00:05:36.729> all<00:05:36.849> the<00:05:37.060> elevators<00:05:37.629> in<00:05:37.750> this<00:05:37.870> game<00:05:38.020> you

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:38.139 
and all the elevators in this game you

00:05:38.139 --> 00:05:39.059 
and all the elevators in this game you
don't<00:05:38.289> have<00:05:38.409> to<00:05:38.529> worry<00:05:38.740> about<00:05:38.770> people

00:05:39.059 --> 00:05:39.069 
don't have to worry about people

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:41.550 
don't have to worry about people
lingering<00:05:39.639> on<00:05:39.729> rooftops<00:05:40.270> it<00:05:40.539> forces<00:05:41.229> all<00:05:41.500> the

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:41.560 
lingering on rooftops it forces all the

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:43.409 
lingering on rooftops it forces all the
action<00:05:42.219> down<00:05:42.370> on<00:05:42.490> the<00:05:42.580> playing<00:05:42.879> field<00:05:43.180> I<00:05:43.300> think

00:05:43.409 --> 00:05:43.419 
action down on the playing field I think

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:45.689 
action down on the playing field I think
it's<00:05:43.569> absolutely<00:05:44.020> nuts<00:05:44.949> so<00:05:45.370> the<00:05:45.460> one<00:05:45.580> thing

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:45.699 
it's absolutely nuts so the one thing

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:48.719 
it's absolutely nuts so the one thing
about<00:05:45.789> the<00:05:46.050> sg553<00:05:47.050> is<00:05:47.770> I<00:05:48.009> don't<00:05:48.219> have<00:05:48.400> to<00:05:48.550> tap

00:05:48.719 --> 00:05:48.729 
about the sg553 is I don't have to tap

00:05:48.729 --> 00:05:52.499 
about the sg553 is I don't have to tap
fire<00:05:48.969> as<00:05:49.210> much<00:05:49.569> as<00:05:49.750> the<00:05:50.460> acw-r<00:05:51.460> I<00:05:51.669> can<00:05:52.150> burst

00:05:52.499 --> 00:05:52.509 
fire as much as the acw-r I can burst

00:05:52.509 --> 00:05:54.749 
fire as much as the acw-r I can burst
just<00:05:52.750> a<00:05:52.900> little<00:05:53.289> bit<00:05:53.439> longer<00:05:53.800> and<00:05:54.099> mag<00:05:54.339> dump<00:05:54.610> at

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:54.759 
just a little bit longer and mag dump at

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:56.519 
just a little bit longer and mag dump at
closer<00:05:55.060> ranges<00:05:55.569> which<00:05:56.020> is<00:05:56.139> nice<00:05:56.289> because

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:56.529 
closer ranges which is nice because

00:05:56.529 --> 00:05:58.649 
closer ranges which is nice because
there's<00:05:56.740> not<00:05:57.009> as<00:05:57.219> much<00:05:57.430> horizontal<00:05:58.060> recoil<00:05:58.240> it

00:05:58.649 --> 00:05:58.659 
there's not as much horizontal recoil it

00:05:58.659 --> 00:06:00.600 
there's not as much horizontal recoil it
feels<00:05:58.839> like<00:05:59.139> so<00:05:59.680> this<00:05:59.740> is<00:05:59.830> actually<00:06:00.219> a<00:06:00.250> really

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:00.610 
feels like so this is actually a really

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.480 
feels like so this is actually a really
fun<00:06:00.939> carbine<00:06:01.419> to<00:06:01.779> use<00:06:02.050> I<00:06:02.379> have<00:06:02.439> a<00:06:02.650> lot<00:06:02.919> of<00:06:02.949> fun

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:03.490 
fun carbine to use I have a lot of fun

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:04.950 
fun carbine to use I have a lot of fun
with<00:06:03.669> this<00:06:03.789> thing<00:06:04.029> I've<00:06:04.240> had<00:06:04.389> fun<00:06:04.629> with<00:06:04.839> this

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:04.960 
with this thing I've had fun with this

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.230 
with this thing I've had fun with this
but<00:06:05.379> remember<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:06.060> suppressor<00:06:07.060> is<00:06:07.120> gonna

00:06:07.230 --> 00:06:07.240 
but remember that suppressor is gonna

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:09.719 
but remember that suppressor is gonna
slow<00:06:07.750> down<00:06:07.779> the<00:06:08.199> velocity<00:06:08.889> a<00:06:09.039> ton<00:06:09.460> so<00:06:09.610> if

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:09.729 
slow down the velocity a ton so if

00:06:09.729 --> 00:06:11.070 
slow down the velocity a ton so if
they're<00:06:09.879> up<00:06:10.000> close<00:06:10.300> like<00:06:10.449> this<00:06:10.629> guy<00:06:10.810> it's<00:06:10.990> not

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:11.080 
they're up close like this guy it's not

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:13.170 
they're up close like this guy it's not
gonna<00:06:11.439> be<00:06:11.650> a<00:06:11.800> problem<00:06:12.189> if<00:06:12.550> they're<00:06:12.909> moving

00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:13.180 
gonna be a problem if they're moving

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.760 
gonna be a problem if they're moving
side<00:06:13.389> to<00:06:13.419> side<00:06:13.539> it<00:06:13.930> might<00:06:14.169> be<00:06:14.319> a<00:06:14.349> little<00:06:14.500> bit<00:06:14.680> of

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:14.770 
side to side it might be a little bit of

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:16.980 
side to side it might be a little bit of
problem<00:06:15.189> as<00:06:15.339> the<00:06:15.879> distance<00:06:16.180> gets<00:06:16.419> further<00:06:16.810> and

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:16.990 
problem as the distance gets further and

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:19.170 
problem as the distance gets further and
further<00:06:17.250> away<00:06:18.250> from<00:06:18.279> you<00:06:18.669> and<00:06:18.819> trying<00:06:19.120> to

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:19.180 
further away from you and trying to

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:21.480 
further away from you and trying to
prioritize<00:06:19.389> my<00:06:20.229> targets<00:06:20.680> based<00:06:20.860> on<00:06:21.129> who's<00:06:21.310> the

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.490 
prioritize my targets based on who's the

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:23.939 
prioritize my targets based on who's the
bigger<00:06:21.669> threat<00:06:21.879> for<00:06:22.419> who<00:06:22.629> I<00:06:22.930> can<00:06:23.289> actually<00:06:23.529> get

00:06:23.939 --> 00:06:23.949 
bigger threat for who I can actually get

00:06:23.949 --> 00:06:26.339 
bigger threat for who I can actually get
to<00:06:24.219> so<00:06:24.759> where<00:06:25.060> you<00:06:25.120> get<00:06:25.240> to<00:06:25.360> this<00:06:25.509> third<00:06:25.930> set<00:06:26.229> of
