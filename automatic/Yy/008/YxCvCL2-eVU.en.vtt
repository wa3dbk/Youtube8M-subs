00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.390
 it would seem that there is a knight xv in common 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.100
 i'm im rock v5 plus looking at these 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.930
 smartphones will never believe that they 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.060
 are representatives of one class 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.710
 first stylish elegant business 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.340
 a smartphone that can complement business 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.470
 form 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.480
 and the second is brutal with bright inserts 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.900
 orientation to use beyond 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.510
 cities with almost the same width night 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.550
 length and 11 millimeters thickness 5 and 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.470
 40 grams lighter however this is not 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.239
 surprisingly given the different directions 

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.040
 uses besides each of 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.280
 devices quite comfortably lies in 

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.620
 hand in terms of buttons and technological 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.050
 xv holes are distinguished by the presence of a function 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:59.850
 sos emergency call opportunity 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.710
 sending location coordinates 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.989
 smartphones work on the same 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.460
 dual-core chipsets 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 has the same amount of operational 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.750
 and internal memory despite more 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.369
 overclocked processor in night smartphones 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:16.229
 have the same performance and 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:18.020
 the speed of the machines are equipped 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.369
 similar lithium-ion batteries 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.320
 capacity of 2000 milliampere hours 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.630
 the duration of their battery life 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:27.180
 about the same however smartphones 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:30.600
 noticeable difference in display size 4 3 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.229
 inches xv and 32 respect their resolution 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.000
 480 by 800 against 320 by 480 

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.250
 so despite the same level 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.619
 16 million colors 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.430
 xp shows much higher 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:46.530
 image quality has night 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.720
 main camera with high resolution 8 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.520
 megapixels versus five so 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.560
 the quality of the material obtained from him 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.290
 noticeably higher besides this smartphones 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.800
 there is a front camera on 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.210
 and MP for skype and video calls as well 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:01.880
 does it correspond to the international 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.980
 standard crayfish 67 that is, it will stand 

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.870
 half an hour swimming in the water and capable 

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.030
 resist ingress of water and dust 

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:11.120
 night highest civilian 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.310
 security standard api 68 smartphone 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.840
 not only dustproof but ready 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:17.210
 prolonged immersion in 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:18.860
 more than one meter apart from this xv 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.360
 meets the military standard that 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.160
 allows him not to be afraid of blows and 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.530
 falls extreme extremes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:28.090
 temperature and pressure vibrations even 

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:30.410
 exposure to chemically active substances 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.810
 devices made from quality 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.090
 abs plastic but the night has no 

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:37.310
 rubber inserts and they have the opposite 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:39.020
 large enough bumper and device 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.060
 produced in thick rubber has 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:43.070
 metal plate reinforced cover 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.870
 battery compartment cover itself 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.330
 mounted on 2 bolts on one side 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:48.770
 special ears with a different sealing 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.120
 gum inside the battery compartment 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.520
 provide a high level 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.650
 tightness true lesson stub you 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.709
 again the tone of solid rubber means 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.570
 over time can load the case and to 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.200
 its tightly twisted ten powerful 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:02.209
 screws 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.739
 and its special design contributes 

00:03:02.209 --> 00:03:05.650
 so that when the fall could not 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.670
 damage the most fragile parts 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.769
 the tightness of the smartphone provides 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.080
 two-component plugs with plastic 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:13.790
 core providing higher 

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.230
 fit level which tight 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.690
 close technological openings 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.760
 battery cover you to your 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.170
 similarly the design however however 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.010
 performed without any metal 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.349
 stiffness inserts 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:26.970
 overall rock v5 + thanks to massive 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:29.370
 bumper possesses more aggressive 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:31.079
 protection though night more hermetic 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.790
 its thoughtful design and high 

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:34.530
 the quality of materials allows him to 

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.489
 ease to come out the winner of any 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.489
 life situations
