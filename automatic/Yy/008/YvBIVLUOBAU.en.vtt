bitchin but uh yeah anyway there at the
beginning<00:00:34.860> of<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.280> match<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.670> saw<00:00:35.880> me<00:00:36.090> I<00:00:36.329> just

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
beginning of the match you saw me I just

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.340 
beginning of the match you saw me I just
pulled<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.870> menu<00:00:37.260> and<00:00:37.410> I<00:00:37.469> threw<00:00:37.770> away<00:00:37.920> my

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:39.350 
pulled my menu and I threw away my

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.139 
pulled my menu and I threw away my
pistol<00:00:40.350> and<00:00:40.530> the<00:00:40.980> reason<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.309> did<00:00:41.489> that<00:00:41.520> same

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
pistol and the reason I did that same

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.170 
pistol and the reason I did that same
reason<00:00:42.420> you<00:00:42.510> do<00:00:42.629> it<00:00:42.750> in<00:00:42.809> resin<00:00:43.020> evil<00:00:43.200> 4<00:00:44.180> it's

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
reason you do it in resin evil 4 it's

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:46.729 
reason you do it in resin evil 4 it's
because<00:00:45.629> you<00:00:45.930> could<00:00:46.050> through<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.379> pistol

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
because you could through your pistol

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.760 
because you could through your pistol
down<00:00:46.920> then<00:00:47.340> enemies<00:00:48.270> stop<00:00:48.780> dropping<00:00:49.110> pistol

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
down then enemies stop dropping pistol

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.889 
down then enemies stop dropping pistol
ammo<00:00:50.039> and<00:00:50.309> since<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> only<00:00:51.480> weapon<00:00:51.719> I<00:00:51.809> would

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
ammo and since the only weapon I would

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:53.389 
ammo and since the only weapon I would
have<00:00:52.020> left<00:00:52.199> is<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> shotgun<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.100> all<00:00:53.250> they

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
have left is a shotgun that's all they

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.250 
have left is a shotgun that's all they
drop<00:00:53.640> a<00:00:53.670> shotgun<00:00:54.239> ammo<00:00:54.539> so<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.870> end<00:00:55.020> up<00:00:55.050> with<00:00:55.199> a

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
drop a shotgun ammo so you end up with a

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.080 
drop a shotgun ammo so you end up with a
whole<00:00:55.440> bunch<00:00:55.500> of<00:00:55.739> that<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.879> is<00:00:56.910> good

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:57.090 
whole bunch of that which is good

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:58.970 
whole bunch of that which is good
because<00:00:57.510> obviously<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.289> shotgun<00:00:58.649> is<00:00:58.770> much

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
because obviously the shotgun is much

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.290 
because obviously the shotgun is much
stronger<00:00:59.250> than<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.640> pistol<00:01:00.030> and<00:01:02.120> now<00:01:03.120> what

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
stronger than the pistol and now what

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.020 
stronger than the pistol and now what
I'm<00:01:03.359> doing<00:01:03.690> here<00:01:04.019> I'm<00:01:04.140> not<00:01:04.890> running<00:01:05.700> I've<00:01:05.820> not

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
I'm doing here I'm not running I've not

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:07.399 
I'm doing here I'm not running I've not
killed<00:01:06.240> anybody<00:01:06.540> yet<00:01:06.750> I'm<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.260> running

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
killed anybody yet I'm just running

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:11.630 
killed anybody yet I'm just running
around<00:01:07.790> gathering<00:01:08.790> up<00:01:09.000> all<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.299> time<00:01:10.640> because

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
around gathering up all the time because

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.950 
around gathering up all the time because
more<00:01:11.939> time<00:01:12.150> equals<00:01:12.330> more<00:01:12.540> kills<00:01:12.900> obviously

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:14.960 
more time equals more kills obviously

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.020 
more time equals more kills obviously
this<00:01:15.960> is<00:01:16.200> pretty<00:01:16.770> much<00:01:16.860> how<00:01:16.979> all<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> pros<00:01:17.700> do
