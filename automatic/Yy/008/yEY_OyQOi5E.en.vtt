00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
turn into making a line out of it which

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:05.840 
turn into making a line out of it which
is<00:01:04.049> basically<00:01:04.199> going<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:04.830> be<00:01:04.949> the<00:01:05.129> first<00:01:05.489> line

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
is basically going to be the first line

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.910 
is basically going to be the first line
of<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:06.240> two<00:01:06.390> you're<00:01:06.570> going<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.840> be<00:01:06.960> making<00:01:07.170> for

both sides try to keep this as straight

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.210 
both sides try to keep this as straight
as<00:01:18.210> possible<00:01:18.270> but<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.439> okay<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> go<00:01:20.070> a<00:01:20.130> little

as possible but it's okay to go a little

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.910 
as possible but it's okay to go a little
haywire<00:01:20.700> that's<00:01:21.030> why<00:01:21.210> it's<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.420> DIY<00:01:21.770> make<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:22.920 
haywire that's why it's a DIY make the

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.560 
haywire that's why it's a DIY make the
same<00:01:23.100> kind<00:01:23.369> of<00:01:23.430> line<00:01:23.640> leaving<00:01:23.909> a<00:01:24.150> little<00:01:24.420> bit

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
same kind of line leaving a little bit

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.510 
same kind of line leaving a little bit
of<00:01:24.659> space<00:01:24.960> just<00:01:25.860> as<00:01:26.040> long<00:01:26.220> as<00:01:26.369> they're

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
of space just as long as they're

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.510 
of space just as long as they're
parallel<00:01:27.090> it's<00:01:27.420> fine<00:01:27.900> you<00:01:28.799> don't<00:01:29.009> have<00:01:29.159> to<00:01:29.310> be
