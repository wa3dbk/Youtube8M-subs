00:01:27.359 --> 00:01:27.369 
clearly wasn't vulnerable so I had to

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.950 
clearly wasn't vulnerable so I had to
make<00:01:27.579> a<00:01:27.640> very<00:01:27.820> hard<00:01:28.060> decision<00:01:28.180> and<00:01:28.630> I<00:01:28.689> had<00:01:28.810> to

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:28.960 
make a very hard decision and I had to

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.020 
make a very hard decision and I had to
close<00:01:29.140> it<00:01:29.380> down<00:01:29.409> so<00:01:30.040> when<00:01:30.340> I<00:01:30.490> finished<00:01:30.880> with

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:31.030 
close it down so when I finished with

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.940 
close it down so when I finished with
that<00:01:31.180> I<00:01:31.240> really<00:01:31.659> wanted<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.079> continue<00:01:32.560> working

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
that I really wanted to continue working

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.429 
that I really wanted to continue working
and<00:01:33.460> but<00:01:34.390> I<00:01:34.420> had<00:01:34.600> to<00:01:34.720> think<00:01:34.899> of<00:01:35.079> something<00:01:35.110> that

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:35.439 
and but I had to think of something that

00:01:35.439 --> 00:01:38.399 
and but I had to think of something that
I<00:01:35.649> could<00:01:35.740> do<00:01:36.040> in<00:01:36.399> a<00:01:36.579> rural<00:01:37.060> area<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:38.259> would

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:38.409

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
obviously the shop at the time wasn't

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:47.100 
obviously the shop at the time wasn't
going<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.520> be<00:01:45.670> a<00:01:45.909> suitable<00:01:46.360> location<00:01:47.079> for

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.110

I've<00:03:09.920> been<00:03:10.160> working<00:03:10.610> primarily<00:03:10.970> with

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
I've been working primarily with

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.780 
I've been working primarily with
chocolate<00:03:12.260> bars<00:03:12.500> because<00:03:13.099> they<00:03:13.310> do<00:03:13.370> have

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
chocolate bars because they do have

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:16.300 
chocolate bars because they do have
quite<00:03:14.090> a<00:03:14.150> long<00:03:14.390> shelf<00:03:14.630> life<00:03:14.840> and<00:03:15.260> so<00:03:16.010> it<00:03:16.130> gives

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:16.310 
quite a long shelf life and so it gives

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:19.030 
quite a long shelf life and so it gives
me<00:03:16.579> time<00:03:16.849> for<00:03:17.150> wrapping<00:03:17.810> packing<00:03:18.290> making<00:03:18.829> and

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:19.040 
me time for wrapping packing making and

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.630 
me time for wrapping packing making and
distributing<00:03:19.970> then<00:03:20.480> so<00:03:21.170> I<00:03:21.530> am<00:03:21.769> it<00:03:22.190> was<00:03:22.459> the

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
distributing then so I am it was the

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.580 
distributing then so I am it was the
easiest<00:03:22.910> product<00:03:23.269> for<00:03:23.690> me<00:03:23.810> to<00:03:23.989> start<00:03:24.290> with

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:24.590 
easiest product for me to start with

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.750

initially

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:27.760 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.990 

I<00:03:28.680> really<00:03:29.680> enjoy<00:03:29.950> doing<00:03:29.980> the<00:03:30.519> deliveries

I really enjoy doing the deliveries
because<00:03:31.390> it's<00:03:31.659> when<00:03:31.900> i<00:03:32.019> get<00:03:32.290> to<00:03:32.530> go<00:03:32.560> out<00:03:32.799> and

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:33.099 
because it's when i get to go out and

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:35.250 
because it's when i get to go out and
meet<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.640> customers<00:03:34.180> and<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.540> managers<00:03:34.989> and

meet the customers and the managers and

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.350 
meet the customers and the managers and
i<00:03:35.530> got<00:03:35.680> great<00:03:35.980> feedback<00:03:36.280> by<00:03:36.790> talking<00:03:37.239> to

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:39.579 
everybody but I suppose it's very ironic

00:03:39.579 --> 00:03:42.390 
everybody but I suppose it's very ironic
that<00:03:40.209> I<00:03:40.269> actually<00:03:40.510> have<00:03:40.810> to<00:03:40.930> walk<00:03:41.110> past<00:03:41.530> my<00:03:42.159> old

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
that I actually have to walk past my old

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.860 
that I actually have to walk past my old
clothes<00:03:42.819> shop<00:03:43.150> when<00:03:43.360> i'm<00:03:43.450> doing<00:03:43.599> the

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
deliveries so all I suppose when I do

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:47.580 
deliveries so all I suppose when I do
close<00:03:46.420> the<00:03:46.659> shop<00:03:46.840> I<00:03:47.079> never<00:03:47.319> would<00:03:47.560> have

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:49.780 
believed but I won't be going past there

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:54.890 
believed but I won't be going past there
