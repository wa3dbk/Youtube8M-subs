your mouth don't slow down that's the
thing<00:03:48.080> it's<00:03:48.440> a<00:03:48.590> gauge<00:03:48.800> you<00:03:49.250> know<00:03:49.340> what<00:03:49.430> I<00:03:49.490> mean

at that point so so slow down where you

00:03:55.459 --> 00:03:56.830 
at that point so so slow down where you
can<00:03:55.640> comfortably<00:03:56.000> just<00:03:56.420> breathe<00:03:56.660> through

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840

squeeze it and suck all the water
liquids<00:04:19.100> and<00:04:19.160> sodium<00:04:19.660> that<00:04:20.660> I<00:04:20.690> came<00:04:20.989> out<00:04:21.140> of<00:04:21.169> it

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:21.350 
liquids and sodium that I came out of it

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.330 
liquids and sodium that I came out of it
to<00:04:21.709> put<00:04:21.859> it<00:04:21.919> on<00:04:22.220> back<00:04:23.180> into<00:04:23.450> my<00:04:23.570> body
