00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:10.490 
recently just got my stats up a bit and
I<00:00:07.280> originally<00:00:08.280> was<00:00:08.730> 45<00:00:09.660> defense<00:00:10.139> but<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
I originally was 45 defense but I

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:12.770 
I originally was 45 defense but I
decided<00:00:10.950> there<00:00:11.849> was<00:00:11.969> really<00:00:12.090> no<00:00:12.300> point<00:00:12.570> to

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
decided there was really no point to

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.919 
decided there was really no point to
that<00:00:12.920> so<00:00:13.920> I<00:00:13.950> just<00:00:14.309> decided<00:00:14.429> to<00:00:14.849> get<00:00:14.940> 65<00:00:15.540> and<00:00:15.870> I

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
that so I just decided to get 65 and I

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:17.480

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
to get a better Cape because obsidian

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.300 
to get a better Cape because obsidian
Cape<00:02:18.700> obviously<00:02:19.269> isn't<00:02:19.420> the<00:02:19.599> best<00:02:19.810> but<00:02:20.280> then<00:02:21.280> I

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
Cape obviously isn't the best but then I

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.720 
Cape obviously isn't the best but then I
then<00:02:21.909> my<00:02:22.180> other<00:02:22.390> goals<00:02:23.230> is<00:02:23.650> i<00:02:23.830> want<00:02:23.950> at<00:02:24.099> least<00:02:24.159> i

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
then my other goals is i want at least i

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.850 
then my other goals is i want at least i
think<00:02:25.209> i'm<00:02:25.390> going<00:02:25.480> to<00:02:25.569> get<00:02:25.659> like<00:02:25.870> 75<00:02:26.470> strength

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:26.860 
think i'm going to get like 75 strength

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.720 
think i'm going to get like 75 strength
and<00:02:27.069> i<00:02:27.099> might<00:02:27.280> train<00:02:27.519> up<00:02:28.980> attack<00:02:29.980> i'm<00:02:30.310> not<00:02:30.489> sure

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
and i might train up attack i'm not sure

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.150 
and i might train up attack i'm not sure
about<00:02:30.819> that<00:02:31.150> but<00:02:31.530> i'm<00:02:32.530> thinking<00:02:32.830> i<00:02:32.890> should<00:02:32.920> get

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:33.160

about that but i'm thinking i should get
strength<00:02:33.519> really<00:02:34.060> high<00:02:34.239> before<00:02:34.480> i<00:02:34.720> get<00:02:34.930> the

strength really high before i get the
whip<00:02:35.470> because<00:02:35.739> then<00:02:36.160> i<00:02:36.190> won't<00:02:36.489> be<00:02:36.670> using<00:02:37.390> i

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:38.010 
whip because then i won't be using i

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:40.500 
whip because then i won't be using i
won't<00:02:39.010> be<00:02:39.099> using<00:02:39.280> other<00:02:39.640> weapons<00:02:40.090> that<00:02:40.299> much

won't be using other weapons that much

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:43.680 
won't be using other weapons that much
