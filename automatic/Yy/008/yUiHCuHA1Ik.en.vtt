00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.670
 hello how about here and Ã¡lex in minecraft 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:26.670
 version 1.3 point 2 with a review of a 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.029
 mod that is called convenien inventor and 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:32.160
 convenient inventory and add a series 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.410
 of commands that will make life easier 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.110
 well before I started I wanted to comment 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.809
 that was going to go up monster series but 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.910
 I did not like the chapter 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.640
 tomorrow when I have seen it said go 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.920
 cake to ccoo and I have deleted it throws me the 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.840
 trash directly so I'll return it to 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.210
 do 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:56.200
 and for tomorrow it's worth it then let's start 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:56.200
 seeing what this mod brings 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.339
 this mod serves to remove more things 

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:04.850
 easily from our inventory to 

00:01:01.339 --> 00:01:06.860
 our chests or vice versa as you know 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.720
 the commands that we normally have is 

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:12.470
 click and left to get a stack 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:13.580
 Right click to divide it and now 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.260
 is 

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.300
 all right 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:20.570
 with this mode we will have more commands 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:23.480
 as for example control and 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.210
 Right click as you will see an item to a 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:30.770
 empty place therefore you are not that 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:32.450
 they will make it worth as simple if you do what 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.150
 same but with left click okay 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.770
 control left click what you will do is 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.770
 move them to the same stack 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.130
 now let's move to the shift key of 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:48.080
 time shift and right click as you will see 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.910
 a stack an empty place 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.570
 this to see it better let's do it 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:54.380
 A) Yes 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.380
 a stack 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:02.400
 Well this key does not work 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:02.400
 well nothing 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:12.090
 with shift and right click not 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.590
 clear is that with left click that is 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.180
 what he was doing 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.310
 if left click you will see 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:21.280
 the stack normally but with click 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:24.250
 right as you see an empty place 77 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.280
 Right click to move to an empty place 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.780
 we're 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:32.770
 what else do we have 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:35.530
 with the alt key 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:38.330
 Left click we will return all the 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.740
 items of the same type 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.740
 this is great, right 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:47.590
 with right click we will move all the 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.780
 items but to an empty place 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.830
 we are going to divide this and you are going to see how 

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:57.850
 works 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:57.850
 So that's fine, so it's great 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:04.090
 we can also do little things with the 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.900
 key that you are seeing my keyboard but 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:09.960
 well I'm saying it, it's ok 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:12.560
 left click 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.230
 what you will do is throw an item 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.660
 OK 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.080
 you do not have to be like that 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.560
 you can do it from the chest 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:22.560
 ah 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:28.760
 I say right click that is more click 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.569
 right drops the entire state 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:31.569
 well, not 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:38.540
 let's see now a combination of 

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:42.150
 keys it will be shift and q with shift 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:44.670
 cook and left click 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:48.120
 what we will do is throw away all 

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:50.730
 items of the same type if very useful for 

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.290
 empty the inventory if we have it but 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.950
 shitty 

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.950
 basically 

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.959
 with the central button 

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.629
 what we are going to do is order our 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.799
 inventory central mouse button the 

00:04:05.629 --> 00:04:08.799
 ruedita worth 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.590
 good 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:14.590
 ah 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.890
 ok yes and finally is that we had 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.440
 here a note 

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:25.030
 because to learn from all this memory if 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.030
 I have a receiver, it's hard to imagine this 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.669
 just left 

00:04:29.169 --> 00:04:37.569
 if there is a book it is worth in this way that it is 

00:04:33.669 --> 00:04:42.240
 that in theory squeezing the s and one of 

00:04:37.569 --> 00:04:42.240
 these stacks should 

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:49.170
 not the s and on top of one of these stacks 

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:52.300
 pressing a number should move to 

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:57.060
 the action bar 

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.060
 but do not move just happen with the zero 

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:03.580
 70 not that that 0 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:05.740
 than zero and left click 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:07.840
 with the click and that the left brain 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.759
 what we will do is take it to a hole 

00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.759
 empty steering bar 

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:17.270
 Then I got this 

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:21.100
 you have to get used to this mod is 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:21.100
 quite strange the truth 

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:26.300
 but good once accustomed is very 

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.590
 useful I think we have it installed 

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:29.990
 in the series of mods and if we do not have it 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.660
 you install 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:37.070
 because I remember playing with those 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:39.800
 mods and using this too 

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.410
 so nothing this has been the mode of 

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:44.000
 convenient inventors and I hope that you 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:46.610
 have liked the video to be like that 

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.300
