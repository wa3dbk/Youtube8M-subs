00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:08.260
 the netherlands faces a major challenge economic recovery is needed just like it 

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.760
 reducing public spending also renewing public 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.979
 governance is a must 

00:00:12.979 --> 00:00:14.779
 that requires a fresh look 

00:00:14.779 --> 00:00:17.880
 to begin with how the administrative system functions 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.070
 it must be smarter and cheaper 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.039
 how exactly do the provinces present it in the provinces profile 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.109
 a vision that is realistic and coherent 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.109
 with a view to strengthening middle management 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.990
 provinces to be set up with profile provinces for cooperation with others 

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.230
 governments 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.230
 the target 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.880
 a healthy and effective public administration 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.980
 the most important ingredients for this are less administrative crowds 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.190
 and a high ambition and performance level 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.660
 for all government layers 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.170
 That is why the provinces want to make agreements with the government and other governments 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.050
 on a clear goal-oriented and efficient division of labor 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.060
 that is possible on the basis of crystal clear administrative and financial agreements 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.110
 must be decentralized unless it can only be done centrally 

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.760
 profile province is not isolated 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.770
 it is in line with the governmental agreement on the provinces and with the advice of the 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.380
 commission lodders 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.100
 the province are primarily responsible for the regional 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.540
 environmental policy resulting from 7 core provincial tasks 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.360
 sustainable spatial development and design including water management environment 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.370
 energy and climate 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:38.360
 and vital countryside, regional accessibility and also today 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:39.430
 transport 

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.280
 the regional economy 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:44.610
 cultural infrastructure and monument care 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.400
 qualities of the alphenaar board 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:51.310
 the provinces can pre-eminently play a cross-sectoral and connecting role 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.550
 play 

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:56.870
 so takes its responsibility as the area director that means the 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:59.670
 province organizes the interaction 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:04.150
 between the physical environment the economic dynamics and the cultural and 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:05.850
 social quality 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.769
 the municipality is the designated party for the execution of local tasks 

00:02:11.309 --> 00:02:15.109
 precondition for the presentation of the provinces own profile is that 

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:19.729
 provinces as a fully-fledged autonomous administration and can perform tasks with 

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:23.579
 the game also council is legitimized middle management and own tax area 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:27.419
 and also the housekeeping that leaves room for bolton anp a regional 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:28.989
 to trade 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.440
 by operating a smart sharper mp with less administrative pressure 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:35.990
 and a clear job definition 

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:39.080
 we can double that but the Netherlands really has something to wear 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.099
 better governance at lower costs
