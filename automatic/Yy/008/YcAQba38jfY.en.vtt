00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
my screen for one of my mods I think

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.679 
my screen for one of my mods I think
it's<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.490> minimap<00:00:20.939> mod<00:00:21.240> but<00:00:21.510> not<00:00:21.539> positive

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:23.689 
it's the minimap mod but not positive

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.910 
it's the minimap mod but not positive
and<00:00:24.689> we<00:00:24.779> have<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> defeat<00:00:25.260> this<00:00:25.439> guy<00:00:25.650> and<00:00:25.859> I

and we have to defeat this guy and I

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.160 
and we have to defeat this guy and I
thought<00:00:26.099> that<00:00:26.279> I<00:00:26.369> would<00:00:26.430> record<00:00:26.849> it<00:00:27.000> just<00:00:27.990> in

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
thought that I would record it just in

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.390 
thought that I would record it just in
case<00:00:28.349> it's<00:00:28.529> a<00:00:28.560> little<00:00:28.650> bit<00:00:28.890> difficult<00:00:29.070> or

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
case it's a little bit difficult or

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.560 
case it's a little bit difficult or
anything<00:00:29.580> like<00:00:29.760> that<00:00:29.820> then<00:00:30.179> you<00:00:30.269> guys<00:00:30.420> might
