00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.230
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.600
 new video where I benefit that it is 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.000
 in the morning precisely to share with you 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.540
 a little yoga techniques helps to 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.950
 wake up well and if we have 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 also small pockets under the eyes 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.250
 in the morning it is very effective one finds 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.550
 in any case for me it was 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 so so that's so it's easy 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:25.109
 in fact you go so 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 rub both your hands like this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:30.109
 for a few seconds in 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.109
 widening your eyes 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:36.329
 that's it until your sleeves except 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.550
 once you feel hot 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.399
 you will put them on your eyes 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.809
 open and wide-eyed like these 

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:49.379
 up for 30 seconds 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:51.660
 1 2 3 1 30 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.699
 here and he was going to renew 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.360
 the operation a second time 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:00.149
 so by recruiting your hands well one 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:03.449
 against each other and we will redo the same 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.189
 neighborhoods look good to and 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:09.530
 30 seconds still 

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:11.540
 So that's the first step 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.640
 once you've done that already 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.310
 you must feel that it feels good 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.110
 I actually do it as soon as I get 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.149
 wake up in the morning so this is the first 

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:22.430
 thing I do is really help me 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:23.750
 even to get up done because I'm 

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.940
 sense of a more awake face 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.830
 so that's once you did 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.049
 it's then going to actually make 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.180
 rotations with the eyes that makes it 

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:35.780
 a lot of good too it's the gym of 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.250
 eyes so in fact we're going to look at it without 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.590
 move so well on the head 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:46.850
 we will look right 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:52.500
 then left right right left 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:54.149
 left and that ten times here and then 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.710
 we will do the same thing but in 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:02:02.539
 looking up and down 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.539
 so like this 2 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:12.060
 3 4 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:14.939
 you have to concentrate nevertheless why 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:20.150
 move your head so that's it said once 

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:20.150
 also diagonally like this 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:36.099
 so that ten times and then on the other 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:37.900
 diagonal as if I do not even know if 

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:41.140
 I move maybe a little bit I know 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.750
 not here and then to finish we go 

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:49.440
 actually do rotations so like 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:52.000
 that first on the right side 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.250
 we will go faster and faster 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.569
 will try to make 10 10 circle like 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:03:00.849
 that with our eyes once how there 

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:03.450
 we did that and after we know 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:03.450
 on the other side 

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:09.099
 so that's good for the 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.359
 concentration because suddenly bah 

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.280
 yeah we are well focused on this 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.569
 trophy 

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.180
 so here's the already you may have to 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:19.450
 feel a little difference anyway 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:23.620
 personally it makes me very good a 

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:25.599
 very good effect here after that if by 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:26.380
 example you regularly have 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:30.970
 bags under the eyes 

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:35.049
 I advise you to do this like this 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.819
 several times by pressing well under your 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.889
 eyes 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:44.380
 here is the tackle supported wellbienbien and also 

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:45.810
 after that you can pat for 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:48.700
 a few seconds 

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:51.960
 that's going to allow you to reactivate 

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:57.060
 in the lead cells under the eyes 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:59.310
 it revitalizes that and it goes you have 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:04.290
 do that then you can also think 

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:05.700
 skin like this here once you 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.880
 did all that normally you have to 

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:11.250
 really feel more awake 

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.630
 eyes so here I hope this 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:16.380
 little technique will have helped you that 

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:17.550
 ballack actually it's going to make a 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:19.380
 difference for you too 

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.350
 here we must not hesitate at the farm is 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.300
