hi this David Duke welcome to expert
village<00:00:02.700> in<00:00:03.000> this<00:00:03.840> next<00:00:03.899> clip<00:00:04.319> we<00:00:04.650> will<00:00:04.950> show

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
village in this next clip we will show

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.059 
village in this next clip we will show
how<00:00:05.970> you<00:00:06.029> control<00:00:06.540> the<00:00:06.690> glider<00:00:06.899> when<00:00:07.740> you're

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
how you control the glider when you're

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.430 
how you control the glider when you're
actually<00:00:08.280> flying<00:00:08.730> flying<00:00:09.630> you'd<00:00:10.050> be<00:00:10.230> in<00:00:10.320> this

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
actually flying flying you'd be in this

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:11.480 
actually flying flying you'd be in this
position<00:00:10.650> with<00:00:10.920> your<00:00:10.980> hands<00:00:11.160> down<00:00:11.340> on<00:00:11.460> the

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
position with your hands down on the

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.270 
position with your hands down on the
base<00:00:11.670> tube<00:00:11.910> this<00:00:12.809> is<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> weight-shift<00:00:13.530> glider

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
base tube this is a weight-shift glider

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.820 
base tube this is a weight-shift glider
all<00:00:14.849> of<00:00:15.150> my<00:00:15.269> weight<00:00:15.480> is<00:00:16.199> being<00:00:16.470> supported

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
all of my weight is being supported

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.390 
all of my weight is being supported
through<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.580> hips<00:00:17.900> right<00:00:18.900> up<00:00:19.109> into<00:00:19.320> the<00:00:19.650> CG<00:00:20.369> of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
through my hips right up into the CG of

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.099 
through my hips right up into the CG of
the<00:00:20.730> glider<00:00:20.970> the<00:00:21.210> center<00:00:21.510> of<00:00:21.630> gravity<00:00:21.990> of<00:00:22.050> the

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
the glider the center of gravity of the

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:24.439 
the glider the center of gravity of the
glider<00:00:22.350> so<00:00:22.859> the<00:00:22.949> glider<00:00:23.250> pivots<00:00:23.850> off<00:00:24.060> of<00:00:24.269> that

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
glider so the glider pivots off of that

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.990 
glider so the glider pivots off of that
point<00:00:24.720> by<00:00:25.529> shifting<00:00:26.369> my<00:00:26.430> way

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
point by shifting my way

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.540 
point by shifting my way
the<00:00:27.180> glider<00:00:27.470> wants<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:28.619> move<00:00:28.769> various

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
the glider wants to move various

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.519 
the glider wants to move various
directions<00:00:30.029> and<00:00:30.539> that's<00:00:30.720> how<00:00:30.869> I<00:00:30.929> how<00:00:31.470> I

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
directions and that's how I how I

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.530 
directions and that's how I how I
control<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.750> to<00:00:33.750> control<00:00:34.440> speed<00:00:35.430> we<00:00:36.120> control

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
control it to control speed we control

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.440 
control it to control speed we control
the<00:00:36.780> the<00:00:37.050> speed<00:00:37.860> at<00:00:37.980> which<00:00:38.010> we<00:00:38.190> dive<00:00:38.610> or<00:00:39.030> climb

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
the the speed at which we dive or climb

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:42.770 
the the speed at which we dive or climb
by<00:00:40.230> diving<00:00:40.950> more<00:00:41.309> I<00:00:41.579> put<00:00:42.180> my<00:00:42.300> weight<00:00:42.450> forward

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
by diving more I put my weight forward

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.750 
by diving more I put my weight forward
when<00:00:43.290> the<00:00:43.410> nose<00:00:43.590> gets<00:00:43.800> heavy<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.489> bladder

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:44.760 
when the nose gets heavy the bladder

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:47.240 
when the nose gets heavy the bladder
dives<00:00:45.059> that<00:00:45.600> picks<00:00:45.840> up<00:00:46.020> speed<00:00:46.140> just<00:00:47.070> like<00:00:47.219> a

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
dives that picks up speed just like a

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
dives that picks up speed just like a
kid<00:00:47.520> on<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.700> skateboard<00:00:48.090> going<00:00:48.539> downhill<00:00:48.780> with

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
kid on a skateboard going downhill with

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.290 
kid on a skateboard going downhill with
a<00:00:49.500> certain<00:00:49.829> amount<00:00:49.950> of<00:00:50.070> speed<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.550> can<00:00:50.730> then<00:00:50.969> go

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a certain amount of speed I can then go

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.689 
a certain amount of speed I can then go
up<00:00:51.539> a<00:00:51.840> certain<00:00:52.260> distance<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.219> push<00:00:53.520> my

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
up a certain distance so I push my

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:56.630 
up a certain distance so I push my
weight<00:00:53.940> back<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.840> I<00:00:55.110> can<00:00:55.350> climb<00:00:55.829> all<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.340> way

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
weight back and I can climb all the way

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
weight back and I can climb all the way
until<00:00:56.879> just<00:00:57.480> like<00:00:57.629> that<00:00:57.809> kid<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> run<00:00:58.379> out<00:00:58.530> of

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
until just like that kid I run out of

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.099 
until just like that kid I run out of
speed<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.100> at<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.820> top<00:01:00.059> before<00:01:00.629> you<00:01:00.840> start

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
speed and at the top before you start

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.810 
speed and at the top before you start
rolling<00:01:01.230> backwards<00:01:01.770> that's<00:01:01.980> called<00:01:02.219> stall<00:01:02.520> so

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:02.820 
rolling backwards that's called stall so

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:04.189 
rolling backwards that's called stall so
as<00:01:02.940> you<00:01:03.059> get<00:01:03.210> to<00:01:03.300> the<00:01:03.420> top<00:01:03.600> and<00:01:03.809> you<00:01:03.899> feel<00:01:04.049> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
as you get to the top and you feel the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.380 
as you get to the top and you feel the
glider<00:01:04.409> slowing<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.070> you<00:01:05.729> pull<00:01:05.970> in<00:01:06.150> back

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
glider slowing down you pull in back

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.690 
glider slowing down you pull in back
down<00:01:06.630> to<00:01:06.810> neutral<00:01:07.140> speed<00:01:07.590> and<00:01:07.950> you<00:01:08.070> fly<00:01:08.280> off<00:01:08.490> at

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
down to neutral speed and you fly off at

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:11.539 
down to neutral speed and you fly off at
your<00:01:08.820> new<00:01:08.939> altitude<00:01:09.119> to<00:01:10.049> turn<00:01:10.680> the<00:01:10.860> glider<00:01:11.070> you

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
your new altitude to turn the glider you

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:14.330 
your new altitude to turn the glider you
simply<00:01:12.030> load<00:01:12.780> one<00:01:13.439> of<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.619> wings<00:01:13.860> with<00:01:14.130> weight

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
simply load one of the wings with weight

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.429 
simply load one of the wings with weight
so<00:01:15.180> you<00:01:15.240> put<00:01:15.420> your<00:01:15.450> hip<00:01:15.750> over<00:01:15.930> here<00:01:16.200> where<00:01:16.350> your

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
so you put your hip over here where your

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.080 
so you put your hip over here where your
center<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> gravity<00:01:17.220> is<00:01:17.340> and<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.759> wing<00:01:17.939> gets

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
center of gravity is and that wing gets

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.300 
center of gravity is and that wing gets
heavy<00:01:18.360> and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.780> glider<00:01:19.020> turns<00:01:19.380> then<00:01:20.220> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
heavy and the glider turns then you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.149 
heavy and the glider turns then you
coordinate<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.000> turn<00:01:21.659> by<00:01:22.229> pushing<00:01:22.590> back<00:01:22.770> and

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
coordinate the turn by pushing back and

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.280 
coordinate the turn by pushing back and
the<00:01:23.250> glider<00:01:23.460> carves<00:01:23.970> through<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.270> turn<00:01:24.509> or<00:01:25.259> if

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
the glider carves through the turn or if

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.140 
the glider carves through the turn or if
you<00:01:25.770> need<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.130> you<00:01:26.220> can<00:01:26.310> pull<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.670> a<00:01:26.700> little<00:01:27.030> bit

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you need to you can pull in a little bit

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.969 
you need to you can pull in a little bit
and<00:01:27.270> adjust<00:01:27.330> your<00:01:27.810> speed<00:01:28.080> in<00:01:28.259> that<00:01:28.439> turn<00:01:28.650> until

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
and adjust your speed in that turn until

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.859 
and adjust your speed in that turn until
you've<00:01:29.189> achieved<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.820> perfect<00:01:30.150> Bank<00:01:30.600> and

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
you've achieved the perfect Bank and

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.719 
you've achieved the perfect Bank and
perfect<00:01:31.200> speed<00:01:31.439> for<00:01:31.740> that<00:01:31.829> Bank<00:01:32.070> okay<00:01:32.460> since

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
perfect speed for that Bank okay since

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.760 
perfect speed for that Bank okay since
this<00:01:32.909> is<00:01:33.060> a<00:01:33.090> weight<00:01:33.329> shift<00:01:33.360> glider<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.290> need<00:01:34.650> to

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:34.770 
this is a weight shift glider I need to

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.609 
this is a weight shift glider I need to
actually<00:01:35.130> move<00:01:35.340> the<00:01:35.400> center<00:01:36.090> of<00:01:36.119> my<00:01:36.329> mass<00:01:36.619> over

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
actually move the center of my mass over

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.850 
actually move the center of my mass over
to<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.280> side<00:01:38.310> or<00:01:39.000> not<00:01:39.180> but<00:01:40.049> I<00:01:40.200> was<00:01:40.409> just<00:01:40.650> to

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
to one side or not but I was just to

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.179 
to one side or not but I was just to
rotate<00:01:41.490> here<00:01:42.530> you<00:01:43.530> can<00:01:43.680> see<00:01:43.799> that<00:01:43.920> my<00:01:44.040> body

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
rotate here you can see that my body

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.310 
rotate here you can see that my body
does<00:01:44.549> my<00:01:44.850> body<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.210> comfortable<00:01:45.630> hanging<00:01:46.170> here

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
does my body is comfortable hanging here
