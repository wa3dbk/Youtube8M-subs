00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.500
 he deposits another eight hundred and seventy 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.230
 five reais and 50 cents and then takes out 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:19.169
 300 reais in cash with leftover 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.789
 your account then it starts with four 

00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:22.080
 thousand five hundred and twenty-two reais and 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.300
 eight cents 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.480
 Let's write this four thousand 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:32.730
 five hundred twenty-two reais and eight 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:34.920
 cents and then deposit or add 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 eight hundred and seventy-five 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.660
 real and 50 cents 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.480
 then it will add eight hundred and 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.400
 seventy-five reais and 50 cents 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.950
 When you make a deposit, you are 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.150
 adding or adding some value 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.550
 of this account 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:52.890
 in this case it does not add eight hundred and 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.780
 seventy-five reais and 50 cents 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 So how much does he have back home? 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:59.280
 cents or you can see that as 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:04.650
 hundredths a cent to a hundredth of 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.789
 real lets change the colors we have 8 + 0 to 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:14.009
 80 but 5 to 5 we got this one badly here two 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:15.990
 plus 5 and 7 2 plus 795 plus 8 and 13 

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:20.069
 put it three down here regroup 1 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.600
 11 or load 11 + 4 And 5 And then 

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:24.359
 the deposit of eight hundred and seventy 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.069
 five reais and 50 cents he has five 

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:27.630
 thousand and ninety-seven reais and 

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:32.850
 58 cents 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:34.979
 he withdraws 300 reais in cash or takes 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:39.740
 300 reais then we will have to subtract 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:42.990
 so the lÃ©o gets 300 reais 

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:46.109
 three hundred reais and I just add some 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.469
 years after the decimal 300 reais 

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:51.630
 three hundred reais is the same as 

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:59.609
 300.0 pill 0 cents and then 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:02:01.079
 we subtract 8 - 0 is 8 5 - 0 is 5 we have 

00:01:59.609 --> 00:02:09.659
 ours is bad here 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:12.000
 7 - 0 , and 79 - 93 0 to 30 and less then 5 - 

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.820
 nothing is 5 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:19.430
 so left in his account 5000 and 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.430
 ninety-seven reais and 58 cents
