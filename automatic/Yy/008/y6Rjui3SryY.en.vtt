and this is the first lesson of this new
series<00:00:19.010> there's<00:00:19.430> not<00:00:19.580> a<00:00:19.609> whole<00:00:19.820> lot<00:00:19.850> of<00:00:20.000> plants

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.420 
series there's not a whole lot of plants

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:21.910 
series there's not a whole lot of plants
going<00:00:20.660> on<00:00:20.779> behind<00:00:20.960> me<00:00:21.260> because<00:00:21.530> it's<00:00:21.710> still

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:21.920 
going on behind me because it's still

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.340 
going on behind me because it's still
early<00:00:22.130> spring<00:00:22.640> but<00:00:23.540> that's<00:00:23.690> okay<00:00:24.020> because<00:00:24.050> the

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:24.350 
early spring but that's okay because the

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:26.350 
early spring but that's okay because the
first<00:00:24.560> lesson<00:00:24.890> always<00:00:25.070> has<00:00:25.370> to<00:00:25.550> be<00:00:25.580> about<00:00:25.820> soil

00:00:26.350 --> 00:00:26.360 
first lesson always has to be about soil

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.660 
first lesson always has to be about soil
anyway<00:00:26.960> and<00:00:27.200> the<00:00:27.800> thing<00:00:28.039> I<00:00:28.160> really<00:00:28.460> like<00:00:28.640> to

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:28.670 
anyway and the thing I really like to

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.090 
anyway and the thing I really like to
always<00:00:29.060> start<00:00:29.330> talking<00:00:29.720> about<00:00:29.960> is<00:00:30.140> what<00:00:30.980> is

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.100 
always start talking about is what is

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:34.389 
always start talking about is what is
soil<00:00:31.369> made<00:00:31.760> of<00:00:31.970> how<00:00:32.930> does<00:00:33.170> it<00:00:33.320> form<00:00:33.739> just<00:00:34.250> a

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399 
soil made of how does it form just a

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.279 
soil made of how does it form just a
quick<00:00:34.640> look<00:00:34.910> at<00:00:35.059> this<00:00:35.300> because<00:00:35.539> soil<00:00:35.989> isn't

00:00:36.279 --> 00:00:36.289 
quick look at this because soil isn't

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:39.610 
quick look at this because soil isn't
given<00:00:36.770> the<00:00:36.980> respect<00:00:37.399> it<00:00:37.789> deserves<00:00:38.359> in<00:00:39.260> a<00:00:39.409> lot

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:39.620 
given the respect it deserves in a lot

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:41.709 
given the respect it deserves in a lot
of<00:00:39.769> circles<00:00:40.219> certainly<00:00:41.089> in<00:00:41.300> organic

00:00:41.709 --> 00:00:41.719 
of circles certainly in organic

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.029 
of circles certainly in organic
gardening<00:00:42.109> we<00:00:42.260> think<00:00:42.559> of<00:00:42.679> it<00:00:42.800> a<00:00:42.890> lot

00:00:43.029 --> 00:00:43.039 
gardening we think of it a lot

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.709 
gardening we think of it a lot
differently<00:00:43.460> let's<00:00:43.760> have<00:00:44.030> a<00:00:44.149> look<00:00:44.390> at<00:00:44.600> our

00:00:44.709 --> 00:00:44.719 
differently let's have a look at our

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:46.719 
differently let's have a look at our
soil<00:00:45.019> here<00:00:45.350> it's<00:00:45.679> got<00:00:45.800> a<00:00:45.829> drink<00:00:46.100> my<00:00:46.190> tea<00:00:46.249> before

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:46.729 
soil here it's got a drink my tea before

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:50.649 
soil here it's got a drink my tea before
it<00:00:46.789> gets<00:00:46.909> too<00:00:47.059> cold<00:00:47.210> so<00:00:48.789> how<00:00:49.789> does<00:00:49.850> soil<00:00:50.269> form

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:50.659 
it gets too cold so how does soil form

00:00:50.659 --> 00:00:53.829 
it gets too cold so how does soil form
soil<00:00:51.499> forms<00:00:51.949> from<00:00:52.550> rock<00:00:52.819> it<00:00:53.120> starts<00:00:53.449> as<00:00:53.569> rock

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:53.839 
soil forms from rock it starts as rock

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:56.139 
soil forms from rock it starts as rock
and<00:00:54.109> then<00:00:54.350> over<00:00:54.679> thousands<00:00:55.249> of<00:00:55.339> years<00:00:55.670> you

00:00:56.139 --> 00:00:56.149 
and then over thousands of years you

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.110 
and then over thousands of years you
have<00:00:56.359> wind<00:00:57.309> coming<00:00:58.309> in<00:00:58.429> you<00:00:58.609> have<00:00:58.760> rain<00:00:59.089> coming

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
have wind coming in you have rain coming

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.539 
have wind coming in you have rain coming
down<00:00:59.749> you<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.350> chemical<00:01:00.739> reactions<00:01:01.370> that

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:01.549 
down you have chemical reactions that

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:03.610 
down you have chemical reactions that
occur<00:01:01.670> and<00:01:02.089> you<00:01:02.449> have<00:01:02.569> temperature<00:01:03.109> changes

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
occur and you have temperature changes

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.770 
occur and you have temperature changes
freezing<00:01:04.549> and<00:01:04.699> thawing<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.479> hot

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 
freezing and thawing and hot

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.510 
freezing and thawing and hot
temperatures<00:01:06.320> and<00:01:06.500> gradually<00:01:07.280> it<00:01:07.370> gets

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:07.520 
temperatures and gradually it gets

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.249 
temperatures and gradually it gets
broken<00:01:07.760> down<00:01:08.090> a<00:01:08.390> lot<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.750> this<00:01:08.899> is<00:01:09.020> very

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
broken down a lot of this is very

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:11.410 
broken down a lot of this is very
physical<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.009> mechanical<00:01:10.189> a<00:01:10.820> little<00:01:11.240> bit<00:01:11.329> of

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:11.420 
physical and mechanical a little bit of

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.179 
physical and mechanical a little bit of
chemical<00:01:11.810> -<00:01:11.990> but<00:01:12.590> the<00:01:12.680> thing<00:01:12.710> that<00:01:12.950> doesn't

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:13.189 
chemical - but the thing that doesn't

00:01:13.189 --> 00:01:15.310 
chemical - but the thing that doesn't
get<00:01:13.280> talked<00:01:13.490> about<00:01:13.700> as<00:01:13.820> much<00:01:14.030> is<00:01:14.240> the<00:01:14.899> biology

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320 
get talked about as much is the biology

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.190 
get talked about as much is the biology
so<00:01:16.280> the<00:01:16.399> biology<00:01:16.579> is<00:01:17.180> when<00:01:17.360> plants<00:01:17.899> start<00:01:18.170> to

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:18.200 
so the biology is when plants start to

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.080 
so the biology is when plants start to
come<00:01:18.439> in<00:01:18.649> there's<00:01:19.009> just<00:01:19.369> enough<00:01:19.610> soil<00:01:19.880> that

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.090 
come in there's just enough soil that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:21.849 
come in there's just enough soil that
little<00:01:20.420> plants<00:01:20.750> can<00:01:20.899> come<00:01:21.049> in<00:01:21.229> and<00:01:21.380> little

00:01:21.849 --> 00:01:21.859 
little plants can come in and little

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:23.920 
little plants can come in and little
microorganisms<00:01:22.729> come<00:01:22.939> in<00:01:23.090> and<00:01:23.270> they<00:01:23.689> work

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:23.930 
microorganisms come in and they work

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:26.889 
microorganisms come in and they work
together<00:01:24.140> often<00:01:24.590> to<00:01:25.310> start<00:01:26.119> to<00:01:26.270> produce<00:01:26.479> even

00:01:26.889 --> 00:01:26.899 
together often to start to produce even

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:29.020 
together often to start to produce even
better<00:01:27.079> soil<00:01:27.710> and<00:01:27.979> soil<00:01:28.430> that<00:01:28.579> has<00:01:28.729> a<00:01:28.759> little

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
better soil and soil that has a little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.819 
better soil and soil that has a little
bit<00:01:29.090> of<00:01:29.210> organic<00:01:29.450> matter<00:01:29.810> in<00:01:30.020> there<00:01:30.259> and<00:01:30.439> so

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:30.829 
bit of organic matter in there and so

00:01:30.829 --> 00:01:32.590 
bit of organic matter in there and so
that<00:01:31.009> part<00:01:31.369> is<00:01:31.490> really<00:01:31.759> important<00:01:32.210> and<00:01:32.329> that's

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.600 
that part is really important and that's

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.959 
that part is really important and that's
what<00:01:32.930> we<00:01:33.049> talk<00:01:33.200> about<00:01:33.229> in<00:01:33.560> organic<00:01:33.950> garden<00:01:34.280> now

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:34.969 
what we talk about in organic garden now

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:36.459 
what we talk about in organic garden now
why<00:01:35.119> I<00:01:35.149> want<00:01:35.570> to<00:01:35.630> talk<00:01:35.780> about<00:01:35.990> it<00:01:36.079> today<00:01:36.170> is<00:01:36.380> I

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:36.469 
why I want to talk about it today is I

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:38.050 
why I want to talk about it today is I
just<00:01:36.619> want<00:01:36.799> to<00:01:36.859> get<00:01:37.009> inside<00:01:37.429> all<00:01:37.579> of<00:01:37.609> our<00:01:37.820> heads

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
just want to get inside all of our heads

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.149 
just want to get inside all of our heads
that<00:01:38.329> we're<00:01:39.079> talking<00:01:39.380> about<00:01:39.469> soil<00:01:39.950> as<00:01:40.130> a

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
that we're talking about soil as a

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:42.429 
that we're talking about soil as a
vibrant<00:01:40.670> community<00:01:40.880> its<00:01:41.659> chemical<00:01:42.259> its

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:42.439 
vibrant community its chemical its

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:44.919 
vibrant community its chemical its
physical<00:01:42.950> it's<00:01:43.130> also<00:01:43.340> very<00:01:43.789> biological<00:01:44.570> so

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:44.929 
physical it's also very biological so

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:47.109 
physical it's also very biological so
that's<00:01:45.109> what<00:01:45.289> we<00:01:45.409> look<00:01:45.560> at<00:01:45.710> now<00:01:45.920> today<00:01:46.280> I<00:01:46.579> kind

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:47.119 
that's what we look at now today I kind

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:48.609 
that's what we look at now today I kind
of<00:01:47.149> want<00:01:47.329> to<00:01:47.359> just<00:01:47.420> look<00:01:47.689> briefly<00:01:47.929> at<00:01:48.109> the<00:01:48.409> soil

00:01:48.609 --> 00:01:48.619 
of want to just look briefly at the soil

00:01:48.619 --> 00:01:50.560 
of want to just look briefly at the soil
texture<00:01:49.219> and<00:01:49.579> what<00:01:49.729> that<00:01:49.880> really<00:01:50.060> means<00:01:50.299> is

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.570 
texture and what that really means is

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:53.590 
texture and what that really means is
the<00:01:50.719> proportion<00:01:51.679> of<00:01:51.799> sand<00:01:52.249> silt<00:01:52.670> and<00:01:52.909> clay<00:01:52.999> in

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:53.600 
the proportion of sand silt and clay in

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.179 
the proportion of sand silt and clay in
your<00:01:53.749> soil<00:01:53.960> because<00:01:54.380> mostly<00:01:54.890> that's<00:01:54.979> what

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:55.189 
your soil because mostly that's what

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:57.489 
your soil because mostly that's what
soil<00:01:55.490> is<00:01:55.759> the<00:01:56.210> rock<00:01:56.450> gets<00:01:56.719> broken<00:01:56.960> down<00:01:57.109> into

00:01:57.489 --> 00:01:57.499 
soil is the rock gets broken down into

00:01:57.499 --> 00:01:59.859 
soil is the rock gets broken down into
sand<00:01:57.890> which<00:01:58.130> is<00:01:58.249> pretty<00:01:58.429> big<00:01:58.729> silt<00:01:59.509> which<00:01:59.719> is

00:01:59.859 --> 00:01:59.869 
sand which is pretty big silt which is

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:01.510 
sand which is pretty big silt which is
smaller<00:02:00.170> and<00:02:00.439> clay<00:02:00.740> which<00:02:00.920> is<00:02:00.950> really<00:02:01.310> really

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:01.520 
smaller and clay which is really really

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.309 
smaller and clay which is really really
tiny<00:02:01.729> so<00:02:02.299> what<00:02:02.450> you<00:02:02.539> do<00:02:02.659> is<00:02:02.810> you<00:02:02.899> try<00:02:03.020> to<00:02:03.079> get<00:02:03.289> a

00:02:03.309 --> 00:02:03.319 
tiny so what you do is you try to get a

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:05.709 
tiny so what you do is you try to get a
little<00:02:03.530> bit<00:02:03.619> of<00:02:03.710> soil<00:02:04.030> maybe<00:02:05.030> like<00:02:05.210> a<00:02:05.240> third<00:02:05.569> of

00:02:05.709 --> 00:02:05.719 
little bit of soil maybe like a third of

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:07.719 
little bit of soil maybe like a third of
a<00:02:05.780> cup<00:02:06.219> into<00:02:07.219> your<00:02:07.340> hand

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:07.729 
a cup into your hand

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.140 
a cup into your hand
take<00:02:08.660> out<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:08.899> organic<00:02:09.350> debris<00:02:10.090> try<00:02:11.090> to

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:11.150 
take out the organic debris try to

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.790 
take out the organic debris try to
squeeze<00:02:11.390> it<00:02:11.540> into<00:02:11.660> a<00:02:11.750> ball<00:02:11.990> and<00:02:12.020> then<00:02:12.380> roll<00:02:12.650> it

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
squeeze it into a ball and then roll it

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.890 
squeeze it into a ball and then roll it
out<00:02:12.920> into<00:02:13.070> a<00:02:13.160> cylinder<00:02:13.610> and<00:02:13.850> the<00:02:14.450> more<00:02:14.660> you<00:02:14.780> can

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:14.900 
out into a cylinder and the more you can

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.630 
out into a cylinder and the more you can
do<00:02:15.020> that<00:02:15.200> the<00:02:15.350> more<00:02:15.380> silt<00:02:15.830> and<00:02:15.980> clay<00:02:16.040> you<00:02:16.310> have

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:16.640 
do that the more silt and clay you have

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:18.310 
do that the more silt and clay you have
if<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.240> doesn't<00:02:17.480> hardly<00:02:17.690> squeeze<00:02:18.050> into

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320 
if it doesn't hardly squeeze into

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.760 
if it doesn't hardly squeeze into
anything

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:18.770 
anything

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.760 
anything
you<00:02:18.830> have<00:02:18.950> a<00:02:18.980> really<00:02:19.220> sandy<00:02:19.460> soil<00:02:20.350> my<00:02:21.350> mic<00:02:21.560> just

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:21.770 
you have a really sandy soil my mic just

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.460 
you have a really sandy soil my mic just
fell<00:02:21.950> off<00:02:22.780> check<00:02:23.780> check<00:02:24.020> check

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470 
fell off check check check

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.130 
fell off check check check
okay<00:02:24.860> we're<00:02:25.040> still<00:02:25.190> going<00:02:25.340> so<00:02:25.880> the<00:02:26.780> texture

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
okay we're still going so the texture

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.110 
okay we're still going so the texture
influences<00:02:27.920> the<00:02:28.040> structure<00:02:28.490> and<00:02:28.670> what<00:02:29.030> the

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:29.120 
influences the structure and what the

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.760 
influences the structure and what the
structure<00:02:29.540> is<00:02:29.570> is<00:02:29.900> how<00:02:30.020> your<00:02:30.200> soil<00:02:30.440> kind<00:02:30.710> of

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
structure is is how your soil kind of

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:33.100 
structure is is how your soil kind of
crumbles<00:02:31.220> how<00:02:31.640> it<00:02:31.820> stays<00:02:32.150> together<00:02:32.390> a<00:02:32.750> really

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:33.110 
crumbles how it stays together a really

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.350 
crumbles how it stays together a really
sandy<00:02:33.710> soil<00:02:33.920> texture<00:02:34.430> doesn't<00:02:34.940> stay<00:02:35.060> together

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:35.360 
sandy soil texture doesn't stay together

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:37.120 
sandy soil texture doesn't stay together
very<00:02:35.600> well<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:35.960> kind<00:02:36.110> of<00:02:36.170> falls<00:02:36.350> apart<00:02:36.530> it

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:37.130 
very well it kind of falls apart it

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.920 
very well it kind of falls apart it
allows<00:02:37.400> a<00:02:37.430> lot<00:02:37.550> of<00:02:37.700> air<00:02:37.940> in<00:02:38.000> there<00:02:38.480> but<00:02:38.840> doesn't

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
allows a lot of air in there but doesn't

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.930 
allows a lot of air in there but doesn't
hold<00:02:39.200> water<00:02:39.440> very<00:02:39.770> well<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.190> that<00:02:40.220> influences

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
hold water very well so that influences

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:43.630 
hold water very well so that influences
how<00:02:41.030> you<00:02:41.060> water<00:02:41.420> a<00:02:41.690> heavy<00:02:42.170> clay<00:02:42.530> soil<00:02:42.890> holds

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
how you water a heavy clay soil holds

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.190 
how you water a heavy clay soil holds
plenty<00:02:43.850> of<00:02:44.150> water<00:02:44.360> which<00:02:44.600> is<00:02:44.720> great<00:02:44.900> but

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
plenty of water which is great but

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.600 
plenty of water which is great but
doesn't<00:02:45.470> hold<00:02:45.590> that<00:02:45.740> much<00:02:45.920> air<00:02:46.190> so<00:02:46.430> you<00:02:46.490> have

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
doesn't hold that much air so you have

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.490 
doesn't hold that much air so you have
to<00:02:46.730> think<00:02:46.940> about<00:02:47.030> that<00:02:47.300> also<00:02:47.960> influences<00:02:48.470> how

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
to think about that also influences how

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.620 
to think about that also influences how
you<00:02:48.650> water<00:02:48.950> both<00:02:49.640> of<00:02:49.880> them<00:02:50.000> influence<00:02:50.300> how<00:02:50.570> you

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
you water both of them influence how you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.910 
you water both of them influence how you
fertilize<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.440> we're<00:02:51.530> going<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.710> be<00:02:51.770> talking

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:51.920 
fertilize and we're going to be talking

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.470 
fertilize and we're going to be talking
about<00:02:52.070> a<00:02:52.190> lot<00:02:52.640> about<00:02:52.700> fertilizer

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
about a lot about fertilizer

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.260 
about a lot about fertilizer
the<00:02:54.200> cool<00:02:54.560> thing<00:02:54.890> is<00:02:54.940> even<00:02:55.940> if<00:02:56.030> you<00:02:56.120> have<00:02:56.150> a

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the cool thing is even if you have a

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.200 
the cool thing is even if you have a
very<00:02:56.630> sandy<00:02:57.170> soil<00:02:57.440> or<00:02:57.650> a<00:02:57.770> very<00:02:58.220> high<00:02:58.460> clay<00:02:58.850> soil

00:02:59.200 --> 00:02:59.210 
very sandy soil or a very high clay soil

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:00.970 
very sandy soil or a very high clay soil
there's<00:02:59.780> something<00:03:00.110> that<00:03:00.140> can<00:03:00.380> moderate<00:03:00.950> that

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:00.980 
there's something that can moderate that

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.270 
there's something that can moderate that
and<00:03:01.520> that<00:03:02.060> is<00:03:02.240> organic<00:03:02.480> matter<00:03:03.230> so<00:03:03.950> here<00:03:04.160> we

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:04.280 
and that is organic matter so here we

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.120 
and that is organic matter so here we
have<00:03:04.490> leaves<00:03:05.360> that<00:03:05.900> make<00:03:06.380> the<00:03:06.620> best<00:03:06.830> mulch

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
have leaves that make the best mulch

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:09.280 
have leaves that make the best mulch
ever<00:03:07.430> we<00:03:07.970> have<00:03:08.090> straw<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.810> makes<00:03:08.990> a<00:03:09.080> pretty

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
ever we have straw that makes a pretty

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:12.040 
ever we have straw that makes a pretty
darn<00:03:09.500> good<00:03:09.620> milk<00:03:09.920> to<00:03:10.190> in<00:03:10.610> here<00:03:11.240> I<00:03:11.270> have<00:03:11.480> compost

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:12.050 
darn good milk to in here I have compost

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:14.260 
darn good milk to in here I have compost
that<00:03:12.410> I<00:03:12.440> put<00:03:12.710> in<00:03:12.890> last<00:03:13.070> year<00:03:13.460> and<00:03:13.880> all<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.210> these

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:14.270 
that I put in last year and all of these

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.000 
that I put in last year and all of these
things<00:03:14.510> are<00:03:14.630> going<00:03:14.720> to<00:03:14.810> serve<00:03:15.020> to<00:03:15.350> really

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
things are going to serve to really

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:18.490 
things are going to serve to really
moderate<00:03:16.640> those<00:03:16.760> extremes<00:03:17.270> so<00:03:17.780> if<00:03:17.900> I<00:03:17.990> get<00:03:18.140> that

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:18.500 
moderate those extremes so if I get that

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.140 
moderate those extremes so if I get that
if<00:03:18.650> I<00:03:18.770> get<00:03:18.950> organic<00:03:19.220> matter<00:03:19.580> in<00:03:19.760> there<00:03:19.910> get

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.150 
if I get organic matter in there get

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.870 
if I get organic matter in there get
houmous<00:03:20.630> building<00:03:20.990> in<00:03:21.080> the<00:03:21.170> soil<00:03:21.640> if<00:03:22.640> I<00:03:22.670> have<00:03:22.820> a

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
houmous building in the soil if I have a

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:25.690 
houmous building in the soil if I have a
sandy<00:03:23.360> soil<00:03:23.390> which<00:03:24.350> I<00:03:24.500> don't<00:03:24.560> have<00:03:24.770> here<00:03:24.890> it's

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
sandy soil which I don't have here it's

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.550 
sandy soil which I don't have here it's
going<00:03:25.910> to<00:03:25.970> help<00:03:26.090> that<00:03:26.360> soil<00:03:26.630> to<00:03:27.050> hold<00:03:27.230> a<00:03:27.410> lot

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:27.560 
going to help that soil to hold a lot

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.500 
going to help that soil to hold a lot
more<00:03:27.590> water<00:03:28.010> and<00:03:28.370> hold<00:03:28.610> a<00:03:28.700> lot<00:03:28.730> more<00:03:28.880> nutrition

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
more water and hold a lot more nutrition

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:30.970 
more water and hold a lot more nutrition
because<00:03:29.660> sand<00:03:29.990> does<00:03:30.170> not<00:03:30.320> hold<00:03:30.560> nutrients

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980 
because sand does not hold nutrients

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:32.920 
because sand does not hold nutrients
very<00:03:31.190> well<00:03:31.370> at<00:03:31.520> all<00:03:31.640> if<00:03:32.090> I<00:03:32.240> have<00:03:32.330> a<00:03:32.390> clay<00:03:32.660> soil

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
very well at all if I have a clay soil

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.960 
very well at all if I have a clay soil
getting<00:03:33.800> that<00:03:33.920> organic<00:03:34.340> matter<00:03:34.459> in<00:03:34.700> there<00:03:34.880> is

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
getting that organic matter in there is

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.430 
getting that organic matter in there is
going<00:03:35.090> to<00:03:35.150> allow<00:03:35.390> it<00:03:35.450> to<00:03:35.540> get<00:03:35.959> more<00:03:36.170> air

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:36.440 
going to allow it to get more air

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:38.080 
going to allow it to get more air
because<00:03:36.920> the<00:03:37.040> roots<00:03:37.250> need<00:03:37.490> air<00:03:37.670> and<00:03:37.700> the<00:03:37.880> soil

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.090 
because the roots need air and the soil

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.030 
because the roots need air and the soil
food<00:03:38.330> web<00:03:38.390> needs<00:03:38.720> air<00:03:39.050> it's<00:03:39.560> going<00:03:39.709> to<00:03:39.800> allow

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:40.040 
food web needs air it's going to allow

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.390 
food web needs air it's going to allow
it<00:03:40.220> to<00:03:40.250> resist<00:03:41.120> compaction<00:03:41.930> too<00:03:42.200> and<00:03:43.070> you<00:03:43.280> know

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
it to resist compaction too and you know

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.530 
it to resist compaction too and you know
there's<00:03:43.760> so<00:03:43.910> many<00:03:44.000> other<00:03:44.240> things<00:03:44.420> that

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:44.540 
there's so many other things that

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.390 
there's so many other things that
organic<00:03:44.900> matter<00:03:44.990> does<00:03:45.260> resisting<00:03:45.800> erosion

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
organic matter does resisting erosion

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.460 
organic matter does resisting erosion
providing<00:03:46.880> nutrients<00:03:47.840> all<00:03:47.959> kinds<00:03:48.260> of<00:03:48.320> cool

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
providing nutrients all kinds of cool

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:50.020 
providing nutrients all kinds of cool
stuff<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.920> we<00:03:49.310> really<00:03:49.730> are<00:03:49.820> going<00:03:49.910> to<00:03:49.970> be

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:50.030 
stuff so we really are going to be

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:51.400 
stuff so we really are going to be
talking<00:03:50.240> about<00:03:50.390> organic<00:03:50.959> matter<00:03:51.140> a<00:03:51.230> lot

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.410 
talking about organic matter a lot

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.290 
talking about organic matter a lot
during<00:03:51.770> this<00:03:51.860> course<00:03:52.100> so<00:03:52.730> that<00:03:52.760> is<00:03:53.030> just<00:03:53.180> a

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300 
during this course so that is just a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.630 
during this course so that is just a
little<00:03:53.570> introduction<00:03:54.020> to<00:03:54.260> soil<00:03:54.620> all<00:03:55.160> I<00:03:55.220> really

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
little introduction to soil all I really

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.860 
little introduction to soil all I really
want<00:03:55.790> to<00:03:55.880> get<00:03:55.970> across<00:03:56.150> what<00:03:56.450> I'm<00:03:56.540> talking

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
want to get across what I'm talking

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.050 
want to get across what I'm talking
about<00:03:57.020> soil<00:03:57.310> early<00:03:58.310> on<00:03:58.459> is<00:03:58.730> just<00:03:58.940> how

00:03:59.050 --> 00:03:59.060 
about soil early on is just how

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.090 
about soil early on is just how
important<00:03:59.600> it<00:03:59.690> is<00:03:59.750> for<00:03:59.870> the<00:04:00.200> garden<00:04:00.530> and<00:04:00.680> how

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.100 
important it is for the garden and how

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:02.830 
important it is for the garden and how
we<00:04:01.490> can<00:04:01.640> learn<00:04:01.850> a<00:04:01.910> lot<00:04:02.120> about<00:04:02.240> our<00:04:02.420> soil<00:04:02.660> by

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
we can learn a lot about our soil by

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.540 
we can learn a lot about our soil by
digging<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.350> it<00:04:03.440> we're<00:04:03.800> going<00:04:03.950> to<00:04:04.010> be<00:04:04.100> focusing

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:04.550 
digging in it we're going to be focusing

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:06.370 
digging in it we're going to be focusing
on<00:04:04.700> increasing<00:04:05.060> organic<00:04:05.630> matter<00:04:05.840> increasing

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
on increasing organic matter increasing

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.930 
on increasing organic matter increasing
minerals<00:04:06.860> improving<00:04:07.340> the<00:04:07.430> soil<00:04:07.580> food<00:04:07.880> web

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:07.940 
minerals improving the soil food web

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.730 
minerals improving the soil food web
it's<00:04:08.600> going<00:04:08.750> to<00:04:08.810> be<00:04:08.900> physics<00:04:09.380> and<00:04:09.560> chemistry

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:09.740 
it's going to be physics and chemistry

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:12.190 
it's going to be physics and chemistry
and<00:04:10.040> biology<00:04:10.310> and<00:04:10.910> all<00:04:11.390> of<00:04:11.540> this<00:04:11.630> is<00:04:11.780> so

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:12.200 
and biology and all of this is so

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.510 
and biology and all of this is so
important<00:04:12.620> to<00:04:12.650> have<00:04:12.830> healthy<00:04:12.980> flowers

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:13.520 
important to have healthy flowers

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:15.370 
important to have healthy flowers
healthy<00:04:13.820> trees<00:04:14.060> and<00:04:14.420> especially<00:04:15.140> for

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
healthy trees and especially for

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.900 
healthy trees and especially for
nutrient-dense<00:04:15.860> food<00:04:16.340> which<00:04:16.549> is<00:04:16.580> what<00:04:16.760> I'm

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:16.910 
nutrient-dense food which is what I'm

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.870 
nutrient-dense food which is what I'm
really<00:04:17.690> interested<00:04:17.870> in<00:04:18.169> and<00:04:18.410> I<00:04:19.190> got<00:04:19.700> into<00:04:19.850> a

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:19.880 
really interested in and I got into a

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.310 
really interested in and I got into a
