do is try and make as few of passes in
the<00:03:50.230> field<00:03:50.470> as<00:03:50.620> possible<00:03:51.450> so<00:03:52.450> on<00:03:52.630> the<00:03:52.780> wings<00:03:52.990> we

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
the field as possible so on the wings we

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.770 
the field as possible so on the wings we
have<00:03:53.470> herbicide<00:03:54.040> tanks<00:03:54.550> so<00:03:55.240> we<00:03:55.390> can<00:03:55.570> spray

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
have herbicide tanks so we can spray

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.330 
have herbicide tanks so we can spray
herbicide<00:03:56.700> through<00:03:57.700> the<00:03:57.790> field<00:03:59.040> the<00:04:00.040> front

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
herbicide through the field the front

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.250 
herbicide through the field the front
tank<00:04:00.610> is<00:04:00.850> for<00:04:01.410> 10:34<00:04:02.410> oh<00:04:02.640> and<00:04:03.640> so<00:04:03.940> we<00:04:04.150> put<00:04:04.420> 10:34

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
tank is for 10:34 oh and so we put 10:34

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:08.520 
tank is for 10:34 oh and so we put 10:34
on<00:04:05.470> with<00:04:06.270> the<00:04:07.270> big<00:04:07.450> tank<00:04:07.750> is<00:04:07.930> for<00:04:08.170> nitrogen

I'm in agreement with ANCA we're working

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:50.100 
I'm in agreement with ANCA we're working
on<00:05:48.430> new<00:05:48.610> stuff<00:05:48.670> and<00:05:49.270> this<00:05:49.660> year<00:05:49.930> we've

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:50.110 
on new stuff and this year we've

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.860 
on new stuff and this year we've
incorporated<00:05:50.610> the<00:05:51.610> liquid<00:05:52.000> controls<00:05:52.480> into

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:52.870 
incorporated the liquid controls into

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.410 
incorporated the liquid controls into
the<00:05:52.960> planner<00:05:53.200> monitor<00:05:54.030> versus<00:05:55.030> having

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:55.420 
the planner monitor versus having

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.230 
the planner monitor versus having
multiple<00:05:55.870> monitors<00:05:56.290> last<00:05:56.590> year<00:05:56.920> the<00:05:57.550> way<00:05:57.700> most

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:58.240 
multiple monitors last year the way most

00:05:58.240 --> 00:06:00.900 
multiple monitors last year the way most
people<00:05:58.420> do<00:05:58.840> it<00:05:58.990> and<00:05:59.440> that's<00:05:59.980> been<00:06:00.220> a<00:06:00.250> huge<00:06:00.310> step

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:00.910 
people do it and that's been a huge step

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:03.390 
people do it and that's been a huge step
because<00:06:01.390> that<00:06:02.110> way<00:06:02.350> when<00:06:02.590> you<00:06:02.710> turn<00:06:02.950> the

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:03.400 
because that way when you turn the

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:05.130 
because that way when you turn the
planner<00:06:03.670> on<00:06:03.910> you're<00:06:04.450> turning<00:06:04.780> all<00:06:04.930> your

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:05.140 
planner on you're turning all your

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:07.020 
planner on you're turning all your
liquids<00:06:05.320> on<00:06:05.650> and<00:06:05.920> what<00:06:06.040> it<00:06:06.160> turns<00:06:06.400> off<00:06:06.700> it

00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:07.030 
liquids on and what it turns off it

00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:10.470 
liquids on and what it turns off it
turns<00:06:07.720> off<00:06:08.080> it's<00:06:08.860> all<00:06:09.100> integrated<00:06:09.370> it<00:06:10.270> knows

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:10.480 
turns off it's all integrated it knows

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:13.080 
turns off it's all integrated it knows
what<00:06:10.750> rows<00:06:11.020> you're<00:06:11.230> planning<00:06:11.740> the<00:06:12.700> punches

00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:13.090 
what rows you're planning the punches

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:16.260 
what rows you're planning the punches
are<00:06:13.240> on<00:06:13.890> we've<00:06:14.890> had<00:06:15.070> no<00:06:15.310> trouble<00:06:15.670> with<00:06:16.060> it

talking to each other like when you have
multiple<00:06:18.700> monitors<00:06:19.360> you<00:06:19.540> have<00:06:19.660> to<00:06:19.780> get<00:06:19.930> one

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:20.110 
multiple monitors you have to get one

00:06:20.110 --> 00:06:21.900 
multiple monitors you have to get one
monitor<00:06:20.530> to<00:06:20.710> talk<00:06:20.950> to<00:06:21.160> the<00:06:21.280> other<00:06:21.490> and<00:06:21.760> that

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:21.910 
monitor to talk to the other and that

00:06:21.910 --> 00:06:23.820 
monitor to talk to the other and that
was<00:06:22.090> problematic<00:06:22.630> last<00:06:23.020> year<00:06:23.260> to<00:06:23.410> a<00:06:23.440> certain

to<00:06:31.780> have<00:06:33.000> airbags<00:06:34.170> that<00:06:35.170> were<00:06:35.380> automatically

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:36.010 
to have airbags that were automatically

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:38.850 
to have airbags that were automatically
controlling<00:06:36.520> my<00:06:36.790> down<00:06:37.030> pressure<00:06:37.390> our<00:06:38.380> soils

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:38.860 
controlling my down pressure our soils

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:41.190 
controlling my down pressure our soils
here<00:06:39.130> quite<00:06:39.640> variable<00:06:40.060> in<00:06:40.420> the<00:06:40.780> field<00:06:41.020> that

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:41.200 
here quite variable in the field that

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.660 
here quite variable in the field that
we're<00:06:41.380> in<00:06:41.440> right<00:06:41.650> now<00:06:41.710> is<00:06:42.040> probably<00:06:42.190> one<00:06:42.460> of<00:06:42.490> my

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670 
we're in right now is probably one of my

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.000 
we're in right now is probably one of my
more<00:06:42.850> consistent<00:06:43.510> wheels<00:06:43.810> as<00:06:43.990> far<00:06:44.260> as<00:06:44.410> the

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:45.010 
more consistent wheels as far as the

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.600 
more consistent wheels as far as the
type<00:06:45.250> of<00:06:45.280> soil<00:06:45.700> from<00:06:46.000> one<00:06:46.240> end

00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:46.610 
type of soil from one end

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:50.230 
type of soil from one end
but<00:06:47.479> I<00:06:47.509> feels<00:06:48.050> were<00:06:48.319> at<00:06:49.129> one<00:06:49.310> corner<00:06:49.639> the<00:06:49.879> soil

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240 
but I feels were at one corner the soil

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:53.710 
but I feels were at one corner the soil
is<00:06:50.379> sandy<00:06:51.400> the<00:06:52.400> other<00:06:52.520> corner<00:06:53.030> it's<00:06:53.180> very<00:06:53.449> very

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
is sandy the other corner it's very very

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.140 
is sandy the other corner it's very very
heavy<00:06:53.990> and<00:06:54.979> so<00:06:55.219> when<00:06:55.430> I<00:06:55.460> set<00:06:55.789> my<00:06:55.819> down

00:06:56.140 --> 00:06:56.150 
heavy and so when I set my down

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:59.439 
heavy and so when I set my down
pressures<00:06:57.009> as<00:06:58.009> soon<00:06:58.280> as<00:06:58.400> I<00:06:58.520> Drive<00:06:58.729> 10<00:06:59.030> feet<00:06:59.300> in

00:06:59.439 --> 00:06:59.449 
pressures as soon as I Drive 10 feet in

00:06:59.449 --> 00:07:03.189 
pressures as soon as I Drive 10 feet in
wrong<00:07:00.699> and<00:07:01.699> there<00:07:01.969> is<00:07:02.120> technology<00:07:02.840> by<00:07:03.139> the

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:03.199 
wrong and there is technology by the

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:06.219 
wrong and there is technology by the
competitor<00:07:04.030> to<00:07:05.030> control<00:07:05.419> that<00:07:05.599> automatically

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
competitor to control that automatically

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:08.050 
competitor to control that automatically
and<00:07:06.500> that's<00:07:06.770> what<00:07:06.919> I'd<00:07:07.009> like<00:07:07.039> to<00:07:07.250> go<00:07:07.490> to<00:07:07.550> next

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:08.060 
and that's what I'd like to go to next

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:10.480 
and that's what I'd like to go to next
year<00:07:08.240> and<00:07:08.719> start<00:07:08.930> testing<00:07:09.620> that<00:07:09.650> in<00:07:09.949> here<00:07:10.219> too

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:10.490 
year and start testing that in here too

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.580 
year and start testing that in here too
and<00:07:11.150> have<00:07:11.330> that<00:07:11.479> automatically<00:07:12.050> control<00:07:12.439> I

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:12.590 
and have that automatically control I

00:07:12.590 --> 00:07:15.040 
and have that automatically control I
think<00:07:12.830> make<00:07:13.759> as<00:07:13.909> far<00:07:14.150> as<00:07:14.270> he'll<00:07:14.449> we're<00:07:14.810> really

00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:15.050 
think make as far as he'll we're really

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.879 
think make as far as he'll we're really
hurting<00:07:15.319> ourselves<00:07:16.150> with<00:07:17.469> with<00:07:18.469> too<00:07:18.710> much

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
hurting ourselves with with too much

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:22.180 
hurting ourselves with with too much
down<00:07:19.159> pressure<00:07:20.139> because<00:07:21.139> no<00:07:21.740> matter<00:07:21.919> how<00:07:22.009> you

00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:22.190 
down pressure because no matter how you

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:22.809 
down pressure because no matter how you
said<00:07:22.520> it

00:07:22.809 --> 00:07:22.819 
said it

00:07:22.819 --> 00:07:26.350 
said it
you're<00:07:23.180> wrong<00:07:23.389> as<00:07:23.599> soon<00:07:23.629> as<00:07:23.900> you<00:07:23.990> move<00:07:25.360> and

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:26.360 
you're wrong as soon as you move and

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:29.770 
you're wrong as soon as you move and
this<00:07:27.139> thing<00:07:27.409> has<00:07:27.560> been<00:07:27.740> moving<00:07:28.099> so<00:07:28.430> fast<00:07:28.780> who

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:29.780 
this thing has been moving so fast who

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:31.330 
this thing has been moving so fast who
knows<00:07:29.960> what<00:07:30.229> will<00:07:30.349> happen<00:07:30.379> the<00:07:30.770> next<00:07:30.919> year<00:07:31.219> in

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:31.340 
knows what will happen the next year in

00:07:31.340 --> 00:07:33.909 
knows what will happen the next year in
the<00:07:31.430> next<00:07:31.580> year<00:07:31.940> but<00:07:32.090> I<00:07:32.539> think<00:07:32.629> that<00:07:33.080> I<00:07:33.349> think

00:07:33.909 --> 00:07:33.919 
the next year but I think that I think

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:38.490 
the next year but I think that I think
that<00:07:34.129> we<00:07:34.550> have<00:07:34.669> finally<00:07:34.969> come<00:07:35.180> to<00:07:35.599> Moore's<00:07:35.900> law

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:38.500 

00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:44.260 

which<00:07:39.500> means<00:07:39.740> that<00:07:40.270> in<00:07:41.270> 18<00:07:41.479> months<00:07:42.940> it's<00:07:43.940> twice

00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:44.270 
which means that in 18 months it's twice

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.110 
which means that in 18 months it's twice
as<00:07:44.300> powerful<00:07:44.719> that<00:07:45.529> happened<00:07:45.860> the<00:07:45.919> cost<00:07:46.159> and

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:47.120 
as powerful that happened the cost and

00:07:47.120 --> 00:07:50.110 
as powerful that happened the cost and
so<00:07:47.509> if<00:07:48.229> you're<00:07:48.469> not<00:07:48.620> ready<00:07:48.860> to<00:07:48.949> move<00:07:49.129> you<00:07:49.939> just

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:50.120 
so if you're not ready to move you just

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.089 
so if you're not ready to move you just
either<00:07:50.479> get<00:07:50.750> out<00:07:50.779> of<00:07:51.020> the<00:07:51.080> way<00:07:51.259> or<00:07:51.319> England

00:07:52.089 --> 00:07:52.099 
either get out of the way or England

00:07:52.099 --> 00:07:54.310 
either get out of the way or England
here
