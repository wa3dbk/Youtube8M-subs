a new master cylinder for the motor when

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:05.670 
a new master cylinder for the motor when
you<00:02:03.909> run<00:02:04.060> it<00:02:04.210> it<00:02:04.450> does<00:02:04.720> smoke<00:02:05.110> so<00:02:05.409> it's

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
you run it it does smoke so it's

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.730 
you run it it does smoke so it's
probably<00:02:05.979> to<00:02:06.280> resealed<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:07.720> I<00:02:08.110> put<00:02:08.590> a<00:02:08.619> new
