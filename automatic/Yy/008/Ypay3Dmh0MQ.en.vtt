00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
thought that this particular application

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.189 
thought that this particular application
would<00:00:47.500> go<00:00:47.729> really<00:00:48.729> well<00:00:48.879> with<00:00:49.089> that<00:00:49.329> dish<00:00:49.780> so

00:00:50.189 --> 00:00:50.199 
would go really well with that dish so

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:52.229 
would go really well with that dish so
this<00:00:50.470> is<00:00:51.100> what<00:00:51.250> we're<00:00:51.370> gonna<00:00:51.460> do<00:00:51.729> we're<00:00:52.149> gonna
