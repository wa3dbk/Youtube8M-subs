00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.030
 there is a very commented term 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.610
 within this area of protein choice 

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.260
 which is called g civility 

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.710
 basically it 's the content that 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.869
 absorb this protein intake the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.570
 proteins have a characteristic that 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.910
 missing contains nitrogen then 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.710
 nitrogen difference protein and 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.840
 carbohydrate and fat 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.610
 fat carbohydrate has no progeny 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.460
 who has the protein gene then 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.440
 people often talk about nutrition 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.300
 nitrogen balance sheet or balance sheet 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.829
 Collagen Protein Protein 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.210
 people are practically a synonym for people 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.690
 will talk about this 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.760
 then evaluate the digestibility I 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.829
 I have to evaluate the first aspect that 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.850
 the amount ingested 

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.739
 then we will have the intake where the 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:06.149
 people will be able to quantify how 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.369
 there is nitrogen that food 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:12.810
 Ingested from this intake we will 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.390
 capture as reached the stool ie 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.789
 people will quantify what was ingested 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.670
 and what goes out in the feces 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:24.030
 if the person ingested for example without 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.459
 nitrogen and 20,000 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.009
 geniuses means that 80 have been 

00:01:26.459 --> 00:01:30.539
 then the digestibility was 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:32.459
 around 80% 

00:01:30.539 --> 00:01:34.080
 so this is the basic concept of people 

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.030
 assess accessibility 

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.130
 this discipline digestibility her 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.289
 varies according to the type of food 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:41.880
 where we are ingesting people 

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:44.300
 knows that the products meat products 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:48.270
 has a digestibility close to 95 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.830
 98% and vegetable foods may have 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.729
 a more variable activity that will 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:55.050
 from 95 to 90 85% 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.380
 only that there is a great questioning 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:02:00.270
 in this matter because when you 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.319
 uses a plant food and contains 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:03.330
 fibers 

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.280
 the fibers are used by bacteria 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:07.470
 in your gut and we know that 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.810
 some bacteria have the ability to 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:12.860
 synthesize nitrogen 

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.030
 then you may have fecal content 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:18.300
 contaminated with nitrogen by the production 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.340
 and not for the remainder of the year 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.709
 the food you have consumed or 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.810
 you produce a new nitrogen him 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.670
 passion the 7th week of food 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.650
 today there is an attempt that is very 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.810
 difficult to achieve but is a 

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.970
 it is an old idea that has been tried 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:35.159
 be put into practice which is 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:36.540
 quantify not coming out of the feces 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:38.579
 but what is being lanuf to the intestine 

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.650
 that is, before entering 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:42.239
 contact with that huge amount of 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.959
 bacteria in the large intestine 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.620
 in this context perhaps the 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.170
 plant food creativity 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.120
 are even greater but the concept of 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.709
 activity is this nitrogen that has 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.840
 a lot of people who left us make a 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.849
 swing that goes through the feces 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:58.379
 this is the context and that people know that 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:00.420
 Do not change anything happen to diet. 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:04.220
 is in terms of absorption 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.220
 because she is totally safe
