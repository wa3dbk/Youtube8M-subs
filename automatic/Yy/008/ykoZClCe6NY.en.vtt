you're on wood like this table
it<00:02:19.860> obviously<00:02:19.950> serves<00:02:20.519> no<00:02:20.700> purpose<00:02:20.850> but<00:02:21.600> it

it obviously serves no purpose but it
gives<00:02:22.080> you<00:02:22.170> that<00:02:22.290> added<00:02:22.620> versatility<00:02:23.010> if<00:02:23.310> you

gives you that added versatility if you

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.430 
gives you that added versatility if you
want<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:23.670> attach<00:02:23.910> it<00:02:23.940> to<00:02:24.090> something<00:02:24.360> so<00:02:25.260> again

at the price point if you do find a

tabletop tripod for less than $20 it's

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.030 
tabletop tripod for less than $20 it's
probably<00:02:31.049> not<00:02:31.140> going<00:02:31.290> to<00:02:31.350> be<00:02:31.500> very<00:02:31.680> good<00:02:31.890> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
probably not going to be very good and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:34.160 
probably not going to be very good and
probably<00:02:32.370> barely<00:02:32.549> hold<00:02:32.850> your<00:02:33.000> camera

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
probably barely hold your camera

so the signature feature of the

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.330 
so the signature feature of the
Gorillapod<00:02:36.569> is<00:02:36.840> its<00:02:37.140> articulating<00:02:37.830> legs<00:02:38.069> and

Gorillapod is its articulating legs and
it's<00:02:38.459> definitely<00:02:38.700> what<00:02:38.970> sets<00:02:39.270> it<00:02:39.360> apart<00:02:39.450> even

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:39.810 
it's definitely what sets it apart even

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.110 
it's definitely what sets it apart even
just<00:02:40.020> by<00:02:40.110> looking<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:40.560> it<00:02:40.680> these<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> legs<00:02:41.819> Bend

small limitations of the gorilla pod is
that<00:02:57.209> it<00:02:57.330> is<00:02:57.450> a<00:02:57.480> little<00:02:57.780> goofy<00:02:58.080> looking<00:02:58.380> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
that it is a little goofy looking I

bought the ultra pod was to keep it in

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.830 
bought the ultra pod was to keep it in
my<00:03:25.140> bag<00:03:25.320> at<00:03:25.530> all<00:03:25.650> times<00:03:25.950> I<00:03:26.880> thought<00:03:27.570> it<00:03:27.750> was

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
my bag at all times I thought it was

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:29.509 
my bag at all times I thought it was
small<00:03:28.140> enough<00:03:28.380> and<00:03:28.590> lightweight<00:03:28.920> enough<00:03:29.100> that

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
small enough and lightweight enough that

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.670 
small enough and lightweight enough that
it<00:03:30.269> would<00:03:30.390> just<00:03:30.570> sit<00:03:30.750> in<00:03:30.840> my<00:03:30.870> bag<00:03:31.170> if<00:03:31.410> I<00:03:31.530> ever

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
it would just sit in my bag if I ever

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.850 
it would just sit in my bag if I ever
needed<00:03:32.040> a<00:03:32.190> a<00:03:32.430> tripod<00:03:33.120> in<00:03:33.269> a<00:03:33.330> pinch<00:03:33.570> but<00:03:34.320> I<00:03:34.350> found

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:34.860 
needed a a tripod in a pinch but I found

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:37.160 
needed a a tripod in a pinch but I found
myself<00:03:35.070> often<00:03:35.760> thinking<00:03:36.150> hey<00:03:36.840> where's<00:03:37.080> the

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
myself often thinking hey where's the

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.870 
myself often thinking hey where's the
ultra<00:03:37.410> pod<00:03:37.590> I<00:03:37.830> wish<00:03:38.040> I<00:03:38.160> had<00:03:38.370> that<00:03:38.549> right<00:03:38.700> now

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
ultra pod I wish I had that right now

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:41.840 
ultra pod I wish I had that right now
and<00:03:39.209> it's<00:03:39.630> because<00:03:40.049> it's<00:03:40.290> all<00:03:40.470> it's<00:03:40.650> just<00:03:40.850> just

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:41.850 
and it's because it's all it's just just

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:43.610 
and it's because it's all it's just just
big<00:03:42.180> enough<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.570> it's<00:03:42.720> awkward<00:03:43.170> to<00:03:43.200> fit<00:03:43.530> in

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:43.620 
big enough that it's awkward to fit in

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:45.440 
big enough that it's awkward to fit in
your<00:03:43.709> bag<00:03:43.950> and<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.700> there<00:03:44.850> were<00:03:44.910> times<00:03:45.180> when<00:03:45.329> I

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
your bag and so there were times when I

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.180 
your bag and so there were times when I
would<00:03:45.540> just<00:03:45.780> take<00:03:46.500> it<00:03:46.530> out<00:03:46.769> it<00:03:46.920> would<00:03:47.010> be<00:03:47.040> the

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
would just take it out it would be the

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:49.190 
would just take it out it would be the
first<00:03:47.400> thing<00:03:47.579> that<00:03:47.640> I'd<00:03:47.820> abandoned<00:03:48.329> by

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:49.200 
first thing that I'd abandoned by

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.050 
first thing that I'd abandoned by
contrast<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:49.980> think<00:03:50.010> because<00:03:50.670> it<00:03:50.790> has<00:03:50.820> the

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
contrast I think because it has the

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.360 
contrast I think because it has the
bendy<00:03:51.329> legs<00:03:51.360> you<00:03:52.140> know<00:03:52.170> you<00:03:52.320> can<00:03:52.799> fit<00:03:53.220> this

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:53.370 
bendy legs you know you can fit this

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:56.180 
bendy legs you know you can fit this
into<00:03:53.730> smaller<00:03:54.090> configurations<00:03:55.019> or<00:03:55.290> in

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:56.190 
into smaller configurations or in

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.060 
into smaller configurations or in
locations<00:03:57.090> just<00:03:57.420> around<00:03:57.780> every<00:03:58.440> other<00:03:58.650> piece

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070 
locations just around every other piece

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:00.979 
locations just around every other piece
of<00:03:59.100> camera<00:03:59.579> gear<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.910> have<00:03:59.940> so<00:04:00.660> it's<00:04:00.810> much

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
of camera gear you have so it's much

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:02.930 
of camera gear you have so it's much
easier<00:04:01.170> to<00:04:01.440> pack<00:04:01.769> and<00:04:02.070> I<00:04:02.400> think<00:04:02.730> for<00:04:02.880> that

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
easier to pack and I think for that

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.210 
easier to pack and I think for that
reason<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.989> will<00:04:04.230> probably<00:04:04.560> stay<00:04:04.769> in<00:04:04.799> my<00:04:05.010> bag

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
reason this will probably stay in my bag

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.980 
reason this will probably stay in my bag
at<00:04:05.489> all<00:04:05.700> times

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:08.990 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.170 

there's<00:04:09.990> not<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.140> lot<00:04:10.350> in<00:04:10.700> youth<00:04:11.700> that<00:04:11.910> is<00:04:12.090> the

00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:12.180 
there's not a lot in youth that is the

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.150 
there's not a lot in youth that is the
back<00:04:12.360> really<00:04:12.840> wanna<00:04:13.020> pass<00:04:13.260> these<00:04:13.500> teens<00:04:13.740> I<00:04:13.950> see

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
back really wanna pass these teens I see

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.690 
back really wanna pass these teens I see
it<00:04:14.280> I<00:04:14.490> see<00:04:14.790> it<00:04:15.060> happening<00:04:18.530> finish<00:04:22.550> we<00:04:23.550> are

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:23.700 
it I see it happening finish we are

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.380 
it I see it happening finish we are
almost<00:04:23.940> at<00:04:24.330> the<00:04:24.360> end<00:04:24.630> of<00:04:24.930> this<00:04:25.050> stick<00:04:25.320> down
