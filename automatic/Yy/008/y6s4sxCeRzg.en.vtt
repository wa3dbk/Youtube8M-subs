00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 and now I will only show exactly 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.649
 cut a piece of paper under the floor at the beginning 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.469
 you need to take a sheet and fold it exactly 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.410
 in half it is done so you 

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:16.710
 apply one edge to another 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.430
 Look right here and here 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.449
 here 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:23.550
 corners matched then you take so 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.570
 press the sheet here with one hand 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:30.779
 and with your other hand hold 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.989
 and bend it straight pressing nails 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:36.989
 on the sheet of course need an arrow fingers 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.590
 then you take and 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.360
 pushing a sheet from this edge 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:48.200
 this edge 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.200
 you spend so 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:01:00.059
 strongly bending it down and pressing it 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.350
 side and then here you have exactly 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:03.359
 bend 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.549
 it is important not to press here and here's how 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:09.439
 here we have not combined the corners otherwise 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.880
 you get such folds and then 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:14.369
 when you combined corners here then 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.890
 you can already press and make 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:19.650
 so that you are not here from this edge 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:22.400
 the sheet was flat when you adding sheet 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:24.930
 this way you can cut it and 

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.860
 many are faced with a problem like so 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.009
 cut to exactly work and they 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:33.560
 take 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:36.659
 so harsh push it forward then 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:39.689
 I put it so sharp I start so nagging 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:42.119
 a sheet of this will not work then 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:43.310
 you crookedly cut it in order for you 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:47.250
 cut exactly 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:52.189
 you need as much as possible to pull 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:52.189
 cutter fill it over here 

00:01:53.230 --> 00:02:04.270
 and lead 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:07.920
 as parallel to the edge of the sheet 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:11.500
 there is like this is wrong 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:14.080
 now you have to clamp the paper like this 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.500
 so that she does not fidget and so hold 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:20.560
 cutter it is quite easy to cut 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.910
 paper cutter you should have about 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.070
 parallel 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:27.840
 he does not mean to your sheet 

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:31.410
 so hang out just take 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.980
 you lay it tucked into paper and 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:34.980
 exactly lead and 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.600
 places you cut exactly 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:03:06.300
 See what happens if I keep 

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:08.530
 the cutter is not like this to hold and 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:15.100
 I can no longer cut 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:18.810
 to cut and wear it does not cut and tears 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:27.400
 paper and that's what will happen if I am 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:27.760
 raise the cutter for 5 hours 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200
 is coming 

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:33.060
 but what will happen if you are bad 

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.060
 turn the sheet when you cut it 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.239
