 that are perfect for any 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:13.459
 meat 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:15.959
 but not like meat, it also tastes good by itself. 

00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:16.440
 to myself 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.050
 so we proceed 

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.320
 for 4 adults and I will take the shit 

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.730
 flights from Moscow become salsa 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:24.520
 I want to note that it is very difficult to find 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.750
 Iranian is why I use 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.599
 security sotsiki she court 

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.919
 suitable this flight must be washed chemistry 

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:33.020
 the waters yes you heard right 

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.280
 to make rice crumbly without 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.130
 starch must be changed 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.440
 rinse until water becomes 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.220
 completely transparent 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:44.030
 but here are three ready with levant in all the water and 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.040
 leave the rice until peace 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.400
 now 300 she creates salt water 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.270
 for this, I prepared in advance 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.289
 Kostromichi three liters of water 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.500
 boiling water I will put 3 tsp of salt 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.640
 but this is for my taste 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.200
 you can put more or less 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.590
 now it's time to throw boiling 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.320
 salt water our flight every last 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 puppies 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.950
 flight must be boiled until half ready 

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.920
 optimal time 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:11.140
 seven minutes 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.170
 the theme of his flight is seven minutes 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.390
 and for your if you basmati 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.680
 also 7 minutes 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.640
 while the flight is brewing we will not lose time 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:21.070
 take a small Kazan 4 pan 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.140
 but be sure the rest table 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.060
 pour vegetable there or 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:26.479
 olive oil so 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:28.430
 to cover the whole bottom 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.399
 I cooked potatoes in advance 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:32.030
 you ask a potato 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.290
 yes, look at the potatoes and all the memory 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.700
 I listened to the potato ward 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.330
 because yom will need to be neat 

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.660
 put on the bottom burn no one 

00:01:42.660 --> 00:01:43.510
 need to 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.360
 to arrest her in pieces 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.670
 priests centimeter 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.479
 and lay it evenly on the bottom so that all 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:51.110
 one was covered 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.110
 There are several versions to note. 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.220
 this recipe potatoes could 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.320
 live 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:58.710
 but in this recipe, potatoes will protect rice 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.250
 from education let the box crust 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.480
 they don't like this version because 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:04.680
 the potato is obtained 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.010
 extremely tasty 

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.609
 although I don't eat potatoes with rice 

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:10.559
 before laying the flight i 

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:12.709
 turn the potatoes she has already cooked 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.219
 one side and fry it is not necessary 

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:17.359
 exactly seven minutes have passed i'm going back to 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:17.940
 flight 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.559
 all water must be monitored 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.909
 turned out you have a sieve drain i 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:25.959
 statistics so that the situation is superfluous 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:26.660
 liquid 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:28.480
 these are small markets I decided to add 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.129
 a little dawn in my address 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.480
 my favorite Maluku for coffee, I'm a little 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.519
 was nervous 

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:35.799
 you can just rub it with your hands 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:38.219
 a little parcel on top of the potatoes 

00:02:38.219 --> 00:02:41.109
 and now it's time for laying flights 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:43.859
 such scumbags iris on potatoes in no way 

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.919
 If it is not possible in the morning in the area 

00:02:45.919 --> 00:02:47.869
 use only earth attraction 

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:49.919
 believe it works 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:50.890
 imagine 

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:53.350
 what does it mean not who will want 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:55.029
 keep the same fluffy 

00:02:55.029 --> 00:02:57.239
 by the way there is just such he will get from 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.049
 fascists if you are doing something right 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:00.870
 on top of 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.239
 I again sprinkled with the remains to bury 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:05.129
 it will give spice to my 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:06.529
 flights 

00:03:06.529 --> 00:03:08.679
 almost everything is ready to put 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:10.769
 pieces of butter on top 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:13.290
 although the Iranians don't do it 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:16.149
 I recommend you to try it 

00:03:16.149 --> 00:03:18.059
 butter to make then there is more 

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:18.879
 tastier 

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:21.529
 and the potatoes at the bottom will not know fragile 

00:03:21.529 --> 00:03:23.549
 like fresh snow 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:24.930
 very important moment 

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:27.310
 now found will be steaming 

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:29.400
 so take a towel or 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.040
 according to put them on top 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.909
 before you close the lid 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:35.939
 they will absorb evaporated moisture 

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:38.219
 now boldly close the lid 

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:40.409
 now the place of the year of the smallest 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:42.860
 so he appeared they were preparing 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.649
 and forget about him for 45 minutes 

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:47.969
 well what kind of rice is it for Iranian if there 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.279
 no usa france 

00:03:49.279 --> 00:03:51.719
 although not necessarily today I 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.279
 did everything according to the rules 

00:03:53.279 --> 00:03:55.599
 saffron is one of the most expensive spices 

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:56.119
 days 

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:58.539
 it’s good that you don’t need much of it 

00:03:58.539 --> 00:04:00.679
 take a little pinch ira became 

00:04:00.679 --> 00:04:02.719
 Chuev good powder 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:03.600
 and now 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.310
 Next, quite a bit of cuddly wild and 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:07.559
 post 

00:04:07.559 --> 00:04:09.959
 And this beauty, I still overflow a little 

00:04:09.959 --> 00:04:10.849
 a cup 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.399
 a little later you will see for what 

00:04:13.399 --> 00:04:15.309
 but finally this moment came 

00:04:15.309 --> 00:04:18.079
 smells spread all over the kitchen you 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:19.869
 look at this flight none 

00:04:19.869 --> 00:04:21.489
 Alone not stuck together 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:23.779
 what is not knowing beauty 

00:04:23.779 --> 00:04:26.079
 look what I'm dealing with now 

00:04:26.079 --> 00:04:26.800
 by flight 

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.669
 I take shapran and very carefully put 

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:31.870
 there part of the rice and all neatly 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.069
 stirring 

00:04:33.069 --> 00:04:34.419
 as you can see the flight from the snow-white 

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:36.449
 turns yellow 

00:04:36.449 --> 00:04:37.979
 but it's not just yellow 

00:04:37.979 --> 00:04:40.860
 look at him what a beautiful yellow 

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:41.779
 Colour 

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:44.439
 here it is the power and strength of saffron 

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:46.039
 back to kris 

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:48.969
 the prize must be laid megane priests I decided a little 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:49.870
 show off 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:51.690
 but I did not quite succeed 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.030
 so you do not bother 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.810
 what for osh was going to shift and rice 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.930
 ligans or large plate 

00:04:57.930 --> 00:04:59.919
 and now let's do it not easy 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.070
 tasty but beautifully neatly lay and 

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.449
 do not rush the potatoes around the edges 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.029
 enjoy 

00:05:07.029 --> 00:05:08.469
 well, the final touch 

00:05:08.469 --> 00:05:11.139
 it remains to carefully lay Elise saffron 

00:05:11.139 --> 00:05:11.969
 on top of 

00:05:11.969 --> 00:05:14.729

00:05:14.729 --> 00:05:16.990
 although percy ate his kebab 

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.050
 he is perfect in my opinion 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:20.439
 any meat 

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:23.009
