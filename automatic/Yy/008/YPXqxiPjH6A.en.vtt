00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.990
 so hello here we are with roxane who 

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.430
 will participate in the race of the big challenge 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:22.340
 Pierre Lavoie and we will speak 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.850
 today of race posture so 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.680
 roxane for the second lap posture at at 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.390
 adolescence for the changes 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.019
 hormones have grown up and then often a 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.660
 class in society crh like that and then 

00:00:33.019 --> 00:00:37.220
 when we run we run like this and 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.899
 the way to recover 

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:40.489
 it's not by working too hard 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.860
 back muscles to straighten up as 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.960
 it's those bad faso and it's tiring 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.579
 we can not hold this long the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.010
 best way is to imagine some 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:50.899
 strings at the top of the hung collar and 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:53.329
 that this string firing the top of the 

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.920
 head to the sky and suddenly we will 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.210
 lie 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:58.399
 ok so we stand on our feet 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.579
 slightly open in natural position 

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:02.989
 to feel deeply rooted 

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.739
 then it is a woman injured 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.280
 does it like that 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.229
 and so that's not a good posture 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.299
 and then imagine the string at 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.450
 top of the skull and now let yourself 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:18.090
 lying up with the minimum of 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.280
 lighthouses what we do at all and either 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.930
 the host is very big comes right from 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.920
 15 races and 67 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.920
 I go out 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.200
 in the evening accent it's very simple 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:43.799
 to have a good posture but he 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.899
 must think about it 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:47.460
 a few times during the race and the 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.590
 race becomes a workout for 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.789
 improve posture so small 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.500
 deep muscles his spine 

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.509
 are going to be activated when it's really 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.220
 a good thing and the other benefit 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.320
 that's with good posture are 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.630
 better breathe also who by negligence 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.399
 so here I wish you a very 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.939
 good workout for the big race 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.939
