00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:02.920 
run into some battery problems I'm

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.710 
run into some battery problems I'm
thinking<00:03:03.610> that<00:03:03.910> something's<00:03:04.330> wrong<00:03:04.480> with<00:03:04.600> the

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
thinking that something's wrong with the

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.690 
thinking that something's wrong with the
battery<00:03:05.170> or<00:03:05.530> it's<00:03:05.800> like<00:03:05.980> the<00:03:06.100> prongs<00:03:06.489> that

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:06.700 
battery or it's like the prongs that

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.170 
battery or it's like the prongs that
that<00:03:07.180> connect<00:03:07.570> to<00:03:07.750> it<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.760> I'm<00:03:09.760> just<00:03:09.820> gonna

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
that connect to it but I'm just gonna

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:15.229 
that connect to it but I'm just gonna
try<00:03:10.540> and<00:03:10.630> open<00:03:10.750> this<00:03:11.050> up<00:03:11.260> to<00:03:11.590> show<00:03:11.620> you<00:03:11.830> quick

00:03:15.229 --> 00:03:15.239 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:19.259

exhibit to 4G is that the screen is it's

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:13.850 
exhibit to 4G is that the screen is it's
very<00:04:11.790> responsive<00:04:12.480> it's<00:04:12.900> very<00:04:13.260> touch

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
very responsive it's very touch

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.580 
very responsive it's very touch
sensitive<00:04:14.280> not<00:04:14.910> I<00:04:14.940> wouldn't<00:04:15.360> say<00:04:15.590> responsive

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
sensitive not I wouldn't say responsive

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:20.630 
sensitive not I wouldn't say responsive
it's<00:04:16.710> very<00:04:16.890> time<00:04:17.070> sensitive<00:04:17.420> its<00:04:19.610> ability<00:04:20.610> to

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
it's very time sensitive its ability to

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.930 
it's very time sensitive its ability to
detect<00:04:21.330> the<00:04:21.810> finger<00:04:22.260> the<00:04:23.130> human<00:04:23.400> finger<00:04:23.640> is

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120 
very limited to a sense because you may

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.170 
very limited to a sense because you may
touch<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.840> touchscreen<00:04:28.430> but<00:04:29.430> only<00:04:29.730> apply

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
touch the touchscreen but only apply

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.080 
touch the touchscreen but only apply
certain<00:04:30.540> amount<00:04:30.870> of<00:04:30.930> pressure<00:04:31.230> and<00:04:32.090> only

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:33.090 
certain amount of pressure and only

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:37.810 
certain amount of pressure and only
apply<00:04:33.450> a<00:04:33.480> certain<00:04:33.840> amount<00:04:34.170> of<00:04:35.210> fingertip

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:37.820 
apply a certain amount of fingertip

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:43.310 
apply a certain amount of fingertip
space<00:04:38.820> like<00:04:39.800> how<00:04:40.800> much<00:04:41.090> area<00:04:42.090> you<00:04:42.720> put<00:04:42.960> down<00:04:43.110> on

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
space like how much area you put down on

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.350 
space like how much area you put down on
the<00:04:43.440> screen<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:44.370> very<00:04:44.580> sensitive<00:04:44.820> to<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
the screen it's very sensitive to that

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.540 
the screen it's very sensitive to that
and<00:04:45.630> if<00:04:46.230> you<00:04:46.290> don't<00:04:46.470> put<00:04:46.680> down<00:04:46.830> the<00:04:47.400> right

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
and if you don't put down the right

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:52.310 
and if you don't put down the right
amount<00:04:47.820> it<00:04:48.090> will<00:04:48.360> malfunction<00:04:49.790> and<00:04:51.320> it's

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320 
amount it will malfunction and it's

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:58.000 
amount it will malfunction and it's
going<00:04:53.040> to<00:04:54.320> be<00:04:55.320> a<00:04:55.350> very<00:04:56.070> big<00:04:56.370> pain<00:04:56.670> in<00:04:56.970> the<00:04:57.090> neck

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.010 
going to be a very big pain in the neck

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:02.380 
going to be a very big pain in the neck
so<00:04:59.010> it's<00:05:00.080> just<00:05:01.080> one<00:05:01.320> other<00:05:01.590> thing<00:05:02.010> to<00:05:02.160> consider

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:02.390 
so it's just one other thing to consider

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:06.920 
so it's just one other thing to consider
another<00:05:03.390> thing<00:05:03.750> is<00:05:03.990> that<00:05:04.520> it<00:05:05.520> gets<00:05:05.910> slow<00:05:06.420> why

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:06.930 
another thing is that it gets slow why

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.470 
another thing is that it gets slow why
don't<00:05:07.110> you<00:05:07.260> purchase<00:05:08.250> one<00:05:08.490> it<00:05:08.790> doesn't<00:05:09.090> come

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:09.480 
don't you purchase one it doesn't come

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.630 
don't you purchase one it doesn't come
with<00:05:09.810> what<00:05:10.470> well<00:05:10.770> when<00:05:11.070> you<00:05:11.130> purchase<00:05:11.430> one

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
with what well when you purchase one

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.020 
with what well when you purchase one
with<00:05:12.240> a<00:05:12.270> 4G<00:05:12.900> t-mobile<00:05:13.350> plan<00:05:13.890> it<00:05:14.430> doesn't<00:05:14.850> come

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
with a 4G t-mobile plan it doesn't come

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.640 
with a 4G t-mobile plan it doesn't come
with<00:05:15.270> a<00:05:15.510> memory<00:05:16.020> card<00:05:17.720> so<00:05:18.720> you're<00:05:19.320> gonna<00:05:19.470> be

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:19.650 
with a memory card so you're gonna be

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:24.110 
with a memory card so you're gonna be
long<00:05:19.860> memory<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:21.560> when<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:22.740> phone<00:05:23.010> gets<00:05:23.370> low

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
long memory and when the phone gets low

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.480 
long memory and when the phone gets low
on<00:05:24.150> memory<00:05:24.480> or<00:05:24.870> not<00:05:24.900> even<00:05:25.410> low<00:05:25.590> just<00:05:25.920> minimal

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:26.490 
on memory or not even low just minimal

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:30.290 
on memory or not even low just minimal
on<00:05:26.700> memory<00:05:27.390> it's<00:05:28.230> going<00:05:28.980> to<00:05:29.340> be<00:05:29.550> extremely

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:30.300 
on memory it's going to be extremely

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.460 
on memory it's going to be extremely
sluggish<00:05:31.050> and<00:05:32.390> the<00:05:33.390> battery<00:05:33.870> will<00:05:34.230> die

00:05:34.460 --> 00:05:34.470 
sluggish and the battery will die
