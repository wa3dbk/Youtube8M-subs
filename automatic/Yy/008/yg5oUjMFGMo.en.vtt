00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.020
 perry build a house of aerated concrete house 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.970
 starts with the foundation 

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.969
 basement of aerated concrete blocks 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.780
 must be at least half a meter tall 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:18.859
 between foundation and masonry 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.850
 waterproofing the first row of blocks 

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:21.810
 laid on cement-sand 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.390
 solution 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.849
 tray starts at the highest angle 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:29.279
 future home building corners for masonry 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.160
 each row is stretched cord 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.890
 chants by chans cord and level 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:37.710
 the installation of each unit is controlled 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.329
 rubber is used for adjustment 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:45.290
 hammer ends of groove-crest blocks 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:45.290
 connect without glue 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.030
 special glue for aerated concrete 

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:54.539
 used in horizontal seams and when 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.809
 masonry finishing block after laying 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:01:00.350
 row must remove all bumps 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.350
 overwrite float 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.450
 fence units can be easily cut when 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:09.250
 the help of a hand saw and square for 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:16.990
 high precision block cutting 

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:20.350
 use band saw recommended 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:23.320
 reinforce 1 every fourth row of masonry 

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:26.380
 zones above window openings 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:27.220
 also reinforced belt for interfloor 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.710
 overlap 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.500
 for reinforcement masonry cut through 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.030
 dust grooves 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.790
 filled with solution 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.460
 at the corners of the walls the strokes round out 

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.619
 the armature should be pressed into the solution 

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.310
 whole excess solution 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.310
 are deleted 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:52.250
 laying 2 rows start in one or two 

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:54.829
 hours after laying 1 tray start with 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.259
 corner ligation of blocks each block 

00:01:54.829 --> 00:02:00.789
 leveled with rubber 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:02:00.789
 hammer and level 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.610
 reinforced aerated concrete lintels 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.250
 used for door and window 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.950
 openings and installed with 

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.280
 wooden support thicker 

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.620
 side wall at the figurative block 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.230
 located on the outside of the cavity 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:25.980
 reinforcing blocks installed 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.350
 frame of 5 6 rows then the cavity is sweet 

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:30.960
 filled with fine-grained concrete 

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.410
 vuitton should be compacted and leveled 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:33.410
 flush 

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:40.480
 during the construction of internal walls is done 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:42.790
 hydro and noise insulation 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.230
 every second row with main wall 

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.230
 communicates with the cops 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.069
 or anchors with galvanized 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.069
 irfa bands 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.280
 interfloor slabs rely on 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.940
 reinforced ring belt joints between 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:03.190
 the slabs are filled with mortar 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.670
 the ends are closed with a clumsy 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.670
 in blocks 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:11.480
 inclined surfaces of the apertures difficult 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:15.310
 shapes can be cut 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.310
 using hand saw 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:22.069
 aerated concrete is easily drilled and sawn 

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:24.750
 hole for mounting boxes 

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:26.940
 cut out by using an electric drill 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.170
 special frezoy grooves for 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:32.000
 engineering networks 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.000
 pipe cutters are performed 

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:42.340
 for attaching not heavy objects on 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.100
 wall used turbo dowel or 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:49.710
 dowel concrete shows more durable 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.710
 mount give anchoring structures 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:01.040
 for exterior trim should be used 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.900
 special plaster for aerated concrete 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.310
 or 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.380
 decorative plaster in front of them 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:09.470
 using surface masonry 

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.580
 leveled with a grater splinter and filled 

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:13.340
 solution 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:15.560
 brick cladding is recommended 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.900
 using a gap 

00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:20.870
 vibro molded brick thanks 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:23.620
 different colors and textured surface he 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:23.620
 will make your
