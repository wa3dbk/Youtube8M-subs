00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.040
 how 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:13.459
 talk about cycling being in Navarre is 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:15.440
 forced to think about miguel indurain bueno 

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:17.270
 Miguel, you are going to teach us this stage 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.119
 so fabulous that you will see in this round 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.580
 Spain will be a journey 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:26.840
 pretty demanding about the whole ending and 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:31.660
 he taught us the good time we're going to 

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:31.660
 differentiate us this eleventh stage 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.440
 the turn of Spain welcomes the moments 

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:39.750
 more interesting yesterday the time trial and 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.670
 Today an end the unprecedented act a port 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.680
 really hard that happened we have here to 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.239
 miguel so that it counts it yes national 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.320
 after winning with the bike against the 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:53.780
 very hard mind developments 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.680
 the development change makes quite 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.890
 hurt and big words 

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:03.650
 at the beginning good second port 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.080
 Category Miguel has been very generous not 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.170
 only from the return the final part is 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:12.850
 a little harder as soon as they appear 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.850
 the two trees 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:18.870
 km was in the final part of then 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.670
 Lizarraga but here is still 

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.510
 remains 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:27.570
 a straight how much month the tunnel to it 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:29.580
 here is a tunnel to these times 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.030
 modern ports are passed through 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.740
 tunnels 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:44.259
 the development then extracted to a compass 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:48.290
 34 29 all the year I'm 34 too 

00:01:44.259 --> 00:01:52.240
 but of pinion I've put 28 we're going to 

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.240
 see how he responds in it 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.630
 Miguel has searched for a large area 

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:01.740
 with I'll record good for this climb 

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:07.300
 it's worth it to leave me here and 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.729
 will pay you while these are bad 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:11.489
 arribas 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.209
 but good in the cement I would 

00:02:11.489 --> 00:02:17.870
 I imagined worse the moment is fine 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:17.870
 rolls well to vis 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.709
 I hope 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.650
 how is it for everyone 

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.460
 not only are 10 kilometers, these are the 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:34.050
 ramps at the beginning the hardest of the 13 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:37.770
 of 12 and it's going to be a little stepped there 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.940
 rest areas almost 3%, 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:41.800
 that they have told me that there is a 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:46.350
 ramp that brings them 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.350
 the killer and some more 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:55.879
 where you have to attack in this port 

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.569
 the golden ones the penalties against those of 

00:02:55.879 --> 00:03:02.310
 Saragossa 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:04.840
 what will be the last 2 km 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:11.560
 enough to attack the difference 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:13.380
 take home under 1988 takes the 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:15.920
 Leader 

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:19.340
 stage of the Pyrenees 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:22.930
 a child is tall and lanky young 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.930
 puts to throw on foot of perisur 

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:28.120
 was that to throw in the plain and the 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.810
 short climbs 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:35.019
 15 km later already at the top of perisur 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:37.890
 the same character keeps pulling and we're going 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:40.910
 15 of the platoon 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:44.060
 who am I talking about 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:47.450
 you do not remember 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:50.830
 of yourself that day I knew that Miguel 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.830
 the mountain was not choking 

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:03.190
 and one of Miguel 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.860
 15 15% 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.299
 and we are already at that stage where it 

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:15.299
 attack says no to 2 km 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.670
 the change of asphalt and I'm so 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:31.440
 we lower pine nuts 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:34.140
 good climb so 10 km hard 

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:36.680
 long and especially after the 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:39.060
 controlled the legs are going to sing here 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:44.150
 by soleares 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.150
 there that this has been finished 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.660
 beautiful pretty your life the truth that 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.529
 spectacular of a day like today is good 

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.689
 a pleasure I have 

00:04:51.529 --> 00:04:55.360
 Teach us these secrets that you have here 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.370
 in navarra 

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:59.860
 hike good time to walk is uncertain 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:03.280
 in all the best corners of Navarre 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:05.319
 hard also demanding because I saw my 

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.789
 stages of the mountain the camperona and in lion 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.340
 also in unpublished ascent I have been told 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:10.750
 which is very hard and I'll tell you if you have 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.849
 great grace the village is very much back 

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.849
 what happens to me well let's go
