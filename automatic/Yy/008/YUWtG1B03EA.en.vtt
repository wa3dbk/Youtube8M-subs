00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:05.010
 we are not all going to 

00:00:05.570 --> 00:00:08.179
 Cordova 

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:10.399
 please 

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:13.749
 I present the recipe for beef stew concerts 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.770
 The first thing we will do is in the three friends and more to Carlos no firewall 

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.800
 on the other hand we will cut green pepper points 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.500
 we will cut a large onion in 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.320
 we will appeal and cut with tomato can be a tomato ripe a tomato 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.320
 fixed pear that have more juice 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.740
 add in a pan or if it can be a paella pan because it is bigger and that 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.260
 garlic is the most useful 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.380
 10 a bay leaf with a little salt 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.690
 We wait until it browns slightly as soon as it has been achieved slightly 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:24.900
 we add the green pepper 

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.190
 At the end of one minute two minutes the onion is covered and we will let you vote 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:35.620
 As soon as it has landed we uncover and add the tomato 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:46.190
 After a couple of minutes we will add a glass of white wine 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:51.410
 We will leave that the mind is favored and we will also add a little broth of 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:52.500
 meat 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.750
 in this case we are going to use brandy carner from the rolex brand since 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.270
 sponsored and have been so kind to send us a package of about 400 grams 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.420
 of meat and now it has been very very good 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:10.850
 let the carmen take a little bit of tone and then we will add half 

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:14.640
 noodle package of number 2 eye the size media 

00:02:15.169 --> 00:02:18.279
 we will remove a little bit and add the rest of the way 

00:02:19.889 --> 00:02:23.980
 we will let the steaming valley broth walk and the noodle to be made has us 

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:28.069
 to be very dry but not very hot as it is saying here 

00:02:28.069 --> 00:02:31.539
 result that really spectacular as I say in all dishes 

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.000
 correctly but this is a family recipe 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.970
 so I advise you so many that the root will enchant 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:45.469
 to make this stewed meat with noodles we needed 400 grams of 

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:49.939
 third for stew half pack of noodles means as number two 

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:54.840
 two green peppers one large onion one tomato one bay leaf two or three 

00:02:54.839 --> 00:03:00.239
 garlic a glass of white wine olive oil a liter of beef broth salt and 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:03.529
