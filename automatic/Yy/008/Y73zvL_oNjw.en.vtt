because<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:54.420> just<00:03:54.600> completely<00:03:55.140> different

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:55.500 
because it's just completely different

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.610 
because it's just completely different
from<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.400> previous<00:03:56.640> games<00:03:57.090> and<00:03:57.410> she<00:03:58.410> sends

00:03:58.610 --> 00:03:58.620 
from the previous games and she sends

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.970 
from the previous games and she sends
out<00:03:58.769> chespin<00:03:59.340> which<00:04:00.140> usually<00:04:01.140> in<00:04:01.410> Pokemon

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:01.980 
out chespin which usually in Pokemon

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:05.120 
out chespin which usually in Pokemon
games<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.970> would<00:04:03.150> pick<00:04:03.450> the<00:04:03.690> starter<00:04:04.200> that<00:04:04.620> has

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.130 
games it would pick the starter that has

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:07.910 
games it would pick the starter that has
the<00:04:05.400> typing<00:04:05.880> that's<00:04:06.120> a<00:04:06.329> week<00:04:06.540> that<00:04:07.079> has<00:04:07.890> a

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
the typing that's a week that has a

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.009 
the typing that's a week that has a
typing<00:04:08.310> that's<00:04:08.489> stronger<00:04:09.030> against<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:09.570> like

00:04:10.009 --> 00:04:10.019 
typing that's stronger against you like

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.990 
typing that's stronger against you like
in<00:04:10.140> this<00:04:10.260> case<00:04:10.440> the<00:04:10.650> water<00:04:10.799> type<00:04:11.100> but<00:04:11.370> before

00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:12.000 
in this case the water type but before

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.940 
in this case the water type but before
for<00:04:12.390> whatever<00:04:12.810> reason<00:04:13.440> they<00:04:13.620> went<00:04:13.829> with

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
for whatever reason they went with

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.740 
for whatever reason they went with
chespin<00:04:14.489> which<00:04:14.640> makes<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:15.000> a<00:04:15.090> lot<00:04:15.239> easier

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
chespin which makes it a lot easier

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:18.199 
chespin which makes it a lot easier
especially<00:04:15.810> since<00:04:16.709> I<00:04:16.829> start<00:04:17.220> off<00:04:17.400> with<00:04:17.430> ember

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
especially since I start off with ember

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.630 
especially since I start off with ember
at<00:04:18.390> level<00:04:18.720> 5<00:04:18.989> so<00:04:19.890> I<00:04:19.919> can<00:04:19.950> just<00:04:20.190> hit<00:04:20.370> him<00:04:20.519> with

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:20.640 
at level 5 so I can just hit him with

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:23.900 
at level 5 so I can just hit him with
ember<00:04:21.680> it<00:04:22.680> is<00:04:22.800> like<00:04:22.950> nothing<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.400> me<00:04:23.610> with

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
ember it is like nothing to me with

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:27.290 
ember it is like nothing to me with
grass-type<00:04:25.160> so<00:04:26.160> I'm<00:04:26.789> just<00:04:26.940> gonna<00:04:27.060> keep

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.300 
grass-type so I'm just gonna keep

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.930 
grass-type so I'm just gonna keep
hitting<00:04:27.780> it<00:04:28.020> with<00:04:28.410> ember<00:04:28.950> at<00:04:29.160> this<00:04:29.370> point<00:04:29.640> and

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 
hitting it with ember at this point and

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.740 
hitting it with ember at this point and
it<00:04:30.120> hit<00:04:30.630> it<00:04:30.780> and<00:04:30.960> I<00:04:31.440> believe<00:04:32.310> after<00:04:32.610> I<00:04:32.910> kill<00:04:33.600> it

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:33.750 
it hit it and I believe after I kill it

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:37.790 
it hit it and I believe after I kill it
off<00:04:33.900> I'm<00:04:34.169> gonna<00:04:34.320> grow<00:04:34.740> one<00:04:35.160> level<00:04:35.460> and<00:04:36.800> that's

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:37.800
