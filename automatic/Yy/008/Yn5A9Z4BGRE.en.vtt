 caracas the characters who made the

 sport history tells tina 

00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:14.400
 federico buffa saw right 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.809
 I believe a master like borges in my own way 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.789
 to see the greatest writer of the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.289
 history of Latin America certainly the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:23.730
 according to him, more North Americans 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:26.160
 make up for the absence of an epic 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.859
 because they were born too late in the end 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.260
 of the 700 with their contemporary epoch 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.210
 perfectly photographed immortalized by 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.070
 hollywood I would like to add 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.989
 that also in large entertainers of the 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.910
 American sports have their own vision 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.190
 ethics of life and they have it almost for 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.640
 nature is the case for example of chris 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.280
 paul 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
 chris paul and the play maker from his 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.000
 American who won the Olympics a 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.969
 london and is probably the largest 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.160
 obvious play maker now let's move on 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.610
 with our history in the north 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:57.739
 carolina then south of the united states 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:02.010
 in the early 2000s 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:04.260
 chris honors an unwritten commandment 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.330
 of the south and the united states that says i 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.110
 most important in your life are yours 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.110
 grandmother 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:11.159
 if you have the privilege of having chris the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.920
 grandfather had it 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:16.890
 nathaniel jones but for all was 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.500
 Pope Cilli at Pacilli was his best 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.540
 friend had a gas pump 

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:23.250
 at the entrance of the city the pump of 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.640
 gasoline normally asked for seven o'clock 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.170
 evening 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:30.070
 unless his nephew did not play 

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:34.880
 then it closed 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.860
 daddy cheliera contextual to chris foy 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.840

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:40.790
 chocolate brown eyes of creativity 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.190
 scary of a passing talent 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.740
 really sometimes even the art 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:48.440
 one day a group of criminals for 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.390

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.490
 with adhesive tape and hit him a 

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.380
 a couple of times to the head 

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.580
 papa chile was a cathedral tree but he had 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:58.520
 heart problems and dies 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.680

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.530

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.459
 chris paul points up to then in 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:38.120
 career at school level there was 39 la 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:40.430
 game to play crissa not to force 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.790
 not even within a context 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:46.000
 almost mystical there is little to say at the end 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:49.100

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:51.290

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:56.209

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.510
 of chocolate are already watering must 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.670
 go to the bezel because of for 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.530
 regulation an additional throw must 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:12.100
 mistake it by force I'll tell you a 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.900
 meter body the ball is bouncing 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.210
 and he has already turned towards the bench 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.910
 he had to hug his father crying 

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:20.920
 it felt like miners are 61 like 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.490
