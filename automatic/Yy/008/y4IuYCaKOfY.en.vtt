00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
hello I know that this is a bit gnarly

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.919 
hello I know that this is a bit gnarly
but<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.580> want<00:00:02.790> to<00:00:02.909> make<00:00:03.060> a<00:00:03.090> video<00:00:03.270> to<00:00:03.570> test<00:00:03.750> out

how<00:00:04.140> much<00:00:04.319> faster<00:00:04.799> the<00:00:04.890> iMac<00:00:05.190> gets<00:00:05.430> with

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
how much faster the iMac gets with

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.940 
how much faster the iMac gets with

upgrading from 8 gigabyte RAM to 6 engi
right<00:00:08.069> of<00:00:08.189> RAM<00:00:08.400> I<00:00:08.599> work<00:00:09.599> a<00:00:09.630> lot<00:00:09.719> with<00:00:09.840> editing

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
right of RAM I work a lot with editing

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.290 
right of RAM I work a lot with editing
films<00:00:10.679> doing<00:00:11.099> effects<00:00:11.519> in<00:00:11.610> After<00:00:11.849> Effects<00:00:12.090> and

the signing in Photoshop and this kind
of<00:00:14.219> work<00:00:14.400> requires<00:00:14.820> a<00:00:15.030> lot<00:00:15.150> of<00:00:15.269> RAM<00:00:15.450> especially

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
of work requires a lot of RAM especially

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:17.689 
of work requires a lot of RAM especially
if<00:00:16.470> you<00:00:16.529> are<00:00:16.590> working<00:00:16.740> with<00:00:17.039> high<00:00:17.190> resolution

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
if you are working with high resolution

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:20.570 
if you are working with high resolution
video<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:18.119> pictures<00:00:18.980> since<00:00:19.980> it<00:00:20.160> has<00:00:20.279> become

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
video and pictures since it has become

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.550 
video and pictures since it has become
quite<00:00:20.789> cheap<00:00:21.180> upreared<00:00:21.539> Ram<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.080> it's<00:00:22.380> easy

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
quite cheap upreared Ram and it's easy

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.410 
quite cheap upreared Ram and it's easy
to<00:00:22.680> do<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:22.980> I<00:00:23.189> thought<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.640> would<00:00:23.760> upgrade<00:00:23.910> it<00:00:24.240> to

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
to do it I thought I would upgrade it to

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.929 
to do it I thought I would upgrade it to
the<00:00:24.570> max<00:00:24.779> of<00:00:25.019> what<00:00:25.170> my<00:00:25.320> iMac<00:00:25.680> 27-inch<00:00:26.400> can<00:00:26.760> use

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
the max of what my iMac 27-inch can use

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.870 
the max of what my iMac 27-inch can use
of<00:00:27.180> RAM<00:00:27.740> I'm<00:00:28.740> not<00:00:28.949> the<00:00:29.039> one<00:00:29.160> who<00:00:29.340> knows<00:00:29.519> most

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
of RAM I'm not the one who knows most

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.209 
of RAM I'm not the one who knows most
about<00:00:30.090> hardware<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.869> PC<00:00:31.260> and<00:00:31.380> Macs<00:00:31.560> so<00:00:31.920> this<00:00:32.099> is

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
about hardware in PC and Macs so this is

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.479 
about hardware in PC and Macs so this is
just<00:00:32.460> a<00:00:32.579> simple<00:00:32.910> test<00:00:33.059> my<00:00:33.989> iMac<00:00:34.320> has<00:00:34.350> a<00:00:34.559> 2.8

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
just a simple test my iMac has a 2.8

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.930 
just a simple test my iMac has a 2.8

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
ATI Radeon HD for 850 graphic card yeah

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.580 
ATI Radeon HD for 850 graphic card yeah
so<00:00:46.920> let's<00:00:47.100> test<00:00:47.579> it<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:47.789> I<00:00:48.200> first<00:00:49.200> did<00:00:49.320> several

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
so let's test it out I first did several

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.950 
so let's test it out I first did several
tests<00:00:49.860> with<00:00:50.280> the<00:00:50.430> a<00:00:50.640> Kaiba<00:00:51.030> drum<00:00:51.270> in<00:00:51.480> my<00:00:51.629> iMac

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
tests with the a Kaiba drum in my iMac

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.990 
tests with the a Kaiba drum in my iMac
before<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.530> upgraded<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.129> 16<00:00:53.550> gigabyte<00:00:53.670> ram

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
before I upgraded to a 16 gigabyte ram

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.020 
before I upgraded to a 16 gigabyte ram
and<00:00:54.210> then<00:00:54.960> do<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.260> same<00:00:55.469> tests<00:00:55.860> on<00:00:56.760> the<00:00:56.879> right

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
and then do the same tests on the right

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.970 
and then do the same tests on the right
side<00:00:57.239> you<00:00:57.600> can<00:00:57.660> see<00:00:57.930> how<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.140> iMac<00:00:58.500> performed

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
side you can see how the iMac performed

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.680 
side you can see how the iMac performed
with<00:00:59.129> a<00:00:59.280> keyword<00:00:59.609> Ram<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.359> the<00:01:00.449> left<00:01:00.600> side

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
with a keyword Ram and on the left side

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.889 
with a keyword Ram and on the left side
with<00:01:01.109> 6<00:01:01.350> igni<00:01:01.559> byte<00:01:01.710> of<00:01:01.859> RAM<00:01:02.300> so<00:01:03.300> let's<00:01:03.690> start

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
with 6 igni byte of RAM so let's start

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:04.310 
with 6 igni byte of RAM so let's start
the<00:01:03.960> test

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
the test

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.289 
the test
first<00:01:04.799> we<00:01:05.010> simply<00:01:05.309> try<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.549> open<00:01:05.909> After

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
first we simply try to open After

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:15.460 
first we simply try to open After
Effects

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:15.470 

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.899 

okay<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.770> was<00:01:16.860> quite<00:01:17.070> even<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.729> RAM

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:17.909 
okay that was quite even so the RAM

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.780 
okay that was quite even so the RAM
didn't<00:01:18.210> affect<00:01:18.479> this<00:01:18.600> at<00:01:18.780> all<00:01:19.340> now<00:01:20.340> let's<00:01:20.580> see

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
didn't affect this at all now let's see

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.249 
didn't affect this at all now let's see
which<00:01:20.909> one<00:01:21.119> is<00:01:21.270> faster<00:01:21.420> to<00:01:21.750> render<00:01:22.049> an

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
which one is faster to render an

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:37.550 
which one is faster to render an
animation<00:01:22.710> I've<00:01:23.040> done<00:01:23.369> in<00:01:23.490> After<00:01:23.820> Effects<00:01:36.500> hmm

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
animation I've done in After Effects hmm

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.249 
animation I've done in After Effects hmm
there's<00:01:38.549> almost<00:01:38.850> no<00:01:39.149> difference<00:01:39.180> to<00:01:39.869> see<00:01:40.020> here

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
there's almost no difference to see here

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.950 
there's almost no difference to see here
either<00:01:40.700> that's<00:01:41.700> a<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:41.940> strange<00:01:44.780> okay<00:01:45.780> maybe

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
either that's a bit strange okay maybe

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.430 
either that's a bit strange okay maybe
we<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.200> try<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.560> something<00:01:46.890> else<00:01:47.100> okay

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
we can try to do something else okay

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:50.630 
we can try to do something else okay
let's<00:01:49.440> see<00:01:49.560> how<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.770> goes<00:01:49.920> when<00:01:50.159> working<00:01:50.369> with

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
let's see how it goes when working with

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.790 
let's see how it goes when working with
the<00:01:50.729> tracking<00:01:51.119> tool<00:01:51.300> in<00:01:51.450> After<00:01:51.659> Effects<00:01:51.840> it

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
the tracking tool in After Effects it

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.529 
the tracking tool in After Effects it
was<00:01:52.920> important<00:01:53.369> to<00:01:53.399> sync<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.909> videos<00:01:54.179> so<00:01:54.420> they

00:01:54.529 --> 00:01:54.539 
was important to sync the videos so they

00:01:54.539 --> 00:02:03.770 
was important to sync the videos so they
start<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.840> render<00:01:55.050> at<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> same<00:01:55.560> time<00:02:02.780> well

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
start to render at the same time well

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.260 
start to render at the same time well
the<00:02:04.679> a<00:02:04.710> kick<00:02:04.950> drum<00:02:05.340> is<00:02:05.520> actually<00:02:05.909> working<00:02:06.179> a

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
the a kick drum is actually working a

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.559 
the a kick drum is actually working a
bit<00:02:06.390> faster<00:02:06.810> now<00:02:06.840> that's<00:02:07.770> not<00:02:08.009> good<00:02:08.190> at<00:02:08.280> all

00:02:11.559 --> 00:02:11.569 

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:14.539 

okay<00:02:12.600> hmm<00:02:13.410> okay<00:02:13.709> let's<00:02:14.010> see<00:02:14.130> how<00:02:14.220> it<00:02:14.370> renders

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:14.549 
okay hmm okay let's see how it renders

00:02:14.549 --> 00:02:17.420 
okay hmm okay let's see how it renders
in<00:02:14.910> Final<00:02:15.269> Cut<00:02:15.299> Pro<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:16.830> we<00:02:16.920> have<00:02:17.040> a<00:02:17.069> GoPro

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
in Final Cut Pro here we have a GoPro

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:19.910 
in Final Cut Pro here we have a GoPro
video<00:02:17.670> which<00:02:17.940> needs<00:02:18.209> to<00:02:18.299> be<00:02:18.360> rendered<00:02:18.920> okay

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
video which needs to be rendered okay

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.009 
video which needs to be rendered okay
let's<00:02:20.070> see<00:02:22.579> come<00:02:23.579> on<00:02:23.760> sis<00:02:23.970> invite<00:02:24.329> you<00:02:24.750> can<00:02:24.930> do

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:44.609 
it go go go go faster come on come on

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:49.190 
it go go go go faster come on come on
little<00:02:44.880> bit<00:02:45.000> oh<00:02:45.239> oh<00:02:46.200> just<00:02:47.160> slightly<00:02:47.489> ahead<00:02:48.200> I'm

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.200 
little bit oh oh just slightly ahead I'm

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:59.319 
little bit oh oh just slightly ahead I'm
okay<00:02:49.560> let's<00:02:49.799> just<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.100> smooth<00:02:50.340> cam<00:02:50.549> effects

00:02:59.319 --> 00:02:59.329 

00:02:59.329 --> 00:03:04.039 

doesn't<00:03:00.329> look<00:03:00.420> that<00:03:00.480> different<00:03:02.870> okay<00:03:03.870> I<00:03:03.900> think

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
doesn't look that different okay I think

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:06.440 
doesn't look that different okay I think
it's<00:03:04.320> because<00:03:04.739> funky<00:03:05.190> Pro<00:03:05.370> is<00:03:05.519> using<00:03:05.910> not<00:03:06.269> that

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
it's because funky Pro is using not that

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:09.289 
it's because funky Pro is using not that
much<00:03:06.630> RAM<00:03:06.900> as<00:03:07.170> you<00:03:07.350> can<00:03:07.470> see<00:03:07.560> it's<00:03:07.680> using<00:03:08.299> 745

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
much RAM as you can see it's using 745

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:14.150 
much RAM as you can see it's using 745
megabytes<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.170> RAM<00:03:10.410> I<00:03:12.680> think<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.799> need<00:03:13.920> to<00:03:14.040> do

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
megabytes of RAM I think we need to do

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.890 
megabytes of RAM I think we need to do
some<00:03:14.400> heavier<00:03:14.760> stuff<00:03:14.819> let's<00:03:15.390> go<00:03:15.569> back<00:03:15.720> to<00:03:15.870> our

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:15.900 
some heavier stuff let's go back to our

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:18.380 
some heavier stuff let's go back to our
effects<00:03:16.350> here<00:03:17.280> we<00:03:17.459> have<00:03:17.549> a<00:03:17.579> project<00:03:17.970> with<00:03:18.090> the

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:18.390 
effects here we have a project with the

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.150 
effects here we have a project with the
harvest<00:03:18.810> illusion<00:03:19.140> drawings<00:03:19.500> and<00:03:19.739> green

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
harvest illusion drawings and green

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:26.259 
harvest illusion drawings and green
screen<00:03:20.370> video<00:03:20.609> with<00:03:21.030> effects

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:28.729 

okay<00:03:27.269> now<00:03:27.510> I<00:03:27.540> really<00:03:27.840> hope<00:03:28.019> the<00:03:28.200> 16<00:03:28.470> year<00:03:28.590> what

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
okay now I really hope the 16 year what

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.039 
okay now I really hope the 16 year what
outruns<00:03:29.250> state<00:03:29.549> gearbox<00:03:29.970> or<00:03:30.450> else<00:03:30.629> this<00:03:30.840> is<00:03:30.900> a

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
outruns state gearbox or else this is a

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:37.399 
outruns state gearbox or else this is a
waste<00:03:31.200> of<00:03:31.319> money<00:03:31.500> okay<00:03:32.459> go<00:03:35.659> okay<00:03:36.659> finally<00:03:37.349> I

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:37.409 
waste of money okay go okay finally I

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:39.670 
waste of money okay go okay finally I
see<00:03:37.560> a<00:03:37.590> difference

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:39.680 
see a difference

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.440 
see a difference
the<00:03:40.680> 16<00:03:41.010> year<00:03:41.040> my<00:03:41.220> tram<00:03:41.430> is<00:03:41.610> now<00:03:41.760> faster<00:03:42.030> and

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:42.450 
the 16 year my tram is now faster and

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.509 
the 16 year my tram is now faster and
it's<00:03:42.810> rendering<00:03:43.110> at<00:03:43.319> around<00:03:43.560> 3<00:03:43.980> frames<00:03:44.280> per

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
it's rendering at around 3 frames per

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.580 
it's rendering at around 3 frames per
second<00:03:44.879> and<00:03:45.060> therefore<00:03:45.569> almost<00:03:46.049> three<00:03:46.379> times

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:46.590 
second and therefore almost three times

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.860 
second and therefore almost three times
faster<00:03:46.980> than<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.489> cable<00:03:47.849> tram<00:03:48.030> which<00:03:48.510> renders

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
faster than a cable tram which renders

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.830 
faster than a cable tram which renders
around<00:03:49.260> one<00:03:49.620> frame<00:03:50.280> per<00:03:50.459> second<00:03:50.730> this<00:03:51.629> was

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
around one frame per second this was

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.619 
around one frame per second this was
what<00:03:51.989> I<00:03:52.019> was<00:03:52.230> waiting<00:03:52.409> for<00:03:53.510> probably<00:03:54.510> the

00:03:54.619 --> 00:03:54.629 
what I was waiting for probably the

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:56.119 
what I was waiting for probably the
reason<00:03:54.780> why<00:03:54.959> it's<00:03:55.260> performing<00:03:55.739> weather<00:03:55.920> now

00:03:56.119 --> 00:03:56.129 
reason why it's performing weather now

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:58.069 
reason why it's performing weather now
is<00:03:56.310> because<00:03:56.940> objects<00:03:57.390> is<00:03:57.540> using<00:03:57.840> a<00:03:57.930> lot<00:03:58.049> of

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
is because objects is using a lot of

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.740 
is because objects is using a lot of
more<00:03:58.379> RAM<00:03:58.560> as<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.670> can<00:03:59.760> see<00:03:59.970> after<00:04:00.150> Ed's<00:04:00.390> alone

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:00.750 
more RAM as you can see after Ed's alone

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:03.530 
more RAM as you can see after Ed's alone
uses<00:04:01.260> around<00:04:01.410> 5<00:04:02.040> gigabyte<00:04:02.609> RAM<00:04:02.849> when

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
uses around 5 gigabyte RAM when

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.349 
uses around 5 gigabyte RAM when
rendering<00:04:03.900> is<00:04:04.640> that<00:04:05.640> means<00:04:05.849> I<00:04:06.090> have<00:04:06.209> a<00:04:06.239> lot<00:04:06.329> of

00:04:06.349 --> 00:04:06.359 
rendering is that means I have a lot of

00:04:06.359 --> 00:04:08.750 
rendering is that means I have a lot of
RAM<00:04:06.690> left<00:04:06.959> so<00:04:07.260> let's<00:04:07.470> also<00:04:07.680> open<00:04:08.129> foot<00:04:08.370> shop

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
RAM left so let's also open foot shop

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.979 
RAM left so let's also open foot shop
I<00:04:10.519> made<00:04:11.519> a<00:04:11.549> quite<00:04:11.819> big<00:04:12.150> poster<00:04:12.599> which<00:04:12.750> you<00:04:12.870> can

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989 
I made a quite big poster which you can

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:25.909 
I made a quite big poster which you can
try<00:04:13.109> to<00:04:13.170> open<00:04:13.530> at<00:04:13.650> the<00:04:13.739> same<00:04:13.890> time<00:04:24.080> yep<00:04:25.080> ok<00:04:25.710> and

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:25.919 
try to open at the same time yep ok and

00:04:25.919 --> 00:04:27.500 
try to open at the same time yep ok and
now<00:04:26.039> let's<00:04:26.070> scale<00:04:26.580> it<00:04:26.610> down<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:27.060> see<00:04:27.300> how<00:04:27.360> much

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:27.510 
now let's scale it down to see how much

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:33.780 
now let's scale it down to see how much
RAM<00:04:27.810> it's<00:04:28.020> using

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:33.790 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:36.159 

okay<00:04:34.790> well<00:04:35.000> now<00:04:35.270> they<00:04:35.479> sing<00:04:35.780> about<00:04:35.870> Rama

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:36.169 
okay well now they sing about Rama

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:38.020 
okay well now they sing about Rama
showing<00:04:36.530> muscles<00:04:36.860> after<00:04:37.070> fixed<00:04:37.850> and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:38.030 
showing muscles after fixed and

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.939 
showing muscles after fixed and
Photoshop<00:04:38.419> is<00:04:38.449> using<00:04:38.870> around<00:04:39.110> nine<00:04:39.470> gigabyte

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:39.949 
Photoshop is using around nine gigabyte

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:42.129 
Photoshop is using around nine gigabyte
of<00:04:40.130> RAM<00:04:40.460> together<00:04:40.820> and<00:04:41.090> of<00:04:41.570> course<00:04:41.810> that<00:04:41.990> would

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
of RAM together and of course that would

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.750 
of RAM together and of course that would
not<00:04:42.260> be<00:04:42.380> possible<00:04:42.530> with<00:04:42.800> 8k<00:04:43.100> worth<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.400> RAM

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
not be possible with 8k worth of RAM

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.240 
not be possible with 8k worth of RAM
I<00:04:43.790> also<00:04:44.660> other<00:04:44.960> programs<00:04:45.380> open<00:04:45.560> and<00:04:45.889> they<00:04:46.100> use

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:46.250 
I also other programs open and they use

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.600 
I also other programs open and they use
Ram<00:04:46.490> -<00:04:46.729> so<00:04:47.270> now<00:04:47.449> 10.2<00:04:48.380> gearbox<00:04:48.770> Ram<00:04:48.979> is<00:04:49.190> active

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:49.610 
Ram - so now 10.2 gearbox Ram is active

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:56.570 
Ram - so now 10.2 gearbox Ram is active
so<00:04:50.449> I<00:04:50.479> can<00:04:50.630> actually<00:04:50.900> still<00:04:51.080> work<00:04:51.320> flawlessly

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:59.609 

okay<00:04:57.580> now<00:04:57.789> I'm<00:04:57.939> only<00:04:58.149> using<00:04:58.419> color<00:04:58.749> let's<00:04:59.439> see

00:04:59.609 --> 00:04:59.619 
okay now I'm only using color let's see

00:04:59.619 --> 00:05:10.379 
okay now I'm only using color let's see
if<00:04:59.709> it<00:04:59.800> renders<00:05:00.129> faster<00:05:08.129> hmm<00:05:09.129> no<00:05:09.639> not<00:05:10.209> much

00:05:10.379 --> 00:05:10.389 
if it renders faster hmm no not much

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.259 
if it renders faster hmm no not much
difference<00:05:11.249> is<00:05:12.249> probably<00:05:12.639> because<00:05:12.879> the<00:05:12.999> iMac

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:13.269 
difference is probably because the iMac

00:05:13.269 --> 00:05:15.359 
difference is probably because the iMac
is<00:05:13.389> not<00:05:13.539> using<00:05:13.869> over<00:05:14.110> 8k<00:05:14.529> but<00:05:14.679> Ram<00:05:14.889> at<00:05:15.159> this

00:05:15.359 --> 00:05:15.369 
is not using over 8k but Ram at this

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:17.639 
is not using over 8k but Ram at this
moment<00:05:15.569> let's<00:05:16.569> do<00:05:16.719> some<00:05:16.869> final<00:05:17.199> tests<00:05:17.499> and

00:05:17.639 --> 00:05:17.649 
moment let's do some final tests and

00:05:17.649 --> 00:05:19.529 
moment let's do some final tests and
open<00:05:18.159> up<00:05:18.219> several<00:05:18.669> programs<00:05:19.029> at<00:05:19.239> the<00:05:19.330> same

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
open up several programs at the same

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:31.639 
open up several programs at the same
time<00:05:22.379> go<00:05:27.209> okay<00:05:28.289> FX<00:05:29.289> is<00:05:29.469> still<00:05:29.769> remaining<00:05:30.419> see

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:31.649 
time go okay FX is still remaining see

00:05:31.649 --> 00:05:33.689 
time go okay FX is still remaining see
there<00:05:32.649> is<00:05:32.769> finished<00:05:33.039> on<00:05:33.189> sitting<00:05:33.489> in<00:05:33.579> white

00:05:33.689 --> 00:05:33.699 
there is finished on sitting in white

00:05:33.699 --> 00:05:37.139 
there is finished on sitting in white
and<00:05:34.110> there<00:05:35.110> is<00:05:35.199> open<00:05:35.529> an<00:05:35.619> 8k<00:05:36.189> but<00:05:36.339> okay<00:05:36.939> let's

00:05:37.139 --> 00:05:37.149 
and there is open an 8k but okay let's

00:05:37.149 --> 00:05:39.749 
and there is open an 8k but okay let's
slightly<00:05:37.689> difference<00:05:38.019> okay<00:05:38.889> last<00:05:39.249> test

00:05:39.749 --> 00:05:39.759 
slightly difference okay last test

00:05:39.759 --> 00:05:41.399 
slightly difference okay last test
let's<00:05:40.179> see<00:05:40.300> which<00:05:40.449> one<00:05:40.479> that<00:05:40.779> opens<00:05:41.139> a<00:05:41.259> big

00:05:41.399 --> 00:05:41.409 
let's see which one that opens a big

00:05:41.409 --> 00:05:49.859 
let's see which one that opens a big
Photoshop<00:05:41.860> project<00:05:42.039> the<00:05:42.459> fastest<00:05:48.599> it's<00:05:49.599> a<00:05:49.689> big

00:05:49.859 --> 00:05:49.869 
Photoshop project the fastest it's a big

00:05:49.869 --> 00:05:54.329 
Photoshop project the fastest it's a big
file<00:05:51.569> okay<00:05:52.569> wow<00:05:53.019> it<00:05:53.229> looks<00:05:53.589> like<00:05:53.739> a<00:05:53.919> gigabytes

00:05:54.329 --> 00:05:54.339 
file okay wow it looks like a gigabytes

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:59.819 
file okay wow it looks like a gigabytes
is<00:05:54.639> in<00:05:55.089> the<00:05:55.209> lead<00:05:57.629> now<00:05:58.629> it's<00:05:58.809> using<00:05:59.079> almost<00:05:59.559> to

00:05:59.819 --> 00:05:59.829 
is in the lead now it's using almost to

00:05:59.829 --> 00:06:07.499 
is in the lead now it's using almost to
yachts<00:06:00.189> for<00:06:00.550> chop<00:06:02.969> let's<00:06:03.969> see<00:06:04.269> oh<00:06:04.649> I<00:06:05.939> think<00:06:06.939> the

00:06:07.499 --> 00:06:07.509 
yachts for chop let's see oh I think the

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:09.739 
yachts for chop let's see oh I think the
a<00:06:07.629> key<00:06:07.809> white<00:06:07.990> will<00:06:08.259> win

00:06:09.739 --> 00:06:09.749 
a key white will win

00:06:09.749 --> 00:06:12.179 
a key white will win
come<00:06:10.749> on<00:06:10.899> sitting<00:06:11.229> abiding<00:06:11.649> into<00:06:11.829> it

00:06:12.179 --> 00:06:12.189 
come on sitting abiding into it

00:06:12.189 --> 00:06:16.879 
come on sitting abiding into it
Oh<00:06:12.809> No<00:06:14.459> okay<00:06:15.459> I<00:06:15.699> don't<00:06:16.119> know<00:06:16.360> why<00:06:16.509> but

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
Oh No okay I don't know why but

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:19.829 
Oh No okay I don't know why but
sometimes<00:06:17.889> the<00:06:18.099> ATI<00:06:18.519> DRAM<00:06:18.789> actually<00:06:19.599> is

00:06:19.829 --> 00:06:19.839 
sometimes the ATI DRAM actually is

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:22.109 
sometimes the ATI DRAM actually is
faster<00:06:20.529> I<00:06:20.709> have<00:06:21.009> actually<00:06:21.369> quitted<00:06:21.909> all<00:06:21.999> the

00:06:22.109 --> 00:06:22.119 
faster I have actually quitted all the

00:06:22.119 --> 00:06:25.079 
faster I have actually quitted all the
programs<00:06:22.509> I<00:06:22.779> have<00:06:22.959> open<00:06:23.559> so<00:06:24.309> it<00:06:24.490> should<00:06:24.789> be<00:06:24.939> the

00:06:25.079 --> 00:06:25.089 
programs I have open so it should be the

00:06:25.089 --> 00:06:27.629 
programs I have open so it should be the
same<00:06:25.300> but<00:06:25.629> I<00:06:25.929> don't<00:06:26.409> know<00:06:26.469> why<00:06:26.619> I<00:06:26.829> guess<00:06:27.489> that

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:27.639 
same but I don't know why I guess that

00:06:27.639 --> 00:06:29.159 
same but I don't know why I guess that
the<00:06:27.729> speed<00:06:27.969> of<00:06:28.149> the<00:06:28.269> Mac<00:06:28.419> also<00:06:28.719> depends<00:06:29.050> on<00:06:29.110> how

00:06:29.159 --> 00:06:29.169 
the speed of the Mac also depends on how

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:32.639 
the speed of the Mac also depends on how
the<00:06:29.319> hard<00:06:29.649> drive<00:06:29.829> and<00:06:30.009> processor<00:06:30.579> as<00:06:30.699> well<00:06:31.649> SSD

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:32.649 
the hard drive and processor as well SSD

00:06:32.649 --> 00:06:34.049 
the hard drive and processor as well SSD
this<00:06:32.829> could<00:06:33.069> probably<00:06:33.219> help<00:06:33.519> when<00:06:33.789> opening

00:06:34.049 --> 00:06:34.059 
this could probably help when opening

00:06:34.059 --> 00:06:36.839 
this could probably help when opening
programs<00:06:34.509> and<00:06:34.719> files<00:06:35.399> yeah<00:06:36.399> so<00:06:36.669> for<00:06:36.819> a

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:36.849 
programs and files yeah so for a

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:38.189 
programs and files yeah so for a
conclusion<00:06:37.329> since<00:06:37.569> the<00:06:37.779> sixth<00:06:37.989> thing<00:06:38.050> about

00:06:38.189 --> 00:06:38.199 
conclusion since the sixth thing about

00:06:38.199 --> 00:06:40.979 
conclusion since the sixth thing about
of<00:06:38.349> RAM<00:06:38.529> only<00:06:38.860> costs<00:06:39.159> around<00:06:39.399> 130<00:06:40.329> bucks<00:06:40.539> is<00:06:40.899> a

00:06:40.979 --> 00:06:40.989 
of RAM only costs around 130 bucks is a

00:06:40.989 --> 00:06:42.389 
of RAM only costs around 130 bucks is a
good<00:06:41.110> idea<00:06:41.319> to<00:06:41.619> upgrade<00:06:41.949> if<00:06:42.129> you're<00:06:42.249> using

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:42.399 
good idea to upgrade if you're using

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:44.159 
good idea to upgrade if you're using
several<00:06:42.759> programs<00:06:43.179> at<00:06:43.419> the<00:06:43.569> same<00:06:43.689> time<00:06:43.929> and

00:06:44.159 --> 00:06:44.169 
several programs at the same time and

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:46.649 
several programs at the same time and
working<00:06:44.889> with<00:06:45.009> huge<00:06:45.249> projects<00:06:45.789> such<00:06:46.329> as<00:06:46.360> this

00:06:46.649 --> 00:06:46.659 
working with huge projects such as this

00:06:46.659 --> 00:06:49.319 
working with huge projects such as this
project<00:06:47.050> I'm<00:06:47.199> exporting<00:06:47.499> now<00:06:48.209> exporting<00:06:49.209> this

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:49.329 
project I'm exporting now exporting this

00:06:49.329 --> 00:06:51.209 
project I'm exporting now exporting this
project<00:06:49.689> will<00:06:49.869> take<00:06:49.899> ages<00:06:50.379> on<00:06:50.559> iMac<00:06:50.919> with<00:06:51.069> a

00:06:51.209 --> 00:06:51.219 
project will take ages on iMac with a

00:06:51.219 --> 00:06:53.339 
project will take ages on iMac with a
key<00:06:51.369> butter<00:06:51.550> Fram<00:06:51.849> here<00:06:52.629> it's<00:06:52.869> exporting

00:06:53.339 --> 00:06:53.349 
key butter Fram here it's exporting

00:06:53.349 --> 00:06:55.859 
key butter Fram here it's exporting
faster<00:06:53.819> okay<00:06:54.819> let's<00:06:54.969> speed<00:06:55.179> up<00:06:55.209> a<00:06:55.389> bit<00:06:55.419> and<00:06:55.719> see

00:06:55.859 --> 00:06:55.869 
faster okay let's speed up a bit and see

00:06:55.869 --> 00:07:01.469 
faster okay let's speed up a bit and see
how<00:06:55.899> much<00:06:56.169> RAM<00:06:56.409> is<00:06:56.529> using

00:07:01.469 --> 00:07:01.479 

00:07:01.479 --> 00:07:04.029 

yeah<00:07:02.479> after<00:07:02.689> white<00:07:02.960> is<00:07:03.169> actually<00:07:03.289> using<00:07:03.770> over

00:07:04.029 --> 00:07:04.039 
yeah after white is actually using over

00:07:04.039 --> 00:07:06.219 
yeah after white is actually using over
at<00:07:04.219> Kaiba<00:07:04.490> DRAM<00:07:04.789> and<00:07:04.999> together<00:07:05.810> with<00:07:06.139> the

00:07:06.219 --> 00:07:06.229 
at Kaiba DRAM and together with the

00:07:06.229 --> 00:07:07.929 
at Kaiba DRAM and together with the
other<00:07:06.379> programs<00:07:06.620> it's<00:07:07.069> using<00:07:07.400> almost<00:07:07.669> ten

00:07:07.929 --> 00:07:07.939 
other programs it's using almost ten

00:07:07.939 --> 00:07:08.499 
other programs it's using almost ten
gigabytes

00:07:08.499 --> 00:07:08.509

most<00:07:09.349> users<00:07:09.680> are<00:07:09.919> probably<00:07:10.310> not<00:07:10.430> working<00:07:10.789> with

00:07:10.899 --> 00:07:10.909 
most users are probably not working with

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:12.369 
most users are probably not working with
huge<00:07:11.120> files<00:07:11.389> in<00:07:11.689> After<00:07:11.960> Effects<00:07:12.169> and

huge files in After Effects and

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:14.830 
huge files in After Effects and
Photoshop<00:07:12.469> and<00:07:13.069> then<00:07:13.669> 16<00:07:14.120> gigabyte<00:07:14.330> of<00:07:14.449> RAM<00:07:14.629> is

Photoshop and then 16 gigabyte of RAM is

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:17.830 
Photoshop and then 16 gigabyte of RAM is
a<00:07:14.900> bit<00:07:15.139> overkill<00:07:15.529> in<00:07:15.710> my<00:07:16.069> opinion<00:07:16.539> but<00:07:17.539> for<00:07:17.719> us

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:17.840 
a bit overkill in my opinion but for us

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:20.439 
a bit overkill in my opinion but for us
