00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.340
 recommendations to mark muscle 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.660
 include protein in each meal 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.330
 weight training increase the 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.240
 protein needs the amino acids of 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.520
 protein foods like chicken 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.989
 skimmed dairy fish and meats 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.779
 lean are suitable for 

00:00:27.989 --> 00:00:32.580
 develop muscle many experts 

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:35.129
 in sports nutrition advise 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.080
 consume approximately 2 grams of 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:39.989
 protein per kilo of body weight 

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:42.390
 to increase the size of the 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.720
 muscles but we should carry 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.829
 this advice still further 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:50.100
 distributing protein grams 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.920
 needed in small portions the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.199
 number of meals consumed should dictate 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.070
 the amount of protein that we take to 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:01.949
 daily for example if we weigh 75 kilos and 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.129
 we consume 150 grams of protein 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:08.810
 daily we should think about taking 6 thomas 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:08.810
 of 25 grams each 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:14.460
 the flavor to your meals if you enjoy 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:16.830
 of the flavor of the spices can that without 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.840
 know you are stimulating the 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.510
 speed of your metabolism 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.940
 specifically the capsicum an ingredient 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.370
 of chile can stimulate the system 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.950
 nervous sympathetic to be added 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.290
 each goal to those who favor the 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.450
 expulsion of fatty acids from the 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:36.540
 fat cells to use it as 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:38.400
 fuel consume pepper index 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.890
 it is not the final answer to lose 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.050
 weight but over time the 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.530
 small increase in energy expenditure 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:50.310
 can be reflected on the scale 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.470
 alternate your caloric intake makes 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.930
 some years a popular study revealed 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.390
 that diets that followed a zigzag 

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.729
 caloric produced more fat loss 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.610
 than the one based on a caloric intake 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:04.860
 constant because the body can 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.560
 adapt quickly to a reduction 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.539
 caloric continues with a decrease in 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.940
 weight loss something that could 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:14.880
 correct themselves by making a kind of 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.570
 calorie citations instead of reducing 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:21.209
 your daily intake at 2500 calories 

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:25.019
 this system allows you to eat two days two 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:28.050
 thousand followed by two days of 2500 and 

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:30.540
 another two of 3000 and then repeats the 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.000
 process the average caloric intake 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.700
 must be below the level of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.830
 maintenance however any 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.780
 success in an infection variable 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.420
 caloric intake may not be the result of 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:43.650
 a metabolic stimulus but of simple 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.390
 condition 

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.250
 in other words those people who 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 get successes with this kind of 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.080
 nutrition strategy can enjoy 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.660
 of days with ample caloric intake 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.400
 also enjoy the days of food more 

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.710
 scarce because they feel they are 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.410
 losing fat get results 

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:03.690
 because they like the system and apply it 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.090
 to the letter in any case the 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.670
 empirical evidence shows that it is 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:11.630
 whatever the mechanism the diet of in 

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.630
 zigzag works 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.819
 and avoid refined foods and the 

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:19.760
 excess sugar carbohydrates 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:22.519
 refined like white bread rice 

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:24.590
 white fruit juice and many cereals 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:26.720
 for breakfast they move the 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.360
 healthier carbohydrates like potatoes 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.459
 cooked potatoes or beans 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.239
 integrals that contain more vitamins 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:36.470
 minerals and fiber some researchers 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:40.480
 they even believe that food 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.480
 refined are linked with obesity 

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:46.030
 eat more before training with weights and 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:47.980
 less before aerobics when 

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:50.740
 lift weights your body uses 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.780
 as fuel the accumulated sugar in 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.580
 muscle glycogen form 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.890
 as they continue to train they go down 

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:59.170
 those glycogen levels the tank 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.810
 body fuel is becoming exhausted and 

00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:04.990
 reduces the number of kilometers that 

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:07.360
 we can run from our five or six 

00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.670
 daily meals assured that there 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.980
 one before another training session 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:15.070
 hard that contains more carbohydrates for 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:17.620
 provide durable fuel to 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:20.140
 another side of the spectrum is the matter of 

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:22.270
 eat before doing aerobics 

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.340
 cardiovascular work is very much based on 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.350
 fatty acids derived from deposits 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:29.290
 of body fat as a source of 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.970
 fuel and some experts believe that 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:33.460
 make a meal before practicing this 

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:35.350
 type of exercise could disrupt the 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:37.600
 effects of fat cream due to 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.330
 the mechanisms first the fat of the 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.340
 food could usurp instead of the 

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.400
 body fat to be used as 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.169
 second and perhaps more convincing energy 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:49.479
 the hormonal effect of consumption 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.819
 of carbohydrates in the natural emission 

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:53.740
 of insulin that to a certain degree 

00:04:51.819 --> 00:04:55.900
 prevents the fat from being released from 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:58.150
 cells I think they get better 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.639
 results if you do not eat before doing 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:02.860
 aerobic seems to be useful but if you 

00:05:00.639 --> 00:05:04.900
 feel fatigued few dizziness or 

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.389
 you lack enough energy to 

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:09.490
 work hard you must take something before 

00:05:07.389 --> 00:05:10.990
 start training aerobics a 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:14.880
 slice of wholemeal bread with cheese 

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:17.700
 skimming over would be enough 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:20.010
 He works too much calories when he 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.050
 reduces the body's caloric intake 

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:25.050
 he is forced to look in his reserves 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.940
 of fat to get fuel without 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.770
 However, excessive reduction of 

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:30.570
 Daily calories may end 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:33.270
 consuming our valuable fabric 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:35.100
 muscular an ideal systematic for 

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:37.590
 develop the muscles and burn the 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:39.660
 fat to give the body amounts 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.910
 ideal carbohydrates and protein 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.530
 throughout the day at the time we create 

00:05:41.910 --> 00:05:46.140
 a total caloric reduction 

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:48.990
 relatively small for example vital 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:52.440
 from 10 to 15 percent of calories 

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:55.110
 enough already therefore a person 

00:05:52.440 --> 00:06:00.460
 75 kilos that consumes 3000 calories 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.830
 daily and will reduce to 2 thousand 550 or 2700 

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:04.690

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.490
