the lake cramps or what the issues might
be<00:00:38.170> but<00:00:38.500> we<00:00:38.769> narrowed<00:00:39.670> it<00:00:39.699> down<00:00:39.850> pretty

00:00:40.349 --> 00:00:40.359

so doing the Lake cramps and the foot

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:59.220 
so doing the Lake cramps and the foot
cramps<00:00:55.440> diminished<00:00:56.579> however<00:00:57.579> with<00:00:58.539> that<00:00:58.570> said

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230

of<00:01:14.140> all<00:01:14.230> like<00:01:14.440> I<00:01:14.620> mentioned<00:01:15.180> circulatory

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
of all like I mentioned circulatory

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.810 
of all like I mentioned circulatory
issues<00:01:16.420> can<00:01:16.870> be<00:01:16.900> one<00:01:17.470> of<00:01:17.620> the<00:01:17.680> causes<00:01:17.890> and<00:01:18.370> if

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:18.820 
issues can be one of the causes and if

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.570 
issues can be one of the causes and if
you<00:01:19.090> have<00:01:19.330> leg<00:01:19.630> cramps<00:01:19.660> or<00:01:20.200> foot<00:01:21.010> cramps<00:01:21.400> on<00:01:21.550> a

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:21.580 
you have leg cramps or foot cramps on a

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.790 
you have leg cramps or foot cramps on a
regular<00:01:21.910> basis<00:01:22.360> I<00:01:22.540> really<00:01:23.200> recommend<00:01:23.710> that

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:23.800 
regular basis I really recommend that

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.160 
regular basis I really recommend that
you<00:01:23.920> go<00:01:24.220> see<00:01:24.460> a<00:01:24.490> naturopathic<00:01:24.970> doctor<00:01:25.170> get

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
you go see a naturopathic doctor get

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.960 
you go see a naturopathic doctor get
checked<00:01:26.500> out<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.980> see<00:01:27.460> whether<00:01:27.700> or<00:01:27.880> not

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:27.970 
checked out and see whether or not

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:30.030 
checked out and see whether or not
that's<00:01:28.210> a<00:01:28.390> contributing<00:01:28.960> reason<00:01:29.530> for<00:01:29.890> your

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.040 
that's a contributing reason for your

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:33.090 
that's a contributing reason for your
foot<00:01:30.670> cramps<00:01:31.090> or<00:01:31.240> leg<00:01:31.990> cramps<00:01:32.470> so<00:01:32.800> another

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 
foot cramps or leg cramps so another

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.920 
foot cramps or leg cramps so another
reason<00:01:33.310> for<00:01:33.700> getting<00:01:33.790> foot<00:01:34.240> cramps<00:01:34.630> or<00:01:34.750> leg

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
reason for getting foot cramps or leg

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.380 
reason for getting foot cramps or leg
cramps<00:01:35.350> would<00:01:35.470> be<00:01:35.650> an<00:01:35.920> electrolyte<00:01:36.580> imbalance

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
cramps would be an electrolyte imbalance

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:38.730 
cramps would be an electrolyte imbalance
or<00:01:37.540> depletion<00:01:37.960> of<00:01:38.170> electrolytes

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
or depletion of electrolytes

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.430 
or depletion of electrolytes
electrolytes<00:01:39.090> are<00:01:40.090> minerals<00:01:40.510> and<00:01:40.810> the<00:01:41.200> three

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:41.440 
electrolytes are minerals and the three

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:44.040 
electrolytes are minerals and the three
main<00:01:41.650> ones<00:01:41.830> are<00:01:42.190> calcium<00:01:42.940> magnesium<00:01:43.420> and

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
main ones are calcium magnesium and

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.310 
main ones are calcium magnesium and
potassium<00:01:44.730> so<00:01:45.730> if<00:01:46.270> someone<00:01:46.750> goes<00:01:47.020> to<00:01:47.080> the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
potassium so if someone goes to the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.030 
potassium so if someone goes to the
sauna<00:01:47.640> sweats<00:01:48.640> a<00:01:48.790> lot<00:01:48.820> or<00:01:49.620> exercises<00:01:50.620> sweats<00:01:50.920> a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
sauna sweats a lot or exercises sweats a

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.240 
sauna sweats a lot or exercises sweats a
lot

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
lot

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:53.310 
lot
you<00:01:52.210> can<00:01:52.360> easily<00:01:52.570> lose<00:01:52.930> a<00:01:52.960> lot<00:01:53.230> of

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.320 
you can easily lose a lot of

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.370 
you can easily lose a lot of
electrolytes<00:01:53.890> and<00:01:54.510> that<00:01:55.510> is<00:01:55.780> definitely<00:01:56.080> a

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:56.380 
electrolytes and that is definitely a

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.260 
electrolytes and that is definitely a
contributing<00:01:56.920> cause<00:01:56.980> to<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.550> foot<00:01:57.790> cramps<00:01:58.150> or

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
contributing cause to a foot cramps or

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.540 
contributing cause to a foot cramps or
leg<00:01:58.450> cramps<00:01:58.840> and<00:01:58.990> finally<00:01:59.800> another<00:02:00.070> major

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:00.550 
leg cramps and finally another major

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.420 
leg cramps and finally another major
reason<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:01.180> when<00:02:01.450> there's<00:02:02.110> cold<00:02:02.500> feet<00:02:02.860> or<00:02:03.130> cold

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:03.430 
reason is when there's cold feet or cold

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.430 
reason is when there's cold feet or cold
legs<00:02:03.790> that<00:02:04.150> can<00:02:04.360> contribute<00:02:04.660> to<00:02:04.870> leg<00:02:05.110> cramps

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:05.440 
legs that can contribute to leg cramps

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.350 
legs that can contribute to leg cramps
or<00:02:05.530> foot<00:02:05.710> cramps<00:02:06.040> so<00:02:06.340> if<00:02:06.580> one<00:02:06.820> of<00:02:06.970> the<00:02:07.030> reasons

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:07.360 
or foot cramps so if one of the reasons

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.150 
or foot cramps so if one of the reasons
why<00:02:07.480> we<00:02:07.660> get<00:02:07.810> leg<00:02:08.019> cramps<00:02:08.349> or<00:02:08.470> foot<00:02:08.649> cramps<00:02:09.009> is

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:09.160 
why we get leg cramps or foot cramps is

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:11.360 
why we get leg cramps or foot cramps is
a<00:02:09.190> lack<00:02:09.489> of<00:02:09.519> electrolytes<00:02:10.209> or<00:02:10.420> electrolyte

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
a lack of electrolytes or electrolyte

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.010 
a lack of electrolytes or electrolyte
depletion<00:02:12.370> then<00:02:12.940> obviously<00:02:13.180> it<00:02:13.600> makes<00:02:13.780> sense

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
depletion then obviously it makes sense

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:16.050 
depletion then obviously it makes sense
to<00:02:14.290> put<00:02:14.620> electrolytes<00:02:15.190> back<00:02:15.460> into<00:02:15.820> the

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
to put electrolytes back into the

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.880 
to put electrolytes back into the
and<00:02:16.480> I've<00:02:16.690> been<00:02:16.840> using<00:02:16.900> an<00:02:17.349> electrolyte

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
and I've been using an electrolyte

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.680 
and I've been using an electrolyte
replenisher<00:02:18.250> for<00:02:19.090> quite<00:02:19.270> some<00:02:19.480> time<00:02:19.660> now

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
replenisher for quite some time now

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:22.949 
replenisher for quite some time now
several<00:02:20.140> years<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.770> it's<00:02:21.489> called<00:02:21.790> Ultima<00:02:22.750> I

00:02:22.949 --> 00:02:22.959 
several years and it's called Ultima I

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:25.170 
several years and it's called Ultima I
highly<00:02:23.770> recommend<00:02:24.250> it<00:02:24.400> I<00:02:24.550> actually<00:02:24.730> met<00:02:25.150> the

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
highly recommend it I actually met the

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:28.770 
highly recommend it I actually met the
rep<00:02:25.540> from<00:02:25.920> Ultima<00:02:26.920> many<00:02:27.700> many<00:02:27.910> years<00:02:28.180> ago<00:02:28.360> they

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
rep from Ultima many many years ago they

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.780 
rep from Ultima many many years ago they
gave<00:02:29.050> me<00:02:29.380> a<00:02:29.410> great<00:02:29.800> story<00:02:30.010> about<00:02:30.430> what<00:02:30.610> they<00:02:30.730> do

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
gave me a great story about what they do

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:32.729 
gave me a great story about what they do
no<00:02:31.300> artificial<00:02:31.660> anything<00:02:31.989> it's<00:02:32.410> all<00:02:32.560> natural

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
no artificial anything it's all natural

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.030 
no artificial anything it's all natural
and<00:02:33.190> so<00:02:34.090> I've<00:02:34.330> been<00:02:34.450> using<00:02:34.660> it<00:02:34.959> almost<00:02:35.530> every

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
and so I've been using it almost every

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:38.670 
and so I've been using it almost every
single<00:02:36.250> day<00:02:36.519> and<00:02:36.970> I<00:02:37.690> don't<00:02:38.170> have<00:02:38.290> any<00:02:38.440> tie<00:02:38.620> to

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:38.680 
single day and I don't have any tie to

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.979 
single day and I don't have any tie to
them<00:02:39.040> but<00:02:39.370> I<00:02:39.580> really<00:02:39.880> do<00:02:40.180> like<00:02:40.330> their<00:02:40.569> product

00:02:40.979 --> 00:02:40.989 
them but I really do like their product

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:44.940 
them but I really do like their product
and<00:02:41.200> so<00:02:42.130> if<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.550> get<00:02:42.610> a<00:02:43.030> cramp<00:02:43.390> at<00:02:43.630> night<00:02:43.810> and<00:02:44.200> I

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
and so if I get a cramp at night and I

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.490 
and so if I get a cramp at night and I
know<00:02:45.160> that<00:02:45.790> I've<00:02:46.060> either<00:02:46.450> exercised<00:02:47.110> really

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
know that I've either exercised really

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.440 
know that I've either exercised really
hard<00:02:47.709> that<00:02:47.920> day<00:02:47.950> or<00:02:48.430> I<00:02:48.459> went<00:02:48.640> to<00:02:48.790> the<00:02:48.880> sauna<00:02:49.120> and

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.450 
hard that day or I went to the sauna and

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.420 
hard that day or I went to the sauna and
sweated<00:02:49.840> I'll<00:02:50.230> immediately<00:02:50.650> take<00:02:51.220> some

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
sweated I'll immediately take some

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.090 
sweated I'll immediately take some
altima<00:02:51.880> and<00:02:52.290> that<00:02:53.290> will<00:02:53.440> definitely<00:02:53.650> help

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
altima and that will definitely help

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.940 
altima and that will definitely help
subdue<00:02:54.819> the<00:02:55.269> late<00:02:55.720> cramp<00:02:55.959> or<00:02:56.170> foot<00:02:56.350> cramp<00:02:56.650> so

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
subdue the late cramp or foot cramp so

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.039 
subdue the late cramp or foot cramp so
if<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.370> think<00:02:57.549> that<00:02:57.670> there's<00:02:58.120> an<00:02:58.510> electrolyte

00:02:59.039 --> 00:02:59.049 
if you think that there's an electrolyte

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:00.960 
if you think that there's an electrolyte
imbalance<00:02:59.680> and<00:02:59.890> you<00:03:00.100> take<00:03:00.310> an<00:03:00.459> electrolyte

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:00.970 
imbalance and you take an electrolyte

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:02.940 
imbalance and you take an electrolyte
replenisher<00:03:01.150> that<00:03:01.930> definitely<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.680> a<00:03:02.709> good

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
replenisher that definitely is a good

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:06.839 
replenisher that definitely is a good
idea<00:03:03.310> that's<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.180> first<00:03:05.220> method<00:03:06.220> and<00:03:06.400> then

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:06.849 
idea that's the first method and then

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:09.059 
idea that's the first method and then
number<00:03:07.360> two<00:03:07.690> would<00:03:07.840> be<00:03:07.900> take<00:03:08.440> magnesium

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
number two would be take magnesium

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:11.640 
number two would be take magnesium
because<00:03:09.310> magnesium<00:03:09.670> is<00:03:10.480> also<00:03:11.049> not<00:03:11.500> only

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
because magnesium is also not only

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.520 
because magnesium is also not only
electrolyte<00:03:12.310> but<00:03:12.940> it<00:03:13.120> calms<00:03:13.480> the<00:03:13.870> muscles<00:03:14.260> it

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
electrolyte but it calms the muscles it

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.039 
electrolyte but it calms the muscles it
calms<00:03:14.860> everything<00:03:15.340> down<00:03:15.730> and<00:03:16.030> speaking<00:03:16.930> of

remedies I told you about and I did a
little<00:05:19.780> research<00:05:20.460> what's<00:05:21.460> inside<00:05:21.850> this

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
little research what's inside this

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:25.440 
little research what's inside this
product<00:05:23.050> is<00:05:23.310> ginger<00:05:24.310> apple<00:05:24.940> cider<00:05:25.300> vinegar

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.890 
product is ginger apple cider vinegar
and<00:05:25.930> garlic<00:05:26.710> and<00:05:27.450> entrusting<00:05:28.450> ly<00:05:28.570> enough<00:05:28.750> I

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:28.900 
and garlic and entrusting ly enough I

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:30.090 
and garlic and entrusting ly enough I
did<00:05:29.050> a<00:05:29.080> little<00:05:29.230> research<00:05:29.380> on<00:05:29.710> those<00:05:29.890> three

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
did a little research on those three

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.500 
did a little research on those three
ingredients<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.760> guess<00:05:30.940> what<00:05:31.180> they<00:05:31.360> have<00:05:31.480> a

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
ingredients and guess what they have a

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:34.140 
ingredients and guess what they have a
lot<00:05:31.780> of<00:05:31.930> potassium<00:05:32.350> each<00:05:32.890> ingredient<00:05:33.400> has<00:05:33.880> a

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
lot of potassium each ingredient has a

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.290 
lot of potassium each ingredient has a
lot<00:05:34.300> of<00:05:34.420> potassium<00:05:35.430> they<00:05:36.430> don't<00:05:36.610> say<00:05:36.910> whether

00:05:37.290 --> 00:05:37.300 
lot of potassium they don't say whether

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.500 
lot of potassium they don't say whether
or<00:05:37.390> not<00:05:37.540> that's<00:05:38.110> the<00:05:38.440> exact<00:05:38.800> reason<00:05:39.130> but<00:05:40.060> I

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
or not that's the exact reason but I

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.630 
or not that's the exact reason but I
have<00:05:41.080> a<00:05:41.170> sneaking<00:05:41.590> suspicion<00:05:41.650> that<00:05:42.250> that<00:05:42.520> has

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:42.640 
have a sneaking suspicion that that has

00:05:42.640 --> 00:05:45.060 
have a sneaking suspicion that that has
a<00:05:42.670> lot<00:05:43.030> to<00:05:43.060> do<00:05:43.300> with<00:05:43.420> this<00:05:43.570> so<00:05:43.870> I<00:05:44.140> think<00:05:44.650> that

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:45.070 
a lot to do with this so I think that

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:47.190 
a lot to do with this so I think that
this<00:05:45.550> product<00:05:45.880> probably<00:05:46.270> gets<00:05:46.540> potassium

00:05:47.190 --> 00:05:47.200 
this product probably gets potassium

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.860 
this product probably gets potassium
into<00:05:47.560> the<00:05:47.590> body<00:05:47.830> quickly<00:05:48.280> it's<00:05:49.240> they<00:05:49.480> call<00:05:49.720> it

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:49.870 
into the body quickly it's they call it

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:53.520 
into the body quickly it's they call it
an<00:05:49.990> old<00:05:50.290> Amish<00:05:50.920> formula<00:05:51.910> and<00:05:52.270> all<00:05:53.020> I<00:05:53.050> can<00:05:53.290> say

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
an old Amish formula and all I can say

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.280 
an old Amish formula and all I can say
is<00:05:53.830> that<00:05:54.130> it<00:05:54.340> definitely<00:05:54.880> works<00:05:55.240> ok<00:05:55.930> so<00:05:55.990> now

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:56.290 
is that it definitely works ok so now

00:05:56.290 --> 00:05:57.960 
is that it definitely works ok so now
you<00:05:56.350> have<00:05:56.530> four<00:05:56.560> natural<00:05:57.070> remedies<00:05:57.610> that<00:05:57.820> you
