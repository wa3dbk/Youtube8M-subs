 dsr which passes annually already 96 years 

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:38.920
 to be exact, it was formed yet 

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:41.650
 86 then he was somewhat poppin 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.540
 the consequence of which was unprofitable from 96 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.129
 changed direction on heavy metal 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.950

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.680
 viewers wondering what festival never 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:54.780
 not 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.569
 venue and every year since 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:59.640
 the first composition is very bold for example 

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.219
 gene sixth year outing steel liners 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.019

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.439
 slipknot chelsea grin 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.090
 and many others the sixth line though 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:19.680
 it would be better to mark it with three 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.379
 sixes because on it 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.299
 located the festival of smallpox with which 

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.700

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.019

 spray entered the mass such popular 

00:03:37.019 --> 00:03:42.419
 groups like south park slipknot linguists 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:45.150
 and many others last time with 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:47.040
 held in 2013 in Japan and we will 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:51.019
 hope that he will come back at the head 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:51.019
 salt and his team black sabbath 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:56.370
 we crossed the equator and the screams of Pyaterochka 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.919

00:03:56.370 --> 00:04:01.409
 the place remains at the monsters of festival 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:03.959
 rock that appeared to be eaten away 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:06.239
 eightieth year in england and he's alive till 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:08.400
 so far, though held irregularly 

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:10.500
 but each show is marked by large-scale 

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.900
 glitter to the music of real monsters 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.269
 rock in the form of such metallica banks and 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.459
 sitis panther scorpion with not many 

00:04:15.269 --> 00:04:19.919
 other that this effect is remarkable 

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.900
 held even in the USSR ninety-first 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.599

 viewers according to various estimates from 600 thousand 

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:27.949
 up to one million people 

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:33.300
 on the fourth line is given 

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:35.969
 festival and for uk which 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:38.129
 2003 annually holds a three-day 

00:04:35.969 --> 00:04:39.419
 rock marathon on one of the fields of size 

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:40.979
 several hundred hectares 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:42.569
 very popular data 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:44.550
 used not only because 

00:04:42.569 --> 00:04:46.740
 that up to 100 are gathered here every year 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.960
 thousands of heavy music fans perform 

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.909
 different world stars but still from convenient 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.520
 special entertainment locations 

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:55.620
 sound energy programs 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.389
 fans have something in this place 

00:04:55.620 --> 00:05:00.139
 fantastic there you are definitely not 

00:04:57.389 --> 00:05:00.139
 you get bored 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:05.729
 so we got to the top 3 most 

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.680
 stately fastov and in third place 

00:05:05.729 --> 00:05:11.009
 germany with rock am ring festival 

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:13.050
 which was founded in 1985 and 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:15.150
 first held sole 

00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:17.789
 preserved military swimmer since the 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:19.889
 Nazi Germany on which another 45 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.930
 years ago hundreds of thousands of Germans took the oath 

00:05:19.889 --> 00:05:24.090
 Allegiance to the Fuhrer Adolf Hitler 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.669
 it was there that tens of thousands gathered 

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:28.439
 music lovers and laid the foundation 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.229
 becoming a great festival which 

00:05:28.439 --> 00:05:32.550
 annually collects up to a million viewers 

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:34.379
 all the stars who performed there 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.539
 list is very difficult because 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.789
 every year guest list increases 

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.819
 but I think that the presence of such musicians on 

00:05:38.789 --> 00:05:45.810
 fest as 11 osbourne bryan adams &amp; 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:48.000
 sting says a lot second line 

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:50.129
 takes the moat festival which 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.750

 Europe is not only one of the most 

00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:56.279
 scale but another one of the oldest 

00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.699
 Fastov it was founded in the farthest two 

00:05:56.279 --> 00:06:02.000
 high school students in 1971 and that 

00:05:59.699 --> 00:06:04.400
 truly surprised since family 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.730
 1 year raskin is held every year in 

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:10.880

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:15.320
 I take part many stars of the world 

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:18.230

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:22.910
 the date is here only during this time not 

00:06:20.630 --> 00:06:23.510
 It was easier to call those who are still here 

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.520
 did not have 

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:27.410
 with regard to the number of viewers 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:30.140

 amounted to 133,000 people though 

00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:39.669
 the organizers hope to beat him already 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:42.110
 June 2015 and I think they will succeed 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:43.669
 first place deservedly won the most 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:46.360
