00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
sort of different subtle difference to

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.400 
sort of different subtle difference to
how<00:02:38.790> they<00:02:38.970> sound<00:02:39.300> on<00:02:39.660> the<00:02:39.750> harmonica<00:02:40.260> but

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
how they sound on the harmonica but

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.949 
how they sound on the harmonica but
they're<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.590> same<00:02:40.620> note<00:02:41.070> so<00:02:41.730> I'm<00:02:41.880> playing<00:02:42.570> to

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
they're the same note so I'm playing to

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.500 
they're the same note so I'm playing to
draw<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.650> then<00:02:44.400> the<00:02:44.520> next<00:02:44.910> note<00:02:45.060> again<00:02:45.480> a

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
draw and then the next note again a

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.729 
draw and then the next note again a
contentious<00:02:46.230> one<00:02:47.420> it's<00:02:48.420> three<00:02:48.959> draw<00:02:49.320> and<00:02:49.620> it's

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
contentious one it's three draw and it's

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:51.830 
contentious one it's three draw and it's
either<00:02:49.950> the<00:02:50.280> first<00:02:50.459> Bend<00:02:50.850> or<00:02:51.030> the<00:02:51.239> second<00:02:51.630> Bend

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
either the first Bend or the second Bend

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.479 
either the first Bend or the second Bend
on<00:02:52.050> three<00:02:53.150> if<00:02:54.150> you<00:02:54.300> can't<00:02:54.570> bend<00:02:54.900> just<00:02:55.489> miss

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
on three if you can't bend just miss

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:59.120 
on three if you can't bend just miss
this<00:02:56.790> note<00:02:57.090> out<00:02:57.360> that's<00:02:57.660> okay<00:02:57.920> but<00:02:58.920> if<00:02:59.040> you're

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
this note out that's okay but if you're

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.720 
this note out that's okay but if you're
getting<00:02:59.310> bends<00:02:59.700> then<00:03:00.860> either<00:03:01.860> start<00:03:02.430> on<00:03:02.610> the

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:02.730 
getting bends then either start on the

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:05.330 
getting bends then either start on the
second<00:03:03.239> Bend<00:03:03.480> or<00:03:03.780> the<00:03:04.140> first<00:03:04.350> Bend<00:03:04.709> and<00:03:04.980> you

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
second Bend or the first Bend and you

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.780 
second Bend or the first Bend and you
have<00:03:05.520> to<00:03:05.670> bend<00:03:05.910> up<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.570> three<00:03:06.989> draw<00:03:07.790> the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
have to bend up to three draw the

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:16.280 
have to bend up to three draw the
natural<00:03:09.390> note<00:03:10.340> so<00:03:11.340> like<00:03:11.640> this<00:03:14.810> but<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.930> goes<00:03:16.110> by

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
natural note so like this but it goes by

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.229 
natural note so like this but it goes by
so<00:03:16.709> quickly<00:03:17.130> if<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.459> listen<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.850> the<00:03:17.940> track

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
so quickly if you listen to the track

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:20.030 
so quickly if you listen to the track
that<00:03:18.269> is<00:03:18.630> hard<00:03:18.840> to<00:03:18.989> tell<00:03:19.200> exactly<00:03:19.410> what<00:03:19.890> he's

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
that is hard to tell exactly what he's

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:20.420 
that is hard to tell exactly what he's
doing

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:20.430

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:16.020 
you're a you're able to get the octave

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:20.690 
you're a you're able to get the octave
split<00:04:16.320> then<00:04:16.560> play<00:04:16.859> it<00:04:18.109> so<00:04:19.109> to<00:04:19.620> draw<00:04:19.859> three

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
split then play it so to draw three

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.730 
split then play it so to draw three
I'm<00:04:21.390> gonna<00:04:21.540> stay<00:04:21.750> second<00:04:22.170> Ben<00:04:22.320> but<00:04:22.560> I'm<00:04:22.650> not

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:28.410 
it's so fast three draw and then four or

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:36.470 
it's so fast three draw and then four or
five<00:04:28.770> blow<00:04:29.070> three<00:04:29.850> six<00:04:30.300> blow<00:04:30.720> octave<00:04:32.270> I<00:04:35.480> need

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
five blow three six blow octave I need

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:38.360 
five blow three six blow octave I need
to<00:04:36.630> retune<00:04:37.080> my<00:04:37.260> harmonica<00:04:37.470> that<00:04:37.830> octaves<00:04:38.220> are

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:38.370 
to retune my harmonica that octaves are

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:30.650 

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:33.830 

so<00:06:31.650> that<00:06:31.830> is<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.250> opening<00:06:32.850> riff<00:06:33.060> to<00:06:33.300> Juke<00:06:33.540> I'm

00:06:33.830 --> 00:06:33.840 
so that is the opening riff to Juke I'm

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.810 
so that is the opening riff to Juke I'm
thinking<00:06:34.170> about<00:06:34.260> doing<00:06:34.590> a<00:06:35.010> whole<00:06:35.280> lesson<00:06:35.520> on

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820 
thinking about doing a whole lesson on

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:38.150 
thinking about doing a whole lesson on
the<00:06:36.060> whole<00:06:36.660> song<00:06:36.960> there's<00:06:37.200> so<00:06:37.350> much<00:06:37.530> to<00:06:37.830> it<00:06:37.860> I

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
the whole song there's so much to it I

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:41.000 
the whole song there's so much to it I
thought<00:06:38.940> I'd<00:06:39.090> just<00:06:39.210> start<00:06:39.510> with<00:06:39.830> just<00:06:40.830> the

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:41.010 
thought I'd just start with just the

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.500 
thought I'd just start with just the
intro<00:06:41.580> riff<00:06:41.790> I<00:06:41.970> hope<00:06:42.090> that's<00:06:42.330> been<00:06:42.450> helpful

00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:42.510 
intro riff I hope that's been helpful

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.020 
intro riff I hope that's been helpful
for<00:06:42.960> you<00:06:43.350> getting<00:06:43.650> you<00:06:43.770> a<00:06:43.800> footing<00:06:44.700> on<00:06:44.850> this

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:45.030 
for you getting you a footing on this

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:46.610 
for you getting you a footing on this
song<00:06:45.330> good<00:06:45.870> luck<00:06:46.050> and<00:06:46.260> I'll<00:06:46.350> see<00:06:46.500> you<00:06:46.590> again

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:46.620
