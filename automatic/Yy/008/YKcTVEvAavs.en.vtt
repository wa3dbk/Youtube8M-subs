00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:55.690 
here maybe maybe not I don't know I'm

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.280 
here maybe maybe not I don't know I'm
just<00:02:55.780> assuming<00:02:56.730> no<00:02:57.730> nothing<00:02:58.180> see<00:02:58.810> I'm<00:02:59.020> just

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
just assuming no nothing see I'm just

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:02.250 
just assuming no nothing see I'm just
assuming<00:02:59.590> that<00:03:00.310> this<00:03:00.670> is<00:03:00.940> where<00:03:01.300> the<00:03:01.900> secret

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
assuming that this is where the secret

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.360 
assuming that this is where the secret
exit<00:03:02.590> is<00:03:02.890> is<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:04.840> ghost<00:03:05.050> house<00:03:05.290> he<00:03:06.160> didn't

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
exit is is the ghost house he didn't

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.540 
exit is is the ghost house he didn't
actually<00:03:06.550> tell<00:03:06.910> me<00:03:07.830> he<00:03:08.830> just<00:03:09.040> said<00:03:09.220> yeah<00:03:09.490> you

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:09.550 
actually tell me he just said yeah you

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.890 
actually tell me he just said yeah you
missed<00:03:09.970> secret<00:03:10.810> exit<00:03:11.200> in<00:03:11.410> world<00:03:11.770> too<00:03:12.810> and<00:03:13.810> you

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
missed secret exit in world too and you

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.050 
missed secret exit in world too and you
missed<00:03:14.110> the<00:03:14.260> secret<00:03:14.590> area<00:03:14.950> or<00:03:15.280> secret<00:03:15.760> level

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
missed the secret area or secret level

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:24.480 
missed the secret area or secret level
world<00:03:16.300> one<00:03:19.500> so

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:24.490 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.690 

I've<00:03:25.480> no<00:03:26.050> idea<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:26.740> I'll<00:03:26.830> be<00:03:27.010> right<00:03:27.190> back<00:03:27.370> as<00:03:27.580> I

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:27.700 
I've no idea so I'll be right back as I

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.640 
I've no idea so I'll be right back as I
go<00:03:27.850> look<00:03:28.090> okay<00:03:28.870> well<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.110> found<00:03:29.380> something

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
go look okay well I found something

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.650 
go look okay well I found something
interesting<00:03:29.920> I<00:03:30.490> start<00:03:30.940> selected<00:03:31.480> out<00:03:31.630> of

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:31.660 
interesting I start selected out of

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:33.750 
interesting I start selected out of
there<00:03:31.960> because<00:03:32.140> I<00:03:32.350> can<00:03:32.530> find<00:03:32.860> anything<00:03:33.310> but

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:33.760 
there because I can find anything but

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:35.760 
there because I can find anything but
when<00:03:33.940> I<00:03:33.970> entered<00:03:34.360> again<00:03:34.630> to<00:03:34.900> look<00:03:35.320> around<00:03:35.560> some

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:35.770 
when I entered again to look around some

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:38.820 
when I entered again to look around some
more<00:03:35.830> oh<00:03:36.250> no<00:03:37.060> new<00:03:37.450> area<00:03:37.960> with<00:03:38.290> a<00:03:38.320> key<00:03:38.650> in

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:38.830 
more oh no new area with a key in

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.450 
more oh no new area with a key in
keyhole<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:40.120> I'm<00:03:40.570> assuming<00:03:40.810> it's<00:03:41.500> a<00:03:41.800> midway

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:42.460 
keyhole so I'm assuming it's a midway

00:03:42.460 --> 00:03:44.820 
keyhole so I'm assuming it's a midway
point<00:03:42.670> either<00:03:43.000> you<00:03:43.450> die<00:03:43.780> and<00:03:44.230> you<00:03:44.410> go<00:03:44.560> to<00:03:44.620> the

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
point either you die and you go to the

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.010 
point either you die and you go to the
secret<00:03:45.130> exit<00:03:45.460> or<00:03:45.670> you<00:03:46.180> start<00:03:46.420> select<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:46.900> I

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:47.020 
secret exit or you start select like I

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:51.480 
secret exit or you start select like I
did<00:03:47.230> and<00:03:47.470> you<00:03:47.590> go<00:03:47.710> to<00:03:47.770> the<00:03:47.980> secret<00:03:48.280> exit<00:03:49.950> so<00:03:50.950> now

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:51.490 
did and you go to the secret exit so now

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:55.910 
did and you go to the secret exit so now
