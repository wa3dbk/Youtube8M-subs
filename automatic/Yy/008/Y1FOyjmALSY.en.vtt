outside<00:02:59.150> we<00:02:59.870> have<00:02:59.990> a<00:03:00.020> lot<00:03:00.200> of<00:03:00.230> visitors<00:03:00.590> in<00:03:00.770> the

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.710

building and we're not the only sport
and<00:03:03.500> I<00:03:03.620> think<00:03:03.860> I'd<00:03:04.010> say<00:03:04.570> it's<00:03:05.570> a<00:03:05.630> big<00:03:05.840> deal

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:05.990 
and I think I'd say it's a big deal

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:08.560 
and I think I'd say it's a big deal
because<00:03:06.260> because<00:03:07.250> when<00:03:07.850> they<00:03:08.000> get<00:03:08.300> with

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
because because when they get with

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.210 
because because when they get with
people<00:03:08.870> get<00:03:09.050> inside<00:03:09.410> this<00:03:09.650> and<00:03:09.800> I'll<00:03:09.890> just<00:03:10.040> say

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:10.220 
people get inside this and I'll just say

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.979 
people get inside this and I'll just say
when<00:03:10.400> visitors<00:03:10.790> get<00:03:11.060> inside<00:03:11.600> of<00:03:11.840> this

00:03:11.979 --> 00:03:11.989 
when visitors get inside of this

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:14.229 
when visitors get inside of this

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:18.370 
the first time or they haven't been here
very<00:03:16.280> often<00:03:16.670> it<00:03:17.060> is<00:03:17.330> an<00:03:17.630> incredible

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.810 
you feel because we're here every day

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
and the feeling continues to grow and

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.170 
and the feeling continues to grow and
they<00:03:31.880> just<00:03:32.150> test<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.690> mean<00:03:33.019> it's<00:03:33.910> I've<00:03:34.910> seen

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
they just test I mean it's I've seen

they just test I mean it's I've seen
that<00:03:35.300> video<00:03:35.510> now<00:03:36.970> because<00:03:37.970> it<00:03:38.090> was<00:03:38.180> there<00:03:38.330> for

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
that video now because it was there for

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.570 
that video now because it was there for
the<00:03:38.570> beginning<00:03:38.720> of<00:03:39.140> it<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:40.100> how<00:03:40.220> it<00:03:40.280> was<00:03:40.400> put

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:40.580 
the beginning of it and how it was put

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.280 
the beginning of it and how it was put
together<00:03:40.790> I<00:03:41.090> probably<00:03:41.390> seen<00:03:41.660> it<00:03:41.780> five<00:03:41.930> six

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:42.290 
together I probably seen it five six

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:45.710 
together I probably seen it five six
times<00:03:42.580> and<00:03:43.580> I<00:03:43.910> mean<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:44.510> our<00:03:44.690> about<00:03:44.989> to

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:45.720 
times and I mean it's our about to

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:47.750 
times and I mean it's our about to
your<00:03:46.290> eyes<00:03:46.410> wide<00:03:46.710> look<00:03:47.070> at<00:03:47.190> that<00:03:47.430> and<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:47.610> was

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
your eyes wide look at that and I was

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.580 
your eyes wide look at that and I was
aiming<00:03:48.060> around<00:03:48.270> from<00:03:48.690> it<00:03:48.990> for<00:03:49.200> those<00:03:49.320> players

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
aiming around from it for those players

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.520 
aiming around from it for those players
so<00:03:50.550> if<00:03:51.270> there's<00:03:51.480> something<00:03:51.870> special<00:03:52.110> about<00:03:52.350> it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
so if there's something special about it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.140 
so if there's something special about it
I<00:03:52.830> think<00:03:53.070> people<00:03:53.280> that<00:03:53.580> come<00:03:53.790> into<00:03:53.970> this

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:54.150 
I think people that come into this

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.470 
I think people that come into this
building<00:03:54.210> they<00:03:54.750> they<00:03:54.960> feel<00:03:55.200> that<00:03:56.060> now<00:03:57.060> I

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:57.480 
building they they feel that now I

pretty created and see how fast four

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:19.130 
pretty created and see how fast four
years<00:04:17.160> gone<00:04:17.430> by<00:04:17.489> so<00:04:17.970> that<00:04:18.209> was<00:04:18.840> pretty<00:04:18.959> special

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
years gone by so that was pretty special

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:21.590 
years gone by so that was pretty special
for<00:04:19.440> me<00:04:19.680> I<00:04:19.890> think<00:04:20.670> everyone<00:04:21.060> appreciates

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:21.600 
for me I think everyone appreciates

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.230 
for me I think everyone appreciates
where<00:04:21.840> we've<00:04:22.019> been<00:04:22.170> and<00:04:22.580> I<00:04:23.580> think<00:04:23.820> it's<00:04:24.000> rare

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
where we've been and I think it's rare

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.560 
where we've been and I think it's rare
when<00:04:24.420> you<00:04:24.540> find<00:04:24.810> somebody<00:04:25.190> that<00:04:26.190> that<00:04:26.670> that

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
when you find somebody that that that

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.080 
when you find somebody that that that
doesn't<00:04:27.870> but<00:04:28.320> that's<00:04:28.590> followed<00:04:28.950> this<00:04:29.130> from

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
doesn't but that's followed this from

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.930 
doesn't but that's followed this from
long<00:04:30.300> before<00:04:30.690> we<00:04:31.170> got<00:04:31.380> here<00:04:31.650> but<00:04:32.580> especially

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:32.940 
long before we got here but especially

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.730 
long before we got here but especially
over<00:04:33.600> this<00:04:33.690> period<00:04:33.930> of<00:04:34.110> time<00:04:34.290> since<00:04:34.530> we've

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
over this period of time since we've

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:36.080 
over this period of time since we've
been<00:04:34.890> here<00:04:35.040> with<00:04:35.280> everything<00:04:35.700> that<00:04:35.880> that's

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:36.090 
been here with everything that that's

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.590 
been here with everything that that's
gone<00:04:36.330> on<00:04:36.360> and<00:04:36.810> what<00:04:36.960> we<00:04:37.740> all<00:04:37.890> had<00:04:38.070> my<00:04:38.280> door<00:04:38.490> so<00:04:38.880> I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
gone on and what we all had my door so I

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.390 
gone on and what we all had my door so I
think<00:04:40.169> they're<00:04:40.530> the<00:04:40.620> same<00:04:40.800> way<00:04:41.010> I<00:04:41.040> don't<00:04:41.280> think

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:41.400 
think they're the same way I don't think

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.800 
think they're the same way I don't think
they<00:04:41.520> take<00:04:41.550> winning<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.180> credit<00:04:42.510> I<00:04:42.600> think

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
they take winning for credit I think

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.630 
they take winning for credit I think
this<00:04:42.960> is<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.200> payoff<00:04:43.530> right<00:04:43.950> now<00:04:44.160> to<00:04:44.220> have<00:04:44.460> this

00:04:44.630 --> 00:04:44.640 
this is a payoff right now to have this

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.240 
this is a payoff right now to have this
kind<00:04:44.850> of<00:04:44.970> excitement<00:04:45.300> energy<00:04:45.930> passion<00:04:46.250> for

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250 
kind of excitement energy passion for

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.580 
kind of excitement energy passion for
all<00:04:47.340> that<00:04:47.550> they<00:04:47.760> have<00:04:47.960> supported<00:04:48.960> us<00:04:49.050> with<00:04:49.320> and

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
all that they have supported us with and

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:51.560 
all that they have supported us with and
I<00:04:49.950> think<00:04:50.190> it<00:04:50.310> says<00:04:50.520> a<00:04:50.550> lot<00:04:50.669> about<00:04:50.820> the<00:04:51.180> recruits

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:51.570 
I think it says a lot about the recruits

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:54.830 
I think it says a lot about the recruits
that<00:04:51.960> that<00:04:52.410> that<00:04:53.160> took<00:04:53.490> chances<00:04:53.790> on<00:04:54.210> this<00:04:54.450> and

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:54.840 
that that that took chances on this and

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.580 
that that that took chances on this and
when<00:04:55.530> it<00:04:55.650> went<00:04:55.860> it<00:04:55.950> when<00:04:56.100> it<00:04:56.250> wasn't<00:04:57.500> when<00:04:58.500> the

00:04:58.580 --> 00:04:58.590 
when it went it when it wasn't when the

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:00.620 
when it went it when it wasn't when the
winds<00:04:58.919> work<00:04:59.100> where<00:04:59.520> they<00:04:59.669> would<00:05:00.330> have<00:05:00.419> liked

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:00.630 
winds work where they would have liked

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:02.060 
winds work where they would have liked
where<00:05:00.930> we<00:05:01.050> would<00:05:01.169> have<00:05:01.290> liked<00:05:01.500> for<00:05:01.590> them<00:05:01.740> to<00:05:01.950> be

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:02.070 
where we would have liked for them to be

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:03.230 
where we would have liked for them to be
because<00:05:02.280> we<00:05:02.370> just<00:05:02.520> weren't<00:05:02.700> ready<00:05:02.850> to<00:05:03.090> do<00:05:03.210> that

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:03.240 
because we just weren't ready to do that

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.870 
because we just weren't ready to do that
yet<00:05:03.450> but<00:05:03.870> they<00:05:04.080> that<00:05:04.320> they<00:05:04.470> knew<00:05:04.680> that<00:05:04.880> it

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:05.880 
yet but they that they knew that it

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.460 
yet but they that they knew that it
could<00:05:06.090> happen<00:05:06.270> I<00:05:06.570> think<00:05:06.600> it<00:05:06.930> says<00:05:07.140> a<00:05:07.169> lot<00:05:07.290> about

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
could happen I think it says a lot about

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.320 
could happen I think it says a lot about
the<00:05:07.860> character<00:05:08.040> of<00:05:08.280> players<00:05:08.669> in<00:05:08.760> the<00:05:08.910> program

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
the character of players in the program

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:12.620 
the character of players in the program
I<00:05:09.510> think<00:05:09.960> the<00:05:10.140> people<00:05:10.590> here<00:05:11.300> really<00:05:12.300> enjoy

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
I think the people here really enjoy

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:15.020 
I think the people here really enjoy
supporting<00:05:13.229> them<00:05:13.380> those<00:05:14.160> are<00:05:14.340> the<00:05:14.400> emails<00:05:14.790> the

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
supporting them those are the emails the

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:17.480 
supporting them those are the emails the
letters<00:05:15.390> the<00:05:15.540> conversations<00:05:16.290> that<00:05:16.440> I<00:05:17.040> receive

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
letters the conversations that I receive

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.070 
letters the conversations that I receive
and<00:05:17.669> get<00:05:17.790> from<00:05:18.000> people<00:05:18.120> that<00:05:18.510> are<00:05:18.900> really

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.080 
and get from people that are really

00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.620 
and get from people that are really
strong<00:05:19.320> and<00:05:19.729> again<00:05:20.729> like<00:05:20.880> I<00:05:21.060> said<00:05:21.090> out<00:05:21.390> there<00:05:21.419> I

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
strong and again like I said out there I

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.330 
strong and again like I said out there I
think<00:05:21.780> there's<00:05:22.110> a<00:05:22.200> lot<00:05:22.380> of<00:05:22.410> different<00:05:22.590> there's

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:23.340 
think there's a lot of different there's

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:26.200 
think there's a lot of different there's
a<00:05:23.490> lot<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.750> every<00:05:24.750> program<00:05:25.290> in<00:05:25.440> sports<00:05:25.800> is

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
a lot of every program in sports is

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:29.330 
a lot of every program in sports is
preaching<00:05:27.210> some<00:05:27.600> sort<00:05:27.870> of<00:05:27.960> family<00:05:28.200> and<00:05:28.620> and

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:29.340 
preaching some sort of family and and

00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:32.390 
preaching some sort of family and and
that<00:05:30.090> that's<00:05:30.300> fine<00:05:30.510> but<00:05:31.500> it'd<00:05:31.800> be<00:05:32.130> hard<00:05:32.340> to

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
that that's fine but it'd be hard to

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.040 
that that's fine but it'd be hard to
look<00:05:32.610> at<00:05:32.790> what<00:05:32.970> has<00:05:33.180> happened<00:05:33.210> over<00:05:33.630> here<00:05:33.780> the

look at what has happened over here the

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:35.159 
look at what has happened over here the
last<00:05:34.169> few<00:05:34.350> years

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
last few years

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.439 
last few years
everybody<00:05:35.529> who<00:05:35.680> stayed<00:05:35.949> together<00:05:36.159> and<00:05:36.639> stuck
