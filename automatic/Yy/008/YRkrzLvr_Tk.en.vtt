00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
I get on how much yeah looks like and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.770 
I get on how much yeah looks like and
see<00:03:39.709> like<00:03:39.860> it<00:03:40.160> aligned<00:03:41.030> right<00:03:41.209> here<00:03:41.510> it<00:03:41.630> goes

00:03:41.770 --> 00:03:41.780 
see like it aligned right here it goes

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.860 
see like it aligned right here it goes
like<00:03:41.989> Boop<00:03:42.320> and<00:03:42.590> then<00:03:43.010> it<00:03:43.610> has<00:03:44.540> a<00:03:44.570> little

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
like Boop and then it has a little

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.750 
like Boop and then it has a little
indent<00:03:45.530> right<00:03:45.709> there<00:03:45.920> I<00:03:46.100> don't<00:03:46.220> know<00:03:46.310> if<00:03:46.459> it's

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:46.760 
indent right there I don't know if it's

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.039 
indent right there I don't know if it's
supposed<00:03:47.030> to<00:03:47.090> be<00:03:47.269> there<00:03:47.450> but<00:03:47.570> it<00:03:47.720> hasn't<00:03:47.989> on

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:48.049 
supposed to be there but it hasn't on

00:03:48.049 --> 00:03:50.500 
supposed to be there but it hasn't on
this<00:03:48.170> one<00:03:48.320> too<00:03:48.500> so<00:03:48.769> guessing<00:03:49.760> it<00:03:50.030> should<00:03:50.360> be

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:50.510 
this one too so guessing it should be

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.060 
this one too so guessing it should be
there<00:03:51.280> but<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:53.720> stitching<00:03:54.140> going<00:03:54.170> across<00:03:54.620> is

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
there but the stitching going across is

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:56.910 
there but the stitching going across is
nice
