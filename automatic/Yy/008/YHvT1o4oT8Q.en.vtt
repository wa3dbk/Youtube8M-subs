00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.420 
being used but so are the Sony ones so
when<00:02:22.050> comparing<00:02:22.410> the<00:02:22.590> Sony<00:02:22.830> ones<00:02:23.070> to<00:02:23.340> the

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
other brands I definitely think these

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.520

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
ones are the best

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:30.090 
you have a nice locking effect as they

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:32.000 
you have a nice locking effect as they
open<00:02:30.510> you<00:02:30.900> have<00:02:30.990> a<00:02:31.080> power<00:02:31.320> button<00:02:31.440> here<00:02:31.890> with

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
open you have a power button here with

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.660 
open you have a power button here with
an<00:02:32.100> LED<00:02:32.460> indicator<00:02:32.670> right<00:02:33.270> beside<00:02:33.660> it<00:02:33.860> on<00:02:34.860> the

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:35.670 
an LED indicator right beside it on the

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.830 
an LED indicator right beside it on the
front<00:02:35.970> Y<00:02:36.000> of<00:02:36.060> the<00:02:36.240> lenses<00:02:36.600> and<00:02:36.720> they're

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
front Y of the lenses and they're

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.360 
front Y of the lenses and they're
actually<00:02:37.200> glass<00:02:37.470> lenses<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.070> you<00:02:38.130> have<00:02:38.250> to

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
actually glass lenses so you have to

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.070 
actually glass lenses so you have to
watch<00:02:38.580> out<00:02:38.790> for<00:02:38.820> scratches<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.570> course<00:02:39.810> but

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
watch out for scratches of course but

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:41.840 
watch out for scratches of course but
not<00:02:40.380> nearly<00:02:40.740> as<00:02:40.950> much<00:02:41.100> as<00:02:41.160> you<00:02:41.310> would<00:02:41.550> if<00:02:41.700> they

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
not nearly as much as you would if they

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.700 
not nearly as much as you would if they
were<00:02:41.880> plastic<00:02:42.240> lenses<00:02:42.870> which<00:02:43.290> is<00:02:43.440> really

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
were plastic lenses which is really

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.140 
were plastic lenses which is really
awesome<00:02:43.860> but<00:02:44.190> when<00:02:44.340> you're<00:02:44.460> paying<00:02:44.730> as<00:02:44.970> much

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
awesome but when you're paying as much

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.100 
awesome but when you're paying as much
as<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.420> are<00:02:45.600> from<00:02:45.930> around<00:02:47.060> 150<00:02:48.060> it<00:02:48.270> seems<00:02:48.960> to

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
as you are from around 150 it seems to

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.900 
as you are from around 150 it seems to
be<00:02:49.200> the<00:02:49.350> average<00:02:49.530> price<00:02:49.860> range<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.850> of

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
that with these these glasses it also

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.530

article<00:03:20.850> okay<00:03:21.150> this<00:03:21.450> one's<00:03:21.630> talking<00:03:21.900> about

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:22.140 
article okay this one's talking about

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.650 
article okay this one's talking about
how<00:03:22.260> Apple<00:03:22.830> has<00:03:23.250> at<00:03:23.489> its<00:03:23.640> worst<00:03:23.940> half<00:03:24.330> in<00:03:24.600> the

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
how Apple has at its worst half in the

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.050 
how Apple has at its worst half in the
last<00:03:24.810> three<00:03:25.290> years<00:03:25.320> and<00:03:25.920> I'm<00:03:26.340> guessing<00:03:26.850> that's

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
last three years and I'm guessing that's

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.570 
last three years and I'm guessing that's
solely<00:03:27.660> because<00:03:27.900> of<00:03:28.110> the<00:03:28.200> iPhone<00:03:28.650> 5<00:03:29.010> 4s

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:29.580 
solely because of the iPhone 5 4s

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.210 
solely because of the iPhone 5 4s
whatever<00:03:29.940> you're<00:03:30.180> wanting<00:03:30.450> to<00:03:30.690> call<00:03:30.959> it<00:03:31.220> the

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
whatever you're wanting to call it the

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.550 
whatever you're wanting to call it the
delay<00:03:32.550> in<00:03:32.700> a<00:03:32.760> release<00:03:33.060> I<00:03:33.360> really<00:03:34.170> can't<00:03:34.380> see

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
delay in a release I really can't see

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.810 
delay in a release I really can't see
another<00:03:34.739> reason<00:03:34.920> for<00:03:35.100> this<00:03:35.310> it's<00:03:35.580> not<00:03:35.640> like

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
another reason for this it's not like

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.790 
another reason for this it's not like
Apple<00:03:36.239> hasn't<00:03:36.390> done<00:03:36.720> anything<00:03:37.020> they've<00:03:37.410> just

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
Apple hasn't done anything they've just

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:39.470 
Apple hasn't done anything they've just
released<00:03:37.980> their<00:03:38.310> new<00:03:38.459> their<00:03:39.150> new<00:03:39.270> operating

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
system for Mac they've refreshed some

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:45.740 
system for Mac they've refreshed some
some<00:03:42.750> of<00:03:42.840> their<00:03:42.930> computer<00:03:43.350> lines<00:03:43.620> but<00:03:44.750> really

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750 
some of their computer lines but really

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.110 
some of their computer lines but really
they<00:03:45.930> haven't<00:03:46.320> done<00:03:46.800> anything<00:03:47.120> spectacular

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
they haven't done anything spectacular

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.600 
they haven't done anything spectacular
and<00:03:48.239> anyone's<00:03:48.570> smart<00:03:49.050> investing<00:03:49.860> in<00:03:49.950> Apple<00:03:50.190> is

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:50.610 
and anyone's smart investing in Apple is

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:51.979 
and anyone's smart investing in Apple is
gonna<00:03:50.820> be<00:03:50.970> on<00:03:51.060> top<00:03:51.360> of<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.600> kind<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.870> stuff

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989 
gonna be on top of that kind of stuff

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:54.440 
gonna be on top of that kind of stuff
and<00:03:52.380> they're<00:03:52.709> gonna<00:03:52.800> know<00:03:53.130> that<00:03:53.940> no<00:03:54.300> one

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and they're gonna know that no one

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:55.910 
and they're gonna know that no one
really<00:03:54.690> wants<00:03:54.930> to<00:03:55.050> invest<00:03:55.290> it<00:03:55.410> in<00:03:55.500> company

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:55.920 
really wants to invest it in company

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:58.490 
really wants to invest it in company
that<00:03:56.190> has<00:03:56.580> had<00:03:56.820> problems<00:03:57.300> with<00:03:57.450> releasing<00:03:58.050> one

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
that has had problems with releasing one

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.290 
that has had problems with releasing one
of<00:03:58.650> their<00:03:58.770> biggest<00:03:58.950> moneymakers<00:03:59.640> the<00:03:59.850> iPhone

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:00.300 
of their biggest moneymakers the iPhone

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:02.510 
of their biggest moneymakers the iPhone
so<00:04:00.870> I<00:04:00.900> really<00:04:01.200> think<00:04:01.380> that's<00:04:01.470> the<00:04:01.620> reason<00:04:01.890> ends

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
so I really think that's the reason ends

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:04.030 
so I really think that's the reason ends

here<00:05:02.680> you're<00:05:03.680> slowly<00:05:04.400> building<00:05:05.030> that<00:05:05.180> up

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:05.260 
here you're slowly building that up

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:08.140 
here you're slowly building that up
throughout<00:05:06.260> the<00:05:06.410> game<00:05:06.440> and<00:05:06.860> once<00:05:07.729> it<00:05:07.850> reaches

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
throughout the game and once it reaches

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.240 
throughout the game and once it reaches
the<00:05:08.240> max<00:05:08.479> say<00:05:09.169> you<00:05:09.229> need<00:05:09.470> more<00:05:09.710> than<00:05:09.949> whatever

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:14.680 
the max is on this bar you click upgrade
it<00:05:12.560> so<00:05:12.680> then<00:05:12.830> this<00:05:13.340> bar<00:05:13.550> would<00:05:13.760> reset<00:05:14.270> and

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
it so then this bar would reset and

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.820 
it so then this bar would reset and
you'd<00:05:14.870> be<00:05:14.960> able<00:05:15.050> to<00:05:15.139> get<00:05:15.260> the<00:05:15.350> higher<00:05:15.530> ones

00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:13.430 
amazing that was a pointless attack and

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:14.980 
amazing that was a pointless attack and
see<00:06:13.610> these<00:06:13.760> just<00:06:14.120> regenerate<00:06:14.599> over<00:06:14.780> time

upgrading<00:06:15.680> these<00:06:15.800> pretty<00:06:16.039> much<00:06:16.130> make<00:06:16.400> them
