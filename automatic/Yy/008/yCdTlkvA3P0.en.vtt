00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009

thing<00:01:29.189> more<00:01:29.729> of<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:30.259> how<00:01:31.259> silly<00:01:31.680> it<00:01:31.829> is<00:01:31.920> to<00:01:32.189> have

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
thing more of a how silly it is to have

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.370 
thing more of a how silly it is to have
a<00:01:32.369> quarterback<00:01:32.880> friendly<00:01:33.390> offense<00:01:33.869> with<00:01:34.170> no

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
a quarterback friendly offense with no

a quarterback friendly offense with no
offensive<00:01:34.920> line<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.670> mean<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.509> how<00:01:37.290> was<00:01:37.500> that

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
offensive line I mean how how was that

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.380 
offensive line I mean how how was that
quarterback<00:01:38.130> friendly<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.670> that<00:01:39.119> seems

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
quarterback friendly that that seems

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.880 
quarterback friendly that that seems
like<00:01:39.540> it's<00:01:39.840> the<00:01:40.170> worst<00:01:40.320> thing<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.650> can<00:01:40.740> do<00:01:40.860> to

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
like it's the worst thing you can do to

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.069 
like it's the worst thing you can do to
a<00:01:41.009> quarterback<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.549> knowing<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> coming<00:01:42.960> in

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:17.030 
everything is going to be blamed on romo

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:19.270 
everything is going to be blamed on romo
that<00:03:17.780> if<00:03:17.900> Romo<00:03:18.169> was<00:03:18.409> here<00:03:18.650> things<00:03:18.859> would<00:03:19.099> be

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
that if Romo was here things would be

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.939

Romo<00:03:33.470> is<00:03:33.709> not<00:03:34.129> the<00:03:34.340> solution<00:03:35.620> so<00:03:36.620> there<00:03:36.859> there

00:03:37.179 --> 00:03:37.189 
Romo is not the solution so there there

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:40.179 
Romo is not the solution so there there
the<00:03:37.459> solution<00:03:37.790> is<00:03:38.150> much<00:03:38.659> bigger<00:03:39.199> than<00:03:39.590> Tony

00:03:40.179 --> 00:03:40.189 
the solution is much bigger than Tony

00:03:40.189 --> 00:03:43.390 
the solution is much bigger than Tony
Romo<00:03:40.989> so<00:03:41.989> I've<00:03:42.139> been<00:03:42.259> thinking<00:03:42.319> about<00:03:42.709> coaches

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
Romo so I've been thinking about coaches

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.999 
Romo so I've been thinking about coaches
I've<00:03:43.939> been<00:03:44.150> thinking<00:03:44.299> about<00:03:44.479> draft<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:46.009 
I've been thinking about draft and the

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:47.499 
I've been thinking about draft and the
only<00:03:46.220> two<00:03:46.489> coaches<00:03:46.939> that<00:03:47.060> came<00:03:47.239> to<00:03:47.359> my<00:03:47.479> mind

00:03:47.499 --> 00:03:47.509 
only two coaches that came to my mind

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:49.449 
only two coaches that came to my mind
and<00:03:48.019> put<00:03:48.199> you<00:03:48.319> and<00:03:48.439> put<00:03:48.650> your<00:03:48.799> coach<00:03:48.979> to<00:03:49.310> hold

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:49.459 
and put you and put your coach to hold

00:03:49.459 --> 00:03:51.460 
and put you and put your coach to hold
you<00:03:49.639> down<00:03:49.849> there<00:03:50.090> only<00:03:50.449> two<00:03:50.689> coaches<00:03:51.049> tended

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:51.470 
you down there only two coaches tended

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.729 
you down there only two coaches tended
my<00:03:51.530> mind<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.919> I<00:03:52.009> thought<00:03:52.250> would<00:03:52.579> be<00:03:52.639> you<00:03:53.389> know

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:53.739 
my mind that I thought would be you know

00:03:53.739 --> 00:03:56.949 
my mind that I thought would be you know
good<00:03:54.739> that<00:03:55.519> we<00:03:55.669> can<00:03:55.849> probably<00:03:56.090> take<00:03:56.479> this<00:03:56.689> team

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
good that we can probably take this team

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:59.520 
good that we can probably take this team
and<00:03:57.109> move<00:03:57.290> forward<00:03:57.680> quicker<00:03:58.219> you<00:03:58.909> know<00:03:59.090> and

00:03:59.520 --> 00:03:59.530 
and move forward quicker you know and
