very very the changeably okay
and<00:00:48.949> the<00:00:49.399> reason<00:00:49.699> I'm<00:00:49.820> between<00:00:50.030> this<00:00:50.300> thing

00:00:50.459 --> 00:00:50.469 
and the reason I'm between this thing

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:52.599 
and the reason I'm between this thing
the<00:00:51.469> squat<00:00:51.769> right<00:00:51.949> here<00:00:52.190> is<00:00:52.280> because<00:00:52.460> my

00:00:52.599 --> 00:00:52.609 
the squat right here is because my

00:00:52.609 --> 00:00:55.360 
the squat right here is because my
camera<00:00:53.329> is<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.170> bloody<00:00:54.440> highly<00:00:54.800> advanced<00:00:55.129> that

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
camera is so bloody highly advanced that

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.459 
camera is so bloody highly advanced that
I<00:00:55.429> have<00:00:55.640> no<00:00:55.999> clue<00:00:56.329> how<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.480> use<00:00:56.629> it<00:00:56.929> so<00:00:57.050> I<00:00:57.109> put<00:00:57.199> in

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
I have no clue how to use it so I put in

00:00:57.469 --> 00:00:59.739 
I have no clue how to use it so I put in
a<00:00:57.559> photo<00:00:57.800> focus<00:00:58.370> and<00:00:58.550> it's<00:00:59.149> focused<00:00:59.480> on<00:00:59.539> this

00:00:59.739 --> 00:00:59.749 
a photo focus and it's focused on this

00:00:59.749 --> 00:01:02.290 
a photo focus and it's focused on this
so<00:01:00.230> I<00:01:00.260> have<00:01:00.620> to<00:01:00.769> be<00:01:00.890> between<00:01:01.159> this<00:01:01.460> or<00:01:01.819> the

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:02.300 
so I have to be between this or the

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.320 
so I have to be between this or the
cameras<00:01:02.600> gonna<00:01:02.719> be<00:01:02.870> blurry<00:01:03.790> second<00:01:04.790> all<00:01:05.180> right

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
cameras gonna be blurry second all right

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.540 
cameras gonna be blurry second all right
now<00:01:05.600> going<00:01:05.780> back<00:01:06.020> to<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.380> stamina<00:01:07.070> Thema<00:01:07.370> Bob

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:07.550 
now going back to the stamina Thema Bob

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.930 
now going back to the stamina Thema Bob
um<00:01:08.200> their<00:01:09.200> standards<00:01:10.190> extremely<00:01:10.520> important

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:10.940 
um their standards extremely important

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:12.850 
um their standards extremely important
because<00:01:11.030> for<00:01:11.330> us<00:01:11.540> if<00:01:11.810> you<00:01:11.930> don't<00:01:12.050> have<00:01:12.320> stamina

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
because for us if you don't have stamina

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.380 
because for us if you don't have stamina
you<00:01:13.040> will<00:01:13.220> not<00:01:13.400> be<00:01:13.610> able<00:01:13.790> to<00:01:14.030> complete<00:01:14.360> your

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 
you will not be able to complete your

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.120 
you will not be able to complete your
training<00:01:16.060> when<00:01:17.060> we<00:01:17.090> train<00:01:17.570> we<00:01:18.170> take<00:01:18.560> extremely

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:19.130 
training when we train we take extremely

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.889 
training when we train we take extremely
short<00:01:19.340> rest<00:01:19.579> periods<00:01:20.030> when<00:01:20.180> I<00:01:20.210> say<00:01:20.420> we<00:01:20.659> I<00:01:20.689> mean

00:01:20.889 --> 00:01:20.899 
short rest periods when I say we I mean

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:23.590 
short rest periods when I say we I mean
back<00:01:21.619> in<00:01:21.649> the<00:01:21.799> day<00:01:21.860> when<00:01:22.159> I<00:01:22.189> was<00:01:22.369> in<00:01:22.520> Malaysia<00:01:22.759> I

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
back in the day when I was in Malaysia I

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:29.310 
back in the day when I was in Malaysia I
still<00:01:24.200> reckon<00:01:24.469> they<00:01:24.560> should<00:01:24.710> very<00:01:24.860> often

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.540 

and<00:01:31.110> my<00:01:32.110> rest<00:01:32.380> period<00:01:32.770> was<00:01:32.950> anywhere<00:01:33.490> between

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:33.550 
and my rest period was anywhere between

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.080 
and my rest period was anywhere between
35<00:01:34.180> to<00:01:34.210> 50<00:01:34.750> 50<00:01:35.260> seconds<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:36.100> coaches<00:01:36.580> did<00:01:36.790> not

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
35 to 50 50 seconds the coaches did not

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.020 
35 to 50 50 seconds the coaches did not
like<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:37.720> when<00:01:37.990> we<00:01:38.200> took<00:01:38.470> long<00:01:39.280> break<00:01:39.640> we<00:01:39.850> want

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.030 
like it when we took long break we want

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:41.850 
like it when we took long break we want
to<00:01:40.150> get<00:01:40.300> that<00:01:40.420> flow<00:01:40.750> and<00:01:40.990> once<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.440> flow<00:01:41.710> is

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
to get that flow and once that flow is

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.410 
to get that flow and once that flow is
in<00:01:42.040> we<00:01:42.160> want<00:01:42.369> to<00:01:42.430> keep<00:01:42.580> going<00:01:42.820> going<00:01:42.970> going

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
in we want to keep going going going

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.240 
in we want to keep going going going
going<00:01:43.720> we<00:01:43.930> don't<00:01:44.050> want<00:01:44.229> to<00:01:44.290> rest<00:01:44.500> too<00:01:44.680> long<00:01:44.890> and

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:45.250 
going we don't want to rest too long and

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.400 
going we don't want to rest too long and
that's<00:01:45.640> the<00:01:45.820> reason<00:01:46.150> for<00:01:46.180> the<00:01:46.360> 35<00:01:46.990> to<00:01:47.170> 50

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:47.410 
that's the reason for the 35 to 50

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.530 
that's the reason for the 35 to 50
second<00:01:47.710> break<00:01:47.890> periods<00:01:48.280> plus<00:01:48.910> our<00:01:49.119> coaches

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:52.720 
gonna move around with me I take forever

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.870

phase say you be training for about 10
months<00:02:02.289> you've<00:02:02.560> been<00:02:02.590> accumulating<00:02:03.490> load<00:02:04.149> and

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
months you've been accumulating load and

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:05.969 
months you've been accumulating load and
stress<00:02:04.690> for<00:02:04.899> about<00:02:05.050> 10<00:02:05.289> months<00:02:05.470> and<00:02:05.830> you've

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:05.979 
stress for about 10 months and you've

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:08.910 
stress for about 10 months and you've
got<00:02:06.009> the<00:02:06.280> 11th<00:02:06.729> plan<00:02:06.880> to<00:02:07.000> compete<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.739> if<00:02:08.739> by

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:08.920 
got the 11th plan to compete it if by

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.320 
got the 11th plan to compete it if by
all<00:02:08.950> means<00:02:09.310> take<00:02:09.429> a<00:02:09.489> longer<00:02:09.759> break<00:02:09.789> periods<00:02:10.209> of

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
all means take a longer break periods of

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.910 
all means take a longer break periods of
what<00:02:10.450> movies<00:02:10.720> you<00:02:10.750> complete<00:02:11.170> all<00:02:11.320> that<00:02:11.530> before

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
what movies you complete all that before

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.949 
what movies you complete all that before
them<00:02:12.220> for<00:02:12.580> the<00:02:12.640> first<00:02:12.850> 10<00:02:13.000> months<00:02:13.180> you<00:02:13.420> are<00:02:13.660> not

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
them for the first 10 months you are not

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.770 
them for the first 10 months you are not
allowed<00:02:14.320> take<00:02:14.620> long<00:02:14.830> rest<00:02:15.489> periods<00:02:15.970> that's

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
allowed take long rest periods that's

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.080 
allowed take long rest periods that's
actually<00:02:17.530> one<00:02:17.800> of<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:18.040> ways<00:02:18.220> that<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.700> train

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
actually one of the ways that we train

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.800 
actually one of the ways that we train
to<00:02:19.239> stamina

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:19.810 
to stamina

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.280 
to stamina
where<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.050> don't<00:02:20.260> allow<00:02:20.620> long<00:02:21.160> rest<00:02:21.459> periods

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
where we don't allow long rest periods

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.040 
where we don't allow long rest periods
ok<00:02:23.290> so<00:02:23.800> if<00:02:24.670> you<00:02:24.730> take<00:02:25.060> long<00:02:25.300> as<00:02:25.510> periods

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.050 
ok so if you take long as periods

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.009 
ok so if you take long as periods
chances<00:02:26.680> are<00:02:27.060> either<00:02:28.060> you're<00:02:28.300> lazy<00:02:28.480> your

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
chances are either you're lazy your

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:30.570 
chances are either you're lazy your
decondition<00:02:29.680> you're<00:02:30.130> not<00:02:30.280> comfortable

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:30.580 
decondition you're not comfortable

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:32.460 
decondition you're not comfortable
training<00:02:31.000> like<00:02:31.120> that<00:02:31.239> you're<00:02:31.720> competing<00:02:32.140> if

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:32.470 
training like that you're competing if

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:33.690 
training like that you're competing if
you're<00:02:32.590> not<00:02:32.800> going<00:02:32.920> to<00:02:33.010> be<00:02:33.070> competing<00:02:33.310> soon

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:33.700 
you're not going to be competing soon

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:34.979 
you're not going to be competing soon
then<00:02:33.910> chances<00:02:34.330> are<00:02:34.420> you<00:02:34.540> shouldn't<00:02:34.750> be<00:02:34.900> going

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:34.989 
then chances are you shouldn't be going

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:36.449 
then chances are you shouldn't be going
so<00:02:35.200> heavy<00:02:35.380> right<00:02:35.680> because<00:02:35.950> you're<00:02:36.100> building

00:02:36.449 --> 00:02:36.459 
so heavy right because you're building

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:38.039 
so heavy right because you're building
on<00:02:36.549> technique<00:02:37.090> you're<00:02:37.630> building<00:02:37.959> the

okay it's gonna be snatch day for

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.480 
okay it's gonna be snatch day for
example<00:02:59.910> okay<00:03:00.350> all<00:03:01.350> right<00:03:01.560> you're<00:03:02.160> going<00:03:02.400> to

I started going down there like

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.220 
I started going down there like
procrastinating<00:03:36.120> it's<00:03:36.690> not<00:03:36.810> going<00:03:37.020> around

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
procrastinating it's not going around

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.080 
procrastinating it's not going around
review<00:03:37.740> my<00:03:37.860> back<00:03:38.010> and<00:03:38.160> stupid<00:03:38.640> hoping<00:03:38.970> my

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:39.090

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:40.800 
coach won't see me yes that would be

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.390 
coach won't see me yes that would be
another<00:03:41.730> sign<00:03:42.060> that<00:03:42.090> I'm<00:03:42.330> a<00:03:42.360> lazy<00:03:42.660> bitch<00:03:42.990> or<00:03:43.320> I

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
another sign that I'm a lazy bitch or I

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:46.010 
another sign that I'm a lazy bitch or I
have<00:03:44.400> no<00:03:44.610> conditioning<00:03:45.060> at<00:03:45.150> all<00:03:45.240> okay<00:03:45.660> so<00:03:45.780> that

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:46.020 
have no conditioning at all okay so that

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.900 
have no conditioning at all okay so that
one<00:03:46.200> is<00:03:46.530> kind<00:03:46.680> of<00:03:46.770> like<00:03:46.830> a<00:03:46.950> little<00:03:47.190> bit<00:03:47.310> of<00:03:47.460> lazy

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
one is kind of like a little bit of lazy

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.320 
one is kind of like a little bit of lazy
a<00:03:48.270> little<00:03:48.630> bit<00:03:48.720> of<00:03:48.930> like<00:03:49.440> a<00:03:49.470> push<00:03:49.880> but<00:03:50.880> can<00:03:51.150> also

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
a little bit of like a push but can also

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.120 
a little bit of like a push but can also
be<00:03:51.600> a<00:03:51.990> lack<00:03:52.200> of<00:03:52.230> stamina<00:03:52.530> so<00:03:52.860> that's<00:03:53.040> the

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:53.130 
be a lack of stamina so that's the

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.880 
be a lack of stamina so that's the
second<00:03:53.460> thing<00:03:53.490> okay<00:03:54.470> another<00:03:55.470> way<00:03:55.650> you<00:03:55.680> can

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:55.890 
second thing okay another way you can

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.040 
second thing okay another way you can
solve<00:03:56.130> this<00:03:56.310> problem<00:03:56.400> is<00:03:56.940> not<00:03:57.360> to<00:03:57.660> let<00:03:57.870> them

00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:58.050 
solve this problem is not to let them

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:00.320 
solve this problem is not to let them
have<00:03:58.290> the<00:03:58.500> fun<00:03:59.070> exercise<00:03:59.670> does<00:03:59.940> finally

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:00.330 
have the fun exercise does finally

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:02.420 
have the fun exercise does finally
exercise<00:04:01.080> that<00:04:01.290> they<00:04:01.470> love<00:04:01.830> doing<00:04:02.100> for

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
exercise that they love doing for

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.180 
exercise that they love doing for
example<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.210> this<00:04:03.330> match<00:04:03.570> I<00:04:04.010> hate<00:04:05.010> doing

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:05.190 
example I like this match I hate doing

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.820 
example I like this match I hate doing
pools<00:04:05.900> but<00:04:06.900> I<00:04:06.930> do<00:04:07.050> first<00:04:07.290> I<00:04:07.380> do<00:04:07.440> Bulls<00:04:07.680> first

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:07.830 
pools but I do first I do Bulls first

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:09.650 
pools but I do first I do Bulls first
okay<00:04:08.280> I<00:04:08.310> finish<00:04:08.790> off<00:04:08.880> my<00:04:09.000> pools<00:04:09.240> first<00:04:09.510> and

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:09.660 
okay I finish off my pools first and

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:11.450 
okay I finish off my pools first and
then<00:04:09.750> I<00:04:09.810> get<00:04:09.960> to<00:04:10.080> play<00:04:10.290> now<00:04:10.680> the<00:04:10.740> third<00:04:11.190> way<00:04:11.430> you

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:11.460 
then I get to play now the third way you

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.910 
then I get to play now the third way you
can<00:04:11.730> tell<00:04:11.970> is<00:04:12.210> if<00:04:12.630> the<00:04:12.840> person<00:04:13.230> comes<00:04:13.410> in<00:04:13.710> and

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:13.920 
can tell is if the person comes in and

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.349 
can tell is if the person comes in and
he<00:04:14.400> is<00:04:14.430> really<00:04:14.970> not<00:04:15.840> that<00:04:16.350> motivated<00:04:17.359> okay

00:04:18.349 --> 00:04:18.359 
he is really not that motivated okay

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:20.960 
he is really not that motivated okay
this<00:04:18.989> can<00:04:19.200> also<00:04:19.380> be<00:04:19.530> another<00:04:20.190> sign<00:04:20.609> of<00:04:20.640> the

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
this can also be another sign of the

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:22.550 
this can also be another sign of the
person<00:04:21.410> overtraining

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:22.560 
person overtraining

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.830 
person overtraining
or<00:04:22.980> just<00:04:23.370> going<00:04:23.640> way<00:04:23.910> too<00:04:23.970> heavy<00:04:24.600> that<00:04:24.630> he

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:24.840 
or just going way too heavy that he

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.230 
or just going way too heavy that he
doesn't<00:04:25.350> quite<00:04:25.620> or<00:04:25.830> she<00:04:26.070> doesn't<00:04:26.250> quite<00:04:26.490> have

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
doesn't quite or she doesn't quite have

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.330 
doesn't quite or she doesn't quite have
the<00:04:27.270> technique<00:04:28.140> in<00:04:28.350> the<00:04:28.500> person's<00:04:28.860> head<00:04:29.070> yet

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:29.340 
the technique in the person's head yet

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:32.300 
the technique in the person's head yet
so<00:04:29.730> this<00:04:29.880> individual<00:04:30.600> is<00:04:30.810> nervous<00:04:31.500> he<00:04:31.800> goes<00:04:32.040> in

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
so this individual is nervous he goes in

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.520 
so this individual is nervous he goes in
she<00:04:32.340> goes<00:04:32.670> in<00:04:32.970> and<00:04:33.120> they're<00:04:33.240> like<00:04:33.330> quite<00:04:34.260> sure

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:34.530 
she goes in and they're like quite sure

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:36.260 
she goes in and they're like quite sure
kind<00:04:35.100> of<00:04:35.190> I<00:04:35.370> want<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.640> have<00:04:35.820> a<00:04:35.850> good<00:04:36.030> training

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270 
kind of I want to have a good training

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:38.480 
kind of I want to have a good training
session<00:04:36.750> but<00:04:37.440> I've<00:04:37.590> been<00:04:37.740> having<00:04:37.830> so<00:04:38.100> many<00:04:38.160> bad

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
session but I've been having so many bad

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:40.850 
session but I've been having so many bad
training<00:04:38.790> sessions<00:04:39.270> so<00:04:39.840> that's<00:04:40.350> another<00:04:40.590> way

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:40.860 
training sessions so that's another way

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:42.410 
training sessions so that's another way
to<00:04:40.890> tell<00:04:41.250> that<00:04:41.400> the<00:04:41.520> person<00:04:41.850> doesn't<00:04:42.090> have<00:04:42.270> the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
to tell that the person doesn't have the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.410 
to tell that the person doesn't have the
conditioning<00:04:43.140> or<00:04:43.320> stamina<00:04:44.030> to<00:04:45.030> complete<00:04:45.390> a

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:45.420 
conditioning or stamina to complete a

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:49.280 
conditioning or stamina to complete a
workout<00:04:45.780> problem<00:04:46.550> okay<00:04:47.550> so<00:04:47.900> how<00:04:48.900> do<00:04:48.960> you<00:04:49.080> solve

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
workout problem okay so how do you solve

00:04:49.290 --> 00:05:00.070 
workout problem okay so how do you solve
that<00:04:49.500> problem<00:04:51.200> compact<00:04:52.200> lightweight

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:03.399 

a<00:05:00.759> lot<00:05:01.759> of<00:05:01.789> people<00:05:02.030> train<00:05:02.300> way<00:05:02.449> too<00:05:02.509> heavy<00:05:02.810> they

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:03.409 
a lot of people train way too heavy they

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:04.719 
a lot of people train way too heavy they
don't<00:05:03.590> have<00:05:03.710> the<00:05:03.800> right<00:05:03.949> technique<00:05:04.220> for<00:05:04.550> that

00:05:04.719 --> 00:05:04.729 
don't have the right technique for that

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:06.999 
don't have the right technique for that
so<00:05:04.909> upload<00:05:05.259> mmm<00:05:06.259> how<00:05:06.470> do<00:05:06.530> you<00:05:06.620> tell<00:05:06.830> if<00:05:06.860> you

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 
so upload mmm how do you tell if you

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:08.110 
so upload mmm how do you tell if you
don't<00:05:07.220> have<00:05:07.340> a<00:05:07.370> good<00:05:07.550> take<00:05:07.729> the<00:05:07.909> best

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:08.120 
don't have a good take the best

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:11.649 
don't have a good take the best
technique<00:05:08.419> I<00:05:09.939> don't<00:05:10.939> wanna<00:05:11.060> go<00:05:11.150> into<00:05:11.360> that<00:05:11.479> in

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:11.659 
technique I don't wanna go into that in

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:14.260 
technique I don't wanna go into that in
this<00:05:11.780> video<00:05:11.960> but<00:05:12.740> I<00:05:12.919> will<00:05:13.039> post<00:05:13.280> it<00:05:13.460> in<00:05:13.729> a<00:05:14.090> few

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
this video but I will post it in a few

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:17.320 
this video but I will post it in a few
more<00:05:14.360> days<00:05:14.469> anyway<00:05:15.500> are<00:05:15.710> three<00:05:16.639> things<00:05:17.000> about

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
more days anyway are three things about

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.119 
more days anyway are three things about
how<00:05:18.169> you<00:05:18.229> can<00:05:18.409> tell<00:05:18.590> if<00:05:18.710> somebody<00:05:18.979> doesn't

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:19.129 
how you can tell if somebody doesn't

00:05:19.129 --> 00:05:20.649 
how you can tell if somebody doesn't
have<00:05:19.219> enough<00:05:19.430> stamina<00:05:19.669> and<00:05:19.969> three<00:05:20.120> solutions

00:05:20.649 --> 00:05:20.659 
have enough stamina and three solutions

00:05:20.659 --> 00:05:23.320 
have enough stamina and three solutions
I<00:05:20.810> hope<00:05:21.080> some<00:05:21.409> people<00:05:21.909> finally<00:05:22.909> find

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:23.330 
I hope some people finally find

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.990 
I hope some people finally find
themselves<00:05:23.780> in<00:05:23.960> that<00:05:23.990> and<00:05:24.349> if<00:05:24.800> you<00:05:24.949> I<00:05:25.310> hope

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:26.000 
themselves in that and if you I hope

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:27.850 
themselves in that and if you I hope
nobody<00:05:26.449> finds<00:05:26.750> themselves<00:05:27.110> in<00:05:27.229> that<00:05:27.439> and<00:05:27.680> if

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:27.860 
nobody finds themselves in that and if

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:29.950 
nobody finds themselves in that and if
you<00:05:27.949> do<00:05:28.159> I<00:05:28.370> hope<00:05:28.580> you<00:05:28.699> find<00:05:29.000> a<00:05:29.210> solution<00:05:29.449> I<00:05:29.840> can

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:29.960 
you do I hope you find a solution I can

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:31.929 
you do I hope you find a solution I can
think<00:05:30.139> of<00:05:30.289> a<00:05:30.349> solution<00:05:30.530> with<00:05:31.310> this<00:05:31.550> little<00:05:31.819> tip

00:05:31.929 --> 00:05:31.939 
think of a solution with this little tip

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.490 
think of a solution with this little tip
that<00:05:31.969> I<00:05:32.090> have<00:05:32.180> to<00:05:32.389> share<00:05:32.599> with<00:05:32.719> you<00:05:32.840> all<00:05:33.139> right
