00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:03.860
 hello with you vitalik spring offside 

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:06.269
 flash master and in this lesson we are with you 

00:00:06.269 --> 00:00:07.270
 will create 

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.280
 on some 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.190
 I wonder what effect with 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:12.330
 of our rotating element that is we 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.479
 use it another option 

00:00:14.479 --> 00:00:16.460
 for this let's unlock 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:19.460
 Our layer with my Olga type is ready to give 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.329
 warmly sites your master 

00:00:21.329 --> 00:00:23.960
 and placed the package in the center 

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.710
 so the return process will be serious 

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.539
 inscriptions just as we can 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:31.539
 center a little 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.000
 that is, we need a deputy 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.510
 such a limit 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.700
 and let's move it 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.700
 to the area left of our scene 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:44.479
 stroke type 

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:46.769
 that is, the water is the heat of the site we need 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.510
 extend to 70 th frame mapping 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:51.540
 we'll live a hot key in 5 of them 

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:52.560
 program automatically 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.220
 builds intermediate frames 

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:56.560
 for this 

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.270
 for the extension of the staff you need hot 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.520
 keys 5 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 so we extended 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.060
 somewhere in the tenth frame we are waiting for buckets set 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.530
 keyframes are already keyframes 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.600
 somewhere in the forty-fifth frames for example 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.460
 German thefts 6 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.250
 and we are waiting for this picket from 6, that is, there 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.640
 somewhere in 10 frames at the beginning and end 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.600
 and passing the logos on will take 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.740
 but about thirty-five frames 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.810
 and now 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.149
 but let's select these fragments here 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.720
 animation mercenaries of time that is it 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.150
 not yet animation we will create an animation 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:38.190
 right mouse button 3 km on the selected 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:40.220
 and choose to create a classic dumbness 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.000
 movements and as you can see with us right away 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.160
 timeline 

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:45.490
 is displayed 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.610
 the animation will go away arrows show then 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:50.750
 what's the animation percentage 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.410
 Well, as if given is included 

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.259
 throughout these games frames 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.249
 animation is on now we need it 

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.280
 to set 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.729
 percent of the given key frame in the second 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.750
 keyframe we have 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:05.170
 our rotating element means where 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:07.620
 then she started our logo 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.839
 and last 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:12.449
 in the penultimate and forty frame 

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:15.449
 my fifth place finally 

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:18.799
 baloga type i.e. mid rotating 

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:21.239
 element have people drown finally 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:22.409
 the logo 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.029
 vodka and ok 

00:02:24.029 --> 00:02:25.619
 and now 

00:02:25.619 --> 00:02:26.689
 the first 

00:02:26.689 --> 00:02:29.829
 and on the keyframe we can hold 

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.349
 our forgiving village ment dod minimum 

00:02:32.349 --> 00:02:33.979
 sizes then here we will start 

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:35.339
 manifestations 

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:37.309
 and in the last keyframes 

00:02:37.309 --> 00:02:38.889
 prologue of beer accurate 

00:02:38.889 --> 00:02:41.269
 he also needs to be moved to the end 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:43.379
 right right side 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.750
 but our scene and press down to the minimum 

00:02:46.749 --> 00:02:47.719
 sizes 

00:02:47.719 --> 00:02:50.469
 that is, we sort of disappear here 

00:02:50.469 --> 00:02:52.399
 but now let's see what you get 

00:02:52.399 --> 00:02:54.739
 we appear goodbye element 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.819
 passes by and believe the floor and disappear yes 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:00.069
 here is such 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:02.450
 on an interesting option but that's not all 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.580
 the exit don't see of course the most 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.169
 the effect is clear 

00:03:07.169 --> 00:03:08.939
 in order to create an effect for us 

00:03:08.939 --> 00:03:11.119
 need to get up on the first layer with our 

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:14.589
 believes the type and creator of the new 

00:03:14.589 --> 00:03:15.949
 in this 

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:19.149
 but conditions we are the tenth frame that is one 

00:03:19.149 --> 00:03:20.999
 moment of manifestation of our logo 

00:03:20.999 --> 00:03:21.899
 get up 

00:03:21.899 --> 00:03:24.170
 in the tenth frame and create 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:26.179
 keyframe like 6 

00:03:26.179 --> 00:03:28.669
 percentage here and so 

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.019
 the sticker is still something we all feel 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:32.949
 key frames choose a brush 

00:03:32.949 --> 00:03:34.499
 Kiev customize 

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:36.809
 Anna is the maximum will be more convenient 

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:38.629
 maximum size 

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.260
 excellent and basically draw here you see 

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.950
 we are full of hemispheres 

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:45.260
 our doctors all the elements have a treatment 

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.769
 i.e 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:49.009
 we shouldn't touch 

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:50.319
 glow 

00:03:50.319 --> 00:03:51.849
 We need 

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:54.369
 how to draw 

00:03:54.369 --> 00:03:56.619
 which one 

00:03:56.619 --> 00:03:59.179
 such a mask we create a mask 

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:00.260
 that is, so here 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:01.419
 where it will be 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.079
 percentage our item looks like a group 

00:04:04.079 --> 00:04:06.379
 then so to group it to us 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.429
 need to press fist on brik 

00:04:08.429 --> 00:04:10.459
 hotkeys plankton by 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.119
 percent 6 and we switch to 

00:04:13.119 --> 00:04:15.959
 next frame and right there automatically 

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:17.789
 creates the next new 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:19.039
 keyframe 

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:21.870
 let's added found 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:23.080
 our mask 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:24.729
 or graphic elements 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.610
 masks we add one more stroke 

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.449
 as you can see, we have succeeded 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.090
 graphic element form group crush 

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:33.949
 I'll control him by 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:36.430
 this buckets immediately create the next 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:39.520
 keyframe as you can see animation 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:40.720
 m 

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.090
 of our appeal item going on 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.830
 the flow of these frames 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:47.749
 and we constantly skirmishes keyframes 

00:04:47.749 --> 00:04:49.490
 here we rebuild 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.080
 again without affecting 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.000
 what a glow especially 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.020
 fund rubles 

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.569
 divorce defeat first 

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.840
 this item 

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:59.790
 5 6 get up to key frames 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.300
 we are lagging behind at the meeting also 

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:03.520
 a key channel is created 

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:05.340
 in this way a mask is created 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:07.470
 to sketch its growth for the songs 

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.250
 for a few minutes and continue 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.110
 you can continue on your own 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.169
 series with me 

00:05:13.169 --> 00:05:16.169
 self-mask 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.689
 so we finished our mask 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:20.749
 but now 

00:05:20.749 --> 00:05:23.610
 let's see what we do 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:26.030
 as you can see in our passage 

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.770
 rotating element 

00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:30.020
 our marine appearance occurs 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:32.089
 building up our masks 

00:05:32.089 --> 00:05:33.799
 in order to do this and 

00:05:33.799 --> 00:05:35.599
 really mask we need 

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:37.180
 to click 

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:40.610
 by experience my layer of grease and choose 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:42.680
 right click 3km in this dispute 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.120
 choose a mask 

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.000
 now it is really a mask 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.309
 because 

00:05:47.309 --> 00:05:49.139
 as you can see with us 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.469
 such a manifestation occurs 

00:05:52.469 --> 00:05:54.889
 in the previous frames we have displayed as 

00:05:54.889 --> 00:05:56.020
 would 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.030
 animation or as it were displayed on 

00:05:58.030 --> 00:06:00.169
 twine therefore itself happens 

00:06:00.169 --> 00:06:01.740
 manifestation we do not see 

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.589
 let's move this one 

00:06:03.589 --> 00:06:05.999
 the first frames we move to the tenth 

00:06:05.999 --> 00:06:07.969
 frames and here from this when we have a principle 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:08.789
 will start 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:10.759
 manifestations will begin 

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:13.099
 let's see what we did 

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.270
 control center 

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:15.210
 And we 

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:17.660
 we see our doctors appear 

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:20.689
 the segment is showing our locomotive and it is going 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:22.619
 the only fault is the only one 

00:06:22.619 --> 00:06:25.069
 the disadvantage is that the element itself rotates 

00:06:25.069 --> 00:06:26.430
 passes by 

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:27.379
 on top of 

00:06:27.379 --> 00:06:28.569
 on the show 

00:06:28.569 --> 00:06:32.119
 believe the type of how to fix it now 

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:33.559
 will show 

00:06:33.559 --> 00:06:35.129
 for this we take 

00:06:35.129 --> 00:06:37.089
 to the word with water 

00:06:37.089 --> 00:06:39.249
 with a rotating element or 

00:06:39.249 --> 00:06:40.869
 place it under 

00:06:40.869 --> 00:06:42.130
 on conditions 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:45.060
 she is intercourse mask of our logo 

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.970
 as you can see 

00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:47.710
 percentage dash can move 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:50.010
 Left can delegates rights that is she 

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:53.170
 shows where we put and our layer is 

00:06:53.170 --> 00:06:55.110
 there is no point in putting a mask on my 

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:56.970
 so we move it to the left 

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:58.870
 and set yourself if 

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:01.380
 we place more to the right then he will sue us 

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:02.530
 to Moscow 

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.729
 that is, it will be 

00:07:03.729 --> 00:07:05.680
 respectively, such a group Murmansk 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.279
 even group 

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:08.829
 now let's see what we have 

00:07:08.829 --> 00:07:11.369
 it turned out kontrol center 

00:07:11.369 --> 00:07:13.629
 and this is what I wanted to show you 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:15.489
 that such an effect of manifestation is done 

00:07:15.489 --> 00:07:17.360
 it's much faster 

00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:19.270
 i.e. all this animation 

00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:21.669
 moves faster that is to say from the eyes 

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:23.699
 did not have time to catch what really happened 

00:07:23.699 --> 00:07:26.360
 that is, they attack the rotating element 

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.479
 should 

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:30.479
 how to manifest 

00:07:32.169 --> 00:07:33.120
 the logo 

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.610
 in this way 

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:38.360
 Well apply this effect where you will 

00:07:38.360 --> 00:07:40.180
 that is, you can apply it
