00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
you've probably got all kinds of windows

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.890 
you've probably got all kinds of windows
or<00:00:26.130> applications<00:00:26.670> open<00:00:26.849> at<00:00:27.060> any<00:00:27.180> given<00:00:27.570> time

or applications open at any given time

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.589 
or applications open at any given time
for<00:00:28.500> example<00:00:28.890> here<00:00:29.220> I've<00:00:29.340> got<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.179> browser

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
for example here I've got a browser

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.200 
for example here I've got a browser
window<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.439> then<00:00:32.160> underneath<00:00:32.430> I've<00:00:32.730> also<00:00:32.880> got

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
window and then underneath I've also got

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.600 
window and then underneath I've also got
a<00:00:33.360> Pages<00:00:33.840> document<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:35.250> I<00:00:35.280> almost

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
a Pages document and then I almost

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.209 
a Pages document and then I almost
always<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.510> Photoshop<00:00:37.050> open<00:00:37.230> so<00:00:37.950> you've<00:00:38.070> got

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
always have Photoshop open so you've got

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.350 
always have Photoshop open so you've got
all<00:00:38.309> these<00:00:38.430> different<00:00:38.489> things<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.210> there's

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
all these different things and there's

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.549 
all these different things and there's
only<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.540> couple<00:00:39.600> different<00:00:40.140> ways<00:00:40.170> to<00:00:40.290> get

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
only a couple different ways to get

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:42.590 
only a couple different ways to get
around<00:00:40.649> in<00:00:41.010> this<00:00:41.160> case<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.610> would<00:00:42.059> have<00:00:42.180> to<00:00:42.300> drag

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600 
around in this case I would have to drag

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.150 
around in this case I would have to drag
it<00:00:42.780> out<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.899> the<00:00:43.079> way<00:00:43.260> and<00:00:43.680> then<00:00:43.829> click<00:00:44.040> on

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
it out of the way and then click on

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.040 
it out of the way and then click on
another<00:00:44.370> window<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.360> bring<00:00:45.539> it<00:00:45.660> to<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.870> front

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
another window to bring it to the front

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.110 
another window to bring it to the front
or<00:00:46.440> if<00:00:47.039> you're<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> little<00:00:47.250> more<00:00:47.430> sophisticated

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
or if you're a little more sophisticated

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.850 
or if you're a little more sophisticated
you<00:00:48.329> might<00:00:48.510> be<00:00:48.629> using<00:00:48.809> the<00:00:49.110> keyboard<00:00:49.620> shortcut

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
you might be using the keyboard shortcut

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.790 
you might be using the keyboard shortcut
of<00:00:50.340> command<00:00:50.910> tab<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:52.050> get<00:00:52.170> to<00:00:52.379> something<00:00:52.620> to

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
of command tab to get to something to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.220 
of command tab to get to something to
bring<00:00:53.010> it<00:00:53.039> forward<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.610> that's<00:00:54.120> okay<00:00:54.539> but<00:00:55.170> I

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
bring it forward and that's okay but I

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.740 
bring it forward and that's okay but I
think<00:00:55.770> that<00:00:56.129> multiple<00:00:56.670> desktops<00:00:57.210> is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> much

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
think that multiple desktops is a much

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.779 
think that multiple desktops is a much
more<00:00:57.930> elegant<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.739> efficient<00:00:59.219> solution

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
more elegant and efficient solution

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.029 
more elegant and efficient solution
there<00:01:00.570> are<00:01:00.600> two<00:01:00.899> ways<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.109> get<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.620> it<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.890> can

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
there are two ways to get to it you can

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:05.509 
there are two ways to get to it you can
either<00:01:02.280> use<00:01:02.730> the<00:01:03.329> f3<00:01:04.170> button<00:01:04.559> on<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
either use the f3 button on your

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.640 
either use the f3 button on your
keyboard<00:01:05.729> to<00:01:06.570> bring<00:01:06.600> up<00:01:06.930> what's<00:01:07.560> called

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
keyboard to bring up what's called

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.640 
keyboard to bring up what's called
Mission<00:01:08.250> Control<00:01:08.580> or<00:01:08.909> you<00:01:09.720> can<00:01:09.869> use<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> gesture

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
Mission Control or you can use a gesture

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.010 
Mission Control or you can use a gesture
on<00:01:10.799> your<00:01:10.860> trackpad<00:01:11.549> which<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.510> either<00:01:12.630> four

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
on your trackpad which is either four

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.140 
on your trackpad which is either four
fingers<00:01:13.470> up<00:01:13.710> or<00:01:13.950> three<00:01:14.250> fingers<00:01:14.580> up<00:01:14.729> depending

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
fingers up or three fingers up depending

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.060 
fingers up or three fingers up depending
on<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.479> you<00:01:15.630> have<00:01:15.810> set<00:01:16.110> in<00:01:16.259> your<00:01:16.830> preferences

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
on what you have set in your preferences

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.820 
on what you have set in your preferences
in<00:01:17.580> my<00:01:18.450> case<00:01:18.659> it's<00:01:18.869> four<00:01:19.110> fingers<00:01:19.439> up<00:01:19.590> so<00:01:19.710> I'm

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
in my case it's four fingers up so I'm

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.440 
in my case it's four fingers up so I'm
going<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:20.040> do<00:01:20.100> a<00:01:20.130> four<00:01:20.430> finger<00:01:20.700> swipe<00:01:20.729> up<00:01:21.000> and

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
going to do a four finger swipe up and

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.120 
going to do a four finger swipe up and
it's<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.320> to<00:01:22.380> show<00:01:22.560> me<00:01:22.740> what's<00:01:22.890> called

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
it's going to show me what's called

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.910 
it's going to show me what's called
Mission<00:01:23.610> Control<00:01:24.000> and<00:01:24.390> then<00:01:25.320> here<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> shows

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920 
Mission Control and then here it shows

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.980 
Mission Control and then here it shows
the<00:01:25.979> three<00:01:26.460> applications<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:27.570> windows<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:27.930> I
