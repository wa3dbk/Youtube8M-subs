00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 today I will talk about my routine 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.779
 face care for those who do not know 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:10.440
 I have problem with the how 

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:12.540
 July 2012 and that's when I counted on 

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.880
 Short fringe that way will start. 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.800
 to appear several pimples out of nothing and then 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:21.240
 I had to start taking care of the 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:23.340
 hematologist passed some of the products 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.189
 I got to take medicine but it was not 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.349
 something that was also magical for 45 days 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.150
 so improved only that it always stayed 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.900
 Going back and forth and do not know the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.219
 what to do 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.469
 Let a daughter grow and then only now. 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.870
 at the beginning of the year that I decided to cut 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.370
 again and this has been worrying about cutting 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.340
 and the pimples will come back 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.039
 but incredible as it may seem they are gone 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.010
 sometimes you think not to go back there, I'll go 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:53.670
 I like fingernails and twice a night. 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.160
 per day as March apex soap and 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.230
 Orange so who 's in here? 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.100
 image because the game is otherwise not the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:05.030
 paper people 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:05.030
 I wash step almost there are people of the island 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:12.600
 cotton step and after washing the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 face and then passes protector that is the 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:20.700
 filter 30 is ultra dry is important 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:23.909
 Look Who Has Oily Skin Do not Use 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.400
 Normal protective because it will keep 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.280
 look a lot in her fifth on her face 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.060
 during the day I make another stand sector 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.329
 when I need to wash my face for 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:40.140
 the day that sometimes I'm alive for some 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:43.950
 place for the gym, I do not know, I need 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.810
 wash out only those two times I 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.810
 I use this cleaning boy. 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.280
 that he is not worth Joshua for all 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.710
 types of good skin 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.179
 At night I have three product options 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:08.539
 to pass in the pocket 

00:01:59.179 --> 00:02:17.110
 to spear the first time well from here even though 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:17.110
 this gel is that of paper 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.190
 they all stay the night another day 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.180
 in the morning when I use these 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.840
 products 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:28.940
 my skin starts is a little but not 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.670
 stop here to stop using the 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.980
 products and continue to treat 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:37.099
 problems I have with the risks 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:41.780
 there are two options for the use of 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:47.140
 the situation is critical or is the 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.140
 I use this here of facial moisturizing lÃºbia 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.829
 he is very good 

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.069
 sometimes even money because so 

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:57.069
 even the old ones I have to deal with 

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:59.750
 I think all those here that I showed 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.609
 at night has a recipe 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.709
 I got this problem from the shopkeeper you 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:04.730
 this week we can talk 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.030
 about them 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:10.549
 or wait for it to pass the product 

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:12.799
 ideal if I had a problem are these 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:15.230
 care I have is no big deal 

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:16.940
 just the products that I usually 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:19.069
 use every day 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.989
 it is important to remember that the protector has 

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:23.720
 to use all day mainly those 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:25.549
 You have problem with spine because those who have 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:28.069
 problem with spine usually 

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:31.220
 The toucan always stays 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:34.579
 and this is what causes sun spots 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.910
 There I go. I think there's Spain. 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:40.160
 Where did you move the protector altogether? 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.090
 solar is very important from the 

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.090
 30 filter
