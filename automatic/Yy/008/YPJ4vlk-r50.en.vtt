00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:23.320
 circumvented then make the marks of the holes 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:25.700
 with connecting a risk 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:29.299

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:31.490
 lines then I put some material that is 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:37.180
 a stone grinding machine does not 

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:37.180
 have grip because they don't want to sideways 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.820
 some material where it is missing is a pair 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.190
 of hours before they begin to turn to 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:49.870
 what starts to leave with water 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:53.110
 because they do n't want it shouldn't 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:56.980
 being more wet is dust is more 

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:58.690
 track and bites more and more fun but she the 

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.660
 material like having found the track 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:03.370

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.730

 the material that was there to do 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.050
 what he tries to do 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:36.460

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:38.740

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.700

 very pleasant with a nice group of friends 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.920
 in fact if you then end up on one 

00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:33.220

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:53.489
