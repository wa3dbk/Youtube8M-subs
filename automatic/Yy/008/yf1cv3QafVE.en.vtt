00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
dressing that we'll just add two Greek

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.080 
dressing that we'll just add two Greek
yogurt<00:03:22.020> Greek<00:03:22.410> yogurt<00:03:22.830> is<00:03:23.370> so<00:03:23.670> good<00:03:23.850> for<00:03:23.880> you

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:29.130 
regular yogurt so now the last step is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:32.500 
regular yogurt so now the last step is
our<00:03:29.280> chicken<00:03:29.520> we're<00:03:30.450> gonna<00:03:30.540> sliced<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.170> and

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
chicken is a great protein to have but

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.350 
chicken is a great protein to have but
you<00:03:36.450> can<00:03:36.480> also<00:03:36.840> change<00:03:37.770> it<00:03:37.920> up<00:03:38.070> for<00:03:38.250> tofu<00:03:38.640> firm

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.360 
you can also change it up for tofu firm

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.240 
you can also change it up for tofu firm
tofu<00:03:39.630> that<00:03:39.810> you<00:03:40.020> could<00:03:40.260> also<00:03:40.410> marinate<00:03:40.980> and

tofu that you could also marinate and
grill<00:03:43.520> so<00:03:44.520> the<00:03:44.640> last<00:03:44.850> step<00:03:45.180> is<00:03:45.420> to<00:03:45.600> simply

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080
