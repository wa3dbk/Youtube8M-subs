00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.100
 in a nutshell, it's about the behringer 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.470
 10x 802 usb have fun with the short 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.530
 I have been doing this for a good year now 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.809
 behringer 10x 802 usb now with the 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.700
 Red dancers in use and I have to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.230
 say so far I am quite satisfied 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.869
 but let's start in a row 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.800
 the behringer 10 xq 802 is processed 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.689
 perfect 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.189
 the buttons and wheels do not wobble and 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.320
 you can still move well 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:27.960
 the connection went via usb to the pc 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.849
 Perfect only the electricity connection 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.500
 leaf after a while very hot 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.700
 like the mixer itself in this 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.800
 You should therefore be very considerate 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.149
 be careful but of course something 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.340
 mixing console next to a built-in 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.980
 Sound card, however, only with the usb 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:43.950
 version also two xlr ports 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:46.829
 and six other 63mm jacks in puts 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.719
 but for example headphones with a 3 5 mm 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:50.670
 to connect a jack requires one 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:52.590
 small adapter and this was not in the 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.539
 scope of delivery included for each of 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:56.190
 both xlr and share too for the 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.149
 another impulse is the volume 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.920
 out of control 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.899
 but also with the help of the blue wheels 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.210
 for the deep middle and treble a 

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:04.890
 adjust equalizer and like the 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.689
 There is also the possibility of control 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.330
 sound effects through the connection of a 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.979
 play pcs into one of the puts 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 however, I still have this 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.060
 not tested positively 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.939
 me also that the mixer all 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.740
 48 volt phantom voltage delivers with it 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.030
 can be perfectly synonymous several 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.710
 operate microphones 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.869
 I have that too for a while 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.640
 behringer 10 xq 802 to one 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.740
 speaker system connected 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.750
 but it was very fast 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.710
 Override the real on the duration 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.159
 were annoying 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.350
 but for whom is 18 x800 now two usb 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:39.780
 something very clear for everyone at home 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:41.479
 record more than one microphone 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.409
 Want and much emphasis on accurate 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.460
 Options such as a 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.110
 Laying equalizer 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.430
 for those who only have a mixer 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.619
 they need a single one 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:52.439
 I can operate a microphone from 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:55.470
 behringer 10x chur 802 ab can but you 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:57.119
 that ten xq 302 usb as smaller and 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.009
 recommend cheaper version 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.390
 current prices and more technical 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.729
 Of course we have data in the 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.040
 description also links to the sound 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.470
 depends of course the creative t4 wireless 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.540
 sound system together 1 0 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.009
 we have produced here or you 

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.050
 Just click in the brand new one 

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.330
 appreciate real life challenge weight 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:18.040
