and<00:00:00.960> the<00:00:01.380> other<00:00:01.530> thing<00:00:01.890> that<00:00:02.129> I<00:00:02.580> can<00:00:02.610> say<00:00:03.000> and

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:03.270 
and the other thing that I can say and

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.809 
and the other thing that I can say and
what<00:00:04.049> I<00:00:04.080> do<00:00:04.230> and<00:00:04.680> how<00:00:04.799> it<00:00:04.980> relates<00:00:05.339> again<00:00:05.759> to

00:00:05.809 --> 00:00:05.819 
what I do and how it relates again to

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.919 
what I do and how it relates again to
the<00:00:06.750> music<00:00:07.109> of<00:00:07.259> the<00:00:07.440> West<00:00:07.680> End<00:00:08.040> of<00:00:08.130> the<00:00:08.189> East<00:00:08.490> is

00:00:08.919 --> 00:00:08.929 
the music of the West End of the East is

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:11.360 
the music of the West End of the East is
rhythmically<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:10.139> lot<00:00:10.769> of<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.010> way<00:00:11.130> that<00:00:11.340> I

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
rhythmically a lot of the way that I

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.180 
rhythmically a lot of the way that I
play<00:00:11.700> on<00:00:12.000> guitar<00:00:12.450> is<00:00:12.719> based<00:00:13.230> on<00:00:13.530> different

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
play on guitar is based on different

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:16.430 
play on guitar is based on different
combinations<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.780> rhythm<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.230> coordination

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
combinations of rhythm and coordination

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.950 
combinations of rhythm and coordination
so<00:00:18.770> like<00:00:19.770> say<00:00:20.310> a<00:00:20.609> rhythm<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.210> coordination<00:00:21.720> of<00:00:21.840> a

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
so like say a rhythm a coordination of a

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:50.990 
so like say a rhythm a coordination of a
six<00:00:29.660> one<00:00:30.660> two<00:00:30.720> three<00:00:31.140> four<00:00:31.410> five<00:00:31.590> six

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.850 

I<00:00:51.750> would<00:00:52.710> say<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.960> the<00:00:54.960> thing<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:55.650> remember

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
I would say that the thing to remember

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.440 
I would say that the thing to remember
about<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.280> there's<00:00:56.820> a<00:00:56.880> couple<00:00:57.090> different

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:57.450 
about that there's a couple different

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.690 
about that there's a couple different
things<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.870> my<00:00:58.020> case<00:00:58.320> that's<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.160> angle<00:00:59.550> of

00:00:59.690 --> 00:00:59.700 
things in my case that's the angle of

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.830 
things in my case that's the angle of
the<00:00:59.790> pig<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.380> play<00:01:01.380> with<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.710> Pico<00:01:02.070> a<00:01:02.840> pretty

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
the pig I play with the Pico a pretty

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.850 
the pig I play with the Pico a pretty
severe<00:01:04.229> angle

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
severe angle

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.160 
severe angle
it's<00:01:05.670> almost<00:01:05.880> sideways<00:01:06.330> almost<00:01:06.870> totally

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
it's almost sideways almost totally

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.370 
it's almost sideways almost totally
sideways<00:01:07.560> I<00:01:07.740> don't<00:01:07.920> always<00:01:08.280> play<00:01:08.580> that<00:01:08.760> way

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
sideways I don't always play that way

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.140 
sideways I don't always play that way
but<00:01:10.380> when<00:01:10.500> I'm<00:01:10.590> doing<00:01:10.860> a<00:01:10.950> lot<00:01:11.070> of<00:01:11.150> faster

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
but when I'm doing a lot of faster

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
but when I'm doing a lot of faster
picking<00:01:12.450> things<00:01:12.630> it's<00:01:13.020> pretty<00:01:13.260> much<00:01:13.410> always

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
picking things it's pretty much always

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:27.570 
picking things it's pretty much always
almost<00:01:13.979> totally<00:01:14.430> silent

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.810 

so<00:01:28.180> one<00:01:28.630> thing<00:01:28.869> is<00:01:28.930> the<00:01:29.619> angle<00:01:30.159> of<00:01:30.220> the<00:01:30.340> pic<00:01:30.580> and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
so one thing is the angle of the pic and

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.649 
so one thing is the angle of the pic and
then<00:01:30.909> the<00:01:31.630> other<00:01:31.810> thing<00:01:32.110> is<00:01:33.180> the<00:01:34.180> kind<00:01:34.450> of<00:01:34.479> the

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:34.659 
then the other thing is the kind of the

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:36.990 
then the other thing is the kind of the
focus<00:01:35.200> of<00:01:35.350> the<00:01:35.500> movement<00:01:36.009> if<00:01:36.159> I'm<00:01:36.580> doing<00:01:36.880> it

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
focus of the movement if I'm doing it

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:48.700 
focus of the movement if I'm doing it
really<00:01:37.450> fast

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:48.710 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:52.690 

it's<00:01:49.610> because<00:01:50.260> it's<00:01:51.260> almost<00:01:51.530> like<00:01:51.770> a<00:01:51.800> focusing

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
it's because it's almost like a focusing

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.810 
it's because it's almost like a focusing
and<00:01:52.880> a<00:01:52.940> squeezing<00:01:54.310> sensation<00:01:55.310> it's<00:01:55.610> like<00:01:55.790> a

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:55.820 
and a squeezing sensation it's like a

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:57.850 
and a squeezing sensation it's like a
phonograph<00:01:56.180> needle<00:01:56.900> you<00:01:57.200> just<00:01:57.410> try<00:01:57.590> to<00:01:57.650> focus

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
phonograph needle you just try to focus

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:00.160 
phonograph needle you just try to focus
the<00:01:58.160> energy<00:01:58.280> into<00:01:58.700> such<00:01:58.880> a<00:01:58.910> small<00:01:59.210> space<00:01:59.390> that

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
the energy into such a small space that

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.700 
the energy into such a small space that
you<00:02:00.830> can<00:02:04.660> especially<00:02:05.660> when<00:02:06.110> when<00:02:06.410> moving

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
you can especially when when moving

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.560 
you can especially when when moving
around<00:02:07.040> but<00:02:07.760> what<00:02:07.910> I<00:02:07.940> was<00:02:08.119> going<00:02:08.300> to<00:02:08.330> say<00:02:08.539> that

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
around but what I was going to say that

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.270 
around but what I was going to say that
that<00:02:08.959> may<00:02:09.259> shed<00:02:09.500> some<00:02:09.530> light<00:02:09.709> on<00:02:09.920> that<00:02:09.950> that

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
that may shed some light on that that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.440 
that may shed some light on that that
relates<00:02:10.550> back<00:02:10.759> to<00:02:10.820> what<00:02:11.030> I<00:02:11.060> was<00:02:11.090> saying<00:02:11.270> about

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
relates back to what I was saying about

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.510 
relates back to what I was saying about
the<00:02:11.600> Indian<00:02:11.959> music<00:02:12.260> is<00:02:12.410> it's<00:02:12.950> the<00:02:13.100> way<00:02:13.250> they

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:13.520 
the Indian music is it's the way they

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.560 
the Indian music is it's the way they
relate<00:02:14.740> to<00:02:15.740> music<00:02:15.890> which<00:02:16.430> seems<00:02:16.640> to<00:02:16.790> me<00:02:16.940> a<00:02:17.270> way

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
relate to music which seems to me a way

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.640 
relate to music which seems to me a way
that<00:02:17.750> makes<00:02:17.900> sense<00:02:17.990> is<00:02:18.970> through<00:02:20.650> there's

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
that makes sense is through there's

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.740 
that makes sense is through there's
different<00:02:22.060> syllables<00:02:23.060> in<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.390> north<00:02:23.570> and

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
different syllables in the north and

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.330 
different syllables in the north and
south<00:02:23.959> in<00:02:24.230> this<00:02:24.380> in<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.650> south<00:02:24.920> it's<00:02:25.160> like

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:25.340 
south in this in the south it's like

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.449 
south in this in the south it's like
what<00:02:26.120> is<00:02:26.239> it<00:02:26.390> that<00:02:26.600> they<00:02:27.530> do<00:02:27.590> they<00:02:28.310> have<00:02:28.430> a

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:28.459 
what is it that they do they have a

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.390 
what is it that they do they have a
different<00:02:28.970> syllable<00:02:29.750> for<00:02:29.959> each<00:02:30.140> nut<00:02:30.980> added

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
different syllable for each nut added

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.880 
different syllable for each nut added
number<00:02:31.670> of<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.880> rhythm<00:02:32.120> so<00:02:32.360> taka<00:02:33.020> did<00:02:33.320> me<00:02:33.470> 1<00:02:33.739> 2

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
number of the rhythm so taka did me 1 2

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:35.740 
number of the rhythm so taka did me 1 2
3<00:02:33.920> 4<00:02:34.280> so<00:02:34.459> they<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.700> say<00:02:34.820> like<00:02:34.940> taka<00:02:35.239> did<00:02:35.600> me

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
3 4 so they would say like taka did me

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.900 
3 4 so they would say like taka did me
which<00:02:36.200> would<00:02:36.350> be<00:02:36.470> 4<00:02:36.709> is<00:02:36.830> 1<00:02:36.950> 2<00:02:37.040> 3<00:02:37.130> 4<00:02:37.310> 1<00:02:37.370> 2<00:02:37.520> 3<00:02:37.550> 4<00:02:37.790> 1<00:02:37.880> 2

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
which would be 4 is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.720 
which would be 4 is 1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 1 2
3<00:02:38.000> 4<00:02:38.090> academic<00:02:38.690> academic<00:02:38.900> academic<00:02:39.459> and<00:02:40.459> then

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:40.730 
3 4 academic academic academic and then

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.490 
3 4 academic academic academic and then
like<00:02:40.910> fives<00:02:41.239> would<00:02:41.630> be<00:02:41.750> talking<00:02:41.959> to<00:02:42.200> Mita
