composition<00:00:20.789> really<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.480> suppose<00:00:21.779> as<00:00:21.960> the<00:00:22.080> main

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
composition really I suppose as the main

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.660 
composition really I suppose as the main
thing<00:00:22.439> but<00:00:22.590> it<00:00:22.680> also<00:00:22.859> helps<00:00:23.279> us<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.400> lot<00:00:23.519> of

improvisation this is this is what I

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.370 
improvisation this is this is what I
think<00:00:26.010> about<00:00:26.099> often<00:00:26.490> when<00:00:27.180> I'm<00:00:27.390> superimposing

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
think about often when I'm superimposing

other<00:00:28.529> types<00:00:28.830> of<00:00:28.980> chords<00:00:29.750> sometimes<00:00:30.750> it's<00:00:30.960> a

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
other types of chords sometimes it's a

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.630 
other types of chords sometimes it's a
secondary<00:00:31.560> dominant<00:00:32.040> movement<00:00:32.369> which<00:00:32.489> is

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
secondary dominant movement which is

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.819 
secondary dominant movement which is
true<00:00:33.000> to<00:00:33.180> a<00:00:33.210> key<00:00:33.480> so<00:00:33.930> we<00:00:33.960> have<00:00:34.230> these<00:00:34.440> area

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
true to a key so we have these area

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.569 
chords of just a b-flat major C minor is
our<00:00:39.300> two<00:00:39.510> chord<00:00:39.840> I<00:00:40.110> think<00:00:40.980> that's<00:00:41.100> called<00:00:41.399> the

00:00:41.569 --> 00:00:41.579 
our two chord I think that's called the

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.970 
our two chord I think that's called the
what<00:00:42.420> does<00:00:42.510> they<00:00:42.600> called<00:00:42.840> can<00:00:43.379> never<00:00:43.559> remember

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539

that's<00:00:49.079> called<00:00:49.260> something<00:00:49.590> rather<00:00:49.770> and<00:00:50.160> then

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
that's called something rather and then

that's called something rather and then
for<00:00:51.090> gordon<00:00:51.449> says<00:00:51.600> L<00:00:51.750> sub<00:00:51.960> dominant<00:00:52.170> five

major they're nice little a flat which
against<00:01:10.740> an<00:01:10.830> ifs<00:01:11.070> out<00:01:13.310> gives<00:01:14.310> us<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.610> feeling

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
against an ifs out gives us this feeling

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.399 
against an ifs out gives us this feeling
of<00:01:15.000> digitally<00:01:15.450> so<00:01:15.630> that's<00:01:15.810> our<00:01:15.990> dominant

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
of digitally so that's our dominant

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.950 
of digitally so that's our dominant
chord<00:01:16.650> in<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.430> key<00:01:17.700> and<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.150> blend<00:01:18.450> but<00:01:18.840> I'll

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
chord in the key and we blend but I'll

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.749 
chord in the key and we blend but I'll
keep<00:01:19.080> going<00:01:19.409> with<00:01:19.619> God<00:01:19.830> g<00:01:20.070> minor<00:01:20.280> which<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> the

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
keep going with God g minor which is the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.789 
keep going with God g minor which is the
natural<00:01:21.090> minor<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> relative<00:01:22.080> minor<00:01:22.290> and

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
natural minor the relative minor and

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:24.080 
natural minor the relative minor and
then<00:01:22.920> we<00:01:22.979> have<00:01:23.159> here<00:01:23.430> a<00:01:23.490> little<00:01:23.670> cord<00:01:23.939> which

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
then we have here a little cord which

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:25.999 
then we have here a little cord which
we're<00:01:24.270> gonna<00:01:24.420> probably<00:01:24.659> exclude<00:01:25.320> which<00:01:25.860> is

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
we're gonna probably exclude which is

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
we're gonna probably exclude which is
kind<00:01:26.250> of<00:01:26.400> like<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:27.299> suppose<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.869> were<00:01:27.960> talking

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
kind of like I suppose we were talking

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.210 
kind of like I suppose we were talking
about<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:28.530> triad<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:28.979> just<00:01:29.280> man

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:30.220

a<00:01:44.290> progression<00:01:44.620> I'm<00:01:45.310> so<00:01:45.550> you<00:01:45.610> can<00:01:45.790> make<00:01:45.880> it

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
a progression I'm so you can make it

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.970 
a progression I'm so you can make it
like<00:01:46.180> a<00:01:46.210> minus<00:01:46.600> simply<00:01:46.960> sexual<00:01:47.320> minus<00:01:47.680> 7

now this court here which is coming
before<00:02:21.520> this<00:02:22.090> chord<00:02:22.450> it<00:02:23.260> sounds<00:02:23.590> kind<00:02:23.800> of<00:02:23.860> nice

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
before this chord it sounds kind of nice

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.980

but<00:02:24.430> I'm<00:02:24.640> what<00:02:24.970> a<00:02:25.000> lot<00:02:25.209> of<00:02:25.300> jazz<00:02:25.450> players<00:02:25.690> do<00:02:25.900> is

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:25.990 
but I'm what a lot of jazz players do is

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:28.080 
but I'm what a lot of jazz players do is
they<00:02:26.230> turn<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.950> into<00:02:27.100> an<00:02:27.250> altered<00:02:27.520> corridor

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
they turn it into an altered corridor

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.230 
they turn it into an altered corridor
first<00:02:28.420> of<00:02:28.540> all<00:02:28.600> a<00:02:28.630> dominant<00:02:29.110> chord<00:02:29.970> and<00:02:30.970> we<00:02:31.090> can

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.240 
first of all a dominant chord and we can

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.160 
first of all a dominant chord and we can
see<00:02:31.420> that<00:02:31.570> now<00:02:31.750> our<00:02:31.959> leading<00:02:32.380> tone<00:02:34.170> has

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:35.170

see that now our leading tone has
changed<00:02:35.850> sorry<00:02:36.850> our<00:02:37.090> our<00:02:37.510> major<00:02:37.930> third<00:02:38.200> of<00:02:38.350> the

mother minor chord which we can approach

again from a fifth below so the case of

again from a fifth below so the case of
C<00:03:27.750> minor<00:03:27.989> was<00:03:28.260> geum<00:03:28.799> g7<00:03:29.609> going<00:03:29.849> towards<00:03:30.090> in<00:03:30.239> one

we<00:03:38.069> don't<00:03:38.250> really<00:03:38.639> think<00:03:38.790> about<00:03:38.909> the<00:03:39.180> semi<00:03:39.419> tab

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
we don't really think about the semi tab

we don't really think about the semi tab
below<00:03:39.810> dominant<00:03:40.319> but<00:03:41.099> listen<00:03:41.340> to<00:03:41.430> this<00:03:41.549> we<00:03:41.819> had

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:41.969 
below dominant but listen to this we had

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:55.130 
below dominant but listen to this we had
a<00:03:42.090> cushion

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:59.120 

I<00:03:56.780> can<00:03:57.780> actually<00:03:58.110> work<00:03:58.319> right<00:03:58.590> so<00:03:58.800> that<00:03:58.980> was<00:03:59.100> a

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
very roughly composed a piece where I

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:02.900 
very roughly composed a piece where I
tried<00:04:01.830> to<00:04:01.920> use<00:04:02.010> the<00:04:02.069> secondary<00:04:02.550> dominant
