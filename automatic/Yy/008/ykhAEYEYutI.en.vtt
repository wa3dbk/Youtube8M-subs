all<00:00:01.220> right<00:00:01.370> this<00:00:01.610> is<00:00:01.939> my<00:00:02.179> broken<00:00:02.539> ass<00:00:02.659> clock

00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:02.899 
all right this is my broken ass clock

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:06.240 
all right this is my broken ass clock
spring<00:00:03.169> you<00:00:03.769> kind<00:00:04.100> of<00:00:04.130> see<00:00:04.310> up<00:00:04.340> here<00:00:05.080> the

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:06.250 
spring you kind of see up here the

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:08.409 
spring you kind of see up here the
connector<00:00:07.250> that's<00:00:07.370> broken<00:00:07.759> off<00:00:07.880> no<00:00:08.209> that

00:00:08.409 --> 00:00:08.419 
connector that's broken off no that

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:10.839 
connector that's broken off no that
can't<00:00:08.629> just<00:00:08.690> plug<00:00:09.650> in<00:00:09.889> it's<00:00:10.610> gotta<00:00:10.759> be

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:10.849 
can't just plug in it's gotta be

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:13.589 
can't just plug in it's gotta be
restarted<00:00:11.360> in<00:00:11.509> what<00:00:12.169> I<00:00:12.200> think<00:00:12.530> can<00:00:12.650> be<00:00:12.799> done<00:00:12.829> is

00:00:13.589 --> 00:00:13.599 
restarted in what I think can be done is

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.879 
restarted in what I think can be done is
we<00:00:14.599> could<00:00:14.719> melt<00:00:14.929> down<00:00:15.019> this<00:00:15.289> plastic<00:00:15.709> if<00:00:15.799> you

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:15.889 
we could melt down this plastic if you

00:00:15.889 --> 00:00:17.770 
we could melt down this plastic if you
see<00:00:16.039> the<00:00:16.130> copper<00:00:16.400> leaves<00:00:16.580> inside<00:00:16.940> we<00:00:17.540> melt

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:17.780 
see the copper leaves inside we melt

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.930 
see the copper leaves inside we melt
down<00:00:17.960> the<00:00:18.080> plastic<00:00:18.530> and<00:00:18.680> run<00:00:19.340> jumper<00:00:19.700> wires

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:19.940 
down the plastic and run jumper wires

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.590 
down the plastic and run jumper wires
from<00:00:20.750> the<00:00:20.870> broken<00:00:21.470> copper<00:00:21.770> leads<00:00:21.950> here<00:00:22.250> and

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:22.600 
from the broken copper leads here and

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:27.250 
from the broken copper leads here and
jumper<00:00:23.600> wire<00:00:23.780> it<00:00:24.820> to<00:00:25.820> those<00:00:25.970> copper<00:00:26.720> leads<00:00:26.930> at

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:27.260 
jumper wire it to those copper leads at

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:30.070 
jumper wire it to those copper leads at
the<00:00:27.800> end<00:00:27.890> those<00:00:28.070> wires<00:00:28.340> and<00:00:28.820> could<00:00:29.030> work<00:00:29.210> well

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
the end those wires and could work well

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.960 
the end those wires and could work well
the<00:00:30.200> concept<00:00:30.560> of<00:00:30.680> the<00:00:30.740> clock<00:00:30.920> spring<00:00:31.220> is<00:00:31.400> to

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:31.970 
the concept of the clock spring is to

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:34.540 
the concept of the clock spring is to
maintain<00:00:32.390> continuity<00:00:32.890> between<00:00:33.890> the<00:00:34.220> steering

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:34.550 
maintain continuity between the steering

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:35.710 
maintain continuity between the steering
wheel<00:00:34.700> what<00:00:35.000> you<00:00:35.090> can't<00:00:35.240> really<00:00:35.360> see<00:00:35.540> right

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
wheel what you can't really see right

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.740 
wheel what you can't really see right
now<00:00:35.840> and<00:00:36.610> the<00:00:37.610> wiring<00:00:37.820> harness<00:00:38.239> that<00:00:38.510> goes

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:38.750 
now and the wiring harness that goes

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.750 
now and the wiring harness that goes
through<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> steering<00:00:39.200> column<00:00:39.440> so<00:00:40.220> the<00:00:40.550> way<00:00:40.640> it

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:40.760 
through a steering column so the way it

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:42.690 
through a steering column so the way it
works<00:00:40.790> so<00:00:41.720> you<00:00:41.780> can<00:00:41.960> turn<00:00:42.050> your<00:00:42.230> wheel<00:00:42.380> is<00:00:42.590> a

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:42.700 
works so you can turn your wheel is a

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:46.540 
works so you can turn your wheel is a
big<00:00:43.700> rodent<00:00:43.880> cable<00:00:44.180> in<00:00:44.270> here<00:00:44.420> and<00:00:45.460> when<00:00:46.460> you

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
big rodent cable in here and when you

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.750 
big rodent cable in here and when you
turn<00:00:46.760> the<00:00:46.910> clock<00:00:47.000> spring<00:00:48.010> all<00:00:49.010> the<00:00:49.340> wires<00:00:49.520> stay

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
turn the clock spring all the wires stay

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.069 
turn the clock spring all the wires stay
connected<00:00:49.970> you<00:00:50.210> can<00:00:50.329> see<00:00:50.450> you<00:00:50.540> could<00:00:50.690> turn

00:00:53.069 --> 00:00:53.079 

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:57.130

starting from this orange connector at
the<00:00:57.710> bottom<00:00:58.630> we<00:00:59.630> get<00:00:59.719> this<00:00:59.809> thing<00:00:59.870> back<00:01:00.140> in

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:00.290 
the bottom we get this thing back in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.450 
the bottom we get this thing back in
here<00:01:00.410> without<00:01:00.530> unwinding<00:01:01.250> it<00:01:01.340> to

can<00:01:10.490> be<00:01:10.729> turned<00:01:10.970> you<00:01:11.900> can<00:01:12.020> see<00:01:12.170> if<00:01:12.620> you<00:01:12.710> look<00:01:12.830> at

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:12.920 
can be turned you can see if you look at

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:14.680 
can be turned you can see if you look at
the<00:01:12.979> top<00:01:13.130> ribbon<00:01:13.340> cable<00:01:13.729> you<00:01:14.210> can<00:01:14.299> see<00:01:14.390> how

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
the top ribbon cable you can see how

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.810 
the top ribbon cable you can see how
it's<00:01:14.900> at<00:01:15.110> a<00:01:15.140> pretty<00:01:16.100> full<00:01:16.310> tension<00:01:16.520> right<00:01:16.790> now

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
it's at a pretty full tension right now

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.460 
it's at a pretty full tension right now
you<00:01:16.970> don't<00:01:17.119> wanna<00:01:17.240> go<00:01:17.330> any<00:01:17.479> more<00:01:17.630> you<00:01:18.229> can<00:01:18.290> turn

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:18.470 
you don't wanna go any more you can turn

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:25.030 
you don't wanna go any more you can turn
it<00:01:18.650> starting<00:01:19.010> at<00:01:19.100> the<00:01:19.159> bottom<00:01:19.659> you<00:01:20.659> can<00:01:20.810> go<00:01:24.040> one

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:25.040 
it starting at the bottom you can go one

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.170 
it starting at the bottom you can go one
turn<00:01:27.340> two<00:01:28.340> turns

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
turn two turns

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.330 
turn two turns
see<00:01:29.780> how<00:01:29.930> it's<00:01:30.080> all<00:01:30.170> unwinding<00:01:31.119> three<00:01:32.119> turns

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:33.340 
see how it's all unwinding three turns

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.780 
see how it's all unwinding three turns
four<00:01:34.340> turns<00:01:36.400> five<00:01:37.400> turns<00:01:39.130> six<00:01:40.130> turns<00:01:40.400> once<00:01:40.729> you

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:40.790 
four turns five turns six turns once you

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.270 
four turns five turns six turns once you
see<00:01:40.939> that<00:01:41.090> six<00:01:41.299> turn<00:01:41.540> see<00:01:42.200> how<00:01:42.409> that<00:01:42.590> bottom

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
see that six turn see how that bottom

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.219 
see that six turn see how that bottom
ribbon<00:01:43.580> cables<00:01:43.909> coming<00:01:44.060> tight<00:01:44.270> again<00:01:44.479> if<00:01:45.140> you

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:45.229 
ribbon cables coming tight again if you

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.469 
ribbon cables coming tight again if you
pull<00:01:45.409> that<00:01:45.500> too<00:01:45.740> hard

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:46.479 
pull that too hard

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:49.480 
pull that too hard
pull<00:01:47.479> your<00:01:47.600> wires<00:01:47.750> that<00:01:47.990> again<00:01:48.250> you<00:01:49.250> keep

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
pull your wires that again you keep

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.070 
pull your wires that again you keep
pulling<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.820> little<00:01:49.970> bit<00:01:50.119> I<00:01:50.299> guess<00:01:50.509> six<00:01:50.720> turns<00:01:50.990> I

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
pulling a little bit I guess six turns I

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.990 
pulling a little bit I guess six turns I
guess<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.259> get<00:01:54.350> about<00:01:54.590> six<00:01:55.430> and<00:01:55.580> a<00:01:55.610> half<00:01:55.640> turns

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
guess you get about six and a half turns

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.760 
guess you get about six and a half turns
out<00:01:56.270> of<00:01:56.360> it<00:01:56.450> but<00:01:56.570> I<00:01:56.630> wouldn't<00:01:56.900> trust<00:01:57.079> turning

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
out of it but I wouldn't trust turning

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
out of it but I wouldn't trust turning
it<00:01:57.860> much<00:01:57.979> more<00:01:58.159> see<00:01:58.340> how<00:01:58.400> it's<00:01:58.490> coming<00:01:58.640> on

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
it much more see how it's coming on

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.960 
it much more see how it's coming on
wound<00:01:59.710> anyways<00:02:00.710> that's<00:02:01.610> how<00:02:01.729> the<00:02:01.820> clock

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:01.970 
wound anyways that's how the clock

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:03.280 
wound anyways that's how the clock
spring<00:02:02.240> work<00:02:02.390> so<00:02:02.540> it's<00:02:02.659> very<00:02:02.780> important<00:02:03.259> to

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:03.290 
spring work so it's very important to

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.109 
spring work so it's very important to
make<00:02:03.470> sure<00:02:03.619> once<00:02:04.310> I<00:02:04.400> get<00:02:04.549> this<00:02:04.610> thing<00:02:04.790> fixed

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
make sure once I get this thing fixed

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.149 
make sure once I get this thing fixed
let<00:02:05.900> it<00:02:06.020> bite<00:02:06.140> the<00:02:06.290> center<00:02:06.560> so<00:02:06.710> we're<00:02:06.860> at<00:02:06.920> six

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:07.159 
let it bite the center so we're at six
