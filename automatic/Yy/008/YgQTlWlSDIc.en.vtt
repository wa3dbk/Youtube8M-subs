00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.790
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.180
 politics and today with a new video 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.670
 on the subject of nutrition and that is what I have 

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.500
 an interesting they get in there 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.150
 stands or has me one 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.369
 Participant wrote if that is 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.130
 Not too much fruit is what I am like 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:26.890
 in on facebook or youtube on my 

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:28.570
 blog so all the recipes if there 

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.430
 not too much fruit in it 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.760
 it was indeed fructose has say 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.680
 sugar and that's the first thing 

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.630
 would 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.030
 basically is so fruit is a very 

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:41.500
 controversial topic and then has 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.130
 probably everyone so his a man 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.960
 to 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.850
 Today I want to tell you what mine 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.900
 opinion is and why this is my husband 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:49.090
 is or 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:50.560
 what my experiences with that are so 

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.700
 not only with myself but just 

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.130
 also with my participants 

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:57.520
 and it is actually that fruit 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:59.590
 Of course, fructose contains pointless 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.950
 nothing but preferably is a 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:05.950
 another name for fructose and can 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:07.900
 I say I can only cause that 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:10.990
 the removal process a bit in the 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.840
 falter but that is only because 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.090
 so if you think so , that's it 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:18.909
 only a problem when the crowds 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:22.210
 fruit is and if you are in any case 

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:23.950
 you are already so far in your process 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.569
 lose weight and get fit 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.999
 what you thought at all 

00:01:25.569 --> 00:01:29.439
 have to do it honestly for the 

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.170
 Most people and I try it 

00:01:29.439 --> 00:01:34.119
 Carefully express is the apple 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.819
 The beginning you do not eat the problem 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.619
 So to think about fruit thoughts 

00:01:36.819 --> 00:01:41.229
 and what about the fructose in 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:42.969
 your body makes think I'm only doing 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.310
 meaning if you really made it 

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:47.350
 to optimize a diet so that you 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:50.799
 to think about such details 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.850
 because an apple a day or the 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:55.580
 Bears in the muesli in the morning and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:57.049
 A banal after the sport is really 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:58.909
 not the problem so I say so too 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.710
 is always important that that 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.420
 his food and a 

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.430
 memorial I want to see me 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.979
 It speaks absolutely nothing against fruit 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:08.660
 if we start now as children 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.039
 To eat bananas then I would say 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.140
 okay that maybe is not necessarily 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.870
 the nutritional ones the most 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:17.000
 beneficial is just fine of course 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.950
 there are many carbohydrates too 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.319
 actually allowing in digital 

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:23.060
 limits you can lose weight faster 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.160
 but you have to differentiate more 

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.750
 Carbohydrates come to me too 

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:28.580
 already in other videos it made so 

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.500
 is very high difference whether the customers 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.709
 are phase from the gang from the office 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.050
 get it or if the carbohydrates off 

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:40.790
 pasta bread or sweets comes from 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:42.440
 so please do not let yourself be there 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.600
 I make it crazy myself 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.280
 experience made that when I am very 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:48.049
 eat a lot of fruit and that's what I mean 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:50.989
 So much is happening here 

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:53.480
 just so insanely delicious things yes 

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:55.940
 the that you can not help out 

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.620
 up to 40 degrees is of course great too 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:59.390
 have the experience that we have 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.390
 do not eat a lot of fruit then mine 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.579
 I get very busy that I notice 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.610
 that the fed up a bit 

00:03:04.579 --> 00:03:09.769
 but stagnation is out of view at all 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:11.650
 nothing bad on the contrary 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:14.269
 itself contains a lot of fiber 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.670
 vitamins and is a really great 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:18.230
 alternative for many people the 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:19.459
 cravings for having sweet 

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.799
 so if you wear for example 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.930
 cravings for chocolate or never 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.130
 which or other scrap is 

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:29.490
 dried fruit 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.870
 Fresh fruit a great alternative 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.540
 so satisfies a little the sweet 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.980
 tooth without the whole train and the whole 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:37.710
 scrap we see in the other things 

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.300
 So my guess is you are up 

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:41.810
 not crazy in any case 

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:43.890
 if you have your diet 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:46.320
 is basically optimized then 

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:48.390
 definitely also fruit allowed and you 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:51.050
 should also eat fruit if it is not 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:55.020
 immeasurably because we the exaggerates a 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.660
 little impact on a customer's success 

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.730
 So do not worry if you have 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.530
 now half an apple may eat it was one 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.840
 whole apple has too much fructose 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:04.830
 So that is quite rare, as I said 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.650
 the problem 

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:09.630
 I hope that this video a bit 

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.000
 how does this help a bit? 

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:14.400
 to make crazy what fruits this is 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.440
 you can continue to eat fruit and 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.060
 if you really really want extreme 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.640
 pay attention to how many 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.290
 carbohydrates in the daytime then I can 

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:25.190
 you recommend certain types of fruit 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:27.810
 to pick out, for example, would be so 

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:31.940
 in the morning in your breakfast 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:34.380
 different berries of every kind in wanheim 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.080
 strawberries currants raspberries out 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.840
 So everything said to water 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.820
 while it's super good, it has little 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.710
 carbohydrates if that's your problem 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.030
 but you should not have one either 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.040
 to think about how to deal with it 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:49.820
 Open bananas are 1000 times 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:54.120
 better fruit than sweets or 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:56.700
 other fastfood then your sweet ones 

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.550
 tooth satisfied ok so that was mine 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.560
 tip for today if you have loss sluggish 

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:02.730
 and effective and healthy decrease since 

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:04.080

 experiences have made this all about 

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:26.370
