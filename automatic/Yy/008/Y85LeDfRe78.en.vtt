00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.850 
now you see there's an opening here so
you<00:02:40.500> can<00:02:40.680> at<00:02:40.740> least<00:02:40.850> judge<00:02:41.850> this<00:02:42.600> opening<00:02:43.200> but

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
you can at least judge this opening but

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:45.650 
you can at least judge this opening but
and<00:02:44.490> you<00:02:44.580> look<00:02:44.760> at<00:02:44.940> it<00:02:45.090> you<00:02:45.150> go<00:02:45.270> oh<00:02:45.300> yeah<00:02:45.630> that's

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
and you look at it you go oh yeah that's

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.730 
and you look at it you go oh yeah that's
simple<00:02:46.880> there<00:02:47.880> but<00:02:48.420> since<00:02:48.630> both<00:02:49.230> sides<00:02:49.290> are

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
simple there but since both sides are

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.020 
simple there but since both sides are
working<00:02:49.890> against<00:02:50.550> each<00:02:50.640> other

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
working against each other

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.240 
working against each other
the<00:02:51.360> top<00:02:51.600> and<00:02:51.780> the<00:02:51.840> bottom<00:02:51.990> it's<00:02:52.800> not<00:02:53.100> as

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:53.250 
the top and the bottom it's not as

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.270 
the top and the bottom it's not as
simple<00:02:53.460> as<00:02:53.880> you<00:02:54.210> think<00:02:54.630> I<00:02:54.930> can<00:02:55.740> get<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:55.950> to<00:02:56.040> here

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:56.280 
simple as you think I can get it to here

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.370
