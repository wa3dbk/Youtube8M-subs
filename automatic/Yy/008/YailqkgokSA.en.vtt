now<00:03:50.720> take<00:03:51.650> it<00:03:51.799> off<00:03:51.920> the<00:03:52.070> heat<00:03:53.170> now<00:03:54.170> as<00:03:54.230> time

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
now take it off the heat now as time

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.979 
now take it off the heat now as time
goes<00:03:54.829> on<00:03:55.100> the<00:03:55.700> sauce<00:03:56.000> will<00:03:56.299> get<00:03:56.450> thicker<00:03:56.750> and

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
goes on the sauce will get thicker and

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:00.009 
goes on the sauce will get thicker and
darker<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:58.070> oil<00:03:58.340> starts<00:03:58.940> to<00:03:59.000> separate<00:03:59.630> and

darker the oil starts to separate and

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:03.250 
darker the oil starts to separate and
you'll<00:04:00.590> need<00:04:00.829> to<00:04:01.100> stir<00:04:01.579> the<00:04:01.940> gravy<00:04:02.060> more<00:04:02.780> often

you'll need to stir the gravy more often

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.199 
you'll need to stir the gravy more often
to<00:04:03.500> stop<00:04:03.739> it<00:04:03.890> burning<00:04:04.160> on<00:04:04.489> the<00:04:04.549> bottom<00:04:04.940> of<00:04:05.060> the

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
to stop it burning on the bottom of the

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.120 
to stop it burning on the bottom of the
pan

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:06.130

eventually<00:04:07.130> the<00:04:07.609> sauce<00:04:07.910> will<00:04:08.209> get<00:04:08.359> quite

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:08.660 
eventually the sauce will get quite
