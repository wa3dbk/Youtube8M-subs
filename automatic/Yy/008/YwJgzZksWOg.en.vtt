the gem store is the arcane outfits now
this<00:00:15.900> was<00:00:16.049> data<00:00:16.260> mined<00:00:16.560> a<00:00:16.680> couple<00:00:16.920> weeks<00:00:17.039> ago

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160 
this was data mined a couple weeks ago

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.519 
this was data mined a couple weeks ago
by<00:00:17.460> that<00:00:17.730> shaman<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.480> he<00:00:19.050> called<00:00:19.350> it<00:00:19.500> the

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
by that shaman and he called it the

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.859 
by that shaman and he called it the
dervish<00:00:20.160> outfit<00:00:20.670> and<00:00:20.880> indeed<00:00:21.210> the<00:00:21.660> hood

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
dervish outfit and indeed the hood

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.380 
dervish outfit and indeed the hood
especially<00:00:22.439> and<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.890> wide<00:00:23.490> skirt<00:00:23.880> definitely

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
especially and the wide skirt definitely

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.750 
especially and the wide skirt definitely
looks<00:00:24.660> like<00:00:24.779> a<00:00:24.930> dervish<00:00:25.369> could<00:00:26.369> this<00:00:26.519> be<00:00:26.730> a

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
looks like a dervish could this be a

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:29.330 
looks like a dervish could this be a
hint<00:00:27.060> of<00:00:27.240> maybe<00:00:27.930> classes<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.740> come<00:00:28.920> I<00:00:29.250> don't

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
hint of maybe classes to come I don't

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:32.569 
hint of maybe classes to come I don't
know<00:00:29.580> but<00:00:30.060> it<00:00:30.300> looks<00:00:30.330> really<00:00:30.929> cool<00:00:31.340> my<00:00:32.340> guess

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
know but it looks really cool my guess

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.190 
know but it looks really cool my guess
that's<00:00:32.730> why<00:00:32.969> it's<00:00:33.239> called<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> arcane<00:00:33.840> outfit

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
that's why it's called the arcane outfit

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:36.319 
that's why it's called the arcane outfit
is<00:00:34.320> maybe<00:00:34.620> it's<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.550> a<00:00:35.640> little<00:00:35.880> reminiscent

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
is maybe it's it's a little reminiscent

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.380 
is maybe it's it's a little reminiscent
of<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:37.020> durmand<00:00:37.680> Priory<00:00:37.790> perhaps<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.300> don't

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
of the durmand Priory perhaps I don't

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.299 
of the durmand Priory perhaps I don't
know<00:00:39.690> if<00:00:39.840> we've<00:00:39.989> seen<00:00:40.020> this<00:00:40.379> outfit<00:00:40.920> in-game

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
know if we've seen this outfit in-game

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.220 
know if we've seen this outfit in-game
before<00:00:41.550> maybe<00:00:41.969> on<00:00:42.120> an<00:00:42.239> NPC<00:00:42.600> or<00:00:42.629> something<00:00:43.050> but

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
before maybe on an NPC or something but

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.160 
before maybe on an NPC or something but
it's<00:00:44.070> pretty<00:00:44.760> cool<00:00:45.270> and<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.660> course<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:46.079> is

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
it's pretty cool and of course it is

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.799 
it's pretty cool and of course it is
completely<00:00:46.530> diable<00:00:47.300> showing<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.390> preview

here<00:00:49.230> on<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.980> couple<00:00:50.219> different<00:00:50.480> races

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
here on a couple different races

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.200 
here on a couple different races
it<00:00:52.350> appears<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.340> be<00:00:53.370> exactly<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.180> same

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
it appears to be exactly the same

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.029 
it appears to be exactly the same
whether<00:00:54.750> you<00:00:54.960> put<00:00:55.110> it<00:00:55.230> on<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.350> male<00:00:55.620> or<00:00:55.920> a<00:00:55.949> female

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
whether you put it on a male or a female

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:58.939 
whether you put it on a male or a female
and<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:57.629> looks<00:00:57.870> similar<00:00:58.140> whether<00:00:58.500> you<00:00:58.649> put<00:00:58.859> it

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and it looks similar whether you put it

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.090 
and it looks similar whether you put it
on<00:00:59.070> in<00:00:59.250> a<00:00:59.309> Sarah<00:00:59.579> a<00:00:59.820> char<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.600> human<00:01:01.230> it's

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
on in a Sarah a char a human it's

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.649 
on in a Sarah a char a human it's
extremely<00:01:03.000> similar<00:01:03.270> but<00:01:04.229> very<00:01:05.010> cool<00:01:05.540> next<00:01:06.540> we

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659

so that's pretty cool I also swear at
one<00:03:44.900> point<00:03:45.109> when<00:03:45.319> going<00:03:45.500> through<00:03:45.590> the

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:45.859 
one point when going through the

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:47.830 
one point when going through the
finishers<00:03:46.340> looking<00:03:46.639> for<00:03:46.790> new<00:03:46.940> ones<00:03:47.090> I<00:03:47.329> did<00:03:47.569> see

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:47.840 
finishers looking for new ones I did see

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.530 
finishers looking for new ones I did see
a<00:03:47.870> new<00:03:48.549> finisher<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:50.209> when<00:03:50.329> I<00:03:50.359> actually

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
a new finisher but when I actually

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.360 
a new finisher but when I actually
started<00:03:50.989> recording<00:03:51.319> and<00:03:51.650> tried<00:03:51.799> to<00:03:51.829> find<00:03:52.100> it<00:03:52.280> I

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:52.370 
started recording and tried to find it I

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.340 
started recording and tried to find it I
couldn't<00:03:52.880> seem<00:03:53.120> to<00:03:53.150> find<00:03:53.480> it<00:03:53.630> so<00:03:53.870> I'm<00:03:54.079> not<00:03:54.290> sure

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
couldn't seem to find it so I'm not sure

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.069 
couldn't seem to find it so I'm not sure
