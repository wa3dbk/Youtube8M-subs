00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.760
Newly released product in 2015… 
Is there any good one?

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.760
Oh, I must buy it!!

00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:16.960
I want to buy it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.680
I want to buy it…

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.740
I really want to buy..

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.380
Is there any good way?

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.380
My mom’s credit card?

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.760
No, I Can’t…

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.588
My brother’s?

00:00:31.588 --> 00:00:34.140
No.. no..

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.520
If I don’t buy it now, it will be out of stock..

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.660
Oh! Right, that’s right!

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.340
Here’s the impulse buying!

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.540
Hello, I’m Mia.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.180
I’m trying to take beauty haul video 
of impulse buying (왔다지름신).

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.420
I didn’t film it because I didn’t buy that much last month.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:13.980
But because I bought few this May, I now am filming it.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.180
I bought it because there were so many advertisements.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:33.880
There is the product, toner and refill puff.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.900
You have to shake before usage,

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:51.580
turn it to ON, and press it.

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.920
OMG, what’s the smell?

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:06.840
It smells like a bond.. No..

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:19.680
I thought it was too white, 
but I liked the color and how it is applied.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:30.220
I think it will be better to use partly but not for the real base makeup.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.100
But I think dead skin cell could be seen well if you have dried skin,

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:37.260
So I recommend you to use it after enough skin care.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.260
I recommend it for oily skin.

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.120
But the smell makes me think that I’m ruining my skin….

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:52.660
I love it because it has chewy texture and cheap.

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:58.620
I bring one in small zipper bag to use it on the sides, I recommend it!

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:11.680
SKINFOOD Nail Vita Alpha that I bought while there were doing 1+1 sale.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.500
Because the color is like an ocean, I bought it to feel like I’m there.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.480
I don’t really apply nail that much

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.820
, but I’m buying some to be the queen of nail XD

00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:31.280
It’s just simple item.

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.040
I bought two, and I didn’t use one yet.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.100
The one that I used almost ran out already.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.480
There were events when I went LOTTE MART.

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.220
So I put it secretly on the cart of my boyfriend,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.780
and I was scolded that I bought it even I’m not a child haha

00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:01.480
Anyway, I really love this Pickled radish character, so I tried to buy this only,

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.140
but the scent of peach was so good that I bought this one also..

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:13.640
This smells sweet and girly but because it’s little bit deep,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:19.480
so I recommend you to use in fall and winter.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.980
Oh, this is Hair Body mist.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.260
And this is fresh and sweet girlish scent,

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.260
so it’s good to use now I’m using it now.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:40.340
It’s famous as cheap version of department brands.

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.160
No.2 for YSL, No.12
No.8 for Benefit Chacha Tint, 
No.12 for YSL, No.9 
and No.14 for Georgio Armani lip maestro no.400.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.400
And there were some who asked me about this watch,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:52.840
and this is just like built-in closet haha

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.100
Some were worried that I washed my face wearing it,

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.020
but it’s okay, it’s perfectly waterproof.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.560
Unless I go to pool, I don’t really take it off.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.500
You don’t have to worry :&gt;

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:09.920
This is very moisty and it lasts long, so I really recommend this.

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:11.920
Five colors are all pretty.

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:16.780
I think you’ll know it.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:22.100
I used to use TONYMOLY Crystal blusher for long, 
but I bought it newly.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:31.020
There are various matt colors without reddish, 
so it’s good to match with skin color.

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:47.320
I’m worried because some said it breaks easily…

00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:50.680
But I’ll show detailed colors next time.

00:05:57.260 --> 00:05:59.860
Inside of that, there were two sleeping pack.

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:01.860
One is pumpkin pack and the other is ancient pack.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.980
Will I be pumpkin or ancient person after putting it? XD

00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:10.400
I… was really surprised after buying it..

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.860
I thought they were cheating on the size.

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:15.640
Its size is just like my palm.

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:22.080
It’s not even for travel.. I can’t believe it, it’s so small.

00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:41.740
I think you can’t see it well because I applied mascara, but I’ll show.

00:06:51.653 --> 00:06:53.653
Can you see it?

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:56.460
I think it’s similar to the makeup that I did before.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:01.080
Where?

00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:04.100
It’s not that obvious,

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:06.620
but the color blue looks so good.

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:09.520
I think pink is pretty!

00:07:09.520 --> 00:07:11.400
But I can’t see the color well.

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:14.840
I think it will be interesting to do Harlequin makeup with this, right?

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:16.177
(The error is my face)

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:20.560
Anyway, this is the Impulse buying haul for May.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:24.920
Thanks for watching the whole video.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:27.580
And I’ll come back with more interesting and useful contents,

00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.912
bye!
