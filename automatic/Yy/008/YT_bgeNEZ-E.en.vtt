00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:04.309 

now<00:00:02.550> with<00:00:02.790> a<00:00:02.820> reef<00:00:03.090> aquarium<00:00:03.629> these<00:00:03.870> sorts<00:00:04.230> of

00:00:04.309 --> 00:00:04.319 
now with a reef aquarium these sorts of

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:07.309 
now with a reef aquarium these sorts of
dosing<00:00:04.859> pumps<00:00:05.250> are<00:00:05.609> becoming<00:00:06.150> really<00:00:06.839> really

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319 
dosing pumps are becoming really really

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:10.190 
dosing pumps are becoming really really
popular<00:00:07.730> because<00:00:08.730> most<00:00:09.389> people<00:00:09.750> tend<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> go

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
popular because most people tend to go

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.350 
popular because most people tend to go
through<00:00:10.230> phases<00:00:10.710> with<00:00:11.070> their<00:00:11.280> aquarium<00:00:11.700> where

00:00:12.350 --> 00:00:12.360 
through phases with their aquarium where

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:13.789 
through phases with their aquarium where
for<00:00:12.570> three<00:00:12.599> months<00:00:13.110> they<00:00:13.230> look<00:00:13.349> after<00:00:13.710> it

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
for three months they look after it

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.890 
for three months they look after it
really<00:00:14.070> well<00:00:14.250> and<00:00:14.460> maybe<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.450> the<00:00:15.480> next<00:00:15.570> three

00:00:15.890 --> 00:00:15.900 
really well and maybe for the next three

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.870 
really well and maybe for the next three
months<00:00:16.080> or<00:00:16.289> a<00:00:16.350> bit<00:00:16.470> busy<00:00:16.680> or<00:00:16.980> a<00:00:17.070> bit<00:00:17.220> distracted

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
months or a bit busy or a bit distracted

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.970 
months or a bit busy or a bit distracted
and<00:00:18.029> then<00:00:18.810> they<00:00:18.960> don't<00:00:19.199> add<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.560> things<00:00:19.800> they

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
and then they don't add the things they

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.250 
and then they don't add the things they
know<00:00:20.160> they<00:00:20.340> should<00:00:20.609> add<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:21.570> it<00:00:21.900> is<00:00:22.020> much

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
know they should add so it is much

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.160 
know they should add so it is much
natural<00:00:22.650> and<00:00:23.160> better<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:24.180> add<00:00:24.300> small<00:00:24.600> amounts

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
natural and better to add small amounts

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.890 
natural and better to add small amounts
regularly<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.830> your<00:00:26.160> supplements<00:00:26.939> and<00:00:27.119> it

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
regularly of your supplements and it

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.419 
regularly of your supplements and it
means<00:00:28.109> that<00:00:28.439> when<00:00:28.619> you<00:00:28.650> are<00:00:28.949> getting<00:00:29.130> a<00:00:29.279> bit

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
means that when you are getting a bit

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.999 
means that when you are getting a bit
busy<00:00:29.640> bit<00:00:30.570> lazy<00:00:30.810> a<00:00:31.019> bit<00:00:31.199> distracted<00:00:31.769> that<00:00:31.890> at

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
busy bit lazy a bit distracted that at

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.560 
busy bit lazy a bit distracted that at
least<00:00:32.189> your<00:00:32.489> aquarium<00:00:32.730> will<00:00:33.000> have<00:00:33.090> a<00:00:33.120> level<00:00:33.450> of

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:33.570 
least your aquarium will have a level of

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:36.049 
least your aquarium will have a level of
stability<00:00:33.780> to<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.350> but<00:00:35.250> one<00:00:35.399> thing<00:00:35.579> I<00:00:35.670> really

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
stability to it but one thing I really

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:37.729 
stability to it but one thing I really
want<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.270> warn<00:00:36.540> you<00:00:36.660> about<00:00:36.989> these<00:00:37.350> sorts<00:00:37.680> of

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
want to warn you about these sorts of

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.860 
want to warn you about these sorts of
systems<00:00:37.950> is<00:00:38.760> that<00:00:38.820> most<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.390> these<00:00:39.480> products

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
systems is that most of these products

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.680 
systems is that most of these products
are<00:00:40.230> to<00:00:40.440> be<00:00:40.559> added<00:00:40.770> governed<00:00:41.760> by<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.000> levels

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
are to be added governed by the levels

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.500 
are to be added governed by the levels
of<00:00:43.070> either<00:00:44.070> stock<00:00:44.430> in<00:00:44.579> the<00:00:44.670> aquarium<00:00:45.120> or<00:00:45.270> more

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
of either stock in the aquarium or more

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.840 
of either stock in the aquarium or more
so<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> levels<00:00:46.140> that<00:00:46.200> you<00:00:46.350> test<00:00:46.620> say<00:00:47.430> like<00:00:47.640> for

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
so the levels that you test say like for

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
so the levels that you test say like for
example<00:00:47.910> the<00:00:48.360> lithium<00:00:48.750> based<00:00:48.960> products<00:00:49.350> that

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
example the lithium based products that

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.400 
example the lithium based products that
are<00:00:50.370> for<00:00:50.579> getting<00:00:50.760> rid<00:00:50.879> of<00:00:50.910> phosphate

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
are for getting rid of phosphate

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.200 
are for getting rid of phosphate
excellent<00:00:52.410> excellent<00:00:52.739> products<00:00:53.190> but<00:00:53.879> as<00:00:54.030> your

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
excellent excellent products but as your

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.760 
excellent excellent products but as your
phosphate<00:00:54.539> level<00:00:54.809> Falls<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.350> as<00:00:55.440> you<00:00:55.559> don't

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
phosphate level Falls and as you don't

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.350 
phosphate level Falls and as you don't
have<00:00:56.039> not<00:00:56.340> noxious<00:00:56.789> allergies<00:00:57.180> in<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
have not noxious allergies in the

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.709 
have not noxious allergies in the
aquarium<00:00:57.750> you<00:00:58.230> must<00:00:58.559> reduce<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.309> levels<00:00:59.719> same

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
aquarium you must reduce the levels same

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.889 
aquarium you must reduce the levels same
with<00:01:00.930> products<00:01:01.530> like<00:01:01.680> iodine<00:01:01.969> iodine<00:01:02.969> if<00:01:03.600> put

00:01:03.889 --> 00:01:03.899 
with products like iodine iodine if put

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.620 
with products like iodine iodine if put
on<00:01:04.019> a<00:01:04.049> dosing<00:01:04.500> pump<00:01:04.739> must<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.670> put<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.240> a

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
on a dosing pump must be put to a

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.990 
on a dosing pump must be put to a
basically<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.260> minimum<00:01:07.799> level<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.850> you

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
basically a minimum level because you

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.800 
basically a minimum level because you
can<00:01:09.270> overdose<00:01:09.750> these<00:01:10.020> products<00:01:10.439> so<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.810> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
can overdose these products so if the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.950 
can overdose these products so if the
label<00:01:13.200> says<00:01:13.229> 1<00:01:14.100> mil<00:01:14.340> per<00:01:14.549> 100<00:01:14.909> litres<00:01:15.240> would<00:01:15.810> be

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
label says 1 mil per 100 litres would be

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:17.480 
label says 1 mil per 100 litres would be
assuming<00:01:16.350> that's<00:01:16.500> a<00:01:16.619> weekly<00:01:16.860> level

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
assuming that's a weekly level

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.330 
assuming that's a weekly level
so<00:01:18.270> therefore<00:01:18.509> dose<00:01:19.170> that<00:01:19.470> level<00:01:19.860> per<00:01:20.100> week

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
so therefore dose that level per week

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:22.460 
so therefore dose that level per week
not<00:01:20.610> per<00:01:20.850> day<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.360> if<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:22.020> are<00:01:22.200> going<00:01:22.350> to

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
not per day and if you are going to

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.960 
not per day and if you are going to
increase<00:01:22.770> dose<00:01:23.040> you<00:01:23.250> really<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.759> test

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
increase dose you really want to test

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.640 
increase dose you really want to test
items<00:01:24.509> which<00:01:24.659> you<00:01:24.750> can<00:01:24.930> get<00:01:25.080> a<00:01:25.110> testing<00:01:25.500> for

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
items which you can get a testing for

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.580 
items which you can get a testing for
that<00:01:25.680> one<00:01:25.890> then<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:27.390> phosphate<00:01:28.140> group<00:01:28.320> then

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
that one then the phosphate group then

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.920 
that one then the phosphate group then
nitrate<00:01:29.040> removing<00:01:29.460> products<00:01:29.820> same<00:01:30.659> thing

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
nitrate removing products same thing

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.240 
nitrate removing products same thing
you've<00:01:31.140> got<00:01:31.320> to<00:01:31.350> govern<00:01:31.590> your<00:01:31.770> nitrate

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you've got to govern your nitrate

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.850 
you've got to govern your nitrate
removing<00:01:32.700> products<00:01:33.150> by<00:01:33.900> the<00:01:33.960> nitrate<00:01:34.560> level

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
removing products by the nitrate level

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.310 
removing products by the nitrate level
as<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> nitrate<00:01:35.579> increases<00:01:36.090> you<00:01:36.720> can<00:01:36.900> slightly

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
as a nitrate increases you can slightly

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.410 
as a nitrate increases you can slightly
raise<00:01:37.530> these<00:01:37.799> levels<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.369> as<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.909> nitrate

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
raise these levels and as a nitrate

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.230 
raise these levels and as a nitrate
decreases<00:01:40.170> you<00:01:40.320> can<00:01:40.500> slowly<00:01:41.340> decrease<00:01:41.970> these

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
decreases you can slowly decrease these

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.600 
decreases you can slowly decrease these
levels<00:01:42.689> and<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.470> is<00:01:43.500> really<00:01:44.009> important<00:01:44.490> to

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
levels and it is really important to

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:46.670 
levels and it is really important to
start<00:01:44.939> on<00:01:45.180> low<00:01:45.360> doses<00:01:45.869> let<00:01:46.049> the<00:01:46.200> aquarium<00:01:46.619> you

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
start on low doses let the aquarium you

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.980 
start on low doses let the aquarium you
get<00:01:46.799> used<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.040> on<00:01:47.189> low<00:01:47.399> doses<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.299> then<00:01:48.750> with

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
get used to on low doses and then with
