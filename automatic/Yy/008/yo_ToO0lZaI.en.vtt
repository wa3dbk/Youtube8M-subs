and stem cells are combined in the lab
growth<00:00:25.980> factors<00:00:26.519> are<00:00:26.640> added<00:00:26.970> it's<00:00:27.150> then

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
growth factors are added it's then

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.400 
growth factors are added it's then

the breast a blood supply is attached to
feed<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.890> cells<00:00:35.190> in<00:00:35.399> about<00:00:35.640> 6<00:00:36.000> to<00:00:36.180> 12<00:00:36.450> months

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
feed these cells in about 6 to 12 months

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.190 
feed these cells in about 6 to 12 months
that<00:00:37.350> tissue<00:00:37.800> then<00:00:38.270> creates<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.600> form<00:00:39.930> and

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
that tissue then creates the form and

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.040 
that tissue then creates the form and
shape<00:00:40.230> of<00:00:40.680> a<00:00:40.829> breast<00:00:41.300> which<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.629> sounded<00:00:42.989> me

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
shape of a breast which just sounded me

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.180 
shape of a breast which just sounded me
to<00:00:43.170> wrap<00:00:43.350> your<00:00:43.469> head<00:00:43.620> around<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:43.950> sounds

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
to wrap your head around that sounds

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.340 
to wrap your head around that sounds
amazing<00:00:44.700> what<00:00:45.090> type<00:00:45.239> of<00:00:45.270> stem<00:00:45.690> cells<00:00:46.020> are<00:00:46.260> we

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
amazing what type of stem cells are we

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.600 
amazing what type of stem cells are we
talking<00:00:46.649> about<00:00:46.710> well<00:00:46.890> we<00:00:47.010> hear<00:00:47.190> about<00:00:47.219> stem

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
talking about well we hear about stem

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.010 
talking about well we hear about stem
cells<00:00:47.820> all<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.120> time<00:00:48.329> and<00:00:48.480> they're<00:00:48.600> found<00:00:48.870> in

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
cells all the time and they're found in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.720 
cells all the time and they're found in
a<00:00:49.110> variety<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.649> sources<00:00:49.739> they<00:00:50.280> can<00:00:50.430> be<00:00:50.550> found

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
a variety of sources they can be found

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.430 
a variety of sources they can be found
in<00:00:50.910> embryos<00:00:51.420> they<00:00:51.629> can<00:00:51.750> also<00:00:51.899> be<00:00:52.020> found<00:00:52.260> an

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
in embryos they can also be found an

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.709 
in embryos they can also be found an
umbilical<00:00:52.949> cord<00:00:53.190> blood<00:00:53.219> and<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.969> our<00:00:54.090> own<00:00:54.270> bone

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
umbilical cord blood and in our own bone

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.510 
umbilical cord blood and in our own bone
marrow<00:00:55.020> and<00:00:55.289> what<00:00:55.710> makes<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.309> powerful

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
marrow and what makes them so powerful

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.549 
marrow and what makes them so powerful
as<00:00:56.910> these<00:00:57.090> are<00:00:57.270> naive<00:00:57.690> cells<00:00:58.050> that<00:00:58.289> can<00:00:58.410> then

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
as these are naive cells that can then

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.130 
as these are naive cells that can then
go<00:00:58.859> on<00:00:59.039> to<00:00:59.340> become<00:00:59.550> almost<00:01:00.149> anything<00:01:00.809> and

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
go on to become almost anything and

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.750 
go on to become almost anything and
that's<00:01:01.440> what's<00:01:01.770> so<00:01:01.949> important<00:01:02.489> so<00:01:02.609> you're

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
that's what's so important so you're

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.759 
that's what's so important so you're
essentially<00:01:02.969> training<00:01:03.480> them<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.629> turn<00:01:03.930> in<00:01:04.199> to

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
essentially training them to turn in to

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.980 
essentially training them to turn in to
rest<00:01:05.040> exactly<00:01:05.580> prior<00:01:06.270> to<00:01:06.299> this<00:01:06.630> what<00:01:06.840> most

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
rest exactly prior to this what most

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.149 
rest exactly prior to this what most
women<00:01:07.140> if<00:01:07.470> they<00:01:07.500> were<00:01:07.650> going<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:07.920> have

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
women if they were going to have

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.310 
women if they were going to have
reconstructive<00:01:08.850> surgery<00:01:09.299> it<00:01:09.630> would<00:01:10.080> involve

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
reconstructive surgery it would involve

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.590 
reconstructive surgery it would involve
something<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.430> an<00:01:11.549> implant<00:01:12.000> this<00:01:12.360> is<00:01:12.420> a

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
something with an implant this is a

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.510 
something with an implant this is a
little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> different<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.470> sounds<00:01:14.070> great<00:01:14.189> but

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
little bit different it sounds great but

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.219 
little bit different it sounds great but
part<00:01:14.700> of<00:01:14.729> it<00:01:14.820> sounds<00:01:15.090> almost<00:01:15.210> good<00:01:15.570> to<00:01:15.689> be<00:01:15.780> too

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
part of it sounds almost good to be too

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.539 
part of it sounds almost good to be too
good<00:01:16.350> to<00:01:16.470> be<00:01:16.590> true<00:01:16.619> correct<00:01:17.100> and<00:01:17.340> there<00:01:17.430> are

00:01:17.539 --> 00:01:17.549 
good to be true correct and there are

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:19.160 
good to be true correct and there are
always<00:01:17.729> caveats<00:01:18.330> here<00:01:18.420> one<00:01:18.720> important<00:01:19.140> thing

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
always caveats here one important thing

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.270 
always caveats here one important thing
though<00:01:19.380> Erica's<00:01:19.770> a<00:01:19.799> lot<00:01:20.040> of<00:01:20.159> women

unfortunately aren't even offered
options<00:01:22.500> about<00:01:22.770> reconstruction<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.610> this

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
options about reconstruction so this

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.760 
options about reconstruction so this
really<00:01:24.030> needs<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.330> reopen<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:25.020> dialogue<00:01:25.590> in

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
really needs to reopen that dialogue in

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.130 
really needs to reopen that dialogue in
terms<00:01:26.310> of<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> drawbacks<00:01:26.820> at<00:01:27.180> this<00:01:27.390> time<00:01:27.630> that

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
terms of the drawbacks at this time that

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.020 
terms of the drawbacks at this time that
we<00:01:28.320> spoke<00:01:28.500> to<00:01:28.560> two<00:01:28.890> experts<00:01:29.430> yesterday<00:01:29.880> and

we spoke to two experts yesterday and

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.510 
we spoke to two experts yesterday and
they<00:01:30.180> really<00:01:30.540> told<00:01:30.810> me<00:01:30.960> the<00:01:31.110> big<00:01:31.409> concern<00:01:31.979> here

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
they really told me the big concern here

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.090 
they really told me the big concern here
is<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.700> as<00:01:33.299> this<00:01:33.720> tissue<00:01:34.079> and<00:01:34.409> this<00:01:34.530> fat<00:01:34.799> cell

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
is that as this tissue and this fat cell

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.160 
is that as this tissue and this fat cell
is<00:01:35.280> being<00:01:35.520> stimulated<00:01:35.880> with<00:01:36.210> growth<00:01:36.509> factors

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
is being stimulated with growth factors

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.380 
is being stimulated with growth factors
to<00:01:37.590> grow<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.009> develop<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.759> concern<00:01:39.180> is<00:01:39.360> that

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
to grow and develop the concern is that

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
cells so right now in this country this

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.590 
cells so right now in this country this
is<00:01:43.829> not<00:01:44.070> FDA<00:01:44.520> approved<00:01:44.640> there<00:01:45.240> are<00:01:45.390> no

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
very hopeful that in the next five years

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.660 
very hopeful that in the next five years
we<00:01:52.170> can<00:01:52.350> see<00:01:52.530> this<00:01:52.680> being<00:01:53.189> done<00:01:53.280> in<00:01:53.520> this

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:53.670 
we can see this being done in this

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:54.740 
we can see this being done in this
country<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.030> sounds<00:01:54.360> actually<00:01:54.479> like<00:01:54.720> a

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
country that sounds actually like a

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.330 
country that sounds actually like a
fairly<00:01:54.990> short<00:01:55.229> period<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.710> time<00:01:55.770> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.219> next

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
fairly short period of time in the next

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.800 
fairly short period of time in the next
five<00:01:56.640> years<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.119> could<00:01:57.240> be<00:01:57.360> correct<00:01:57.689> and

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
five years that it could be correct and

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.959 
five years that it could be correct and
it's<00:01:58.200> being<00:01:58.439> done<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.619> now<00:01:58.799> in<00:01:59.369> various

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's being done right now in various

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.819 
it's being done right now in various
countries<00:02:00.240> including<00:02:01.200> this<00:02:01.320> one<00:02:01.560> for

cosmetic reasons also important for

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.020 
cosmetic reasons also important for
women<00:02:04.860> with<00:02:04.979> breast<00:02:05.100> cancer<00:02:05.280> sometimes<00:02:05.909> they

women with breast cancer sometimes they

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.580 
women with breast cancer sometimes they
have<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.360> cancer<00:02:06.719> removed<00:02:07.049> with<00:02:07.259> a<00:02:07.290> little

have that cancer removed with a little

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.949 
have that cancer removed with a little
lumpectomy<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.670> also<00:02:09.000> can<00:02:09.450> create<00:02:09.810> a

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
lumpectomy that also can create a

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.080 
lumpectomy that also can create a
cosmetic<00:02:10.590> defect<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.400> there<00:02:11.550> are<00:02:11.580> multiple
