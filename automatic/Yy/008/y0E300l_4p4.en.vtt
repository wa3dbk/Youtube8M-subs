00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:48.200 
under they see two connections run it

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:49.270 
under they see two connections run it
down<00:02:48.320> and<00:02:48.500> maybe<00:02:48.620> like<00:02:48.770> some<00:02:48.920> tygon<00:02:49.250> tubing

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
down and maybe like some tygon tubing

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.620 
down and maybe like some tygon tubing
down<00:02:50.000> to<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.150> gas<00:02:50.330> can<00:02:50.660> whatever<00:02:51.650> you<00:02:51.830> got<00:02:51.920> to<00:02:51.950> do

down to a gas can whatever you got to do

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.670 
down to a gas can whatever you got to do
but<00:02:53.630> there's<00:02:53.810> too<00:02:53.959> little<00:02:53.989> spring<00:02:54.410> clips

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
but there's too little spring clips

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.160 
but there's too little spring clips
there<00:02:55.280> already<00:02:55.400> pull<00:02:56.239> down<00:02:56.450> for<00:02:56.720> here<00:02:56.900> but<00:02:57.080> you

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
there already pull down for here but you

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.930 
there already pull down for here but you
can<00:02:57.290> see<00:02:57.440> right<00:02:57.890> here<00:02:57.920> what's<00:02:58.760> at<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.910> top

00:02:58.930 --> 00:02:58.940 
can see right here what's at the top

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:02.020 
can see right here what's at the top
obviously<00:02:59.450> you<00:03:00.110> don't<00:03:00.230> do<00:03:00.500> those<00:03:00.910> and<00:03:01.910> you

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:02.030 
obviously you don't do those and you

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:07.000 
obviously you don't do those and you
pull<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.360> tubes<00:03:02.570> off<00:03:03.910> just<00:03:04.910> like<00:03:05.060> so<00:03:05.120> I<00:03:06.019> said

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
pull the tubes off just like so I said

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.050 
pull the tubes off just like so I said
you're<00:03:07.160> now<00:03:07.250> you're<00:03:07.310> gonna<00:03:07.430> have<00:03:07.519> gas<00:03:07.760> coming

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:08.060 
you're now you're gonna have gas coming

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.680 
you're now you're gonna have gas coming
out<00:03:08.180> of<00:03:08.300> these<00:03:08.360> two<00:03:08.950> two<00:03:09.950> plugs<00:03:10.700> connections

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:11.690 
out of these two two plugs connections

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.650 
out of these two two plugs connections
right<00:03:11.870> here<00:03:12.220> but<00:03:13.220> also<00:03:13.370> guess<00:03:14.300> what<00:03:14.540> we

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
right here but also guess what we

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.410 
right here but also guess what we
spewing<00:03:14.930> out<00:03:15.080> of<00:03:15.140> these<00:03:15.320> these<00:03:15.650> tubes<00:03:16.420> going

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:17.420 
spewing out of these these tubes going

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:19.479 
spewing out of these these tubes going
down<00:03:17.540> to<00:03:17.630> the<00:03:17.720> engine<00:03:17.840> so<00:03:18.250> make<00:03:19.250> sure<00:03:19.280> you

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:19.489 
down to the engine so make sure you

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:20.920 
down to the engine so make sure you
count<00:03:19.610> for<00:03:19.790> those<00:03:19.910> two<00:03:20.120> you<00:03:20.209> just<00:03:20.480> the<00:03:20.630> biggest

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:20.930 
count for those two you just the biggest

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:22.960 
count for those two you just the biggest
thing<00:03:21.080> is<00:03:21.200> just<00:03:21.230> get<00:03:21.470> a<00:03:21.500> big<00:03:21.680> funnel<00:03:21.950> again<00:03:22.580> for

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
thing is just get a big funnel again for

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:25.630 
thing is just get a big funnel again for
those<00:03:23.090> two<00:03:23.330> and<00:03:23.570> then<00:03:23.660> put<00:03:23.959> the<00:03:24.050> hose<00:03:24.200> in<00:03:24.640> until

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:25.640 
those two and then put the hose in until

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.170 
those two and then put the hose in until
it<00:03:25.700> starts<00:03:25.940> coming<00:03:26.090> down

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:32.180 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.140 

at<00:03:32.959> that<00:03:33.170> point<00:03:33.519> you<00:03:34.519> should<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.790> good<00:03:34.940> to<00:03:35.030> take

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
at that point you should be good to take

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:44.440 
at that point you should be good to take
the<00:03:35.269> whole<00:03:35.420> tank<00:03:35.629> off<00:03:42.849> comes<00:03:43.849> off<00:03:44.060> just<00:03:44.299> like

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
the whole tank off comes off just like

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.530 
the whole tank off comes off just like
so<00:03:45.760> so<00:03:48.190> instead<00:03:49.190> of<00:03:49.250> GN<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.579> cheated

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:50.540 
so so instead of GN I cheated

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:53.350 
so so instead of GN I cheated
I<00:03:50.569> already<00:03:51.170> split<00:03:51.560> gas<00:03:51.769> over<00:03:52.159> E<00:03:52.190> so<00:03:52.549> just<00:03:53.239> be

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:53.360 
I already split gas over E so just be

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.539 
I already split gas over E so just be
careful<00:03:53.510> take<00:03:54.500> your<00:03:54.620> time

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
careful take your time

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.860 
careful take your time
I<00:03:55.579> have<00:03:55.970> something<00:03:56.180> to<00:03:56.269> catch<00:03:56.420> it<00:03:56.569> all<00:03:56.629> and<00:03:56.810> you

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
I have something to catch it all and you

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:00.879 
I have something to catch it all and you
should<00:03:57.019> be<00:03:57.110> good<00:03:57.260> so<00:03:57.700> that's<00:03:58.700> it
