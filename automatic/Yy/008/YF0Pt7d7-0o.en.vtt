00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:22.760 
so it's like maybe maybe some people

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.610 
so it's like maybe maybe some people
getting<00:01:23.030> on<00:01:23.120> restless<00:01:23.570> and<00:01:23.720> with<00:01:23.840> the<00:01:23.990> economy

and things like that have to think about

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.780 
and things like that have to think about
that<00:01:26.960> bad<00:01:27.350> I<00:01:28.060> think<00:01:29.060> it'll<00:01:29.270> be<00:01:29.300> okay<00:01:29.930> I<00:01:29.960> just

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
that bad I think it'll be okay I just

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:33.640 
that bad I think it'll be okay I just
when<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.940> solves<00:01:32.240> everything<00:01:32.480> we'll<00:01:33.410> worry<00:01:33.590> a

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
when it solves everything we'll worry a

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.050 
when it solves everything we'll worry a
little<00:01:33.800> worried<00:01:34.160> what<00:01:34.310> you<00:01:34.430> saw<00:01:34.580> Saturday

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
little worried what you saw Saturday

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.300 
little worried what you saw Saturday
night<00:01:35.240> though<00:01:35.420> a<00:01:35.750> little<00:01:36.650> bit<00:01:36.890> i<00:01:36.920> didn't<00:01:37.190> see

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
night though a little bit i didn't see

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.090 
night though a little bit i didn't see
all<00:01:37.460> the<00:01:37.640> game<00:01:37.850> but<00:01:38.150> I<00:01:38.870> was<00:01:39.620> hoping<00:01:39.740> that<00:01:39.920> the

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100 
all the game but I was hoping that the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.500 
all the game but I was hoping that the
office<00:01:40.400> of<00:01:40.520> wine<00:01:40.760> would<00:01:41.030> probably<00:01:41.390> be<00:01:41.480> a

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
office of wine would probably be a

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:44.650 
office of wine would probably be a
strong<00:01:41.990> point<00:01:42.410> but<00:01:42.880> we<00:01:43.880> would<00:01:44.030> really<00:01:44.270> have<00:01:44.360> to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
strong point but we would really have to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.080 
strong point but we would really have to
see<00:01:44.870> a<00:01:45.440> little<00:01:46.190> bit<00:01:46.280> disappointing<00:01:46.850> yet<00:01:46.940> cuz

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.090 
see a little bit disappointing yet cuz

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.190 
see a little bit disappointing yet cuz
often<00:01:47.450> should<00:01:47.570> have<00:01:47.690> been<00:01:47.780> able<00:01:47.900> to<00:01:47.990> score<00:01:48.140> a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
often should have been able to score a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.990 
often should have been able to score a
touchdown<00:01:48.440> right<00:01:48.740> I<00:01:48.830> just<00:01:49.160> don't<00:01:49.340> understand

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:50.000 
touchdown right I just don't understand

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.850 
touchdown right I just don't understand
but<00:01:50.540> they<00:01:50.630> can<00:01:50.780> put<00:01:50.930> it<00:01:51.050> a<00:01:51.170> decent<00:01:51.470> drive

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:51.860 
but they can put it a decent drive

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.770 
but they can put it a decent drive
together<00:01:52.040> did<00:01:52.850> you<00:01:52.970> did<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.450> see<00:01:53.660> any

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
together did you did you see any

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.430 
together did you did you see any
positives<00:01:54.290> come<00:01:54.470> out<00:01:54.590> of<00:01:54.740> it<00:01:54.880> I<00:01:55.880> think<00:01:56.630> the<00:01:56.810> the

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
positives come out of it I think the the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.010 
positives come out of it I think the the
alarm<00:01:57.770> back<00:01:57.920> of<00:01:58.100> play<00:01:58.280> was<00:01:58.460> okay<00:01:58.790> pretty<00:01:59.120> solid

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
alarm back of play was okay pretty solid

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.890 
alarm back of play was okay pretty solid
for<00:02:00.229> what<00:02:00.350> I<00:02:00.380> seen<00:02:00.710> I<00:02:01.510> look<00:02:02.510> like<00:02:02.690> the

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
for what I seen I look like the

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.930 
for what I seen I look like the
cornerbacks<00:02:03.590> might<00:02:03.800> be<00:02:03.979> okay<00:02:04.280> and<00:02:04.430> I<00:02:04.490> think

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
cornerbacks might be okay and I think

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.280 
cornerbacks might be okay and I think
some<00:02:05.090> workers<00:02:05.330> are<00:02:05.450> going<00:02:05.570> to<00:02:05.660> step<00:02:05.840> up<00:02:05.990> I<00:02:06.110> like

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:06.290 
some workers are going to step up I like

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.530 
some workers are going to step up I like
the<00:02:06.440> guy<00:02:06.560> Davis<00:02:07.040> remember<00:02:07.760> I<00:02:07.910> back<00:02:08.119> dangerous

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
we will see but I really think the

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.320 
we will see but I really think the
offensive<00:02:19.510> line<00:02:19.690> should<00:02:20.440> be<00:02:21.220> one<00:02:21.700> of<00:02:21.820> our<00:02:21.940> own

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.330 
offensive line should be one of our own

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.680 
offensive line should be one of our own
funds<00:02:22.690> I<00:02:22.960> think<00:02:23.290> you<00:02:23.410> got<00:02:23.530> her<00:02:24.390> so<00:02:25.390> far<00:02:25.600> you

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
like how man genius handling everything

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.760
