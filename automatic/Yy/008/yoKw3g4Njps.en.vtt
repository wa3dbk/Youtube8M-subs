too<00:02:32.670> which<00:02:33.270> is<00:02:33.300> kind<00:02:33.750> of<00:02:33.840> strange<00:02:34.080> that<00:02:34.350> they

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
too which is kind of strange that they

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:35.990 
too which is kind of strange that they
would<00:02:34.530> put<00:02:34.770> that<00:02:34.920> ipod<00:02:35.340> touch<00:02:35.550> because<00:02:35.850> it

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
would put that ipod touch because it

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.960 
would put that ipod touch because it
first<00:02:36.810> one<00:02:37.050> didn't<00:02:37.350> have<00:02:37.550> buttons<00:02:38.550> along<00:02:38.790> the

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:38.970 
first one didn't have buttons along the

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.960 
first one didn't have buttons along the
side<00:02:39.210> so<00:02:39.540> why<00:02:40.140> would<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.440> do<00:02:40.620> this<00:02:40.850> well<00:02:41.850> it's

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
side so why would it do this well it's

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.430 
side so why would it do this well it's
because<00:02:42.270> they<00:02:42.420> took<00:02:42.600> the<00:02:42.750> firmware<00:02:43.110> off<00:02:43.290> of

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
because they took the firmware off of

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.070 
because they took the firmware off of
the<00:02:43.530> iphone<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.250> sometimes<00:02:45.210> they<00:02:45.630> keep<00:02:45.870> some

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
the iphone and sometimes they keep some

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.570 
the iphone and sometimes they keep some
of<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.230> iphone<00:02:46.560> features<00:02:46.770> but<00:02:47.190> they<00:02:47.340> try<00:02:47.520> to

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:47.580 
of the iphone features but they try to

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.020 
of the iphone features but they try to
hide<00:02:47.820> them<00:02:48.060> so<00:02:48.990> well<00:02:49.500> now<00:02:49.650> the<00:02:50.010> new<00:02:50.220> one<00:02:50.460> has
