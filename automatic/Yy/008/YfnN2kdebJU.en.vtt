00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 hi how am i doing this little 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 and short video tutorial for those who 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.880
 want to play the driver you ask online 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.620
 let's say I got tired of receiving so many 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.690
 questions of how and where I play by 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.000
 internet what terminally did I do this 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.109
 video the first thing they have to do is 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.270
 go to the www.grammy.com page 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.570
 download the program they give accept to 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.570
 all 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:35.020
 we are itching to create a new account 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:37.149
 and then we skip this step because to 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.380
 we are not interested in entering any 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:41.780
 code 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.240
 then we enter our email and 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.890
 the password must enter an email 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:49.990
 that they are using because it requires 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.990
 confirmation of the account to activate it 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.860
 then we put some no me and 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:03.110
 below we put our real name though 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:05.330
 if they want they put whatever and then 

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:07.430
 we mark the country where we are from 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.620
 in my case Argentina and then we give 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.410
 next and then there the mail 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.910
 I should get to our box 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.729
 I recommend that you register with normal or 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.530
 with mail with yahoo sometimes brings delay 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.920
 in getting the activation email from 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.920
 account 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.950
 and well this is my gamer yesterday here you see 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.990
 in the list of all the games in 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.990
 reality of all available rooms 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:43.890
 and this is a member of my hollande plan 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.890
 ha ha ha ha ha ha 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.679
 I recommend ordering them in the my option 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.200
 Ghanaians that are the games that each 

00:01:50.679 --> 00:01:55.719
 have on your computer 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.670
 and I also recommend ordering the rooms 

00:01:55.719 --> 00:01:59.649
 in order because the rooms that have 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.920
 green ball are those that are already 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:04.689
 playing and you can not get one and to 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.640
 play you just have to stick 

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:08.950
 some room and wait for the 2 

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.090
 start the game the oste is the first 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.360
 of the list 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.010
 damn nandu you are ballbreaker i am 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.780
 jajajajajajajaja and well well decide them 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.000
 start the game and play what 

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.370
 says in the description of each oster in 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.739
 this case is a harry rpg scenario 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.630
 potter although there is also wow Pablo 

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:28.239
 green arabia black forest blah blah blah 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:30.069
 blah blah and that's the program that 

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.079
 the clan breezemax tuzsa to play in 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.750
 internet at the age of empires the conqueror 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:37.209
 I recommend you because it is very 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:39.190
 well pretty simple the program does not 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.560
 requires no type of update 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.660
 as often happens in other programs not 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.099
 there is a lot of lab and if there is a game 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.799
 because one of those who plays has 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:50.230
 open web pages there is a lot of variety 

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:52.599
 of very beginner player levels 

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.860
 average players and pretty players 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:56.019
 good ones 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:59.709
 in addition there is no limitation of versions 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:03:00.280
 one can play in 10 and 100 as his 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.670
 can you 

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:06.430
 more than 200 games as the dota mythology 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.350
 fifa et cetera etcetera in synthesis gamer 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:10.840
 and her is a very simple program 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:13.270
 use easy to understand with players in 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:15.370
 every moment day night night and with 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:16.930
 a single click one may already be playing 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.940
 without needing to go in search of 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:21.640
 iu address or opening ports in 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:24.150
 the router good that was all greetings to 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.150
