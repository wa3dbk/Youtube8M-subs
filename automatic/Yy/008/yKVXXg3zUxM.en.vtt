 hello youtube friends my name is 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:10.980
 carlos 704 and in this tutorial I come to you 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:13.679
 to teach how to change a key that does not 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.990
 work for another this through the 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.779
 keyboard configuration previously 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:20.600
 I had uploaded a video a few years ago 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.200
 but then 

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:26.480
 now I upload another one with a mega link 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.280
 good in the description of the video them 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.630
 I'll leave a mega link in which to 

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:34.160
 download it 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:38.170
 will generate a rar file like this 

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.170
 we right click and extract it 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:44.350
 will be generated this small file that 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.600
 called kid week that has installed the 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.280
 program that we occupy then we're going 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.530
 to execute 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:54.399
 we give him yes 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:56.739
 and here we give green instant and 

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.180
 We wait for it to be installed as you see it 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.839
 install in a very easy way and let's go 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:05.890
 to close once installed this program 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:10.050
 we will come to here to our folder 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:13.380
 root or we 'll go to the local disk ce 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:16.920
 after this we will go to where it says 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.920
 program files 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:25.210
 and here 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:28.590
 and well I think it's really here in 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:31.899
 where they say fractious cache file 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.619
 x86 program that the architecture of 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:38.770
 32 bits and we look for the one that says here you 

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:42.090
 here it is and we execute what comes 

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.090
 being the point s 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:48.990
 Well, once this is done, we'll say yes 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:52.750
 and the following interface will appear 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.460
 good to change the key that no longer 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:59.240
 serves us through configuration leo 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:03.540
 selection says hastings mode and 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:07.770
 scanner 5 that we are going to use 

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.920
 let's press a key that never 

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:13.910
 use that we do not use for example the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:16.770
 Start key with the page base key 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:18.240
 we give you in scan and pressed by 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.720
 example the start key and it's going to 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.220
 mark here where it says destination that 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.900
 let's put the key that we already 

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.360
 works for example if I no longer 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.250
 the space key works here we are going to 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.250
 put the key 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.470
 well let's say I do not work the back 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:41.880
 space then we are going to give you here the 

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:43.290
 back space and once this is done what 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.740
 is going to do the program is it going to 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.600
 change the page feed key to 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:50.880
 bach the space that is already us 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.220
 it works then we are going to click on 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.270
 row 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.830
 Once this is done, we will give 

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:02.050
 click on upl and it will ask us to restart 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:04.630
 the computer and we will say yes and 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.430
 here I will not do it because then my 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.290
 keyboard works correctly but in 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:09.970
 some time also happened to me and that's why 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.820
 was the need to use this 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.380
 good program as you can see the 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:17.380
 program works in a very 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.150
 simple if you have any doubt do not forget 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:23.350
 do not hesitate to post it in the comments 

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:26.130
 of the video and well this was all and 

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.130
 thank you
