00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:03.569
 chapter 11 

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.709
 Then I was given a rod similar to a yardstick and I was told 

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:14.900
 get up and measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.060
 but the courtyard that is outside the temple leave it aside and you do not look at it because it has 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.239
 been handed over to the Gentiles 

00:00:24.239 --> 00:00:27.769
 and they will forget the holy city 42 months 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.880
 tour of friendly witnesses who deepen for a thousand 260 days 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.580
 dressed as civilians 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.430
 these witnesses are the two olive trees 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.500
 and the two candlesticks that stand before the god of the earth 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.380
 if some wants to harm the fire comes out of the mouth of god and devours their 

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:55.480
 enemies 

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.130
 and if anyone wants to hurt them 

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:01.130
 he must die in the same way 

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.080
 these have power to close heaven so that it is not new in the days of 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.820
 your profession 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.970
 and they have power over the waters to turn them into blood and to hurt the 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.970
 earth with every plague as many times as you want 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.280
 when they have finished their testimony 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.460
 the beast that climbs from the abyss to war against them and will overcome them and the 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.510
 rooms 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:36.640
 and their corpses will be in the plaza of the big cities that the sense 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.520
 spiritual is called sodoma and egypt 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.520
 where also our Lord was crucified 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.679
 and those of the peoples, tribes, languages ​​and nations 

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.670
 perán their corpses for three and a half days 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:54.670
 and will not allow them to be buried 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.939
 and the inhabitants of the earth will rejoice over them and rejoice 

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:04.620
 they say they were gifts to each other 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:08.880
 because these two prophets had tormented the inhabitants of the earth 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:14.659
 but after three and a half days 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:19.749
 the spirit of life sent by God entered them and they rose 

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:20.859
 his feet 

00:02:20.859 --> 00:02:23.859
 picallo great fear about those who saw them 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.150
 and they fled a great power in what their life told them each 

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:34.209
 and they went up to heaven in a cloud 

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:37.209
 and their enemies saw them 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:45.419
 in that hour there was a great earthquake nor a tenth of the city was 

00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:49.489
 collapsed and by the earthquake the number of seven thousand men died 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.040
 the others were terrified they lived glory of god of heaven 

00:02:58.669 --> 00:03:00.619
 the second there is step 

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.619
 here is the third and has soon 

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:10.509
 the seventh art in the head 

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:14.949
 during the rally those who decide the kingdoms of the world have had 

00:03:14.949 --> 00:03:17.919
 make our lord jesus christ 

00:03:17.919 --> 00:03:20.919
 and he will reign for ever and ever 

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:28.029
 and the 24 elders who were sitting before God on their thrones 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:32.040
 they fell on their faces and worshiped God saying 

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:38.109
 we thank you almighty god Lord who are you and who was like that 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:42.419
 that you have to come because you have taken with great power and azuei nado 

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:48.229
 says the nations helped and your anger has come and the time to judge the 

00:03:48.229 --> 00:03:52.419
 dead and give the reward to your servant his prophets 

00:03:52.419 --> 00:03:57.969
 to the saints and those who fear your name to the little ones and the great ones and 

00:03:57.969 --> 00:04:00.969
 destroy those who destroy the earth 

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:13.929
 and the temple of God was opened in the sky and in arauca of its pact it was seen 

00:04:13.929 --> 00:04:15.079
 in the temple 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:18.609
 and there were lightning thunder voices 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.220
 an earthquake literally in the south
