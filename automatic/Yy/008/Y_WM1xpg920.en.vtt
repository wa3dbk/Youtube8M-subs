 of their exoterres reptiles before a 

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:12.040
 mixture of seeds for 

00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:14.590
 the feeding of tortoises and 

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:17.770
 reptiles ivory grass kind iguana

 pogonat there are seeds of truce 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:24.279

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.789
 of the pond in short a good mix well 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:30.429
 varied that loves going up to Ghana and my 

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:32.730
 turtle in this video I'm going to you 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:35.739
 show how to sow the seeds and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:38.739
 to get an almost unlimited source 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.770
 Reptile food important 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.870
 if they wanted to sow outdoors worth 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.410
 better do it between March and 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.840
 October 

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.910
 hardware level for not much on 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.739
 needs a pierced plastic tray 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:52.930
 in the background you can do the 

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:54.910
 find even if it's ever for 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.739
 avoid any excess in the back and that is 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.840
 to run the roots indeed 

00:00:56.739 --> 00:01:01.120
 really the loss of plants so this 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.659
 to avoid dirtying everything and 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:06.520
 recover the excess water a lid 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:09.479
 transparent to protect your seeds 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.479
 while she manages 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:16.040
 potting soil I took some 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:18.920
 special green plants anyway are 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.690
 the weeds so at that 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.620
 will push her anything that will push 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.560
 even very well on 

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:26.510
 as in addition there is a fertilizer of 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:29.180
 time so it's a door and the gremm 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.240
 testud mix and finally a little 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.250
 water sprayers 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.450
 so for a start we will put the 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.450
 potting soil in the tray 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.009
 we spread everything correctly 

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.979
 then I take my seeds and jeans 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.810
 are everywhere on the surface should not 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.000
 not planting them in the land it takes 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.869
 just and deposited on the surface of 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.869
 simply potting soil 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.010
 finally concerning watering one does not 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.780
 changes the surface of the earth and 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.209
 seeds using a sprayer 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.599
 you must not soggy the earth 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:33.060
 just have to moisten it well 

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:35.209
 do not use a watering can for the 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.480
 just right the sprayer has to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:41.489
 really it's just wet 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.890
 then we would have to change the 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:48.239
 third day then the fifth day 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.250
 after once the plants have 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:55.280
 well managed but grow well at this time 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:58.170
 there you can use a watering can 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:01.620
 during germination, care must be taken 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.209
 put the protective cover and to 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.849
 pass the tray in a bright place 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:08.160
 but can especially no direct sun 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:10.769
 otherwise everything will crame finally everything is going 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:13.579
 to dry up is bad 

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.560
 so at a place well the middle 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:19.560
 so here is the ferry that I use since 

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:21.360
 several months it has grown well so 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.670
 to be able to feed your rest 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:26.850
 just a pair of scissors and 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:28.829
 cut the leaves must not miss 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.630
 to pull the plants by cons must 

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:32.989
 just cut off the top and it will repel 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.989
 very quickly 

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:41.360
