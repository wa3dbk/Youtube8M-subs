Hi, my name is Hina Khan.

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:10.750
And I earned my Bachelor's Degree in Business
Administration with a specialization in Human

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.580
Resource Management in the College of Business
and Management at DeVry University.&nbsp;

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.939
Human resource management basically is anywhere
from the hiring process, which starts with

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:26.099
recruiting, up to training and development,
succession plans.&nbsp;

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:33.690
Some of the courses in our Human Resources
Management curriculum include Strategic Staffing,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.550
Compensation, Employment Law, Benefits, and
Training and Development.&nbsp;

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:46.039
One of the courses taken in the Human Resources
Management specialization was Labor Relations.

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:51.010
In Labor Relations, you learn everything relevant
to the unions, what their impact was in the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.679
marketplace as well as the environment you're
working in professionally speaking, and all

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:59.210
the way towards the current state of the unions
as well.&nbsp;

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:04.479
One of my favorites of the classes I'm taking
right now is Human Resources Information System,

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.450
commonly known as HRIS.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.890
And basically, what this is is the technical
side of HR-- the payroll, the recruiting,

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:18.869
the applicant tracking systems, everything
that deals with training the person with technology.&nbsp;

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.640
Within those functions, you are the forefront
of helping the company grow strategically

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.799
speaking as well as bringing in new talent
into the company.&nbsp;

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:34.040
So we believe in a well-rounded education,
teaching the soft skills that our leaders

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.210
are going to need in the workplace, but also
making sure that they understand the various

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.890
laws that apply to business.&nbsp;

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:45.299
Since I've been at DeVry University, I have
had a lot of professors that have helped me

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.320
along the path.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.570
When I first started, it had been some years.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:55.550
The professors were there to help me understand
what the laws were pertaining to human resource

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.550
management.&nbsp;

00:01:56.550 --> 00:02:02.560
If you ever have any questions, you know they
are there to support you, be that rock of

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.360
asking for things and kind of assisting along
the way, so you feel like you are progressing

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.080
along in the academic as well as career-related
skills too.&nbsp;

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.440
As far as landing a job, with my education
from DeVry, I am very confident.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:23.620
I have heard numerous times that people want
Devry University students because we learn

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:26.690
from day one how to do it, when to do it,
and to do it right.&nbsp;

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.580
I felt really, really prepared after graduation.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.459
I was able to obtain a position right before
graduation, actually.&nbsp;

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.730
I'm excited for the graduation because we
have worked very hard at DeVry in order to

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.230
achieve our goals.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:45.420
Now, you get to go out into the corporate
world and take all the good DeVry training

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.780
and say, OK, here I am.
