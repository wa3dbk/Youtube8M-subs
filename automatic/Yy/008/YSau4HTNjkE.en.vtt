00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:03.379
 The moon is old 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:04.979
 At least it seems so, 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.280
 Since all that is covered is the rubble of scattered rocks 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.860
 And holes and signs formed by the collision of old asteroids. 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.220
 We know that rocks on Earth are affected by weather, 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.660
 Those meteorites made some huge scratches over the years 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:21.939
 But the Earth today seems reasonably small and modern without protracted holes. 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:28.299
 The earth owes its youthful appearance to the fact that its outer surface is constantly self-renewing; its age is hidden. 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:31.680
 New rocks infiltrate the planet's surface from the volcanic crater. 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.660
 Deposits are deposited in the cracks of the ocean floor and then cooled to become part of the chamber, 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.700
 Rocks turn and be mountains when continents collide, 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.820
 The seabed is recycled when continents move through it. 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.620
 The process of re-making the rock does not only make it look modern but makes it as well 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.900
 At least for us, because our best tools for determining the age of rocks 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:52.689
 Measure the decay of some radioactive elements in the rock. 

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:57.260
 When the rock melts and is rebuilt, all evidence of decay is destroyed. 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:02.580
 Often this is great! Because it means that the rock bears its life record, since the time it formed. 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:05.940
 For example, we can say that the ocean floor spreads because 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.260
 Modern rocks are close to the mid-ocean diffraction 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:10.320
 And gradually become older whenever you go towards land, 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.260
 Where they are often recycled by submerging submersibles. 

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.740
 However, because the earth is re-making its rocks a lot, 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:18.420
 Because the re-making of the rocks sets the clock back, 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.260
 It is difficult to look too far to the history of our planet 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:25.450
 Most of the first solid rocks formed in the past ages on the fiery surface 

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.220
 Has probably been renewed for a very long time. 

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:31.290
 Then comes the role of a little flexible metal called (zircon) to appear. 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.000
 Zircon looks like quartz 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.640
 In both chemical composition and hardness, 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.220
 So they stay longer after other minerals lose their properties. 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.580
 But zircon has two properties that quartz does not possess: zirconium 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.290
 He gives him his name, and small traces of radioactive uranium. 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.650
 The uranium atoms are zirconium-like enough 

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:54.120
 To allow it sometimes to slip to the structure of the crystalline metal taking the place of zirconium when the formation of the metal, 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.880
 In contrast to zirconium, unstable uranium particles eventually decompose into lead atoms. 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:03.770
 This is a strange thing, because bullets do not look like zernicium at all, 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:05.840
 So it will not end up becoming a pure zircon crystal. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.720
 So the more lead atoms are found in the zircon crystal, the more they know it is older. 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.320
 One of the oldest terrestrial minerals discovered, 

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:14.960
 Which is probably the oldest piece of land 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.660
 It is only a piece of lead filled with zircon beads 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:20.320
 It was found adjoining a sandstone in western Australia. 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.879
 In a way, this crystal survived from destruction 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:26.879
 By erosion, volcanic eruptions and the impact of asteroids over thousands of years, 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.300
 While we do not know you were formed with the first rocks of the earth? 

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.739
 If not, the first rock must be older. 

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.640
 So regardless of the earth's maximum efforts to hide its age from us, 

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:39.260
 The history of lead uranium in a little of the Zangun 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.700
 Tells us that our planet is at least 4.4 billion years old. 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.820
 There are also other evidence of meteorites suggesting that the Earth is larger. 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.069
 But at least, 

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:52.429
 This zircon makes us say with confidence that the earth is old. 

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:55.569
