00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
 Hello everyone decided to record a video on 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.220
 about the tablet pipo m9 pro 3g 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.110
 The problem was with perry flash in 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.280
 Unpacking in yourself saw the tablet 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.500
 I have a terrible lag 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.080
 on the stock firmware multitouch itself 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.940
 I myself worked all I wanted now and then gps 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.960
 communication worked did not catch a single 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:23.550
 I made a satellite mini reviewer and it seems 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 There everything was well, I reshuffled to 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.470
 unofficial firmware from buffalo code 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.279
 there redesigned interface added 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:33.989
 The menu from android is reworked and as a result 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.420
 I began to work at all ideality but 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:37.829
 what came back was what I had 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.680
 flash the tablet off the skin on 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:45.120
 official firmware android 4 4 2 a 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.520
 kitkat under the pipe is also downloaded on the forum 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.739
 W3bsit3-dns.com 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.360
 Why the reasons I will say better people 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.219
 not station informal firmware little 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.680
 Is there anything written in the comments all 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.890
 everything works fine, I like it 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:01.320
 and the like you risk killing your 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300
 tablet or phone something else 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.350
 always put official flash 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.470
 less risk 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:11.400
 especially for those who are weak 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:12.540
 understands the reason why I 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.490
 Perry reflash 

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:19.140
 but I just had to reflash so 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:21.750
 like a tablet in the evening situation 1 first 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.580
 in the evening I charged the tablet completely 100 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.909
 at 100 percent there 99 percent was 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.970
 sleep mode here but here so sleep 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.100
 mode put no applications 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.850
 internal did not work anything extra all 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.979
 was released 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:38.640
 and in the morning I wake up and not left 57 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:41.369
 percent overnight killed the battery in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.439
 half in idle this is 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.070
 very much surprised it after 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.460
 it became unofficial firmware after 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.740
 Togo 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:51.780
 the child played on the tablet and children 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:54.659
 toys undemanding nothing from 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.490
 no there is not anything of information Throw egoshki 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.899
 prepared hardly well and maybe but 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:05.149
 I have not tried to slow down 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:07.469
 the child played well the alphabet leo that 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.660
 the tablet started up very hot up 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:11.180
 such a degree that 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.920
 in his hands it was unbearable to hold 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.920
 boiling water simply 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.040
 And such a moment clicked and tablet 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:21.230
 passed out thought everything might have something already or 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.880
 Does the protection work at all? 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.770
 tried to turn on 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.290
 pops up the inscription android as 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:30.320
 It is assumed when loading and bands such 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.960
 ribbed thought all Khan's display from 

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.020
 overheating can pereklinilo or stung 

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.200
 whether puffed and the like but me 

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:42.830
 I was lucky I asked for the official one 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.610
 firmware from the pipe and it all worked 5 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:49.670
 perfect everything flies while it's second day 

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:52.280
 who any problems at all zero gps 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:54.920
 also works though the antenna 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.500
 these tablets have very weak catches 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.970
 hardly satellites over the open air 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:03.980
 in the open air hardly for 5-7 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:07.430
 minutes can catch 5-6 satellites 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:10.280
 Navitel this suffers poor navigator 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.550
 while catches the floor for half a century will pass this 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.200
 K so it seems 3g questions do not work 

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.190
 of course without the ability to call only 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.650
 data transfer 

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:24.080
 now even in my opinion before the established 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.420
 3G only data transfer is not enabled by 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:27.950
 about antutu test exactly the same test 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.800
 shows how I had on 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:34.459
 unofficial firmware about 22,000 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.520
 my or 20,000 no I do not remember until 22000 

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:40.100
 well just changed in the description 

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.260
 I had the official firmware brand 

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.430
 specify as a pipe here is the brand 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.910
 signs like rocky 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:50.870
 rockchip still remained 

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:54.760
 android versions 442 let's get closer 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:58.250
 probably what was seen 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:00.500
 form of the accelerator all too nothing 

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:03.070
 RAM changed as it was two 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.930
 gigabyte internal system memory 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.489
 exchanged again for 2 gigabytes 

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:11.950
 unofficially I ask who was the opportunity 

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:14.690
 change from gabay arc to eight 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.359
 expand the internal system 7 systemic 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.220
 memory for applications I put there 6 

00:04:17.359 --> 00:04:20.700
 gigabytes in the official firmware and 

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:23.990
 back established as 2 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.880
 in this and everything else remains the same 

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:32.010
 completely processes of course 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:35.700
 outdated weak but I think so 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:39.060
 come down and about now tried 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.970
 I installed a flash I turned on the tablet 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:44.900
 epic citadel and decided to drive him 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:50.040
 completely from 100 percent to minimum 

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:52.530
 in short he traveled he traveled epic citadel 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:54.210
 gaining there over thirty frames in 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:58.500
 second in my 30 fps 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:05:01.290
 and crochet in epic playback mode 

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.920
 citadel and from 100 percent to three 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:06.180
 percent 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:08.580
 he sat down at three to eight and the tablet was no longer 

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:10.730
 heated as it was on the unofficial 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.830
 the firmware was already cushy just 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:18.020
 It works as if it requires a good red epic 

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:20.250
 citadel to catching up and eventually shorter 

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:22.290
 now everything has changed everything 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.730
 more or less normalized I will still 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.340
 working with this tablet don't know what 

00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:28.050
 will not pour out but for the time being I will say 

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.830
 that I am not satisfied with this tablet 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:34.140
 sort of and such a brand 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:36.660
 not some kind of left but some assembly 

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:40.760
 in general, I have already said that dvoechku 

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:43.770
 For me personally, in general, the tablet is shorter 

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:45.420
 not worth buying yet I want to say that 

00:05:43.770 --> 00:05:47.430
 guys never put unofficial 

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:50.820
 Always put the firmware on all mobiles. 

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:52.230
 devices on tablets or something 

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:54.090
 gadgets are always official firmware 

00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:55.800
 try to bet if not already 

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:57.030
 must put your own risk 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.740
 some and rewritten 

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:03.570
 firmware from some users 

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.180
 such are the things he is gaining here 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:08.550
 more than twenty cadres of us and so he 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:11.610
 running here for a long time will not wait 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.530
 wait so if the video you liked 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:16.130
 put likes subscribe to my 

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.630
 channel write comments about 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.360
 firmware 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:23.400
 product pipe and boobs are questions with 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:26.240
