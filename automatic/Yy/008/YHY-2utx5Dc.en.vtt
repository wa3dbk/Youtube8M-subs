00:00:00.829 --> 00:00:03.829
 Hello 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:21.710
 dominated a new process 

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:30.160
 hello how about friends I'm your friend lady 

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.610
 ping are welcome to this new video 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.010
 where are we going to see what to do when not 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:38.890
 it appears to us cortana although we 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:42.220
 we already have the region the language and the voice 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:44.680
 in spanish spain ok the only thing 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.600
 we have to do is open the option of 

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:49.420
 cortana we go to the option of 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.030
 configuration if we activate this 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.309
 check box when activated automatically 

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:56.649
 will give us the options to be able 

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.809
 configure as we have seen 

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:00.940
 previously remember that you have to 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.340
 activate everything that mentions you and such 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.680
 as the location and let her see 

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.410
 your messages because if you do not activate it 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.660
 This is not going to allow you to have the ok 

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:12.580
 it's always going to be appearing to you that 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.320
 is available or you will appear on 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.119
 message that you simply write the 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:18.399
 information that you want to search 

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:20.380
 now once you're done we're going to 

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:22.690
 configure what the microphone is going 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.330
 to appear the following message there we 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.430
 appears the microphone with which we are 

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.860
 counting right now if we did not say that 

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.670
 we simply look for we put as 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.920
 predetermined 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:36.009
 the microphone that we said and 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.409
 we read what he tells us and Pedro speaks to 

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:41.200
 this once done this we already give in 

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.689
 finish and we can use cortana 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.000
 and well we activate to cut it of the same 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.350
 way that we saw earlier 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.240
 we just go in there to the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.330
 configurations we enter the option of 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.700
 notebook and there we activate or cut it to 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:57.070
 we can also activate the 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.890
 option that nothing else do we heed 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.990
 our voice and by doing this we are going to 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.450
 give the following configurations for 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:08.130
 that we give you some labels 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.130
 that she tells us 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:15.190
 or the cut find me a recipe for flan 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.690

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:20.110
 and I have it 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:22.000
 there goes the next or the cut which is 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.720
 the fastest route to get to 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.720
 work in car 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.170

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:32.420

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.340
 questions he says to cortana and that 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:36.800
