00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.849
 Welcome friends our opponent 

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.230
 has a urge a klapp okay me falls 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.710
 just two points to me too 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.719
 have piano no 

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:17.719
 Crabs of course the doubt and 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:25.949
 gastronomy you were called midi thales and scor 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:28.199
 Well, now I drive like me 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:38.610
 I open myself, I open myself 

00:00:28.199 --> 00:00:39.780
 I 'll open the fruit of you all with you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.760
 thought now I have in too 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.840
 Europe league back in the team cup 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.469
 started 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:49.800
 that would have been a number here 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:57.020
 the next opponent stands on when I yes 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:57.020
 look forward to the cafés will expire 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.490
 Okay, we'll try it again 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:10.560
 bass the opening went a score cro 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.720
 okay that went score kroos coco has one 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.960
 good defense but we could 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.980
 good talk maybe 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.750
 Whatever 's on our table 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:20.100
 We want to have a berry against 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:24.170
 status changes and can use it 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.170
 first in the first train to secure us therefore 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:36.050
 both are still working on 9 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:40.380
 and that's good off 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:44.130
 pity that I can now as it says 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.400
 It can be easier to attack once 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.330
 Burst away but I have it now 

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.890
 consider the small ones 

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.010
 okay we do more than half 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:56.880
 damage and its defense new 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:02:00.590
 defense his toxin tactic is on 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:02.369
 besides toxins can even go wrong 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:12.140
 I also had to be frightening sometimes 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:14.130
 wise notice so the mbb and haughtiness 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:19.340
 Write me , I'm glad about it 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:21.450
 So stop here now 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:23.340
 but if he is good with it 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:26.330
 Open clarion and mobilize michas 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:29.959
 to take the wind out of the sails 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:33.330
 theoretically seen in practice currency 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.620
 if he thinks about it I would be on everyone 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:40.650
 make a share in his case 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.970
 team posing he even does it 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.990
 could be hot pokémon 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.810
 would go for it 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:51.730
 I 'm going earthquake now he's going up 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.190
 Okay, it's risky for him 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:57.240
 risky for me depends on who 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.240
 now here the upper hand retains 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.720
 this is the death sentence for piano 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.610
 at least with china from sega is going on 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:15.220
 So I did paralysis altogether 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:19.390
 Honestly, if I attack now 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.970
 boost yes get through at the moment I'm around 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.709
 half unstoppable outside really 

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:29.380
 still a good offensive against yes 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:31.800
 now I have the confusion if 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.350
 Things are going well, do not trust us ourselves 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:36.910
 bad runs then have ourselves 

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:38.459
 okay for the first time i see media 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:42.040
 Vital is in action 

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:45.570
 Okay, okay, we are the ones 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:48.970
 It will be a milestone and this is the death shock 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:53.610
 In any case, we have so much attack 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.610
 Now that's so tough 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.290
 Yes 

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:07.770
 and what is now mourn were you 

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:10.489
 the skill multishop if yes then 

00:04:07.770 --> 00:04:10.489
 let's test it 

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:20.250
 kabul he really has one too big for me 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:24.039
 given offensive 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:25.509
 as I said stop something I give 

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.210
 Now you better my tip 

00:04:25.509 --> 00:04:30.550
 donna wave go as to admonition 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:37.930
 admitting yes, it has become something out of it 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:40.000
 our brother countries is now like this 

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:47.770
 strong that it would just have every one 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:50.139
 no matter what happens, that will be a right one 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:53.220
 one-sided fight because no offensive 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:55.690
 there is more to stop me 

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:59.460
 no point and fast enough a pokémon 

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.460
 does enough harm or puts away enough 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.289
 and bye 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:12.830
 that was too easy in that point 

00:05:10.689 --> 00:05:18.379
 I'm sorry if that's what I have to say 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:21.919
 also the good friends with it I would 

00:05:18.379 --> 00:05:27.039
 say I have, I thank you for 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:27.039
 the fight and see you next time
