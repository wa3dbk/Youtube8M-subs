are the only two places that Utes one
would<00:00:52.440> spawn<00:00:52.739> and<00:00:53.039> then<00:00:53.129> you<00:00:53.190> have<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.340> buy

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
it out now something like that for

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.359 
it out now something like that for
before<00:01:33.119> round<00:01:33.390> two<00:01:33.479> you<00:01:34.320> put<00:01:34.920> one<00:01:35.040> right<00:01:35.159> there

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
before round two you put one right there

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.990 
before round two you put one right there
and<00:01:35.520> then<00:01:35.610> put<00:01:35.820> one<00:01:35.970> right<00:01:36.090> here<00:01:36.420> and<00:01:36.630> then<00:01:36.990> you

and then put one right here and then you

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.399 
and then put one right here and then you
use<00:01:39.000> it<00:01:39.210> boosts<00:01:39.509> over<00:01:39.840> that<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.229> then<00:01:40.320> you

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
use it boosts over that and then you

crouch<00:02:34.000> i<00:02:34.239> don't<00:02:34.390> remember<00:02:34.840> where<00:02:35.140> that<00:02:35.170> place

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
crouch i don't remember where that place

crouch i don't remember where that place
is<00:02:35.560> I<00:02:35.980> think<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.849> near<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.150> box<00:02:37.450> also<00:02:37.720> but

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:38.230 
is I think it's near the box also but

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:42.300 
is I think it's near the box also but
it's<00:02:38.799> so<00:02:39.010> it's<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.549> good<00:02:39.700> place<00:02:40.829> I'm<00:02:41.829> going<00:02:41.980> same

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:42.310 
it's so it's a good place I'm going same

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.610 
it's so it's a good place I'm going same
with<00:02:42.459> this<00:02:42.609> one<00:02:42.670> it's<00:02:43.180> this<00:02:43.959> one<00:02:44.170> we<00:02:44.319> did<00:02:44.470> not

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
with this one it's this one we did not

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.670 
with this one it's this one we did not
know<00:02:44.829> it's<00:02:45.159> the<00:02:45.579> exact<00:02:45.939> same<00:02:45.970> area<00:02:46.599> just<00:02:47.260> up<00:02:47.439> a

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
know it's the exact same area just up a

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.470 
know it's the exact same area just up a
level<00:02:48.010> and<00:02:48.310> you<00:02:48.760> just<00:02:48.970> have<00:02:49.150> to<00:02:49.269> take<00:02:49.419> a

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
level and you just have to take a

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.629 
level and you just have to take a
running<00:02:49.810> jump<00:02:49.930> and<00:02:50.319> place<00:02:51.129> it<00:02:51.280> right<00:02:51.310> there<00:02:51.519> it

00:02:51.629 --> 00:02:51.639 
running jump and place it right there it

00:02:51.639 --> 00:02:52.949 
running jump and place it right there it
does<00:02:51.790> not<00:02:52.000> look<00:02:52.180> like<00:02:52.239> you<00:02:52.510> can<00:02:52.629> make<00:02:52.810> you<00:02:52.930> know

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:52.959 
does not look like you can make you know

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.440 
does not look like you can make you know
I<00:02:53.349> honestly<00:02:53.739> didn't<00:02:54.040> take<00:02:54.129> our<00:02:54.280> lid<00:02:54.489> but<00:02:54.700> we

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:55.450 
I honestly didn't take our lid but we

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.979 
I honestly didn't take our lid but we
did<00:02:55.599> so<00:02:55.930> it's<00:02:56.849> it's<00:02:57.849> good<00:02:58.180> and<00:02:58.359> then<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.840> can

00:02:58.979 --> 00:02:58.989 
did so it's it's good and then you can

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:00.599 
did so it's it's good and then you can
just<00:02:59.109> camp<00:02:59.349> here<00:02:59.590> what's<00:02:59.829> on<00:03:00.069> top<00:03:00.280> and<00:03:00.489> then

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:00.609 
just camp here what's on top and then

00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:03.240 
just camp here what's on top and then
the<00:03:00.700> window<00:03:01.000> but<00:03:01.269> we<00:03:01.989> opened<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.470> for<00:03:02.980> video

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:03.250 
the window but we opened it for video

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:06.379 
the window but we opened it for video
purposes<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:04.030> then<00:03:04.150> that<00:03:04.299> here<00:03:04.569> is<00:03:04.950> near<00:03:05.950> the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:06.389 
purposes and then that here is near the

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:09.149 
purposes and then that here is near the
power<00:03:07.389> and<00:03:07.750> then<00:03:08.049> you<00:03:08.169> just<00:03:08.349> launch<00:03:08.739> it<00:03:08.980> and

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:09.159 
power and then you just launch it and

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.979 
power and then you just launch it and
then<00:03:09.280> get<00:03:09.489> right<00:03:09.669> there<00:03:09.819> I<00:03:10.090> remember<00:03:10.810> all

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:10.989 
then get right there I remember all

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.280 
then get right there I remember all
these<00:03:11.200> places<00:03:11.500> you<00:03:11.739> cannot<00:03:12.220> do<00:03:12.519> normally<00:03:13.290> so

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:14.290 
these places you cannot do normally so

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.219 
these places you cannot do normally so
it's<00:03:14.739> not<00:03:14.889> just<00:03:14.950> pointless<00:03:15.639> video<00:03:15.909> and<00:03:16.419> then

00:03:17.219 --> 00:03:17.229 
it's not just pointless video and then

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:20.309 
it's not just pointless video and then
this<00:03:17.440> one's<00:03:17.709> this<00:03:18.220> one's<00:03:18.840> honestly<00:03:19.840> not<00:03:20.079> the

00:03:20.309 --> 00:03:20.319 
this one's this one's honestly not the

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:22.890 
this one's this one's honestly not the
best<00:03:20.620> one<00:03:20.949> but<00:03:21.370> if<00:03:21.609> you<00:03:22.180> just<00:03:22.359> wanted<00:03:22.629> to<00:03:22.690> get

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
best one but if you just wanted to get

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.479

up<00:03:22.959> there<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.500> not<00:03:23.680> really<00:03:24.010> you<00:03:24.159> can<00:03:24.340> just

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:24.489 
up there it's not really you can just

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.399 
up there it's not really you can just
walk<00:03:24.669> around<00:03:24.849> this<00:03:25.239> song<00:03:25.599> so<00:03:25.870> not<00:03:26.049> too<00:03:26.169> big<00:03:26.319> of

00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:26.409 
walk around this song so not too big of

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:28.349 
walk around this song so not too big of
a<00:03:26.470> deal<00:03:26.590> but<00:03:26.799> right<00:03:27.010> here<00:03:27.310> I<00:03:27.489> think<00:03:28.090> this<00:03:28.150> one

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:28.359 
a deal but right here I think this one

a deal but right here I think this one
is<00:03:28.389> a<00:03:28.510> really<00:03:28.840> good<00:03:28.959> one<00:03:29.139> because<00:03:29.400> it<00:03:30.400> gets<00:03:30.669> you

00:03:30.869 --> 00:03:30.879 
is a really good one because it gets you

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:32.309 
is a really good one because it gets you
back<00:03:31.060> up<00:03:31.329> to<00:03:31.479> like<00:03:31.629> pretty<00:03:31.870> much<00:03:32.049> where<00:03:32.229> you
