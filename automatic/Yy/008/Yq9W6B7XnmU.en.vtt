00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:02.600
 A film marathon is currently taking place. 

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.600
 Each movie has a duration of 1 and 3/4 hours. 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.200
 If you want to watch 3 movies, how long will your marathon last? 

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.800
 You can use the number axis below to help you find the answer. 

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:20.100
 Each movie lasts for 1/3/4 hours. 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.800
 Let's say the first movie ... Let's say the first movie 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.200
 is "Star Wars", 

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.100
 which I would probably include in any movie marathon. 

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
 It will be a long hour and 3/4. 

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.200
 That is, let's see, this is 1 ... 1 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.300
 and we'll have another 3/4. 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.700
 So every element is 1/4, 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:38.800
 because we have 4 parts between 1 and 2. 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.800
 1, 2, 3, 4. 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.000
 And we'll see 3/4. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.800
 1, 2, 3. 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.700
 This is the length of the first movie. 

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.500
 And the second movie will be 1 and 3/4. 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.100
 Thus, 1 is 4/4. 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.600
 1, 2, 3, 4, 

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.600
 and then we will have another 3/4. 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.000
 1, 2, 3 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.900
 and as I said, 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.400
 4/4 and 3/4 is 7/4. 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.400
 A 1 and 3/4 is equivalent to 7/4, 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:07.700
 here we see that 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:09.200
 when they are colored 1 and 3/4 in blue, 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.600
 actually I've scored 7/4. 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.100
 It's the same here ... in red. 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.800
 Let us now use green. 

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:21.600
 "Gandhi" is actually slightly longer than 1 and 3/4. 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.600
 It's a nice movie. 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.000
 I put it here because it's one of my favorites. 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.700
 One more hour and 3/4 ... 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.200
 Or we can imagine it as 4/4 plus 3/4 hours 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.200
 or 7/4. 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.800
 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:48.600
 This here takes us to 5. And this point here is 5 and 1/4 hours. 

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.900
 Let's see if we've got the same. If we get the same result, 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:53.800
 when we do it mathematically, 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:55.800
 I suppose it is mathematical, so. 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.200
 But each movie lasts for 1 and 3/4 hours. 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.800
 We have already said that 1 and 3/4 equals 1 plus 3/4, 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.100
 Equals are ... 1 is equal to 4/4. 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.300
 Thus, 4/4 plus 3/4, 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.800
 which is 7/4. 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.100
 Another way to turn this mixed number into an irregular liver is, say, 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.600
 Look, 4 by 1 is 4, so we get 4/4, 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.200
 plus 3 is 7, 7/4. 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:26.400
 Now we go to ... we go 7/4 of an hour three times. 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:33.000
 So we will multiply 7/4 by 3. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.400
 There are several ways we can think about here. 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.200
 We can treat it as three 7/4, collecting them. 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.000
 7/4 plus 7/4 plus 7/4, 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.600
 which will be equal to 21 on 4. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.200
 And if we want to make it a mixed number, 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.700
 21/4 equals ... 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:56.700
 Well 4 is contained in 20 without residue, 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:00.300
 so this can be represented as 20/4 plus 1/4, 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.100
 and 20/4 is equal to 5. 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.900
 Here we have 5 and 1/4, 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.500
 which is exactly what we saw here. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:09.500
 Another way is 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:18.400
 let's say: 7/4, and then multiply it by 3/1. 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.600
 To make it clear that we multiply numerators 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.500
 and denominators. 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:27.400
 In the numerator I will have 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7, 3, 

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.500
 and in denominator 4 by 1, 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.900
 which is 4. 

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.300
 This is 7 by 3 on 4, 

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:36.200
 or 21/4, which 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.100
 we already saw: it is 5 and 1/4.
