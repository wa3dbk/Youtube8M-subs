of that how do we detox and what are
some<00:00:04.620> of<00:00:04.890> the<00:00:04.980> ways<00:00:05.430> that<00:00:05.490> you<00:00:06.240> have<00:00:06.270> found

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
some of the ways that you have found

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.530 
some of the ways that you have found
most<00:00:06.839> successful<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:08.090> don't<00:00:09.090> think<00:00:09.420> people

most successful I don't think people

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:12.339 
most successful I don't think people
need<00:00:09.809> to<00:00:09.870> be<00:00:10.050> as<00:00:10.139> radical<00:00:10.410> as<00:00:10.889> doing<00:00:11.400> intense

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
need to be as radical as doing intense

need to be as radical as doing intense
juicing<00:00:13.349> cleanses<00:00:14.009> now<00:00:14.670> I'm<00:00:14.759> not<00:00:14.880> against<00:00:15.330> it

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
juicing cleanses now I'm not against it

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.420 
juicing cleanses now I'm not against it
but<00:00:15.839> a<00:00:15.900> lot<00:00:16.049> of<00:00:16.080> people<00:00:16.199> will<00:00:16.410> go<00:00:16.590> two<00:00:16.650> weeks<00:00:17.160> a

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
but a lot of people will go two weeks a

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:20.870 
but a lot of people will go two weeks a
month<00:00:17.820> doing<00:00:18.600> some<00:00:18.840> radical<00:00:19.350> stuff<00:00:19.590> I<00:00:19.880> don't

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
month doing some radical stuff I don't

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.029 
month doing some radical stuff I don't
feel<00:00:21.210> every<00:00:21.539> body<00:00:21.810> Constitution<00:00:22.590> can<00:00:22.769> handle

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
feel every body Constitution can handle

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
feel every body Constitution can handle
that<00:00:23.220> I<00:00:23.400> think<00:00:23.820> sometimes<00:00:24.210> if<00:00:24.420> they're<00:00:25.230> not

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that I think sometimes if they're not

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:26.720 
that I think sometimes if they're not
geared<00:00:25.619> up<00:00:25.800> for<00:00:25.859> it<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.250> that's<00:00:26.430> really

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
geared up for it and that's really

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.939 
geared up for it and that's really
individual<00:00:27.359> you<00:00:27.720> can<00:00:27.900> actually<00:00:28.080> get<00:00:28.349> worse

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
individual you can actually get worse

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.290 
individual you can actually get worse
versus<00:00:29.519> better<00:00:29.699> because<00:00:30.029> you<00:00:30.150> haven't

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:30.300 
versus better because you haven't

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.440 
versus better because you haven't
supported<00:00:30.869> the<00:00:30.960> systems<00:00:31.380> I<00:00:31.700> still<00:00:32.700> find<00:00:33.000> today

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
supported the systems I still find today

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.840 
supported the systems I still find today
that<00:00:33.750> if<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.440> just<00:00:34.770> make<00:00:35.130> some<00:00:35.370> dietary

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
that if you just make some dietary

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:39.440 
that if you just make some dietary
changes<00:00:36.590> so<00:00:37.590> my<00:00:38.129> big<00:00:38.370> four<00:00:38.640> is<00:00:38.910> remove<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
changes so my big four is remove the

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.959 
changes so my big four is remove the
alcohol<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.649> sugars<00:00:41.070> including<00:00:41.730> things<00:00:41.879> like

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
alcohol the sugars including things like

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:45.740 
alcohol the sugars including things like
honey<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.390> agave<00:00:42.450> all<00:00:42.989> of<00:00:43.200> that<00:00:43.760> gluten<00:00:44.760> dairy

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
corn and soy and fermented foods those

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:50.750 
corn and soy and fermented foods those
are<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.289> big<00:00:49.590> things<00:00:49.829> that<00:00:50.129> really<00:00:50.280> inflamed

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
are the big things that really inflamed

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.310 
are the big things that really inflamed
us<00:00:50.969> that's<00:00:51.210> what<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.480> need<00:00:51.600> to<00:00:51.629> stick<00:00:51.930> with<00:00:51.960> so

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
us that's what you need to stick with so

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:54.380 
us that's what you need to stick with so
that<00:00:52.530> in<00:00:52.680> itself<00:00:52.980> is<00:00:53.160> detoxification<00:00:53.760> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
that in itself is detoxification and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.840 
that in itself is detoxification and
then<00:00:55.379> you<00:00:55.469> come<00:00:55.680> in<00:00:55.829> with<00:00:55.980> certain<00:00:56.370> formulas

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
then you come in with certain formulas

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.119 
then you come in with certain formulas
so<00:00:57.149> in<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.809> first<00:00:58.050> time<00:00:58.199> someone<00:00:58.500> sees<00:00:58.680> me<00:00:58.739> I'm

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
so in the first time someone sees me I'm

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.069 
so in the first time someone sees me I'm
always<00:00:59.340> going<00:00:59.609> to<00:00:59.640> support<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.660> gallbladder

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
always going to support the gallbladder

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.830 
always going to support the gallbladder
liver<00:01:01.170> initially<00:01:02.160> to<00:01:02.370> start<00:01:02.430> to<00:01:02.840> decongest

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
liver initially to start to decongest

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.080 
liver initially to start to decongest
the<00:01:04.320> bile<00:01:04.619> so<00:01:05.129> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.489> start<00:01:05.670> to<00:01:05.820> move

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
the bile so you can start to move

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.270 
the bile so you can start to move
through<00:01:06.390> the<00:01:06.479> toxins<00:01:07.020> but<00:01:07.710> I<00:01:07.770> only<00:01:07.920> do<00:01:08.250> that

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
through the toxins but I only do that

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
through the toxins but I only do that
knowing<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.119> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.479> have<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.659> bowel

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
knowing that you can have a bowel

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.300 
knowing that you can have a bowel
movement<00:01:09.960> each<00:01:10.350> day<00:01:10.560> so<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.890> very<00:01:11.100> first

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
movement each day so the very first

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
movement each day so the very first
thing<00:01:11.430> I<00:01:11.610> do<00:01:11.670> is<00:01:11.970> ask<00:01:12.270> do<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> poop<00:01:12.780> every<00:01:13.049> day

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
thing I do is ask do you poop every day

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.620 
thing I do is ask do you poop every day
because<00:01:13.710> if<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:13.950> don't<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:15.150> I<00:01:15.180> don't<00:01:15.390> go<00:01:15.479> any

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
because if you don't that I don't go any

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.480 
because if you don't that I don't go any
further<00:01:15.780> and<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:16.979> sad<00:01:17.280> because

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
further and that's really sad because

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.700 
further and that's really sad because
that's<00:01:18.030> step<00:01:18.479> 101<00:01:18.960> you<00:01:19.110> have<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.470> have<00:01:19.590> at

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
that's step 101 you have to have at

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.740 
that's step 101 you have to have at
least<00:01:19.770> one<00:01:20.070> bowel<00:01:20.220> movement<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.610> day<00:01:20.820> so<00:01:21.600> I'll

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
least one bowel movement a day so I'll

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.460

so much junk that basically blood sugars

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.440 
so much junk that basically blood sugars
are<00:02:07.920> typically<00:02:08.580> high<00:02:08.759> or<00:02:08.819> low<00:02:09.060> so<00:02:09.300> we're

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
are typically high or low so we're

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.790
