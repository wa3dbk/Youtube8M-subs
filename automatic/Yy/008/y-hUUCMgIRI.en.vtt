00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
pump the I could send a pump out here

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.340 
pump the I could send a pump out here
without<00:00:17.340> having<00:00:17.640> electricity<00:00:18.180> and<00:00:18.660> this<00:00:19.109> is

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
without having electricity and this is

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.920 
without having electricity and this is
this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.010> air<00:00:20.160> hose<00:00:20.490> so<00:00:21.119> my<00:00:21.270> air<00:00:21.449> pump<00:00:21.810> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
this is the air hose so my air pump is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.230 
this is the air hose so my air pump is
safely<00:00:22.260> inside<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.920> building<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.519> this<00:00:24.000> you

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
safely inside the building and this you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:25.609 
safely inside the building and this you
can<00:00:24.390> hear<00:00:24.600> I<00:00:24.660> think<00:00:24.720> maybe<00:00:25.170> even<00:00:25.380> through<00:00:25.529> the

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
can hear I think maybe even through the

down here we know I will get
substantially<00:00:48.420> more<00:00:48.629> water<00:00:49.340> then<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.670> come

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
substantially more water then I come

we find out I can pump the water that

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.170 
we find out I can pump the water that
high<00:00:58.440> now<00:00:59.190> that's<00:00:59.399> really<00:00:59.609> good

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180

comes above it the water buildup on top

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.090 
comes above it the water buildup on top
of<00:06:36.360> it<00:06:36.480> will<00:06:36.630> auto<00:06:36.840> regulate<00:06:37.470> it<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.740> this
