without Michael Vick what is it well I
mean<00:00:31.590> we<00:00:31.769> break<00:00:32.099> down<00:00:32.130> every<00:00:32.520> play<00:00:32.759> when<00:00:33.120> we<00:00:33.210> do

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
mean we break down every play when we do

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.090 
mean we break down every play when we do
our<00:00:33.390> analysis<00:00:34.050> and<00:00:34.320> over<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> last<00:00:34.770> three

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
our analysis and over the last three

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.979 
our analysis and over the last three
years<00:00:35.130> two<00:00:35.670> out<00:00:35.790> of<00:00:35.820> the<00:00:36.030> three<00:00:36.270> Joey

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
years two out of the three Joey

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.780 
years two out of the three Joey
Harrington<00:00:37.290> has<00:00:37.770> come<00:00:38.010> out<00:00:38.190> as<00:00:38.340> a<00:00:38.399> better

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
Harrington has come out as a better

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.270 
Harrington has come out as a better
passer<00:00:39.180> per<00:00:39.719> play<00:00:39.989> than<00:00:40.649> Michael<00:00:40.980> Vick<00:00:41.129> and

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
passer per play than Michael Vick and

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.580 
passer per play than Michael Vick and
the<00:00:41.460> other<00:00:41.610> year<00:00:41.940> they<00:00:42.180> were<00:00:42.239> equal<00:00:42.690> obviously

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
the other year they were equal obviously

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:44.869 
the other year they were equal obviously
doesn't<00:00:43.710> have<00:00:43.980> Michael<00:00:44.340> Vick's<00:00:44.520> running

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
doesn't have Michael Vick's running

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.700 
doesn't have Michael Vick's running
ability<00:00:45.300> that<00:00:45.510> ability<00:00:45.960> to<00:00:46.110> sort<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> change

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
ability that ability to sort of change

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.490 
ability that ability to sort of change
games<00:00:47.100> with<00:00:47.340> one<00:00:47.610> play<00:00:48.000> so<00:00:48.780> there's<00:00:49.020> much<00:00:49.260> less

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
games with one play so there's much less

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
games with one play so there's much less
risk<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.070> reward<00:00:50.430> with<00:00:50.640> Joey<00:00:50.820> Harrington<00:00:51.090> but

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
risk and reward with Joey Harrington but

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:53.779 
risk and reward with Joey Harrington but
we<00:00:52.050> don't<00:00:52.199> really<00:00:52.320> see<00:00:52.620> the<00:00:52.770> Falcons<00:00:53.460> being<00:00:53.699> a

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
we don't really see the Falcons being a

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.840 
we don't really see the Falcons being a
much<00:00:54.420> different<00:00:54.780> team<00:00:55.170> with<00:00:56.070> Harrington<00:00:56.610> than

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
much different team with Harrington than

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.700 
much different team with Harrington than
with<00:00:56.969> vick<00:00:57.180> as<00:00:57.360> far<00:00:57.600> as<00:00:57.690> winds<00:00:58.109> goes<00:00:58.289> we<00:00:58.559> saw
