 Well, looking at the time this was already 

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:09.969
 this is already and in addition it seems easy and 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:11.590
 only in three steps how would you give me 

00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:14.349
 counted and thanks to its system of 

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:17.109
 induction cooks faster and also 

00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:18.460
 I have seen that it is programmable 24 hours that 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.199
 it's super important 

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:23.939
 because you put it the day before and when 

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:23.939
 you arrive home is warm 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:29.050
 the food an alternative for the kitchen 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.429
 traditional but look we put all 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.089
 the acquiring ingredients is very 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:34.000
 facilitated 

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:36.370
 are placed here the menu is selected 

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.190
 we want in this case you would paste 

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.350
 we give cooking equality that we have for 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.140
 there spaghetti Bolognese and in 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:46.570
 just a few minutes everything tell us 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.570
 how is the chef plus induction the people 

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:51.490
 he will ask is there a big money will say the 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.590
 people do not really think that because 

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.360
 only 29 euros a month you have a chef 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.150
 particular in your house that cooks you from 

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.090

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:03.040
 tell me, bake or steamed according to 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.680
 the dish that we want to prepare does 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.929
 directly incredible and you say also 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:07.929 --> 00:01:11.680
 there is a large cookbook 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.120
 you say if I get bored of the recipes that 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.310
 they come in the book because nothing happens 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.720
 besides the great cookbook on the web 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.120
