and you can see is on round two and in
the<00:00:18.359> top<00:00:18.600> right-hand<00:00:18.869> corner<00:00:19.109> here's

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
the top right-hand corner here's

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.400 
the top right-hand corner here's
juggernog<00:00:20.400> I<00:00:20.609> do<00:00:21.180> believe<00:00:21.810> this<00:00:22.140> could

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
juggernog I do believe this could

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.950 
juggernog I do believe this could
possibly<00:00:22.650> be<00:00:23.010> real<00:00:23.460> however<00:00:24.180> if<00:00:24.330> it's<00:00:24.539> fake

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
possibly be real however if it's fake

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.089 
possibly be real however if it's fake
then<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.949> person<00:00:26.460> who<00:00:27.170> has<00:00:28.170> designed<00:00:28.920> this

00:00:29.089 --> 00:00:29.099 
then the person who has designed this

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.659 
then the person who has designed this
image<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.970> pretty<00:00:30.599> good<00:00:30.869> at<00:00:31.050> editing<00:00:31.890> in

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
image is pretty good at editing in

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.819 
image is pretty good at editing in
images<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> stuff<00:00:34.079> like<00:00:34.290> that<00:00:34.350> because

00:00:34.819 --> 00:00:34.829 
images and stuff like that because

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.130 
images and stuff like that because
honestly<00:00:35.670> I<00:00:36.059> have<00:00:36.989> no<00:00:37.200> idea<00:00:37.230> if<00:00:38.180> this<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.239> fake

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
honestly I have no idea if this is fake

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.340 
honestly I have no idea if this is fake
you<00:00:40.739> know<00:00:40.860> I<00:00:41.090> personally<00:00:42.090> there<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.840> nothing

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
you know I personally there is nothing

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.160 
you know I personally there is nothing
to<00:00:43.680> prove<00:00:44.250> that<00:00:44.430> it's<00:00:44.610> fake<00:00:44.969> other<00:00:45.300> than<00:00:45.750> that

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
to prove that it's fake other than that

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.190 
to prove that it's fake other than that
it's<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.550> direct<00:00:47.940> direct<00:00:48.360> source<00:00:48.870> from

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
it's not a direct direct source from

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.979 
it's not a direct direct source from
treyarch<00:00:49.710> but<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.219> I<00:00:50.640> believe<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:51.780> is

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
treyarch but I'm I believe this is

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:54.110 
treyarch but I'm I believe this is
friggin<00:00:52.440> real<00:00:52.739> because<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.699> know<00:00:53.789> you<00:00:53.850> have

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
friggin real because you know you have

corner<00:00:59.910> of<00:01:00.300> that<00:01:00.809> gamma<00:01:01.260> counter<00:01:01.469> you<00:01:01.739> have

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
corner of that gamma counter you have

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:04.130 
corner of that gamma counter you have
like<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.280> style<00:01:02.699> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.120> font<00:01:03.449> of<00:01:03.660> the<00:01:03.719> thing

like the style of the font of the thing

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.850 
like the style of the font of the thing
oh<00:01:04.290> and<00:01:04.530> like<00:01:05.250> the<00:01:05.689> you<00:01:06.689> know<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.020> round<00:01:07.260> the

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
round counter with the two strokes it

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:12.950 
round counter with the two strokes it
does<00:01:11.220> look<00:01:11.250> different<00:01:11.670> from<00:01:12.210> black<00:01:12.540> ops<00:01:12.750> but

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
does look different from black ops but

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.410 
does look different from black ops but
you<00:01:13.439> know<00:01:13.560> it's<00:01:13.710> really<00:01:13.950> hard<00:01:14.130> to<00:01:14.460> tell<00:01:14.729> and<00:01:15.119> I

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
you know it's really hard to tell and I

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.050 
you know it's really hard to tell and I
don't<00:01:15.630> know<00:01:15.689> why<00:01:16.020> Juggernog<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.890> in<00:01:17.070> the<00:01:17.280> top

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
don't know why Juggernog is in the top

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.670 
don't know why Juggernog is in the top
right-hand<00:01:18.360> corner<00:01:18.630> and<00:01:19.200> you<00:01:19.350> might<00:01:19.560> be

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
right-hand corner and you might be

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.710 
right-hand corner and you might be
asking<00:01:20.040> well<00:01:20.250> how<00:01:20.310> does<00:01:20.610> he<00:01:20.880> of<00:01:20.939> Juggernog<00:01:21.509> on

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720

asking well how does he of Juggernog on
round<00:01:21.990> two<00:01:22.110> well<00:01:22.950> it's<00:01:23.369> either<00:01:23.580> maybe<00:01:23.880> because

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
round two well it's either maybe because

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:26.090 
round two well it's either maybe because
they're<00:01:24.509> still<00:01:24.689> testing<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.229> game<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.860> you

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
they're still testing the game and you

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.630 
they're still testing the game and you
know<00:01:26.220> like<00:01:27.080> they<00:01:28.080> can<00:01:28.259> basically<00:01:28.430> do<00:01:29.430> what

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
know like they can basically do what

know like they can basically do what
they<00:01:29.790> want<00:01:30.119> so<00:01:30.420> they<00:01:30.540> can<00:01:30.689> give<00:01:30.900> themselves

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:31.220 
they want so they can give themselves

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.850 
they want so they can give themselves
Juggernog<00:01:32.220> or<00:01:32.640> it's<00:01:33.420> tied<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.530> with<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
Juggernog or it's tied in with the

leaked achievements that was recently
not<00:01:37.680> recently<00:01:37.860> this<00:01:38.310> was<00:01:38.520> leaked<00:01:38.759> about<00:01:38.880> a

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
not recently this was leaked about a

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.510 
not recently this was leaked about a
couple<00:01:39.360> weeks<00:01:39.479> ago<00:01:39.600> but<00:01:40.400> one<00:01:41.400> of<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
couple weeks ago but one of the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.719 
couple weeks ago but one of the
achievements<00:01:42.270> was<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.899> transit<00:01:43.680> which<00:01:44.490> is

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
achievements was in transit which is

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.569 
achievements was in transit which is
supposedly<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.479> zombie<00:01:46.049> map<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:46.979> have<00:01:47.250> to

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
supposedly the zombie map you have to

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.480 
supposedly the zombie map you have to
arm<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.869> get<00:01:48.990> an<00:01:49.079> achievement<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:50.009> get<00:01:50.280> you

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
arm to get an achievement you get you

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:54.350 
arm to get an achievement you get you
acquire<00:01:51.000> a<00:01:51.299> perk<00:01:52.610> before<00:01:53.610> the<00:01:53.729> power<00:01:54.000> is

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
acquire a perk before the power is

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.289 
acquire a perk before the power is
turned<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.899> so<00:01:55.470> that's<00:01:55.829> probably<00:01:56.100> why<00:01:56.369> he<00:01:57.060> has

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
turned on so that's probably why he has

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.760 
turned on so that's probably why he has
it<00:01:57.479> and<00:01:57.570> he's<00:01:58.140> probably<00:01:58.320> got<00:01:58.560> the<00:01:58.680> achievement

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
it and he's probably got the achievement

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.520 
it and he's probably got the achievement
and<00:01:59.280> it<00:02:00.210> does<00:02:00.360> have<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.659> watermark<00:02:01.110> there<00:02:01.380> of

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
and it does have the watermark there of

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.760
