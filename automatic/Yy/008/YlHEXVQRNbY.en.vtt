00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
white ambient noise and it is really

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:35.060

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
so hopefully in their next version of

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.830 
so hopefully in their next version of
the<00:01:40.560> ultra<00:01:40.920> HD<00:01:41.280> they<00:01:41.850> will<00:01:42.030> have<00:01:42.270> an<00:01:42.390> external

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
the ultra HD they will have an external

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.410 
the ultra HD they will have an external
mic<00:01:43.020> check<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.590> that<00:01:43.619> would<00:01:44.189> be<00:01:44.340> great<00:01:44.970> the

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
mic check so that would be great the

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.969 
mic check so that would be great the
other<00:01:45.570> thing<00:01:45.720> i<00:01:45.810> don't<00:01:45.869> like<00:01:46.229> about<00:01:46.350> it<00:01:46.649> is

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979 
other thing i don't like about it is

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.710 
other thing i don't like about it is
that<00:01:47.009> it<00:01:47.579> has<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.680> wall<00:01:49.680> charger<00:01:50.240> that<00:01:51.240> heats<00:01:51.540> up

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:51.720 
that it has a wall charger that heats up

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.510 
that it has a wall charger that heats up
very<00:01:51.960> very<00:01:52.049> quickly<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.860> then<00:01:53.070> it<00:01:53.189> shuts<00:01:53.430> down

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
very very quickly and then it shuts down

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:56.179 
very very quickly and then it shuts down
the<00:01:53.759> charging<00:01:54.299> so<00:01:54.689> you<00:01:55.470> really<00:01:55.799> need<00:01:55.979> to

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
the charging so you really need to

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.459 
the charging so you really need to
charge<00:01:56.610> it<00:01:56.820> through<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.210> USB<00:01:57.540> port<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.409> your

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
charge it through the USB port on your

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.590 
charge it through the USB port on your
computer<00:01:58.950> and<00:01:59.579> that<00:01:59.790> charges<00:02:00.180> it<00:02:00.299> up<00:02:00.390> actually

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
computer and that charges it up actually

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.840 
computer and that charges it up actually
pretty<00:02:00.960> fast<00:02:01.259> i<00:02:01.560> would<00:02:01.829> say<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.159> in

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
pretty fast i would say probably in

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.490 
pretty fast i would say probably in
about<00:02:02.969> an<00:02:03.210> hour<00:02:03.420> or<00:02:03.570> so<00:02:03.780> or<00:02:04.229> even<00:02:04.649> less<00:02:05.030> so<00:02:06.500> the

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
about an hour or so or even less so the

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.309 
about an hour or so or even less so the
charging<00:02:07.979> has<00:02:08.250> got<00:02:08.729> to<00:02:08.910> change<00:02:09.050> what's<00:02:10.050> even

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
charging has got to change what's even

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.960 
charging has got to change what's even
weirder<00:02:10.470> about<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.099> when<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.489> do<00:02:11.670> charge

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
weirder about it is when you do charge

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:13.640 
weirder about it is when you do charge
it<00:02:12.180> you<00:02:12.300> plug<00:02:12.480> it<00:02:12.660> into<00:02:12.810> the<00:02:13.020> churching<00:02:13.410> to

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it you plug it into the churching to

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.710 
it you plug it into the churching to
nice<00:02:13.739> and<00:02:14.010> you<00:02:14.310> plug<00:02:14.549> it<00:02:14.730> into<00:02:14.909> the<00:02:15.150> wall<00:02:15.180> and

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
nice and you plug it into the wall and

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.869 
nice and you plug it into the wall and
first<00:02:16.079> of<00:02:16.200> all<00:02:16.260> it<00:02:16.500> puts<00:02:16.950> a<00:02:17.010> lot<00:02:17.159> of<00:02:17.189> strain<00:02:17.610> on

00:02:17.869 --> 00:02:17.879 
first of all it puts a lot of strain on

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:21.740 
first of all it puts a lot of strain on
this<00:02:18.150> USB<00:02:19.220> connection<00:02:20.220> here<00:02:20.549> and<00:02:20.750> secondly

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
this USB connection here and secondly

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.759 
this USB connection here and secondly
the<00:02:22.879> indicator<00:02:23.879> where<00:02:24.239> that<00:02:24.540> shows<00:02:24.810> how<00:02:25.620> much

00:02:25.759 --> 00:02:25.769 
the indicator where that shows how much

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.580 
the indicator where that shows how much
as<00:02:25.950> charged<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.610> facing<00:02:27.390> the<00:02:27.480> wall<00:02:27.720> so<00:02:28.530> you

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
as charged is facing the wall so you

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.490 
as charged is facing the wall so you
have<00:02:29.040> to<00:02:29.159> unplug<00:02:29.640> it<00:02:29.939> to<00:02:30.299> find<00:02:30.569> out<00:02:30.780> if<00:02:31.019> it's

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
have to unplug it to find out if it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.319 
have to unplug it to find out if it's
charged<00:02:32.010> and<00:02:32.250> then<00:02:32.459> there's<00:02:32.640> no<00:02:32.849> battery

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:33.329 
charged and then there's no battery

00:02:33.329 --> 00:02:37.490 
charged and then there's no battery
indicator<00:02:33.959> on<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:35.040> actual<00:02:35.640> screen<00:02:36.450> so<00:02:37.409> you

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
indicator on the actual screen so you

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:39.770 
indicator on the actual screen so you
can't<00:02:37.829> even<00:02:38.040> tell<00:02:38.280> when<00:02:38.939> it's<00:02:39.120> charged<00:02:39.510> so

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:39.780 
can't even tell when it's charged so

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:41.690 
can't even tell when it's charged so
that<00:02:40.409> those<00:02:40.680> are<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.920> couple<00:02:40.980> features<00:02:41.400> there

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
that those are a couple features there

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.569 
that those are a couple features there
really<00:02:42.000> to<00:02:42.269> need<00:02:42.510> to<00:02:42.629> change<00:02:42.930> in<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.200> future

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:43.579 
really to need to change in the future

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.309 
really to need to change in the future
the<00:02:44.579> other<00:02:44.730> one<00:02:45.150> with<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:45.420> USB<00:02:45.659> connection<00:02:46.200> as

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
the other one with the USB connection as

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:49.250 
the other one with the USB connection as
well<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.709> i<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.609> an<00:02:47.790> HP<00:02:48.150> TouchSmart<00:02:48.840> computer

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
well is i have an HP TouchSmart computer

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.610 
well is i have an HP TouchSmart computer
so<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.799> USB<00:02:50.220> connection<00:02:50.760> for<00:02:51.209> this<00:02:51.450> is<00:02:51.720> down

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:52.620 
so the USB connection for this is down

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.949 
so the USB connection for this is down
towards<00:02:53.010> the<00:02:53.069> bottom<00:02:53.190> of<00:02:53.760> the<00:02:54.120> computer<00:02:54.299> so

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
towards the bottom of the computer so

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.470 
towards the bottom of the computer so
when<00:02:55.739> I<00:02:55.769> try<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.069> plug<00:02:56.220> it<00:02:56.370> in<00:02:56.489> it's<00:02:56.819> this<00:02:57.329> is

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:57.480 
when I try and plug it in it's this is

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.649 
when I try and plug it in it's this is
too<00:02:57.659> tall<00:02:57.930> for<00:02:58.260> it<00:02:58.620> and<00:02:58.889> so<00:02:59.730> what<00:02:59.909> happens<00:03:00.389> is

00:03:00.649 --> 00:03:00.659 
too tall for it and so what happens is

00:03:00.659 --> 00:03:04.160 
too tall for it and so what happens is
that<00:03:01.079> I<00:03:01.590> I<00:03:02.220> can't<00:03:03.120> plug<00:03:03.329> it<00:03:03.450> in<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:03.689> I<00:03:03.780> do<00:03:03.840> need

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
that I I can't plug it in and I do need

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.129 
that I I can't plug it in and I do need
a<00:03:04.200> USB<00:03:04.379> hub<00:03:05.010> in<00:03:05.280> order<00:03:05.879> to<00:03:06.090> plug<00:03:06.750> it<00:03:06.870> into<00:03:07.019> the

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:07.139 
a USB hub in order to plug it into the

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.569 
a USB hub in order to plug it into the
computer<00:03:07.170> but<00:03:07.859> that's<00:03:08.010> not<00:03:08.129> such<00:03:08.310> a<00:03:08.400> big<00:03:08.519> deal

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:08.579 
computer but that's not such a big deal

00:03:08.579 --> 00:03:10.610 
computer but that's not such a big deal
a<00:03:08.760> lot<00:03:08.939> of<00:03:09.090> us<00:03:09.150> do<00:03:09.329> have<00:03:09.359> the<00:03:09.659> USB<00:03:09.900> hubs<00:03:10.260> anyway

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
a lot of us do have the USB hubs anyway

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.059 
a lot of us do have the USB hubs anyway
so<00:03:10.680> that's<00:03:11.579> not<00:03:11.879> as<00:03:12.060> big<00:03:12.359> of<00:03:12.420> a<00:03:12.540> deal<00:03:12.659> but

00:03:13.059 --> 00:03:13.069 
so that's not as big of a deal but

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:16.819 
so that's not as big of a deal but
overall<00:03:14.069> I<00:03:14.220> do<00:03:14.340> like<00:03:14.459> it<00:03:15.230> the<00:03:16.230> other<00:03:16.379> camera

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:16.829 
overall I do like it the other camera

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:18.890 
overall I do like it the other camera
that<00:03:16.980> i<00:03:17.010> have<00:03:17.250> been<00:03:17.370> using<00:03:17.549> is<00:03:17.819> the<00:03:18.000> kodak<00:03:18.569> zi8

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
that i have been using is the kodak zi8

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.830 
that i have been using is the kodak zi8

it's a relatively new one it does have a

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.839 
it's a relatively new one it does have a
lot<00:03:22.019> more<00:03:22.139> flexible<00:03:22.680> shooting<00:03:23.160> options<00:03:23.340> for

00:03:23.839 --> 00:03:23.849 
lot more flexible shooting options for

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:28.889 
can shoot it to up 720 which would be

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.189 
can shoot it to up 720 which would be
youtube<00:03:29.579> compatible<00:03:30.329> and<00:03:30.510> they<00:03:30.810> also<00:03:30.959> have<00:03:31.169> a

sports<00:03:36.090> shooting<00:03:36.599> that<00:03:37.500> is<00:03:37.739> quite<00:03:38.459> a<00:03:38.549> bit<00:03:38.699> of

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
sports shooting that is quite a bit of

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.030 
sports shooting that is quite a bit of
flexibility<00:03:39.419> for<00:03:39.750> just<00:03:40.290> about<00:03:40.379> any<00:03:40.620> shooting

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
situation as well it has a snapshot type

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.289 
situation as well it has a snapshot type
feature<00:03:46.590> so<00:03:46.919> you<00:03:46.979> can<00:03:47.220> use<00:03:47.400> this<00:03:47.639> device<00:03:47.849> as

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:48.299 
feature so you can use this device as

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.050 
feature so you can use this device as
both<00:03:48.629> a<00:03:48.870> video<00:03:49.229> camera<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.799> a<00:03:50.310> still<00:03:50.729> camera

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
both a video camera and a still camera

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.170 
both a video camera and a still camera
in<00:03:51.449> the<00:03:51.659> same<00:03:51.930> same<00:03:52.919> device<00:03:53.190> so<00:03:53.489> that<00:03:53.519> really

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
in the same same device so that really

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.809 
in the same same device so that really
saves<00:03:54.810> a<00:03:54.930> lot<00:03:55.109> of<00:03:55.169> room<00:03:55.859> in<00:03:56.040> your<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.489> your

00:03:56.809 --> 00:03:56.819 
saves a lot of room in your in your

00:03:56.819 --> 00:03:59.089 
saves a lot of room in your in your
briefcase<00:03:57.180> for<00:03:58.139> that<00:03:58.349> when<00:03:58.560> you're<00:03:58.680> doing<00:03:59.010> an

00:03:59.089 --> 00:03:59.099 
briefcase for that when you're doing an

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:02.030 
briefcase for that when you're doing an
event<00:03:59.540> the<00:04:00.540> one<00:04:00.690> thing<00:04:00.870> i<00:04:01.379> don't<00:04:01.530> like<00:04:01.889> about

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:02.040 
event the one thing i don't like about

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.189 
event the one thing i don't like about
the<00:04:02.790> zi8<00:04:03.180> is<00:04:03.690> the<00:04:04.650> editing<00:04:05.129> software<00:04:05.669> it<00:04:05.879> is<00:04:06.359> so

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:07.199 
the zi8 is the editing software it is so

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:11.780 
the zi8 is the editing software it is so
unintuitive<00:04:07.829> it's<00:04:08.569> ridiculous<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:10.680> is<00:04:11.250> it's

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
unintuitive it's ridiculous it is it's

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.520 
unintuitive it's ridiculous it is it's
really<00:04:11.970> bad<00:04:12.419> also<00:04:12.870> especially<00:04:13.109> if<00:04:13.440> you

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:13.530 
really bad also especially if you

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.699 
really bad also especially if you
accidentally<00:04:14.159> shoot<00:04:14.459> in<00:04:14.790> 1080<00:04:15.540> and<00:04:15.900> HD<00:04:16.409> and

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:16.709 
accidentally shoot in 1080 and HD and

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:19.909 
accidentally shoot in 1080 and HD and
you<00:04:17.039> try<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:17.370> edit<00:04:17.519> it<00:04:17.789> the<00:04:18.599> sound<00:04:18.900> is<00:04:19.229> running

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
you try and edit it the sound is running

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:24.350 
you try and edit it the sound is running
away<00:04:20.039> with<00:04:20.329> the<00:04:21.329> the<00:04:21.989> video<00:04:22.460> replay<00:04:23.460> and

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
away with the the video replay and

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.439 
away with the the video replay and
and<00:04:24.449> the<00:04:25.099> visual<00:04:26.099> is<00:04:26.310> not<00:04:26.550> keeping<00:04:27.000> up<00:04:27.150> so<00:04:27.389> you

00:04:27.439 --> 00:04:27.449 
and the visual is not keeping up so you

00:04:27.449 --> 00:04:30.770 
and the visual is not keeping up so you
really<00:04:27.870> can't<00:04:28.259> sync<00:04:28.800> up<00:04:29.060> what<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.210> going<00:04:30.569> on

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:30.780 
really can't sync up what is going on

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.170 
really can't sync up what is going on
and<00:04:31.289> you<00:04:31.409> can't<00:04:31.680> really<00:04:32.159> edit<00:04:32.430> it<00:04:32.669> very<00:04:32.939> well

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:33.180 
and you can't really edit it very well

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.860 
and you can't really edit it very well
so<00:04:33.689> what<00:04:34.680> you'll<00:04:34.800> also<00:04:35.009> find<00:04:35.370> is<00:04:35.639> that<00:04:36.060> when

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
so what you'll also find is that when

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.959 
so what you'll also find is that when
you<00:04:36.990> do<00:04:37.169> shoot<00:04:37.379> in<00:04:37.500> 1080<00:04:37.949> it<00:04:38.189> kind<00:04:38.430> of<00:04:38.490> shrinks

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:38.969 
you do shoot in 1080 it kind of shrinks

00:04:38.969 --> 00:04:41.480 
you do shoot in 1080 it kind of shrinks
it<00:04:39.090> down<00:04:39.330> so<00:04:39.810> that<00:04:39.840> you<00:04:40.139> can<00:04:40.500> upload<00:04:41.250> it<00:04:41.370> to

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
it down so that you can upload it to

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.059 
it down so that you can upload it to
youtube<00:04:41.939> so<00:04:42.479> you<00:04:42.509> have<00:04:42.810> this<00:04:42.930> big<00:04:43.259> black<00:04:43.560> frame

00:04:44.059 --> 00:04:44.069 
youtube so you have this big black frame

00:04:44.069 --> 00:04:47.779 
youtube so you have this big black frame
around<00:04:44.430> your<00:04:45.150> video<00:04:45.830> even<00:04:46.830> when<00:04:46.949> I<00:04:46.979> did<00:04:47.370> shoot

00:04:47.779 --> 00:04:47.789 
around your video even when I did shoot

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:50.540 
around your video even when I did shoot
with<00:04:48.000> 720<00:04:48.599> which<00:04:48.750> is<00:04:48.930> you<00:04:49.169> two<00:04:49.560> compatible<00:04:50.340> it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.019 
had this black bar at the top and bottom
when<00:04:53.759> I<00:04:53.789> did<00:04:54.030> upload<00:04:54.330> it<00:04:54.629> to<00:04:54.750> YouTube<00:04:56.029> similar

00:04:57.019 --> 00:04:57.029 
when I did upload it to YouTube similar

00:04:57.029 --> 00:04:59.240 
when I did upload it to YouTube similar
to<00:04:57.240> what<00:04:57.479> you<00:04:57.599> would<00:04:57.629> experience<00:04:58.199> if<00:04:58.620> you<00:04:58.919> are

standard squarish television that's

00:05:05.879 --> 00:05:10.879 
standard squarish television that's

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:19.529 
same shoot snapshot feature which is the

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:21.980 
same shoot snapshot feature which is the
camera<00:05:19.860> feature<00:05:20.099> I<00:05:20.430> was<00:05:21.210> really<00:05:21.509> surprised

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
camera feature I was really surprised

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.309 
camera feature I was really surprised
the<00:05:22.289> the<00:05:23.180> pictures<00:05:24.180> took<00:05:24.569> up<00:05:24.779> about<00:05:25.020> as<00:05:25.169> much

00:05:25.309 --> 00:05:25.319 
the the pictures took up about as much

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.649 
the the pictures took up about as much
space<00:05:25.650> as<00:05:25.710> my<00:05:26.250> standard<00:05:26.759> digital<00:05:26.969> camera<00:05:27.629> that

00:05:27.649 --> 00:05:27.659 
space as my standard digital camera that

00:05:27.659 --> 00:05:30.350 
space as my standard digital camera that
I<00:05:27.840> had<00:05:28.110> from<00:05:28.379> years<00:05:28.680> back<00:05:28.889> but<00:05:29.210> the<00:05:30.210> resolution

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.360 
I had from years back but the resolution

00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:32.149 
I had from years back but the resolution
wasn't<00:05:31.139> that<00:05:31.289> good<00:05:31.529> they<00:05:31.860> were<00:05:31.919> a<00:05:32.009> little

00:05:32.149 --> 00:05:32.159 
wasn't that good they were a little

00:05:32.159 --> 00:05:35.149 
wasn't that good they were a little
fuzzy<00:05:32.900> I<00:05:33.900> think<00:05:34.379> the<00:05:34.440> cameras<00:05:34.740> just<00:05:34.830> trying<00:05:35.099> to

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:35.159 
fuzzy I think the cameras just trying to

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:38.899 
fuzzy I think the cameras just trying to
do<00:05:35.310> too<00:05:35.759> many<00:05:35.909> things<00:05:36.139> i<00:05:37.139> do<00:05:37.740> like<00:05:38.250> also<00:05:38.759> the

do too many things i do like also the

do too many things i do like also the

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
connection similar to the flip that it

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:45.680 
connection similar to the flip that it
does<00:05:43.050> have<00:05:43.099> YouTube<00:05:44.099> like<00:05:44.759> the<00:05:44.940> USB<00:05:45.449> Drive

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.540 
particular computer but with the editing
software<00:05:58.050> there<00:05:58.169> was<00:05:58.289> one<00:05:58.620> good<00:05:58.860> thing<00:05:58.919> I<00:05:59.250> did

00:05:59.540 --> 00:05:59.550 
software there was one good thing I did

00:05:59.550 --> 00:06:01.159 
software there was one good thing I did
like<00:05:59.819> about<00:05:59.849> the<00:06:00.210> editing<00:06:00.539> software<00:06:01.050> though

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
like about the editing software though

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:04.610 
like about the editing software though
you<00:06:01.740> could<00:06:01.979> use<00:06:02.939> effects<00:06:03.509> on<00:06:03.810> it<00:06:03.990> you<00:06:04.199> could<00:06:04.379> do

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
you could use effects on it you could do

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.589 
you could use effects on it you could do
black<00:06:05.039> and<00:06:05.279> white<00:06:05.490> you<00:06:05.879> could<00:06:06.029> do<00:06:06.120> a<00:06:06.150> sepia

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
black and white you could do a sepia

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:09.950 
black and white you could do a sepia
tone<00:06:07.580> you<00:06:08.580> can<00:06:08.759> do<00:06:08.909> a<00:06:08.939> lot<00:06:09.360> of<00:06:09.419> different

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:09.960 
tone you can do a lot of different

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.290 
tone you can do a lot of different
things<00:06:09.990> it<00:06:10.500> just<00:06:10.560> to<00:06:11.039> be<00:06:11.219> very<00:06:11.250> very<00:06:11.550> creative

00:06:12.290 --> 00:06:12.300 
things it just to be very very creative

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.719 
things it just to be very very creative
so<00:06:12.569> I<00:06:12.750> really<00:06:13.439> didn't<00:06:13.710> like<00:06:13.740> that<00:06:14.159> about<00:06:14.339> it

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:14.729 
so I really didn't like that about it

00:06:14.729 --> 00:06:18.200 
so I really didn't like that about it
but<00:06:15.539> I<00:06:15.810> don't<00:06:16.050> know<00:06:16.349> if<00:06:16.500> it's<00:06:16.650> enough<00:06:16.849> to<00:06:17.849> get

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
but I don't know if it's enough to get

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:21.740 
but I don't know if it's enough to get
it<00:06:18.419> over<00:06:18.810> to<00:06:19.099> make<00:06:20.099> it<00:06:20.279> a<00:06:20.460> favorite<00:06:21.150> editing

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:21.750 
it over to make it a favorite editing

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.809 
it over to make it a favorite editing
software<00:06:22.199> I<00:06:22.349> was<00:06:22.860> having<00:06:23.189> some<00:06:23.339> troubles<00:06:23.729> with

00:06:23.809 --> 00:06:23.819 
software I was having some troubles with

00:06:23.819 --> 00:06:26.540 
software I was having some troubles with
the<00:06:24.029> softer<00:06:24.360> as<00:06:24.509> i<00:06:25.259> mentioned<00:06:25.800> i<00:06:25.860> did<00:06:26.219> try<00:06:26.370> and
