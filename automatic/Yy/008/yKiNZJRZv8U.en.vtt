you how I like to make my exterior skin
with<00:00:16.859> fiber<00:00:17.070> board<00:00:17.340> I<00:00:17.490> used<00:00:17.640> 18<00:00:18.000> inch

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
with fiber board I used 18 inch

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.939 
with fiber board I used 18 inch
fiberboard<00:00:18.750> of<00:00:18.960> just<00:00:19.170> because<00:00:19.439> it's<00:00:19.650> cheap

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
on the exterior and again as I've

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.810

discussed in tutorial videos you want to

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.979 
discussed in tutorial videos you want to
make<00:00:38.940> sure<00:00:38.969> that<00:00:39.149> when<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.480> lay<00:00:39.629> down<00:00:39.840> your

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
make sure that when you lay down your

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.869 
make sure that when you lay down your
wall<00:00:40.230> frames<00:00:40.590> on<00:00:40.860> to<00:00:41.010> these<00:00:41.129> skin<00:00:41.399> panels<00:00:41.790> that

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
wall frames on to these skin panels that

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.360 
wall frames on to these skin panels that
you<00:00:42.030> know<00:00:42.210> which<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.140> is<00:00:43.290> properly<00:00:43.680> facing<00:00:44.219> in

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
you know which way is properly facing in

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.639 
you know which way is properly facing in
when<00:00:44.579> you<00:00:44.670> lay<00:00:44.789> those<00:00:44.940> wall<00:00:45.149> panels<00:00:45.930> on<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.500> the

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
when you lay those wall panels on to the

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.590 
when you lay those wall panels on to the
fiber<00:00:46.860> board<00:00:47.100> meeting<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.640> usually<00:00:48.149> lay<00:00:48.480> it

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
fiber board meeting I usually lay it

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.540 
fiber board meeting I usually lay it
down<00:00:48.809> so<00:00:49.140> that<00:00:49.170> the<00:00:49.379> smooth<00:00:49.920> side<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.340> face

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
down so that the smooth side is face

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:52.160 
down so that the smooth side is face
down<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:51.030> rough<00:00:51.239> hatch<00:00:51.480> door<00:00:51.899> across<00:00:52.050> the

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
down the rough hatch door across the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.010 
down the rough hatch door across the
grain<00:00:52.500> side<00:00:52.770> is<00:00:52.980> face<00:00:53.190> up<00:00:53.660> but<00:00:54.660> when<00:00:54.780> you<00:00:54.870> do

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
grain side is face up but when you do

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.630 
grain side is face up but when you do
that<00:00:55.260> it's<00:00:55.500> also<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.829> good<00:00:55.920> idea<00:00:55.980> to<00:00:56.280> make<00:00:56.520> sure

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
that it's also a good idea to make sure

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
that it's also a good idea to make sure
you<00:00:56.730> lay<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:56.910> down<00:00:57.180> on<00:00:57.239> a<00:00:57.449> really<00:00:57.780> clean<00:00:58.050> floor

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
you lay it down on a really clean floor

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.010 
you lay it down on a really clean floor
so<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.039> you<00:00:59.280> don't<00:00:59.460> scratch<00:00:59.820> up<00:01:00.120> your<00:01:00.359> smooth

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
so that you don't scratch up your smooth

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.590 
so that you don't scratch up your smooth
side<00:01:01.320> because<00:01:01.920> once<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.219> paint<00:01:02.460> it<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.390> will

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
side because once you paint it you will

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.780 
side because once you paint it you will
have<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.780> tendency<00:01:04.229> to<00:01:04.260> see<00:01:04.559> smile<00:01:04.920> small<00:01:05.580> or

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
have a tendency to see smile small or

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.270 
have a tendency to see smile small or
fine<00:01:06.030> scratches<00:01:06.479> on<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> exterior<00:01:07.439> so<00:01:08.100> if<00:01:08.189> you

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
fine scratches on the exterior so if you

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.460 
fine scratches on the exterior so if you
have<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> sheet<00:01:08.909> or<00:01:08.939> maybe<00:01:09.510> some<00:01:09.750> carpet<00:01:10.229> or

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
have a sheet or maybe some carpet or

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.770 
have a sheet or maybe some carpet or
some<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:11.340> know<00:01:11.369> construction<00:01:12.030> style<00:01:12.270> carpet

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
some you know construction style carpet

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.140 
some you know construction style carpet
is<00:01:12.900> what<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.080> have<00:01:13.350> actually<00:01:13.740> in<00:01:13.830> my<00:01:13.950> garage<00:01:14.150> I

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
is what I have actually in my garage I

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.700 
is what I have actually in my garage I
just<00:01:15.659> make<00:01:15.810> sure<00:01:15.930> I've<00:01:16.049> got<00:01:16.080> a<00:01:16.229> clean<00:01:16.470> work

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
just make sure I've got a clean work

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.469 
just make sure I've got a clean work
surface<00:01:16.740> to<00:01:17.280> then<00:01:17.430> lay<00:01:17.610> that<00:01:17.790> Smith<00:01:18.060> side<00:01:18.330> down

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
surface to then lay that Smith side down

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.240 
surface to then lay that Smith side down
onto<00:01:18.689> before<00:01:19.140> I<00:01:19.200> mark<00:01:19.470> out<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.650> wall<00:01:19.950> frames

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
onto before I mark out the wall frames

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.280 
onto before I mark out the wall frames
so<00:01:20.820> that's<00:01:21.000> a<00:01:21.119> really<00:01:21.150> helpful<00:01:21.630> tip<00:01:21.930> something

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
so that's a really helpful tip something

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.260 
so that's a really helpful tip something
to<00:01:22.350> keep<00:01:22.470> in<00:01:22.590> mind<00:01:22.650> but<00:01:23.400> anyway<00:01:23.729> once<00:01:23.970> you<00:01:24.090> have

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
by four so that you know where your

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.899 
by four so that you know where your
screws<00:01:40.590> are<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:40.979> be<00:01:41.100> placed<00:01:41.369> and

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
screws are going to be placed and

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.270 
screws are going to be placed and
therefore<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.720> want<00:01:42.930> to<00:01:42.990> make<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> line<00:01:43.530> mark

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
therefore you want to make a line mark

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.639 
therefore you want to make a line mark
down<00:01:44.579> the<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.939> center<00:01:45.540> of<00:01:45.570> your<00:01:46.320> two<00:01:46.500> by

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
down the very center of your two by

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.190 
down the very center of your two by
fours<00:01:47.000> and<00:01:48.000> how<00:01:48.210> you<00:01:48.299> can<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.960> is

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
fours and how you can do this is

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.780 
fours and how you can do this is
obviously<00:01:49.409> you<00:01:49.799> can<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.009> with<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> ruler<00:01:50.430> and

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
obviously you can do with a ruler and

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.429 
obviously you can do with a ruler and
you're<00:01:50.909> going<00:01:51.000> to<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.240> to<00:01:51.390> you<00:01:51.899> know<00:01:52.020> go<00:01:52.200> down

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
you're going to have to you know go down

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:55.399 
you're going to have to you know go down
each<00:01:53.009> piece<00:01:54.000> of<00:01:54.180> two<00:01:54.299> by<00:01:54.329> four<00:01:54.689> material<00:01:55.170> to

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
each piece of two by four material to

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.200 
each piece of two by four material to
try<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.770> make<00:01:55.890> a<00:01:55.920> center<00:01:56.250> line<00:01:56.430> down<00:01:57.180> the

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
try and make a center line down the

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.179 
try and make a center line down the
exact<00:01:57.659> center<00:01:57.960> that's<00:01:58.170> kind<00:01:58.439> of<00:01:58.500> a<00:01:58.590> pain<00:01:58.829> to<00:01:58.860> do

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
exact center that's kind of a pain to do

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.789 
exact center that's kind of a pain to do
so<00:01:59.490> what<00:01:59.670> I<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.930> from<00:02:00.930> what<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.110> found<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.530> a<00:02:01.560> lot

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:01.799 
so what I do from what I found is a lot

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:04.760 
so what I do from what I found is a lot
easier<00:02:01.829> is<00:02:02.399> I've<00:02:03.030> got<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> piece<00:02:03.479> of<00:02:03.509> oak<00:02:04.140> strip

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
easier is I've got a piece of oak strip

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.350 
easier is I've got a piece of oak strip
here<00:02:05.100> that<00:02:05.430> have<00:02:05.610> gotten<00:02:05.759> from<00:02:06.060> home<00:02:06.210> depot

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
here that have gotten from home depot

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:08.809 
here that have gotten from home depot

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
and it's three quarter inches wide this

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.550 
and it's three quarter inches wide this
is<00:02:08.970> something<00:02:09.119> I<00:02:09.330> used<00:02:09.539> for<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.780> smaller<00:02:10.080> fence

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
is something I used for a smaller fence

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:12.380 
is something I used for a smaller fence
clamp<00:02:10.890> that<00:02:11.039> I<00:02:11.099> used<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> make<00:02:11.550> straight<00:02:12.209> edge

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:12.390 
clamp that I used to make straight edge

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.990 
clamp that I used to make straight edge
cuts<00:02:12.660> with

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:30.610 
and straight and that's why I use oak

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:32.130 
and straight and that's why I use oak
because<00:02:31.030> it's<00:02:31.209> just<00:02:31.240> a<00:02:31.390> really<00:02:31.630> good<00:02:31.750> hardwood

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
because it's just a really good hardwood

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:34.260 
because it's just a really good hardwood
and<00:02:32.410> the<00:02:32.980> last<00:02:33.220> long<00:02:33.490> time<00:02:33.760> makes<00:02:34.090> a<00:02:34.150> good

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:34.270 
and the last long time makes a good

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:36.660 
and the last long time makes a good
marking<00:02:34.630> edge<00:02:34.810> so<00:02:35.740> basically<00:02:36.160> I've<00:02:36.280> taken<00:02:36.459> my

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
marking edge so basically I've taken my

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:38.340 
marking edge so basically I've taken my
metal<00:02:37.060> tape<00:02:37.300> measure<00:02:37.540> which<00:02:37.780> or<00:02:38.020> it's<00:02:38.140> getting

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:38.350 
metal tape measure which or it's getting

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:40.020 
metal tape measure which or it's getting
a<00:02:38.410> metal<00:02:38.980> ruler<00:02:39.130> which<00:02:39.400> have<00:02:39.550> also<00:02:39.820> suggested

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
a metal ruler which have also suggested

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:42.360 
a metal ruler which have also suggested
buying<00:02:40.540> from<00:02:40.750> an<00:02:40.870> art<00:02:40.990> supply<00:02:41.170> store<00:02:41.650> and<00:02:42.310> I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:42.370 
buying from an art supply store and I

buying from an art supply store and I
make<00:02:42.550> sure<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.790> you<00:02:43.180> know<00:02:43.300> it<00:02:43.390> is<00:02:43.630> indeed

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.020 
make sure that you know it is indeed

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:46.140 
make sure that you know it is indeed
three<00:02:44.680> quarter<00:02:44.980> inches<00:02:45.280> wide<00:02:45.550> and<00:02:45.850> it<00:02:46.000> is

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
three quarter inches wide and it is

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.470 
three quarter inches wide and it is
three-quarter<00:02:46.840> inch<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.850> then<00:02:48.970> so<00:02:49.120> to<00:02:49.180> mark

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
three-quarter inch and then so to mark

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.510 
three-quarter inch and then so to mark
if<00:02:49.989> you<00:02:50.140> notice<00:02:50.410> in<00:02:50.530> earlier<00:02:50.830> videos<00:02:50.980> I<00:02:51.310> also

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
if you notice in earlier videos I also

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.420 
if you notice in earlier videos I also
suggested<00:02:52.360> that<00:02:52.570> you<00:02:53.500> make<00:02:53.770> sure<00:02:54.040> that<00:02:54.310> your

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:54.430 
suggested that you make sure that your

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.610 
suggested that you make sure that your
top<00:02:54.670> edges<00:02:55.090> and<00:02:55.300> rear<00:02:55.480> edges<00:02:55.900> of<00:02:56.170> the<00:02:56.410> sim

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
top edges and rear edges of the sim

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.440 
top edges and rear edges of the sim
cockpit<00:02:57.130> are<00:02:57.310> actually<00:02:57.880> an<00:02:57.970> eighth<00:02:58.180> of<00:02:58.330> an

going to be an inch and five-eighths
rather<00:03:12.040> than<00:03:12.310> just<00:03:12.730> an<00:03:12.880> inch<00:03:13.060> and<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> half<00:03:13.270> and

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:13.840 
rather than just an inch and a half and

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:15.630 
rather than just an inch and a half and
when<00:03:14.380> I<00:03:14.440> say<00:03:14.620> inch<00:03:14.770> and<00:03:14.920> a<00:03:14.950> half<00:03:14.980> i'm<00:03:15.310> talking

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:15.640 
when I say inch and a half i'm talking

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:17.460 
when I say inch and a half i'm talking
about<00:03:15.670> the<00:03:16.030> the<00:03:16.390> width<00:03:16.630> of<00:03:16.780> the<00:03:16.870> two-by-four

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
about the the width of the two-by-four

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.920 
about the the width of the two-by-four
and<00:03:18.400> so<00:03:18.850> because<00:03:19.209> of<00:03:19.239> that<00:03:19.420> when<00:03:19.570> you're<00:03:19.750> going

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
and so because of that when you're going

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:21.210 
and so because of that when you're going
to<00:03:20.019> mark<00:03:20.260> out<00:03:20.440> where<00:03:20.470> that<00:03:20.709> three<00:03:20.950> quarter

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:21.220 
to mark out where that three quarter

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:22.620 
to mark out where that three quarter
inch<00:03:21.370> dimension<00:03:21.790> needs<00:03:21.940> to<00:03:22.120> go<00:03:22.239> for<00:03:22.510> your

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
inch dimension needs to go for your

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.150 
inch dimension needs to go for your
screws<00:03:23.080> you're<00:03:23.350> going<00:03:23.470> to<00:03:23.530> mark<00:03:23.709> this<00:03:23.890> now

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:24.160 
screws you're going to mark this now

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.580 
screws you're going to mark this now
from<00:03:24.459> the<00:03:24.580> inside<00:03:25.090> edge<00:03:25.330> so<00:03:25.989> you<00:03:26.080> can<00:03:26.230> see<00:03:26.380> here

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
from the inside edge so you can see here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:27.900 
from the inside edge so you can see here
that<00:03:26.620> I've<00:03:26.830> marked<00:03:27.040> out<00:03:27.190> my<00:03:27.340> too<00:03:27.400> much<00:03:27.640> force

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:27.910 
that I've marked out my too much force

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:30.270 
that I've marked out my too much force
and<00:03:28.000> already<00:03:28.930> this<00:03:29.140> is<00:03:29.200> wall<00:03:29.530> frame<00:03:29.799> section

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
and already this is wall frame section

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.240 
and already this is wall frame section
that<00:03:30.400> was<00:03:30.459> a<00:03:30.519> wall<00:03:30.700> frame<00:03:30.940> section<00:03:31.420> and<00:03:32.380> now<00:03:32.860> I

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:33.250 
that was a wall frame section and now I

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:36.090 
that was a wall frame section and now I
want<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.880> mark<00:03:34.150> out<00:03:34.360> a<00:03:34.630> centerline<00:03:35.019> where<00:03:35.950> I'm

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.100 
want to mark out a centerline where I'm

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:38.190 
want to mark out a centerline where I'm
going<00:03:36.250> to<00:03:36.310> make<00:03:36.459> my<00:03:36.640> screw<00:03:36.940> hole<00:03:37.150> so<00:03:37.510> I<00:03:37.750> can

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
going to make my screw hole so I can

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:39.720 
going to make my screw hole so I can
take<00:03:38.410> this<00:03:38.560> straight<00:03:38.920> edge<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.130> place<00:03:39.549> it

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:39.730 
take this straight edge and place it

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.259 
take this straight edge and place it
right<00:03:39.910> there<00:03:40.410> and<00:03:41.410> there<00:03:41.620> we<00:03:41.739> go<00:03:41.910> and<00:03:42.910> make<00:03:43.120> my

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:05.380 
go but basically back to something I

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.840 
go but basically back to something I
also<00:05:05.500> talked<00:05:05.800> about<00:05:05.860> in<00:05:06.070> earlier<00:05:06.340> videos<00:05:06.490> is

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
also talked about in earlier videos is

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:08.430 
also talked about in earlier videos is
spacing<00:05:07.150> your<00:05:07.450> screws<00:05:07.720> properly<00:05:08.229> I'll<00:05:08.320> just

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:08.440 
spacing your screws properly I'll just

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.070 
spacing your screws properly I'll just
review<00:05:08.770> that<00:05:08.919> again<00:05:09.130> quickly<00:05:09.370> right<00:05:09.669> now

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
review that again quickly right now

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.240 
review that again quickly right now
basically<00:05:11.080> now<00:05:11.350> that<00:05:11.530> I've<00:05:11.650> got<00:05:11.800> all<00:05:11.889> my<00:05:11.919> lines

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
basically now that I've got all my lines

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.830 
basically now that I've got all my lines
marked<00:05:12.610> out<00:05:12.820> where<00:05:12.970> the<00:05:13.030> screw<00:05:13.270> heads<00:05:13.479> need<00:05:13.690> to

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
marked out where the screw heads need to

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:16.050 
marked out where the screw heads need to
go<00:05:14.050> I'm<00:05:14.530> going<00:05:14.800> to<00:05:14.860> take<00:05:15.070> a<00:05:15.130> total<00:05:15.580> measurement

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
go I'm going to take a total measurement

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.909 
go I'm going to take a total measurement
and<00:05:16.750> let's<00:05:16.990> just<00:05:17.169> say<00:05:17.260> for<00:05:17.290> example<00:05:17.530> this

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:17.919 
and let's just say for example this

00:05:17.919 --> 00:05:20.760 
and let's just say for example this
measurement<00:05:18.340> appears<00:05:18.610> 36<00:05:19.300> from<00:05:20.169> that

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:20.770 
measurement appears 36 from that

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.260 
measurement appears 36 from that
distance<00:05:21.130> of<00:05:21.310> that<00:05:21.370> distance<00:05:21.669> it's<00:05:21.910> not<00:05:22.060> it's

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:22.270 
distance of that distance it's not it's

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:23.670 
distance of that distance it's not it's
obviously<00:05:22.690> longer<00:05:23.050> you'll<00:05:23.200> have<00:05:23.320> to<00:05:23.410> consult

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
obviously longer you'll have to consult

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.170 
obviously longer you'll have to consult
your<00:05:23.830> blueprints<00:05:24.340> and<00:05:24.460> builder<00:05:24.669> Manuel<00:05:24.850> for

00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:25.180 
your blueprints and builder Manuel for

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:27.030 
your blueprints and builder Manuel for
that<00:05:25.300> but<00:05:26.169> basically<00:05:26.500> where<00:05:26.710> these<00:05:26.830> two<00:05:27.010> lines

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.040 
that but basically where these two lines

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:29.310 
that but basically where these two lines
intersect<00:05:27.370> I<00:05:28.000> think<00:05:28.690> that<00:05:28.840> would<00:05:28.960> be<00:05:29.020> fun<00:05:29.290> to

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:29.320 
intersect I think that would be fun to

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:31.560 
intersect I think that would be fun to
make<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.650> screw<00:05:29.950> there<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.490> I've<00:05:31.030> come<00:05:31.450> in

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:31.570 
make a screw there and I've come in

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:32.909 
make a screw there and I've come in
three<00:05:31.780> quarters<00:05:32.110> of<00:05:32.140> an<00:05:32.320> inch<00:05:32.410> here<00:05:32.680> and<00:05:32.830> I'd

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:32.919 
three quarters of an inch here and I'd

00:05:32.919 --> 00:05:34.980 
three quarters of an inch here and I'd
mark<00:05:33.190> and<00:05:33.340> I'd<00:05:33.430> make<00:05:33.580> a<00:05:33.610> screw<00:05:33.910> hole<00:05:34.060> there<00:05:34.300> so

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:34.990 
mark and I'd make a screw hole there so

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:36.450 
mark and I'd make a screw hole there so
let's<00:05:35.200> just<00:05:35.380> say<00:05:35.500> that's<00:05:35.650> that<00:05:36.039> distance

00:05:36.450 --> 00:05:36.460 
let's just say that's that distance

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:39.540 
let's just say that's that distance
between<00:05:36.729> the<00:05:37.240> outer<00:05:37.419> edges<00:05:37.750> are<00:05:38.050> 36<00:05:38.680> but<00:05:39.520> I

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:39.550 
between the outer edges are 36 but I

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:41.310 
between the outer edges are 36 but I
know<00:05:39.760> that<00:05:39.880> I<00:05:40.090> am<00:05:40.270> coming<00:05:40.539> in<00:05:40.810> three<00:05:41.020> quarters

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:41.320 
know that I am coming in three quarters

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.779 
know that I am coming in three quarters
of<00:05:41.350> an<00:05:41.530> inch<00:05:41.650> and<00:05:41.950> three<00:05:42.130> quarters<00:05:42.460> of<00:05:42.550> an<00:05:42.700> inch

00:05:42.779 --> 00:05:42.789 
of an inch and three quarters of an inch

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:47.090 
of an inch and three quarters of an inch
there<00:05:43.140> so<00:05:44.140> I<00:05:44.169> would<00:05:44.380> actually<00:05:44.500> say<00:05:44.740> 36<00:05:45.750> minus

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
there so I would actually say 36 minus

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:51.000 
there so I would actually say 36 minus
1.5<00:05:48.100> inch<00:05:48.520> because<00:05:48.910> point<00:05:49.750> 75<00:05:50.169> and<00:05:50.380> point<00:05:50.560> 75

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:51.010 
1.5 inch because point 75 and point 75

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:53.400 
1.5 inch because point 75 and point 75
is<00:05:51.190> 1.5<00:05:51.729> inch<00:05:51.940> so<00:05:52.150> i'm<00:05:52.210> automatically<00:05:53.020> cutting

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:53.410 
is 1.5 inch so i'm automatically cutting

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:56.340 
is 1.5 inch so i'm automatically cutting
that<00:05:53.530> off<00:05:53.590> and<00:05:54.330> what<00:05:55.330> is<00:05:55.450> that<00:05:55.539> equal<00:05:55.750> well<00:05:56.169> it

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:56.350 
that off and what is that equal well it

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:59.340 
that off and what is that equal well it
equals<00:05:56.620> 34.5<00:05:57.460> so<00:05:57.850> we<00:05:58.600> know<00:05:58.750> that<00:05:58.780> we've<00:05:59.050> got<00:05:59.169> a

00:05:59.340 --> 00:05:59.350 
equals 34.5 so we know that we've got a

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:01.770 
equals 34.5 so we know that we've got a
space<00:05:59.889> distance<00:06:00.430> to<00:06:00.580> work<00:06:00.760> with<00:06:01.000> its<00:06:01.210> left<00:06:01.479> of

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:01.780 
space distance to work with its left of

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:05.520 
space distance to work with its left of
30.5<00:06:02.850> 34.5<00:06:03.850> and<00:06:04.060> now<00:06:04.120> you<00:06:04.180> want<00:06:05.080> to<00:06:05.169> add<00:06:05.289> up<00:06:05.500> how

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:05.530 
30.5 34.5 and now you want to add up how

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:09.090 
30.5 34.5 and now you want to add up how
many<00:06:05.740> spaces<00:06:06.310> you<00:06:07.180> actually<00:06:07.660> want<00:06:07.900> to<00:06:08.169> create

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:09.100 
many spaces you actually want to create

00:06:09.100 --> 00:06:11.640 
many spaces you actually want to create
and<00:06:09.520> those<00:06:09.639> are<00:06:09.789> for<00:06:09.940> your<00:06:10.030> screws<00:06:10.360> so<00:06:10.660> rather

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:11.650 
and those are for your screws so rather

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:13.409 
and those are for your screws so rather
than<00:06:11.919> count<00:06:12.220> how<00:06:12.430> many<00:06:12.490> screws<00:06:13.000> you're<00:06:13.240> going

00:06:13.409 --> 00:06:13.419 
than count how many screws you're going

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.270 
than count how many screws you're going
to<00:06:13.510> use<00:06:13.960> you're<00:06:14.680> going<00:06:14.800> to<00:06:14.860> count<00:06:15.070> how<00:06:15.220> many

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:15.280 
to use you're going to count how many

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.040 
to use you're going to count how many
spaces<00:06:15.669> you<00:06:16.240> want<00:06:16.419> to<00:06:16.510> use<00:06:16.630> I<00:06:16.720> know<00:06:16.900> it's<00:06:17.020> a

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:17.050 
spaces you want to use I know it's a

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:18.719 
spaces you want to use I know it's a
little<00:06:17.110> confusing<00:06:17.380> but<00:06:17.800> this<00:06:18.340> is<00:06:18.490> talked

00:06:18.719 --> 00:06:18.729 
little confusing but this is talked

00:06:18.729 --> 00:06:20.040 
little confusing but this is talked
about<00:06:18.789> in<00:06:18.970> the<00:06:19.060> builder<00:06:19.330> Manuel<00:06:19.510> and<00:06:19.720> explain

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.050 
about in the builder Manuel and explain

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:22.680 
about in the builder Manuel and explain
in<00:06:20.169> more<00:06:20.200> detail<00:06:21.030> but<00:06:22.030> let's<00:06:22.210> say<00:06:22.360> I<00:06:22.389> want<00:06:22.600> to

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:22.690 
in more detail but let's say I want to

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:27.029 
in more detail but let's say I want to
use<00:06:22.810> one<00:06:22.840> two<00:06:23.590> three<00:06:24.370> four<00:06:24.940> five<00:06:25.620> screws<00:06:26.620> and

00:06:27.029 --> 00:06:27.039 
use one two three four five screws and

00:06:27.039 --> 00:06:29.010 
use one two three four five screws and
so<00:06:27.130> that's<00:06:27.250> actually<00:06:27.639> going<00:06:27.789> to<00:06:27.880> leave<00:06:28.060> flip

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
so that's actually going to leave flip

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.409 
so that's actually going to leave flip
but<00:06:29.200> wasn't<00:06:29.440> there<00:06:29.530> one<00:06:30.310> here<00:06:30.669> I<00:06:30.700> think<00:06:31.000> one

00:06:31.409 --> 00:06:31.419 
but wasn't there one here I think one

00:06:31.419 --> 00:06:33.850 
but wasn't there one here I think one
there<00:06:31.810> one<00:06:32.620> there<00:06:32.650> and<00:06:33.280> let's<00:06:33.430> say<00:06:33.580> one

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:33.860 
there one there and let's say one

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:36.429 
there one there and let's say one
there<00:06:34.009> so<00:06:34.360> that<00:06:35.360> would<00:06:35.840> be<00:06:35.870> using<00:06:36.349> an

00:06:36.429 --> 00:06:36.439 
there so that would be using an

00:06:36.439 --> 00:06:39.730 
there so that would be using an
additional<00:06:36.979> one<00:06:37.219> two<00:06:37.550> three<00:06:38.300> four<00:06:39.110> five

00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:39.740 
additional one two three four five

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:41.469 
additional one two three four five
screws<00:06:40.159> but<00:06:40.460> it's<00:06:40.580> actually<00:06:40.729> creating<00:06:41.330> one

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:41.479 
screws but it's actually creating one

00:06:41.479 --> 00:06:46.839 
screws but it's actually creating one
two<00:06:41.780> three<00:06:42.469> four<00:06:43.129> five<00:06:43.659> six<00:06:44.659> spaces<00:06:45.020> so<00:06:45.860> I<00:06:46.159> take

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
two three four five six spaces so I take

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.809 
two three four five six spaces so I take
that<00:06:47.030> number<00:06:47.150> that<00:06:47.419> we<00:06:47.539> were<00:06:47.599> working<00:06:47.719> with<00:06:47.930> 30

00:06:48.809 --> 00:06:48.819 
that number that we were working with 30

00:06:48.819 --> 00:06:51.520 
that number that we were working with 30
34.5<00:06:49.819> and<00:06:50.120> then<00:06:50.210> divide<00:06:50.569> that<00:06:50.780> by<00:06:51.020> the<00:06:51.050> six

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:51.530 
34.5 and then divide that by the six

00:06:51.530 --> 00:06:55.420 
34.5 and then divide that by the six
spaces<00:06:51.830> and<00:06:52.340> that<00:06:52.939> equals<00:06:53.090> an<00:06:53.569> exact<00:06:54.430> 5.75

00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:55.430 
spaces and that equals an exact 5.75

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.760 
spaces and that equals an exact 5.75
simple<00:06:56.330> enough<00:06:56.569> so<00:06:56.810> now<00:06:56.960> I<00:06:56.990> know<00:06:57.169> that<00:06:57.319> each

00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:57.770 
simple enough so now I know that each

00:06:57.770 --> 00:06:59.499 
simple enough so now I know that each
measurement<00:06:58.280> from<00:06:58.580> the<00:06:58.639> outer<00:06:58.879> mark<00:06:59.240> and<00:06:59.449> I

00:06:59.499 --> 00:06:59.509 
measurement from the outer mark and I

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:01.920 
measurement from the outer mark and I
would<00:06:59.659> just<00:06:59.780> start<00:07:00.379> at<00:07:00.500> each<00:07:00.620> end<00:07:01.069> measure

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:01.930 
would just start at each end measure

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.779 
would just start at each end measure
5.75<00:07:02.930> come<00:07:03.409> over<00:07:03.770> from<00:07:03.889> that<00:07:04.009> side<00:07:04.280> measuring

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
5.75 come over from that side measuring

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:07.990 
5.75 come over from that side measuring
5.75<00:07:05.689> and<00:07:06.020> keep<00:07:06.139> going<00:07:06.319> in<00:07:06.650> until<00:07:07.550> you<00:07:07.879> just

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:08.000 
5.75 and keep going in until you just

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.459 
5.75 and keep going in until you just
have<00:07:08.180> whatever<00:07:08.389> space<00:07:08.719> is<00:07:08.900> left<00:07:09.020> over<00:07:09.259> in<00:07:09.439> the

00:07:09.459 --> 00:07:09.469 
have whatever space is left over in the

00:07:09.469 --> 00:07:12.040 
have whatever space is left over in the
middle<00:07:09.740> which<00:07:09.919> should<00:07:10.129> also<00:07:10.310> equal<00:07:10.789> 5.75<00:07:11.719> and

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:12.050 
middle which should also equal 5.75 and

00:07:12.050 --> 00:07:13.899 
middle which should also equal 5.75 and
so<00:07:12.650> that's<00:07:12.770> it<00:07:13.039> that's<00:07:13.159> a<00:07:13.310> simple<00:07:13.580> way<00:07:13.729> if<00:07:13.819> you

00:07:13.899 --> 00:07:13.909 
so that's it that's a simple way if you

00:07:13.909 --> 00:07:15.010 
so that's it that's a simple way if you
come<00:07:14.090> out<00:07:14.210> with<00:07:14.360> a<00:07:14.389> fraction<00:07:14.870> or<00:07:14.960> decimal

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:15.020 
come out with a fraction or decimal

00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:18.309 
come out with a fraction or decimal
point<00:07:15.620> you<00:07:16.159> know<00:07:16.279> there's<00:07:17.169> conversions<00:07:18.169> on

00:07:18.309 --> 00:07:18.319 
point you know there's conversions on

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:20.260 
point you know there's conversions on
the<00:07:18.439> internet<00:07:18.830> for<00:07:19.009> hundreds<00:07:19.610> of<00:07:19.729> an<00:07:19.879> inch<00:07:20.029> and

stuff<00:07:20.449> like<00:07:20.599> that<00:07:20.659> that<00:07:20.870> can<00:07:21.229> help<00:07:21.379> you<00:07:21.500> round

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:21.770 
stuff like that that can help you round

00:07:21.770 --> 00:07:23.200 
stuff like that that can help you round
it<00:07:21.889> up<00:07:22.039> to<00:07:22.099> if<00:07:22.370> it<00:07:22.460> needs<00:07:22.610> to<00:07:22.699> be<00:07:22.819> five<00:07:23.029> eighths

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
it up to if it needs to be five eighths

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:25.269 
it up to if it needs to be five eighths
of<00:07:23.360> an<00:07:23.479> inch<00:07:23.569> or<00:07:23.960> you<00:07:24.680> know<00:07:24.770> something<00:07:25.009> that's

00:07:25.269 --> 00:07:25.279 
of an inch or you know something that's

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:27.730 
of an inch or you know something that's
not<00:07:25.490> exactly<00:07:25.909> like<00:07:26.180> 5.75<00:07:27.110> is<00:07:27.379> but<00:07:27.560> what<00:07:27.710> I

00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:27.740 
not exactly like 5.75 is but what I

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:30.640 
not exactly like 5.75 is but what I
found<00:07:28.009> with<00:07:28.310> all<00:07:28.610> the<00:07:28.819> cs1<00:07:29.330> and<00:07:29.659> all<00:07:29.840> the<00:07:29.960> hx1

00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:30.650 
found with all the cs1 and all the hx1

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.540 
found with all the cs1 and all the hx1
skin<00:07:31.039> panels<00:07:31.490> is<00:07:32.150> that<00:07:32.419> anywhere<00:07:32.810> from<00:07:33.020> about

00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:33.550 
skin panels is that anywhere from about

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:36.879 
skin panels is that anywhere from about
5.5<00:07:34.550> or<00:07:34.580> six<00:07:35.180> up<00:07:35.449> to<00:07:35.750> seven<00:07:36.169> inches<00:07:36.259> is<00:07:36.680> where

00:07:36.879 --> 00:07:36.889 
5.5 or six up to seven inches is where

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.290 
5.5 or six up to seven inches is where
you're<00:07:37.069> going<00:07:37.189> to<00:07:37.279> find<00:07:37.490> all<00:07:37.699> your<00:07:37.849> screws<00:07:38.120> to

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:38.300 
you're going to find all your screws to

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.820 
you're going to find all your screws to
be<00:07:38.419> placed<00:07:38.719> nice<00:07:39.020> and<00:07:39.229> even<00:07:39.440> you<00:07:39.560> don't<00:07:39.650> really

00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:39.830 
be placed nice and even you don't really

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:41.110 
be placed nice and even you don't really
want<00:07:40.069> to<00:07:40.099> go<00:07:40.219> smaller<00:07:40.490> than<00:07:40.699> that<00:07:40.849> you<00:07:41.000> don't

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:41.120 
want to go smaller than that you don't

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.430 
want to go smaller than that you don't
want<00:07:41.270> to<00:07:41.330> go<00:07:41.389> larger<00:07:41.569> than<00:07:41.870> that<00:07:42.050> so<00:07:42.259> just

00:07:42.430 --> 00:07:42.440 
want to go larger than that so just

00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:45.760 
want to go larger than that so just
think<00:07:42.770> you<00:07:43.460> know<00:07:43.580> anywhere<00:07:43.969> from<00:07:44.289> say<00:07:45.289> six<00:07:45.620> to

00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:45.770 
think you know anywhere from say six to

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:47.589 
think you know anywhere from say six to
seven<00:07:46.069> inches<00:07:46.159> is<00:07:46.520> ideal<00:07:47.000> for<00:07:47.240> your<00:07:47.360> screw

00:07:47.589 --> 00:07:47.599 
seven inches is ideal for your screw

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:49.930 
seven inches is ideal for your screw
spacing<00:07:48.139> around<00:07:48.349> the<00:07:48.919> entire<00:07:49.190> perimeter<00:07:49.250> and

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:49.940 
spacing around the entire perimeter and

00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:51.999 
spacing around the entire perimeter and
on<00:07:50.060> your<00:07:50.210> wall<00:07:50.360> frames<00:07:50.629> and<00:07:50.870> so<00:07:51.440> that's<00:07:51.650> it<00:07:51.860> for

00:07:51.999 --> 00:07:52.009 
on your wall frames and so that's it for

00:07:52.009 --> 00:07:54.219 
on your wall frames and so that's it for
finishing<00:07:52.879> up<00:07:53.120> the<00:07:53.210> skin<00:07:53.419> panels<00:07:53.839> and
