time it will have a great impact on

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:14.539 
time it will have a great impact on
people<00:03:12.750> it<00:03:13.019> will<00:03:13.170> improve<00:03:13.530> the<00:03:13.739> diagnosis<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
people it will improve the diagnosis and

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.460 
people it will improve the diagnosis and
treatment<00:03:15.060> get<00:03:15.299> them<00:03:15.450> better<00:03:15.659> treatment<00:03:16.260> and

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
treatment get them better treatment and

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.129 
treatment get them better treatment and
hopefully<00:03:17.310> render<00:03:18.120> them<00:03:18.239> seizure<00:03:18.629> free<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
hopefully render them seizure free I

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.020 
hopefully render them seizure free I
mean<00:03:19.769> seventy<00:03:20.160> percent<00:03:20.280> of<00:03:20.669> people<00:03:20.790> with

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
mean seventy percent of people with

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.939 
mean seventy percent of people with
epilepsy<00:03:21.180> can<00:03:21.870> become<00:03:22.230> seizure<00:03:22.530> for<00:03:22.829> your

00:03:22.939 --> 00:03:22.949 
epilepsy can become seizure for your

00:03:22.949 --> 00:03:25.250 
epilepsy can become seizure for your
medication<00:03:23.669> but<00:03:24.359> the<00:03:24.449> research<00:03:24.870> has<00:03:25.049> shown

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
medication but the research has shown

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.559 
medication but the research has shown
fifty<00:03:25.799> percent<00:03:26.099> of<00:03:26.310> people<00:03:26.489> actually<00:03:26.940> are<00:03:27.239> not

00:03:27.559 --> 00:03:27.569 
fifty percent of people actually are not

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:29.509 
fifty percent of people actually are not
seizure<00:03:27.840> free<00:03:28.199> so<00:03:28.680> if<00:03:28.799> this<00:03:29.010> will<00:03:29.220> improve

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:29.519 
seizure free so if this will improve

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:31.039 
seizure free so if this will improve
this<00:03:29.790> is<00:03:29.970> your<00:03:30.120> freedom<00:03:30.329> that<00:03:30.629> will<00:03:30.810> improve
