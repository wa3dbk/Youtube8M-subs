 we connect to give you your pokémon 

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.190
 it's as simple as that to do this but 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:35.490
 you just have to leave me a 

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:38.400
 comment below your clear friends and 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.380
 when you sow you would have the time 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.180
 to exchange because mind that 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.870

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:50.000
