00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:01.860 
everyone it's proudly I'm making this

00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:03.169 
everyone it's proudly I'm making this
video<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.220> show<00:00:02.520> you<00:00:02.550> guys<00:00:02.669> how<00:00:02.820> to<00:00:03.000> adjust

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:03.179 
video to show you guys how to adjust

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:05.539 
video to show you guys how to adjust
your<00:00:03.570> tail<00:00:03.899> rotor<00:00:04.110> on<00:00:04.259> your<00:00:04.380> t-rex<00:00:04.740> 250<00:00:05.250> I<00:00:05.279> had

00:00:05.539 --> 00:00:05.549 
your tail rotor on your t-rex 250 I had

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.089 
your tail rotor on your t-rex 250 I had
some<00:00:05.850> issues<00:00:06.600> with<00:00:07.020> this<00:00:07.140> the<00:00:07.410> way<00:00:07.529> I<00:00:07.560> set<00:00:07.919> mine

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
some issues with this the way I set mine

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.060 
some issues with this the way I set mine
up<00:00:08.809> as<00:00:09.809> per<00:00:10.080> the<00:00:10.200> instructions<00:00:10.830> which

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:13.070 
up as per the instructions which

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:14.990 
up as per the instructions which
actually<00:00:14.070> don't<00:00:14.219> really<00:00:14.309> show<00:00:14.670> you<00:00:14.759> how<00:00:14.940> to

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
actually don't really show you how to

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.950 
actually don't really show you how to
put<00:00:15.570> the<00:00:15.750> tail<00:00:16.320> rotor<00:00:17.060> servo<00:00:18.060> on<00:00:18.270> so<00:00:18.660> anyways

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:18.960 
put the tail rotor servo on so anyways

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.630 
put the tail rotor servo on so anyways
I'm<00:00:19.140> going<00:00:19.230> to<00:00:19.320> show<00:00:19.439> you<00:00:19.470> how<00:00:19.710> I<00:00:19.740> fix<00:00:20.160> mine<00:00:20.400> to

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
I'm going to show you how I fix mine to

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.550 
I'm going to show you how I fix mine to
make<00:00:20.789> it<00:00:20.910> work<00:00:21.060> better

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.610 

now<00:00:26.430> the<00:00:26.520> instructions<00:00:27.240> here<00:00:29.480> show<00:00:30.480> the<00:00:30.870> servo

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:31.620 
now the instructions here show the servo

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:38.750 
now the instructions here show the servo
on<00:00:31.920> top<00:00:33.680> of<00:00:34.680> these<00:00:34.890> little<00:00:36.680> plastic<00:00:37.760> Clips

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:38.760 
on top of these little plastic Clips

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:45.280 
on top of these little plastic Clips
here<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:41.660> that's<00:00:42.660> the<00:00:42.780> original<00:00:42.930> way<00:00:43.320> had<00:00:43.650> mine

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:45.290 
here so that's the original way had mine

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:52.910 
here so that's the original way had mine
but<00:00:48.350> it<00:00:49.350> was<00:00:49.500> rubbing<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.010> the<00:00:50.130> tail<00:00:51.470> boom<00:00:52.470> here

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
but it was rubbing on the tail boom here

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.740 
but it was rubbing on the tail boom here
you<00:00:53.520> can<00:00:53.640> see<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.180> marks<00:00:54.510> there

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
you can see the little marks there

00:00:54.750 --> 00:01:02.710 
you can see the little marks there
because<00:00:55.590> it<00:00:55.860> was<00:00:55.980> way<00:00:56.160> up<00:00:56.340> here<00:01:00.170> so<00:01:01.170> originally

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:02.720 
because it was way up here so originally

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:06.530 
because it was way up here so originally
this<00:01:03.720> piece<00:01:04.019> over<00:01:04.199> here<00:01:04.320> was<00:01:04.620> up<00:01:04.800> here<00:01:05.390> so<00:01:06.390> what

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
this piece over here was up here so what

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.740 
this piece over here was up here so what
I<00:01:06.570> did<00:01:06.659> was<00:01:07.500> I<00:01:07.620> took<00:01:07.650> my<00:01:07.940> dremel<00:01:08.940> with<00:01:09.120> my<00:01:09.680> my

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:11.750 
I did was I took my dremel with my my

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:15.170 
I did was I took my dremel with my my
bit<00:01:12.750> here<00:01:13.159> I'll<00:01:14.159> show<00:01:14.340> you<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.550> that<00:01:14.640> looks

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
bit here I'll show you what that looks

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.390 
bit here I'll show you what that looks
like<00:01:15.270> there<00:01:15.630> and<00:01:16.590> I<00:01:17.520> carefully<00:01:18.300> ground<00:01:18.750> away

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
like there and I carefully ground away

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.820 
like there and I carefully ground away
some<00:01:20.400> of<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.550> material<00:01:21.030> up<00:01:21.090> here<00:01:21.120> so<00:01:21.479> the

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
some of the material up here so the

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:27.950 
some of the material up here so the
servo<00:01:22.830> would<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.400> really<00:01:23.700> nice<00:01:26.750> and<00:01:27.750> now<00:01:27.870> as

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
servo would go in really nice and now as

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.819 
servo would go in really nice and now as
you<00:01:28.020> can<00:01:28.140> see<00:01:28.350> the<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.869> linkage<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.380> now<00:01:31.619> in

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
you can see the the linkage is now in

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:37.840 
you can see the the linkage is now in
line<00:01:34.130> with<00:01:35.130> the<00:01:35.280> tail<00:01:35.490> rotor<00:01:35.719> before<00:01:36.719> it<00:01:37.049> was<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
line with the tail rotor before it was I

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.679 
line with the tail rotor before it was I
would<00:01:38.850> come<00:01:39.030> into<00:01:39.180> this<00:01:40.549> this<00:01:41.549> here<00:01:42.030> and<00:01:42.210> Bend

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
would come into this this here and Bend

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.359 
would come into this this here and Bend
up<00:01:42.869> all<00:01:43.110> the<00:01:43.229> way<00:01:43.350> up<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.680> here<00:01:43.920> and<00:01:43.950> actually

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
up all the way up to here and actually

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.230 
up all the way up to here and actually
rub<00:01:44.579> on<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:46.430> so<00:01:47.430> hopefully<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.880> should<00:01:48.030> work

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
rub on this so hopefully it should work

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.819 
rub on this so hopefully it should work
a<00:01:48.360> lot<00:01:48.509> better<00:01:48.630> now<00:01:48.869> I<00:01:48.899> have<00:01:49.110> yet<00:01:49.259> to<00:01:49.350> test<00:01:49.619> it

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
a lot better now I have yet to test it

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.469 
a lot better now I have yet to test it
because<00:01:49.920> I<00:01:51.259> need<00:01:52.259> a<00:01:52.289> linkage<00:01:52.770> I<00:01:53.359> cracked<00:01:54.359> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
because I need a linkage I cracked the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.149 
because I need a linkage I cracked the
linkage<00:01:54.810> my<00:01:55.049> boy<00:01:55.229> I<00:01:55.259> let<00:01:55.500> my<00:01:55.590> buddy<00:01:55.770> fly<00:01:56.100> this

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
linkage my boy I let my buddy fly this

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:01.450 
linkage my boy I let my buddy fly this
and<00:01:58.130> he<00:01:59.130> crashed<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.640> on<00:01:59.759> me<00:01:59.880> so<00:02:00.030> anyways

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
and he crashed it on me so anyways

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.050 
and he crashed it on me so anyways
that's<00:02:02.460> what<00:02:02.670> I<00:02:02.789> just<00:02:03.030> did<00:02:03.180> to<00:02:03.390> my<00:02:03.570> t-rex<00:02:03.810> 250

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:05.060 
that's what I just did to my t-rex 250

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.509 
that's what I just did to my t-rex 250
thanks<00:02:06.060> for<00:02:06.180> watching
