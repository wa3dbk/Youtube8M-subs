sensor<00:02:13.530> it's<00:02:13.709> just<00:02:13.920> plastic<00:02:14.269> so<00:02:15.650> having<00:02:16.650> this

00:02:16.759 --> 00:02:16.769 
sensor it's just plastic so having this

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:20.600 
sensor it's just plastic so having this
jack<00:02:17.130> again<00:02:17.430> is<00:02:18.420> super<00:02:18.930> beneficial<00:02:19.610> because

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
jack again is super beneficial because

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
around quite a bit as I jack it up I

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.849 
around quite a bit as I jack it up I
need<00:02:48.450> to<00:02:48.570> move<00:02:48.720> the<00:02:48.959> jack<00:02:49.230> forward<00:02:49.739> and

00:02:49.849 --> 00:02:49.859 
need to move the jack forward and

backwards slide it around a bit and it

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.130 
backwards slide it around a bit and it
takes<00:02:53.040> a<00:02:53.160> little<00:02:53.280> bit<00:02:53.489> of<00:02:53.549> moving<00:02:54.269> around<00:02:54.359> you

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
takes a little bit of moving around you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
don't just jack it straight up into the

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:01.930 
don't just jack it straight up into the

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:04.830 
inch of space it's not much so you see

00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:06.740

time I didn't know that if I were to do
this<00:04:30.810> again<00:04:31.110> to<00:04:31.470> another<00:04:31.590> mr2<00:04:32.310> I<00:04:32.610> wouldn't

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
this again to another mr2 I wouldn't

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.270 
this again to another mr2 I wouldn't
need<00:04:33.270> to<00:04:33.360> make<00:04:33.540> this<00:04:33.720> notch<00:04:34.080> because<00:04:34.800> I<00:04:34.950> move

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
need to make this notch because I move

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:36.470 
need to make this notch because I move
the<00:04:35.400> engine<00:04:35.700> further<00:04:35.970> forward<00:04:36.450> than

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:36.480 
the engine further forward than

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.810 
the engine further forward than
originally<00:04:37.470> planned<00:04:38.000> so<00:04:40.370> I'm<00:04:41.370> going<00:04:41.580> to<00:04:41.610> keep

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:41.820 
originally planned so I'm going to keep

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.110 
originally planned so I'm going to keep
on<00:04:42.140> jacking<00:04:43.140> it<00:04:43.230> up<00:04:43.290> there<00:04:43.790> the<00:04:44.790> other<00:04:44.940> thing

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
on jacking it up there the other thing

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.180 
on jacking it up there the other thing
to<00:04:45.240> remember<00:04:45.270> is<00:04:45.990> that<00:04:46.050> this<00:04:46.500> is<00:04:46.650> a<00:04:46.680> very<00:04:46.890> slow

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:47.190 
to remember is that this is a very slow

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.210 
to remember is that this is a very slow
process<00:04:47.550> of<00:04:48.210> jacking<00:04:48.780> it<00:04:48.900> up<00:04:49.020> better<00:04:49.860> take

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
process of jacking it up better take

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:53.810 
process of jacking it up better take
your<00:04:50.370> time<00:04:50.670> go<00:04:51.570> carefully<00:04:51.900> go<00:04:52.380> slowly<00:04:52.820> make

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:53.820 
your time go carefully go slowly make

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.870 
your time go carefully go slowly make
sure<00:04:53.940> everything<00:04:54.510> is<00:04:54.680> lining<00:04:55.680> up<00:04:55.980> move<00:04:56.700> the

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
sure everything is lining up move the

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.490 
sure everything is lining up move the
engine<00:04:57.120> around<00:04:57.390> a<00:04:57.510> little<00:04:57.630> bit<00:04:57.840> if<00:04:58.200> you<00:04:58.380> have

00:04:58.490 --> 00:04:58.500 
engine around a little bit if you have

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.140 
engine around a little bit if you have
to<00:04:58.620> drop<00:04:58.830> it<00:04:58.950> back<00:04:59.040> down<00:04:59.100> again<00:04:59.460> go<00:04:59.820> ahead<00:04:59.910> and

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
to drop it back down again go ahead and

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.720 
to drop it back down again go ahead and
drop<00:05:00.240> it<00:05:00.419> back<00:05:00.450> down<00:05:01.040> and<00:05:02.040> then<00:05:02.100> go<00:05:02.370> back<00:05:02.520> up

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:02.730 
drop it back down and then go back up

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:05.980 
drop it back down and then go back up
again<00:05:03.060> just<00:05:03.600> take<00:05:03.810> your<00:05:03.930> time<00:05:03.990> and<00:05:04.470> go<00:05:04.800> slow

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:05.990 
again just take your time and go slow

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.540 
again just take your time and go slow
looking<00:05:06.990> at<00:05:07.110> the<00:05:07.260> driver's<00:05:07.680> side<00:05:07.950> mount<00:05:08.280> you

00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:08.550 
looking at the driver's side mount you

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.520 
looking at the driver's side mount you
can<00:05:08.700> see<00:05:08.910> they're<00:05:09.120> coming<00:05:09.480> together<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:10.380> can

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:10.530 
can see they're coming together you can

00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.210 
can see they're coming together you can
maybe<00:05:10.680> kind<00:05:10.980> of<00:05:11.040> see<00:05:11.220> how<00:05:11.370> this<00:05:11.550> how<00:05:12.480> the<00:05:12.540> mount

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
maybe kind of see how this how the mount

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:18.470 
maybe kind of see how this how the mount
works<00:05:14.220> now<00:05:14.520> in<00:05:14.730> two<00:05:14.880> aces<00:05:16.970> look<00:05:17.970> at<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.270> front

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
works now in two aces look at the front

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.419 
works now in two aces look at the front
mount<00:05:18.810> and<00:05:22.280> it's<00:05:23.280> lining<00:05:23.760> up<00:05:23.880> okay

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:27.429 

00:05:27.429 --> 00:05:32.019 

and<00:05:28.429> I've<00:05:29.389> already<00:05:29.599> got<00:05:29.839> the<00:05:30.819> passenger<00:05:31.819> side

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:32.029 
and I've already got the passenger side

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:37.649 
and I've already got the passenger side
mount<00:05:32.619> slipped<00:05:33.619> in<00:05:34.599> between<00:05:35.599> the<00:05:35.719> ears<00:05:35.899> and

00:05:37.649 --> 00:05:37.659 
mount slipped in between the ears and

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:41.139 
mount slipped in between the ears and
it's<00:05:38.659> hard<00:05:38.839> to<00:05:38.959> see<00:05:39.139> from<00:05:39.379> here<00:05:39.739> but<00:05:40.610> it's<00:05:40.969> in

00:05:41.139 --> 00:05:41.149 
it's hard to see from here but it's in

00:05:41.149 --> 00:05:43.389 
it's hard to see from here but it's in
there
