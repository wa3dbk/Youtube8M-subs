a<00:02:03.319> great<00:02:03.530> confrontation<00:02:04.310> between<00:02:04.399> Ichigo<00:02:04.940> and

a great confrontation between Ichigo and

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.419 
a great confrontation between Ichigo and
buck<00:02:05.330> this<00:02:05.899> will<00:02:06.110> take<00:02:06.140> some<00:02:06.319> 50<00:02:06.830> chapters<00:02:07.039> I

00:02:07.419 --> 00:02:07.429 
buck this will take some 50 chapters I

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:09.430 
buck this will take some 50 chapters I
think<00:02:07.700> so<00:02:08.000> bleach<00:02:08.270> will<00:02:08.450> probably<00:02:08.899> amp<00:02:09.080> next

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440 
think so bleach will probably amp next

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.440 
think so bleach will probably amp next
year<00:02:09.590> in<00:02:09.739> autumn<00:02:10.099> or<00:02:10.310> winter<00:02:10.340> now<00:02:11.150> we<00:02:11.209> have

gintama<00:02:11.900> okay<00:02:12.379> I<00:02:12.410> have<00:02:12.590> no<00:02:12.830> idea<00:02:13.040> when<00:02:13.370> this

00:02:13.509 --> 00:02:13.519 
gintama okay I have no idea when this

00:02:13.519 --> 00:02:15.460 
gintama okay I have no idea when this
series<00:02:13.760> is<00:02:14.000> going<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.360> end<00:02:14.540> it<00:02:15.050> could<00:02:15.230> be<00:02:15.379> in

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
series is going to end it could be in

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:18.460 
series is going to end it could be in
two<00:02:15.650> months<00:02:15.890> or<00:02:16.310> in<00:02:16.430> 20<00:02:16.879> years<00:02:17.120> since<00:02:17.930> gintama

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
two months or in 20 years since gintama

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.680 
two months or in 20 years since gintama
is<00:02:18.530> an<00:02:18.650> episodic<00:02:19.069> comedy<00:02:19.730> series<00:02:20.150> I<00:02:20.390> think

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
is an episodic comedy series I think

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.630 
is an episodic comedy series I think
that<00:02:20.750> it's<00:02:20.959> up<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:21.230> creator<00:02:21.620> I'm<00:02:21.980> certain

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
that it's up to the creator I'm certain

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:23.830 
that it's up to the creator I'm certain
that<00:02:22.670> he<00:02:22.819> wants<00:02:23.030> to<00:02:23.090> make<00:02:23.209> at<00:02:23.360> least<00:02:23.390> 500

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:23.840 
that he wants to make at least 500

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.140 
that he wants to make at least 500
chapters<00:02:24.680> and<00:02:24.860> he<00:02:25.040> could<00:02:25.160> very<00:02:25.340> well<00:02:25.520> go<00:02:25.850> up<00:02:26.000> to

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:26.150 
chapters and he could very well go up to

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.630 
chapters and he could very well go up to
a<00:02:26.180> thousand<00:02:26.900> but<00:02:27.410> if<00:02:27.500> he<00:02:27.650> loses<00:02:27.860> interest<00:02:28.370> he

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
a thousand but if he loses interest he

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.040 
a thousand but if he loses interest he
could<00:02:28.790> empty<00:02:29.030> series<00:02:29.480> next<00:02:29.810> year

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
could empty series next year

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.050 
could empty series next year
already<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:30.620> it's<00:02:30.710> hard<00:02:30.950> to<00:02:31.070> tell<00:02:31.310> next<00:02:31.940> is

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
already so it's hard to tell next is

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:34.150 
already so it's hard to tell next is
fairy<00:02:32.330> tale<00:02:32.690> now<00:02:33.260> this<00:02:33.470> series<00:02:33.860> could<00:02:34.040> end

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
fairy tale now this series could end

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.280 
fairy tale now this series could end
pretty<00:02:34.430> soon<00:02:34.550> in<00:02:35.030> some<00:02:35.210> 30<00:02:35.480> chapters<00:02:35.810> right

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:36.290 
pretty soon in some 30 chapters right

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.290 
pretty soon in some 30 chapters right
after<00:02:36.620> the<00:02:36.710> great<00:02:36.950> magic<00:02:37.400> games<00:02:37.640> since<00:02:38.210> the

after the great magic games since the

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.480 
after the great magic games since the
back<00:02:38.510> story<00:02:38.870> about<00:02:39.110> zareff<00:02:39.650> and<00:02:39.800> dragons<00:02:40.340> is

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
back story about zareff and dragons is

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.400 
back story about zareff and dragons is
pretty<00:02:40.760> much<00:02:40.910> revealed<00:02:41.390> but<00:02:41.780> personally<00:02:42.380> I

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
pretty much revealed but personally I

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.230 
pretty much revealed but personally I
think<00:02:42.590> there<00:02:43.040> are<00:02:43.070> still<00:02:43.310> two<00:02:43.520> arcs<00:02:43.820> ahead<00:02:44.120> of

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
think there are still two arcs ahead of

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.270 
think there are still two arcs ahead of
us<00:02:44.420> one<00:02:45.050> arc<00:02:45.320> in<00:02:45.470> which<00:02:45.620> Natsu<00:02:46.040> and<00:02:46.070> his

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
us one arc in which Natsu and his

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.860 
us one arc in which Natsu and his
friends<00:02:46.610> are<00:02:46.700> transported<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> the<00:02:47.630> past

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:47.870 
friends are transported to the past

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.600 
friends are transported to the past
where<00:02:48.200> they<00:02:48.320> meet<00:02:48.470> zareff<00:02:48.890> and<00:02:49.100> play<00:02:49.280> a<00:02:49.310> major

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:49.610 
where they meet zareff and play a major

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.060 
where they meet zareff and play a major
part<00:02:49.730> in<00:02:50.090> a<00:02:50.210> human<00:02:50.570> dragon<00:02:50.990> war<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.590> another

part in a human dragon war and another
one<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.430> which<00:02:52.580> they<00:02:52.730> returned<00:02:53.150> to<00:02:53.240> their<00:02:53.420> own

time and destroys arif and acknowledged

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.820 
time and destroys arif and acknowledged
iya<00:02:55.880> so<00:02:56.420> this<00:02:56.630> series<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.140> either<00:02:57.320> going<00:02:57.620> to

00:02:57.820 --> 00:02:57.830 
iya so this series is either going to

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.190 
iya so this series is either going to
end<00:02:57.980> with<00:02:58.130> some<00:02:58.340> 340<00:02:59.180> chapters<00:02:59.600> next<00:02:59.930> summer

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
end with some 340 chapters next summer

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.230 
end with some 340 chapters next summer
or<00:03:00.470> should<00:03:00.800> my<00:03:00.920> speculation<00:03:01.580> be<00:03:01.700> correct<00:03:02.030> with

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
or should my speculation be correct with

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.150 
or should my speculation be correct with
over<00:03:02.450> four<00:03:02.720> hundred<00:03:02.870> chapters<00:03:03.290> sometimes<00:03:03.980> in

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
over four hundred chapters sometimes in

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.120 
over four hundred chapters sometimes in
late<00:03:04.540> 2014<00:03:05.540> now<00:03:06.110> let's<00:03:06.470> talk<00:03:06.620> about<00:03:06.680> soul

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:07.130 
late 2014 now let's talk about soul

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.860 
late 2014 now let's talk about soul
eater<00:03:07.370> this<00:03:07.850> series<00:03:08.210> will<00:03:08.360> end<00:03:08.510> pretty<00:03:08.750> soon

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
eater this series will end pretty soon

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:11.080 
eater this series will end pretty soon
because<00:03:09.710> the<00:03:09.740> final<00:03:10.160> confrontation<00:03:10.490> of<00:03:10.970> de

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
because the final confrontation of de

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:12.970 
because the final confrontation of de
Kishin<00:03:11.540> is<00:03:11.660> already<00:03:11.990> underway<00:03:12.320> since<00:03:12.740> some

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
Kishin is already underway since some

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:14.860 
Kishin is already underway since some
time<00:03:13.010> so<00:03:13.760> I<00:03:13.790> think<00:03:13.910> that<00:03:14.120> it<00:03:14.300> won't<00:03:14.450> take<00:03:14.660> more

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
time so I think that it won't take more

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.810 
time so I think that it won't take more
than<00:03:14.930> an<00:03:15.170> additional<00:03:15.650> 20<00:03:15.980> chapters<00:03:16.430> until<00:03:16.700> his

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 
than an additional 20 chapters until his

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.850 
than an additional 20 chapters until his
story's<00:03:17.210> wrapped<00:03:17.510> up<00:03:17.840> as<00:03:18.140> for<00:03:18.650> the<00:03:18.710> question

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
story's wrapped up as for the question

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.010 
story's wrapped up as for the question
when<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.430> eaters<00:03:19.760> going<00:03:20.090> to<00:03:20.180> end<00:03:20.360> it's<00:03:20.660> hard<00:03:20.870> to

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:21.020 
when so eaters going to end it's hard to

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.050 
when so eaters going to end it's hard to
tell<00:03:21.290> because<00:03:21.650> the<00:03:21.860> soul<00:03:22.190> eater<00:03:22.400> chapters<00:03:22.910> are

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:23.060 
tell because the soul eater chapters are

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.210 
tell because the soul eater chapters are
nearly<00:03:23.270> twice<00:03:23.690> as<00:03:23.750> long<00:03:24.140> as<00:03:24.350> ordinary<00:03:24.620> manga

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:25.220 
nearly twice as long as ordinary manga

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.010 
nearly twice as long as ordinary manga
chapters<00:03:25.730> and<00:03:25.970> therefore<00:03:26.510> the<00:03:26.660> release

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:27.020 
chapters and therefore the release

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.350
