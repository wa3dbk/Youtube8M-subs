newer Giants I know for sure and so look
let's<00:00:52.140> go<00:00:52.260> over<00:00:52.410> the<00:00:52.680> adjustments<00:00:53.190> and<00:00:53.309> how<00:00:53.640> to

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:53.699 
let's go over the adjustments and how to

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.700 
let's go over the adjustments and how to
run<00:00:53.910> these<00:00:54.000> two<00:00:54.180> plays<00:00:54.390> so<00:00:54.960> for<00:00:55.110> the<00:00:55.170> power<00:00:55.379> of

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:55.710 
run these two plays so for the power of

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.310 
run these two plays so for the power of
all<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:56.699> going<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:56.850> do<00:00:57.000> is<00:00:57.149> motion<00:00:57.480> over

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
all you're going to do is motion over

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.459 
all you're going to do is motion over
the<00:00:58.440> receiver<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.100> if<00:00:59.550> you're<00:00:59.760> um<00:01:00.320> if<00:01:01.320> the

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
the receiver and if you're um if the

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.529 
the receiver and if you're um if the
cornerback<00:01:01.920> goes<00:01:02.280> with<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.820> wide<00:01:03.149> receiver

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
cornerback goes with the wide receiver

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:06.740 
cornerback goes with the wide receiver
then<00:01:04.170> you're<00:01:04.290> going<00:01:04.379> to<00:01:04.439> just<00:01:05.330> leave<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.540> play

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
then you're going to just leave the play

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.630 
then you're going to just leave the play
as<00:01:06.930> is<00:01:07.140> and<00:01:07.380> run<00:01:07.830> it<00:01:07.890> to<00:01:08.040> that<00:01:08.189> right<00:01:08.369> side

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
as is and run it to that right side

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.060 
as is and run it to that right side
where<00:01:08.850> the<00:01:08.939> receiver<00:01:09.270> Beck<00:01:09.750> head<00:01:09.990> leaving<00:01:10.799> one

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
where the receiver Beck head leaving one

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.530 
where the receiver Beck head leaving one
less<00:01:11.250> defender<00:01:11.640> to<00:01:11.790> worry<00:01:11.970> about<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.420> you<00:01:12.510> can

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
less defender to worry about and you can

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.539 
less defender to worry about and you can
set<00:01:12.840> the<00:01:12.960> edge<00:01:13.080> really<00:01:13.560> well<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:13.920> then<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
set the edge really well and then the

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.340 
set the edge really well and then the
other<00:01:14.580> thing<00:01:14.729> is<00:01:15.060> if<00:01:15.090> if<00:01:15.390> they're<00:01:16.020> in<00:01:16.140> zone

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
other thing is if if they're in zone

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.600 
other thing is if if they're in zone
most<00:01:16.590> likely<00:01:16.890> the<00:01:16.950> defender<00:01:17.250> is<00:01:17.310> not<00:01:17.430> going<00:01:17.549> to

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
most likely the defender is not going to

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.940 
most likely the defender is not going to
roll<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.820> them<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.409> you'll<00:01:19.409> have<00:01:19.590> an<00:01:19.710> extra

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
roll with them and you'll have an extra

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.380 
roll with them and you'll have an extra
block<00:01:20.159> or<00:01:20.340> set<00:01:20.520> up<00:01:20.610> for<00:01:20.790> you<00:01:20.880> so<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.180> a<00:01:21.210> really

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
block or set up for you so it's a really

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.270 
block or set up for you so it's a really
moneypak<00:01:21.840> a<00:01:21.900> running<00:01:22.229> play<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.680> so<00:01:23.130> let's

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
moneypak a running play and so let's

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.230 
moneypak a running play and so let's
move<00:01:23.400> on<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.580> the<00:01:23.729> pass<00:01:23.909> play<00:01:24.090> that

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
move on to the pass play that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.810 
move on to the pass play that
complements<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.080> it's<00:01:25.890> the<00:01:26.040> angle<00:01:26.189> so<00:01:26.670> all

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
complements it and it's the angle so all

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:27.770 
complements it and it's the angle so all
you're<00:01:26.939> going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> do<00:01:27.210> is<00:01:27.360> treat<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:27.659> two

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
you're going to do is treat the two

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.539 
you're going to do is treat the two
receivers<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.439> like<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.829> block<00:01:29.009> the<00:01:29.159> full-back

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
receivers I like to block the full-back

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:30.890 
receivers I like to block the full-back
because<00:01:29.850> a<00:01:29.880> lot<00:01:30.060> of<00:01:30.090> times<00:01:30.299> are<00:01:30.479> sitting<00:01:30.720> heavy

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
because a lot of times are sitting heavy

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.749 
because a lot of times are sitting heavy
blitzes<00:01:31.350> but<00:01:31.860> if<00:01:31.979> they're<00:01:32.100> not<00:01:32.250> sending<00:01:32.460> a

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
blitzes but if they're not sending a

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.390 
blitzes but if they're not sending a
heavy<00:01:33.090> blitz<00:01:33.420> you<00:01:34.020> know<00:01:34.140> I<00:01:34.170> don't<00:01:34.350> what<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.189> like

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
heavy blitz you know I don't what I like

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.640 
heavy blitz you know I don't what I like
to<00:01:35.490> do<00:01:35.579> is<00:01:35.610> put<00:01:35.850> them<00:01:35.970> on<00:01:36.060> a<00:01:36.090> streaker<00:01:36.450> out<00:01:36.659> and

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
to do is put them on a streaker out and

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.880 
to do is put them on a streaker out and
then<00:01:38.430> i'm<00:01:38.549> going<00:01:38.640> to<00:01:38.729> put<00:01:38.909> be<00:01:39.210> on<00:01:39.600> a<00:01:39.710> fade<00:01:40.710> route

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
then i'm going to put be on a fade route

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.410 
then i'm going to put be on a fade route
the<00:01:41.070> majority<00:01:41.460> of<00:01:41.490> time<00:01:41.670> the<00:01:41.729> only<00:01:42.299> other

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
the majority of time the only other

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.760 
the majority of time the only other
thing<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.689> would<00:01:42.750> ever<00:01:42.869> do<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.290> put<00:01:43.500> them<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.740> a

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
thing I would ever do is put them on a

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.249 
thing I would ever do is put them on a
out<00:01:44.670> router<00:01:44.970> or<00:01:45.240> smart<00:01:45.509> routed<00:01:45.750> out<00:01:45.840> route<00:01:46.049> and

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
out router or smart routed out route and

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.679 
out router or smart routed out route and
I<00:01:46.680> motion<00:01:47.040> them<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.280> and<00:01:47.490> they<00:01:48.119> can't<00:01:48.329> key<00:01:48.509> in

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
I motion them in and they can't key in

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.300 
I motion them in and they can't key in
on<00:01:48.810> the<00:01:48.960> motion<00:01:49.140> thinking<00:01:49.950> that<00:01:50.100> you're<00:01:50.130> just

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
on the motion thinking that you're just

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.539 
on the motion thinking that you're just
doing<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.270> fade<00:01:51.479> route<00:01:51.689> because<00:01:52.189> you<00:01:53.189> motion

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:53.549 
doing the fade route because you motion

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:55.639 
doing the fade route because you motion
as<00:01:53.640> well<00:01:53.880> when<00:01:54.659> it's<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.899> run<00:01:55.079> play<00:01:55.290> so<00:01:55.350> they

00:01:55.639 --> 00:01:55.649 
as well when it's a run play so they

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:57.770 
as well when it's a run play so they
can't<00:01:55.890> focus<00:01:56.430> in<00:01:56.759> on<00:01:56.820> that<00:01:57.000> powerful<00:01:57.479> Phaedra

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
that gets inside position when you

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.350 
that gets inside position when you
