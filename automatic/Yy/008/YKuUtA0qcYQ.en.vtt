00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.589
 very good to all and welcome one day 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:07.180
 more to my channel to terror channel about 

00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:10.210
 james welcome to the first 

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:13.960
 vter ground assignment 2015 with the 

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:14.530
 main event between the champion of the web 

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.370
 from the web 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.580
 w rollins that will light the title a 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.820
 again before the former champion 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:26.520
 Brock Lesnar 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.830
 while the entrances of both 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:30.619
 fighters I will comment on why 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.210
 I take several action on the video 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.340
 reasons why I've been in gamers 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.390
 at the fair game for the vp 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:42.269
 intended primarily for competition 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.879
 of electronic sports in languages 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:46.710
 Spanish level that was done in Madrid and 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:51.300
 well I believe in Barcelona in I went with 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.610
 four friends there to Madrid two days and the 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:57.239
 Saturday was the one that we dedicate then to go 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.510
 to the event on Sunday I arrived and today 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:02.190
 Monday I have arranged to record and 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.989
 videos for the channel again and 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.240
 we started as I say with this series of 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.660
 simulations to beat a 2015 where 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.430
 4 or 5 combats have already been confirmed as 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:13.320
 I'm going to inaugurate it with the main event 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:15.060
 and well I will comment a little bit what 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.340
 it seemed like another day and the truth was 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.590
 very 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:20.840
 mostly I went for the theme the league of 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.520
 legends that is something that more game 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:25.039
 currently what is going to be interested 

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:28.159
 from gamers and it was also for 

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:30.229
 try figure 16 but could not find the 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.530
 stand of this super super section 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.310
 hidden because they did not want 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:40.340
 nothing of photos nothing of videos today that yes 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.159
 it's over is a picture or something from the game or 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.560
 a video that fell an incredible fine what 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.860
 they had everything super hidden and already when 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.450
 I realized where the stand was 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.599
 I did not look for it with many 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:57.049
 anxieties because they had already closed and not 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:58.610
 there was the availability to test the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.819
 game but good the truth that was 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:03.709
 great, he made me a lot of pictures with 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:05.810
 competitive league players 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.520
 of legends 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.069
 youtubers and others the truth that good 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:15.340
 heap already wanting the next game 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:17.139
 if I can then also attend and nothing 

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:19.359
 let's go with the fight if any of 

00:02:17.139 --> 00:02:22.530
 you can post a comment 

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:25.299
 tell me what you think and good too 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.510
 some anecdote did a king of the 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:31.900
 track of league of legends yes and yes 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.359
 was 15 where if you won the fifa case 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:37.329
 three straight games that was the goal of 

00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:40.120
 gold then you get a prize of a pair 

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:42.760
 of ozone brand products and in 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:45.459
 For what of the three items to 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.969
 first blood like I got to take me 

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:51.719
 the fifa the first and good was a 

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.480
 backpack of the zone and a wristband which 

00:02:51.719 --> 00:02:58.470
 It was pretty good and I had a great time 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:01.050
 come on let's give cane to brock lesnar 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.410
 we'll talk about gamers and in another 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.540
 moment 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:09.150
 Regarding combat, I do not think that either 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:10.260
 least I should not win brock lesnar anymore 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.870
 what 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:15.480
 we know that it appears very occasionally 

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.400
 and good to be rollings if I had to 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.340
 lose the championship I do not think it was 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.620
 before brow wins them from rivals who have 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.750
 good post they deserved it 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.540
 I suppose that much more is not the case 

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:29.400
 of good from the ambrosi inah company before 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.959
 what a problem for my opinion but it is that 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.200
 without any doubt 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.200
 ruiz 

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:39.310
 already enough the day I feel for the game 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.230
 I put there 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:45.239
 without touching it 4 

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:47.580
 there is a detail that my neighbor is 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.659
 doing works and now it seems that he has 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:53.159
 standing with the colt hope that if not no 

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:55.230
 return to the load because good if you 

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:57.840
 come back in fact you will not be seeing this 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.840
 video is how you are seeing it is that already 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.910
 he has left the works 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.190
 and I was waiting for practically all the 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:08.810
 tomorrow to be able to record the video until 

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:08.810
 I've seen a bit of silence 

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:23.130
 good 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.310
 I think it is going around but 

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:28.729
 which is not for a short time 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:31.129
 that's suplex 

00:04:28.729 --> 00:04:33.080
 we better do them ourselves 

00:04:31.129 --> 00:04:37.580
 substitutes because as he starts he knows 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:40.810
 what to do not for we are going to punish the 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.960
 skull again there grave 

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:47.009
 and we are going to look for a jump from the 

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.940
 rope no 

00:04:47.009 --> 00:04:51.730
 was 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:53.620
 to this good we have movements 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.849
 personal 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:59.789
 let's spend it and crotch 

00:04:56.849 --> 00:05:01.950
 and here I can do that powerball 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:05.510
 against the corner 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:05.510
 let's try it in fact 

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:15.300
 I think if we do that is dust 

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.310
 God 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.400
 let's wait a bit for the auction because 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:22.110
 I believe that without having red life yet 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:23.580
 you can not return it and we have had 

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:26.039
 bad experiences in previous 

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:27.750
 combats and we continue to play we are going to 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:31.400
 laugh a little brock lesnar that 

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.400
 it seems that he is totally in the shit 

00:05:32.689 --> 00:05:36.549
 no no because this is standing 

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:45.330
 there you do not know how to cross the back was before 

00:05:41.199 --> 00:05:45.330
 of answered us but he now 

00:05:46.569 --> 00:05:49.169
 I'm fatal 

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:53.500
 that's good 

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:55.660
 on the downside there will be 2 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:00.750
 you will see in contact with them with the 

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:00.750
 public does not want does not want 

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:07.339
 down 

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:09.110
 I have the audio removed the game so that 

00:06:07.339 --> 00:06:11.659
 do not bother commenting so I do not know 

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:14.520
 why because the referee will go 

00:06:11.659 --> 00:06:16.830
 but hey case 

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:20.460
 let's know 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:24.020
 come with me in I already 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:24.020
 now please come 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.629
 thanks for doing 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:33.650
 wrong 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.370
 to see if we're going to mess with the account 

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:39.130
 of ten and others but not 

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.930
 we have another power mont that is the 

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:43.810
 let's do and if he got it 

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:45.940
 execute well because you are going to eat the 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.320
 auction and I think he has already sentenced 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:52.780
 sixth the match 

00:06:49.320 --> 00:06:57.120
 let's play an open game here 

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:57.120
 and now you're going to notice something on your back 

00:06:58.540 --> 00:07:03.890
 for what 

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.890
 and now we have two auctions 

00:07:03.980 --> 00:07:08.350
 there it is we put it more to the center 

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.770
 and we're going to step on the neck a little there 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.780
 is 

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:18.139
 let's try with this auction that if 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.319
 It serves that surely if you count 3 1 2 

00:07:18.139 --> 00:07:24.259
 and rolling set is still champion of the 

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:26.270
 wwe double I hope you liked a 

00:07:24.259 --> 00:07:28.069
 Combat has been easier than expected 

00:07:26.270 --> 00:07:30.470
 but there have also been moments 

00:07:28.069 --> 00:07:32.840
 quite interesting and we have also 

00:07:30.470 --> 00:07:34.729
 managed to finish without problem and 

00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.800
 surround the belt again 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:38.180
 a house that you think will happen in the 

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:40.759
 Real combat in the pay per view 

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:44.060
 for laser rollings problems to the new 

00:07:40.759 --> 00:07:46.520
 champion who will game that you will do with 

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.599
 hey man and good little more to say or 

00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:49.009
 keep bringing the following 

00:07:47.599 --> 00:07:53.650
 simulations I hope you liked it 

00:07:49.009 --> 00:07:53.650
 see you next video chao chao
