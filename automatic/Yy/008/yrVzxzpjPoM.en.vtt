you guys have small wrists like me i
recommend<00:05:42.410> like<00:05:42.560> I<00:05:42.710> think<00:05:42.920> it's<00:05:43.010> the<00:05:43.190> 7<00:05:43.580> inch

recommend like I think it's the 7 inch

00:05:43.730 --> 00:05:44.980 
recommend like I think it's the 7 inch
or<00:05:43.970> 6<00:05:44.240> inch<00:05:44.450> or<00:05:44.570> something<00:05:44.840> like<00:05:44.930> that

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:44.990 
or 6 inch or something like that

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:47.500 
or 6 inch or something like that
whatever<00:05:45.410> the<00:05:45.500> first<00:05:45.890> smallest<00:05:46.790> size<00:05:46.970> is<00:05:47.150> and

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:47.510 
whatever the first smallest size is and

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:49.900 
whatever the first smallest size is and
then<00:05:47.600> of<00:05:47.690> course<00:05:48.160> it<00:05:49.160> goes<00:05:49.370> a<00:05:49.430> little<00:05:49.760> bit

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:49.910 
then of course it goes a little bit

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:51.820 
then of course it goes a little bit
higher<00:05:50.150> depending<00:05:50.540> on<00:05:50.930> like<00:05:51.230> your<00:05:51.380> size<00:05:51.620> of

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
higher depending on like your size of

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.950 
higher depending on like your size of
risks<00:05:52.220> and<00:05:52.340> stuff<00:05:52.550> so<00:05:52.850> that's<00:05:53.510> pretty<00:05:53.780> much<00:05:53.870> it

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:53.960
