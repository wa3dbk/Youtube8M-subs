00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.590
 signed and such and with a dedication what 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.329
 What I wanted to comment on is that as 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.129
 there is a book and how the book can not be 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:02.010
 command at least those that do not 

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:03.989
 you can have it and it reads a bit of 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.260
 first chapter is worth and as a minimum 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.300
 I did not say oh fuckin 'that this is not 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.550
 it's a kind of introduction and it's a 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:12.680
 sort of why this whole book and 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.210
 of all this adventure those that you do not have 

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.980
 the book down here also left the link 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.350
 so you can watch the documentary because in 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.390
 the background I think this book is a great 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.640
 complement to see with to read with 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.110
 the documentary and if not good watching a 

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.230
 documentary you can get an idea of 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:29.960
 why is that said because I suffered so much 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:32.420
 but because I also enjoyed it so much 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.090
 introduction says well a principle that 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.740
 it's more of an ending this is the title 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:39.680
 my mother died of cancer on 31 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.510
 December 2008 nobody imagined it 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.670
 it entered the plans nobody was 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:46.310
 completely healthy neither smoked nor drank 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:48.740
 I did sports I worked as the most 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.680
 I enjoyed skiing and I was full of 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.990
 life was 65 and had just 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.460
 retire just a month before I wore 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.380
 several years saving what he could 

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.300
 I was expecting the first pay of the 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.520
 retirement to buy a team of 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 new ski surely this is not the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.850
 best way to start a book but 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.860
 does not seem the most appropriate way 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:09.679
 to throw the curtain on my life 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.959
 mother took a cancer a fucking 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.470
 cancer one of those of the very children of 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.780
 bitch 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.700
 arrived unannounced October 13 and in 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.590
 less than two months swept everything 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.810
 also with the ski equipment that 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.700
 will remain exposed and wasted in the 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.130
 showcase of some sports store 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:27.200
 from girona like a wedding dress made 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.060
 as for a young beautiful that 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.160
 He remained in the tailor shop because the future 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.410
 husband left her planted before passing 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.150
 through the altar I remember that the notebook 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.920
 work that I carry with me where 

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:39.200
 he scored meetings phrases from movies that 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.360
 they like and ideas that still do not know that 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.670
 they will soon be rescued from the limbo of 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:45.319
 prepared projects write only one 

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.239
 Question 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:50.269
 what a son says to a mother who 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.219
 dies and then silence in two months 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.170
 He wrote again, I did not know what 

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:56.239
 tell her because she did not want to know that 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.980
 he was dying and I did not want to tell him and my 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.739
 father could not know and the rest of the 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.719
 family did not dare to comment on it as 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.969
 you tell a mother my mother's mother 

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:07.280
 my grandmother who is about to bury 

00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:09.480
 a daughter no father should survive 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.489
 Survive a son 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.930
 I did not write in that notebook again 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.670
 today he took notes that I want 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.330
 tell in this book with only one 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:20.010
 exception on January 2, 2009 the 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:22.590
 day we buried my wife 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 father to the mother of my sister to the daughter 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:26.879
 from my grandmother to the person from whom more 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:29.519
 I have learned in this world the mother who 

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:31.530
 I was born I was sitting in the bathtub 

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:32.970
 notebook in hand I knew that in an hour I 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.440
 I had to say a few words in a 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:36.569
 church that would be crowded with people 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.269
 that he had wanted or admired the two 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:40.739
 things I did not feel like writing anything or 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:43.140
 much less to pronounce minutes 

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:45.180
 after those words out loud like 

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:48.180
 certifying to too many witnesses 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.620
 that nightmare was real there was never 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.260
 I had to face a situation 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:54.120
 so painful until then and that is 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:56.430
 for the good and for the bad there is always 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.799
 a first time this is the first 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.220
 news the second and then the one and the 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:01.230
 bad 

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.370
 they last forever so naked 

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:04.920
 crying and with the notebook in his hand 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.299
 I took some notes I remember that it ended 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:08.069
 asking everyone that with their best 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.720
 smile they will get up and try 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:12.030
 dismiss my mother with a round of applause 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.400
 deserved as the one of the happy good ones with 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:15.930
 happy ending like in the plays 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:18.239
 where the actors and even the director 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 have to go out several times to say hello 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.780
 like the ovations received by the 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:24.060
 soccer teams after a 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:27.120
 epic comeback of those who need to 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:28.889
 extension in the second leg slut 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.190
 shit metaphors that occurred to me 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:33.930
 nor had the film had a happy ending 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:36.150
 nor the leading actress could leave to 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.759
 say hello or had the chance to play 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:41.820
 the red discount time and the street 

00:04:38.759 --> 00:04:44.130
 Unable to discuss unfair penalty and 

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.300
 expulsion not better than rafa that you have 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:48.260
 wrong player 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.820
 remember that people try 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.530
 I remember that among the people were my 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.270
 friends I remember the nurse that the 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.770
 helped die was emma one of the 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:56.480
 people who have loved me the most in this 

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:58.460
 world and there was with the heart 

00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:00.590
 doubly broken that my grandmother did not have 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.480
 courage to come see how they were getting 

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:04.730
 to her daughter in a wooden box that 

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:06.440
 it was cold and the voice did not come out I remember 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:07.820
 as if it were today that you do not 

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:09.470
 hundreds of times he has had to 

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.840
 speak in public to put myself in front of a 

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.460
 micro never before had wanted to 

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.880
 die and even came to feel the 

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:19.390
 feeling that at that moment something was dying 

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.390
 definitely inside of me 

00:05:20.409 --> 00:05:24.849
 it follows follows followed pretty is one for 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:26.139
 be the introduction of a book almost that 

00:05:24.849 --> 00:05:28.629
 the introduction is longer than 

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:30.969
 own book lasts 15 pages but I think 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:32.649
 that the whole introduction before telling 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.959
 Sanjuan's own path deserved the 

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:37.659
 penalty because if it did not make sense neither the 

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:39.429
 trip nor why I did this is the 

00:05:37.659 --> 00:05:40.899
 path of san juan 

00:05:39.429 --> 00:05:42.729
 is one of the things that more in the 100 

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:45.129
 he has made me do it, he knows very badly that 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:47.319
 all of you who are in Latin America or 

00:05:45.129 --> 00:05:48.999
 even outside the peninsula you can not 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:50.679
 get it if you ever come here 

00:05:48.999 --> 00:05:52.719
 and you catch me on the street worry us 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:55.269
 if I sign it and I'll give it to you and I'll do it 

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:57.849
 delighted I would like everyone 

00:05:55.269 --> 00:06:00.610
