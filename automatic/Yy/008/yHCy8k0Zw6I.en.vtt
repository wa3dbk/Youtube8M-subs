00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:10.860

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.690
 without you can see that the doors do not 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.770
 are not open because it's closed and 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.789
 so we can not get in there 

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:26.029
 can just go on the terrace then 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:31.890
 here a small gardener loeffler super 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:34.200
 here we have table tables there there are 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.500
 has a bigger there was a little 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.570
 table between lovers is still a top 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.820
 like that then we have the lights at 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:46.680
 ceiling and 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.230
 Well, for the moment, we can not go 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.690
 further so I suggest you go 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:55.559
 open the restaurant so to open it 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:58.860
 we will have to go in how that 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:05.850
 is called how did you go 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:07.979
 see then that the bass and that's 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.970
 outright something else I will make a video 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.860
 on when it's over 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.170
 ca river splash which is not finished yet 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.720
 so here we do not see well in the stone 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.789
 and a button we click on it is done 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.390
 expressly that we do not see well and when 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:27.960
 we go there in my roller coaster that 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:30.110
 I did first there was a passage 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.030
 secret that opened so we go down 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:34.560
 press the button to close it 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.960
 the passage so we have to wait for a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.900
 little because 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:42.600
 normally now to go out here is 

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.930
 so there and closed and if we pass 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.580
 right here 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:49.200
 hop we get teleported into this 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.000
 room in fact this is where we want to be able 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.580
 order all the park have for example 

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.740

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:01.210
 click here I'm in adventure mode 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:04.370
 survival mode or a creative mode 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:08.300
 basically we can do a lot of stuff on 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:11.540
 can empty inventory for example I 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:14.270

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:31.830

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.530
 had a cost that here I then several 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:48.690
 amended 

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:50.519
 so that ended because I was using 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:54.209
 help systems control block 

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:57.630

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:59.700

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.820
 grated carrots jap and carrots 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:09.870
 grated because I made carrots 

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:14.010

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.940

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:20.209
 so I have a potato is a 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.970
 roast chicken steak with potatoes 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:27.360
 the chicken is gone I had a 

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:30.600

 can have chocolate cake game 

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.539
 for me this little cake I had it 

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:40.369
 never want to call it that because 

00:04:38.539 --> 00:04:42.289

00:04:40.369 --> 00:04:45.879
 white chocolate and map 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:45.879
 but these 22 pumpkin pie 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.209
 that's why that's why I even 

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:54.949
 a pumpkin pie it's a little 

00:04:50.209 --> 00:05:03.469
 weird in a restaurant well read them 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:05:06.649
 we go out above the restaurant where we 

00:05:03.469 --> 00:05:10.490
 it gives that in fact it's not very pretty 

00:05:06.649 --> 00:05:11.029
 but hey I'll show you on the 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.919
 map 

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:17.479
 because I made a map of the park 

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:21.499
 which is downright not finished a park 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.360
 good what advance what then here there is the 

00:05:21.499 --> 00:05:23.959
 little green dot right next to it and the 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:27.979
 white task 

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:32.240
 here is the restaurant actually just 

00:05:27.979 --> 00:05:34.159
 behind this name elop have their stops 

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:37.179
 on the map love themselves attraction that are 

00:05:34.159 --> 00:05:41.119
 under construction 

00:05:37.179 --> 00:05:44.180
 also so if I rap on the button that 

00:05:41.119 --> 00:05:45.139
 I was just now to close 

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:47.659
 open the restaurant 

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:49.899
 if I close it and I'm still at 

00:05:47.659 --> 00:05:49.899
 interior 

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:54.910
 people are not locked up actually it 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.560
 always leave again even if the 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.330
 doors close because if there are 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.610
 pressure plates and if we pass I 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:05.230
 am it opens against it we can 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:07.630

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:10.090
 finished do not hesitate to give you to the 

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:11.380
