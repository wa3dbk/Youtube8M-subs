so first of all it's worth mentioning
that<00:01:27.900> having<00:01:28.259> a<00:01:28.350> cannon<00:01:28.680> will<00:01:28.979> speed<00:01:29.250> up<00:01:29.369> your

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
that having a cannon will speed up your

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.310 
that having a cannon will speed up your
range<00:01:29.729> training<00:01:30.030> however<00:01:30.600> it<00:01:30.750> is<00:01:30.900> fairly

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
range training however it is fairly

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.170 
range training however it is fairly
expensive<00:01:31.590> and<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.189> recommended<00:01:32.759> if<00:01:32.880> you<00:01:33.060> do

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
expensive and not recommended if you do

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:34.999 
expensive and not recommended if you do
not<00:01:33.299> have<00:01:33.390> a<00:01:33.479> lot<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.659> money<00:01:33.869> when<00:01:34.740> training

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
not have a lot of money when training

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.069 
not have a lot of money when training
range<00:01:35.340> always<00:01:35.850> use<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.150> best<00:01:36.270> possible<00:01:36.509> gear

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
range always use the best possible gear

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.870 
range always use the best possible gear
in<00:01:37.290> order<00:01:37.439> to<00:01:37.619> maximize<00:01:38.130> your<00:01:38.280> range<00:01:38.549> bonus

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
in order to maximize your range bonus

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.149 
in order to maximize your range bonus
and<00:01:39.090> overall<00:01:39.390> efficiency<00:01:39.590> so<00:01:40.590> if<00:01:40.680> I<00:01:40.770> level<00:01:41.009> one

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
and overall efficiency so if I level one

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:42.950 
and overall efficiency so if I level one
to<00:01:41.310> 50<00:01:41.670> you<00:01:41.909> want<00:01:42.030> to<00:01:42.180> train<00:01:42.360> a<00:01:42.390> rock<00:01:42.689> crabs

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
to 50 you want to train a rock crabs

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.480 
to 50 you want to train a rock crabs
this<00:01:43.229> will<00:01:43.470> take<00:01:43.680> a<00:01:43.710> little<00:01:43.890> while<00:01:44.040> but<00:01:44.460> just

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:44.490 
this will take a little while but just

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.010 
this will take a little while but just
persist<00:01:45.030> with<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.270> guys<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.750> you'll<00:01:45.899> get

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
persist with the guys and you'll get

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:48.139 
persist with the guys and you'll get
there<00:01:46.170> eventually<00:01:46.409> on<00:01:46.890> screen<00:01:47.490> is<00:01:47.670> an<00:01:47.820> example

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
there eventually on screen is an example

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.149 
there eventually on screen is an example
of<00:01:48.450> some<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.810> gear<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.110> might<00:01:49.290> use<00:01:49.500> ok

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
of some of the gear you might use ok

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.530 
of some of the gear you might use ok
guys<00:01:50.310> for<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.579> second<00:01:50.939> part<00:01:51.119> of<00:01:51.240> range

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540

guys for the second part of range
training<00:01:52.079> from<00:01:52.290> levels<00:01:52.649> 50<00:01:53.159> to<00:01:53.310> 60<00:01:53.759> you<00:01:54.000> want

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
training from levels 50 to 60 you want

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.350 
training from levels 50 to 60 you want
to<00:01:54.360> be<00:01:54.540> using<00:01:54.979> again<00:01:55.979> either<00:01:56.399> iron<00:01:56.850> knives<00:01:57.090> or

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
to be using again either iron knives or

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:58.850 
to be using again either iron knives or
a<00:01:57.390> magic<00:01:57.750> short<00:01:58.020> boat<00:01:58.200> it<00:01:58.380> doesn't<00:01:58.740> really

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
a magic short boat it doesn't really

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:00.740 
a magic short boat it doesn't really
make<00:01:59.100> too<00:01:59.130> much<00:01:59.520> of<00:01:59.670> a<00:01:59.729> difference<00:01:59.880> and<00:02:00.329> you're

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
make too much of a difference and you're

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:01.850 
make too much of a difference and you're
not<00:02:00.869> going<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.049> be<00:02:01.110> losing<00:02:01.290> too<00:02:01.680> much<00:02:01.799> money

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
not going to be losing too much money

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.039 
not going to be losing too much money
overall<00:02:02.430> however<00:02:03.000> if<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.299> do<00:02:03.450> use<00:02:03.600> a<00:02:03.630> cannon

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
overall however if you do use a cannon

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:06.200 
overall however if you do use a cannon
this<00:02:04.290> probably<00:02:04.680> be<00:02:04.829> well<00:02:05.040> quite<00:02:05.399> expensive<00:02:05.790> so

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
this probably be well quite expensive so

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.080 
this probably be well quite expensive so
we're<00:02:07.200> going<00:02:07.290> to<00:02:07.380> be<00:02:07.469> killing<00:02:07.710> level<00:02:08.129> 53<00:02:08.640> ogres

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
we're going to be killing level 53 ogres

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
we're going to be killing level 53 ogres
and<00:02:09.270> there<00:02:09.780> are<00:02:09.959> too<00:02:10.410> many<00:02:10.560> places<00:02:10.860> that<00:02:11.129> you

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
and there are too many places that you

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.640 
and there are too many places that you
can<00:02:11.430> kill<00:02:11.640> ochres<00:02:12.120> so<00:02:12.599> the<00:02:12.900> first<00:02:13.140> one<00:02:13.319> is<00:02:13.500> the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
can kill ochres so the first one is the

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:13.920 
can kill ochres so the first one is the
calm

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:13.930 
calm

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:15.509 
calm
at<00:02:13.989> training<00:02:14.319> camp<00:02:14.530> which<00:02:14.829> requires<00:02:15.250> the

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519 
at training camp which requires the

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.520 
at training camp which requires the
completion<00:02:15.700> of<00:02:16.209> the<00:02:16.359> biohazard<00:02:16.629> quest<00:02:17.200> which

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
completion of the biohazard quest which

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.770 
completion of the biohazard quest which
has<00:02:17.739> a<00:02:17.769> requirement<00:02:18.219> of<00:02:18.579> plague<00:02:19.090> City<00:02:19.390> as<00:02:19.599> well

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:19.780 
has a requirement of plague City as well

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:21.089 
has a requirement of plague City as well
so<00:02:20.140> if<00:02:20.230> you<00:02:20.319> don't<00:02:20.469> want<00:02:20.590> to<00:02:20.650> be<00:02:20.709> do<00:02:20.769> an<00:02:20.859> extra

00:02:21.089 --> 00:02:21.099 
so if you don't want to be do an extra

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:23.309 
so if you don't want to be do an extra
quests<00:02:21.579> I<00:02:21.609> wouldn't<00:02:21.939> recommend<00:02:22.060> here<00:02:22.540> however

00:02:23.309 --> 00:02:23.319 
quests I wouldn't recommend here however

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:25.289 
quests I wouldn't recommend here however
there<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.709> another<00:02:23.920> spot<00:02:24.280> just<00:02:24.730> near<00:02:24.909> ya<00:02:25.120> mill

00:02:25.289 --> 00:02:25.299 
there is another spot just near ya mill

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.170 
there is another spot just near ya mill
and<00:02:25.540> that<00:02:26.409> is<00:02:26.799> one<00:02:27.219> of<00:02:27.340> the<00:02:27.400> most<00:02:27.549> common<00:02:27.879> spots

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
and that is one of the most common spots

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.420 
and that is one of the most common spots
and<00:02:28.480> also<00:02:28.959> probably<00:02:29.379> one<00:02:29.769> of<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.920> best<00:02:30.069> spots

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
and also probably one of the best spots

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.520 
and also probably one of the best spots
so<00:02:30.849> I<00:02:31.180> will<00:02:31.359> just<00:02:31.480> go<00:02:31.629> ahead<00:02:31.719> and<00:02:31.989> use<00:02:32.139> that<00:02:32.170> if

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.530 
so I will just go ahead and use that if

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.740 
so I will just go ahead and use that if
you<00:02:32.620> don't<00:02:32.680> want<00:02:32.829> to<00:02:32.950> do<00:02:33.010> any<00:02:33.129> more<00:02:33.250> questing

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you don't want to do any more questing

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.050 
you don't want to do any more questing
okay<00:02:34.750> in<00:02:34.989> this<00:02:35.170> third<00:02:35.560> and<00:02:35.769> final<00:02:36.519> section<00:02:36.730> of

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
okay in this third and final section of

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.910 
okay in this third and final section of
the<00:02:37.150> range<00:02:37.870> training<00:02:38.230> we<00:02:38.560> are<00:02:38.590> going<00:02:38.769> to<00:02:38.829> be

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
the range training we are going to be

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.819 
the range training we are going to be
talking<00:02:39.370> about<00:02:39.719> getting<00:02:40.719> from<00:02:40.959> level<00:02:41.290> 60<00:02:41.680> to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
talking about getting from level 60 to

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.429 
talking about getting from level 60 to
75<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:42.639> I'll<00:02:43.000> also<00:02:43.209> talk<00:02:43.540> about<00:02:43.599> level<00:02:44.109> 75

00:02:44.429 --> 00:02:44.439 
75 and I'll also talk about level 75

00:02:44.439 --> 00:02:46.259 
75 and I'll also talk about level 75
onwards<00:02:44.980> as<00:02:45.159> it<00:02:45.519> is<00:02:45.670> one<00:02:45.909> of<00:02:45.939> the<00:02:46.120> methods

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
onwards as it is one of the methods

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:49.020 
onwards as it is one of the methods
described<00:02:46.900> in<00:02:47.139> this<00:02:47.290> section<00:02:47.470> so<00:02:48.310> basically

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
described in this section so basically

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.849 
described in this section so basically
you've<00:02:49.329> got<00:02:49.359> a<00:02:49.569> few<00:02:49.750> options<00:02:50.139> here<00:02:50.230> if<00:02:50.620> you're

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:50.859 
you've got a few options here if you're

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:51.839 
you've got a few options here if you're
at<00:02:50.980> level<00:02:51.099> 60

00:02:51.839 --> 00:02:51.849 
at level 60

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:54.690 
at level 60
you<00:02:51.970> can<00:02:52.239> continue<00:02:52.629> killing<00:02:52.930> ogres<00:02:53.489> 273<00:02:54.489> and

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:54.700 
you can continue killing ogres 273 and

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.149 
you can continue killing ogres 273 and
then<00:02:55.209> once<00:02:55.629> you<00:02:55.840> get<00:02:55.989> full<00:02:56.200> void<00:02:56.439> providing

00:02:57.149 --> 00:02:57.159 
then once you get full void providing

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.459 
then once you get full void providing
you<00:02:57.310> use<00:02:57.489> range<00:02:57.819> you<00:02:58.389> can<00:02:58.540> use<00:02:58.659> like<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.870> magic

00:02:59.459 --> 00:02:59.469

ogres it's going to be extremely slow
experience<00:03:44.259> and<00:03:44.439> I<00:03:44.500> would<00:03:44.739> not<00:03:44.889> recommend<00:03:45.069> it

00:03:45.509 --> 00:03:45.519

so<00:03:46.239> range<00:03:46.780> training<00:03:47.199> is<00:03:47.319> something<00:03:47.739> expensive

so range training is something expensive

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
questions that you guys might ask so the

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.279 
questions that you guys might ask so the
first<00:04:32.520> question<00:04:32.669> I<00:04:32.879> thought<00:04:33.090> of<00:04:33.270> was<00:04:33.599> how<00:04:33.960> do<00:04:34.020> I

00:04:34.279 --> 00:04:34.289 
first question I thought of was how do I

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:35.209 
first question I thought of was how do I
get<00:04:34.349> void<00:04:34.710> Armour

00:04:35.209 --> 00:04:35.219 
get void Armour

00:04:35.219 --> 00:04:36.679 
get void Armour
this<00:04:35.370> might<00:04:35.580> seem<00:04:35.789> straightforward<00:04:36.389> but<00:04:36.539> not

00:04:36.679 --> 00:04:36.689 
this might seem straightforward but not

00:04:36.689 --> 00:04:38.450 
this might seem straightforward but not
everyone<00:04:36.960> might<00:04:37.139> know<00:04:37.349> how<00:04:37.560> so<00:04:37.979> the<00:04:38.099> answer<00:04:38.430> is

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
everyone might know how so the answer is

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.760 
everyone might know how so the answer is
via<00:04:38.969> the<00:04:39.090> pest-control<00:04:39.360> minigame<00:04:40.110> it's<00:04:40.680> a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:40.770 
via the pest-control minigame it's a

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:42.499 
via the pest-control minigame it's a
fairly<00:04:40.979> straightforward<00:04:41.189> minigame<00:04:41.969> however

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
fairly straightforward minigame however

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:44.899 
fairly straightforward minigame however
it<00:04:42.689> does<00:04:42.840> require<00:04:42.870> a<00:04:43.409> minimum<00:04:43.770> of<00:04:44.159> 40<00:04:44.520> combat

00:04:44.899 --> 00:04:44.909 
it does require a minimum of 40 combat

00:04:44.909 --> 00:04:46.610 
it does require a minimum of 40 combat
so<00:04:45.389> I<00:04:45.419> would<00:04:45.659> get<00:04:45.840> up<00:04:45.900> some<00:04:46.110> levels<00:04:46.409> before

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:46.620 
so I would get up some levels before

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:48.589 
so I would get up some levels before
going<00:04:46.979> to<00:04:47.069> do<00:04:47.249> that<00:04:47.460> if<00:04:47.879> you<00:04:48.180> want<00:04:48.330> some<00:04:48.509> extra

ninety nine range be one thing to take
into<00:04:59.159> consideration<00:04:59.849> is<00:05:00.029> that<00:05:00.060> you<00:05:00.659> don't

however<00:05:08.310> it<00:05:08.610> does<00:05:08.789> depend<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.180> what<00:05:09.240> methods

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:09.689

you<00:05:09.779> use<00:05:10.080> and<00:05:10.319> I<00:05:10.650> would<00:05:10.860> say<00:05:11.069> on<00:05:11.099> average<00:05:11.490> it's

00:05:11.929 --> 00:05:11.939 
you use and I would say on average it's

00:05:11.939 --> 00:05:14.119

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:18.210 
noticed that throughout this guide I

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:19.790 
noticed that throughout this guide I
haven't<00:05:18.509> talked<00:05:18.719> about<00:05:18.870> vengeance<00:05:19.500> at<00:05:19.620> all

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:19.800 
haven't talked about vengeance at all

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.469 
haven't talked about vengeance at all
and<00:05:20.069> that<00:05:20.099> is<00:05:20.520> because<00:05:20.819> I<00:05:20.909> want<00:05:21.089> to<00:05:21.240> show<00:05:21.389> you

and that is because I want to show you

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:23.360 
and that is because I want to show you
guys<00:05:21.629> strictly<00:05:22.409> the<00:05:22.589> requirements<00:05:23.189> for<00:05:23.310> a

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
guys strictly the requirements for a

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.070 
guys strictly the requirements for a
void<00:05:23.669> P<00:05:23.909> care<00:05:24.180> as<00:05:24.389> they<00:05:24.629> do<00:05:24.689> not<00:05:24.930> necessarily

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
void P care as they do not necessarily

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.200 
void P care as they do not necessarily
have<00:05:25.409> to<00:05:25.680> have<00:05:25.770> vengeance<00:05:26.009> however<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.849> is<00:05:26.999> a

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.210 
have to have vengeance however it is a

00:05:27.210 --> 00:05:29.179 
have to have vengeance however it is a
great<00:05:27.629> advantage<00:05:27.930> to<00:05:28.319> be<00:05:28.409> a<00:05:28.439> vengeance<00:05:28.830> pika

00:05:29.179 --> 00:05:29.189 
great advantage to be a vengeance pika

00:05:29.189 --> 00:05:31.189 
great advantage to be a vengeance pika
so<00:05:29.669> I<00:05:29.699> thought<00:05:29.969> that<00:05:30.180> I<00:05:30.210> would<00:05:30.300> put<00:05:30.539> on<00:05:30.599> here<00:05:30.930> do

00:05:31.189 --> 00:05:31.199 
so I thought that I would put on here do

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:32.600 
so I thought that I would put on here do
any<00:05:31.349> vengeance<00:05:31.830> to<00:05:31.919> be<00:05:32.009> an<00:05:32.069> effective<00:05:32.400> voice

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:32.610 
any vengeance to be an effective voice

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.790 
any vengeance to be an effective voice
range<00:05:32.879> P<00:05:33.060> care<00:05:33.270> and<00:05:33.449> the<00:05:33.930> answer<00:05:34.169> is<00:05:34.319> at<00:05:34.560> low

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800 
range P care and the answer is at low

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.890 
range P care and the answer is at low
level<00:05:35.129> you<00:05:35.339> won't<00:05:35.520> be<00:05:35.699> affected<00:05:35.939> it<00:05:36.330> is<00:05:36.569> highly

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
level you won't be affected it is highly

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.300 
level you won't be affected it is highly
unlikely<00:05:37.020> that<00:05:37.379> other<00:05:37.620> players<00:05:37.889> will<00:05:38.129> have

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:38.310 
unlikely that other players will have

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:40.070 
unlikely that other players will have
vengeance<00:05:38.580> so<00:05:39.389> you're<00:05:39.539> not<00:05:39.599> going<00:05:39.779> to<00:05:39.839> have<00:05:39.960> to

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
vengeance so you're not going to have to

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.079 
vengeance so you're not going to have to
worry<00:05:40.259> about<00:05:40.379> it<00:05:40.620> at<00:05:40.770> low<00:05:41.039> level<00:05:41.370> however<00:05:41.699> as

worry about it at low level however as

00:05:42.089 --> 00:05:43.670 
worry about it at low level however as
you<00:05:42.300> move<00:05:42.449> on<00:05:42.569> to<00:05:42.689> higher<00:05:42.839> level<00:05:43.080> peaking<00:05:43.500> and

consideration<00:05:52.649> before<00:05:53.370> we<00:05:53.610> wrap<00:05:53.759> this<00:05:53.789> up<00:05:53.969> is

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:54.300 
consideration before we wrap this up is

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.200 
consideration before we wrap this up is
can<00:05:55.169> I<00:05:55.199> train<00:05:55.529> my<00:05:55.680> melee<00:05:55.919> stats<00:05:56.310> as<00:05:56.520> a<00:05:56.550> void<00:05:56.789> PK

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
can I train my melee stats as a void PK

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.760 
can I train my melee stats as a void PK
I<00:05:57.389> know<00:05:57.479> a<00:05:57.659> lot<00:05:57.990> of<00:05:58.020> people<00:05:58.319> have<00:05:58.439> asked<00:05:58.680> me

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
I know a lot of people have asked me

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.499 
I know a lot of people have asked me
this<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.099> the<00:05:59.339> answer<00:05:59.610> is<00:05:59.759> you<00:05:59.969> can<00:06:00.240> train

00:06:00.499 --> 00:06:00.509 
this and the answer is you can train

00:06:00.509 --> 00:06:02.089 
this and the answer is you can train
them<00:06:00.659> to<00:06:00.719> the<00:06:00.899> same<00:06:01.080> level<00:06:01.379> as<00:06:01.439> your<00:06:01.560> range<00:06:01.830> and

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099 
them to the same level as your range and

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.499 
them to the same level as your range and
they<00:06:02.370> will<00:06:02.550> not<00:06:02.699> affect<00:06:02.909> your<00:06:03.060> combat<00:06:03.360> level

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
they will not affect your combat level

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:05.360 
they will not affect your combat level
however<00:06:04.080> you<00:06:04.740> have<00:06:04.860> to<00:06:04.889> take<00:06:05.159> into

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
however you have to take into

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:06.980 
however you have to take into
consideration<00:06:05.399> that<00:06:06.389> training<00:06:06.719> up<00:06:06.810> your

00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:06.990 
consideration that training up your

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:08.929 
consideration that training up your
combat<00:06:07.349> stats<00:06:07.710> or<00:06:08.009> your<00:06:08.279> melee<00:06:08.550> start<00:06:08.789> should

00:06:08.929 --> 00:06:08.939 
combat stats or your melee start should

00:06:08.939 --> 00:06:10.820 
combat stats or your melee start should
I<00:06:09.060> say<00:06:09.270> will<00:06:09.599> affect<00:06:09.899> your<00:06:09.990> HP<00:06:10.349> level<00:06:10.649> and

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 
I say will affect your HP level and

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:12.379 
I say will affect your HP level and
obviously<00:06:11.279> this<00:06:11.490> does<00:06:11.699> affect<00:06:11.939> your<00:06:12.060> combat

00:06:12.379 --> 00:06:12.389 
obviously this does affect your combat

00:06:12.389 --> 00:06:14.089 
obviously this does affect your combat
level<00:06:12.689> if<00:06:12.960> you<00:06:13.259> want<00:06:13.349> to<00:06:13.500> work<00:06:13.620> out<00:06:13.860> how<00:06:14.039> many

00:06:14.089 --> 00:06:14.099 
level if you want to work out how many

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:16.129 
level if you want to work out how many
levels<00:06:14.460> you<00:06:14.669> can<00:06:14.939> level<00:06:15.210> up<00:06:15.360> you<00:06:15.839> can<00:06:15.990> use<00:06:16.020> a

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:16.139 
levels you can level up you can use a

00:06:16.139 --> 00:06:17.869 
levels you can level up you can use a
combat<00:06:16.560> calculator<00:06:17.009> which<00:06:17.250> I<00:06:17.370> will<00:06:17.580> link<00:06:17.729> in

thought I would show you guys as some

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.999 
thought I would show you guys as some
final<00:06:30.029> thoughts<00:06:30.240> some<00:06:31.169> of<00:06:31.289> my<00:06:31.439> levels<00:06:31.800> as<00:06:31.979> you

00:06:31.999 --> 00:06:32.009 
final thoughts some of my levels as you

00:06:32.009 --> 00:06:34.129 
final thoughts some of my levels as you
can<00:06:32.189> see<00:06:32.370> here<00:06:32.580> I<00:06:32.610> am<00:06:32.819> 80<00:06:33.000> range<00:06:33.389> and<00:06:33.659> I<00:06:33.930> did

00:06:34.129 --> 00:06:34.139 
can see here I am 80 range and I did

00:06:34.139 --> 00:06:36.020 
can see here I am 80 range and I did
decide<00:06:34.440> to<00:06:34.500> keep<00:06:34.740> 44<00:06:35.250> prayer<00:06:35.490> and

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
decide to keep 44 prayer and

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.790 
decide to keep 44 prayer and
find<00:06:36.240> this<00:06:36.330> is<00:06:36.510> a<00:06:36.540> very<00:06:36.840> effective<00:06:37.020> setup<00:06:37.620> I

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800 
find this is a very effective setup I

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:39.140 
find this is a very effective setup I
thought<00:06:38.220> I<00:06:38.250> would<00:06:38.340> show<00:06:38.490> you<00:06:38.520> guys<00:06:38.760> from<00:06:39.000> the

thought I would show you guys from the

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.240 
thought I would show you guys from the
