00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:12.779
 more than you 

00:00:12.779 --> 00:00:15.459

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:18.099
 to take off 

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:21.560
 hln kh 4 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.010
 the hague they were 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.859
 8 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:27.859
 where many children become 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:34.970
 there are still more than eighty people injured 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.970
 wait work 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.910
 to get players 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.520
 or actually own house 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.520
 whatever term 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.970
 you see the boys and a girl 

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:54.970
 I'm done with you have a hot tip 

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:57.910
 what a drama 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:01.550
 but yes now wanted a good result with it 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.590
 Laura Robson 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:10.930
 6 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.890
 gaza city the athletes 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.890
 collaboration 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.580
 to expand again after more than a year 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.870
 directly after 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.050
 why this is not a problem 

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.789
 antwerp then strains nicely to the farmer 

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:35.789
 mole becomes again 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.550
 what do you think 

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.550
 much smaller 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:45.410
 to haggle 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.260
 it is a difference 

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.910
 ep recovers 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.870
 but there's more 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.440
 I like it 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.300
 this evil 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.670
 we get 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.670
 maybe 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.279
 cost price 

00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:15.279
 according to 

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:26.419
 9 

00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:29.239
 that's why i think 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:31.939
 I think I am crazy what he says 

00:02:31.939 --> 00:02:34.339
 Hey 

00:02:34.339 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.139
 fernandez 

00:02:40.139 --> 00:02:43.139
 hand out penalties 

00:02:44.479 --> 00:02:47.479
 noise 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.169
 without work
