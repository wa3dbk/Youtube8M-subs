 not that if you want a new folder 

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.850
 that you are already going to shoot away 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.850
 that is not my personal issue 

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:15.140

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.459

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:17.660
 in front of 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.190
 look at being a little young 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:25.269

 too bad time well that car under 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:45.340
 i think i would say dying 

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:47.580
 then tried everything a bit 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.580
 Search 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:52.320
 so we had no more around it 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:58.530
 always nice to see 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.530
 all those corridors and 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:13.740
 close sniper malloot i know that dead and 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.740
 for me a lot of things fall here 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.130
 well do not know where traces 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:30.240
 high and often had a really 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:32.490
 also because i dumped but soup itself 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.260
 all open folder 

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.320
 the car you see is a middle in itself 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:41.760
 good nice thought 

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:42.990

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.950

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:51.770
 think you have been looking nice so far 

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.770
 the joke above it, by the way, and 

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:59.070
 pity evy around it I've already learned that 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:00.960
 you out if you go into a duel and you you 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:03.810

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.550
 the tea sometimes makes that stupid 

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:07.550
 mistakes then what to continue in 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:17.430
 here you can walk around what fuck well 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.019
 what the failure I 've realized is doubting what 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.970
 I have to do but you will have to be there 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:22.200

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.420
 By default you just need so much more 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.780
 over to the outside of him 

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:26.780

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:58.350
 so the people better and they just say it 

00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.840
 but keep saying that the sound does 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:01.590
 I in this game is terrible sand 

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.910
 to hear 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:05.960

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:09.889
 much with lightning strike it 

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:11.539
 with mp3 and I think it is one 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.720
 bit of a shame is that it is still gone 

00:05:11.539 --> 00:05:13.720

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:21.050

 other avoided verdi mab is okay well it 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:28.220
 all looks so open though 

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:33.860
 big advantage from the icon with 3 kills 

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:35.900

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.770

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.770
