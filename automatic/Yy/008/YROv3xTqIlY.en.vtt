00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
tip of the day it has to do with

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.910 
tip of the day it has to do with
dungeoneering<00:00:33.300> and<00:00:33.600> I'm<00:00:34.380> right<00:00:34.590> next<00:00:34.739> to

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
dungeoneering and I'm right next to

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.440 
dungeoneering and I'm right next to
these<00:00:35.100> things<00:00:35.430> the<00:00:35.670> scaling<00:00:36.090> plots<00:00:36.300> that

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:36.450 
these things the scaling plots that

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.720 
these things the scaling plots that
probably<00:00:36.930> you<00:00:36.989> already<00:00:37.110> knew<00:00:37.380> this<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.550> was

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
probably you already knew this one was

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.610 
probably you already knew this one was
sent<00:00:38.910> in<00:00:39.030> by<00:00:39.059> ryfi<00:00:39.750> leader<00:00:40.140> in<00:00:40.290> my<00:00:40.350> clan

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
sent in by ryfi leader in my clan

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.069 
sent in by ryfi leader in my clan
actually<00:00:41.040> and<00:00:41.430> he's<00:00:41.520> really<00:00:41.760> cool<00:00:41.910> dude<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.420> so

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
actually and he's really cool dude so so

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.410 
actually and he's really cool dude so so
basically<00:00:43.230> you<00:00:43.710> go<00:00:43.860> on<00:00:44.070> c2<00:00:44.370> floors<00:00:44.879> which<00:00:45.239> is

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
basically you go on c2 floors which is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.420 
basically you go on c2 floors which is
complexity<00:00:45.870> to<00:00:46.230> if<00:00:46.680> you're<00:00:46.800> not<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.160> fond

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
complexity to if you're not really fond

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:48.110 
complexity to if you're not really fond
of<00:00:47.550> dungeoneering

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:48.120 
of dungeoneering

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.990 
of dungeoneering
and<00:00:48.559> you<00:00:49.559> can<00:00:49.739> fish<00:00:50.010> in<00:00:50.190> wood<00:00:50.399> cut<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:50.760> they

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
and you can fish in wood cut and they

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.520 
and you can fish in wood cut and they
have<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> lot<00:00:51.420> of<00:00:51.449> spawns<00:00:51.809> for<00:00:52.110> these<00:00:52.289> things

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
have a lot of spawns for these things

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.569 
have a lot of spawns for these things
yeah<00:00:52.829> it<00:00:52.949> gives<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> lot<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.430> experience

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
yeah it gives you a lot of experience

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:55.310 
yeah it gives you a lot of experience
and<00:00:54.090> remember<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.510> buy<00:00:54.600> feathers<00:00:55.050> at<00:00:55.230> the

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
and remember to buy feathers at the

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.229 
and remember to buy feathers at the
beginning<00:00:55.860> of<00:00:55.980> each<00:00:56.160> floor<00:00:56.489> and<00:00:56.550> you're<00:00:57.059> just

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
beginning of each floor and you're just

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.029 
beginning of each floor and you're just
fish<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> just<00:00:57.750> watch<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.320> expedience<00:00:58.920> that

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
fish and just watch the expedience that

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.650 
fish and just watch the expedience that
you<00:00:59.100> get<00:00:59.250> on<00:00:59.399> here<00:00:59.670> it's<00:01:00.120> just<00:01:00.329> nearly

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
you get on here it's just nearly

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.569 
you get on here it's just nearly
constant<00:01:01.320> and<00:01:01.440> it<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:02.190> this<00:01:02.340> one's

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
constant and it actually this one's

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:03.020 
constant and it actually this one's
halved

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
halved

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.030 
halved
they<00:01:03.510> did<00:01:03.719> a<00:01:03.750> patch<00:01:04.019> like<00:01:04.049> a<00:01:04.350> year<00:01:04.650> ago<00:01:04.680> that

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
they did a patch like a year ago that

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.000 
they did a patch like a year ago that
made<00:01:05.220> some<00:01:05.909> plots<00:01:06.240> give<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.689> half<00:01:06.900> XP<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
made some plots give you half XP so this

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.070 
made some plots give you half XP so this
one<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.369> half<00:01:08.520> XP<00:01:08.850> and<00:01:09.000> look<00:01:09.090> at<00:01:09.240> 70<00:01:09.659> each<00:01:09.840> and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
one is half XP and look at 70 each and

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.440 
one is half XP and look at 70 each and
that's<00:01:10.200> still<00:01:10.439> pretty<00:01:10.680> decent<00:01:11.159> for<00:01:11.189> half<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:12.420> I

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
that's still pretty decent for half so I

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:13.730 
that's still pretty decent for half so I
finished<00:01:12.750> that<00:01:12.869> plot<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.350> let's<00:01:13.470> go<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> the

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
finished that plot and let's go to the

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.039 
finished that plot and let's go to the
next<00:01:13.799> one<00:01:14.010> hopefully<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.369> not<00:01:14.520> half<00:01:15.049> it's

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
next one hopefully it's not half it's

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.660 
next one hopefully it's not half it's
not<00:01:16.290> half<00:01:16.470> so<00:01:16.680> see<00:01:16.890> it's<00:01:17.100> like<00:01:17.220> the<00:01:17.340> exact<00:01:17.640> same

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
not half so see it's like the exact same

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:20.060 
not half so see it's like the exact same
speed<00:01:18.180> and<00:01:18.420> I<00:01:18.479> get<00:01:18.600> 153<00:01:19.470> so<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> do<00:01:19.950> this

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
speed and I get 153 so if you do this

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.580 
speed and I get 153 so if you do this
over<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.520> over<00:01:20.729> on<00:01:20.909> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.659> easily<00:01:22.020> get<00:01:22.170> 100k

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
over and over on you can easily get 100k

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.530 
over and over on you can easily get 100k
fishing<00:01:23.040> an<00:01:23.130> hour<00:01:23.250> and<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.759> think<00:01:24.000> 90k

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
fishing an hour and I think 90k

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.230 
fishing an hour and I think 90k
woodcutting<00:01:25.040> I'm<00:01:26.040> not<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.549> hundred<00:01:26.790> percent<00:01:26.909> on

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
woodcutting I'm not a hundred percent on

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.179 
woodcutting I'm not a hundred percent on
that<00:01:27.299> statistic<00:01:28.140> but<00:01:28.380> it's<00:01:28.590> pretty<00:01:28.770> close<00:01:29.009> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
that statistic but it's pretty close to

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.740 
that statistic but it's pretty close to
around<00:01:29.310> there<00:01:29.520> and<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.150> really<00:01:30.329> good<00:01:30.509> if<00:01:30.630> you

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
around there and it's really good if you

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.749 
around there and it's really good if you
want<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.320> for<00:01:31.500> 99<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.130> you<00:01:32.400> don't<00:01:32.579> really

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
want to go for 99 and you don't really

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.399 
want to go for 99 and you don't really
need<00:01:32.939> the<00:01:33.090> money<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.450> just<00:01:33.900> need<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.140> speed

chance<00:03:03.120> of<00:03:03.239> getting<00:03:03.450> one<00:03:03.630> so<00:03:03.780> it's<00:03:03.900> even

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110 
chance of getting one so it's even

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.280 
chance of getting one so it's even
better<00:03:04.260> on<00:03:04.440> the<00:03:04.790> penguin<00:03:05.790> get<00:03:06.510> dead<00:03:06.660> XP<00:03:06.989> this

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
better on the penguin get dead XP this

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.979 
better on the penguin get dead XP this
is<00:03:07.470> about<00:03:07.680> 500k<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.549> the<00:03:08.640> GE<00:03:08.850> but<00:03:09.299> it's<00:03:09.660> kind<00:03:09.930> of

00:03:09.979 --> 00:03:09.989 
is about 500k in the GE but it's kind of

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.410 
is about 500k in the GE but it's kind of
hard<00:03:10.110> to<00:03:10.170> buy<00:03:10.380> so<00:03:10.799> if<00:03:11.370> you're<00:03:11.819> really<00:03:12.060> good<00:03:12.299> at

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
hard to buy so if you're really good at

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.240 
hard to buy so if you're really good at
ports<00:03:12.750> you<00:03:13.019> might<00:03:13.230> get<00:03:13.380> these<00:03:13.500> yourselves<00:03:14.069> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
ports you might get these yourselves and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.949 
ports you might get these yourselves and
there's<00:03:14.700> also<00:03:14.850> a<00:03:15.000> superior<00:03:15.510> version<00:03:15.720> which

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
there's also a superior version which

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.229 
there's also a superior version which
gives<00:03:16.170> you<00:03:16.260> 400%<00:03:17.100> and<00:03:17.250> I<00:03:17.670> think<00:03:17.850> is<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.060> same

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:18.239 
gives you 400% and I think is the same

00:03:18.239 --> 00:03:19.490 
gives you 400% and I think is the same
amount<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.510> charges<00:03:18.900> so<00:03:19.019> it<00:03:19.109> lasts<00:03:19.380> about

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
amount of charges so it lasts about

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.759 
amount of charges so it lasts about
three<00:03:19.920> hours<00:03:20.070> and<00:03:20.430> basically<00:03:21.530> these<00:03:22.530> together

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:22.769 
three hours and basically these together

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:25.130 
three hours and basically these together
give<00:03:23.220> you<00:03:23.430> nearly<00:03:23.940> three<00:03:24.329> hundred<00:03:24.359> and<00:03:24.720> fifty

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
give you nearly three hundred and fifty

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.110 
give you nearly three hundred and fifty
percent<00:03:25.500> more<00:03:25.769> chance<00:03:26.579> of<00:03:26.700> having<00:03:26.820> birds

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
percent more chance of having birds

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.620 
percent more chance of having birds
nests<00:03:27.359> is<00:03:27.510> what<00:03:27.720> I've<00:03:27.840> heard<00:03:28.140> so<00:03:29.420> I'm<00:03:30.420> not

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
nests is what I've heard so I'm not

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.539 
nests is what I've heard so I'm not
going<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:30.840> use<00:03:31.170> this<00:03:31.440> but<00:03:31.799> basically<00:03:31.920> you<00:03:32.400> know

00:03:32.539 --> 00:03:32.549 
going to use this but basically you know

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:33.979 
going to use this but basically you know
how<00:03:32.700> to<00:03:32.760> wood<00:03:32.970> cut<00:03:33.150> so<00:03:33.299> that's<00:03:33.390> how<00:03:33.600> you<00:03:33.660> do<00:03:33.840> it

00:03:33.979 --> 00:03:33.989 
how to wood cut so that's how you do it

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:35.390 
how to wood cut so that's how you do it
so<00:03:34.410> it's<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.560> nice<00:03:34.680> little<00:03:34.739> thing<00:03:35.130> if<00:03:35.250> you're

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
so it's a nice little thing if you're

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.620 
so it's a nice little thing if you're
going<00:03:35.640> for<00:03:35.820> ninety<00:03:36.030> nine<00:03:36.060> we're<00:03:36.269> cutting<00:03:36.510> and

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
going for ninety nine we're cutting and

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.449 
going for ninety nine we're cutting and
want<00:03:36.810> to<00:03:36.870> make<00:03:36.959> a<00:03:36.989> little<00:03:37.200> money<00:03:37.350> too<00:03:37.620> so<00:03:38.280> the

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:38.459 
want to make a little money too so the

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:40.250 
want to make a little money too so the
next<00:03:38.640> tip<00:03:38.880> isn't<00:03:39.090> really<00:03:39.450> like<00:03:39.480> super<00:03:39.930> top

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
next tip isn't really like super top

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.289 
next tip isn't really like super top
secret<00:03:40.739> or<00:03:40.859> anything<00:03:41.070> it's<00:03:41.700> really<00:03:42.000> just<00:03:42.150> a

00:03:42.289 --> 00:03:42.299 
secret or anything it's really just a

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:44.030 
secret or anything it's really just a
way<00:03:42.420> of<00:03:42.570> playing<00:03:42.720> that<00:03:43.170> really<00:03:43.530> can<00:03:43.680> increase

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
way of playing that really can increase

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.770 
way of playing that really can increase
your<00:03:44.310> bank<00:03:44.880> and<00:03:45.090> everything<00:03:45.299> else<00:03:45.570> on

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:45.780 
your bank and everything else on

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:48.140 
your bank and everything else on
runescape<00:03:45.989> so<00:03:46.920> let's<00:03:47.220> say<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.459> make<00:03:47.700> ten<00:03:47.940> mill

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:48.150 
runescape so let's say you make ten mill

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:50.509 
runescape so let's say you make ten mill
one<00:03:48.420> day<00:03:48.600> so<00:03:49.320> what<00:03:49.530> you<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.799> is<00:03:50.070> you<00:03:50.250> put<00:03:50.489> a

00:03:50.509 --> 00:03:50.519 
one day so what you do is you put a

00:03:50.519 --> 00:03:53.630 
one day so what you do is you put a
percentage<00:03:50.970> away<00:03:51.269> in<00:03:51.870> savings<00:03:52.590> or<00:03:52.829> towards<00:03:53.549> a

00:03:53.630 --> 00:03:53.640 
percentage away in savings or towards a

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.130 
percentage away in savings or towards a
goal<00:03:53.820> that<00:03:54.060> you<00:03:54.150> have<00:03:54.359> it's<00:03:54.750> like<00:03:54.930> kind<00:03:55.109> of

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
goal that you have it's like kind of

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.690 
goal that you have it's like kind of
like<00:03:55.260> what<00:03:55.440> you<00:03:55.530> do<00:03:55.739> if<00:03:56.130> you're<00:03:56.280> on<00:03:56.340> a<00:03:56.430> budget

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
like what you do if you're on a budget

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.880 
like what you do if you're on a budget
in<00:03:57.030> real<00:03:57.209> life<00:03:57.420> just<00:03:57.989> on<00:03:58.109> runescape<00:03:58.350> it's<00:03:58.709> kind

00:03:58.880 --> 00:03:58.890 
in real life just on runescape it's kind

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.259 
in real life just on runescape it's kind
of<00:03:58.950> you<00:03:59.100> know<00:03:59.190> it<00:03:59.310> sounds<00:03:59.549> really<00:03:59.760> lame<00:03:59.970> and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
of you know it sounds really lame and

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:03.020 
of you know it sounds really lame and
superficial<00:04:01.260> and<00:04:01.290> all<00:04:01.440> that<00:04:01.560> but<00:04:01.760> it's<00:04:02.760> really

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
superficial and all that but it's really

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.000 
superficial and all that but it's really
really<00:04:03.239> useful<00:04:03.390> if<00:04:03.900> you<00:04:04.019> don't<00:04:04.650> have<00:04:04.799> a<00:04:04.829> lot<00:04:04.980> of

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:05.010 
really useful if you don't have a lot of

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.979 
really useful if you don't have a lot of
money<00:04:05.190> and<00:04:05.430> you<00:04:05.790> want<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.209> big<00:04:06.359> goals<00:04:06.600> of<00:04:06.810> like

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
money and you want the big goals of like

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.289 
money and you want the big goals of like
turmoil<00:04:07.500> and<00:04:07.709> overloads<00:04:08.130> and<00:04:08.549> drag<00:04:08.970> ores<00:04:09.209> and

00:04:09.289 --> 00:04:09.299 
turmoil and overloads and drag ores and

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:10.699 
turmoil and overloads and drag ores and
all<00:04:09.480> these<00:04:09.600> things<00:04:09.810> it<00:04:09.930> really<00:04:10.079> really<00:04:10.440> helps

00:04:10.699 --> 00:04:10.709 
all these things it really really helps

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:12.770 
all these things it really really helps
so<00:04:11.220> yeah<00:04:11.340> basically<00:04:11.519> like<00:04:12.090> if<00:04:12.239> you<00:04:12.359> make<00:04:12.510> 10

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:12.780 
so yeah basically like if you make 10

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:15.289 
so yeah basically like if you make 10
mill<00:04:12.959> you<00:04:13.950> put<00:04:14.250> like<00:04:14.489> two<00:04:14.700> mill<00:04:14.850> away<00:04:14.940> or

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:15.299 
mill you put like two mill away or

00:04:15.299 --> 00:04:17.150 
mill you put like two mill away or
whatever<00:04:16.049> amount<00:04:16.260> you<00:04:16.440> do<00:04:16.590> every<00:04:16.950> time<00:04:17.100> you

whatever amount you do every time you
take<00:04:17.400> make<00:04:17.729> around<00:04:18.060> ten<00:04:18.660> mill<00:04:18.870> you<00:04:19.229> put<00:04:19.440> that

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
take make around ten mill you put that

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.259 
take make around ten mill you put that
exact<00:04:19.889> amount<00:04:20.039> of<00:04:20.250> money<00:04:20.580> away<00:04:20.700> and<00:04:21.030> then<00:04:21.120> use

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:53.980 
if I do it every day on the rune that
I'm<00:04:53.660> doing

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:53.990 
I'm doing

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.840 
I'll get eighty million just this year
seems<00:04:57.050> like<00:04:57.229> a<00:04:57.260> long<00:04:57.470> time<00:04:57.680> but<00:04:57.740> 80<00:04:58.100> mil<00:04:58.400> for<00:04:58.669> no

00:04:58.840 --> 00:04:58.850 
seems like a long time but 80 mil for no

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.730 
seems like a long time but 80 mil for no
work<00:04:59.090> on<00:04:59.389> top<00:05:00.050> of<00:05:00.229> everything<00:05:00.470> I'm<00:05:00.710> doing

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:03.820 
work on top of everything I'm doing
already<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.850> a<00:05:01.970> big<00:05:02.180> big<00:05:02.479> boost<00:05:03.229> to<00:05:03.530> the<00:05:03.620> bank

inventory<00:05:11.540> of<00:05:11.780> essence<00:05:12.139> and<00:05:12.350> then<00:05:12.500> activate

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:13.280 
inventory of essence and then activate

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.670 
inventory of essence and then activate
your<00:05:13.400> hood<00:05:13.580> and<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:14.600> can<00:05:14.720> either<00:05:14.840> do<00:05:15.110> cosmics

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:15.680 
your hood and you can either do cosmics

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:17.650 
your hood and you can either do cosmics
or<00:05:15.860> Astral's<00:05:16.580> honestly<00:05:17.000> you<00:05:17.150> can<00:05:17.300> also<00:05:17.419> do

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.870 
or Astral's honestly you can also do
nature's<00:05:18.020> but<00:05:18.320> I<00:05:18.560> prefer<00:05:19.160> cosmics<00:05:19.639> because

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:19.880 
nature's but I prefer cosmics because

00:05:19.880 --> 00:05:21.850 
nature's but I prefer cosmics because
they're<00:05:20.030> more<00:05:20.180> stable<00:05:20.270> and<00:05:20.870> they're<00:05:21.620> pretty

00:05:21.850 --> 00:05:21.860 
they're more stable and they're pretty

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:23.620 
they're more stable and they're pretty
decent<00:05:22.250> price<00:05:22.400> at<00:05:22.610> this<00:05:22.880> point<00:05:23.120> of<00:05:23.210> recording

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:23.630 
decent price at this point of recording

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:24.850 
decent price at this point of recording
but<00:05:23.780> you<00:05:23.870> will<00:05:24.110> have<00:05:24.289> to<00:05:24.410> check<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.710> rune

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:24.860
