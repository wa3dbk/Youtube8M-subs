00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.460
 yes 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.609
 hello youtube I'm pizza head and 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.190
 welcome to Friday of vehicles in 

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:12.049
 this case on Saturday the theme of the week is 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.450
 the antiaircraft that vehicle about 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.650
 exploited and used more can not but 

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:17.390
 definitely a powerful tool 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.279
 to knock down those jets that are 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.169
 bothering your team for the same thing 

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:23.239
 this vehicle is so hated called by 

00:00:21.169 --> 00:00:25.189
 others do not this video in another tell them 

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:26.480
 are going to use it and that in 60 2 in the 

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:28.550
 base everything else but rather that 

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.890
 learn how it works and know in what 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.599
 circumstances use it I suggest 

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:34.460
 that they have pencil and paper at hand 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:36.110
 if any detail is lost some data and 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.730
 pause in the video if they need it since 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.620
 it's too much information that does not even 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.780
 can be put on the screen first 

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:44.089
 the main general details of 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:46.339
 this vehicle is for a single passenger 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:48.440
 that is to say the one that drives shoots has 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.989
 a maximum speed of 56 kilometers 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.449
 per hour and reappears on the map after 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:55.699
 60 seconds that yes on the servers 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.739
 normal now that if you are not 

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:00.079
 driving and they want to damage the previous 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.269
 enemy if you give him more than 29 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.699
 Damage points immediately will have 

00:01:02.269 --> 00:01:07.040
 slight damage that will mean that you do not 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:09.140
 will move so fast and will not be able to accelerate and 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.150
 if you apply 39 points of damage 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:13.130
 means severe damage so he 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.810
 will be immobilized for a few seconds 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.310
 to know more and visit the video of 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.290
 reactive shield that I did two years ago 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.120
 weeks and finally it is disabled 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.980
 this vehicle when it reaches 10 

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.840
 life points now let's go to the 

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:25.850
 canyons that here was a discovery 

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.320
 interesting since practically not 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.330
 It's good for the 30- barrel 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.280
 millimeters compared to 20 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.990
 millimeters let's see why first 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.490
 we go with the 20 millimeter cannon 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.840
 think that on the sheet and the paper for 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.270
 that you can compare later 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:40.910
 statistics every bullet that comes out of that 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.790
 5 millimeter cannon means 5 

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.800
 damage points against the infantry that 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.600
 it would mean that we would need 20 bullets 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:49.310
 but it's not very much problem because 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.310
 because it has a cadence of shots of 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.530
 2000 shots per minute also the 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.570
 bullet speed before was greater than the 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.300
 30 millimeters but now they are 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:01.550
 Paired with 800 meters on second 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.470
 that bullet is faster than any 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.869
 assault rifle directly any 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.119
 bullet of any infantry weapon in 

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.310
 the whole game for the same thing that shoots 

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:12.530
 2000 bullets per minute and that does not have a 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.780
 charger itself they can see how many 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.280
 bullets are missing here rather it applies a 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.530
 timer you can 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.209
 shoot without releasing the trigger for 6 

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.160
 after that the bullets are gone and 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.920
 will have to recharge how long it takes 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.660
 recharge three seconds we already mentioned that 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:28.730
 that bullet deals five damage 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:31.040
 against the infantry but as for 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.020
 various vehicles and different models 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.000
 of damage in the case let's start with 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.680
 air vehicles with the 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.770
 attack and reconnaissance helicopters 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.840
 each bullet is 1.6 points of damage in 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:44.150
 against that helicopter what 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.800
 it means they need 63 shots to 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:48.110
 shoot down a helicopter with full 

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.140
 health or what it would rather mean 

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:53.300
 shoot without failing for 1.87 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.489
 seconds as you can realize with 

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.080
 a single burst before recharging can 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:59.390
 destroy a helicopter very easily 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.390
 as soon as the transport helicopter 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.190
 it's not so high the damage is 1.1 per 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.260
 bullet which means that they have to 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.300
 shoot 91 shots without failing to 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.850
 knock down a helicopter anyway 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.560
 that takes 2 points 72 seconds with that 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:14.209
 Cadence of shots equal with only one 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.580
 blast can destroy a helicopter of 

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.880
 totally healthy transport the case of 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:21.560
 the aircraft is the famous 3% shot 

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.780
 that experienced pilots see that 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.220
 if you take damage and suddenly 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.470
 says from 100 to 97 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.180
 sure was the anti-aircraft to bring down 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:32.060
 any type of airplane within the game 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.370
 they need 39 shots or what it would mean 

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:37.880
 a burst for 1 point 15 seconds 

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.780
 without failing even without failing faster 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:41.120
 that what I would find a 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:43.850
 helicopter as you can realize the 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.310
 Antiaircraft name is serious if you 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.720
 they face for example a tank or 

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:50.600
 an infantry combat vehicle u 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:53.690
 another antiaircraft thing changes too much 

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:55.520
 so they can see how it is better to flee if 

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.290
 you are in a heads up against a 

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.760
 tank without some help if you guys 

00:03:57.290 --> 00:04:02.030
 they want to destroy a tank they need 

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.800
 hit him 667 shots in the part of 

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:06.230
 ahead or what it would mean 

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.270
 shoot him for 20 seconds in a row 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:10.490
 without failing although we know that nothing else 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:13.190
 you can shoot a maximum of 6 seconds 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:16.880
 followed if you shoot aside the shots 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:19.100
 they go down a little 435 shots or whatever 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:21.769
 it would be 13 seconds in a row if you 

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.350
 shoot in the back are 264 

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:26.390
 Necessary shots and 8 seconds of burst 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:28.460
 Anyway, any of these 

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:30.260
 versions where they hit you will mean 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.180
 that they will have to recharge at least one 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:33.710
 time its main cannon 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.570
 against infantry fighting vehicles 

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:39.620
 if you shoot to the front in this in 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:41.030
 556 shots or 17 seconds shots or if 

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.350
 you shoot towards the side of a 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.550
 infantry fighting vehicle in 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.169
 is in 454 shots or 14 seconds without 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.000
 However, if a previous 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:52.400
 against an anti-aircraft and they start to 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.699
 fight death both will need 

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.770
 shoot each other 334 shots or what 

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:59.840
 equivalent to 10-second bursts 

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:02.419
 how can you tell at the moment 

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:04.639
 is away from land vehicles 

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:06.289
 and focus on what the 

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.910
 aerial vehicles 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:09.889
 now let's move on to the 30-barrel 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:11.810
 millimeters I hope you have pointed the 

00:05:09.889 --> 00:05:13.430
 most important data of the 20 cannon 

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.530
 millimeters if they can not come back in 

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:17.840
 any time to any part of the 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:20.389
 small 30-millimeter video instead 

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.669
 give 5 damage points for 17 points 

00:05:20.389 --> 00:05:24.979
 damage to the infantry that apparently 

00:05:22.669 --> 00:05:27.680
 it's good but the rate of shots 

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.750
 from 600 shots per minute over 

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.090
 three times slower than what would be the 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:34.160
 20 mm cannon that's a 

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.229
 disadvantage the bullet speed is equal 

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.449
 of 800 meters on second why not 

00:05:36.229 --> 00:05:39.820
 worry but that if only 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:42.830
 they can shoot durán 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:44.480
 3.5 seconds what does not work because 

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:46.460
 it's almost half the time of what 

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:47.060
 they could shoot with a 20 cannon 

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:49.190
 millimeters 

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:51.170
 the recharge lasts 3 seconds 

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:53.330
 then do not worry about it in 

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:55.820
 differentiate one from the other now 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:57.710
 let's move on to the damage to the vehicles if 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:59.240
 well this bullet is more powerful then 

00:05:57.710 --> 00:06:01.520
 should destroy less shots to a 

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.100
 helicopter to a wat tank or to any 

00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.600
 thing not and that yes is correct but the 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:07.760
 problem is that you need less shots 

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:10.760
 but having a cadence of shots almost 

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:12.140
 three times four times slower than 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:14.240
 that would be the 20-millimeter though 

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:15.710
 are few bullets can not shoot 

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:17.630
 fast enough that the 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.610
 large amount of bullets they need 

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:22.010
 shoot with 20 millimeters at what 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.330
 I mean for example you would be 21 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:24.490
 shots to destroy a helicopter 

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:26.900
 attack or recognition 

00:06:24.490 --> 00:06:29.360
 they are definitely less shots than 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:31.340
 that they would need with 63 of 20 millimeters 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:33.710
 but the problem is that to shoot 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:36.860
 that minimum amount of 21 shots 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.840
 They need 2.08 seconds while 

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.960
 to shoot 63 shots with the cannon 

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:43.790
 20 millimeters only needed 1.87 

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:45.650
 seconds to that I mean then 

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:46.729
 let's pass the other statistics 

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.910
 for a transport helicopter 

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:51.560
 they need 32 shots 3 points 2 seconds 

00:06:49.910 --> 00:06:54.110
 of bursts in a few words 

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:56.030
 that is the same more time than what 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:58.039
 would be the 20 millimeters and so we 

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:59.509
 we could go for each vehicle and see 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:01.370
 that although it is in less 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.229
 number of bullets will take longer in 

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:05.180
 shoot that amount so in 

00:07:03.229 --> 00:07:07.910
 conclusion the 20 mm cannon is 

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:09.560
 totally superior for three reasons a 

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.479
 high cadence allows you to be able to 

00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.880
 wrong to point from time to time 

00:07:11.479 --> 00:07:15.949
 it also requires that fewer shots be fired 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.930
 or rather, shoot for less time
