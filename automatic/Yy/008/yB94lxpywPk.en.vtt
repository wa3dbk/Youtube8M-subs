the other side of the ball on any given
play<00:00:41.309> he<00:00:41.850> could<00:00:42.059> be<00:00:42.210> there<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.629> do<00:00:42.989> something

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
play he could be there and do something

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.440

damaging<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.100> you<00:00:44.219> next<00:00:44.760> up<00:00:44.879> is<00:00:45.000> the<00:00:45.149> clutch

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
damaging to you next up is the clutch

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.700 
damaging to you next up is the clutch
factor<00:00:45.899> how<00:00:46.020> much<00:00:46.170> they've<00:00:46.350> done<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.590> in<00:00:46.649> the

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
factor how much they've done it in the

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.020 
factor how much they've done it in the
critical<00:00:47.100> moments<00:00:47.430> of<00:00:47.520> a<00:00:47.579> game

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
critical moments of a game

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.639 
critical moments of a game

we gave the mark to James Harrison I

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.290 
we gave the mark to James Harrison I
think<00:00:49.860> we<00:00:49.980> were<00:00:50.070> at<00:00:50.430> least<00:00:50.640> I<00:00:50.789> was<00:00:50.969> thinking

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
think we were at least I was thinking

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.340 
think we were at least I was thinking
about<00:00:51.390> the<00:00:51.629> Super<00:00:51.899> Bowl<00:00:51.930> against<00:00:52.230> the

about the Super Bowl against the

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.779 
about the Super Bowl against the
Cardinals<00:00:52.770> in<00:00:52.860> his<00:00:52.980> long<00:00:53.160> touchdown<00:00:53.640> return

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
Cardinals in his long touchdown return

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.060 
Cardinals in his long touchdown return
moments<00:00:54.690> like<00:00:54.840> that<00:00:54.870> gave<00:00:55.350> him<00:00:55.500> the<00:00:55.620> check<00:00:55.829> I

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
moments like that gave him the check I

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.560 
moments like that gave him the check I
had<00:00:56.309> trouble<00:00:56.640> with<00:00:56.670> this<00:00:56.850> one<00:00:57.030> I<00:00:57.239> didn't<00:00:57.480> know

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
had trouble with this one I didn't know

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.790 
had trouble with this one I didn't know
if<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.780> could<00:00:57.809> give<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.350> either<00:00:58.469> guy<00:00:58.770> I

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
if I could give it to either guy I

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.290 
if I could give it to either guy I
really<00:00:59.160> feel<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.520> gave<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.850> slightest

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
really feel like I gave the slightest

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.970 
really feel like I gave the slightest
edge<00:01:00.449> to<00:01:00.629> pull<00:01:00.809> them<00:01:00.930> all<00:01:01.020> but<00:01:01.440> really<00:01:01.739> either

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
edge to pull them all but really either

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.709 
edge to pull them all but really either
one<00:01:02.250> I<00:01:02.280> think<00:01:02.430> and<00:01:02.730> win<00:01:02.879> this<00:01:03.000> award<00:01:03.149> both<00:01:03.570> of

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
one I think and win this award both of

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.210 
one I think and win this award both of
me<00:01:03.840> it's<00:01:03.960> so<00:01:04.140> many<00:01:04.260> clutch<00:01:04.559> plays<00:01:04.830> over<00:01:05.129> the

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
me it's so many clutch plays over the

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.340 
me it's so many clutch plays over the
years<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:05.909> the<00:01:06.060> next<00:01:06.330> category<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.840> the<00:01:07.110> game

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
years then the next category is the game

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.560 
years then the next category is the game
breaker<00:01:07.680> factor<00:01:08.220> which<00:01:08.640> guy<00:01:08.880> can<00:01:09.119> summon<00:01:09.420> up

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
breaker factor which guy can summon up

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.420 
breaker factor which guy can summon up
that<00:01:09.750> big<00:01:09.960> play<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.260> momentum<00:01:10.979> changing

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
that big play that momentum changing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.760 
that big play that momentum changing
play<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:11.909> really<00:01:12.330> inspire<00:01:12.840> fear<00:01:13.140> in<00:01:13.170> his

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
play and really inspire fear in his

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:14.600 
play and really inspire fear in his
opponents

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
opponents

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:16.700 
opponents
I<00:01:14.640> think<00:01:15.000> Polamalu<00:01:15.479> was<00:01:15.689> that<00:01:15.900> guy<00:01:16.080> many<00:01:16.500> you

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
I think Polamalu was that guy many you

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.590 
I think Polamalu was that guy many you
know<00:01:16.830> as<00:01:16.920> many<00:01:17.070> sacks<00:01:17.460> as<00:01:17.640> Harrison's<00:01:18.090> created

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
know as many sacks as Harrison's created

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.719 
know as many sacks as Harrison's created
I<00:01:18.720> think<00:01:19.140> Polamalu<00:01:19.560> would<00:01:19.740> be<00:01:19.860> hitting<00:01:20.070> pass

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
I think Polamalu would be hitting pass

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.700 
I think Polamalu would be hitting pass
rushing<00:01:21.180> the<00:01:21.270> interceptions<00:01:21.930> forced<00:01:22.350> fumbles

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
rushing the interceptions forced fumbles

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.170 
rushing the interceptions forced fumbles
it's<00:01:22.860> all<00:01:23.009> there<00:01:23.220> yeah<00:01:23.640> I<00:01:23.700> think<00:01:23.820> that's<00:01:24.090> what

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
it's all there yeah I think that's what

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.520 
it's all there yeah I think that's what

did it for me you still I thought of

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
did it for me you still I thought of
that<00:01:25.619> Harrison<00:01:26.040> play<00:01:26.220> but<00:01:26.400> we<00:01:26.490> just<00:01:26.670> gave<00:01:26.790> it

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
that Harrison play but we just gave it

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:28.580 
that Harrison play but we just gave it
to<00:01:27.030> him<00:01:27.180> for<00:01:27.360> clutch<00:01:27.630> yeah<00:01:27.900> well<00:01:28.110> Polamalu

to him for clutch yeah well Polamalu
there's<00:01:28.770> been<00:01:28.920> so<00:01:29.159> many<00:01:29.280> times<00:01:29.369> and<00:01:29.759> like<00:01:29.820> you

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
there's been so many times and like you

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.090 
there's been so many times and like you
said<00:01:30.090> in<00:01:30.210> so<00:01:30.479> many<00:01:30.540> different<00:01:31.140> ways<00:01:31.380> that<00:01:31.770> he

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
said in so many different ways that he

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.280 
said in so many different ways that he
can<00:01:32.250> do<00:01:32.400> it<00:01:32.430> he<00:01:32.850> gets<00:01:33.060> the<00:01:33.210> mark<00:01:33.450> next<00:01:33.930> up<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
can do it he gets the mark next up is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.960 
can do it he gets the mark next up is
strategy<00:01:34.770> and<00:01:34.950> game<00:01:35.189> planning<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.670> how<00:01:35.759> much

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
strategy and game planning and how much

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
strategy and game planning and how much
a<00:01:36.000> team<00:01:36.299> has<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.750> worry<00:01:37.229> about<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.710> other<00:01:37.740> guy

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
a team has to worry about the other guy

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.130 
a team has to worry about the other guy
in<00:01:38.220> coming<00:01:38.610> up<00:01:38.700> with<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.970> game<00:01:39.210> plan<00:01:39.420> we<00:01:39.990> gave

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
in coming up with that game plan we gave

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.600 
in coming up with that game plan we gave
it<00:01:40.259> to<00:01:40.290> Harrison<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.829> think<00:01:41.070> of<00:01:41.159> the<00:01:41.220> fact<00:01:41.430> that

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
it to Harrison I think of the fact that

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:43.850 
it to Harrison I think of the fact that
every<00:01:42.150> type<00:01:42.360> of<00:01:42.390> blocking<00:01:43.380> scheme<00:01:43.649> and

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
every type of blocking scheme and

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.740 
every type of blocking scheme and
protection<00:01:44.340> on<00:01:44.430> every<00:01:44.579> play<00:01:44.909> really<00:01:45.149> you<00:01:45.540> have

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
protection on every play really you have

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:46.999 
protection on every play really you have
to<00:01:45.899> account<00:01:46.170> for<00:01:46.290> where<00:01:46.530> he's<00:01:46.680> coming<00:01:46.890> from

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
to account for where he's coming from

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
to account for where he's coming from
you<00:01:47.310> know<00:01:47.399> even<00:01:47.759> with<00:01:47.820> Lamar<00:01:48.119> Woodley<00:01:48.390> on<00:01:48.600> the

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
you know even with Lamar Woodley on the

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.660 
you know even with Lamar Woodley on the
other<00:01:48.899> side<00:01:49.200> you<00:01:49.409> almost<00:01:49.680> never<00:01:49.950> see<00:01:50.250> him<00:01:50.460> get

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
other side you almost never see him get

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:52.370 
other side you almost never see him get
single<00:01:51.060> block<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.689> left<00:01:51.899> tackle<00:01:52.140> or

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
single block just a left tackle or

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:53.690 
single block just a left tackle or
anything<00:01:52.530> like<00:01:52.770> that<00:01:52.829> you<00:01:53.100> certainly<00:01:53.340> don't

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
anything like that you certainly don't

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.460 
anything like that you certainly don't
leave<00:01:53.880> until<00:01:54.030> running<00:01:54.479> back<00:01:54.600> or<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> tiny<00:01:55.049> into

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
leave until running back or a tiny into

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.200 
leave until running back or a tiny into
it<00:01:55.590> yeah<00:01:55.860> you<00:01:55.920> either<00:01:56.159> slide<00:01:56.549> protection<00:01:56.790> or

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
it yeah you either slide protection or

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:58.999 
it yeah you either slide protection or
you<00:01:57.270> use<00:01:57.390> double<00:01:57.750> double<00:01:58.350> blocking<00:01:58.740> on<00:01:58.860> those

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
you use double double blocking on those

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.130 
you use double double blocking on those
guy<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.369> that<00:01:59.549> guy<00:01:59.700> so<00:02:00.030> even<00:02:00.509> though<00:02:00.630> Polamalu

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
guy on that guy so even though Polamalu

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.240 
guy on that guy so even though Polamalu
lining<00:02:01.560> up<00:02:01.680> all<00:02:01.829> over

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
lining up all over

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.010 
lining up all over
I<00:02:02.280> still<00:02:02.729> think<00:02:02.850> Harrison<00:02:03.299> gets<00:02:03.479> the<00:02:03.630> edge<00:02:03.750> our

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
I still think Harrison gets the edge our

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.560 
I still think Harrison gets the edge our
final<00:02:04.469> category<00:02:04.680> is<00:02:05.009> the<00:02:05.310> nasty<00:02:05.850> factor<00:02:06.299> okay

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
final category is the nasty factor okay

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:08.600 
final category is the nasty factor okay
and<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.140> could<00:02:07.350> argue<00:02:07.500> even<00:02:07.770> Palmolive<00:02:08.429> being

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
and you could argue even Palmolive being

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:09.960 
and you could argue even Palmolive being
soft-spoken

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:09.970 
soft-spoken

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.150 
soft-spoken
these<00:02:10.240> guys<00:02:10.479> are<00:02:10.690> super<00:02:11.140> nasty<00:02:11.830> I<00:02:11.860> think

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.160 
these guys are super nasty I think

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.710 
these guys are super nasty I think
Harrison<00:02:12.550> just<00:02:12.760> gets<00:02:12.940> the<00:02:13.120> slightest<00:02:13.540> edge

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:13.720 
Harrison just gets the slightest edge

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:15.480 
Harrison just gets the slightest edge
he's<00:02:13.960> pretty<00:02:14.170> big<00:02:14.350> I<00:02:14.590> feel<00:02:14.830> like<00:02:14.950> the<00:02:15.100> nasty

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
he's pretty big I feel like the nasty

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:16.650 
he's pretty big I feel like the nasty
factor<00:02:15.820> she<00:02:15.970> could<00:02:16.090> just<00:02:16.240> be<00:02:16.360> called<00:02:16.570> the

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
factor she could just be called the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.210 
factor she could just be called the
Harrison<00:02:17.140> factor<00:02:17.530> because<00:02:17.770> that's<00:02:17.950> what<00:02:18.100> it

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
Harrison factor because that's what it

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.980 
Harrison factor because that's what it
is<00:02:18.340> I<00:02:18.370> mean<00:02:18.520> he<00:02:19.090> scares<00:02:19.480> me<00:02:19.570> through<00:02:19.930> a

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
is I mean he scares me through a

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:21.780 
is I mean he scares me through a
television<00:02:20.590> you<00:02:20.860> know<00:02:20.920> just<00:02:21.220> watching<00:02:21.640> him

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:21.790 
television you know just watching him

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.430 
television you know just watching him
hearing<00:02:22.330> him<00:02:22.480> talk<00:02:22.510> watching<00:02:23.260> him<00:02:23.350> play

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
hearing him talk watching him play

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.320 
hearing him talk watching him play
whatever<00:02:23.650> it<00:02:23.860> does<00:02:24.070> he<00:02:24.490> frightens<00:02:24.940> me<00:02:25.000> so<00:02:25.300> I

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
whatever it does he frightens me so I

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:27.060 
whatever it does he frightens me so I
think<00:02:25.480> that<00:02:25.990> being<00:02:26.260> the<00:02:26.320> deciding<00:02:26.740> factor<00:02:27.040> in

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.070 
think that being the deciding factor in

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:28.980 
think that being the deciding factor in
this<00:02:27.160> category<00:02:27.670> really<00:02:28.000> sets<00:02:28.360> up<00:02:28.480> perfect<00:02:28.870> for
