00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:20.860 
kind of things going on and it was like

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.480 
kind of things going on and it was like
really<00:02:21.069> sleek<00:02:21.580> and<00:02:21.910> shiny<00:02:22.390> and

really sleek and shiny and

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.270 
really sleek and shiny and
just<00:02:24.210> like<00:02:24.360> clumps<00:02:25.350> a<00:02:25.560> little<00:02:27.350> and<00:02:28.350> the<00:02:29.130> thing

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.250 
the worst thing I think was that it was
so<00:02:31.590> black<00:02:31.980> that<00:02:32.310> it<00:02:32.820> really<00:02:33.060> like<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:33.780> the

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
so black that it really like the the

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.410 
so black that it really like the the
contrast<00:02:34.710> between<00:02:34.770> his<00:02:35.250> white<00:02:35.520> pale<00:02:35.850> face<00:02:36.180> and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
contrast between his white pale face and

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.480 
contrast between his white pale face and
the<00:02:36.870> black<00:02:37.080> hair<00:02:37.350> was<00:02:37.530> with<00:02:37.800> not<00:02:38.040> natural

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:38.490
