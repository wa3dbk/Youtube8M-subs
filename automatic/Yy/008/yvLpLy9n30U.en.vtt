00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:03.710
 university chair 

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.860
 welcome to university life 

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.860
 welcome university 

00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:13.769
 who are university 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:18.410
 let us respond with the words of Professor Alfonso with costs 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:24.369
 the university to be a university student requires the exercise of which a 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.630
 value to the thinking function 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.380
 thinking of yourself 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.479
 think about society 

00:00:30.479 --> 00:00:33.479
 and think about the world 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.800
 for the university the only possible mandate is that of reason 

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.900
 and she is not absolute or eternal 

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.300
 that process 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.440
 only hacker should be excluded 

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.630
 who wants to be absent 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.050
 it will not be up to political mikami 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:56.070
 and the process must be perfected 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.270
 with the practical consequence of reason under construction 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.830
 the university demands to be able to exist in such quality the independence 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.840
 for analysis and democracy for the consequent application that is to say claims 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.230
 although or payroll 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:22.370
 the university student has been free and autonomous when choosing the career 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:24.740
 who is studying 

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:30.320
 and must continue exercising that freedom and autonomy until reaching his title and 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.440
 even more 

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.390
 after reaching 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.390
 in the exercise of his profession 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.909
 freedom is the right to do everything the laws allow 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.130
 and autonomy as aburto collective determination 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:52.020
 as the ability to act without being determined more than by oneself 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.100
 is the poor gum to the law that one has prescribed 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.060
 freedom is the right to do 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.720
 what the laws allowed 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.660
 autonomy is the ability to opt for those norms and values 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:14.009
 that the human being considers as valid 

00:02:14.009 --> 00:02:18.909
 freedom is obedience to the law that one has prescribed
