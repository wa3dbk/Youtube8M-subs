00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:50.890 
rubber now compared to the t90 threes

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:52.230 
rubber now compared to the t90 threes
where<00:02:51.130> it<00:02:51.190> was<00:02:51.280> a<00:02:51.340> softer<00:02:51.730> rubber<00:02:51.850> where<00:02:52.120> they

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:52.240 
where it was a softer rubber where they

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.230 
where it was a softer rubber where they
could<00:02:52.390> rip<00:02:52.630> and<00:02:52.870> they're<00:02:53.350> they're<00:02:53.590> big<00:02:53.830> or<00:02:53.950> too

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
could rip and they're they're big or too

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:56.730 
could rip and they're they're big or too
this<00:02:55.240> is<00:02:55.390> more<00:02:55.600> of<00:02:55.630> a<00:02:55.720> concentrated<00:02:56.350> so<00:02:56.590> this

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:56.740 
this is more of a concentrated so this

00:02:56.740 --> 00:02:58.710 
this is more of a concentrated so this
is<00:02:56.890> basically<00:02:57.220> if<00:02:58.060> you're<00:02:58.210> curling<00:02:58.570> the<00:02:58.690> ball

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
is basically if you're curling the ball

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.680 
is basically if you're curling the ball
t<00:02:59.110> they're<00:02:59.230> going<00:02:59.350> to<00:02:59.410> be<00:02:59.470> like<00:02:59.590> this<00:02:59.800> area

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
t they're going to be like this area

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.450 
t they're going to be like this area
this<00:03:01.690> area<00:03:01.930> of<00:03:02.170> the<00:03:02.290> boo<00:03:02.440> where<00:03:02.680> the<00:03:02.980> fins<00:03:03.250> are

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:03.460 
this area of the boo where the fins are

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:07.680 
this area of the boo where the fins are
so<00:03:04.650> are<00:03:05.650> like<00:03:06.160> well<00:03:06.520> maybe<00:03:06.760> back<00:03:07.060> here<00:03:07.300> still

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:07.690 
so are like well maybe back here still

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.470 
so are like well maybe back here still
but<00:03:07.900> like<00:03:08.020> you<00:03:08.980> get<00:03:09.160> this<00:03:09.340> party<00:03:09.580> how<00:03:09.820> bad<00:03:10.060> spin

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:10.480 
but like you get this party how bad spin

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:13.260 
but like you get this party how bad spin
and<00:03:10.720> stuff<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.590> one<00:03:11.800> is<00:03:11.920> a<00:03:11.950> shot<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.940> rubber

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.270 
and stuff this one is a shot this rubber

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:15.420 
and stuff this one is a shot this rubber
is<00:03:13.480> way<00:03:13.630> harder<00:03:14.080> to<00:03:14.290> this<00:03:14.980> is<00:03:15.100> like<00:03:15.220> hard

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
is way harder to this is like hard

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.700 
is way harder to this is like hard
rubber<00:03:15.850> not<00:03:16.720> like<00:03:16.870> hard<00:03:17.110> but<00:03:17.320> like<00:03:17.470> it's

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:17.710 
rubber not like hard but like it's

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:20.550 
rubber not like hard but like it's
stiffer<00:03:18.160> so<00:03:18.760> it's<00:03:18.880> more<00:03:19.060> like<00:03:19.210> a<00:03:19.240> bounce<00:03:19.600> thing

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:20.560 
stiffer so it's more like a bounce thing

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.340 
stiffer so it's more like a bounce thing
when<00:03:20.770> you<00:03:20.890> shoot<00:03:21.210> it<00:03:22.210> just<00:03:22.540> bounces<00:03:22.900> off<00:03:23.140> them

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
when you shoot it just bounces off them

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:25.980 
when you shoot it just bounces off them
but<00:03:24.220> even<00:03:24.370> shooting<00:03:24.850> on<00:03:25.000> the<00:03:25.210> upper<00:03:25.540> here<00:03:25.870> it

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:25.990 
but even shooting on the upper here it

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:27.720 
but even shooting on the upper here it
feels<00:03:26.140> just<00:03:26.320> sick<00:03:26.950> because<00:03:27.160> it's<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.520> so

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:27.730 
feels just sick because it's like so

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.580 
feels just sick because it's like so
soft<00:03:28.030> and<00:03:28.780> you<00:03:28.870> can<00:03:29.020> still<00:03:29.200> feel<00:03:29.410> like<00:03:29.440> there's

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
soft and you can still feel like there's

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.320 
soft and you can still feel like there's
a<00:03:29.830> like<00:03:30.010> I<00:03:30.040> don't<00:03:30.670> if<00:03:30.820> there's<00:03:30.940> like<00:03:31.060> a<00:03:31.120> layer

traction things I don't know why it on
the<00:04:39.330> back<00:04:39.539> but<00:04:40.320> there<00:04:40.530> at<00:04:41.220> the<00:04:41.460> front<00:04:41.639> too<00:04:42.620> they

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
the back but there at the front too they

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.439 
the back but there at the front too they
said<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:43.949> thick<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:44.520> for<00:04:45.090> toe<00:04:45.270> off
