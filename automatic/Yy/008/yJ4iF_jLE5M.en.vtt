00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.170

00:00:12.829 --> 00:00:18.140
 Hi Aleks first aid making music de the company Puma Apex gave us two snares 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.720
 Two sends their new Black Panther its first one 90 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.359
 which zones and is for ten couple five Como 5 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:27.499
 should et 

00:00:27.499 --> 00:00:31.829
 the other is 13 times five grief 5 and imagine the one has one 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:36.800
 Mix of maple and wool has clearly Becker than this six layer 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 So Jerry is cherry wood made closer 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.620
 Sins little different percent of the salmon he the one kind 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:46.590
 to save German the other so-called 2 placks 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.150
 both have one we worked for 

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:53.590
 Glatzer us yours is always so after the anger principle work lift off 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:57.320
 and that's how it sounds 

00:02:22.889 --> 00:02:25.409
 so you can see the new two leaves 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:30.439
 while Ellers from Mark Beck's Valve gates and Jicha stirred bomb 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:36.629
 Who should convincingly totally convincing the instruments with their character 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.499
 You rarely find that the instruments are for you either 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:44.749
 Stinging character and making the ear when you believe that all 13 aces 

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:48.230
 he automatically flatly sounds with a thin kettle that a 40 that he is using 

00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.709
 thick KÃ¶ssel that is once again belied lies I find this more 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:55.849
 really a lot of belly made us sound very voluminous though 7 inches smaller 

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:56.639
 is 

00:02:56.639 --> 00:02:58.109
 and always is 

00:02:58.109 --> 00:03:02.389
 around and this more and even if you vote high now, the MS nonetheless 

00:03:02.389 --> 00:03:05.589
 Make me and the lower tuned and upright and the characters 

00:03:05.589 --> 00:03:07.379
 have yet to work out 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.689
 both do not have such annoying overtones they are very pleasing to the ear off and on 

00:03:11.689 --> 00:03:15.749
 I have an insane dynamic percent I find all the stuff works 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.359
 fantastic 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:21.449
 This is certainly due to the fact that they are very well integrated with their customers 

00:03:22.619 --> 00:03:25.749
 I really like that because the fabric wear is really obvious 

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:29.039
 is reduced and obviously that takes really overtones 

00:03:30.149 --> 00:03:31.459
 DEK 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.799
 again to sea in two different moods 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:36.869
 and I saw goodbye to music
