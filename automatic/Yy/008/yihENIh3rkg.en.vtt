or<00:00:16.770> two

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:17.250 
or two

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.279 
or two
the<00:00:17.789> problem<00:00:18.150> with<00:00:18.300> charms<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:19.050> they

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
the problem with charms is they

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:22.759 
the problem with charms is they
typically<00:00:19.859> don't<00:00:21.199> perfectly<00:00:22.199> fit<00:00:22.439> the<00:00:22.590> nail

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
typically don't perfectly fit the nail

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.429 
typically don't perfectly fit the nail
but<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.939> big<00:00:24.150> gaudy<00:00:24.449> look<00:00:24.869> is<00:00:25.050> what's<00:00:25.260> in

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
but the big gaudy look is what's in

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.830 
but the big gaudy look is what's in
style<00:00:25.820> so<00:00:26.820> if<00:00:27.689> you<00:00:28.320> you<00:00:29.189> say<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.880> topcoat<00:00:30.240> to

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
style so if you you say a topcoat to

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
style so if you you say a topcoat to
apply<00:00:31.170> your<00:00:31.410> rhinestones<00:00:31.980> you<00:00:32.219> certainly<00:00:32.579> do

nails<00:00:41.280> been<00:00:41.579> polished<00:00:42.059> I've<00:00:42.600> done<00:00:42.840> two<00:00:43.110> coats

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
nails been polished I've done two coats

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.319 
nails been polished I've done two coats
of<00:00:43.530> color<00:00:43.710> I've<00:00:44.040> done<00:00:44.370> my<00:00:44.520> top<00:00:44.760> coat<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.149> it's

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
of color I've done my top coat and it's

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.930 
of color I've done my top coat and it's
already<00:00:45.660> dry<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.649> easier<00:00:47.129> if<00:00:47.280> you<00:00:47.430> wait<00:00:47.700> for

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
already dry it's easier if you wait for

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.930 
already dry it's easier if you wait for
it<00:00:48.030> to<00:00:48.090> be<00:00:48.270> dry<00:00:48.539> so<00:00:49.260> that<00:00:49.469> when<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.370> apply<00:00:50.820> the

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
it to be dry so that when we apply the

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.410 
it to be dry so that when we apply the
the<00:00:51.719> actual<00:00:52.050> charm<00:00:52.920> to<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> nail<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.760> adheres

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
the actual charm to the nail it adheres

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.360 
the actual charm to the nail it adheres
better<00:00:54.480> to<00:00:54.899> the<00:00:54.989> polish<00:00:55.379> because<00:00:55.710> it's<00:00:55.980> cured

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
better to the polish because it's cured

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.540 
better to the polish because it's cured
so<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.750> this<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.199> going<00:00:58.260> to<00:00:58.620> use<00:00:58.710> just<00:00:59.340> a

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
so to do this I'm going to use just a

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.360 
so to do this I'm going to use just a
brush<00:00:59.820> on<00:01:00.000> resum<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:00.780> I'm<00:01:01.649> going<00:01:02.010> to<00:01:02.160> apply

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
brush on resum and I'm going to apply

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.910 
brush on resum and I'm going to apply
the<00:01:02.489> resin<00:01:02.760> where<00:01:03.059> I<00:01:03.090> already<00:01:03.570> know<00:01:03.780> I<00:01:04.110> want<00:01:04.559> to

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920 
the resin where I already know I want to

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:06.469 
the resin where I already know I want to
put<00:01:05.129> that<00:01:05.700> charm

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
put that charm

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.480 
put that charm
I'm<00:01:07.110> going<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.350> apply<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.560> little<00:01:07.920> generous

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
I'm going to apply a little generous

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.000 
I'm going to apply a little generous
amount<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.119> then<00:01:09.900> I'm<00:01:09.990> gonna<00:01:10.110> place<00:01:10.380> the

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
amount and then I'm gonna place the

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.370 
amount and then I'm gonna place the
charm<00:01:11.369> where<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:11.790> want<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.210> and<00:01:12.330> hold<00:01:13.080> it<00:01:13.229> until

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
it just sticks in place now the key to

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.890 
it just sticks in place now the key to
making<00:01:16.530> this<00:01:17.060> absolutely<00:01:18.060> stay<00:01:18.420> for<00:01:18.720> long

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
making this absolutely stay for long

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.249 
making this absolutely stay for long
term<00:01:19.200> wear<00:01:19.500> is<00:01:20.090> going<00:01:21.090> back<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.570> using<00:01:21.810> brush

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
term wear is going back and using brush

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.140 
term wear is going back and using brush
on<00:01:22.500> resin<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.930> basically<00:01:24.930> just<00:01:25.920> apply<00:01:26.549> resin

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
on resin to basically just apply resin

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.980 
on resin to basically just apply resin
around<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:27.780> edges<00:01:28.229> and<00:01:29.119> load<00:01:30.119> underneath

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
around the edges and load underneath

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.700 
around the edges and load underneath
with<00:01:31.680> as<00:01:31.829> much<00:01:32.040> resin<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.640> possible

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
with as much resin as possible

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.679 
with as much resin as possible
while<00:01:34.710> you're<00:01:34.950> doing<00:01:35.310> this<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.119> resin<00:01:36.570> will

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
while you're doing this the resin will

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:39.380 
while you're doing this the resin will
take<00:01:36.900> longer<00:01:37.200> to<00:01:37.439> dry<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.549> it's<00:01:38.790> a<00:01:38.909> great<00:01:39.180> idea

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
take longer to dry so it's a great idea

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.170 
take longer to dry so it's a great idea
to<00:01:39.930> use<00:01:39.960> something<00:01:40.560> like<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:41.070> gel<00:01:41.520> cure<00:01:41.790> spray

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
to use something like a gel cure spray

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.980 
to use something like a gel cure spray
to<00:01:42.869> come<00:01:43.110> in<00:01:43.439> and<00:01:43.850> spray<00:01:44.850> the<00:01:45.060> resin<00:01:45.479> to<00:01:45.780> help

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
to come in and spray the resin to help

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:48.649 
to come in and spray the resin to help
speed<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.409> along<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.860> help<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.189> dry<00:01:47.479> you<00:01:48.479> want

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
speed it along and help it dry you want

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.929 
speed it along and help it dry you want
to<00:01:48.780> do<00:01:48.899> several<00:01:49.229> coats<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.740> this<00:01:49.920> keep<00:01:50.520> adding

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
to do several coats of this keep adding

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.760 
to do several coats of this keep adding
resin<00:01:51.390> keep<00:01:51.930> spraying<00:01:52.259> it<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:52.770 
resin keep spraying it with the

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.550 
resin keep spraying it with the
activator<00:01:53.340> and<00:01:53.869> once<00:01:54.869> you've<00:01:55.049> got<00:01:55.259> enough

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
activator and once you've got enough

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.600 
activator and once you've got enough
underneath<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.700> charm<00:01:57.149> will<00:01:57.780> stay<00:01:58.259> for<00:01:59.130> days

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
underneath that charm will stay for days

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:01.910 
underneath that charm will stay for days
it<00:02:00.030> will<00:02:00.240> be<00:02:00.390> actually<00:02:00.840> difficult<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.560> remove

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
it will be actually difficult to remove

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.450 
it will be actually difficult to remove
one<00:02:02.790> last<00:02:03.090> final<00:02:03.390> tip<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:05.009> top<00:02:05.430> coat

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
one last final tip don't put top coat

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.300 
one last final tip don't put top coat
over<00:02:05.909> your<00:02:06.329> charms<00:02:06.899> when<00:02:07.560> you<00:02:07.649> apply<00:02:07.920> top<00:02:08.280> coat

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
