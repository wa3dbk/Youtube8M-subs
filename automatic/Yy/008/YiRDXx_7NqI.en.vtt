ghosts limbo slim mows down uh I think
we<00:04:01.970> put<00:04:02.150> an<00:04:02.239> Einstein<00:04:02.660> at<00:04:02.780> this<00:04:02.930> point<00:04:03.200> I

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:03.700 
we put an Einstein at this point I

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.120 
we put an Einstein at this point I
thought<00:04:04.700> however<00:04:05.000> is<00:04:05.570> just<00:04:05.870> not<00:04:06.620> good<00:04:07.010> in

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:07.130 
thought however is just not good in

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:09.849 
thought however is just not good in
these<00:04:07.250> situations<00:04:08.350> look<00:04:09.350> how<00:04:09.470> much<00:04:09.650> damage

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
these situations look how much damage

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:11.560 
these situations look how much damage
that<00:04:10.160> does<00:04:10.340> even<00:04:10.730> to<00:04:10.850> a<00:04:10.880> role<00:04:11.120> to<00:04:11.269> I<00:04:11.359> mean<00:04:11.480> I

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:11.570 
that does even to a role to I mean I

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:16.680 
that does even to a role to I mean I
guess<00:04:11.600> it<00:04:11.870> has<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:11.989> bulk<00:04:12.320> up<00:04:12.530> on<00:04:13.489> it<00:04:13.910> so

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:16.690 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.030 

confusion<00:04:17.690> I<00:04:17.900> don't<00:04:18.169> even<00:04:18.289> heal

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
confusion I don't even heal

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.190 
confusion I don't even heal
because<00:04:20.030> I<00:04:20.060> really<00:04:20.420> don't<00:04:20.600> care<00:04:20.660> cuz<00:04:21.050> I<00:04:21.140> know

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:21.200 
because I really don't care cuz I know

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:24.820 
because I really don't care cuz I know
Einstein<00:04:21.440> won't<00:04:21.920> do<00:04:22.010> very<00:04:22.220> much<00:04:23.560> and<00:04:24.560> I<00:04:24.680> get

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:24.830 
Einstein won't do very much and I get

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:26.800 
Einstein won't do very much and I get
some<00:04:24.980> nice<00:04:25.130> confusion<00:04:25.700> hacks<00:04:25.910> unfortunately

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:26.810 
some nice confusion hacks unfortunately

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:33.220 
some nice confusion hacks unfortunately
though<00:04:26.960> it<00:04:27.170> doesn't<00:04:27.410> matter<00:04:27.800> too<00:04:28.640> much<00:04:32.230> so

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:33.230 
though it doesn't matter too much so

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:35.530 
though it doesn't matter too much so
grotal<00:04:33.740> my<00:04:34.130> last<00:04:34.370> hope<00:04:34.610> unless<00:04:35.030> I<00:04:35.150> really<00:04:35.270> want

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
grotal my last hope unless I really want

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:41.260 
grotal my last hope unless I really want
to<00:04:35.570> use<00:04:35.840> fury<00:04:36.140> which<00:04:36.530> I<00:04:36.680> really<00:04:36.920> don't<00:04:37.160> and<00:04:40.270> in

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:41.270 
to use fury which I really don't and in

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.470 
to use fury which I really don't and in
this<00:04:41.420> chair<00:04:41.810> though<00:04:42.260> it's<00:04:43.040> kidding<00:04:43.480> brutal

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
this chair though it's kidding brutal

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.810 
this chair though it's kidding brutal
takes<00:04:44.690> these<00:04:44.840> hits<00:04:45.110> pretty<00:04:45.320> well<00:04:45.560> I<00:04:45.590> think

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:45.820 
takes these hits pretty well I think

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.970 
takes these hits pretty well I think
take<00:04:46.820> some<00:04:47.000> better<00:04:47.150> than<00:04:47.330> wrelton<00:04:47.780> Rawls's<00:04:48.200> or

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:48.980 
take some better than wrelton Rawls's or

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.430 
take some better than wrelton Rawls's or
else<00:04:49.100> takes<00:04:49.400> half<00:04:49.550> damage<00:04:49.820> from<00:04:50.090> them<00:04:50.240> and<00:04:50.440> now

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
else takes half damage from them and now

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:54.210 
else takes half damage from them and now
I<00:04:51.470> got<00:04:51.920> the<00:04:52.100> beautiful<00:04:52.880> idea<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.540> curse<00:04:53.810> up

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
I got the beautiful idea to curse up

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:57.000 
I got the beautiful idea to curse up
which<00:04:55.220> is<00:04:55.370> basically<00:04:55.670> like<00:04:55.940> my<00:04:56.330> own<00:04:56.480> bulk<00:04:56.780> up

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:57.010 
which is basically like my own bulk up

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:01.060 
which is basically like my own bulk up
so<00:04:58.010> I<00:04:58.070> can<00:04:58.280> curse<00:04:58.550> up<00:04:58.850> and<00:04:59.350> raise<00:05:00.350> my<00:05:00.560> attack<00:05:00.890> to

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
so I can curse up and raise my attack to

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.370 
so I can curse up and raise my attack to
make<00:05:01.220> my<00:05:01.370> tackles<00:05:01.790> do<00:05:01.910> more<00:05:02.120> and<00:05:02.390> lessen<00:05:03.230> the

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
make my tackles do more and lessen the

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:06.190 
make my tackles do more and lessen the
effects<00:05:03.920> of<00:05:03.950> those<00:05:04.100> karate<00:05:04.430> chops<00:05:04.990> which<00:05:05.990> is

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:06.200 
effects of those karate chops which is

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:08.380
