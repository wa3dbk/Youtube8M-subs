watching one video to the next one
coming<00:01:58.290> out<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.560> I<00:01:58.590> thought<00:01:58.799> that<00:01:58.920> would<00:01:59.009> be

coming out so I thought that would be
great<00:01:59.219> to<00:01:59.700> give<00:01:59.820> you<00:01:59.880> time<00:02:00.090> to<00:02:00.360> maybe<00:02:00.990> get<00:02:01.259> up
