00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 a moment as possible of the head you 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 you have to external because last year 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:10.010
 crisponi no and this year dwight howard 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:10.010
 yes, after somebody came in better 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:23.580
 if therefore anyway a cost 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.789
 there is a fundamental problem apart 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.800
 of economic partners to hold up but 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.990
 very correct from the formal point of view 

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:34.440
 but does not take into account that they are staying there 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:39.150
 to feel mine is something unheard of 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:41.190
 at all latitudes student supported 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:43.410
 from us when the shoulder hurts you give 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.070
 the legendary Sians to the mayor who 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.920
 fucking situation has always given e 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.440
 team inside seconds what the fuck 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.890
 there is one thing here but in the pocket of 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:01:00.089
 castle for those who are away the keys to 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.090
 hit gandosso letter I tell you 

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:08.490
 now all 29 October because the stake 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.259
 that deductible affects the value 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.189
 of our league 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.680
 and since we are a league we must keep 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:19.320
 graduated home because we will sell this 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.979
 new team that is exactly that 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:26.700
 what happened is only the new ones 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:29.970
 owners who roped two if not 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:33.390
 he knew who the air was perfectly no 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 so when he was before the choice of 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.600
 assemble them as chosen the players of the 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:38.789
 franchise 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.390
 the first thing because the exchange 

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:46.319
 saffron with christ that I can go to 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:50.080
 inside even the bad no me and him not 

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:54.330
 we can't do this 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:57.400
 call potential buyers and those who ask 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.010
 fiom has struggled in the sense that 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.620
 too many high-level offers arrive 

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.050
 I would never want that the 

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:07.060
 franchise player during the period 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.800
 in the col with for companies also with 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.149
 heat pumps playing with 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.240
 within the means it would be better 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:16.390
 I do but there are no tense nerves is that 

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:19.060
 however they didn't have any problems and so there is 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.780
 a trend line always editing 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.390
 evident this disease by flying now 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:30.130
 the line you would know how to help yourself 

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:32.590
 begins with the knowledge of the consul 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.910
 for facts already made large contracts a 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:35.860
 deadline 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.980
 those that would have been the potentials 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:41.830
 buyer that is two thousand no capacity 

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:45.150
 important for over thirtysomething as a schoolgirl 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:47.209
 from 10 we pass what we do 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.769
 we enter our team maybe 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.599
 but I was borderline but not things 

00:02:49.769 --> 00:02:53.879
 we have margin because with important there 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.599
 kill we all wipe out 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:03:00.500
 cited contrary deadlines chosen 

00:02:56.599 --> 00:03:05.000
 player deductible starting this 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.000
 richard excuse do not exist 

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.650
 exactly what we had to do 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:12.890
 mouth with work I make the touch of the 

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:15.190
 mold value to take up the 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:18.409
 sea ​​storm as rightly technical datum 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:21.290
 in the entrepreneurial dentinho country 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.299
 he concludes an exchange and you of 

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:26.180
 screw shore however formally the 

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:28.849
 generally people have come to an agreement 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:33.400
 I take gentlemen players and he and with 

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:35.989
 they not only are there even with in hydrology 

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.790
 present or someone in the sun 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.819
 cut the owners of and is not 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.530
 hard to imagine of truth 

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:47.110
 no this is perfect 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:49.810
 the sun is not the lakers so it is 

00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:52.330
 dead we had so many 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:55.000
 enthusiasts that there are four but 

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:58.390
 they can really play two like that 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.459
 or if they keep it as a christ that combines 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.130
 Rome must reawaken this summer the 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:05.200
 answer and added that if because that 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:06.040
 one way has his companions 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.410
 rattle 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:11.380
 but suddenly it is no longer so if yes 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:13.600
 let the reflection of Saint Hilary be created 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:18.430
 the various owners are cold and ten are 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:21.640
 the outside deserve this with him that 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:23.890
 hear owners say no is 

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:27.480
 try too hard to try this deal 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:27.480
 puts all this together 

00:04:28.969 --> 00:04:34.429
 first the stage one of the concepts 

00:04:30.799 --> 00:04:37.299
 fundamentals of their system it has for 

00:04:34.429 --> 00:04:41.419
 do it you took every kind of insult 

00:04:37.299 --> 00:04:43.399
 written on paper and on a fine word 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:44.809
 on the whole he doing the masterpiece 

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:50.379
 which is the last thing that makes pendant 

00:04:44.809 --> 00:04:50.379
 free after that if I go from well decline 

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.220
 to 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.360
 4 15 years away from john to 98 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.160
 when the world is given by a point of 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.669
 view of communication from another 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.830
 part 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.129
 you want to see that I almost make you 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.709
 if anything it continues 

00:05:07.129 --> 00:05:14.559
 I'll make you stop this country for the 

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:14.559
 my delegation as a game 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.480
 so much second from there
