00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
steer it I know what that word was

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:43.040 
steer it I know what that word was
stager<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.280> on<00:00:41.670> that<00:00:42.030> right<00:00:42.450> folks<00:00:42.660> all<00:00:42.840> we<00:00:42.930> do

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
stager up on that right folks all we do

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.049 
stager up on that right folks all we do
is<00:00:43.170> start<00:00:43.410> off<00:00:43.620> this<00:00:44.040> is<00:00:44.100> one<00:00:44.489> egg<00:00:44.730> white

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
is start off this is one egg white

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.150 
is start off this is one egg white
pretty<00:00:45.570> much<00:00:45.780> the<00:00:45.960> minimum<00:00:46.320> amount<00:00:46.590> of<00:00:46.800> egg<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:47.160 
pretty much the minimum amount of egg I

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.560 
pretty much the minimum amount of egg I
could<00:00:47.399> get<00:00:47.610> although<00:00:47.879> that<00:00:48.210> you<00:00:48.329> could<00:00:48.450> get

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
could get although that you could get

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.029 
could get although that you could get
these<00:00:48.660> cartons<00:00:49.020> you<00:00:49.170> know<00:00:49.289> these<00:00:49.440> but<00:00:49.710> cartons

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
these cartons you know these but cartons

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.319 
these cartons you know these but cartons
of<00:00:50.070> egg<00:00:50.219> white<00:00:50.399> I<00:00:50.430> probably<00:00:50.730> reduce<00:00:51.059> that<00:00:51.180> by

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
of egg white I probably reduce that by

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.209 
of egg white I probably reduce that by
half<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.960> one<00:00:52.140> egg<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.440> simpler<00:00:52.800> what<00:00:53.129> I'm

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
half but one egg was simpler what I'm

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.100 
half but one egg was simpler what I'm
gonna<00:00:53.309> do<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.520> whisk<00:00:53.760> it<00:00:53.969> up<00:00:54.059> might<00:00:54.899> take<00:00:55.079> a

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
gonna do is whisk it up might take a

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.049 
gonna do is whisk it up might take a
little<00:00:55.230> while<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.739> use<00:00:56.370> Electric<00:00:56.730> whispering

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
little while to use Electric whispering

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.389 
little while to use Electric whispering
oh<00:00:57.239> my<00:00:57.989> gosh<00:00:58.320> I've<00:00:58.530> got<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.800> say<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> electric

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399 
oh my gosh I've got to say the electric

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:00.439 
oh my gosh I've got to say the electric
whisk<00:00:59.579> would<00:00:59.820> definitely<00:01:00.239> have<00:01:00.329> been<00:01:00.420> a

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
whisk would definitely have been a

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.420 
whisk would definitely have been a
better<00:01:00.660> choice<00:01:00.899> but<00:01:01.230> my<00:01:01.379> arm<00:01:01.559> or<00:01:01.859> a<00:01:01.920> feel<00:01:02.399> of

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
better choice but my arm or a feel of

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.060 
better choice but my arm or a feel of
guns<00:01:02.730> baby<00:01:02.969> is<00:01:03.329> again<00:01:03.840> strong<00:01:04.199> and<00:01:04.470> you're

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
guns baby is again strong and you're

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:06.560 
guns baby is again strong and you're
sitting<00:01:05.280> there<00:01:05.400> it's<00:01:05.610> getting<00:01:05.729> there<00:01:06.000> okay

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
sitting there it's getting there okay

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.090 
sitting there it's getting there okay
sit<00:01:06.750> Swit<00:01:06.960> up<00:01:07.110> so<00:01:07.229> it's<00:01:07.350> nice<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.680> stiff<00:01:07.920> now

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
sit Swit up so it's nice and stiff now

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.260 
sit Swit up so it's nice and stiff now
I'm<00:01:08.189> gonna<00:01:08.280> gradually<00:01:08.670> add<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:08.939> my<00:01:09.210> sugar

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
I'm gonna gradually add in my sugar

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.480 
I'm gonna gradually add in my sugar
probably<00:01:09.990> about<00:01:10.110> half<00:01:10.380> way<00:01:10.590> at<00:01:10.740> a<00:01:10.770> time<00:01:11.040> it's

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
probably about half way at a time it's

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.340 
probably about half way at a time it's
quite<00:01:11.610> amazing<00:01:11.850> how<00:01:12.150> much<00:01:12.270> one<00:01:12.510> egg<00:01:12.780> white<00:01:13.020> can

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
quite amazing how much one egg white can

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.750 
quite amazing how much one egg white can
give<00:01:13.470> you<00:01:13.560> really<00:01:13.770> isn't<00:01:13.979> it<00:01:14.070> amazing

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
I've just added my second half of the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:17.870 
I've just added my second half of the
sugar<00:01:16.890> I'm<00:01:17.040> not<00:01:17.159> sure<00:01:17.310> if<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.549> see<00:01:17.729> it's

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
template here let's stack it up

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.310 
template here let's stack it up
so<00:01:50.729> my<00:01:50.909> weapon<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.299> choice<00:01:51.329> to<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.930> this<00:01:52.079> is

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
so my weapon of choice to do this is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.050 
so my weapon of choice to do this is
going<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.680> be<00:01:52.770> a<00:01:52.799> teaspoon<00:01:53.520> we're<00:01:53.790> just<00:01:53.909> going

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
going to be a teaspoon we're just going

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.510 
going to be a teaspoon we're just going
to<00:01:54.119> like<00:01:54.299> work<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.930> around<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> outside<00:01:55.979> edge

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to like work it around the outside edge

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.039 
to like work it around the outside edge
initially<00:01:57.119> and<00:01:57.329> then<00:01:57.479> try<00:01:57.689> and<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.899> some

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
initially and then try and get some

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:01.310 
initially and then try and get some
height<00:01:58.290> on<00:01:58.409> it<00:01:59.509> there<00:02:00.509> we<00:02:00.600> go<00:02:00.750> so<00:02:00.930> I<00:02:00.960> don't<00:02:01.020> want

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
height on it there we go so I don't want

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.139 
height on it there we go so I don't want
to<00:02:01.380> load<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.680> too<00:02:01.890> much<00:02:02.040> that<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.490> pretty<00:02:02.880> much

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
to load it too much that is pretty much

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.760 
to load it too much that is pretty much
the<00:02:03.509> most<00:02:03.750> I'll<00:02:04.049> get<00:02:04.229> out<00:02:04.350> of<00:02:04.380> it<00:02:04.530> we're<00:02:04.649> just

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
the most I'll get out of it we're just

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.499 
the most I'll get out of it we're just
going<00:02:04.890> to<00:02:04.920> try<00:02:05.070> and<00:02:05.189> make<00:02:05.280> like<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> little<00:02:06.299> rim

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
going to try and make like a little rim

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.359 
going to try and make like a little rim
around<00:02:07.020> the<00:02:07.140> edge<00:02:07.229> here<00:02:07.530> just<00:02:07.770> so<00:02:07.860> my<00:02:08.009> fill<00:02:08.250> in

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
around the edge here just so my fill in

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.830 
around the edge here just so my fill in
the<00:02:08.580> cream<00:02:08.819> and<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.209> peach<00:02:09.420> that<00:02:09.660> I'm<00:02:09.720> going

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
the cream and the peach that I'm going

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.910 
the cream and the peach that I'm going
to<00:02:09.899> use<00:02:10.050> will<00:02:10.709> sit<00:02:10.920> perfectly<00:02:11.370> in<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.489> middle

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
to use will sit perfectly in the middle

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.740 
to use will sit perfectly in the middle
right<00:02:12.760> so<00:02:12.880> it's<00:02:13.000> really<00:02:13.150> going<00:02:13.390> the<00:02:13.540> oven

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
right so it's really going the oven

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.790 
right so it's really going the oven
hopefully<00:02:14.050> you'll<00:02:14.140> see<00:02:14.290> I'll<00:02:14.380> try<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.620> get<00:02:14.770> a

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
hopefully you'll see I'll try to get a

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.050 
hopefully you'll see I'll try to get a
little<00:02:15.040> crater<00:02:15.250> there<00:02:15.550> for<00:02:15.730> my<00:02:15.819> ingredients

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:16.060 
little crater there for my ingredients

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.780 
little crater there for my ingredients
now<00:02:16.360> no<00:02:16.569> pavlova<00:02:17.140> takes<00:02:17.380> about<00:02:17.530> an<00:02:17.709> hour<00:02:17.920> in

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:18.790 
now no pavlova takes about an hour in

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.460 
now no pavlova takes about an hour in
the<00:02:19.000> oven<00:02:19.030> my<00:02:19.510> very<00:02:19.720> messy<00:02:19.900> oven<00:02:20.290> right<00:02:20.410> now

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:20.470

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
but we'll go right in there and give it

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.410 
but we'll go right in there and give it
about<00:02:23.620> ten<00:02:24.069> minutes<00:02:24.250> initially<00:02:24.610> also<00:02:25.060> don't
