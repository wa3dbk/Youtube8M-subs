okay<00:00:01.500> guys<00:00:01.709> I'm<00:00:02.070> gonna<00:00:02.190> show<00:00:02.250> you<00:00:02.429> how<00:00:02.550> to<00:00:02.610> do<00:00:02.879> a

00:00:02.899 --> 00:00:02.909 
okay guys I'm gonna show you how to do a

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:05.329 
okay guys I'm gonna show you how to do a
compression<00:00:03.389> test<00:00:03.600> on<00:00:04.110> this<00:00:04.589> old<00:00:04.740> 2<00:00:05.069> stroke

00:00:05.329 --> 00:00:05.339 
compression test on this old 2 stroke

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.240 
compression test on this old 2 stroke
outboard<00:00:06.319> the<00:00:07.319> first<00:00:07.560> thing<00:00:07.740> you<00:00:07.830> want<00:00:08.010> to<00:00:08.069> do

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:08.250 
outboard the first thing you want to do

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.100 
outboard the first thing you want to do
is<00:00:08.490> take<00:00:08.880> off<00:00:09.090> your<00:00:09.240> plug<00:00:09.510> wires<00:00:09.800> and<00:00:12.110> after

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
is take off your plug wires and after

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:14.330 
is take off your plug wires and after
you've<00:00:13.230> done<00:00:13.259> that<00:00:13.380> need<00:00:13.679> to<00:00:13.830> take<00:00:13.980> out<00:00:14.160> both

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:14.340 
you've done that need to take out both

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.369 
you've done that need to take out both
your<00:00:14.490> spark<00:00:14.759> plugs<00:00:15.030> we've<00:00:15.929> already<00:00:16.080> loosened

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
your spark plugs we've already loosened

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:28.150 
your spark plugs we've already loosened
mine

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.160 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.269 

when<00:00:28.759> you've<00:00:28.939> got<00:00:29.150> your<00:00:29.300> plugs<00:00:29.689> out<00:00:30.220> on<00:00:31.220> a

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
when you've got your plugs out on a

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.100 
when you've got your plugs out on a
two-stroke<00:00:31.880> just<00:00:32.540> want<00:00:32.719> to<00:00:32.809> look<00:00:32.899> at<00:00:33.020> the

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:33.110 
two-stroke just want to look at the

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.130 
two-stroke just want to look at the
color<00:00:33.379> of<00:00:33.530> the<00:00:33.649> insulators<00:00:34.280> and<00:00:34.809> if<00:00:35.809> you<00:00:35.960> look

00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:36.140 
color of the insulators and if you look

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.960 
color of the insulators and if you look
at<00:00:36.260> these<00:00:36.379> two<00:00:36.649> here<00:00:36.890> you<00:00:37.160> can<00:00:37.610> see<00:00:37.760> they're

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:37.970 
at these two here you can see they're

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:41.200 
at these two here you can see they're
both<00:00:38.300> a<00:00:38.420> nice<00:00:38.629> biscuity<00:00:39.230> color<00:00:39.910> if<00:00:40.910> they<00:00:41.090> were

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
both a nice biscuity color if they were

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.910 
both a nice biscuity color if they were
darker<00:00:41.750> that<00:00:42.019> would<00:00:42.110> mean<00:00:42.290> the<00:00:42.530> engine<00:00:42.800> was

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:42.920 
darker that would mean the engine was

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.950 
darker that would mean the engine was
running<00:00:43.100> rich<00:00:43.460> I<00:00:43.730> mean<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:44.480> they<00:00:44.600> were<00:00:44.659> lighter

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:44.960 
running rich I mean if they were lighter

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.479 
running rich I mean if they were lighter
it<00:00:45.379> wouldn't<00:00:45.710> mean<00:00:45.800> they're<00:00:45.949> a<00:00:45.980> running<00:00:46.309> lead

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
it wouldn't mean they're a running lead

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:52.450 
it wouldn't mean they're a running lead
but<00:00:47.480> these<00:00:47.629> two<00:00:47.839> look<00:00:47.989> just<00:00:48.320> right<00:00:51.339> and<00:00:52.339> then

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:52.460 
but these two look just right and then

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.460 
but these two look just right and then
what<00:00:52.640> you<00:00:52.699> want<00:00:52.850> to<00:00:52.909> do<00:00:53.059> is<00:00:53.269> you<00:00:53.360> need<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.510> put

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
what you want to do is you need to put

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.310 
what you want to do is you need to put
your<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:56.030> through<00:00:56.329> your<00:00:56.479> compression<00:00:56.899> tester

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320 
your and through your compression tester

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.950 
your and through your compression tester
into<00:00:57.559> the<00:00:57.860> engine<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:58.339> this<00:00:59.239> is<00:00:59.300> just<00:00:59.570> a<00:00:59.720> cheap

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
into the engine and this is just a cheap

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.689 
into the engine and this is just a cheap
compression<00:01:00.439> test<00:01:00.650> you<00:01:00.830> can<00:01:01.010> find<00:01:01.430> the<00:01:01.549> most

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
compression test you can find the most

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:04.359 
compression test you can find the most
term<00:01:02.059> those<00:01:02.960> car<00:01:03.260> types<00:01:03.589> of<00:01:03.799> things<00:01:03.979> like<00:01:04.189> that

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
term those car types of things like that

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:12.700 
term those car types of things like that
and<00:01:05.110> such<00:01:06.110> as<00:01:06.259> squid<00:01:06.950> mint<00:01:11.259> just<00:01:12.259> hand<00:01:12.500> tight

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:12.710 
and such as squid mint just hand tight

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:23.080 
and such as squid mint just hand tight
or<00:01:12.920> do

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.550 

and<00:01:24.090> when<00:01:24.479> you've<00:01:24.600> got<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.840> screwed<00:01:25.140> in<00:01:25.259> you

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
and when you've got it screwed in you

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:26.899 
and when you've got it screwed in you
want<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> make<00:01:25.890> sure<00:01:25.920> your<00:01:26.280> kill<00:01:26.520> switch<00:01:26.549> on

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:26.909 
want to make sure your kill switch on

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.969 
want to make sure your kill switch on
your<00:01:27.270> engine<00:01:27.539> is<00:01:27.630> off<00:01:27.810> when<00:01:28.500> you<00:01:28.590> want<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.770> turn

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
your engine is off when you want to turn

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.760 
your engine is off when you want to turn
it<00:01:29.159> over<00:01:29.719> so<00:01:30.719> I'll<00:01:30.780> just<00:01:30.960> turn<00:01:31.140> it<00:01:31.289> over<00:01:31.409> for<00:01:31.740> a

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
it over so I'll just turn it over for a

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:39.529 
it over so I'll just turn it over for a
couple<00:01:32.039> of<00:01:32.100> seconds<00:01:32.520> it<00:01:37.250> should<00:01:38.250> be<00:01:38.579> enough<00:01:38.819> if

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
couple of seconds it should be enough if

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.179 
couple of seconds it should be enough if
you've<00:01:39.840> got<00:01:40.049> someone<00:01:40.319> else<00:01:40.500> it's<00:01:40.740> useful

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
you've got someone else it's useful

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.800 
you've got someone else it's useful
because<00:01:41.939> they<00:01:42.119> can<00:01:42.270> tell<00:01:42.390> you<00:01:42.539> when<00:01:42.630> this<00:01:42.750> is

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
because they can tell you when this is

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.889 
because they can tell you when this is
reached<00:01:43.380> max<00:01:43.679> and<00:01:44.209> but<00:01:45.209> if<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.450> look<00:01:45.630> at<00:01:45.780> this

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
reached max and but if we look at this

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:50.359 
reached max and but if we look at this
tops<00:01:46.170> in<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.679> what<00:01:47.130> about<00:01:47.219> 105<00:01:48.859> if<00:01:49.859> so<00:01:50.159> if<00:01:50.219> we

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
tops in here what about 105 if so if we

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.520 
tops in here what about 105 if so if we
do<00:01:50.520> this<00:01:50.670> a<00:01:50.939> couple<00:01:51.539> of<00:01:51.959> times<00:01:52.200> on<00:01:52.409> each

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:52.530 
do this a couple of times on each

00:01:52.530 --> 00:02:06.520 
do this a couple of times on each
cylinder<00:01:53.009> just<00:01:53.340> to<00:01:53.810> make<00:01:54.810> sure<00:01:54.959> were<00:01:55.049> accurate

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.460 

should<00:02:07.530> be<00:02:07.709> good<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.840> we'll<00:02:09.989> take<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> higher

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
should be good and we'll take the higher

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:16.580 
should be good and we'll take the higher
reading<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:12.510> we're<00:02:12.959> looking<00:02:13.140> at<00:02:13.200> about<00:02:13.319> 105<00:02:15.590> on

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
reading so we're looking at about 105 on

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.949 
reading so we're looking at about 105 on
this<00:02:16.940> top<00:02:17.940> cylinder

00:02:23.949 --> 00:02:23.959 

00:02:23.959 --> 00:02:28.210 

let's<00:02:24.959> me<00:02:25.140> to<00:02:25.200> the<00:02:25.440> rib<00:02:25.590> shitty<00:02:26.750> there<00:02:27.750> we<00:02:27.900> are

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
let's me to the rib shitty there we are

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:33.110 
let's me to the rib shitty there we are
and<00:02:29.220> move<00:02:29.549> over<00:02:30.120> to<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.349> bottom<00:02:32.000> so<00:02:33.000> I'm

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
and move over to the bottom so I'm

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.780 
and move over to the bottom so I'm
looking<00:02:33.450> for<00:02:33.599> freshmen<00:02:33.930> can<00:02:34.170> any<00:02:34.349> of<00:02:34.440> this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:47.970 

make<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:38.970> easier

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.470 

and<00:02:48.980> we'll<00:02:49.130> screw<00:02:49.400> this<00:02:49.550> into<00:02:50.120> the<00:02:50.330> bottom

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:50.480 
and we'll screw this into the bottom

00:02:50.480 --> 00:03:05.290 
and we'll screw this into the bottom
cylinder<00:03:02.200> so<00:03:03.200> when<00:03:03.319> you're<00:03:03.440> doing<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:04.300> you

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.300 
cylinder so when you're doing this you

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.080 
cylinder so when you're doing this you
basically<00:03:05.750> anything<00:03:06.019> over<00:03:06.440> 100<00:03:06.620> M<00:03:07.340> is<00:03:07.610> good<00:03:07.880> I

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
basically anything over 100 M is good I

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.330 
basically anything over 100 M is good I
mean<00:03:08.420> this<00:03:08.540> is<00:03:08.720> an<00:03:08.840> old<00:03:08.930> engine<00:03:09.230> so<00:03:09.860> normally<00:03:10.310> I

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:10.340 
mean this is an old engine so normally I

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:12.670 
mean this is an old engine so normally I
think<00:03:10.370> you'll<00:03:10.610> be<00:03:10.670> looking<00:03:10.910> about<00:03:11.060> 120<00:03:11.840> 140

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
think you'll be looking about 120 140

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:16.750 
think you'll be looking about 120 140
psi<00:03:13.430> but<00:03:14.330> anything<00:03:14.690> over<00:03:14.930> 100<00:03:15.519> you<00:03:16.519> can<00:03:16.550> be

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
psi but anything over 100 you can be

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.789 
psi but anything over 100 you can be
happy<00:03:17.060> with<00:03:17.239> those<00:03:17.720> long<00:03:18.019> as<00:03:18.200> both<00:03:18.380> cylinders

00:03:18.789 --> 00:03:18.799 
happy with those long as both cylinders

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.130 
happy with those long as both cylinders
are<00:03:19.190> within<00:03:19.400> about<00:03:19.760> 10<00:03:20.209> psi<00:03:20.660> of<00:03:20.720> each<00:03:20.930> other

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
are within about 10 psi of each other

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:26.080 
are within about 10 psi of each other
and<00:03:22.180> so<00:03:23.180> the<00:03:23.269> top<00:03:23.450> M<00:03:23.569> is<00:03:23.660> about<00:03:23.920> 105<00:03:24.940> make<00:03:25.940> sure

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090 
and so the top M is about 105 make sure

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.210 
and so the top M is about 105 make sure
that's<00:03:26.209> in<00:03:26.420> properly<00:03:26.840> so<00:03:27.470> we<00:03:27.709> want<00:03:27.890> this<00:03:28.040> one

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
that's in properly so we want this one

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:53.470 
that's in properly so we want this one
to<00:03:28.280> be<00:03:28.810> 100<00:03:29.810> 110<00:03:34.750> 115<00:03:35.750> will<00:03:35.930> be<00:03:36.049> good

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:53.480 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:56.390 

this<00:03:54.480> one's<00:03:54.689> actually<00:03:55.139> this<00:03:55.769> one's<00:03:55.980> hi<00:03:56.189> this

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
this one's actually this one's hi this

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.860 
this one's actually this one's hi this
one's<00:03:56.579> about<00:03:56.790> 112<00:03:57.480> and<00:03:58.069> 100-500<00:03:59.069> 12<00:03:59.730> and<00:04:00.060> that

00:04:00.860 --> 00:04:00.870 
one's about 112 and 100-500 12 and that

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:01.640 
one's about 112 and 100-500 12 and that
should<00:04:01.019> be<00:04:01.109> just<00:04:01.319> fine

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
should be just fine

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:06.410 
should be just fine
and<00:04:03.859> actually<00:04:04.859> did<00:04:05.040> this<00:04:05.189> earlier<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:06.269> they

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
and actually did this earlier and they

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.360 
and actually did this earlier and they
were<00:04:06.450> both<00:04:06.719> around<00:04:06.989> 110<00:04:07.680> so<00:04:07.889> it's<00:04:08.010> probably

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
were both around 110 so it's probably

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.440 
were both around 110 so it's probably
this<00:04:08.969> crappy<00:04:09.900> gauge<00:04:10.159> bit<00:04:11.159> sticky<00:04:11.489> if<00:04:12.150> you<00:04:12.299> do

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.450 
this crappy gauge bit sticky if you do

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:14.929 
this crappy gauge bit sticky if you do
it<00:04:12.540> a<00:04:12.599> few<00:04:12.780> times<00:04:12.840> you<00:04:13.230> should<00:04:13.439> be<00:04:13.560> okay<00:04:13.939> so

00:04:14.929 --> 00:04:14.939 
it a few times you should be okay so

00:04:14.939 --> 00:04:17.509 
it a few times you should be okay so
that's<00:04:15.120> how<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.329> compression<00:04:15.989> test<00:04:16.259> and<00:04:16.560> a<00:04:17.370> 2

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:17.519 
that's how you compression test and a 2

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.300 
that's how you compression test and a 2
stroke<00:04:17.699> outboard<00:04:18.530> if<00:04:19.530> you<00:04:19.739> want<00:04:19.889> to<00:04:19.949> check<00:04:20.099> the

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
stroke outboard if you want to check the

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.029 
stroke outboard if you want to check the
spark<00:04:20.639> and<00:04:21.060> just<00:04:21.870> take<00:04:22.079> one<00:04:22.289> your<00:04:22.440> spark<00:04:22.800> plugs

00:04:23.029 --> 00:04:23.039 
spark and just take one your spark plugs

00:04:23.039 --> 00:04:26.150 
spark and just take one your spark plugs
out<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.520> put<00:04:24.330> it<00:04:24.419> back<00:04:24.570> inside<00:04:25.110> the<00:04:25.169> spark

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
out and put it back inside the spark

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.370 
out and put it back inside the spark
plug<00:04:26.340> cap<00:04:26.370> and<00:04:26.820> just<00:04:27.240> put<00:04:27.449> the<00:04:27.599> spark<00:04:28.320> plug

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
plug cap and just put the spark plug

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:30.469 
plug cap and just put the spark plug
against<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.919> engine<00:04:29.250> and<00:04:30.060> you'll<00:04:30.210> be<00:04:30.270> able<00:04:30.360> to

00:04:30.469 --> 00:04:30.479 
against the engine and you'll be able to

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.020 
against the engine and you'll be able to
see<00:04:30.660> if<00:04:30.720> it's<00:04:30.900> sparking<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:31.650> any<00:04:32.580> questions

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
see if it's sparking and any questions

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.790 
see if it's sparking and any questions
on<00:04:33.120> the<00:04:33.240> video<00:04:33.539> just<00:04:33.780> ask<00:04:33.990> thanks<00:04:34.710> for

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
on the video just ask thanks for

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.130 
on the video just ask thanks for
watching
