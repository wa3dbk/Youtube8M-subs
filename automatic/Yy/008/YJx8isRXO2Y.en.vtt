processing package for the galaxy s5 we

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.499 
processing package for the galaxy s5 we
will<00:01:19.860> say<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> Snapdragon<00:01:20.880> 600<00:01:21.360> that

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
will say that the Snapdragon 600 that

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.420 
will say that the Snapdragon 600 that
was<00:01:21.630> originally<00:01:22.170> in<00:01:22.320> the<00:01:22.350> s4<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:23.009> still<00:01:23.189> doing

was originally in the s4 is still doing
a<00:01:23.520> great<00:01:23.729> job<00:01:23.759> even<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.450> this<00:01:24.479> day<00:01:24.630> and<00:01:25.049> that

a great job even to this day and that

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:26.810 
a great job even to this day and that
should<00:01:25.530> only<00:01:25.619> mean<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.100> galaxy<00:01:26.460> s5<00:01:26.790> will

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
should only mean that the galaxy s5 will

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.719 
should only mean that the galaxy s5 will
really<00:01:27.360> set<00:01:27.630> a<00:01:27.869> higher<00:01:28.439> bar<00:01:28.470> when<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> comes<00:01:29.520> to

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
really set a higher bar when it comes to

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.580 
really set a higher bar when it comes to
processing<00:01:30.240> power<00:01:30.420> but<00:01:31.049> then<00:01:31.170> when<00:01:31.320> we<00:01:31.409> move

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
processing power but then when we move

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:33.440 
processing power but then when we move

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
on to the hardware department will we

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.420 
on to the hardware department will we
will<00:01:33.630> find<00:01:33.900> that<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.170> galaxy<00:01:34.560> s5<00:01:34.950> does<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.929 
2800 million power unit on the s5 but we
will<00:01:43.500> say<00:01:43.710> however<00:01:43.829> is<00:01:44.250> that<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.430> Snapdragon

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
will say however is that the Snapdragon

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:46.639 
will say however is that the Snapdragon
805<00:01:45.210> in<00:01:45.600> theory<00:01:45.960> should<00:01:45.990> be<00:01:46.259> more<00:01:46.439> powerful

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 
805 in theory should be more powerful

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.219 
805 in theory should be more powerful
and<00:01:47.399> also<00:01:47.909> Samsung<00:01:48.329> added<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.750> quite<00:01:49.110> a<00:01:49.140> few

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
and also Samsung added in quite a few

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:51.859 
and also Samsung added in quite a few
options<00:01:49.770> for<00:01:49.860> power<00:01:50.280> saving<00:01:50.850> when<00:01:51.570> it<00:01:51.659> comes

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
options for power saving when it comes

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:53.600 
options for power saving when it comes
to<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.229> new<00:01:52.409> features<00:01:52.619> however<00:01:52.979> everything

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:53.610 
to the new features however everything

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.370 
to the new features however everything
that<00:01:53.850> came<00:01:54.030> from<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> s4<00:01:54.810> does<00:01:55.020> make<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:55.320> to

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
that came from the s4 does make it to

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.080 
that came from the s4 does make it to
the<00:01:55.500> s5<00:01:55.860> and<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> have<00:01:56.520> the<00:01:56.640> additions

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
the s5 and then you have the additions

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.880 
the s5 and then you have the additions
of<00:01:57.180> the<00:01:57.420> fingerprint<00:01:57.990> scanner<00:01:58.259> which<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> a

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
smartphone photography and in the end we

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.570 
smartphone photography and in the end we
do<00:02:30.900> see<00:02:31.080> that<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.350> s5<00:02:31.710> is<00:02:31.740> looking<00:02:32.160> to<00:02:32.250> just<00:02:32.430> be

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
do see that the s5 is looking to just be

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.370 
do see that the s5 is looking to just be
a<00:02:32.760> better<00:02:33.030> camera<00:02:33.330> overall<00:02:33.810> compared<00:02:34.170> to<00:02:34.260> the

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
a better camera overall compared to the

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:36.680 
a better camera overall compared to the
s4<00:02:34.710> and<00:02:35.030> finally<00:02:36.030> when<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.240> comes<00:02:36.390> to<00:02:36.510> software

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:36.690 
s4 and finally when it comes to software

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.180 
s4 and finally when it comes to software
we<00:02:37.050> were<00:02:37.230> really<00:02:37.410> hoping<00:02:37.620> that<00:02:37.830> there<00:02:38.070> was

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
we were really hoping that there was

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.550 
we were really hoping that there was
going<00:02:38.400> to<00:02:38.610> be<00:02:38.640> a<00:02:38.760> big<00:02:39.240> evolution<00:02:39.840> from<00:02:39.990> the<00:02:40.110> s4

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:40.560 
going to be a big evolution from the s4

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:42.460 
going to be a big evolution from the s4
to<00:02:40.710> the<00:02:40.830> s5<00:02:41.250> when<00:02:41.460> it<00:02:41.550> comes<00:02:41.790> to<00:02:41.970> touch<00:02:42.210> ways

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:42.470 
to the s5 when it comes to touch ways

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.540 
to the s5 when it comes to touch ways
unfortunately<00:02:43.470> some<00:02:43.920> of<00:02:43.950> the<00:02:44.100> aspects<00:02:44.460> of

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:44.550 
unfortunately some of the aspects of

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.400 
unfortunately some of the aspects of
TouchWiz<00:02:44.970> were<00:02:45.150> changed<00:02:45.510> but<00:02:45.660> not<00:02:45.870> enough<00:02:46.200> to

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
TouchWiz were changed but not enough to

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.230 
TouchWiz were changed but not enough to
in<00:02:46.830> order<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.070> make<00:02:47.280> it<00:02:47.430> really<00:02:47.700> feel<00:02:47.880> like<00:02:47.910> a

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:48.240 
in order to make it really feel like a

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.540 
in order to make it really feel like a
big<00:02:48.540> difference<00:02:48.990> the<00:02:49.560> inclusion<00:02:50.010> of<00:02:50.100> a<00:02:50.220> recent

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:50.550 
big difference the inclusion of a recent

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:52.220 
big difference the inclusion of a recent
apps<00:02:50.700> button<00:02:50.970> on<00:02:51.060> the<00:02:51.150> s5<00:02:51.510> does<00:02:51.780> allow<00:02:52.050> it<00:02:52.080> to

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
apps button on the s5 does allow it to

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:54.110 
apps button on the s5 does allow it to
have<00:02:52.500> a<00:02:52.650> little<00:02:52.950> bit<00:02:53.040> more<00:02:53.190> multitasking<00:02:53.970> that

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
have a little bit more multitasking that

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.360 
have a little bit more multitasking that
is<00:02:54.270> more<00:02:54.690> easily<00:02:55.080> accessible<00:02:55.770> as<00:02:55.890> you<00:02:56.220> can

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
is more easily accessible as you can

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.040 
is more easily accessible as you can
just<00:02:56.490> jump<00:02:56.730> in<00:02:56.910> and<00:02:57.000> out<00:02:57.150> of<00:02:57.180> apps<00:02:57.510> very<00:02:57.810> easily

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
just jump in and out of apps very easily

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.720 
just jump in and out of apps very easily
instead<00:02:58.770> of<00:02:58.800> having<00:02:58.950> to<00:02:59.100> hold<00:02:59.340> the<00:02:59.550> home

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
instead of having to hold the home

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:02.150 
instead of having to hold the home
button<00:02:59.760> in<00:03:00.420> the<00:03:00.660> s4<00:03:01.110> and<00:03:01.320> finally<00:03:01.920> the<00:03:02.010> my

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
button in the s4 and finally the my

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:03.890 
button in the s4 and finally the my
magazine<00:03:02.670> UI<00:03:02.880> has<00:03:03.210> been<00:03:03.450> brought<00:03:03.600> to<00:03:03.660> the

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
magazine UI has been brought to the

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.290 
magazine UI has been brought to the
front<00:03:04.230> and<00:03:04.410> is<00:03:04.830> now<00:03:05.040> a<00:03:05.070> second<00:03:05.610> screen<00:03:05.790> all<00:03:06.120> the

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
front and is now a second screen all the

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300 
front and is now a second screen all the
way<00:03:06.390> on<00:03:06.600> the<00:03:06.780> left<00:03:06.810> much<00:03:07.380> like<00:03:07.590> a<00:03:07.770> Google<00:03:08.160> now

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
way on the left much like a Google now

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.820 
way on the left much like a Google now
in<00:03:08.580> stock<00:03:08.880> Android<00:03:09.390> so<00:03:09.780> it<00:03:09.930> does<00:03:10.080> change<00:03:10.320> a<00:03:10.530> few

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:10.830 
in stock Android so it does change a few

of the aspects but in the end TouchWiz
still<00:03:12.780> pretty<00:03:13.170> much<00:03:13.320> looks<00:03:13.590> like<00:03:13.650> TouchWiz<00:03:14.250> so

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670
