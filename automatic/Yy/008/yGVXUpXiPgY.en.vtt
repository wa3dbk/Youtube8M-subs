be able to get this palm up most of the

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.180 
be able to get this palm up most of the
time<00:02:29.690> because<00:02:29.900> I'm<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> only<00:02:30.530> person<00:02:30.800> that

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.190 
time because I'm the only person that

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:32.440 
time because I'm the only person that
actually<00:02:31.310> does<00:02:31.640> anything<00:02:31.910> on<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.209> team

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:32.450 
actually does anything on the team

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.720 
actually does anything on the team
although<00:02:33.140> there's<00:02:33.350> two<00:02:33.620> 15th<00:02:34.040> prestige<00:02:34.250> is<00:02:34.610> on

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
although there's two 15th prestige is on

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.640 
although there's two 15th prestige is on
my<00:02:34.850> team<00:02:34.910> which<00:02:35.209> I<00:02:35.420> realize<00:02:35.900> should<00:02:36.230> have<00:02:36.410> some

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:36.650 
my team which I realize should have some

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.900 
my team which I realize should have some
skill<00:02:36.920> and<00:02:37.160> we<00:02:37.250> should<00:02:37.400> be<00:02:37.520> able<00:02:37.550> to<00:02:37.760> win<00:02:37.880> the

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:37.910 
skill and we should be able to win the

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.430 
skill and we should be able to win the
game<00:02:38.030> because<00:02:38.569> the<00:02:38.660> other<00:02:38.810> team<00:02:38.900> has<00:02:39.200> lower

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:39.440 
game because the other team has lower

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.470 
game because the other team has lower
prestigious<00:02:40.130> that<00:02:40.819> doesn't<00:02:41.120> really<00:02:41.209> mean<00:02:41.420> a

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
prestigious that doesn't really mean a

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.210 
prestigious that doesn't really mean a
whole<00:02:41.720> lot<00:02:41.750> because<00:02:42.110> these<00:02:42.230> 15th<00:02:42.680> prestigious

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:43.220 
whole lot because these 15th prestigious

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.680 
whole lot because these 15th prestigious
didn't<00:02:43.459> do<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> whole<00:02:43.700> lot<00:02:43.910> during<00:02:44.450> this<00:02:44.630> game

about<00:03:00.980> more<00:03:01.220> than<00:03:01.250> his<00:03:01.489> chill<00:03:01.700> defend<00:03:02.090> its

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
about more than his chill defend its

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.420 
about more than his chill defend its
win-loss<00:03:02.569> it's<00:03:02.930> not<00:03:03.470> because<00:03:03.890> if<00:03:04.010> I<00:03:04.160> died

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
win-loss it's not because if I died

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.830 
win-loss it's not because if I died
there<00:03:04.760> I<00:03:04.790> would<00:03:05.030> have<00:03:05.060> had<00:03:05.239> to<00:03:05.330> run<00:03:05.510> all<00:03:05.750> the

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
there I would have had to run all the

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.000 
there I would have had to run all the
way<00:03:05.900> back<00:03:06.080> and<00:03:06.350> they<00:03:06.470> would<00:03:06.590> have<00:03:06.680> taken<00:03:06.830> over

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:07.010 
way back and they would have taken over

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.160 
way back and they would have taken over
the<00:03:07.280> positioning<00:03:07.760> of<00:03:07.819> underground<00:03:08.360> so<00:03:09.140> I

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
the positioning of underground so I

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.080 
the positioning of underground so I

underground area over a considering they

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:14.920 
underground area over a considering they

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
somehow I have no idea I even free fired

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.030 
somehow I have no idea I even free fired
and<00:03:59.600> with<00:03:59.690> the<00:03:59.810> Blackbird<00:04:00.290> he<00:04:00.680> is<00:04:00.769> pulling

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:01.040 
and with the Blackbird he is pulling

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.910 
and with the Blackbird he is pulling
host<00:04:01.459> there's<00:04:01.819> no<00:04:02.030> possible<00:04:02.810> way<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:03.380> I

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:03.920 
host there's no possible way that I

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.430 
host there's no possible way that I
would<00:04:04.250> have<00:04:04.340> lost<00:04:04.519> that<00:04:04.760> gunfight<00:04:05.359> let<00:04:06.260> the

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
would have lost that gunfight let the

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.140 
would have lost that gunfight let the
reasoning<00:04:06.799> I'm<00:04:06.980> our<00:04:07.190> tube<00:04:07.430> our<00:04:07.579> connection

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
reasoning I'm our tube our connection

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.229 
reasoning I'm our tube our connection
and<00:04:08.299> he's<00:04:09.079> on<00:04:09.230> at<00:04:09.530> least<00:04:09.920> a<00:04:10.069> five<00:04:10.340> that's<00:04:11.060> the

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:11.239 
and he's on at least a five that's the

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.479 
and he's on at least a five that's the
whole<00:04:11.600> reason<00:04:11.630> why<00:04:12.139> I<00:04:12.170> lost<00:04:12.620> accident<00:04:13.100> nothing

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
whole reason why I lost accident nothing

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.370 
whole reason why I lost accident nothing
I<00:04:13.579> can<00:04:13.760> do<00:04:13.850> to<00:04:13.880> prevent<00:04:14.150> that<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:15.019> right<00:04:15.170> now<00:04:15.200> we

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
I can do to prevent that so right now we

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:16.990 
I can do to prevent that so right now we
get<00:04:15.620> the<00:04:15.650> bomb<00:04:15.950> up<00:04:16.160> I<00:04:16.310> know<00:04:16.400> it's<00:04:16.609> my<00:04:16.729> black

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
get the bomb up I know it's my black

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.479 
get the bomb up I know it's my black
burger<00:04:17.269> is<00:04:17.479> running<00:04:17.959> out<00:04:18.049> of<00:04:18.109> time<00:04:18.530> so<00:04:19.190> what

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:19.489 
burger is running out of time so what

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.529 
burger is running out of time so what
we're<00:04:19.609> going<00:04:19.700> to<00:04:19.789> do<00:04:19.940> is<00:04:20.030> we're<00:04:20.180> going<00:04:20.299> to<00:04:20.389> have

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:20.539 
we're going to do is we're going to have

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.630 
we're going to do is we're going to have
to<00:04:20.720> completely<00:04:21.169> take<00:04:21.410> control<00:04:21.709> of<00:04:21.830> a<00:04:22.130> now

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
to completely take control of a now

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.050 
to completely take control of a now
right<00:04:22.880> here<00:04:23.090> I<00:04:23.150> wanted<00:04:23.539> to<00:04:23.630> end<00:04:23.659> the

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
right here I wanted to end the

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.580 
right here I wanted to end the
because<00:04:24.389> I<00:04:24.450> felt<00:04:24.660> comfortable<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.230> we<00:04:25.410> could

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
because I felt comfortable that we could

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.340 
because I felt comfortable that we could
hold<00:04:25.800> it<00:04:26.010> without<00:04:26.340> me<00:04:26.550> dying<00:04:26.850> so<00:04:27.510> I<00:04:27.870> realize

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
hold it without me dying so I realize

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.110 
hold it without me dying so I realize
