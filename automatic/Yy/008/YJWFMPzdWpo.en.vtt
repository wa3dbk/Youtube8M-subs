let's<00:00:34.770> say<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.040> we<00:00:35.130> were<00:00:35.219> going<00:00:35.309> to<00:00:35.399> take<00:00:35.520> a

let's say that we were going to take a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.970 
let's say that we were going to take a
sample<00:00:35.940> of<00:00:36.000> this<00:00:36.469> what<00:00:37.469> we<00:00:37.559> need<00:00:37.739> to<00:00:37.890> identify

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
sample of this what we need to identify

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.270 
sample of this what we need to identify
we're<00:00:38.730> either<00:00:38.850> take<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.960> whole<00:00:40.170> sample<00:00:40.530> or<00:00:40.890> we

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
we're either take the whole sample or we

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.250 
we're either take the whole sample or we
only<00:00:41.430> really<00:00:41.670> need<00:00:41.969> the<00:00:42.390> part<00:00:42.809> that<00:00:42.989> came<00:00:43.110> out

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
only really need the part that came out

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.860 
only really need the part that came out
first<00:00:43.500> because<00:00:44.270> when<00:00:45.270> you<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.480> to<00:00:45.539> defecate

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
first because when you go to defecate

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.459 
first because when you go to defecate
any<00:00:46.140> animal<00:00:46.440> defecates<00:00:47.239> it<00:00:48.239> pushes<00:00:48.840> out<00:00:48.960> F

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
any animal defecates it pushes out F

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
the cells that line the you know big

intestine<00:00:57.629> so<00:00:58.109> that<00:00:58.289> when<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.620> scat<00:00:59.190> comes

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
intestine so that when the scat comes

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:00.860 
intestine so that when the scat comes
out<00:00:59.760> that's<00:01:00.180> what<00:01:00.329> you're<00:01:00.449> looking<00:01:00.480> for

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
out that's what you're looking for

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.000 
out that's what you're looking for
you're<00:01:00.960> looking<00:01:01.199> for<00:01:01.320> those<00:01:01.440> cells<00:01:01.739> and<00:01:01.920> got

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
you're looking for those cells and got

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.439 
you're looking for those cells and got
the<00:01:02.100> DNA<00:01:02.250> and<00:01:02.579> if<00:01:02.640> we<00:01:02.730> really<00:01:02.910> could<00:01:03.210> care<00:01:03.420> less

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the DNA and if we really could care less

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.810 
the DNA and if we really could care less
about<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:04.439> scat<00:01:04.710> itself<00:01:05.189> because<00:01:05.580> that's

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
about the scat itself because that's

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.609 
about the scat itself because that's
something<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.240> thing<00:01:06.420> ate<00:01:06.600> we're<00:01:07.380> looking

00:01:07.609 --> 00:01:07.619 
something the thing ate we're looking

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:09.500 
something the thing ate we're looking
for<00:01:07.799> is<00:01:07.890> DNA<00:01:08.220> from<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.490> critter<00:01:08.790> itself<00:01:09.210> and<00:01:09.420> i

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
for is DNA from the critter itself and i

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.700 
for is DNA from the critter itself and i
would<00:01:09.659> say<00:01:09.840> looking<00:01:10.110> at<00:01:10.229> this<00:01:10.380> with<00:01:10.680> this

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
would say looking at this with this

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.310 
would say looking at this with this
pointy<00:01:11.460> tapered<00:01:11.850> end<00:01:12.000> over<00:01:12.180> here<00:01:12.210> that<00:01:12.930> this

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
pointy tapered end over here that this

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:14.870 
pointy tapered end over here that this
would<00:01:13.500> be<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.740> start<00:01:14.040> of<00:01:14.159> it<00:01:14.250> and<00:01:14.460> this<00:01:14.520> is<00:01:14.700> the

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:14.880 
would be the start of it and this is the

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:16.880 
would be the start of it and this is the
end<00:01:15.060> of<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.750> scat<00:01:16.080> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.500> have<00:01:16.619> to<00:01:16.710> kind<00:01:16.799> of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
end of the scat so you have to kind of

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.620 
end of the scat so you have to kind of
look<00:01:16.979> at<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.369> shape<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:17.820> scat<00:01:18.090> and<00:01:18.360> get

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
look at the shape of the scat and get

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.359 
look at the shape of the scat and get
your<00:01:18.750> dog<00:01:18.900> poop<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.350> look<00:01:19.650> at<00:01:19.740> whatever<00:01:19.890> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
your dog poop and look at whatever you

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.670 
your dog poop and look at whatever you
have<00:01:20.490> to<00:01:20.670> look<00:01:20.790> at<00:01:21.030> that's<00:01:21.540> pooping<00:01:21.990> to<00:01:22.409> figure

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
have to look at that's pooping to figure

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.350 
have to look at that's pooping to figure
out<00:01:22.830> all<00:01:22.979> poop<00:01:23.189> comes<00:01:23.430> out<00:01:23.610> we<00:01:24.000> could<00:01:24.240> either

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
out all poop comes out we could either

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.950 
out all poop comes out we could either
use<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:25.409> stick<00:01:26.100> that's<00:01:26.310> in<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.520> area<00:01:26.909> or<00:01:27.090> even

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
use a stick that's in the area or even

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.950 
use a stick that's in the area or even
better<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:29.250> use<00:01:29.430> a<00:01:29.460> sterilized<00:01:30.329> tongue

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
better to use a sterilized tongue

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.260 
better to use a sterilized tongue
depressor<00:01:30.990> an<00:01:31.740> easier<00:01:32.369> method<00:01:32.549> that<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.060> more

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
depressor an easier method that is more

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.690 
depressor an easier method that is more
readily<00:01:33.509> available<00:01:34.020> to<00:01:34.590> everybody<00:01:35.189> which<00:01:35.549> I

got in trouble for on the show is the

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.770 
got in trouble for on the show is the
use<00:01:38.159> of<00:01:38.189> ziplock<00:01:38.670> bags<00:01:38.909> now<00:01:39.180> think<00:01:39.420> about<00:01:39.479> it

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
use of ziplock bags now think about it

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:44.450 
use of ziplock bags now think about it
ziplock<00:01:40.740> bags<00:01:41.040> are<00:01:41.869> sterile<00:01:42.869> you<00:01:43.619> put<00:01:43.829> food<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
ziplock bags are sterile you put food in

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.819 
ziplock bags are sterile you put food in
them<00:01:44.610> we<00:01:45.149> can<00:01:45.270> very<00:01:45.420> carefully<00:01:45.930> open<00:01:46.259> it<00:01:46.409> do
