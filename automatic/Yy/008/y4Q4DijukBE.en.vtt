00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:13.929
 gene flow 

00:00:13.929 --> 00:00:17.789
 the gene flow consists of the exchange of characteristics 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:22.539
 genetic for this to happen there must be a cross has got between 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:27.529
 individuals of the same species or in related 3 13 producing one 

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.250
 integration of the characteristics within the genome of the new 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:34.270
 individuals and their dispersion in the environment 

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.740
 barack obama d 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:43.520
 a natural phenomenon that happens is that the species and that is evolutionary 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.960
 and that it denies the flow of characteristics 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.300
 that can be within the bread population the population 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.540
 d the cultivated towards populations of local and wild crops 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.530
 genetically modified to local crops four wild rams 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.700
 in this project 

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.180
 are participating now that no more important holidays of 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:10.660
 region of 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.830
 in the case of the place in this one they participate to Brazil that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.660
 a country of origin of cultivation 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.830
 and Colombia in the case of 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.120
 of corn is participating 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.060
 and colombia 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:27.300
 and in it in the case of fraud is peru 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:29.430
 and in the case of 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.400
 the rice is costa rica 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:32.620
 for the data 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.350
 of the project 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.670
 knowledge is produced 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.740
 with this knowledge 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.760
 information is generated 

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:44.980
 under the real conditions of our system in these countries 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.110
 and that information must be communicated 

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.360
 in such a way that means are used as a database 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:57.120
 methodologies, strategies and recommendations 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.100
 in turn consigned 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.270
 in physical and virtual documents 24 participating countries 

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:09.230
 they remained of arms methodologies cycle city of all portillo 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.349
 laboratory 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.280
 the database and layers after cited with hatoyama plasma there will be three 

00:02:14.279 --> 00:02:16.849
 atoms shortly after say materials 

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:19.409
 and bet cazorla probability of 

00:02:19.409 --> 00:02:22.629
 promotion has the solidity so it is done 

00:02:22.629 --> 00:02:27.090
 besides the lab we could voice pedace tamales mole polar kutcher and 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.669
 another side sequences by crushing nuclear 

00:02:30.669 --> 00:02:34.489
 so that we can differences of up to thousand sympathetic milestones of this 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.459
 material 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:39.040
 The main objectives of this area of ​​study are the design and development 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.359
 of databases to evaluate monitoring and hopper incorporation 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:44.599
 Tennis strength 

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.930
 as well as the establishment of maps where the location of the 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.950
 commercial cultivation, all of them ancestral without rejecting those associated with 

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.870
 selected crops as very well
