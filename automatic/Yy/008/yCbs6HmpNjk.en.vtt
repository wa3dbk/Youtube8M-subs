00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.859
 greetings to that work and point today we are going 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.420
 to learn to do this point is a 

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:13.710
 fantasy point is in v and has columns 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.360
 of climbs this is the reverse and this 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:19.020
 is the right as you can see is a 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.410
 point that is not reversible this point will 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.720
 complete every six laps in total I've 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.689
 put 20 points on the needle that is 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:31.260
 multiple of nine plus two points of 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:34.170
 edge for the wool that I will use the 

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:36.930
 manufacturer recommends the needles of 4 and 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.600
 I'm going to spend the 5 needles 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.400
 let's start the first round in 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.950
 all the laps we will do the 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.410
 first point and the last one of the right already 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.510
 which are the edge points and we weave the 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 first edge point of the right and 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.110
 we started the first motif weaving a 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:56.270
 backhand point 

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:58.780
 then we weave a point of 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.780
 straight 

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:04.960
 and two points together of the right 

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:14.020
 we take we go and we make a point of 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:16.750
 right but twisted to do the 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:19.329
 twisted point we passed the needle by 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.870
 here behind normal to do the 

00:01:19.329 --> 00:01:25.210
 normal point of law we would do so well 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.570
 but the twisted one we have to take the 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.830
 alarm from behind 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.650
 we passed the wool thread over 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.040
 we get the point and we have our 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:40.220
 twisted right point 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:44.070
 we take vague and now let's do two 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.990
 twisted right together points 

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.030
 we have to do the same as before 

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.920
 but taking two points 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:54.189
 so we take a point 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:57.990
 and so we take the two points 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:57.990
 we passed the wool thread over 

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:05.820
 and we take them out of the needle we already have two 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:09.720
 twisted right together points 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:13.890
 we knit a point of right 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:16.680
 then a backhand point and already 

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.560
 we have finished the first reason we started 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:24.090
 the second reason as before 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:26.580
 the first point we protect the reverse the 

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:29.220
 second point we weave the right and 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.880
 then we make two points 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:31.880
 of the right 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:41.799
 we take baba and we make a point of 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:41.799
 twisted right 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:52.070
 we take vague and we make two points together 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:52.070
 of twisted right 

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:59.110
 so we have one 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.959
 and so we have two points together that already 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:04.680
 we have taken with the needle we passed the 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.680
 strand of wool 

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:10.760
 we remove the points from the needle and 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:14.180
 we have 2 points right points 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.460
 twisted we weave a point of right 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.480
 normal 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:21.000
 and a reverse point 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.890
 we have already finished the second reason to 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.290
 then we make an edge point 

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:26.599
 of the right 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.090
 and we have finished with the first round 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.760
 in the second round and in all 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.170
 even twists let's knit the stitches 

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.720
 how they present themselves 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:40.120
 when we do not have a little dot up 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.849
 that is down we weave it from 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.430
 right when we have the little dot towards 

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:49.630
 up we knit we have it upside down and when 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:52.720
 let's have a strand or vague knitting we have the 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:54.569
 obama upside down that we will do in 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.819
 all even turns 

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:01.630
 we started the third round and we weave the 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:04.150
 first edge point of the right and 

00:04:01.630 --> 00:04:07.140
 we started the first motif weaving a 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.140
 backhand point 

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:14.290
 next we have two points together 

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:14.290
 the right 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.690
 we take vague and we make a point of 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:22.690
 straight 

00:04:23.889 --> 00:04:27.490
 Now let's make a point of law 

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:30.189
 twisted 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.620
 we pass the needle from behind we take 

00:04:30.189 --> 00:04:37.699
 strand and we get the point 

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:41.270
 we make a normal right point 

00:04:37.699 --> 00:04:44.080
 we take low and we have two points together 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:49.289
 of twisted right 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.289
 we take the wool from behind we passed thread 

00:04:49.689 --> 00:04:53.189
 and we get the points 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:05:00.060
 then we weave a backhand point 

00:04:57.330 --> 00:05:02.670
 and we have finished weaving the first 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.960
 motive let's repeat the same for 

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:08.050
 make the second reason 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:11.020
 we have a reverse point 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:13.530
 then two points together 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:13.530
 right 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.300
 we take baba and we make a point of 

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:21.750
 straight 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:23.880
 now we start with a point of right 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:28.850
 twisted 

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:28.850
 we passed the needle from behind 

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:39.490
 we make a normal right point 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.169
 we take slime and we make two points together 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.169
 of twisted right 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:47.980
 two points together that we have taken in the 

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.980
 needle 

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.820
 We passed thread and got the two points 

00:05:51.409 --> 00:05:57.770
 finally we weave a point of the reverse 

00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:00.920
 and we have finished the second reason 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:03.860
 we weave our edge point we have already 

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:06.170
 finished the third round once 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:08.660
 we have done the fourth round weaving 

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.780
 the points as they are presented we are going to 

00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:13.400
 start the fifth round we started with 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:14.920
 the first edge point which is the 

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.139
 straight 

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:21.629
 we have a point of the reverse 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:24.110
 then we make 7 points of 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:24.110
 straight 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:32.320
 and finally we make a reverse point and 

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:34.300
 we have already finished the first reason and 

00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:36.880
 let's do the same thing to weave the 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:40.270
 second reason we started with a point of 

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.750
 reverse then we make 7 points of 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:42.750
 straight 

00:06:44.650 --> 00:06:49.810
 we weave a backhand point and we have already 

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:51.759
 finished the second reason 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:54.669
 finally we knit our point of 

00:06:51.759 --> 00:06:58.090
 edge and we have finished the fifth round 

00:06:54.669 --> 00:07:00.850
 the sixth round we will knit the stitches 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:03.340
 how they present themselves once the 

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:05.680
 sixth round is like this here we have a 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.139
 reason and here we have another reason 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.240
 we have to repeat from round 1 

00:07:08.139 --> 00:07:12.130
 until round 6 as many times as 

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.430
 we need to finalize our 

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:18.509
 project I hope you liked it 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:18.509
 greetings from work and point
