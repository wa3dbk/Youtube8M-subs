about how I have made my little
accordion<00:00:09.960> art<00:00:10.530> journals<00:00:10.950> these<00:00:11.490> are<00:00:11.639> just

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
accordion art journals these are just

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.660 
accordion art journals these are just
many<00:00:12.090> art<00:00:12.360> journals<00:00:12.840> that<00:00:13.349> I've<00:00:13.530> made<00:00:13.830> using

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
many art journals that I've made using

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.529 
many art journals that I've made using
mostly<00:00:15.509> Gelli<00:00:16.170> plate<00:00:16.260> prints<00:00:16.949> as<00:00:17.359> well<00:00:18.359> as<00:00:18.510> a

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:18.539 
mostly Gelli plate prints as well as a

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:20.570 
mostly Gelli plate prints as well as a
few<00:00:18.779> other<00:00:18.990> products<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.130> I<00:00:20.189> thought<00:00:20.340> I<00:00:20.400> would

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:20.580 
few other products and I thought I would

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:22.910 
few other products and I thought I would
just<00:00:20.880> show<00:00:21.119> them<00:00:21.390> to<00:00:21.630> you<00:00:21.869> and<00:00:22.050> give<00:00:22.710> you<00:00:22.830> a

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
just show them to you and give you a

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.540 
just show them to you and give you a
quick<00:00:23.130> explanation<00:00:23.490> of<00:00:24.150> how<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.930> made<00:00:25.230> these<00:00:25.550> so

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
quick explanation of how I made these so

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.000 
quick explanation of how I made these so
they<00:00:27.210> started<00:00:27.750> with<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.289> a<00:00:28.380> single<00:00:28.619> piece<00:00:28.980> of

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
they started with just a single piece of

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:33.200 
they started with just a single piece of
paper<00:00:29.220> in<00:00:29.699> this<00:00:29.849> case<00:00:30.119> for<00:00:30.449> this<00:00:30.599> one<00:00:30.840> I<00:00:32.210> used

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
paper in this case for this one I used

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.150 
paper in this case for this one I used
some<00:00:33.540> Bristol<00:00:33.899> so<00:00:34.620> just<00:00:34.829> some<00:00:34.950> ordinary

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
some Bristol so just some ordinary

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.170 
some Bristol so just some ordinary
Bristol<00:00:35.640> paper<00:00:36.110> this<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.170> 11<00:00:37.590> by<00:00:37.829> 14<00:00:37.890> I<00:00:38.610> just

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
Bristol paper this is 11 by 14 I just

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.069 
Bristol paper this is 11 by 14 I just
took<00:00:39.300> a<00:00:39.360> piece<00:00:39.660> of<00:00:39.690> it<00:00:41.270> measured<00:00:42.270> it<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.719> cut

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
took a piece of it measured it and cut

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:47.380 
took a piece of it measured it and cut
it<00:00:43.110> down<00:00:43.520> the<00:00:44.520> length<00:00:44.700> evenly<00:00:45.600> in<00:00:45.719> half<00:00:45.989> and

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
it down the length evenly in half and

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.990 
it down the length evenly in half and
then<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> took<00:00:48.780> those<00:00:49.020> two<00:00:49.320> pieces<00:00:49.620> to<00:00:50.579> my<00:00:50.760> jelly

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
then I took those two pieces to my jelly

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.020 
then I took those two pieces to my jelly
plate<00:00:51.420> and<00:00:51.719> did<00:00:52.559> all<00:00:52.710> kinds<00:00:53.340> of<00:00:53.399> layers<00:00:53.640> and

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
plate and did all kinds of layers and

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.369 
plate and did all kinds of layers and
layers<00:00:54.210> and<00:00:54.329> layers<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.840> Gelli<00:00:55.260> plate

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
layers and layers of Gelli plate

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:59.209 
layers and layers of Gelli plate
printing<00:00:57.289> until<00:00:58.289> I<00:00:58.320> was<00:00:58.559> happy<00:00:58.920> with<00:00:59.160> the

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
printing until I was happy with the

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:02.389 
printing until I was happy with the
results<00:00:59.399> and<00:01:00.030> I<00:01:00.510> did<00:01:00.690> both<00:01:00.899> sides<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.739> both<00:01:02.129> of

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
results and I did both sides of both of

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.700 
results and I did both sides of both of
those<00:01:02.550> halves<00:01:02.879> so<00:01:03.750> I<00:01:03.780> ended<00:01:04.140> up<00:01:04.290> with<00:01:04.350> two

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
those halves so I ended up with two

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.899 
those halves so I ended up with two
pieces<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.189> 11<00:01:05.729> by<00:01:05.880> 14<00:01:05.939> paper<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.380> a<00:01:08.130> long<00:01:08.400> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
pieces of 11 by 14 paper in a long and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:11.770 
pieces of 11 by 14 paper in a long and
long<00:01:09.330> strips<00:01:09.869> kind<00:01:10.260> of<00:01:10.350> about<00:01:10.590> that<00:01:10.799> length

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:11.780 
long strips kind of about that length

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.940 
long strips kind of about that length
then<00:01:12.780> what<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.020> did<00:01:13.229> and<00:01:13.409> they<00:01:13.470> were<00:01:13.530> printed<00:01:13.860> on

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
then what I did and they were printed on

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.429 
then what I did and they were printed on
both<00:01:14.100> sides<00:01:14.400> then<00:01:15.270> what<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.540> did<00:01:15.780> is<00:01:16.020> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
both sides then what I did is I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.850 
both sides then what I did is I
overlapped<00:01:17.040> I<00:01:17.810> folded<00:01:18.810> them<00:01:18.960> first<00:01:19.350> of<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.619> I

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
overlapped I folded them first of all I

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.010 
overlapped I folded them first of all I
folded<00:01:20.310> them<00:01:20.490> accordion<00:01:21.030> style<00:01:21.240> so<00:01:21.630> folded

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
folded them accordion style so folded

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.530 
folded them accordion style so folded
them<00:01:22.140> in<00:01:22.290> half<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.979> then<00:01:23.220> in<00:01:23.369> quarters<00:01:23.820> to

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
them in half and then in quarters to

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.100 
them in half and then in quarters to
give<00:01:24.689> me<00:01:24.960> four<00:01:25.320> pieces<00:01:25.950> to<00:01:26.220> each<00:01:26.540> half<00:01:27.540> of<00:01:27.840> the

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
give me four pieces to each half of the

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.429 
give me four pieces to each half of the
page<00:01:28.490> then<00:01:29.490> I<00:01:29.640> overlapped<00:01:30.270> one<00:01:30.900> of<00:01:31.049> each<00:01:31.259> of

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
page then I overlapped one of each of

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.560 
page then I overlapped one of each of
those<00:01:31.560> sections<00:01:32.130> glued<00:01:32.820> them<00:01:33.090> together<00:01:33.240> I

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
those sections glued them together I

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.640 
those sections glued them together I
don't<00:01:33.750> know<00:01:33.810> if<00:01:33.869> you<00:01:33.960> can<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.470> on<00:01:34.619> camera

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
don't know if you can see that on camera

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.740 
don't know if you can see that on camera
but<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:35.340> is<00:01:35.520> actually<00:01:35.670> an<00:01:35.880> overlap<00:01:36.000> of<00:01:36.479> this

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
but this is actually an overlap of this

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.010 
but this is actually an overlap of this
piece<00:01:37.079> and<00:01:37.350> this<00:01:38.130> piece<00:01:38.390> glued<00:01:39.390> it<00:01:39.630> together

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
piece and this piece glued it together

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.130 
piece and this piece glued it together
with<00:01:40.470> just<00:01:40.680> some<00:01:40.829> white<00:01:40.979> glue<00:01:41.159> and<00:01:41.840> then<00:01:42.840> just

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
with just some white glue and then just

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.520 
with just some white glue and then just
did<00:01:43.290> some<00:01:43.500> decorative<00:01:43.829> washi<00:01:44.280> tape<00:01:44.700> over<00:01:45.210> that

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:45.530 
did some decorative washi tape over that

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.630 
did some decorative washi tape over that
connection<00:01:46.530> that<00:01:46.920> where<00:01:47.130> that<00:01:47.310> Ridge<00:01:47.610> is

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
connection that where that Ridge is

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.210 
connection that where that Ridge is
where<00:01:48.180> the<00:01:48.270> two<00:01:48.450> pieces<00:01:48.659> meet<00:01:49.200> just<00:01:49.950> to<00:01:50.070> make

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
where the two pieces meet just to make

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.580 
where the two pieces meet just to make
it<00:01:50.250> look<00:01:50.399> a<00:01:50.640> little<00:01:50.790> better<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:52.170> is<00:01:52.380> as

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
it look a little better and that is as

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.760 
it look a little better and that is as
simple<00:01:53.659> little<00:01:54.659> art<00:01:54.869> journal<00:01:55.259> as<00:01:55.439> you<00:01:55.590> can

simple little art journal as you can

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.480 
simple little art journal as you can
possibly<00:01:56.310> make<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:57.270> fun<00:01:57.960> it's<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.799> great<00:01:59.159> size

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
possibly make it's fun it's a great size

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.359 
possibly make it's fun it's a great size
for<00:01:59.850> traveling<00:02:00.390> I<00:02:00.509> love<00:02:00.960> taking<00:02:01.439> art<00:02:01.950> journals

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
for traveling I love taking art journals

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.459 
for traveling I love taking art journals
this<00:02:02.549> size<00:02:02.850> with<00:02:03.180> me<00:02:03.450> when<00:02:03.840> I<00:02:03.869> travel<00:02:04.200> because

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
this size with me when I travel because

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.499 
this size with me when I travel because
they<00:02:04.799> travel<00:02:05.009> so<00:02:05.340> well<00:02:05.549> they're<00:02:05.790> so<00:02:05.969> small<00:02:06.299> and
