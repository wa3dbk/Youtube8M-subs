able to get your drink and this goes in
and<00:03:39.489> out<00:03:39.670> so<00:03:40.390> you<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.720> adjust<00:03:41.050> that<00:03:41.110> to

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410 
and out so you can adjust that to

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:44.610 
and out so you can adjust that to
whatever<00:03:41.560> size<00:03:42.780> drink<00:03:43.780> that<00:03:43.900> you<00:03:44.050> are

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
consuming at the time and now we need to

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:59.790 
consuming at the time and now we need to
go<00:03:51.519> ahead<00:03:51.640> and<00:03:52.590> get<00:03:53.590> some<00:03:53.800> more<00:03:54.010> velcro<00:03:58.620> so<00:03:59.620> we

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 
go ahead and get some more velcro so we

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.259 
go ahead and get some more velcro so we
need<00:03:59.980> to<00:04:00.160> the<00:04:00.940> hook<00:04:01.150> park<00:04:02.310> back<00:04:03.310> here<00:04:03.760> we'll<00:04:04.120> do

00:04:04.259 --> 00:04:04.269 
need to the hook park back here we'll do

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:05.490 
need to the hook park back here we'll do
the<00:04:04.360> same<00:04:04.570> thing<00:04:04.810> as<00:04:04.930> we<00:04:05.050> did<00:04:05.080> on<00:04:05.350> the<00:04:05.380> other

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
the same thing as we did on the other

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.860 
the same thing as we did on the other
side

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870 

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:16.890 

so<00:04:11.800> I<00:04:11.860> can<00:04:12.069> get<00:04:12.250> that<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:15.269> got<00:04:16.269> big<00:04:16.449> clumpy

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
so I can get that I got big clumpy

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.180 
so I can get that I got big clumpy
fingers

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:19.190 
fingers

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:22.740 
fingers
and<00:04:19.700> we'll<00:04:19.910> line<00:04:20.120> that<00:04:20.330> up<00:04:20.360> with<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.690> edge

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
and we'll line that up with the edge

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.050 
and we'll line that up with the edge
depress<00:04:23.750> a<00:04:23.780> little<00:04:24.200> bit<00:04:24.380> there<00:04:27.730> the<00:04:28.730> same

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
depress a little bit there the same

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:39.770 
depress a little bit there the same
thing<00:04:30.790> this<00:04:31.790> side

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.269 

get<00:04:40.780> it

00:04:42.269 --> 00:04:42.279 
get it

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:48.340 
get it
and<00:04:42.939> up

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:48.350 

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.950 

I'm<00:04:48.890> very<00:04:49.340> careful<00:04:49.820> because<00:04:50.300> it's<00:04:50.690> really

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
I'm very careful because it's really

00:04:50.960 --> 00:05:00.430 
I'm very careful because it's really
really<00:04:51.260> tacky<00:04:56.470> just<00:04:57.550> press<00:04:58.550> that<00:04:58.580> down<00:04:59.440> there

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:00.440 
really tacky just press that down there

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:03.430 
really tacky just press that down there
like<00:05:00.650> that<00:05:00.950> a<00:05:01.630> little<00:05:02.630> edge<00:05:02.780> there<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.290> we'll

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:03.440 
like that a little edge there so we'll

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.060 
like that a little edge there so we'll
go<00:05:03.620> ahead<00:05:03.710> and<00:05:03.830> trim<00:05:04.100> that<00:05:04.310> off<00:05:05.710> the<00:05:06.710> bottom

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
go ahead and trim that off the bottom

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:10.900 
go ahead and trim that off the bottom
part<00:05:08.350> will<00:05:09.350> be<00:05:09.470> like<00:05:09.650> this<00:05:09.830> when<00:05:10.070> you're<00:05:10.250> when

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:10.910

part will be like this when you're when
you're<00:05:10.940> riding<00:05:11.270> when<00:05:11.960> you<00:05:12.050> pop<00:05:12.290> it<00:05:12.410> up<00:05:12.500> it'll

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:12.680 
you're riding when you pop it up it'll

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:19.560 
you're riding when you pop it up it'll
be<00:05:12.830> like<00:05:13.010> this<00:05:13.250> so<00:05:15.490> now<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.550> next<00:05:16.940> thing<00:05:17.060> to<00:05:17.120> do

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.890 

this<00:05:20.570> with<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:22.360> Brooklyn<00:05:23.360> rider<00:05:23.540> stop

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:28.270 
this with the Brooklyn rider stop
coaster<00:05:25.810> and<00:05:26.810> what<00:05:27.050> we'll<00:05:27.200> do<00:05:27.410> we'll<00:05:27.950> put<00:05:28.160> the

smooth side

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.470 
smooth side
on<00:05:30.600> this<00:05:30.840> one<00:05:31.050> I<00:05:31.820> don't<00:05:32.820> think<00:05:32.940> we'll<00:05:33.210> go<00:05:33.360> ahead

00:05:33.470 --> 00:05:33.480 
on this one I don't think we'll go ahead

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:40.070 
on this one I don't think we'll go ahead
and<00:05:33.630> take<00:05:33.990> these<00:05:34.290> off<00:05:35.330> so<00:05:38.570> make<00:05:39.570> sure<00:05:39.750> we<00:05:39.900> got

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.100 

and<00:05:52.350> will<00:05:52.500> basically<00:05:52.770> do<00:05:53.280> the<00:05:53.750> same<00:05:54.750> thing

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110 
and will basically do the same thing

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:02.060 
and will basically do the same thing
here

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.070 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:07.210 

you<00:06:02.790> tell<00:06:03.060> us<00:06:03.090> a<00:06:03.270> little<00:06:03.300> bit<00:06:03.540> wider<00:06:05.600> than<00:06:06.600> the

00:06:07.210 --> 00:06:07.220 
you tell us a little bit wider than the

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:16.230

this

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:19.890 

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:22.130 

it's<00:06:20.340> my<00:06:20.640> offset<00:06:21.060> problems<00:06:21.630> taking<00:06:22.020> this

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:22.140 
it's my offset problems taking this

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:26.630 
it's my offset problems taking this
velcro<00:06:22.560> off<00:06:23.390> the<00:06:24.390> back<00:06:24.600> I<00:06:25.080> think<00:06:25.860> sometimes<00:06:26.490> I
