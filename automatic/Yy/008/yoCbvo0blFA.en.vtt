00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:03.370
 you have to travel with this is not because 

00:00:01.960 --> 00:00:05.890
 is very good today here uruguay 

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.470
 and welcome and gentlemen with you 

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.510
 record with you my little monkeys in 

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:13.570
 subscribers of something that's good that 

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:15.519
 I realized that many people even though 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.199
 I had complained there were several complaints 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:18.789
 more than in the forums in the comments 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.380
 is going to talk about what is more expensive of my clan 

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:23.230
 the ether plan if they do not know how to do 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.779
 some a few weeks ago a month ago 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.850
 maybe I do not know how long we've been 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:29.680
 but good some time ago very ago 

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:31.930
 shortly I made a clan and claim 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:33.460
 challenge 'to get people out of you 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.620
 of my writers and would put more 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.930
 speak and well many people complained 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.579
 that because the clan that was only for 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.559
 us who would enter through the youtubers 

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.120
 that all that is the plan was nothing more 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.770
 for us and we benefited in 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.600
 nothing the Hispanic community and that I am 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.460
 little because I want to benefit and not 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.440
 I do nothing to make myself good blah blah blah 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.090
 blah blah I'm not complaining about that I'm not 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.950
 saying that the plague is wrong is 

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:56.050
 lie no no I'm not doing nothing no 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:58.149
 I 'm claiming them but I'm 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.590
 I am responding to all that are me 

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.390
 who have been saying so much more than 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.280
 nothing as a representative of the clan I have 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:04.659
 like to defend my little things and you can 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.640
 give an explanation to all of you 

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:08.830
 because they deserve it 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.630
 good mainly for all those 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:12.790
 that they left with that a little we are going to 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.409
 say like that angry sad and 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:16.450
 disappointed something like that because 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.610
 they did not enter the clan and yes if not any 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.080
 It was my mistake but very loaded because 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.240
 because of a date the limit of 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.950
 a lot of time does not believe that so many people 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.420
 out to participate I do not think it was going to 

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.360
 be so unruly all the board 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:30.340
 then yes there certainly was not my fault 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:33.940
 organize things well I put a date 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.380
 Diego will reserve the rc very soon and 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.850
 I know that I leave many people without an opportunity 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.740
 but nevertheless what I always say 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.050
 is that if you have the potential 

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:42.369
 necessary to do something and you can not 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.050
 do it the first one eventually you go 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.490
 to achieve then is something that as 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.080
 that to motivate you is that you do not 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.100
 they entered the clan because in the 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.539
 next claim chavismo and 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:51.130
 possibly do if you have 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.020
 They feel so sure of yourself 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:54.850
 now after what I really want 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.800
 go that is to help the Hispanic community 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.780
 many people say that I am like what 

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.759
 hypocritical because good because you 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.140
 they know how much I fuck the community 

00:02:00.759 --> 00:02:05.350
 Hispanic to improve so that 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:07.450
 prove to be the best that the one that 

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:09.640
 the gringa no I do not want to say that this is 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.720
 like a war because it is not this 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.100
 but it shows that also 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.930
 has part 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.480
 and shoot in this community of zombies in 

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.490
 Overall then as many people 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.960
 complaint that I made a clan and that this 

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:21.430
 clan at the end of the day is only for 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.490
 what we take out we 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.990
 let's say we did not do anything with this 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:28.150
 dlc that all the information we're going 

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.010
 pulling from the isstech of barry we the 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.260
 we were not we shared it the 

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:33.340
 speak good there's something I want to talk about something 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.700
 with you and I want to know your opinion 

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.380
 sir is very sincere opinion there is this in 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.660
 As to what we did, it looks like third 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.970
 dlc if not some was not right not 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.110
 it was what the community expected because 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:45.880
 well I imagine that the community 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.500
 I hoped that for example I do not know all the 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.360
 clan among us as we passed 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:52.360
 information and some of us pass them 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.620
 information you undoubtedly I know I know 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.790
 that what you expected 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.200
 but we can not do that 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.450
 mainly because with a lot 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.580
 disorganization maybe not so much inside 

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.680
 of the clan but yes yes what to do or 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:03.970
 whatever we can do they have to 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:05.770
 understand gentlemen that the first one is that 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:07.390
 the plan acted as a team that was the 

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:08.920
 first time that as the clan entered 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.330
 in action you could say then no 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.460
 we are not even well organized not 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.080
 we know each other well this was the first 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.420
 Once we were looking for an easter egg, it was the 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.160
 first time we had over 48 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.100
 hours stuck to the xbox 

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.910
 it was difficult for us however 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.730
 it only served us as that of 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.880
 practice was like that one thing 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.260
 it seemed like a workout something that's what 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:30.850
 next and well then we want 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.800
 put the batteries to what would be the 

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.420
 ecce room and we want to use the 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.770
 potential that we have in the plan I 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.780
 I want to use the potential that the 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:39.190
 clan to help not only us not 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:40.270
 only the people who are in the plan 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:42.880
 but also help all of you 

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:45.160
 so I have to confess that 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.210
 when I created the clear when I when 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:48.370
 I came up with the good idea when 

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:50.740
 ulises told me about creating this plan 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.200
 I said I want this clan to be for the 

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:54.760
 Hispanic community what is in you for 

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.770
 the English community this was like that 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:59.050
 my goal is not to say that I want to do 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.060
 As angy, I do not say that I admire in you 

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:03.190
 that the threads and lola throne something like that 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.770
 I just want the Hispanic website 

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:07.600
 to feel that the ether clan is something for 

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.340
 that is supporting them on the planet 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:10.630
 this information will always be in 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:14.140
 which the Hispanic community can 

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:16.060
 trust and know that as only the 

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:17.440
 let's share with all of you but 

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.900
 Well obviously this was not the best 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.250
 example that we saw with the third dlc without 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.500
 But that is what I want to ask you 

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:24.760
 what do they want us to do for the room 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.910
 lc 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.050
 obviously the room for the fourth 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.120
 we want to try a lot more 

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:33.010
 organization this we already know ourselves better 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.750
 there is going to be a lot better 

00:04:33.010 --> 00:04:37.600
 good performance at least I hope 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.910
 so what do you want the clan 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.490
 do to help the community there 

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.410
 several options many good there's no like 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.900
 two or three bosses but they are several I 

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:48.190
 is from one of them gentlemen that is the one 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.900
 I have never wanted to do but if 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.730
 you ask me what I'm going to do is 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.470
 do what they do hits and not for 

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:55.000
 copy them not as I said no 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:56.560
 idolaters I do not want to do as they do not 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:58.180
 is to copy them but what is in you 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.130
 makes you for those who do not know is that 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:02.350
 every time they find progress 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.390
 of interest in anything like that 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.970
 any any little thing make a 

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:09.250
 30 30 second video a minute and what 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.170
 upload to what would be youtube for 

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:13.120
 inform the community of how they are going to 

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:15.160
 tell them what to do and for good to 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.140
 only have saved a progress and 

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:18.820
 be showing your progress then 

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.410
 this is something that many people do not 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.270
 Like me, I do not like it either because 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:25.300
 because for example in it and with the penalty 

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:27.760
 be a map has 27 videos in all 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:30.040
 them 30 seconds a minute 

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:32.800
 to explain all the stress when the 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:33.880
 isr consists of 7 or 8 steps and that is something 

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.800
 that many people do not like obviously 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:37.810
 and then I think it 's a tutorial and 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.640
 together putting all that together but I do not know 

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:40.810
 if a lot of people like that then 

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.730
 you ask me gentlemen for the 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:44.440
 fourth ls I can be without any doubt 

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:48.100
 I can and if you ask me, I'll do it 

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.900
 in recording clips of 30 seconds a minute 

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:51.670
 and tell them not because we did such 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:53.410
 we got to such part and I upload it to 

00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:56.950
 let them know how we are going so they know what 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.180
 do and so they know this that dares that 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:59.770
 all the information to be like that in 

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:01.120
 my channel in the pride channel or in the 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:04.330
 ulises in roberto's and so on 

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.290
 etcetera etcetera then this thing 

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:07.060
 is that I want you to tell me 

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:09.310
 we can do this from the videos we can 

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.980
 do not be for example in the forum in some 

00:06:09.310 --> 00:06:14.320
 post and each one that has each one that has 

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:16.540
 something new updating that post this 

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.920
 can putting them on twitter by 

00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:19.300
 facebook I do not know is that that's what 

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:21.640
 I want you to tell me that you want the 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.770
 clan do what they want us to do for 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.380
 to be able to help them in what would be this 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:29.320
 of the fourth dlc to have a little bit more 

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:30.580
 of advantage against the Hispanic community 

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.230
 as I said I say but against 

00:06:30.580 --> 00:06:33.849
 American as I said this is not a 

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.249
 war simply 

00:06:33.849 --> 00:06:39.669
 to also have a position in what 

00:06:36.249 --> 00:06:40.929
 would this be this community of zombies and 

00:06:39.669 --> 00:06:42.339
 I know that if in the third we had 

00:06:40.929 --> 00:06:44.169
 had a better organization what 

00:06:42.339 --> 00:06:46.089
 we would have discovered before anyone else 

00:06:44.169 --> 00:06:47.559
 I really assure you because even 

00:06:46.089 --> 00:06:49.119
 here among us among the community 

00:06:47.559 --> 00:06:51.279
 Hispanic there were some people who 

00:06:49.119 --> 00:06:53.050
 usually do not say names this 

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:54.459
 as they wanted to save even 

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:56.379
 just for them or even for 

00:06:54.459 --> 00:06:58.360
 her team just for her for herself 

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:00.459
 he wanted to keep things going more 

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.229
 forward that absolutely everyone 

00:07:00.459 --> 00:07:04.589
 but in the end it stays 

00:07:02.229 --> 00:07:07.240
 stagnated this person in this step and 

00:07:04.589 --> 00:07:08.769
 that's why I think that I do not 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:10.059
 we discovered first though I think that 

00:07:08.769 --> 00:07:11.519
 if this person had told us and 

00:07:10.059 --> 00:07:13.629
 we said it to you 

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:15.639
 we could have won then what 

00:07:13.629 --> 00:07:17.319
 I want to make amends, you can say 

00:07:15.639 --> 00:07:19.599
 is to send this is well said as well as 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:21.639
 correct I have no idea but good is what 

00:07:19.599 --> 00:07:23.289
 that I want to try on the next ls to 

00:07:21.639 --> 00:07:25.449
 see if and if we all join 

00:07:23.289 --> 00:07:27.610
 it is possible to do the first ones then 

00:07:25.449 --> 00:07:29.919
 Well, I need a lot of help from your 

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:31.929

00:07:29.919 --> 00:07:33.669

00:07:31.929 --> 00:07:35.529
 after nations but that help me is 

00:07:33.669 --> 00:07:37.360
 because they comment below and well, I hope 

00:07:35.529 --> 00:07:38.709
 let's find a solution to this and then 

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:40.269
 nothing would be all gentlemen so it 

00:07:38.709 --> 00:07:41.249
