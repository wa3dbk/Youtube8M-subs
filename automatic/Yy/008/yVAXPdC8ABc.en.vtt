they're<00:01:06.200> just<00:01:06.380> words<00:01:06.649> that<00:01:06.860> you<00:01:07.070> wouldn't

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:07.310 
they're just words that you wouldn't

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.679

across<00:01:10.549> so<00:01:10.759> you<00:01:11.030> may<00:01:11.180> use<00:01:11.390> a<00:01:11.420> word<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:12.439> may

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:12.799 
across so you may use a word that may

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:14.530 
across so you may use a word that may
not<00:01:12.979> be<00:01:13.040> the<00:01:13.130> most<00:01:13.310> appropriate<00:01:13.490> but<00:01:14.240> it

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
not be the most appropriate but it

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:17.370 
not be the most appropriate but it
delivers<00:01:14.810> the<00:01:15.170> message<00:01:15.320> but<00:01:16.039> I<00:01:16.310> gotta<00:01:16.549> relax

delivers the message but I gotta relax

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.510 
delivers the message but I gotta relax
rethink<00:01:18.380> about<00:01:18.469> something<00:01:19.100> else<00:01:19.250> that<00:01:19.430> means

I thought about it as so on it's really

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.300 
I thought about it as so on it's really
amazing<00:02:07.189> to<00:02:07.579> get<00:02:07.909> that<00:02:08.030> feeling<00:02:08.240> from<00:02:08.420> a<00:02:08.599> day

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
amazing to get that feeling from a day

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.850 
amazing to get that feeling from a day
yeah<00:02:10.310> it<00:02:10.489> just<00:02:10.549> feels<00:02:10.879> like<00:02:11.060> magic<00:02:11.680> you<00:02:12.680> kind

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
yeah it just feels like magic you kind

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:14.289 
yeah it just feels like magic you kind
of<00:02:12.950> like<00:02:13.099> step<00:02:13.310> off<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.519> stage<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.030> just

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
of like step off that stage you just

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:17.350 
of like step off that stage you just
like<00:02:14.480> I<00:02:14.950> like<00:02:15.950> the<00:02:16.250> time<00:02:16.610> traveled<00:02:17.120> for<00:02:17.329> a

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
like I like the time traveled for a

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.720 
like I like the time traveled for a
second<00:02:17.689> because<00:02:17.780> it's<00:02:18.019> so<00:02:18.230> like<00:02:18.799> just<00:02:19.430> takes

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
second because it's so like just takes

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:21.850 
second because it's so like just takes
your<00:02:19.939> whole<00:02:20.299> mindset<00:02:20.780> away<00:02:21.319> from<00:02:21.620> like

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 
your whole mindset away from like

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.190 
your whole mindset away from like
reality<00:02:22.849> for<00:02:23.299> a<00:02:23.360> second<00:02:23.659> I<00:02:23.720> think<00:02:23.900> that's<00:02:24.049> why

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
reality for a second I think that's why

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.800 
reality for a second I think that's why
everyone<00:02:24.709> and<00:02:24.950> it's<00:02:25.459> so<00:02:25.760> enamored<00:02:26.299> by<00:02:26.359> dance

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:26.810 
everyone and it's so enamored by dance

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.240 
everyone and it's so enamored by dance
because<00:02:27.140> it's<00:02:27.319> like<00:02:27.439> the<00:02:27.560> one<00:02:27.680> thing<00:02:27.739> we<00:02:28.069> can

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:28.250 
because it's like the one thing we can

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.149 
because it's like the one thing we can
like<00:02:28.400> have<00:02:29.000> we<00:02:29.420> kind<00:02:29.569> of<00:02:29.599> magic<00:02:30.140> we<00:02:30.170> can<00:02:30.829> create

00:02:31.149 --> 00:02:31.159
