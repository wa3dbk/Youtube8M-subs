00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
foreground and background so you can

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.650

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.680 
original game it just it never gets old
but<00:02:56.250> because<00:02:56.579> it's<00:02:56.730> so<00:02:56.849> much<00:02:56.970> fun<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.420> switch

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.569 
but because it's so much fun to switch
on<00:02:57.870> the<00:02:57.989> fly<00:02:58.200> and<00:02:58.530> because<00:02:59.129> the<00:02:59.250> design<00:02:59.549> is

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579
