create<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> calorie<00:00:27.570> deficit<00:00:28.200> meaning<00:00:29.039> you

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
create a calorie deficit meaning you

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.609 
create a calorie deficit meaning you
have<00:00:29.520> to<00:00:29.699> consume<00:00:30.180> less<00:00:30.570> calories<00:00:31.289> than<00:00:31.320> you

use and that means being below your

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.570 
use and that means being below your
calorie<00:00:34.110> maintenance<00:00:34.199> level<00:00:34.710> doing<00:00:35.370> this

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:35.580 
calorie maintenance level doing this

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.400 
calorie maintenance level doing this
will<00:00:35.760> force<00:00:36.000> your<00:00:36.180> body<00:00:36.390> to<00:00:36.629> burn<00:00:36.930> your<00:00:37.230> own

stored body fat for energy instead of

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.350 
stored body fat for energy instead of
burning<00:00:39.989> excess<00:00:40.559> calories<00:00:40.860> so<00:00:41.550> how<00:00:42.150> do<00:00:42.210> you
