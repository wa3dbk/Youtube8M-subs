00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
and then track their progress as they

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.740

not<00:01:39.450> stop<00:01:39.810> there<00:01:40.110> I'd<00:01:40.590> say<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.130> made<00:01:41.520> me<00:01:41.700> work<00:01:42.150> a

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
not stop there I'd say it made me work a

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.630 
not stop there I'd say it made me work a
lot<00:01:42.420> harder<00:01:42.450> in<00:01:42.780> the<00:01:42.869> class<00:01:43.110> because<00:01:43.650> I<00:01:44.040> come

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
lot harder in the class because I come

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.069 
lot harder in the class because I come
in<00:01:44.759> here<00:01:44.939> I<00:01:45.000> see<00:01:45.329> how<00:01:45.479> hard<00:01:45.780> everyone's

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
in here I see how hard everyone's

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:47.690 
in here I see how hard everyone's
working<00:01:46.290> so<00:01:46.890> that<00:01:46.920> makes<00:01:47.250> me<00:01:47.369> want<00:01:47.520> to<00:01:47.549> work

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
working so that makes me want to work

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.460 
working so that makes me want to work
hard<00:01:47.909> in<00:01:48.000> here<00:01:48.299> and<00:01:48.479> I<00:01:48.810> carry<00:01:49.049> that<00:01:49.200> over<00:01:49.259> into

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
hard in here and I carry that over into

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.179 
hard in here and I carry that over into
the<00:01:49.649> classroom<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.430> think<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.820> beneficial<00:01:51.000> to

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
the classroom I think it's beneficial to

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.499 
the classroom I think it's beneficial to
maybe<00:01:53.189> make<00:01:53.520> your<00:01:53.729> overall<00:01:54.210> well-being

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
maybe make your overall well-being

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.810 
maybe make your overall well-being
better<00:01:55.049> and<00:01:55.380> to<00:01:55.770> make<00:01:55.950> you<00:01:56.100> more<00:01:56.280> confident<00:01:56.700> in

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
better and to make you more confident in
