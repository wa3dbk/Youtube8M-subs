00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.130 
like gel is like 5 years old honestly my
cousin<00:03:06.580> gave<00:03:06.670> this<00:03:06.790> to<00:03:06.910> me<00:03:07.030> 5<00:03:07.240> years<00:03:07.450> ago<00:03:07.630> and<00:03:07.930> I

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
cousin gave this to me 5 years ago and I

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.720 
cousin gave this to me 5 years ago and I
just<00:03:08.410> started<00:03:08.740> using<00:03:08.890> it<00:03:09.130> to<00:03:09.280> keep<00:03:09.430> my<00:03:09.610> baby

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.340 
just started using it to keep my baby
his<00:03:10.030> done<00:03:10.180> but<00:03:10.390> I<00:03:10.420> probably<00:03:10.690> shouldn't<00:03:11.080> use<00:03:11.140> it

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
his done but I probably shouldn't use it

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.720 
his done but I probably shouldn't use it
because<00:03:11.440> it<00:03:11.620> makes<00:03:11.770> me<00:03:11.890> break<00:03:12.130> out<00:03:12.280> really<00:03:12.490> bad

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:12.730 
because it makes me break out really bad

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:15.090 
because it makes me break out really bad
