address that coming up in the next

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.180 
address that coming up in the next
segment<00:00:36.870> but<00:00:37.410> this<00:00:37.559> one<00:00:37.739> we're<00:00:37.860> talking<00:00:38.100> about

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
segment but this one we're talking about

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:40.340 
segment but this one we're talking about
high<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.910> low<00:00:39.149> high<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.629> low<00:00:39.750> why<00:00:40.020> we<00:00:40.170> have

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
high and low high and low why we have

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.410 
high and low high and low why we have
oil<00:00:40.680> high<00:00:40.920> right<00:00:41.520> some<00:00:41.790> some<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> might

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
oil high right some some of you might

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.119 
oil high right some some of you might
hit<00:00:42.600> the<00:00:42.719> ball<00:00:42.899> way<00:00:43.140> too<00:00:43.170> high<00:00:43.590> and<00:00:43.860> some<00:00:44.010> of

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
hit the ball way too high and some of

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:47.029 
hit the ball way too high and some of
you<00:00:44.219> might<00:00:44.370> hit<00:00:44.579> it<00:00:44.610> way<00:00:45.120> too<00:00:45.180> low<00:00:45.600> so<00:00:46.039> hitting

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
you might hit it way too low so hitting

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.639 
you might hit it way too low so hitting
you<00:00:47.760> know<00:00:47.850> with<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.120> fault<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.899> hitting<00:00:49.530> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
you know with the fault of hitting the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.670 
you know with the fault of hitting the
ball<00:00:49.860> too<00:00:50.129> high<00:00:50.370> is<00:00:50.820> this<00:00:51.420> a<00:00:51.719> few<00:00:52.020> reasons<00:00:52.230> but

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:52.680 
ball too high is this a few reasons but

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.500 
ball too high is this a few reasons but
just<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.100> concentrate<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.820> a<00:00:53.969> couple<00:00:54.390> is

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
just to concentrate on a couple is

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.020 
just to concentrate on a couple is
probably<00:00:54.960> just<00:00:55.230> an<00:00:55.350> early<00:00:55.710> release<00:00:55.920> when<00:00:56.910> the

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
probably just an early release when the

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.750 
probably just an early release when the
hands<00:00:57.480> get<00:00:57.690> there<00:00:57.899> too<00:00:58.109> quickly<00:00:58.469> your<00:00:59.370> blade

00:00:59.750 --> 00:00:59.760 
hands get there too quickly your blade

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.750 
hands get there too quickly your blade
the<00:01:00.120> face<00:01:00.359> of<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.690> club<00:01:00.930> opens<00:01:01.199> up<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.920> in<00:01:02.640> the

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
the face of the club opens up and in the

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.030 
the face of the club opens up and in the
ball<00:01:02.969> shoots<00:01:03.390> up<00:01:03.570> high<00:01:03.780> and<00:01:04.080> if<00:01:04.589> I<00:01:04.739> show<00:01:04.979> you

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
ball shoots up high and if I show you

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.130 
ball shoots up high and if I show you
just<00:01:05.309> in<00:01:05.460> a<00:01:05.549> quick<00:01:05.790> example<00:01:06.240> here<00:01:06.450> if<00:01:06.780> I<00:01:06.869> put

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
just in a quick example here if I put

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.260 
just in a quick example here if I put
this<00:01:07.290> if<00:01:07.680> this<00:01:07.860> is<00:01:08.010> balls<00:01:08.250> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> ground<00:01:08.760> and

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
this if this is balls on the ground and

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.840 
this if this is balls on the ground and
if<00:01:09.689> I'm<00:01:09.869> hitting<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.860> ball<00:01:11.100> on<00:01:11.340> an<00:01:11.640> upward

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
if I'm hitting the ball on an upward

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.899 
if I'm hitting the ball on an upward
swing<00:01:12.860> ok<00:01:13.860> I'm<00:01:14.159> going<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> hitting<00:01:14.790> the

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
swing ok I'm going to be hitting the

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:16.580 
swing ok I'm going to be hitting the
ball<00:01:15.150> thin<00:01:15.509> or<00:01:15.780> I<00:01:15.810> might<00:01:16.170> get<00:01:16.350> right

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
ball thin or I might get right

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.950 
ball thin or I might get right
underneath<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.310> and<00:01:17.490> it<00:01:18.030> will<00:01:18.420> pull<00:01:18.659> that<00:01:18.900> up

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
underneath it and it will pull that up

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.740 
underneath it and it will pull that up
so<00:01:19.560> this<00:01:19.740> 5-iron<00:01:20.400> has<00:01:20.640> now<00:01:20.820> turned<00:01:20.880> into<00:01:21.330> more

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
so this 5-iron has now turned into more

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.870 
so this 5-iron has now turned into more
of<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.960> 7-iron<00:01:22.590> okay<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:24.150> quick<00:01:24.420> fix<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:25.880 
of a 7-iron okay so a quick fix for this

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.310 
of a 7-iron okay so a quick fix for this
and<00:01:26.880> there's<00:01:27.000> a<00:01:27.060> few<00:01:27.210> fixes<00:01:27.479> to<00:01:27.780> really<00:01:28.080> focus

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
forward ahead of the ball when we are

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.460

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.300 
you want to try these various positions
that<00:01:44.790> yeah<00:01:44.939> we<00:01:45.780> want<00:01:45.990> it<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.110> want<00:01:46.259> to<00:01:46.500> feel<00:01:46.799> the

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
that yeah we want it we want to feel the

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.490 
that yeah we want it we want to feel the
position<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.149> really<00:01:48.479> getting<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.960> body<00:01:49.110> to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
position it's really getting the body to

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.130 
position it's really getting the body to
memorize<00:01:50.009> right<00:01:50.729> where<00:01:51.119> these<00:01:51.329> positions<00:01:51.960> are

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
memorize right where these positions are

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.319 
memorize right where these positions are
right<00:01:52.500> with<00:01:52.920> the<00:01:53.070> hands<00:01:53.460> is<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.790> thing<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.210> if

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
right with the hands is one thing but if

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:56.090 
right with the hands is one thing but if
you're<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.600> moving<00:01:55.049> the<00:01:55.140> body<00:01:55.320> also<00:01:55.710> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
you're not moving the body also and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.590 
you're not moving the body also and
getting<00:01:56.369> that<00:01:56.520> way<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:56.729> the<00:01:56.939> left<00:01:57.149> side<00:01:57.329> it

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
getting that way to the left side it

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.690 
getting that way to the left side it
might<00:01:58.020> not<00:01:58.049> help<00:01:58.380> out<00:01:58.649> a<00:01:58.680> whole<00:01:58.920> lot<00:01:59.100> but<00:01:59.579> we

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
might not help out a whole lot but we

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.160 
might not help out a whole lot but we
get<00:01:59.939> there's<00:02:00.329> always<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.540> few<00:02:00.750> things<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> you

you're into this position we have to go

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:25.229 
you're into this position we have to go
to<00:02:22.180> the<00:02:22.360> extreme<00:02:22.840> to<00:02:23.799> fix<00:02:24.340> it<00:02:24.580> so<00:02:24.849> we<00:02:24.879> need<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:25.239 
to the extreme to fix it so we need to

00:02:25.239 --> 00:02:26.759 
to the extreme to fix it so we need to
kind<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.510> go<00:02:25.629> to<00:02:25.690> the<00:02:25.840> office<00:02:25.959> we<00:02:26.200> only<00:02:26.349> got<00:02:26.409> 30

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
kind of go to the office we only got 30

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.289 
kind of go to the office we only got 30
seconds<00:02:27.250> what<00:02:27.400> about<00:02:27.640> it<00:02:27.819> you're<00:02:27.970> hitting<00:02:28.209> it

00:02:28.289 --> 00:02:28.299 
seconds what about it you're hitting it

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:30.000 
seconds what about it you're hitting it
too<00:02:28.480> low<00:02:28.690> you're<00:02:28.930> hitting<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.349> too<00:02:29.500> low<00:02:29.709> most

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
too low you're hitting it too low most

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.830 
too low you're hitting it too low most
likely<00:02:30.489> the<00:02:30.640> causes<00:02:31.090> you<00:02:31.239> have<00:02:31.390> a<00:02:31.420> really

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 
likely the causes you have a really

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.869 
likely the causes you have a really
strong<00:02:31.870> grip<00:02:32.470> and<00:02:32.739> I<00:02:32.799> see<00:02:33.040> this<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> lot<00:02:33.400> of

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
strong grip and I see this a lot of

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:35.850 
strong grip and I see this a lot of
times<00:02:34.120> where<00:02:34.420> this<00:02:34.510> left<00:02:34.840> hand<00:02:35.049> is<00:02:35.260> over<00:02:35.650> the

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:35.860 
times where this left hand is over the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:37.380 
times where this left hand is over the
top<00:02:35.890> of<00:02:36.310> the<00:02:36.370> shaft<00:02:36.579> the<00:02:36.790> right<00:02:37.000> hand<00:02:37.269> is

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
top of the shaft the right hand is

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.660 
top of the shaft the right hand is
underneath<00:02:37.750> you're<00:02:38.409> coming<00:02:38.829> down<00:02:39.069> and<00:02:39.340> in<00:02:39.489> and

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:56.060

you're smothering it like that right
okay<00:05:56.540> so<00:05:56.960> so<00:05:57.680> a<00:05:57.710> nice<00:05:57.980> fix<00:05:58.340> is<00:05:58.550> just<00:05:58.820> as<00:05:59.180> the

00:05:59.620 --> 00:05:59.630 
okay so so a nice fix is just as the

00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.900 
okay so so a nice fix is just as the
right<00:05:59.870> arm<00:05:59.900> might<00:06:00.590> get<00:06:00.860> involved<00:06:01.490> too<00:06:01.700> much

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:01.910 
right arm might get involved too much

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.760 
right arm might get involved too much
right-handed<00:06:02.600> players<00:06:02.870> are<00:06:03.140> usually<00:06:03.530> right

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
right-handed players are usually right

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:06.190 
right-handed players are usually right
armed<00:06:04.190> players<00:06:04.910> and<00:06:05.240> stronger<00:06:05.720> here<00:06:05.990> so

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
armed players and stronger here so

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.160 
armed players and stronger here so
they're<00:06:06.380> really<00:06:07.070> pushing<00:06:07.400> that<00:06:07.900> swing<00:06:08.900> with

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:09.170 
they're really pushing that swing with

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:10.930 
they're really pushing that swing with
the<00:06:09.350> right<00:06:09.560> arm<00:06:09.830> instead<00:06:10.220> of<00:06:10.340> using<00:06:10.520> the<00:06:10.670> body

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:10.940 
the right arm instead of using the body

00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:14.500 
the right arm instead of using the body
so<00:06:11.630> I<00:06:11.930> see<00:06:12.440> the<00:06:13.040> right<00:06:13.310> elbow<00:06:13.550> come<00:06:14.090> out<00:06:14.270> like

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:14.510 
so I see the right elbow come out like

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.650 
so I see the right elbow come out like
this<00:06:14.780> and<00:06:15.050> push<00:06:15.680> through<00:06:15.970> try<00:06:16.970> to<00:06:17.030> focus<00:06:17.300> on

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:17.660 
this and push through try to focus on

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:19.930 
this and push through try to focus on
keeping<00:06:17.870> that<00:06:18.110> right<00:06:18.350> elbow<00:06:18.860> towards<00:06:19.520> the<00:06:19.670> hip

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:19.940 
keeping that right elbow towards the hip

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.690 
keeping that right elbow towards the hip
socket<00:06:19.970> as<00:06:20.660> we<00:06:21.440> swing<00:06:21.890> through<00:06:22.310> then

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:22.700 
socket as we swing through then

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:24.490 
socket as we swing through then
