you don't know more Argyle is its kind
of<00:00:07.049> the<00:00:07.290> pattern<00:00:07.830> you<00:00:07.919> might<00:00:08.069> see<00:00:08.189> lots<00:00:08.340> with

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:08.490 
of the pattern you might see lots with

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.820 
of the pattern you might see lots with
golf<00:00:08.700> is<00:00:08.880> wearing<00:00:09.330> and<00:00:09.510> Pringle<00:00:10.380> clothing

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
golf is wearing and Pringle clothing

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.549 
golf is wearing and Pringle clothing
also<00:00:11.040> uses<00:00:11.400> it<00:00:11.550> on<00:00:11.639> lots<00:00:11.880> of<00:00:12.000> their<00:00:12.210> clothes<00:00:12.559> so

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:13.559 
also uses it on lots of their clothes so

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.369 
also uses it on lots of their clothes so
that's<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> finished<00:00:14.130> design<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:15.289> so<00:00:16.289> i'll

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:16.379 
that's the finished design and so i'll

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.040 
that's the finished design and so i'll
just<00:00:16.410> show<00:00:16.800> you<00:00:16.830> how<00:00:17.609> I<00:00:17.640> did<00:00:17.789> that<00:00:17.940> so<00:00:18.930> the

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
just show you how I did that so the

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.529 
just show you how I did that so the
first<00:00:19.260> thing<00:00:19.380> I've<00:00:19.619> done<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:20.220> painted<00:00:21.090> all<00:00:21.270> my

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
first thing I've done is painted all my

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.779 
first thing I've done is painted all my
nails<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:22.140> revlon's<00:00:22.830> lilac<00:00:23.400> past<00:00:23.699> all<00:00:24.080> and

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:25.789 
nails in revlon's lilac past all and

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:30.140 
nails in revlon's lilac past all and
then<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:26.939> next<00:00:26.970> thing<00:00:27.269> to<00:00:27.570> do<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:28.640> the<00:00:29.640> two

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
then the next thing to do is the two

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:31.999 
then the next thing to do is the two
triangles<00:00:30.689> either<00:00:30.869> side<00:00:31.170> so<00:00:31.529> I've<00:00:31.650> grabbed

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
triangles either side so I've grabbed

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.840 
triangles either side so I've grabbed
the<00:00:32.640> kind<00:00:32.880> of<00:00:32.969> movie<00:00:33.270> purple<00:00:34.160> I'm<00:00:35.160> going<00:00:35.790> to

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
the kind of movie purple I'm going to

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.639 
the kind of movie purple I'm going to
use<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> brush<00:00:36.420> part<00:00:36.809> of<00:00:36.930> the<00:00:37.020> nail<00:00:37.170> art<00:00:37.440> pen

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
use the brush part of the nail art pen

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:51.540 
use the brush part of the nail art pen
and<00:00:38.690> create<00:00:39.690> a<00:00:39.870> cross<00:00:39.899> on<00:00:40.710> my<00:00:40.969> nail

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:51.550 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.270 

just<00:00:52.239> like<00:00:52.450> that<00:00:52.719> and<00:00:52.989> so<00:00:53.620> it's<00:00:53.739> divided<00:00:54.160> the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
just like that and so it's divided the

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.630 
just like that and so it's divided the
nail<00:00:54.460> into<00:00:54.820> four<00:00:55.410> triangles<00:00:56.410> so<00:00:57.250> you<00:00:57.309> want<00:00:57.489> to

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
nail into four triangles so you want to

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.240 
nail into four triangles so you want to
fill<00:00:57.850> in<00:00:58.030> the<00:00:58.809> two<00:00:58.989> triangles<00:00:59.620> either<00:00:59.920> side<00:01:00.220> of

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
fill in the two triangles either side of

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:06.960 
fill in the two triangles either side of
your<00:01:00.579> nail<00:01:04.710> so<00:01:05.710> I<00:01:05.740> found<00:01:06.070> that<00:01:06.280> this<00:01:06.430> nail<00:01:06.760> art

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:06.970 
your nail so I found that this nail art

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.290 
your nail so I found that this nail art
design<00:01:07.300> works<00:01:07.600> best<00:01:08.280> with<00:01:09.280> a<00:01:09.310> more<00:01:09.610> square

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:10.300 
design works best with a more square

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:13.890 
design works best with a more square
nail<00:01:10.780> either<00:01:11.290> square<00:01:11.530> or<00:01:11.680> squirrel<00:01:12.900> just

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
nail either square or squirrel just

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.390 
nail either square or squirrel just
because<00:01:14.140> it<00:01:14.229> makes<00:01:14.259> it<00:01:14.560> look<00:01:14.650> at<00:01:14.830> slightly

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:15.400 
because it makes it look at slightly

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:32.360 
because it makes it look at slightly
more<00:01:15.580> even<00:01:16.000> than<00:01:16.479> a<00:01:16.540> rounded<00:01:17.050> nail

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:32.370 

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.480 

okay<00:01:33.030> so<00:01:33.090> once<00:01:33.480> you<00:01:33.630> filled<00:01:33.870> that<00:01:33.960> in<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.530> got

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
okay so once you filled that in and got

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.760 
okay so once you filled that in and got
your<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:35.790> triangles<00:01:36.510> either<00:01:36.750> side<00:01:37.200> making

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
your two triangles either side making

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.520 
your two triangles either side making
sure<00:01:38.010> that<00:01:38.220> they<00:01:38.340> meet<00:01:38.610> in<00:01:38.940> the<00:01:39.120> middle<00:01:39.530> you

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
sure that they meet in the middle you

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.820 
sure that they meet in the middle you
want<00:01:40.740> to<00:01:40.980> create<00:01:41.460> the<00:01:41.610> diamond<00:01:42.260> so<00:01:43.260> for<00:01:43.740> that

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:43.830 
want to create the diamond so for that

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.600 
want to create the diamond so for that
I've<00:01:44.190> used<00:01:44.460> a<00:01:44.760> kind<00:01:45.210> of<00:01:45.300> brighter<00:01:45.630> purple<00:01:46.610> it's

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:47.610 
I've used a kind of brighter purple it's

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
want to grab a gem to stick in the

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.980 
want to grab a gem to stick in the
middle<00:02:30.400> now<00:02:31.400> i'm<00:02:31.550> using<00:02:31.580> a<00:02:32.120> purple<00:02:32.540> gem<00:02:32.750> you

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
middle now i'm using a purple gem you

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.559 
middle now i'm using a purple gem you
can<00:02:33.140> use<00:02:33.260> whatever<00:02:33.380> color<00:02:33.740> you<00:02:33.890> like<00:02:34.480> but<00:02:35.480> you

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:39.459 
want it to be kind of a smaller size gem

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:43.960 
want it to be kind of a smaller size gem
so<00:02:40.459> it<00:02:40.580> doesn't<00:02:40.880> look<00:02:40.970> too<00:02:41.180> out<00:02:41.360> of<00:02:41.390> place<00:02:42.970> you

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:46.040 
just want to stick it where the two

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.940 
just want to stick it where the two

triangles me once you've done that let

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:50.290 
triangles me once you've done that let
it<00:02:49.100> dry<00:02:49.280> for<00:02:49.310> a<00:02:49.520> few<00:02:49.550> minutes<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.090> then<00:02:50.209> you
