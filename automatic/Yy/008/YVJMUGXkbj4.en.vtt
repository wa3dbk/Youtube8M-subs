00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:13.060 
have some headphones that the base is a

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.530 
have some headphones that the base is a
little<00:04:13.600> bit<00:04:13.750> like<00:04:14.020> sloppy<00:04:14.970> at<00:04:15.970> they're<00:04:16.299> fun<00:04:16.510> to

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
little bit like sloppy at they're fun to

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:19.140 
little bit like sloppy at they're fun to
listen<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:16.989> but<00:04:17.400> these<00:04:18.400> ones<00:04:18.700> just<00:04:18.880> sound

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
listen to but these ones just sound

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:21.360 
listen to but these ones just sound
really<00:04:19.510> nice<00:04:19.660> with<00:04:19.959> how<00:04:20.290> clean<00:04:20.590> the<00:04:20.769> bases<00:04:21.220> and

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:21.370 
really nice with how clean the bases and

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:25.860 
really nice with how clean the bases and
it's<00:04:21.489> just<00:04:21.669> really<00:04:21.730> sharp<00:04:22.240> and<00:04:22.510> stuff<00:04:24.390> so<00:04:25.390> I<00:04:25.450> i

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
it's just really sharp and stuff so I i

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.920 
it's just really sharp and stuff so I i
guess<00:04:26.140> i<00:04:26.260> would<00:04:26.320> prefer<00:04:26.560> these<00:04:26.919> over<00:04:27.750> no<00:04:28.750> kind

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
guess i would prefer these over no kind

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:33.510 
guess i would prefer these over no kind
of<00:04:29.020> messy<00:04:29.380> base<00:04:30.900> it<00:04:31.900> still<00:04:32.800> is<00:04:33.160> still<00:04:33.400> pretty
