00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:07.660
 ah 

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.960
 hi how about friends in this video 

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.060
 I'm going to teach how we can simulate the 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.610
 super instinct killer fire 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.619
 nintendo on our android device 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:25.689
 all we have to do is 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:28.060
 direct us to the two links that I will leave 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:31.150
 in the description of the video which 

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.940
 they're going to link to a mega account and 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.579
 they give in download once this is done 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.739
 they will leave these two folders the 

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:40.930
 which are in sevens format and what 

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.500
 only thing that we have to do is click 

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 right to extract here 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.750
 already extracting the will leave us these two 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.239
 folders one contains the emulator and the 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:53.250
 another game killer instinct the 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.050
 we go to what is our device 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.910
 android only we give in copy 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:03.040
 I do not do it because I already have them 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:05.489
 I have already done this we went to what is 

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.189
 our android device 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.979
 and with any file manager in my 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.020
 case he is we are looking for what is the folder 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.179
 of the emulator 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:17.250
 I actually in the emulator folder 

00:01:15.179 --> 00:01:20.670
 I have the killer game itself and the 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:25.039
 applied in the application we select it and 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.039
 we give the following install 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.150
 we give in open 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:38.250
 and this application 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:42.720
 to search our games in 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:45.030
 automatic can be deposited either in 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.670
 your external card or in my case in the 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:51.080
 internal memory of the phone only 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.080
 we give in to enter the game 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:58.170
 let's make this screen bigger 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.709
 in fact this application I tried it in a 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:17.120
 device with 800 megabytes of processor 

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:20.110
 so almost on any device it 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.110
 can emulate well 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.930
 ah 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:41.200

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.660
 application and this wonderful game does not 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:46.420
