don't know if you can really see the

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:17.589 
don't know if you can really see the
marbled<00:03:15.859> effect<00:03:16.069> on<00:03:16.549> the<00:03:16.700> paper<00:03:16.909> in<00:03:17.180> real<00:03:17.389> life

00:03:17.589 --> 00:03:17.599 
marbled effect on the paper in real life

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.259 
marbled effect on the paper in real life
it<00:03:17.840> is<00:03:17.989> fantastic<00:03:18.379> and<00:03:19.220> I'll<00:03:19.819> do<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.030> project

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:20.269 
it is fantastic and I'll do a project

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:21.729 
it is fantastic and I'll do a project
with<00:03:20.510> this<00:03:20.750> and<00:03:20.930> post<00:03:21.049> it<00:03:21.260> so<00:03:21.439> you'll<00:03:21.590> be<00:03:21.709> able

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
with this and post it so you'll be able

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.500 
with this and post it so you'll be able
to<00:03:21.889> see<00:03:22.099> it<00:03:22.190> but<00:03:22.340> you<00:03:22.730> get<00:03:22.849> a<00:03:22.910> marbling<00:03:23.449> effect

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
to see it but you get a marbling effect

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:26.530 
to see it but you get a marbling effect
now<00:03:24.230> I<00:03:24.260> did<00:03:24.470> the<00:03:24.620> same<00:03:24.889> technique<00:03:25.639> exactly<00:03:26.329> and

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
now I did the same technique exactly and

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.020 
now I did the same technique exactly and
on<00:03:27.079> the<00:03:27.290> glossy<00:03:27.650> paper<00:03:27.859> but<00:03:28.160> I<00:03:28.190> did<00:03:28.489> not<00:03:28.699> add

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.030 
on the glossy paper but I did not add

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:31.300 
on the glossy paper but I did not add
the<00:03:29.329> potion<00:03:29.690> number<00:03:29.810> nine<00:03:30.109> so<00:03:30.709> I<00:03:30.739> didn't<00:03:31.190> get

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
the potion number nine so I didn't get

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.909 
the potion number nine so I didn't get
that<00:03:31.370> nice<00:03:31.819> water<00:03:32.239> coloring<00:03:32.959> Marbley<00:03:33.530> look<00:03:33.739> I

00:03:33.909 --> 00:03:33.919 
that nice water coloring Marbley look I

00:03:33.919 --> 00:03:36.789 
that nice water coloring Marbley look I
got<00:03:34.310> a<00:03:34.340> nice<00:03:34.669> shiny<00:03:35.090> mood<00:03:35.389> look<00:03:35.750> and<00:03:36.019> I<00:03:36.470> did<00:03:36.680> get

00:03:36.789 --> 00:03:36.799 
got a nice shiny mood look and I did get

00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:38.439 
got a nice shiny mood look and I did get
some<00:03:37.040> movement<00:03:37.220> in<00:03:37.579> it<00:03:37.730> because<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.180> it<00:03:38.389> being

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:38.449 
some movement in it because of it being

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:41.080 
some movement in it because of it being
water-based<00:03:39.139> and<00:03:39.409> on<00:03:39.859> the<00:03:39.980> glossy<00:03:40.190> paper<00:03:40.549> but

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
water-based and on the glossy paper but

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.839 
water-based and on the glossy paper but
I<00:03:41.120> didn't<00:03:41.510> get<00:03:41.659> that<00:03:41.720> really<00:03:42.079> cool<00:03:42.849> marble

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:43.849 
I didn't get that really cool marble

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:45.670 
I didn't get that really cool marble
effect<00:03:44.120> so<00:03:44.870> that's<00:03:45.079> two<00:03:45.349> different

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:45.680 
effect so that's two different

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:47.770 
effect so that's two different
techniques<00:03:45.859> right<00:03:46.220> there<00:03:46.489> then<00:03:47.150> again<00:03:47.299> I<00:03:47.540> said

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
techniques right there then again I said

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.270 
techniques right there then again I said
I<00:03:47.810> would<00:03:48.019> do<00:03:48.109> it<00:03:48.199> on<00:03:48.290> regular<00:03:48.590> cardstock<00:03:48.919> which

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:49.280 
I would do it on regular cardstock which

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.830 
I would do it on regular cardstock which
I<00:03:49.430> did<00:03:49.609> now<00:03:49.790> in<00:03:49.909> this<00:03:50.000> one<00:03:50.239> you<00:03:50.269> do<00:03:50.569> get<00:03:50.810> a

00:03:50.830 --> 00:03:50.840 
I did now in this one you do get a

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.229 
I did now in this one you do get a
little<00:03:50.989> bit<00:03:51.229> of<00:03:51.260> glimmer<00:03:51.669> but<00:03:52.669> it's<00:03:52.879> a<00:03:53.000> matte

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
little bit of glimmer but it's a matte

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:55.719 
little bit of glimmer but it's a matte
finish<00:03:53.269> so<00:03:54.260> if<00:03:54.500> you're<00:03:54.650> not<00:03:54.739> too<00:03:55.010> into<00:03:55.250> glossy

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:55.729 
finish so if you're not too into glossy

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:57.430 
finish so if you're not too into glossy
and<00:03:55.940> if<00:03:56.269> you<00:03:56.389> were<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.569> stamp<00:03:56.900> an<00:03:57.049> image<00:03:57.319> on

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
and if you were to stamp an image on

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.110 
and if you were to stamp an image on
here<00:03:57.650> make<00:03:57.799> sure<00:03:57.829> you<00:03:58.190> use<00:03:58.370> stays<00:03:58.699> on<00:03:58.940> it

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
here make sure you use stays on it

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.149 
here make sure you use stays on it
because<00:03:59.540> of<00:03:59.720> it<00:03:59.810> being<00:03:59.840> glossy<00:04:00.409> this<00:04:00.949> one<00:04:01.129> I

00:04:01.149 --> 00:04:01.159 
because of it being glossy this one I

00:04:01.159 --> 00:04:03.670 
because of it being glossy this one I
can<00:04:01.370> use<00:04:01.489> my<00:04:01.519> memento<00:04:02.150> and<00:04:02.180> I'm<00:04:02.389> good<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:02.599> go<00:04:02.720> so

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
then I used my cuttlebug machine I used

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:20.349 
then I used my cuttlebug machine I used
it<00:04:15.949> a<00:04:16.130> play<00:04:16.669> a<00:04:16.940> beat<00:04:17.510> plate<00:04:17.810> paper<00:04:18.530> die<00:04:19.489> and<00:04:19.940> a

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359

seed plate with the die-cutting part

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:25.450 
seed plate with the die-cutting part
down<00:04:23.330> of<00:04:23.539> course<00:04:23.720> on<00:04:23.960> the<00:04:24.169> B<00:04:24.320> plate<00:04:24.560> and<00:04:24.770> ran<00:04:25.280> it

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:25.460 
down of course on the B plate and ran it

00:04:25.460 --> 00:04:27.550 
down of course on the B plate and ran it
through<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:25.940> again<00:04:26.150> what<00:04:27.050> you<00:04:27.200> see<00:04:27.440> is<00:04:27.529> what

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:27.560 
through and again what you see is what

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:29.700 
through and again what you see is what
you<00:04:27.770> get<00:04:28.039> so<00:04:28.310> when<00:04:28.490> this<00:04:28.610> die<00:04:28.849> cut<00:04:28.880> cut<00:04:29.360> out

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
you get so when this die cut cut out

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:32.760 
you get so when this die cut cut out
look<00:04:30.130> at<00:04:30.250> this<00:04:30.430> I<00:04:30.670> get<00:04:31.570> my<00:04:31.720> outline<00:04:32.200> and<00:04:32.470> I<00:04:32.590> get

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:37.510 
this stamp set obviously I could went in

00:04:37.510 --> 00:04:39.900

wings using the memento inks and the
markers<00:04:42.250> i<00:04:42.400> could<00:04:42.580> have<00:04:42.670> spritzed<00:04:43.060> it<00:04:43.150> a

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
markers i could have spritzed it a

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.970 
markers i could have spritzed it a
little<00:04:43.300> bit<00:04:43.450> different<00:04:43.840> but<00:04:44.380> this<00:04:44.590> was<00:04:44.770> just

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
little bit different but this was just

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.250 
little bit different but this was just
one<00:04:45.190> way<00:04:45.370> to<00:04:45.430> make<00:04:45.640> a<00:04:45.700> background<00:04:46.240> there<00:04:47.050> are
