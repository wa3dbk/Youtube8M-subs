00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.230 

I'm<00:01:58.930> running<00:01:59.320> this<00:01:59.500> to<00:01:59.830> Mike<00:02:00.040> he<00:02:00.280> be<00:02:00.430> here<00:02:00.670> with

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.309 

so<00:02:22.400> when<00:02:22.700> you<00:02:22.849> don't<00:02:23.060> touch<00:02:23.780> the<00:02:24.019> park

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 
so when you don't touch the park

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:31.000 
so when you don't touch the park
immediately<00:02:24.859> it'll<00:02:26.560> it<00:02:27.560> will<00:02:27.769> be<00:02:27.890> too<00:02:28.099> late<00:02:30.010> as

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
immediately it'll it will be too late as

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.429 
immediately it'll it will be too late as
the<00:02:31.549> opponents<00:02:32.209> already<00:02:32.510> crowded<00:02:32.840> away<00:02:33.200> from

00:02:33.429 --> 00:02:33.439 
the opponents already crowded away from

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:43.680 
the opponents already crowded away from
you

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:43.690 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.780 

I<00:02:43.720> have<00:02:44.380> to<00:02:44.560> say<00:02:44.740> the<00:02:44.860> graphics<00:02:44.890> is<00:02:45.520> really

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:45.790 
I have to say the graphics is really

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.830 
I have to say the graphics is really
amazing<00:02:46.300> it's<00:02:46.510> AI<00:02:48.120> once<00:02:49.120> you<00:02:49.270> get<00:02:49.480> a<00:02:49.510> hang<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 
amazing it's AI once you get a hang of

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:58.890 
amazing it's AI once you get a hang of
food<00:02:51.180> you<00:02:52.180> can<00:02:52.210> get<00:02:52.720> quite<00:02:53.080> addicting
