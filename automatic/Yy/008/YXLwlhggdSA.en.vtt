printer it's also got on this sad you

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:43.520 
printer it's also got on this sad you
can<00:00:42.360> see<00:00:42.570> which<00:00:42.719> is<00:00:42.870> connected<00:00:43.260> up<00:00:43.350> to<00:00:43.440> the

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
can see which is connected up to the

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.720 
can see which is connected up to the
back<00:00:43.649> of<00:00:43.680> the<00:00:43.800> printers<00:00:44.250> I've<00:00:44.340> just<00:00:44.489> showed

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
back of the printers I've just showed

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.000 
back of the printers I've just showed
you<00:00:44.989> basically<00:00:45.989> an<00:00:46.050> external<00:00:46.530> West<00:00:46.680> chunk<00:00:46.920> it

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
you basically an external West chunk it

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.410 
you basically an external West chunk it
just<00:00:47.129> pumps<00:00:47.280> always<00:00:47.760> think<00:00:48.030> that<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> does

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
just pumps always think that it does

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.569 
just pumps always think that it does
every<00:00:48.629> Sam<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.930> to<00:00:48.989> the<00:00:49.110> head<00:00:49.230> clean<00:00:49.559> into<00:00:50.489> this

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
every Sam it to the head clean into this

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.340 
every Sam it to the head clean into this
tube<00:00:50.879> because<00:00:51.210> eventually<00:00:51.480> these<00:00:51.780> do<00:00:52.050> fill<00:00:52.260> up

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
tube because eventually these do fill up

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.350 
tube because eventually these do fill up
with<00:00:52.440> ink<00:00:52.649> and<00:00:52.890> that<00:00:53.820> will<00:00:53.940> be<00:00:54.030> the<00:00:54.059> end<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.270> it

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
with ink and that will be the end of it

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.880 
with ink and that will be the end of it
serviceable<00:00:54.989> light<00:00:55.170> so<00:00:55.350> it<00:00:55.440> might<00:00:55.559> just<00:00:55.680> be<00:00:55.860> a

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
serviceable light so it might just be a

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.279 
serviceable light so it might just be a
good<00:00:56.039> idea<00:00:56.129> to<00:00:56.370> add<00:00:56.579> an<00:00:57.090> external<00:00:57.660> way<00:00:58.020> I<00:00:58.050> think

00:00:58.279 --> 00:00:58.289 
good idea to add an external way I think

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:02.240 
good idea to add an external way I think
tank<00:00:59.210> and<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.300> continuous<00:01:00.930> continuous<00:01:01.890> ink

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
tank and a continuous continuous ink

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.520 
tank and a continuous continuous ink
system<00:01:02.489> such<00:01:02.850> as<00:01:02.879> i<00:01:03.090> have<00:01:03.270> here<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:04.260> just<00:01:04.439> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
system such as i have here so just to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.960 
system such as i have here so just to
show<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.769> a<00:01:04.860> little<00:01:05.129> bit<00:01:05.250> mob<00:01:05.460> see<00:01:05.790> what's

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:05.970 
show you a little bit mob see what's

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.090 
show you a little bit mob see what's
