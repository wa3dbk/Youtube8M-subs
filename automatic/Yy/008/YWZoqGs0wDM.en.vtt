00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 he said 

00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:04.350
 there is 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.530
 Yes 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:33.340
 first it is important to check 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:35.559
 think why you naturally get a hair 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:37.690
 want to wear and yes it sounds a bit 

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:39.940
 strange but it is very important to 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.650
 just take a moment to reflect 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.110
 if necessary paul a piece of paper grab a 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.970
 pen and wrote down why you chose 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.410
 have hot or you are going to choose for you 

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:49.839
 natural hair 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.670
 This is important because not everyone would 

00:00:49.839 --> 00:00:53.650
 understand why you have this decision 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.570
 taken and you probably will 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.820
 some moments when it gets tough on it 

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.590
 if you understood your hair and I or if you 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.870
 do her things you don't even like 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.430
 Knew that you lost in tomorrow 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.350
 basically somewhere on paper or maybe 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.600
 have placed a telephone somewhere 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.210
 why you chose this it would 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.250
 motivate you and will help you just 

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:15.160
 piece I just point to continue and 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.340
 day after day just ahead of your goal 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.340
 put 

00:01:21.429 --> 00:01:25.600
 step 2 it leaves you now on paper 

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:25.990
 put where it goes i do i think 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.750
 from 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:31.959
 you dumb and deaf ear in this I will do 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:33.940
 step 2 stopped relaxing your hair 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:35.950
 it sounds logical just stop 

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.780
 no longer relax that leaked your hair 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:40.030
 apply otherwise you can of course 

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:43.470
 never for your natural hair like you 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.470
 still no frame in fabric 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:53.090
 as were you then have two options 

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:55.280
 or you are going to relax and pick up 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.770
 a pair of scissors or you pick up a hair clipper and you 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.300
 just keep all your hair off you 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.430
 basically just keeps the piece 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.900
 so where do you grow it 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.780
 bit her way again such a must 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:07.880
 relax that you only love about that 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:11.030
 you could do if you do that then 

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.860
 So you have a chance that you led with whole 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.920
 her left and I mean really 

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:17.780
 Minimum nothing remains so 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 you could do that as your big ball 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.760
 have a mountain 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.980
 then you can certainly do that but if you do yes 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.030
 not so you would in principle also for 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.980
 can choose to leave your hair 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.630
 grow out and that means you 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.459
 simply hood with direct one holds 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.310
 just grow to your desired 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:36.260
 have realized the length and then cut 

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:38.570
 you relax the springs from and on that 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.950
 this way you have a bit of growth 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:42.920
 and then you can do something with your hair 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:51.530
 don't feel like your language or close by 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:54.260
 loop shaslick knowledge is power 

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.810
 the moment you look for information 

00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:58.970
 you fit and you just learn things 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.860
 from other people you can 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.570
 apply it will give you so much drama 

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:03.680
 saving them would save you a lot of money 

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:06.769
 save 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.070
 searching for and looking for a website search 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:11.720
 something and media look on the internet where 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:14.120
 the blog or cream might be one 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.680
 youtube channel so just information on 

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.840
 on course her in the context of 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.970
 knowledge is power trying to be people 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.830
 find in your area or people up 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.570
 internet that also just a bit on 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.350
 have done it or have a hard one 

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.269
 grow out 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:27.530
 find those people and try them 

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.150
 a particular 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:30.920
 yes to have communion cards to 

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:33.320
 see what they apply what they apply 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.970
 use or things that are experienced and 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:36.860
 want and maybe you can get something from them 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.400
 learn and you can simply apply that 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:39.400
 I'm your skin 

00:03:42.159 --> 00:03:47.120
 Hiring you cannot do all of them 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.430
 take it with you and use it in your natural 

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.049
 hair your hair is different than usual 

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:52.969
 respond to those products 

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:55.489
 so purchases must be made in room anyway 

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:59.900
 focus specifically on your natural 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:04:02.659
 her and tim what you could do 

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:04.430
 is if you have people in your area who 

00:04:02.659 --> 00:04:07.090
 all those natural hair people wear 

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:09.530
 who have chosen frizzy attack and 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.150
 try to talk to them about this and 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.280
 see if they wait what products are 

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.290
 do not go directly to the store 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.019
 and don't immediately buy a fools thijs 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:19.519
 packing but ask them or in one 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:22.280
 little marcel 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.259
 had a gel quickly looking for you 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.750
 a good joe for that her question 

00:04:24.259 --> 00:04:28.460
 they do use those gelzen if they use them 

00:04:26.750 --> 00:04:29.449
 and they indicate questions there or in one 

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:32.000
 just a little bit 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:34.430
 and try it on your hair like you 

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.139
 its responding well to that itself then you can 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.389
 you always go to the store and get one 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.580
 Buy full-size packaging before you 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:42.500
 try things out with t 

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:45.470
 and not who has what kind of yoda work there is 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:47.150
 something you shouldn't do and 

00:04:45.470 --> 00:04:49.849
 sounds completely I make myself too 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.770
 watch movies but not too much 

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:54.710
 YouTube videos and all those products 

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:56.590
 people use to invest more in it 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:59.539
 a product that works for you 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.340
 try to invest and take care of it 

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:03.409
 make sure you have long term products 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.720
 basically buy it so that your hair 

00:05:03.409 --> 00:05:08.690
 four weeks to 

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:11.330
 getting used to a product and requires 8 weeks 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:12.680
 has to be able to respond to the 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.009
 show results 

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.690
 so all in all you are 8 weeks busy to 

00:05:16.009 --> 00:05:21.759
 see if a product is indeed 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.759
 is successful or unsuccessful 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:29.790
 it's we know it's a fact 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:32.970
 your hair grows or yes the human to get 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:34.229
 grows on average one to five centimeters 

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:35.760
 per month 

00:05:34.229 --> 00:05:37.680
 it's quite a lot of hair five 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.639
 centimeters is quite a lot 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:42.960
 and that is a fact but it is not with 

00:05:41.639 --> 00:05:44.790
 everyone the same 

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:47.070
 everyone is unique and that means too 

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:48.960
 that your hair is unique my hair is the 

00:05:47.070 --> 00:05:50.729
 mine and you are your it is not 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.810
 identical so it's with everyone 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:54.030
 different 

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.979
 don't be too strict for yourself 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:57.510
 don't set the bar too high for yourself 

00:05:55.979 --> 00:05:59.280
 yourself not too much 

00:05:57.510 --> 00:06:01.560
 do not fool yourself do you make 

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.990
 yourself really not crazy dude related 

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.729
 everyone's hair is something different and with us 

00:06:03.990 --> 00:06:08.250
 it so that our hair in the us I mean 

00:06:05.729 --> 00:06:10.500
 our only amorous wish was it 

00:06:08.250 --> 00:06:12.120
 kriens so extreme at the moment that 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.100
 so it looks like this and you get it and the 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:16.830
 spacious you see the top is called length 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:19.200
 but because it is so claimed here 

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:22.770
 length not so make yourself to that 

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:24.630
 too crazy and 4 as a kind of yes magic 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:27.210
 something that comb your hair bit well and 

00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:29.550
 enjoy it and broad it cost you 

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:31.260
 hair and it made you feel it 

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:35.600
 does not enter or go to war 

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:35.600
 fight but just enjoy costs 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.190
 finds in the context of its products 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.319
 a routine 

00:06:44.190 --> 00:06:49.080
 what works for you if you work for yourself 

00:06:46.319 --> 00:06:51.180
 Have you written down once per 

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:53.340
 month or once a week or once 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:55.560
 wash your hair every two weeks 

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:57.360
 find a simple easy him after 

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:59.699
 what will work for you explains again 

00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.259
 not the late high so you are on one 

00:06:59.699 --> 00:07:02.970
 completely confusing for a given moment 

00:07:01.259 --> 00:07:05.220
 the people who have the idea 

00:07:02.970 --> 00:07:06.419
 wearing frizzy hair so much worked 

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:08.400
 not much work at all 

00:07:06.419 --> 00:07:11.520
 it 's really all based on how 

00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:13.289
 you are going to decorate your jantina 

00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:15.150
 One way in being video is feasible 

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:17.250
 a materialistic look at you 

00:07:15.150 --> 00:07:19.080
 agenda view how many page frame you have 

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:21.330
 and on that basis go your tens 

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:23.789
 make it simple and keep it simple 

00:07:21.330 --> 00:07:25.710
 easy one but sometimes quite 

00:07:23.789 --> 00:07:27.300
 skipping a step is not at all like that 

00:07:25.710 --> 00:07:30.030
 very bad but some make sure you do it 

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:32.370
 idea that you can regularly apply that 

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:34.289
 your hair also knows what arrived and because 

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:41.699
 your hair the yes can also get used to all 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:44.009
 things that currently apply and tips 

00:07:41.699 --> 00:07:45.129
 and advice for when you consider it 

00:07:44.009 --> 00:07:48.699
 around you will like her 

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:51.279
 wear if you hit you have or you have 

00:07:48.699 --> 00:07:53.860
 open tips for yourself and your separate advice 

00:07:51.279 --> 00:07:57.009
 and things that themselves applied there let him 

00:07:53.860 --> 00:07:59.949
 women do not share this video as 

00:07:57.009 --> 00:08:02.589
 know people who will be interesting and 

00:07:59.949 --> 00:08:05.699
 I hope to see you again 

00:08:02.589 --> 00:08:05.699
 thanks for looking and
