of storage but I have to shoot the
board's<00:03:25.000> through<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.330> door<00:03:25.480> because<00:03:25.720> I<00:03:25.930> don't

the<00:03:28.840> chips<00:03:29.080> I<00:03:29.350> had<00:03:30.220> to<00:03:30.370> retire<00:03:30.700> my<00:03:30.730> router

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
the chips I had to retire my router

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.300 
the chips I had to retire my router
table<00:03:31.630> and<00:03:31.750> I<00:03:31.780> built<00:03:32.019> this<00:03:32.200> little<00:03:32.650> tiny<00:03:32.980> one

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
table and I built this little tiny one

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.820 
table and I built this little tiny one
that<00:03:33.340> just<00:03:34.299> gets<00:03:34.630> clamped<00:03:34.930> in<00:03:35.140> my<00:03:35.260> face<00:03:35.530> vise

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
that just gets clamped in my face vise

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.009 
that just gets clamped in my face vise
and<00:03:36.130> that<00:03:36.220> works<00:03:36.430> out<00:03:36.580> really<00:03:36.790> nicely<00:03:37.060> but<00:03:37.900> of

00:03:38.009 --> 00:03:38.019 
and that works out really nicely but of

00:03:38.019 --> 00:03:39.660 
and that works out really nicely but of
course<00:03:38.320> it's<00:03:38.530> only<00:03:38.680> good<00:03:38.980> for<00:03:39.010> certain<00:03:39.370> router

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:39.670 
course it's only good for certain router

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:42.509 
course it's only good for certain router
jobs<00:03:40.560> don't<00:03:41.560> remember<00:03:41.890> why<00:03:42.100> I<00:03:42.130> put<00:03:42.160> this

picture in under the bench though I've
had<00:03:46.090> to<00:03:46.299> do<00:03:47.109> without<00:03:47.440> certain<00:03:47.920> things<00:03:48.220> so<00:03:48.400> I've

00:03:48.509 --> 00:03:48.519 
had to do without certain things so I've

00:03:48.519 --> 00:03:51.569 
had to do without certain things so I've
actually<00:03:49.090> put<00:03:49.420> toolboxes<00:03:50.170> outside<00:03:50.680> for<00:03:51.370> some

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:51.579 
actually put toolboxes outside for some

00:03:51.579 --> 00:03:53.759 
actually put toolboxes outside for some
stuff<00:03:51.850> and<00:03:52.120> this<00:03:52.209> is<00:03:52.269> the<00:03:52.570> saw<00:03:53.290> bench<00:03:53.530> that<00:03:53.680> I

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
stuff and this is the saw bench that I

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:56.099 
stuff and this is the saw bench that I
built<00:03:54.040> to<00:03:54.100> replace<00:03:54.579> my<00:03:54.790> box<00:03:55.060> this<00:03:55.840> is<00:03:56.079> a

00:03:56.099 --> 00:03:56.109 
built to replace my box this is a

00:03:56.109 --> 00:03:58.080 
built to replace my box this is a
picture<00:03:56.530> of<00:03:56.560> my<00:03:56.680> old<00:03:56.859> shop<00:03:57.190> and<00:03:57.459> like<00:03:57.700> table

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
picture of my old shop and like table

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:59.370 
picture of my old shop and like table
saws<00:03:58.329> and<00:03:58.630> things<00:03:58.780> like<00:03:58.870> that<00:03:58.959> there's<00:03:59.260> no

00:03:59.370 --> 00:03:59.380 
saws and things like that there's no

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.590 
saws and things like that there's no
room<00:03:59.560> for<00:03:59.620> them<00:04:00.070> so<00:04:00.790> I've<00:04:00.940> replaced<00:04:01.329> that<00:04:01.540> with

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
room for them so I've replaced that with

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.220 
room for them so I've replaced that with
the<00:04:02.109> Festool<00:04:02.620> saw<00:04:02.920> system<00:04:03.459> and<00:04:03.640> of<00:04:04.329> course<00:04:04.570> the

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
the Festool saw system and of course the

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:06.900 
the Festool saw system and of course the
tracks<00:04:05.560> have<00:04:05.829> to<00:04:05.950> be<00:04:06.040> stored<00:04:06.310> somewhere<00:04:06.400> so

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:06.910 
tracks have to be stored somewhere so

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.310 
tracks have to be stored somewhere so
here<00:04:07.090> they're<00:04:07.239> on<00:04:07.359> the<00:04:07.480> ceiling<00:04:07.870> with<00:04:08.019> my<00:04:08.170> new

here they're on the ceiling with my new
fluorescent<00:04:08.859> lights<00:04:09.040> and<00:04:09.790> I<00:04:10.329> added<00:04:10.540> a<00:04:10.720> bunch

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:10.870

the drill press that's on ended up

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.659 
the drill press that's on ended up
eventually<00:04:17.320> getting<00:04:17.829> drawers<00:04:18.070> in<00:04:18.340> it<00:04:18.430> because

Festool vac and that's going to cause me
problems<00:04:51.500> I'll<00:04:52.009> have<00:04:53.000> to<00:04:53.360> make<00:04:53.750> a<00:04:53.810> video<00:04:54.229> about

00:04:54.369 --> 00:04:54.379 
problems I'll have to make a video about

00:04:54.379 --> 00:04:56.320 
problems I'll have to make a video about
that<00:04:54.500> later<00:04:54.889> and<00:04:55.099> I<00:04:55.159> needed<00:04:55.490> a<00:04:55.610> jointer<00:04:56.090> so<00:04:56.300> I

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:56.330 
that later and I needed a jointer so I

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.089 
that later and I needed a jointer so I
found<00:04:56.659> this<00:04:56.810> antique<00:04:57.610> or<00:04:58.610> old<00:04:59.000> at<00:04:59.330> least

00:05:00.089 --> 00:05:00.099 
found this antique or old at least

00:05:00.099 --> 00:05:02.290 
found this antique or old at least
beaver<00:05:01.099> jointer<00:05:01.520> and<00:05:01.550> I<00:05:01.699> had<00:05:01.879> to<00:05:02.029> build<00:05:02.210> a

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:02.300 
beaver jointer and I had to build a

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.119 
beaver jointer and I had to build a
stand<00:05:02.599> for<00:05:02.870> but<00:05:03.080> there's<00:05:03.319> no<00:05:03.469> space<00:05:03.800> in<00:05:04.009> my

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:04.129 
stand for but there's no space in my

00:05:04.129 --> 00:05:06.189 
stand for but there's no space in my
shop<00:05:04.400> for<00:05:04.610> jointer<00:05:04.879> so<00:05:05.180> I<00:05:05.360> found<00:05:05.930> a<00:05:06.050> way<00:05:06.169> to

00:05:06.189 --> 00:05:06.199 
shop for jointer so I found a way to

00:05:06.199 --> 00:05:08.019 
shop for jointer so I found a way to
hide<00:05:06.469> it<00:05:06.500> under<00:05:06.860> the<00:05:06.979> bench<00:05:07.189> there's<00:05:07.580> a<00:05:07.669> video

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:08.029 
hide it under the bench there's a video

00:05:08.029 --> 00:05:10.600 
hide it under the bench there's a video
on<00:05:08.150> the<00:05:08.330> on<00:05:08.599> the<00:05:09.349> list<00:05:09.560> about<00:05:09.889> that<00:05:10.189> and<00:05:10.430> then

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:10.610 
on the on the list about that and then

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:12.850 
on the on the list about that and then
of<00:05:10.729> course<00:05:10.759> you<00:05:11.029> just<00:05:11.060> add<00:05:11.439> more<00:05:12.439> and<00:05:12.620> more

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 
of course you just add more and more

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:14.860 
of course you just add more and more
things<00:05:13.129> and<00:05:13.520> things<00:05:13.729> get<00:05:13.939> more<00:05:14.120> cluttered<00:05:14.599> so

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
things and things get more cluttered so

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.779 
things and things get more cluttered so
you<00:05:15.409> can<00:05:15.560> just<00:05:15.740> see<00:05:15.889> the<00:05:16.039> gradual<00:05:16.610> progression

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
you can just see the gradual progression

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:19.809 
you can just see the gradual progression
from<00:05:17.479> nothing<00:05:17.870> in<00:05:17.990> the<00:05:18.080> shop<00:05:18.319> to<00:05:18.590> far<00:05:19.370> too<00:05:19.639> much

00:05:19.809 --> 00:05:19.819 
from nothing in the shop to far too much

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:22.800 
from nothing in the shop to far too much
