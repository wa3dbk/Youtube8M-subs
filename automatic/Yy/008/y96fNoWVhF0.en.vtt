00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:15.870
 hello guys the other day the trailer came out 

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.180
 4 of godzilla but Asian version or 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.590
 it is subtitled to Asian but 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.960
 today I bring you an informative video 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.210
 about this trailer and most importantly 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:26.250
 of it good point as you will see the typical 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.500
 the military in helicopters then 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.329
 the shell shows an egg which is 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.680
 the shape of flying motorbike point 

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:33.680
 let's start with the analysis 

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.600
 in this scene you see the scientists 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.940
 or whatever you want to call them looking at 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.399
 shell which he starts to break 

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.410
 and there comes out the flying world mutated is a 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:47.839
 scientific experiment by accident 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.409
 remember what confuses me is that no 

00:00:47.839 --> 00:00:53.510
 I know if they are two worlds but I know they are two 

00:00:50.409 --> 00:00:55.640
 well this part is known to all is the 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.829
 part when much terrestrial attacks the 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.050
 airport and faces against gotilla 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:02.360
 it is believed that the terrestrial mutated dies in 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:05.059
 this scene as little bag starts to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.369
 confront him here show our 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.050
 main character the military watching 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.240
 from a zero what seems to be a 

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.700
 city hit by bots and the bike has 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.369
 more pint of what will look have attacked there 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.679
 the most famous scene that we saw in the 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:21.140
 trailer 2 and 3 the city of las vegas 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:23.179
 we miss godzilla or whatever 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.130
 been there but this one looks more clear 

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:27.289
 pointed out in my opinion they say that in the 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.690
 movie everyone was whipped 

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:32.020
 by monsters according to Edwards said in a 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:34.899
 interview 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.969
 in this photo we can confirm that it is 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.369
 much the flying one that is thrown into the water 

00:01:36.969 --> 00:01:41.320
 it's a lot was right haha I'll stay like 

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:44.350
 a complete idiot saying that it was not 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.020
 but if they were right some imbeciles 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.659
 they already started to say that it was Rhône another 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.479
 I have a question that they smoke for 

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:54.789
 say it's another or rhône fuck good 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.219
 it is clear that this world is medium 

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:59.110
 small but reality is very big already 

00:01:57.219 --> 00:02:01.780
 that faces godzilla and that scene 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.409
 I leave it on video hahaha good let's start 

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.780
 with the very interesting scenes 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.030
 I do not know what it says there but it looks 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.310
 which is something interesting you see the beard or 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:14.640
 whatever it is already the military in 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:16.590
 a radioactive bunker here says sorry if 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:18.780
 my english seems like shit but I'm 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.390
 sure he says something is about to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.489
 go through and see clearly that the 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.069
 shell and leaves a lot juniors the flyer 

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:28.140
 of the Japan scene and the earthquake is 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:30.450
 see clearly that there is a monster above 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.209
 but no fucking idea but they know it's 

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.370
 you can see him in the arms he has and 

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:37.799
 the tentacles point and then the same 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.260
 it's always clear that the one who 

00:02:37.799 --> 00:02:42.480
 falls from the sky is world its scary form 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.400
 over the bullets do not make a fucking 

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.549
 damage when it passes in front of the building 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:50.430
 it is very shocking is very original has 

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:52.260
 a bird or insect form is 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.480
 scene left me with a smile 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.849
 corner to corner the soldier asks 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:00.379
 a woman or scientist is a monster 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:03.599
 and she responds is not a god 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:06.030
 anesthetist godzilla is a god wow that 

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:08.220
 it's shocking to look at the scene of the 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.290
 destruction of the bridge of Sant I close 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.490
 remember the pacific rim when a 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.680
 kaiku category 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:19.190
 but this one that looks like being 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:19.190
 category 89 pd spoke of horn 

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.420
 cot 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.670
 in my opinion this movie is going to be 

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.090
 very squeaky good luck they have the 

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.250
 Peruvians will see her in 4d shit but 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.080
 as long as I see it in 3-d better when 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.569
 see them I make a criticism and my opinions 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.030
 and when the sub comes out between v knock down 

00:03:42.569 --> 00:03:47.280
