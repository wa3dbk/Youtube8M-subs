00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:36.980 
extensions that's why you have to strain
your<00:01:35.369> extensions<00:01:35.880> first<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.509> then

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
your extensions first and then

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.749 
your extensions first and then
straighten<00:01:37.380> your<00:01:37.439> leave<00:01:37.650> out<00:01:37.770> when<00:01:38.610> you're

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
straighten your leave out when you're

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.090 
straighten your leave out when you're
straining<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.420> extensions<00:01:40.079> I<00:01:40.259> suggest<00:01:40.979> that

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
straining your extensions I suggest that

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.100 
straining your extensions I suggest that
you<00:01:41.250> don't<00:01:41.460> go<00:01:41.670> over<00:01:41.700> the<00:01:41.909> temperature<00:01:42.270> of<00:01:42.360> 350

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
you don't go over the temperature of 350

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.319 
you don't go over the temperature of 350
degrees<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:44.189> reason<00:01:44.549> why<00:01:44.700> is<00:01:44.759> because<00:01:45.090> when

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
degrees the reason why is because when

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:46.910 
degrees the reason why is because when
you're<00:01:45.479> doing<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.200> could<00:01:46.409> encourage

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
you're doing this you could encourage

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.069 
you're doing this you could encourage
heat<00:01:47.250> damage<00:01:47.640> and<00:01:47.850> with<00:01:48.119> heat<00:01:48.360> damage<00:01:48.720> it

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
heat damage and with heat damage it

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
heat damage and with heat damage it
makes<00:01:49.290> it<00:01:49.439> hard<00:01:49.649> for<00:01:49.829> the<00:01:49.920> curl<00:01:50.159> pattern<00:01:50.579> to

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
makes it hard for the curl pattern to

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.210 
makes it hard for the curl pattern to
return<00:01:51.119> to<00:01:51.270> its<00:01:51.420> natural<00:01:51.869> state<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.860> it's<00:01:53.040> safe

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
return to its natural state so it's safe

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.429 
return to its natural state so it's safe
to<00:01:53.430> just<00:01:53.640> go<00:01:53.820> up<00:01:54.000> to<00:01:54.030> a<00:01:54.210> maximum<00:01:54.509> of<00:01:54.720> 350

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
to just go up to a maximum of 350

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:56.510 
to just go up to a maximum of 350
degrees<00:01:55.770> when<00:01:56.040> you're<00:01:56.159> straining<00:01:56.399> your

straightening<00:02:57.600> my<00:02:57.870> leave<00:02:58.050> out<00:02:58.230> I<00:02:58.380> like<00:02:58.530> to<00:02:58.560> do

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
straightening my leave out I like to do

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.680 
straightening my leave out I like to do
so<00:02:58.980> in<00:02:59.100> small<00:02:59.340> sections<00:02:59.580> and<00:03:00.090> I<00:03:00.150> suggest<00:03:00.570> that

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
so in small sections and I suggest that

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:01.490 
so in small sections and I suggest that
you<00:03:00.840> do<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.080> well

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
you do as well

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.080 
you do as well
because<00:03:02.010> when<00:03:02.190> you're<00:03:02.310> doing<00:03:02.430> this<00:03:02.700> this<00:03:02.940> is

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:03.090 
because when you're doing this this is

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.670 
because when you're doing this this is
going<00:03:03.240> to<00:03:03.330> make<00:03:03.480> sure<00:03:03.690> that<00:03:03.870> each<00:03:04.050> section<00:03:04.530> is

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
going to make sure that each section is

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.890 
going to make sure that each section is
as<00:03:04.890> straight<00:03:05.160> as<00:03:05.280> possible<00:03:05.340> if<00:03:05.970> your<00:03:06.480> sections

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
as straight as possible if your sections

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.930 
as straight as possible if your sections
are<00:03:07.080> too<00:03:07.260> big<00:03:07.500> or<00:03:07.710> too<00:03:07.740> wide<00:03:08.070> or<00:03:08.430> you<00:03:08.550> part<00:03:08.850> it

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
are too big or too wide or you part it

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.730 
are too big or too wide or you part it
too<00:03:09.060> back<00:03:09.300> when<00:03:09.570> you're<00:03:09.690> doing<00:03:09.990> it<00:03:10.140> you<00:03:10.560> may

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:10.740 
too back when you're doing it you may

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.920 
too back when you're doing it you may
not<00:03:10.920> successfully<00:03:11.730> straighten<00:03:12.180> it<00:03:12.240> out<00:03:12.390> so<00:03:12.450> it

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
not successfully straighten it out so it

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.140 
not successfully straighten it out so it

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.050 
that clip because that hair is going to

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:30.740 
that clip because that hair is going to
flow<00:03:28.290> back<00:03:28.530> this<00:03:28.740> way<00:03:29.010> then<00:03:30.000> I<00:03:30.150> like<00:03:30.330> to<00:03:30.450> part

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750

this in half and have one section going

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:34.910 
this in half and have one section going
this<00:03:32.820> way<00:03:33.030> and<00:03:33.240> one<00:03:33.900> section<00:03:34.290> going<00:03:34.560> this<00:03:34.710> way

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
this way and one section going this way

and<00:03:35.160> I<00:03:35.250> like<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.550> work<00:03:35.700> in<00:03:35.880> sections<00:03:36.090> so<00:03:36.510> now

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
and I like to work in sections so now

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.430 

so<00:03:55.340> as<00:03:55.459> you<00:03:55.610> can<00:03:55.790> see<00:03:56.140> it's<00:03:57.140> going<00:03:57.319> to<00:03:57.379> be

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:57.440 
so as you can see it's going to be

00:03:57.440 --> 00:03:59.140 
so as you can see it's going to be
straining<00:03:57.860> going<00:03:58.190> in<00:03:58.310> these<00:03:58.430> directions<00:03:58.970> and

00:03:59.140 --> 00:03:59.150 
straining going in these directions and

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:00.309 
straining going in these directions and
then<00:03:59.330> this<00:03:59.420> is<00:03:59.599> going<00:03:59.750> to<00:03:59.810> be<00:03:59.900> straightened

00:04:00.309 --> 00:04:00.319 
then this is going to be straightened

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:02.229 
then this is going to be straightened
going<00:04:00.500> back<00:04:00.739> so<00:04:01.340> that<00:04:01.549> way<00:04:01.670> the<00:04:01.849> hair<00:04:02.030> isn't

00:04:02.229 --> 00:04:02.239 
going back so that way the hair isn't

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:04.390 
going back so that way the hair isn't
resistant<00:04:02.900> when<00:04:03.019> I<00:04:03.110> call<00:04:03.440> me<00:04:03.590> all<00:04:03.830> down<00:04:04.099> in<00:04:04.280> its

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:04.400 
resistant when I call me all down in its

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.820 
resistant when I call me all down in its
directions<00:04:04.930> so<00:04:05.930> now<00:04:06.080> I'm<00:04:06.379> just<00:04:06.590> going<00:04:06.739> to

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:06.830 
directions so now I'm just going to

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:09.160 
directions so now I'm just going to
start<00:04:07.010> on<00:04:07.129> this<00:04:07.310> section<00:04:07.700> here<00:04:07.940> and<00:04:08.180> I'm<00:04:08.989> going

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:09.170

doing this in small sections so that
this<00:04:56.180> is<00:04:56.360> strain<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.870> then<00:04:57.410> you<00:04:57.560> can<00:04:57.770> move<00:04:57.889> to

00:04:57.939 --> 00:04:57.949 
this is strain and then you can move to

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:00.309 
this is strain and then you can move to
this<00:04:58.220> side<00:04:58.580> or<00:04:58.909> you<00:04:59.479> can<00:04:59.659> do<00:04:59.780> the<00:04:59.900> back<00:05:00.050> first

this side or you can do the back first
it<00:05:00.560> doesn't<00:05:00.860> matter<00:05:01.009> just<00:05:01.250> work<00:05:01.879> on<00:05:02.150> one

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.180 
it doesn't matter just work on one

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:30.749 
it doesn't matter just work on one
section<00:05:02.449> at<00:05:02.960> a<00:05:02.990> time

00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:30.759 

00:05:30.759 --> 00:05:33.059 

once<00:05:31.389> you<00:05:31.599> straighten<00:05:32.050> your<00:05:32.139> leave<00:05:32.349> out<00:05:32.559> this
