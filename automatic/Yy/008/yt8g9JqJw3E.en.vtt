00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
foundation with a rubber sponge which is

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.800

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:25.510 
foundation looks like it's gonna be a

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.819 
foundation looks like it's gonna be a
bit<00:03:25.959> dewy<00:03:26.350> I<00:03:27.660> would<00:03:28.660> say<00:03:28.870> about<00:03:29.170> light<00:03:29.500> to

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:29.829 
bit dewy I would say about light to

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:32.759 
bit dewy I would say about light to
medium<00:03:30.010> coverage<00:03:30.220> but<00:03:31.090> buildable<00:03:31.570> for<00:03:32.140> sure<00:03:32.380> I

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
medium coverage but buildable for sure I

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:35.880 
medium coverage but buildable for sure I
can't<00:03:33.489> feel<00:03:33.700> it<00:03:33.730> on<00:03:33.940> the<00:03:34.090> skin<00:03:34.530> but<00:03:35.530> I<00:03:35.560> could

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:35.890 
can't feel it on the skin but I could

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:37.590 
can't feel it on the skin but I could
kind<00:03:36.160> of<00:03:36.250> feel<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.790> thickness<00:03:37.239> of<00:03:37.450> the

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:37.600 
kind of feel the thickness of the

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.630 
kind of feel the thickness of the
foundation<00:03:37.720> on<00:03:38.320> my<00:03:38.470> skin<00:03:38.799> when<00:03:39.340> I<00:03:39.400> was

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:39.640

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:43.239 
applying it with this now that I've used

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.030 
applying it with this now that I've used
my<00:03:43.390> Beauty<00:03:43.720> Blender<00:03:43.750> it's<00:03:44.260> kind<00:03:44.530> of<00:03:44.620> soaked<00:03:44.890> up

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
my Beauty Blender it's kind of soaked up

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:49.319 
my Beauty Blender it's kind of soaked up
all<00:03:45.220> the<00:03:45.340> excess<00:03:45.700> product<00:03:46.090> and<00:03:48.150> so<00:03:49.150> yeah<00:03:49.299> I

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:49.329 
all the excess product and so yeah I

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:51.720 
all the excess product and so yeah I
really<00:03:49.600> do<00:03:50.110> not<00:03:50.230> like<00:03:50.290> the<00:03:50.650> applicator<00:03:51.400> thing

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:51.730 
really do not like the applicator thing

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:53.550 
really do not like the applicator thing
it<00:03:51.910> comes<00:03:52.180> with<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:52.810> I<00:03:53.049> don't<00:03:53.260> think<00:03:53.440> it's

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
it comes with and I don't think it's

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.090 
it comes with and I don't think it's
worked<00:03:53.829> worth<00:03:54.340> them<00:03:54.820> marking<00:03:55.510> up<00:03:55.630> the<00:03:55.660> price

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
worked worth them marking up the price

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.890 
worked worth them marking up the price
just<00:03:57.100> for<00:03:57.370> that<00:03:57.489> sponge<00:03:57.880> in<00:03:58.269> my<00:03:58.390> opinion<00:03:58.870> that

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
just for that sponge in my opinion that

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:00.990 
just for that sponge in my opinion that
was<00:03:59.290> kind<00:03:59.590> of<00:03:59.680> my<00:03:59.799> little<00:04:00.100> demo<00:04:00.640> on<00:04:00.880> this

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:01.000 
was kind of my little demo on this

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.509 
was kind of my little demo on this
foundation<00:04:01.660> it's<00:04:02.290> been<00:04:02.530> about<00:04:02.739> two<00:04:03.340> to<00:04:03.489> three

00:04:03.509 --> 00:04:03.519 
foundation it's been about two to three

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:06.390 
foundation it's been about two to three
minutes<00:04:04.060> and<00:04:04.239> it's<00:04:04.630> still<00:04:04.930> almost<00:04:05.769> set<00:04:06.280> it

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:06.400 
minutes and it's still almost set it

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.430 
minutes and it's still almost set it
just<00:04:06.459> feels<00:04:06.880> a<00:04:07.180> little<00:04:07.209> bit<00:04:07.480> tacky<00:04:07.840> still

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:08.440 
just feels a little bit tacky still

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.380 
just feels a little bit tacky still
light<00:04:09.400> to<00:04:09.579> medium<00:04:09.730> coverage

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:10.390 
light to medium coverage

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:13.500 
light to medium coverage
definitely<00:04:11.110> buildable<00:04:11.440> lightweight<00:04:12.510> the

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:13.510 
definitely buildable lightweight the

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:15.330 
definitely buildable lightweight the
color<00:04:13.780> matches<00:04:14.320> me<00:04:14.470> pretty<00:04:14.650> well<00:04:14.860> I<00:04:15.070> think<00:04:15.130> I

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:15.340 
color matches me pretty well I think I

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:16.530 
color matches me pretty well I think I
actually<00:04:15.489> got<00:04:15.699> the<00:04:15.970> lightest

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:16.540 
actually got the lightest

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.040 
actually got the lightest
shade<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:18.190> line<00:04:18.510> and<00:04:19.510> there<00:04:19.720> was<00:04:19.840> actually

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.050 
shade in the line and there was actually

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:21.870 
shade in the line and there was actually
a<00:04:20.680> lot<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.010> different<00:04:21.280> shades<00:04:21.520> of<00:04:21.730> this

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:21.880 
a lot of different shades of this

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.500 
a lot of different shades of this

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:28.330 
just going to go in with my Maybelline

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.290 
just going to go in with my Maybelline
instant<00:04:28.990> age<00:04:29.230> rewind<00:04:29.320> this<00:04:30.160> is<00:04:30.610> taking<00:04:31.060> a<00:04:31.150> long

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
instant age rewind this is taking a long

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:33.720 
instant age rewind this is taking a long
time<00:04:31.360> to<00:04:31.660> set<00:04:31.990> so<00:04:32.260> I'm<00:04:32.350> assuming<00:04:32.620> it's<00:04:33.130> not

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
time to set so I'm assuming it's not

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.090 
time to set so I'm assuming it's not
going<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.210> be<00:04:34.360> very<00:04:34.690> mattifying<00:04:35.440> so<00:04:35.770> I<00:04:35.800> don't

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:36.100 
going to be very mattifying so I don't

00:04:36.100 --> 00:04:37.910 
going to be very mattifying so I don't
know<00:04:36.160> how<00:04:36.340> this<00:04:36.460> would<00:04:36.640> work<00:04:36.670> for<00:04:37.060> oily<00:04:37.390> skin

00:04:37.910 --> 00:04:37.920 
know how this would work for oily skin

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.250 
know how this would work for oily skin
but<00:04:38.920> probably<00:04:39.370> in<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.700> dry<00:04:40.000> winter<00:04:40.480> months<00:04:40.990> it

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:41.260 
but probably in the dry winter months it

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.950 
but probably in the dry winter months it
would<00:04:41.530> work<00:04:42.310> fine<00:04:42.580> greatly<00:04:43.180> notice<00:04:43.570> how<00:04:43.750> it's

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:43.960 
would work fine greatly notice how it's

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:48.240 
would work fine greatly notice how it's
smooth<00:04:44.800> down<00:04:45.340> my<00:04:45.580> hairs<00:04:45.940> at<00:04:46.300> all<00:04:47.190> because<00:04:48.190> I

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:48.250 
smooth down my hairs at all because I

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.420 
smooth down my hairs at all because I
don't<00:04:48.340> really<00:04:48.670> have<00:04:48.880> that<00:04:48.910> many<00:04:50.340> just<00:04:51.340> like

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.430 
don't really have that many just like

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.400 
don't really have that many just like
maybe<00:04:51.880> around<00:04:52.210> my<00:04:52.300> lip<00:04:52.510> area<00:04:52.810> like<00:04:53.110> a<00:04:53.140> little

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:53.410 
maybe around my lip area like a little

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.180 
maybe around my lip area like a little
peach<00:04:53.590> fuzz<00:04:53.620> like<00:04:54.190> all<00:04:54.370> women<00:04:54.670> have<00:04:54.820> um<00:04:56.190> but

00:04:57.180 --> 00:04:57.190 
peach fuzz like all women have um but

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.380 
peach fuzz like all women have um but
yeah<00:04:57.310> I<00:04:57.370> don't<00:04:57.660> see<00:04:58.660> how<00:04:58.900> it's<00:04:59.110> done<00:04:59.800> that<00:05:00.390> but

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:01.390 
yeah I don't see how it's done that but

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.560 
yeah I don't see how it's done that but
yeah<00:05:02.050> so<00:05:02.800> far<00:05:03.040> this<00:05:03.430> foundation<00:05:03.970> is<00:05:04.150> just<00:05:04.180> like

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:04.570 
yeah so far this foundation is just like

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.530 
yeah so far this foundation is just like
a<00:05:04.600> seven<00:05:05.350> out<00:05:05.470> of<00:05:05.500> ten<00:05:05.650> for<00:05:06.040> me<00:05:06.220> it<00:05:07.150> didn't<00:05:07.450> do

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:07.540 
a seven out of ten for me it didn't do

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:09.240 
a seven out of ten for me it didn't do
much<00:05:07.720> I<00:05:08.020> really<00:05:08.260> don't<00:05:08.500> think<00:05:08.710> it's<00:05:08.920> worth

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:09.250 
much I really don't think it's worth

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:12.660 
much I really don't think it's worth
them<00:05:09.910> not<00:05:10.240> putting<00:05:10.900> less<00:05:11.080> product<00:05:11.650> in<00:05:12.310> the

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
them not putting less product in the

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.330 
them not putting less product in the
foundation<00:05:13.270> just<00:05:13.720> because<00:05:14.110> they<00:05:14.530> added<00:05:14.980> this

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:15.340 
foundation just because they added this

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:17.640 
foundation just because they added this
applicator<00:05:15.850> which<00:05:16.150> I<00:05:16.300> in<00:05:16.780> my<00:05:16.930> opinion<00:05:17.320> I<00:05:17.470> would

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:17.650 
applicator which I in my opinion I would

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:20.130 
applicator which I in my opinion I would
never<00:05:17.830> use<00:05:18.130> that<00:05:18.160> again<00:05:18.610> it<00:05:19.480> does<00:05:19.690> not<00:05:19.870> blend

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140 
never use that again it does not blend

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:21.060 
never use that again it does not blend
anything<00:05:20.770> at<00:05:20.890> all

00:05:21.060 --> 00:05:21.070 
anything at all

00:05:21.070 --> 00:05:26.390 
anything at all
so<00:05:22.410> um<00:05:23.410> foundation<00:05:24.100> is<00:05:24.460> okay<00:05:24.880> applicator<00:05:25.510> know

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
so um foundation is okay applicator know

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:29.040 
so um foundation is okay applicator know
it<00:05:27.400> would<00:05:27.550> probably<00:05:27.580> work<00:05:28.060> for<00:05:28.420> you<00:05:28.600> if<00:05:28.870> you

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
it would probably work for you if you

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:31.500 
it would probably work for you if you
have<00:05:29.380> like<00:05:29.560> a<00:05:29.590> light<00:05:29.830> to<00:05:30.010> medium<00:05:30.130> if<00:05:30.790> you<00:05:31.300> need

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:31.510 
have like a light to medium if you need

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:33.390 
have like a light to medium if you need
like<00:05:31.660> like<00:05:31.840> to<00:05:31.990> be<00:05:32.080> named<00:05:32.230> coverage<00:05:32.740> if<00:05:33.160> you're

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:33.400 
like like to be named coverage if you're

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.000 
like like to be named coverage if you're
kind<00:05:33.850> of<00:05:34.000> more<00:05:34.240> on<00:05:34.360> the<00:05:34.510> dry<00:05:34.660> normal<00:05:35.320> normal

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:36.010 
kind of more on the dry normal normal

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:38.340 
kind of more on the dry normal normal
side<00:05:36.480> just<00:05:37.480> be<00:05:37.600> sure<00:05:37.780> to<00:05:37.810> set<00:05:38.110> it<00:05:38.140> with<00:05:38.230> a

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:38.350 
side just be sure to set it with a

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:40.640 
side just be sure to set it with a
powder<00:05:38.410> if<00:05:38.860> you're<00:05:39.010> like<00:05:39.190> normal<00:05:39.760> combination

00:05:40.640 --> 00:05:40.650 
powder if you're like normal combination

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:43.680 
powder if you're like normal combination
but<00:05:41.650> other<00:05:41.830> than<00:05:42.040> that<00:05:42.130> and<00:05:42.910> I<00:05:43.210> would<00:05:43.360> say<00:05:43.390> it's

00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:43.690 
but other than that and I would say it's

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:45.540 
but other than that and I would say it's
a<00:05:43.750> nice<00:05:43.930> foundation<00:05:44.320> but<00:05:44.590> it<00:05:44.740> just<00:05:44.920> didn't

00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:45.550
