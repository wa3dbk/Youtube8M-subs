00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:21.400
 Pauli population welcome to another edition of the 

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.079
 Videoportals is the same way 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:27.599
 Today, for once, I can look into the eyes of both people today 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:30.310
 printeria took over the tax 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.780
 with Santander one year ago so to the Griffith Park Observatory 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.180
 By the way, that is a migrant inside little of his chances we have to deal with 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.300
 whom he wants in the many trips 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.840
 Michelin stands 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:45.820
 not even the Observatory Sweden on this, apparently interesting things 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.600
 employer 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.270
 from view of this misfortune of the parking garage simply absolutely spectacular 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.640
 but after sunset because you really get an impression of the 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.160
 Size of this city 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.590
 but if one considers that one data at most one 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.200
 ten goals 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.559
 Breakball but his shot from the entertainment in the whole area what you look 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.140
 to call a river 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.090
 that is very impressive 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.320
 I'll see if I can manage some nice video footage 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:16.140
 to make of them and to incorporate them into these words thus also something of it 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.230
 to have 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:20.270
 By the way, I almost can not say how good I am at the moment 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.060
 feel 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.150
 on the one hand, I think I'll say that when 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.770
 I am first and foremost a person in the depths 

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.120
 a human being who gives energy to all people 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.289
 show them that they set up themselves 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:33.600
 the suppliers are 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.600
 no matter what else is on our business card 

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.690
 and I'll say a basic seminar in an energy density evening if not only 

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:42.470
 the right 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:46.960
 to recharge regular energy but also the duty for what else to do 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:48.320
 Offer 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:52.810
 why he sees himself as an energy supplier, Erhard sees the arms of best joie de vivre 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.750
 March loudly earned 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.409
 so please consider Boquoi etc n-ergie separate 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.700
 John Lennon too few allergic people in the apology he closes the world 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:06.140
 here looks can pass on to people 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.649
 who have not realized that they can also be energy suppliers 

00:02:11.409 --> 00:02:15.669
 to present at once to prevent as we said if we succeed 

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:19.449
 asked if she was lucky enough to take some nice shots 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:22.549
 then know now enjoy the same 

00:02:22.549 --> 00:02:26.359
 I said I think until next time we are very serious and will only 

00:02:26.359 --> 00:02:29.359
 ca new buoyancy 

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:51.079
 b 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:54.069
 SID 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.069
 since 

00:03:02.689 --> 00:03:06.030
 that is certain 

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.059
 firmly 

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.319
 Dr 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:32.089
