00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:06.509
 hello to everyone 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:11.730
 after gluing all the components on this 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:15.870
 the mesh turned out well 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:22.279
 I'm going to cut down all the extra 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:25.890
 parts so that you can continue 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:28.070
 shape on similar drives here 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.279
 I already have this on the machine 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.239
 I will not only shoot like knives but 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.239
 this is a wooden part 

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:41.930
 but cut down this textolite which 

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:46.339
 I have a regular excessive Spila 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.930
 here is a hacksaw process giving 

00:00:46.339 --> 00:00:50.960
 forms and everything else i shoot not 

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.019
 because, honestly, I am the first time 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:59.680
 I do it on such disks and I do not know 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:01:04.250
 what can I do but take off 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:07.340
 finish result without impregnation so 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:11.420
 so here I am until I start for later 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:13.550
 already in the hair show that got in 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:17.600
 generally decided to shoot all the same 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.950
 intermediate results is what I 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.850
 it turned out after shaving 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.520
 similar tools from the fast cutter 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:30.229
 surprises me more and more 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.909
 the material to be honest not worth the mother 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:37.280
 draws attention to weighs in creative 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:45.500
 a mess but such is the primary 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:48.920
 processing let's say let's call it not 

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:52.039
 I suffered did not clean the blade 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:56.329
 polish it to shine decided to show 

00:01:52.039 --> 00:02:01.070
 here is the finish result stick up 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:02:04.789
 impregnation pancake oil hilt wooden 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:07.340
 parts are more correct in general 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:13.150
 I turned on the handle and processed yes 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:15.650
 I grind off sandpaper even manually 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.390
 starting with a coarse finish 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.840
 the smallest 

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:24.769
 but in general, it turned out like this 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:28.450
 me hilt doing here these fingers 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:32.269
 recesses under your arm therefore principle 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:33.730
 feeling burden very well and in this 

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:38.549
 enough 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:41.049
 so I think that's enough 

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:44.200
 alister still dirty all 

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:47.200
 I will eliminate polish grind 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:50.069
 brushing is not a problem this minute 

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:55.599
 business is coming to an end 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:57.250
 discovered on the wooden part 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:01.930
 here is the defect I do not know where it comes from 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:04.510
 took it but I press it seems like everything 

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:06.010
 ok i mean everything is hard but for 

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.340
 confidence I still try to fill 

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.329
 Here is this place pasibki inside a syringe and 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:18.129
 something similar well in general like this 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:21.959
 I will continue to soak the handle in not 

00:03:18.129 --> 00:03:21.959
 but the oil is rather the wooden part 

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.909
 sharpen 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:32.170
 but after that I'll try to test on 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:33.549
 that he is capable of honestly I do not know first 

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:36.549
 time of course 

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:43.090
 But here such petal disks on 

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:45.549
 which I processed hours will show it not 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:50.190
 the most convenient occupation but nonetheless 

00:03:45.549 --> 00:03:53.579
 you can do it like this 

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:55.989
 may be a specialist appreciates her as 

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:58.030
 not good enough but i like u 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:03.370
 I am satisfied with this is my first such 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:05.859
 work so here so here in general so far 

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:09.790
 I will saturate the whole thing with polishing 

00:04:05.859 --> 00:04:12.639
 blade sharpen well and then see you later 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:21.209
 next video everyone thanks for watching 

00:04:12.639 --> 00:04:21.209
 good luck everyone all bye
