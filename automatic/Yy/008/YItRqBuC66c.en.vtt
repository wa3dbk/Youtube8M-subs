 but now know more 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.770
 just look further 

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.020
 well our explanation 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.620
 this is so armstrong that he must take a peek because it is a very special thing 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.519
 type number vzw 0 7 rtl 5 0 get a team for hours 

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.490
 only em 

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.480
 the vacuum cleaner 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.870
 and in this price range the best in this samson is a vacuum cleaner without 

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.440
 dust bag 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.120
 this is one of the newest vacuum cleaners with an energy rating 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:11.840
 and having the energy labels explained in this region explains Poland's performance 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.119
 one of these substances 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.479
 and in the past only looked at the purple color of a vacuum cleaner 

00:01:16.479 --> 00:01:20.329
 sir what page the stronger engine probably better the suction well 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.190
 that is not the case at all 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.620
 and that is why you now have the label and it is a very economical prius 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.440
 how exactly it performs 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.770
 the specifications of this sansom the vacuum cleaner of the energy class a and the 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.050
 dust recording at time c and he is short and bee and dust recording at a hard 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.149
 floors the name 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:44.370
 and with substance emissions 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:48.360
 he finds the noise level of seven sons decibel and he has a power 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.100
 of 700 watts 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:53.790
 and these substances collect their contents at 2 liters 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:58.180
 He has a good boring clone, which is unique and because it is draining 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:02.450
 So you also save a lot of money and as an average 40 euros per year 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.200
 this fabric save has a teaaraar a home cord and together with the hose and 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.200
 snakes 10 action radius of ten a half meters this substance it has a 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:13.420
 eur5 weight half a kilo 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.739
 and missed the trend nice and easy pick up for example on the stairs 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:19.739
 He has a two-year warranty 

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:28.149
 and this cyclone multi hefty technique that ensures you the maximum suction power 

00:02:28.149 --> 00:02:28.899
 is going 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.980
 thanks to recent van gaal force 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.019
 the dust and the field are separated from the airflow and thereby 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.190
 the maximum we saw are 8 this vacuum cleaner has a de 

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:43.000
 telescope tube frame that you can determine the length yourself how long you don't have to 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.280
 and that way 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.530
 it is therefore encouraging everyone to adjust the operation of 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.020
 This vacuum cleaner is easy on the handle so we can live on it 

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:52.859
 shakes hands 

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:54.349
 and we can go even harder 

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:57.539
 and when saw to put also can through this handle 

00:02:57.539 --> 00:02:59.939
 and as an ideal the can also be operated simply 

00:02:59.939 --> 00:03:03.629
 and so he didn't press them and put the hose on the handles and you can 

00:03:03.629 --> 00:03:04.930
 just and twist 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.400
 so that it remains nice and easy to followers that you will not get stuck quickly 

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.269
 this fabric south has a rug with larger wheels on the back 

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:16.709
 Vacuum cleaners that I am nice and stable are going on but they have also thought of it 

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.599
 because it is also nice and light it is easy to lift this fabric 

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:22.950
 on the handle that you are done with his current you can also give this boy one 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.650
 nice compact mountains and also has a parking position mess with rear seats 

00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:31.049
 and that he also has this size on the back of the vacuum cleaner ie in the groin it is i 

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.719
 can expand roca bolt with your foot 

00:03:33.719 --> 00:03:37.170
 or if you want to bend down he has of course that your denominator denominator 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:40.960
 beautiful can store and remains indicator light as it is full 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:44.269
 and if the collection bin easily collects the overall September 

00:03:44.269 --> 00:03:46.049
 the chance this more the fear 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:49.370
 that we run is nothing at the time of a very easy lego you do this 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.430
 obviously falls under the guise of a few 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:54.950
 This fabric said that the playground requires maintenance and a fabric we lower 

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:59.320
 sit on but there is a filter on you sit here below we can run like that 

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:01.640
 houthalen here also see the filter 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.260
 yes do rinse briefly once every two weeks 

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:06.999
 nice and let it dry 

00:04:06.999 --> 00:04:10.309
 and then the deployment indian again ready for use make sure that we 

00:04:10.309 --> 00:04:11.169
 to advise 

00:04:11.169 --> 00:04:12.319
 it a filter 

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:14.219
 once a year 

00:04:14.219 --> 00:04:17.850
 from the blowing field at the back there is one of the vacuum cleaner that we briefly 

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:21.690
 that the tab and the to do in the tour will pick up 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:25.090
 here is the filter it is here i want to pick up help in the zoo 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:28.700
 you cannot rinse these migrants once a year 

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.139
 just replace it because that way a vacuum cleaner stays 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.139
 in top condition 8 

00:04:36.059 --> 00:04:39.889
 The vacuum cleaner has of course the floor nozzle for so much meal and one for it 

00:04:39.889 --> 00:04:41.590
 the soft and for the 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:44.199
 hard floors but this vacuum cleaner is still 

00:04:44.199 --> 00:04:46.080
 one two three four and five 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.509
 extra included 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:52.309
 even though a supplied ecocard or the optimum floor nozzle becomes one 

00:04:52.309 --> 00:04:55.850
 for the soft and floors that the rum called the handlebars 

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.350
 He has already got the wheels on it, everything is natural it is 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:04.360
 only with this feed nozzle omer dincer is ideal way under soft past 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:10.070
 you also get included to make sure the hard floors the eco heart the floor and 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.220
 a new one at the bottom a very light wheels and get it that way 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:16.789
 you do not scratch and report optimally 

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:17.830
 from sucking 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:21.349
 on it the once a mouthpiece can be in three different ways 

00:05:21.349 --> 00:05:26.349
 be used on this lake we can pretty with the little songs but also 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.409
 anderson 

00:05:27.409 --> 00:05:30.720
 super funny of these is therefore a multifunctional 

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.510
 in this way we have ready for the nutdorp and in this way we have 

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.729
 a cube like 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:36.920
 but we have to do our work 

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.020
 the winning and mini carpenter turbo brushes ideal for very small ones 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:42.530
 parties with 

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.160
 that weird because that's it 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:47.349
 A Loppersum hair breast is very easy to grab 

00:05:47.349 --> 00:05:51.919
 We also have a larger mouthpiece so ideal if you have your hair 

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:53.990
 in the front with dogs or the five cats 

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:55.789
 also the euro predicted 

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:57.289
 councilor frits alberts 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:00.289
 allah from the pond 

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:07.469
 perth in force in its vacuum cleaner energy labels in September 2014 

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:11.869
 and to get its energy label there must be a garden gnome all the old ones 

00:06:11.869 --> 00:06:14.539
 vacuum cleaners are therefore no longer made 

00:06:14.539 --> 00:06:19.330
 so in the past a vacuum cleaner with 18 underpinned or even 2000 baths wanted 

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.340
 That is no longer necessary. All brands have now made vacuum cleaners in such a way that they 

00:06:23.339 --> 00:06:24.900
 a coke should never have been allowed 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:26.889
 perform better than the old models 

00:06:26.889 --> 00:06:28.229
 with 2000 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.900
 thanks to these energy labels can finally be honest and compare 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.700
 really into it 

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.200
 for the quality and performance rwe vacuum cleaner but the duration and the 

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.979
 reliability of a vacuum cleaner yes 

00:06:37.979 --> 00:06:39.370
 it is not on the label 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.030
 number of points are listed at the top right and see the 

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.039
 energy class right in the middle the graceful annual energy consumption 

00:06:47.039 --> 00:06:51.199
 and look like the bottom and top left to see how much dust it still has 

00:06:51.199 --> 00:06:51.820
 places 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:52.999
 and top right 

00:06:52.999 --> 00:06:54.699
 it a noise level 

00:06:54.699 --> 00:06:58.289
 bottom left bugs dust absorption on soft floors 

00:06:58.289 --> 00:07:01.719
 and and bottom right the performance on but the floors 

00:07:01.719 --> 00:07:03.960
 emmen every level of money that dad 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.650
 has the best performance 

00:07:05.650 --> 00:07:09.910
 mg the worst member of the state had them below and a warning sign the most one 

00:07:09.910 --> 00:07:13.699
 vacuum cleaner not suitable for carpets but for hard floors 

00:07:13.699 --> 00:07:17.210
 and thanks to this label, vacuum cleaners can now work together in an honest way 

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:17.990
 compare 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:21.580
 an example of this is, for example, that not only the height that is there 

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:22.669
 the performance 

00:07:22.669 --> 00:07:24.039
 determine according to or saw 

00:07:24.039 --> 00:07:27.120
 so if you look at the top label the difference between a and g 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.199
 in a few years next to the electricity consumption of 6 euros yes the Finns 

00:07:31.199 --> 00:07:32.580
 riders not important 

00:07:32.580 --> 00:07:36.240
 among the vacuum cleaners can find the performance of software a lot 

00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:39.039
 more important, especially the 4 

00:07:39.039 --> 00:07:42.499
 if you had that to this video cousins ​​don't forget the one 

00:07:42.499 --> 00:07:46.639
 dive team or that you share one with your friends or the toppers as much 

00:07:46.639 --> 00:07:47.869
 media 

00:07:47.869 --> 00:07:49.360
 the winning couples 

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:52.199
 then click here on the ordered te 

00:07:52.199 --> 00:07:55.589
 although clickable the you go through the page 

00:07:55.589 --> 00:07:58.589
 I think then unfortunately product is in sight just on lay people 

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:00.789
 walk through it
