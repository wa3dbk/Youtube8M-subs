 be with this group be with so many 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.440
 players and the crises compose and 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.420
 we are psyched to take it out 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.570
 forward and why we are in a good 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.340
 practice here that we come and mentally 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.080
 we are all concentrated it is 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 seeing a great spirit a great union 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:31.080
 from among all comrades who 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:33.450
 motivates them to be this way 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:35.910
 motive that is going to be playing soccer 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.860
 it's not what you like most personally 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.930
 what I like most about soccer and it's what 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.680
 what motivates me to go to train because I 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.930
 I'm aiming to get to the start season and 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.280
 get good results 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.620
 physically you see that slowly 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:53.620
 grabbing grasping form already come the 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.079
 prep games already you think they're going 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.940
 to be ready to face what is 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:00.309
 a very complicated clear clear tournament 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.930
 we are all mentalized you can go in 

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.850
 the physical in the mental in a tactician 

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:06.700
 show the first match that is against 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.280
 I can be very very very focused very 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.350
 tucked in and very well physically and 

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.299
 mentally to face it and you can 

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.130
 get the three points of visit having 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.890
 this coexistence the one that takes has been 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.159
 will be very useful for you to 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:22.720
 the tactical issue to understand 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:24.970
 completely not yes obviously obviously already 

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.399
 come on we have game unit of the 

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.670
 This is obviously little by little 

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:33.490
 It's grabbing rhythm of game rhythm where 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.470
 let's be able and this one be ready for 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:37.360
 face the home games and 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.670
 season having several minutes podiums 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.619
 of play the last tournaments what 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.659
 means this closed 2013 for you in 

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:46.530
 Personally personally because it will be 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:48.119
 a goal not a challenge anymore 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.330
 and I want to have more minutes only 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:53.490
 sing what happens and everything I want to put together 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:56.580
 two minutes to be able to consolidate myself in 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.320
 the team and thus be able to make a 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.409
 good campaign and little by little consolidate 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.899
 me out there possible power 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.130
 the right side was left 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:06.690
 practically free with the output of 

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.660
 hugo rodríguez that I use there are several 

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.890
 parties shots out there could be a 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.450
 so a window for you and chicken 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.850
 positions as lateral by right is 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.470
 declared the mind where where the prophet 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:18.840
 take into account where you want to put it 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:22.500
 in I will always be feeling stuck 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.690
 be focused then if you need me 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:26.010
 for that band will do the same deal 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.720
 to do it one hundred percent and if 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.550
 central municipality is not going to be the 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.170
 section is difficult to talk about a possible 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.090
 consolidation in the first edition by 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.860
 the chicken for the next tournament all over 

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.650
 the amount of defenses that there are but not 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.780
 it is not difficult how difficult this is 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.780
 cute not obviously and competition to the 

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.740
 competition but 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:48.080
 being in people like your forehead 

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:50.030
 of headlines only that it was their 

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.940
 level because at any time you can 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:55.550
 get to have their level and be able to fight 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.810
 a position maybe in question minutes not 

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.460
 He has had us but a question 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.220
 emerge or that the experience has been 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.140
 soaked not so much leandro as facundo 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:03.920
 what they have lived in several 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.720
 moments of your life 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:08.690
 obviously obviously every story that 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.270
 they tell you or how do you see them train as 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:13.370
 They are an example for all of us 

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:15.380
 the young people who are always involved 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.970
 they are concentrated and they throw the 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.260
 shoulder team then it's the 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.790
 address for us we always 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:24.680
 we have been working and we can try 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.390
 deppeler is a position so that nobody 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.519
 feel safe I'm going to feel and that nerve 

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:29.989
 of the possibility of descending chicken 

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.379
 but you will sing he does not feel he was 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.909
 nerve of what you obviously feel the 

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:38.599
 They offered no but it's nice in the 

00:03:34.909 --> 00:03:41.569
 linear soccer if they will play without pressure 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:43.370
 you will not feel butterflies in your stomach or 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.379
 nerves stories dead then for 

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.319
 to play football you have to feel that always 

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:50.090
 feel the adrenaline and the dow in what 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.980
 nice of this sport what is the 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:53.450
 environment within the group being 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.400
 here in juriquilla where is the 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.590
 querétaro that is the team with whom 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.709
 they are going to fight for the decline is 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.959
 revealing that we are interested in that 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:05.900
 we had in our favor preparation 

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:08.180
 physical and this is where he chose the teacher 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:09.829
 to develop laughs the best place 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:12.520
 to do it 

00:04:09.829 --> 00:04:15.280
 and discussions 

00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:16.690
 that a death begins and that several 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.190
 teams love you as you have 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:19.959

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:11.020
 profession I am a professional I am going to 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.490
 take as such they are regenerated 

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:14.410
 after I say, I guess it's a lot 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.870
 in port what he forgot I can not 

00:05:14.410 --> 00:05:19.000
 to say that all my life of idolatries 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:22.090
 I've always been here as I tell you but I 

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.680
 I am a professional in the any 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:25.449
 part of energy there is no service here in 

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.430
 in Barcelona anywhere and I'm going to 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:30.430
 do the same the same power that 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.960
 trains everything and already chivas made official 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.410
 that you want a boat of armies 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:37.660

00:05:35.410 --> 00:05:39.910

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:42.550
 it's happy it does not make you happy 

00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:45.220
 but obviously when we do not until 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:46.690

00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:49.570

 I imagine you were surprised when 

00:05:57.729 --> 00:06:02.680
 chivas to be official that if you have 

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:05.199
 since they require 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:08.050
 that I can tell you that is revealing nothing 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:10.570
 I 'm happy because they look at my
