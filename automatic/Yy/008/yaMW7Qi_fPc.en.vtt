00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
sd-1 and what we're going to do to it is

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.299 
sd-1 and what we're going to do to it is
we're<00:00:06.450> going<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.629> turn<00:00:06.720> it<00:00:06.960> into<00:00:07.109> a<00:00:07.309> tube

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
we're going to turn it into a tube

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:10.339 
we're going to turn it into a tube
screamer<00:00:08.700> plus<00:00:09.150> they're<00:00:09.809> they<00:00:10.050> do<00:00:10.110> use

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
screamer plus they're they do use

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:12.290 
screamer plus they're they do use
different<00:00:10.740> types<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.309> clipping<00:00:11.730> in<00:00:11.880> them<00:00:12.030> so

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
different types of clipping in them so

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.789 
different types of clipping in them so
it's<00:00:12.690> not<00:00:12.840> sounding<00:00:13.049> exactly<00:00:13.230> like<00:00:13.500> a<00:00:13.620> tube

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799 
it's not sounding exactly like a tube

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:14.240

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:15.599 
but it's going to give you a pretty good

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:17.390 
but it's going to give you a pretty good
smooth<00:00:16.020> sound<00:00:16.260> so<00:00:16.949> we're<00:00:17.130> going<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.310> be

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
already marked them to show me which

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.420 
already marked them to show me which
spots<00:00:54.149> I<00:00:54.329> need<00:00:54.539> to<00:00:54.660> desolder<00:00:55.289> so<00:00:56.250> we're<00:00:56.340> going

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:56.430 
spots I need to desolder so we're going

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:57.740 
spots I need to desolder so we're going
to<00:00:56.489> desolder<00:00:56.730> all<00:00:56.969> these<00:00:57.090> spots<00:00:57.390> I'm<00:00:57.600> actually

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
to desolder all these spots I'm actually

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.029 
to desolder all these spots I'm actually
doing<00:00:57.930> a<00:00:58.050> gum<00:00:58.199> jump<00:00:58.469> through<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:58.739> I'm<00:00:58.890> pretty

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
doing a gum jump through this I'm pretty

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.439 
doing a gum jump through this I'm pretty
bad<00:00:59.219> at<00:00:59.280> desoldering<00:00:59.820> I<00:00:59.969> don't<00:01:00.149> want<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.329> show

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
bad at desoldering I don't want to show

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.369 
bad at desoldering I don't want to show
you<00:01:00.510> my<00:01:00.660> failure<00:01:00.960> but<00:01:02.270> moving<00:01:03.270> forward<00:01:03.480> once

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we get all these guys out of there we're

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:16.240 
we get all these guys out of there we're
going<00:01:06.570> to<00:01:07.130> be<00:01:08.130> populating<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.670> board

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.770 

all<00:01:16.640> right<00:01:16.790> so<00:01:16.910> let's<00:01:17.060> populate<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.540> board

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
all right so let's populate the board

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.810 
all right so let's populate the board
when<00:01:18.740> installing<00:01:19.040> cap<00:01:19.250> 2<00:01:19.490> there's<00:01:19.670> going<00:01:19.760> to

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
when installing cap 2 there's going to

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.270 
when installing cap 2 there's going to
be<00:01:19.880> some<00:01:20.030> gunk<00:01:20.270> and<00:01:20.510> what<00:01:20.990> I<00:01:21.020> did<00:01:21.350> is<00:01:21.530> I<00:01:21.740> just

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
be some gunk and what I did is I just

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.040 
be some gunk and what I did is I just
picked<00:01:22.490> at<00:01:22.640> it<00:01:22.790> and<00:01:22.910> pulled<00:01:23.540> it<00:01:23.660> away<00:01:23.810> it<00:01:23.900> came

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:24.050 
picked at it and pulled it away it came

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.330 
picked at it and pulled it away it came
off<00:01:24.170> pretty<00:01:24.350> easily<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:24.800> could<00:01:24.950> also<00:01:25.100> use<00:01:25.310> a

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
off pretty easily you could also use a

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.850 
off pretty easily you could also use a
razor<00:01:25.610> blade<00:01:25.790> to<00:01:25.910> peel<00:01:26.180> it<00:01:26.270> back<00:01:26.450> but<00:01:27.320> it<00:01:27.740> was

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:27.860 
razor blade to peel it back but it was

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.540 
razor blade to peel it back but it was
pretty<00:01:28.070> easy<00:01:28.250> to<00:01:28.400> get<00:01:28.550> off<00:01:30.070> but<00:01:31.070> first<00:01:31.340> I'm

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
pretty easy to get off but first I'm

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.210 
pretty easy to get off but first I'm
gonna<00:01:31.640> install<00:01:31.970> cap<00:01:32.360> 2<00:01:32.600> we're<00:01:33.229> gonna<00:01:33.290> throw

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:34.220 
gonna install cap 2 we're gonna throw

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.800 
gonna install cap 2 we're gonna throw
this<00:01:34.400> guy<00:01:34.580> in<00:01:34.729> there

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.350 

now<00:01:40.810> we're<00:01:40.900> going<00:01:41.020> to<00:01:41.080> move<00:01:41.229> on<00:01:41.380> to<00:01:42.000> diode<00:01:43.000> for

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
now we're going to move on to diode for

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:45.030 
now we're going to move on to diode for
the<00:01:43.930> one<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.290> four<00:01:44.439> it<00:01:44.530> doesn't<00:01:44.560> want<00:01:44.860> the

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
the one and four it doesn't want the

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:53.520 
the one and four it doesn't want the
inner<00:01:45.189> diode<00:01:45.520> throw<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:45.939> in<00:01:46.119> there

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:03.270

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:03.280 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:05.609 

diode<00:02:04.000> six<00:02:04.330> the<00:02:04.690> LED<00:02:04.930> wouldn't<00:02:05.229> put<00:02:05.320> that<00:02:05.350> in

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:05.619 
diode six the LED wouldn't put that in

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:11.910 
diode six the LED wouldn't put that in
there<00:02:05.770> real<00:02:05.950> quick

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.610 

you

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.820 

and<00:02:16.709> now<00:02:17.700> we're<00:02:17.940> going<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.120> install<00:02:18.420> the<00:02:18.930> 470

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
and now we're going to install the 470

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.530 
and now we're going to install the 470
ohm<00:02:20.300> resistor<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.540> our<00:02:22.050> 16<00:02:23.209> so<00:02:24.209> throw<00:02:24.450> all

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:24.540 
ohm resistor in our 16 so throw all

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:25.850 
ohm resistor in our 16 so throw all
those<00:02:24.660> guys<00:02:24.870> in<00:02:25.080> there<00:02:25.230> and<00:02:25.530> like<00:02:25.709> I<00:02:25.769> said

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
those guys in there and like I said

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.740 
those guys in there and like I said
before<00:02:26.340> we're<00:02:26.550> not<00:02:26.580> going<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.000> be<00:02:27.090> replacing

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
before we're not going to be replacing

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.690 
before we're not going to be replacing
cap<00:02:28.590> six<00:02:28.950> we're<00:02:29.160> just<00:02:29.280> going<00:02:29.400> to<00:02:29.430> remove

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
cap six we're just going to remove

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.210 
cap six we're just going to remove
component<00:02:30.300> in<00:02:30.390> there<00:02:30.599> all<00:02:31.500> right<00:02:31.890> after<00:02:32.010> that

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
component in there all right after that

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:33.680 
component in there all right after that
we're<00:02:32.310> going<00:02:32.430> to<00:02:32.519> be<00:02:32.580> soldering<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.420> new

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
we're going to be soldering the new

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:42.250 
we're going to be soldering the new
component<00:02:34.110> in

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:58.190 

you

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.050 

all<00:02:59.069> right<00:02:59.190> after<00:02:59.370> starting<00:02:59.610> those<00:02:59.700> guys<00:02:59.879> in

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
all right after starting those guys in

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.070 
all right after starting those guys in
I'm<00:03:00.180> going<00:03:00.270> to<00:03:00.330> cut<00:03:00.450> off<00:03:00.540> the<00:03:00.660> excess<00:03:00.750> wire

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
I'm going to cut off the excess wire

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.869 
I'm going to cut off the excess wire
when<00:03:01.950> cutting<00:03:02.099> off<00:03:02.250> the<00:03:02.370> excess<00:03:02.459> wire<00:03:02.819> I

00:03:02.869 --> 00:03:02.879 
when cutting off the excess wire I

00:03:02.879 --> 00:03:04.610 
when cutting off the excess wire I
usually<00:03:03.510> try<00:03:03.629> to<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.870> as<00:03:03.959> close<00:03:04.050> to<00:03:04.230> the<00:03:04.440> board

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
usually try to get as close to the board

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.800 
usually try to get as close to the board
as<00:03:04.680> possible<00:03:05.099> that<00:03:05.250> way<00:03:05.340> it<00:03:05.430> doesn't<00:03:05.810> cause

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
as possible that way it doesn't cause

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.619 
as possible that way it doesn't cause
any<00:03:07.400> contact<00:03:08.400> problem<00:03:08.910> or<00:03:09.060> continuing

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
any contact problem or continuing

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:13.309 
any contact problem or continuing
continuty<00:03:10.349> issues<00:03:11.239> so<00:03:12.239> yeah<00:03:12.989> let's<00:03:13.260> throw

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
continuty issues so yeah let's throw

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.990 
continuty issues so yeah let's throw
back<00:03:13.590> together<00:03:13.739> after<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.250> and<00:03:14.610> we're<00:03:14.790> done
