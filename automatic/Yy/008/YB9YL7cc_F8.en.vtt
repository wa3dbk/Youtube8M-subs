down<00:01:06.980> the<00:01:07.220> body<00:01:07.400> for<00:01:07.670> the<00:01:07.760> spider<00:01:08.030> and<00:01:08.380> adding

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
down the body for the spider and adding

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.560 
down the body for the spider and adding
another<00:01:09.590> cell<00:01:09.979> now<00:01:10.220> that'll<00:01:10.909> allow<00:01:11.150> us<00:01:11.180> to

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
another cell now that'll allow us to

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:13.590 
another cell now that'll allow us to
create<00:01:11.780> some<00:01:12.140> animation<00:01:12.740> for<00:01:12.920> the<00:01:13.009> spider

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
create some animation for the spider

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.760

what i'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.399 
what i'm going to do is I'm going to
take<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.189> first<00:01:16.460> cell<00:01:16.880> and<00:01:17.540> just<00:01:17.990> copy<00:01:18.200> it

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
take the first cell and just copy it

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.330 
take the first cell and just copy it
over<00:01:18.590> to<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.009> second<00:01:19.600> now<00:01:20.600> in<00:01:20.630> addition<00:01:21.320> I<00:01:21.530> can

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
over to the second now in addition I can

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.670 
over to the second now in addition I can
use<00:01:22.549> the<00:01:22.759> Move<00:01:23.000> tool<00:01:23.030> to<00:01:23.960> frame<00:01:24.229> the<00:01:24.380> spider

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
use the Move tool to frame the spider

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.520 
use the Move tool to frame the spider
again<00:01:24.890> and<00:01:25.340> in<00:01:26.060> the<00:01:26.150> second<00:01:26.540> cell<00:01:26.780> I'm<00:01:27.020> just

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:27.530 
again and in the second cell I'm just

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.859 
again and in the second cell I'm just
going<00:01:27.680> to<00:01:27.710> transpose<00:01:28.250> it<00:01:28.460> a<00:01:28.520> bit<00:01:28.759> so<00:01:29.479> that<00:01:29.509> when

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
going to transpose it a bit so that when

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:32.200 
going to transpose it a bit so that when
animated<00:01:30.439> it<00:01:30.560> gives<00:01:30.799> the<00:01:30.950> impression<00:01:31.220> of<00:01:31.520> a

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210 
animated it gives the impression of a

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.690 
animated it gives the impression of a
real<00:01:32.540> moving<00:01:33.079> spider<00:01:36.460> next<00:01:37.460> I'm<00:01:37.549> going<00:01:37.579> to

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
real moving spider next I'm going to

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.030 
real moving spider next I'm going to
grab<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.909> pan<00:01:38.270> and<00:01:38.509> use<00:01:39.049> the<00:01:39.200> color<00:01:39.380> black<00:01:39.680> to

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
grab a pan and use the color black to

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.950 
grab a pan and use the color black to
draw<00:01:40.280> in<00:01:40.340> spider<00:01:40.850> legs

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.930 

now<00:01:46.960> in<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.140> second<00:01:47.560> cell<00:01:47.800> what<00:01:48.700> I'm<00:01:48.790> going<00:01:48.910> to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
now in the second cell what I'm going to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:51.630 
now in the second cell what I'm going to
do<00:01:49.150> is<00:01:49.390> use<00:01:49.690> the<00:01:49.720> trace<00:01:50.140> tool<00:01:50.440> so<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.250> we<00:01:51.490> can

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:51.640 
do is use the trace tool so that we can

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.400 
do is use the trace tool so that we can
reference<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.270> art<00:01:52.450> from<00:01:52.720> the<00:01:52.870> first<00:01:53.110> cell

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:53.410 
reference the art from the first cell

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:55.290 
reference the art from the first cell
that<00:01:54.220> way<00:01:54.400> i'll<00:01:54.520> be<00:01:54.550> able<00:01:54.700> to<00:01:54.880> draw<00:01:55.060> in<00:01:55.210> the

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:55.300 
that way i'll be able to draw in the

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.080 
that way i'll be able to draw in the
spider<00:01:55.600> legs<00:01:55.900> to<00:01:56.740> make<00:01:56.890> them<00:01:57.100> look<00:01:57.280> like<00:01:57.610> the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
spider legs to make them look like the

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:03.870 
spider legs to make them look like the
animate<00:02:00.420> and<00:02:01.420> we<00:02:02.170> can<00:02:02.320> remove<00:02:02.620> the<00:02:03.280> trace<00:02:03.580> tool

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
animate and we can remove the trace tool

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:06.510 
animate and we can remove the trace tool
display<00:02:04.300> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.920> switching<00:02:06.340> back<00:02:06.490> and

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:06.520 
display and then switching back and

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.040 
display and then switching back and
forth<00:02:06.729> we<00:02:07.060> can<00:02:07.210> see<00:02:07.390> how<00:02:07.510> it<00:02:07.540> looks<00:02:07.750> when<00:02:07.930> it

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
forth we can see how it looks when it

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:12.660 
forth we can see how it looks when it
animates<00:02:10.530> next<00:02:11.530> i<00:02:11.590> want<00:02:11.709> to<00:02:11.860> add<00:02:11.980> an<00:02:12.190> enemy<00:02:12.490> for
