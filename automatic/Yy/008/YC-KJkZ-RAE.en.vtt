 tutorials of everything I'm going to teach you 

00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:11.810
 to make a very good joke and very 

00:00:07.129 --> 00:00:15.260
 funny that it's about turning off the pc's 

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:17.039

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:22.019

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.509
 with a file that they will send us but 

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:28.469
 by means what opens without computer goes 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:32.179
 to turn off well before youtube without more 

00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:32.179

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.650

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:02.310
 our prepared joke 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:06.460
 let's open it the second code serves 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:08.890
