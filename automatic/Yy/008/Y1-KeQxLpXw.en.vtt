stage or sorry stage ones and then

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.530 
stage or sorry stage ones and then
staged<00:03:52.750> to<00:03:53.079> look<00:03:53.109> like<00:03:53.500> like<00:03:54.280> a<00:03:54.459> 50<00:03:55.000> bars<00:03:55.209> but

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:55.540 
staged to look like like a 50 bars but

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.509 
staged to look like like a 50 bars but
it's<00:03:56.049> as<00:03:56.290> simple<00:03:56.440> as<00:03:56.709> that<00:03:56.739> it's<00:03:57.040> not<00:03:57.220> really

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
it's as simple as that it's not really

00:03:57.519 --> 00:03:59.550 
it's as simple as that it's not really
they're<00:03:58.420> not<00:03:58.450> really<00:03:58.810> weaknesses

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
they're not really weaknesses

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.170 
they're not really weaknesses
resistances<00:04:00.370> because<00:04:00.640> I<00:04:00.670> think<00:04:00.790> that<00:04:00.970> would

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:01.180 
resistances because I think that would

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.970 
resistances because I think that would
be<00:04:01.209> too<00:04:01.510> hard<00:04:01.780> but<00:04:02.109> I<00:04:02.140> might<00:04:02.440> add<00:04:02.590> those<00:04:02.829> in

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:02.980 
be too hard but I might add those in

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.349 
be too hard but I might add those in
later<00:04:03.250> but<00:04:03.730> not<00:04:03.970> too<00:04:04.299> um<00:04:05.880> not<00:04:06.880> too<00:04:07.030> complicated

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:07.359 
later but not too um not too complicated

00:04:07.359 --> 00:04:09.690 
later but not too um not too complicated
okay<00:04:07.900> and<00:04:08.140> then<00:04:08.260> here's<00:04:08.500> a<00:04:08.560> preview<00:04:09.220> of<00:04:09.579> all

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:09.700 
okay and then here's a preview of all

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.180 
okay and then here's a preview of all
the<00:04:09.850> Pokemon<00:04:10.720> I<00:04:10.930> already<00:04:11.470> did<00:04:11.620> all<00:04:11.650> the<00:04:11.980> grass

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 
the Pokemon I already did all the grass

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:14.729 
the Pokemon I already did all the grass
pokemon<00:04:12.790> so<00:04:12.970> far<00:04:13.209> so<00:04:13.480> this<00:04:13.959> is<00:04:14.170> a<00:04:14.200> whole<00:04:14.500> number

00:04:14.729 --> 00:04:14.739 
pokemon so far so this is a whole number

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:16.890
