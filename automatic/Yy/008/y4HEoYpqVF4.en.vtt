00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 step because they're going to name a few 

00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.009
 of the players that for my point of 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.629
 view 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:08.629
 we are not the invitation this varies 

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.660
 I'm going to name the goalkeepers that are 

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.660
 Gregory of the tower 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:35.090
 and he was referring 

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.420
 or not 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.840
 Zeus 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.030
 he took the verb 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.990
 ah 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.630
 that's 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.090
 said solÃ­s 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.840
 diversity 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:45.420
 why 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.420
 Alberto Tapia arrived 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:58.560
 I put him 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:02.820
 I carry solids 

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:09.780
 because they are partners that we chose 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:20.780
 There are several different ages 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:20.780
 positions and we compare it with others 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.200
 96 of our 96 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.230
 in the smaller size 

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.909
 I told you that you can not make anything 

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:38.870
 with you we can see you in the next 

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.870
 I like it 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:46.379
 the amount that we are going to put him but in 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.210
 the next next preparing and you can 

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.910
 be of those that I saw 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:52.620
 for example as are two more or less 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:54.319
 of similar characteristics in a 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:57.019
 position 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:04:02.840
 the magic portal has a little bit more of 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:04.819
 advantage and maybe you do not have to show 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.040
 in the next and so I can give example 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.219
 of several but we want to talk to 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.410
 you understand well what happens I think that 

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:13.000
 they can give 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:18.720
 How many of you felt how 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.720
 they felt good I also think that it is 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.410
 all 

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:27.440
 ask them leave them forward and that 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.840
 surely you are better than all 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.790
 here we go we have to prove it because 

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:33.110
 I also believe the requirement in the 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.880
 court to prove something not because to me 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.750
 tell me and come to our good and 

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.750
 ios is good
