00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:32.790 
know that's the range that it's in so

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.340 
know that's the range that it's in so
the<00:01:32.909> latest<00:01:33.180> thing<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.509> happened<00:01:33.900> to<00:01:34.020> me<00:01:34.049> was

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
the latest thing that happened to me was

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:39.800 
the latest thing that happened to me was
this<00:01:34.950> little<00:01:35.159> spring-loaded<00:01:36.560> clip<00:01:38.659> that<00:01:39.659> you

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
this little spring-loaded clip that you

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.410 
this little spring-loaded clip that you
use<00:01:40.079> to<00:01:40.880> adjust<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.970> angle<00:01:42.150> of<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
use to adjust the angle of the

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:45.399 
use to adjust the angle of the
downrigger<00:01:43.340> there's<00:01:44.340> a<00:01:44.430> little<00:01:44.759> metal

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:45.409 
downrigger there's a little metal

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.510 
downrigger there's a little metal
problem<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.560> comes<00:01:46.770> off<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.040> edge<00:01:47.070> of<00:01:47.369> there

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
problem that comes off the edge of there

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.569 
problem that comes off the edge of there
and<00:01:48.299> you<00:01:48.509> can<00:01:48.630> see<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.049> no<00:01:49.350> longer<00:01:49.590> have<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> metal

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
and you can see I no longer have a metal

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.249 
and you can see I no longer have a metal
prong<00:01:50.790> because<00:01:51.149> it<00:01:51.299> basically<00:01:51.630> got<00:01:51.840> rusted

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
prong because it basically got rusted

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:53.260 
prong because it basically got rusted
away

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
away

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.330 
away
so<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.990> happens<00:01:55.350> is<00:01:55.530> without<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:55.890> prong

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
so what happens is without that prong

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:58.609 
so what happens is without that prong
the<00:01:57.090> stain<00:01:57.360> just<00:01:57.390> swivels<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.200> swivels<00:01:58.530> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the stain just swivels and swivels and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.120 
the stain just swivels and swivels and
swivels<00:01:59.040> now<00:01:59.759> look<00:02:00.030> don't<00:02:00.180> lie<00:02:00.770> and<00:02:01.770> I<00:02:01.890> tried

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
swivels now look don't lie and I tried

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.100 
swivels now look don't lie and I tried
to<00:02:02.280> just<00:02:02.340> find<00:02:02.670> this<00:02:02.850> piece<00:02:03.479> and<00:02:03.810> I<00:02:03.930> never

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
to just find this piece and I never

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.249 
to just find this piece and I never
could<00:02:04.380> find<00:02:04.740> it<00:02:04.950> so<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:06.090> thought<00:02:06.659> of<00:02:06.810> a<00:02:06.899> way<00:02:07.079> that

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
could find it so I thought of a way that

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:09.139 
could find it so I thought of a way that
I<00:02:07.380> could<00:02:07.560> just<00:02:07.710> make<00:02:07.979> one<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.340> myself<00:02:08.550> and<00:02:09.000> this

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
I could just make one up myself and this

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.830 
I could just make one up myself and this
is<00:02:09.300> what<00:02:09.479> I<00:02:09.509> ended<00:02:09.690> up<00:02:09.869> with

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840 
is what I ended up with

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:19.470 
is what I ended up with
I<00:02:11.099> just<00:02:12.099> took<00:02:12.310> a<00:02:12.730> simple<00:02:13.420> nut<00:02:14.489> this<00:02:15.489> was<00:02:15.760> a<00:02:18.480> got

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
I just took a simple nut this was a got

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.330 
I just took a simple nut this was a got
the<00:02:19.599> size<00:02:19.840> of<00:02:20.050> it<00:02:20.170> but<00:02:20.349> it's<00:02:20.800> also<00:02:20.980> the

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
the size of it but it's also the

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.970 
the size of it but it's also the
matching<00:02:21.519> screw<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:23.560> the<00:02:23.680> wing<00:02:23.860> nut<00:02:24.129> on<00:02:24.160> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
matching screw what the wing nut on it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:33.869 
matching screw what the wing nut on it
so<00:02:27.330> basically<00:02:28.330> got<00:02:28.540> a<00:02:28.569> nut<00:02:32.069> and<00:02:33.069> the<00:02:33.280> screw<00:02:33.580> and

00:02:33.869 --> 00:02:33.879 
so basically got a nut and the screw and

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.770 
so basically got a nut and the screw and
the<00:02:34.629> wing<00:02:34.840> nut<00:02:35.080> is<00:02:35.290> there<00:02:36.040> to<00:02:36.730> help<00:02:36.910> you<00:02:37.209> get

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
the wing nut is there to help you get

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.220 
the wing nut is there to help you get
grip<00:02:38.019> on<00:02:38.200> it<00:02:38.379> and<00:02:38.860> what<00:02:39.099> I<00:02:39.129> did<00:02:39.430> was<00:02:39.849> I<00:02:40.230> super

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
grip on it and what I did was I super

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.770 
grip on it and what I did was I super
glued<00:02:41.349> I<00:02:41.769> rolled<00:02:42.640> this<00:02:42.790> down<00:02:43.030> about<00:02:43.360> three

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
glued I rolled this down about three

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:44.400 
glued I rolled this down about three
times

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
times

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:47.850 
times
I<00:02:44.440> put<00:02:45.250> superglue<00:02:45.579> on<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.000> threads<00:02:46.299> and<00:02:46.860> I

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:47.860 
I put superglue on the threads and I

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:49.979 
I put superglue on the threads and I
rolled<00:02:48.069> it<00:02:48.190> all<00:02:48.280> the<00:02:48.430> way<00:02:48.549> up<00:02:48.670> and<00:02:48.849> now<00:02:49.720> it's<00:02:49.930> a

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
rolled it all the way up and now it's a

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:53.100 
rolled it all the way up and now it's a
lot<00:02:50.170> what<00:02:50.500> super<00:02:50.769> glue<00:02:51.569> and<00:02:52.569> then<00:02:52.750> I<00:02:52.900> took<00:02:52.959> a

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
lot what super glue and then I took a

00:02:53.110 --> 00:03:01.050 
lot what super glue and then I took a
hammer<00:02:55.379> and<00:02:56.670> I<00:02:57.670> hammered<00:02:58.180> in<00:02:58.360> a<00:02:58.629> nut<00:02:59.319> into<00:03:00.220> that

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:01.060 
hammer and I hammered in a nut into that

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.780 
hammer and I hammered in a nut into that
hole<00:03:01.269> where<00:03:01.959> this<00:03:02.560> original<00:03:03.400> thing<00:03:03.430> here

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:03.790 
hole where this original thing here

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:11.369 
hole where this original thing here
screwed<00:03:04.060> into<00:03:05.549> so<00:03:06.549> now<00:03:06.790> I<00:03:07.680> can<00:03:08.680> take<00:03:10.379> that

00:03:11.369 --> 00:03:11.379 
screwed into so now I can take that

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:28.680 
screwed into so now I can take that
screw<00:03:11.680> a<00:03:11.709> wing<00:03:11.950> nut<00:03:14.670> screw<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.819> in

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:28.690 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.170 

a<00:03:28.750> little<00:03:29.530> bit<00:03:29.680> more<00:03:29.860> should<00:03:30.790> start<00:03:31.000> coming

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
a little bit more should start coming

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.210 
a little bit more should start coming
through<00:03:31.360> in<00:03:31.540> a<00:03:31.600> second<00:03:33.840> all<00:03:34.840> right<00:03:35.220> it's

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:36.220 
through in a second all right it's

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:39.150 
through in a second all right it's
coming<00:03:36.580> on<00:03:36.700> through<00:03:36.850> the<00:03:36.910> hole<00:03:37.090> now<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.950> you

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:39.160 
coming on through the hole now and you

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.810 
coming on through the hole now and you
can<00:03:39.310> just<00:03:39.340> screw<00:03:39.790> it<00:03:39.970> and<00:03:42.840> at<00:03:43.840> that<00:03:43.930> point<00:03:44.820> this

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:45.820 
can just screw it and at that point this

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.410 
can just screw it and at that point this
thing<00:03:45.880> is<00:03:46.180> locked<00:03:46.390> it<00:03:47.140> can't<00:03:47.440> turn<00:03:47.650> anymore

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:48.420 
thing is locked it can't turn anymore

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:52.080 
thing is locked it can't turn anymore
now<00:03:49.420> the<00:03:50.280> spring<00:03:51.280> little<00:03:51.610> one<00:03:51.730> was<00:03:51.910> better

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
now the spring little one was better

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.420 
now the spring little one was better
because<00:03:52.360> it<00:03:53.200> was<00:03:53.410> spring<00:03:53.710> out<00:03:53.890> and<00:03:54.190> then<00:03:54.310> when

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:54.430 
because it was spring out and then when

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:00.270 
because it was spring out and then when
you<00:03:54.550> turn<00:03:58.500> you<00:03:59.500> know<00:03:59.620> you<00:03:59.680> just<00:03:59.920> pull<00:04:00.160> the

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:00.280 
you turn you know you just pull the

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.270 
you turn you know you just pull the
spring<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.290> then<00:04:02.500> you<00:04:02.590> could<00:04:02.740> just<00:04:02.890> turn<00:04:03.100> the

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
spring and then you could just turn the

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.710 
spring and then you could just turn the
base<00:04:03.460> and<00:04:03.850> then<00:04:05.430> once<00:04:06.430> you<00:04:06.730> got<00:04:07.240> to<00:04:07.300> the<00:04:07.480> next

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:07.720 
base and then once you got to the next

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:09.420 
base and then once you got to the next
location<00:04:08.140> it<00:04:08.260> would<00:04:08.320> automatically<00:04:08.830> back<00:04:09.250> in

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:09.430 
location it would automatically back in

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.020 
location it would automatically back in
and<00:04:09.610> lock

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:10.030 
and lock

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.370 
and lock
well<00:04:10.450> you're<00:04:10.570> not<00:04:10.660> gonna<00:04:10.810> have<00:04:10.960> that<00:04:11.140> luxury

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
well you're not gonna have that luxury

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
about these mounts that basically got 0

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:23.690 
about these mounts that basically got 0

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:00.659 
just put a little tension on it I was
able<00:04:58.750> to<00:04:58.900> turn<00:04:59.110> it<00:04:59.259> and<00:04:59.620> still<00:04:59.919> get<00:05:00.069> snap<00:05:00.490> in

00:05:00.659 --> 00:05:00.669 
able to turn it and still get snap in

00:05:00.669 --> 00:05:04.620 
able to turn it and still get snap in
place<00:05:00.900> so<00:05:01.900> it's<00:05:02.380> not<00:05:02.530> as<00:05:02.740> good<00:05:02.949> as<00:05:03.610> the<00:05:04.330> spring

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
place so it's not as good as the spring

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:09.960 
place so it's not as good as the spring
mouse<00:05:04.870> but<00:05:05.710> it<00:05:05.830> is<00:05:06.780> cheap<00:05:08.819> inefficient<00:05:09.819> the

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
mouse but it is cheap inefficient the

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.279 
mouse but it is cheap inefficient the
whole<00:05:10.120> thing<00:05:10.360> cost<00:05:10.569> me<00:05:10.690> less<00:05:10.870> than<00:05:10.930> a<00:05:11.110> dollar

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.289 
whole thing cost me less than a dollar

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:14.240 
whole thing cost me less than a dollar
to<00:05:11.590> fix<00:05:11.860> and<00:05:12.490> it<00:05:12.669> saves<00:05:12.880> me<00:05:13.090> a<00:05:13.120> whole<00:05:13.360> lot<00:05:13.389> of

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:14.250 
to fix and it saves me a whole lot of

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:16.650 
to fix and it saves me a whole lot of
frustration<00:05:15.250> and<00:05:15.400> a<00:05:15.789> hundred<00:05:16.240> dollars<00:05:16.509> from

00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:16.660 
frustration and a hundred dollars from

00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:18.570 
frustration and a hundred dollars from
buying<00:05:16.870> another<00:05:17.139> one<00:05:17.349> because<00:05:17.470> I<00:05:17.889> only<00:05:18.280> use<00:05:18.550> my

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:18.580 
buying another one because I only use my

downriggers you know two three months

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:23.430 
downriggers you know two three months
out<00:05:21.789> of<00:05:21.819> the<00:05:21.970> year<00:05:22.270> so<00:05:23.020> I<00:05:23.080> didn't<00:05:23.259> want<00:05:23.380> to

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 
out of the year so I didn't want to

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:24.930 
out of the year so I didn't want to
spend<00:05:23.620> any<00:05:23.800> more<00:05:23.949> money<00:05:24.009> than<00:05:24.400> I<00:05:24.490> had<00:05:24.699> to<00:05:24.729> so

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
spend any more money than I had to so

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:29.129 
spend any more money than I had to so
it's<00:05:25.930> a<00:05:25.990> quick<00:05:26.199> fix<00:05:26.560> you<00:05:26.830> can<00:05:27.630> look<00:05:28.630> in<00:05:28.780> here

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:29.139 
it's a quick fix you can look in here

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:33.870 
it's a quick fix you can look in here
and<00:05:29.470> see<00:05:30.310> how<00:05:30.460> that<00:05:30.520> screw<00:05:31.259> goes<00:05:32.259> in<00:05:32.289> there<00:05:32.889> and

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
and see how that screw goes in there and

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.040 
and see how that screw goes in there and
again<00:05:34.000> you<00:05:34.210> just<00:05:35.069> screw<00:05:36.069> it<00:05:36.220> out<00:05:37.050> until

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:38.050 
again you just screw it out until

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:42.180 
again you just screw it out until
overtime<00:05:39.750> and<00:05:40.750> screw<00:05:41.409> it<00:05:41.500> a<00:05:41.560> little<00:05:41.800> bit<00:05:41.949> give

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
overtime and screw it a little bit give

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:49.280 
overtime and screw it a little bit give
it<00:05:42.220> a<00:05:42.340> little<00:05:42.460> bit<00:05:42.639> of<00:05:42.729> tension

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:49.290 

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.430 

and<00:05:50.280> it'll<00:05:50.670> kind<00:05:50.880> of<00:05:51.000> go<00:05:51.750> to<00:05:51.900> the<00:05:51.930> next<00:05:52.020> point

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
and it'll kind of go to the next point

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.470 
and it'll kind of go to the next point
and<00:05:52.620> when<00:05:53.100> you<00:05:53.190> get<00:05:53.280> there<00:05:53.520> just<00:05:53.700> screw<00:05:54.210> in<00:05:54.330> a

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:54.480 
and when you get there just screw in a

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:57.170 
and when you get there just screw in a
little<00:05:54.660> bit<00:05:54.750> more<00:05:55.430> to<00:05:56.430> give<00:05:56.580> yourself<00:05:56.910> a<00:05:57.000> good

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
little bit more to give yourself a good

little bit more to give yourself a good
