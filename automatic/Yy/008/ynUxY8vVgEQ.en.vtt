this scale or all of our scales the tare

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.970 
this scale or all of our scales the tare
mode<00:01:24.420> what<00:01:25.420> that<00:01:25.570> is<00:01:25.750> is<00:01:25.960> that<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.140> the<00:01:26.740> scale

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:26.980

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.430 
mode what that is is that the the scale
will<00:01:27.130> be<00:01:27.160> able<00:01:27.340> to<00:01:27.610> measure<00:01:28.360> excuse<00:01:29.080> me<00:01:29.230> to

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
will be able to measure excuse me to

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:30.990 
will be able to measure excuse me to
weigh<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:30.070> ingredients<00:01:30.550> in<00:01:30.670> your<00:01:30.760> bowl

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:31.000 
weigh the ingredients in your bowl

without<00:01:31.540> measuring<00:01:32.140> the<00:01:32.350> bowl<00:01:32.500> so<00:01:32.830> you'll

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
without measuring the bowl so you'll

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.400 
without measuring the bowl so you'll
just<00:01:32.980> get<00:01:33.460> the<00:01:33.580> weight<00:01:33.760> of<00:01:33.970> the<00:01:34.090> food<00:01:34.300> so<00:01:35.110> what

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
just get the weight of the food so what

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:38.400 
just get the weight of the food so what
I'm<00:01:35.500> gonna<00:01:35.620> do<00:01:35.860> is<00:01:36.070> it's<00:01:36.730> on<00:01:37.030> you<00:01:38.020> put<00:01:38.170> the<00:01:38.260> bowl

I'm gonna do is it's on you put the bowl
on<00:01:38.650> top<00:01:38.710> of<00:01:39.100> the<00:01:39.250> the<00:01:40.150> scale<00:01:40.480> you<00:01:40.960> hit<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.320> tare

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
on top of the the scale you hit the tare

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.920 
on top of the the scale you hit the tare
mode<00:01:43.380> which<00:01:44.380> then<00:01:44.650> turns<00:01:44.980> to<00:01:45.130> zero<00:01:45.400> and<00:01:46.000> then

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 
mode which then turns to zero and then

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.170 
mode which then turns to zero and then
what<00:01:47.200> you<00:01:47.290> do<00:01:47.470> is<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:48.340> add<00:01:48.520> your<00:01:48.730> ingredients

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.320 

and<00:01:53.250> then<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:54.310> weight<00:01:54.460> on<00:01:54.610> the<00:01:54.730> scale<00:01:54.970> is<00:01:55.180> the

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:55.330 
and then the weight on the scale is the

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:58.290 
and then the weight on the scale is the
weight<00:01:55.540> of<00:01:55.570> the<00:01:56.560> actual<00:01:57.460> food<00:01:57.700> of<00:01:58.030> your
