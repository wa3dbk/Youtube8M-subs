get for typically under $150 or under
$100<00:00:54.930> sometimes<00:00:55.730> so<00:00:56.730> let's<00:00:57.270> go<00:00:57.420> over<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
$100 sometimes so let's go over the

$100 sometimes so let's go over the
specifications<00:00:59.030> quickly<00:01:00.030> so<00:01:00.300> we've<00:01:00.480> got<00:01:00.690> a

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
specifications quickly so we've got a

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.709 
specifications quickly so we've got a
fairly<00:01:01.020> substantial<00:01:01.910> 41<00:01:02.910> millimeter<00:01:03.420> case

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
fairly substantial 41 millimeter case

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:06.410 
fairly substantial 41 millimeter case
which<00:01:04.049> is<00:01:04.320> of<00:01:04.860> course<00:01:05.220> as<00:01:05.489> most<00:01:05.820> watches<00:01:06.270> in

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
which is of course as most watches in

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.850 
which is of course as most watches in
this<00:01:06.540> range<00:01:06.810> brush<00:01:07.710> stainless<00:01:08.189> steel<00:01:08.780> we<00:01:09.780> have

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
this range brush stainless steel we have

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.090 
this range brush stainless steel we have
22<00:01:10.860> millimeter<00:01:11.400> lugs<00:01:12.119> spacing<00:01:12.810> and<00:01:13.100> 14

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
22 millimeter lugs spacing and 14

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.310 
22 millimeter lugs spacing and 14
millimeter<00:01:14.700> width<00:01:16.610> so<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:17.970> also<00:01:18.330> have<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:18.780> screw

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
millimeter width so we also have a screw

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.740 
millimeter width so we also have a screw
down<00:01:19.549> display<00:01:20.549> case<00:01:20.939> back<00:01:21.210> so<00:01:21.450> you<00:01:21.509> can<00:01:21.689> see

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
down display case back so you can see

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.260 
down display case back so you can see
the<00:01:22.189> unfortunately<00:01:23.189> unfinished<00:01:23.850> movement

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:24.270 
the unfortunately unfinished movement

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.270 
the unfortunately unfinished movement
but<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.140> course<00:01:25.290> to<00:01:25.470> be<00:01:25.560> expected<00:01:26.070> at

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
but that's of course to be expected at

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.700 
but that's of course to be expected at
the<00:01:26.460> price<00:01:26.729> point<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.299> it's<00:01:28.110> a<00:01:28.290> fairly

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the price point and it's a fairly

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.210 
the price point and it's a fairly
substantial<00:01:29.100> weight<00:01:29.790> similar<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.900> the<00:01:31.220> Mako

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220

and yeah so I guess this was loosely
based<00:02:12.170> on<00:02:12.650> it<00:02:12.860> and<00:02:13.280> I<00:02:13.550> guess<00:02:13.879> the<00:02:14.690> watch<00:02:14.930> fans

00:02:30.699 --> 00:02:30.709 
accomplished nothing you'll see that it

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.110 
accomplished nothing you'll see that it
does<00:02:30.890> have<00:02:31.130> your<00:02:31.280> kind<00:02:31.430> of<00:02:31.550> standard<00:02:31.760> dye

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:32.120 
does have your kind of standard dye

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.890 
does have your kind of standard dye
style<00:02:33.099> unidirectional<00:02:34.099> rotating<00:02:34.580> bezel<00:02:34.900> it

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
style unidirectional rotating bezel it

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.199 
style unidirectional rotating bezel it
only<00:02:36.530> has<00:02:36.799> a<00:02:36.830> hundred<00:02:37.160> meters<00:02:37.670> of<00:02:37.940> water

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
only has a hundred meters of water

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.490 
only has a hundred meters of water
resistance<00:02:38.390> so<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:38.959> isn't<00:02:39.260> a<00:02:39.319> true

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500 
resistance so this isn't a true

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.390 
resistance so this isn't a true
diastolic

you<00:03:21.769> know<00:03:21.859> I<00:03:21.889> tend<00:03:22.250> to<00:03:22.340> see<00:03:22.549> about<00:03:22.639> plus<00:03:23.030> eight

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:23.269 
you know I tend to see about plus eight

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:25.750 
you know I tend to see about plus eight
seconds<00:03:23.720> a<00:03:23.780> day<00:03:24.010> which<00:03:25.010> you<00:03:25.040> know<00:03:25.280> is<00:03:25.430> pretty

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
seconds a day which you know is pretty

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.229 
seconds a day which you know is pretty
good<00:03:25.940> I<00:03:26.359> think<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.750> can<00:03:27.139> be<00:03:27.290> rated<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.769> be

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 
good I think that can be rated to be

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:31.090 
good I think that can be rated to be
much<00:03:29.239> less<00:03:29.450> accurate<00:03:29.840> than<00:03:29.930> that<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.350> it's

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:31.100 
much less accurate than that so it's

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.860 
much less accurate than that so it's
great<00:03:31.250> to<00:03:31.310> see<00:03:31.400> that<00:03:31.549> they<00:03:32.060> do<00:03:32.120> a<00:03:32.239> pretty<00:03:32.690> well

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:32.870 
great to see that they do a pretty well

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.229 
great to see that they do a pretty well
there<00:03:33.049> it<00:03:33.650> also<00:03:33.829> has<00:03:34.040> a<00:03:34.069> three<00:03:34.340> o'clock<00:03:34.430> date

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
there it also has a three o'clock date

so<00:05:29.710> it's<00:05:29.860> not<00:05:29.949> the<00:05:30.099> Sapphire<00:05:30.460> of<00:05:30.550> course<00:05:30.759> but

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:30.969 
so it's not the Sapphire of course but

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:32.219 
so it's not the Sapphire of course but
you<00:05:31.060> know<00:05:31.089> you<00:05:31.389> wouldn't<00:05:31.509> expect<00:05:31.810> that<00:05:31.900> for

00:05:32.219 --> 00:05:32.229 
you know you wouldn't expect that for

00:05:32.229 --> 00:05:34.050 
you know you wouldn't expect that for
whatching<00:05:32.620> in<00:05:32.800> this<00:05:32.949> price<00:05:33.190> range

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
whatching in this price range

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.640 
whatching in this price range
a<00:05:34.089> little<00:05:34.569> bit<00:05:34.659> of<00:05:34.750> distortion<00:05:34.900> when<00:05:35.379> you<00:05:35.469> kind

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:35.650 
a little bit of distortion when you kind

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:36.899 
a little bit of distortion when you kind
of<00:05:35.710> get<00:05:35.800> down<00:05:35.830> the<00:05:36.039> edge<00:05:36.129> here's<00:05:36.460> but<00:05:36.669> you<00:05:36.819> know

00:05:36.899 --> 00:05:36.909 
of get down the edge here's but you know

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.570 
of get down the edge here's but you know
overall<00:05:37.210> pretty<00:05:37.539> good<00:05:37.680> obviously<00:05:38.680> not<00:05:38.860> a<00:05:39.190> are

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:39.580 
overall pretty good obviously not a are

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.430 
overall pretty good obviously not a are
