00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
to be cleaned I would recommend washing

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.890

them the night before but like I said
about<00:03:17.230> sense<00:03:17.590> they<00:03:18.310> can<00:03:18.519> irritate<00:03:18.850> people<00:03:19.360> and

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
about sense they can irritate people and

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:21.360 
about sense they can irritate people and
you<00:03:19.690> might<00:03:19.959> be<00:03:20.170> overlooking<00:03:20.470> the<00:03:21.010> fact<00:03:21.250> that

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:21.370 
you might be overlooking the fact that

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.640 
you might be overlooking the fact that
your<00:03:21.550> laundry<00:03:22.060> detergent<00:03:22.600> has<00:03:22.750> a<00:03:22.810> scent<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.440> it

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
your laundry detergent has a scent to it

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.650 
your laundry detergent has a scent to it
so<00:03:23.950> for<00:03:24.310> a<00:03:24.340> laundry<00:03:24.670> detergent<00:03:25.209> I<00:03:25.269> really<00:03:25.480> like

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:25.660 
so for a laundry detergent I really like

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.960 
so for a laundry detergent I really like
the<00:03:25.810> Tide<00:03:26.050> Pods<00:03:26.080> free<00:03:26.830> and<00:03:26.980> gentle<00:03:27.400> and<00:03:27.640> the

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:27.970 
the Tide Pods free and gentle and the

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:29.490 
the Tide Pods free and gentle and the
free<00:03:28.180> and<00:03:28.300> gentle<00:03:28.660> one<00:03:28.750> is<00:03:28.900> good<00:03:29.110> because<00:03:29.380> it

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:29.500 
free and gentle one is good because it

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.410 
free and gentle one is good because it
doesn't<00:03:29.830> have<00:03:29.950> any<00:03:29.980> dyes<00:03:30.370> or<00:03:30.580> perfumes<00:03:30.760> in<00:03:31.269> it

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
doesn't have any dyes or perfumes in it

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.449 
doesn't have any dyes or perfumes in it
so<00:03:31.959> your<00:03:32.380> clothes<00:03:32.680> aren't<00:03:32.980> going<00:03:33.190> to<00:03:33.280> have<00:03:33.400> a

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:33.459 
so your clothes aren't going to have a

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:35.310 
so your clothes aren't going to have a
scent<00:03:33.760> I<00:03:33.940> like<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.540> little<00:03:34.720> pods<00:03:35.019> because

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:35.320 
scent I like the little pods because

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:37.170 
scent I like the little pods because
they're<00:03:35.530> really<00:03:35.769> convenient<00:03:36.160> to<00:03:36.459> use<00:03:36.700> you

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
just put them in your washing machine

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.289 
just put them in your washing machine

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:44.100 
then along with that I like to use the
downy<00:03:42.280> free<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:42.880> gentle<00:03:43.239> fabric<00:03:43.690> softener

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.990 
downy free and gentle fabric softener
this<00:03:44.440> is<00:03:44.590> also<00:03:44.950> free<00:03:45.280> of<00:03:45.489> dyes<00:03:45.700> and<00:03:45.880> perfumes

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:50.070
