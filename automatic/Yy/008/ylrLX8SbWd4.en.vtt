00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.650
 paragraph 1 

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.269
 leak test according to uni 71 29 

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.319
 on new installations 

00:00:13.319 --> 00:00:16.599
 according to the new norm uni 71 29 

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:20.459
 before commissioning an internal gas distribution system 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.279
 the installer must test the tightness 

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:29.119
 let's see how the test is carried out on a newly installed system 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:30.380
 where the gas 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:32.580
 has not yet been used 

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:37.790
 before starting the test let's see how to prepare the seal seven connect the 

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.790
 hand pump to their ball pinewood 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.930
 connect the connection on the filter side 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:47.930
 to the left connector of the instrument 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:56.410
 connect the colic or threaded sealing fitting to the quick-release coupling of the 

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:59.410
 rubber hose 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.860
 insert the fitting 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.630
 threaded ooh tonic 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:06.480
 at any point in the system 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.480
 let's move on to the procedure for using the tool 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.040
 the instrument 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.549
 the first time we use it we must set the time and date 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.329
 press the struma button 

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:22.490
 is the ok button 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.600
 then press the modified button to enter the date input menu 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.640
 set the values ​​using the arrow keys 

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.640
 is the ok button to confirm 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.270
 press the end key twice to exit 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:42.860
 now highlight the menu control item 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.570
 press ok twice 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.080
 highlight without and confirm with ok 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:57.410
 now press ok to enter the line type menu 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.410
 highlight without 

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:04.140
 press ok 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.610
 the test menu is simplified 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:09.569
 return to the main menu 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.569
 pressing fishing 

00:02:14.149 --> 00:02:17.939
 press ok to enter the uni 71 menu 

00:02:19.149 --> 00:02:23.659
 set the test times only when the instrument is used for the first time 

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:25.579
 pressing taxes 

00:02:25.579 --> 00:02:28.829
 select stabilization time 

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:31.859
 and press ok 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.279
 . type 15 with the arrow keys 

00:02:35.279 --> 00:02:38.579
 press the ok button and confirm the border 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.959
 perform the same perimenw measurement duration 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:45.279
 press esc 

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:48.279
 to return to the test start screen 

00:02:50.559 --> 00:02:55.519
 introduce air into the system using the bulb supplied 

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.549
 up to a pressure between 100 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.759
 and 150 thousand bar 

00:03:00.759 --> 00:03:02.729
 oo chest pascal 

00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:05.089
 once the required pressure is reached 

00:03:05.089 --> 00:03:10.289
 close the ball valve so as to avoid any leaks from the 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:11.929
 pump 

00:03:11.929 --> 00:03:16.109
 and press start to start the stabilization time timer 

00:03:16.659 --> 00:03:20.019
 15 minutes 

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:24.530
 at the end of the 15 minutes the instrument will now register the value of the first one 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:25.739
 reading 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:29.139
 the beginning of the actual test 

00:03:29.139 --> 00:03:32.589
 the timer will then start another 15 minutes 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.229
 at the end of which 

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:39.379
 the second reading will also appear on the display 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:41.379
 the one at the end of the test 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:44.379
 and the pressure difference between the two 

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:50.289
 it is possible to document the result of the test with the help of the printer 

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:52.159
 selecting maema 

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:55.129
 and pressing the print button 

00:03:55.129 --> 00:03:58.589
 it is also possible to make multiple prints of the same receipt 

00:03:59.129 --> 00:04:02.129
 by pressing the print button again 

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:06.980
 test result is positive if the pressure difference value is 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.980
 greater ooooh guale azzaro, 0 

00:04:10.869 --> 00:04:13.360
 if instead this negative value 

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.920
 the test will also fail
