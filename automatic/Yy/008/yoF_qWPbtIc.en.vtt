00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.480
 hello everyone offers you 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.970
 today in my nail art tutorial 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.590
 a fantasy executed with the technique 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:19.830
 troc ounce paint 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.480
 I tried to simplify it so that 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:23.130
 everyone manages to make his 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.869
 first steps I do not say more 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.580
 I stop talking and I present 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.130
 immediately the tutorial 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.109
 in just now for this tutorial 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:36.230
 troy ounce we're going to need a 

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:39.420
 square brush of an artists palette 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:43.399
 clear water and acrylic paint 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.399
 in the colors of your choice 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.450
 I take my palette of artists and I 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:50.610
 come to pass painting disappointed me if 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.489
 I chose the white and the dark purple 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:57.510
 for is not created good contrast between 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.850
 two colors then I quench my 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.860
 brush in the water and I come to the sponge 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.329
 to remove the excess water here I 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.899
 only want the brush to be 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.550
 wet 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:08.399
 nothing more I'm enjoying this moment 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:12.840
 to smooth out the brush and make sure that 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:16.110
 the hairs are well smooth now the 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:18.470
 loading the brush I'm going to soak the 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:22.229
 brush corner in the first color 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.240
 and the second in the other color if 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.539
 you look good this gives pretty much 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:29.729
 half bad half white I come 

00:01:27.539 --> 00:01:32.910
 now on my palette crack the 

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:36.060
 two colors together so I make sure 

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:39.060
 to remove the surplus and that the 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.670
 colors are well fuse I repeat 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.440
 this step 2 or 3 times to make sure 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.509
 that the brush hairs are well 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:49.830
 filled with paint before starting 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:51.899
 my drawing to understand the 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:54.360
 gesture I invite you to come 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:57.539
 draw on a sheet using a 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.270
 pencil zigzag lines so low 

00:01:57.539 --> 00:02:03.030
 which will make you understand the gesture to 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.920
 run with the brush 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.920
 I loaded my paintbrush 

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:09.899
 so I come to draw the exams 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.480
 as if I had in my hands the 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.959
 pencil as I showed you everything to 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.150
 the time here is it you determine 

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:21.040
 the space between the brushstrokes 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.720
 look at the examples 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.300
 for the second example I have everything 

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.730
 simply let go of the zig zag 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:32.840
 which gives me a little more waves 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.850
 great simply in the third 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.830
 example I just tighten 

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:38.210
 the zig zag if you look at the 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:41.600
 race is very short 

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:43.370
 between each brush stroke ah yes for 

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.170
 facilitate the shooting of the video I 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:48.230
 decided to work on the grounds that 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:50.120
 bhl printed on plain paper so 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.220
 to make your job easier I 

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.500
 suggest coming draw the points of 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:58.760
 benchmark from where your petals start and 

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.420
 where it ends just like the hand of 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:01.670
 the client 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.270
 I place my leaf in a good angle 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:06.740
 to be able to work easily 

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:09.530
 I make sure my brush is fine 

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:12.290
 loaded and I just started the gesture of 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.150
 zig zag at the first landmark and 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.890
 I come to join the second 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.930
 do not forget to turn the 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.590
 brush to round the petal this will 

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.590
 much prettier 

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:28.260
 just like the hand of the client 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.510
 turn the sheet for a better 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:33.300
 angle and now you can start 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:36.330
 the second beta hall where is the 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.850
 second benchmarks therefore this is the 

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:40.830
 end of the first petal look well 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:43.830
 if you could not vote on 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.230
 brush the petal will be more square one 

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:48.540
 little bit less pretty but still not 

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:51.310
 if worse than that 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:53.260
 once again turned the sheet for 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.900
 find a better angle and now 

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:58.720
 I did not start the third table in 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.520
 passing do not look for perfection he 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.880
 remember the beauties of nature 

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:05.470
 were born from imperfection 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:07.330
 when you finish drawing 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:09.130
 the petals of the flower some options 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:11.140
 available to you to come and create his 

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:13.720
 center be that you do like me 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:16.209
 place a few points in the 2nd round you 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:18.340
 can come be glued in rhinestones or 

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:19.970
 simply fill the center of 

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:23.000
 White 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.770
 the flora and finish here to complete 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.520
 the fancy the thresholds your 

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:27.530
 imagination 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.750
 I simply decided 

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.940
 to add petals that have 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.980
 detached from the flower and some points 

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:37.040
 blanks to occupy the empty space but 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:41.320
 without too much case load and that's your 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.320
 first steps in one strike 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:47.090
 with this painting technique he is 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.629
 possible to create chicks to cut the 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.909
 breath 

00:04:47.629 --> 00:04:51.979
 but remember that you will need 

00:04:49.909 --> 00:04:53.000
 time and practice to master 

00:04:51.979 --> 00:04:55.520
 the art of painting 

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.440
 you must place saÃ´ne and loire after 

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:59.870
 the image of the technique and for the 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:01.669
 protect you have to come and apply a 

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.440
 brush gel layer that you will do 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:04.280
 harden with a catalyst in 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.699
 spray 

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:10.909
 once dry a light sanding and you 

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:12.860
 are ready for your finishing steps I 

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:15.979
 believe that I learn nothing but fon himself 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.500
 say a fantasy executed or in stroke 

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.409
 never leave anyone indifferent 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.599
 face the beauty and the execution of this 

00:05:21.409 --> 00:05:26.780
 very complex work like our 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:28.340
