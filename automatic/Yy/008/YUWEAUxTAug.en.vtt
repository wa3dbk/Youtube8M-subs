switch easy numbers case you simply go

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.940 
switch easy numbers case you simply go
bottom<00:00:34.200> side<00:00:34.410> first<00:00:36.500> unlock<00:00:37.500> it<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.770> place

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:37.950 
bottom side first unlock it in place

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:39.830 
bottom side first unlock it in place
like<00:00:38.160> so<00:00:38.370> the<00:00:38.940> reason<00:00:39.059> I<00:00:39.239> go<00:00:39.390> bottom<00:00:39.660> side

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
like so the reason I go bottom side

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
like so the reason I go bottom side
first<00:00:40.079> it's<00:00:40.290> good<00:00:40.469> this<00:00:40.620> case<00:00:40.829> does<00:00:41.190> come

wake button are made out of the same
material<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.049> I<00:01:16.320> was<00:01:16.439> able<00:01:16.590> to<00:01:16.830> same<00:01:17.009> design

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:17.630 
material and I was able to same design

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:19.850 
material and I was able to same design
one<00:01:18.630> issue<00:01:18.869> I<00:01:18.900> had<00:01:19.080> with<00:01:19.110> this<00:01:19.350> is<00:01:19.530> that<00:01:19.710> the

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
one issue I had with this is that the

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.890 
one issue I had with this is that the
material<00:01:20.220> to<00:01:20.310> used<00:01:20.490> is<00:01:20.610> real<00:01:20.790> thick<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.810> do

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
material to used is real thick so you do

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.450 
material to used is real thick so you do
have<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.170> put<00:01:22.409> a<00:01:22.439> little<00:01:22.740> bit<00:01:22.860> more<00:01:23.189> effort

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
have to put a little bit more effort

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:26.570 
have to put a little bit more effort
into<00:01:23.850> pressing<00:01:24.570> it<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:25.799> case<00:01:26.009> does<00:01:26.250> feature<00:01:26.430> a

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
into pressing it the case does feature a

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:27.859 
into pressing it the case does feature a
little<00:01:26.820> bit<00:01:26.909> of<00:01:27.000> laid<00:01:27.180> on<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> table<00:01:27.479> design

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
little bit of laid on the table design

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.690 
little bit of laid on the table design
I'm<00:01:28.619> not<00:01:28.799> sure<00:01:29.009> how<00:01:29.159> well<00:01:29.310> you<00:01:29.369> can<00:01:29.490> see<00:01:29.549> that

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
I'm not sure how well you can see that

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.149 
I'm not sure how well you can see that
because<00:01:30.150> of<00:01:30.600> the<00:01:30.630> color<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.380> the<00:01:31.500> case<00:01:31.680> but<00:01:31.920> you

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159 
because of the color of the case but you

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:34.100 
because of the color of the case but you
will<00:01:32.340> be<00:01:32.490> able<00:01:32.549> to<00:01:32.729> place<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.329> device<00:01:33.570> screen

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
will be able to place your device screen

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.130 
will be able to place your device screen
side<00:01:34.350> down<00:01:34.560> with<00:01:34.890> no<00:01:35.070> problems<00:01:35.990> my<00:01:36.990> only

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
side down with no problems my only

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020 
side down with no problems my only
problem<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.740> case<00:01:37.890> is<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.310> left<00:01:38.610> side

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
problem with the case is this left side

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.880 
problem with the case is this left side
of<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.360> case<00:01:39.540> just<00:01:39.780> feel<00:01:40.140> a<00:01:40.170> little<00:01:40.380> bit<00:01:40.530> loose

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
of the case just feel a little bit loose

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:44.120 
of the case just feel a little bit loose
so<00:01:41.930> you<00:01:42.930> don't<00:01:43.110> you<00:01:43.290> don't<00:01:43.500> feel<00:01:43.890> like<00:01:43.920> you

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
so you don't you don't feel like you

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:47.200 
so you don't you don't feel like you
have<00:01:44.159> all<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.670> protection<00:01:45.119> but<00:01:45.829> it<00:01:46.829> should<00:01:46.979> be

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
have all the protection but it should be

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:50.149 
have all the protection but it should be
to<00:01:48.210> worrying<00:01:48.479> because<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:49.110> does<00:01:49.320> drive

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
to worrying because it does drive

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:53.359 
to worrying because it does drive
protection<00:01:51.560> overall<00:01:52.560> I<00:01:52.590> really<00:01:52.680> do<00:01:53.009> like<00:01:53.220> to

00:01:53.359 --> 00:01:53.369 
protection overall I really do like to

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:55.069 
protection overall I really do like to
switch<00:01:53.579> easy<00:01:53.820> numbers<00:01:54.119> case<00:01:54.299> the<00:01:54.840> feel<00:01:55.049> and

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
switch easy numbers case the feel and

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.749 
switch easy numbers case the feel and
simplistic<00:01:55.590> design<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:56.189> me<00:01:56.280> really<00:01:56.460> hits<00:01:56.670> it

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
simplistic design for me really hits it

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.480 
simplistic design for me really hits it
out<00:01:56.820> of<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:56.969> ballpark<00:01:57.380> for<00:01:58.380> 1499<00:01:58.950> you<00:01:59.250> really

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490 
out of the ballpark for 1499 you really

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.889 
out of the ballpark for 1499 you really
can't<00:01:59.700> go<00:01:59.820> wrong<00:01:59.850> with<00:02:00.240> getting<00:02:00.360> yourself<00:02:00.780> as

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
can't go wrong with getting yourself as

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.300 
can't go wrong with getting yourself as
to<00:02:00.990> achieve<00:02:01.079> these<00:02:01.290> numbers<00:02:01.619> case<00:02:01.829> if<00:02:02.159> you

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
to achieve these numbers case if you

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.950 
to achieve these numbers case if you
would<00:02:02.430> like<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.700> view<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.909> case<00:02:03.329> check<00:02:03.780> down

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
would like to view this case check down
