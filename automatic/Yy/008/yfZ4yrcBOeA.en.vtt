00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:05.180
 hello how about youtube friends like this 

00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:06.560
 not some good boyfriend friends 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.139
 is usually some way that many people 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.790
 they have asked that it was for commands so 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:12.650
 the cute will find in the section of 

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.900
 video and then before I start I want to 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:16.790
 make a clarification because we are 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.790
 will work for all 0.9 

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.010
 example either point 6 points 7 or 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.140
 the other updates so let's go 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.390
 to start with the installation we click 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.710
 in the key blog options 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:33.190
 launcher we search where mod script says 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:36.230
 we give import local storage 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:39.350
 select the download folder and then 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.260
 here the basic file mans or commands 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:44.559
 basic as they want to give in saying 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.559
 let's go back 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.870
 and as you can see, a 

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:51.589
 very easy way now let's start 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.589
 with the meeting 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.940
 Well, as you can imagine, 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.200
 this mod consists of commands and then I 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.570
 Most of them I will leave in the 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.120
 video fictions but the truth is very 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:08.240
 easy what we want because we have to 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:10.510
 write it in English example poetry 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.020
 and it becomes day 

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:16.020
 today let's do it let's change to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.020
 creative 

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.130
 and so with everyone as much as they want 

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.280
 but in English 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:29.480
 but I think you can only day night 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.310
 just change as the essential 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.500
 so how can they work very well 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.740
 let's change it fast to day because I 

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.740
 they are going to kill 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.250
 and it did not grow or anything 

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.789
 thus dissolved the creative that does not 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.789
 they mean 

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:52.010
 Well it's martin de wells and very good and 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:52.010

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.850
