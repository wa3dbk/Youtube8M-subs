00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
the whole dynamic of working in a

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.360 
the whole dynamic of working in a

does the first part it is assembling of
the<00:05:48.720> dish<00:05:49.009> you<00:05:50.009> grab<00:05:50.190> our<00:05:50.340> risotto<00:05:50.639> cake<00:05:50.970> I

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:51.210 
the dish you grab our risotto cake I

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:53.629 
the dish you grab our risotto cake I
would<00:05:51.720> be<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.870> rutabaga<00:05:52.370> because<00:05:53.370> it<00:05:53.490> always

00:05:53.629 --> 00:05:53.639 
would be a rutabaga because it always

00:05:53.639 --> 00:05:57.270 
would be a rutabaga because it always
wanted<00:05:53.940> to<00:05:54.000> have<00:05:54.090> purple<00:05:54.479> hair

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.480 

this<00:05:57.820> goes<00:05:58.030> in<00:05:58.060> the<00:05:58.330> center<00:05:58.660> of<00:05:58.690> the<00:05:58.780> dish<00:05:58.990> and

00:05:59.480 --> 00:05:59.490 
this goes in the center of the dish and

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:01.740 
this goes in the center of the dish and
the<00:06:00.490> reason<00:06:00.730> we<00:06:00.820> form<00:06:01.030> these<00:06:01.180> risotto<00:06:01.510> cakes

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:01.750 
the reason we form these risotto cakes

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:03.090 
the reason we form these risotto cakes
as<00:06:01.870> well<00:06:02.050> as<00:06:02.200> so<00:06:02.380> they<00:06:02.590> can<00:06:02.770> hold<00:06:02.980> the<00:06:03.070> weight

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:03.100 
as well as so they can hold the weight

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.950 
as well as so they can hold the weight
of<00:06:03.430> the<00:06:03.639> fish<00:06:03.820> and<00:06:04.150> so<00:06:04.570> the<00:06:04.660> balances<00:06:05.050> on<00:06:05.200> top

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:06.960 
of the fish and so the balances on top

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:15.350 
of the fish and so the balances on top
we've<00:06:07.960> got<00:06:08.139> our<00:06:08.320> salmon

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.719 

we<00:06:15.509> will<00:06:15.629> just<00:06:15.750> place<00:06:15.990> this<00:06:16.169> right<00:06:16.439> on<00:06:16.710> top<00:06:17.129> now

00:06:17.719 --> 00:06:17.729 
we will just place this right on top now

00:06:17.729 --> 00:06:19.839 
we will just place this right on top now
we'll<00:06:17.939> see<00:06:18.150> i'll<00:06:18.449> use<00:06:18.629> my<00:06:18.659> saves<00:06:19.139> uptake<00:06:19.590> and

00:06:19.839 --> 00:06:19.849 
we'll see i'll use my saves uptake and

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:22.640 
we'll see i'll use my saves uptake and
Hannah's<00:06:20.849> healthy<00:06:21.180> way<00:06:21.569> to<00:06:21.599> get<00:06:22.229> the<00:06:22.349> flavor

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
Hannah's healthy way to get the flavor

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.990 
Hannah's healthy way to get the flavor
of<00:06:23.009> the<00:06:23.759> salmon<00:06:24.469> top<00:06:25.469> of<00:06:25.680> the<00:06:25.800> dish<00:06:25.949> and<00:06:26.280> this

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
of the salmon top of the dish and this

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.420 
of the salmon top of the dish and this
is<00:06:27.150> also<00:06:27.300> the<00:06:27.419> heat<00:06:27.659> up<00:06:27.750> this<00:06:28.129> saves<00:06:29.129> a<00:06:29.219> little

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:29.430 
is also the heat up this saves a little

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:30.619 
is also the heat up this saves a little
time<00:06:29.610> in<00:06:29.729> the<00:06:29.789> kitchen<00:06:29.909> because<00:06:30.270> using<00:06:30.449> the

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:30.629 
time in the kitchen because using the

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:32.929 
time in the kitchen because using the
same<00:06:30.840> pan<00:06:31.050> and<00:06:31.710> it<00:06:31.830> also<00:06:31.979> gets<00:06:32.460> more<00:06:32.669> flavor

00:06:32.929 --> 00:06:32.939 
same pan and it also gets more flavor

00:06:32.939 --> 00:06:34.369 
same pan and it also gets more flavor
into<00:06:33.240> the<00:06:33.330> sauce<00:06:33.539> when<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:33.960> get<00:06:34.080> the<00:06:34.139> flavor

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:34.379 
into the sauce when you get the flavor

00:06:34.379 --> 00:06:36.619 
into the sauce when you get the flavor
of<00:06:34.469> the<00:06:34.620> kid<00:06:34.949> and<00:06:35.610> it<00:06:35.759> can<00:06:36.000> it<00:06:36.120> hit<00:06:36.270> your<00:06:36.419> sauce

00:06:36.619 --> 00:06:36.629 
of the kid and it can it hit your sauce

00:06:36.629 --> 00:06:37.969

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
reduce down a little bit and this just

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.820 
reduce down a little bit and this just
goes<00:06:47.070> directly<00:06:47.490> over<00:06:47.970> the<00:06:48.000> top<00:06:48.240> of<00:06:48.420> the<00:06:48.480> fish
