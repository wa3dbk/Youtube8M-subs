00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.320
 It also includes the first delivery of

 discount for the enrolled ace and the 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.660
 brotherhood this has to be done to 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.450
 through history 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:54.489
 and good because of this we can see what 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:57.820
 which contains the box part in which 

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:59.650
 includes an encyclopedia a cedÃ© de 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.989
 soundtracks is worth where we are caught 

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:04.540
 the best topics of what has been the 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:07.540
 saga either of the inscribed 112 brother 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.420
 jubeto revelations and a short film 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.920
 called envers in what will happen to 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.900
 end of assassin's creed 3 os what 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.030
 I recommend everyone apart as 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.940
 additional content in the game comes 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.580
 a mission that is the mission of the 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:24.100
 prison on one side the emperor the 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:27.070
 armor the gross armor that is the 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.320
 that we used in brotherhood and then 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:32.289
 a couple of improvements whether those in the 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:35.800
 pistol bullets bombs and crossbow what 

00:01:32.289 --> 00:01:37.590
 that what it implies is therefore to have greater 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.130
 amount of 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.780
 of units and apart two dolls two 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.000
 characters for the multiplayer mode the 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:46.610
 which is the crusader and the Ottoman jester 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.560
 but of guardamar 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:52.000
 let's open the box a little so that 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.000
 You can see it a bit 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:00.960
 a second this is complicated to do 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:05.370
 with a pair when it's on one side we have 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:07.980
 the box does not look very good but good 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:11.330
 here the cover 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.760
 it tells us that the judgment 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:16.970
 well I do not know very well but in truth 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.420
 It has a relief effect so you can not 

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:22.700
 see that it was all plasticized and makes 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.740
 measure a bit the black shadow but room 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.970
 black room that is the dark room 

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:31.190
 in which we will see more or less in 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:32.780
 assassin's creed revelations good by 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.110
 parts as you can see here we have 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:40.140
 where things are saved first 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:43.130
 the short film was 66 kristen vers 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.130
 about 15 minutes 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.459
 of duration the video game as I have 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.690
 said includes attending television 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.490
 I do not have it right now 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.220
 got into the playstation because I like it 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.780
 and the cd that I told you about the bands 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.250
 sound is down here is worth not 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.050
 you confuse because a lot of people believe that 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:03.450
 this is the video game the one the ace 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.130
 Institute did not tell you the game 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.920
 assassin's creed one comes in one's own 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.510
 cd of the revelations but you had to 

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.069
 put in the playstation and they will come out 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.050
 as if it were as if there were two 

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:14.880
 discs one to play revelations and the 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.150
 another one is for in this case which one you have 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.560
 inscribed one and what I told you there you have 

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.790
 the box the code to be able 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.260
 download it I do not care if you see it 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:23.730
 because I downloaded it a long time ago 

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:26.160
 which is going to be worth to us and as I have 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.540
 commented then you have these these 

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:29.190
 additional content that is the mission 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:30.150
 since it is exclusive only for 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.519
 people who have bought the edition 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.790
 special or if the dlc was later purchased 

00:03:32.519 --> 00:03:37.860
 of the archives is worth the armor of 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.750
 gross and improvements worth the capacity 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.850
 after carrying weapons does not mean 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.709
 of carrying bullets and the two characters 

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.040
 multiplayer the crusader and the jester 

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:46.450
 Ottoman 

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.760
 and 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.440
 well you know this is the code for 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.000
 being able to play online now is a shame 

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:53.170
 because we need this code to 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.340
 be able to play online with which if you 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.930
 you buy this game in second hand 

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.690
 he is very careful because the safest 

00:03:55.930 --> 00:04:02.890
 is that you can not play it online now 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:05.500
 it goes like this nothing instructions like no and the 

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.900
 discount code the same 30% of 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.709
 discount for these two games are 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.709
 expired I'm sorry 

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:18.130
 more things more things the last thing the 

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:20.019
 great thing I think that what matters most 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:22.330
 not what most people what most 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:25.260
 like people who are fabulous 

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:26.730
 encyclopedia as you can see 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.490
 you can see here that there are a lot of 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:31.920
 codes and the acquis symbol for another 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.440
 side because nothing is an encyclopedia in the 

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:36.660
 which covers more or less everything you do 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:40.050
 what happens the saga up links and 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:43.440
 revelations divide it into groups by the 

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:45.720
 story by characters by places and 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.770
 well you know you have bullets to everything 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:51.379
 color of anything 

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.680
 that compose is this video game and this 

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.680
 saga 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.620
 and nothing a little more is that there are many 

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:01.330
 truth pages 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:03.249
 even truths because he talks to you a little 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:08.459
 even the comics 

00:05:03.249 --> 00:05:08.459
 the 300 pages not 250 pages 

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:12.520
 a little more to talk about I hope that you 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:15.480
 have liked and remember nothing is true 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.480
 everything is permitted
