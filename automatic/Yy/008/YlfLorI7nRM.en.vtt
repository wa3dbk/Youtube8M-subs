00:00:10.389 --> 00:00:13.730
 great i think for the first few 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:17.500
 seconds this video can be 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.500
 guess what will happen next is not it 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.599
 Yes, in general, in my opinion, as it is not hard 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.550
 move when you are your best 

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:33.680
 a friend can smog on schami charge we are not 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.750
 know the friendship she is if you do fucking 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:40.030
 then together and to the end and indeed they are with 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.030
 first class together so continued 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.570
 when i watched it the first time me 

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.160
 side yanked what videos need to 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:51.380
 theaters in 3d show place 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.720
 trailers and instead of some movies 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.360
 I also thought poor at first 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.370
 dude with a camera so we flew then I 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.820
 I noticed this crap I realized that the phone 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:03.410
 just on something flocks and the phrase is 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.149
 confirms that it would be very strange 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:07.130
 if the dude of his sidekick can 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.649
 got worried more over the phone 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.170
 iphone outfit hit well, you still Sonya 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:15.079
 three teeth knocked out the era of the main phone 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:18.619
 whole how I love when the video here with 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:20.780
 This phrase begins well, just fucking 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:22.459
 now dude bottle he put it 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.560
 probably decided to take revenge on alcohol because of 

00:01:22.459 --> 00:01:26.779
 whom his whole family has suffered want 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.369
 beat alcoholism poke a knife in wine 

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:30.109
 but I still don't understand the reaction 

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.389
 dude off-screen like nothing yet 

00:01:30.109 --> 00:01:35.020
 they have happened already well fuck in general 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:35.020
 a continuation 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.350
 Now the reaction is correct and on time 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.660
 the fact that the men now went here before 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.280
 a real man could open her dick 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:51.500
 and field member at the box office and tissue 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:58.610
 bee cook to chop firewood and now 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:02:00.380
 even found a bottle open can't yes 

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:02.300
 Generally your in any way dummy well or 

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.010
 language and speak them from there specifically in 

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:06.140
 theater and order instead of fake 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.030
 because it is cheaper and they do not cut a dick 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:09.740
 In general, you can and not understand the guys and 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.630
 birthday was ordered a cool cake 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:13.520
 when it was time for dessert I found out 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:17.780
 blades then no here guys and found in their 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:19.459
 This situation is what I need 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.959
 for the cake after the holiday this broken 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:22.520
 the knife can still be like a spatula 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:24.320
 use and what people if you something 

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.700
 broke do not worry maybe 

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.320
 it just got new 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.940
 destination for example broken 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:56.810
 phone can be used as a backup 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:59.000
 for the table leg so that it does not swing 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:00.800
 healthy by the way if you too sneezed in 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.660
 time watching this episode be 

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:04.670
 healthy in limb of the day question how am i 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.350
 I understand it all because it happened when 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:08.269
 you can't stop quietly 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:09.800
 I usually start after 10 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.410
 experiment it sneeze up 

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:14.239
 kicking in a jump lying on the floor in the basin 

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:18.280
 water or looking at this video for example 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.280
 vouch for such thorough karaoke 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:38.520
 does this dog chainsaw remind me 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:42.750
 and I wonder what it is like this 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:45.690
 wrinkles shorter be healthy still to 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:48.060
 Ferrari gave you this last 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:49.440
 I wanted to show you a video for a long time 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:51.480
 so long ago that it was somewhere in 

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.200
 episode 10 area but she is somewhere 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.150
 sagging 

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:56.959
 and here again returned in short the old video 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.959
 but wildly cool 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:09.720
 fuck this is the world's most awkward flip 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:11.459
 she looks so graceful 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:13.590
 divinely that i don't even have a feeling 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.360
 that this feil I'm pretty sure that everything is so 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:17.250
 and planned you just peer into 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:18.900
 current congenially grouped me 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.790
 madly in such videos like perfect 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.800
 the balance between incredible absurdity and 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:24.660
 going wild epics how cool it is 

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.730
 everything looks like slow motion like 

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.570
 stupidly he falls into the leaves of the varya knew that 

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:29.790
 taking risks 

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:31.440
 he was rewarded in general now you know 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:33.530
