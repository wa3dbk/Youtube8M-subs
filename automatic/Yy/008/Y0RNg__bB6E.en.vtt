00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:02.220
å˜¿~What'up guys.Vanoss is here 

00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:04.420
 Today I have a zombie movie to show you 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:06.540
 Because this is a very interesting moment of failure 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.600
 I accidentally recorded this paragraph. 

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:12.689
 Fight side by side with your friends in zombie purgatory 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:14.460
 That is basically me 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:14.960
 Delirious 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:16.400
 Moo Snuckel and Nogla 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:17.699
 Playing zombie purgatory 

00:00:17.953 --> 00:00:19.953
 When it launched, we are still not familiar with the map. 

00:00:19.953 --> 00:00:22.113
 And we also play simple mode 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:23.920
 Because we are relaxing 

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:25.140
 G 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.673
 Like I said, we are not familiar with the map. 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.807
 And we played very late levels. 

00:00:28.807 --> 00:00:30.245
 And the end is very interesting 

00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:32.286
 I hope you will like it. 

00:00:32.395 --> 00:00:33.835
 One more thing is Nogla. 

00:00:33.835 --> 00:00:35.657
 Can only be seen in the first half of the movie 

00:00:35.657 --> 00:00:37.200
 That's because the game is in the middle 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.481
 He decided to go to sleep 

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.060
 So that's it 

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:46.420
 I hope that you will like the film that my friend fought for survival. 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:47.480
 We are waiting to see you! Peace 

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.280
 Can I order pizza before the next round? 

00:00:51.295 --> 00:00:53.295
 Rule one must never order pizza when playing zombies again 

00:00:53.439 --> 00:00:55.439
 I have already ordered pizza. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.860
 What do you do after he arrives at your home? 

00:00:58.253 --> 00:01:00.113
 And we are in the middle of it... 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.020
 Haha! No! 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.920
 Oh! God! 

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:06.020
 God! 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.660
 God! 

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.320
 You should think about it! 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:09.099
 genius! 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.372
 Ok! 

00:01:10.372 --> 00:01:12.318
 I think you have to throw a lot of monkeys (*Note 1) 

00:01:12.318 --> 00:01:13.232
 Throw a bunch of monkeys 

00:01:13.232 --> 00:01:14.902
 And I have to finish it quickly. 

00:01:16.338 --> 00:01:18.338
 He is knocking at the door! Lose the monkey! 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:20.460
 He is knocking at the door! 

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.620
 (Fortunately, we use the crawler to maintain 4 rounds) 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:26.380
 The crawler is coming 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.680
 You should take him away from the person who wants to take the pizza. 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:31.938
 I am at Damomet Sandwich 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.760
 He is here (I am going to get pizza) 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.060
 Wait 

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.460
 Really bad 

00:01:37.486 --> 00:01:39.486
 The bullets of my two guns are almost gone. 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.180
 Creeper it... 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.457
 The creeper is dead 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:46.580
 Oh! God! 

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.120
 Eavn! 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:49.160
 Eavn! 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.000
 (in taking pizza) We have monkeys! 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:50.500
 We have monkeys! 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:51.900
 (in taking pizza) We have monkeys! 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:55.760
 He is hanging here!? 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:02.040
 (still taking pizza) Evan! 

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.690
 I'm so scared! 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.260
 I'm so scared! 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:08.280
 Full bullet 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.180
 Evan! 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.700
 Evan! 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.940
 Evan! 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.940
 Faster! 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:27.060
 Evan! 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.500
 You keep the left, I keep the right 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.674
 You keep the left, I keep the right 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.380
 You keep the left, I keep the right 

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.100
 I want to throw a monkey 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.380
 whatever! 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:40.120
 I also have monkeys. 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.480
 I also have monkeys! Hey! 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.220
 I fell! 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:42.920
 I fell! 

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.520
 I fell! 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.680
 Save me to save me 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.280
 You should save him first to save me. 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.160
 Lose the monkey! 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.400
 Lose the monkey! 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.360
 Lose the monkey! 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.840
 No, no, no, no, no~ 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.700
 I'm here! 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:02.760
 I lost the monkey! I lost the monkey! 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.040
 After I got up! After I got up! 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:06.020
 Lose the monkey! 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.540
 No, no, no, no~ 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.660
 I recorded it 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.030
 Let you see 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:20.460
 That thing 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:23.680
 That thing fell in front of me. 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.020
 Evan Evan to get his damn pizza! 

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.120
 I don't know what happened? 

00:03:32.637 --> 00:03:34.637
 He will be very upset! 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.320
 (We are super bad) 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.340
 He will come back when he comes back. 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.219
 WTF 

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:46.180
 God! How far is the door to his house? 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.160
 You damn bastard! 

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:54.120
 He (crawler) is dead 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.807
 Evan! We are screaming! 

00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:57.434
 We are screaming for you 

00:03:59.387 --> 00:04:01.827
 How far is your door?! 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.880
 I need to go down the stairs 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:04.784
 open the door 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.200
 The distance of the bastard in a street 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.020
 So I have to wait 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:09.520
 you know 

00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:11.120
 Go slowly to my family. 

00:04:11.198 --> 00:04:13.198
 Then I handed over the card 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.260
 End the account 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.460
 We were screaming at that time 

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:18.320
 Evan! 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.194
 Faster! 

00:04:19.194 --> 00:04:20.859
 I was thinking after getting pizza... 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:23.179
 I don't want to go upstairs so fast, I still score a piece for my dad... 

00:04:23.179 --> 00:04:23.783
 So I went to cut 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:26.540
 after come back 

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:28.735
 I saw the damn main picture! 

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:30.600
 You see it at first sight 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.907
 I saw this picture 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:33.360
 I just want to 

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:34.520
 You damn bastard 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.120
 I guess the zombie is suddenly dead. 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.943
 Just like you didn't kill it 

00:04:38.943 --> 00:04:39.443
 Actually 

00:04:39.443 --> 00:04:41.443
 In fact, we won
