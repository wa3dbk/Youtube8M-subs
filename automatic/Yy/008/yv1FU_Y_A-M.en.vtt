00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:29.009 
make sure when you go ahead and put this

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.670 
make sure when you go ahead and put this
into<00:00:29.250> the<00:00:29.400> pressure<00:00:29.580> pot<00:00:30.439> instead<00:00:31.439> it's

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:31.680 
into the pressure pot instead it's

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:35.630 
into the pressure pot instead it's
relatively<00:00:32.130> level<00:00:32.660> and<00:00:34.040> it's<00:00:35.040> pretty<00:00:35.280> easy<00:00:35.430> to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
relatively level and it's pretty easy to

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.150 
relatively level and it's pretty easy to
tell<00:00:35.670> if<00:00:35.880> it's<00:00:36.059> level<00:00:36.390> or<00:00:36.480> not<00:00:36.800> just<00:00:37.800> by<00:00:37.890> taking

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
tell if it's level or not just by taking

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:44.450 
tell if it's level or not just by taking
a<00:00:38.340> look<00:00:38.520> at<00:00:38.670> the<00:00:38.790> fluid<00:00:39.890> if<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.280> has<00:00:41.460> um<00:00:43.250> if<00:00:44.250> the

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
a look at the fluid if it has um if the

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.709 
a look at the fluid if it has um if the
fluid<00:00:44.700> has<00:00:46.010> accumulated<00:00:47.010> to<00:00:47.429> one<00:00:47.640> side<00:00:47.940> then

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
fluid has accumulated to one side then

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:49.729 
fluid has accumulated to one side then
you'll<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.899> able<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.199> tell<00:00:49.350> that<00:00:49.379> it's<00:00:49.649> not

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
you'll be able to tell that it's not

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.349 
you'll be able to tell that it's not
really<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.129> level<00:00:51.710> and<00:00:52.710> I<00:00:53.039> have<00:00:53.359> pressure

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
really that level and I have pressure

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:05.560 
really that level and I have pressure
pot<00:00:54.660> like<00:00:54.899> everybody<00:00:55.289> else<00:00:55.469> has<00:00:55.649> from

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:07.850 

this<00:01:06.570> is<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:06.990> much<00:01:07.140> easier<00:01:07.200> when<00:01:07.530> you<00:01:07.740> have

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
this is so much easier when you have

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.500 
this is so much easier when you have
somebody<00:01:08.190> helping<00:01:08.670> you<00:01:08.790> with<00:01:08.940> this<00:01:09.090> i<00:01:09.270> must

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
somebody helping you with this i must

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.550 
somebody helping you with this i must
say<00:01:09.720> i<00:01:11.870> don't<00:01:12.870> know<00:01:12.960> if<00:01:13.020> you<00:01:13.110> can<00:01:13.290> see<00:01:13.470> the

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
say i don't know if you can see the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.110 
say i don't know if you can see the
alignment<00:01:14.040> marks<00:01:14.310> on<00:01:14.460> the<00:01:14.610> top<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:14.850> my

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
alignment marks on the top of my

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.310 
alignment marks on the top of my
pressure<00:01:15.390> pot<00:01:20.540> i'll<00:01:21.540> show<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:21.900> later<00:01:22.020> how

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:22.320 
pressure pot i'll show you later how

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:30.200 
pressure pot i'll show you later how
that<00:01:22.710> sound<00:01:28.550> this<00:01:29.550> pipe<00:01:29.760> that<00:01:29.910> comes<00:01:30.030> from

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
that sound this pipe that comes from

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:33.230 
that sound this pipe that comes from
here<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.570> for<00:01:30.780> my<00:01:30.900> vacuum<00:01:31.380> pump<00:01:31.670> I<00:01:32.670> don't<00:01:33.060> have

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
here is for my vacuum pump I don't have

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:34.730 
here is for my vacuum pump I don't have
it<00:01:33.360> hooked<00:01:33.660> up<00:01:33.900> right<00:01:34.080> now<00:01:34.290> because<00:01:34.560> I<00:01:34.680> don't

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
it hooked up right now because I don't

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.830 
it hooked up right now because I don't
really<00:01:35.040> need<00:01:35.369> it<00:01:35.550> kind<00:01:36.270> of<00:01:36.330> gets<00:01:36.479> in<00:01:36.690> my<00:01:36.810> way

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
really need it kind of gets in my way

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.550 
really need it kind of gets in my way
sometimes<00:01:37.729> so<00:01:38.729> I<00:01:38.759> just<00:01:39.150> went<00:01:39.300> ahead<00:01:39.390> and<00:01:39.750> took

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
sometimes so I just went ahead and took

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:50.330 
sometimes so I just went ahead and took
it<00:01:40.619> off<00:01:41.840> now<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.900> fun<00:01:43.170> begins<00:01:49.070> I'm<00:01:50.070> going<00:01:50.250> to

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:50.340 
it off now the fun begins I'm going to

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.749 
it off now the fun begins I'm going to
go<00:01:50.430> ahead<00:01:50.460> and<00:01:50.850> apply<00:01:50.910> pressure<00:01:51.860> to<00:01:52.860> about<00:01:53.340> 40

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
go ahead and apply pressure to about 40

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:01.249 
go ahead and apply pressure to about 40
psi<00:01:57.170> and<00:01:58.170> I'm<00:01:58.290> gonna<00:01:58.380> put<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.710> in<00:01:58.770> slowly<00:02:00.229> so<00:02:01.229> it

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
psi and I'm gonna put it in slowly so it

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:14.120 
psi and I'm gonna put it in slowly so it
doesn't<00:02:01.710> mess<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:01.950> my<00:02:03.020> my<00:02:04.020> poor

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:20.690

a little bit more okay we're good to go

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.720 
a little bit more okay we're good to go
there's<00:02:21.030> 40<00:02:21.330> psi<00:02:21.920> we'll<00:02:22.920> check<00:02:23.160> back<00:02:23.190> on<00:02:23.400> this

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
there's 40 psi we'll check back on this

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.760 
there's 40 psi we'll check back on this
in<00:02:23.910> 24<00:02:24.210> hours<00:02:24.360> once<00:02:24.900> I<00:02:25.020> go<00:02:25.170> ahead<00:02:25.470> and<00:02:25.620> let<00:02:25.740> it

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
in 24 hours once I go ahead and let it

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.200 
in 24 hours once I go ahead and let it
sit<00:02:26.040> here<00:02:26.190> for<00:02:26.370> a<00:02:26.400> few<00:02:26.580> minutes<00:02:26.760> make<00:02:26.970> sure<00:02:27.090> we

type of blank creation and i was doing

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:22.950 
type of blank creation and i was doing
it<00:04:21.460> simply<00:04:21.790> because<00:04:22.090> somebody<00:04:22.420> had<00:04:22.600> asked<00:04:22.870> me

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
it simply because somebody had asked me

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.950 
it simply because somebody had asked me
to<00:04:23.050> do<00:04:23.170> a<00:04:23.200> special<00:04:23.500> pen<00:04:24.010> for<00:04:24.280> them<00:04:24.450> so<00:04:25.450> this<00:04:25.780> is

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
to do a special pen for them so this is

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360 
to do a special pen for them so this is
what<00:04:26.110> happens<00:04:26.140> trial<00:04:26.770> in<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:26.980> a<00:04:27.010> little<00:04:27.190> bit

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370 
what happens trial in there a little bit

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:31.470 
what happens trial in there a little bit

now my guess is well I know this for a

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.120 
now my guess is well I know this for a
fact<00:04:31.540> simply<00:04:32.020> when<00:04:32.260> I<00:04:32.290> came<00:04:32.380> down<00:04:32.770> to<00:04:32.920> my
