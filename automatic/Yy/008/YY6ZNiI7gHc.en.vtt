00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:06.700
 it was hoped in htc one max actually not 

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:09.550
 much but haifa 2013 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:12.360
 in addition to the colors of red hdc one 

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:17.470
 black turquoise and of course the silver 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.869
 just a little hd htc desire 500 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.179
 small not so much in size is 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:25.210
 big enough and the display is 

00:00:22.179 --> 00:00:28.050
 however of a good standard because we speak 

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:31.749
 however, a 4.3-inch diagonal 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:34.800
 wta therefore 800 x 480 pixels and a 

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:39.670
 device that has a processor 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:42.789
 fairly new but low level 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.910
 let's talk about a snap dragon 200 with 

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:46.750
 a 1.2 gb clock is always a processor 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.449
 quad core 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:52.809
 but obviously it cannot be 

00:00:49.449 --> 00:00:55.690
 compared to the hpc one processor a 

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:58.809
 graphic level we always have 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.469
 the sense interface but the aesthetics of the 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.839
 body found in colors that yes 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.860
 intersect laterally with white 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:11.170
 the brightest turquoise compared 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:13.840
 precisely to the classic single color of the 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.000
 capisci one is indeed a device designed 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.830
 mostly for young people for a 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.010
 public looking for a product 

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.860
 interesting custom by htc but 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:26.680
 does not want to spend a high amount like 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.570
 that of hdc one wants to look for one 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:32.170
 mid-range smartphones 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:33.880
 in fact we are talking about 249 euro unofficial 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:37.210
 we'll see if they will be formalized by 

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.490
 glasses or we wish for a blitz 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:43.210
 feed that remains absolutely identity 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.600
 the htc one a home managed at the same 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.090
 way 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:48.370
 so many widgets the possibility of 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.560
 insert and our widgets inside 

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.820
 of the screen wherever we want with 

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.010
 extreme ease 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:56.710
 obviously the widget dc media from 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:59.840
 configure and an 8 camera 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:04.390
 megapixel the display is 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:07.189
 very good for like for the kind of 

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:10.580
 point device is up front here you go 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.019
 in fact, we propose colors 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.209
 rather good 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.760
 the camera we said is 8 megapixel 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.860
 with autofocus 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.650
 let's see the settings we have 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:26.180
 the possibility of going to use also 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:30.140
 the hdr needed the presets via cases c 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.140
 we have the hd resolution for how much 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.269
 it's about videos so not full hd in 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:38.810
 the more we can obviously go to 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:42.590
 modify iso and whatever else is not missing 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:44.959
 htc zoe therefore is not present 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:48.769
 advanced feature that has been introduced 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.700
 own with htc one and also 

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:50.540
 within the customization 

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.069
 software 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.000
 there is some small difference compared 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:59.240
 what I said because some are missing 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.480
 advanced options indeed 

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:04.750
 classic device settings 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.960
 htc let's see the system start 

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:13.480
 software update sorry software 

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:22.010
 information android 4.1.2 with version 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:25.640
 5.0 htc sense 500 white 500 black 

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:28.700
 black is also black on the edge 

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:31.730
 we like it better in simply black 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:34.190
 because it is the classic color ccc floor of 

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:37.910
 more without diversification of the body 

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:39.950
 it's also nice to set the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.150
 rear camera with a nice flash 

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:45.550
 obviously we remember 8 megapixels e 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:48.110
 in the upper part we find 

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:50.000
 there is no turning on and off 

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:53.910
 clearly the infrared port as htc 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:58.200
 one the 3.5 mm jack 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:04:00.990
 usb microphone and volume rocker 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:03.300
 in the lateral part 

00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:05.400
 obviously we also have the key 

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:07.010
 switching on and off just that 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:11.070
 as mentioned in the upper part 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:14.640
 here we have a small fear that to say a 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:17.160
 very light ride device a 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:20.220
 display that seems to satisfy us completely 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.870
 the range of products to these yes 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.600
 refers to keys 

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:26.850
 unfortunately the hvc logo is missing in the middle 

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:28.500
 so we only have two keys maybe 

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:31.170
 this empty space an extra meal there 

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:32.820
 it could not exist but it is a choice 

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.940
 of a cadiz to put two keys in 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:42.650
 this new 2013 range a greeting from 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.650
 hdblog and nico lorda stand hdc iv to 2013
