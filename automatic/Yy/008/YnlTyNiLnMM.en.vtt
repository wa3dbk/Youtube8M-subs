morning<00:00:07.290> I<00:00:07.470> got<00:00:07.830> it<00:00:07.950> all<00:00:08.040> set<00:00:08.340> up<00:00:08.370> here's<00:00:09.120> the

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
morning I got it all set up here's the

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.360 
morning I got it all set up here's the
receiver<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:09.990> basically<00:00:10.710> what<00:00:10.860> you<00:00:10.980> want<00:00:11.309> to

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
receiver and basically what you want to

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.299 
receiver and basically what you want to
do<00:00:11.490> is<00:00:11.730> this<00:00:11.969> thing<00:00:12.240> is<00:00:12.389> powered<00:00:12.900> from<00:00:13.110> an<00:00:14.009> up<00:00:14.160> a

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:14.309 
do is this thing is powered from an up a

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.570 
do is this thing is powered from an up a
power<00:00:14.490> outlet<00:00:14.759> so<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.870> has<00:00:16.190> an<00:00:17.190> optical

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
power outlet so this has an optical

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.460 
power outlet so this has an optical
cable<00:00:17.760> that<00:00:18.060> runs<00:00:18.470> from<00:00:19.470> this<00:00:20.160> to<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.000> ps4<00:00:21.470> so

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470 
cable that runs from this to the ps4 so

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.400 
cable that runs from this to the ps4 so
the<00:00:22.619> ps4<00:00:22.890> sends<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.880> audio<00:00:24.240> signal<00:00:24.600> to

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:25.410 
the ps4 sends the the audio signal to

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.349 
the ps4 sends the the audio signal to
the<00:00:25.769> receiver<00:00:25.890> and<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:26.760> receiver<00:00:26.820> at<00:00:27.300> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
the receiver and the receiver at the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.540 
the receiver and the receiver at the
cepsa<00:00:27.930> signal<00:00:28.260> and<00:00:28.410> sends<00:00:28.800> the<00:00:28.949> signal<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.519> the

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
cepsa signal and sends the signal to the

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.999 
cepsa signal and sends the signal to the
headset<00:00:30.060> and<00:00:30.179> that's<00:00:30.480> why<00:00:30.630> it's<00:00:30.810> called<00:00:31.009> 100%

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
headset and that's why it's called 100%

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.549 
headset and that's why it's called 100%
Wireless<00:00:32.790> although<00:00:33.180> this<00:00:33.870> cable<00:00:34.350> right<00:00:34.380> here

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
Wireless although this cable right here

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.220 
Wireless although this cable right here
that<00:00:34.980> you<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.100> on<00:00:35.399> the<00:00:36.020> going<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.140> the

that you see on the going to the

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.020 
that you see on the going to the
controller<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.860> for<00:00:38.129> the<00:00:38.219> chat<00:00:38.489> functionality

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
controller is for the chat functionality

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.560 
controller is for the chat functionality
so<00:00:39.899> a<00:00:39.930> hundred<00:00:40.140> percent<00:00:40.670> wirelessly<00:00:41.670> not<00:00:42.300> so

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:42.570 
so a hundred percent wirelessly not so

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.560 
so a hundred percent wirelessly not so
much<00:00:42.920> but<00:00:43.920> uh<00:00:43.950> yeah<00:00:44.640> for<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.000> most<00:00:45.120> part<00:00:45.390> so

let me show you how this looks so
there's<00:00:49.590> an<00:00:49.739> optical<00:00:50.129> cable<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.610> there's<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
there's an optical cable and there's the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.439 
there's an optical cable and there's the
power<00:00:52.170> so<00:00:53.100> the<00:00:53.219> power<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.789> simple<00:00:54.149> it<00:00:54.300> just

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
power so the power pretty simple it just

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.840 
power so the power pretty simple it just
goes<00:00:54.629> to<00:00:54.780> your<00:00:54.930> ps4<00:00:55.230> and<00:00:55.710> as<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.789> see

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.310 
you can also you that use that and in
the<00:01:11.310> back<00:01:11.549> basically<00:01:12.270> let's<00:01:12.810> see<00:01:12.990> if<00:01:13.049> we<00:01:13.170> can

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
the back basically let's see if we can

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.580 
the back basically let's see if we can
get<00:01:13.439> our<00:01:13.530> V<00:01:13.950> of<00:01:14.070> this

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:15.590 
get our V of this

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.289 
get our V of this
there's<00:01:16.590> the<00:01:16.710> optical<00:01:17.159> audio<00:01:17.310> right<00:01:18.030> there

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
there's the optical audio right there

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:19.999 
there's the optical audio right there
that's<00:01:19.049> pretty<00:01:19.259> simple<00:01:19.530> I<00:01:19.710> mean<00:01:19.860> you<00:01:19.979> just

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009
