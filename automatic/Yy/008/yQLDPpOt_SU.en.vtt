would<00:01:23.340> be<00:01:23.369> so<00:01:23.640> cool<00:01:23.820> just<00:01:24.030> to<00:01:24.119> roll<00:01:24.299> around<00:01:24.420> and

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
would be so cool just to roll around and

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.620 
would be so cool just to roll around and
have<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.799> cool<00:01:25.950> underglow<00:01:26.400> neon<00:01:27.030> effect<00:01:27.390> to

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
have this cool underglow neon effect to

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.569 
have this cool underglow neon effect to
your<00:01:27.840> car<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.590> matches<00:01:28.770> your<00:01:28.920> paint<00:01:29.189> job<00:01:29.280> or

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
your car that matches your paint job or

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.090 
your car that matches your paint job or
whatever<00:01:29.820> I<00:01:30.140> overall<00:01:31.140> just<00:01:31.320> think<00:01:31.560> there's<00:01:31.979> a

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
whatever I overall just think there's a

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.030 
whatever I overall just think there's a
lot<00:01:32.400> more<00:01:32.430> I've<00:01:32.850> got<00:01:33.000> so<00:01:33.240> many<00:01:33.390> ideas<00:01:33.479> for<00:01:34.259> car

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
lot more I've got so many ideas for car

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.679 
lot more I've got so many ideas for car
customization<00:01:35.430> options<00:01:36.150> that<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:36.390> could<00:01:36.540> add

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
customization options that we could add

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.929 
customization options that we could add
in<00:01:36.900> it's<00:01:37.049> like<00:01:37.200> it's<00:01:37.380> never<00:01:37.619> enough<00:01:37.829> right<00:01:38.250> we

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
in it's like it's never enough right we

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.780 
in it's like it's never enough right we
finally<00:01:39.600> get<00:01:39.780> in<00:01:40.020> GTA<00:01:40.380> 5<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.979> the<00:01:41.220> ability<00:01:41.640> to

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
finally get in GTA 5 the the ability to

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.310 
finally get in GTA 5 the the ability to
customize<00:01:42.210> your<00:01:42.329> cars<00:01:42.600> but<00:01:42.960> that's<00:01:43.140> not

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
customize your cars but that's not

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990 
customize your cars but that's not
enough<00:01:43.680> we<00:01:43.710> just<00:01:43.860> want<00:01:44.159> more<00:01:44.369> and<00:01:44.579> more<00:01:44.790> it

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
enough we just want more and more it

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.520 
enough we just want more and more it
kind<00:01:45.240> of<00:01:45.299> sucks<00:01:45.570> how<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:45.960> is<00:01:46.110> and<00:01:46.350> how<00:01:46.470> that

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
kind of sucks how that is and how that

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.190 
kind of sucks how that is and how that
works<00:01:46.860> but<00:01:47.060> I<00:01:48.060> think<00:01:48.450> a<00:01:48.479> car<00:01:48.689> underglow<00:01:49.049> would

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
works but I think a car underglow would

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.160 
works but I think a car underglow would
be<00:01:49.290> pretty<00:01:49.500> cool<00:01:49.590> now<00:01:50.280> next<00:01:50.610> would<00:01:50.970> be<00:01:51.170> storing

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
be pretty cool now next would be storing

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.590 
be pretty cool now next would be storing
police<00:01:52.740> cars<00:01:53.310> how<00:01:53.610> cool<00:01:53.909> would<00:01:54.030> that<00:01:54.119> be<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.570> I

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
police cars how cool would that be and I

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.899 
police cars how cool would that be and I
never<00:01:54.869> really<00:01:55.320> kind<00:01:56.070> of<00:01:56.189> understood<00:01:56.640> why<00:01:56.880> you

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
never really kind of understood why you

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.350 
never really kind of understood why you
haven't<00:01:57.630> been<00:01:57.689> able<00:01:57.840> to<00:01:58.020> store<00:01:58.590> police<00:01:58.799> cars<00:01:59.360> I

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
haven't been able to store police cars I

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.440 
haven't been able to store police cars I
think<00:02:00.719> there's<00:02:00.930> some<00:02:01.320> other<00:02:02.250> utility<00:02:03.240> type

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
think there's some other utility type

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.999 
think there's some other utility type
vehicles<00:02:03.930> that<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.140> can't<00:02:04.350> store<00:02:04.619> like<00:02:04.799> tow

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
vehicles that you can't store like tow

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.130 
vehicles that you can't store like tow
trucks<00:02:05.399> those<00:02:06.210> aren't<00:02:06.420> even<00:02:06.570> a<00:02:06.630> GTA<00:02:06.990> online

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
trucks those aren't even a GTA online

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.930 
trucks those aren't even a GTA online
anymore<00:02:07.770> but<00:02:08.069> just<00:02:08.280> little<00:02:08.520> things<00:02:08.670> like<00:02:08.819> that

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
anymore but just little things like that

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.570 
anymore but just little things like that
I<00:02:09.149> don't<00:02:09.270> see<00:02:09.450> what<00:02:09.750> the<00:02:09.899> arm<00:02:10.050> is<00:02:10.289> in<00:02:11.190> storing

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
I don't see what the arm is in storing

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:12.540 
I don't see what the arm is in storing
those<00:02:11.700> I<00:02:11.760> think<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.090> would<00:02:12.180> be<00:02:12.209> cool

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
those I think it would be cool

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.250 
those I think it would be cool
to<00:02:12.670> have<00:02:12.850> an<00:02:12.970> unmarked<00:02:13.330> police<00:02:13.510> cruiser<00:02:13.900> in<00:02:14.110> my

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
to have an unmarked police cruiser in my

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.070 
to have an unmarked police cruiser in my
garage<00:02:14.670> and<00:02:15.670> just<00:02:16.300> things<00:02:16.480> like<00:02:16.690> that<00:02:16.840> mean

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
garage and just things like that mean

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:18.870

even<00:02:17.530> the<00:02:17.620> tow<00:02:17.800> truck<00:02:18.070> if<00:02:18.190> that<00:02:18.220> was<00:02:18.430> in<00:02:18.550> GTA

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:18.880 
even the tow truck if that was in GTA

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.970 
even the tow truck if that was in GTA
online<00:02:19.030> so<00:02:19.810> just<00:02:20.020> things<00:02:20.290> like<00:02:20.470> that<00:02:20.680> I've
