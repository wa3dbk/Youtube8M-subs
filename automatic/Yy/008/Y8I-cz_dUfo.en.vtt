hello<00:00:08.130> YouTube<00:00:08.550> I've<00:00:09.420> spent<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.840> last<00:00:09.929> five

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
hello YouTube I've spent the last five

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.290 
hello YouTube I've spent the last five
minutes<00:00:10.590> here<00:00:11.190> in<00:00:11.340> Garry's<00:00:11.670> Mod<00:00:11.700> trying<00:00:12.210> to

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
minutes here in Garry's Mod trying to

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:13.700 
minutes here in Garry's Mod trying to
think<00:00:12.480> of<00:00:12.570> a<00:00:12.630> good<00:00:12.719> way<00:00:12.870> to<00:00:12.929> start<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.380> video

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
think of a good way to start this video

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.790 
think of a good way to start this video
and<00:00:14.059> I<00:00:15.059> can't<00:00:15.480> because<00:00:16.139> I'm<00:00:16.260> tired<00:00:16.500> and

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800 
and I can't because I'm tired and

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.080 
and I can't because I'm tired and
uncreated<00:00:17.369> as<00:00:17.840> always<00:00:19.279> so<00:00:20.279> we're<00:00:20.789> just<00:00:20.820> going

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
uncreated as always so we're just going

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.269 
uncreated as always so we're just going
to<00:00:21.150> jump<00:00:21.300> right<00:00:21.420> into<00:00:21.689> it<00:00:21.859> I'm<00:00:22.859> going<00:00:23.039> to<00:00:23.160> show

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
to jump right into it I'm going to show

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.849 
to jump right into it I'm going to show
you<00:00:23.340> how<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.760> use<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:24.449> CF<00:00:24.869> engines<00:00:25.380> because<00:00:25.650> some

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
you how to use a CF engines because some

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.160 
you how to use a CF engines because some
of<00:00:25.890> you<00:00:26.130> still<00:00:27.090> don't<00:00:27.300> know<00:00:27.390> it's<00:00:27.660> a<00:00:27.750> fairly

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
of you still don't know it's a fairly

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.330 
of you still don't know it's a fairly
easy<00:00:28.560> process<00:00:29.359> go<00:00:30.359> into<00:00:30.599> your<00:00:30.810> cue<00:00:31.800> menu<00:00:32.099> and

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
easy process go into your cue menu and

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.680 
easy process go into your cue menu and
select<00:00:32.759> your<00:00:32.820> ACF<00:00:33.420> menu<00:00:33.899> tool<00:00:35.540> hit<00:00:36.540> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
select your ACF menu tool hit the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.869 
select your ACF menu tool hit the
mobility<00:00:37.200> tab<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.829> then<00:00:38.190> you<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.460> engines

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
mobility tab and then you have engines

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:41.420 
mobility tab and then you have engines
or<00:00:39.030> gearboxes<00:00:39.920> typically<00:00:40.920> start<00:00:41.219> with<00:00:41.340> the

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
or gearboxes typically start with the

or gearboxes typically start with the
engine<00:00:41.820> that<00:00:41.969> you<00:00:42.059> want<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.510> for<00:00:43.170> this<00:00:43.290> we're

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
engine that you want and for this we're

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
engine that you want and for this we're
just<00:00:43.620> going<00:00:43.950> to<00:00:44.070> use<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:45.110> 2.2<00:00:46.110> liter<00:00:46.770> gas<00:00:47.309> and

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
just going to use a 2.2 liter gas and

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:54.590 
just going to use a 2.2 liter gas and
once<00:00:48.469> beautiful<00:00:49.969> spawns<00:00:50.969> there<00:00:51.210> grab<00:00:51.960> it<00:00:53.600> go

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
once beautiful spawns there grab it go

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.950 
once beautiful spawns there grab it go
back<00:00:54.780> into<00:00:54.930> the<00:00:55.020> tool<00:00:56.210> find<00:00:57.210> your<00:00:57.329> gear<00:00:57.570> boxes

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
back into the tool find your gear boxes

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.029 
back into the tool find your gear boxes
and<00:00:58.219> depending<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.309> what<00:00:59.460> you<00:00:59.550> want<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> do

00:01:01.029 --> 00:01:01.039 
and depending on what you want to do

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:04.189 
and depending on what you want to do
pick<00:01:02.039> what<00:01:02.280> gearbox<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:02.820> want<00:01:03.030> avoid<00:01:04.019> the

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
pick what gearbox you want avoid the

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.200 
pick what gearbox you want avoid the
differentials<00:01:04.949> and<00:01:05.070> transfer<00:01:05.580> cases<00:01:05.790> if

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
differentials and transfer cases if

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.020 
differentials and transfer cases if
you're<00:01:06.330> trying<00:01:06.510> to<00:01:06.600> make<00:01:06.720> a<00:01:06.780> road<00:01:07.110> car<00:01:08.030> because

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
you're trying to make a road car because

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.330 
you're trying to make a road car because
you<00:01:09.150> only<00:01:09.270> get<00:01:09.479> one<00:01:09.540> or<00:01:09.840> two<00:01:09.869> gears<00:01:10.290> and<00:01:10.650> that's

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
you only get one or two gears and that's

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.899 
you only get one or two gears and that's
not<00:01:11.520> very<00:01:12.090> good<00:01:12.600> for<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.869> road<00:01:13.110> car<00:01:13.409> really

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909 
not very good for a road car really

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.340 
not very good for a road car really
we're<00:01:14.909> just<00:01:14.970> going<00:01:15.180> to<00:01:15.240> use<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:15.390> 6-speed<00:01:16.049> for

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
we're just going to use the 6-speed for

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:20.060 
we're just going to use the 6-speed for
now<00:01:16.580> I<00:01:17.580> want<00:01:18.119> to<00:01:18.210> transaxial<00:01:18.990> 6-speed<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.040> I

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
now I want to transaxial 6-speed and I

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.179 
now I want to transaxial 6-speed and I
only<00:01:20.220> need<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.490> small<00:01:21.320> gear<00:01:22.320> box<00:01:22.560> because

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
only need the small gear box because

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.399 
only need the small gear box because
they<00:01:23.490> have<00:01:23.700> torque<00:01:24.180> ratings<00:01:24.600> and<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:25.229> torque

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
they have torque ratings and the torque

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:28.429 
they have torque ratings and the torque
rating<00:01:25.710> for<00:01:25.860> smaller<00:01:26.100> boxes<00:01:26.670> is<00:01:27.140> 450<00:01:28.140> Newton

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
rating for smaller boxes is 450 Newton

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.210 
rating for smaller boxes is 450 Newton
meters<00:01:28.740> and<00:01:28.979> this<00:01:29.670> engine<00:01:30.000> only<00:01:30.329> makes<00:01:31.220> 170

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
meters and this engine only makes 170

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.980 
meters and this engine only makes 170
Newton<00:01:32.520> meters<00:01:32.820> so<00:01:33.210> I'm<00:01:33.360> well<00:01:33.600> within<00:01:33.630> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
Newton meters so I'm well within the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:38.390 
Newton meters so I'm well within the
limit<00:01:35.840> the<00:01:36.840> big<00:01:37.020> problem<00:01:37.680> with<00:01:37.860> people<00:01:38.130> using

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
limit the big problem with people using

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.670 
limit the big problem with people using
a<00:01:38.640> CF<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.119> them<00:01:39.450> not<00:01:39.689> really<00:01:40.020> knowing<00:01:40.229> which

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
a CF is them not really knowing which

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.870 
a CF is them not really knowing which
ratios<00:01:41.840> to<00:01:42.840> use<00:01:43.079> and<00:01:43.439> really<00:01:44.040> I've<00:01:44.340> found<00:01:44.700> that

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
ratios to use and really I've found that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.929 
ratios to use and really I've found that
the<00:01:45.060> stock<00:01:45.299> ratios<00:01:45.750> are<00:01:46.020> more<00:01:46.229> than<00:01:46.439> fine<00:01:46.939> the

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:47.939 
the stock ratios are more than fine the

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:49.730 
the stock ratios are more than fine the
only<00:01:48.149> thing<00:01:48.390> that<00:01:48.570> I<00:01:48.600> change<00:01:48.960> is<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.290> final

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
only thing that I change is the final

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:52.550 
only thing that I change is the final
drive<00:01:49.979> typically<00:01:50.520> for<00:01:51.450> the<00:01:52.049> six<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.439> eight

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
drive typically for the six and eight

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.700 
drive typically for the six and eight
speed<00:01:52.829> gear<00:01:53.070> boxes<00:01:53.600> so<00:01:54.600> final<00:01:55.079> drive<00:01:55.290> for<00:01:55.619> an

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:55.710 
speed gear boxes so final drive for an

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:57.440 
speed gear boxes so final drive for an
engine<00:01:56.070> this<00:01:56.280> small<00:01:56.610> depending<00:01:57.060> on<00:01:57.149> the<00:01:57.270> wheel

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
engine this small depending on the wheel

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.700 
engine this small depending on the wheel
size<00:01:57.750> you're<00:01:58.110> using<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.619> keep<00:01:59.460> it<00:01:59.610> around<00:01:59.850> to

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
size you're using I keep it around to

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.380 
size you're using I keep it around to
another<00:02:01.710> thing<00:02:01.920> with<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.100> CF<00:02:02.490> is<00:02:02.700> that<00:02:03.240> you

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
another thing with a CF is that you

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:06.499 
another thing with a CF is that you
can't<00:02:03.689> select<00:02:04.590> the<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.610> text<00:02:05.939> here<00:02:06.149> and<00:02:06.180> type

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
can't select the the text here and type

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.749 
can't select the the text here and type
it<00:02:06.659> in<00:02:06.979> because<00:02:07.979> it<00:02:08.099> doesn't<00:02:08.369> work<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.729> some

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
it in because it doesn't work for some

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:10.240 
it in because it doesn't work for some
reason<00:02:09.209> so<00:02:09.390> you<00:02:09.479> have<00:02:09.810> to

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:10.250 
reason so you have to

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.280 
reason so you have to
you<00:02:10.399> only<00:02:10.550> move<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:11.000> slider<00:02:11.360> around<00:02:11.750> and<00:02:12.050> you

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
you only move the slider around and you

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.660 
you only move the slider around and you
get<00:02:12.500> used<00:02:12.680> to<00:02:12.770> it<00:02:12.860> after<00:02:13.010> a<00:02:13.190> while<00:02:13.220> but<00:02:13.550> it's

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
get used to it after a while but it's

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.300 
get used to it after a while but it's
kind<00:02:13.910> of<00:02:13.940> a<00:02:14.030> pain<00:02:14.060> at<00:02:14.420> first<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:18.160> now<00:02:19.160> you<00:02:19.220> have

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
kind of a pain at first so now you have

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.930 
kind of a pain at first so now you have
this<00:02:19.520> nice<00:02:19.700> little<00:02:19.850> gearbox<00:02:20.270> that<00:02:21.020> takes<00:02:21.940> the

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:22.940 
this nice little gearbox that takes the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:27.100 
this nice little gearbox that takes the
engine<00:02:23.900> through<00:02:24.490> that<00:02:25.490> port<00:02:25.820> there<00:02:26.120> and<00:02:26.930> then

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:27.110 
engine through that port there and then

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:35.500 
engine through that port there and then
outputs<00:02:27.680> power<00:02:28.490> to<00:02:28.790> that<00:02:29.770> that<00:02:30.770> part<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:34.510> now

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:35.510 
outputs power to that that part so now

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.160 
outputs power to that that part so now
we'll<00:02:35.840> just<00:02:36.050> make<00:02:36.770> a<00:02:36.830> chassis<00:02:37.070> here<00:02:37.930> find<00:02:38.930> one

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:39.170 
we'll just make a chassis here find one

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:51.699 
we'll just make a chassis here find one
of<00:02:39.200> these<00:02:39.410> um<00:02:43.239> sure<00:02:44.239> we<00:02:44.480> use<00:02:44.630> this<00:02:44.810> one<00:02:50.709> so

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:51.709 
of these um sure we use this one so

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:52.840 
of these um sure we use this one so
we're<00:02:51.890> just<00:02:51.920> going<00:02:52.220> to<00:02:52.340> take<00:02:52.550> the<00:02:52.730> engine

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:52.850 
we're just going to take the engine

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.670 
we're just going to take the engine
figure<00:02:53.720> out<00:02:53.810> which<00:02:53.930> way<00:02:54.110> we're<00:02:54.380> steering

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
figure out which way we're steering

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.940 
figure out which way we're steering
because<00:02:55.010> I<00:02:55.130> can't<00:02:55.400> remember<00:02:56.830> we're<00:02:57.830> not

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
because I can't remember we're not

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.770 
because I can't remember we're not
staring<00:02:58.580> it<00:02:58.640> all<00:02:58.790> I<00:02:58.820> apparently<00:02:59.390> oh<00:03:01.660> that's<00:03:02.660> a

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
staring it all I apparently oh that's a

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:13.760 
staring it all I apparently oh that's a
good<00:03:02.900> thing<00:03:04.630> that's<00:03:06.910> real<00:03:07.910> quality<00:03:08.720> stuff

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:13.770 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:16.630 

so<00:03:14.730> now<00:03:14.880> that<00:03:15.030> we've<00:03:15.150> solved<00:03:15.480> that<00:03:15.690> issue<00:03:15.720> um

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:16.640 
so now that we've solved that issue um

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:19.190 
so now that we've solved that issue um
basically<00:03:17.640> you<00:03:18.300> have<00:03:18.420> your<00:03:18.540> chassis<00:03:18.960> here

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
basically you have your chassis here

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:22.160 
basically you have your chassis here
with<00:03:20.190> your<00:03:20.370> stiri<00:03:20.670> bits<00:03:21.150> and<00:03:21.480> you're<00:03:22.110> just

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:22.170 
with your stiri bits and you're just

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:25.010 
with your stiri bits and you're just
going<00:03:22.320> to<00:03:22.410> place<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.770> engine<00:03:23.780> somewhere<00:03:24.780> on

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020 
going to place the engine somewhere on

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:28.010 
going to place the engine somewhere on
it<00:03:25.380> there's<00:03:25.860> fine<00:03:26.370> and<00:03:27.300> then<00:03:27.540> take<00:03:27.810> your

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
it there's fine and then take your

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.990 
it there's fine and then take your
gearbox<00:03:28.320> and<00:03:28.800> point<00:03:29.070> it<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.280> right<00:03:29.460> way<00:03:29.610> which

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:30.000 
gearbox and point it the right way which

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.430 
gearbox and point it the right way which
would<00:03:30.180> be<00:03:30.210> good<00:03:30.510> because<00:03:30.720> the<00:03:31.050> wrong<00:03:31.230> wake

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
would be good because the wrong wake

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.570 
would be good because the wrong wake
your<00:03:31.620> box<00:03:31.860> doesn't<00:03:32.190> work<00:03:33.800> place<00:03:34.800> that<00:03:35.040> so<00:03:35.340> so

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:35.580 
your box doesn't work place that so so

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:38.750 
your box doesn't work place that so so
I'm<00:03:35.640> going<00:03:35.880> to<00:03:35.940> know<00:03:36.060> cause<00:03:37.100> that<00:03:38.100> would<00:03:38.250> be<00:03:38.370> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
I'm going to know cause that would be a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.960 
I'm going to know cause that would be a
good<00:03:39.120> thing<00:03:39.180> at<00:03:39.750> 50<00:03:40.140> miles<00:03:40.320> an<00:03:40.500> hour<00:03:40.790> have<00:03:41.790> your

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:41.970 
good thing at 50 miles an hour have your

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:45.380 
good thing at 50 miles an hour have your
wheels<00:03:42.230> colliding<00:03:43.580> gosh<00:03:44.580> you<00:03:44.730> need<00:03:44.880> my<00:03:45.030> tools

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
wheels colliding gosh you need my tools

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.630 
wheels colliding gosh you need my tools
here<00:03:47.870> the<00:03:48.870> base<00:03:49.500> of<00:03:49.680> the<00:03:49.770> chassis<00:03:50.220> get<00:03:50.550> out

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640 
here the base of the chassis get out

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.200 
here the base of the chassis get out
your<00:03:50.840> ECF<00:03:51.840> tool<00:03:52.110> again<00:03:52.580> click<00:03:53.580> on<00:03:53.760> the<00:03:53.880> engine

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:54.210 
your ECF tool again click on the engine

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.840 
your ECF tool again click on the engine
and<00:03:54.360> on<00:03:55.170> the<00:03:55.320> gearbox<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:55.980> then<00:03:56.190> a<00:03:56.370> rope<00:03:56.640> is

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
and on the gearbox and then a rope is

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:59.240 
and on the gearbox and then a rope is
drawn<00:03:57.180> from<00:03:57.510> one<00:03:58.230> to<00:03:58.380> the<00:03:58.410> other<00:03:58.530> that<00:03:59.040> means

00:03:59.240 --> 00:03:59.250 
drawn from one to the other that means

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:02.240 
drawn from one to the other that means
that<00:03:59.430> they<00:03:59.550> are<00:03:59.580> linked<00:04:00.710> then<00:04:01.710> you<00:04:01.890> all<00:04:02.040> have

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
that they are linked then you all have

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.970 
that they are linked then you all have
to<00:04:02.490> write<00:04:05.450> and<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.660> connects<00:04:07.140> the<00:04:07.560> gearbox

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:07.980 
to write and that connects the gearbox

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.770 
to write and that connects the gearbox
to<00:04:08.250> the<00:04:08.400> wheel<00:04:08.670> as<00:04:08.970> you<00:04:09.210> could<00:04:09.390> have<00:04:09.480> probably

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
to the wheel as you could have probably

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:13.220 
to the wheel as you could have probably
aside<00:04:10.640> so<00:04:11.640> that<00:04:11.670> was<00:04:12.030> really<00:04:12.360> just<00:04:12.840> about<00:04:13.020> what

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
aside so that was really just about what

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:16.640 
aside so that was really just about what
you<00:04:13.320> need<00:04:13.470> to<00:04:13.590> do<00:04:14.570> the<00:04:15.570> rest<00:04:15.780> is<00:04:16.080> just<00:04:16.110> wire

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
you need to do the rest is just wire

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.910 
you need to do the rest is just wire
garbage<00:04:17.250> and<00:04:18.020> I<00:04:19.020> have<00:04:19.350> this<00:04:19.530> nice<00:04:19.739> little

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:19.920 
garbage and I have this nice little

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.260 
garbage and I have this nice little
expression<00:04:20.780> that<00:04:22.430> simulates<00:04:23.430> an<00:04:23.760> automatic

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:24.270 
expression that simulates an automatic

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:26.810 
expression that simulates an automatic
transmission<00:04:25.070> it'll<00:04:26.070> automatically<00:04:26.520> shift

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:26.820 
transmission it'll automatically shift

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.150 
transmission it'll automatically shift
your<00:04:26.970> gears<00:04:27.210> based<00:04:27.750> on<00:04:27.990> the<00:04:28.230> RPM<00:04:28.920> of<00:04:28.980> the

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
your gears based on the RPM of the

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.700 
your gears based on the RPM of the
engine<00:04:29.400> so<00:04:29.580> basically<00:04:30.180> its<00:04:30.720> actual<00:04:31.230> no<00:04:31.380> fun

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:31.710 
engine so basically its actual no fun

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:35.540 
engine so basically its actual no fun
just<00:04:31.980> so<00:04:32.640> ever<00:04:33.020> which<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.170> why<00:04:34.380> I'm<00:04:34.920> going<00:04:35.430> to

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
just so ever which is why I'm going to

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:40.010 
just so ever which is why I'm going to
be<00:04:35.610> able<00:04:35.670> to<00:04:35.850> download<00:04:36.000> it<00:04:36.390> because<00:04:37.730> fun<00:04:39.020> I'm

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
be able to download it because fun I'm

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:42.130 
be able to download it because fun I'm
just<00:04:40.140> going<00:04:40.410> to<00:04:40.440> link<00:04:40.710> the<00:04:40.830> engine<00:04:41.160> up<00:04:41.280> anyway

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:42.140 
just going to link the engine up anyway

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:54.650 
just going to link the engine up anyway
just<00:04:43.140> so<00:04:43.260> you<00:04:43.410> can<00:04:43.590> see<00:04:52.880> which<00:04:53.880> is<00:04:54.360> over<00:04:54.630> here

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:54.660 
just so you can see which is over here

00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.660 
just so you can see which is over here
in<00:04:55.230> the<00:04:55.350> vehicles<00:04:55.890> menu<00:05:01.280> and

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
in the vehicles menu and

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:05.730 
in the vehicles menu and
yeah<00:05:04.270> we'll<00:05:04.570> just<00:05:04.600> sit<00:05:05.050> right<00:05:05.080> there<00:05:05.290> right<00:05:05.710> in

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:05.740 
yeah we'll just sit right there right in

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:14.340 
yeah we'll just sit right there right in
the<00:05:05.860> middle<00:05:11.430> that's<00:05:12.430> how<00:05:12.550> normal<00:05:12.880> cars<00:05:13.120> are<00:05:13.350> so

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
the middle that's how normal cars are so

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:18.840 
the middle that's how normal cars are so
we're<00:05:14.500> just<00:05:14.560> going<00:05:14.860> to<00:05:14.920> link<00:05:17.430> into<00:05:18.430> the<00:05:18.550> sea

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:18.850 
we're just going to link into the sea

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.610
