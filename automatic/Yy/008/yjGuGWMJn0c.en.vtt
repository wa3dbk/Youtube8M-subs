00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
why can they put like the Hannibal skin

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.429 
why can they put like the Hannibal skin
in<00:01:25.920> here<00:01:27.439> looks<00:01:28.439> quite<00:01:29.040> plain<00:01:29.400> for<00:01:29.729> a<00:01:29.759> general

00:01:30.429 --> 00:01:30.439 
in here looks quite plain for a general

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:33.230 
in here looks quite plain for a general
not<00:01:31.439> not<00:01:31.740> as<00:01:31.860> decorated<00:01:32.430> up<00:01:32.549> as<00:01:32.729> typically

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
not not as decorated up as typically

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.359 
not not as decorated up as typically
they<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.780> like<00:01:34.680> I<00:01:34.770> bet<00:01:34.920> the<00:01:35.009> general<00:01:35.310> in

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
they would be like I bet the general in

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.420 
they would be like I bet the general in
his<00:01:35.400> pick<00:01:35.640> top<00:01:35.820> light<00:01:36.030> yeah<00:01:36.210> it<00:01:36.299> looks

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:37.430 
his pick top light yeah it looks

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:40.240 
his pick top light yeah it looks
slightly<00:01:38.360> better<00:01:38.630> as<00:01:38.840> well<00:01:39.020> see<00:01:40.010> so<00:01:40.130> that

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
slightly better as well see so that

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.950 
slightly better as well see so that
guy's<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.430> standard-bearer<00:01:43.510> this<00:01:44.510> must<00:01:44.780> be<00:01:44.900> the

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
guy's a standard-bearer this must be the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.060 
guy's a standard-bearer this must be the
general<00:01:45.260> here<00:01:45.380> because<00:01:45.530> he's<00:01:45.650> carrying<00:01:45.920> a

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
general here because he's carrying a

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.520 
general here because he's carrying a
sword<00:01:46.630> yeah<00:01:47.630> I<00:01:47.900> guess<00:01:48.110> all<00:01:48.260> of<00:01:48.350> them<00:01:48.470> are

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
sword yeah I guess all of them are

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.410 
sword yeah I guess all of them are
pretty<00:01:48.680> weak<00:01:48.920> sauce<00:01:49.160> they<00:01:49.940> need<00:01:50.060> to<00:01:50.120> bring<00:01:50.300> in

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
pretty weak sauce they need to bring in

one of the few things in my mind that

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.410

fighting them from the front so that's

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:48.100 
fighting them from the front so that's
one<00:03:46.730> way<00:03:46.850> to<00:03:46.880> use<00:03:47.000> hoplites<00:03:47.570> to<00:03:47.720> try<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.020> go

probably<00:05:18.979> wasn't<00:05:19.310> the<00:05:19.490> best<00:05:19.580> to<00:05:19.940> face

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
probably wasn't the best to face

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:21.550 
probably wasn't the best to face
Carthage<00:05:20.540> but<00:05:20.720> see<00:05:20.840> that's<00:05:20.990> a<00:05:21.080> challenge

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:21.560 
Carthage but see that's a challenge

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.469 
Carthage but see that's a challenge
because<00:05:21.620> Carthage<00:05:22.280> can<00:05:22.520> bring<00:05:22.820> a<00:05:23.090> ton<00:05:23.450> of

00:05:23.469 --> 00:05:23.479 
because Carthage can bring a ton of

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.240 
because Carthage can bring a ton of
different<00:05:23.810> armies<00:05:24.260> and<00:05:24.470> to<00:05:24.620> be<00:05:24.710> quite<00:05:24.950> honest

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
different armies and to be quite honest

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.860 
different armies and to be quite honest

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669

threaten your infantry your infantry
outnumbers<00:06:32.270> my<00:06:32.539> own<00:06:32.720> by<00:06:33.139> three<00:06:33.500> units<00:06:33.710> which

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:34.430 
outnumbers my own by three units which

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:36.040 
outnumbers my own by three units which
means<00:06:34.639> you<00:06:34.729> could<00:06:34.880> have<00:06:35.000> tried<00:06:35.509> to<00:06:35.570> surround

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.050 
means you could have tried to surround

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:38.050 
means you could have tried to surround
the<00:06:36.979> challenge<00:06:37.370> was<00:06:37.490> gonna<00:06:37.550> be<00:06:37.759> from<00:06:37.970> a

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:38.060 
the challenge was gonna be from a

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.390 
the challenge was gonna be from a
cavalry<00:06:38.539> standpoint<00:06:39.110> I<00:06:39.440> have<00:06:39.800> elephants<00:06:40.220> as

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
cavalry standpoint I have elephants as

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:42.640 
cavalry standpoint I have elephants as
well<00:06:40.720> your<00:06:41.720> infantry<00:06:42.080> surround<00:06:42.440> would<00:06:42.560> have

00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:42.650 
well your infantry surround would have

00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:44.050 
well your infantry surround would have
been<00:06:42.740> hard<00:06:42.919> to<00:06:42.979> pull<00:06:43.190> off<00:06:43.220> with<00:06:43.580> the<00:06:43.699> African

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:44.060 
been hard to pull off with the African

00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:45.159 
been hard to pull off with the African
war<00:06:44.210> elephants<00:06:44.599> but<00:06:44.750> that's<00:06:44.900> where<00:06:45.020> you<00:06:45.080> would

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169 
war elephants but that's where you would

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:46.980 
war elephants but that's where you would
have<00:06:45.259> had<00:06:45.380> to<00:06:45.470> try<00:06:45.680> to<00:06:45.740> use<00:06:45.979> these<00:06:46.220> these

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:46.990 
have had to try to use these these

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.270 
have had to try to use these these
javelin<00:06:47.990> men<00:06:48.169> he<00:06:48.979> would<00:06:49.039> have<00:06:49.159> been<00:06:49.250> a

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:49.280 
javelin men he would have been a

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.800 
javelin men he would have been a
difficult<00:06:49.699> task<00:06:49.880> I<00:06:50.180> think<00:06:50.210> from<00:06:50.509> an<00:06:50.599> army

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:50.810 
difficult task I think from an army

00:06:50.810 --> 00:06:52.770 
difficult task I think from an army
standpoint<00:06:51.229> I'm<00:06:51.320> trying<00:06:51.500> to<00:06:51.560> think<00:06:51.710> a

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
standpoint I'm trying to think a

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:54.969 
standpoint I'm trying to think a
Syracuse<00:06:53.780> employer<00:06:54.349> would<00:06:54.500> be<00:06:54.530> better<00:06:54.740> off

00:06:54.969 --> 00:06:54.979 
Syracuse employer would be better off

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:58.420 
Syracuse employer would be better off
here<00:06:55.250> -<00:06:56.440> let's<00:06:57.440> think<00:06:57.770> if<00:06:58.009> you're<00:06:58.130> gonna<00:06:58.250> play

00:06:58.420 --> 00:06:58.430 
here - let's think if you're gonna play

00:06:58.430 --> 00:06:59.560 
here - let's think if you're gonna play
against<00:06:58.669> Carthage<00:06:59.090> I<00:06:59.180> think<00:06:59.300> you'd<00:06:59.389> be<00:06:59.449> better

00:06:59.560 --> 00:06:59.570 
against Carthage I think you'd be better

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.070 
against Carthage I think you'd be better
off<00:06:59.690> to<00:06:59.930> just<00:06:59.960> come<00:07:00.259> extremely<00:07:00.889> missile<00:07:01.250> heavy

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:02.080 
off to just come extremely missile heavy

00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:04.600 
off to just come extremely missile heavy
bring<00:07:03.080> probably<00:07:03.650> four<00:07:03.860> companion<00:07:04.400> calves

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:04.610 
bring probably four companion calves

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:07.749 
bring probably four companion calves
just<00:07:05.570> a<00:07:05.690> few<00:07:06.020> cheap<00:07:06.440> infantry<00:07:07.099> and<00:07:07.340> then<00:07:07.729> I

00:07:07.749 --> 00:07:07.759 
just a few cheap infantry and then I

00:07:07.759 --> 00:07:09.310 
just a few cheap infantry and then I
would<00:07:08.030> bring<00:07:08.150> a<00:07:08.270> ton<00:07:08.449> of<00:07:08.479> citizen<00:07:08.930> calves<00:07:09.139> as

00:07:09.310 --> 00:07:09.320 
would bring a ton of citizen calves as

00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:11.950 
would bring a ton of citizen calves as
well<00:07:09.500> and<00:07:09.860> the<00:07:10.789> citizen<00:07:11.150> cap<00:07:11.300> can<00:07:11.509> be<00:07:11.539> useful

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:11.960 
well and the citizen cap can be useful

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:13.360 
well and the citizen cap can be useful
in<00:07:12.080> pinning<00:07:12.380> down<00:07:12.409> sword<00:07:12.889> infantry<00:07:13.280> or

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
in pinning down sword infantry or

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.189 
in pinning down sword infantry or
hitting<00:07:13.550> them<00:07:13.729> from<00:07:13.759> behind<00:07:14.030> and<00:07:14.479> basically

00:07:15.189 --> 00:07:15.199 
hitting them from behind and basically

00:07:15.199 --> 00:07:16.749 
hitting them from behind and basically
just<00:07:15.409> make<00:07:15.590> your<00:07:15.740> army<00:07:16.009> a<00:07:16.039> little<00:07:16.250> more<00:07:16.370> mobile

00:07:16.749 --> 00:07:16.759 
just make your army a little more mobile

00:07:16.759 --> 00:07:18.879 
just make your army a little more mobile
because<00:07:17.180> your<00:07:17.300> infantry<00:07:17.719> doesn't<00:07:18.409> stand<00:07:18.800> a

00:07:18.879 --> 00:07:18.889 
because your infantry doesn't stand a

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:20.830 
because your infantry doesn't stand a
chance<00:07:18.919> of<00:07:19.340> going<00:07:19.460> toe-to-toe<00:07:19.789> with<00:07:20.330> Carthage

00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:20.840 
chance of going toe-to-toe with Carthage

00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:23.200 
chance of going toe-to-toe with Carthage
that's<00:07:21.710> just<00:07:21.889> not<00:07:22.039> gonna<00:07:22.219> happen

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:23.210 
that's just not gonna happen

00:07:23.210 --> 00:07:24.939 
that's just not gonna happen
so<00:07:23.570> a<00:07:23.599> Syracuse<00:07:24.020> you<00:07:24.380> would<00:07:24.500> want<00:07:24.680> to<00:07:24.710> play<00:07:24.889> to

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:24.949 
so a Syracuse you would want to play to

00:07:24.949 --> 00:07:25.990 
so a Syracuse you would want to play to
your<00:07:25.070> strengths<00:07:25.520> which<00:07:25.699> would<00:07:25.880> be

00:07:25.990 --> 00:07:26.000 
your strengths which would be

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.629 
your strengths which would be
skirmishing<00:07:26.810> and<00:07:27.259> the<00:07:27.740> heavy<00:07:27.949> melee<00:07:28.370> calves

00:07:28.629 --> 00:07:28.639 
skirmishing and the heavy melee calves

00:07:28.639 --> 00:07:30.159 
skirmishing and the heavy melee calves
and<00:07:28.880> the<00:07:28.969> camp<00:07:29.180> onions<00:07:29.539> and<00:07:29.780> then<00:07:29.870> the<00:07:29.930> cheaper

00:07:30.159 --> 00:07:30.169 
and the camp onions and then the cheaper

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.110 
and the camp onions and then the cheaper
citizen<00:07:30.650> calves<00:07:30.860> so<00:07:31.580> that<00:07:31.820> would<00:07:31.909> have<00:07:32.000> been

00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:32.120 
citizen calves so that would have been

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.610 
citizen calves so that would have been
the<00:07:32.210> route<00:07:32.360> that<00:07:32.539> I<00:07:32.570> would<00:07:32.750> have<00:07:32.840> taken<00:07:32.960> what

00:07:33.610 --> 00:07:33.620 
the route that I would have taken what

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.469 
the route that I would have taken what
did<00:07:33.710> it<00:07:33.830> work<00:07:33.979> not<00:07:34.219> necessarily<00:07:34.310> just<00:07:35.000> depends

00:07:35.469 --> 00:07:35.479 
did it work not necessarily just depends

00:07:35.479 --> 00:07:36.760 
did it work not necessarily just depends
elephants<00:07:35.960> are<00:07:36.050> kind<00:07:36.229> of<00:07:36.259> hard<00:07:36.409> to<00:07:36.500> deal<00:07:36.710> with

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:36.770 
elephants are kind of hard to deal with

00:07:36.770 --> 00:07:38.080 
elephants are kind of hard to deal with
the<00:07:36.949> Syracuse<00:07:37.490> you<00:07:37.639> need<00:07:37.820> to<00:07:37.909> bring<00:07:38.030> some

00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:38.090 
the Syracuse you need to bring some

00:07:38.090 --> 00:07:41.499 
the Syracuse you need to bring some
archers<00:07:38.630> or<00:07:39.310> more<00:07:40.310> light<00:07:40.849> peltasts<00:07:41.330> or

advice will help you out a little bit
here<00:07:46.430> but<00:07:46.580> just<00:07:47.150> try<00:07:47.990> and<00:07:48.050> consider<00:07:48.409> what<00:07:48.620> the

00:07:48.640 --> 00:07:48.650 
here but just try and consider what the

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:51.070 
here but just try and consider what the
the<00:07:49.130> balance<00:07:49.520> is<00:07:49.729> from<00:07:50.180> one<00:07:50.360> faction<00:07:50.779> against

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:51.080 
the balance is from one faction against

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:52.450 
the balance is from one faction against
another<00:07:51.320> when<00:07:51.620> you<00:07:51.710> make<00:07:51.860> your<00:07:52.039> army<00:07:52.250> choice

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:52.460 
another when you make your army choice

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.400 
another when you make your army choice
you<00:07:53.389> never<00:07:53.539> know<00:07:53.690> what<00:07:53.810> people<00:07:54.020> are<00:07:54.050> going<00:07:54.169> to

00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:54.410 
you never know what people are going to

00:07:54.410 --> 00:07:56.410 
you never know what people are going to
and<00:07:54.740> so<00:07:54.950> I<00:07:54.980> make<00:07:55.400> the<00:07:55.550> same<00:07:55.730> mistakes<00:07:56.120> a<00:07:56.240> lot<00:07:56.270> of

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:56.420 
and so I make the same mistakes a lot of

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.210 
and so I make the same mistakes a lot of
time<00:07:56.600> I<00:07:56.630> bring<00:07:56.900> a<00:07:57.020> crummy<00:07:57.290> army<00:07:57.590> it's<00:07:57.890> not<00:07:58.040> real

00:07:58.210 --> 00:07:58.220 
time I bring a crummy army it's not real

00:07:58.220 --> 00:07:59.560 
time I bring a crummy army it's not real
well-suited<00:07:58.580> to<00:07:58.760> fighting<00:07:59.180> who<00:07:59.450> I'm<00:07:59.540> up

00:07:59.560 --> 00:07:59.570 
well-suited to fighting who I'm up

00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:01.330 
well-suited to fighting who I'm up
against<00:07:59.990> it<00:08:00.110> happens<00:08:00.470> nothing<00:08:01.100> to<00:08:01.160> be<00:08:01.250> ashamed

00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:01.340 
against it happens nothing to be ashamed
