00:00:03.319 --> 00:00:09.809
 hello today we will see how 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:11.549
 do his painting yourself so I know 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.590
 not if you went recently bought 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:14.969
 quality paintings in stores but 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.180
 me when I see the rates 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:21.150
 yesterday I saw too much of a paint can 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.060
 from 2005 of a known brand to 58 euros 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.919
 and 2 liters and a half I tell myself that 

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:28.949
 starting to arrive in budgets that 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:30.240
 are absolutely out of reach of people 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 who want to do some work 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:35.070
 regularly then to prepare 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.560
 today this painting recipe on 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.590
 will make a flour painting 

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:45.180
 so we say pasture with flour is 

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:47.190
 food flour and we're going for 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.650
 do this painting also put 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.750
 dyes end a dye so to one 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.620
 that's what's called a word it's a 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:56.590
 powder 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.910
 this allows to color the painting we are going 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:02.680
 use linseed oil from the water and 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:04.299
 if we wanted to paint 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.340
 white we cried in dyes 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:09.009
 used for example white of meudon 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.590
 we will prepare a paint book 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:13.390
 do the test so for this lover of 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:19.270
 painting it will take us 100 g of 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:25.030
 flour have 100 g of flour it will have to 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:26.860
 also a liter of water we go all 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.390
 just after mixing the water the 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.460
 flour in a show does it's a 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:33.250
 painting that will be cooked 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.979
 we will heat water 100 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:37.630
 milliliters 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:44.320
 so I took a good hour towards 

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:46.149
 measurer here is 100 milliliters and I 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.850
 am going to incorporate the flour exactly 

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:50.850
 as if I was making a white sauce 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:56.130
 arrived before him with his strengths and 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:08.610
 lumps so I put all the flour 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:13.680
 I mix 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:27.180
 and as soon as the girls mixed I'm going 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:29.880
 add the rest so here we are at 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:33.920
 after ten minutes of boiling 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:38.820
 gets a cream a little unctuous 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:43.680
 so we're going to slow down we're going 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:47.220
 so add the pigment we will incorporate 

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:53.600
 gently like a turning point for a 

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:53.600
 liter gemmi 200 g of red pigment 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:09.440
 mixed and after we 'll add oil from 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:09.440
 lin so I add the world 1000 of the ain 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:24.780
 for more of it there are 10 centilitres 

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:29.599
 a tenth of a liter already just 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.739
 the smell already me who am relatively 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.859
 allergic to paints can you 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.599
 guarantee that it happens to have then if 

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:38.280
 we do this same painting for 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.290
 outside for example have protected the 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.950
 wood or shutters we can add a 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.659
 little iron sulphate but 

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.609
 iron it's in all the 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:50.060
 garden 

00:03:46.609 --> 00:03:52.409
 it serves to revive grass account 

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:55.230
 and it serves to protect the flaw on this 

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:59.609
 field so now we already see 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:01.500
 that these gorgeous like vox and that's 

00:03:59.609 --> 00:04:04.459
 really beautiful we will boil 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.459
 another 20 minutes 

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:11.699
 so that's so it's a painting that 

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:14.849
 is I repeat it totally green price of 

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:17.250
 comes back ridiculous since we have to do 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:20.970
 a liter roughly for 4 euros in 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.599
 these waters and that goes ideally well 

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:25.860
 to pretend woods 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:27.180
 so as I say then on 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:31.080
 outside on add a little bit of 

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.520
 iron sulphate be inside without 

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.610
 iron sulfate which is better at the 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:39.090
 health and then you see power 

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:41.789
 we still have everything to 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:49.349
 wonder is a painting that is 

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:51.570
 holds super good that covers largely I 

00:04:49.349 --> 00:04:56.460
 as much as the best painting 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:58.530
 of the market or more so for as little as 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:00.240
 you paint a medium that is really 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:05.660
 perfect you will not even have diapers 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:09.690
 to go through and then well what more can I say 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.130
 except that I encourage you to 

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.360
 do your paintings then there we did 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:15.810
 red paint but we could 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:21.389
 of course choose any league 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:23.160
 mans to make another shade and I 

00:05:21.389 --> 00:05:24.990
 so you will indicate in the article on 

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:28.199
 but under construction the places where we 

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.910
 can find good looting of 

00:05:28.199 --> 00:05:31.800
 good colors or others or 

00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:33.240
 things like that i think you're going 

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.750
 to please you with real 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.750
 good painting
