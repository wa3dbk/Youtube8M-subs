00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.490
 good morning good afternoon good night come 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:07.950
 said number 31 where we will be 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.050
 talking about the crystalline structure is 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:12.330
 of the compounds and unique 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.549
 obviously prerequisite of this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.840
 class is where number 29 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:22.289
 Good guys the crystalline compounds they 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.949
 are not there of the most important matters 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:28.560
 that we will the enem then it is one more 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.929
 matter of curiosity that same right 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.370
 explains why with compounds and unique 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:39.180
 election is they are tough but they are 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.320
 brittle and also explains why right 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.700
 is what is the compound the structure 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.149
 crystalline matter 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:50.070
 the staff had in the last class that the 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:52.050
 nal compounds of number 20 new 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:55.550
 composed and unique 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:01:02.059
 they gift their entirely sure alert 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:07.320
 that the structure of enem is an act 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:09.689
 chlorine and sodium that here know 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:12.420
 so that all voters in seattle 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:15.590
 of chlorine came to this act change only give 

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:19.290
 right for the donation, right? 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.759
 behold, we have already learned that the 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
 people know that in the structure of matter 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.540
 It's not people who study in the connections. 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.210
 chemical 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.560
 only one of them but these thousands 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.590
 millions 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.500
 understood them all in that same position 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 where we have here in the middle the coffin 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.310
 and over the years all this along with 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:46.799
 people have what is called a structure. 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.659
 crystalline structure then 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.310
 it is the person who is responsible for 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.899
 materials by the compounds and the 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:58.079
 single be brittle 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:02:00.390
 Why, look, it's a joke. Come on. 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:02.729
 because it is a hammer that gives a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.790
 crystalline compound in the 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:08.310
 composed and single it will crack the 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.390
 block it split in half and usually 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:14.110
 with a shape that in the middle quite regular 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:17.440
 So people why does this happen? 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:19.060
 the purpose of this lesson today is nothing more 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.020
 nothing less than when you descend to 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:22.209
 knock 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:24.610
 this structure that was perfect 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:27.030
 It happens to stay this way so watch 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:29.709
 that here we had equal charges 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.830
 with each other it generates a 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:37.030
 big repulsion that makes your compost 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:39.880
 to break then this is the reason why 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:44.950
 the crystalline structure of matter 

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:47.020
 undresses that they are quite brittle right 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.870
 people as I said is a good class 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.900
 simple quick fast I hope you have 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:54.670
 you already know what the 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.190
 crystalline structure of matter 

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.410
 certain people are in the sequence that we 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.640
 we will continue to see the types of connections 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:03.100
 chemical 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.800
 we will now see covalent bonds not only 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:10.230
 do not miss out on this exciting one 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.230
 strong hug and until this next meeting
