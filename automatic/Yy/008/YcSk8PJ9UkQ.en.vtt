00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
you release it let's just show you the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.560 
you release it let's just show you the
lightning<00:01:49.799> as<00:01:50.340> you<00:01:50.490> can<00:01:50.610> see<00:01:50.759> it's<00:01:50.909> black<00:01:51.180> and

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
lightning as you can see it's black and

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.289 
lightning as you can see it's black and
before<00:01:52.049> it<00:01:52.259> was<00:01:52.439> purple<00:01:53.250> or<00:01:53.369> white<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.880> can't

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
before it was purple or white I can't

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.840 
before it was purple or white I can't
remember<00:01:54.600> which<00:01:55.560> color<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:55.979> was<00:01:56.100> before<00:01:56.579> I

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
remember which color it was before I

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.859 
remember which color it was before I
believe<00:01:57.689> it<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:57.960> purple<00:01:59.000> but<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.329> 38

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
believe it was purple but it does 38

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:03.109 
believe it was purple but it does 38
damage<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.500> since<00:02:01.799> it<00:02:02.520> would<00:02:02.670> really<00:02:02.880> be

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
damage and since it would really be

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.149 
damage and since it would really be
shorter<00:02:03.509> right<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.840> but<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.469> upgrade<00:02:04.890> lets

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
shorter right now but the upgrade lets

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.389 
shorter right now but the upgrade lets
it<00:02:05.369> have<00:02:06.240> a<00:02:06.270> longer<00:02:06.689> duration<00:02:06.869> and<00:02:07.530> longer

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
it have a longer duration and longer

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:09.260 
it have a longer duration and longer
range<00:02:08.429> too

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
range too

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:12.350 
range too
so<00:02:09.990> it'd<00:02:10.080> be<00:02:10.110> shorter<00:02:10.560> than<00:02:10.680> this<00:02:10.860> if<00:02:11.850> I<00:02:12.090> didn't

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
so it'd be shorter than this if I didn't

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.480 
so it'd be shorter than this if I didn't
get<00:02:12.480> this<00:02:12.600> path<00:02:14.450> wait<00:02:15.450> did<00:02:15.630> the<00:02:15.750> sheep<00:02:16.020> just

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:16.490 
get this path wait did the sheep just

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:22.280 
get this path wait did the sheep just
yeah<00:02:17.490> I<00:02:20.510> didn't<00:02:21.510> know<00:02:21.600> lightning<00:02:21.990> would<00:02:22.140> do

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
yeah I didn't know lightning would do

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.510 
yeah I didn't know lightning would do
that<00:02:22.410> I<00:02:22.470> thought<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.710> would<00:02:22.950> be<00:02:22.980> like<00:02:23.250> water

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:23.520 
that I thought that would be like water

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.150 
that I thought that would be like water
or<00:02:23.730> something<00:02:24.240> or<00:02:24.930> like<00:02:25.050> fire<00:02:25.380> since<00:02:25.800> it<00:02:26.010> would

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
or something or like fire since it would

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.740 
or something or like fire since it would
actually<00:02:26.820> know<00:02:27.030> whatever<00:02:28.760> of<00:02:29.760> course<00:02:29.820> like

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:30.750 
actually know whatever of course like

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.260 
actually know whatever of course like
every<00:02:31.050> other<00:02:31.350> Skylander<00:02:32.100> that<00:02:32.280> flies<00:02:32.520> she<00:02:33.090> is

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:33.270 
every other Skylander that flies she is

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:35.990 
every other Skylander that flies she is
faster<00:02:33.870> which<00:02:34.620> they<00:02:34.800> did<00:02:34.980> a<00:02:35.010> real<00:02:35.340> big

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
faster which they did a real big

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:43.160 
faster which they did a real big
improvement<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.840> that<00:02:41.600> you<00:02:42.600> can<00:02:42.840> see<00:02:43.050> the

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
improvement on that you can see the

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:46.100 
improvement on that you can see the
