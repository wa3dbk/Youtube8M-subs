here at the north and then work our way
south<00:03:12.060> you<00:03:12.720> notice<00:03:13.049> we<00:03:13.170> have<00:03:13.200> an<00:03:13.500> old<00:03:13.739> roadway

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220 
south you notice we have an old roadway

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:15.920 
south you notice we have an old roadway
that<00:03:14.250> used<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.730> come<00:03:14.910> right<00:03:15.120> across<00:03:15.299> the<00:03:15.750> lake

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
so there's one of these places where one

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.449 
so there's one of these places where one
of<00:03:18.389> those<00:03:18.510> roadbeds<00:03:19.199> is<00:03:19.379> present<00:03:19.829> here's

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459

another area old road bed coming across
now<00:03:23.629> inundated<00:03:24.629> but<00:03:25.230> a<00:03:25.260> great<00:03:25.470> place<00:03:25.739> to<00:03:25.889> think

00:03:26.059 --> 00:03:26.069 
now inundated but a great place to think

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:27.890 
now inundated but a great place to think

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
might have been spawning in these areas

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.009 
might have been spawning in these areas
might<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.639> filtering<00:03:30.030> down<00:03:30.239> through<00:03:30.629> into<00:03:30.900> the

and<00:04:36.120> can<00:04:36.330> be<00:04:36.420> a<00:04:36.480> great<00:04:36.690> place<00:04:36.930> to<00:04:37.110> catch<00:04:37.290> more

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
and can be a great place to catch more

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:40.030 
and can be a great place to catch more
and<00:04:38.250> better<00:04:38.340> bass<00:04:38.610> during<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.240> postseason
