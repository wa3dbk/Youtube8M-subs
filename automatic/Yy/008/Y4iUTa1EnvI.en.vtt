 90.9 The reason is because the amount of day-to-day reset is different. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:33.920
 Even if the BMR've eaten the same amount is higher than the others, give less steamed years 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:39.710
 If the basal metabolic rate is low, even if a person weighs like a good little south side again 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:41.989
 Even if I have eaten flesh steaming said you tend to exercise our 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:45.530
 There is increase the basal metabolic rate 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:50.770
 Exercise to increase basic metabolic rate 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.770
 I'm going to ask you something like that. 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:01:04.600

 I get a lot of life and I only eat half of it. 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:20.560
 I do not suppose coming four years and built steamed 

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:23.619
 That's why I do not do exercise . 

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:30.039
 What the hell is the reason? 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:33.640
 The answer here is that the person who invited you back to the basics does nothing but 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:34.750

 I can not regret it as soon as my student, Sunyoung, becomes more basic . 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:45.729
 Because I do not know , even if I eat the same, I lose weight and exercise at the same time.

 Pray for energy. 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:56.799
 Still, one of the ways to raise the basal metabolism is the strength. 

00:01:51.069 --> 00:02:01.630
 Cleo You'd have to be one couch to the metabolic basis of this map, because muscle width 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:07.390
 When you have fat cells and 2 new honey on the same workout, 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:14.380
 Since the first cell of energy , we do not have to weigh the weight . 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:16.600
 If there are many provinces, the country will be good . 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:23.890

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:26.890

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:52.389
 But 

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.019

 Much longer 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:05.290
 Ah well itneyo president to increase the basal metabolic rate and give the temperature turned up public 

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:05.590
 I like to think about society . 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.300
