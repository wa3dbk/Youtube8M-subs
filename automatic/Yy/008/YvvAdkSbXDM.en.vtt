00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 the wind rises life I try 

00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:07.440
 it paul valÃ©ry and so cordially 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.980
 welcome to clap my review 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:14.190
 hayao miyazakis very last the whole 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.480
 came july 2013 in japanese cinemas and 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.070
 since then also ran in different 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.949
 other countries including russia 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.010
 france and the usa tells the story 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:25.199
 history of the aircraft manufacturer giro den 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.269
 20 years grew up and as 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.279
 little child always from flying and from 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.720
 Airplanes dreams in his dreams 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.910
 comes, for example, always the 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.050
 Italian aircraft manufacturer Giovanni 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.329
 caproni in front 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.700
 he gives them tips and his great 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:40.200
 Model of a day change the city 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.239
 by train but the train is 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.070
 stopped by the earthquake and that 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:46.079
 should be a fateful encounter 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.239
 his certain kind of because he has to 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.430
 first time naoko met from this 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.800
 time it then made his dream 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.079
 always getting closer in some ways 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 then comes closer to university 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.230
 then he is set 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.780
 plane designer would actually 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.489
 Now, the whole story is best 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.420
 I'm still in the audience 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.769
 leave open 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:06.510
 I think the most total man 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.650
 audience had and seen and 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.689
 That's why I do not want to be here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:11.729
 much more spoiling and not too much 

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.310
 sport and with giro- or like his full 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:16.920
 name is zero or conti we have 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.689
 a pretty realistic designed 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.580
 character quite simply from the ground 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.250
 because it's pretty autobiographical 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.680
 This work works and there was this giro 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.090
 really and he really was 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:30.450
 plane builder and also exactly this 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.210
 plane for example the Mitsubishi A5 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:35.369
 and the Mitsubishi a6 coming 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.290
 really responsible of his 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.810
 at least I have to say thoughts 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.909
 because you have this real picture of the sid 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.610
 and the character pretty much the whole 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.439
 also managed this slightly necessary art 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.970
 I would like to say makes the giro 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.640
 absolutely adorable 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:52.409
 eco is just the same network I just have to 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.930
 say my eyes are pretty good 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:55.409
 especially this succeeded 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.479
 liebesspiel 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:00.149
 wonderful relationship between morocco 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.659
 and giro is really heartwarming me 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:06.210
 must say, rarely was there such a sweet thing 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.459
 love story in which I said if 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.530
 I say films what is that mostly with 

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.430
 fantasy decorated but this one here 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.049
 is a bit different 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.000
 he rather stayed on the ground a lot 

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:16.920
 more realistic but that should be 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.489
 not be bad for just that 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.230
 It has remained wonderful on the ground 

00:02:19.489 --> 00:02:24.180
 Realistic this passion you 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.790
 in the film he feels me says myself 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:29.040
 also incredibly much interest in the 

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.230
 you can really feel the air there 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.540
 I mean by animations that will be 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.370
 All wonderful and painted here and here 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.810
 ever seen ripley movie has the 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.129
 just know how white 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.799
 and here it is not 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:43.049
 otherwise you have this wonderful gives 

00:02:40.799 --> 00:02:44.640
 let share in modern robe and that 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.680
 was just really nice to look at 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.840
 the musical accompaniment is like 

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:51.690
 most of me say films of 

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:53.190
 sochi made i believe you need 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.829
 then not much talk about it because 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.989
 which is simply awesome at every point 

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.060
 fulfill everywhere and as I said 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:02.940
 It is also very nice that that is 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.660
 whole so many real things 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.069
 I mean it's part of it 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 autobiographical elements of mine says 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:12.450
 I myself in it it is his manga the 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.030
 are kept rather hidden but 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.500
 alone on the passion to flight 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:19.139
 you can pull out this giro 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.060
 whose life is not filmed here 

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.040
 because the actions are 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:26.130
 effectively I mean he still has one 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.889
 more references to the real world because of 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.169
 for example, this earthquake that came as the 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:34.590
 train has really existed 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:36.599
 in 1923 was the great canto earthquake or 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.220
 for example, this aircraft manufacturer the 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:40.440
 always occurs in his dreams 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.120
 Giovanni Caproni went there too and 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.680
 Although the first world war of even 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.970
 aircraft built or gave them to 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:49.530
 for example, other small hidden 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.930
 allusions to thomas, for example 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.370
 man's work the magic mountain or to 

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:55.169
 example was also in a see or 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.209
 the song that only happens once that comes 

00:03:55.169 --> 00:03:59.430
 never sang again and I think exactly 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.319
 At this love of detail you can 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:01.980
 Just watch that movie with heart 

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.680
 made where 

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.060
 that's no 08 15 title 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.670
 but really masterly 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.370
 Conclusion with casino or again 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.470
 Internationally planned is doing prices 

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:16.470
 I succeed in telling the story 

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.120
 Zero the dream of flying here 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.040
 can still live yet many 

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:21.900
 love has to be controversial 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.240
 his life finds an absolute 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.430
 wonderful movie musical onanie 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.470
 motor underpinned in the studio ghibli 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.180
 are simply wonderful at any point 

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:32.970
 I could somehow mekka and how 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.010
 said these reality-related things 

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.870
 everyone knows this love of detail 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:38.760
 you can feel the second of the film 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:41.400
 It feels right here right now 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:43.410
 great is the film history at work 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.690
 and what is also quite funny is the 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:48.120
 Above all, film has absolute in asia 

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:50.430
 Controversies triggered the one say 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:52.080
 hey that's a movie of the war 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:53.880
 glorified and the other side says 

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.530
 just the other one say hey that's one 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.539
 anti-war film breast 1 patriotism 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.100
 remained more says so he is of 

00:04:57.539 --> 00:05:01.380
 both sides somehow encountered and 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.180
 they just throw the other one where we are 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:05.220
 all know that tells me the war 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:06.930
 despised and also in this work wants 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.490
 He does not really go to war 

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:10.200
 but on the fliers on the 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:12.000
 passion in it and me 

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:14.070
 find is exactly what comes over me 

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.840
 think it's a great pity that the biggest 

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:17.789
 if i even make the biggest movie 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.830
 the last years are good draws and 

00:05:17.789 --> 00:05:21.450
 says I stop but at some point he is 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:23.789
 for every closed but is the film 

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.800
 all my final film 

00:05:23.789 --> 00:05:29.039
 Righteous I think he has his wonderful 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:31.470
 rounding off the great era of masaki and her 

00:05:29.039 --> 00:05:33.090
 See already casino is an absolute 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.729
 Masterpiece I have to say quite honestly 

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:37.500
 who felt the bad in 

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.700
 I have no taste for my eyes 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:40.380
 Honestly, I should not tell them that 

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.340
 attack but somehow bad 

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:45.990
 but finds cassetti only or respectively 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.229
 Prizes is a masterpiece I run 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.120
 say I had the oscar of him 

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:52.950
 indulged but unfortunately nothing was out of it 

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:55.349
 but he has frozen here 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:57.479
 won but good I say my prices 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.250
 nothing necessarily about the movie from what 

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:00.780
 because he can still be good anyway 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.310
 even if he wins nothing and now 

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:03.840
 I would like to mention the conclusion 

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:06.180
 that the film is more in germany yet 

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.220
 no release got no date 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:10.500
 known that nothing is yet known and 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.510
 that is just silly in my eyes 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.640
 i always hate that when you go for 

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:16.710
 so absolutely succeeded after the 

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:19.320
 to deploy the original release and 

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:21.150
 I mean mirza gravel movie was indeed of 

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:23.160
 Oscar nominated would be there for 

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:24.900
 the perfect time, for example 

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.640
 time and noske rom would have been said 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:27.240
 can bring me to the cinema for 

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:29.220
 example 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.660
 but no, we still do not know 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.980
 when that comes I'll do it 

00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:33.270
 one hundred percent sure that the 

00:06:31.980 --> 00:06:35.730
 someday it will come 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:37.200
 probably universe movie fall something 

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:38.820
 It's also good because it's really good 

00:06:37.200 --> 00:06:40.830
 Synchronisations do but still 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.420
 if just stupid now I mean we 

00:06:40.830 --> 00:06:43.920
 have not heard anything yet and 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:47.910
 that means he will be the earliest 

00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:50.190
 probably at the end of 2014 somewhere in 

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:52.710
 some cinemas run only one 

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:54.540
 limited audience can see because 

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.160
 that also only somehow selected cinemas 

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.480
 are and selected cinemas in 

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.280
 Germany is then always only three 

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:01.170
 the four but for example we take 

00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.750
 the hand of the poppy in 

00:07:01.170 --> 00:07:05.700
 came in 2011 I believe in 2011 out 

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:08.130
 Japan and here we come in may 

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:09.930
 2014 'out that means when we go to 

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.390
 Go to the bill states that 

00:07:09.930 --> 00:07:13.950
 kata team for the german audience 

00:07:12.390 --> 00:07:17.070
 Three years after the release in Japan 

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:20.250
 that is, it is available at the beginning of 2015 

00:07:17.070 --> 00:07:22.890
 2016 and that's just impossible 

00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:24.750
 I think it's really stupid are 

00:07:22.890 --> 00:07:27.030
 you in my opinion or not good 

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:28.410
 quality has its price but me 

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:30.690
 my looks you this one more time 

00:07:28.410 --> 00:07:32.550
 We have releases in 

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:34.380
 France had even before that 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.360
 American release then after 

00:07:34.380 --> 00:07:38.850
 Great Britain has come too soon 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:40.710
 to spain in italy as well already 

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:42.390
 I had my screenings, you have to do that 

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:44.520
 but not even synchronize 

00:07:42.390 --> 00:07:46.290
 any screening events 

00:07:44.520 --> 00:07:47.820
 just enough but not even 

00:07:46.290 --> 00:07:49.500
 We'll get that in Germany and 

00:07:47.820 --> 00:07:51.330
 although the film even some 

00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:52.830
 Germany has covers and I think so 

00:07:51.330 --> 00:07:54.930
 just a pity there you have something 

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:57.600
 change with this little review on 

00:07:54.930 --> 00:07:59.400
 German publishing system adopted 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.500
 Today I like the review again 

00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:03.900
 is always of course all money the page 

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:05.550
 you do not like it then you do 

00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:09.410
 but quite simply a personal vision of 

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:09.410
 next video citigroup
