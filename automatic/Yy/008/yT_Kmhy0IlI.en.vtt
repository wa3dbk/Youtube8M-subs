it's a plug-and-play thing but this

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.540 
it's a plug-and-play thing but this
piece<00:00:39.050> isn't<00:00:40.050> very<00:00:40.200> difficult<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.680> take<00:00:41.340> off

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.760 
piece isn't very difficult to take off
but<00:00:42.390> you<00:00:42.629> really<00:00:43.050> need<00:00:43.170> to<00:00:43.320> know<00:00:43.440> what<00:00:43.649> you're

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
right here and then you also have two of

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:51.860 
right here and then you also have two of

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
there's also one right here the best way

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.939 
there's also one right here the best way
to<00:00:54.420> take<00:00:54.600> them<00:00:54.750> off<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:55.050> just<00:00:55.289> you<00:00:55.559> take<00:00:55.920> a

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949

screwdriver

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.670 
screwdriver
and<00:00:56.760> you<00:00:56.879> push<00:00:57.180> down<00:00:57.210> right<00:00:58.170> in<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> center

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
and you push down right in the center

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.410 
and you push down right in the center
there<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.039> then<00:00:59.730> it<00:00:59.789> will<00:00:59.879> just<00:00:59.910> come<00:01:00.270> apart

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
there and then it will just come apart

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.009 
there and then it will just come apart
and<00:01:00.870> come<00:01:01.410> right<00:01:01.590> off<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.420> then<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.510> have<00:01:03.719> one

and come right off and then you have one

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.590 
and come right off and then you have one
more<00:01:04.170> bolt<00:01:04.500> down<00:01:04.650> here<00:01:05.180> and<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.270> just<00:01:06.420> take

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
more bolt down here and you just take

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.350 
more bolt down here and you just take
this<00:01:07.049> off<00:01:07.290> these<00:01:07.680> two<00:01:07.890> snaps<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:08.790> that<00:01:09.150> one

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.660 
this off these two snaps and that one
and<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:10.229> piece<00:01:10.439> should<00:01:10.680> slide<00:01:11.040> right<00:01:11.280> back

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
and this piece should slide right back

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
and this piece should slide right back
and<00:01:12.150> come<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.540> off<00:01:12.570> there's<00:01:13.020> no<00:01:13.080> need<00:01:13.320> to

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.770 
realized I just have to push down on the
center<00:01:48.720> and<00:01:48.899> they<00:01:49.470> will<00:01:49.619> just<00:01:49.770> come<00:01:49.979> right<00:01:50.369> out

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
center and they will just come right out

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.690 
center and they will just come right out
so<00:01:51.780> do<00:01:51.990> not<00:01:52.110> try<00:01:52.500> to<00:01:52.619> like<00:01:52.979> break<00:01:53.280> those<00:01:53.520> or

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
so do not try to like break those or

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.850 
so do not try to like break those or
anything<00:01:53.850> I<00:01:54.060> did<00:01:54.240> break<00:01:54.390> one<00:01:54.540> right<00:01:54.689> here<00:01:55.049> but

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
anything I did break one right here but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.620 
anything I did break one right here but
that<00:01:56.189> wasn't<00:01:56.310> a<00:01:56.460> big<00:01:56.579> deal<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:56.939> just<00:01:57.090> went<00:01:57.509> to

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
that wasn't a big deal it just went to

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.270 
that wasn't a big deal it just went to
the<00:01:57.780> auto<00:01:58.110> parts<00:01:58.229> store<00:01:58.530> I've<00:01:58.770> got<00:01:58.920> a<00:01:58.950> new<00:01:59.130> one
