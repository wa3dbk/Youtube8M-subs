00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that was um from 92 to 95 I think and

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:44.060 
that was um from 92 to 95 I think and
don't<00:00:42.120> hearing<00:00:42.450> anyway<00:00:42.660> so<00:00:43.079> yeah<00:00:43.290> that's<00:00:43.620> gone

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
don't hearing anyway so yeah that's gone

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.459 
don't hearing anyway so yeah that's gone
and<00:00:44.309> I<00:00:44.640> did<00:00:44.820> spend<00:00:45.030> like<00:00:45.210> 50k<00:00:45.600> tokens<00:00:46.110> you<00:00:46.350> know

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
and I did spend like 50k tokens you know

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.619 
and I did spend like 50k tokens you know
repairing<00:00:46.800> my<00:00:46.890> rapier<00:00:47.280> because<00:00:47.910> I<00:00:48.270> really

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
repairing my rapier because I really

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:49.700 
repairing my rapier because I really
didn't<00:00:48.809> feel<00:00:48.870> like<00:00:48.930> spending<00:00:49.170> too<00:00:49.379> much<00:00:49.410> time

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
didn't feel like spending too much time

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.580 
didn't feel like spending too much time
so<00:00:50.510> 188<00:00:51.510> k<00:00:51.719> was<00:00:51.870> definitely<00:00:52.199> a<00:00:52.230> better<00:00:52.350> option

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:52.590 
so 188 k was definitely a better option

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.709 
so 188 k was definitely a better option
and<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.010> 18k<00:00:53.579> tokens<00:00:53.969> which<00:00:54.120> isn't<00:00:54.390> bad<00:00:54.420> it's
