00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
especially in the beginning because you

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:03.799 
especially in the beginning because you
can<00:01:02.579> pull<00:01:02.789> muscles<00:01:03.210> and<00:01:03.420> if<00:01:03.480> you<00:01:03.570> pull<00:01:03.780> a

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
can pull muscles and if you pull a

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.620 
can pull muscles and if you pull a
muscle<00:01:04.220> you'll<00:01:05.220> be<00:01:05.549> in<00:01:05.640> pain<00:01:05.850> for<00:01:06.000> a<00:01:06.090> while<00:01:06.240> and

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
muscle you'll be in pain for a while and

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.980 
muscle you'll be in pain for a while and
you<00:01:07.140> could<00:01:07.290> also<00:01:07.409> do<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> individual<00:01:08.340> fingers

00:01:08.980 --> 00:01:08.990 
you could also do the individual fingers

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.250 
you could also do the individual fingers
and<00:01:11.210> pull<00:01:12.210> back<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.659> hold<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.930> for<00:01:13.080> five

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
and pull back and hold it for five

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:17.630

even want to pull down at all just it's
even<00:01:40.650> actually<00:01:41.009> easier<00:01:41.430> to<00:01:41.670> pull<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> muscle

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
even actually easier to pull a muscle

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.940 
even actually easier to pull a muscle
this<00:01:42.509> way<00:01:42.720> so<00:01:42.780> just<00:01:43.290> want<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> be<00:01:44.040> really<00:01:44.310> light

and that's enough pressure to stretch
the<00:01:53.729> muscles<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.299> you<00:01:54.630> could<00:01:54.780> really<00:01:54.960> feel<00:01:55.110> it

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
the muscles and you could really feel it
