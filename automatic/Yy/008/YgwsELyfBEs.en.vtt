00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:12.550
 then he was arrested in 72 against in 

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:13.900
 that was traveling down Avenue 3 that 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.240
 in the information that we have of 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.990
 people who were there was passing by 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.300
 the crisis in south-north direction ok to 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.120
 getting the 78 was approached by some 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.710
 Peronists from various corners to 20 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:30.800
 people 15 think to 10 manifests 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:33.680
 they went down and wanted to download all the 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.060
 Sundays the passengers 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:38.730
 apparently carbozulia workers 

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:42.150
 because it 's the toy assigned to charge 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.850
 yours although he says this I do not understand that of 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.980
 those from houston 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.890
 forced the passengers then we go to 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.089
 take to the outside after having woven 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:53.899
 I had a compromising corner not for another 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:55.850
 the 77 contracted software ciphers and 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.699
 they started good 

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.879
 causing more to the vehicle with 

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:03.800
 strong gestures but in light of the 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.130
 mica the front glasses and 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:08.500
 subsequently appeared 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.259
 a love like all the solid and then 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.210
 they allowed the party for the part 

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:13.990
 lead 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.420
 fortunately good because we mark 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.579
 he quickly controlled the situation because 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.960
 we seem actively against 

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:22.899
 organizations that managed to combine it to 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.030
 leave to withdraw from them whose achievement 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.060
 inside as a fool without units and 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.000
 we do not actively 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.979
 in five minutes control the situation 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 but an approximate loss of 90 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.850
 hundred 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.850
 why 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:43.000
 the equipment risk are super safe 

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:47.040
 natural they use 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.040
 but no more opening a valve 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:54.799
 that is, there could have been a risk of explosion 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.930
 if a cylinder of those receipts so 

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.720
 minus 30 from 30 to 45 minutes flame 

00:01:56.930 --> 00:02:01.110
 direct we would have had a situation 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.300
 plus 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.590
 nice in the global sector there was no 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.590
 report of some injured 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:16.470
 approximately how much time they spent 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:18.860
 to be able to smother the flames twelve and 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.860
 nine minutes 

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.260
 placed between 4 and 8 and the bus with you 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:36.239
 they left he stayed there 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:39.810
 if he would stay he was already the people of 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:42.500
 contribution of all the coordination for 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:42.500
 children
