00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.080
 hi i'm going to show you four ways 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:05.819
 to make front of what reached 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.859
 so the fucking squats front 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.090
 basic exercise to work the 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:11.040
 legs and especially the quads 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.740
 the point of interest is that as we have 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.089
 the load in front of me suddenly we have the back 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 who has his rights and even that he remains 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.359
 right during the whole descent during 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.859
 all the movement so suddenly it's 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.689
 interesting enough for the column 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.180
 it allows to work while preserving 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:26.010
 bassil here we all broke a little bit or 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:28.230
 what can this be interesting for 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.390
 the last ones and all that is my case 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.980
 so that's why I say that's it 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.480
 so why 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.070
 technically it's a work the quads 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.469
 questions for a champion in fact that's 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.640
 because as you keep your back straight 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:44.520
 you go down there the opening of the 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:48.239
 the pelvis is not going to be too busy 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.370
 it's more the shin joint and 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:52.350
 femurs that will close much when 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.760
 you're going down and so what is it 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.250
 that activate the knee joint 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:58.739
 it's the quadriceps, so the quadriceps 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.739
 is going to be asked a lot with the forehead 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.149
 squat so that's also allows as 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.060
 we have the right back and the center of 

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:11.100
 gravity properly placed to go down 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.869
 a lot and so suddenly let's say with 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.210
 the squat with the squats bac it's not 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.009
 necessarily easy to get down to more than 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.009
 parallel one must have morphology 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:21.990
 for and all but well if we force ourselves 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.189
 after we tend to break the back 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.450
 becomes dangerous for the new by 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:25.890
 against with the front of squats one can 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.290
 go down much more easily so 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.689
 that's good too it's an advantage 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.200
 it helps to stimulate all that 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.240
 is a few times one or two degrees 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.650
 charge becomes enormously bigger 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.259
 that's the end of the technique 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:45.119
 exercises so first that's all 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.700
 simply with a long bar the bottom 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.090
 classic squat dumbbell position one 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:53.549
 little clean to load the bar and 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.100
 here we go so I'm gone 

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:56.840
 soil to do it 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:58.820
 I made a clean if you have a rack 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:01.479
 or candles you can take the 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:03.860
 position with a hand on the shoulder 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.990
 opposite to rest the bar it's on 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:08.330
 the on the shoulders a little bit a 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.310
 like that like what a little bit 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.190
 in the east in the gyms this 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.819
 we see a lot and that's good 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:19.040
 it's a rather old form 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:21.770
 school a seen compares with the movement 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:24.560
 it's really clean 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.860
 and we feel very good we are we are 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.930
 we 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:29.150
 we are well in power with this 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:32.239
 position there secondly so if you 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:34.489
 do not have a bar there with dumbbells on 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:36.800
 can do it too so see it I 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.660
 take a big alter now if you 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:40.340
 have a small goal you can 

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.900
 go down and everything is if you do some 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.569
 its rays you will see it works 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.459
 also very well there the alter that I have there 

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.709
 on top he does it makes 36 kg was 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.160
 not even huge and even with 

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:53.810
 dumbbells even smaller than that good 

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:56.209
 it can work well after that too 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.500
 depends how how do you rock and that 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.799
 also depends on your time of 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.720
 contraction at each crepe obviously 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.760
 then we have with the two alternates 

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:06.230
 not if you too at home do not have 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.720
 no place or what to have a great 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:10.100
 bar or that you do not have one that 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:11.570
 at home it's tiling that you 

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.519
 are renting and that you 

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:17.060
 would annoy a little to throw the bar of 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:19.400
 81 kg on the ground and that suddenly you 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:21.920
 do not get back your deposit you can 

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.850
 use the two little dumbbell like that 

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:26.410
 so you're the same 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:29.140
 you load your little dumbbell good 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:31.960
 inevitably it will be the slightest advantage 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.600
 it's that you can take hold 

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:38.380
 hammer or footprints as with a 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:39.880
 bar as I'm doing there and ben that's it 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:42.070
 lets you work the squat front 

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.860
 with little alter and that's a way 

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:48.100
 also to be adaptive to the 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:50.590
 gear that you have latest techniques 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.750
 fourth then there is primitive 

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:54.430
 it's old school in fact we can 

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.960
 to do with body weight is obviously 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:57.490
 of view that it is a little bit light 

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:59.620
 just to body weight you can 

00:03:57.490 --> 00:04:01.510
 to load a stone that's for your 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:04.030
 training in the forest in nature or 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:06.280
 what do you take a stone you you the 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.230
 charge and you can sling squatter 

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:10.180
 with that then look at the level of 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:12.120
 position to one is in the trunk of 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:16.960
 squats and at the level of taking 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:19.239
 it looks a little bit more like duzert 

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:20.739
 squat heart you know the squad of 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.720
 cheats where we take the bar like that 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.000
 which avoids having a whole 

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:27.010
 candle installation and everything is 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.810
 to take very heavy here we are a 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.910
 little bit dense in that style with 

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.950
 the stone is a stone is 

00:04:30.910 --> 00:04:34.810
 always fun to work it's 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.820
 taken a little improbable so that 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.460
 work done other things too that 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.950
 use other things a little bit 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:45.010
 more instinctive sheathing and all that 

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:46.450
 is good ben I find it boring I 

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.590
 find these four techniques enough 

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:49.900
 interesting and has something for everyone 

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.640
 all situations we will train 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.640
 you well with that I prepared you a 

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.740
 little pdf program on people but 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.470
 especially the quadriceps based on the forehead 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:02.260
 this squat if you want to get it back 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.480
 click here and here I am you 

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.650
 let's go buy myself some 

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.650
 cigarettes has more
