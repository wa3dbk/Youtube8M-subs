00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:20.970 
I go back you can also have different
ones<00:02:17.549> the<00:02:18.549> actions<00:02:18.940> pop<00:02:19.180> up<00:02:19.410> I'm<00:02:20.410> not<00:02:20.709> exactly

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:20.980 
ones the actions pop up I'm not exactly

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:23.670 
ones the actions pop up I'm not exactly
sure<00:02:21.130> this<00:02:21.519> does<00:02:21.790> just<00:02:22.780> tap<00:02:22.989> on<00:02:23.109> a<00:02:23.170> field<00:02:23.500> and

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:23.680 
sure this does just tap on a field and

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.930 
sure this does just tap on a field and
select<00:02:23.799> different<00:02:24.220> action<00:02:26.730> right<00:02:29.670> and<00:02:30.670> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
select different action right and I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.970 
select different action right and I
guess<00:02:31.150> so<00:02:31.480> you<00:02:31.540> can<00:02:31.870> peek<00:02:32.049> private<00:02:32.769> browsing

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
guess so you can peek private browsing

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
guess so you can peek private browsing
