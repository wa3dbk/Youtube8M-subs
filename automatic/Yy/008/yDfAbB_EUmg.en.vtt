00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:40.320 
three of these I believe I counted him

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.440

because<00:01:40.619> I<00:01:40.770> was<00:01:41.490> getting<00:01:41.670> really<00:01:41.939> pissed<00:01:42.210> off

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
because I was getting really pissed off

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:44.149
