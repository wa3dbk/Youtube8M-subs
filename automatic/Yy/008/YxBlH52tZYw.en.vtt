00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:28.450 
come out of the modest family but that
we<00:04:25.700> have<00:04:25.850> not<00:04:26.650> discovered<00:04:27.650> them<00:04:27.920> yet<00:04:27.950> so

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:28.460 
we have not discovered them yet so

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.490 
we have not discovered them yet so
that's<00:04:29.240> what's<00:04:29.480> showing<00:04:29.660> you<00:04:29.780> is<00:04:29.990> showing<00:04:30.350> me

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
that's what's showing you is showing me

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.830 
that's what's showing you is showing me
the<00:04:30.710> one<00:04:30.950> with<00:04:31.220> the<00:04:31.250> exclamation<00:04:31.640> that<00:04:32.450> one<00:04:32.690> we

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840 
the one with the exclamation that one we

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:34.660 
the one with the exclamation that one we
have<00:04:33.080> discovered<00:04:33.590> which<00:04:33.770> is<00:04:33.980> the<00:04:34.130> meadows<00:04:34.520> I

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
have discovered which is the meadows I

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.130 
have discovered which is the meadows I
think<00:04:34.880> the<00:04:35.000> red<00:04:35.180> around<00:04:35.480> means<00:04:35.690> the<00:04:35.840> metals

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.140 
think the red around means the metals

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:38.440 
think the red around means the metals
because<00:04:36.290> the<00:04:36.560> meadows<00:04:36.860> and<00:04:37.070> the<00:04:37.130> modest<00:04:37.490> can

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:38.450 
because the meadows and the modest can

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.640 
because the meadows and the modest can
be<00:04:39.490> you<00:04:40.490> can<00:04:40.730> mix<00:04:41.300> and<00:04:41.480> match<00:04:41.540> and<00:04:41.960> breed<00:04:42.320> them

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
be you can mix and match and breed them

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.670 
be you can mix and match and breed them
you<00:04:43.070> know<00:04:43.220> together<00:04:43.580> so<00:04:43.940> so<00:04:44.750> that's<00:04:45.050> why<00:04:45.650> it's

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
you know together so so that's why it's

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:48.850 
you know together so so that's why it's
showing<00:04:45.920> that<00:04:46.280> but<00:04:46.900> pretty<00:04:47.900> much<00:04:47.990> because

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
showing that but pretty much because

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.590 
showing that but pretty much because
that<00:04:49.040> be<00:04:49.280> has<00:04:49.550> been<00:04:49.700> discovered<00:04:50.030> then<00:04:50.330> we<00:04:50.480> know

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:50.600 
that be has been discovered then we know

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600 
that be has been discovered then we know
we<00:04:50.750> can<00:04:50.900> breed<00:04:51.200> those<00:04:51.470> only<00:04:52.010> the<00:04:52.160> ones<00:04:52.190> we<00:04:52.520> have

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:52.610 
we can breed those only the ones we have

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:54.490 
we can breed those only the ones we have
discovered<00:04:53.000> then<00:04:53.330> we<00:04:53.480> know<00:04:53.660> once<00:04:53.930> we<00:04:54.050> discover

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
discovered then we know once we discover

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.680 
discovered then we know once we discover
new<00:04:54.770> one<00:04:54.980> it'll<00:04:55.610> show<00:04:55.820> up<00:04:55.910> there<00:04:56.120> and<00:04:56.300> we<00:04:56.390> place

00:04:56.680 --> 00:04:56.690 
new one it'll show up there and we place

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:58.150 
new one it'll show up there and we place
it<00:04:56.720> in<00:04:57.020> here<00:04:57.200> and<00:04:57.290> then<00:04:57.380> it'll<00:04:57.560> show<00:04:57.800> up<00:04:57.890> there

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:58.160 
it in here and then it'll show up there

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.340 
it in here and then it'll show up there
in<00:04:58.669> one<00:04:59.030> of<00:04:59.060> the<00:04:59.210> question<00:04:59.540> marks<00:04:59.870> so<00:05:00.020> then<00:05:00.169> we

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
in one of the question marks so then we

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:02.110 
in one of the question marks so then we
know<00:05:00.500> see<00:05:00.770> under<00:05:01.070> the<00:05:01.100> modest<00:05:01.610> now<00:05:01.760> we<00:05:01.820> know

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:02.120 
know see under the modest now we know

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.270 
know see under the modest now we know
all<00:05:02.330> those<00:05:02.510> question<00:05:02.900> marks<00:05:02.930> or<00:05:03.260> B's<00:05:03.470> that<00:05:04.130> we

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:04.280 
all those question marks or B's that we

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:08.140 
all those question marks or B's that we
can<00:05:04.430> breed<00:05:04.760> and<00:05:05.440> with<00:05:06.440> the<00:05:06.560> modest<00:05:06.950> and<00:05:07.220> or

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:08.150 
can breed and with the modest and or

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:10.030 
can breed and with the modest and or
come<00:05:08.360> out<00:05:08.510> of<00:05:08.660> the<00:05:08.750> modest<00:05:09.110> you<00:05:09.320> know<00:05:09.440> breeding

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:10.040 
come out of the modest you know breeding

00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:12.970 
come out of the modest you know breeding
and<00:05:10.250> so<00:05:11.000> that's<00:05:11.180> the<00:05:11.419> idea<00:05:11.810> of<00:05:12.020> the<00:05:12.050> peppers

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:12.980 
and so that's the idea of the peppers

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.250 
and so that's the idea of the peppers
chest<00:05:13.310> that's<00:05:14.120> the<00:05:14.330> information<00:05:14.840> it<00:05:14.990> gives

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:15.260 
chest that's the information it gives

00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:18.400 
chest that's the information it gives
you<00:05:15.500> so<00:05:15.830> it<00:05:16.130> is<00:05:16.190> helpful<00:05:16.760> we<00:05:17.750> will<00:05:17.960> make<00:05:18.140> some

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
you so it is helpful we will make some

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.560 
you so it is helpful we will make some
other<00:05:18.530> items<00:05:18.890> that<00:05:19.010> will<00:05:19.100> help<00:05:19.310> us<00:05:19.520> learn<00:05:19.850> what

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
other items that will help us learn what

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.170 
other items that will help us learn what
we<00:05:20.750> can<00:05:20.780> breed<00:05:21.169> with<00:05:21.380> them<00:05:21.560> more<00:05:22.280> in<00:05:22.640> detail<00:05:23.150> I

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:23.180 
we can breed with them more in detail I

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.700 
we can breed with them more in detail I
mean<00:05:23.360> we<00:05:23.480> have<00:05:23.660> the<00:05:23.780> habitat<00:05:24.200> locator<00:05:24.650> which

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:24.710 
mean we have the habitat locator which

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:27.520 
mean we have the habitat locator which
is<00:05:24.980> great<00:05:25.190> but<00:05:25.910> this<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.660> a<00:05:26.690> great<00:05:26.990> place<00:05:27.229> to

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
is great but this is a great place to

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.740 
is great but this is a great place to
save<00:05:27.770> your<00:05:28.010> bees<00:05:28.190> organize<00:05:28.910> your<00:05:29.240> Minecraft

00:05:29.740 --> 00:05:29.750

00:05:57.909 --> 00:05:57.919 
the beekeeping is a really hard part of

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.120 
the beekeeping is a really hard part of
forestry<00:05:58.669> i<00:05:58.700> mean<00:05:58.910> i<00:05:59.060> love<00:05:59.330> it<00:05:59.540> but<00:06:00.229> it<00:06:00.590> gets<00:06:00.950> a

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:01.130 
forestry i mean i love it but it gets a

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:02.500 
forestry i mean i love it but it gets a
little<00:06:01.250> complicated<00:06:01.460> you<00:06:02.030> know<00:06:02.150> it's<00:06:02.330> not<00:06:02.450> the

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 
little complicated you know it's not the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:05.230 
little complicated you know it's not the
easiest<00:06:02.720> um<00:06:03.530> thing<00:06:04.400> you<00:06:04.550> really<00:06:04.729> have<00:06:05.000> to<00:06:05.150> get

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:05.240 
easiest um thing you really have to get

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:07.300 
easiest um thing you really have to get
into<00:06:05.419> it<00:06:05.570> and<00:06:05.900> really<00:06:05.990> have<00:06:06.380> to<00:06:06.500> try<00:06:06.770> so<00:06:07.100> many

00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:07.310 
into it and really have to try so many

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.900 
into it and really have to try so many
different<00:06:07.550> you<00:06:07.910> know<00:06:08.890> mixes<00:06:09.890> and<00:06:10.010> matches<00:06:10.280> so
