00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:58.819 
so I'm going to add some more fuel to
the<00:00:57.149> fire<00:00:57.360> but<00:00:57.690> I<00:00:57.930> think<00:00:58.379> that<00:00:58.410> would<00:00:58.680> have

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
the fire but I think that would have

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.400 
the fire but I think that would have
enough<00:00:59.129> at<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.399> back<00:00:59.550> anyway<00:00:59.940> I<00:01:00.539> do<00:01:00.870> want<00:01:01.320> us

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
enough at the back anyway I do want us

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.590 
enough at the back anyway I do want us
to<00:01:01.530> start<00:01:01.770> with<00:01:01.920> Fernando<00:01:02.370> Torres<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:03.030> think<00:01:03.510> it

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
to start with Fernando Torres I think it

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.210 
to start with Fernando Torres I think it
was<00:01:03.690> kind<00:01:03.840> of<00:01:03.989> stupid<00:01:04.320> ready<00:01:04.739> to<00:01:04.920> let<00:01:05.040> them

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
was kind of stupid ready to let them

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.070 
was kind of stupid ready to let them
about<00:01:05.549> play<00:01:05.790> a<00:01:05.820> whole<00:01:06.000> 45<00:01:06.450> minutes<00:01:06.930> in<00:01:07.020> the

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
about play a whole 45 minutes in the

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.330 
about play a whole 45 minutes in the
first<00:01:07.229> game<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:07.560> should<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.920> been<00:01:07.950> Romelu

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
first game that should have been Romelu

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.700 
first game that should have been Romelu

they're<00:01:12.540> fighting<00:01:13.229> for<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.970> stripped<00:01:14.970> of<00:01:15.150> the

I think really now it is where you start
to<00:01:18.930> think<00:01:18.960> about<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.380> whole<00:01:19.530> game<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.950> want<00:01:20.400> to

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
a start with Sen and my ankle so we'd

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:30.679

score<00:01:54.990> again<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> think<00:01:55.860> that<00:01:56.070> we<00:01:56.250> have<00:01:56.430> a

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
score again so I think that we have a

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:57.590 
score again so I think that we have a
very<00:01:56.700> good<00:01:56.939> chance<00:01:57.000> is<00:01:57.329> going<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.509> be<00:01:57.570> a

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:57.600 
very good chance is going to be a

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.080 
very good chance is going to be a
