hi<00:00:07.049> this<00:00:07.109> is<00:00:07.259> Robin<00:00:07.620> at<00:00:07.740> NAMM<00:00:07.950> 2010<00:00:08.790> and<00:00:08.970> I<00:00:09.000> want

00:00:09.169 --> 00:00:09.179 
hi this is Robin at NAMM 2010 and I want

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:10.430 
hi this is Robin at NAMM 2010 and I want
to<00:00:09.269> introduce<00:00:09.389> you<00:00:09.750> to<00:00:09.780> our<00:00:09.900> new<00:00:10.170> line<00:00:10.410> of

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
to introduce you to our new line of

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.589 
to introduce you to our new line of
monitor<00:00:10.889> stands<00:00:11.340> which<00:00:11.759> were<00:00:11.910> very<00:00:12.179> excited

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:12.599 
monitor stands which were very excited

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.970 
monitor stands which were very excited
about<00:00:14.990> so<00:00:15.990> starting<00:00:16.289> on<00:00:16.320> top<00:00:16.470> of<00:00:16.619> bottom<00:00:16.770> we

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
about so starting on top of bottom we

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:18.320 
about so starting on top of bottom we
really<00:00:17.310> looked<00:00:17.520> at<00:00:17.609> redesigning<00:00:17.940> these

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
really looked at redesigning these

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.500 
really looked at redesigning these
stands<00:00:18.779> every<00:00:19.380> feature<00:00:20.029> so<00:00:21.029> we<00:00:21.119> start<00:00:21.330> with<00:00:21.449> a

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:21.510 
stands every feature so we start with a

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.439 
stands every feature so we start with a
diecast<00:00:21.930> base<00:00:22.289> super<00:00:22.650> heavy-duty<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.550> lot<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
diecast base super heavy-duty a lot of

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.810 
diecast base super heavy-duty a lot of
weight<00:00:24.630> so<00:00:24.900> help<00:00:25.080> stabilize<00:00:25.529> the<00:00:25.560> stand<00:00:26.010> helps

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:26.820 
weight so help stabilize the stand helps

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.240 
weight so help stabilize the stand helps
D<00:00:26.970> couple<00:00:27.359> it<00:00:28.109> comes<00:00:28.320> with<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.529> rubber<00:00:28.650> foot<00:00:29.010> cap

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
D couple it comes with a rubber foot cap

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.189 
D couple it comes with a rubber foot cap
and<00:00:29.580> it<00:00:29.820> also<00:00:30.000> has<00:00:30.300> a<00:00:30.330> spike<00:00:30.689> underneath<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
and it also has a spike underneath the

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:32.569 
and it also has a spike underneath the
rubber<00:00:31.410> foot<00:00:31.529> cap<00:00:31.740> so<00:00:31.949> you<00:00:31.980> can<00:00:32.160> couple<00:00:32.309> it<00:00:32.460> to

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
rubber foot cap so you can couple it to

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:33.549 
rubber foot cap so you can couple it to
the<00:00:32.669> floor

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:33.559 
the floor

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:36.080 
the floor
these<00:00:34.559> are<00:00:34.710> d<00:00:34.860> couplers<00:00:35.309> these<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.760> emitted

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090 
these are d couplers these are emitted

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.150 
these are d couplers these are emitted
of<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> super<00:00:36.540> hard<00:00:36.750> rubber<00:00:37.020> to<00:00:37.649> help<00:00:37.860> prevent

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
of a super hard rubber to help prevent

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.130 
of a super hard rubber to help prevent
sound<00:00:39.059> vibrations<00:00:39.570> from<00:00:39.629> going<00:00:39.960> through<00:00:39.989> the

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
sound vibrations from going through the

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.860 
sound vibrations from going through the
stand<00:00:40.469> to<00:00:41.129> all<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.280> way<00:00:41.370> to<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> floor<00:00:41.870> then

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
stand to all the way to the floor then

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.170 
stand to all the way to the floor then
it's<00:00:43.079> an<00:00:43.170> aluminum<00:00:43.440> channel<00:00:43.890> column<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:45.030> has

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
it's an aluminum channel column it has

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.510 
it's an aluminum channel column it has
three<00:00:45.510> channels<00:00:45.960> one<00:00:46.860> for<00:00:47.100> loading<00:00:47.370> with

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
three channels one for loading with

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.959 
three channels one for loading with
sander<00:00:47.850> shot<00:00:48.149> two<00:00:48.719> for<00:00:49.050> a<00:00:49.350> cable<00:00:49.739> one<00:00:50.670> for<00:00:50.850> your

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
sander shot two for a cable one for your

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.299 
sander shot two for a cable one for your
power<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.449> for<00:00:51.660> your<00:00:51.750> signal<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:53.070> uses

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
power one for your signal if it uses

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:55.069 
power one for your signal if it uses
another<00:00:53.610> D<00:00:53.850> couple<00:00:54.210> up<00:00:54.390> here<00:00:54.600> out<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.780> the<00:00:54.840> hard

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
another D couple up here out of the hard

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:58.240 
another D couple up here out of the hard
rubber<00:00:55.670> then<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.760> die<00:00:56.940> cast<00:00:57.149> top<00:00:57.510> plate

00:00:58.240 --> 00:00:58.250 
rubber then a die cast top plate

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:00.920 
rubber then a die cast top plate
what<00:00:59.250> makes<00:00:59.430> these<00:00:59.520> really<00:00:59.789> unique<00:01:00.059> is<00:01:00.480> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
what makes these really unique is the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.369 
what makes these really unique is the
fact<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.820> one<00:01:02.820> height<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.719> Stan<00:01:04.019> this

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
fact that one height of Stan this

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.039 
fact that one height of Stan this
particular<00:01:04.680> model<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.250> M<00:01:05.369> is<00:01:05.489> 100<00:01:06.090> you<00:01:06.750> can<00:01:06.930> get

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
particular model to M is 100 you can get

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:08.870 
particular model to M is 100 you can get
any<00:01:07.229> angle<00:01:07.710> so<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.220> whole<00:01:08.340> top<00:01:08.610> plate

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
any angle so the whole top plate

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.780 
any angle so the whole top plate
actually<00:01:09.210> rotates<00:01:09.780> on<00:01:10.380> top<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.100> stand<00:01:11.400> and

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
actually rotates on top of the stand and

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.550 
actually rotates on top of the stand and
the<00:01:12.360> plate<00:01:12.600> itself<00:01:13.340> is<00:01:14.340> angle<00:01:15.180> adjustable<00:01:15.630> so

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:16.560 
the plate itself is angle adjustable so

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.530 
the plate itself is angle adjustable so
you<00:01:16.590> can<00:01:16.770> really<00:01:17.189> hit<00:01:17.310> that<00:01:17.430> sweet<00:01:17.700> spot<00:01:17.759> you

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
you can really hit that sweet spot you

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
you can really hit that sweet spot you
can<00:01:18.689> have<00:01:18.840> a<00:01:18.869> Down<00:01:19.860> sloping<00:01:20.070> angle<00:01:20.640> or<00:01:20.790> an

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
can have a Down sloping angle or an

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.370 
can have a Down sloping angle or an
upslope<00:01:21.210> an<00:01:21.390> angle<00:01:21.630> depend<00:01:21.930> on<00:01:21.990> how<00:01:22.110> you<00:01:22.170> want

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
upslope an angle depend on how you want

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.499 
upslope an angle depend on how you want
to<00:01:22.439> rotate<00:01:22.619> it<00:01:22.950> infinitely<00:01:23.880> adjustable<00:01:23.970> with

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
to rotate it infinitely adjustable with

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.950 
to rotate it infinitely adjustable with
a<00:01:24.600> knob<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.990> back<00:01:26.270> it<00:01:27.270> also<00:01:27.420> has<00:01:27.780> an
