00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:18.730

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.380
 children where am i got one piece 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.510
 childhood brought me was two weeks 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.630
 These two crazy ones once like blood 

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:27.070
 and once marketplaces academy and 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.050
 Of course you know me when I am 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.550
 I'm on the road when you're right 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.100
 it can be crazy for people who are crazy 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.450
 So really crazy gas there must 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:35.950
 you get in front of the camera and so 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.430
 spontaneously as always asked for you there 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.290
 outside 

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:39.550
 Do not you want to sell my stuff that way? 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.470
 it's still a tip for executives 

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.399
 Give and catch the lady 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:45.910
 Of course, first 

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:52.650
 I have a lot of speech patterns about him 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:54.940
 heard a lot about matte be yes experience 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.210
 Communicate with people where you are 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.070
 first he so there is this saying it 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.500
 if shot first impression 

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:03.790
 you do not like that the first time 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.250
 mirror so contacts the war as 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.350
 seller if you feel what are you doing 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.990
 then the people or sellers so it is 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.479
 Only the feeling I have is that it 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.250
 even a human being that is one 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:16.420
 he has his subjects he has 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.969
 similar problems 

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:20.439
 and who can I help those like 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:21.520
 can i do the supportive better 

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:24.039
 To make a decision 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.439
 the ready to support yourself better too 

00:01:24.039 --> 00:01:28.359
 feel great product to buy from that 

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:29.889
 I'm sure she will do it again 

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:32.259
 say I want to be convinced of that 

00:01:29.889 --> 00:01:34.600
 what I sell and if it convinces 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:36.249
 That's the best product that's what you do 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.000
 How can I easily handle this? 

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:40.520
 make me into his world 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:43.040
 to act from the others in his world 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.630
 and how I know the times with 

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.010
 very simple things what is so 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.930
 typical time for you where you are relative 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:50.950
 fast as if you did not 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:53.330
 trained it is for you nlp 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 had to program neurolinguistic programming 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.080
 necessarily google totally cool if you 

00:01:55.729 --> 00:01:58.960
 it is not well trained but 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:01.460
 just a normal people know 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.320
 where do you fix it or constituency circle 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.270
 recognize with quick three ideas 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.920
 So for me very much did not speak 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.070
 to pay attention to such as now in the 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:12.140
 perception channel as the simplest as 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:14.870
 in which berlins channel sends the says 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.920
 he I see what I hear what I would 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.480
 like to feel that 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 these are the basics for me 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.800
 absolute basics advocacy ones 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.440
 to listen and say what does he want 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.030
 not visible in my view I 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.520
 I would now look at the car me 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.290
 I would now see these products 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.700
 but maybe hear that again 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:35.300
 which again that for and against that 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:38.030
 touch what you want to say 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.180
 the ok yes I hear something he wants 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.180
 Not 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.790
 and I like her a lot 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.790
 done 

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:50.269
 many say yes you should not one 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.440
 Just touch it, but it 's me 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:51.980
 've found out find it totally 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:53.750
 class 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.910
 I sometimes have salesmen and also 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:57.530
 Leaders who tell me I have 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.209
 when I acquire new customers 

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:00.950
 I have a blockade there I have 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.900
 I am afraid of the no I am afraid 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.600
 have the word no yes yes no 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:07.730
 just another impulse needed just like you 

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.560
 easy for me so how can I do it 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.200
 easy for you to have mood for akquise 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.579
 or 23 cents 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.130
 the one point for me the most important 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.579
 and they do many in my world 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.230
 seller wrong cappuccino strategy 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.239
 The Capuchin strategy of hits quite 

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:25.250
 simple if you imagine that 

00:03:23.239 --> 00:03:27.380
 right now in the Café Fürst and 

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:30.010
 cappuccino drinker seller not 

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:30.010
 lunch break 

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:33.650
 what are you doing with your head so to speak 

00:03:32.689 --> 00:03:35.390
 how are you allowed a bit 

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.459
 to pay attention and just 

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:40.219
 look what is the picture you see 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:42.379
 and the interesting thing is we all plan 

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:43.849
 only the final result with something so simple 

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:46.129
 with cappuccino that means we see 

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.420
 just I have in my hand 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:48.859
 Typically, this is the picture 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.750
 greater than normal the button is 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:52.310
 huge i have already drank 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.819
 I really like this for this 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:56.540
 was 

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:58.159
 I'm already there in the end result 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.109
 sellers who are afraid 

00:03:58.159 --> 00:04:01.970
 where exactly this new or before the 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.989
 sales talk before that we know 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.120
 have new customers 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:06.769
 They are in the middle of the process 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.599
 in the middle of the drain the substances 

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.549
 film and see themselves fail 

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:13.010
 and therefore does not feel bad 

00:04:10.549 --> 00:04:15.139
 that's why cappuccino strategy i see 

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.669
 me that there is a customer maybe 

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:19.310
 not who is right now in front of me 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:21.620
 but I see that there is a customer 

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:23.599
 bought my product which comes to me 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.250
 and say thank you for helping me 

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.030
 have this production hope this 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.380
 service 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.810
 It was the best decision of mine 

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:32.449
 so if i'm the planner than life 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.729
 I find it much easier to sell 

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:36.440
 to start the conversation because I am 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:39.949
 know result and most 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:42.080
 sellers do not know the result very much 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:45.020
 very very horny and so if you are 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:46.849
 I'll tell seller's talent one more 

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.260
 want to continue to drive level if you 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:49.729
 wanted to have more fun in your life 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:51.470
 if someone is happy couple 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:53.630
 the two of them do other things as well 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:55.010
 together under company if you that 

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.360
 also want to experience times like you so right 

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:58.340
 live a happy partnership 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:00.320
 So can next to my and andreas yes 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:01.460

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.020
 would definitely look at the website 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.729
 I always like to recommend colleagues 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.580
 but only good colleagues and the two 

00:05:04.729 --> 00:05:09.800

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.389

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:16.550
 I am also worth the two 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.199

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:20.389

 but I work on their level 

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:25.960
 get 

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:29.320
 until the next month was the martin
