00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
the map that I played at eurogamer was

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.300

that<00:02:23.490> I<00:02:23.520> thought<00:02:23.790> when<00:02:24.000> I<00:02:24.030> saw<00:02:24.120> it<00:02:24.390> was<00:02:24.480> that<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
that I thought when I saw it was that it

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.230 
that I thought when I saw it was that it
looks<00:02:25.230> really<00:02:25.950> really<00:02:26.220> really<00:02:26.400> big<00:02:26.550> so<00:02:26.970> I<00:02:27.000> was

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:27.240 
looks really really really big so I was

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.810 
looks really really really big so I was
very<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.770> interested<00:02:28.770> and<00:02:28.890> intrigued<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
very very interested and intrigued as to

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:31.610 
very very interested and intrigued as to
how<00:02:30.300> it<00:02:30.420> was<00:02:30.480> gonna<00:02:30.690> play<00:02:30.780> out<00:02:30.990> because<00:02:31.440> with<00:02:31.590> a

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
how it was gonna play out because with a

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.430 
how it was gonna play out because with a
lot<00:02:31.860> of<00:02:32.010> games<00:02:32.250> especially<00:02:32.880> FPS<00:02:33.660> games<00:02:33.960> where

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
lot of games especially FPS games where

the<00:02:34.590> maps<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.980> really<00:02:35.310> big<00:02:35.550> the<00:02:35.850> action<00:02:36.300> tends

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:36.540 
the maps are really big the action tends

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.110 
the maps are really big the action tends
to<00:02:36.750> be<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.230> slow<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.100> this<00:02:38.310> was<00:02:38.550> not<00:02:39.060> the

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
to be really slow but this was not the

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.960 
to be really slow but this was not the
case<00:02:39.420> with<00:02:40.170> titanfall<00:02:40.590> even<00:02:41.250> with<00:02:41.400> the<00:02:41.520> option

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
case with titanfall even with the option

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
and I knew what I had to do in order to

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.360

to combat in titanfall it feels great

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.520 
to combat in titanfall it feels great
what<00:03:41.880> I<00:03:41.910> think<00:03:42.180> respawn<00:03:42.720> has<00:03:42.960> done<00:03:43.200> really

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
what I think respawn has done really

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.440 
what I think respawn has done really
really<00:03:43.650> really<00:03:44.010> well<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.580> they<00:03:45.000> have<00:03:45.180> found

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
really really well is they have found

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.200 
really really well is they have found
that<00:03:45.660> perfect<00:03:46.230> place<00:03:46.830> of<00:03:47.130> how<00:03:47.700> much<00:03:47.940> damage

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:48.210 
that perfect place of how much damage

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:50.300 
that perfect place of how much damage
you<00:03:48.480> have<00:03:48.660> to<00:03:48.840> take<00:03:49.050> before<00:03:49.260> you<00:03:49.500> die<00:03:49.920> there

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:50.310 
you have to take before you die there

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:52.460 
you have to take before you die there
was<00:03:50.460> no<00:03:50.610> time<00:03:50.640> where<00:03:51.420> I<00:03:51.450> just<00:03:51.600> got<00:03:51.960> shot<00:03:52.290> and

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
was no time where I just got shot and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.620 
was no time where I just got shot and
died<00:03:52.740> instantly<00:03:53.400> and<00:03:53.700> I<00:03:53.760> really<00:03:54.150> like<00:03:54.390> this

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:54.630 
died instantly and I really like this

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:56.450 
died instantly and I really like this
because<00:03:54.930> it<00:03:55.230> allows<00:03:55.470> more<00:03:55.800> experienced

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:56.460 
because it allows more experienced

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.540 
because it allows more experienced
players<00:03:56.730> to<00:03:57.330> use<00:03:57.360> tactics<00:03:58.200> and<00:03:58.500> techniques<00:03:58.800> to

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
players to use tactics and techniques to

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.400 
players to use tactics and techniques to
make<00:04:00.030> sure<00:04:00.180> that<00:04:00.390> they<00:04:00.510> don't<00:04:00.690> die<00:04:00.960> and<00:04:01.230> can

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
make sure that they don't die and can

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:03.380 
make sure that they don't die and can
turn<00:04:01.650> around<00:04:01.830> and<00:04:02.250> kill<00:04:02.550> the<00:04:02.700> other<00:04:02.880> person

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:03.390 
turn around and kill the other person

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:05.510 
turn around and kill the other person
there<00:04:03.660> was<00:04:03.750> one<00:04:03.960> situation<00:04:04.590> within<00:04:04.950> the<00:04:05.280> match

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
there was one situation within the match

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:07.010 
there was one situation within the match
that<00:04:05.730> i<00:04:05.790> was<00:04:06.030> playing<00:04:06.330> where<00:04:06.570> i<00:04:06.600> came<00:04:06.900> across

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:07.020 
that i was playing where i came across

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.190 
that i was playing where i came across
two<00:04:07.560> enemy<00:04:08.070> players<00:04:08.370> and<00:04:08.700> I<00:04:08.760> thought<00:04:08.970> hmm<00:04:09.480> what

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
two enemy players and I thought hmm what

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.260 
two enemy players and I thought hmm what
can<00:04:10.380> I<00:04:10.410> do<00:04:10.530> in<00:04:10.770> the<00:04:10.890> situation<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.790> come<00:04:12.090> out

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:12.270 
can I do in the situation to come out

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.170 
can I do in the situation to come out
victorious<00:04:12.500> so<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.530> started<00:04:14.100> frantically<00:04:14.670> halo

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
victorious so I started frantically halo

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.420 
victorious so I started frantically halo
jumping<00:04:15.750> and<00:04:15.960> I<00:04:16.260> managed<00:04:16.590> to<00:04:16.620> kill<00:04:16.980> them<00:04:17.160> both

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
jumping and I managed to kill them both

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:19.520 
jumping and I managed to kill them both
so<00:04:17.850> I<00:04:17.880> can<00:04:18.180> already<00:04:18.359> see<00:04:18.780> that<00:04:19.049> there<00:04:19.440> are

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
so I can already see that there are

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.140 
so I can already see that there are
going<00:04:19.560> to<00:04:19.739> be<00:04:19.799> certain<00:04:20.070> techniques<00:04:20.669> that<00:04:20.940> more

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
going to be certain techniques that more

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.240 
going to be certain techniques that more
experience<00:04:21.750> FPS<00:04:22.320> players<00:04:22.560> are<00:04:22.980> going

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
experience FPS players are going

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.790 
experience FPS players are going
use<00:04:23.520> in<00:04:23.850> order<00:04:24.330> to<00:04:24.570> reign<00:04:24.810> victorious<00:04:25.080> on<00:04:25.680> the

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
use in order to reign victorious on the

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.470 
use in order to reign victorious on the
enemy<00:04:25.950> team<00:04:26.160> now<00:04:26.640> when<00:04:26.850> it<00:04:26.940> comes<00:04:27.150> to<00:04:27.330> the

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:27.480 
enemy team now when it comes to the

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.900 
enemy team now when it comes to the
Titan<00:04:28.080> combat<00:04:28.680> you<00:04:28.890> guys<00:04:29.070> will<00:04:29.280> probably<00:04:29.460> be

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:29.910 
Titan combat you guys will probably be

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.880 
Titan combat you guys will probably be
thinking<00:04:30.120> and<00:04:30.540> it's<00:04:30.810> probably<00:04:31.200> clunky<00:04:31.860> or

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:31.890 
thinking and it's probably clunky or

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.040 
thinking and it's probably clunky or
slow<00:04:32.370> cuz<00:04:32.640> they're<00:04:32.790> big<00:04:33.060> macs<00:04:33.450> right<00:04:33.840> there

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:34.050 
slow cuz they're big macs right there

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.840 
slow cuz they're big macs right there
big<00:04:34.230> Titans<00:04:34.770> so<00:04:34.950> of<00:04:35.070> course<00:04:35.250> it's<00:04:35.490> gonna<00:04:35.640> be

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:35.850 
big Titans so of course it's gonna be

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:39.260 
big Titans so of course it's gonna be
slow<00:04:36.090> oh<00:04:36.330> you<00:04:36.870> are<00:04:37.650> very<00:04:38.160> very<00:04:38.460> wrong<00:04:38.850> the

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
slow oh you are very very wrong the

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:41.720 
slow oh you are very very wrong the
Titans<00:04:39.780> within<00:04:40.200> titanfall<00:04:40.680> are<00:04:41.130> extremely

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:41.730 
Titans within titanfall are extremely

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:44.720 
Titans within titanfall are extremely
agile<00:04:42.360> they<00:04:42.600> move<00:04:42.900> very<00:04:42.930> smoothly<00:04:43.830> whereas<00:04:44.580> in

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:44.730 
agile they move very smoothly whereas in

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.280 
agile they move very smoothly whereas in
other<00:04:44.910> games<00:04:45.210> that<00:04:45.480> I've<00:04:45.690> seen<00:04:45.930> where<00:04:46.170> they

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:46.290 
other games that I've seen where they

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:48.890 
other games that I've seen where they
use<00:04:46.470> Mac's<00:04:46.920> it<00:04:47.310> kind<00:04:48.150> of<00:04:48.210> slows<00:04:48.450> down<00:04:48.660> the<00:04:48.870> game

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:48.900 
use Mac's it kind of slows down the game

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:51.410 
use Mac's it kind of slows down the game
play<00:04:49.260> it<00:04:49.470> makes<00:04:49.710> it<00:04:49.860> feel<00:04:50.040> a<00:04:50.070> bit<00:04:50.460> clunky<00:04:50.820> the

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
play it makes it feel a bit clunky the

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.240 
play it makes it feel a bit clunky the
Titans<00:04:51.840> are<00:04:51.990> not<00:04:52.320> like<00:04:52.650> that<00:04:52.860> they<00:04:53.070> are

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:53.250 
Titans are not like that they are

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:55.970 
Titans are not like that they are
amazing<00:04:53.730> to<00:04:54.180> fight<00:04:54.420> in<00:04:54.600> also<00:04:55.350> something<00:04:55.680> which
