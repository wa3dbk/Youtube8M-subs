this<00:00:30.330> one<00:00:30.570> has<00:00:30.720> crossover<00:00:31.590> built<00:00:31.859> into<00:00:32.160> it

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
this one has crossover built into it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:36.110 
this one has crossover built into it
that<00:00:32.820> one<00:00:33.030> doesn't<00:00:33.829> this<00:00:34.829> one<00:00:35.010> is<00:00:35.160> made<00:00:35.430> 96

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
that one doesn't this one is made 96

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.080 
that one doesn't this one is made 96
that<00:00:36.570> one<00:00:36.750> is<00:00:36.870> made<00:00:37.079> in<00:00:37.250> 95<00:00:39.890> also<00:00:40.890> has<00:00:41.129> overload

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
that one is made in 95 also has overload

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:47.630 
that one is made in 95 also has overload
on<00:00:42.360> it<00:00:44.989> which<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.170> believe<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.620> like<00:00:46.649> a<00:00:46.829> clipping

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
on it which I believe is like a clipping

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.580 
on it which I believe is like a clipping
meter<00:00:48.440> or<00:00:49.440> like<00:00:49.980> a<00:00:50.010> signal<00:00:50.610> overload<00:00:54.350> you<00:00:55.350> can

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
meter or like a signal overload you can

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:58.430 
meter or like a signal overload you can
switch<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.610> inputs<00:00:57.020> it's<00:00:58.020> pretty<00:00:58.289> nice

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
switch the inputs it's pretty nice

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:10.090 
switch the inputs it's pretty nice
little<00:00:58.680> and<00:01:03.409> 500<00:01:04.409> rms<00:01:06.320> at<00:01:07.700> 1<00:01:08.700> ohm<00:01:08.880> bridged

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:10.100 
little and 500 rms at 1 ohm bridged

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.270 
little and 500 rms at 1 ohm bridged
yep<00:01:11.100> that's<00:01:11.460> right<00:01:11.700> one<00:01:12.000> old<00:01:12.180> bridge<00:01:12.570> it's

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
yep that's right one old bridge it's

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:18.130 
yep that's right one old bridge it's
made<00:01:14.280> to<00:01:14.460> do<00:01:14.640> that<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:16.040> it'll<00:01:17.040> go<00:01:17.189> down<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.369> I

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:18.140 
made to do that and it'll go down a I

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:25.100 
made to do that and it'll go down a I
believe<00:01:19.140> 1/4<00:01:19.650> on<00:01:20.450> stereo<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:23.270> it's<00:01:24.270> pretty

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
believe 1/4 on stereo so it's pretty

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.410 
believe 1/4 on stereo so it's pretty
nice<00:01:25.380> amp<00:01:25.680> they<00:01:26.340> don't<00:01:26.490> build<00:01:26.640> stuff<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.240> the

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
nice amp they don't build stuff like the

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.050 
nice amp they don't build stuff like the
same<00:01:27.630> or<00:01:27.900> same<00:01:28.530> thing<00:01:28.770> with<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.070> amp<00:01:29.340> quarter
