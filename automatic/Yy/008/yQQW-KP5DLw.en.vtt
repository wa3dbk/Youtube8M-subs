a little bit of Tommy tune and Ray

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:53.010 
a little bit of Tommy tune and Ray
Bolger<00:03:38.560> combined

his reverse walk wall-e right there I
was<00:04:14.770> just<00:04:14.830> thinking<00:04:15.310> you<00:04:15.400> probably<00:04:15.550> like<00:04:15.880> that

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
was just thinking you probably like that

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.300 
was just thinking you probably like that
wouldn't<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.329> did<00:04:16.480> yes<00:04:16.870> oh<00:04:17.139> but<00:04:18.010> look<00:04:18.130> what

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:18.310 
wouldn't you did yes oh but look what

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.009 
wouldn't you did yes oh but look what
happened<00:04:18.579> to<00:04:18.639> the<00:04:18.730> triple<00:04:19.090> lutz<00:04:19.269> what's

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
happened to the triple lutz what's

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.290 
happened to the triple lutz what's
happening<00:04:20.440> is<00:04:20.620> there's<00:04:20.829> a<00:04:21.070> lack<00:04:21.820> of<00:04:22.090> focus

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300 
happening is there's a lack of focus

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:41.610 
happening is there's a lack of focus
there's<00:04:22.780> a<00:04:22.870> lack<00:04:23.080> of<00:04:23.110> concentration

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:41.620 

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:43.200 

now<00:04:42.040> look<00:04:42.160> at<00:04:42.250> how<00:04:42.310> he<00:04:42.370> gets<00:04:42.669> the<00:04:42.850> audience

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
now look at how he gets the audience

00:04:43.210 --> 00:05:19.490 
now look at how he gets the audience
going<00:04:43.360> that's<00:04:43.660> that's<00:04:44.169> fun

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.130 

so<00:05:20.010> they<00:05:20.130> kept<00:05:20.400> his<00:05:20.580> energy<00:05:21.030> going<00:05:21.540> it<00:05:21.780> just

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:22.140 
so they kept his energy going it just

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:23.750 
so they kept his energy going it just
was<00:05:22.350> unfortunate<00:05:23.040> if<00:05:23.190> there<00:05:23.370> were<00:05:23.460> too<00:05:23.640> many

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
was unfortunate if there were too many

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.940 
was unfortunate if there were too many
elements<00:05:24.030> in<00:05:24.480> there<00:05:24.690> that<00:05:24.900> we're<00:05:25.830> not

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:25.950 
elements in there that we're not

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:29.300 
elements in there that we're not

completed on a pair of skates that are

it's<00:05:43.620> just<00:05:43.920> nice<00:05:44.310> to<00:05:44.550> see<00:05:44.730> the<00:05:44.880> improvement

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:47.000 
it's just nice to see the improvement

combination at the beginning of his

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:54.980 
combination at the beginning of his
program<00:05:51.180> started<00:05:51.690> very<00:05:51.900> nicely<00:05:53.840> it's<00:05:54.840> got<00:05:54.960> a

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:54.990 
program started very nicely it's got a

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:56.690 
program started very nicely it's got a
nice<00:05:55.260> high<00:05:55.560> free<00:05:55.920> leg<00:05:56.100> there's<00:05:56.310> no<00:05:56.520> way

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
nice high free leg there's no way

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.330 
nice high free leg there's no way
there's<00:05:56.910> two<00:05:57.090> foot<00:05:57.300> clean<00:05:58.290> clean<00:05:58.620> clean<00:05:58.650> he's

00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:01.080 
such a tall guy when it lands if it

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.730 
such a tall guy when it lands if it
looks<00:06:01.290> great

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:01.740 
looks great

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:03.200 
looks great
here's<00:06:02.340> that<00:06:02.460> skid<00:06:02.700> you<00:06:02.730> were<00:06:02.850> talking<00:06:03.120> about

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:03.210 
here's that skid you were talking about

00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:05.900 
here's that skid you were talking about
dick<00:06:03.510> really<00:06:04.020> was<00:06:04.170> why<00:06:04.380> this<00:06:04.440> jumping<00:06:05.340> from<00:06:05.520> so

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
dick really was why this jumping from so

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:07.940 
dick really was why this jumping from so
far<00:06:06.120> back<00:06:06.360> on<00:06:06.600> the<00:06:06.630> blade<00:06:06.930> a<00:06:07.320> bit<00:06:07.620> of<00:06:07.710> a<00:06:07.800> lean

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:07.950 
far back on the blade a bit of a lean

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:14.540 
far back on the blade a bit of a lean
you<00:06:08.130> can<00:06:08.160> see<00:06:11.540> but<00:06:12.540> he<00:06:12.660> did<00:06:13.070> needs<00:06:14.070> every<00:06:14.340> point

00:06:14.540 --> 00:06:14.550 
you can see but he did needs every point

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:15.800 
you can see but he did needs every point
because<00:06:14.790> later<00:06:15.000> on<00:06:15.120> the<00:06:15.210> program<00:06:15.480> I<00:06:15.510> kind<00:06:15.750> of

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810 
because later on the program I kind of

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.080 
because later on the program I kind of
fell<00:06:15.930> apart<00:06:16.169> there's<00:06:16.470> a<00:06:16.560> slow-motion<00:06:17.460> takeoff

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:18.090 
fell apart there's a slow-motion takeoff

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.370 
fell apart there's a slow-motion takeoff
look<00:06:18.570> at<00:06:18.690> the<00:06:18.810> triple<00:06:19.140> loop<00:06:19.290> a<00:06:21.050> jump<00:06:22.050> that<00:06:22.140> some

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:22.380 
look at the triple loop a jump that some

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.110 
look at the triple loop a jump that some
skaters<00:06:22.740> can<00:06:22.919> put<00:06:23.190> too<00:06:23.400> much<00:06:23.550> pressure<00:06:23.820> on<00:06:23.970> the

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
skaters can put too much pressure on the

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:26.600 
skaters can put too much pressure on the
blade<00:06:24.360> and<00:06:24.570> actually<00:06:25.110> lose<00:06:25.950> the<00:06:26.220> whole<00:06:26.400> edge

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:26.610 
blade and actually lose the whole edge

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:28.670 
blade and actually lose the whole edge
on<00:06:26.790> the<00:06:26.880> take-off<00:06:27.210> looks<00:06:28.140> like<00:06:28.320> he's<00:06:28.440> in<00:06:28.530> there

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:28.680 
on the take-off looks like he's in there

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:31.730 
on the take-off looks like he's in there
forever<00:06:29.010> a<00:06:29.100> little<00:06:29.460> bit<00:06:29.580> cheated<00:06:30.380> I'd<00:06:31.380> see<00:06:31.620> the

00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:31.740 
forever a little bit cheated I'd see the

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.180 
forever a little bit cheated I'd see the
focus<00:06:32.240> go<00:06:33.240> ahead<00:06:33.419> not<00:06:34.140> more<00:06:34.320> than<00:06:34.380> a<00:06:34.560> quarter

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:35.190 
focus go ahead not more than a quarter

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:37.150 
focus go ahead not more than a quarter
of<00:06:35.220> a<00:06:35.310> point<00:06:35.520> Dylan<00:06:35.880> that'll<00:06:36.390> be<00:06:36.479> better

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:37.160 
of a point Dylan that'll be better

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.110 
of a point Dylan that'll be better
yeah<00:06:38.160> if<00:06:38.250> you<00:06:38.340> cheat<00:06:38.550> it<00:06:38.640> too<00:06:38.729> much<00:06:38.880> they<00:06:39.000> don't

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:39.120 
yeah if you cheat it too much they don't

00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:40.670 
yeah if you cheat it too much they don't
even<00:06:39.300> counted<00:06:39.690> as<00:06:39.780> a<00:06:39.810> triple<00:06:40.110> there's<00:06:40.470> that

00:06:40.670 --> 00:06:40.680 
even counted as a triple there's that

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:43.250 
even counted as a triple there's that
second<00:06:41.040> triple<00:06:41.280> axel<00:06:41.550> and<00:06:41.610> I'm<00:06:42.419> just<00:06:42.720> I<00:06:43.229> just

00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:43.260 
second triple axel and I'm just I just

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:44.510 
second triple axel and I'm just I just
gotta<00:06:43.560> say<00:06:43.680> it's<00:06:43.800> a<00:06:43.830> good<00:06:43.979> thing<00:06:44.130> he<00:06:44.220> had<00:06:44.310> cert

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:44.520 
gotta say it's a good thing he had cert

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.640 
gotta say it's a good thing he had cert
pair<00:06:44.729> skates<00:06:45.060> he's<00:06:45.810> a<00:06:45.840> couple<00:06:46.169> those<00:06:46.290> landings

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:46.650 
pair skates he's a couple those landings

00:06:46.650 --> 00:06:48.040 
pair skates he's a couple those landings
so<00:06:46.710> they<00:06:46.919> just<00:06:47.040> shouldn't<00:06:47.280> happen

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:48.050 
so they just shouldn't happen
