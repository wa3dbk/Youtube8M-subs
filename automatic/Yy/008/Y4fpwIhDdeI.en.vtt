version of FIFA 13 you can tell us a
little<00:01:45.479> better<00:01:45.689> but<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.500> changes<00:01:46.890> are<00:01:46.950> pretty

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
little better but the changes are pretty

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.190 
little better but the changes are pretty
minor<00:01:47.399> another<00:01:48.180> thing<00:01:48.420> is<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.689> animation

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
minor another thing is the animation

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.200 
minor another thing is the animation
this<00:01:49.740> time<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.189> the<00:01:50.490> moves<00:01:50.700> are<00:01:50.880> rendered

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
this time all the moves are rendered

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
this time all the moves are rendered
better<00:01:51.420> and<00:01:51.689> more<00:01:51.899> realistic<00:01:52.259> the<00:01:52.890> physics

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
better and more realistic the physics

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.889 
better and more realistic the physics
are<00:01:53.430> improved<00:01:53.790> and<00:01:54.060> the<00:01:54.299> interaction<00:01:54.780> with

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
are improved and the interaction with

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.600 
are improved and the interaction with
the<00:01:54.990> ball<00:01:55.170> also<00:01:55.619> gets<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> a<00:01:56.009> new<00:01:56.159> level<00:01:56.340> in

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
the ball also gets to a new level in

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.459 
the ball also gets to a new level in
short<00:01:57.180> everything<00:01:57.570> here<00:01:57.869> is<00:01:57.990> noticeably

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
short everything here is noticeably

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.590 
short everything here is noticeably
better<00:01:58.710> by<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.549> way<00:01:59.759> they<00:02:00.030> told<00:02:00.090> me<00:02:00.360> that<00:02:00.509> the

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
better by the way they told me that the

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.690 
better by the way they told me that the
game<00:02:00.810> models<00:02:01.229> faces<00:02:01.649> don't<00:02:01.829> really<00:02:02.219> resemble

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:02.700 
game models faces don't really resemble

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:04.550 
game models faces don't really resemble
the<00:02:02.790> faces<00:02:03.149> of<00:02:03.180> their<00:02:03.360> originals<00:02:03.869> the<00:02:04.409> way

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
the faces of their originals the way

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:06.679 
the faces of their originals the way
that<00:02:04.740> fails<00:02:04.950> go<00:02:05.250> this<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.729> certainly<00:02:06.090> no<00:02:06.390> whale

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
that fails go this is certainly no whale

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.130 
that fails go this is certainly no whale
maybe<00:02:07.560> it's<00:02:07.979> a<00:02:08.190> failed<00:02:08.610> dolphin<00:02:09.179> yeah<00:02:09.810> that'll

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:10.140 
maybe it's a failed dolphin yeah that'll

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.309 
maybe it's a failed dolphin yeah that'll
work

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
the right though I'd have liked it

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.390 
the right though I'd have liked it
better<00:02:20.050> if<00:02:20.200> they<00:02:20.290> hadn't<00:02:20.620> done<00:02:20.650> it<00:02:20.860> since<00:02:21.250> it

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
better if they hadn't done it since it

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.130 
better if they hadn't done it since it
came<00:02:21.610> out<00:02:21.730> to<00:02:21.880> be<00:02:21.910> rather<00:02:22.240> confusing<00:02:23.020> and

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
came out to be rather confusing and

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.050 
came out to be rather confusing and
uncomfortable<00:02:23.830> in<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:24.040> long<00:02:24.220> run<00:02:24.430> our

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
uncomfortable in the long run our

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.520 
uncomfortable in the long run our
training<00:02:25.540> matches<00:02:25.870> for<00:02:26.050> the<00:02:26.140> thing<00:02:26.320> though

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
training matches for the thing though

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.620 
training matches for the thing though
but<00:02:26.830> it<00:02:26.950> was<00:02:27.040> difficult<00:02:27.340> to<00:02:27.640> play<00:02:27.880> those<00:02:28.150> even

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630 
but it was difficult to play those even

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.320 
but it was difficult to play those even
so<00:02:29.110> in<00:02:29.230> my<00:02:29.410> mind<00:02:29.490> novelty<00:02:30.490> edition<00:02:30.970> ended<00:02:31.210> up

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:31.330 
so in my mind novelty edition ended up

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:34.200 
so in my mind novelty edition ended up
woefully<00:02:32.170> unfinished<00:02:32.770> ok<00:02:33.580> let's<00:02:33.850> go<00:02:34.030> to<00:02:34.090> the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
woefully unfinished ok let's go to the

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:36.660 
woefully unfinished ok let's go to the
results<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:35.170> -<00:02:35.530> is<00:02:35.710> that<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.040> game<00:02:36.250> will<00:02:36.400> lug

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
results the - is that the game will lug

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:39.030 
results the - is that the game will lug
a<00:02:36.700> little<00:02:37.090> on<00:02:37.210> old<00:02:37.480> devices<00:02:38.080> but<00:02:38.500> that's<00:02:38.770> sure

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:39.040 
a little on old devices but that's sure

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.790 
a little on old devices but that's sure
to<00:02:39.070> be<00:02:39.250> expected<00:02:39.820> they<00:02:40.030> are<00:02:40.150> old<00:02:40.360> after<00:02:40.630> all

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:40.800 
to be expected they are old after all

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:43.380 
to be expected they are old after all
besides<00:02:41.800> that<00:02:42.100> I<00:02:42.280> was<00:02:42.520> upset<00:02:42.880> about<00:02:42.910> having<00:02:43.210> to

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:43.390 
besides that I was upset about having to

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:45.060 
besides that I was upset about having to
pay<00:02:43.600> to<00:02:43.660> unlock<00:02:43.840> certain<00:02:44.410> modes<00:02:44.620> of<00:02:44.800> the<00:02:44.890> game

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:45.070 
pay to unlock certain modes of the game

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:46.830 
pay to unlock certain modes of the game
they<00:02:45.580> could<00:02:45.760> have<00:02:45.850> simply<00:02:46.150> made<00:02:46.480> you<00:02:46.660> pay<00:02:46.810> a

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
they could have simply made you pay a

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.810 
they could have simply made you pay a
reasonable<00:02:47.470> price<00:02:47.650> for<00:02:47.710> the<00:02:47.980> whole<00:02:48.130> game<00:02:48.370> but

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:48.820 
reasonable price for the whole game but

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:52.200
