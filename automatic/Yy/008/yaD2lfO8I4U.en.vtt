00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:06.450
 and many of you ask me 

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:08.910
 often what do I do to maintain 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.800
 healthy hair in long hair and dyed 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.900
 requires a lot of care because if you do not 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.480
 turns into a brittle, brittle hair 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.660
 dry rough with split ends and without 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.580
 life a few days ago I colored it and 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.430
 that's exactly how I've been 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.019
 after such aggressive treatment 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.369
 although I also used to follow these 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.070
 steps every two months approximately 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:31.560
 to keep hair beautiful and hydrated 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.120
 without losing the length of the hair 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.010
 products and oils help us 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.290
 prevent split ends but do not 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.420
 they end up with them once they're there by 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.430
 that is necessary to cut them to clean 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:44.040
 moisturize that hair before it is followed 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.600
 opening and ruining so as not to lose 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.950
 long and cut only just and necessary 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.230
 we will do a following 

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.570
 let's divide the hair into sections and 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.430
 host small tufts we roll up the 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.620
 bottom part of the lock on itself 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:58.990
 a few times and we'll make a kind 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.060
 of or joining the tip with a part of the 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:03.190
 same strand the remaining hairs 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:05.890
 loose are the split ends and that's 

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:08.200
 what we have to cut we will repeat the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.760
 short hair procedure we roll up 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.370
 the part under a lock on itself 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.710
 same we will make one and cut the hairs 

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.660
 that stand out once we've finished 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.610
 with the tips open we will hydrate 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:20.380
 all the hair intensively to 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.020
 they will make a mask based on 

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:25.150
 egg coconut olive oil arcana the one 

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.670
 we prefer or have at home in 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.380
 our usual mask the egg is 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.180
 rich in protein that makes you 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.729
 Bring back hair to life 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:35.050
 very much shine and softness the oil of 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.119
 Olive will help us give you a 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.220
 extra intensive hair hydration 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:41.259
 our usual mask will give 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.640
 consistency to the mix and it will increase 

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:44.550
 all the benefits that we are 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.860
 contributing to our hair 

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:48.990
 we will make the mixture by throwing each product 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.490
 in equal parts the amount depends on 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.830
 how long we have the hair 

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.140
 we will get a little consistency 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.580
 gelatinous due to the egg and we will have 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.680
 than applying it from means to ends 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.460
 avoiding the root so that it does not phrase 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.950
 with the oil 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:04.110
 once applied we can put a 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.970
 thermal cap or film on all the 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.700
 head so that the hair takes temperature 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.500
 and enhance the effect of the mask and 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:12.540
 besides we will not march anything since I 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.430
 I advise to let her act all 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:16.790
 as long as we can and even all the 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:16.790
 night 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.040
 when we have let act the 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.230
 mask we will wash the hair so 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.630
 usual and then polish a bit the 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:27.220
 way of it because sometimes when 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.500
 we cut the ends in which we do 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.970
 tufts a little longer and finite and 

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:34.090
 they give it a careless look and 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.800
 scruffy at the foot to do it I'm going to 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:38.140
 combing my hair and I'm going to make a 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.209
 pigtail lower pigtail I do it in this 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.099
 position because I wear a straight cut 

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.630
 but if you have a cut in layers you would have 

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:44.800
 that make the queue in the high part 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.330
 of the head 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.370
 just make me a good line 

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:50.290
 tight and then I put another player more 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.760
 down to help me grab everything 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.010
 the hair well since it would go down the 

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.960
 pigtail until you reach the tips that 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.150
 cut straight 

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.620
 just repeat this procedure several 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:01.840
 times until the cut is 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.670
 totally straight and just short what 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.610
 essential that is usually more or less 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.380
 a finger to finish we will remove the hair 

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.850
 I do not routinely me I have 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.170
 wanted to arrange for you to see a 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:14.150
 100% real result 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.010
 the truth is that it's amazing how soft 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.750
 that there is the brightness that it has and what 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.480
 more important is that it is hydrated and 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.940
 there are no split ends and the length is not 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.750
 has lost I hope you liked the 

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:25.489
 video 

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:29.170
 Of course I have served you and we 

00:03:25.489 --> 00:03:29.170
 we see in the next a little kiss
