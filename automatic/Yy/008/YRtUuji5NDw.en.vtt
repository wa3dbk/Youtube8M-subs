ever an earthquake where would I hide

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.729 
ever an earthquake where would I hide
that<00:02:56.120> is<00:02:56.239> a<00:02:56.269> really<00:02:56.510> good<00:02:56.660> question<00:02:56.840> because<00:02:57.170> I

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
that is a really good question because I

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.710 
that is a really good question because I
was<00:02:57.920> never<00:02:58.070> taught<00:02:58.340> like<00:02:58.700> earthquake<00:02:59.209> hazard

00:02:59.710 --> 00:02:59.720

was never taught like earthquake hazard
safety<00:03:00.200> stuff<00:03:00.860> so<00:03:01.519> I<00:03:02.180> honestly<00:03:02.660> have<00:03:02.959> no<00:03:02.989> idea

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:03.260 
safety stuff so I honestly have no idea

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:06.820 
safety stuff so I honestly have no idea
what<00:03:04.070> I<00:03:04.100> would<00:03:04.190> do<00:03:04.400> I<00:03:04.430> would<00:03:04.640> probably<00:03:04.959> go<00:03:05.959> if<00:03:06.680> I

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:06.830 
what I would do I would probably go if I

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:08.560

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:40.519

characters I think great when you get
there<00:03:40.670> you<00:03:40.970> get<00:03:41.180> like<00:03:41.390> a<00:03:41.420> character

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:41.870 
there you get like a character

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.319 
there you get like a character
information<00:03:42.350> list<00:03:42.829> and<00:03:43.030> mostly<00:03:44.030> it's<00:03:44.209> like

00:03:44.319 --> 00:03:44.329 
information list and mostly it's like

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.660 
information list and mostly it's like
medieval<00:03:44.900> and<00:03:45.200> like<00:03:45.470> there's<00:03:46.010> a<00:03:46.070> theme<00:03:46.400> to<00:03:46.640> it

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:46.670 
medieval and like there's a theme to it

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:49.210 
medieval and like there's a theme to it
so<00:03:47.390> you<00:03:48.170> could<00:03:48.350> get<00:03:48.500> like<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.650> character<00:03:49.010> that's

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220

end<00:04:20.650> in<00:04:21.190> a<00:04:21.340> divorce<00:04:21.730> which<00:04:22.090> is<00:04:22.240> kind<00:04:22.450> of<00:04:22.510> sad

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:22.720 
end in a divorce which is kind of sad

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:25.650 
end in a divorce which is kind of sad
but<00:04:22.990> it's<00:04:23.320> the<00:04:23.470> truth<00:04:23.850> I<00:04:24.850> think<00:04:25.300> it's<00:04:25.420> because

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:25.660 
but it's the truth I think it's because

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:28.770 
but it's the truth I think it's because
people<00:04:25.690> like<00:04:26.520> rush<00:04:27.520> into<00:04:27.880> marriage<00:04:28.180> so<00:04:28.510> fast

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
people like rush into marriage so fast

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.040 
people like rush into marriage so fast
when<00:04:29.020> they're<00:04:29.140> young<00:04:29.320> and<00:04:29.650> people<00:04:30.130> are<00:04:30.610> like

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.050 
when they're young and people are like

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.240 
when they're young and people are like
constantly<00:04:32.050> changing<00:04:32.560> and<00:04:32.680> growing<00:04:32.860> and

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:33.250 
constantly changing and growing and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.950 
constantly changing and growing and
stuff<00:04:33.460> so<00:04:33.670> like<00:04:33.880> people<00:04:34.690> who<00:04:34.780> get<00:04:34.900> married

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:34.960 
stuff so like people who get married

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.540 
stuff so like people who get married
when<00:04:35.380> they're<00:04:35.500> like<00:04:35.650> in<00:04:35.800> their<00:04:35.890> early<00:04:36.160> 20s

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
when they're like in their early 20s

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:37.650 
when they're like in their early 20s
it's<00:04:36.790> just<00:04:36.970> like<00:04:37.090> you're<00:04:37.300> a<00:04:37.330> different<00:04:37.480> person

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
it's just like you're a different person

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.650 
it's just like you're a different person
when<00:04:37.990> you're<00:04:38.290> like<00:04:38.530> five<00:04:39.430> years<00:04:39.460> later<00:04:39.790> so<00:04:40.360> I

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:40.660 
when you're like five years later so I

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.320 
when you're like five years later so I
think<00:04:40.990> that's<00:04:41.590> a<00:04:41.890> cause<00:04:42.100> of<00:04:42.460> divorces<00:04:43.180> and

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:43.330 
think that's a cause of divorces and

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:46.140 
think that's a cause of divorces and
stuff<00:04:43.600> and<00:04:44.430> personally<00:04:45.430> for<00:04:45.580> me<00:04:45.730> my<00:04:45.880> parents
