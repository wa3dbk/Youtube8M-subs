00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:32.270 
the AG website is to seal sold out and

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:35.440 
the AG website is to seal sold out and
it<00:03:32.840> was<00:03:32.870> absolutely<00:03:33.680> terrifying<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:35.150> the

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
it was absolutely terrifying and the

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.450 
it was absolutely terrifying and the
reason<00:03:35.750> it<00:03:35.810> was<00:03:35.930> terrifying<00:03:36.380> was<00:03:37.100> because

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:37.460 
reason it was terrifying was because

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:41.530 
reason it was terrifying was because

a few moments ago I was lucky in the

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.690 
a few moments ago I was lucky in the
sense<00:04:17.180> that<00:04:17.540> no<00:04:17.919> no<00:04:18.919> one<00:04:19.070> who<00:04:19.160> is<00:04:19.280> selling<00:04:19.609> her

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
sense that no no one who is selling her

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:21.460 
sense that no no one who is selling her
on<00:04:19.820> ebay<00:04:20.120> had<00:04:20.299> increased<00:04:20.750> her<00:04:20.930> price<00:04:21.169> yet

on ebay had increased her price yet

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.590 
on ebay had increased her price yet

purchased cecile for me and i was really
happy<00:04:57.560> and<00:04:58.360> I<00:04:59.360> believe<00:05:00.040> two<00:05:01.040> days<00:05:01.700> later<00:05:02.060> I

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:02.450 
happy and I believe two days later I

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:04.600 
happy and I believe two days later I
started<00:05:02.780> thinking<00:05:03.260> you<00:05:03.500> know<00:05:04.010> that<00:05:04.310> Stella

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:04.610 
started thinking you know that Stella

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:07.390 
started thinking you know that Stella
had<00:05:04.790> IV<00:05:05.180> as<00:05:05.270> well<00:05:05.479> and<00:05:05.900> it<00:05:06.890> would<00:05:07.100> be<00:05:07.130> cheaper

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
had IV as well and it would be cheaper

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:09.100 
had IV as well and it would be cheaper
than<00:05:07.580> American<00:05:08.120> Girl<00:05:08.270> and<00:05:08.510> it<00:05:08.780> would<00:05:08.900> get<00:05:09.080> her

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
than American Girl and it would get her

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.240 
than American Girl and it would get her
quicker<00:05:09.560> than<00:05:09.650> American

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.250 
quicker than American

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.860 
quicker than American
because<00:05:11.250> I've<00:05:11.550> Ian<00:05:11.760> Cecile<00:05:12.090> had<00:05:12.330> both<00:05:12.570> been
