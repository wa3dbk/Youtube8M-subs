00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.890

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.809

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:43.770
 absolute color trend at least in the 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.539
 fashion and it is nice then me too 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:48.239
 I'm also the topic today 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:49.770
 dressed accordingly if you what 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:51.120
 in fashion then comes before also in the 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.820
 make up can find again 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.160
 I use the eyeshadow first 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.500
 applicator and look for a bright 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.570
 color out of the color palette so that me 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.040
 a nice fresh bright primer 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:07.230
 I'm on it then 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:08.580
 I can carry on working too 

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.950
 something of the eyeshadow under the 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:16.590
 eyebrow on as you will see that 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:18.330
 eye thereby optically enlarged now 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.520
 I want to give the eye more depth and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:24.120
 For that I use the shading 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.040
 brush and look for a nice color 

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:30.900
 which is a bit darker and then 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 pressed the brush into the lid fold and 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.850
 could it with the brush so right 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:38.070
 beautiful, by the way, apply the beautiful 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:41.009
 this brushing is that it is about 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.420
 synthetic hair is what I am talking about 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:46.369
 Animal lover, of course, I'm glad that there 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:48.960
 no animal perches on the island top and 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.130
 if he is allergic to that 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.630
 Of course , nice because if you are 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.640
 has beautifully made up and then the eye 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.619
 you can swell or turn 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.770
 that make-up also right now 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:00.300
 I use the brushstroke brush and for 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.420
 I'm looking for one more 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:06.060
 darker shade from this palette 

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.990
 and I think I 'll catch that 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.209
 here in the middle 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.700
 that way the eye gets a little bit more 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.750
 structure and also at the bottom 

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:19.650
 eyelash wreath I would now again 

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:22.230
 something to draw your eyes 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.180
 still nice to the validity comes around 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.769
 glued eyelashes after showering 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.769
 to separate mascara 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:30.900
 I use those eyelashes and now 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:32.190
 brush eyebrows that I know 

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.380
 All determines and that is really 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.150
 very handy so you can order 

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:42.489
 school fly legs 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.290
 just eliminate here you see two 

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:46.480
 different gloss colors 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.510
 thus that it is now going on, I will 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.090
 use the darker ones and wear them 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:55.890
 color now with the so-called 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:55.890
 cat tongues on 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.069
 last come to call to attention and 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.560
 you can make your face narrower 

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:06.330
 want to do here under the 

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.019
 begin cheekbones and then you 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.000
 work forwards and backwards and 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.069
 I have already so a narrow 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.290
 face and just wants a bit 

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.480
 look fresher and there you can 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.970
 then apple cheek if it is so 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.830
 would like to call 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:24.690
 Make-up here absorbs some color and 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:27.599
 that is a bit silly of me , unfortunately 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.299
 I'll grin a little bit now 

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.840
 then simply make-up this this 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:35.190
 Basin stands for something a bit more color 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.690
 I'm glad to get in the face 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.930

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:38.930
