I<00:01:07.310> haven't<00:01:08.310> made<00:01:08.490> it<00:01:08.549> very<00:01:09.030> far<00:01:09.390> here<00:01:10.170> I've

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
I haven't made it very far here I've

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.219 
I haven't made it very far here I've
completed<00:01:11.159> two<00:01:11.549> missions<00:01:13.280> the<00:01:14.280> doll<00:01:15.229> finding

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
completed two missions the doll finding

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.820 
completed two missions the doll finding
that<00:01:16.320> little<00:01:16.590> girls<00:01:16.830> doll<00:01:17.009> which<00:01:17.430> was<00:01:17.729> just

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
that little girls doll which was just

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.219 
that little girls doll which was just
way<00:01:19.830> too<00:01:20.210> difficult<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.540> think<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.810> took<00:01:21.930> me<00:01:22.049> two

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
way too difficult I think it took me two

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.810 
way too difficult I think it took me two
hours<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.590> do<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.220> I<00:01:23.280> guess<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.520> wasn't<00:01:23.670> even

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
hours to do and I guess it wasn't even

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.999 
hours to do and I guess it wasn't even
that<00:01:23.909> difficult<00:01:24.420> but<00:01:24.600> just<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.530> fact<00:01:25.710> of<00:01:25.890> how

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
that difficult but just the fact of how

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:30.410 
that difficult but just the fact of how
hidden<00:01:26.369> it<00:01:26.490> was<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:29.040> took<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.250> really<00:01:29.729> long<00:01:29.909> time

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:30.420 
hidden it was it took a really long time

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.719 
hidden it was it took a really long time
to<00:01:30.450> find<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:30.960> I<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.170> still<00:01:31.650> all<00:01:31.950> level<00:01:32.460> one

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
to find and I was still all level one

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.590 
to find and I was still all level one
for<00:01:33.119> everything<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:34.799> hadn't<00:01:35.759> had<00:01:35.909> a<00:01:35.939> chance<00:01:36.270> to

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
for everything I hadn't had a chance to

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:45.920 
for everything I hadn't had a chance to
upgrade<00:01:36.750> oh<00:01:37.549> crap<00:01:42.560> and<00:01:44.360> so<00:01:45.360> that<00:01:45.540> made<00:01:45.659> it<00:01:45.689> kind

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
upgrade oh crap and so that made it kind

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.350 
upgrade oh crap and so that made it kind
of<00:01:46.020> hard<00:01:46.200> and<00:01:46.579> then<00:01:47.579> I<00:01:47.670> was<00:01:47.759> in<00:01:47.939> critical

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
of hard and then I was in critical

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.389 
of hard and then I was in critical
condition<00:01:48.840> and<00:01:49.049> then<00:01:49.649> it<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:49.829> for<00:01:50.310> the

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
condition and then it was for the

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.550 
condition and then it was for the
furthest<00:01:50.790> possible<00:01:51.780> place<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.350> could<00:01:52.439> have

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
furthest possible place it could have

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:58.170 
furthest possible place it could have
been<00:01:54.740> where<00:01:55.740> are<00:01:55.799> you<00:01:55.860> guys<00:01:55.979> going<00:01:56.430> okay

one<00:05:54.240> of<00:05:54.360> the<00:05:54.450> last<00:05:54.630> pistols<00:05:55.140> that<00:05:55.200> I<00:05:55.320> had<00:05:55.940> was

00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:56.940 
one of the last pistols that I had was

00:05:56.940 --> 00:06:02.750 
one of the last pistols that I had was
the<00:05:58.790> boat<00:05:59.790> pistol<00:06:00.150> what's<00:06:00.270> up<00:06:01.370> carrying<00:06:02.370> HP

the boat pistol what's up carrying HP
and<00:06:03.000> I<00:06:03.060> might<00:06:03.240> have<00:06:03.360> just<00:06:03.510> got<00:06:03.630> hit<00:06:03.810> I<00:06:03.840> looked

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:04.110 
and I might have just got hit I looked

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:06.290 
and I might have just got hit I looked
away<00:06:04.230> to<00:06:04.380> ask<00:06:04.650> the<00:06:04.980> guy<00:06:05.070> question<00:06:05.580> and<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:05.910> think

00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:06.300 
away to ask the guy question and I think

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:09.380 
away to ask the guy question and I think
I<00:06:06.540> got<00:06:06.780> hit<00:06:07.040> but<00:06:08.040> I<00:06:08.070> had<00:06:08.250> the<00:06:08.340> garyun<00:06:08.640> HP<00:06:09.000> and<00:06:09.330> I

00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:09.390 
I got hit but I had the garyun HP and I

00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:10.580 
I got hit but I had the garyun HP and I
thought<00:06:09.720> I<00:06:09.780> was<00:06:09.990> doing<00:06:10.170> a<00:06:10.260> good<00:06:10.350> thing<00:06:10.410> by

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:10.590 
thought I was doing a good thing by

00:06:10.590 --> 00:06:12.500 
thought I was doing a good thing by
buying<00:06:11.010> a<00:06:11.100> master<00:06:11.550> crafted<00:06:11.940> one<00:06:12.090> and<00:06:12.300> paying

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:12.510 
buying a master crafted one and paying

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:14.990 
buying a master crafted one and paying
1,500<00:06:13.320> for<00:06:13.560> it<00:06:13.590> but<00:06:14.160> apparently<00:06:14.490> that's<00:06:14.700> like

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
1,500 for it but apparently that's like

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.330 
1,500 for it but apparently that's like
super<00:06:15.960> noob<00:06:16.500> thing<00:06:16.860> to<00:06:16.980> do<00:06:17.100> and<00:06:17.430> just<00:06:19.040> and<00:06:20.040> it

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:20.340 
super noob thing to do and just and it

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:22.430 
super noob thing to do and just and it
wasn't<00:06:20.640> a<00:06:20.790> good<00:06:21.120> master<00:06:21.570> crafted<00:06:21.990> but<00:06:22.230> to<00:06:22.350> me

00:06:22.430 --> 00:06:22.440 
wasn't a good master crafted but to me

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.740 
wasn't a good master crafted but to me
it<00:06:22.560> was<00:06:22.740> because<00:06:23.130> I<00:06:23.340> don't<00:06:23.940> have<00:06:24.090> very<00:06:24.240> many

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
it was because I don't have very many

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.900 
it was because I don't have very many
points<00:06:25.410> so<00:06:26.190> I<00:06:26.220> thought<00:06:26.400> it<00:06:26.460> was<00:06:26.550> a<00:06:26.580> awesome

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:26.910 
points so I thought it was a awesome

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:29.900 
points so I thought it was a awesome
deal<00:06:27.980> so<00:06:28.980> I<00:06:29.040> bought<00:06:29.400> it

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:29.910 
deal so I bought it

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:32.840 
deal so I bought it
of<00:06:30.030> course<00:06:30.330> and<00:06:30.630> then<00:06:30.810> um<00:06:31.490> just<00:06:32.490> found<00:06:32.669> out

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:32.850 
of course and then um just found out

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:34.580 
of course and then um just found out
