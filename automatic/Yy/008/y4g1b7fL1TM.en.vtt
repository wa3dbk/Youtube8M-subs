teeth and more poisonous venom

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.170 
teeth and more poisonous venom
she<00:00:55.949> needs<00:00:56.100> really<00:00:56.250> skip<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> one<00:00:56.760> thing<00:00:57.030> that

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
she needs really skip the one thing that

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.000 
she needs really skip the one thing that
would<00:00:57.270> give<00:00:57.390> any<00:00:57.660> would<00:00:57.989> make<00:00:58.199> any<00:00:58.500> animal

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:28.750 
that actually would be worth the money

that actually would be worth the money
and<00:02:28.870> I've<00:02:29.050> come<00:02:29.170> up<00:02:29.260> with<00:02:29.350> an<00:02:29.440> idea<00:02:29.470> for<00:02:29.800> this

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and I've come up with an idea for this

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.890 
and I've come up with an idea for this
you<00:02:30.100> got<00:02:30.250> your<00:02:30.400> treadmill<00:02:30.790> you're<00:02:31.360> on<00:02:31.570> it<00:02:31.720> and

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:31.900 
you got your treadmill you're on it and

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:33.920 
you got your treadmill you're on it and
behind<00:02:32.230> you<00:02:32.350> is<00:02:32.380> an<00:02:32.560> 80<00:02:32.800> inch<00:02:33.040> screen<00:02:33.459> which

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
behind you is an 80 inch screen which

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.090 
behind you is an 80 inch screen which
corresponding<00:02:34.930> to<00:02:35.050> the<00:02:35.140> intensity<00:02:35.620> level<00:02:35.980> you

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:36.100 
corresponding to the intensity level you

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.770 
corresponding to the intensity level you
select<00:02:36.280> would<00:02:36.670> display<00:02:36.970> videos<00:02:37.390> or<00:02:37.600> things

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
select would display videos or things

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.600 
select would display videos or things
you<00:02:37.959> would<00:02:38.110> have<00:02:38.140> naturally<00:02:39.010> want<00:02:39.280> to<00:02:39.370> run

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
you would have naturally want to run

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.460 
you would have naturally want to run
away<00:02:39.820> from<00:02:42.239> and<00:02:43.239> so<00:02:43.540> for<00:02:43.930> instance<00:02:43.959> have<00:02:44.320> you

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:44.470 
away from and so for instance have you

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.490 
away from and so for instance have you
heard<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.739> hit<00:02:44.830> the<00:02:44.980> mile<00:02:45.220> button<00:02:45.760> I<00:02:45.850> think

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500 
heard it hit the mile button I think

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.080 
heard it hit the mile button I think
exploding<00:02:47.500> image<00:02:47.890> of<00:02:48.100> the<00:02:48.220> desktop<00:02:48.640> from<00:02:48.820> Star

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:49.090 
exploding image of the desktop from Star

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:50.280 
exploding image of the desktop from Star
Wars<00:02:49.120> would<00:02:49.360> appear<00:02:49.630> from<00:02:49.750> behind<00:02:49.810> you<00:02:50.170> I<00:02:50.200> mean

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
Wars would appear from behind you I mean

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:51.720 
Wars would appear from behind you I mean
that's<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.680> some<00:02:51.070> motivation<00:02:51.640> right

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that's you know some motivation right

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.610

there<00:02:51.790> but<00:02:52.090> the<00:02:52.690> medium<00:02:53.050> level<00:02:53.200> I<00:02:53.350> think<00:02:53.440> would

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
there but the medium level I think would

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.900 
there but the medium level I think would
be<00:02:53.709> the<00:02:53.860> boulder<00:02:54.160> scene<00:02:54.370> from<00:02:54.489> Indiana<00:02:54.820> Jones
