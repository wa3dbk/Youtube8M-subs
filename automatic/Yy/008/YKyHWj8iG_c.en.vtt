00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.860
 and welcomes everyone knows match 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:18.340
 of Europe today we find ourselves for 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.520
 a new video for a special issue of 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.300
 the series the mysteries of dofus 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.949
 so I do not know if you remember 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.899
 but when I talked about the theme of 

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:27.660
 epic monsters 

00:00:24.899 --> 00:00:30.550
 I had touched on the subject of the nova mummy 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.020
 when I said that it was precisely 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:36.850
 a legendary monster that nobody 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:39.460
 had not found and there down in in the 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:41.499
 treasure trove to learn about 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.480
 the wharves of the purple dofus and the 

00:00:41.499 --> 00:00:45.429
 novelties that had so I 'll never 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.749
 click on the mouse at the desk for 

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:49.899
 see the tablet towers 

00:00:46.749 --> 00:00:53.109
 Toutankhamon with his random pieces 

00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:55.239
 in treasure hunt the boring stuff 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.949
 I think in addition to random to be 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.229
 good fun and beaches had seen 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.769
 look for a legendary treasure and jallet 

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:01.690
 click on it 

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:03.399
 so I pass and I pass I look 

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.050
 treasure of Tutankhamun and then I have 

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.200
 not even and then actually I see that 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.820
 mobinnova is written so frankly there 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.430
 I was really surprised since since 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.060
 the seven years that I play the game will be 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.930
 treaties remain and legends 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:18.730
 no one had ever seen 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.230
 found and the n goes and comes to be 

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:21.760
 implanted in the bestiary which I think 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:27.300
 which will also serve in which the dofus 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:30.220
 for really it's weird at the sorry 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:32.740
 but no, I say it was really that 

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:37.000
 was really weird to see that in 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.680
 plant is just more just a few 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.760
 days after my monster episode 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:43.330
 legendary and epic 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.860
 so here I am really happy 

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.940
 that I hoped I was really hoping 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.680
 not see it and let alone in this 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.960
 update 

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:54.050
 in fact when you think about it sticks 

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:57.950
 really good at the late theme of putting 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.440
 of the purple dofus frightening him 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.640
 for the purposes all acquired our sides that kind 

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.990
 aside that's giving a halak is 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:08.360
 so here it was a little video 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.970
 fast to show you my 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.370
 currently I hope that despite his 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.270
 short time it will have pleased you and then 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.270
 I tell you next time
