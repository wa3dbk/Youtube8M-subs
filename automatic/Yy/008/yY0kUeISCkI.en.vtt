00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:15.680

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:20.659
 We now times would always have fun and 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:22.789
 until then soy sauce out of this, then 

00:00:20.659 --> 00:00:26.239
 currently not at all 

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:28.119
 Camera still on me and pretty nice stupid 

00:00:26.239 --> 00:00:32.870
 Well, I'll show you the whole thing now 

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:34.400
 and that we have now this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:36.310
 year we have this here now 

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.170
 So I want it again 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.130
 Weil gopro and thus the microphone ara 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:43.000
 there is no purpose 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:46.790
 well there is just this part where the 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.920
 Often times then body turn and that 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.420
 Here I have the thing I have to first 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.940
 so just improvise this 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:54.590
 thing where I'm just showing it 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:56.570
 rusty that was originally there and then 

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.760
 I welded this to it 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.560
 upper and this part also here 

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:04.339
 turn on because I always need a mid and a 

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.260
 right or left island missile me 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:07.730
 Just have one of them and here 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.530
 there are the holes I have 

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:12.110
 These thick steel sheets are welded 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.120
 the here on this may the ak 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.280
 I screwed with the rail 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.140
 So this with these one bolt here 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.140
 So things actually hold so 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.909
 pretty much what else do I have 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.920
 a hole through aqas him sometime 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:31.220
 by getting a nice feeling and 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:33.560
 this here on the left , that's it 

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.330
 the holders are the voices, so to speak 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.500
 heuvel flight with the pole where I then 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:42.799
 my left thumb then vote the 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.180
 against against that this thing here so 

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:47.000
 where i just went with my 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:52.210
 index finger was back there that stands 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.280
 welder and then I want to see 

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:58.840
 what comes out wishing you a lot 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.840
 fun and 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.770
 as the 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:25.550
 it's actually the best one 

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:32.540
 some are covered decently the 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:35.510
 dry stress button on soy here 

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:36.580
 Let's try it all out then 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.850
 see that 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.730
 we are seeing that here very well 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:45.580
 So some left who likes to center here 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.260
 in the front I'm okay but the 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:47.590
 left is not really in the ground 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.410
 purely 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:52.330
 just because of which one lay one sees also 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.060
 that seen from the left so from me 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:56.980
 The left shoe is the top of the bar 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:01.420
 I already weighed the crooked ones 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:04.840
 because now left to tell because of the 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:07.060
 Soil in one place 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:10.360
 there is the intention of this thing 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.810
 really crooked bent already amazing 

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.970
 was his 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.340
 there hangs yes and then I thought so 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.080
 you can still do it I have one 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.880
 a little higher you can see 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:23.860
 Now up here it scores well on the 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:25.930
 stems then in red dots brother 88 

00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:28.870
 cm maybe out and there we see 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:31.540
 now here so the alien I already quite 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:36.100
 nice bunch can enter it 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:38.260
 comes off is a little bit of blood and 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:40.660
 walls as a potato are still under me 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.150
 I thought so that I so with it 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.620
 I went no matter how many times a body 

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:46.810
 So do not put it that way 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:48.790
 I will aim a broad furrow 

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.820
 also show a video again if we 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.760
 The potatoes plant in two three 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:56.890
 weeks or so there you can see now 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.900
 Then I want to be in this series here 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.120
 Now here just pulled is into the 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.010
 Put in the valley and the potatoes and 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:04.780
 then with the things exactly through the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.890
 then have to watch the 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:08.540
 one 

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:11.840
 well you can see it just the hood that 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:15.020
 almost to the top and then again 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:18.260
 smooth pulled with the sample that is one 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:23.210
 singer channel with inga kappel wherever 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:25.520
 bought a nice buy as it is in the 

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.960
 stables or ground pretty hard 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:30.720
 You can see it up here in the first one too 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.560

 extremely many stones on small 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.230
 Pebbles you might have 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:45.510
 have looked 

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:47.760
 at my Milling video or and thought 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:49.530
 the potato has planted in the 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.660
 Last year, too , one should only 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:51.960
 It can not be done every four years on 16 years 

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:54.690
 do 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.590
 I have to get out of this every year 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.590
 works or it does not work 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:11.880

00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:19.819
 also a legal video what if we 

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.819
 it wanted because well 

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:27.529
 we have it like this 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.210
 600 700 it hit comes up 800 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:31.909

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:43.369
 well I had 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:47.629
 and if you have a good time 

00:05:43.369 --> 00:05:50.559
