00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:31.330
 and furniture that is not used or that only 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.060

 distribution of furniture in the 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.520
 inside the place since the furniture 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.510
 They can both bring beauty to the place 

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:27.210
 how to spoil the existing decoration 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:30.300

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:34.790
 the place will generate a style 

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:34.790
 very unsightly and grotesque 

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:40.370
 The first thing that you should have in 

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:42.160
 account is the space that the 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:44.860
 living place

 from this any furniture 

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.690
 that you choose to place must adjust to the 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.870

 a space where people can 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:59.460
 travel without any intervention 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.490
 these at the same time must have designs and 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.630
 colors that harmonize perfectly with 

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:05.630
 the rest of the decoration 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.060
 this will make the whole interior of the place 

00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:15.440
 it becomes elegant and very functional 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.440
