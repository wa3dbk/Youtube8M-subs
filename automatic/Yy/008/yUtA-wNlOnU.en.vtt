00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.480
 after entering the village day and night 

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:08.270
 the houses are overgrown with platinumgames the evil look is 

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.210
 on this small Ardennes village it's weird there are not more than seven 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.359
 French over ten years 

00:00:13.359 --> 00:00:15.919
 was there any discussion that followed 

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:17.640
 but the report 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.790
 everything down below the hammer what counts 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:26.089
 the goal to make a perimeter of his village is celebrating the trial of 

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:28.949
 stop whistling from the village's history 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.590
 so that was a way that more publicity within three years putting in 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.030
 featured this business process 

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.220
 and then for him too the festive side the gathering side consecutively 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.580
 everyone puts their hands to the dough is said 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.110
 for that success in nearly 3,000 people gathered 

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.370
 to assist any of his shares 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.120
 for its third edition by saying novelties have been made to 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.450
 shows this year 6 euros per hour added a new scene so 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:56.350
 At the trial 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.210
 we changed witnesses there who changed at the front 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.870
 and we make good drives every time we have to replace the 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.100
 constitution 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.400
 anyway I have small changes he sacrificed 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.520
 but that's also what makes good every time 

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.700
 we find something the funniest came to help come to unite 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.050
 for precisely the witch 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.400
 and then good of France in South Africa we are feeling concerned 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.400
 this central staged costumes are well made 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.100
 the secretariat and shows we got with the ump how is it called yes 

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.360
 this last yes 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:32.490
 but for the little ones too this closure 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.490
 it's beautiful ended in beauty 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.420
 for amateurs who endure they are all amateurs so necessarily 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:43.460
 villagers had games from older people who have 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.000
 spontaneously% 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.710
 this tonight 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.570
 she declares herself propose courts to participate in this 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.500
 constitution as for them 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.740
 for once the verdict pronounced against the trend 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.580
 and no matter how much the comedians are totally in the time trial 

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.460
 forced the assembly 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.210
 it is clear that the staging very surprising a little too trash not 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:07.000
 baby 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.140
 in Europe the spectators can not be beautiful 

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:12.130
 I think that with the record this is private of his life but I think that our 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:14.139
 dad full meal possible 

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:18.049
 after a precedent anyway it appears in photo this amendment has 

00:02:18.049 --> 00:02:20.339
 actually appreciable but good 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.539
 at the same time in the preparation 

00:02:22.539 --> 00:02:25.699
 damn I do not think smuggling coffee-tobacco biak the 

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:28.690
 locals are sucked by two of the not-so-good remarks 

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.029
 to have a good time with the kids and that's good 

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.029
 the facade 

00:02:32.029 --> 00:02:33.379
 sudan sudan oyee oh yes 

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:34.439
 c 

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:38.860
 It's great that all people do not even talk to each other. 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.349
 there is a family atmosphere 

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.579
 leave it despite a player% for a little bit uncertain we were afraid that the 

00:02:46.579 --> 00:02:51.730
 rare witch eventually throws it to some extent that somewhere we are the 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.189
 higher for that is the sensation and many more 

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:58.179
 after more than two hours of show place at the party 

00:02:58.179 --> 00:03:02.339
 finally the witch does not overdo the face distrust anyway 

00:03:02.339 --> 00:03:03.309
 they are never far away
