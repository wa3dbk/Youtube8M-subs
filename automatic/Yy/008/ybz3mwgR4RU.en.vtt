Mac cheated themselves out of this

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.920 
Mac cheated themselves out of this
collection<00:00:17.970> I<00:00:18.449> feel<00:00:19.260> like<00:00:19.470> I<00:00:20.480> mean<00:00:21.480> pink<00:00:21.750> is

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
collection I feel like I mean pink is

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.150 
collection I feel like I mean pink is
very<00:00:21.960> Miss<00:00:22.289> Piggy<00:00:22.619> but<00:00:22.740> I<00:00:22.769> feel<00:00:22.949> like<00:00:22.980> they

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
very Miss Piggy but I feel like they

very Miss Piggy but I feel like they
should<00:00:23.189> have<00:00:23.460> done<00:00:23.490> a<00:00:23.880> pink<00:00:24.150> lipstick<00:00:24.990> maybe<00:00:25.980> a

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
should have done a pink lipstick maybe a

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.080 
should have done a pink lipstick maybe a
pink<00:00:26.369> blush<00:00:27.170> as<00:00:28.400> well<00:00:29.400> as<00:00:29.550> the<00:00:29.670> eyeshadow
