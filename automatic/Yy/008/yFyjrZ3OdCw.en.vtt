solid but his brother is fluid

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.800 
solid but his brother is fluid
he<00:01:53.640> has<00:01:54.060> example<00:01:54.689> if<00:01:54.930> insects<00:01:55.920> is<00:01:56.810> sitting

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
he has example if insects is sitting

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.429 
he has example if insects is sitting
there<00:01:58.399> someone<00:01:59.399> will<00:01:59.640> step<00:01:59.969> on<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.750> it<00:02:01.290> would

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
there someone will step on it it would

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.840 
there someone will step on it it would
die<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:02.579> the<00:02:03.240> better<00:02:03.479> is<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.960> the<00:02:04.770> insects<00:02:05.430> walk

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
die so the better is if the insects walk

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.240 
die so the better is if the insects walk
in<00:02:06.090> a<00:02:06.270> straight<00:02:06.540> line<00:02:06.630> is<00:02:07.079> very<00:02:07.619> hard<00:02:07.979> for<00:02:08.190> us

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
in a straight line is very hard for us

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.110 
in a straight line is very hard for us
to<00:02:08.429> step<00:02:09.149> on<00:02:09.390> it<00:02:09.599> even<00:02:10.470> better<00:02:10.920> it<00:02:11.280> is<00:02:11.550> rather

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
to step on it even better it is rather

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.949 
to step on it even better it is rather
the<00:02:12.420> street

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
the street

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:17.300 
the street
like<00:02:13.200> if<00:02:13.709> you<00:02:13.950> go<00:02:14.159> an<00:02:14.519> s-shape<00:02:15.890> it's<00:02:16.890> an<00:02:17.040> email

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
like if you go an s-shape it's an email

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.920 
like if you go an s-shape it's an email
harder<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.359> hardest<00:02:18.750> if<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.859> use<00:02:20.069> items<00:02:20.489> fly

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:20.930 
harder the hardest if that use items fly

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.190 
harder the hardest if that use items fly
3d<00:02:21.930> that's<00:02:22.650> the<00:02:22.950> hardest<00:02:23.370> so<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:24.599> trying<00:02:24.900> to

00:03:50.839 --> 00:03:50.849 
teaching water-tight is initial form and

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
analogy for a fishing net even if you

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.149 
analogy for a fishing net even if you
have<00:03:58.889> so<00:03:59.159> many<00:03:59.370> good<00:04:00.060> part<00:04:00.750> of<00:04:00.900> net<00:04:01.229> if<00:04:01.500> even

00:04:02.149 --> 00:04:02.159 
have so many good part of net if even

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:05.390 
have so many good part of net if even
even<00:04:03.060> if<00:04:03.209> you<00:04:03.359> have<00:04:03.569> a<00:04:03.599> small<00:04:04.169> hole<00:04:04.530> the<00:04:05.159> fish

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
even if you have a small hole the fish

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.589 
even if you have a small hole the fish
you<00:04:05.849> escape

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:06.599 
you escape

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:10.339 
you escape
so<00:04:06.900> it's<00:04:07.079> not<00:04:07.259> any<00:04:07.709> one<00:04:08.340> particular<00:04:08.639> form<00:04:09.629> but

00:04:10.339 --> 00:04:10.349 
so it's not any one particular form but

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:13.099 
so it's not any one particular form but
that<00:04:10.379> is<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.919> idea<00:04:11.340> the<00:04:11.970> initial<00:04:12.540> form<00:04:12.870> or

that is the idea the initial form or

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:16.650 
last form is a sufficient no there are

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.689 
last form is a sufficient no there are

have a in Anyang but we can introduce so
that<00:04:56.870> we<00:04:56.990> can<00:04:57.140> explain<00:04:57.620> things<00:04:58.120> in<00:04:59.120> general

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
that we can explain things in general

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.320 
that we can explain things in general
the<00:05:00.260> looseness<00:05:00.920> need<00:05:01.520> to<00:05:01.670> include<00:05:02.120> the

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.330 
the looseness need to include the

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.360 
the looseness need to include the
tightness<00:05:02.780> at<00:05:03.140> least<00:05:03.410> either<00:05:03.860> include

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
tightness at least either include

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:07.390 
tightness at least either include
looseness<00:05:05.200> patreon<00:05:06.200> lovin<00:05:06.500> the<00:05:07.070> tightness

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:07.400 
looseness patreon lovin the tightness

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.690 
looseness patreon lovin the tightness
the<00:05:07.850> looseness<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.870> very<00:05:09.290> similar<00:05:09.590> to<00:05:09.770> yin<00:05:10.490> and

00:05:10.690 --> 00:05:10.700 
the looseness is very similar to yin and

00:05:10.700 --> 00:05:14.230 
the looseness is very similar to yin and
yang<00:05:10.960> so<00:05:11.960> the<00:05:12.080> page<00:05:12.260> 11<00:05:12.830> is<00:05:13.040> the<00:05:13.130> end<00:05:13.790> of<00:05:14.060> the

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
yang so the page 11 is the end of the

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.900 
yang so the page 11 is the end of the
section<00:05:14.630> 1<00:05:14.870> section<00:05:15.110> 2<00:05:16.070> start<00:05:16.820> page<00:05:17.180> 14
