00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:43.030 
they're coming around the woods this way
and<00:03:41.870> then<00:03:42.019> they're<00:03:42.169> going<00:03:42.349> around<00:03:42.530> the<00:03:42.829> side

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
and then they're going around the side

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:45.369 
and then they're going around the side

00:03:45.369 --> 00:03:45.379 
of the hill that way so for me this is

00:03:45.379 --> 00:03:47.170 
of the hill that way so for me this is
going<00:03:45.620> to<00:03:45.739> be<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:45.859> pretty<00:03:46.129> good<00:03:46.340> setup<00:03:46.669> to<00:03:46.969> catch

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
going to be a pretty good setup to catch

this way

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.110 
this way
the<00:04:03.739> top<00:04:03.949> of<00:04:04.099> this<00:04:04.189> Reed<00:04:04.459> right<00:04:04.729> here<00:04:05.000> is

the top of this Reed right here is

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:07.830 
the top of this Reed right here is
pretty<00:04:05.329> clear<00:04:05.769> but<00:04:06.769> and<00:04:06.979> I<00:04:07.189> know<00:04:07.250> from

00:04:07.830 --> 00:04:07.840 
pretty clear but and I know from

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.409 
pretty clear but and I know from
previous<00:04:08.840> experience<00:04:09.829> that<00:04:09.919> deer<00:04:10.729> usually

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:11.419 
previous experience that deer usually

00:04:11.419 --> 00:04:13.749 
previous experience that deer usually
will<00:04:11.599> come<00:04:11.629> in<00:04:12.169> most<00:04:12.829> of<00:04:13.009> the<00:04:13.099> time<00:04:13.310> if<00:04:13.519> they're

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:13.759 
will come in most of the time if they're

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.180 
will come in most of the time if they're
not<00:04:13.879> being<00:04:14.090> disturbed<00:04:14.540> by<00:04:14.780> any<00:04:15.079> hunters<00:04:15.500> they

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:16.190 
not being disturbed by any hunters they

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:19.629 
not being disturbed by any hunters they
will<00:04:16.340> come<00:04:16.549> in<00:04:16.820> from<00:04:17.599> there<00:04:18.079> they're<00:04:18.639> thickest

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
will come in from there they're thickest

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:21.550 
will come in from there they're thickest
because<00:04:20.539> that's<00:04:20.780> where<00:04:20.959> they<00:04:21.049> like<00:04:21.229> to<00:04:21.380> hang

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
because that's where they like to hang

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.740 
because that's where they like to hang
out<00:04:21.769> and<00:04:22.039> they're<00:04:22.400> really<00:04:22.669> cautious<00:04:23.300> and<00:04:23.509> they
