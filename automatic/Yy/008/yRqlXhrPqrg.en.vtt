the sir in the second term we expected a
greater<00:01:32.340> transparency<00:01:32.610> and<00:01:33.450> the<00:01:34.049> fact<00:01:34.229> that

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
greater transparency and the fact that

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.649 
greater transparency and the fact that
he<00:01:34.380> had<00:01:34.590> said<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.310> he<00:01:35.430> would<00:01:35.640> go<00:01:36.210> against<00:01:36.600> the

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
he had said that he would go against the

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.539 
he had said that he would go against the
wiretapping<00:01:37.170> and<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.979> surveillance<00:01:38.400> of

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
wiretapping and the surveillance of

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:39.950 
wiretapping and the surveillance of
Americans<00:01:38.939> he's<00:01:39.060> done<00:01:39.150> exactly<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.570> opposite

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
Americans he's done exactly the opposite

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.710 
Americans he's done exactly the opposite
and<00:01:40.350> I<00:01:40.680> think<00:01:40.860> it's<00:01:40.979> a<00:01:41.189> scandal<00:01:41.700> because<00:01:42.450> it's

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
and I think it's a scandal because it's

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
and I think it's a scandal because it's
a<00:01:42.780> taboo<00:01:43.140> in<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> German<00:01:43.649> society<00:01:43.770> a

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
a taboo in the German society a

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.100 
a taboo in the German society a
surveillance<00:01:45.090> generally<00:01:45.450> after<00:01:45.720> their

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
surveillance generally after their

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.859 
surveillance generally after their
experience<00:01:46.500> with<00:01:46.590> totalitarianism<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:47.869> yeah

think this is an aberration yeah I think

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.650 
think this is an aberration yeah I think
these<00:02:28.910> are<00:02:28.970> the<00:02:29.150> things<00:02:29.240> that<00:02:29.390> we<00:02:29.450> should<00:02:29.600> be

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
these are the things that we should be

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:31.600 
these are the things that we should be
bringing<00:02:29.750> to<00:02:30.530> light<00:02:30.709> and<00:02:31.040> say<00:02:31.250> no<00:02:31.400> it's<00:02:31.550> just

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
bringing to light and say no it's just

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:34.060 
bringing to light and say no it's just
not<00:02:31.820> acceptable
