sometimes<00:00:02.780> these<00:00:03.050> tweets<00:00:03.439> are<00:00:03.620> the<00:00:03.830> hardest

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.160 
sometimes these tweets are the hardest

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:10.300 
sometimes these tweets are the hardest
ones<00:00:04.310> to<00:00:04.430> get<00:00:04.610> out<00:00:04.760> because<00:00:05.200> they<00:00:06.200> are<00:00:09.310> smaller

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:10.310 
ones to get out because they are smaller

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.710 
ones to get out because they are smaller
than<00:00:10.519> the<00:00:10.670> other<00:00:10.790> trees<00:00:11.120> and<00:00:11.150> they<00:00:11.360> get<00:00:11.540> hung

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:11.720 
than the other trees and they get hung

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:13.960 
than the other trees and they get hung
up<00:00:11.840> we<00:00:12.800> have<00:00:12.890> to<00:00:13.010> use<00:00:13.160> horses<00:00:13.490> to<00:00:13.700> actually

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:13.970 
up we have to use horses to actually

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:16.390 
up we have to use horses to actually
pull<00:00:14.180> them<00:00:14.330> down<00:00:14.360> like<00:00:14.780> that<00:00:14.960> last<00:00:15.309> treated<00:00:16.309> we

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
pull them down like that last treated we

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.279 
pull them down like that last treated we
just<00:00:16.609> brought<00:00:16.820> out<00:00:18.970> yeah<00:00:19.970> we're<00:00:20.749> going<00:00:20.989> up<00:00:21.109> and

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:21.289 
just brought out yeah we're going up and

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:24.040 
just brought out yeah we're going up and
yeah<00:00:22.009> we're<00:00:22.189> going<00:00:22.369> up<00:00:22.460> in<00:00:22.579> the<00:00:22.669> woods<00:00:22.880> to<00:00:23.150> to

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
yeah we're going up in the woods to to

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.829 
yeah we're going up in the woods to to
do<00:00:24.199> some<00:00:24.409> restorative<00:00:25.099> forestry<00:00:25.699> and

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:25.839 
do some restorative forestry and

00:00:25.839 --> 00:00:27.880 
do some restorative forestry and
restorative<00:00:26.839> forestry<00:00:27.319> is<00:00:27.409> based<00:00:27.679> on

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:27.890 
restorative forestry is based on

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:30.040 
restorative forestry is based on
imitating<00:00:28.310> nature<00:00:28.669> and<00:00:29.210> taking<00:00:29.689> the<00:00:29.810> worst

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:30.050 
imitating nature and taking the worst

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.499 
imitating nature and taking the worst
trees<00:00:30.380> first<00:00:30.769> and<00:00:31.069> then<00:00:31.669> the<00:00:31.759> worst<00:00:31.909> trees<00:00:32.239> in

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:32.509 
trees first and then the worst trees in

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:34.950 
trees first and then the worst trees in
this<00:00:32.660> situation<00:00:33.260> are<00:00:33.440> already<00:00:34.250> standing<00:00:34.489> dead

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
this situation are already standing dead

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.450 
this situation are already standing dead
but<00:00:35.960> there<00:00:36.140> they<00:00:36.500> still<00:00:36.710> have<00:00:36.920> sound<00:00:37.190> enough

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:37.460 
but there they still have sound enough

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:39.250 
but there they still have sound enough
material<00:00:37.910> and<00:00:38.030> I'm<00:00:38.090> not<00:00:38.239> there<00:00:38.449> that<00:00:39.050> it's

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
material and I'm not there that it's

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.889 
material and I'm not there that it's
good<00:00:39.469> few<00:00:39.710> would<00:00:39.949> a<00:00:39.980> good<00:00:40.250> firewood<00:00:40.699> and<00:00:41.059> we're

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
good few would a good firewood and we're

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.770 
good few would a good firewood and we're
going<00:00:42.079> to<00:00:42.340> go<00:00:43.340> pick<00:00:43.789> the<00:00:43.969> ones<00:00:44.149> out<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.629> are

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:44.780 
going to go pick the ones out that are

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.750 
going to go pick the ones out that are
standing<00:00:45.649> dead<00:00:45.890> and<00:00:47.019> follow<00:00:48.019> them<00:00:48.760> without

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 
standing dead and follow them without

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.939 
standing dead and follow them without
only<00:00:50.480> what<00:00:50.690> we<00:00:50.839> won't<00:00:51.019> believe<00:00:51.410> to<00:00:51.620> grow<00:00:51.769> in

00:00:51.939 --> 00:00:51.949 
only what we won't believe to grow in

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:54.160 
only what we won't believe to grow in
the<00:00:52.010> kitchen<00:00:52.370> use<00:00:53.149> the<00:00:53.269> horses<00:00:53.510> to<00:00:53.660> extract

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:54.170 
the kitchen use the horses to extract

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.779 
the kitchen use the horses to extract
them<00:00:54.289> without<00:00:54.559> rubbing<00:00:55.010> or<00:00:55.160> damaging<00:00:55.579> any<00:00:55.760> of

the tree centre that we're leaving for

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.189 
the tree centre that we're leaving for
the<00:00:57.859> future<00:00:58.390> and<00:00:59.390> that's<00:00:59.659> that's<00:00:59.960> what

00:01:00.189 --> 00:01:00.199 
the future and that's that's what

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.579 
the future and that's that's what
historically<00:01:00.679> forestry<00:01:01.190> basically<00:01:01.699> is<00:01:02.589> some

historically forestry basically is some

historically forestry basically is some
all<00:01:03.769> the<00:01:03.980> trees<00:01:04.190> don't<00:01:04.430> grow<00:01:04.550> to<00:01:04.700> a<00:01:04.820> full<00:01:05.120> life

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:05.360 
all the trees don't grow to a full life

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.640 
all the trees don't grow to a full life
when<00:01:05.600> trees<00:01:05.990> have<00:01:06.170> different<00:01:06.500> life

when trees have different life

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.100 
when trees have different life
expectancy<00:01:07.460> they<00:01:08.090> play<00:01:08.330> different<00:01:08.630> roles<00:01:08.780> in

the ecosystem in the forest and some of

the ecosystem in the forest and some of
these<00:01:11.390> trees<00:01:11.720> have<00:01:11.930> done<00:01:12.170> their<00:01:12.350> job<00:01:12.680> and

these trees have done their job and

instead<00:01:15.650> of<00:01:15.800> letting<00:01:16.070> them<00:01:16.190> just<00:01:16.220> fall<00:01:16.580> over

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:16.610 
instead of letting them just fall over

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.310 
instead of letting them just fall over
the<00:01:16.880> rock<00:01:17.060> the<00:01:17.210> forest<00:01:17.540> floor<00:01:17.660> we're<00:01:18.050> going<00:01:18.230> to

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:18.320 
the rock the forest floor we're going to

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.580 
the rock the forest floor we're going to
extract<00:01:19.160> them<00:01:19.310> and<00:01:19.430> use<00:01:20.360> them<00:01:20.570> to<00:01:20.600> keep

extract them and use them to keep

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.270 
extract them and use them to keep
ourselves<00:01:21.770> warm<00:01:22.100> here<00:01:22.520> this<00:01:22.730> winter<00:01:27.160> look<00:01:28.160> at

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:28.280 
ourselves warm here this winter look at

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.370 
ourselves warm here this winter look at
this<00:01:28.780> wonderful<00:01:29.780> peak<00:01:30.650> fall<00:01:31.400> foliage<00:01:31.700> is

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
this wonderful peak fall foliage is

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.410 
this wonderful peak fall foliage is
every<00:01:33.380> color<00:01:33.620> imaginable<00:01:33.940> in<00:01:34.940> the<00:01:35.030> forest

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
every color imaginable in the forest

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.030 
every color imaginable in the forest
either<00:01:35.690> all<00:01:36.140> the<00:01:36.620> light<00:01:36.860> is<00:01:37.100> exquisitely<00:01:37.960> just

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
either all the light is exquisitely just

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.890 
either all the light is exquisitely just
shows<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.310> these<00:01:40.550> these<00:01:41.120> wonderful<00:01:41.600> colors

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:41.900
