we'll<00:00:51.899> go<00:00:51.989> through<00:00:52.020> the<00:00:52.320> patterns<00:00:52.770> this<00:00:52.980> is

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
we'll go through the patterns this is

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.189 
we'll go through the patterns this is
the<00:00:53.219> one<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.460> it<00:00:53.579> comes<00:00:53.789> on<00:00:54.030> from<00:00:54.360> from<00:00:55.140> a

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
the one that it comes on from from a

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.650 
the one that it comes on from from a
dead<00:00:55.379> stop<00:00:55.760> the<00:00:56.760> one<00:00:56.940> thing<00:00:57.059> I<00:00:57.180> don't<00:00:57.239> like<00:00:57.510> is

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
dead stop the one thing I don't like is

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.479 
dead stop the one thing I don't like is
it<00:00:57.930> doesn't<00:00:58.199> seem<00:00:58.350> to<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.649> memory<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.460> it

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
it doesn't seem to have a memory so it

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.160 
it doesn't seem to have a memory so it
doesn't<00:00:59.879> remember<00:01:00.149> what<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.660> last<00:01:00.690> pattern

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
doesn't remember what the last pattern

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.630 
doesn't remember what the last pattern
you<00:01:01.500> left<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:01.829> on<00:01:01.890> when<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.160> turn<00:01:02.340> it<00:01:02.370> off

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
you left it on when you turn it off

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.289 
you left it on when you turn it off
which<00:01:02.910> would<00:01:03.090> be<00:01:03.210> nice<00:01:04.369> it<00:01:05.369> always<00:01:05.790> comes<00:01:05.820> onto

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
did notice that the strip on the left

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.130 
did notice that the strip on the left
side<00:02:35.140> here<00:02:36.120> tends<00:02:37.120> to<00:02:37.359> be<00:02:37.510> a<00:02:37.540> slightly

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
side here tends to be a slightly

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.110 
side here tends to be a slightly
different<00:02:38.500> shade<00:02:38.920> than<00:02:39.099> the<00:02:39.250> other<00:02:39.430> three<00:02:39.790> it

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:40.120 
different shade than the other three it

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.520 
different shade than the other three it
looks<00:02:40.359> like<00:02:40.569> and<00:02:40.840> there's<00:02:41.019> nothing<00:02:41.230> that<00:02:41.410> I

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:41.530 
looks like and there's nothing that I

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.069 
looks like and there's nothing that I
can<00:02:41.709> do<00:02:41.829> to<00:02:41.980> fix<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.370> I<00:02:42.870> guess<00:02:43.870> it's<00:02:44.049> just

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:44.079 
can do to fix it I guess it's just

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:48.629 
can do to fix it I guess it's just
something<00:02:44.410> I<00:02:44.500> have<00:02:44.709> to<00:02:44.799> live<00:02:44.980> with<00:02:47.489> there<00:02:48.489> is

00:02:48.629 --> 00:02:48.639 
something I have to live with there is

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:52.740 
something I have to live with there is
off<00:02:48.910> and<00:02:49.299> back<00:02:50.079> on<00:02:50.579> it<00:02:51.579> does<00:02:51.910> remember<00:02:52.389> if<00:02:52.569> it's

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
off and back on it does remember if it's

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:55.110 
off and back on it does remember if it's
had<00:02:52.930> the<00:02:53.049> power<00:02:53.260> not<00:02:53.560> interrupted<00:02:54.280> where<00:02:54.819> was

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
had the power not interrupted where was

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.470 
had the power not interrupted where was
last<00:02:55.620> it<00:02:56.620> also<00:02:56.889> does<00:02:57.549> have<00:02:57.760> a<00:02:57.790> function<00:02:58.359> where

00:02:58.470 --> 00:02:58.480 
last it also does have a function where

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.390 
last it also does have a function where
it<00:02:58.630> will<00:02:58.720> beat<00:02:58.900> to<00:02:59.049> the<00:02:59.139> music<00:02:59.440> and<00:02:59.859> change

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
it will beat to the music and change

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.789 
it will beat to the music and change
color<00:03:00.730> from<00:03:00.900> whatever<00:03:01.900> color<00:03:02.319> it<00:03:02.410> is<00:03:02.590> at<00:03:02.769> that

00:03:02.789 --> 00:03:02.799 
color from whatever color it is at that

00:03:02.799 --> 00:03:05.220 
color from whatever color it is at that
time<00:03:03.220> when<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.579> hits<00:03:03.760> a<00:03:03.849> bass<00:03:04.030> beats<00:03:04.359> it'll<00:03:04.810> go

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
time when it hits a bass beats it'll go

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.920 
time when it hits a bass beats it'll go
to<00:03:05.260> a<00:03:05.410> white<00:03:05.799> flash<00:03:06.220> like<00:03:06.669> the<00:03:07.299> thing<00:03:07.510> I<00:03:07.599> found

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
to a white flash like the thing I found

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:11.280 
to a white flash like the thing I found
though<00:03:08.169> is<00:03:08.200> that<00:03:08.470> it<00:03:08.950> is<00:03:09.099> very<00:03:09.430> sensitive<00:03:10.290> and

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
though is that it is very sensitive and

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:13.500 
though is that it is very sensitive and
the<00:03:11.829> radio<00:03:12.160> does<00:03:12.430> not<00:03:12.579> have<00:03:12.790> to<00:03:12.910> be<00:03:12.940> very<00:03:13.209> loud

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:13.510 
the radio does not have to be very loud

00:03:13.510 --> 00:03:17.520 
the radio does not have to be very loud
at<00:03:13.690> all<00:03:13.840> and<00:03:14.200> it<00:03:14.769> will<00:03:14.980> end<00:03:15.310> up<00:03:16.079> doing<00:03:17.079> it<00:03:17.230> doing

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:17.530 
at all and it will end up doing it doing

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:20.159 
at all and it will end up doing it doing
the<00:03:17.709> beat<00:03:18.000> constantly<00:03:19.000> if<00:03:19.209> you<00:03:19.359> if<00:03:19.810> you<00:03:19.989> have

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:20.169 
the beat constantly if you if you have

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.460 
the beat constantly if you if you have
it<00:03:20.319> too<00:03:20.440> much<00:03:20.620> but<00:03:21.430> anyway<00:03:21.880> that's<00:03:22.209> the

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
it too much but anyway that's the

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.259 
it too much but anyway that's the
install<00:03:23.470> on<00:03:23.590> that<00:03:23.769> I<00:03:24.040> did<00:03:24.519> the<00:03:24.639> LEDs<00:03:25.000> in<00:03:25.180> the

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
install on that I did the LEDs in the

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:27.000 
install on that I did the LEDs in the
house<00:03:25.419> in<00:03:25.599> the<00:03:25.690> sunroom<00:03:25.900> and<00:03:26.290> really<00:03:26.859> like

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
house in the sunroom and really like

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:28.440 
house in the sunroom and really like
that<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:27.400> I<00:03:27.459> figured<00:03:27.730> I'd<00:03:27.819> try<00:03:27.970> something<00:03:28.000> in

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:28.450 
that so I figured I'd try something in

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:30.660 
that so I figured I'd try something in
the<00:03:28.510> boat
