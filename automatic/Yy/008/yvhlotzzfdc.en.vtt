00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello hello thank you for having us 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.469
 joined for this new episode of your 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.750
 Favorite show 

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:17.610
 remember last week I 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.710
 explained to you why they say it's 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.660
 byzance to talk about luxury and 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.100
 opulence and at the end of the show I 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.500
 you told me that I will offer you 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.270
 this week a second expression in 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.460
 link with byzance and ben precisely 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.560
 the speech of the day designates 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.410
 endless arguments without real interest 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.539
 who get lost in detail in subtlety and 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.550
 which in the end does not interest many people 

00:00:36.539 --> 00:00:40.710
 of course it's the famous ones 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.460
 Byzantine quarrel we are going to talk about 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.980
 today 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:46.829
 but why are they Byzantine and 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.420
 no father's week or Germanic and well 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:51.530
 to illustrate our expression 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:53.879
 let's go back to May 1453 

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.979
 at that time the city of 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:58.199
 Constantinople is besieged by the army 

00:00:55.979 --> 00:01:00.629
 Ottoman pounding the city without 

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.129
 release for several days and then 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.229
 that the city is on fire 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.360
 it is said that religious of the West 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.130
 and constantinople spend their time 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.500
 locked in discussions too 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.610
 vain than endless on topics 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.560
 purely theological 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:16.619
 what is the nature of christ is this 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.140
 that it is 100% is 100% god or 50% 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:20.399
 of both is purgatory exist 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.079
 really and what are they 

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:24.450
 look like and then for the hosts 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.369
 do we use unleavened bread or 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:27.990
 leavened bread and there is also the famous 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.130
 question of angels' sex 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.930
 do they only have one body 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.430
 spiritual if we can say where is this 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.530
 that they are sexed like you and me 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.179
 but these are just some examples 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 which may appear today at 

00:01:36.179 --> 00:01:39.719
 some not very interesting 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:41.759
 so that's why we talk about 

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:43.439
 Byzantine quarrels to evoke the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.179
 somewhat surreal character of 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.159
 some concerns and hassle 

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:48.990
 while there are many more important to 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.090
 manage otherwise but in reality 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.469
 aiming it was not the only place where 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:54.359
 we discuss and very long 

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:55.920
 questions of theology so why 

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:56.460
 it is she who is targeted by our 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.890
 expression 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.469
 Well, it's probably at the beginning 

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:03.479
 history of languages in the third century 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:04.799
 after jesus christ the worsened Roman is 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.079
 divided into two parts 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:09.450
 the worsened Roman of the West where we speak 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.350
 Latin and the Eastern Roman Empire where one 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:13.140
 by the Greek 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.790
 but each language has its own genius in 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 link with its culture 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.420
 one will have a lot of fuzziness and 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.519
 philosophical and religious concepts 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:22.349
 refined while the other will be more 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:25.109
 subtle in the legal field by 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.879
 example then linguistic break then 

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:27.450
 political break between orient and 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:29.459
 West 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.159
 finally in a few decades 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.079
 we no longer understand the practices 

00:02:32.159 --> 00:02:35.489
 liturgical moves away and that of 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:37.319
 the other parent is necessarily 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:38.879
 founded it is for all these reasons that 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.159
 when rome representatives 

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.989
 join Constantinople and the bishops 

00:02:41.159 --> 00:02:45.750
 to try to unify their 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:47.209
 livers and words of the time it was 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.560
 obligatorily sparks 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:51.780
 each defends his point of view with 

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.489
 a very great energy and gave it place 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.099
 endless quarrels of which 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.389
 each accuses the other naturally but 

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.189
 we must admit that the 

00:02:57.389 --> 00:03:01.500
 richness of theological language of 

00:02:59.189 --> 00:03:03.480
 Eastern churches the large number 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.040
 of their scholars and the division of their 

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.530
 harvest she counts there are and 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:09.599
 alexandria accentuated seen from rome this 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:10.859
 impression of quarrels too subtle which 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:12.859
 cut the hair in four 

00:03:10.859 --> 00:03:15.269
 and here are our Byzantine quarrels 

00:03:12.859 --> 00:03:17.519
 partly justified but 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.930
 also partly unfairly bah yes because 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:20.159
 that these theological debates that 

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.840
 were stirring constantinople 

00:03:20.159 --> 00:03:25.290
 he was not as futile as he was 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.209
 says their fruits it's the creed saying that 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:29.430
 the christ is quite man is everything 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:30.329
 to god or not to say it changes 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:31.530
 a lot of things in 

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:33.510
 everyday behaviors 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.709
 fortunately that our fathers 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:37.590
 spent the time it took to 

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:39.239
 define the trinity for example because 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.370
 without these passionate debates and without 

00:03:39.239 --> 00:03:42.209
 safe and ben the Christian faith does not 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:43.530
 would not be what she is today 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:47.069
 quite simply 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:48.959
 so thank you rome thanks byzance and thank you 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:50.400
 to you who allowed me every week 

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:52.739
 not to cut hair in four 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.090
 but in eight or in 12 sometimes for 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.129
 understand the subtleties of our 

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.959
 culture a big thank you for your 

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.409
 fidelity and see you next week 

00:03:57.959 --> 00:04:00.409
 goodbye
