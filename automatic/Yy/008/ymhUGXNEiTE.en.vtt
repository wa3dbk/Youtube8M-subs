hard again from my point of view you

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.080

selected correctly in the first place

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.670 
selected correctly in the first place
and<00:02:05.450> I<00:02:05.570> just<00:02:05.600> think<00:02:05.870> everyone's<00:02:06.320> put<00:02:06.530> in<00:02:06.620> a

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:06.680 
and I just think everyone's put in a

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:08.470 
and I just think everyone's put in a
tremendous<00:02:06.950> performance<00:02:07.250> you<00:02:08.119> know<00:02:08.210> even

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:08.480 
tremendous performance you know even

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.359 
tremendous performance you know even
Ashley<00:02:08.600> Giles<00:02:09.110> after<00:02:09.950> what<00:02:10.070> he's<00:02:10.190> gone

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:10.369 
Ashley Giles after what he's gone

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:12.790 
Ashley Giles after what he's gone
through<00:02:10.429> he<00:02:10.850> ball<00:02:11.270> very<00:02:11.540> very<00:02:11.600> well<00:02:11.930> there

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:12.800 
through he ball very very well there

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.740 
through he ball very very well there
but<00:02:13.130> everyone<00:02:13.760> put<00:02:13.940> in<00:02:14.030> a<00:02:14.120> performance<00:02:14.390> and

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
but everyone put in a performance and

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.010 
but everyone put in a performance and
that's<00:02:14.870> crucial<00:02:15.530> I<00:02:16.540> guess<00:02:17.540> sometimes<00:02:17.750> when

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:18.020 
that's crucial I guess sometimes when

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.240 
that's crucial I guess sometimes when
you<00:02:18.110> look<00:02:18.230> at<00:02:18.320> these<00:02:18.410> guys<00:02:18.680> they'd<00:02:18.890> rather<00:02:19.070> get
