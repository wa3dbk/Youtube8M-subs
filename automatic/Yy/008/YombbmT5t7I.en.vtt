00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:07.049
 Hello everyone, today I'll show you how 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:10.370
 make a pair of earrings 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:13.440
 I will now use the 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.010
 new theories of the new nails that I have 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.650
 bought on the site of obvious beads and 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.130
 yesterday they arrived 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.640
 now we can see the needs 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:32.410
 we need two steps apiece 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:36.820
 flat silver-plated 2 silver nuns 

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:41.559
 rattled four blue half crystals 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:44.730
 cobalt and 4 for the vast luco net e 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:44.730
 various pliers 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.660
 first thing we go to get a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:56.460
 nail and let's insert a medium 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:02.970
 crystal after we go enter two 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:07.740
 cobalt blue sedans and a second vehicle 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.590
 crystal after with our foreheads yes 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:20.729
 I pulled this I was taken from the site of 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:22.830
 objectors we are going to cut one 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:28.130
 Once we cut, let's take them 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:28.130
 pisa curved tip and we're going to bend 

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.920

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:44.930

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:44.930
 church and with pliers we go to open 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:52.770
 we start to open after we take the 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.659
 our base we want to rage 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:58.290

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:05.520

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:09.899
 go and add it after we tighten ed 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:13.760
