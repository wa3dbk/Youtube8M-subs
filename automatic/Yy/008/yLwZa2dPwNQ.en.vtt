hair was like what I got this don't even
worry<00:02:22.990> about<00:02:23.110> it<00:02:23.410> it<00:02:23.740> got<00:02:24.040> a<00:02:24.070> little<00:02:24.280> damp

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
worry about it it got a little damp

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.870 
worry about it it got a little damp
didn't<00:02:25.510> touch<00:02:25.750> it<00:02:25.990> came<00:02:26.980> home<00:02:27.280> and<00:02:27.550> tried<00:02:27.850> and

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
didn't touch it came home and tried and

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.350 
didn't touch it came home and tried and
this<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.480> one<00:02:28.810> asked<00:02:28.990> me<00:02:29.110> about<00:02:29.410> her<00:02:29.530> angling<00:02:30.010> I

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
this is one asked me about her angling I

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.550 
this is one asked me about her angling I
thought<00:02:31.360> that<00:02:31.540> was<00:02:31.660> kind<00:02:31.930> of<00:02:32.020> an<00:02:32.140> odd<00:02:32.290> question

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
thought that was kind of an odd question

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.190 
thought that was kind of an odd question
because<00:02:33.370> it's<00:02:33.580> a<00:02:33.640> very<00:02:33.670> tight<00:02:34.330> curly<00:02:34.930> hair

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
because it's a very tight curly hair

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.070 
because it's a very tight curly hair
I've<00:02:35.980> never<00:02:36.580> run<00:02:37.030> my<00:02:37.240> fingers<00:02:37.660> through<00:02:37.870> it<00:02:37.900> the
