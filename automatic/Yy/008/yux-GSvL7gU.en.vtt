00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:50.430
 the grill does not bring the fish 

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:55.440

 pre-oiled 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:19.500

 Our little guns are laid out on 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:22.190

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:49.200

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:39.080
 by color it will darken more often before it goes 

00:04:49.490 --> 00:05:01.700
