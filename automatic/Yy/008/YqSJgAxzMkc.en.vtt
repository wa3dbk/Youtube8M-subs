00:00:00.069 --> 00:00:04.710
 with this pass practice he can quickly get to the table and I also have a good time 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.440
 vegetarian peak hours correlation murphy currents and bottles of rosemary 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.489
 perfectly flavored within this dish 

00:00:12.489 --> 00:00:16.699
 the withdrawal from medicine this year with three minutes of cooking in light 

00:00:16.699 --> 00:00:17.949
 salted water 

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.890
 we opt for tours that do not include ricotta and spinach marica either 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.979
 other types use that for an image in that with three places 

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:29.499
 while the pastor cooking times again time to dice the courgettes 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:33.960
 and braying in a little olive oil, therefore, a party may secretly 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.320
 garlic clove and then we stop everything for free 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.750
 in the meantime you can chop up the rosemary that has been used 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.750
 researchers are trying to flavor them 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.160
 now we put everything out of the pan but it has never been discovered before that is not necessary 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.600
 we crochet half of the arugula the other half is for later 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.620
 coarsely chopped arugula can now shrink for a minute on the fire 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.310
 who would not shell any money with anything else we need the ricotta 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:11.470
 others dream of grated Parmesan, black pepper and sea salt and good 

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.930
 could be 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.260
 Our tortellini served something different and was able to drain the pasta well 

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:22.620
 That is why I had half the course cubes and arugula 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.580
 now everything in the first set is the baking dish 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.370
 first you have skipper from half of the creamy tortellini team 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:39.220
 they would rather explain some vlezenbeek shit to them 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:40.060
 pasta 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.380
 the remaining corset the cubes and the rest of the arugula moke and new too 

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.230
 we think that off with another delicious layer of tortellini 

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:55.110
 and with what a bombshoes a closet wall agenda it will be our going 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.510
 get a nice and crispy crust 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:03.080
 the top three fifteen minutes in the oven at 180 degrees you have the shots 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.930
 fully prepared the day before, now make it ten minutes long 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:12.110
 at the end you can also use the official search light on the cheese 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.109
 brown 

00:02:13.109 --> 00:02:17.469
 we can sit at the table our pastor practice is very nice with a bicycle 

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:22.069
 from salad some baguette and a blog to a beer that I thought was this one 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.449
 tongerlo fire 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.369
