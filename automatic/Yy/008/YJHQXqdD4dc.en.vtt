impression<00:00:07.290> initial<00:00:08.040> review<00:00:08.429> on<00:00:08.700> a<00:00:09.000> couple<00:00:09.690> of

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
impression initial review on a couple of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.959 
impression initial review on a couple of
pretty<00:00:10.620> cheap<00:00:10.920> flashlights<00:00:11.490> that<00:00:11.610> I<00:00:11.730> just

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
pretty cheap flashlights that I just

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.390 
pretty cheap flashlights that I just
picked<00:00:12.150> up<00:00:12.269> now<00:00:12.990> I'll<00:00:13.980> tell<00:00:14.190> you<00:00:14.219> the

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
picked up now I'll tell you the

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.010 
picked up now I'll tell you the
reasoning<00:00:14.759> behind<00:00:14.849> these<00:00:15.269> flashlights<00:00:15.780> is

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
reasoning behind these flashlights is

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.890 
reasoning behind these flashlights is
I'm<00:00:16.379> putting<00:00:16.650> together<00:00:16.770> some<00:00:17.310> kits<00:00:17.750> to<00:00:18.750> have

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
I'm putting together some kits to have

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.480 
I'm putting together some kits to have
around<00:00:19.170> the<00:00:19.260> house<00:00:19.439> and<00:00:19.800> in<00:00:19.920> vehicles<00:00:20.340> and

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
around the house and in vehicles and

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.429 
around the house and in vehicles and
stuff<00:00:20.550> like<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:20.939> so<00:00:21.330> it's<00:00:21.990> probably<00:00:22.320> gonna

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
stuff like that so it's probably gonna

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.550 
stuff like that so it's probably gonna
be<00:00:22.619> something<00:00:22.859> that<00:00:23.220> I'm<00:00:23.490> not<00:00:23.550> gonna<00:00:24.000> be<00:00:24.180> using

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:24.560 
be something that I'm not gonna be using

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.250 
be something that I'm not gonna be using
you<00:00:25.560> know<00:00:25.650> maybe<00:00:25.859> never<00:00:26.250> or<00:00:26.599> very<00:00:27.599> very<00:00:27.930> rarely

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
you know maybe never or very very rarely

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.510 
you know maybe never or very very rarely
so<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.670> I<00:00:29.699> wanted<00:00:30.029> to<00:00:30.150> invest<00:00:31.399> you<00:00:32.399> know

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
so you know I wanted to invest you know

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.459 
so you know I wanted to invest you know
just<00:00:33.000> a<00:00:33.149> little<00:00:33.450> bit<00:00:33.570> of<00:00:33.719> money<00:00:33.899> in<00:00:34.020> putting

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
just a little bit of money in putting

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.690 
just a little bit of money in putting
these<00:00:34.559> kits<00:00:34.860> together<00:00:35.040> I<00:00:35.280> didn't<00:00:35.489> want<00:00:35.610> to

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
these kits together I didn't want to

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.610 
these kits together I didn't want to
break<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.000> bank<00:00:36.180> on<00:00:36.390> them<00:00:36.570> now<00:00:37.260> I<00:00:37.290> know<00:00:37.410> that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
break the bank on them now I know that

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.830 
break the bank on them now I know that
that<00:00:38.010> kind<00:00:38.280> of<00:00:38.340> thinking<00:00:38.760> is<00:00:39.030> a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:39.750> bit

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
that kind of thinking is a little bit

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.750 
that kind of thinking is a little bit
counterproductive<00:00:40.110> with<00:00:40.829> you<00:00:41.219> know<00:00:41.340> just<00:00:41.670> to

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
counterproductive with you know just to

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.090 
counterproductive with you know just to
preparing<00:00:42.239> this<00:00:42.360> philosophy<00:00:42.960> but<00:00:43.230> this<00:00:43.890> is

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:44.100 
preparing this philosophy but this is

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.250 
preparing this philosophy but this is
gonna<00:00:44.219> be<00:00:44.340> more<00:00:44.789> of<00:00:44.940> a<00:00:45.059> backup<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.690> my<00:00:45.840> backup

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
gonna be more of a backup to my backup

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
gonna be more of a backup to my backup
to<00:00:46.379> my<00:00:46.500> backup<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:47.489> figured<00:00:47.910> you<00:00:48.000> know<00:00:48.059> with

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
to my backup so I figured you know with

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.180 
to my backup so I figured you know with
with<00:00:48.840> this<00:00:48.960> particular<00:00:49.440> type<00:00:49.620> of<00:00:49.649> kits<00:00:49.980> I

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
with this particular type of kits I

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.520 
with this particular type of kits I
didn't<00:00:50.430> need<00:00:50.610> something<00:00:51.530> over-the-top

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
didn't need something over-the-top

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.350 
didn't need something over-the-top
especially<00:00:53.370> when<00:00:53.489> it<00:00:53.579> came<00:00:53.670> to<00:00:53.730> flashlights

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
especially when it came to flashlights

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.959 
especially when it came to flashlights
because<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.840> know<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.110> most<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.739> us<00:00:55.829> here<00:00:56.100> we

00:00:56.959 --> 00:00:56.969 
because you know as most of us here we

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:58.970 
because you know as most of us here we
have<00:00:57.180> multiple<00:00:57.840> flashlights<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:58.620> a<00:00:58.800> lot<00:00:58.949> of

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
have multiple flashlights and a lot of

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.439 
have multiple flashlights and a lot of
them<00:00:59.160> laying<00:00:59.340> around<00:00:59.489> in<00:00:59.760> vehicles<00:01:00.239> and<00:01:00.300> at

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449

cool<00:01:46.770> about<00:01:46.799> it<00:01:47.100> is<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.250> it's<00:01:47.610> um<00:01:47.820> it's<00:01:48.119> just

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
cool about it is that it's um it's just

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.389 
cool about it is that it's um it's just
it's<00:01:48.570> got<00:01:48.780> a<00:01:48.810> clip<00:01:49.229> on<00:01:49.409> it<00:01:49.590> so<00:01:50.130> it's<00:01:50.280> actually

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
it's got a clip on it so it's actually

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.170 
it's got a clip on it so it's actually
designed<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> be<00:01:51.180> mounted<00:01:52.040> vertically<00:01:53.040> so<00:01:54.030> if

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
designed to be mounted vertically so if

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:55.670 
designed to be mounted vertically so if
you're<00:01:54.299> gonna<00:01:54.390> clip<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.810> onto<00:01:54.930> like<00:01:55.140> a<00:01:55.170> pocket

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
you're gonna clip it onto like a pocket

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:58.730 
you're gonna clip it onto like a pocket
or<00:01:55.770> something<00:01:55.799> like<00:01:56.130> that<00:01:56.219> the<00:01:56.969> actual<00:01:57.740> switch

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
or something like that the actual switch

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.440 
or something like that the actual switch
is<00:01:58.950> on<00:01:59.070> the<00:01:59.189> top<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.430> it<00:01:59.700> here<00:01:59.729> and<00:02:00.149> it's<00:02:00.299> got

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
is on the top of it here and it's got

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.420 
is on the top of it here and it's got
you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.689> that<00:02:00.840> nice<00:02:01.229> blue<00:02:01.619> so<00:02:01.979> you<00:02:02.009> can<00:02:02.189> find

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
you know that nice blue so you can find

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.749 
you know that nice blue so you can find
it<00:02:02.579> real<00:02:02.759> easy<00:02:03.320> it<00:02:04.320> also<00:02:04.439> has<00:02:04.770> a<00:02:04.799> magnetic<00:02:05.189> base

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
it real easy it also has a magnetic base

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.550 
it real easy it also has a magnetic base
right<00:02:06.119> here<00:02:06.180> at<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.479> bottom<00:02:06.840> so<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.350> are

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
right here at the bottom so if you are

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.990 
right here at the bottom so if you are
if<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.160> need<00:02:08.310> to<00:02:08.369> put<00:02:08.550> it<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:08.729> on<00:02:08.849> your

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
if you need to put it like on your

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.630 
if you need to put it like on your
vehicle<00:02:09.450> or<00:02:09.780> any<00:02:10.140> magnetic<00:02:10.470> surface<00:02:10.979> it'll

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
vehicle or any magnetic surface it'll

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.420 
vehicle or any magnetic surface it'll
stick<00:02:11.910> to<00:02:12.090> it<00:02:12.239> so<00:02:12.620> basically<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:14.190> way

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
stick to it so basically the way

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:17.030 
stick to it so basically the way
works<00:02:14.640> is<00:02:14.879> you<00:02:15.390> know<00:02:15.480> it's<00:02:15.599> got<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.900> the<00:02:16.769> lens

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
works is you know it's got the the lens

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.280 
works is you know it's got the the lens
and<00:02:17.370> the<00:02:17.790> bulb<00:02:18.090> right<00:02:18.359> here<00:02:18.629> and<00:02:18.810> then<00:02:19.200> you

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.290 
and the bulb right here and then you

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.289 
and the bulb right here and then you
just<00:02:19.469> press<00:02:19.739> it<00:02:19.859> and<00:02:20.129> the<00:02:20.700> light<00:02:20.849> will<00:02:20.969> turn<00:02:21.000> on

00:02:21.289 --> 00:02:21.299 
just press it and the light will turn on

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:23.270 
just press it and the light will turn on
now<00:02:21.810> I<00:02:21.870> know<00:02:21.989> through<00:02:22.349> the<00:02:22.469> through<00:02:22.980> the<00:02:23.099> phone

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
now I know through the through the phone

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.830 
now I know through the through the phone
here<00:02:23.489> the<00:02:23.640> light<00:02:23.790> is<00:02:23.909> looking<00:02:24.150> kind<00:02:24.359> of<00:02:24.420> bluish

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:24.840 
here the light is looking kind of bluish

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:26.690 
here the light is looking kind of bluish
but<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.290> is<00:02:25.439> it's<00:02:25.769> supposed<00:02:26.219> to<00:02:26.280> be<00:02:26.430> a<00:02:26.459> white

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
but it is it's supposed to be a white

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.729 
but it is it's supposed to be a white
light<00:02:26.909> I<00:02:26.939> guess<00:02:27.120> it's<00:02:27.420> just<00:02:27.480> the<00:02:27.629> the<00:02:28.079> effect

00:02:28.729 --> 00:02:28.739 
light I guess it's just the the effect

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:30.440 
light I guess it's just the the effect
of<00:02:28.950> the<00:02:29.129> of<00:02:29.549> the<00:02:29.670> lighting<00:02:30.000> here<00:02:30.180> where<00:02:30.359> I'm

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
of the of the lighting here where I'm

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:33.500 
of the of the lighting here where I'm
doing<00:02:30.569> the<00:02:30.750> video<00:02:30.870> but<00:02:31.829> it<00:02:31.950> is<00:02:32.269> it<00:02:33.269> doesn't

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
doing the video but it is it doesn't

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:35.179 
doing the video but it is it doesn't
have<00:02:33.659> a<00:02:33.810> lot<00:02:34.049> of<00:02:34.079> throw<00:02:34.469> as<00:02:34.739> more<00:02:35.040> of<00:02:35.099> a

00:02:35.179 --> 00:02:35.189 
have a lot of throw as more of a

00:02:35.189 --> 00:02:38.420 
have a lot of throw as more of a
spotlight<00:02:36.079> flashlight<00:02:37.079> style<00:02:37.409> but<00:02:38.069> you<00:02:38.280> know

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
spotlight flashlight style but you know

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.069 
spotlight flashlight style but you know
this<00:02:38.609> is<00:02:38.849> the<00:02:39.150> reason<00:02:39.420> why<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.569> chose<00:02:39.840> this

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
this is the reason why I chose this

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:41.869 
this is the reason why I chose this
particular<00:02:40.650> light<00:02:40.859> besides<00:02:41.370> obviously<00:02:41.549> the

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 
particular light besides obviously the

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:43.729 
particular light besides obviously the
pricing<00:02:42.329> it's<00:02:42.750> just<00:02:42.989> because<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.500> know<00:02:43.590> the

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
pricing it's just because you know the

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.220 
pricing it's just because you know the
magnetic<00:02:44.040> base<00:02:44.310> gives<00:02:44.700> you<00:02:44.909> that<00:02:45.510> uh<00:02:45.540> you<00:02:46.139> know

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
magnetic base gives you that uh you know

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.869 
magnetic base gives you that uh you know
that<00:02:46.409> other<00:02:46.530> option<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.099> if<00:02:47.340> you<00:02:47.459> needed<00:02:47.760> to

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:47.879 
that other option that if you needed to

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:50.240 
that other option that if you needed to
you<00:02:48.750> know<00:02:48.810> fix<00:02:49.260> it<00:02:49.409> to<00:02:49.530> something<00:02:49.950> you<00:02:50.189> know

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
you know fix it to something you know

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:52.220 
you know fix it to something you know
whether<00:02:50.700> it's<00:02:50.909> sitting<00:02:51.269> up<00:02:51.419> or<00:02:51.750> on<00:02:51.870> its<00:02:51.989> side

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
whether it's sitting up or on its side

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.539 
whether it's sitting up or on its side
or<00:02:52.260> upside<00:02:52.769> down<00:02:52.950> or<00:02:53.159> something<00:02:53.310> like<00:02:53.489> that

00:02:53.539 --> 00:02:53.549 
or upside down or something like that

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.330 
or upside down or something like that
that<00:02:53.909> would<00:02:54.209> work<00:02:54.239> and<00:02:54.659> then<00:02:55.139> also<00:02:55.889> because<00:02:56.250> of

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
that would work and then also because of

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.530 
that would work and then also because of
the<00:02:56.459> clip<00:02:56.760> you<00:02:56.970> know<00:02:57.030> it<00:02:57.180> gives<00:02:57.329> you<00:02:57.389> that

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
the clip you know it gives you that

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:59.599 
the clip you know it gives you that
hands-free<00:02:58.079> usage<00:02:58.620> where<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.189> can<00:02:59.310> clip<00:02:59.489> it

00:02:59.599 --> 00:02:59.609 
hands-free usage where you can clip it

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:02.059 
hands-free usage where you can clip it
onto<00:02:59.730> your<00:02:59.879> shirt<00:03:00.379> maybe<00:03:01.379> you<00:03:01.530> can<00:03:01.709> clip<00:03:01.950> it

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
onto your shirt maybe you can clip it

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.280 
onto your shirt maybe you can clip it
onto<00:03:02.189> a<00:03:02.370> ball<00:03:03.090> cap<00:03:03.359> and<00:03:03.389> shine<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.139> light

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
onto a ball cap and shine the light

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.569 
onto a ball cap and shine the light
straight<00:03:04.590> down<00:03:04.799> or<00:03:04.829> something<00:03:05.219> like<00:03:05.280> that<00:03:05.340> you

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
straight down or something like that you

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:06.530 
straight down or something like that you
know<00:03:05.669> so<00:03:05.819> it<00:03:05.879> just<00:03:05.939> gives<00:03:06.299> you<00:03:06.389> different

anything like that it's just you know to
kind<00:03:15.150> of<00:03:15.209> light<00:03:15.450> something<00:03:15.689> around<00:03:16.129> and<00:03:17.129> just

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
kind of light something around and just

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.339 
kind of light something around and just
you<00:03:17.639> know<00:03:17.760> it's<00:03:18.060> got<00:03:18.239> a<00:03:18.269> pretty<00:03:18.720> good<00:03:18.900> 35

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:19.349 
you know it's got a pretty good 35

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:21.530 
you know it's got a pretty good 35
lumens<00:03:19.739> you<00:03:19.889> know<00:03:19.979> you<00:03:20.040> just<00:03:20.329> it's<00:03:21.329> just

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
lumens you know you just it's just

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.559 
lumens you know you just it's just
enough<00:03:21.840> to<00:03:22.019> to<00:03:22.470> do<00:03:22.620> everyday<00:03:22.919> tasks<00:03:23.430> so<00:03:23.639> that's

00:03:24.559 --> 00:03:24.569 
enough to to do everyday tasks so that's

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:27.289 
enough to to do everyday tasks so that's
that<00:03:24.840> one<00:03:25.109> the<00:03:25.620> size<00:03:26.129> of<00:03:26.340> it<00:03:26.459> I<00:03:26.699> would<00:03:27.180> probably

00:03:27.289 --> 00:03:27.299 
that one the size of it I would probably

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.649 
that one the size of it I would probably
say<00:03:27.720> it's<00:03:27.900> about<00:03:28.049> the<00:03:28.199> size<00:03:28.560> of<00:03:28.590> a<00:03:29.659> stream

00:03:30.649 --> 00:03:30.659 
say it's about the size of a stream

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:32.449 
say it's about the size of a stream
light<00:03:30.870> micro<00:03:31.260> stream<00:03:31.560> if<00:03:31.889> you<00:03:32.010> guys<00:03:32.159> know<00:03:32.310> what

00:03:32.449 --> 00:03:32.459 
light micro stream if you guys know what

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:34.280 
light micro stream if you guys know what
that<00:03:32.489> looks<00:03:32.790> like<00:03:32.939> kind<00:03:33.510> of<00:03:33.659> size<00:03:33.840> and<00:03:34.139> width

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
that looks like kind of size and width

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.750 
that looks like kind of size and width
and<00:03:34.319> everything<00:03:34.919> you<00:03:35.370> know<00:03:35.459> that's<00:03:35.639> pretty

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
and everything you know that's pretty

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.580 
and everything you know that's pretty
much<00:03:35.970> what<00:03:36.479> I<00:03:36.510> would<00:03:36.720> compare<00:03:37.049> it<00:03:37.109> to<00:03:37.349> so

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
much what I would compare it to so

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.339 
much what I would compare it to so
that's<00:03:37.979> that<00:03:38.310> the<00:03:39.060> other<00:03:39.209> one<00:03:39.359> is<00:03:39.959> this<00:03:40.169> one

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
that's that the other one is this one

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:41.689 
that's that the other one is this one
right<00:03:40.439> here<00:03:40.500> it's<00:03:40.979> a<00:03:41.069> little<00:03:41.250> bit<00:03:41.370> bigger<00:03:41.549> as

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
right here it's a little bit bigger as

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.789 
right here it's a little bit bigger as
you<00:03:41.760> guys<00:03:42.000> can<00:03:42.150> see<00:03:42.209> it's<00:03:42.599> made<00:03:43.049> my<00:03:43.229> Remington

aluminum<00:04:16.590> body<00:04:16.799> on<00:04:17.070> there<00:04:17.340> so<00:04:17.639> this<00:04:18.539> actually

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
aluminum body on there so this actually

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.469 
aluminum body on there so this actually
runs<00:04:19.139> on<00:04:19.349> three<00:04:19.769> Triple<00:04:20.250> A<00:04:20.340> batteries<00:04:20.370> so<00:04:21.269> the

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
runs on three Triple A batteries so the

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:22.909 
runs on three Triple A batteries so the
cool<00:04:21.630> thing<00:04:21.780> about<00:04:21.840> both<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.199> these<00:04:22.440> lights<00:04:22.710> is

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:22.919 
cool thing about both of these lights is

00:04:22.919 --> 00:04:24.409 
cool thing about both of these lights is
that<00:04:22.950> you<00:04:23.219> know<00:04:23.310> the<00:04:23.430> batteries<00:04:23.820> are<00:04:24.000> readily

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
that you know the batteries are readily

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:26.629 
that you know the batteries are readily
accessible<00:04:24.690> it's<00:04:25.139> not<00:04:25.260> like<00:04:25.409> a<00:04:25.440> 1<00:04:25.650> 2<00:04:25.770> 3<00:04:25.800> or<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.400> D

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
accessible it's not like a 1 2 3 or a D

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:27.860 
accessible it's not like a 1 2 3 or a D
or<00:04:26.669> a<00:04:26.880> seer<00:04:27.120> and<00:04:27.330> it<00:04:27.389> can<00:04:27.479> like<00:04:27.630> that

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:27.870 
or a seer and it can like that

00:04:27.870 --> 00:04:29.540 
or a seer and it can like that
so<00:04:27.990> it's<00:04:28.110> pretty<00:04:28.229> cool<00:04:28.470> obviously<00:04:29.070> as<00:04:29.460> you
