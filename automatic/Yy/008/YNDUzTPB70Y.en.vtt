00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.120
 Today we tackle the Susatti via ferrata to reach Cima Capi, on Lake Garda. 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.540
 We park the car in Biacesa in Val di Ledro 

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.880
 and we walk along the path 470. 

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:33.160
 The approach path is characterized by the presence of numerous sections 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:40.400
 sometimes also exposed and numerous extremely panoramic views of both the Val di Ledro and Lake Garda. 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:59.840
 Arrived at a convenient panoramic area, 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.380
 we take the opportunity to harness and equip ourselves. 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 We continue along the path passing in front of the remains of a trench of the First World War. 

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:25.580
 As we continue to climb, we find increasingly scenic spots, until we reach the signs for path 405. 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:42.920
 The via ferrata continues to move from the slope that overlooks the Valle di Ledro and the one that overlooks Lake Garda, 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.420
 always giving breathtaking views. 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.400
 From a technical point of view, the via ferrata does not have particularly difficult passages. 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.900
 However, a particularly exposed passage should be pointed out, the one you see now in the images. 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.440
 And here and there the narrow passages where to overcome them you have to strive a little. 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.180
 At the top, we find the flag and the summit book. 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.440
 We are going to go down. 

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.720
 We continue along the path until we find the cable again 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:58.940
 and subsequently of narrow and particularly exposed paths. 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:26.180
 At the sign we continue inside the trench until we find the cable again, 

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:29.640
 that will take us to the second piece of the ferrata for the return. 

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.600
 This second section is not particularly demanding, 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.540
 but sometimes presents passages that must be faced downhill, 

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.260
 which makes these passages extremely uncomfortable. 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:08.740
 Once the cable is finished, we continue into the woods until we reach the SAT bivouac 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:11.340
 that for our misfortune it was closed. 

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.900
 After a brief restorative pause, we continue with the path in the woods 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:23.340
 avoiding a second section equipped to return to Biacesa and from there to the car. 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.180
 In conclusion, the via ferrata is not particularly difficult, 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:30.200
 but particularly exposed, 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.820
 excellent exercise for those wishing to get used to the exhibition.
