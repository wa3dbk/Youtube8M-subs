00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:03.810 
alright here's the exercise for gaining

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:07.299 
alright here's the exercise for gaining
separation<00:00:04.470> between<00:00:04.650> between<00:00:05.339> fingers<00:00:05.850> 2<00:00:06.480> &amp;<00:00:06.660> 3

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:07.309 
separation between between fingers 2 &amp; 3

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:10.370 
separation between between fingers 2 &amp; 3
the<00:00:08.309> problem<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:08.960> what<00:00:09.960> a<00:00:09.990> lot<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.200> people

practice<00:00:18.720> for<00:00:18.900> guitar<00:00:19.289> what<00:00:20.160> happens<00:00:20.609> is<00:00:20.760> that

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
practice for guitar what happens is that

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.390 
practice for guitar what happens is that
when<00:00:21.689> they<00:00:21.869> put<00:00:22.140> down<00:00:22.350> 2nd<00:00:22.949> finger<00:00:23.100> if<00:00:23.310> they

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
when they put down 2nd finger if they

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.060 
when they put down 2nd finger if they
play<00:00:23.609> one<00:00:23.880> two<00:00:24.240> third<00:00:24.720> finger<00:00:25.109> always<00:00:25.800> comes

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
play one two third finger always comes

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.580 
play one two third finger always comes
over<00:00:26.369> like<00:00:26.519> that<00:00:26.820> which<00:00:27.320> definitely<00:00:28.320> will

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
over like that which definitely will

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.740 
over like that which definitely will
cripple<00:00:28.800> your<00:00:29.039> playing<00:00:29.400> and<00:00:29.760> it's<00:00:30.330> very<00:00:30.480> hard

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
cripple your playing and it's very hard

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.089 
cripple your playing and it's very hard
to<00:00:30.869> get<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.199> separation<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:31.980> its

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
to get this separation and its

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.400 
to get this separation and its
independence<00:00:32.399> between<00:00:33.149> fingers<00:00:33.570> 2<00:00:33.780> &amp;<00:00:33.960> 3<00:00:34.370> a<00:00:36.410> lot

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
independence between fingers 2 &amp; 3 a lot

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.319 
independence between fingers 2 &amp; 3 a lot
of<00:00:37.559> times<00:00:37.770> people<00:00:38.010> no<00:00:38.250> matter<00:00:38.370> how<00:00:38.940> hard<00:00:39.210> they

of times people no matter how hard they

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.200 
of times people no matter how hard they
try<00:00:39.660> when<00:00:39.930> they<00:00:40.050> go<00:00:40.200> across<00:00:40.469> it<00:00:40.770> 1<00:00:40.950> &amp;<00:00:41.129> 2<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.969> 3

try when they go across it 1 &amp; 2 the 3

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.209 
try when they go across it 1 &amp; 2 the 3
always<00:00:42.480> comes<00:00:42.690> over<00:00:43.020> this<00:00:43.350> technique<00:00:43.829> will

00:00:44.209 --> 00:00:44.219 
always comes over this technique will

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:46.760 
always comes over this technique will
solve<00:00:44.550> that<00:00:44.670> problem<00:00:45.090> for<00:00:45.120> you<00:00:45.559> so<00:00:46.559> what<00:00:46.739> you

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
solve that problem for you so what you

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:51.319 
solve that problem for you so what you
do<00:00:46.980> is<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.340> you<00:00:48.200> put<00:00:49.200> one<00:00:49.379> down<00:00:50.180> at<00:00:51.180> the

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
do is this you put one down at the

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:53.660 
do is this you put one down at the
proper<00:00:51.629> hand<00:00:51.870> position<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.379> course<00:00:52.670> curvature

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
proper hand position of course curvature

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.900 
proper hand position of course curvature
in<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:53.850> joints<00:00:54.440> you<00:00:55.440> play<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:55.980> now<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.460> don't

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
in the joints you play one now you don't

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.939 
in the joints you play one now you don't
play<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.300> immediately<00:00:58.020> what<00:00:58.350> you<00:00:58.500> do<00:00:58.680> is<00:00:58.800> you

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
play to immediately what you do is you

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.580 
play to immediately what you do is you
touch<00:00:59.219> three<00:00:59.670> to<00:00:59.940> the<00:01:00.059> string<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.899> activates

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:01.590 
touch three to the string that activates

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.439 
touch three to the string that activates
the<00:01:01.710> muscles<00:01:01.949> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> hand<00:01:02.879> here

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
the muscles in the hand here

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:06.200 
the muscles in the hand here
that<00:01:04.110> control<00:01:04.500> the<00:01:04.680> third<00:01:04.890> finger<00:01:05.189> it<00:01:05.850> gets<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
that control the third finger it gets it

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.910 
that control the third finger it gets it
out<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.450> the<00:01:06.659> way<00:01:06.810> and<00:01:07.049> then<00:01:07.320> you<00:01:07.350> activate

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
out of the way and then you activate

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.510 
out of the way and then you activate
finger<00:01:08.729> two<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.299> put<00:01:09.540> it<00:01:09.659> down<00:01:09.869> then<00:01:10.619> slowly

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
finger two and put it down then slowly

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.109 
finger two and put it down then slowly
release<00:01:12.360> three<00:01:13.080> and<00:01:13.350> play<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.920> two<00:01:14.250> now<00:01:14.939> when

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
release three and play that two now when

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:17.690 
release three and play that two now when
you<00:01:15.240> go<00:01:15.390> to<00:01:15.450> the<00:01:15.689> next<00:01:15.960> string<00:01:16.200> you<00:01:17.040> lead<00:01:17.490> with

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
you go to the next string you lead with

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.210 
you go to the next string you lead with
one<00:01:17.939> but<00:01:18.630> you<00:01:18.750> keep<00:01:19.020> three<00:01:19.350> touching<00:01:19.890> that's

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
one but you keep three touching that's

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.270 
one but you keep three touching that's
six<00:01:20.670> string<00:01:21.320> lightly<00:01:22.320> and<00:01:22.530> even<00:01:22.830> as<00:01:22.920> two<00:01:23.100> goes

three<00:01:34.049> still<00:01:34.320> on<00:01:34.500> that<00:01:34.680> string<00:01:35.009> then<00:01:35.460> you<00:01:35.490> will

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
three still on that string then you will

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.910 
three still on that string then you will
move<00:01:36.030> three<00:01:36.329> over<00:01:36.630> no<00:01:36.930> pressure<00:01:37.290> just<00:01:37.650> lightly

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
move three over no pressure just lightly

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:41.990 
move three over no pressure just lightly
touching<00:01:38.520> the<00:01:38.640> string<00:01:39.000> then<00:01:39.990> move<00:01:40.500> your<00:01:40.530> 1<00:01:41.000> and

touching the string then move your 1 and

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.710 
touching the string then move your 1 and
repeat<00:01:42.780> your<00:01:43.020> 1<00:01:43.470> 2<00:01:43.500> pattern<00:01:44.159> here<00:01:44.520> put<00:01:45.420> 3<00:01:45.689> on

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
repeat your 1 2 pattern here put 3 on

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:48.260 
repeat your 1 2 pattern here put 3 on
the<00:01:45.960> string<00:01:46.170> like<00:01:46.350> that<00:01:46.619> and<00:01:47.000> then<00:01:48.000> continue

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
the string like that and then continue

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.569 
the string like that and then continue
over<00:01:49.520> like<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:51.500> always<00:01:52.500> keeping<00:01:53.220> free

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
over like that always keeping free

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.450 
over like that always keeping free
lightly<00:01:54.060> touching<00:01:54.659> DJ<00:01:55.649> some<00:01:55.890> string<00:01:56.189> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460 
lightly touching DJ some string and

00:01:56.460 --> 00:01:58.819 
lightly touching DJ some string and
that'll<00:01:57.000> keep<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.450> separation<00:01:58.229> of<00:01:58.320> one<00:01:58.469> force

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
that'll keep the separation of one force

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.819 
that'll keep the separation of one force
this<00:01:59.130> separation<00:01:59.869> now<00:02:00.930> you<00:02:01.200> may<00:02:01.350> experience<00:02:01.619> a

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
this separation now you may experience a

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.410 
this separation now you may experience a
lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> tension<00:02:02.490> because<00:02:02.610> of<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.060> muscles

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
lot of tension because of the muscles

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.990 
lot of tension because of the muscles
are<00:02:03.540> not<00:02:03.659> used<00:02:03.899> to<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:04.079> then<00:02:04.829> they're<00:02:05.759> going<00:02:05.939> to

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
are not used to it then they're going to

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.770 
are not used to it then they're going to
react<00:02:06.240> like<00:02:06.329> that

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
react like that

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.889 
react like that
but<00:02:07.229> you<00:02:07.799> keep<00:02:08.009> up<00:02:08.160> with<00:02:08.190> this<00:02:08.429> and<00:02:08.700> then<00:02:08.879> you

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:10.899 
but you keep up with this and then you

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:13.470 
but you keep up with this and then you
do<00:02:11.560> this<00:02:11.769> along<00:02:12.430> with<00:02:12.489> a<00:02:12.670> basic<00:02:13.060> practice

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
do this along with a basic practice

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.320 
do this along with a basic practice
approach<00:02:13.840> from<00:02:14.590> the<00:02:14.769> principles<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.970> build<00:02:16.180> up

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
approach from the principles to build up

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.110 
approach from the principles to build up
the<00:02:16.540> tempo<00:02:16.870> very<00:02:17.230> very<00:02:17.409> gradually<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.310> you

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the tempo very very gradually and you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.479 
the tempo very very gradually and you
will<00:02:19.510> get<00:02:19.810> a<00:02:19.840> nice<00:02:20.940> separation<00:02:21.940> between<00:02:23.129> 1<00:02:24.129> 2

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:24.489 
will get a nice separation between 1 2

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:27.360 
will get a nice separation between 1 2
or<00:02:24.730> between<00:02:24.970> 2<00:02:25.330> &amp;<00:02:25.480> 3<00:02:25.540> when<00:02:26.290> you<00:02:26.470> play<00:02:26.680> 2<00:02:27.220> and

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
or between 2 &amp; 3 when you play 2 and

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.009 
or between 2 &amp; 3 when you play 2 and
Korea<00:02:27.549> are<00:02:27.610> always<00:02:27.879> problematic<00:02:28.450> it's<00:02:28.810> just

00:02:29.009 --> 00:02:29.019 
Korea are always problematic it's just

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.430 
Korea are always problematic it's just
the<00:02:29.470> nature<00:02:29.650> of<00:02:29.799> the<00:02:29.920> anatomy<00:02:30.519> but<00:02:31.260> this<00:02:32.260> will

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
the nature of the anatomy but this will

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.440 
the nature of the anatomy but this will
go<00:02:32.560> a<00:02:32.590> long<00:02:32.950> way<00:02:33.190> toward<00:02:33.790> giving<00:02:33.909> you<00:02:34.239> the

go a long way toward giving you the

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:37.920 
go a long way toward giving you the
independent<00:02:35.200> control<00:02:35.709> that<00:02:36.610> you<00:02:36.879> need<00:02:37.090> in

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
independent control that you need in

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.680 
independent control that you need in
playing<00:02:38.349> guitar
