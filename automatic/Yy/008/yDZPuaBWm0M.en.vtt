because<00:01:56.219> there's<00:01:56.369> plenty<00:01:56.610> of<00:01:56.640> room<00:01:56.820> on<00:01:57.030> a

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
because there's plenty of room on a

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.569 
because there's plenty of room on a
motorcycle<00:01:57.329> that's<00:01:57.750> not<00:01:57.930> so<00:01:58.110> easy<00:01:58.399> that's<00:01:59.399> why

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
motorcycle that's not so easy that's why

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.039 
motorcycle that's not so easy that's why
I<00:01:59.610> have<00:01:59.790> the<00:01:59.909> battery<00:02:00.240> slit<00:02:00.540> out<00:02:00.659> like<00:02:00.840> this

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
I have the battery slit out like this

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.080 
I have the battery slit out like this
but<00:02:01.460> connecting<00:02:02.460> my<00:02:02.579> lead

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
but connecting my lead

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.060 
but connecting my lead
se<00:02:03.329> here<00:02:03.719> or<00:02:03.930> to<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.320> bolt<00:02:04.649> it's<00:02:04.890> not

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
se here or to this bolt it's not

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.590 
se here or to this bolt it's not
connecting<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.579> directly<00:02:05.880> to<00:02:06.060> the<00:02:06.180> post<00:02:06.420> you

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
connecting it directly to the post you

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.580 
connecting it directly to the post you
want<00:02:06.869> it<00:02:06.990> directly<00:02:07.409> to<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:08.039> battery<00:02:08.429> post<00:02:08.910> so

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
want it directly to the battery post so

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:19.750 
want it directly to the battery post so
connect<00:02:10.590> your<00:02:10.739> meter<00:02:11.039> leads

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.690 

so<00:02:20.760> now<00:02:20.879> I'm<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.269> turn<00:02:21.689> the<00:02:21.840> bike<00:02:22.019> on<00:02:22.290> and

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
so now I'm going to turn the bike on and

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:25.699 
so now I'm going to turn the bike on and
turn<00:02:23.700> the<00:02:23.849> engine<00:02:24.150> over<00:02:24.269> it's<00:02:25.049> important<00:02:25.560> that

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
turn the engine over it's important that

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.589 
turn the engine over it's important that
when<00:02:25.829> you<00:02:25.980> crank<00:02:26.370> the<00:02:26.489> engine<00:02:26.819> never<00:02:27.120> crank<00:02:27.480> it

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:27.599 
when you crank the engine never crank it

00:02:27.599 --> 00:02:30.890 
when you crank the engine never crank it
longer<00:02:27.870> than<00:02:27.989> 15<00:02:28.379> seconds<00:02:28.859> and<00:02:29.450> for<00:02:30.450> this<00:02:30.599> test

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
longer than 15 seconds and for this test

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.240 
longer than 15 seconds and for this test
I'm<00:02:31.230> probably<00:02:31.409> going<00:02:31.590> to<00:02:31.650> crank<00:02:31.920> it<00:02:32.040> for<00:02:32.069> about

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
I'm probably going to crank it for about

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.410 
I'm probably going to crank it for about
4<00:02:32.640> seconds<00:02:33.180> and<00:02:33.329> then<00:02:34.079> record<00:02:34.560> my<00:02:35.420> voltage

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
4 seconds and then record my voltage

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:49.009 
4 seconds and then record my voltage
reading<00:02:37.549> on<00:02:38.549> my<00:02:39.239> battery<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:48.750> I'm<00:02:48.840> getting

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:49.019 
reading on my battery so I'm getting

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:50.780 
reading on my battery so I'm getting

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:26.600 
so it's about nine point nine point

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:35.740 
so it's about nine point nine point

battery in the voltage you measured at
the<00:04:38.960> starter<00:04:39.470> is<00:04:39.650> less<00:04:40.010> than<00:04:40.220> 1<00:04:40.460> volt<00:04:40.700> then

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:41.690 
the starter is less than 1 volt then

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:44.020 
the starter is less than 1 volt then
you're<00:04:42.040> then<00:04:43.040> you<00:04:43.070> don't<00:04:43.340> have<00:04:43.520> excessive
