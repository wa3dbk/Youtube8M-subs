 welcome to the new video tutorial of photography 

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:13.959
 let's do a series of tutorials 

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:17.109
 colomo photoshop cs5 

00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:19.589
 a version b 

00:00:19.589 --> 00:00:23.729
 which has lent us to adobe before lundbeck final release 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.939
 This trial version can bring you oaks - not the definitive version 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.270
 developing the workspace 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.810
 work views 

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:41.570
 that if the monitor screen sa 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.640
 both the program 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.770
 we have several walls changes entradón see 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.410
 several things 

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.090
 one of them is that we can 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.760
 see the image with the corp software 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.260
 an image window 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.170
 this 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.170
 3 we have now 

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:02.460
 like any other application 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.460
 if we can also see it 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:10.410
 he always looked 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:14.770
 the upper floor 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:18.020
 in exchange for it apart from the changes between the peoples 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.440
 the celtics on how the chest after the mini brics 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.530
 We have recently made and the coves 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.530
 we also have then a redesign of all and elbows 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.050
 bernardo knew children's products with a little 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:40.330
 ansa ma this new idea of ​​what its power much work to do 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.730
 all teen icons 

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.490
 a little bit of 3d format 

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.390
 3d basic that the bowls 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.440
 as novelties the work space of the garaventa garaventa mujer disappear 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:55.110
 3d tools 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:56.610
 join the city 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.610
 they are part of the joint 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.840
 first part on the right side we do not understand 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.840
 a few new plants such as the minimum said 

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:11.290
 well we will speak perfectly more in a next 

00:02:12.469 --> 00:02:15.469
 and victory since these bring many many novelties 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:22.020
 we also want the culé - in just two calculates lion hercules 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:23.630
 is an application 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.139
 to blame 

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:26.079
 I'm better 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.449
 none stop color path but for 

00:02:28.449 --> 00:02:32.299
 make color combinations by then two precise combinations 

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.739
 that designed or as they say appropriates 

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:40.289
 our own combination 

00:02:40.289 --> 00:02:42.279
 it's quite interesting 

00:02:42.279 --> 00:02:45.999
 mickeal she is available digital for eight without having to open 

00:02:47.499 --> 00:02:49.450
 other options as an example 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.450
 the target watermark panel while defining 

00:02:53.289 --> 00:02:55.309
 decent novels 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.489
 but with respect to the workspace 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.250
 the most interesting 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.930
 we have found it very attractive is the possibility of gaining confidence 

00:03:05.869 --> 00:03:07.519
 disconnect 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.439
 10 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:12.289
 place it 

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:15.289
 at the bottom of the monitor 

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:18.389
 position 

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:20.959
 its dimensions also 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:26.229
 we can have pallets question apart lower no longer just the right 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.409
 will help a lot because people work widescreen 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.659
 several monitors 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:38.659
 after all this the bottom 

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.769
 nicolás castro 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.189
 but little by little 

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:48.489
 but this new work space has been sought and two of the producers do 

00:03:49.469 --> 00:03:52.469
 tutorials about photoshop cs5 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:57.650
