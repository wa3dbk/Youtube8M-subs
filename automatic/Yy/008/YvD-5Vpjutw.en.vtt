a<00:00:34.610> PDW<00:00:35.000> in<00:00:35.540> gold<00:00:36.160> but<00:00:37.160> I<00:00:37.520> couldn't<00:00:37.970> get<00:00:38.120> for<00:00:38.300> the

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
a PDW in gold but I couldn't get for the

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.460 
a PDW in gold but I couldn't get for the
life<00:00:38.540> of<00:00:38.720> me<00:00:38.780> I<00:00:38.870> don't<00:00:38.990> know<00:00:39.170> what<00:00:39.320> they've

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:39.470 
life of me I don't know what they've

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.780 
life of me I don't know what they've
done<00:00:39.620> to<00:00:39.680> the<00:00:39.890> gun<00:00:40.040> i<00:00:40.070> think<00:00:40.340> i<00:00:40.460> think<00:00:40.490> they've

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:40.790 
done to the gun i think i think they've

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.550 
done to the gun i think i think they've
changed<00:00:41.030> it<00:00:41.240> to<00:00:41.390> be<00:00:41.480> honest<00:00:41.690> with<00:00:41.810> y'all<00:00:42.020> I'm

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:42.560 
changed it to be honest with y'all I'm

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.600 
changed it to be honest with y'all I'm
some<00:00:43.010> I'm<00:00:43.850> assuming<00:00:44.360> they've<00:00:44.480> changed<00:00:44.720> it<00:00:45.610> but

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:46.610 
some I'm assuming they've changed it but

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:47.710 
some I'm assuming they've changed it but
anyway<00:00:46.910> now<00:00:47.090> they<00:00:47.210> haven't<00:00:47.330> really<00:00:47.480> changed

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:47.720 
anyway now they haven't really changed

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.920 
anyway now they haven't really changed
it<00:00:47.960> but<00:00:48.080> I<00:00:48.350> had<00:00:49.280> this<00:00:49.460> gameplay<00:00:49.730> and<00:00:50.660> it<00:00:50.840> was

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:50.930 
it but I had this gameplay and it was

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:52.570 
it but I had this gameplay and it was
fairly<00:00:51.170> decent<00:00:51.650> so<00:00:51.800> I<00:00:51.860> thought<00:00:52.010> I<00:00:52.070> thought

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:52.580 
fairly decent so I thought I thought

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:54.640 
fairly decent so I thought I thought
would<00:00:52.640> use<00:00:52.820> this<00:00:52.970> one<00:00:53.150> over<00:00:53.450> it<00:00:53.540> and<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.500> just

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:54.650 
would use this one over it and it's just

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:56.500 
would use this one over it and it's just
me<00:00:54.830> me<00:00:55.370> I'm<00:00:55.550> keeping<00:00:55.880> you<00:00:55.940> up<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.060> date<00:00:56.180> was

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.370 
doing cuz I did say I was going to be
going<00:00:57.980> from<00:00:58.250> diamond<00:00:59.210> camo<00:00:59.420> on<00:00:59.600> the<00:01:00.110> on<00:01:00.320> the

anyway the first the first their way

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:51.250 
anyway the first the first their way
that<00:03:49.670> I'd<00:03:50.030> like<00:03:50.239> to<00:03:50.450> use<00:03:50.660> it<00:03:50.810> is<00:03:50.930> the<00:03:51.050> way<00:03:51.170> i'm

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:51.260 
that I'd like to use it is the way i'm

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.710 
that I'd like to use it is the way i'm
using<00:03:51.530> it<00:03:51.620> now<00:03:51.650> fast<00:03:52.610> mag<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.030> suppressor<00:03:53.569> and

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:53.720 
using it now fast mag and suppressor and

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:55.780 
using it now fast mag and suppressor and
then<00:03:54.230> sometimes<00:03:54.739> it<00:03:54.920> feels<00:03:55.130> like<00:03:55.280> it's<00:03:55.670> not

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
then sometimes it feels like it's not

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.210 
then sometimes it feels like it's not
quite<00:03:56.270> as<00:03:56.840> good<00:03:57.080> and<00:03:57.380> then<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.620> go<00:03:57.890> and<00:03:57.920> use

00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:58.220 
quite as good and then you go and use

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:00.100 
quite as good and then you go and use
the<00:03:58.459> wrecked<00:03:58.670> I'll<00:03:58.880> site<00:03:59.180> as<00:03:59.390> in<00:03:59.569> red<00:03:59.900> dot

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
sight red dot sight and fast mag which

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:05.830 
sight red dot sight and fast mag which
is<00:04:04.370> also<00:04:04.580> a<00:04:04.760> good<00:04:04.880> way<00:04:04.940> to<00:04:05.090> use<00:04:05.209> it<00:04:05.330> as<00:04:05.510> I<00:04:05.630> said

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840 
is also a good way to use it as I said

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.620 
is also a good way to use it as I said
fast<00:04:06.110> mag<00:04:06.349> is<00:04:06.560> is<00:04:06.800> a<00:04:06.860> mosque<00:04:07.220> them<00:04:07.519> just<00:04:08.510> for

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:08.630 
fast mag is is a mosque them just for

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:10.420 
fast mag is is a mosque them just for
the<00:04:08.720> fact<00:04:08.870> that<00:04:09.019> slow<00:04:09.380> real<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:09.769> i'm<00:04:09.980> not<00:04:10.040> sure

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:10.430 
the fact that slow real and i'm not sure

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:13.270 
the fact that slow real and i'm not sure
if<00:04:10.610> you<00:04:10.700> can<00:04:10.819> get<00:04:10.940> extended<00:04:11.360> clip<00:04:11.780> which<00:04:12.280> would

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.280 
if you can get extended clip which would

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.990 
if you can get extended clip which would
sort<00:04:13.519> of<00:04:13.670> make<00:04:14.510> up<00:04:14.750> for<00:04:15.250> having<00:04:16.250> more<00:04:16.459> more

00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.000 
sort of make up for having more more

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.789 
sort of make up for having more more
bullets<00:04:17.299> II<00:04:17.419> won't<00:04:17.600> have<00:04:17.750> to<00:04:17.870> reload<00:04:18.260> as<00:04:18.500> much

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
bullets II won't have to reload as much

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:20.740 
bullets II won't have to reload as much
so<00:04:19.040> maybe<00:04:19.310> extended<00:04:20.120> clips<00:04:20.329> with<00:04:20.479> something

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750 
so maybe extended clips with something

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.250 
so maybe extended clips with something
else<00:04:22.120> haven't<00:04:23.120> really<00:04:23.270> tried<00:04:23.510> out<00:04:23.690> too<00:04:24.050> many

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
else haven't really tried out too many

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:25.810 
else haven't really tried out too many
other<00:04:24.440> ones<00:04:24.650> because<00:04:25.040> i<00:04:25.130> always<00:04:25.310> used<00:04:25.610> fast

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:25.820 
other ones because i always used fast

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.940 
other ones because i always used fast
mag<00:04:26.060> i<00:04:26.300> always<00:04:26.900> have<00:04:27.050> a<00:04:27.080> habit<00:04:27.290> of<00:04:27.440> reloading

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:27.950 
mag i always have a habit of reloading

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:29.710 
mag i always have a habit of reloading
after<00:04:28.400> every<00:04:28.669> kill<00:04:28.880> if<00:04:29.000> you<00:04:29.090> watch<00:04:29.270> most<00:04:29.510> of<00:04:29.600> my

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:29.720 
after every kill if you watch most of my

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.600 
after every kill if you watch most of my
gameplays<00:04:30.169> most<00:04:30.470> of<00:04:30.710> the<00:04:30.800> time<00:04:31.010> i<00:04:31.040> reload

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:31.610 
gameplays most of the time i reload

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.290 
gameplays most of the time i reload
virtually<00:04:32.210> after<00:04:32.450> every<00:04:32.780> kill<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:34.010> i<00:04:34.340> was

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.300 
virtually after every kill you i was

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.760 
virtually after every kill you i was
just<00:04:35.360> fine<00:04:35.660> apart<00:04:36.020> now<00:04:36.229> where<00:04:36.470> I<00:04:36.500> do<00:04:36.590> actually

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
just fine apart now where I do actually

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:40.810 
just fine apart now where I do actually
get<00:04:37.130> killing<00:04:37.430> not<00:04:37.700> dying<00:04:38.590> but<00:04:39.590> literally<00:04:40.520> I'll

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:40.820 
get killing not dying but literally I'll

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:42.640 
get killing not dying but literally I'll
get<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.120> kill<00:04:41.330> reload<00:04:41.810> I<00:04:41.840> think<00:04:42.350> it's<00:04:42.470> just

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:42.650 
get the kill reload I think it's just

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:45.010 
get the kill reload I think it's just
the<00:04:42.710> habit<00:04:43.070> of<00:04:43.130> doing<00:04:43.460> it<00:04:43.610> get<00:04:44.510> the<00:04:44.600> kill<00:04:44.810> their

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:45.020 
the habit of doing it get the kill their

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:47.920 
the habit of doing it get the kill their
reload<00:04:45.680> move<00:04:46.640> on<00:04:46.940> get<00:04:47.180> a<00:04:47.240> kill<00:04:47.450> reload<00:04:47.750> and

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:47.930 
reload move on get a kill reload and

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:49.719 
reload move on get a kill reload and
sometimes<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.800> doesn't<00:04:48.830> it<00:04:49.370> doesn't<00:04:49.400> actually

00:04:49.719 --> 00:04:49.729 
sometimes it doesn't it doesn't actually

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:51.909 
sometimes it doesn't it doesn't actually
pay<00:04:50.060> off<00:04:50.210> for<00:04:50.360> me<00:04:50.510> because<00:04:50.810> um<00:04:50.990> because<00:04:51.260> I'm<00:04:51.710> so

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
pay off for me because um because I'm so

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.290 
pay off for me because um because I'm so
used<00:04:51.950> to<00:04:52.310> doing<00:04:52.340> it<00:04:52.640> I'll<00:04:52.700> run<00:04:52.910> into<00:04:53.120> one

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
used to doing it I'll run into one

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.090 
used to doing it I'll run into one
person<00:04:53.750> then<00:04:53.900> i'll<00:04:54.020> go<00:04:54.050> into<00:04:54.320> reloading<00:04:54.919> like

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:55.100 
person then i'll go into reloading like

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:58.690 
person then i'll go into reloading like
here<00:04:56.350> and<00:04:57.350> then<00:04:57.950> someone<00:04:58.250> will<00:04:58.310> pick<00:04:58.460> me<00:04:58.610> off

00:04:58.690 --> 00:04:58.700 
here and then someone will pick me off

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:01.510 
here and then someone will pick me off
as<00:04:58.970> i'm<00:04:59.150> reloading<00:04:59.630> so<00:04:59.950> don't<00:05:00.950> use<00:05:01.190> that<00:05:01.220> as<00:05:01.490> a

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 
as i'm reloading so don't use that as a

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.850 
as i'm reloading so don't use that as a
tip<00:05:01.850> and<00:05:02.120> that's<00:05:02.330> just<00:05:02.419> me<00:05:02.840> and<00:05:03.169> how<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.440> play

00:05:03.850 --> 00:05:03.860 
tip and that's just me and how I play

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.310 
tip and that's just me and how I play
them<00:05:04.190> it's<00:05:04.910> not<00:05:05.000> the<00:05:05.150> best<00:05:05.330> of<00:05:05.570> tips<00:05:05.810> I<00:05:05.960> suppose

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:06.320 
them it's not the best of tips I suppose

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:08.740 
them it's not the best of tips I suppose
but<00:05:06.560> I<00:05:06.830> suppose<00:05:07.760> it<00:05:07.940> means<00:05:08.090> you<00:05:08.390> don't<00:05:08.600> get

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.750 
but I suppose it means you don't get

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.050 
but I suppose it means you don't get
down<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.140> the<00:05:09.169> point<00:05:09.500> where<00:05:09.650> you've<00:05:09.800> got<00:05:10.060> no

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:11.060 
down to the point where you've got no

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.120 
down to the point where you've got no
ammo<00:05:11.479> and<00:05:11.810> you<00:05:11.930> like<00:05:12.110> you're<00:05:12.590> like<00:05:12.740> shooting

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:13.130 
ammo and you like you're like shooting

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:14.560 
ammo and you like you're like shooting
at<00:05:13.250> someone<00:05:13.460> but<00:05:13.760> you're<00:05:14.030> not<00:05:14.120> doing<00:05:14.419> nothing

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
at someone but you're not doing nothing

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.800 
at someone but you're not doing nothing
but<00:05:15.410> yeah<00:05:16.250> you<00:05:16.940> could<00:05:17.150> use<00:05:17.360> that<00:05:17.479> tip<00:05:17.690> I

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
but yeah you could use that tip I

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.020 
but yeah you could use that tip I
suppose<00:05:18.139> them<00:05:18.440> at<00:05:18.740> least<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.760> know<00:05:19.850> you've

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:20.030 
suppose them at least you know you've

00:05:20.030 --> 00:05:21.400 
suppose them at least you know you've
always<00:05:20.330> got<00:05:20.510> ammo<00:05:20.780> and<00:05:20.960> you're<00:05:21.050> ready<00:05:21.139> to<00:05:21.260> go

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:21.410 
always got ammo and you're ready to go

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:25.300 
always got ammo and you're ready to go
but<00:05:22.340> anyway<00:05:23.350> they're<00:05:24.350> the<00:05:24.470> two<00:05:24.590> best<00:05:24.620> ways<00:05:25.100> I'd

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:25.310 
but anyway they're the two best ways I'd

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:27.279 
but anyway they're the two best ways I'd
use<00:05:25.550> it<00:05:25.580> so<00:05:25.910> I<00:05:26.120> suppose<00:05:26.450> this<00:05:26.600> video's<00:05:26.960> turn

00:05:27.279 --> 00:05:27.289 
use it so I suppose this video's turn

00:05:27.289 --> 00:05:30.430 
use it so I suppose this video's turn
into<00:05:27.650> a<00:05:28.539> o'clock<00:05:29.539> class<00:05:29.840> setup<00:05:30.200> for<00:05:30.380> the

00:05:59.670 --> 00:06:03.340 
em trying to get them in gold then I
think<00:06:00.060> it's<00:06:00.180> just<00:06:00.390> the<00:06:00.450> scorpion<00:06:01.340> which<00:06:02.340> is

00:06:03.340 --> 00:06:03.350 
think it's just the scorpion which is

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:05.720 
think it's just the scorpion which is
fairly<00:06:04.350> good<00:06:04.710> this<00:06:04.860> there's<00:06:05.280> another<00:06:05.490> two

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
fairly good this there's another two

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:08.840 
fairly good this there's another two
ways<00:06:05.970> to<00:06:06.330> use<00:06:07.110> that<00:06:07.350> and<00:06:07.560> that<00:06:07.950> I<00:06:07.980> think<00:06:08.040> worked

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
ways to use that and that I think worked

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.820 
ways to use that and that I think worked
well<00:06:09.210> with<00:06:09.240> that<00:06:09.660> gun<00:06:09.870> but<00:06:10.140> i'll<00:06:10.470> talk<00:06:10.800> more

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830
