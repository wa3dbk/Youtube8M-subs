00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:13.110
 and there folks good beauty in the tutorial 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.480
 today I'm going to teach you how 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.990
 correct the error that all files 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.199
 point z open with the same program 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:24.210
 is this same program can be all 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.789
 open files with a notepad that 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.220
 is most likely to happen in some 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:31.320
 cases with only a media player and will 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.540
 much depends on how the program will 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.290
 open but will always open with the same 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.079
 program 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 and this self is end up leaving many 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:44.399
 frustrated people are and ultimately this uÃ© 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.539
 having to format the computer but 

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.820
 this is a very simple thing of 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.960
 solve 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:51.239
 so I'm going to teach you two today 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.920
 meters in which this can be 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:57.210
 problem 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:01:01.100
 so come on it's that kind of day you can 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:05.489
 be fixed by windows registry 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:07.799
 also by the right command itself 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 But you will not be able to open it. 

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:12.000
 own command 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 nor the registry of windows for causes that 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.720
 will be the whole program knowing is 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.460
 let 's take an example with a notepad 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.060
 on my computer it is all about the 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.060
 blog 9 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.860
 if you are going to open the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.380
 chores you will not get going 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.810
 open the notepad too if you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.070
 I'll open the windows registry, will you? 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
 also will not be able to because 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:36.299
 open the notepad too then I will 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.030
 teach the first method for you who 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.820
 Microsoft 's official method is the 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:44.159
 microsoft makes this link available 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.909
 explaining to you how the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:50.090
 process to correct this error 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:54.590
 You're going to do the following on the keyboard. 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.090
 against the shift + heskey to open the 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.179
 task manager on new file 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:07.189
 task to execute you will tighten the 

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:08.929
 control press and hold 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:12.819
 click on new task 

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:17.120
 so it will open the command itself, right? 

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:19.099
 You will dictate notepad by remembering that 

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.280
 to fix this error only works with 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:24.769
 point and xe files if you get your error 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.450
 with files from another extension not 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:29.420
 it will work only with files 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.260
 point x right you will click on others 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.709
 pet will press enter 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.609
 in this notepad 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:45.230
 You're not going to dictate is this six lines 

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:48.440
 here to fix this right problem 

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:50.510
 You'll copy here and I'll leave it. 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:55.280
 download this notepad for you 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:03:00.430
 It is in the video description you not 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.430
 need to enter is this code here 

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:06.270
 inside the notepad that you opened in the 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:10.050
 command prompt 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:12.450
 remembering you typed here notepad gave 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:14.700
 in what will open a blog notes you will 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.880
 necklace 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:22.200
 this code inside will click on 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:24.420
 file save as you can select 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:27.180
 Here even the desktop 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:37.320
 here you select puts the name 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:41.670
 correction correct this z point right rc 

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.040
 staff put it here to those type 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.320
 you put all the files in 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:49.770
 coding you will put unicom 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:53.910
 select certainly work click 

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:57.660
 save will already be safe here in your 

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:59.640
 work area you can close 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:08.250
 since the other 

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:12.840
 and click here twice in the 

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:14.880
 registration will click on yes and it will appear 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.620
 this message to you have been inserted 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.019
 with this in the register of these 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:22.860
 settings that we put 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:25.440
 done that you 'll be able to open it here 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.760
 the files were are opening 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:30.030
 right there 

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:34.020
 according to the good the right program 

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.370
 second personal method is a method that 

00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.560
 I found on the internet that it was 

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.250
 developed more easily for 

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.250
 fix this error 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.190
 Are you going to do the same procedure? 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.160
 change few things you will tighten 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:52.440
 against this shift but that for b 

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:55.169
 task manager and here you go 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.840
 hold control and will click on new 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:02.479
 task will reopen the product and 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:04.710
 How will you again be notepad? 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.870
 remembering that when you do the other 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.270
 procedure 

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.070
 all files will be back to 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:12.750
 to work properly but the files 

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:16.230
 that are on the desktop you have 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.310
 that restarting the computer is for 

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:22.050
 they come back to work correctly 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:25.650
 sure if the first doctor decided 

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:27.030
 you can rest easy that you do not 

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:29.790
 will need to do the second method 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:31.590
 right although the two meters are the same 

00:05:29.790 --> 00:05:33.210
 thing, but the second method is more 

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:36.030
 fast right 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.630
 Good, then you'll open the manager 

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:42.240
 task against the shift + s p 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.820
 in new task file to run you 

00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:47.840
 will hold the construction and click on new 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.520
 task for my commanding people 

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:53.060
 again you will be in tibet that is 

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:54.180
 the notepad and this time you will 

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.160
 necklace 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:57.690
 the following code is correct too 

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.760
 leave it for you in the video description 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.920
 so you do not have to stay 

00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:05.910
 pausing video to copy this code 

00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:09.600
 right put the code you're going to click 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:12.990
 in save file as desktop 

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:19.290
 to make it easier you will put the 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:22.650
 name correct this z point hits right 

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:24.900
 personal to whom you are going to put 

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:28.530
 all files in encoding you 

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:31.830
 can leave the pattern to msi even right and 

00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.540
 click Save to Desktop 

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:37.920
 I already have a file that was created or 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:39.410
 yes you can close everything 

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:41.730
 again 

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:44.340
 in this one you will click the button 

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:47.760
 right and will perform as 

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:50.460
 administrator again you will see that 

00:06:47.760 --> 00:06:53.880
 all files there have been fixed 

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:55.770
 successfully you can open there that goes 

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:58.220
 everything is working in compliance 

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:58.220
 right 

00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:06.490
 good 

00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:07.870
 those were the two meters after finishing 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:09.700
 The second method you have to do is to 

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:11.650
 same thing or you restart the 

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:13.330
 computer for the icons in the 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.520
 work will resume 

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:17.920
 or you open the 

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:24.450
 tasks is already working so you 

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:29.010
 can open right here in processes 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:32.250
 closes the ex-brother ends the process 

00:07:29.010 --> 00:07:35.440
 on file new task 

00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:38.560
 again you add ex-glory point 

00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:40.330
 x and the icons that were not yet 

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.490
 working this work with returning to 

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:45.250
 work right and all these problems 

00:07:42.490 --> 00:07:48.280
 they will already be fixed right 

00:07:45.250 --> 00:07:50.800
 these were the two methods so I hope 

00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.200
 You liked it, did you like it? 

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:56.170
