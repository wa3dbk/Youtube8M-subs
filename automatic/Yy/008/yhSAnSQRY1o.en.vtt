I've<00:01:10.470> already<00:01:10.890> contacted<00:01:11.250> their<00:01:11.939> media

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
I've already contacted their media

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:16.429 
I've already contacted their media
department<00:01:13.049> about<00:01:13.200> that<00:01:13.590> and<00:01:15.200> since<00:01:16.200> then<00:01:16.290> I

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
department about that and since then I

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
department about that and since then I
haven't<00:01:16.860> gotten<00:01:17.310> a<00:01:17.580> single<00:01:17.970> reply<00:01:19.340> so<00:01:20.340> three

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
haven't gotten a single reply so three

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:22.100 
haven't gotten a single reply so three
pointless<00:01:21.210> right<00:01:21.390> now

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
pointless right now

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:25.430 
pointless right now
and<00:01:22.550> other<00:01:23.550> reason<00:01:24.000> is<00:01:24.210> because<00:01:24.570> i<00:01:25.080> have<00:01:25.410> a

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:25.440 
and other reason is because i have a

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:31.040 
and other reason is because i have a
very<00:01:27.410> slow<00:01:28.410> upload<00:01:28.710> speed<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.870> which<00:01:30.870> makes

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.050 
very slow upload speed and which makes

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:34.160 
very slow upload speed and which makes
it<00:01:31.230> very<00:01:31.290> hard<00:01:31.530> to<00:01:31.800> upload<00:01:32.280> videos<00:01:32.310> in<00:01:33.300> one<00:01:33.900> day

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
it very hard to upload videos in one day

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.120 
it very hard to upload videos in one day
and<00:01:36.050> well<00:01:37.050> that's<00:01:37.590> not<00:01:37.680> really<00:01:37.740> a<00:01:37.920> big<00:01:38.070> deal

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
and well that's not really a big deal

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.190 
and well that's not really a big deal
but<00:01:38.580> there's<00:01:39.330> something<00:01:39.479> I<00:01:39.660> want<00:01:39.810> to<00:01:39.840> talk<00:01:40.140> to
