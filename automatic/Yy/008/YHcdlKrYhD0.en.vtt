00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.390 
here's the original bridge it didn't
have<00:02:02.159> to<00:02:02.340> be<00:02:02.490> but<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:03.750> owner<00:02:03.960> felt<00:02:04.350> with<00:02:05.070> as

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
have to be but the owner felt with as

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.920 
have to be but the owner felt with as
you<00:02:05.580> know<00:02:05.700> anyone<00:02:05.970> that<00:02:06.150> played<00:02:06.330> 12<00:02:06.630> strings

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
you know anyone that played 12 strings

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:09.350 
you know anyone that played 12 strings
they<00:02:07.170> are<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.380> bear<00:02:08.129> to<00:02:08.399> tune<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> the

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
they are a bear to tune and the

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.089 
they are a bear to tune and the
intonation<00:02:09.659> and<00:02:10.259> keeping<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.649> in<00:02:10.739> tune<00:02:10.920> with

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
intonation and keeping it in tune with

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.220 
intonation and keeping it in tune with
this<00:02:11.280> bridge<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:12.209> very<00:02:12.420> difficult<00:02:12.870> so<00:02:13.110> it

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
this bridge it's very difficult so it

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.839 
this bridge it's very difficult so it
made<00:02:13.409> it<00:02:13.560> pretty<00:02:13.680> much<00:02:13.890> almost<00:02:14.250> impossible<00:02:14.760> to

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
made it pretty much almost impossible to

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.539 
made it pretty much almost impossible to
play<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.599> they<00:02:15.720> retrofitted<00:02:15.959> it<00:02:16.620> with<00:02:17.280> another

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:17.549 
play so they retrofitted it with another

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:19.730 
play so they retrofitted it with another
bridge<00:02:17.849> here's<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.330> original<00:02:18.810> bridge<00:02:19.080> that

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
bridge here's the original bridge that

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.130 
bridge here's the original bridge that
went<00:02:19.980> right<00:02:20.190> in<00:02:20.400> there<00:02:20.580> like<00:02:20.610> that<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.390> could

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
went right in there like that you could

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.589 
went right in there like that you could
see<00:02:22.319> it's<00:02:22.500> kind<00:02:22.800> of<00:02:22.890> curvy<00:02:23.850> and

00:02:24.589 --> 00:02:24.599 
see it's kind of curvy and

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:26.869 
see it's kind of curvy and
just<00:02:25.079> lots<00:02:25.319> of<00:02:25.439> problems<00:02:25.950> with<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.310> and<00:02:26.519> also

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:26.879 
just lots of problems with that and also

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.589 
just lots of problems with that and also
the<00:02:27.209> tuners<00:02:27.599> were<00:02:27.780> changed<00:02:29.180> but<00:02:30.180> just

00:02:30.589 --> 00:02:30.599 
the tuners were changed but just

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:33.080 
the tuners were changed but just

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
modified not not like holes holes

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:34.610 
modified not not like holes holes
drilled<00:02:33.480> or<00:02:33.689> anything<00:02:33.870> in<00:02:34.139> the<00:02:34.200> woods<00:02:34.349> but
