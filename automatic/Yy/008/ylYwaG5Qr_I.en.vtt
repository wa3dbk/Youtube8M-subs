some wind sweeping over the buildings

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.460 
some wind sweeping over the buildings
and<00:01:29.560> that<00:01:29.799> symbolizes<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.259> losing<00:01:32.259> of<00:01:32.350> the

and that symbolizes the losing of the
city<00:01:32.740> under<00:01:33.009> the<00:01:33.100> sand<00:01:33.430> I<00:01:33.549> don't<00:01:33.700> know<00:01:33.810> so<00:01:34.810> the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
city under the sand I don't know so the

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:42.020 
city under the sand I don't know so the
next<00:01:35.259> one<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.620 

well<00:01:42.630> it's<00:01:42.960> here<00:01:43.530> I'm<00:01:44.310> strong<00:01:44.730> remember<00:01:45.360> where

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
well it's here I'm strong remember where

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.120 
well it's here I'm strong remember where
it<00:01:45.900> is<00:01:46.080> in<00:01:46.290> the<00:01:46.440> level<00:01:47.000> if<00:01:48.350> if<00:01:49.350> you<00:01:49.560> follow<00:01:49.890> the

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
it is in the level if if you follow the

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.450 
it is in the level if if you follow the
path<00:01:50.370> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:51.360> flying<00:01:52.350> carpets<00:01:52.979> they<00:01:53.130> should

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
path of the flying carpets they should

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.969 
path of the flying carpets they should
really<00:01:53.820> guide<00:01:54.750> you<00:01:55.080> to<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.350> it's<00:01:55.620> a<00:01:55.710> fairly

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
really guide you to it it's a fairly

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:59.390 
really guide you to it it's a fairly
simple<00:01:56.220> one<00:01:56.520> but<00:01:56.910> if<00:01:57.720> not<00:01:58.080> you<00:01:58.350> veer<00:01:58.800> right<00:01:59.100> and

00:01:59.390 --> 00:01:59.400 
simple one but if not you veer right and

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.969 
simple one but if not you veer right and
then<00:01:59.850> up<00:02:00.600> from<00:02:01.050> the<00:02:01.140> start<00:02:01.350> of<00:02:01.470> the<00:02:01.530> level<00:02:01.830> and

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
then up from the start of the level and

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.740 
then up from the start of the level and
it's<00:02:02.250> there<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:02.820> it's<00:02:02.910> on<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.090> right<00:02:03.360> hand

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
it's there so it's on the right hand

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.170 
it's there so it's on the right hand
side<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:04.170> level<00:02:04.440> you<00:02:04.560> start<00:02:04.830> this<00:02:05.610> is<00:02:05.850> on<00:02:05.970> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
side of level you start this is on the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.150 
side of level you start this is on the
right<00:02:06.690> on<00:02:06.869> the<00:02:06.930> other<00:02:07.020> side<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.440> the<00:02:07.680> level<00:02:07.890> you

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
right on the other side of the level you

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.940 
right on the other side of the level you
can<00:02:08.850> get<00:02:09.000> your<00:02:09.149> symbol<00:02:09.570> but<00:02:10.320> I<00:02:10.350> use<00:02:10.619> that<00:02:10.800> as<00:02:10.890> a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
can get your symbol but I use that as a

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.240 
can get your symbol but I use that as a
marker<00:02:11.430> because<00:02:11.700> once<00:02:11.970> you've<00:02:12.150> got<00:02:12.360> that<00:02:13.250> fly

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
marker because once you've got that fly

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.300 
marker because once you've got that fly
soar<00:02:14.640> straight<00:02:15.570> over<00:02:16.050> here<00:02:16.080> and<00:02:16.980> this<00:02:17.160> is

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
soar straight over here and this is

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:19.220 
soar straight over here and this is
quite<00:02:17.550> hidden<00:02:17.940> you<00:02:18.180> won't<00:02:18.390> really<00:02:18.660> see<00:02:18.870> this

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
quite hidden you won't really see this

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:21.140 
quite hidden you won't really see this
and<00:02:19.410> this<00:02:19.500> is<00:02:19.620> either<00:02:19.770> from<00:02:20.370> the<00:02:20.520> start<00:02:20.850> of<00:02:21.000> the

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150 
and this is either from the start of the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.150 
and this is either from the start of the
level<00:02:21.360> hitting<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> beat<00:02:22.290> it<00:02:22.620> will<00:02:22.709> be<00:02:22.830> to<00:02:23.040> the

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:23.160 
level hitting the beat it will be to the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.000 
level hitting the beat it will be to the

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
the other way I did it this way because

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:34.460 
the other way I did it this way because
that's<00:02:32.370> the<00:02:32.489> way<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> went<00:02:32.910> round<00:02:33.180> in<00:02:33.600> the<00:02:34.080> level

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
but hopefully it's hidden over here on

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.740 
but hopefully it's hidden over here on
the<00:02:41.130> right

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:45.480

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
quick on this one here this is a

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.830 
quick on this one here this is a
different<00:02:47.920> girls<00:02:48.100> doing<00:02:48.490> multiplayer<00:02:48.910> but

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
can find that this one is directly after

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.940 
can find that this one is directly after
the<00:02:57.280> first<00:02:57.580> sequence<00:02:58.090> where<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.540> do<00:02:58.750> the<00:02:59.110> sand

surfing over in the corner of this level

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.250 
surfing over in the corner of this level
this<00:03:03.280> looks<00:03:03.520> like<00:03:03.670> the<00:03:03.880> square<00:03:04.720> room<00:03:05.020> where

just<00:07:07.749> happened<00:07:07.989> to<00:07:08.019> be<00:07:08.079> the<00:07:08.259> one<00:07:08.379> that<00:07:08.529> I

00:07:08.579 --> 00:07:08.589 
just happened to be the one that I
