00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:05.709
 today once again the school opens its 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:07.569
 doors to show the work that 

00:00:05.709 --> 00:00:10.780
 did the guys in this thing we call 

00:00:07.569 --> 00:00:12.340
 school science fair and here it is 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.800
 worked during the previous months 

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:17.920
 to be able to present this not what are 

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:21.700
 some axis of the theme are actually 

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.260
 the sciences since mid-May that 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:25.480
 teachers have been working with their 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.699
 students to be able to conclude in this 

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:30.520
 exhibition with a cut in the 

00:00:27.699 --> 00:00:32.800
 contents that usually arise from 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:34.899
 a curiosity of the students in this 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.470
 I am accompanied by a fourth-year student 

00:00:34.899 --> 00:00:40.809
 and his teacher where curiosity arose 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.770
 at lunchtime in the dining room 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:44.960
 school 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.060
 what was the result we're going to talk to 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:49.850
 christina vitozzi who is the teacher what 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:51.860
 such the good result of the most 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.840
 positive because really in the 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.340
 application of the scientific method 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.160
 as great scientists do 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:01.890
 but good here small scientists 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.019
 starting from a curiosity and a and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:07.410
 to raise doubts about that curiosity 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.930
 come to conclusions this time the 

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:11.460
 I will be able to tell you well if you want 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.850
 as Claudia said it arose in the dining room 

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.050
 school not at the time of eating the dessert 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.700
 so good at lunch time 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.550
 dessert they had to eat halves of 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.200
 apples and apples to be 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.700
 cut in advance had been 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.220
 obscured then one of the students 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.770
 he got very angry because the apple that 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.530
 he had touched he was fucked and good and 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.300
 despite my explanation that no 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.090
 She was rotten, she did not want to eat it because 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:38.190
 it was rotten then there arises the 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.080
 theme of the cirh at the science fair 

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:43.140
 the apple when it is brown is 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:47.580
 rotten or not rotten with the 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.550
 conclusion that the apple is made of 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.280
 molecules and when you cut the apple the 

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:58.170
 molecule breaks down with the molecule it 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:59.970
 break they break into atoms and when they 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:03.360
 break the atoms release a juice 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:05.120
 juice called phenol is when the 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:09.060
 phenols make contact with oxygen 

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:12.360
 towards oxidation and that makes a change 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.700
 physical and when you leave it a long time 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.700
 cut makes a change 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:25.340
 a chemical change that's why you see more 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:28.319
 dark yes but you can eat like yes 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.560
 we also investigate that there is 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.330
 processes of re-treatment of this 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.420
 then to see how we can 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.130
 retard or delay oxidation when 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:43.960
 they will vent 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:46.570
 a bucket or something that puts a bowl and 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:52.150
 cut the apple and put it inside the 

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:54.580
 water with ice or if you do not put the goal 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.370
 you put water inside and you smell the apple 

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:59.370
 cut in the morning 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.000
 surely there are other experiences other 

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.850
 experiments that the guys have done yes 

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.550
 yes yes yes yes states of the water changes of 

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:12.130
 water states and good and we have left 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.740
 half a year ahead to follow this 

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:19.050
 well the physical and chemical changes that 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.050
 they occur in nature curiosities
