00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.650
 hello with you alex beach you already about 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:08.069
 know what will be 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:10.019
 iphone 6s on past model release with 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.320
 we see that the feature of these updates 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.790
 in the revolutionary news in 3d with the main 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.600
 feature has become an opportunity 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.670
 video filming 4s showed the world siri in 5s 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.970
 there is a new way of security 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.980
 swing worth wondering what will be 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.580
 surprise the next heir to this 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.580
 traditions 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.250
 after all, it is his release should 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.980
 present to the world what I have not seen 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:46.289
 and if you have seen something not so perfect 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:47.160
 the next premiere of 2015 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.120
 will become 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.760
 iphone 6s this update is oriented 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.860
 on hardware upgrade and unusual 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.120
 new items as already shown 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:02.940
 Apple's previous smartphone models 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.129
 unlike their competitors companies from 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:08.010
 cupertino always refused 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.650
 race megapixels all these 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.380
 years she constantly searched for more 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.509
 alternative way rather than implementation 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:19.939
 a lot of megapixels 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:22.880
 since 2011 with the release of iphone 4s 

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:27.150
 resolution remained unchanged 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.020
 iphone 6 and 6 plus have 8 megapixels 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.939
 but at the same time they were highly appreciated 

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:34.530
 professional photographers 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.570
 operators and continue to delight 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:40.799
 camera of their consumers 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:43.680
 I do not know whether it will happen with the iphone 6s 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.710
 or the floor will hold such innovation until 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:49.310
 iphone 7 output in the next model 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:55.380
 may have a new camera sensor 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:58.729
 sony exmor rs 7 x 230 whose delivery 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.469
 will begin in April 2015 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.170
 sensor includes resolution 

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:07.920
 twenty one megapixel support 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:10.770
 shooting hdr video in 4k resolution 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.030
 camera module consisting of several 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.970
 lenses with 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:17.100
 variable focal length 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:21.590
 shows great results you can 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:24.180
 see this for this pair of images to 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:29.250
 existing optical stabilization 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.410
 more optical zoom will be added 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.860
 no grit on magnification 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.860
 scale 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:41.800
 also claim that the camera is a smartphone 

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:44.740
 will be more high-light therefore 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:48.690
 we get less noise in pictures and videos 

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.690
 in low light conditions 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:55.990
 Internet users are actively predicting 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.050
 the appearance of the display iphone 6s sensor 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:00.690
 pressure is similar to force touch in apple 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.430
 watch 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:08.410
 This opportunity allows you to feel 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:11.410
 the power of your touch watch from apple 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:14.760
 recognize not just a touch but from 

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.410
 the power with which it was made 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.410
 many small electrodes around 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:23.890
 display allow us to determine 

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:25.380
 the difference between a light touch and a strong 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.810
 pushing 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:32.050
 for example, touch confirms actions 

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.190
 pressing brings up the context menu so 

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:37.840
 way in iphone 6s all will be excluded 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:41.890
 control deficiencies compared to 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.830
 traditional computer mouse and it looks like 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:48.190
 Apple still did not leave the idea of ​​implementation 

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:50.140
 sapphire glasses their smartphones if 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.709
 it didn't work out in the six 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:57.010
 then for 6c it is already planned to grow and 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:59.049
 Safir cut using a laser in this 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.340
 case immediately get the detail 

00:03:59.049 --> 00:04:03.160
 required form 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:08.140
 not requiring additional grinding and 

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:10.000
 refinement sapphire crystal will relieve from 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.150
 most painful problems 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.390
 scratching screen on hardness scale 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:18.729
 saphire can only be scratched with a diamond and 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:21.760
 the only drawback is that 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:24.060
 sapphire glass can increase the price 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.159
 devices 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.729
 promises an increase in operational volume 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:31.060
 of memory 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:32.680
 it will rise to two gigabytes this step 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.069
 will be made for the purpose of deliverance 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.770
 suffering multitasking which is no longer 

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.800
 manages to work normally with one 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:44.050
 gigabytes of RAM they will increase the frame to 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.550
 two gigabytes and go over 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:48.990
 perfect modules 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:51.550
 dir now smartphones are equipped 

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:55.199
 lpddr3 with maximum bandwidth 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:58.599
 17 gigabytes per second 

00:04:55.199 --> 00:05:02.080
 the next iphone 6s will be able to increase 

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:05.490
 your rate up to 34 

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:08.949
 gigabytes per second with lp module 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:11.500
 ddr4 this solution apple can not be considered 

00:05:08.949 --> 00:05:15.039
 blank it can positively affect 

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:18.430
 for speed and power consumption 

00:05:15.039 --> 00:05:22.449
 devices in the new smartphone will be 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:25.360
 apple processor 9 samsung already started 

00:05:22.449 --> 00:05:28.539
 Production A9 at its factory in the USA 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:31.419
 also a small part of orders in 

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:34.599
 particular for ipad air 3 will 

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:38.500
 Taiwanese company tsmc 

00:05:34.599 --> 00:05:41.469
 this a9 processor is built on 14 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:43.569
 nanometer technology fil hit will allow 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:46.719
 improve processor performance 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:49.830
 20 percent and energy consumption 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:52.539
 reduce by 35 percent since 

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:56.080
 corresponding processor in size 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:05:58.949
 15 times less compared to 20 on 

00:05:56.080 --> 00:06:01.719
 meter apple a8 in the smartphone case 

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:06.029
 there will be even more extra 

00:06:01.719 --> 00:06:09.669
 places to introduce various innovations 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:14.560
 Along with this, the apple can remove the iphone 

00:06:09.669 --> 00:06:15.629
 5s and replace it with 4 inch iphone 6s 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:18.460
 mini 

00:06:15.629 --> 00:06:21.339
 I wonder whether the company will also go to 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:23.800
 plastic case or still leave 

00:06:21.339 --> 00:06:27.610
 aluminum news about the possible 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:29.020
 appearance 6 with mini analyst confirmed 

00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:32.580
 kvn and company 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.850
 timati arch do we know his predictions 

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:39.440
 repeatedly turned out to be true 

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:41.930
 this is probably all that could be 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.699
 tell about new 6s write to 

00:06:41.930 --> 00:06:46.820
 comments about your intended 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:49.550
 updates in 6s and which of the possibilities 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:52.190
 your opinion will be the crown itself in 

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:54.680
 next model, I think she will 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:55.370
 optical zoom that promised to introduce 

00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:57.199
 in the six
