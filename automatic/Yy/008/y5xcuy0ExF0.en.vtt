we<00:00:02.250> will<00:00:02.399> be<00:00:02.520> looking<00:00:02.879> at<00:00:03.090> the<00:00:03.270> blood<00:00:03.449> cells

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
we will be looking at the blood cells

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.430 
we will be looking at the blood cells
now<00:00:05.120> we<00:00:06.120> will<00:00:06.210> be<00:00:06.299> first<00:00:06.569> looking<00:00:06.990> at<00:00:07.140> the

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:07.440 
now we will be first looking at the

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.089 
now we will be first looking at the
granulocytes<00:00:09.170> the<00:00:10.170> first<00:00:10.469> type<00:00:10.710> of<00:00:10.740> granting

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
granulocytes the first type of granting

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.530 
granulocytes the first type of granting
a<00:00:11.160> site<00:00:11.370> that<00:00:11.400> we<00:00:11.610> will<00:00:11.730> be<00:00:11.820> looking<00:00:12.150> at<00:00:12.269> is

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
a site that we will be looking at is

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.519 
a site that we will be looking at is
called<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.960> eos<00:00:13.559> NFL<00:00:14.299> the<00:00:15.299> eosinophil<00:00:16.049> has

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
called the eos NFL the eosinophil has

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:21.590 
called the eos NFL the eosinophil has
reddish<00:00:17.340> granules<00:00:18.949> it<00:00:19.949> is<00:00:20.520> also<00:00:20.880> considered

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
reddish granules it is also considered

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
tiny granules in its cytoplasm next we

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.350 
tiny granules in its cytoplasm next we
have<00:01:02.760> the<00:01:03.000> basal<00:01:03.960> film<00:01:04.309> the<00:01:05.309> basal<00:01:05.820> phil<00:01:06.090> is

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
have the basal film the basal phil is

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.810 
have the basal film the basal phil is
also<00:01:07.080> a<00:01:07.320> type<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.590> granulocyte<00:01:09.890> it<00:01:10.890> has<00:01:11.189> dark

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
also a type of granulocyte it has dark

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.460 
also a type of granulocyte it has dark
granules<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.869> its<00:01:13.290> cytoplasm<00:01:14.900> it<00:01:15.900> is<00:01:16.049> also

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
granules in its cytoplasm it is also

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.800 
granules in its cytoplasm it is also
considered<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.009> have<00:01:17.130> a<00:01:17.280> by<00:01:17.700> lobed<00:01:18.060> nucleus

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
considered to have a by lobed nucleus

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.870 
considered to have a by lobed nucleus
one<00:01:19.350> two<00:01:20.840> but<00:01:21.840> if<00:01:21.960> you<00:01:22.080> compare<00:01:22.619> the<00:01:23.400> basal

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
one two but if you compare the basal

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.039 
one two but if you compare the basal
fill<00:01:24.470> to<00:01:25.470> the<00:01:25.500> eosinophil<00:01:26.460> you<00:01:27.390> can<00:01:27.570> see<00:01:27.840> that

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
fill to the eosinophil you can see that

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.530 
fill to the eosinophil you can see that
the<00:01:28.170> connection<00:01:28.770> between<00:01:29.400> the<00:01:29.820> lobes<00:01:30.119> is

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:30.540 
the connection between the lobes is

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.490 
the connection between the lobes is
thinner<00:01:31.439> in<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:32.299> eosinophil<00:01:33.299> as<00:01:33.540> compared<00:01:34.409> to

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
thinner in the eosinophil as compared to

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:39.319 
thinner in the eosinophil as compared to
the<00:01:34.860> basal<00:01:35.790> film<00:01:37.040> next<00:01:38.040> we<00:01:38.880> will<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.119> dealing

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
the basal film next we will be dealing

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.859 
the basal film next we will be dealing
with<00:01:39.509> the<00:01:40.220> agranulocytes<00:01:41.299> this<00:01:42.299> is<00:01:42.450> also<00:01:42.720> a

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
with the agranulocytes this is also a

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.139 
with the agranulocytes this is also a
type<00:01:43.140> of<00:01:43.170> white<00:01:43.590> blood<00:01:43.829> cell<00:01:44.130> or<00:01:44.369> leukocyte

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:48.139 
type of white blood cell or leukocyte
this<00:01:46.049> is<00:01:46.259> the<00:01:46.439> largest<00:01:46.920> of<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.729> white<00:01:47.909> blood

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
this is the largest of the white blood

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.370 
this is the largest of the white blood
cells<00:01:48.210> and<00:01:48.750> it<00:01:48.990> is<00:01:49.079> termed<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.649> monocyte<00:01:51.380> termed

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
cells and it is termed a monocyte termed

cells and it is termed a monocyte termed
a<00:01:52.530> monocyte<00:01:53.280> again<00:01:53.640> it<00:01:53.820> is<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.119> largest<00:01:54.600> of

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:55.369 
a monocyte again it is the largest of

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.980 
a monocyte again it is the largest of
the<00:01:56.369> leukocytes<00:01:56.700> or<00:01:57.149> white<00:01:57.450> blood<00:01:57.719> cells

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
the leukocytes or white blood cells

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.850 
the leukocytes or white blood cells
monocyte<00:01:59.450> next<00:02:00.450> we<00:02:01.290> will<00:02:01.350> be<00:02:01.439> dealing<00:02:01.680> with

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
monocyte next we will be dealing with

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.390 
monocyte next we will be dealing with
the<00:02:02.159> lymphocyte<00:02:03.740> the<00:02:04.740> lymphocyte

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
the lymphocyte the lymphocyte

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.940 
the lymphocyte the lymphocyte
generally<00:02:07.330> we<00:02:07.480> discussed<00:02:07.930> the<00:02:08.110> t-lymphocyte

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
generally we discussed the t-lymphocyte

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.920 
generally we discussed the t-lymphocyte
and<00:02:09.160> the<00:02:09.250> B<00:02:09.430> lymphocyte<00:02:10.000> but<00:02:10.390> here<00:02:10.720> we<00:02:10.900> are

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:10.930 
and the B lymphocyte but here we are

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:14.420 
and the B lymphocyte but here we are
just<00:02:11.140> simply<00:02:11.350> calling<00:02:11.770> this<00:02:11.980> the<00:02:12.220> lymphocyte

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
just simply calling this the lymphocyte

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.570 
just simply calling this the lymphocyte
next<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:16.090> have<00:02:16.300> the<00:02:16.570> platelet<00:02:17.400> which<00:02:18.400> is

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:18.580 
next we have the platelet which is

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:21.000 
next we have the platelet which is
important<00:02:19.150> next<00:02:19.930> we<00:02:20.170> would<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.470> talking<00:02:20.890> about

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
important next we would be talking about

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.090 
important next we would be talking about
the<00:02:21.400> red<00:02:21.850> blood<00:02:22.090> cell<00:02:22.450> this<00:02:23.410> is<00:02:23.590> the<00:02:23.710> red<00:02:23.890> blood

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
the red blood cell this is the red blood

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.050 
the red blood cell this is the red blood
cell<00:02:24.460> also<00:02:24.850> known<00:02:25.270> as<00:02:25.480> an<00:02:25.750> erythrocyte
