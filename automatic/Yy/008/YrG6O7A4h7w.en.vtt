00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.196
 Yes, yeah, it is Mr. Rokugen! 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:03.700
 This time 

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:06.460
 Team at Suburban Flat 

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:08.375
 I'm about to say Team Deathmatch 

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.900
 I want to do a team bunkish 

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:12.840
 Ne 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:13.676
 This time is it 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:18.020
 Future cactus 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.940
 I want to do it! 

00:00:26.185 --> 00:00:27.225
 I have 50 dogs. 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:27.740
 Become crazy! 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.100
 This is so much, I have never done it 

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.320
 I do not know where it comes from 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.040
 I'm just going to see you, I was there! I will come! 

00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:45.083
 Oh, I wonder if it is a reservoir! 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.020
 Where did you go? 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 I can not stand it any longer 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.540
 I was at a good moment! 

00:01:12.076 --> 00:01:14.076
 It was a charge weapon 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.824
 Future shot 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.940
 This is quite a distance 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.380
 Because it is a type to do 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.660
 OK, I will come! 

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:28.454
 Won't you come ... 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:38.909
 That's right, I need to go a little further 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.989
 I did it! Potato mine worked! 

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.300
 Let's go to various places a little 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.700
 I'm losing 

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.240
 There are a lot but ... did it hit? 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
 I got 30 but 

00:02:07.637 --> 00:02:09.637
 You're on top 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.580
 It is difficult here (map) 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.820
 If it is moved a little bit, it won't happen 

00:02:31.497 --> 00:02:33.497
 Should I go alone? 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:34.820
 (All one shot but ...) 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.980
 Just, it's a bit tough when you get close 

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600
 I will come! 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.976
 Unpalatable 

00:02:50.375 --> 00:02:52.375
 Okay, dangerous, dangerous dangerous 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.220
 What's wrong, I feel like something like 1 bangkish 1 KO ... 

00:03:08.178 --> 00:03:10.178
 While taking this distance ... 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.440
 OK OK! 

00:03:13.999 --> 00:03:15.999
 It's okay! It was saved! 

00:03:17.912 --> 00:03:20.372
 (Protection) Did not need? sorry··· 

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:24.460
 Did you feel like "let me do it"? 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420
 Well, don't get upset 

00:03:48.555 --> 00:03:50.555
 Hey, there are obstacles to good mind 

00:03:50.555 --> 00:03:51.854
 It is difficult 

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:06.020
 It hits quite well 

00:04:11.794 --> 00:04:13.794
 It's ZPG! 

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.600
 It was frozen! 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.580
 Not noticed 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:39.300
 OK 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:40.036
 Where is 

00:04:46.194 --> 00:04:48.194
 Well, it's moaning 

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:52.980
 Wow 

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.420
 Maybe you are too busy to be resurrected? 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.840
 Oh, there is Sabo-chan 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:08.000
 Yoshi Yoshi 

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.020
 It may be good, this is strong! 

00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:12.555
 Uh, wait a moment, I can not see 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:15.200
 Invisible invisible 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.860
 Behind 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.151
 Hey, are not many Soldiers? 

00:05:19.115 --> 00:05:21.115
 Oh, what are you winning? 

00:05:21.115 --> 00:05:23.315
 (No, I'm losing!) 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:27.920
 (Also mistake the zombie side!) 

00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:35.255
 Oh, I won! 

00:05:35.255 --> 00:05:37.195
 (No, I lost ~!) 

00:05:41.114 --> 00:05:43.114
 Oh, you weren't the first to lose? 

00:05:43.114 --> 00:05:45.774
 (I lost from the beginning to the end w) 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:52.380
 I was hard at the game and I could not see the score 

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.920
 (Within the team) 1st place was taken 

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.417
 Borst, what is it? 

00:05:57.920 --> 00:06:01.240
 Thank you for your 1st Strike Master! 

00:06:05.614 --> 00:06:07.614
 In the future cactus 

00:06:07.655 --> 00:06:09.655
 It was a team bunkish
