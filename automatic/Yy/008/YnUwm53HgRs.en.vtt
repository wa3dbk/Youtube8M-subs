a line here on all eight brackets and

00:03:53.819 --> 00:04:04.100 
a line here on all eight brackets and
then<00:03:54.000> we'll<00:03:54.180> drill<00:04:02.660> okay<00:04:03.660> now<00:04:03.840> that<00:04:03.989> we

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
then we'll drill okay now that we

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.839 
then we'll drill okay now that we
removed<00:04:04.319> the<00:04:04.799> status<00:04:05.430> grill

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:05.849 
removed the status grill

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:08.120 
removed the status grill
here's<00:04:06.209> your<00:04:06.420> marker<00:04:06.900> lines<00:04:07.110> we're<00:04:07.950> going<00:04:08.069> to

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:08.130 
here's your marker lines we're going to

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:09.890 
here's your marker lines we're going to
drill<00:04:08.400> those<00:04:08.610> what<00:04:09.030> you<00:04:09.120> want<00:04:09.269> to<00:04:09.360> do<00:04:09.450> is<00:04:09.599> drill

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
drill those what you want to do is drill

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:14.600 
drill those what you want to do is drill
towards<00:04:10.709> the<00:04:10.799> inside<00:04:11.250> end<00:04:12.709> of<00:04:13.709> the<00:04:13.829> line<00:04:14.069> so

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
towards the inside end of the line so

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.039 
towards the inside end of the line so
it'd<00:04:14.700> be<00:04:14.849> on<00:04:14.970> this<00:04:15.120> end<00:04:15.360> what<00:04:15.720> that<00:04:15.900> will

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
it'd be on this end what that will

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:18.650 
it'd be on this end what that will
achieve<00:04:16.200> is<00:04:16.709> a<00:04:16.919> little<00:04:17.729> easier<00:04:18.120> to<00:04:18.269> install

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.080 
lines up and fits within the shelf so

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.350 
lines up and fits within the shelf so
we'll<00:05:10.169> get<00:05:10.289> it<00:05:10.410> centered<00:05:10.740> and<00:05:11.000> then<00:05:12.000> what<00:05:12.240> you

we'll get it centered and then what you

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.810 
we'll get it centered and then what you
want<00:05:12.539> to<00:05:12.599> do<00:05:12.750> is<00:05:12.870> achieve<00:05:13.260> is<00:05:14.070> get<00:05:14.370> the<00:05:14.550> shell

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:14.820 
want to do is achieve is get the shell

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.879 
want to do is achieve is get the shell
the<00:05:15.120> grille<00:05:15.530> just<00:05:16.530> inside<00:05:16.979> the<00:05:17.190> shell<00:05:18.680> all<00:05:19.680> the

the grille just inside the shell all the
way<00:05:19.979> around<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:20.400> then<00:05:20.520> tighten<00:05:20.820> them<00:05:20.940> all<00:05:21.030> up

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.520 

alright<00:05:40.630> we<00:05:40.780> got<00:05:40.810> it<00:05:40.930> all<00:05:41.110> tightened<00:05:41.500> down
