00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
it to the woods I kind of knew that

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.800 
it to the woods I kind of knew that
there<00:02:07.850> might<00:02:07.970> have<00:02:08.030> been<00:02:08.119> a<00:02:08.239> chance<00:02:08.509> that<00:02:08.780> I

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
there might have been a chance that I

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.440 
there might have been a chance that I
would<00:02:09.229> break<00:02:09.649> it<00:02:09.890> and<00:02:10.069> I<00:02:10.670> was<00:02:10.880> really

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 
would break it and I was really

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.970 
would break it and I was really
surprised<00:02:11.810> when<00:02:11.930> I<00:02:12.050> did<00:02:12.290> I<00:02:14.110> took<00:02:15.110> it<00:02:15.590> off<00:02:15.650> road

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
surprised when I did I took it off road

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.740 
surprised when I did I took it off road
Oh<00:02:16.010> perhaps<00:02:16.430> got<00:02:16.700> a<00:02:16.730> little<00:02:16.849> bit<00:02:17.060> too<00:02:17.180> excited

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
Oh perhaps got a little bit too excited

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:21.880
