and clean the whole thing up I think it

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.690 
and clean the whole thing up I think it
looks<00:02:10.630> a<00:02:10.720> lot<00:02:10.840> better<00:02:10.899> now<00:02:11.170> I<00:02:11.530> went<00:02:12.519> ahead<00:02:12.580> and

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:12.700 
looks a lot better now I went ahead and

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.310 
looks a lot better now I went ahead and
checked<00:02:12.910> his<00:02:13.090> email<00:02:13.299> -<00:02:13.810> while<00:02:14.049> I<00:02:14.080> was<00:02:14.110> waiting

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:14.320 
checked his email - while I was waiting

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:17.100 
checked his email - while I was waiting
for<00:02:14.680> the<00:02:14.860> wd-40<00:02:15.820> on<00:02:15.940> this<00:02:16.150> thing<00:02:16.330> to<00:02:16.420> dry<00:02:16.720> and

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
for the wd-40 on this thing to dry and

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:19.530 
for the wd-40 on this thing to dry and
he<00:02:17.830> said<00:02:18.100> that<00:02:18.400> in<00:02:18.489> this<00:02:18.610> position<00:02:18.850> it's<00:02:19.360> an

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
he said that in this position it's an

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.300 
he said that in this position it's an
American<00:02:19.989> mode<00:02:20.200> when<00:02:20.799> we<00:02:20.890> switch<00:02:21.100> to<00:02:21.130> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
American mode when we switch to the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.819 
American mode when we switch to the
other<00:02:21.400> one<00:02:21.489> it's<00:02:21.880> in<00:02:22.000> Japanese<00:02:22.180> mode<00:02:22.690> so<00:02:23.230> there

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:23.829 
other one it's in Japanese mode so there

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:26.069 
other one it's in Japanese mode so there
we<00:02:23.920> go<00:02:23.980> now<00:02:24.700> you're<00:02:25.030> probably<00:02:25.150> wondering<00:02:25.329> why

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:26.079 
we go now you're probably wondering why

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:28.199 
we go now you're probably wondering why
why<00:02:26.470> did<00:02:26.650> he<00:02:26.709> send<00:02:26.860> you<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.130> you<00:02:28.060> might

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
why did he send you this you might

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.960 
why did he send you this you might
remember<00:02:28.390> a<00:02:28.630> little<00:02:28.780> while<00:02:28.989> ago<00:02:29.170> I<00:02:30.070> would<00:02:30.610> get

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
remember a little while ago I would get

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.660 
remember a little while ago I would get
this<00:02:31.150> Gamecube<00:02:31.660> sent<00:02:31.900> to<00:02:31.989> me<00:02:32.110> in<00:02:33.070> a<00:02:33.220> trade<00:02:33.640> I

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
this Gamecube sent to me in a trade I

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.990 
this Gamecube sent to me in a trade I
did<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.060> a<00:02:34.090> guy<00:02:34.350> named<00:02:35.350> Morgan<00:02:35.620> and<00:02:35.950> I<00:02:36.730> had

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
did with a guy named Morgan and I had

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.699 
did with a guy named Morgan and I had
noticed<00:02:37.329> all<00:02:37.480> too<00:02:37.630> late<00:02:37.870> that<00:02:37.900> this<00:02:38.260> Gamecube

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
noticed all too late that this Gamecube

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.430 
noticed all too late that this Gamecube
only<00:02:38.980> has<00:02:39.220> the<00:02:39.730> AV<00:02:40.180> port<00:02:40.510> it<00:02:40.690> does<00:02:40.840> not<00:02:41.019> have

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:41.440 
only has the AV port it does not have

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:43.710 
only has the AV port it does not have
the<00:02:41.799> component<00:02:42.370> port<00:02:42.610> like<00:02:42.940> earlier<00:02:43.299> model

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:43.720 
the component port like earlier model

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.670 
the component port like earlier model
GameCubes<00:02:44.200> had<00:02:44.440> um<00:02:45.450> now<00:02:46.450> when<00:02:47.200> I<00:02:47.230> made<00:02:47.650> that

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
GameCubes had um now when I made that

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.039 
GameCubes had um now when I made that
trade<00:02:48.130> I<00:02:48.160> had<00:02:48.430> no<00:02:48.670> idea<00:02:48.850> that<00:02:49.209> Nintendo<00:02:49.810> had

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:50.049 
trade I had no idea that Nintendo had

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:52.110 
trade I had no idea that Nintendo had
removed<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.769> thing<00:02:50.980> because<00:02:51.340> you<00:02:52.000> know<00:02:52.030> I

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
removed this thing because you know I

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.819 
removed this thing because you know I
have<00:02:52.360> a<00:02:52.600> Gamecube<00:02:53.140> this<00:02:53.320> is<00:02:53.410> the<00:02:53.500> one<00:02:53.620> I've<00:02:53.709> had

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:53.829 
have a Gamecube this is the one I've had

00:02:53.829 --> 00:02:56.160 
have a Gamecube this is the one I've had
since<00:02:54.010> I<00:02:54.160> was<00:02:54.190> younger<00:02:54.519> and<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:55.630> has<00:02:55.900> the

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
since I was younger and it has the

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.410 
since I was younger and it has the
component<00:02:56.620> port<00:02:56.829> in<00:02:57.040> the<00:02:57.280> back<00:02:57.489> as<00:02:57.910> well<00:02:58.120> as

00:02:58.410 --> 00:02:58.420 
component port in the back as well as

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.660 
component port in the back as well as
the<00:02:58.989> unused<00:02:59.620> serial<00:03:00.579> port<00:03:00.880> down<00:03:01.269> there<00:03:02.370> and<00:03:03.370> so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
the unused serial port down there and so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:04.979 
the unused serial port down there and so
when<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:03.820> made<00:03:04.090> the<00:03:04.209> trade<00:03:04.450> I<00:03:04.480> was<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:04.750> okay

00:03:04.979 --> 00:03:04.989 
when I made the trade I was like okay

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.660 
when I made the trade I was like okay
well<00:03:05.170> I<00:03:05.200> want<00:03:05.470> to<00:03:05.560> back<00:03:05.680> up<00:03:05.709> GameCubes<00:03:06.400> I<00:03:06.519> don't

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
well I want to back up GameCubes I don't

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.970 
well I want to back up GameCubes I don't
want<00:03:06.790> this<00:03:06.910> GameCube<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.690> you<00:03:08.620> know<00:03:08.739> if<00:03:08.890> it

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:08.980 
want this GameCube to you know if it

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.560 
want this GameCube to you know if it
dies<00:03:09.160> and<00:03:09.489> I<00:03:09.519> have<00:03:09.640> no<00:03:09.760> Gamecube<00:03:10.180> so<00:03:10.360> that's

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:10.570 
dies and I have no Gamecube so that's

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:12.600 
dies and I have no Gamecube so that's
not<00:03:10.690> that's<00:03:10.870> a<00:03:10.989> problem<00:03:11.350> and<00:03:11.470> so<00:03:12.190> I<00:03:12.220> said<00:03:12.430> okay

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
not that's a problem and so I said okay

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.909 
not that's a problem and so I said okay
I<00:03:12.640> want<00:03:12.760> to<00:03:12.880> back<00:03:13.000> up<00:03:13.030> one<00:03:13.420> and<00:03:13.660> then<00:03:14.410> I<00:03:14.620> kind<00:03:14.859> of

00:03:14.909 --> 00:03:14.919 
I want to back up one and then I kind of

00:03:14.919 --> 00:03:16.620 
I want to back up one and then I kind of
realized<00:03:15.430> well<00:03:15.820> this<00:03:15.970> Gamecube<00:03:16.359> is<00:03:16.419> kind<00:03:16.600> of

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
realized well this Gamecube is kind of

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.990 
realized well this Gamecube is kind of
useless<00:03:16.930> to<00:03:17.199> me<00:03:17.230> because<00:03:17.680> I<00:03:18.310> have<00:03:18.970> the

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
useless to me because I have the

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.559 
useless to me because I have the
component<00:03:19.690> cables<00:03:20.019> for<00:03:20.199> it

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
component cables for it

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:22.209 
component cables for it
and<00:03:20.689> this<00:03:21.469> one<00:03:21.620> doesn't<00:03:21.769> support<00:03:22.099> it

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:22.219 
and this one doesn't support it

00:03:22.219 --> 00:03:23.559 
and this one doesn't support it
therefore<00:03:22.459> it's<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:22.819> really<00:03:23.150> a<00:03:23.180> backup

00:03:23.559 --> 00:03:23.569 
therefore it's not really a backup

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.089 
therefore it's not really a backup
GameCube<00:03:24.049> it<00:03:24.170> doesn't<00:03:24.530> really<00:03:24.650> serve<00:03:24.859> much<00:03:25.040> of

00:03:25.089 --> 00:03:25.099 
GameCube it doesn't really serve much of

00:03:25.099 --> 00:03:30.009 
GameCube it doesn't really serve much of
a<00:03:25.189> purpose<00:03:25.239> so<00:03:26.239> when<00:03:27.019> I<00:03:27.049> said<00:03:27.319> that<00:03:28.389> Joe<00:03:29.389> had<00:03:29.540> 78

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
a purpose so when I said that Joe had 78

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.099 
a purpose so when I said that Joe had 78
said<00:03:30.439> well<00:03:31.340> I<00:03:31.639> have<00:03:31.909> this<00:03:31.939> Gamecube<00:03:32.599> here<00:03:32.900> and

00:03:33.099 --> 00:03:33.109 
said well I have this Gamecube here and

00:03:33.109 --> 00:03:35.199 
said well I have this Gamecube here and
it<00:03:33.560> has<00:03:33.650> a<00:03:33.680> mod<00:03:34.010> chip<00:03:34.280> in<00:03:34.430> it<00:03:34.549> that<00:03:34.730> allows<00:03:34.969> it

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:35.209 
it has a mod chip in it that allows it

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:37.030 
it has a mod chip in it that allows it
to<00:03:35.239> play<00:03:35.510> region<00:03:35.989> free<00:03:36.230> stuff<00:03:36.499> or<00:03:36.680> it<00:03:36.769> makes<00:03:36.920> it

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
to play region free stuff or it makes it

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.039 
to play region free stuff or it makes it
region<00:03:37.340> free<00:03:37.579> essentially<00:03:38.090> or<00:03:38.689> what<00:03:38.870> well

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
region free essentially or what well

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.690 
region free essentially or what well
like<00:03:39.560> it<00:03:39.769> makes<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.069> play<00:03:40.189> American<00:03:40.609> in

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
like it makes it play American in

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.920 
like it makes it play American in
Japanese<00:03:41.090> I<00:03:41.150> don't<00:03:41.299> think<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.540> would<00:03:41.659> play

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
Japanese I don't think it would play

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.330 
Japanese I don't think it would play
anything<00:03:42.349> that's<00:03:42.530> with<00:03:42.620> European<00:03:43.129> and

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:43.340 
anything that's with European and

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:44.979 
anything that's with European and
doesn't<00:03:43.969> play<00:03:44.060> like<00:03:44.209> burn<00:03:44.420> games<00:03:44.689> or<00:03:44.840> anything

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:44.989 
doesn't play like burn games or anything

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:22.190 
makes us a lot easier so it's in

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.909 
makes us a lot easier so it's in
American<00:04:22.669> mode<00:04:22.849> right<00:04:23.030> now<00:04:23.650> go<00:04:24.650> ahead<00:04:24.800> and

00:04:34.839 --> 00:04:34.849 
system which is obviously good and then

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:36.430 
system which is obviously good and then
