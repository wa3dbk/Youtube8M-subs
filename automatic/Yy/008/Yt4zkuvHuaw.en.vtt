have<00:00:28.470> been<00:00:28.560> my<00:00:28.740> two<00:00:28.800> most<00:00:29.160> recent<00:00:29.369> project

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849 
have been my two most recent project

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.540 
have been my two most recent project
locals<00:00:30.570> with<00:00:30.900> the<00:00:31.140> third<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.800> fourth<00:00:32.040> coming

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
locals with the third and fourth coming

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:44.500 
locals with the third and fourth coming
soon<00:00:33.320> this<00:00:34.320> was<00:00:34.559> my<00:00:35.120> GF<00:00:36.120> x<00:00:39.649> 10<00:00:40.649> 21<00:00:41.690> CW<00:00:42.690> 44<00:00:43.469> and

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:44.510 
soon this was my GF x 10 21 CW 44 and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:47.060 
soon this was my GF x 10 21 CW 44 and
basically<00:00:45.510> I'm<00:00:45.690> just<00:00:45.750> waiting<00:00:46.289> to<00:00:46.320> get<00:00:46.950> this

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.070 
basically I'm just waiting to get this

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.209 
basically I'm just waiting to get this
converted<00:00:47.550> over<00:00:47.670> with<00:00:48.000> a<00:00:48.030> kt<00:00:48.930> 1000<00:00:49.860> tsunami

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
converted over with a kt 1000 tsunami

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.720 
converted over with a kt 1000 tsunami
decoder<00:00:50.930> those<00:00:51.930> are<00:00:52.110> pretty<00:00:52.469> hard<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.100> find<00:00:53.370> so

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
decoder those are pretty hard to find so

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.090 
decoder those are pretty hard to find so
they're<00:00:54.230> taking<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.469> while<00:00:55.620> to<00:00:55.649> come<00:00:55.860> in<00:00:55.980> with

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
they're taking a while to come in with

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.369 
they're taking a while to come in with
my<00:00:56.280> local<00:00:56.640> guy<00:00:56.789> but<00:00:57.300> hopefully<00:00:57.719> they<00:00:57.870> come<00:00:58.260> out

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
my local guy but hopefully they come out

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.150 
my local guy but hopefully they come out
soon<00:00:58.739> because<00:00:58.949> get<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.760> little<00:00:59.969> impatient<00:01:00.030> here

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
soon because get a little impatient here

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.979 
soon because get a little impatient here
but<00:01:02.160> that<00:01:02.399> keeping<00:01:03.090> me<00:01:03.239> busy<00:01:03.420> in<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.809> meantime

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
but that keeping me busy in the meantime

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.340 
but that keeping me busy in the meantime
obviously<00:01:04.830> was<00:01:05.119> these<00:01:06.119> two<00:01:06.360> units<00:01:06.750> over<00:01:07.020> here

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
obviously was these two units over here

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:15.260 
obviously was these two units over here
and<00:01:08.479> one<00:01:09.479> was<00:01:09.840> a<00:01:11.330> DCC<00:01:12.330> ready<00:01:13.049> sorta<00:01:14.030> and<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
and one was a DCC ready sorta and the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.100 
and one was a DCC ready sorta and the
other<00:01:15.420> was<00:01:16.100> just<00:01:17.100> it<00:01:17.850> was<00:01:17.880> an<00:01:18.119> RTR<00:01:18.600> but<00:01:18.990> it

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
other was just it was an RTR but it

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:21.920 
other was just it was an RTR but it
wasn't<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.500> DCC<00:01:20.340> ready<00:01:20.610> Catherine<00:01:21.210> RTR<00:01:21.600> so

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
wasn't the DCC ready Catherine RTR so

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.600 
wasn't the DCC ready Catherine RTR so
for<00:01:22.200> lack<00:01:22.530> of<00:01:22.560> a<00:01:22.740> better<00:01:22.770> term<00:01:23.040> i'm<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.549> to

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
for lack of a better term i'm going to

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.219 
for lack of a better term i'm going to
call<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.970> blue<00:01:24.180> box<00:01:24.380> locomotive<00:01:26.180> so<00:01:27.229> proto

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
call it a blue box locomotive so proto

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.649 
call it a blue box locomotive so proto
2000<00:01:28.920> was<00:01:29.130> kind<00:01:29.430> of<00:01:29.490> interesting<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.630> i

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
2000 was kind of interesting what i

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:32.480 
2000 was kind of interesting what i
ended<00:01:30.869> up<00:01:30.990> doing<00:01:31.049> was<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.500> actually<00:01:31.710> took<00:01:32.220> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
ended up doing was I actually took the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.060 
ended up doing was I actually took the
decoder<00:01:33.090> that<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:33.990> had<00:01:34.200> here<00:01:34.409> that<00:01:34.619> I<00:01:34.680> put<00:01:34.890> in

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
decoder that I had here that I put in

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
decoder that I had here that I put in
about<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.610> year<00:01:35.790> in<00:01:35.880> a<00:01:35.939> bit<00:01:36.090> ago<00:01:36.329> as<00:01:36.509> an

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
about a year in a bit ago as an

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.770 
about a year in a bit ago as an
emergency<00:01:36.990> and<00:01:37.970> it<00:01:38.970> was<00:01:39.090> actually<00:01:39.509> a<00:01:39.540> nce<00:01:40.460> p2k

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
emergency and it was actually a nce p2k

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.889 
emergency and it was actually a nce p2k
line<00:01:42.780> decoder<00:01:43.189> so<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.250> put<00:01:44.460> that<00:01:44.490> in<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> ptk

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
line decoder so I put that in the ptk

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.249 
line decoder so I put that in the ptk
locomotive<00:01:46.530> yeah<00:01:46.920> I<00:01:47.159> had<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.119> spare<00:01:48.420> i<00:01:48.659> had<00:01:49.229> a

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
locomotive yeah I had it spare i had a

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.139 
locomotive yeah I had it spare i had a
locomotive<00:01:49.649> hey<00:01:50.189> why<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.640> let's<00:01:50.850> get<00:01:51.000> some

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
locomotive hey why not let's get some

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.450 
locomotive hey why not let's get some
more<00:01:51.210> stuff<00:01:51.450> running<00:01:51.659> on<00:01:51.810> DCC<00:01:52.460> that

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
more stuff running on DCC that

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.340 
more stuff running on DCC that
installation<00:01:53.909> was<00:01:54.210> pretty<00:01:54.540> simple<00:01:54.840> was<00:01:55.140> just

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
installation was pretty simple was just

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.740 
installation was pretty simple was just
basically<00:01:55.799> replacing<00:01:56.729> this<00:01:56.850> little<00:01:57.180> circuit

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
basically replacing this little circuit

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.719 
basically replacing this little circuit
board<00:01:57.990> thing<00:01:58.759> here<00:01:59.759> with<00:02:00.509> the<00:02:00.630> actual<00:02:00.930> decoder

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:01.729 
board thing here with the actual decoder

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:04.069 
board thing here with the actual decoder
everything<00:02:02.729> came<00:02:02.880> into<00:02:03.180> a<00:02:03.210> wiring<00:02:03.570> harness

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
everything came into a wiring harness

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.350 
everything came into a wiring harness
connected<00:02:05.040> right<00:02:05.219> to<00:02:05.460> the

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:06.360 
connected right to the

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.080 
connected right to the
us<00:02:06.570> that's<00:02:07.290> pretty<00:02:07.740> much<00:02:07.860> it<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.399> you'll

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
us that's pretty much it so you'll

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.320 
us that's pretty much it so you'll
notice<00:02:09.240> even<00:02:09.750> though<00:02:10.520> the<00:02:11.520> headlights<00:02:12.090> are<00:02:12.300> on

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
notice even though the headlights are on

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:18.590 
notice even though the headlights are on
on<00:02:12.750> the<00:02:13.260> locomotive<00:02:13.830> itself<00:02:14.310> I<00:02:17.330> can<00:02:18.330> hit<00:02:18.450> the

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
on the locomotive itself I can hit the

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.500 
on the locomotive itself I can hit the
head<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.930> button<00:02:21.950> million<00:02:22.950> times<00:02:23.280> and<00:02:26.510> it

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
head like button million times and it

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.780 
head like button million times and it
actually<00:02:27.720> doesn't<00:02:28.020> do<00:02:28.820> butkis<00:02:30.170> locomotive<00:02:31.170> so

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:31.790 
actually doesn't do butkis locomotive so

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:34.850 
actually doesn't do butkis locomotive so
I<00:02:32.790> didn't<00:02:33.540> bother<00:02:33.570> doing<00:02:34.050> any<00:02:34.260> fancy<00:02:34.709> why

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
I didn't bother doing any fancy why

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.080 
I didn't bother doing any fancy why
aren't<00:02:35.040> the<00:02:35.100> only<00:02:35.190> thing<00:02:35.400> I<00:02:35.490> did<00:02:35.700> do<00:02:35.850> was

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
aren't the only thing I did do was

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:39.380 
aren't the only thing I did do was
replace<00:02:36.540> the<00:02:36.780> bulbs<00:02:37.170> because<00:02:38.030> seems<00:02:39.030> I've<00:02:39.180> put

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:39.390 
replace the bulbs because seems I've put

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:41.860 
replace the bulbs because seems I've put
it<00:02:39.510> on<00:02:39.600> the<00:02:39.720> tracks<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.500> bulbs<00:02:41.130> went<00:02:41.310> pop

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:41.870 
it on the tracks the bulbs went pop

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.990 
it on the tracks the bulbs went pop
those<00:02:42.870> are<00:02:43.080> the<00:02:43.140> original<00:02:43.620> 12<00:02:44.310> volt<00:02:44.489> bulbs<00:02:44.850> I

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
those are the original 12 volt bulbs I

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.260 
those are the original 12 volt bulbs I
believe<00:02:45.270> so<00:02:45.630> for<00:02:46.500> some<00:02:46.650> odd<00:02:46.680> reason<00:02:46.830> with<00:02:47.580> the

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:55.820 

micro<00:02:51.270> tronox<00:02:54.260> just<00:02:55.260> put<00:02:55.410> in<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> little

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
micro tronox just put in the little

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.449 
micro tronox just put in the little
small<00:02:56.100> bulbs<00:02:56.580> they're<00:02:57.480> a<00:02:57.950> mini<00:02:58.950> I<00:02:59.070> think<00:02:59.310> two

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
small bulbs they're a mini I think two

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:01.430 
small bulbs they're a mini I think two
millimeter<00:02:59.820> bulbs<00:03:00.300> those<00:03:01.080> are<00:03:01.260> wired

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
millimeter bulbs those are wired

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:03.979 
millimeter bulbs those are wired
directly<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.920> track<00:03:02.280> power<00:03:02.580> and<00:03:02.970> they<00:03:03.750> seem<00:03:03.959> to

00:03:03.979 --> 00:03:03.989 
directly to track power and they seem to

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:06.740 
directly to track power and they seem to
be<00:03:04.170> holding<00:03:04.350> the<00:03:04.620> wired<00:03:04.830> in<00:03:05.070> series<00:03:05.340> and<00:03:05.940> same

thing with the back unfortunately the

I<00:03:30.180> sang<00:03:30.510> one<00:03:31.350> thing<00:03:31.590> that<00:03:31.920> I<00:03:32.100> shouldn't<00:03:32.640> have

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
I sang one thing that I shouldn't have

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.060 
I sang one thing that I shouldn't have
done<00:03:32.820> to<00:03:33.060> after<00:03:33.330> locomotive<00:03:34.170> which<00:03:34.380> was<00:03:34.590> sound

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:35.070 
done to after locomotive which was sound

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:37.340 
done to after locomotive which was sound
equip<00:03:35.400> it<00:03:35.580> but<00:03:35.910> what<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.810> hell<00:03:36.989> this<00:03:37.170> is<00:03:37.230> a

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
equip it but what the hell this is a

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.890 
equip it but what the hell this is a
nice<00:03:37.590> one<00:03:37.830> out<00:03:38.820> of<00:03:38.940> all<00:03:39.060> the<00:03:39.180> Athens<00:03:39.570> I've<00:03:39.690> had

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
nice one out of all the Athens I've had

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.320 
nice one out of all the Athens I've had
this<00:03:40.110> probably<00:03:40.500> runs<00:03:40.830> the<00:03:41.010> best<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.180> use

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:42.330 
this probably runs the best and I use

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.080 
this probably runs the best and I use
the<00:03:42.510> same<00:03:42.830> mini<00:03:43.830> Atomics<00:03:44.370> micro<00:03:44.820> two

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.090 
the same mini Atomics micro two

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.180 
the same mini Atomics micro two
millimeter<00:03:45.480> bulbs<00:03:45.930> there<00:03:46.140> they're<00:03:46.860> actually

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
millimeter bulbs there they're actually

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.090 
millimeter bulbs there they're actually
looking<00:03:47.660> lot<00:03:48.660> brighter<00:03:49.080> right<00:03:49.440> now<00:03:49.650> than<00:03:49.980> they

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
looking lot brighter right now than they

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.130 
looking lot brighter right now than they
are<00:03:50.250> in<00:03:51.200> real<00:03:52.200> life<00:03:52.519> and<00:03:53.840> it's<00:03:54.840> not<00:03:54.989> just

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
are in real life and it's not just

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.330 
are in real life and it's not just
because<00:03:55.230> of<00:03:55.470> the<00:03:55.560> contrast<00:03:56.070> the<00:03:56.310> two

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:56.340 
because of the contrast the two

00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.570 
because of the contrast the two
locomotives<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.709> anyhow<00:03:58.709> in<00:03:58.950> here<00:03:59.190> I<00:03:59.220> threw

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
locomotives but anyhow in here I threw

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.930 
locomotives but anyhow in here I threw
in<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.410> t-1000<00:04:01.410> tsunami<00:04:01.830> decoder<00:04:02.220> with<00:04:02.519> an<00:04:02.640> MRC

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
in a t-1000 tsunami decoder with an MRC

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.039 
in a t-1000 tsunami decoder with an MRC
a<00:04:03.390> speaker<00:04:03.870> and<00:04:03.989> box<00:04:04.260> enclosure<00:04:04.650> and<00:04:05.390> I<00:04:06.390> think

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:07.049 
a speaker and box enclosure and I think

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.450 
a speaker and box enclosure and I think
it<00:04:07.200> did<00:04:07.350> pretty<00:04:07.620> good

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:09.460 
it did pretty good

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:13.000 
it did pretty good
again<00:04:10.460> this<00:04:10.670> was<00:04:10.910> the<00:04:11.810> blue<00:04:12.020> box<00:04:12.200> style<00:04:12.620> so<00:04:12.980> I

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
again this was the blue box style so I

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:17.470 
again this was the blue box style so I
had<00:04:13.160> to<00:04:13.420> wire<00:04:15.130> leads<00:04:16.130> from<00:04:16.400> the<00:04:16.490> trucks<00:04:16.970> from

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
had to wire leads from the trucks from

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:21.460 
had to wire leads from the trucks from
the<00:04:17.540> fame<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:19.160> the<00:04:19.280> motors<00:04:19.640> I<00:04:20.380> would<00:04:21.380> have

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
the fame to the motors I would have

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.260 
the fame to the motors I would have
shown<00:04:21.709> you<00:04:21.890> the<00:04:22.040> installation<00:04:22.640> process<00:04:22.670> of

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:23.270 
shown you the installation process of

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.030 
shown you the installation process of
this<00:04:23.450> but<00:04:23.690> I<00:04:23.720> mean<00:04:23.930> there's<00:04:24.140> no<00:04:24.500> Millie<00:04:24.830> and<00:04:25.010> a

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.040 
this but I mean there's no Millie and a

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.530 
this but I mean there's no Millie and a
half<00:04:25.220> other<00:04:25.460> people<00:04:25.820> out<00:04:25.940> there<00:04:26.150> I<00:04:26.210> need<00:04:26.390> to

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:26.540 
half other people out there I need to

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:29.200 
half other people out there I need to
but<00:04:26.950> did<00:04:27.950> a<00:04:27.980> better<00:04:28.160> job<00:04:28.280> of<00:04:28.490> it<00:04:28.700> than<00:04:28.760> I<00:04:28.970> did<00:04:29.180> so

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:29.210 
but did a better job of it than I did so

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:31.030 
but did a better job of it than I did so
I<00:04:29.450> just<00:04:29.630> rather<00:04:29.900> keep<00:04:30.020> my<00:04:30.290> work<00:04:30.470> buried<00:04:30.890> at<00:04:31.010> the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:31.040 
I just rather keep my work buried at the

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:41.470 
I just rather keep my work buried at the
moment<00:04:31.460> but

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:41.480 

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:43.670 

ever<00:04:42.480> really<00:04:42.840> had<00:04:43.020> a<00:04:43.050> chance<00:04:43.290> to<00:04:43.530> play<00:04:43.650> with

trying to fine tune it and get it to run
pretty<00:04:48.600> nicely<00:04:48.980> wouldn't<00:04:49.980> you<00:04:50.100> know<00:04:50.130> it<00:04:50.370> again

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 
pretty nicely wouldn't you know it again
