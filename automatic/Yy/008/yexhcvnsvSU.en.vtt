00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.860
 We consider model Aide 1213 thin 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:18.539
 outsole smooth out dough thick straps 

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:23.180
 3 net size of 200 45 millimeters 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.180
 sighting 250 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:31.130
 that is, here we are checking the insole to 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:36.030
 the edge itself 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:43.500
 there measurements we have indicated open your heels 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:45.739
 before the blood may be why we have 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:50.730
 It turns out not a bit obtained 

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:54.390
 big small ones in fact on 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.610
 Actually I check it now 36 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:06.530
 the size 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:06.530
 my foot is 230 millimeters then the insole 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:14.290
 fine just maybe a seal 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.290
 stick 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.970
 size is great 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:40.649
 37 would rather be 

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:44.470
 i gave me straight great 

00:01:40.649 --> 00:01:48.399
 250 millimeters is free here everything 

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:51.880
 therefore hangs on the insole two hundred 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.140
 thirty five millimeters per foot 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.380
 two hundred thirty five millimeters can 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:01.090
 36 size meaning they go 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.899
 a little bit more than usual that is 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:06.030
 gender size 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:10.229

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:10.229
