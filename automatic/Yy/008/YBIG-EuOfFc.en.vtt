00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:06.639 
after seeing this car at the Auto Salon
we<00:00:05.420> decided<00:00:05.870> it<00:00:05.990> was<00:00:06.109> time<00:00:06.319> to<00:00:06.500> visit

350z they also have in-house parts for
the<00:00:38.080> s2000<00:00:38.890> but<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.820> carbon<00:00:40.090> R<00:00:40.360> is<00:00:40.600> what

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:40.810 
the s2000 but the carbon R is what

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.799 
the s2000 but the carbon R is what
interests<00:00:41.320> us<00:00:41.410> the<00:00:41.590> most<00:00:42.540> rather<00:00:43.540> than<00:00:43.720> a

00:00:43.799 --> 00:00:43.809 
interests us the most rather than a

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:46.350 
interests us the most rather than a
simple<00:00:44.110> body<00:00:44.350> kit<00:00:44.650> almost<00:00:45.520> all<00:00:45.790> the<00:00:45.970> panels

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:46.360 
simple body kit almost all the panels

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:51.729 
simple body kit almost all the panels
have<00:00:46.450> been<00:00:46.540> replaced

00:00:51.729 --> 00:00:51.739 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:54.229 

the<00:00:52.739> normal<00:00:53.070> floor<00:00:53.340> has<00:00:53.550> also<00:00:53.730> been<00:00:54.060> removed

the normal floor has also been removed

00:00:54.239 --> 00:01:02.049 
the normal floor has also been removed
so<00:00:54.989> the<00:00:55.140> titanium<00:00:55.470> exhaust<00:00:55.770> looks<00:00:56.220> a<00:00:56.400> bit<00:00:56.550> lost
