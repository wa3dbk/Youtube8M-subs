00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 hello hello welcome to the new 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:07.109
 of historian so as promised this morning 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.670
 When I wake up, I'll do it for you 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:10.769
 will tell people that I started by 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.269
 of scrub I show you the 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.230
 ingredients that I used so I 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:18.090
 am poor relative of Maine on lees 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.590
 it is rather of a good quality help 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.990
 anyway because ben is another 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.779
 face and as you see half 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.789
 of a lemon I have not put everything so here is 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.189
 the result that it gave me I have everything 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.949
 is a bit I did not need to put 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.390
 of water since anyway I put 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:35.520
 I put lemon juice 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.930
 so now I'm going to apply myself but 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:40.079
 good that you know how to do I wanted 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 really show my daily care on 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:46.079
 will tell the party and I assure you 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.590
 than with the south for five men too 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:52.770
 well anyway with a scrub 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.129
 buy in great suffering and this 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.820
 puree that's it especially it purifies the 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:01.710
 skin before 2 masks before I 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.290
 will show you everything to their mom do not 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.380
 homemade mask that I will show you so 

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:13.640
 that's what I 'm trying to do you know how to do 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:13.640
 small circular motions 

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:25.030
 so this will be my record was there my 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:27.470
 first tito let 's say of his 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.330
 natural behavior so like 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:35.060
 usually we avoid this second contour 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:36.890
 that too I think you know I have the 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.230
 skin that shines a lot so I insist 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.530
 really on this area there zone t 

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:44.690
 I do not have for some surely you 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:49.040
 will surely be of the same problem apoel 

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:54.140
 taken a lot so I insist 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.230
 well there as you see for the points 

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.410
 black 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:59.410
 a hedge 

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:09.880
 that's a circular motion so me 

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.920
 also what I do when I have a little 

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:14.470
 more time I leave a little it is 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.300
 at mungo tribute and I come back on it 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.900
 after once it's for new 

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.390
 who wanted before rinsing me in the water 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:24.630
 warm new masks and again 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:28.810
 but it's my face which allows to 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:30.610
 even better to penetrate oneself so 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.310
 we have for the moment that we have 

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:36.190
 still not all this time I just 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.900
 a tutorial to show you so the 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.640
 100 natural scrub talking 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.860
 by the way on my page a little lower 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:49.120
 if you look at the scrubs and masks 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:56.680
 natural so here we are going to say that 

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:58.420
 for my scrub it's over so that's it 

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:01.360
 I'll take you back to the time 

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:03.700
 to tidy up my face and you 

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:06.250
 to go to the Basque stage homemade 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.500
 at any time so back so 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:11.650
 this time it's for my mask 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:14.739
 house I used so a young duff 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:16.810
 preferably at 9 well fresh just the 

00:03:14.739 --> 00:03:18.940
 young inside you that normally 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.739
 we normally put I will say 

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.359
 usually we put a soupstone 

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:23.739
 olive oil 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.209
 so I chose to put a 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:27.370
 tablespoon more coconut oil 

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:30.220
 early i think maybe it's better 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.630
 and now with you I will add 

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:35.650
 a little bit of lemon 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.920
 these games lemon I admit that the nine 

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:41.650
 I do not really like the smell ok it's going to be a 

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:44.530
 little if always in general a little 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.010
 complicated for me to pose this match 

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:52.359
 the lemon even a lot if you want 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:54.910
 to pass the smell hop let's say that 

00:03:52.359 --> 00:03:58.359
 I 'm going to add a little bit six 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.720
 trains and so that's a star that 

00:03:58.359 --> 00:04:03.820
 also benefits from a coup 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.050
 also that really there is not bad 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:10.450
 so I apply them 

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:11.590
 I wonder how I do glazed so 

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:16.390
 it's one she asked 

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:19.600
 twenty minutes at least until 

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:26.230
 you pretty much see it dry 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:28.540
 so we let ask 20 minutes you 

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:30.750
 see coconut oil at the beach of 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.570
 olive oil 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.550
 I think it's not a bad idea 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.950
 since anyway and I feel it in 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:42.330
 more so suddenly for his who are 

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:42.330
 like me and who have a little trouble with 

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:48.610
 the eyes we will say especially the low odor 

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:50.050
 with coconut oil and I think that 

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:56.220
 even with olive oil also from 

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:59.740
 anyway it breaks his audio cassette 

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:00.520
 so here I have eight of course the 

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:03.960
 warned 

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.960
 I try to be everywhere 

00:05:15.849 --> 00:05:20.520
 here 

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.139
 so I'll let ask I put 

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.449
 but much good it does not matter I 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:26.550
 let's put twenty minutes 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.310
 so it's going to leave time for me 

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.860
 prepare to get dressed to start me 

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:34.740
 prepare for like everyone 

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.409
 to go to work and so I resume 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:39.620
 I'll take you back in 20 minutes to 

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:42.590
 show you the result of 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:44.510
 of my mask actually I'm really going 

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.260
 has arisen so that you can 

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.820
 see the result 

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:50.530
 I remind you that I used so 

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:54.229
 a tablespoon of coconut oil 

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:56.630
 natural a young of fire of preference 

00:05:54.229 --> 00:05:57.770
 well fresh half of a lemon but I 

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.449
 reassure you do not put all to 

00:05:57.770 --> 00:06:02.270
 inside just a few drops 

00:05:59.449 --> 00:06:04.790
 so that's all mixed up and put 

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:07.250
 after on our village 20 minutes 

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:09.620
 minimum time it is dry 

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:12.500
 so I'm going to prepare myself there 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:12.800
 waiting as we have what he does 

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:14.630

 in the south east where my belly and 

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.669
 so my age results that mango 

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:28.220
 tribute before and my mask after 

00:06:25.669 --> 00:06:29.600
 so before after me what I could 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:31.190
 to say that I do not look a little 

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.440
 frankly it never reaches 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:36.139
 reach esata a little awake and 

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:38.030
