00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.780
 Professional what's done in the category 

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:54.950
 minimosca that is 49 kilos but nothing like 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.289
 michelle peruano always makes a 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.000
 cart and we will accept this challenge now 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:01.220
 demonstrate that our bodies to 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.720
 prove that there is no weak point of 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.640
 that always the challenge that we put on 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.009
 we'll get it for now 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.810
 I take it easy of course 

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:11.450
 it's a fight it's a latino it's a pile 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.030
 important but what I come 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.129
 preparing myself thinking many in the 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.810
 world title she approaches that I 

00:02:16.129 --> 00:02:21.110
 I'm preparing with 

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:22.880
 to that fight and wanting to win it but 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.640
 of course it is a major fight 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.590
 As I tell you, I have been ascending little by little 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.870
 first with the American title now 

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.849
 I go for the Latin and I come down from 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:33.110
 category as two or three categories or 

00:02:31.849 --> 00:02:35.599
 going down and well they are many 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.790
 sacrifices but I know bring your 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:40.730
 fruits the trainings are from Monday to 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.620
 Friday and double time however 

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:45.080
 one of the most difficult challenges for 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.330
 dew and pretty and in general for all 

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.970
 the boxers is to get to the 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.920
 weight of the category and for two 

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:56.020
 pugilists who like good food 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.750
 it is a very hard and sacrificial emission 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.000
 we have two rivals the first 

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.900
 rival is the avalanche truly understands to 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.330
 the avalanche 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.840
 is the facilitator the rival that puts us 

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:10.210
 front in my case I can get to 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.620
 to go down to 47 kilos for me is not difficult 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:13.900
 for the texture that I have my 

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:16.480
 texture is thin but if there 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:18.820
 sportsmen that we climbed a little bit to the ts 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.740
 from the space that we arrived from 

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:24.520
 make it look like the weight as countries 

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:26.680
 Always athletes and sport 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:28.990
 too much charge that we vote charge 

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:30.910
 too much energy and be with that of the 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:32.530
 diet from there like that is a little bit 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.420
 complicated but little by little 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:36.220
 Love the sport and you'll get used to 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.690
 be until when you get to the 

00:03:36.220 --> 00:03:40.390
 exact category that your organism 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.450
 requires and this habit is already done 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.480
 easy clear for me is a hammer is 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:49.360
 that is the worst rival for me because I 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.460
 like to eat well but good there is that 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.220
 that you have to take care to give good 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.800
 weight and good is a matter of giving it mental 

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.510
 to be being more the two have 

00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:01.959
 big dreams 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:04.390
 they look like world champions talent 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:07.120
 and will to spare and although it is said that 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:08.860
 dream does not cost anything they go for the 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.000
 correct path and as any 

00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:12.030
 athlete become the champion 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.890
 world to retain our title too 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.489
 but let's go step by step first we win 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.680
 the Latin title of the world council 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:22.900
 possible 20 adobe at the end of November 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.370
 let's have another fight for the emv for the 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:26.260
 world association of repeat title 

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:28.360
 Latin too but and the beat category 

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:30.310
 turbal and try to put all the 

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:31.510
 titles that come to us and if it deviates 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:34.210
 of the title could be the time 

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.289
 better yet as everything I have pure I have 

00:04:34.210 --> 00:04:37.900
 just 19 years old 

00:04:35.289 --> 00:04:39.490
 I want to continue developing in the 

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:41.470
 sports field I lack many things 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.930
 for learning many things for 

00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:46.770
 perfect but kiss able to reach 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:50.169
 to the Jewish stone fence look at this I take it 

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:52.510
 that is, it 's my career, not me, I chose this 

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.770
 I like it and I'm giving everything for 

00:04:52.510 --> 00:04:56.830
 do what I want I do not know 

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.539
 but if it is sacrificed because 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.100
 example in my case I am alone here 

00:04:58.539 --> 00:05:02.510
 living like this my family and I are in 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:05.090
 trujillo I see them from time to time 

00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:07.010
 also with the theme of party no I'm not 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:09.620
 A lot of going out I do not try to take care of myself 

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:11.330
 much like for the other day to render here 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.180
 in training because I'm 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:16.010
 training three times a day then 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:18.320
 I try to take care of myself a lot to be 

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.300
 well and prove my fight well not 

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:23.060
 because if I also neglect myself later 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.430
 they see things new up 

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:28.010
 linda and rocio have everything to do 

00:05:25.430 --> 00:05:30.440
 great boxers and how is almost a 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.350
 rule in this sport dads have their 

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:36.410
 respective nicknames to linda know her 

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:39.980
 like the triple l with the Inca princess and 

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:42.500
 to dew the flame the baby nicknames that without 

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:45.860
 no doubt they want their peculiar origin 

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:47.660
 well for my first fight point that 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:51.410
 you agree that you are my promoter 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:53.729
 jorge bartra and a mister marco maravilla 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.400

00:05:53.729 --> 00:05:57.689

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:00.059
 the fights that always presents the 

00:05:57.689 --> 00:06:01.589
 fights and then you had to be able to see and 

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:04.650
 I had not even asked myself 

00:06:01.589 --> 00:06:07.349
 then I was between the princess this 

00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:09.839
