want to make sure it is jailbroken and

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:02.219 
want to make sure it is jailbroken and
that<00:01:57.729> you<00:01:58.000> have<00:01:58.300> a<00:01:58.570> working<00:01:59.290> Wi-Fi<00:02:01.229> obviously

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
that you have a working Wi-Fi obviously

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.670 
that you have a working Wi-Fi obviously
when<00:02:02.830> in<00:02:03.310> ssh<00:02:04.090> you<00:02:04.330> cannot<00:02:04.600> use<00:02:04.750> the<00:02:04.930> cellular

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:05.680 
when in ssh you cannot use the cellular

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:08.999 
when in ssh you cannot use the cellular
network<00:02:07.170> to<00:02:08.170> connect<00:02:08.440> to<00:02:08.530> your<00:02:08.619> computer<00:02:08.740> or

00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:09.009 
network to connect to your computer or

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.610 
network to connect to your computer or
ssh<00:02:09.580> so<00:02:09.910> you'll<00:02:10.570> need<00:02:10.720> to<00:02:10.780> have<00:02:10.899> Wi-Fi<00:02:11.380> where

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
ssh so you'll need to have Wi-Fi where

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.130 
ssh so you'll need to have Wi-Fi where
they<00:02:11.740> have<00:02:11.830> an<00:02:11.950> iphone<00:02:12.280> or<00:02:12.310> ipod<00:02:12.670> touch<00:02:12.940> and<00:02:13.270> it

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
they have an iphone or ipod touch and it

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.350 
they have an iphone or ipod touch and it
obviously<00:02:14.260> needs<00:02:14.560> to<00:02:14.740> be<00:02:14.830> jailbroken<00:02:15.150> and<00:02:16.150> if

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:16.360 
obviously needs to be jailbroken and if

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.420
