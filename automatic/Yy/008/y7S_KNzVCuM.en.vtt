00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 TV viewers don't see what 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:05.879
 it lives 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:11.780
 Here is our mobile item from 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:14.059

 the application is already available on 

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:18.900
 well, or play market if you have android 

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:21.869

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.760
 setting literally 30-40 seconds to well 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.410
 probably of course nicer karakurt 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.029
 looks so huge to not about 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.560
 here so yes somehow more asks 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.470
 play around with him 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.300
 I have for example galaxy 2 unpretentious 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.250
 phone with android 4 1 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.230

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:41.940
 let me make a little louder you 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:43.320
 I do not mind personally diagnostics absolutely 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.520
 it works easily that is hatch in 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.879
 using easy to twist 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.989
 rewind selects the desired service 

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:51.030
 so perhaps friends on this 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.510
 unequivocally long war ends 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.140
 remote not only connects to 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.300
 Wi-Fi 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.340
 that is, there is no need for up to direct 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.219
 aiming sniper roofs come on now 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.589
 in the course you can from any room using 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.560
 Wi-Fi quietly switch or 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.240
 switch the channel make it quieter yes I 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:11.310
 here the picture is shorter the child begins 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 sunday morning watching tv and 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 somehow loud yes she who goes to 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.210
 the past since will always be at hand 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.549
 and very easy to use 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:23.759
 not only one home was lost cults well 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:27.420
 there i got lost sharpened it was 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.979
 now you can call my 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.950
 look the most interesting such property 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:33.990
 the remote will not be lost in any case but 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:37.140
 and now imagine such a situation we 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:40.439
 come home with you and decide what 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:42.240
 we look well as usual who 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.010
 probably comes online to watch 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:49.360
 the program schedule for the delicacy 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.140
 in fact the end saves saves then 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.870
 have to go with 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:57.450
 print computer in concert find 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:02:00.760
 program to share i'm lazy and usually about 

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:02.580
 what is the solution for you? 

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:06.700
 great cop trouble enemies 

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:08.050
 hesitated on the way friends is 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:13.390
 top of the remote tv 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:16.480
 like this all the programs are current 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:19.350
 broadcast time as programs go 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.730
 suppose yes and we can own 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:23.620
 switch by us 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:27.580
 channels see what happens 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.560
 learn see feedback on the air table 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:30.970
 orders 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:34.120
 production of the year with what can 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:35.290
 look up a brief announcement of the program and 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.990
 left two 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.320
 In my opinion it is interesting service 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.570
 reminder click ok and as soon as 

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.580
 programs will start before the TV 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:47.770
 will automatically give us an interactive 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.239
 nameplate undesirable switch to 

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:52.420
 channel of interest to you 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:54.010
 started that is principle we never 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.560
 forget that we wanted to see something 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.560
 very well and a little bit lower 

00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:06.370
 recording is also very easy 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.230
 click ok and now the case even if we 

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:09.519
 We missed the program on the gray 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.150
 automatically recorded 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:15.700
 but draw your attention what is needed 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:18.700
 some storage device good 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.200
 the number of ports leaves possibilities 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.000
 huge connects not knowing 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.360
 devices and on it already automatically 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.050
 will record specifically 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:31.880
 frame from start to finish, see below 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:35.090
 miss this moment look like 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.090
 use for recording 

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.990
 like this you can write very easily 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.360
 quite any program you are interested in 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.000
 on any carrier medium as 

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:47.180
 usb flash drive yes maybe hard drive and 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.400
 what other portable devices 

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.860
 What is interesting here further and 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.390
 put with such a situation that I do not know 

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:59.490
 what to see me is interesting sport 

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:01.890
 but I love sports just a young man 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.500
