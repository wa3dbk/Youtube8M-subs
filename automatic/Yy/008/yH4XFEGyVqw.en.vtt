relatively<00:01:31.020> early<00:01:31.200> unlock<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> recommend

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
relatively early unlock I recommend

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:34.999 
relatively early unlock I recommend
using<00:01:32.790> it<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> silencer<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.079> hardly<00:01:34.829> is

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
using it with the silencer it hardly is

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.160 
using it with the silencer it hardly is
any<00:01:35.159> Greek<00:01:35.430> boy<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.390> it's<00:01:36.659> pretty<00:01:36.960> powerful

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
any Greek boy and it's pretty powerful

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.060 
any Greek boy and it's pretty powerful
so<00:01:37.770> overall<00:01:38.340> pretty<00:01:39.299> good<00:01:39.420> combination<00:01:40.070> now

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070

vibrated so that's a huge tip that I'm
giving<00:02:45.760> the<00:02:46.209> next<00:02:46.480> thing<00:02:46.690> decide<00:02:47.320> if<00:02:47.709> you<00:02:48.250> are

extended<00:03:50.650> mags<00:03:50.859> works<00:03:51.190> very<00:03:51.579> well<00:03:51.760> so<00:03:52.329> that's

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
extended mags works very well so that's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.210 
extended mags works very well so that's
my<00:03:52.750> recommendation<00:03:52.870> there<00:03:53.560> now<00:03:53.799> a<00:03:53.829> lot<00:03:54.010> of<00:03:54.130> you

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:54.220 
my recommendation there now a lot of you

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.550 
my recommendation there now a lot of you
are<00:03:54.340> saying<00:03:54.549> oh<00:03:54.820> well<00:03:55.090> a<00:03:55.420> lot<00:03:56.049> of<00:03:56.079> it<00:03:56.290> depends

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 
are saying oh well a lot of it depends

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.610 
are saying oh well a lot of it depends
on<00:03:56.680> the<00:03:56.739> map<00:03:56.980> like<00:03:57.250> this<00:03:57.280> map<00:03:57.790> I<00:03:58.090> would<00:03:59.019> say<00:03:59.320> is

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
on the map like this map I would say is

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.229 
on the map like this map I would say is
something<00:04:00.250> that<00:04:00.370> could<00:04:00.519> be<00:04:00.670> either<00:04:00.880> way<00:04:01.180> so

00:04:01.229 --> 00:04:01.239 
something that could be either way so

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.800 
something that could be either way so
it's<00:04:01.540> preference<00:04:02.280> but<00:04:03.280> let's<00:04:03.940> say<00:04:04.150> a<00:04:04.180> map<00:04:04.510> like

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:04.810 
it's preference but let's say a map like

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.199 
it's preference but let's say a map like
nuketown<00:04:05.560> will<00:04:05.890> even<00:04:06.190> that's<00:04:06.400> preference<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
nuketown will even that's preference the

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.770 
nuketown will even that's preference the
thing<00:04:07.450> is<00:04:07.630> a<00:04:08.170> lot<00:04:08.620> of<00:04:08.769> these<00:04:08.859> maps<00:04:09.390> you<00:04:10.390> can<00:04:10.420> use

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:10.780 
thing is a lot of these maps you can use

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.099 
thing is a lot of these maps you can use
a<00:04:10.810> submachine<00:04:11.470> gun<00:04:12.120> pretty<00:04:13.120> easy<00:04:13.420> by<00:04:13.810> quite<00:04:14.079> a

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:14.109 
a submachine gun pretty easy by quite a

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:16.830 
a submachine gun pretty easy by quite a
lot<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.290> close<00:04:14.890> quarters<00:04:15.340> combat<00:04:15.370> and<00:04:15.910> you<00:04:16.690> can

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
lot of close quarters combat and you can

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.030 
lot of close quarters combat and you can
use<00:04:16.959> an<00:04:17.109> assault<00:04:17.470> rifle

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
use an assault rifle

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.190 
use an assault rifle
if<00:04:18.130> you're<00:04:18.370> careful<00:04:18.700> without<00:04:19.420> question<00:04:19.660> I

00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:20.200 
if you're careful without question I

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.350 
if you're careful without question I
mean<00:04:20.980> assault<00:04:21.280> rifles<00:04:21.610> don't<00:04:21.820> compete<00:04:22.210> with

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
mean assault rifles don't compete with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.300 
mean assault rifles don't compete with
Seven<00:04:22.660> Kingdoms<00:04:22.870> close<00:04:23.440> range<00:04:23.710> for<00:04:24.010> my<00:04:24.100> most

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310 
Seven Kingdoms close range for my most

00:04:24.310 --> 00:04:27.960 
Seven Kingdoms close range for my most
part<00:04:24.670> but<00:04:25.570> still<00:04:26.250> I<00:04:27.250> mean<00:04:27.460> so<00:04:27.610> that's<00:04:27.790> one

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:27.970 
part but still I mean so that's one

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:29.250 
part but still I mean so that's one
thing<00:04:28.060> you<00:04:28.180> got<00:04:28.330> to<00:04:28.360> figure<00:04:28.630> out<00:04:28.810> and<00:04:28.990> once<00:04:29.140> you

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
thing you got to figure out and once you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:30.810 
thing you got to figure out and once you
find<00:04:29.440> me<00:04:29.530> about<00:04:29.740> my<00:04:29.830> choice<00:04:30.100> like<00:04:30.400> once<00:04:30.580> I<00:04:30.700> got

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:30.820 
find me about my choice like once I got

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.990 
find me about my choice like once I got
the<00:04:30.970> Galil<00:04:31.300> and<00:04:31.570> putting<00:04:31.810> Silas<00:04:32.080> wrong<00:04:33.000> that's

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.000 
the Galil and putting Silas wrong that's

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.970 
the Galil and putting Silas wrong that's
when<00:04:34.180> I<00:04:34.240> started<00:04:34.630> finally<00:04:35.050> doing<00:04:35.290> good<00:04:35.500> as

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:35.980 
when I started finally doing good as

00:04:35.980 --> 00:04:38.010 
when I started finally doing good as
well<00:04:36.040> as<00:04:36.400> like<00:04:36.640> one<00:04:37.060> sec<00:04:37.270> finally<00:04:37.600> I<00:04:37.660> start<00:04:37.930> to

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
well as like one sec finally I start to

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.770 
well as like one sec finally I start to
get<00:04:38.170> getting<00:04:38.800> the<00:04:38.950> hang<00:04:39.490> of<00:04:39.610> the<00:04:39.760> m16<00:04:40.330> that<00:04:40.660> was

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
in a previous video is so worth using

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.990 
in a previous video is so worth using
just<00:05:29.440> because<00:05:29.740> no<00:05:30.040> one<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.340> shooting<00:05:30.880> it<00:05:30.970> down

our legs use the Blackbird I think once
people<00:06:04.330> start<00:06:04.870> shooting<00:06:05.200> down<00:06:05.410> air<00:06:05.710> support<00:06:06.160> I

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:06.310

might<00:06:06.550> switch<00:06:06.910> the<00:06:07.180> Blackbird<00:06:07.660> though<00:06:08.350> I

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:08.380 
might switch the Blackbird though I

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:10.530 
might switch the Blackbird though I
don't<00:06:08.560> know<00:06:08.980> how<00:06:09.160> easy<00:06:09.460> it<00:06:09.640> is<00:06:09.880> to<00:06:09.940> shoot<00:06:10.360> down

00:06:10.530 --> 00:06:10.540 
don't know how easy it is to shoot down

00:06:10.540 --> 00:06:12.240 
don't know how easy it is to shoot down
in<00:06:10.810> comparison<00:06:11.470> to<00:06:11.560> the<00:06:11.590> chopper<00:06:11.980> gunner<00:06:12.160> I

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:12.250 
in comparison to the chopper gunner I

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:16.680 
in comparison to the chopper gunner I
think<00:06:12.460> it's<00:06:12.580> a<00:06:12.670> little<00:06:13.030> harder<00:06:13.420> at<00:06:13.630> least<00:06:15.690> one

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
think it's a little harder at least one

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.230 
think it's a little harder at least one

it's<00:06:19.690> only

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
it's only
