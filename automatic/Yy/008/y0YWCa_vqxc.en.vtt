today<00:00:15.590> at<00:00:15.740> full<00:00:15.980> on<00:00:16.129> drums<00:00:16.460> calm<00:00:17.000> it's<00:00:17.300> all

00:00:17.529 --> 00:00:17.539 
today at full on drums calm it's all

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:30.510 
today at full on drums calm it's all
about<00:00:17.929> polar<00:00:18.410> patterns

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:30.520 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.800 

there<00:00:31.520> are<00:00:31.610> three<00:00:31.850> basic<00:00:32.029> types<00:00:32.270> of<00:00:32.599> polar

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:32.810 
there are three basic types of polar

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.750 
there are three basic types of polar
patterns<00:00:33.290> cardioid<00:00:33.980> omnidirectional<00:00:36.520> is<00:00:37.520> it

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 
patterns cardioid omnidirectional is it

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.310 
patterns cardioid omnidirectional is it
picks<00:00:38.120> up<00:00:38.210> predominantly<00:00:38.510> from<00:00:38.930> the<00:00:39.050> front

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:39.320 
picks up predominantly from the front

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.410 
picks up predominantly from the front
and<00:00:39.560> there's<00:00:40.130> a<00:00:40.190> significant<00:00:40.880> decrease<00:00:41.150> in

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:41.420 
and there's a significant decrease in

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.110 
and there's a significant decrease in
volume<00:00:45.070> so<00:00:46.070> now<00:00:46.190> we<00:00:46.250> have<00:00:46.489> the<00:00:46.610> mic<00:00:46.760> set<00:00:47.030> to

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:47.120 
volume so now we have the mic set to

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.729 
volume so now we have the mic set to
figure<00:00:47.420> eight<00:00:47.600> you'll<00:00:48.140> notice<00:00:48.440> that<00:00:48.530> has<00:00:48.710> a

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:48.739 
figure eight you'll notice that has a

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:57.880 
figure eight you'll notice that has a
full<00:00:49.040> signal<00:00:49.460> on<00:00:49.610> axis<00:00:50.030> like<00:00:50.239> cardioid<00:00:55.270> and<00:00:56.890> a

00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:57.890 
full signal on axis like cardioid and a

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:59.500 
full signal on axis like cardioid and a
full<00:00:58.100> signal<00:00:58.520> once<00:00:58.699> again<00:00:59.030> at<00:00:59.210> a<00:00:59.239> hundred

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
full signal once again at a hundred

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.500 
full signal once again at a hundred
eighty<00:00:59.720> degrees<00:01:00.170> off-axis<00:01:01.059> now<00:01:02.059> we're<00:01:02.270> set<00:01:02.480> to

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.510 
eighty degrees off-axis now we're set to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.390 
eighty degrees off-axis now we're set to
omni<00:01:02.989> and<00:01:03.230> you'll<00:01:03.680> notice<00:01:03.980> that<00:01:04.100> we<00:01:04.220> have<00:01:04.250> a

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:04.400 
omni and you'll notice that we have a

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.430 
omni and you'll notice that we have a
consistent<00:01:04.909> pickup<00:01:05.510> pattern<00:01:05.690> all<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.110> way

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:06.440
