an aquaponic system we need to be able

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.650 
an aquaponic system we need to be able
to<00:00:25.470> grow<00:00:25.650> a<00:00:25.830> bit<00:00:26.099> more<00:00:26.310> than<00:00:26.490> just<00:00:26.760> veggies<00:00:27.150> we

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:27.660 
to grow a bit more than just veggies we

children<00:02:02.330> trees<00:02:02.690> of<00:02:02.900> a<00:02:03.290> larger<00:02:03.710> tree<00:02:03.920> that<00:02:04.100> we

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.190 
children trees of a larger tree that we

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:06.730 
children trees of a larger tree that we
had<00:02:04.400> in<00:02:04.520> here<00:02:04.870> the<00:02:05.870> way<00:02:06.020> that<00:02:06.229> work<00:02:06.440> was

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
had in here the way that work was

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.160 
had in here the way that work was
occasionally<00:02:07.580> at<00:02:07.729> our<00:02:08.270> resident<00:02:08.690> possum

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:09.170 
occasionally at our resident possum

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.990 
occasionally at our resident possum
would<00:02:09.679> beat<00:02:09.890> me<00:02:10.040> to<00:02:10.160> the<00:02:10.280> fruit<00:02:10.550> and<00:02:10.729> make<00:02:10.970> a

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:11.000 
would beat me to the fruit and make a

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.520 
would beat me to the fruit and make a
bit<00:02:11.180> of<00:02:11.210> a<00:02:11.330> mess<00:02:11.480> of<00:02:11.600> it<00:02:11.690> so<00:02:11.870> I'd<00:02:11.990> buried<00:02:12.320> in<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
bit of a mess of it so I'd buried in the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.010 
bit of a mess of it so I'd buried in the
ground<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.000> we've<00:02:14.000> had<00:02:14.180> some<00:02:14.390> seedlings<00:02:14.810> come

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:15.020 
ground and we've had some seedlings come

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.670 
ground and we've had some seedlings come
up<00:02:15.670> quite<00:02:16.670> by<00:02:16.850> surprise<00:02:16.880> on<00:02:17.300> my<00:02:17.630> say<00:02:17.870> and<00:02:18.140> we

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:18.680 
up quite by surprise on my say and we

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.140 
up quite by surprise on my say and we
just<00:02:18.920> saved<00:02:19.250> the<00:02:19.370> fuel<00:02:19.580> then<00:02:19.700> we<00:02:19.820> put<00:02:19.970> a<00:02:20.000> load

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:20.150 
just saved the fuel then we put a load

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.400 
just saved the fuel then we put a load
them<00:02:20.270> out<00:02:20.360> and<00:02:20.540> threw<00:02:20.660> them<00:02:20.810> away<00:02:20.990> we<00:02:21.200> didn't

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
them out and threw them away we didn't

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:22.870 
them out and threw them away we didn't
really<00:02:21.500> know<00:02:21.709> what<00:02:21.890> would<00:02:22.070> happen<00:02:22.340> because

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
really know what would happen because

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.810 
really know what would happen because
these<00:02:23.330> are<00:02:23.950> hybrid<00:02:24.950> trees<00:02:25.220> we're<00:02:25.490> not<00:02:25.610> sure

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
these are hybrid trees we're not sure

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.920 
these are hybrid trees we're not sure
what<00:02:26.000> would<00:02:26.120> happen<00:02:26.420> to<00:02:26.510> them<00:02:26.630> whether<00:02:26.750> we'd

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
what would happen to them whether we'd

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:28.900 
what would happen to them whether we'd
get<00:02:27.110> true<00:02:27.500> fruit<00:02:27.740> or<00:02:27.890> not<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.610> we've<00:02:28.760> got<00:02:28.880> a

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
get true fruit or not so we've got a

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.640 
get true fruit or not so we've got a
really<00:02:29.090> good<00:02:29.240> result<00:02:29.630> so<00:02:29.840> let's<00:02:30.170> look<00:02:30.470> down

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
really good result so let's look down

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.050 
really good result so let's look down
here<00:02:30.890> in<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.100> grow<00:02:31.250> bed<00:02:31.490> and<00:02:31.670> we'll<00:02:31.790> just<00:02:31.910> show

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:32.060 
here in the grow bed and we'll just show

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:35.380 
here in the grow bed and we'll just show
you<00:02:32.120> what<00:02:32.300> the<00:02:32.390> gravel<00:02:32.690> looks<00:02:32.840> like<00:02:34.209> to<00:02:35.209> see

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:35.390 
you what the gravel looks like to see

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:38.229 
you what the gravel looks like to see
we've<00:02:35.570> had<00:02:35.860> all<00:02:36.860> this<00:02:37.070> time<00:02:37.370> so<00:02:37.700> this<00:02:37.820> gravel

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
we've had all this time so this gravel

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.360 
we've had all this time so this gravel
to<00:02:38.420> be<00:02:38.630> mature<00:02:38.840> and<00:02:39.230> the<00:02:39.590> bed<00:02:39.770> to<00:02:39.890> be<00:02:39.920> nice<00:02:40.160> and

mature and as you can see down here
there<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.370> some<00:02:43.610> a<00:02:44.680> lot<00:02:45.680> of<00:02:45.830> roots<00:02:46.070> and<00:02:46.430> the

00:02:46.509 --> 00:02:46.519 
there is some a lot of roots and the

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:48.250 
there is some a lot of roots and the
roots<00:02:46.670> of<00:02:46.910> the<00:02:47.000> poor<00:02:47.180> poor<00:02:47.390> tree<00:02:47.600> seem<00:02:47.900> to<00:02:48.050> keep

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:48.260 
roots of the poor poor tree seem to keep

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:50.050 
roots of the poor poor tree seem to keep
it<00:02:48.380> all<00:02:48.500> in<00:02:48.530> place<00:02:48.920> actually<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.519> seem<00:02:50.030> to

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:50.060 
it all in place actually and seem to

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:52.300 
it all in place actually and seem to
keep<00:02:50.330> it<00:02:50.480> well<00:02:50.660> separate<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.440> aerated<00:02:51.739> we

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:52.310 
keep it well separate and aerated we

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.710 
keep it well separate and aerated we
find<00:02:52.580> there's<00:02:52.730> not<00:02:52.850> much<00:02:53.030> rubbish<00:02:53.330> at<00:02:53.450> all<00:02:53.570> in

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:53.720 
find there's not much rubbish at all in

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.330 
find there's not much rubbish at all in
this<00:02:53.810> bed<00:02:54.080> even<00:02:54.709> though<00:02:54.800> it<00:02:54.860> gets<00:02:55.040> all<00:02:55.190> the

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
this bed even though it gets all the

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.400 
this bed even though it gets all the
same<00:02:55.610> amount<00:02:56.239> of<00:02:56.300> material<00:02:56.420> delivered<00:02:57.140> to<00:02:57.290> it

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
same amount of material delivered to it

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.690 
same amount of material delivered to it
by<00:02:58.130> the<00:02:58.190> fish<00:02:59.980> here<00:03:00.980> we<00:03:01.100> can<00:03:01.220> see<00:03:01.400> the<00:03:01.519> water

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
by the fish here we can see the water

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.460 
by the fish here we can see the water
flowing<00:03:02.120> into<00:03:02.269> the<00:03:02.570> corner<00:03:03.080> of<00:03:03.170> the<00:03:03.260> Brocade

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470 
flowing into the corner of the Brocade

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:05.770 
flowing into the corner of the Brocade
we<00:03:03.769> have<00:03:03.980> just<00:03:04.220> one<00:03:04.430> single<00:03:04.670> entry<00:03:05.000> point<00:03:05.030> this

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
we have just one single entry point this

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.150 
we have just one single entry point this
is<00:03:05.930> coming<00:03:06.200> in<00:03:06.320> from<00:03:06.500> the<00:03:06.620> fish<00:03:06.799> tank<00:03:07.070> and<00:03:09.160> at

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
is coming in from the fish tank and at

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.670 
is coming in from the fish tank and at
this<00:03:10.280> end<00:03:10.519> we<00:03:10.640> have<00:03:10.670> the<00:03:11.030> auto<00:03:11.180> siphon<00:03:11.680> the

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
this end we have the auto siphon the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.650 
this end we have the auto siphon the
device<00:03:13.040> that<00:03:13.280> drains<00:03:13.580> it<00:03:13.790> every<00:03:14.180> time<00:03:14.360> the<00:03:14.510> bed

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:14.660 
device that drains it every time the bed

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:17.380 
device that drains it every time the bed
fills<00:03:14.930> so<00:03:15.200> the<00:03:15.320> bed<00:03:15.470> fills<00:03:15.769> and<00:03:16.100> drains<00:03:16.820> every

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:17.390 
fills so the bed fills and drains every

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.180 
fills so the bed fills and drains every
time<00:03:17.600> it<00:03:17.750> fills<00:03:17.959> up<00:03:18.110> the<00:03:18.410> auto<00:03:18.560> siphon<00:03:18.830> kicks

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:19.190 
time it fills up the auto siphon kicks

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:22.420 
time it fills up the auto siphon kicks
in<00:03:19.400> drains<00:03:20.390> it<00:03:20.570> out<00:03:20.720> rapidly<00:03:21.650> and<00:03:21.799> then<00:03:22.160> shuts

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:22.430 
in drains it out rapidly and then shuts

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:23.890 
in drains it out rapidly and then shuts
off<00:03:22.610> from<00:03:22.790> the<00:03:22.880> bed<00:03:23.030> fills<00:03:23.269> again<00:03:23.510> so<00:03:23.750> we're

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
off from the bed fills again so we're

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.720 
off from the bed fills again so we're
always<00:03:24.049> filling<00:03:24.470> and<00:03:24.590> draining<00:03:25.310> filling<00:03:25.610> and

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:25.730 
always filling and draining filling and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.240 
always filling and draining filling and
draining<00:03:26.090> on<00:03:26.180> these<00:03:26.870> poor<00:03:27.140> poor<00:03:27.350> beds<00:03:27.560> works

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
draining on these poor poor beds works

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.900 
draining on these poor poor beds works
really<00:03:28.580> really<00:03:28.730> well<00:03:30.700> there's<00:03:31.700> only<00:03:31.790> one

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:31.910 
really really well there's only one

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:33.910 
really really well there's only one
downside<00:03:32.540> to<00:03:32.600> growing<00:03:32.959> poor<00:03:33.260> poor<00:03:33.440> trees<00:03:33.680> in<00:03:33.860> a

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
downside to growing poor poor trees in a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.670 
downside to growing poor poor trees in a
bed<00:03:34.070> like<00:03:34.250> this<00:03:34.459> and<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.480> that<00:03:35.959> the<00:03:36.140> clear

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
bed like this and that is that the clear

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.039 
bed like this and that is that the clear
space<00:03:37.070> in<00:03:37.430> the<00:03:37.519> bottom<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.880> the<00:03:37.970> bed<00:03:38.180> is<00:03:38.720> really

00:03:39.039 --> 00:03:39.049 
space in the bottom of the bed is really

00:03:39.049 --> 00:03:40.960 
space in the bottom of the bed is really
unusable<00:03:39.980> for<00:03:40.010> growing<00:03:40.310> other<00:03:40.519> plants

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
unusable for growing other plants

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
and cutting out direct sunlight so we've

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:47.770 
and cutting out direct sunlight so we've
tried<00:03:46.519> on<00:03:46.670> numerous<00:03:46.970> occasions<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.600> grow

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
lettuce and to grow cucumbers tried all

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.030 
lettuce and to grow cucumbers tried all
sorts<00:03:50.090> of<00:03:50.389> things<00:03:50.450> but<00:03:50.840> the<00:03:51.440> growth<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:51.799> really

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:52.040 
sorts of things but the growth is really

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.250 
sorts of things but the growth is really
not<00:03:52.190> very<00:03:52.220> good<00:03:52.480> so<00:03:53.480> that's<00:03:53.660> the<00:03:53.810> downside<00:03:54.230> of

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
not very good so that's the downside of

a few weeks later before we saw any
result<00:04:20.700> but<00:04:21.390> the<00:04:21.510> seeds<00:04:21.720> have<00:04:21.840> come<00:04:22.050> up<00:04:22.170> and

result but the seeds have come up and

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:23.960 
result but the seeds have come up and
we've<00:04:22.530> got<00:04:22.560> two<00:04:22.920> beautiful<00:04:23.250> poor<00:04:23.610> poor<00:04:23.760> trees

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:23.970 
we've got two beautiful poor poor trees

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.420 
we've got two beautiful poor poor trees
coming<00:04:24.210> on<00:04:24.390> here<00:04:24.600> you<00:04:25.200> can<00:04:25.350> see<00:04:25.560> look<00:04:26.280> at<00:04:26.370> that

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430 
coming on here you can see look at that

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.210 
coming on here you can see look at that
now<00:04:27.330> they<00:04:27.570> they<00:04:28.260> we're<00:04:28.440> in<00:04:28.560> little<00:04:28.740> tiny<00:04:28.920> seed

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:29.220 
now they they we're in little tiny seed

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.710 
now they they we're in little tiny seed
pots<00:04:29.520> and<00:04:29.790> they've<00:04:30.060> been<00:04:30.270> there<00:04:30.420> what<00:04:30.690> about

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
pots and they've been there what about

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.840 
pots and they've been there what about
four<00:04:31.140> weeks<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.500> think<00:04:31.740> that's<00:04:32.580> about<00:04:32.790> all

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
four weeks I think that's about all

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.370 
four weeks I think that's about all
they're<00:04:33.150> really<00:04:33.180> starting<00:04:33.870> to<00:04:33.900> take<00:04:34.170> off<00:04:34.320> now

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:34.380 
they're really starting to take off now

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.590 
they're really starting to take off now
so<00:04:35.190> we're<00:04:35.370> hoping<00:04:35.700> we'll<00:04:35.850> get<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.180> really<00:04:36.450> good

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:36.600 
so we're hoping we'll get a really good

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:40.570 
so we're hoping we'll get a really good
crop<00:04:36.780> from<00:04:36.930> these<00:04:37.140> fellows<00:04:37.470> as<00:04:37.740> well<00:04:38.360> and

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
crop from these fellows as well and

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.160 
crop from these fellows as well and
another<00:04:41.580> couple<00:04:42.060> of<00:04:42.120> trees<00:04:42.390> we've<00:04:42.600> planned<00:04:42.900> we

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.170 
another couple of trees we've planned we

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:45.140 
another couple of trees we've planned we
bought<00:04:43.380> from<00:04:43.830> the<00:04:43.980> nursery<00:04:44.310> on<00:04:44.580> the<00:04:44.730> 2nd<00:04:45.090> of

of March so they are where this is about

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.790 
of March so they are where this is about
five<00:04:50.880> months<00:04:51.210> old<00:04:51.390> and<00:04:51.750> you<00:04:51.810> can<00:04:52.320> see<00:04:52.500> how<00:04:52.650> well

five months old and you can see how well

00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:54.250 
five months old and you can see how well
they're<00:04:52.950> doing<00:04:52.980> just<00:04:53.370> look<00:04:53.490> at<00:04:53.580> this<00:04:53.670> proofing

beautiful strong and going really tall
we've<00:04:57.870> already<00:04:58.020> had<00:04:58.290> to<00:04:58.440> put<00:04:59.070> a<00:04:59.100> string<00:04:59.370> on<00:04:59.490> it

00:04:59.630 --> 00:04:59.640 
we've already had to put a string on it

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.970 
we've already had to put a string on it
to<00:05:00.600> stop<00:05:00.810> it<00:05:00.900> from<00:05:00.990> falling<00:05:01.080> over<00:05:01.410> because

to stop it from falling over because

to stop it from falling over because
that's<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.400> of<00:05:02.460> the<00:05:02.550> problems<00:05:02.850> with<00:05:02.970> poor

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:03.120 
that's one of the problems with poor

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.000 
that's one of the problems with poor
poor<00:05:03.300> trees<00:05:03.540> even<00:05:04.080> when<00:05:04.410> they<00:05:04.500> grown<00:05:04.710> out<00:05:04.890> on

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:05.010 
poor trees even when they grown out on

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:07.190 
poor trees even when they grown out on
the<00:05:05.100> farm<00:05:05.340> they<00:05:06.060> tend<00:05:06.330> to<00:05:06.480> fall<00:05:06.840> over<00:05:07.020> because

00:05:07.190 --> 00:05:07.200 
the farm they tend to fall over because

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.080 
the farm they tend to fall over because
the<00:05:07.470> weight<00:05:07.650> of<00:05:07.680> the<00:05:07.890> fruit<00:05:08.100> gets<00:05:08.310> so<00:05:08.520> heavy

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090 
the weight of the fruit gets so heavy

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.970 
the weight of the fruit gets so heavy
and<00:05:09.690> these<00:05:09.960> of<00:05:10.140> course<00:05:10.260> are<00:05:10.410> being<00:05:10.590> pushed<00:05:10.800> out

and these of course are being pushed out

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:12.410 
and these of course are being pushed out
a<00:05:11.040> bit<00:05:11.280> because<00:05:11.430> they're<00:05:11.730> growing<00:05:11.940> in<00:05:12.150> amongst

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
a bit because they're growing in amongst
