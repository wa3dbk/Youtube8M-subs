edges together just to seal and once

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:47.270 
edges together just to seal and once
you've<00:03:45.420> got<00:03:45.540> the<00:03:45.599> parcel<00:03:45.750> shape<00:03:46.109> just<00:03:46.650> pinch

00:03:55.309 --> 00:03:55.319 
of rough crimp all the way down and this

00:03:55.319 --> 00:03:56.869 
of rough crimp all the way down and this
will<00:03:55.440> also<00:03:55.590> help<00:03:55.739> to<00:03:55.980> give<00:03:56.099> it<00:03:56.220> an<00:03:56.340> extra<00:03:56.730> level

00:03:56.869 --> 00:03:56.879 
will also help to give it an extra level
