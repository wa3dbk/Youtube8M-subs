00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.110
 all zdarova region ripped action and 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:15.410
 you know that we have already started a fit of 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.410
 page 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.030
 all healthy dear friends for midone 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.400
 you are flexible and you already know what lang 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.619
 steven start 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:34.230
 global project is not a simple project 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.820
 global naruto spy playsplay 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.920
 than from her for what rountree 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.750
 yes they are already on the channel at 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:42.450
 least 1 issue well at the moment when 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:46.830
 filmed video filmed on November 1 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:49.020
 no one tastes like that 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.699
 for what I went to buy a gamepad 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:56.820
 By the way, here it is, and today I’m 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:01:01.290
 I'll tell you this thing I bought in nikse 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:03.510
 It costs 851 ruble and on the website for some reason 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:06.000
 that was 60 kopecks but media 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.540
 is it possible well there is no better so here to 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:13.710
 Unfortunately, the only negative is the wire 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:18.090
 yes it’s really a minus but it’s easy 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.320
 cool cool and maintained in 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.290
 games for windows 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.020
 as it is almost boxing ski joystick 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.030
 many special gifts buttons shorter 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.180
 let me show you now 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.640
 that yes like mine in the comments that he had 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.549
 good that it is not very good well 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.979
 and stuff 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.530
 knew in what format how to write all this 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:45.030
 because I don't have a tripod 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:48.060
 something like here's a controller, here is a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.130
 here he is all pretty all of 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.679
 graders are more comfortable 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:56.280
 I will try to make everything light 

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:57.689
 It was very clearly visible and a mark like 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.170
 a thousand so do that all would be good 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.939
 Larina here so here gamepad let's 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.369
 let's see what we have to carry it in front 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.289
 generally by the way incomprehensible color here 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:09.360
 here he has his black bet 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:11.820
 very so y dark navy blue it's cool 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.120
 but it seems that he is black but not but so 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:18.210
 here on top of us loggatec in the middle is 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.980
 button calls the panel games for 

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:22.110
 windows instead of clicking on 

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:25.680
 home key on the keyboard 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.450
 the select key and the start of the mod is pure 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.760
 for me 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.580
 incomprehensible just here we have 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.760
 cross is the most common 4 position but 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:38.670
 still added as if the position 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.980
 press between the keys that is in general 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:43.980
 8 position even has two 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:46.050
 analog sticks i.e. it is usually for 

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.030
 moving this moving camera then 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:50.010
 everything is standard and here we have 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.110
 there is the most standard for x-box 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:53.910
 the layout would say keyboard but 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.760
 not a joystick this is whitby 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:00.120
 and x i.e. most standard commands 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.780
 saw off where something is still there and something 

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.989
 there still 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:10.320
 Well, you understand here with us as usual 

00:03:03.989 --> 00:03:14.220
 There is everything I can not teach rbt brt 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:16.500
 lt that is left right and everything is very convenient 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:18.180
 pressed cool as I said 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:21.510
 the only negative is this wire 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:24.209
 it has a length of about 2 meters or a meter 

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:27.170
 eighty will be more accurate but in 

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:30.630
 In principle, I don’t bother me there at all 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:32.910
 then given that we have a joystick 

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.390
 wired there is no battery there 

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:40.080
 all sorts of emblems and badges of the type of 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.810
 loyalty certified and other stuff 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.239
 subject and there is also here 

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:48.570
 switch with x-bow saveskaya 

00:03:45.239 --> 00:03:51.299
 layouts on usually that is given 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:54.120
 joystick my computer can consider 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:58.799
 like a joystick from an xbox attack 

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:02.340
 joystick which instead of letters and numbers and 

00:03:58.799 --> 00:04:04.410
 1234 well I think you know as far as 

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:04.920
 the appearance of this joystick is essentially 

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.720
 everything 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.900
 the only thing I want to mention 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:19.200
 it really easy to do it is necessary to cool 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:22.290
 Clearly in general, the rakat plays as for 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:24.810
 races I didn’t really try because 

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:28.229
 but it seems to me not to play with tics 

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.930
 much though all the players know in the shooters I 

00:04:28.229 --> 00:04:33.120
 also did not try but still can 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:36.300
 then try to head this already 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.729
 year to make out I played in the hole there and 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.100
 with you I shot with the joystick 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:43.590
 paints letts play sheet so much 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.840
 more convenient than poking on the keyboard 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.060
 no one knows where because these 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:51.449
 the keys replace the button more precisely for me 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:54.270
 with keys all this is complete anarchy 

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:57.449
 I also have a couple more games this is new 

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:59.910
 marvel screen lego marvel side then i 

00:04:57.449 --> 00:05:01.500
 try this gabe she play him 

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.509
 what about us playoffs with him raspberries for 

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.650
 see also there is another game about 

00:05:03.509 --> 00:05:09.150
 which I did a review 

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:11.400
 it's also for joystick but i don't know 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.410
 will this joystick go if yes thats 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.030
 very cool here is such a wonderful 

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:17.490
 joystick lozhitek 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:22.009
 oh yeah the most important thing is not forgotten i forgot 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:27.720
 say how is the model who is called 

00:05:22.009 --> 00:05:30.630
 she is called f310 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:33.780
 but, in principle, to withdraw this one on for not 

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:36.240
 seen shipped such a hybrid 

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:39.330
 shit ski box I had to 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:41.430
 break I thought to save it is not enough 

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:43.440
 that the gamepad is not very yes and so back 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.539
 bear to have some kind of civil look 

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.280
 here there are such special things 

00:05:45.539 --> 00:05:49.260
 by which I could tear off very much 

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:52.710
 rejoiced real I began to open a 

00:05:49.260 --> 00:05:55.260
 then opa all pike freaked out and dodgers 

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:57.570
 and the gap here is not clear 

00:05:55.260 --> 00:06:00.090
 instructions like that there is nothing there 

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:01.919
 There is a quart code and cam connection 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:05.460
 confused eight figure seven whist and so 

00:06:01.919 --> 00:06:08.009
 Further other crap and there is such a 

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:09.840
 here is a mukla of turin I don't know what they even 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:13.229
 I'm afraid to hide it, I think at all 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.789
 nobody really needs it now 

00:06:13.229 --> 00:06:16.740
 what I wanted to tell you about this joystick 

00:06:14.789 --> 00:06:18.240
 Salon handfuls if there is any 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.020
 ask questions write 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:22.349
 I repeat once again what this thing is worth 

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.560
 850 rubles 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:28.190
 Put signs the price lanton Like Now 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.190
 this joystick 

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:31.280
 until
