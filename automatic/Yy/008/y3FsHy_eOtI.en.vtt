its way through the abyss increase in
rate<00:01:48.570> it<00:01:49.409> is<00:01:49.590> worth<00:01:49.799> noting<00:01:50.130> however<00:01:50.280> not<00:01:50.970> if

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
rate it is worth noting however not if

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.580 
rate it is worth noting however not if
you<00:01:51.180> are<00:01:51.329> being<00:01:51.540> swarmed<00:01:51.810> by<00:01:51.960> lots<00:01:52.290> of<00:01:52.409> melee

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
you are being swarmed by lots of melee

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.770 
you are being swarmed by lots of melee
enemies<00:01:52.799> like<00:01:53.369> thrall<00:01:53.670> then<00:01:54.240> there<00:01:54.360> is<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.479> very

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
enemies like thrall then there is a very

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.389 
enemies like thrall then there is a very
brief<00:01:55.049> cooldown<00:01:55.350> period<00:01:55.500> between<00:01:56.159> each

brief cooldown period between each

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.459 
brief cooldown period between each
activation<00:01:56.909> which<00:01:57.420> effectively<00:01:57.840> equates<00:01:58.200> to

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
activation which effectively equates to

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.889 
activation which effectively equates to
every<00:01:58.890> other<00:01:59.040> hit<00:01:59.450> obviously<00:02:00.450> if<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> space

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
effect will trigger every time but what

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:07.789 
effect will trigger every time but what
about<00:02:05.670> damage<00:02:06.060> well<00:02:06.869> as<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.229> can<00:02:07.320> clearly<00:02:07.439> see

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
about damage well as you can clearly see

and the enemies are briefly stunned and
damaged<00:02:29.819> you<00:02:30.269> then<00:02:30.420> follow<00:02:30.569> up<00:02:30.780> with<00:02:30.810> a<00:02:31.079> speedy

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:31.469

melee attack to finish the job

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:35.240 
melee attack to finish the job
obviously<00:02:34.049> on<00:02:34.200> stronger<00:02:34.560> enemies<00:02:34.859> for

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
obviously on stronger enemies for

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.580 
obviously on stronger enemies for
example<00:02:35.609> fallen<00:02:35.909> captains<00:02:36.329> or<00:02:36.540> -<00:02:36.840> whores<00:02:37.049> you

example fallen captains or - whores you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.020 
example fallen captains or - whores you
could<00:02:37.799> expect<00:02:38.099> this<00:02:38.189> to<00:02:38.370> remove<00:02:38.639> their<00:02:38.790> shield

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
could expect this to remove their shield

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.119 
could expect this to remove their shield
perhaps<00:02:39.719> do<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> little<00:02:40.049> bit<00:02:40.200> of<00:02:40.260> damage<00:02:40.379> but<00:02:41.040> it

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:41.129 
perhaps do a little bit of damage but it

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.860 
perhaps do a little bit of damage but it
obviously<00:02:41.430> won't<00:02:41.639> do<00:02:41.879> quite<00:02:42.120> so<00:02:42.269> much<00:02:42.480> but

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
obviously won't do quite so much but

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.280 
obviously won't do quite so much but
then<00:02:43.620> what<00:02:43.799> about<00:02:43.829> PvP<00:02:44.549> well<00:02:45.269> if<00:02:45.659> I'm<00:02:45.840> honest<00:02:46.109> I

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.290 
then what about PvP well if I'm honest I

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:48.080 
then what about PvP well if I'm honest I
really<00:02:46.319> don't<00:02:46.889> think<00:02:47.040> this<00:02:47.250> item<00:02:47.430> is<00:02:47.730> designed

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
really don't think this item is designed

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:50.839 
really don't think this item is designed
for<00:02:48.239> PvP<00:02:48.689> sure<00:02:49.470> it<00:02:49.919> might<00:02:50.099> be<00:02:50.220> useful<00:02:50.549> in<00:02:50.730> an

00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:50.849 
for PvP sure it might be useful in an

00:02:50.849 --> 00:02:52.550 
for PvP sure it might be useful in an

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:10.550 
by melee attacks these days and if I do
it's<00:03:09.120> usually<00:03:09.359> one<00:03:09.780> of<00:03:09.810> those<00:03:09.959> one-shot<00:03:10.379> ones

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
it's usually one of those one-shot ones

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.289 
it's usually one of those one-shot ones
that<00:03:10.859> would<00:03:11.010> have<00:03:11.129> killed<00:03:11.340> me<00:03:11.430> anyway<00:03:11.760> so<00:03:12.209> the

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
that would have killed me anyway so the

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
I personally drop them in a crucible

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.589 
I personally drop them in a crucible
simply<00:03:29.010> because<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.459> very<00:03:29.549> rarely<00:03:29.909> benefited

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:30.599

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.449 
simply because I very rarely benefited

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:35.699 
game and I personally think the exact

00:03:35.699 --> 00:03:38.000 
game and I personally think the exact
same<00:03:35.909> applies<00:03:36.239> to<00:03:36.510> the<00:03:36.959> ACE<00:03:37.109> t0<00:03:37.620> feedback

same applies to the ACE t0 feedback
fence<00:03:38.250> so<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.269> question<00:03:39.599> still<00:03:39.750> remains<00:03:39.810> with

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:40.650 
fence so the question still remains with

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.499

everything<00:03:41.010> I've<00:03:41.099> just<00:03:41.129> said<00:03:41.340> are<00:03:41.970> these<00:03:42.269> any

everything I've just said are these any

everything I've just said are these any
good<00:03:42.780> and<00:03:42.959> if<00:03:43.379> so<00:03:43.620> where<00:03:44.310> should<00:03:44.549> you<00:03:44.669> use<00:03:44.849> them

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.349 
good and if so where should you use them
and<00:03:45.479> the<00:03:45.659> answer<00:03:45.959> is<00:03:46.349> yes<00:03:46.620> at<00:03:47.129> times<00:03:47.579> and<00:03:47.879> most
