00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
help it all along I think that's where I

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.080 
help it all along I think that's where I
got<00:02:23.880> into<00:02:24.060> a<00:02:24.240> lot<00:02:24.540> of<00:02:24.600> trouble<00:02:25.080> now<00:02:25.950> after<00:02:26.910> I'm

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
got into a lot of trouble now after I'm

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.850 
got into a lot of trouble now after I'm
having<00:02:27.510> a<00:02:27.600> smoothie<00:02:27.990> or<00:02:28.110> fruit<00:02:28.380> meal<00:02:28.560> I<00:02:28.620> try<00:02:28.800> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
having a smoothie or fruit meal I try to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.530 
having a smoothie or fruit meal I try to
get<00:02:29.040> there<00:02:29.190> and<00:02:29.310> brush<00:02:29.520> it<00:02:29.730> within<00:02:29.910> 20<00:02:30.390> minutes

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
get there and brush it within 20 minutes

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.440 
get there and brush it within 20 minutes
because<00:02:30.930> I<00:02:31.140> read<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.130> bacteria<00:02:32.850> starts<00:02:33.270> to

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
because I read that bacteria starts to

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:36.050 
because I read that bacteria starts to
double<00:02:34.140> in<00:02:34.380> 20<00:02:35.130> minutes<00:02:35.430> so<00:02:35.520> the<00:02:35.610> longer<00:02:35.970> you

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
double in 20 minutes so the longer you

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.640 
double in 20 minutes so the longer you
let<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.210> go<00:02:36.420> good<00:02:36.690> to<00:02:36.780> get<00:02:36.930> more<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.350> more<00:02:37.530> and

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
let it go good to get more and more and

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.200 
let it go good to get more and more and
more<00:02:37.710> so<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.040> kind<00:02:38.220> of<00:02:38.280> want<00:02:38.430> to<00:02:38.490> nip<00:02:38.940> that<00:02:38.970> in

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:39.210 
more so you kind of want to nip that in

fruit for that very reason so avoid them

just<00:03:27.900> regular<00:03:28.500> brushing<00:03:29.190> and<00:03:29.340> flossing<00:03:29.640> are

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
just regular brushing and flossing are

just regular brushing and flossing are
huge<00:03:30.870> -<00:03:31.260> I<00:03:31.530> think<00:03:31.680> where<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.100> got<00:03:32.310> into<00:03:32.430> trouble

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
huge - I think where I got into trouble

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:35.180 
huge - I think where I got into trouble
over<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.150> past<00:03:33.450> year<00:03:33.810> I<00:03:33.989> was<00:03:34.350> kind<00:03:34.800> of<00:03:34.860> being

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
over the past year I was kind of being

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:36.800 
over the past year I was kind of being
laxed<00:03:35.730> on<00:03:35.820> my<00:03:35.940> brushing<00:03:36.390> I<00:03:36.480> didn't<00:03:36.660> brush

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
laxed on my brushing I didn't brush

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.199 
laxed on my brushing I didn't brush
maybe<00:03:37.290> once<00:03:37.709> or<00:03:37.950> twice<00:03:38.010> a<00:03:38.310> day<00:03:38.610> instead<00:03:38.940> I<00:03:38.970> was

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:39.209 
maybe once or twice a day instead I was

00:03:39.209 --> 00:03:41.390 
maybe once or twice a day instead I was
kind<00:03:39.450> of<00:03:39.510> relying<00:03:39.900> on<00:03:40.110> this<00:03:40.320> oral<00:03:41.100> irrigator

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
kind of relying on this oral irrigator

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:44.390 
kind of relying on this oral irrigator
thing<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.540> sprays<00:03:42.900> water<00:03:42.930> into<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.830> gums<00:03:44.190> to

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
thing it sprays water into the gums to

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.240 
thing it sprays water into the gums to
get<00:03:44.880> all<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.090> stuff<00:03:45.390> out<00:03:45.630> and<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.070> think<00:03:47.070> I<00:03:47.130> was

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
get all the stuff out and I think I was

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.100 
get all the stuff out and I think I was
relying<00:03:47.580> on<00:03:47.790> that<00:03:47.940> too<00:03:48.209> much<00:03:48.420> and<00:03:48.750> not

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
relying on that too much and not

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.470 
relying on that too much and not
brushing<00:03:49.530> enough<00:03:50.310> and<00:03:50.580> I<00:03:50.970> think<00:03:51.000> that's<00:03:51.330> where

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:51.480 
brushing enough and I think that's where

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.210 
brushing enough and I think that's where
I<00:03:51.540> really<00:03:51.690> got<00:03:51.900> into<00:03:52.110> trouble<00:03:52.470> so<00:03:52.590> now<00:03:52.680> like<00:03:53.130> I

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:53.220 
I really got into trouble so now like I

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.040 
I really got into trouble so now like I
said<00:03:53.459> I'll<00:03:53.700> brush<00:03:53.940> right<00:03:54.239> after<00:03:54.600> a<00:03:54.630> meal<00:03:54.720> so

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
said I'll brush right after a meal so

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.870 
said I'll brush right after a meal so
I'm<00:03:55.140> brushing<00:03:55.350> like<00:03:55.590> three<00:03:55.860> four<00:03:56.130> times<00:03:56.489> a<00:03:56.850> day

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:56.880 
I'm brushing like three four times a day

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.270 
I'm brushing like three four times a day
and<00:03:57.300> make<00:03:57.840> sure<00:03:57.989> you<00:03:58.110> floss<00:03:58.500> once<00:03:58.950> a<00:03:59.100> day

00:03:59.270 --> 00:03:59.280 
and make sure you floss once a day

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:01.040 
and make sure you floss once a day
because<00:03:59.519> flossing<00:04:00.120> gets<00:04:00.300> into<00:04:00.480> places<00:04:00.930> where

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:01.050 
because flossing gets into places where

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.710 
because flossing gets into places where
the<00:04:01.890> oral<00:04:02.190> irrigator<00:04:02.370> can't<00:04:02.940> get<00:04:03.090> into<00:04:03.360> and<00:04:03.660> it

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
the oral irrigator can't get into and it

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.990 
the oral irrigator can't get into and it
gets<00:04:03.900> into<00:04:04.050> places<00:04:04.440> that<00:04:04.470> brushing<00:04:05.459> we<00:04:05.910> know

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
gets into places that brushing we know

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.390 
gets into places that brushing we know
brush<00:04:06.269> can't<00:04:06.570> get<00:04:06.720> into<00:04:07.019> lastly<00:04:07.980> if<00:04:08.100> I<00:04:08.220> could

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
brush can't get into lastly if I could

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.210 
brush can't get into lastly if I could
go<00:04:08.519> back<00:04:08.760> in<00:04:08.970> time<00:04:09.080> to<00:04:10.080> being<00:04:10.410> 20<00:04:10.769> years<00:04:10.950> old

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
go back in time to being 20 years old

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.400 
go back in time to being 20 years old
again<00:04:11.549> here's<00:04:12.150> the<00:04:12.239> biggest<00:04:12.690> thing<00:04:13.019> the

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
again here's the biggest thing the

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.470 
again here's the biggest thing the
biggest<00:04:13.440> change<00:04:14.040> I<00:04:14.220> would<00:04:14.370> make<00:04:14.549> I<00:04:14.790> got<00:04:15.209> really

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
biggest change I would make I got really

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.270 
biggest change I would make I got really
lacks<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:16.109> my<00:04:16.229> twenties<00:04:16.590> about<00:04:16.830> going<00:04:17.100> to<00:04:17.190> the

lacks in my twenties about going to the
dentist<00:04:17.700> I<00:04:17.880> probably<00:04:18.120> used<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> go<00:04:18.900> maybe<00:04:19.080> like

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
dentist I probably used to go maybe like

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.870 
dentist I probably used to go maybe like
once<00:04:19.530> every<00:04:19.799> year<00:04:19.830> so<00:04:20.340> when<00:04:20.459> I<00:04:20.519> was<00:04:20.609> younger

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
once every year so when I was younger

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.520 
once every year so when I was younger
and<00:04:21.209> when<00:04:21.479> I<00:04:21.539> got<00:04:21.750> into<00:04:21.900> college<00:04:21.959> and

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
and when I got into college and

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.590 
and when I got into college and
thereafter<00:04:22.710> I'd<00:04:23.130> go<00:04:23.280> once<00:04:23.520> every<00:04:23.910> five<00:04:24.570> years

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:24.600 
thereafter I'd go once every five years

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.490 
thereafter I'd go once every five years
or<00:04:25.229> something<00:04:25.380> like<00:04:25.680> that

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:26.500 
or something like that

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.860 
or something like that
two-way<00:04:26.710> meant<00:04:27.010> too<00:04:27.190> much<00:04:27.340> time<00:04:27.670> for<00:04:28.060> plaque

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:28.870 
two-way meant too much time for plaque

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.610 
two-way meant too much time for plaque
and<00:04:29.730> just<00:04:30.730> just<00:04:30.910> buildup<00:04:31.390> on<00:04:31.540> teeth<00:04:32.170> causing

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
and just just buildup on teeth causing

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.280 
and just just buildup on teeth causing
my<00:04:33.310> gums<00:04:33.580> to<00:04:33.790> recede<00:04:34.150> and<00:04:34.300> gum<00:04:34.780> disease<00:04:34.930> is<00:04:35.260> a

my gums to recede and gum disease is a

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.140 
my gums to recede and gum disease is a
thing<00:04:35.530> that<00:04:35.560> happens<00:04:36.040> over<00:04:36.370> time<00:04:36.400> you<00:04:36.880> really

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
thing that happens over time you really

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:39.300 
thing that happens over time you really
don't<00:04:37.330> get<00:04:37.510> it<00:04:37.660> in<00:04:37.810> your<00:04:38.110> 20s<00:04:38.560> it<00:04:38.710> takes<00:04:38.920> a<00:04:39.040> few

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
don't get it in your 20s it takes a few

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.120 
don't get it in your 20s it takes a few
decades<00:04:40.000> of<00:04:40.600> neglect<00:04:40.840> for<00:04:41.470> it<00:04:41.560> to<00:04:41.650> start<00:04:41.860> happy

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:42.130 
decades of neglect for it to start happy

00:04:42.130 --> 00:04:43.920 
decades of neglect for it to start happy
if<00:04:42.430> I<00:04:42.490> started<00:04:42.940> seeing<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.270> in<00:04:43.360> my<00:04:43.390> early<00:04:43.900> 40s

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
if I started seeing it in my early 40s

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:46.500 
if I started seeing it in my early 40s
so<00:04:44.470> if<00:04:44.530> I<00:04:44.590> could<00:04:44.680> go<00:04:44.920> back<00:04:45.190> in<00:04:45.340> time<00:04:45.370> I<00:04:45.880> would<00:04:46.360> go

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
so if I could go back in time I would go

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:48.570 
so if I could go back in time I would go
to<00:04:46.570> the<00:04:46.720> dentist<00:04:47.080> more<00:04:47.230> often<00:04:47.650> not<00:04:48.130> only<00:04:48.190> just
