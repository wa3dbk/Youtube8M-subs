00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:56.949 
the students in the beginning when they
don't<00:03:54.639> when<00:03:55.639> they're<00:03:55.790> brand<00:03:56.120> new<00:03:56.269> they<00:03:56.780> don't

00:03:56.949 --> 00:03:56.959 
don't when they're brand new they don't

00:03:56.959 --> 00:03:58.479 
don't when they're brand new they don't
even<00:03:57.079> know<00:03:57.379> how<00:03:57.650> close<00:03:57.919> to<00:03:58.099> death<00:03:58.129> they<00:03:58.459> are

00:03:58.479 --> 00:03:58.489 
even know how close to death they are

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:00.939 
even know how close to death they are
half<00:03:58.819> the<00:03:59.000> time<00:03:59.209> they'll<00:04:00.109> do<00:04:00.319> something<00:04:00.590> and

00:04:00.939 --> 00:04:00.949 
half the time they'll do something and

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:02.800 
half the time they'll do something and
they<00:04:01.519> think<00:04:01.729> that<00:04:01.819> it<00:04:01.970> was<00:04:02.060> actually<00:04:02.389> good<00:04:02.569> and

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:02.810 
they think that it was actually good and

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.509 
they think that it was actually good and
then<00:04:03.229> in<00:04:03.530> the<00:04:03.620> debrief<00:04:03.919> you<00:04:04.040> have<00:04:04.159> to<00:04:04.220> say<00:04:04.340> well

00:04:04.509 --> 00:04:04.519 
then in the debrief you have to say well

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:06.369 
then in the debrief you have to say well
you<00:04:04.639> almost<00:04:04.909> killed<00:04:05.209> us<00:04:05.299> actually<00:04:05.750> so<00:04:06.049> this<00:04:06.260> is

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
you almost killed us actually so this is

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:08.949 
you almost killed us actually so this is
why<00:04:06.500> we<00:04:06.620> need<00:04:06.769> to<00:04:06.799> talk<00:04:06.979> about<00:04:07.220> this<00:04:07.419> as<00:04:08.419> a

00:04:08.949 --> 00:04:08.959 
why we need to talk about this as a

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:11.080 
why we need to talk about this as a
student<00:04:09.530> you<00:04:09.889> know<00:04:09.979> you're<00:04:10.250> always<00:04:10.459> kind<00:04:10.940> of

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
student you know you're always kind of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.569 
student you know you're always kind of
nervous<00:04:11.930> about<00:04:12.079> that<00:04:12.409> next<00:04:12.739> sortie<00:04:13.190> you're

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:13.579 
nervous about that next sortie you're

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:14.949 
nervous about that next sortie you're
always<00:04:13.729> kind<00:04:14.030> of<00:04:14.150> wondering<00:04:14.569> what<00:04:14.780> are<00:04:14.900> the

00:04:14.949 --> 00:04:14.959 
always kind of wondering what are the

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:16.899 
always kind of wondering what are the
real<00:04:15.169> expectations<00:04:16.039> what<00:04:16.280> I<00:04:16.310> really<00:04:16.699> need<00:04:16.820> to

00:04:16.899 --> 00:04:16.909 
real expectations what I really need to

00:04:16.909 --> 00:04:19.120 
real expectations what I really need to
know<00:04:17.090> what<00:04:17.900> I<00:04:17.930> really<00:04:18.260> need<00:04:18.409> to<00:04:18.440> do<00:04:18.650> and<00:04:18.979> it's

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
know what I really need to do and it's

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.909 
know what I really need to do and it's
hard<00:04:19.400> to<00:04:19.489> have<00:04:19.699> a<00:04:19.729> judgement<00:04:20.599> of<00:04:20.769> what<00:04:21.769> you

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
hard to have a judgement of what you

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.810 
hard to have a judgement of what you
need<00:04:22.070> to<00:04:22.159> know<00:04:22.280> when<00:04:22.490> you<00:04:22.550> don't<00:04:22.669> have

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
need to know when you don't have

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:26.320 
need to know when you don't have
experience<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.990> back<00:04:24.289> that<00:04:24.530> up<00:04:24.940> hunger<00:04:25.940> I<00:04:25.970> fly

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:26.330 
experience to back that up hunger I fly

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.930 
experience to back that up hunger I fly
the<00:04:27.260> more<00:04:27.470> I<00:04:27.500> anticipate<00:04:28.250> the<00:04:28.400> mistakes<00:04:28.760> that

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:28.940 
the more I anticipate the mistakes that

00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:30.820 
the more I anticipate the mistakes that
they're<00:04:29.090> going<00:04:29.240> to<00:04:29.360> make<00:04:29.510> because<00:04:29.750> all<00:04:30.560> the

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:30.830 
they're going to make because all the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.409 
they're going to make because all the
students<00:04:31.159> make<00:04:31.400> pretty<00:04:31.880> much<00:04:32.090> the<00:04:32.240> same

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:32.419 
students make pretty much the same

00:04:32.419 --> 00:04:34.149 
students make pretty much the same
mistakes<00:04:32.780> so<00:04:32.960> after<00:04:33.320> a<00:04:33.349> few<00:04:33.440> classes<00:04:33.830> you

00:04:34.149 --> 00:04:34.159 
mistakes so after a few classes you

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:36.850 
mistakes so after a few classes you
start<00:04:34.430> to<00:04:34.639> see<00:04:35.630> the<00:04:35.750> mistakes<00:04:35.870> developing<00:04:36.740> and

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
start to see the mistakes developing and

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:38.860 
start to see the mistakes developing and
it's<00:04:36.949> almost<00:04:37.130> like<00:04:37.370> you<00:04:37.669> can<00:04:37.849> just<00:04:38.570> sit<00:04:38.720> in<00:04:38.810> the

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:38.870 
it's almost like you can just sit in the

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:42.129 
it's almost like you can just sit in the
back<00:04:39.020> seat<00:04:39.050> watch<00:04:39.860> their<00:04:40.400> helmets<00:04:40.849> and<00:04:41.139> see

00:04:42.129 --> 00:04:42.139 
back seat watch their helmets and see

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:43.450 
back seat watch their helmets and see
when<00:04:42.349> they're<00:04:42.469> about<00:04:42.650> to<00:04:42.710> make<00:04:42.919> a<00:04:42.979> mistake

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:43.460 
when they're about to make a mistake

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.400 
when they're about to make a mistake
and<00:04:43.730> so<00:04:44.060> I'll<00:04:44.180> see<00:04:44.330> the<00:04:44.480> mistake<00:04:44.810> developing

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:45.410 
and so I'll see the mistake developing

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:47.050 
and so I'll see the mistake developing
see<00:04:45.950> that<00:04:46.100> what<00:04:46.220> they're<00:04:46.370> all<00:04:46.670> mostly<00:04:46.880> what

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
see that what they're all mostly what

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.590 
see that what they're all mostly what
they're<00:04:47.180> thinking

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:47.600 
they're thinking

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.270 
they're thinking
and<00:04:47.750> the<00:04:48.320> whole<00:04:48.440> time<00:04:48.650> I<00:04:48.680> just<00:04:48.830> want<00:04:49.100> to<00:04:49.160> either

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:49.280 
and the whole time I just want to either

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.120 
and the whole time I just want to either
say<00:04:49.520> something<00:04:49.970> or<00:04:50.500> fix<00:04:51.500> it<00:04:51.740> and<00:04:51.890> sometimes

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
say something or fix it and sometimes

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.070 
say something or fix it and sometimes
you<00:04:52.370> have<00:04:52.580> to<00:04:52.700> just<00:04:52.730> let<00:04:53.060> them<00:04:53.150> let<00:04:53.810> them<00:04:53.870> make

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.080 
you have to just let them let them make

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:56.590 
you have to just let them let them make
the<00:04:54.200> mistake<00:04:54.530> if<00:04:55.490> you<00:04:55.550> start<00:04:55.880> out<00:04:56.000> flying<00:04:56.330> with

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:56.600 
the mistake if you start out flying with

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.440 
the mistake if you start out flying with
them<00:04:56.810> and<00:04:57.730> of<00:04:58.730> course<00:04:58.820> you're<00:04:59.060> not<00:04:59.150> gonna<00:04:59.300> do
