00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
that have been experimenting with lately

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:00.120 
that have been experimenting with lately
the<00:01:55.210> vintage<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.380> sounds<00:01:57.160> amazing<00:01:58.050> on<00:01:59.050> 12<00:01:59.440> 14<00:01:59.890> 16

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:00.130 
the vintage a sounds amazing on 12 14 16

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:02.940 
the vintage a sounds amazing on 12 14 16
and<00:02:00.670> all<00:02:01.180> really<00:02:01.750> blend<00:02:02.320> nicely<00:02:02.590> together

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and all really blend nicely together

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
got the right sound man and the brain

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.590 
got the right sound man and the brain
mics<00:02:10.570> on<00:02:10.810> it<00:02:11.020> and<00:02:11.290> it<00:02:11.620> sounds<00:02:12.070> amazing<00:02:12.190> so<00:02:13.120> I'm

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:13.600 
mics on it and it sounds amazing so I'm

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:16.110 
mics on it and it sounds amazing so I'm
using<00:02:13.810> the<00:02:14.080> coated<00:02:14.500> powerstroke<00:02:15.370> 3<00:02:15.400> on<00:02:16.060> my

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
using the coated powerstroke 3 on my

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.470 
using the coated powerstroke 3 on my
bass<00:02:16.900> drums<00:02:17.340> definitely<00:02:18.340> over<00:02:18.430> the<00:02:18.489> 26<00:02:19.060> is<00:02:19.269> I

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:19.480 
bass drums definitely over the 26 is I

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:21.600 
bass drums definitely over the 26 is I
use<00:02:19.959> the<00:02:20.110> power<00:02:20.769> stroke<00:02:21.010> three<00:02:21.250> pretty<00:02:21.459> much

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
use the power stroke three pretty much

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:24.690 
use the power stroke three pretty much
on<00:02:21.760> everything<00:02:22.390> except<00:02:23.320> the<00:02:23.500> occasional<00:02:23.700> 18

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:24.700 
on everything except the occasional 18

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.160 
on everything except the occasional 18
if<00:02:25.060> it's<00:02:25.209> really<00:02:25.450> going<00:02:25.540> to<00:02:25.630> be<00:02:25.720> a<00:02:25.750> jazz<00:02:25.989> thing

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
if it's really going to be a jazz thing

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.199 
if it's really going to be a jazz thing
I'll<00:02:26.440> use<00:02:26.620> an<00:02:26.769> ambassador<00:02:27.340> with<00:02:27.549> a<00:02:27.580> felt<00:02:27.850> strip

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
I'll use an ambassador with a felt strip

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:31.289 
I'll use an ambassador with a felt strip
but<00:02:28.930> a<00:02:29.290> lot<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.340> things<00:02:30.730> that<00:02:30.820> I<00:02:30.910> do<00:02:31.120> with<00:02:31.239> a

00:02:31.289 --> 00:02:31.299 
but a lot of things that I do with a

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.530 
but a lot of things that I do with a
groove<00:02:31.600> oriented<00:02:32.220> with<00:02:33.220> an<00:02:33.370> 18<00:02:33.730> so<00:02:34.180> I'll<00:02:34.360> use

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
groove oriented with an 18 so I'll use

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.690 
groove oriented with an 18 so I'll use
the<00:02:34.660> 18<00:02:34.989> with<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.350> power<00:02:35.680> of<00:02:35.920> 3<00:02:36.220> it<00:02:36.400> sounds

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
the 18 with the power of 3 it sounds

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.960 
the 18 with the power of 3 it sounds
great<00:02:36.940> it<00:02:37.360> sounds<00:02:37.420> also<00:02:38.140> on<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.320> 22<00:02:38.830> I've<00:02:39.820> been

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
great it sounds also on a 22 I've been

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.940 
great it sounds also on a 22 I've been
on<00:02:40.060> the<00:02:40.209> 20<00:02:40.570> as<00:02:40.720> well<00:02:41.080> it's<00:02:41.470> what<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.650> meant<00:02:41.860> to

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:41.950 
on the 20 as well it's what I meant to

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.880 
on the 20 as well it's what I meant to
say<00:02:41.980> I<00:02:42.340> don't<00:02:43.269> really<00:02:43.390> play<00:02:43.570> 20<00:02:43.900> 22<00:02:44.290> so<00:02:44.560> like<00:02:44.739> a

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:44.890 
say I don't really play 20 22 so like a

00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:50.280 
say I don't really play 20 22 so like a
teens<00:02:45.220> are<00:02:45.580> like<00:02:47.160> 20s<00:02:48.160> at<00:02:48.430> like<00:02:48.640> 26<00:02:49.390> s<00:02:49.570> and<00:02:50.170> I

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:50.290 
teens are like 20s at like 26 s and I

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:52.500 
teens are like 20s at like 26 s and I
think<00:02:50.560> I've<00:02:50.709> come<00:02:50.920> to<00:02:51.070> realize<00:02:51.400> why<00:02:51.790> some<00:02:52.480> of

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
think I've come to realize why some of

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.060 
think I've come to realize why some of
that<00:02:52.660> might<00:02:52.959> be

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
that might be

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.229 
that might be
with<00:02:54.519> an<00:02:54.640> 18<00:02:55.019> the<00:02:56.019> the<00:02:56.650> beaters<00:02:57.190> hitting<00:02:57.790> above

00:02:58.229 --> 00:02:58.239 
with an 18 the the beaters hitting above

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:01.500 
with an 18 the the beaters hitting above
center<00:02:58.870> so<00:02:59.440> it's<00:03:00.190> getting<00:03:00.730> a<00:03:00.850> resonant<00:03:01.330> sound

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:01.510 
center so it's getting a resonant sound

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.960 
center so it's getting a resonant sound
but<00:03:01.930> the<00:03:02.019> 20th<00:03:02.500> getting<00:03:02.830> a<00:03:02.980> little<00:03:03.250> bit<00:03:03.519> closer

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:03.970 
but the 20th getting a little bit closer

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:06.090 
but the 20th getting a little bit closer
Center<00:03:04.510> well<00:03:04.900> the<00:03:04.959> 22<00:03:05.380> is<00:03:05.500> right<00:03:05.830> in<00:03:05.980> the

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:06.100 
Center well the 22 is right in the

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.530 
Center well the 22 is right in the
center<00:03:06.370> day<00:03:06.489> to<00:03:06.700> me<00:03:06.850> it's<00:03:07.030> just<00:03:07.090> kind<00:03:07.390> of<00:03:07.420> a

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
center day to me it's just kind of a

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:10.110 
center day to me it's just kind of a
dense<00:03:07.810> sound<00:03:08.140> but<00:03:08.709> they<00:03:08.829> went<00:03:09.010> to<00:03:09.070> 26<00:03:09.280> the

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:10.120 
dense sound but they went to 26 the

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.910 
dense sound but they went to 26 the
beater<00:03:10.360> is<00:03:10.600> below<00:03:11.019> the<00:03:11.290> center<00:03:11.650> so<00:03:11.799> you're

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
beater is below the center so you're

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.140 
beater is below the center so you're
getting<00:03:12.250> again<00:03:12.700> you<00:03:13.120> get<00:03:13.299> a<00:03:13.329> real<00:03:13.600> resin

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
getting again you get a real resin

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.850 
getting again you get a real resin
sound<00:03:14.390> just<00:03:14.900> like<00:03:14.989> with<00:03:15.200> a<00:03:15.230> timpani<00:03:15.530> you

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:15.860 
sound just like with a timpani you

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.080 
sound just like with a timpani you
wouldn't<00:03:16.099> to<00:03:16.220> hit<00:03:16.340> it<00:03:16.430> in<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.549> center<00:03:16.819> of<00:03:16.970> the

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
wouldn't to hit it in the center of the

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.569 
wouldn't to hit it in the center of the
drum<00:03:17.239> you<00:03:17.480> want<00:03:17.629> to<00:03:17.689> hit<00:03:17.870> in<00:03:18.829> an<00:03:19.040> area<00:03:19.400> that's

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
drum you want to hit in an area that's

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.089 
drum you want to hit in an area that's
not<00:03:19.849> the<00:03:20.510> center<00:03:20.810> and<00:03:20.959> not<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.230> edge<00:03:21.379> because

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:22.099 
not the center and not the edge because

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:23.740 
not the center and not the edge because
with<00:03:22.489> the<00:03:22.610> edge<00:03:22.730> you<00:03:22.970> get<00:03:23.120> kind<00:03:23.360> of<00:03:23.420> too<00:03:23.599> much

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:23.750 
with the edge you get kind of too much

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:28.300 
with the edge you get kind of too much
of<00:03:23.959> a<00:03:24.909> ringy<00:03:26.200> doughy<00:03:27.200> kind<00:03:27.799> of<00:03:27.860> sound<00:03:28.099> so

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
of a ringy doughy kind of sound so

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.160 
of a ringy doughy kind of sound so
you've<00:03:28.430> got<00:03:28.549> to<00:03:28.640> find<00:03:28.790> that<00:03:28.909> sweet<00:03:29.209> spot<00:03:29.269> so<00:03:30.110> to

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170 
you've got to find that sweet spot so to

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.289 
you've got to find that sweet spot so to
me<00:03:30.530> there's<00:03:30.829> an<00:03:30.950> inherent<00:03:31.099> sweet<00:03:31.640> spot<00:03:31.909> on<00:03:32.150> the

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
me there's an inherent sweet spot on the

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:35.349 
me there's an inherent sweet spot on the
18<00:03:32.689> and<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:32.989> sick<00:03:33.200> and<00:03:33.379> the<00:03:33.500> 26<00:03:34.239> where<00:03:35.239> the

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:35.359 
18 and the sick and the 26 where the

00:03:35.359 --> 00:03:38.740 
18 and the sick and the 26 where the
beater<00:03:35.599> is<00:03:35.780> hitting<00:03:36.140> so<00:03:36.739> I<00:03:37.269> found<00:03:38.269> that<00:03:38.540> you

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:38.750 
beater is hitting so I found that you

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:40.149 
beater is hitting so I found that you
know<00:03:38.840> I've<00:03:38.959> started<00:03:39.290> to<00:03:39.439> notice<00:03:39.470> that<00:03:39.859> lately

00:03:40.149 --> 00:03:40.159 
know I've started to notice that lately

00:03:40.159 --> 00:03:42.610 
know I've started to notice that lately
that's<00:03:40.459> why<00:03:40.760> I<00:03:40.819> kind<00:03:41.420> of<00:03:41.510> gravitate<00:03:42.260> towards

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
that's why I kind of gravitate towards

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:46.479 
that's why I kind of gravitate towards

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:54.650 
chance to check that out but it seems

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.589
