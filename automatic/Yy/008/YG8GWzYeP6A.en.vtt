00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.990 
fixings it's important that we work
safely<00:00:32.169> so<00:00:32.590> we're<00:00:32.860> using<00:00:33.070> kneepads<00:00:33.640> because

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:34.000 
safely so we're using kneepads because

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.100 
safely so we're using kneepads because
we're<00:00:34.180> going<00:00:34.270> to<00:00:34.360> be<00:00:34.420> spending<00:00:34.750> quite<00:00:34.930> a<00:00:34.989> bit

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.479 
when the fixing is made you could also
use<00:03:35.720> a<00:03:35.750> combined<00:03:36.200> drill<00:03:36.470> bit<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.860> counselling

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
use a combined drill bit and counselling

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.940 
use a combined drill bit and counselling
if<00:03:37.640> you<00:03:37.849> have<00:03:38.000> one<00:03:38.440> now<00:03:39.440> position<00:03:39.920> the

if you have one now position the

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.800 
if you have one now position the
skirting<00:03:40.430> board<00:03:40.610> against<00:03:40.940> the<00:03:41.150> wall<00:03:41.299> and<00:03:41.450> mark

00:03:43.539 --> 00:03:43.549 
up the exact position where the wall

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:45.550 
up the exact position where the wall
needs<00:03:43.760> to<00:03:43.879> be<00:03:44.000> drilled<00:03:44.239> for<00:03:44.450> each<00:03:44.569> fixing<00:03:45.079> by

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
needs to be drilled for each fixing by

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.410 
needs to be drilled for each fixing by
pushing<00:03:45.829> a<00:03:46.010> long<00:03:46.189> nail<00:03:46.430> or<00:03:46.640> screw<00:03:46.760> through<00:03:47.269> it

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:47.420 
pushing a long nail or screw through it

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.649 
pushing a long nail or screw through it
until<00:03:47.930> it<00:03:48.049> marks<00:03:48.379> the<00:03:48.440> wall<00:03:48.650> surface<00:03:49.659> remove

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:50.659 
until it marks the wall surface remove

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:52.119 
until it marks the wall surface remove
the<00:03:50.900> skirting<00:03:51.170> board<00:03:51.349> and<00:03:51.650> check<00:03:51.859> that<00:03:52.010> you

00:03:52.119 --> 00:03:52.129 
the skirting board and check that you

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:54.550 
the skirting board and check that you
can<00:03:52.280> see<00:03:52.430> every<00:03:52.849> mark<00:03:53.120> if<00:03:53.329> not<00:03:54.019> repeat<00:03:54.440> the

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
can see every mark if not repeat the

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:58.629 
can see every mark if not repeat the
process<00:03:55.599> now<00:03:56.599> we<00:03:56.659> can<00:03:56.989> drill<00:03:57.230> the<00:03:57.470> wall<00:03:57.639> this

00:03:58.629 --> 00:03:58.639 
process now we can drill the wall this

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:00.819 
process now we can drill the wall this
wall<00:03:58.940> is<00:03:59.090> dry<00:03:59.389> lined<00:03:59.690> which<00:04:00.319> means<00:04:00.560> there's<00:04:00.769> a

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
wall is dry lined which means there's a

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.559 
wall is dry lined which means there's a
space<00:04:01.099> between<00:04:01.129> the<00:04:01.609> plaster<00:04:02.120> board<00:04:02.299> and<00:04:02.480> the

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:02.569 
space between the plaster board and the

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:04.300 
space between the plaster board and the
block<00:04:02.780> work<00:04:03.049> so<00:04:03.680> we're<00:04:03.859> going<00:04:04.010> to<00:04:04.159> use<00:04:04.280> a

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
block work so we're going to use a

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.360 
block work so we're going to use a
longer<00:04:04.670> masonry<00:04:05.269> drill<00:04:05.389> bit<00:04:05.690> to<00:04:05.840> make<00:04:06.019> holes

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.370 
longer masonry drill bit to make holes

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.789 
longer masonry drill bit to make holes
our<00:04:07.370> screws<00:04:07.849> are<00:04:08.000> 75<00:04:08.569> millimeter<00:04:09.200> by<00:04:09.500> 4

00:04:09.789 --> 00:04:09.799 
our screws are 75 millimeter by 4

00:04:09.799 --> 00:04:11.949 
our screws are 75 millimeter by 4
millimeter<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:10.940> we<00:04:11.090> need<00:04:11.299> to<00:04:11.480> drill<00:04:11.720> holes

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
millimeter so we need to drill holes

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.869 
millimeter so we need to drill holes
that<00:04:12.109> are<00:04:12.170> approximately<00:04:12.920> 80<00:04:13.190> millimetres

00:04:13.869 --> 00:04:13.879 
that are approximately 80 millimetres

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.199 
that are approximately 80 millimetres
deep<00:04:14.060> if<00:04:14.989> you<00:04:15.230> wrap<00:04:15.440> masking<00:04:16.070> tape<00:04:16.340> around<00:04:16.549> the

00:04:17.199 --> 00:04:17.209 
deep if you wrap masking tape around the

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:19.810 
deep if you wrap masking tape around the
drill<00:04:17.449> bit<00:04:17.690> at<00:04:17.959> 80<00:04:18.530> millimetres<00:04:19.310> from<00:04:19.459> the<00:04:19.669> end

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
drill bit at 80 millimetres from the end

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:22.330 
drill bit at 80 millimetres from the end
then<00:04:20.660> you'll<00:04:20.900> know<00:04:21.079> to<00:04:21.139> stop<00:04:21.530> drilling<00:04:21.799> when

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
then you'll know to stop drilling when

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:25.270 
then you'll know to stop drilling when
you<00:04:22.460> reach<00:04:22.699> down<00:04:23.060> to<00:04:23.389> the<00:04:23.419> masking<00:04:23.900> tape<00:04:24.280> once

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
you reach down to the masking tape once

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.159 
you reach down to the masking tape once
the<00:04:25.430> holes<00:04:25.610> are<00:04:25.760> drilled<00:04:25.880> we<00:04:26.599> can<00:04:26.750> insert<00:04:27.050> the

the holes are drilled we can insert the
