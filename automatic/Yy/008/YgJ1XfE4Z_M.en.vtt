very<00:05:11.060> very<00:05:11.300> competitive<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.200> think<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:12.710> was<00:05:12.800> an

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:12.890 
very very competitive I think it was an

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.680 
very very competitive I think it was an
eye-opening<00:05:13.460> experience<00:05:13.490> because<00:05:14.300> up<00:05:14.480> and<00:05:14.630> to

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:14.690 
eye-opening experience because up and to

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.480 
eye-opening experience because up and to
that<00:05:14.840> point<00:05:14.870> he'd<00:05:15.530> never<00:05:15.710> dealt<00:05:16.100> with<00:05:16.250> the<00:05:16.340> guy

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
that point he'd never dealt with the guy

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.700 
that point he'd never dealt with the guy
that<00:05:17.000> was<00:05:17.180> a<00:05:17.390> top<00:05:17.780> level<00:05:18.020> guy<00:05:18.320> now<00:05:18.650> he

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:18.710 
that was a top level guy now he

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:20.830 
that was a top level guy now he
understands<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.640> okay<00:05:19.970> this<00:05:20.210> is<00:05:20.270> that<00:05:20.570> next

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:20.840 
understands and okay this is that next

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:23.260 
understands and okay this is that next
level<00:05:21.080> got<00:05:21.740> himself<00:05:21.890> in<00:05:22.340> shape<00:05:22.400> and<00:05:22.910> ready<00:05:23.060> to

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:23.270 
level got himself in shape and ready to

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:26.200 
level got himself in shape and ready to
go<00:05:23.450> against<00:05:24.020> the<00:05:24.110> top<00:05:24.320> guys<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.890> you<00:05:25.460> know<00:05:25.550> had

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:26.210 
go against the top guys and you know had

00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:27.430 
go against the top guys and you know had
that<00:05:26.419> end<00:05:26.720> of<00:05:26.900> that<00:05:27.020> fight<00:05:27.229> with<00:05:27.350> an

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:27.440 
that end of that fight with an

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.860 
that end of that fight with an
exclamation<00:05:27.710> plus<00:05:28.250> a<00:05:28.280> joke<00:05:28.850> on<00:05:29.030> Jon<00:05:29.300> Fitch<00:05:29.630> the

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:29.870 
exclamation plus a joke on Jon Fitch the

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:31.540 
exclamation plus a joke on Jon Fitch the
probably<00:05:30.380> would<00:05:30.500> have<00:05:30.560> finished<00:05:30.770> those<00:05:31.130> guys

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
probably would have finished those guys

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:33.430 
probably would have finished those guys
so<00:05:32.120> that<00:05:32.240> I<00:05:32.270> mean<00:05:32.450> I<00:05:32.479> think<00:05:32.660> this<00:05:32.960> is<00:05:33.140> a<00:05:33.169> guy<00:05:33.380> to

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:33.440 
so that I mean I think this is a guy to

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.960 
so that I mean I think this is a guy to
watch<00:05:33.800> out<00:05:34.040> for<00:05:34.070> I've<00:05:34.370> been<00:05:34.520> saying<00:05:34.729> it<00:05:34.850> for

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:34.970

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
the last year or so and I think this is

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.740
