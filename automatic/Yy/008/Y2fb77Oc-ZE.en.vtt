00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
improving the scarring system but it

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:50.030 
improving the scarring system but it
will<00:02:46.890> be<00:02:47.630> pretty<00:02:48.630> intense<00:02:49.110> when<00:02:49.530> some<00:02:49.799> done

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:50.040

after yourself the aging system will be

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:53.449 
after yourself the aging system will be
completely<00:03:51.299> dynamic<00:03:51.540> you<00:03:52.230> will<00:03:52.349> still<00:03:52.590> what
