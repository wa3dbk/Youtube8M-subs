00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:15.770
 once chosen the board 

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:17.750
 distribution and fixed already in that housing 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.180
 now we have to select the 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.430
 magnetic thermo switch for this 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.740
 first we must know what it is for 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.330
 the non- magnetic switch the 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.789
 thermomagnetic switches comply 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.640
 a very important function that is that of 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:34.220
 protect overloads and short circuits 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.780
 that are generated in a facility 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:42.170
 Interior therefore your choice and your 

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:44.360
 protection is very important the criterion 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:46.909
 basic that you have to consider when 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:50.059
 of choosing a magnetic thermos is quality 

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.670
 and the main parameters with which 

00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:55.280
 each of these is indicated 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.650
 devices to identify the 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:01.850
 main parameters we take into account 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.190
 four fundamental the first data that 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.890
 we mentioned is the nominal voltage that 

00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:10.100
 is indicated at this point here tells me 

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:11.780
 which is 400 volts which implies that 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.650
 with this switch I can connect 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:18.560
 voltages of 110 220 

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:21.370
 or 380 without any problem since this 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.340
 Product is designed for 400 volts 

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:27.729
 as our medium 

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:30.490
 we have 380 voltages in networks 

00:01:27.729 --> 00:01:33.729
 three-phase is essential to use 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.590
 this model since these products 

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:38.920
 They are also manufactured under standards 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:40.840
 international standards and that compared 

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:43.090
 with the norm nem that is a product 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:46.340
 which is designed for tensions up 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.320
 240 volts maximum 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:51.350
 another important fact that we were 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.960
 indicating is the current capacity 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.439
 that is fundamental when it comes to 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.909
 choose the thermo magnetic switch 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.369
 how many amps will my stretch be 

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.310
 magnetic that will depend on the 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:08.450
 driver that I use in the installation 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:12.490
 electrical for example we want a 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.900
 2.5 mm square conductor 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:16.510
 equivalent to number 14 which is the one 

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.549
 more is employed 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.560
 is used for example in circuit 

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:24.790
 lighting 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:27.310
 That driver supports maximum 18 amps 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.680
 according to standards 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.890
 therefore the thermo switch 

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.490
 magnetic that I will choose will be the 2 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.970
 x 16 amps 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:40.020
 since it tells me that the ability to 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:42.780
 techno switch current 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.630
 magnetic must always be equal or less 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:48.180
 than the maximum current capacity that 

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:51.599
 supports the driver 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.909
 therefore it is important to consider 

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:56.459
 that aspect another parameter that is 

00:02:53.909 --> 00:03:00.480
 important to identify is a thermos 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:03.859
 magnetic is the operating curve the 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:07.500
 curve operation is a data that indicates 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:09.870
 the operational characteristic that gives us 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:12.329
 this magnetic theme to give you answer 

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:15.329
 facing an overload or a 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:19.290
 short that tells me the letter c 

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:22.349
 is the operating curve the curves of 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:24.240
 operation guarantee me the time of 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:27.270
 answer 

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.820
 of the magnetic switch in front of 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:34.260
 a fault is designed to act 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:36.210
 when it detects a current of 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:39.780
 short of 10 times the value 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:42.390
 nominal in a time of one hundredth of 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:45.360
 second means that this curve 

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:47.640
 it guarantees me a response time of 

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.470
 switch in front of shorts 

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:50.910
 especially because that is the most 

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.170
 criticism that are generated in the 

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.870
 facilities 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.880
 and finally we have another data 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.959
 important that is the ability to 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:05.350
 break in this case our products 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:08.740
 have 2 x is cut 

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:12.940
 for 220 volts it has a cutting power 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:16.500
 of 10 kilos periods and for 400 volts 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:19.510
 its cutting power is 6 kilos amps 

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.810
 and that data will always 

00:04:19.510 --> 00:04:24.500
 find on the frontis of this 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:27.770
 switch 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:30.380
 another main feature that we're going 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:33.100
 to identify within the structure 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:36.400
 external is 

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:39.310
 the level of connection these products 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:42.910
 They have a reversible connection system 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:45.160
 how we consider reversibility when 

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:47.729
 we connect the entrance of the 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:51.719
 lines at the top 

00:04:47.729 --> 00:04:53.460
 and it comes out from the bottom to the 

00:04:51.719 --> 00:04:56.009
 entry of the lines can be done 

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:58.559
 through the bottom and exit through the 

00:04:56.009 --> 00:05:01.439
 top of that is called the 

00:04:58.559 --> 00:05:05.219
 reversibility means that as 

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:07.740
 connect anyway in front of a 

00:05:05.219 --> 00:05:11.400
 Failure will always guarantee me 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:13.349
 Operability in the protection should 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:16.770
 Consider also quality and that's 

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:18.169
 fundamental in a product 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:21.449
 thermomagnetic switches 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:25.080
 Our are made with materials 

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:28.139
 of good quality implies that when 

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:31.020
 we talk about a magnetic thermos we are 

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:34.280
 talking about two important devices 

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:37.910
 that are inside the switch 

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.310
 which are the beat metal 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.840
 who is in charge of protecting the 

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:44.639
 levels of overload that will be 

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:48.210
 exposed the driver 

00:05:44.639 --> 00:05:50.729
 and then we have the magnetic coil that 

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:53.479
 is responsible for acting in front of a 

00:05:50.729 --> 00:05:56.879
 short for it is important 

00:05:53.479 --> 00:06:00.060
 identify precisely those materials to 

00:05:56.879 --> 00:06:02.879
 from this box that allows me 

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:04.740
 physically visualize the various 

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:06.900
 structures that the 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.699
 Thermomagnetic switches eyes have 

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.379
 Be very careful with the quality of the 

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:12.569
 product 

00:06:10.379 --> 00:06:15.029
 our product for example is 

00:06:12.569 --> 00:06:17.159
 manufactured with a wire coil of 

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.289
 enameled copper google- layer that 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:22.319
 is the one that guarantees a high level of 

00:06:19.289 --> 00:06:24.800
 operability versus a short and 

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:26.849
 another important and fundamental element 

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:29.370
 to guarantee the levels of 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:31.259
 Operability is the cutting chamber which 

00:06:29.370 --> 00:06:33.449
 is the purpose of the cutting chamber is 

00:06:31.259 --> 00:06:35.189
 eliminate the arcs that are 

00:06:33.449 --> 00:06:37.740
 generate when it is generated when it 

00:06:35.189 --> 00:06:39.930
 presents a short while 

00:06:37.740 --> 00:06:42.000
 in other products the cutting chambers 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:43.849
 They are manufactured for example from iron 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.430
 copper plated with cardboard coating 

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:49.409
 even more the terminals with which account 

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:51.330
 all the internal structure and edges 

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:53.720
 connection of our products 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:56.009
 made of galvanized steel 

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.470
 tropicalized with high levels of 

00:06:56.009 --> 00:07:00.930
 galvanic finish or contacts that 

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.180
 they allow current driving are with 

00:07:00.930 --> 00:07:06.180
 a silver tungsten alloy like 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:08.129
 we know silver is the best driver 

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:09.599
 of electricity therefore I 

00:07:08.129 --> 00:07:11.819
 guarantees those high levels of 

00:07:09.599 --> 00:07:13.439
 conductivity for that reason is that 

00:07:11.819 --> 00:07:15.509
 when we choose a magnetic thermos 

00:07:13.439 --> 00:07:18.180
 We can guarantee 10,000 

00:07:15.509 --> 00:07:20.550
 electrical maneuvers and 20000 maneuvers 

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:22.939
 mechanical under nominal conditions of 

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.939
 work
