00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:16.230
 hi all the boys are always me 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.510
 her wide 90 and I welcome you 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 today this video from the one 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.660
 series dedicated to the gaming world on 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.180
 peripheral move to which smartphones 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.529
 tablet in short we understood each other in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.240
 especially he showed me those 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.369
 video games that are therefore optimized 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:32.279
 supported by the tegra technology of 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.649
 nvidia is my platform 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 reference will be both this and that 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.450
 also appealed correctly to an asus 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.660
 transformer prime or a transformer prime 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.180
 I know this but a little in transformers 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.469
 tav and that having the opportunity to have it 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.030
 I will have time to record 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.280
 some gameplay of some video games 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.980
 so we will just be there for you too 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.750
 that therefore the mobile gaming world also 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.910
 its potential video games a lot 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:59.039
 interesting then after this brief 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.660
 introduction of this series that will have a 

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:02.399
 unspecified number of episode 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.140
 actually I don't know how many episodes there 

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:05.670
 will be according to the number of 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.530
 video games that I will go out record 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.900
 especially depending on how many games 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.549
 vip can within a single video 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.900
 rating don't waste any more time e 

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.020
 maybe show you the first video game a 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:18.030
 where I got to play on the asus 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.380
 transformer and then I'll talk to you too 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.909
 maybe some tea for a while 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:22.170
 short video games will be a series 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.700
 dedicated to the gaming world and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.280
 mumbai which looks like summer had a lot 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.750
 interesting and today as it is today 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.150
 also cut out his space then 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.310
 what about good vision with the gameplay is 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.130
 my usual comment that will torment you 

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:37.079
 for the possible profit and here we are on the 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.360
 our tablet ready to start a 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.130
 video game instead no two more alive 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.560
 seconds showing lives gazzoni that not 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.850
 which is nothing but a shop from which it is 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.399
 can download or buy 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:49.439
 video games that run on the 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:51.210
 tegra structure but more than the showcase 

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:52.890
 Now switch to the games category 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.960
 showcase maybe shows us the news 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:56.610
 last releases while in play we see 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.530
 however, an extensive list of video games 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.110
 uniforms both in paid video games 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.180
 that video games free video games a 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.490
 payment fortunately they are not too much 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.899
 are not too expensive I have no costs 

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.789
 too important for example then we'll see 

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:10.830
 max payne has only just over two euros 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.239
 there are indeed many many everywhere 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.150
 free video game video games 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:14.709
 free 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.560
 they often use the formula 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.090
 of free to play or you download 

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.549
 my game for free then toy 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.780
 also everything but maybe if you want to unlock 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.730
 that given access to that 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.129
 certain weapon instead you have to buy 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.620
 perhaps by means of money the currency of 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.359
 game in order to access those 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.980
 accessories that you are so good this is you 

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:35.079
 dead trigger video game that we will see 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.670
 really very interesting today and 

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:38.439
 above all it also supports control 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:40.150
 now he talked about it during the video 

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:42.069
 so I would say not to lose any more 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.650
 time will open this wonderful image 

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:46.150
 that shows us this beautiful zombie 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.859
 I don't think anyone would want it at home 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:49.720
 no one actually therefore we have 

00:02:47.859 --> 00:02:51.970
 prevented him from triggers to see some 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.849
 the video game itself I would like to start 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.090
 spending two words on the controller on the 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.049
 controller that fortunately the asus 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.700
 supports and can be connected 

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:02.769
 practically any control a 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.239
 that of the 360 ​​and playstation 3 or but is 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:06.340
 the first fries control that 

00:03:04.239 --> 00:03:08.230
 you have found here is this first part 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.049
 rimpallo I will play with the controller and in the 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.810
 the second part instead used the 

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:15.730
 classic tablet setting ie 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.650
 using our magic fingers but 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.510
 leaving out this thing that I therefore have 

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.639
 found really very sympathetic to be able to 

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.109
 play with a controller so that the 

00:03:21.639 --> 00:03:24.849
 end is configured as any 

00:03:23.109 --> 00:03:27.730
 video game and here I am used to 

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:29.799
 play well latimore dwell on 

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.389
 quality of the video game itself then 

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.829
 you can't hear audio because 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:35.169
 as usual there is me who speaks to us 

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:37.239
 above the end of the video I leave the 

00:03:35.169 --> 00:03:39.730
 let's say 30 seconds of pure gameplay where 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:42.340
 you can just enjoy the video game 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.930
 but looking at the sector for a moment 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:46.599
 graph that you can see very well 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.859
 now honestly if I didn't have you 

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:49.540
 said that this game ran on a 

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:51.370
 you would never have a tablet at this time 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.319
 having said that I am quite impressed 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.030
 Also because they are not just very 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.109
 updated on games on tablet this is 

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.750
 the first time we actually did 

00:03:56.109 --> 00:04:00.760
 game only known very impressed that 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:03.150
 despite this this is really a 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.949
 excellent videogame with excellent ones 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.530
 potential under the state aspect 

00:04:05.949 --> 00:04:10.329
 graphic compartment not only from texture and 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.669
 everything but also the effects that 

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.379
 however they are often heavy yet 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:16.840
 no matter how this is a tablet 

00:04:14.379 --> 00:04:19.780
 have ever been those lag or slowdowns 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:23.110
 various annoyances and so it's all a lot 

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:24.340
 struck by everything ie I am believed 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.630
 also quite this video game that 

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:28.210
 quite nice 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.620
 you also see these zombies with pumpkins 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.200
 in testing and probably a mod 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.790
 dating back to halloween that they don't have 

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:35.550
 still taken away and less ever because I like it 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:37.660
 more kill those of zombies but 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.610
 this part of who you see as well 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.840
 precisely that it is possible with that 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.490
 play it quietly without 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:44.950
 controller and we also play rather 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.690
 abbas rather well c day does the hand 

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.640
 because I am quite prevented though 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.740
 anyway I liked this sincere 

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:51.820
 much to play this game was the 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.310
 first game I actually have 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:56.170
 played first serious game on tablet and ne 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:57.520
 I was very impressed therefore of it 

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:59.170
 that this is all for this video in 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.790
 which I showed you dead trigger first and 

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.930
 of the game on tablet for this series 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.300
 dedicated to furniture 

00:05:01.930 --> 00:05:05.710
 now I leave you those 30 seconds of pure 

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:08.110
 gameplay that you can enjoy yourself in 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.720
 silence, however, you can enjoy them 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:11.950
 point here I am a layman at 90 the vi 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:13.570
 thank you as usual for the bag 

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.030
 kind attention I invite you to leave 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.160
 a comment on what you think of this 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:19.810

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.580
 dedicated to the tablet are really a lot 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:23.230
 curious of your of your 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:24.790
 impressions let me like a

 comment and who hears the mail 

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:27.450
 Hi everyone
