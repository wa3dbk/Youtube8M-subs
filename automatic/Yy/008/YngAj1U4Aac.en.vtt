00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:56.370

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
but I don't really have that problem I'm

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.920 
but I don't really have that problem I'm

theoretically<00:05:44.940> this<00:05:45.120> is<00:05:45.300> better<00:05:45.510> because<00:05:45.780> of

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
theoretically this is better because of

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.960 
theoretically this is better because of
the<00:05:46.140> locking<00:05:46.560> mechanism<00:05:47.280> and<00:05:47.550> you<00:05:47.850> know

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
the locking mechanism and you know

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
you get this in hand I mean this is just

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:00.860 
you get this in hand I mean this is just
a<00:05:58.920> much<00:05:59.130> more<00:05:59.370> enjoyable<00:05:59.610> knife<00:06:00.150> to<00:06:00.360> have<00:06:00.570> I

a much more enjoyable knife to have I

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:06.380 
a much more enjoyable knife to have I
think<00:06:02.660> so<00:06:04.280> enough<00:06:05.280> about<00:06:05.370> the<00:06:05.640> Mannix<00:06:05.910> 2xl

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
think so enough about the Mannix 2xl

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.340 
think so enough about the Mannix 2xl
it's<00:06:06.540> not<00:06:06.690> about<00:06:06.900> him

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:07.350 
it's not about him

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:11.560 
it's not about him
here's<00:06:08.160> a<00:06:08.310> pair<00:06:08.640> military<00:06:09.000> to<00:06:09.210> with<00:06:09.420> it

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:11.570 
here's a pair military to with it

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.030 
here's a pair military to with it
paramilitary<00:06:12.570> 2<00:06:13.050> is<00:06:13.260> another<00:06:13.470> knife<00:06:13.710> that's

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:14.040 
paramilitary 2 is another knife that's

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:18.200 
paramilitary 2 is another knife that's
fallen<00:06:14.400> out<00:06:14.520> of<00:06:14.550> favor<00:06:14.850> with<00:06:15.150> me<00:06:16.190> I<00:06:17.190> don't<00:06:18.150> know

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:18.210 
fallen out of favor with me I don't know

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.220 
fallen out of favor with me I don't know
what<00:06:18.330> it<00:06:18.450> is<00:06:18.570> about<00:06:18.720> it

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.230 
what it is about it

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:22.220 
what it is about it
I<00:06:19.290> think<00:06:20.280> it's<00:06:20.370> that<00:06:20.460> delicate<00:06:20.910> tip<00:06:21.120> I've<00:06:22.080> had

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:22.230 
I think it's that delicate tip I've had

00:06:22.230 --> 00:06:23.540 
I think it's that delicate tip I've had
to<00:06:22.320> bring<00:06:22.440> it<00:06:22.620> back<00:06:22.740> several<00:06:23.040> times<00:06:23.370> because

00:06:23.540 --> 00:06:23.550 
to bring it back several times because

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:26.720 
to bring it back several times because
it<00:06:23.760> gets<00:06:23.880> blunted<00:06:24.270> real<00:06:24.420> easily<00:06:25.280> and<00:06:26.280> the

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:26.730 
it gets blunted real easily and the

00:06:26.730 --> 00:06:29.720 
it gets blunted real easily and the
compression<00:06:27.180> lock<00:06:27.830> you<00:06:28.830> have<00:06:28.950> to<00:06:29.100> grab<00:06:29.490> it<00:06:29.640> in

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:29.730 
compression lock you have to grab it in

00:06:29.730 --> 00:06:31.940 
compression lock you have to grab it in
such<00:06:29.940> a<00:06:29.970> weird<00:06:30.270> way<00:06:30.390> to<00:06:30.960> disengage<00:06:31.440> that<00:06:31.470> with

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:31.950 
such a weird way to disengage that with

00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:34.580 
such a weird way to disengage that with
one<00:06:32.160> hand<00:06:32.720> you<00:06:33.720> know<00:06:33.840> you<00:06:33.900> could<00:06:34.200> do<00:06:34.350> it<00:06:34.380> like

00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:34.590 
one hand you know you could do it like

00:06:34.590 --> 00:06:38.420 
one hand you know you could do it like
this<00:06:34.860> I<00:06:35.070> guess<00:06:36.410> but<00:06:37.410> if<00:06:37.680> you<00:06:37.830> want<00:06:38.010> to<00:06:38.100> be<00:06:38.190> cool

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:38.430 
this I guess but if you want to be cool

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:40.040 
this I guess but if you want to be cool
and<00:06:38.730> like<00:06:38.910> flick<00:06:39.750> it<00:06:39.840> out

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:40.050 
and like flick it out

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:42.110 
and like flick it out
there<00:06:40.169> and<00:06:40.349> flick<00:06:40.500> it<00:06:40.620> back<00:06:40.650> in<00:06:40.979> you<00:06:41.819> have<00:06:41.849> to

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:42.120 
there and flick it back in you have to

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.999 
there and flick it back in you have to
pinch<00:06:42.509> it<00:06:42.659> kind<00:06:42.930> of<00:06:43.020> right<00:06:43.199> just<00:06:43.650> like<00:06:43.770> this

00:06:43.999 --> 00:06:44.009 
pinch it kind of right just like this

00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:45.409 
pinch it kind of right just like this
and<00:06:44.220> you<00:06:44.310> might<00:06:44.430> drop<00:06:44.729> the<00:06:44.909> knife<00:06:45.060> which<00:06:45.270> I've

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:45.419

00:06:45.419 --> 00:06:47.779 
and you might drop the knife which I've
done<00:06:45.599> a<00:06:45.629> few<00:06:45.780> times<00:06:46.050> I<00:06:46.409> don't<00:06:47.280> know<00:06:47.430> what<00:06:47.580> it<00:06:47.669> is
