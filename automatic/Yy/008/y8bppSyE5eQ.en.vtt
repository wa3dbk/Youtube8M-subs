00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:14.650

00:00:18.489 --> 00:00:22.989

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.970

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.380
 Archifamosa everyone knows her but 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.390
 I had never used any of them 

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:52.020
 but they drew this line that 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.100
 flame curves is for curly hair 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.290

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.280

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:06.310

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:08.290

00:01:12.190 --> 00:01:15.759
 so I had to try it and since 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.190
 this one was in special introduction 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.310

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:30.690
 smell is spectacular is a smell that 

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.670
 since April the bottle is quite 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.370
 strong because he needs me to open it 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.780
 came to the nose and said wow what smell did not 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:38.880
 he has tried it I can not tell him anything 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.110
 still of how this product takes 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.710
 with my hair because I have not tried it 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:46.410
 but the smell is a plus plus plus 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:49.259
 it's great that's when I try it 

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:51.479
 I will comment on the blog how it is going 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:53.250
 with this product the next thing that 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.650
 buy are these two products of 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:59.399
 maybelline that are the maybelline fit me 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.710
 mate in them the dust and the base this 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:04.619
 I bought it because the other day I was 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.780
 looking for some products in curry which 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:09.030
 they came to me from amazon and I came across 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.370
 a very nice follower who told me 

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:13.140
 you have to try these products because 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.880
 They are fabulous she were 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:16.590
 picking herself that there were 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.810
 order I think I had used it 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:20.310
 previously and they had loved and 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.900
 half you have to try it I would love 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.060
 see a rhythm of yours and that 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:26.820
 will recommend your followers because they are 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.160
 very good and they are here I asked them 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:30.600
 I said I would ask for them and I asked them 

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.640
 The truth is that I'm crazy about 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:35.010
 try them and I'll tell you how it's going 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.330
 with these two products at the time 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.740
 that puts mate and that eliminates a little 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.540
 open forums 

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:44.370
 Well, that's what the 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.930
 attention because it goes for here to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:48.150
 warmer assets and now for the 

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:50.220
 hot weather I think this kind of 

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.930
 products are a hit and I'm crazy about 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.060
 try them to tell them to see if I 

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.890
 they like it as much as I did that it was 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:57.660
 very nice and approached me to 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.900
 recommend me your products that 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.970
 love and then the last thing you buy does not 

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:04.320
 complete the things either because if I 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.540
 I buy so many things every time 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.570
 I make a goal I go crazy the 

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:11.940
 next are these umbrellas of Milan 

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:13.950
 and I had a time already wanting 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.280
 try them but every time I was going to ask 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.250
 they were exhausted then now finally 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.190
 it seems that the fashion boom passed or not 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:26.550
 I know and they are available again and 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:31.020
 I bought four these shadows here 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:33.780
 they call candle there are always shadows 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:36.090
 and they come in this super nice packaging 

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:37.920
 that is new to Milan and because 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.750
 they the packaging of their men 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:42.420
 previous ones was not as pretty as this one 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.920
 I have to tell you but this package 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:47.790
 it seems that it is super super nice and this 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:49.710
 This shadow's formula is what 

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.590
 it really intrigued me because it's a 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:56.070
 formula author is how they feel 

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:59.730
 to the touch they feel like they were cream 

00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.460
 but they are dust I bought this green that 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:04.440
 it's called candle in melon and the finish of 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:06.390
 skimmer because they have different types 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.660
 of finishes I will make a post on the blog 

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:11.730
 like Suarez so they can see the finishes and 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:14.190
 see the colors and I already did some 

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:16.700
 swatch that other and the truth that the 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:19.830
 pigmentation is fabulous this green is 

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:22.590
 beautifully beautiful then I have this 

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:25.020
 uncle color that you will tell me or this is 

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:27.210
 color is scandal for summer 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:29.190
 even as eyeliner you can use 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:32.030
 beautiful too and this is a finish 

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:34.670
 metallic and it's called candle uncle 

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:38.690
 and I love that names are what 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.700
 it's the dress, this is if it's 

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:42.110
 very well to simplify life the 

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.460
 next is this one called candle 

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:48.170
 champagne and it is here that its color 

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:50.120
 superbonito of those that to put the 

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:53.060
 children alone in the eyelid art 

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.330
 a touch of brightness is great this 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.220
 finish is also shimmer nap 

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.500
 here and then I have one that has not 

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.460
 open because unfortunately look what 

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.370
 what happened 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:07.770
 these completely collapsed in the 

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.319
 transfer this back to a disaster and 

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.039
 when the work is going to have shade color 

00:05:10.319 --> 00:05:16.199
 candle goal everywhere but with a 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:18.599
 little alcohol the solution I will do but it is 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:21.660
 so you see the color is very very very 

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:24.120
 nice is this here is a golden but 

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:28.080
 with an old gold not so yellow 

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:29.970
 it's more like almost bronze I'm crazy about 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:32.220
 open up the disease much much fear 

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:34.979
 then the wee user of a single 

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:36.360
 mind to see how pigmented these 

00:05:34.979 --> 00:05:39.870
 shades 

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:43.379
 look how wonderful this is wow 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:47.610
 this is the color uncle and this is going to be a 

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:51.180
 scandal for summer to see how much 

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:53.759
 that you see that shadow is fabulous that's 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.090
 as a single pass or that the 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:58.919
 pigmentation and texture and feeling it 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.479
 it is true that they feel not like dust 

00:05:58.919 --> 00:06:02.639
 they feel more like it's a 

00:06:00.479 --> 00:06:05.759
 cream but if it's definitely a 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:07.770
 dust and they are very very beautiful 

00:06:05.759 --> 00:06:09.479
 then I am super happy and crazy 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:13.590
 also for trying these new things 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:15.419
 from Milan and you know that when I do not 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:17.550
 things on video sometimes from agost reviews 

00:06:15.419 --> 00:06:19.110
 only for the blog so always 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.330
 be aware of the fashionista of the 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:23.069
 dotcom list because there are many 

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:25.500
 times I make prizes that I do not do in 

00:06:23.069 --> 00:06:27.900
 video I make them there with lots of photos and 

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.699
 all that we all like I hope 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.469
 who are having a happy tomorrow afternoon 

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:34.340
