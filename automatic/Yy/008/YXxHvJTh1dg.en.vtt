00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510 
kind of just hopping and falling so I'll

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.770 
kind of just hopping and falling so I'll
demonstrate<00:02:24.720> that<00:02:26.269> hopping<00:02:27.269> and<00:02:27.420> falling

that's a bad butterfly you don't want to
do<00:02:29.310> that<00:02:29.519> and<00:02:30.950> then<00:02:31.950> that<00:02:31.980> kind<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.400> makes<00:02:32.610> the

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
do that and then that kind of makes the

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.380
