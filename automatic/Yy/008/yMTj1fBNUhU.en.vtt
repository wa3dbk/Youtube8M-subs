00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:03.270 
long-term use of these creams on your
skin<00:04:00.129> can<00:04:00.910> can<00:04:01.389> lead<00:04:01.629> to<00:04:01.780> cancer<00:04:02.199> and<00:04:02.379> so<00:04:02.980> our

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:03.280 
skin can can lead to cancer and so our

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:06.509 
skin can can lead to cancer and so our
over<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.209> next<00:04:04.480> couple<00:04:04.959> of<00:04:05.139> months<00:04:05.349> and<00:04:05.709> year

00:04:06.509 --> 00:04:06.519 
over the next couple of months and year

00:04:06.519 --> 00:04:08.729 
over the next couple of months and year
we<00:04:07.120> plan<00:04:07.299> to<00:04:07.510> look<00:04:07.690> at<00:04:07.870> whether<00:04:08.470> these

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:08.739 
we plan to look at whether these

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:11.099 
we plan to look at whether these
compounds<00:04:09.489> that<00:04:09.549> we've<00:04:09.730> now<00:04:09.879> isolated<00:04:10.449> that

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:11.109 
compounds that we've now isolated that

00:04:11.109 --> 00:04:13.890 
compounds that we've now isolated that
we<00:04:11.290> know<00:04:11.500> are<00:04:11.530> in<00:04:12.250> large<00:04:12.639> amounts<00:04:12.819> in<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.540> skin

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
we know are in large amounts in the skin

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.949 
we know are in large amounts in the skin
we<00:04:14.410> can<00:04:14.590> now<00:04:14.709> expose<00:04:15.190> these<00:04:15.400> compounds<00:04:16.030> to<00:04:16.329> the

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
we can now expose these compounds to the

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.409 
we can now expose these compounds to the
skin<00:04:17.229> cells<00:04:17.560> and<00:04:17.919> actually<00:04:18.459> look<00:04:18.699> at<00:04:18.880> whether

00:04:19.409 --> 00:04:19.419 
skin cells and actually look at whether

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.910 
skin cells and actually look at whether
over<00:04:19.989> time<00:04:20.260> they<00:04:20.859> actually<00:04:21.219> have

00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:21.920 
over time they actually have

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.520 
over time they actually have
as<00:04:21.980> a<00:04:22.040> forming<00:04:22.490> fit<00:04:22.730> and<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:23.300> you<00:04:23.360> you<00:04:24.200> need<00:04:24.350> to

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:24.530 
as a forming fit and so you you need to

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:28.540 
as a forming fit and so you you need to
know<00:04:24.710> that<00:04:25.400> only<00:04:26.270> a<00:04:26.690> cream<00:04:27.140> exists<00:04:28.130> with<00:04:28.430> an

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:28.550 
know that only a cream exists with an

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:30.790 
know that only a cream exists with an
insert<00:04:29.030> which<00:04:29.600> is<00:04:29.810> the<00:04:30.170> piece<00:04:30.320> of<00:04:30.470> paper<00:04:30.680> that

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:30.800 
insert which is the piece of paper that

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.740 
insert which is the piece of paper that
they<00:04:31.010> insert<00:04:31.400> with<00:04:31.610> with<00:04:32.180> the<00:04:32.270> cream<00:04:32.510> when<00:04:32.660> you

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
they insert with with the cream when you

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.260 
they insert with with the cream when you

buy for the first time in a box and it

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:37.030 
buy for the first time in a box and it
is<00:04:35.390> that<00:04:35.570> insert<00:04:36.080> that<00:04:36.290> only<00:04:36.500> gives<00:04:36.830> the

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:37.040 
is that insert that only gives the

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:39.670 
is that insert that only gives the
