that's the whole goal is to get the F

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:13.080 
that's the whole goal is to get the F
out<00:02:07.070> of<00:02:07.130> this<00:02:07.450> and<00:02:08.450> I'm<00:02:09.229> not<00:02:09.440> liking<00:02:09.679> it<00:02:09.890> at<00:02:10.039> all

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.850 

because<00:02:14.090> of<00:02:14.240> a<00:02:14.420> rains<00:02:14.690> we're<00:02:15.200> going<00:02:15.290> to<00:02:15.350> be<00:02:15.470> Sol

and I think it'd be take me hours to get
out<00:02:20.200> might<00:02:21.200> even<00:02:21.380> take<00:02:21.650> longer<00:02:24.130> so<00:02:25.130> our<00:02:25.220> goal

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:25.370 
out might even take longer so our goal

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.350 
out might even take longer so our goal
is<00:02:25.520> to<00:02:25.670> get<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:25.850> F<00:02:25.970> out<00:02:26.830> onward<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:27.980> go<00:02:28.360> there's
