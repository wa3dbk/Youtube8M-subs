00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
infused with the gel technology so it's

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.490 
infused with the gel technology so it's
pretty<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:36.180> padding<00:00:36.510> is<00:00:36.600> really<00:00:36.870> thick<00:00:37.110> on<00:00:37.290> it

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
pretty the padding is really thick on it

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.610 
pretty the padding is really thick on it
offers<00:00:38.280> good<00:00:38.489> protection<00:00:39.230> with<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.260> padding

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
peaceful hey for the ears but does a

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.790 
peaceful hey for the ears but does a
good<00:00:47.879> job<00:00:47.940> no<00:00:48.570> this<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:48.960> a<00:00:48.989> full<00:00:49.200> phase<00:00:49.410> version

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
good job no this is a full phase version

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.500 
good job no this is a full phase version
so<00:00:49.950> it<00:00:50.039> comes<00:00:50.190> with<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.640> chin<00:00:50.910> protector<00:00:51.390> as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
so it comes with the chin protector as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.990 
so it comes with the chin protector as
well<00:00:51.690> down<00:00:52.020> here<00:00:52.430> sheet<00:00:53.430> protectors

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
well down here sheet protectors

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.500 
well down here sheet protectors
everything<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.079> is<00:00:55.289> a<00:00:56.059> it's<00:00:57.059> filled<00:00:57.270> with<00:00:57.420> the

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
everything is is a it's filled with the

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.680 
everything is is a it's filled with the
gel<00:00:57.719> the<00:00:58.680> gel<00:00:58.710> technology<00:00:59.219> so<00:00:59.850> I<00:01:00.090> think<00:01:00.449> they

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
gel the gel technology so I think they

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:02.660 
gel the gel technology so I think they
use<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:00.840> foam<00:01:01.109> but<00:01:01.320> they<00:01:01.410> also<00:01:01.559> use<00:01:01.859> the<00:01:02.100> gel<00:01:02.399> so

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
use a foam but they also use the gel so

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.289 
use a foam but they also use the gel so
it's<00:01:03.359> pretty<00:01:03.589> pretty<00:01:04.589> dense<00:01:04.949> foam<00:01:05.309> or<00:01:05.610> should

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
it's pretty pretty dense foam or should

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.100 
it's pretty pretty dense foam or should
I<00:01:06.360> say<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.630> gel<00:01:06.840> padding<00:01:07.140> is<00:01:07.380> real<00:01:07.740> dense<00:01:09.110> the

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
I say the gel padding is real dense the

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.679 
I say the gel padding is real dense the
nose<00:01:10.530> protection<00:01:10.950> on<00:01:11.070> it<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> okay<00:01:11.790> it's

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
nose protection on it is okay it's

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:15.560 
nose protection on it is okay it's
pretty<00:01:13.260> decent<00:01:13.760> you<00:01:14.760> know<00:01:14.880> it<00:01:15.090> offers<00:01:15.390> good

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
pretty decent you know it offers good

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.480 
pretty decent you know it offers good
cheeks<00:01:15.840> protection<00:01:16.259> but<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.470> can<00:01:16.680> still<00:01:16.890> I've

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
the gangue side large when it comes to

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.179 
the gangue side large when it comes to
headgear<00:01:59.579> um<00:02:00.380> but<00:02:01.380> it<00:02:01.439> does<00:02:01.590> shift<00:02:01.829> around

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
headgear um but it does shift around

tucked in like it's supposed to be then

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:53.940

the<00:02:52.240> forehead<00:02:52.600> piece<00:02:52.780> is<00:02:52.930> too<00:02:53.110> high<00:02:53.260> so<00:02:53.590> it's

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:53.950 
the forehead piece is too high so it's

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:56.040 
the forehead piece is too high so it's
kind<00:02:54.160> of<00:02:54.220> you<00:02:54.940> know<00:02:55.000> sometimes<00:02:55.480> I<00:02:55.600> would<00:02:55.930> just

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
kind of you know sometimes I would just

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.690 
kind of you know sometimes I would just
recommend<00:02:56.200> not<00:02:56.620> even<00:02:56.920> getting<00:02:57.190> the<00:02:57.280> full<00:02:57.460> face

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
recommend not even getting the full face

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:59.370 
recommend not even getting the full face
just<00:02:58.030> get<00:02:58.180> the<00:02:58.270> one<00:02:58.420> that<00:02:58.660> covers<00:02:59.080> the<00:02:59.230> face

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
just get the one that covers the face

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.220 
just get the one that covers the face
but<00:02:59.650> is<00:02:59.800> open<00:03:00.190> down<00:03:00.340> here<00:03:00.550> with<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> chin<00:03:00.970> strap

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:05.340 
but is open down here with a chin strap
that<00:03:02.230> would<00:03:02.380> be<00:03:02.470> my<00:03:02.620> recommendation<00:03:04.080> as<00:03:05.080> far

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
that would be my recommendation as far

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:06.870 
that would be my recommendation as far
as<00:03:05.500> the<00:03:05.590> quality<00:03:05.920> goes<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:06.460> a<00:03:06.520> really<00:03:06.760> good

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880 
as the quality goes it's a really good

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:26.590 
into the headgear so it just has the

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:29.550 
into the headgear so it just has the
regular<00:03:27.310> velcro<00:03:27.880> system<00:03:28.240> on<00:03:28.360> the<00:03:28.420> back<00:03:28.570> you

so it's actually really easy to put on
one<00:03:35.050> of<00:03:35.080> the<00:03:35.230> more<00:03:36.010> convenient<00:03:36.520> measures<00:03:37.060> to

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:37.270 
one of the more convenient measures to

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.570 
one of the more convenient measures to
use<00:03:37.480> because<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:38.140> don't<00:03:39.100> have<00:03:39.250> to<00:03:39.400> really

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:39.580

whatever you know it's just what looks

whatever you know it's just what looks
the<00:04:17.710> other<00:04:17.770> thing<00:04:18.010> about<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.280> headgear<00:04:19.030> is

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:19.210 
the other thing about this headgear is

00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:21.150 
the other thing about this headgear is
kind<00:04:19.570> of<00:04:19.630> heavy<00:04:19.780> if<00:04:20.260> you<00:04:20.440> ever<00:04:20.560> owned<00:04:20.770> any<00:04:20.979> of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:21.160 
kind of heavy if you ever owned any of

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.680 
kind of heavy if you ever owned any of
the<00:04:21.280> title<00:04:21.580> gel<00:04:21.850> products<00:04:22.300> or<00:04:22.419> even<00:04:22.600> the

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
the title gel products or even the

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.100 
the title gel products or even the
ringside

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
ringside

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:26.059 
ringside
gel<00:04:23.259> products<00:04:23.620> the<00:04:24.550> gel<00:04:24.789> tends<00:04:25.270> to<00:04:25.419> make<00:04:25.569> the

00:04:26.059 --> 00:04:26.069 
gel products the gel tends to make the

00:04:26.069 --> 00:04:28.469 
gel products the gel tends to make the
equipment<00:04:27.069> a<00:04:27.310> little<00:04:27.460> heavier<00:04:27.789> it's<00:04:28.360> not

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
equipment a little heavier it's not

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:31.050 
equipment a little heavier it's not
super<00:04:28.810> heavy<00:04:28.960> but<00:04:29.580> compared<00:04:30.580> to<00:04:30.699> some<00:04:30.939> other

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:31.060 
super heavy but compared to some other

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.760 
super heavy but compared to some other
headgear<00:04:31.539> that<00:04:31.750> doesn't<00:04:32.259> use<00:04:32.349> jelly<00:04:32.620> you

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:32.770 
headgear that doesn't use jelly you

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:33.899 
headgear that doesn't use jelly you
didn't<00:04:32.949> definitely<00:04:33.250> tell<00:04:33.400> that<00:04:33.580> there's<00:04:33.849> a

00:04:33.899 --> 00:04:33.909 
didn't definitely tell that there's a

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:36.899 
didn't definitely tell that there's a
little<00:04:34.090> bit<00:04:34.270> more<00:04:34.300> weight<00:04:34.629> to<00:04:34.840> it<00:04:35.020> so<00:04:35.469> I<00:04:35.909> guess

00:04:36.899 --> 00:04:36.909 
little bit more weight to it so I guess

00:04:36.909 --> 00:04:37.950 
little bit more weight to it so I guess
that's<00:04:37.090> a<00:04:37.150> good<00:04:37.270> thing<00:04:37.479> if<00:04:37.599> you<00:04:37.689> want<00:04:37.870> to

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:37.960 
that's a good thing if you want to

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.659 
that's a good thing if you want to
strengthen<00:04:38.500> your<00:04:38.710> neck<00:04:38.979> while<00:04:39.189> you<00:04:39.340> wear<00:04:39.550> it

00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:39.669 
strengthen your neck while you wear it

00:04:39.669 --> 00:04:42.260 
strengthen your neck while you wear it
so<00:04:39.819> it's<00:04:40.689> a<00:04:40.750> little<00:04:40.870> bit<00:04:41.050> on<00:04:41.169> the<00:04:41.259> heavier<00:04:41.560> side

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
so it's a little bit on the heavier side

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.550 
so it's a little bit on the heavier side
the<00:04:43.270> stitching<00:04:43.599> on<00:04:43.689> it's<00:04:43.900> pretty<00:04:44.080> good<00:04:44.289> it's

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
the stitching on it's pretty good it's

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.020 
the stitching on it's pretty good it's
pretty<00:04:44.620> decent<00:04:45.189> the<00:04:45.340> leather<00:04:45.520> quality<00:04:45.969> is

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:46.030 
pretty decent the leather quality is

00:04:46.030 --> 00:04:49.770 
pretty decent the leather quality is
okay<00:04:47.729> so<00:04:48.729> overall<00:04:49.060> it's<00:04:49.360> a<00:04:49.419> pretty<00:04:49.449> decent

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:49.780 
okay so overall it's a pretty decent

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.189 
okay so overall it's a pretty decent
headgear<00:04:50.370> not<00:04:51.370> my<00:04:51.520> favorite<00:04:51.939> but<00:04:52.210> it<00:04:52.539> does<00:04:53.020> its

00:04:53.189 --> 00:04:53.199 
headgear not my favorite but it does its

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.450 
headgear not my favorite but it does its
job<00:04:54.930> like<00:04:55.930> I<00:04:56.020> said<00:04:56.199> for<00:04:56.379> a<00:04:56.439> full<00:04:56.680> face<00:04:56.919> for

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
job like I said for a full face for

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.519 
job like I said for a full face for
boxing<00:04:57.819> man<00:04:57.969> I'm<00:04:58.120> not<00:04:58.659> a<00:04:58.689> fan<00:04:59.139> of<00:04:59.169> the<00:04:59.349> full

00:04:59.519 --> 00:04:59.529 
boxing man I'm not a fan of the full

00:04:59.529 --> 00:05:01.409 
boxing man I'm not a fan of the full
face<00:04:59.710> head<00:04:59.919> gears<00:05:00.189> but<00:05:00.849> if<00:05:01.000> you're<00:05:01.150> an<00:05:01.240> MMA

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:01.419 
face head gears but if you're an MMA

00:05:01.419 --> 00:05:04.019 
face head gears but if you're an MMA
fighter<00:05:02.080> you're<00:05:03.009> taking<00:05:03.310> kicks<00:05:03.550> and<00:05:03.729> stuff<00:05:03.909> I

00:05:04.019 --> 00:05:04.029 
fighter you're taking kicks and stuff I

00:05:04.029 --> 00:05:05.999 
fighter you're taking kicks and stuff I
guess<00:05:04.060> that<00:05:04.509> the<00:05:04.629> chin<00:05:04.840> protection<00:05:05.319> is<00:05:05.439> is<00:05:05.949> a

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
guess that the chin protection is is a

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:09.480 
guess that the chin protection is is a
good<00:05:06.250> feature<00:05:06.460> to<00:05:06.639> have<00:05:08.009> like<00:05:09.009> I<00:05:09.129> said<00:05:09.310> good

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:09.490 
good feature to have like I said good

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.100 
good feature to have like I said good
convenient<00:05:09.969> gear<00:05:10.150> does<00:05:10.389> move<00:05:10.599> around<00:05:10.689> on<00:05:10.990> your
