00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:27.600

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.509

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.369
 we are going to break him down and we are going 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:35.069
 give him a breakdown because I really do 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:37.619
 always with responses 

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:39.390
 it's the first thing that I like the most 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.149
 feeling coolest than this trailer is 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.460
 just the music you hear the music 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.380
 always perfectly chosen by rox 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.080
 in my eyes and 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.819
 this music really has something we know 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.220
 already three years that this game 

00:01:50.819 --> 00:01:54.390
 the arrives and then now as atmospheric lead 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.130
 really like van 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:59.789
 it's finally coming it's really like that 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.479
 not such a finally he is feeling it 

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:07.500
 do you know that feeling gives me something 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:11.610
 I really like it and this trailer is 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.810
 among other things that trevor was in maybe 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.420
 the information unknown but trevor 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:17.010
 so it appears already 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.099
 to have been some friends 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:22.470
 with michael you know they are divorced 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:26.639
 in terms of friendship gifts what a 

00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:29.609
 pattern and that michael is rita you 

00:02:26.639 --> 00:02:31.590
 of course and that it will come back 

00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:33.840
 and what what Frenkel in to make it 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:35.459
 we don't really know that yet 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:38.329
 the trailers can be seen on 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:41.250
 internet where you can find a lot of information 

00:02:38.329 --> 00:02:47.880
 pieces available but then I find 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:52.590
 very fat what also fat fin lump here see the 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:56.790
 on the left illuminati and I see that brown 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.859
 region and it was on gta 4 on the tv or 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.660
 I already find three such small things 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:04.260
 I really awesome 

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.090
 In addition, look what we still find 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.639
 more 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.450
 but the heisst I think GTA so whole 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:14.730
 much about the house and grip image 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.250
 seriously i seriously hope that if come on 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:20.010
 playing the ps3 in two weeks that 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.380
 view distance even higher is all they are 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.269
 have created a lot of fog because you 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:27.180
 the view this is of course not possible 

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:28.860
 go high but it still looks 

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.710
 well out of preference and jenn or 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:34.440
 Here and there this looks very good I think 

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:38.220
 it really awesome such a big world 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:40.200
 In addition, there is not too much info 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.170
 these new ones but what I do 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:44.880
 find are some things that is this 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:48.210
 thing of course 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.290
 this submarine that in real facking 

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:51.000
 epic 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:53.250
 I find asylum aries your trevor there with 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:56.220

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:58.760

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:08.220
 michael still has all these problems 

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:10.410
 family and this is of course something 

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:14.010
 fat you still know 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.450

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:17.060
 not you of course but you 

00:04:15.450 --> 00:04:19.769

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.600

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.630
 from that chance you could shoot there I come 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:32.910
