if and else so this if and else block

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.020 
if and else so this if and else block
what<00:01:06.180> i'm<00:01:06.270> going<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.420> put<00:01:06.540> in<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:08.030> we're

this block flash or change color because
we<00:01:15.600> have<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.780> give<00:01:15.930> we<00:01:16.320> have<00:01:16.409> to<00:01:16.470> give<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> clue

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
we have to give we have to give a clue

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.830 
we have to give we have to give a clue
that<00:01:17.159> it<00:01:17.520> to<00:01:17.640> our<00:01:17.759> play<00:01:17.939> in<00:01:18.119> there<00:01:18.479> actually<00:01:18.720> in

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
that it to our play in there actually in

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.969 
that it to our play in there actually in
the<00:01:18.930> right<00:01:19.110> place<00:01:20.659> let's<00:01:21.659> go<00:01:21.780> and<00:01:22.080> change<00:01:22.710> the

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
the right place let's go and change the

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.520 
the right place let's go and change the
looks<00:01:23.189> and<00:01:23.520> we're<00:01:24.210> going<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.360> change<00:01:24.750> graphic

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
looks and we're going to change graphic

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.200 
looks and we're going to change graphic
effects<00:01:26.009> we<00:01:26.340> can<00:01:26.520> change<00:01:26.670> make<00:01:26.909> a<00:01:26.939> change

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
effects we can change make a change

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:33.060 
effects we can change make a change
color<00:01:27.750> so<00:01:28.290> if<00:01:28.409> touch<00:01:28.590> your<00:01:28.740> mouse<00:01:28.890> pointer

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.070 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.100 

what<00:01:34.070> we<00:01:34.159> can<00:01:34.280> do<00:01:34.549> as<00:01:35.119> well<00:01:35.329> just<00:01:35.570> test<00:01:35.869> this

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
what we can do as well just test this

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:39.420 
what we can do as well just test this
and<00:01:36.909> when<00:01:37.909> ping<00:01:38.149> over<00:01:38.509> there<00:01:38.750> it's<00:01:39.020> flashing

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
and when ping over there it's flashing

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.340 
and when ping over there it's flashing
so<00:01:40.430> we're<00:01:40.549> going<00:01:40.640> to<00:01:40.729> give<00:01:40.850> some<00:01:41.060> idea<00:01:41.450> now<00:01:42.289> the

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
so we're going to give some idea now the

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:45.999 
so we're going to give some idea now the
problem<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:42.950> that<00:01:44.049> it<00:01:45.049> stays<00:01:45.229> when<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.740> move

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
problem is that it stays when you move

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.800 
problem is that it stays when you move
the<00:01:46.130> mouse<00:01:46.460> away<00:01:46.670> from<00:01:46.970> him<00:01:47.090> it<00:01:47.509> goes<00:01:47.659> into

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
the mouse away from him it goes into

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:49.870 
the mouse away from him it goes into
different<00:01:48.110> color<00:01:48.229> and<00:01:48.500> stays<00:01:49.280> in<00:01:49.460> a<00:01:49.520> typically

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
different color and stays in a typically

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.380 
different color and stays in a typically
which<00:01:50.869> isn't<00:01:51.200> very<00:01:51.229> good<00:01:51.500> so<00:01:52.030> we<00:01:53.030> need<00:01:53.179> to<00:01:53.270> do

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390 
which isn't very good so we need to do

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.560 
which isn't very good so we need to do
is<00:01:53.689> the<00:01:54.350> else<00:01:54.590> will<00:01:55.340> say<00:01:55.460> if<00:01:55.640> change<00:01:56.119> color<00:01:56.390> if

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
is the else will say if change color if

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.609 
is the else will say if change color if
most<00:01:56.840> if<00:01:57.320> most<00:01:57.619> pointer<00:01:58.189> is<00:01:59.149> on<00:01:59.420> the<00:02:00.350> sprite

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
most if most pointer is on the sprite

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:05.109 
most if most pointer is on the sprite
change<00:02:01.490> color<00:02:01.729> make<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.240> flash<00:02:02.479> or<00:02:03.439> else<00:02:04.119> clear

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
change color make it flash or else clear

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:07.809 
change color make it flash or else clear
graphic<00:02:05.479> effects<00:02:06.159> and<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.490> will<00:02:07.580> return<00:02:07.729> you

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:07.819 
graphic effects and it will return you

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:15.309 
graphic effects and it will return you
back<00:02:07.909> to<00:02:08.060> normal<00:02:11.049> like<00:02:12.049> so<00:02:13.900> which<00:02:14.900> exactly

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:15.319 
back to normal like so which exactly

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.430 
back to normal like so which exactly
what<00:02:15.440> you<00:02:15.500> want<00:02:15.790> also<00:02:16.840> what<00:02:17.840> we<00:02:17.930> need<00:02:18.080> to<00:02:18.170> do<00:02:18.319> at

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:18.440 
what you want also what we need to do at

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:25.170 
what you want also what we need to do at
this<00:02:18.530> point<00:02:18.650> is<00:02:19.010> in<00:02:19.370> here<00:02:20.230> we<00:02:21.230> have<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:23.440> go<00:02:24.440> and

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
this point is in here we have to go and

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:31.360 
this point is in here we have to go and
give<00:02:26.180> our<00:02:26.299> player<00:02:26.590> some<00:02:27.590> kind<00:02:27.620> of<00:02:28.630> reward<00:02:30.370> so

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.370 
give our player some kind of reward so

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.670 
give our player some kind of reward so
change<00:02:31.610> score<00:02:32.000> by<00:02:32.299> what<00:02:32.930> I'm<00:02:33.110> actually<00:02:33.319> change

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680 
change score by what I'm actually change

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:38.979 
change score by what I'm actually change
it<00:02:33.799> by<00:02:33.920> five<00:02:36.100> now<00:02:37.100> then<00:02:37.310> if<00:02:37.970> we<00:02:38.480> leave<00:02:38.690> it<00:02:38.870> like

00:02:38.979 --> 00:02:38.989 
it by five now then if we leave it like

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:46.080 
it by five now then if we leave it like
this<00:02:41.799> you<00:02:42.799> can<00:02:42.950> see<00:02:43.130> that<00:02:43.160> the<00:02:43.310> score<00:02:44.049> goes<00:02:45.049> up

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
this you can see that the score goes up

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.770 
this you can see that the score goes up
hugely<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:49.790> make<00:02:49.940> this<00:02:50.030> only<00:02:50.209> go<00:02:50.359> up<00:02:50.390> by<00:02:50.510> five

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:50.780 
hugely to make this only go up by five

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.729 
hugely to make this only go up by five
and<00:02:51.109> stay<00:02:51.890> at<00:02:52.040> five<00:02:53.170> we<00:02:54.170> actually<00:02:54.410> want<00:02:54.530> to<00:02:54.590> do

and stops at five all I can do is just

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.069 
and stops at five all I can do is just
change<00:04:14.739> that<00:04:15.030> instead<00:04:16.030> of<00:04:16.090> two<00:04:16.299> seconds<00:04:16.780> we

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:17.079 
change that instead of two seconds we
