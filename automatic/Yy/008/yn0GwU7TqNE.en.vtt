here so they know where I'm at this
video<00:00:29.750> is<00:00:29.869> going<00:00:29.960> to<00:00:30.019> focus<00:00:30.230> on<00:00:30.529> how<00:00:30.769> I<00:00:30.800> would

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
video is going to focus on how I would

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.060 
video is going to focus on how I would
modify<00:00:31.369> my<00:00:31.730> water<00:00:32.140> to<00:00:33.140> brew<00:00:33.320> a<00:00:33.350> darker<00:00:33.829> beer

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:34.070 
modify my water to brew a darker beer

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.740 
modify my water to brew a darker beer
which<00:00:34.670> is<00:00:34.700> a<00:00:34.820> little<00:00:35.030> bit<00:00:35.149> more<00:00:35.239> challenging

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:35.750 
which is a little bit more challenging

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:40.209 
which is a little bit more challenging
but<00:00:35.960> not<00:00:36.410> too<00:00:36.559> bad<00:00:36.770> and<00:00:38.140> the<00:00:39.140> recipe<00:00:39.800> example

00:00:40.209 --> 00:00:40.219 
but not too bad and the recipe example

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:42.310 
but not too bad and the recipe example
I'm<00:00:40.280> gonna<00:00:40.430> use<00:00:40.579> this<00:00:40.789> for<00:00:40.850> a<00:00:41.360> smoked<00:00:42.050> porter

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:42.320 
I'm gonna use this for a smoked porter

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:45.880 
I'm gonna use this for a smoked porter
so<00:00:43.309> the<00:00:43.489> important<00:00:43.879> feature<00:00:44.480> here<00:00:44.840> is<00:00:44.989> the<00:00:45.320> the

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:45.890 
so the important feature here is the the

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.080 
so the important feature here is the the
color<00:00:46.399> target<00:00:46.879> which<00:00:47.030> is<00:00:47.210> 30<00:00:47.809> SRM<00:00:48.730> alright<00:00:49.730> so

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:50.090 
color target which is 30 SRM alright so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.090 
color target which is 30 SRM alright so
I'm<00:00:50.270> gonna<00:00:50.390> go<00:00:50.570> back<00:00:50.600> to<00:00:50.809> my<00:00:50.960> easy<00:00:51.770> water

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
I'm gonna go back to my easy water

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.119 
I'm gonna go back to my easy water
adjustment<00:00:52.399> spreadsheet<00:00:53.059> and<00:00:53.180> again<00:00:53.359> the<00:00:54.129> the

00:00:55.119 --> 00:00:55.129 
adjustment spreadsheet and again the the

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:58.000 
adjustment spreadsheet and again the the
numbers<00:00:55.460> from<00:00:55.850> my<00:00:55.940> water<00:00:56.840> tests<00:00:57.289> are<00:00:57.590> already

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:58.010 
numbers from my water tests are already

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:00.220 
numbers from my water tests are already
populated<00:00:58.550> in<00:00:58.850> the<00:00:58.910> fields<00:00:59.329> here<00:00:59.570> from<00:00:59.809> before

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
populated in the fields here from before

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.020 
populated in the fields here from before
and<00:01:00.530> I<00:01:00.769> saved<00:01:01.070> the<00:01:01.219> spreadsheet<00:01:01.670> so<00:01:01.699> let's

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:02.030 
and I saved the spreadsheet so let's

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.660 
and I saved the spreadsheet so let's
save<00:01:02.210> some<00:01:02.239> time<00:01:02.690> I<00:01:02.930> also<00:01:03.559> noted<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.100> mass

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
save some time I also noted the mass

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.000 
save some time I also noted the mass
water<00:01:05.000> and<00:01:05.420> sport<00:01:05.840> water<00:01:06.020> volumes<00:01:06.470> for<00:01:06.770> that

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
water and sport water volumes for that

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.120 
water and sport water volumes for that
smoked<00:01:07.400> porter<00:01:07.700> recipe<00:01:08.620> that<00:01:09.620> I<00:01:09.650> just<00:01:09.890> showed

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
smoked porter recipe that I just showed

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.340 
smoked porter recipe that I just showed
you<00:01:10.270> alright<00:01:11.270> so<00:01:11.420> now<00:01:11.570> that<00:01:11.600> that's<00:01:11.870> entered

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
you alright so now that that's entered

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.670 
you alright so now that that's entered
we<00:01:12.470> can<00:01:12.620> kind<00:01:12.800> of<00:01:12.890> analyze<00:01:13.930> what<00:01:14.930> where<00:01:15.530> we

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
we can kind of analyze what where we

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.820 
we can kind of analyze what where we
stand<00:01:16.090> I'm<00:01:17.090> going<00:01:17.270> to<00:01:17.330> select<00:01:17.630> our<00:01:17.990> I've

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:18.830 
stand I'm going to select our I've

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.650 
stand I'm going to select our I've
already<00:01:19.160> selected<00:01:19.490> the<00:01:19.760> London<00:01:20.150> profile

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:20.660 
already selected the London profile

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.240 
already selected the London profile
because<00:01:21.050> that's<00:01:21.230> pretty<00:01:21.530> appropriate<00:01:22.040> for<00:01:22.190> a

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
because that's pretty appropriate for a

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:27.880 
because that's pretty appropriate for a
porter<00:01:22.580> and<00:01:23.620> just<00:01:24.620> like<00:01:25.330> before<00:01:26.330> I<00:01:26.360> have<00:01:26.930> you

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:27.890 
porter and just like before I have you

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.920 
porter and just like before I have you
know<00:01:27.980> a<00:01:28.010> big<00:01:28.340> deficiency<00:01:28.910> on<00:01:29.030> my<00:01:29.120> calcium<00:01:29.630> and

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:29.930 
know a big deficiency on my calcium and

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.410 
know a big deficiency on my calcium and
sulphate<00:01:30.680> just<00:01:30.920> like<00:01:31.100> in<00:01:31.430> for<00:01:31.760> any<00:01:31.940> style

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
sulphate just like in for any style

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.410 
sulphate just like in for any style
let's<00:01:32.570> compare<00:01:32.900> to<00:01:33.110> London<00:01:33.500> ok<00:01:33.890> I'm<00:01:33.980> low<00:01:34.420> I'm

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:35.420 
let's compare to London ok I'm low I'm

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.790 
let's compare to London ok I'm low I'm
low<00:01:35.450> in<00:01:36.430> calcium<00:01:37.430> I<00:01:38.270> have<00:01:39.020> about<00:01:39.230> a<00:01:39.290> third<00:01:39.620> of

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
low in calcium I have about a third of

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.520 
low in calcium I have about a third of
the<00:01:40.010> appropriate<00:01:40.610> amount<00:01:40.970> of<00:01:41.030> magnesium<00:01:41.660> my

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
the appropriate amount of magnesium my

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.040 
the appropriate amount of magnesium my
sodium<00:01:43.130> is<00:01:43.310> very<00:01:43.520> low

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.050 
sodium is very low

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.900 
sodium is very low
my<00:01:45.050> chlorate<00:01:45.440> is<00:01:45.470> a<00:01:45.560> little<00:01:45.800> bit<00:01:45.890> high<00:01:46.100> but<00:01:46.850> my

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:46.910 
my chlorate is a little bit high but my

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.120 
my chlorate is a little bit high but my
sulphate<00:01:47.540> is<00:01:47.810> about<00:01:48.290> half<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.710> what<00:01:48.770> it<00:01:48.890> should

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.130 
sulphate is about half of what it should

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.610 
sulphate is about half of what it should
be<00:01:49.160> the<00:01:50.030> important<00:01:50.510> thing<00:01:50.690> here<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:51.140> I<00:01:51.410> want

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
be the important thing here that I want

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.470 
be the important thing here that I want
to<00:01:51.710> notice<00:01:51.980> that<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.490> chloride<00:01:52.940> the<00:01:53.150> sulfate

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:53.480 
to notice that the chloride the sulfate

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.350 
to notice that the chloride the sulfate
ratio<00:01:53.810> for<00:01:54.020> London<00:01:54.350> is<00:01:54.530> about<00:01:54.830> 1<00:01:55.010> to<00:01:55.190> 1<00:01:55.400> now

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 
ratio for London is about 1 to 1 now

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:59.470 
ratio for London is about 1 to 1 now
rather<00:01:56.600> than<00:01:57.280> try<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:58.340> match<00:01:58.580> my<00:01:58.850> sulfate<00:01:59.300> to

00:01:59.470 --> 00:01:59.480 
rather than try to match my sulfate to

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.350 
rather than try to match my sulfate to
the<00:01:59.600> 32<00:02:00.140> and<00:02:00.470> leave<00:02:01.070> my<00:02:01.310> chloride<00:02:01.760> high<00:02:02.060> I

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:02.360 
the 32 and leave my chloride high I

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.480 
the 32 and leave my chloride high I
would<00:02:02.720> rather<00:02:02.900> bring<00:02:03.650> the<00:02:03.800> sulfate<00:02:04.160> up<00:02:04.310> to

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:04.490 
would rather bring the sulfate up to

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.600 
would rather bring the sulfate up to
make<00:02:04.700> a<00:02:04.940> a<00:02:05.270> one-to-one<00:02:05.930> relationship<00:02:06.610> at

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:07.610 
make a a one-to-one relationship at

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
make a a one-to-one relationship at
about<00:02:08.119> 50<00:02:08.680> ok<00:02:09.680> so<00:02:09.740> that's<00:02:10.190> pretty<00:02:10.610> much<00:02:11.390> all<00:02:11.600> I

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
about 50 ok so that's pretty much all I

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.090 
about 50 ok so that's pretty much all I
have<00:02:11.840> to<00:02:11.990> do

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
have to do

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:15.460 
have to do
now<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.460> the<00:02:14.060> slight<00:02:14.300> nuance<00:02:14.600> with<00:02:14.840> doing<00:02:15.410> a

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
now the the slight nuance with doing a

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.680 
now the the slight nuance with doing a
darker<00:02:15.770> beer<00:02:16.010> is<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.670> residual<00:02:17.120> alkalinity

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:17.690 
darker beer is the residual alkalinity

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:21.190 
darker beer is the residual alkalinity
for<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.170> mash<00:02:18.380> pH<00:02:18.890> and<00:02:19.690> since<00:02:20.690> we're<00:02:21.020> looking

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:21.200 
for the mash pH and since we're looking

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.640 
for the mash pH and since we're looking
at<00:02:21.530> a<00:02:21.560> 30<00:02:22.550> SRM<00:02:23.180> beer<00:02:23.420> you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.110> see<00:02:24.320> that<00:02:24.530> our

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:24.650 
at a 30 SRM beer you can see that our

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.160 
at a 30 SRM beer you can see that our
residual<00:02:25.070> alkalinity<00:02:25.490> is<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.300> too<00:02:26.360> low<00:02:26.840> so

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.170 
residual alkalinity is is way too low so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:29.470 
residual alkalinity is is way too low so
as<00:02:27.830> we<00:02:28.010> start<00:02:28.250> adding<00:02:28.460> our<00:02:28.550> salts<00:02:28.940> to<00:02:29.090> get<00:02:29.240> the

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
as we start adding our salts to get the

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.260 
as we start adding our salts to get the
calcium<00:02:29.690> up<00:02:30.230> and<00:02:30.500> all<00:02:30.620> the<00:02:30.770> other<00:02:31.000> ions<00:02:32.000> up

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:32.270 
calcium up and all the other ions up

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:35.320 
calcium up and all the other ions up
into<00:02:32.540> the<00:02:32.960> London<00:02:33.740> range<00:02:34.130> we<00:02:34.850> also<00:02:35.030> have<00:02:35.240> to

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:35.330 
into the London range we also have to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:37.650 
into the London range we also have to
make<00:02:35.480> sure<00:02:35.540> that<00:02:35.900> we<00:02:36.050> try<00:02:36.770> to<00:02:36.800> get<00:02:37.040> our

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:37.660 
make sure that we try to get our

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.570 
make sure that we try to get our
residual<00:02:38.660> alkalinity<00:02:39.200> up<00:02:39.410> as<00:02:39.620> well<00:02:39.860> so<00:02:40.160> let's

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:40.580 
residual alkalinity up as well so let's

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.550 
residual alkalinity up as well so let's
take<00:02:40.790> a<00:02:40.820> look<00:02:41.060> at<00:02:41.390> the<00:02:41.660> different<00:02:42.050> salts<00:02:42.320> I<00:02:42.410> can

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
take a look at the different salts I can

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:45.340 
take a look at the different salts I can
and<00:02:42.740> again<00:02:43.450> notice<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.480> choc<00:02:44.900> raises

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
and again notice that choc raises

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.590 
and again notice that choc raises
residual<00:02:45.860> alkalinity<00:02:46.370> lowers<00:02:47.090> lower<00:02:47.300> lower

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
residual alkalinity lowers lower lower

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.840 
residual alkalinity lowers lower lower
so<00:02:47.840> I<00:02:47.870> can't<00:02:48.080> do<00:02:48.200> that<00:02:48.440> it<00:02:48.980> raises<00:02:49.250> that's

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:49.850 
so I can't do that it raises that's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.080 
so I can't do that it raises that's
baking<00:02:50.270> soda<00:02:50.980> okay<00:02:51.980> so<00:02:52.040> I'm<00:02:52.670> going<00:02:52.820> to<00:02:52.880> try<00:02:53.030> to

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
baking soda okay so I'm going to try to

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.810 
baking soda okay so I'm going to try to
focus<00:02:53.330> on<00:02:53.660> salts<00:02:54.650> that<00:02:54.830> raise<00:02:55.010> residual

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:55.820 
focus on salts that raise residual

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:59.560 
focus on salts that raise residual
alkalinity<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.530> that<00:02:57.770> I<00:02:57.800> can<00:02:58.190> get<00:02:58.760> that<00:02:58.910> to<00:02:59.390> say

00:02:59.560 --> 00:02:59.570 
alkalinity so that I can get that to say

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:03.330 
alkalinity so that I can get that to say
something<00:03:00.020> like<00:03:00.230> 25<00:03:01.160> to<00:03:01.550> 28<00:03:01.880> or<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.810> know<00:03:02.930> 30

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
something like 25 to 28 or you know 30

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.070 
something like 25 to 28 or you know 30
all<00:03:04.340> right<00:03:04.520> so<00:03:04.820> since<00:03:05.480> I<00:03:05.630> know<00:03:05.690> I<00:03:05.810> need<00:03:06.050> to

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:06.080 
all right so since I know I need to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:11.800 
all right so since I know I need to
bring<00:03:06.410> my<00:03:06.650> sulphate<00:03:07.130> up<00:03:07.340> and<00:03:07.610> my<00:03:07.970> calcium<00:03:10.810> you

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
bring my sulphate up and my calcium you

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:14.140 
bring my sulphate up and my calcium you
know<00:03:11.900> you<00:03:11.960> might<00:03:12.260> go<00:03:12.530> to<00:03:12.890> gypsum<00:03:13.760> right<00:03:13.940> away

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
know you might go to gypsum right away

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.450 
know you might go to gypsum right away
because<00:03:14.540> that<00:03:14.590> seems<00:03:15.590> to<00:03:15.770> be<00:03:15.890> convenient

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:16.460 
because that seems to be convenient

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.850 
because that seems to be convenient
however<00:03:16.790> it<00:03:16.940> lowers<00:03:17.210> residual<00:03:17.720> alkalinity<00:03:18.200> so

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
however it lowers residual alkalinity so

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.230 
however it lowers residual alkalinity so
I'm<00:03:19.160> gonna<00:03:19.280> try<00:03:19.520> to<00:03:19.550> figure<00:03:19.880> out<00:03:19.970> a<00:03:20.000> different

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:20.240 
I'm gonna try to figure out a different

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.530 
I'm gonna try to figure out a different
way<00:03:20.450> of<00:03:20.540> getting<00:03:20.840> that<00:03:21.160> now<00:03:22.160> first<00:03:23.150> thing<00:03:23.360> is

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
way of getting that now first thing is

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:25.360 
way of getting that now first thing is
is<00:03:23.690> I<00:03:23.810> can<00:03:23.990> use<00:03:24.020> chalk<00:03:24.500> because<00:03:24.950> that<00:03:25.100> that's

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:25.370 
is I can use chalk because that that's

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.730 
is I can use chalk because that that's
really<00:03:25.700> rate<00:03:25.970> raising<00:03:26.480> my<00:03:26.740> residual

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:27.740 
really rate raising my residual

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.370 
really rate raising my residual
alkalinity<00:03:28.220> and<00:03:28.310> just<00:03:28.760> adding<00:03:29.060> the<00:03:29.570> calcium

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:30.380 
alkalinity and just adding the calcium

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:31.930 
alkalinity and just adding the calcium
that<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.560> need<00:03:30.770> so<00:03:31.040> I'm<00:03:31.130> gonna<00:03:31.250> try<00:03:31.520> adding<00:03:31.850> a

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:31.940 
that I need so I'm gonna try adding a

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:34.570 
that I need so I'm gonna try adding a
gram<00:03:32.180> of<00:03:32.330> that<00:03:32.540> and<00:03:33.110> that<00:03:33.650> gets<00:03:33.830> me<00:03:33.980> closer<00:03:34.250> and

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 
gram of that and that gets me closer and

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
gram of that and that gets me closer and
it<00:03:35.000> does<00:03:35.180> bring<00:03:35.570> the<00:03:36.140> RA<00:03:37.010> up<00:03:37.340> a<00:03:37.430> little<00:03:37.610> bit<00:03:37.790> the

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
it does bring the RA up a little bit the

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.270 
it does bring the RA up a little bit the
other<00:03:38.630> thing<00:03:39.020> that<00:03:39.050> brings<00:03:39.350> it<00:03:39.590> up<00:03:39.710> is<00:03:39.890> baking

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
other thing that brings it up is baking

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:43.480 
other thing that brings it up is baking
soda<00:03:40.540> so<00:03:41.540> I'm<00:03:42.320> gonna<00:03:42.410> try<00:03:42.680> maybe<00:03:42.860> three<00:03:43.250> grams

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 
soda so I'm gonna try maybe three grams

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:46.780 
soda so I'm gonna try maybe three grams
of<00:03:43.670> that<00:03:44.380> I'm<00:03:45.380> getting<00:03:45.680> closer

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:46.790 
of that I'm getting closer

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:49.780 
of that I'm getting closer
my<00:03:47.150> magnesium<00:03:47.870> and<00:03:48.140> sulfate<00:03:48.770> is<00:03:48.920> low<00:03:49.190> so<00:03:49.520> I<00:03:49.550> can

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 
my magnesium and sulfate is low so I can

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:51.730 
my magnesium and sulfate is low so I can
go<00:03:49.910> in<00:03:50.120> with<00:03:50.300> some<00:03:50.330> Epsom<00:03:50.840> salt<00:03:51.080> I'll<00:03:51.320> try<00:03:51.530> one

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:51.740 
go in with some Epsom salt I'll try one

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:58.090 
go in with some Epsom salt I'll try one
gram<00:03:51.980> there<00:03:52.959> may<00:03:53.959> be<00:03:53.990> two<00:03:56.890> alright<00:03:57.890> that's

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
gram there may be two alright that's

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:04.240 
gram there may be two alright that's
getting<00:03:58.430> me<00:03:59.350> closer<00:04:00.350> definitely<00:04:02.950> but<00:04:03.950> I<00:04:03.980> can

00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:04.250 
getting me closer definitely but I can

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.130 
getting me closer definitely but I can
probably<00:04:04.459> go<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:04.970> three<00:04:07.300> okay

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:09.140 
probably go to three okay

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:11.080 
probably go to three okay
sulfate<00:04:09.770> went<00:04:10.190> a<00:04:10.220> little<00:04:10.310> bit<00:04:10.520> too<00:04:10.700> high<00:04:10.880> and

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
sulfate went a little bit too high and

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.670 
sulfate went a little bit too high and
when<00:04:11.180> I<00:04:11.209> go<00:04:11.390> back<00:04:11.570> to<00:04:11.630> 2.5<00:04:12.730> and<00:04:14.290> you<00:04:15.290> can<00:04:15.440> see<00:04:15.650> I

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:15.680 
when I go back to 2.5 and you can see I

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:17.590 
when I go back to 2.5 and you can see I
have<00:04:15.890> about<00:04:16.130> a<00:04:16.190> one<00:04:16.430> to<00:04:16.459> one<00:04:16.609> ratio<00:04:16.880> chloride

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
have about a one to one ratio chloride

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.810 
have about a one to one ratio chloride
to<00:04:17.780> sulfate<00:04:18.230> so<00:04:18.590> that<00:04:18.770> pretty<00:04:19.160> much<00:04:19.250> matches

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
to sulfate so that pretty much matches

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.039 
to sulfate so that pretty much matches
it's<00:04:19.970> just<00:04:20.150> you<00:04:20.450> know<00:04:20.540> a<00:04:20.570> little<00:04:20.690> bit<00:04:20.900> higher

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
it's just you know a little bit higher

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:23.890 
it's just you know a little bit higher
in<00:04:21.380> in<00:04:21.859> overall<00:04:22.400> amount<00:04:22.669> but<00:04:22.970> the<00:04:23.390> ratio<00:04:23.750> is

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
in in overall amount but the ratio is

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.860 
in in overall amount but the ratio is
what's<00:04:24.080> important

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:25.870 
what's important

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:28.350 
what's important
and<00:04:26.200> my<00:04:26.890> calcium<00:04:27.400> is<00:04:27.520> still<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:27.790> little<00:04:27.940> bit<00:04:28.180> low

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
and my calcium is still a little bit low

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.580 
and my calcium is still a little bit low
so<00:04:28.780> I<00:04:29.110> can<00:04:32.040> change<00:04:33.040> this<00:04:33.340> to<00:04:33.610> 1.5<00:04:34.290> okay<00:04:35.290> so<00:04:35.350> now

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:35.590 
so I can change this to 1.5 okay so now

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:37.620 
so I can change this to 1.5 okay so now
my<00:04:35.770> calcium<00:04:36.010> is<00:04:36.460> in<00:04:36.550> the<00:04:36.700> 50s<00:04:37.090> and<00:04:37.300> that's

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:37.630 
my calcium is in the 50s and that's

00:04:37.630 --> 00:04:39.780 
my calcium is in the 50s and that's
close<00:04:37.960> enough<00:04:37.990> for<00:04:38.440> me<00:04:38.560> now<00:04:39.340> let's<00:04:39.520> look<00:04:39.640> at

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:39.790 
close enough for me now let's look at

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:41.880 
close enough for me now let's look at
the<00:04:39.910> residual<00:04:40.270> alkalinity<00:04:40.780> it's<00:04:41.110> still<00:04:41.440> too

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
the residual alkalinity it's still too

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:45.210 
the residual alkalinity it's still too
low<00:04:42.100> so<00:04:42.370> I<00:04:43.210> don't<00:04:44.110> need<00:04:44.260> any<00:04:44.440> more<00:04:44.560> calcium<00:04:45.070> so

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
low so I don't need any more calcium so

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.670 
low so I don't need any more calcium so
I<00:04:45.250> can't<00:04:45.490> use<00:04:45.730> more<00:04:46.030> chalk<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:47.320> I'm<00:04:47.410> gonna<00:04:47.500> go

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
I can't use more chalk so I'm gonna go

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.130 
I can't use more chalk so I'm gonna go
back<00:04:47.710> to<00:04:48.010> baking<00:04:48.250> soda<00:04:48.610> and<00:04:49.000> try<00:04:49.300> maybe<00:04:49.540> 5

00:04:50.130 --> 00:04:50.140 
back to baking soda and try maybe 5

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.890 
back to baking soda and try maybe 5
grams<00:04:52.320> okay<00:04:53.320> and<00:04:53.890> my<00:04:54.880> sodium<00:04:55.240> is<00:04:55.420> a<00:04:55.450> little<00:04:55.780> bit

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
grams okay and my sodium is a little bit

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.730 
grams okay and my sodium is a little bit
high<00:04:56.080> but<00:04:56.380> that's<00:04:56.590> okay<00:04:56.980> and<00:04:58.290> my<00:04:59.290> residual

00:04:59.730 --> 00:04:59.740 
high but that's okay and my residual

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.490 
high but that's okay and my residual
alkalinity<00:05:00.220> is<00:05:00.520> close<00:05:01.270> enough<00:05:01.480> to<00:05:01.690> show<00:05:02.260> me

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:02.500 
alkalinity is close enough to show me

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.620 
alkalinity is close enough to show me
that<00:05:02.860> I'm<00:05:03.310> not<00:05:03.790> going<00:05:04.180> to<00:05:05.640> go<00:05:06.640> too<00:05:06.700> acidic<00:05:07.420> on

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
that I'm not going to go too acidic on

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.780 
that I'm not going to go too acidic on
my<00:05:07.960> mash<00:05:08.200> okay<00:05:08.680> so<00:05:08.740> it's<00:05:09.070> close<00:05:09.250> enough<00:05:09.280> I'm

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:09.790 
my mash okay so it's close enough I'm

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:12.150 
my mash okay so it's close enough I'm
not<00:05:09.940> going<00:05:10.090> to<00:05:10.180> go<00:05:10.380> I'd<00:05:11.380> rather<00:05:11.620> err<00:05:11.860> on<00:05:11.890> the

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.160 
not going to go I'd rather err on the

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.830 
not going to go I'd rather err on the
side<00:05:12.400> of<00:05:12.460> a<00:05:12.700> slightly<00:05:12.940> acidic<00:05:13.120> mashed<00:05:13.750> and

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
side of a slightly acidic mashed and

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:17.280 
side of a slightly acidic mashed and
then<00:05:14.230> to<00:05:14.440> basic<00:05:14.970> so<00:05:15.970> let's<00:05:16.450> call<00:05:16.720> that<00:05:16.930> done

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
then to basic so let's call that done

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:20.670 
then to basic so let's call that done
now<00:05:17.610> in<00:05:18.610> this<00:05:19.210> particular<00:05:19.570> case<00:05:19.930> I<00:05:20.110> got<00:05:20.290> lucky

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:20.680 
now in this particular case I got lucky

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:23.820 
now in this particular case I got lucky
because<00:05:21.030> all<00:05:22.030> of<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.480> salts<00:05:23.050> that<00:05:23.110> I<00:05:23.290> added<00:05:23.590> to

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
because all of the salts that I added to

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:30.090 
because all of the salts that I added to
the<00:05:24.580> mash<00:05:24.790> tun<00:05:26.580> also<00:05:27.810> has<00:05:28.810> a<00:05:28.990> an<00:05:29.170> addition<00:05:29.950> to

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
the mash tun also has a an addition to

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:31.410 
the mash tun also has a an addition to
the<00:05:30.220> boil<00:05:30.490> kettle<00:05:30.670> in<00:05:31.000> the<00:05:31.210> whatever

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:31.420 
the boil kettle in the whatever

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:33.090 
the boil kettle in the whatever
proportion<00:05:32.170> the<00:05:32.320> mash<00:05:32.530> the<00:05:32.740> sparge<00:05:33.040> water

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:33.100 
proportion the mash the sparge water

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:36.900 
proportion the mash the sparge water
ratio<00:05:33.520> was<00:05:33.970> so<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.270> can<00:05:34.510> see<00:05:34.780> that<00:05:35.620> it<00:05:36.370> wants

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
ratio was so you can see that it wants

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:39.420 
ratio was so you can see that it wants
me<00:05:36.970> to<00:05:37.000> add<00:05:37.180> 5<00:05:37.420> grams<00:05:37.900> to<00:05:38.380> the<00:05:38.530> mash<00:05:38.950> tun<00:05:39.220> and

00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:39.430 
me to add 5 grams to the mash tun and

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:41.490 
me to add 5 grams to the mash tun and
then<00:05:39.940> to<00:05:40.150> point<00:05:40.390> eight<00:05:40.540> grams<00:05:40.570> to<00:05:41.140> the<00:05:41.230> boil

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:41.500 
then to point eight grams to the boil

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:43.620 
then to point eight grams to the boil
kettle<00:05:41.650> the<00:05:42.520> only<00:05:42.670> thing<00:05:42.850> is<00:05:42.970> is<00:05:43.180> that<00:05:43.300> I<00:05:43.480> don't

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:43.630 
kettle the only thing is is that I don't

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.650 
kettle the only thing is is that I don't
really<00:05:43.750> like<00:05:43.930> adding<00:05:44.350> baking<00:05:45.160> soda<00:05:45.400> after<00:05:46.270> the

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:46.660 
really like adding baking soda after the

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:49.170 
really like adding baking soda after the
mash<00:05:46.870> is<00:05:47.080> over<00:05:47.410> because<00:05:47.850> really<00:05:48.850> all<00:05:49.000> you're

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.180 
mash is over because really all you're

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.500 
mash is over because really all you're
bringing<00:05:49.210> with<00:05:49.720> it<00:05:49.900> is<00:05:50.020> the<00:05:50.200> sodium<00:05:50.910> so<00:05:51.910> let's

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:52.510 
bringing with it is the sodium so let's

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:54.810 
bringing with it is the sodium so let's
just<00:05:52.690> say<00:05:52.810> that<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.110> target<00:05:53.530> wasn't<00:05:53.770> 82<00:05:54.400> let's

00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:54.820 
just say that the target wasn't 82 let's

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:57.240 
just say that the target wasn't 82 let's
say<00:05:54.970> that<00:05:55.120> it<00:05:55.240> was<00:05:55.360> about<00:05:55.630> 60<00:05:56.160> there's<00:05:57.160> gonna

00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:57.250 
say that it was about 60 there's gonna

00:05:57.250 --> 00:05:59.910 
say that it was about 60 there's gonna
overwrite<00:05:57.700> that<00:05:57.730> temporary<00:05:58.720> just<00:05:59.530> to<00:05:59.680> show

00:05:59.910 --> 00:05:59.920 
overwrite that temporary just to show

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.250 
overwrite that temporary just to show
you<00:05:59.980> now<00:06:00.460> in<00:06:00.880> order<00:06:01.450> to<00:06:01.600> get<00:06:01.750> my<00:06:01.870> residual

00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:02.260 
you now in order to get my residual

00:06:02.260 --> 00:06:04.710 
you now in order to get my residual
alkalinity<00:06:02.800> up<00:06:03.010> I<00:06:03.190> had<00:06:03.340> to<00:06:03.460> use<00:06:03.580> enough<00:06:04.330> baking

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:04.720 
alkalinity up I had to use enough baking

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.350 
alkalinity up I had to use enough baking
soda<00:06:04.960> to<00:06:05.140> do<00:06:05.290> that<00:06:05.500> but<00:06:05.800> now<00:06:05.950> if<00:06:06.190> I<00:06:06.310> add<00:06:06.490> that<00:06:06.790> to

00:06:07.350 --> 00:06:07.360 
soda to do that but now if I add that to

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:09.150 
soda to do that but now if I add that to
the<00:06:07.510> boil<00:06:07.930> kettle<00:06:08.080> I'm<00:06:08.530> adding<00:06:08.860> even<00:06:09.010> more

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:09.160 
the boil kettle I'm adding even more

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.450 
the boil kettle I'm adding even more
salt<00:06:09.670> and<00:06:10.020> frankly<00:06:11.020> there's<00:06:11.260> no<00:06:11.440> reason<00:06:11.920> to<00:06:11.950> in

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:12.460 
salt and frankly there's no reason to in

00:06:12.460 --> 00:06:14.490 
salt and frankly there's no reason to in
after<00:06:13.090> the<00:06:13.210> mash<00:06:13.390> is<00:06:13.570> over<00:06:13.840> because<00:06:14.140> the<00:06:14.290> pH

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:14.500 
after the mash is over because the pH

00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.680 
after the mash is over because the pH
concerns<00:06:15.070> are<00:06:15.280> done<00:06:15.820> at<00:06:16.030> that<00:06:16.180> point

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
concerns are done at that point

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.980 
concerns are done at that point
so<00:06:17.110> this<00:06:17.320> utility<00:06:17.920> also<00:06:18.070> allows<00:06:18.750> exclusion<00:06:19.750> in

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:19.990 
so this utility also allows exclusion in

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:21.930 
so this utility also allows exclusion in
the<00:06:20.110> in<00:06:20.350> the<00:06:20.650> boil<00:06:21.100> kettle<00:06:21.190> so<00:06:21.610> if<00:06:21.700> you<00:06:21.790> just

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:21.940 
the in the boil kettle so if you just

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.390 
the in the boil kettle so if you just
click<00:06:22.180> that<00:06:22.420> checkbox<00:06:22.780> or<00:06:23.170> uncheck<00:06:23.590> it<00:06:23.770> you'll

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:24.400 
click that checkbox or uncheck it you'll

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:25.980 
click that checkbox or uncheck it you'll
see<00:06:24.580> that<00:06:24.730> the<00:06:24.880> boil<00:06:25.120> kettle<00:06:25.330> addition<00:06:25.840> goes

00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:25.990 
see that the boil kettle addition goes

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:28.410 
see that the boil kettle addition goes
to<00:06:26.230> zero<00:06:26.530> now<00:06:27.430> the<00:06:27.490> important<00:06:28.000> thing<00:06:28.030> here<00:06:28.390> is

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:28.420 
to zero now the important thing here is

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.230 
to zero now the important thing here is
that<00:06:28.890> my<00:06:29.890> residual<00:06:30.310> alkalinity<00:06:30.790> stayed<00:06:31.120> the

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:31.240 
that my residual alkalinity stayed the

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.470 
that my residual alkalinity stayed the
same<00:06:31.270> up<00:06:31.780> high<00:06:32.080> where<00:06:32.350> I<00:06:32.380> need<00:06:32.710> it<00:06:32.740> but<00:06:33.700> now<00:06:33.970> my

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:34.480 
same up high where I need it but now my

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.780 
same up high where I need it but now my
sodium<00:06:35.370> see<00:06:36.370> this<00:06:36.550> is<00:06:36.760> the<00:06:37.030> main

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:37.790 
sodium see this is the main

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:40.090 
sodium see this is the main
profile<00:06:38.449> this<00:06:38.930> is<00:06:38.960> the<00:06:39.350> overall<00:06:39.889> water

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:40.100 
profile this is the overall water

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:42.070 
profile this is the overall water
profile<00:06:40.610> so<00:06:40.820> you<00:06:40.910> can<00:06:41.060> see<00:06:41.240> that<00:06:41.449> when<00:06:41.840> the

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
profile so you can see that when the

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:43.689 
profile so you can see that when the
whole<00:06:42.230> batch<00:06:42.410> is<00:06:42.650> done<00:06:42.680> it<00:06:43.190> more<00:06:43.460> closely

00:06:43.689 --> 00:06:43.699 
whole batch is done it more closely

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:46.629 
whole batch is done it more closely
matches<00:06:44.300> that<00:06:44.449> target<00:06:45.070> so<00:06:46.070> that's<00:06:46.250> one<00:06:46.460> way<00:06:46.610> of

00:06:46.629 --> 00:06:46.639 
matches that target so that's one way of

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:51.659 
matches that target so that's one way of
doing<00:06:46.910> that<00:06:47.090> another<00:06:47.600> way<00:06:49.120> is<00:06:50.120> with<00:06:50.840> chalk

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:51.669 
doing that another way is with chalk

00:06:51.669 --> 00:06:55.930 
doing that another way is with chalk
let's<00:06:52.669> say<00:06:52.880> that<00:06:53.150> I<00:06:53.540> used<00:06:54.440> say<00:06:54.889> three<00:06:55.280> grams<00:06:55.580> of

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:55.940 
let's say that I used say three grams of

00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.070 
let's say that I used say three grams of
chalk<00:06:56.270> to<00:06:56.540> get<00:06:56.720> my<00:06:58.300> residual<00:06:59.300> alkalinity<00:06:59.810> up

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
chalk to get my residual alkalinity up

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:05.290 
chalk to get my residual alkalinity up
and<00:07:00.850> but<00:07:01.850> my<00:07:02.229> calcium<00:07:03.229> is<00:07:03.410> now<00:07:03.560> going<00:07:03.949> over<00:07:04.340> by

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:05.300 
and but my calcium is now going over by

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:09.430 
and but my calcium is now going over by
thirty<00:07:05.900> one<00:07:06.710> ppm<00:07:07.520> now<00:07:08.210> I<00:07:08.240> can<00:07:08.540> uncheck<00:07:08.990> that<00:07:09.199> so

00:07:09.430 --> 00:07:09.440 
thirty one ppm now I can uncheck that so

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.440 
thirty one ppm now I can uncheck that so
I<00:07:09.470> don't<00:07:09.590> add<00:07:09.919> chalk<00:07:10.250> to<00:07:10.460> the<00:07:10.550> boil<00:07:10.760> kettle<00:07:10.850> and

00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:11.450 
I don't add chalk to the boil kettle and

00:07:11.450 --> 00:07:15.850 
I don't add chalk to the boil kettle and
you<00:07:11.900> can<00:07:12.050> see<00:07:12.260> that<00:07:13.330> you<00:07:14.330> know<00:07:14.450> sixty<00:07:14.990> and

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
you can see that you know sixty and

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:18.340 
you can see that you know sixty and
sixty<00:07:16.100> four<00:07:16.550> versus<00:07:17.210> fifty<00:07:17.570> two<00:07:17.750> that's<00:07:18.110> kind

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:18.350 
sixty four versus fifty two that's kind

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:20.200 
sixty four versus fifty two that's kind
of<00:07:18.440> acceptable<00:07:19.040> it's<00:07:19.250> not<00:07:19.490> you<00:07:20.000> know<00:07:20.090> it's

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:20.210 
of acceptable it's not you know it's

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:26.469 
of acceptable it's not you know it's
only<00:07:20.300> 12<00:07:20.720> ppm<00:07:21.370> all<00:07:22.370> right<00:07:22.580> so<00:07:24.610> that's<00:07:25.610> that's<00:07:26.300> a

00:07:26.469 --> 00:07:26.479 
only 12 ppm all right so that's that's a

00:07:26.479 --> 00:07:28.870 
only 12 ppm all right so that's that's a
nice<00:07:26.630> feature<00:07:26.900> of<00:07:27.050> this<00:07:27.310> utility<00:07:28.310> that<00:07:28.610> it
