00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:05.990
 we are going to disassemble the head of 

00:00:02.699 --> 00:00:07.140
 printing a hp photos + printer 

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:09.630
 5510 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.680
 first lift the lid where they go 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:12.680
 the ink cartridges 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:17.449
 we have here a piece of plastic that 

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.070
 in which it makes tilting the lid is 

00:00:17.449 --> 00:00:21.039
 atypical with care we throw towards 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.220
 us the pressure 

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:25.110
 if you will be back 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.980
 and carefully 

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:30.930
 we open it we leave another page open 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.560
 we are removing the screws that are 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.560
 that is to say 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.670
 one 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.910
 here 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.930
 those are the visible screws and one 

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.080
 Be careful with whoever is here 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.280
 under the mark and passing the finger 

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.390
 we will notice a small crack there 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.470
 we can click with the screwdriver 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.470
 directly or that is the sticker 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:15.470
 red 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:27.530
 once loosen all the tournaments the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.530
 Screen is removed with care 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:34.009
 because an immense eyelash is removed 

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:36.759
 be here what you have been here with 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:36.759
 very careful 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.360
 we have two screws then here 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:46.549
 we paint our two screws 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:56.710
 and the lid is loose for us 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:58.780
 complete towards 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.400
 here we have the head that is here 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.250
 of the cartridges in this case has us 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:05.220
 that this is the head ok then this 

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.990
 it has some springs 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.570
 what we have to do is very 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:11.570
 simple is to remove forwards 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.069
 this other same 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:19.290
 and it's already loose 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:26.180
 you have to carry some flat cables that 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 they are worth as much as is 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.130
 that we are removing transplant and balls 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.960
 and we already have the head loose 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.090
 when it is going to be placed in the problem 

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.130
 because this takes a position and it 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:40.770
 they come back plugged in they plug in again 

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:43.020
 on your site 

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:45.120
 this to clean it can be cleaned very 

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.990
 well always trying not to fall 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.660
 this circuit getting this zone 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:52.370
 in warm water with a little salt in 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.650
 case that is very very very very 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.340
 saturated and leave it after it dries 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:00.380
 well you can not put it ever wet 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.340
 and well this would be all 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.340
 the whole theme 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:08.550
 that serves as learning thanks
