learn to play the hi-hat with a tight

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.270 
learn to play the hi-hat with a tight
sound<00:01:34.250> as<00:01:35.250> opposed<00:01:35.610> to<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.820> loose<00:01:36.060> sound<00:01:37.280> the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280 
sound as opposed to a loose sound the

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.859 
sound as opposed to a loose sound the
reason<00:01:38.610> I<00:01:38.700> say<00:01:38.909> that<00:01:39.150> not<00:01:39.270> because<00:01:39.329> a<00:01:39.600> tight

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
reason I say that not because a tight

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:41.420 
reason I say that not because a tight
sound<00:01:40.110> is<00:01:40.320> better<00:01:40.530> because<00:01:40.829> it's<00:01:41.040> not<00:01:41.220> they're

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:41.430 
sound is better because it's not they're

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:45.109 
sound is better because it's not they're
both<00:01:41.579> very<00:01:42.000> useful<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.049> musical<00:01:43.850> it's<00:01:44.850> a<00:01:44.970> bit

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
both very useful and musical it's a bit

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.850 
both very useful and musical it's a bit
more<00:01:45.270> difficult<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.659> control<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.409> do<00:01:46.649> that

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
more difficult to control so to do that

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.190 
more difficult to control so to do that
how<00:01:47.340> do<00:01:47.399> you<00:01:47.520> foot<00:01:47.759> about<00:01:48.030> nine-tenths<00:01:48.960> of<00:01:48.990> the

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:49.200 
how do you foot about nine-tenths of the

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.249
