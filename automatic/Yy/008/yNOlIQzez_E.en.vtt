00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.350
 good to all welcome to the retail 

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:07.330
 crisis has been a long time since 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.400
 homemade weapon and good today we are going to make a 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:12.370
 slingshot that is very very easy to do 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.280
 in the matter of foreigners of fixed of 26 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.230
 at home you're only going to need a clip 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.339
 you can make the model you want is 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:22.869
 say good because the clamp can do 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.749
 this produces more and in this case it's going to 

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.480
 do with this look and in addition to the 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:29.880
 you're going to need a rubber band this is 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.320
 An eraser 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.750
 of the normals of the elastic 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.500
 the circulars I think I've already cut 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.500
 but 

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.900
 adhesive or insulating tape 

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:48.690
 the first thing to do is going to be 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:51.450
 put the pint together and go around 

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.820
 this with an insulating tape or zeal 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.620
 that you stick so that it stays with the 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:00.540
 shape of the slingshot in the and 

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:03.180
 well we already have this right 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:05.320
 or good is no longer going to loosen and as you see 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.180
 it already has the shape of it 

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:09.400
 of the slingshot now you just have to 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:12.250
 put the rubber band on it would work as a 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.570
 slingshot so now what are we going to 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.909
 do is going to be placed 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.310
 or tie rather one end of the rubber to 

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 this side and another 

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:23.170
 to this 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:25.600
 and that is what would do some retouching and already the 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.280
 we would have so we go there good as 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.229
 you can see we already have back and of form 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.850
 very fast a soul will bring a slingshot 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:35.439
 in this case 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.439
 but nothing good like everyone else 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.920
 you are going to see that to throw with a lot of power 

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.490
 and now there is only the challenge that to put 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.350
 here as a fund to be able to support the 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.930
 subjects throw two so much more 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:53.210
 easy 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.550
 so let's put here I have 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.520
 decided to put a piece of paper so 

00:01:55.550 --> 00:02:00.000
 now he showed him how I'm going to put it and 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.160
 I would be made 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.840
 well I cut a piece of paper more 

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:06.540
 or less and as you can see the size of the 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:10.250
 clip to give you an idea and I 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.260
 folded four times in half 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:15.410
 and with the folds already made this 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.300
 it would work so I put it here and so 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.480
 we would have to make the shots of 

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:22.280
 a much easier way so what 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.170
 let's fix and go with the tests 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.570
 of visuals, well, now that 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.600
 still slingshot is already complete we see 

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:32.510
 here the piece of paper that we have fixed with 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:35.930
 insulating tape and you just have to grab 

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:39.560
 and it goes perfectly 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:42.230
 as you see everything with materials made 

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.660
 per house served to launch any 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.170
 small pebble type until vegetables 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:50.030
 like lentils chickpeas good what is 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:54.099
 I happen here what I had most to 

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:57.459
 hand they were airsoft balines so 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:57.459
 to throw 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.180
 we would only have to 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:04.180
 place the pellet 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.930
 here 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.290
 and throw 

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:12.489
 so let's put on this wall a 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.380
 folio of chance 

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.780
 well at the end we will launch a stroke 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:19.380
 of eraser that would stay very 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:22.420
 small and good 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:24.220
 you see it's bigger so you see that 

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:27.360
 can throw bigger objects and so 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:27.360
 I show that too 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.510
 its size so we're going to place it 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.040
 like throwing, you are going to see the function 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.489
 that with which to throw that is pretty 

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:36.489
 big 

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:52.540
 good to give you an idea of the 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.470
 force with which pulls look where has 

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:55.470
 stayed from the eraser 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.470
 look at the hole he has made 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.510
 this just one shot 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:09.569
 so good you can already get an idea 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.170
 of the type of shot you are going to be able to 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.000
 do 

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:16.180
 and it's more 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.590
 this rubber is a very thin and very soft 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.080
 if I put a more powerful rubber more 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:26.200
 resistant as it could be a rubber 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:29.790
 this style much more resistant 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.120
 you could throw bigger stones 

00:04:29.790 --> 00:04:36.510
 and a lot more distance and that this 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:39.090
 it is already powerful so good I hope that 

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:41.040
 you liked it as you know you have in 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:45.260
 the description of this video and in the 

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:45.260
 Featured channels on my channel 

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:51.550
 channel called lethal crisis' bets 

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:53.500
 so you already know how to subscribe to that 

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.750
 this one if you are not and well I hope that 

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.750
 you liked it and this other goodbye
