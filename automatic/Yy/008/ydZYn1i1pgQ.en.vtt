kind<00:02:34.220> of<00:02:34.250> go<00:02:34.370> through<00:02:34.400> the<00:02:34.640> level<00:02:34.910> here<00:02:35.120> this

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
kind of go through the level here this

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:37.060 
kind of go through the level here this
should<00:02:35.960> get<00:02:36.050> a<00:02:36.110> general<00:02:36.470> idea<00:02:36.590> of<00:02:36.860> the

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:37.070 
should get a general idea of the

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.930 
should get a general idea of the
gameplay<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.130> game<00:02:40.280> is<00:02:40.430> great<00:02:40.580> it's<00:02:40.850> just

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
gameplay and the game is great it's just

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.610 
gameplay and the game is great it's just
a<00:02:41.180> little<00:02:41.450> slow<00:02:41.690> in<00:02:41.720> the<00:02:41.840> front<00:02:42.170> frame<00:02:42.410> rate

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:42.620 
a little slow in the front frame rate

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.650 
a little slow in the front frame rate
areas<00:02:42.920> you<00:02:43.040> can<00:02:43.130> see<00:02:43.310> as<00:02:43.400> he<00:02:43.520> runs<00:02:43.760> it's<00:02:44.210> not<00:02:44.450> as

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
areas you can see as he runs it's not as

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.910 
areas you can see as he runs it's not as
smooth<00:02:45.560> as<00:02:45.740> it<00:02:45.770> could<00:02:45.920> be<00:02:47.380> but<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.740> certainly

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 
smooth as it could be but it certainly

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.680 
smooth as it could be but it certainly
gives<00:02:49.220> you<00:02:49.400> a<00:02:49.430> great<00:02:49.640> feeling<00:02:50.060> of<00:02:50.360> butt

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:50.690 
gives you a great feeling of butt

00:02:50.690 --> 00:02:52.930 
gives you a great feeling of butt
kicking<00:02:51.020> that's<00:02:51.230> for<00:02:51.440> sure<00:02:51.590> it<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.550> a<00:02:52.580> lot<00:02:52.820> of

kicking that's for sure it is a lot of

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.020 
kicking that's for sure it is a lot of
fun<00:02:53.410> I'm<00:02:54.410> hoping<00:02:54.770> that<00:02:54.830> an<00:02:55.160> update<00:02:55.580> that<00:02:55.760> comes

a special move and I'll go ahead and

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:10.450 
a special move and I'll go ahead and

anything so this one basically emblazon
is<00:03:19.550> your<00:03:19.640> shield<00:03:19.940> with<00:03:20.240> electrical<00:03:20.900> power

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
is your shield with electrical power

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.690 
is your shield with electrical power
because<00:03:21.709> if<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:21.920> hold<00:03:22.130> down<00:03:22.190> the<00:03:22.430> attack

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
because if you hold down the attack

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.230 
because if you hold down the attack
button<00:03:23.320> you<00:03:24.320> basically<00:03:24.650> get<00:03:24.860> special<00:03:25.430> attack

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.240 
button you basically get special attack

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.390 
button you basically get special attack
so<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.600> one's<00:03:26.780> kind<00:03:26.959> of<00:03:27.020> fun<00:03:27.230> here<00:03:27.470> if<00:03:28.280> you

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
so this one's kind of fun here if you

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.540 
so this one's kind of fun here if you
hold<00:03:28.580> down<00:03:28.670> at<00:03:29.030> least<00:03:29.120> with<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.480> claw<00:03:29.959> weapon

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:30.550 
hold down at least with the claw weapon

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:32.830 
hold down at least with the claw weapon
so<00:03:31.550> it<00:03:31.640> kind<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.820> does<00:03:31.970> a<00:03:32.000> rapid<00:03:32.390> punch<00:03:32.630> like

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
so it kind of does a rapid punch like

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.869 
so it kind of does a rapid punch like
that<00:03:32.870> it's<00:03:33.170> kind<00:03:33.290> of<00:03:33.380> fun

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:37.879 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.339 

so<00:03:38.879> you<00:03:38.969> just<00:03:39.090> kind<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.329> take<00:03:39.689> them<00:03:39.840> out<00:03:39.930> good

so you just kind of take them out good
time<00:03:40.530> and<00:03:40.769> then<00:03:41.099> of<00:03:41.280> course<00:03:41.340> you<00:03:41.609> get
