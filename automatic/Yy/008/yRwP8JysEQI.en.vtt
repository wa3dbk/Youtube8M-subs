event um there's snow everywhere I mean

actually<00:00:27.570> all<00:00:27.750> the<00:00:27.900> snow<00:00:28.140> it's<00:00:28.830> pretty<00:00:29.039> cool

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
actually all the snow it's pretty cool

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.700 
actually all the snow it's pretty cool
and<00:00:29.550> we're<00:00:29.699> used<00:00:29.820> to<00:00:29.910> living<00:00:30.150> in<00:00:30.240> like<00:00:30.710> stop

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
and we're used to living in like stop

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.470 
and we're used to living in like stop
socal<00:00:32.219> so<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.700> like<00:00:32.850> a<00:00:33.030> pretty<00:00:33.329> big

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
socal so it's like a pretty big

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.569 
socal so it's like a pretty big
transition<00:00:34.020> but<00:00:34.710> I<00:00:34.739> mean<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.190> events<00:00:35.399> really

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
transition but I mean the events really

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.130 
transition but I mean the events really
cool<00:00:35.850> actually<00:00:36.090> didn't<00:00:36.510> expect<00:00:36.780> it<00:00:36.870> to<00:00:36.989> be<00:00:37.110> so

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
cool actually didn't expect it to be so

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.830 
cool actually didn't expect it to be so
large<00:00:37.469> before<00:00:38.309> actually<00:00:38.730> seeing<00:00:38.969> the<00:00:39.180> stadium

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
large before actually seeing the stadium

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.930 
large before actually seeing the stadium
so<00:00:40.500> I<00:00:40.980> don't<00:00:41.250> know<00:00:41.309> I'm<00:00:41.460> really<00:00:41.579> excited

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:41.940 
so I don't know I'm really excited

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.389 
so I don't know I'm really excited
there's<00:00:42.899> I<00:00:43.170> saw<00:00:43.500> the<00:00:43.559> lines<00:00:43.829> outside<00:00:44.040> they

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
there's I saw the lines outside they

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.310 
there's I saw the lines outside they
were<00:00:44.460> huge<00:00:44.850> there's<00:00:45.149> like<00:00:45.300> so<00:00:45.629> many<00:00:45.899> people

both<00:01:37.560> definitely<00:01:37.979> like<00:01:38.130> way<00:01:38.520> up<00:01:38.700> there<00:01:38.880> and

both definitely like way up there and

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.399 
both definitely like way up there and
the<00:01:39.180> zoo<00:01:39.329> bublé's<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.840> course<00:01:40.049> like<00:01:40.259> one<00:01:40.380> of

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
the zoo bublé's of course like one of

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.740 
the zoo bublé's of course like one of
the<00:01:40.530> top<00:01:40.560> teams<00:01:40.860> from<00:01:41.070> Korea<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.640> I<00:01:42.600> don't

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
the top teams from Korea and I don't

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.969 
the top teams from Korea and I don't
know<00:01:42.810> they're<00:01:43.020> all<00:01:43.140> really<00:01:43.320> strong<00:01:43.680> it's

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
know they're all really strong it's

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.740 
know they're all really strong it's
going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> be<00:01:44.310> it's<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.700> really<00:01:44.909> tough<00:01:45.119> group<00:01:45.390> I

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:45.750 
going to be it's a really tough group I

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:47.270 
going to be it's a really tough group I
mean<00:01:46.229> this<00:01:46.380> tournaments<00:01:46.799> really<00:01:46.979> tough<00:01:47.130> in

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
mean this tournaments really tough in

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.210 
mean this tournaments really tough in
general<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.240> hopefully<00:01:48.990> we<00:01:49.320> managed<00:01:49.590> to<00:01:49.649> come

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
general but hopefully we managed to come

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.100 
general but hopefully we managed to come
out<00:01:50.310> of<00:01:50.340> our<00:01:50.490> group<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:50.970> think<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.960> team

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
out of our group I think that the team

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.800 
out of our group I think that the team
i'll<00:01:52.229> give<00:01:52.380> us<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.649> most<00:01:52.829> competition<00:01:53.460> is

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:53.810 
i'll give us the most competition is

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.660 
i'll give us the most competition is
probably<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.930> zoo<00:01:55.079> bublé's<00:01:55.470> but<00:01:55.920> it's<00:01:56.369> honestly

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
probably a zoo bublé's but it's honestly

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.249 
probably a zoo bublé's but it's honestly
anyone's<00:01:57.180> guess<00:01:57.390> as<00:01:57.420> to<00:01:57.719> how<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:57.869> matches

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
anyone's guess as to how the matches

00:01:58.259 --> 00:01:59.580 
anyone's guess as to how the matches
will<00:01:58.380> go<00:01:58.530> so

00:01:59.580 --> 00:01:59.590 
will go so

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.599 
will go so
