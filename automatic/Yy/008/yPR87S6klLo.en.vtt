00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
track while you're go and let's go and

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.369 
track while you're go and let's go and

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
it switches perfect very easy very

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:08.149 
it switches perfect very easy very
simple<00:01:06.000> build<00:01:06.540> so<00:01:06.780> on<00:01:07.080> this<00:01:07.560> one<00:01:07.740> here<00:01:07.979> I'm

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:08.159 
simple build so on this one here I'm

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:10.160 
simple build so on this one here I'm
just<00:01:08.250> going<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.790> you<00:01:09.420> know<00:01:09.540> what<00:01:09.659> I'm<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.930> even

just going to you know what I'm not even
going<00:01:10.350> to<00:01:10.520> make<00:01:11.520> another<00:01:11.820> one<00:01:12.000> I<00:01:12.060> don't<00:01:12.240> think

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
going to make another one I don't think

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.530 
going to make another one I don't think
I<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.750> to<00:01:12.960> it's<00:01:13.110> pretty<00:01:13.740> straightforward<00:01:14.540> as

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
t-junction comes into play this is as

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:29.030 
t-junction comes into play this is as
simple<00:01:25.680> as<00:01:25.920> it<00:01:26.100> is<00:01:27.020> block<00:01:28.020> block<00:01:28.229> this<00:01:28.860> is<00:01:29.009> a

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
simple as it is block block this is a

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.200 
simple as it is block block this is a
sticky<00:01:29.460> piston<00:01:29.670> so<00:01:31.670> block<00:01:32.670> block<00:01:35.210> sticky

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
sticky piston so block block sticky

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.609 
sticky piston so block block sticky
piston<00:01:37.040> redstone<00:01:38.040> block<00:01:38.369> and<00:01:39.290> trapped<00:01:40.290> chest

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
piston redstone block and trapped chest

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.050 
piston redstone block and trapped chest
but<00:01:40.890> I<00:01:40.920> don't<00:01:41.130> think<00:01:41.280> I'm<00:01:41.369> gonna<00:01:41.460> actually<00:01:41.729> I

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
but I don't think I'm gonna actually I

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.179 
but I don't think I'm gonna actually I
guess<00:01:42.299> I<00:01:42.420> could<00:01:42.630> put<00:01:42.869> a<00:01:42.899> trap<00:01:43.170> yes<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.680> I<00:01:43.860> really

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
guess I could put a trap yes if I really

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.990 
guess I could put a trap yes if I really
wanted<00:01:44.460> to<00:01:45.290> let's<00:01:46.290> just<00:01:47.040> go<00:01:47.280> just<00:01:47.640> to<00:01:47.759> show<00:01:47.939> you

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
wanted to let's just go just to show you

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.520 
wanted to let's just go just to show you
guys<00:01:48.119> that<00:01:48.270> it's<00:01:48.570> a<00:01:48.659> trap<00:01:48.899> chest<00:01:49.200> and<00:01:49.409> not<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
guys that it's a trap chest and not a

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:54.920 
guys that it's a trap chest and not a
regular<00:01:49.950> chest<00:01:50.189> so<00:01:52.220> Chuck<00:01:53.220> chest<00:01:53.810> that<00:01:54.810> was<00:01:54.899> a

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
regular chest so Chuck chest that was a

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:59.090 
regular chest so Chuck chest that was a
double<00:01:55.229> i<00:01:55.439> guess<00:01:55.680> a<00:01:55.860> I<00:01:57.680> works<00:01:58.680> either<00:01:58.829> way<00:01:58.950> but

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
double i guess a I works either way but

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.700 
double i guess a I works either way but
pretty<00:02:00.060> much<00:02:00.119> that<00:02:00.450> simple<00:02:00.899> let's<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.500> rid<00:02:01.680> of
