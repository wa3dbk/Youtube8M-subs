was the last console with married just

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:01.869 
was the last console with married just
because<00:00:59.329> they're<00:01:00.329> not<00:01:00.600> comparable<00:01:01.109> systems

00:01:01.869 --> 00:01:01.879 
because they're not comparable systems

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.759 
because they're not comparable systems
like<00:01:02.879> like<00:01:03.239> how<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.510> Genesis<00:01:04.049> was<00:01:04.199> with<00:01:04.439> the

so<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.180> me<00:01:09.299> I<00:01:10.760> think<00:01:11.760> I<00:01:12.119> mean<00:01:12.360> that<00:01:12.540> that

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
so for me I think I mean that that

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.429 
so for me I think I mean that that
fucking<00:01:13.470> headline<00:01:13.860> reads<00:01:14.400> like<00:01:15.049> just<00:01:16.049> every

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
store I mean first of all I think a lot

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.520 
store I mean first of all I think a lot
of<00:01:20.490> reasons<00:01:20.850> why<00:01:21.060> a<00:01:21.090> lot<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> people<00:01:21.509> who<00:01:22.020> who

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
of reasons why a lot of people who who

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.920 
of reasons why a lot of people who who
are<00:01:22.560> our<00:01:23.070> age<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.939> age<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> the<00:01:24.659> people<00:01:24.869> who

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
are our age the age of the people who

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.450 
are our age the age of the people who
wrote<00:01:25.140> this<00:01:25.350> might<00:01:25.650> think<00:01:25.890> that<00:01:25.950> is<00:01:26.159> because

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
wrote this might think that is because

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.929 
wrote this might think that is because
it<00:01:26.640> was<00:01:26.820> the<00:01:26.970> last<00:01:27.150> one<00:01:27.299> that<00:01:27.390> mattered<00:01:27.720> to<00:01:27.869> us

00:01:28.929 --> 00:01:28.939 
it was the last one that mattered to us

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:31.280 
it was the last one that mattered to us
but<00:01:29.939> to<00:01:30.090> I<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:30.570> non-comparable

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
but to I think the non-comparable

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.429 
but to I think the non-comparable
systems<00:01:32.040> does<00:01:32.400> actually<00:01:32.790> mean<00:01:33.390> that<00:01:33.420> it<00:01:33.960> they
