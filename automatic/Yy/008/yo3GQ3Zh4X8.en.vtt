00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.920
 automotive vehicles in the army just 

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:24.480
 indispensable 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.790
 today with glasses at its base 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:28.770
 mounted about 90 percent 

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.869
 armament on the terrain it is not 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.570
 inferior tracked but in speed 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.690
 even surpasses though in essence they are all hers 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.800
 merits 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.390
 record high passability 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.140
 load capacity and simplicity in 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.510
 service 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:44.480
 Today troops sinter wheelbase 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.850
 work jet systems with 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:48.890
 anti-aircraft fire systems and complexes 

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.079
 air defense and it's far from 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.910
 a complete list with the main 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.040
 requirement for all army cars 

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.230
 the ability to conquer off-road without 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.670
 special training 

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.989
 these cars very quickly won 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:04.600
 authority from motorists because 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:05.720
 permeability is much higher than it was in 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.000
 by car 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:11.030
 soviet union comfort 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.700
 much higher but most importantly all the same 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:15.979
 it is our acceptance into service 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.410
 new cars have to break stereotypes 

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:20.539
 if for previous models is 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:22.280
 driving is considered extreme then for 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:24.500
 Army maz is a normal mode 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.600
 exploitation capabilities of modern 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.759
 SUV military motorists 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.090
 check on a specialized strip 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:31.090
 obstacles 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.920
 800 meters extreme strip 

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:40.230
 the wooded passage just explosive 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.720
 obstacle climb steep slopes 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:46.050
 the most difficult part of overcoming the moat 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:49.080
 the depth of the order of meter the width of this more 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:51.170
 for MAZ and driver work at the limit 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.170
 of opportunities 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.640
 all cars pass the small test 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:58.100
 speeds today it is justified at least 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.110
 figurative eight-cylinder engine 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:03.210
 over 300 horsepower can 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.410
 also overclock how he set 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.410
 up to one hundred kilometers per hour 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.909
 and yet how good the car has not been 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.069
 without a man she remains soulless 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:18.230
 the technique is the driver gives it 

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:20.420
 nature and reveals potential 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:22.519
 opportunities by military motorists 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.629
 turn the vehicle into 

00:02:22.519 --> 00:02:25.280
 combat unit
