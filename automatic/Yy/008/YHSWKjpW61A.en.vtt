cut<00:02:32.840> your<00:02:33.170> supposed<00:02:33.560> to<00:02:33.650> go<00:02:34.239> diagonal<00:02:35.239> like

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
cut your supposed to go diagonal like

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.830 
cut your supposed to go diagonal like
this<00:02:37.989> this<00:02:38.989> is<00:02:39.200> a<00:02:39.230> way<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.650> could<00:02:40.840> all

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
this this is a way that I could all

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.009 
this this is a way that I could all
right<00:02:42.050> and<00:02:42.610> only<00:02:43.610> this<00:02:43.940> much<00:02:44.269> of<00:02:44.480> hair<00:02:44.690> comes

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
right and only this much of hair comes

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:49.449 
right and only this much of hair comes
out<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.820> it's<00:02:47.239> cut<00:02:47.570> into<00:02:48.019> a<00:02:48.050> layer<00:02:48.769> when<00:02:49.100> I<00:02:49.130> cut

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
out and it's cut into a layer when I cut

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:52.740 
out and it's cut into a layer when I cut
it<00:02:49.580> like<00:02:49.730> that<00:02:50.000> and<00:02:50.060> it<00:02:50.450> blends<00:02:50.720> right<00:02:51.470> in<00:02:51.769> and

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750 
it like that and it blends right in and

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.199 
it like that and it blends right in and
what<00:02:53.750> I<00:02:53.780> do<00:02:53.930> is<00:02:54.110> I<00:02:54.410> keep<00:02:54.650> getting<00:02:54.820> the<00:02:55.820> longer

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
what I do is I keep getting the longer

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:02.450 
what I do is I keep getting the longer
pieces<00:02:56.800> because<00:02:57.800> I<00:02:57.950> can<00:02:58.160> tell<00:02:58.430> which<00:02:58.700> ones

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:02.460 

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:04.610 

and<00:03:03.090> also<00:03:03.270> sometimes<00:03:03.870> when<00:03:04.050> I<00:03:04.080> could<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.560> turn

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
and also sometimes when I could I turn

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.040 
and also sometimes when I could I turn
it<00:03:05.160> around<00:03:05.310> in<00:03:05.790> a<00:03:05.880> different<00:03:06.270> direction<00:03:06.390> so<00:03:06.960> it

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.050 
it around in a different direction so it

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:13.580 
it around in a different direction so it
can<00:03:07.170> be<00:03:07.290> cut<00:03:07.560> in<00:03:08.420> different<00:03:09.420> ways<00:03:12.350> okay<00:03:13.350> the

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
can be cut in different ways okay the

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.280 
can be cut in different ways okay the
other<00:03:13.740> thing<00:03:14.420> that<00:03:15.420> I<00:03:15.570> wanted<00:03:15.930> to<00:03:16.050> show<00:03:16.260> you

believe flip my hair upside down and let

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.640 
believe flip my hair upside down and let
sit<00:03:37.120> around<00:03:37.330> i've<00:03:37.599> already<00:03:37.780> had<00:03:38.020> a<00:03:38.080> discovery

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
sit around i've already had a discovery

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.820 
sit around i've already had a discovery
of<00:03:38.709> what<00:03:39.040> i<00:03:39.069> did<00:03:39.489> with<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.940> one<00:03:43.590> all<00:03:44.590> right

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:44.830 
of what i did with that one all right

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:48.510 
of what i did with that one all right
and<00:03:45.160> it<00:03:46.090> gives<00:03:46.270> off<00:03:46.510> this<00:03:46.780> little<00:03:47.290> this<00:03:47.620> little

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:48.520 
and it gives off this little this little

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:52.830 
and it gives off this little this little
swoop<00:03:49.090> curl<00:03:49.739> that<00:03:50.739> goes<00:03:50.920> that<00:03:51.190> way<00:03:51.630> if<00:03:52.630> you're

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:52.840 
swoop curl that goes that way if you're

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.540 
swoop curl that goes that way if you're
not<00:03:52.930> satisfied<00:03:53.200> with<00:03:53.530> it<00:03:53.769> you<00:03:54.010> can<00:03:54.130> always<00:03:54.190> go

not satisfied with it you can always go

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.740 
not satisfied with it you can always go
over<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:55.000> again<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:56.790> what<00:03:57.790> you<00:03:58.000> do<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.150> you<00:03:58.630> do

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:21.949 
you want to get to the bottom to where

00:04:21.949 --> 00:04:26.710 
you want to get to the bottom to where
it<00:04:22.190> doesn't<00:04:22.430> even<00:04:24.280> it<00:04:25.280> looks<00:04:25.310> real<00:04:25.970> more

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:26.720 
it doesn't even it looks real more

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:29.260 
it doesn't even it looks real more
realistic<00:04:27.470> when<00:04:27.710> you<00:04:27.919> curl<00:04:28.460> the<00:04:28.610> bottoms<00:04:29.000> and

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
realistic when you curl the bottoms and

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:32.469 
realistic when you curl the bottoms and
it's<00:04:29.479> just<00:04:29.780> you<00:04:30.620> know<00:04:31.270> going<00:04:32.270> different

00:04:32.469 --> 00:04:32.479 
it's just you know going different

00:04:32.479 --> 00:04:36.999 
it's just you know going different
directions<00:04:34.630> you<00:04:35.630> can<00:04:35.750> also<00:04:35.930> curl<00:04:36.440> it<00:04:36.590> this<00:04:36.770> way

00:04:36.999 --> 00:04:37.009 
directions you can also curl it this way

00:04:37.009 --> 00:04:41.110 
directions you can also curl it this way
too<00:04:37.449> so<00:04:38.449> that<00:04:38.660> you<00:04:38.840> have<00:04:39.110> a<00:04:39.530> multi<00:04:40.250> effect<00:04:40.789> and

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
too so that you have a multi effect and

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.860 
too so that you have a multi effect and
also<00:04:41.840> when<00:04:42.650> I<00:04:42.979> did<00:04:43.220> my<00:04:43.460> hair<00:04:44.030> I<00:04:44.060> didn't<00:04:44.570> just

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
also when I did my hair I didn't just

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.370 
also when I did my hair I didn't just
layer<00:04:45.770> the<00:04:46.699> top<00:04:47.000> I<00:04:47.360> got<00:04:48.199> the<00:04:48.380> bottoms<00:04:48.830> and<00:04:49.220> I

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:50.380 
layer the top I got the bottoms and I

00:04:50.380 --> 00:04:56.890 
layer the top I got the bottoms and I
snipped<00:04:51.380> off<00:04:52.720> the<00:04:53.720> bottom<00:04:54.080> half<00:04:54.320> like<00:04:55.900> this

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:56.900 
snipped off the bottom half like this

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:02.140 
snipped off the bottom half like this
piece<00:04:57.229> I<00:04:57.560> would<00:04:58.190> snip<00:04:58.460> off<00:04:58.610> the<00:04:58.669> bottom<00:05:01.150> I've

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:02.150 
piece I would snip off the bottom I've

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:04.510 
piece I would snip off the bottom I've
already<00:05:02.389> done<00:05:02.750> that<00:05:02.780> so<00:05:03.680> that's<00:05:03.889> why<00:05:04.100> it<00:05:04.160> gives

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:04.520 
already done that so that's why it gives

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:09.909 
already done that so that's why it gives
off<00:05:04.729> the<00:05:05.180> natural<00:05:06.220> look<00:05:07.220> but<00:05:08.210> once<00:05:08.449> you<00:05:08.800> put<00:05:09.800> in

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
off the natural look but once you put in

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.909 
off the natural look but once you put in
a<00:05:10.039> weave<00:05:10.280> you<00:05:10.610> should<00:05:11.320> always<00:05:12.320> snip<00:05:12.770> the

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
a weave you should always snip the

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.850 
a weave you should always snip the
bottoms<00:05:13.280> to<00:05:14.000> where<00:05:14.180> it<00:05:14.389> lays<00:05:14.599> the<00:05:15.470> way<00:05:15.650> that

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:15.860 
bottoms to where it lays the way that

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:17.860 
bottoms to where it lays the way that
you<00:05:16.039> wanted<00:05:16.400> to<00:05:16.639> wear<00:05:16.849> it<00:05:16.880> looks<00:05:17.330> more<00:05:17.630> natural

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:17.870 
you wanted to wear it looks more natural

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:23.760 
you wanted to wear it looks more natural
and<00:05:19.990> make<00:05:20.990> sure<00:05:21.020> at<00:05:21.530> night<00:05:21.770> if<00:05:22.760> you<00:05:23.060> want<00:05:23.300> that
