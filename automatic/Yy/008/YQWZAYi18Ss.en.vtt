00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
and then they have full Menem problem

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.770 
and then they have full Menem problem
with<00:00:35.700> them<00:00:35.850> is<00:00:36.000> they<00:00:36.239> leave<00:00:36.390> a<00:00:36.450> lot<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.660> room

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
you're not in a moving vehicle they work

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.040 
you're not in a moving vehicle they work
great<00:00:44.280> here<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:45.329> wanted<00:00:45.690> something<00:00:45.870> that<00:00:45.960> had

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:46.050 
great here I wanted something that had

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.690 
great here I wanted something that had
some<00:00:46.320> velcro<00:00:46.500> to<00:00:46.800> hold<00:00:46.829> them<00:00:47.070> in<00:00:47.160> place<00:00:47.190> as

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
some velcro to hold them in place as

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.010 
some velcro to hold them in place as
these<00:00:48.180> do<00:00:48.360> they<00:00:48.539> go<00:00:48.629> all<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.840> way<00:00:48.870> around

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
these do they go all the way around

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.680 
these do they go all the way around
because<00:00:49.890> your<00:00:50.250> waves<00:00:50.610> trailering<00:00:51.239> all<00:00:51.510> that

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
because your waves trailering all that

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.959 
because your waves trailering all that
they<00:00:51.899> are<00:00:51.960> moving<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:52.500> so<00:00:52.910> there<00:00:53.910> will

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
they are moving a lot so there will

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.160 
they are moving a lot so there will
probably<00:00:54.059> be<00:00:54.300> a<00:00:54.329> follow-up<00:00:54.690> review<00:00:54.870> on<00:00:55.050> these

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
probably be a follow-up review on these

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.299 
probably be a follow-up review on these
but<00:00:55.320> this<00:00:55.379> is<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.620> going<00:00:55.710> to<00:00:55.770> be<00:00:55.890> an<00:00:55.980> install

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
but this is just going to be an install

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.810 
but this is just going to be an install
video<00:00:56.610> so<00:00:56.930> let's<00:00:57.930> get<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.260> it

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
video so let's get to it

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.490 
video so let's get to it
looks<00:00:59.820> like<00:00:59.940> these<00:01:00.059> rod<00:01:00.270> holders<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.870> got<00:01:01.140> two

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
looks like these rod holders you got two

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:03.830 
looks like these rod holders you got two
units<00:01:01.969> get<00:01:02.969> these<00:01:03.149> are<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> little<00:01:03.449> washers

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
units get these are the little washers

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.170 
units get these are the little washers
that<00:01:04.019> slide<00:01:04.229> into<00:01:04.379> the<00:01:04.530> foam<00:01:04.739> here<00:01:05.090> then<00:01:06.090> you

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
that slide into the foam here then you

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.340 
that slide into the foam here then you
put<00:01:06.360> the<00:01:06.450> screw<00:01:06.689> through<00:01:06.930> that<00:01:07.110> way<00:01:07.200> you're

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
put the screw through that way you're

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:08.840 
put the screw through that way you're
not<00:01:07.380> the<00:01:07.950> screw<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.400> go<00:01:08.490> right<00:01:08.610> through<00:01:08.670> the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
not the screw just go right through the

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.550 
not the screw just go right through the
foam<00:01:09.000> otherwise<00:01:09.330> this<00:01:09.900> goes<00:01:10.080> into<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.350> hull

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
foam otherwise this goes into the hull

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.550 
foam otherwise this goes into the hull
on<00:01:10.799> this<00:01:10.950> boat<00:01:11.159> here<00:01:11.780> it's<00:01:12.780> got<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> false<00:01:13.320> wall

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
on this boat here it's got a false wall

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.060 
on this boat here it's got a false wall
here<00:01:14.150> forward<00:01:15.150> the<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:16.020> the<00:01:16.170> bracing<00:01:16.530> is<00:01:16.650> you

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
here forward the or the bracing is you

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.130 
here forward the or the bracing is you
need<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.250> be<00:01:17.369> careful<00:01:17.759> anytime<00:01:18.509> you<00:01:18.659> drill

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
need to be careful anytime you drill

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.480 
need to be careful anytime you drill
through<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.409> hole<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.890> need<00:01:20.040> to<00:01:20.130> make<00:01:20.250> sure<00:01:20.280> if

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
through a hole you need to make sure if

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:21.830 
through a hole you need to make sure if
it's<00:01:20.580> below<00:01:20.729> the<00:01:20.850> waterline<00:01:21.119> you<00:01:21.360> seal<00:01:21.570> it<00:01:21.750> if

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
it's below the waterline you seal it if

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.880 
it's below the waterline you seal it if
you're<00:01:21.960> not<00:01:21.990> going<00:01:22.320> through<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.590> hole<00:01:22.710> then

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
you're not going through the hole then

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.770 
you're not going through the hole then
you're<00:01:23.009> all<00:01:23.100> good<00:01:23.280> these<00:01:23.880> are<00:01:23.909> this<00:01:24.390> hardware

Theatre started and then if you kind of
wrestle<00:02:18.710> them<00:02:18.770> in<00:02:18.950> there<00:02:19.990> basically<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.080> can

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:21.260 
wrestle them in there basically you can

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:23.350 
wrestle them in there basically you can
keep<00:02:21.380> the<00:02:21.560> side<00:02:22.280> you<00:02:22.400> slid<00:02:22.640> it<00:02:22.760> from<00:02:22.940> the<00:02:23.210> mouth

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360 
keep the side you slid it from the mouth

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:24.580 
keep the side you slid it from the mouth
or<00:02:23.570> whatever<00:02:23.810> you<00:02:23.930> can<00:02:24.050> keep<00:02:24.170> that<00:02:24.320> open

or whatever you can keep that open
they'll<00:02:24.710> slide<00:02:24.950> right<00:02:25.130> in<00:02:25.310> and<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:26.150> just<00:02:26.210> got

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
they'll slide right in and you just got

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.850 
they'll slide right in and you just got
to<00:02:26.510> kind<00:02:26.570> of<00:02:26.690> pull<00:02:26.840> the<00:02:26.960> foam<00:02:27.140> around<00:02:27.290> where

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
to kind of pull the foam around where

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.600 
to kind of pull the foam around where
the<00:02:27.980> screw<00:02:28.190> will<00:02:28.310> come<00:02:28.490> through<00:02:30.400> so<00:02:31.400> all<00:02:31.520> the

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:31.610 
the screw will come through so all the

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:32.950 
the screw will come through so all the
clips<00:02:31.850> are<00:02:32.000> in<00:02:32.090> there<00:02:32.210> on<00:02:32.330> one<00:02:32.480> of<00:02:32.510> them<00:02:32.690> get

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:32.960 
clips are in there on one of them get

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.810 
clips are in there on one of them get
some<00:02:33.080> other<00:02:33.200> one<00:02:33.350> installed<00:02:33.680> make<00:02:34.490> sure<00:02:34.550> the

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:34.820 
some other one installed make sure the

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
some other one installed make sure the
straps<00:02:35.120> behind<00:02:35.510> it

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
straps behind it

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.620 
straps behind it
when<00:02:36.470> I<00:02:36.500> probably<00:02:37.040> measure<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.730> mark<00:02:38.240> so<00:02:38.480> it's

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:38.630 
when I probably measure and mark so it's

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.990 
when I probably measure and mark so it's

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.360 
kind of feel it nice and slow
once<00:05:03.880> it<00:05:04.030> starts<00:05:04.360> and<00:05:04.510> I<00:05:04.570> stop<00:05:04.870> and<00:05:05.290> I<00:05:06.100> think<00:05:06.310> go

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
once it starts and I stop and I think go

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:07.380 
once it starts and I stop and I think go
all<00:05:06.490> the<00:05:06.580> way<00:05:06.610> take<00:05:06.880> it<00:05:07.030> cuz<00:05:07.150> I'm<00:05:07.210> going<00:05:07.300> to

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
all the way take it cuz I'm going to

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:09.270 
all the way take it cuz I'm going to
drill<00:05:07.540> the<00:05:07.630> other<00:05:07.750> ones<00:05:07.960> but<00:05:08.950> then<00:05:09.100> what<00:05:09.190> I've

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.280 
drill the other ones but then what I've

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:12.630 
drill the other ones but then what I've
been<00:05:09.400> doing<00:05:09.610> is<00:05:09.700> set<00:05:09.880> in<00:05:09.970> this<00:05:10.030> clutch<00:05:11.400> to<00:05:12.400> just

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:12.640 
been doing is set in this clutch to just

00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:16.440 
been doing is set in this clutch to just
past<00:05:13.740> not<00:05:14.740> being<00:05:14.980> able<00:05:15.040> to<00:05:15.190> slip<00:05:15.460> letting<00:05:16.360> it

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:16.450 
past not being able to slip letting it

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.820 
past not being able to slip letting it
slip<00:05:16.660> but<00:05:16.840> it's<00:05:17.140> takes<00:05:17.680> quite<00:05:17.919> a<00:05:17.950> bit<00:05:18.390> but

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:19.830 
slip but it's takes quite a bit but

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:21.780 
slip but it's takes quite a bit but
probably<00:05:20.830> want<00:05:20.950> to<00:05:21.010> do<00:05:21.070> these<00:05:21.190> by<00:05:21.370> hand<00:05:21.669> is

00:05:21.780 --> 00:05:21.790 
probably want to do these by hand is

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:23.010 
probably want to do these by hand is
probably<00:05:22.030> the<00:05:22.120> safest<00:05:22.300> that<00:05:22.570> way<00:05:22.660> don't<00:05:22.750> strip

00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:23.020 
probably the safest that way don't strip

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:24.270 
probably the safest that way don't strip
it<00:05:23.140> through<00:05:23.290> the<00:05:23.380> aluminum<00:05:23.590> I<00:05:23.919> mean<00:05:24.100> you<00:05:24.160> could

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:24.280 
it through the aluminum I mean you could

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.590 
it through the aluminum I mean you could
always<00:05:24.340> up<00:05:24.580> sighs<00:05:24.760> screws<00:05:25.120> if<00:05:25.240> you<00:05:25.300> do<00:05:25.419> that

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:25.600 
always up sighs screws if you do that

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.320 
always up sighs screws if you do that
but<00:05:25.810> can<00:05:26.260> only<00:05:26.290> go<00:05:26.500> so<00:05:26.530> far<00:05:26.860> there<00:05:27.070> I<00:05:27.250> drill<00:05:28.240> the

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:28.330 
but can only go so far there I drill the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:29.460 
but can only go so far there I drill the
other<00:05:28.450> ones<00:05:28.600> right<00:05:28.780> through<00:05:28.930> the<00:05:28.990> fabric<00:05:29.140> I

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
other ones right through the fabric I

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:32.340 
other ones right through the fabric I
hold<00:05:29.620> a<00:05:29.680> nice<00:05:29.830> and<00:05:30.040> taut<00:05:30.220> and<00:05:30.990> make<00:05:31.990> sure<00:05:32.140> I<00:05:32.169> got

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:32.350 
hold a nice and taut and make sure I got

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:34.140 
hold a nice and taut and make sure I got
this<00:05:32.530> lined<00:05:32.800> up<00:05:32.950> the<00:05:33.100> strap<00:05:33.430> and<00:05:33.669> the<00:05:33.760> foam

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:34.150 
this lined up the strap and the foam

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.350 
this lined up the strap and the foam
lined<00:05:34.390> up<00:05:34.540> drill<00:05:34.780> down<00:05:35.910> there's<00:05:36.910> a<00:05:37.000> finished

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:37.360 
lined up drill down there's a finished

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.980 
lined up drill down there's a finished
one<00:05:37.510> and<00:05:39.240> we'll<00:05:40.240> get<00:05:40.330> the<00:05:40.450> other<00:05:40.479> one<00:05:40.690> mounted

00:05:40.980 --> 00:05:40.990 
one and we'll get the other one mounted

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.870 
one and we'll get the other one mounted
here<00:05:41.140> throw<00:05:42.130> some<00:05:42.160> rods<00:05:42.460> in<00:05:42.610> it<00:05:42.700> and<00:05:42.790> show<00:05:42.850> you

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:42.880 
here throw some rods in it and show you

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.450 
here throw some rods in it and show you
what<00:05:43.060> it<00:05:43.120> looks<00:05:43.270> like<00:05:43.390> complete

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:45.460 
what it looks like complete

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:47.400 
what it looks like complete
so<00:05:46.030> now<00:05:46.150> we've<00:05:46.300> got<00:05:46.420> the<00:05:46.600> rods<00:05:46.780> and<00:05:47.020> a<00:05:47.050> couple

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:47.410 
so now we've got the rods and a couple

00:05:47.410 --> 00:05:48.540 
so now we've got the rods and a couple
of<00:05:47.560> rods<00:05:47.710> sitting<00:05:48.010> in<00:05:48.070> the<00:05:48.130> holders<00:05:48.400> the

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:48.550 
of rods sitting in the holders the

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:50.250 
of rods sitting in the holders the
holders<00:05:48.820> are<00:05:48.940> installed<00:05:49.330> these<00:05:49.900> are<00:05:50.080> five

00:05:50.250 --> 00:05:50.260 
holders are installed these are five

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.080 
holders are installed these are five
feet<00:05:50.440> apart<00:05:53.130> it<00:05:54.130> says<00:05:54.310> you<00:05:54.430> can<00:05:54.550> fit<00:05:54.700> 8<00:05:54.850> rods

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
feet apart it says you can fit 8 rods

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.710 
feet apart it says you can fit 8 rods
I'm<00:05:55.300> sure<00:05:55.510> you<00:05:55.630> can<00:05:56.880> opposite<00:05:57.880> ends<00:05:58.150> flip<00:05:58.420> them

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
I'm sure you can opposite ends flip them

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.330 
I'm sure you can opposite ends flip them
if<00:05:58.810> I<00:05:59.260> were<00:05:59.410> to<00:05:59.500> go<00:05:59.590> with<00:05:59.770> 8<00:05:59.890> I<00:05:59.920> think<00:06:00.070> I

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:00.340 
if I were to go with 8 I think I

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:01.530 
if I were to go with 8 I think I
probably<00:06:00.460> put<00:06:00.730> 4<00:06:00.940> in<00:06:01.060> there<00:06:01.180> I<00:06:01.210> don't<00:06:01.360> know<00:06:01.480> if

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:01.540 
probably put 4 in there I don't know if

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:02.670 
probably put 4 in there I don't know if
I<00:06:01.690> were<00:06:01.810> to<00:06:01.900> go<00:06:01.960> with<00:06:02.080> 8<00:06:02.200> I'd<00:06:02.320> probably<00:06:02.470> just

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:02.680 
I were to go with 8 I'd probably just

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:04.050 
I were to go with 8 I'd probably just
