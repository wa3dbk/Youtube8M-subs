alone<00:02:20.520> in<00:02:20.760> stores<00:02:21.180> and<00:02:21.450> so<00:02:21.630> this<00:02:21.750> might<00:02:21.930> not

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
alone in stores and so this might not

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.860 
alone in stores and so this might not
drip<00:02:22.620> in<00:02:22.920> very<00:02:23.430> easily<00:02:23.730> we<00:02:24.150> have<00:02:24.330> to<00:02:24.480> push<00:02:24.690> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
drip in very easily we have to push it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.710 
drip in very easily we have to push it
out<00:02:25.019> and<00:02:25.290> it<00:02:26.010> kind<00:02:26.220> of<00:02:26.250> sticks<00:02:26.519> together<00:02:26.790> all

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
out and it kind of sticks together all

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.990 
out and it kind of sticks together all
right<00:02:27.810> come<00:02:28.110> on<00:02:28.140> dip<00:02:29.100> inside<00:02:29.340> then<00:02:29.700> we<00:02:29.730> just

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
right come on dip inside then we just

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.620 
right come on dip inside then we just
push<00:02:30.209> a<00:02:30.239> little<00:02:30.420> bit<00:02:30.750> more<00:02:30.989> in<00:02:32.180> down<00:02:33.180> there<00:02:33.480> we

00:02:41.449 --> 00:02:41.459 
simple to put back it does snap into

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:43.100 
simple to put back it does snap into
place<00:02:41.700> that<00:02:42.030> little<00:02:42.300> gray<00:02:42.569> piece<00:02:42.810> right<00:02:43.050> there

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:46.260 
it'll snap on top and then we just have

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:48.080 
it'll snap on top and then we just have
to<00:02:46.440> push<00:02:46.709> this<00:02:46.920> little<00:02:47.160> plunger<00:02:47.640> down<00:02:47.880> which

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

is really simple and we're going to see

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:52.190 
is really simple and we're going to see
at<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.130> bottom<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.819> the<00:02:50.880> ooze<00:02:51.239> comes<00:02:51.930> out

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:52.200 
at the bottom that the ooze comes out

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.530 
at the bottom that the ooze comes out
into<00:02:52.470> the<00:02:52.769> scoop<00:02:53.130> now<00:02:53.519> with<00:02:53.700> the<00:02:53.850> O's<00:02:54.090> loaded

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
into the scoop now with the O's loaded

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.420 
into the scoop now with the O's loaded
into<00:02:54.720> the<00:02:54.810> scoop<00:02:55.140> we<00:02:55.350> just<00:02:55.590> have<00:02:55.769> to<00:02:55.920> catapult

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
into the scoop we just have to catapult

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.850 
into the scoop we just have to catapult
it<00:02:56.670> so<00:02:56.850> we<00:02:56.940> take<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.329> top<00:02:57.570> right<00:02:57.780> there<00:02:57.989> and<00:02:58.320> we

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
it so we take the top right there and we

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.250 
it so we take the top right there and we
flick<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.310> as<00:02:59.549> hard<00:02:59.850> as<00:03:00.030> we<00:03:00.090> can<00:03:00.450> and<00:03:00.720> finally

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:24.350 
let's launch some oops now again we just

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.680 
let's launch some oops now again we just
press<00:04:24.650> the<00:04:24.830> little<00:04:25.010> plunger<00:04:25.490> and<00:04:25.669> out<00:04:26.300> comes

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:29.900 
the use and this time we put a lot of

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:31.870 
the use and this time we put a lot of
oohs<00:04:30.169> in<00:04:30.470> the<00:04:30.620> launcher<00:04:31.040> here<00:04:31.250> so<00:04:31.520> let's<00:04:31.729> see

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:31.880 
oohs in the launcher here so let's see

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:35.140 
oohs in the launcher here so let's see
if<00:04:31.940> this<00:04:32.090> works<00:04:32.390> out<00:04:32.630> better<00:04:32.870> no<00:04:34.150> they

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
if this works out better no they

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.670 
if this works out better no they
actually<00:04:35.360> didn't<00:04:35.870> even<00:04:35.960> come<00:04:36.229> out<00:04:36.380> it<00:04:36.500> just

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
actually didn't even come out it just

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.320 
actually didn't even come out it just
sort<00:04:36.830> of<00:04:36.890> fell<00:04:37.130> let's<00:04:37.700> try<00:04:37.850> it<00:04:37.910> one<00:04:38.030> more<00:04:38.060> time

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:38.330 
sort of fell let's try it one more time

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:40.240 
sort of fell let's try it one more time
now<00:04:38.660> but<00:04:39.260> looks<00:04:39.410> like<00:04:39.470> it's<00:04:39.680> sticking<00:04:40.010> a

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:40.250 
now but looks like it's sticking a

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:41.890 
now but looks like it's sticking a
little<00:04:40.370> too<00:04:40.610> much<00:04:40.850> well<00:04:41.390> let's<00:04:41.540> see<00:04:41.720> if<00:04:41.810> the

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
little too much well let's see if the

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.600 
little too much well let's see if the
little<00:04:42.050> loose<00:04:42.290> piece<00:04:42.560> works<00:04:42.800> out<00:04:43.010> better<00:04:43.190> Leo

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:43.610 
little loose piece works out better Leo

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.670 
little loose piece works out better Leo
again<00:04:44.000> has<00:04:44.240> a<00:04:44.479> blue<00:04:44.870> one<00:04:45.110> so<00:04:45.140> we're<00:04:45.380> gonna<00:04:45.470> put

00:04:45.670 --> 00:04:45.680 
again has a blue one so we're gonna put

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.050 
again has a blue one so we're gonna put
it<00:04:45.710> in<00:04:45.890> the<00:04:45.979> launcher<00:04:46.430> let's<00:04:46.640> watch<00:04:46.850> it

00:04:47.050 --> 00:04:47.060 
it in the launcher let's watch it

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.370 
it in the launcher let's watch it
lightly<00:04:47.300> so<00:04:47.630> it<00:04:47.720> doesn't<00:04:47.960> fly<00:04:48.080> across<00:04:48.260> the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
lightly so it doesn't fly across the

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:51.040 
lightly so it doesn't fly across the
room<00:04:48.560> where<00:04:49.490> did<00:04:49.580> it<00:04:49.640> go<00:04:49.850> oh<00:04:50.090> it's<00:04:50.540> right<00:04:50.840> next

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.050 
room where did it go oh it's right next

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.820 
room where did it go oh it's right next
to<00:04:51.200> my<00:04:51.350> hand

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
to my hand

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.040 
to my hand
and<00:04:53.669> the<00:04:53.789> next<00:04:53.970> step<00:04:54.150> of<00:04:54.300> the<00:04:54.419> checkout<00:04:54.810> is

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050
