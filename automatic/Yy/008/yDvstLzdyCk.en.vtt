is bisque from trying their powder
foundation<00:00:11.280> before<00:00:11.429> that's<00:00:11.880> kind<00:00:12.150> of<00:00:12.179> the

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
foundation before that's kind of the

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.870 
foundation before that's kind of the
color<00:00:12.570> that<00:00:12.929> i<00:00:13.110> felt<00:00:13.469> worked<00:00:13.860> best<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.519> and

color that i felt worked best for me and

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.019 
color that i felt worked best for me and
I<00:00:15.450> think<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.170> works<00:00:16.350> great<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:17.070> this<00:00:17.279> liquid

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
I think it works great in this liquid

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.349 
I think it works great in this liquid
version<00:00:18.390> as<00:00:18.539> well<00:00:18.570> it<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.859> neutral<00:00:20.850> to

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
version as well it is neutral to

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.920 
version as well it is neutral to
slightly<00:00:21.990> yellow<00:00:22.980> toned<00:00:23.369> which<00:00:24.180> is<00:00:24.390> perfect

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
slightly yellow toned which is perfect

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.800 
slightly yellow toned which is perfect
for<00:00:25.170> me<00:00:25.320> and<00:00:25.560> as<00:00:26.519> you<00:00:26.550> can<00:00:26.849> see<00:00:26.910> it's<00:00:27.359> got<00:00:27.570> kind

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
for me and as you can see it's got kind

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.160 
for me and as you can see it's got kind
of<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.289> aloe<00:00:28.590> gel<00:00:29.369> with<00:00:30.330> little<00:00:30.840> beads

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
of a aloe gel with little beads

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
of a aloe gel with little beads
suspended<00:00:32.070> in<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.640> bees<00:00:32.850> have

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
suspended in it and the bees have

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.870 
suspended in it and the bees have
pigment<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.870> when<00:00:34.410> you<00:00:34.530> pump<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.670> to

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
pigment and when you pump you have to

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.780 
pigment and when you pump you have to
pump<00:00:36.120> this<00:00:36.360> a<00:00:36.390> few<00:00:36.719> times<00:00:36.750> first<00:00:37.500> as<00:00:37.920> you<00:00:38.640> can

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
pump this a few times first as you can

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.150 
pump this a few times first as you can
see<00:00:39.030> it<00:00:39.300> rises<00:00:39.989> the<00:00:40.170> more<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.530> use<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.739> so

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
see it rises the more you use it so

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.580 
see it rises the more you use it so
mine's<00:00:41.370> already<00:00:41.700> up<00:00:41.969> to<00:00:42.120> here<00:00:42.480> because<00:00:42.660> you

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
mine's already up to here because you

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.190 
mine's already up to here because you
kind<00:00:43.800> of<00:00:43.829> waste<00:00:44.340> some<00:00:45.329> products<00:00:45.870> when<00:00:46.079> you

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
kind of waste some products when you

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.779 
kind of waste some products when you
have<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.500> pump<00:00:46.680> it<00:00:46.829> a<00:00:46.890> few<00:00:47.100> times<00:00:47.280> and<00:00:47.640> it's

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
have to pump it a few times and it's

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:51.110 
have to pump it a few times and it's
only<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.180> clear<00:00:48.420> gel<00:00:48.809> coming<00:00:49.200> out<00:00:49.350> but<00:00:50.160> after

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
only the clear gel coming out but after

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.139 
only the clear gel coming out but after
that<00:00:51.510> this<00:00:52.170> is<00:00:52.379> what<00:00:52.559> it<00:00:52.649> looks<00:00:52.890> like<00:00:53.160> once<00:00:54.000> you

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
that this is what it looks like once you

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:57.709 
that this is what it looks like once you
get<00:00:54.300> all<00:00:54.449> that<00:00:54.600> clear<00:00:54.960> gel<00:00:55.289> out<00:00:55.500> and<00:00:56.600> let<00:00:57.600> me

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
get all that clear gel out and let me

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:00.260 
get all that clear gel out and let me
actually<00:00:58.079> put<00:00:58.289> it<00:00:58.489> here<00:00:59.489> I<00:00:59.520> have<00:00:59.850> a<00:00:59.879> swatch<00:01:00.239> of

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
actually put it here I have a swatch of

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.170 
actually put it here I have a swatch of
a<00:01:00.510> concealer<00:01:00.989> here<00:01:01.260> but<00:01:01.760> here's<00:01:02.760> what<00:01:03.059> it

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
a concealer here but here's what it

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.080 
a concealer here but here's what it
looks<00:01:03.420> like<00:01:03.710> so<00:01:04.710> as<00:01:05.040> you<00:01:05.220> can<00:01:05.339> see<00:01:05.610> it's<00:01:05.790> pretty

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
looks like so as you can see it's pretty

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.539 
looks like so as you can see it's pretty
blotchy<00:01:06.659> because<00:01:07.350> it's<00:01:07.500> got<00:01:07.680> those<00:01:07.890> pigments

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
blotchy because it's got those pigments

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.530 
blotchy because it's got those pigments
and<00:01:09.140> they<00:01:10.140> are<00:01:10.350> like<00:01:10.619> I<00:01:11.119> don't<00:01:12.119> know<00:01:12.330> when

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
and they are like I don't know when

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.270 
and they are like I don't know when
they're<00:01:12.689> coating<00:01:13.200> or<00:01:13.409> something<00:01:13.799> so<00:01:14.010> you<00:01:14.070> have

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
they're coating or something so you have

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.260 
they're coating or something so you have
to<00:01:14.490> blend<00:01:14.850> blend<00:01:15.450> blend<00:01:15.810> blend<00:01:16.259> and<00:01:16.830> then<00:01:17.549> it

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
to blend blend blend blend and then it

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.260 
to blend blend blend blend and then it
dissolves<00:01:19.080> and<00:01:19.369> they're<00:01:20.369> able<00:01:20.580> to<00:01:20.759> blend<00:01:21.090> it

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
dissolves and they're able to blend it

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:23.420 
dissolves and they're able to blend it
all<00:01:21.360> together<00:01:21.570> so<00:01:22.080> that's<00:01:22.500> kind<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:22.920> the<00:01:23.100> one

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
all together so that's kind of the one

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.510 
all together so that's kind of the one
thing<00:01:23.729> that<00:01:24.590> was<00:01:25.590> kind<00:01:25.740> of<00:01:25.830> weird<00:01:26.070> for<00:01:26.400> me

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
thing that was kind of weird for me

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.510 
thing that was kind of weird for me
first<00:01:26.970> the<00:01:27.299> fact<00:01:27.659> that<00:01:27.869> it<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.350> so<00:01:28.979> like

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520 
first the fact that it is so like

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.569 
first the fact that it is so like
separated<00:01:30.450> but<00:01:31.229> it's<00:01:31.650> not<00:01:31.829> really<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.130> huge

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
separated but it's not really a huge

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.569 
separated but it's not really a huge
problem<00:01:33.229> I'm<00:01:34.229> going<00:01:34.409> to<00:01:34.470> show<00:01:34.740> you<00:01:34.770> how<00:01:35.549> I

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
problem I'm going to show you how I

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:38.719 
problem I'm going to show you how I
applied<00:01:36.150> to<00:01:36.420> my<00:01:36.540> face<00:01:36.810> so<00:01:37.110> I<00:01:37.380> do<00:01:37.680> three<00:01:38.189> pumps

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
applied to my face so I do three pumps

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.539 
applied to my face so I do three pumps
of<00:01:38.880> this<00:01:39.240> foundation<00:01:39.509> and<00:01:40.259> that's<00:01:41.189> a<00:01:41.340> little

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
of this foundation and that's a little

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:44.600 
of this foundation and that's a little
bit<00:01:41.700> too<00:01:42.119> much<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.780> can<00:01:43.409> probably<00:01:43.649> do<00:01:43.890> one<00:01:44.189> or

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:44.610 
bit too much you can probably do one or

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.240 
bit too much you can probably do one or
two<00:01:44.640> but<00:01:45.600> the<00:01:45.810> reason<00:01:46.110> I<00:01:46.200> like<00:01:46.350> to<00:01:46.380> do<00:01:46.619> three<00:01:46.890> is

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:47.250 
two but the reason I like to do three is

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.469 
two but the reason I like to do three is
because<00:01:47.729> I<00:01:47.759> want<00:01:48.060> a<00:01:48.149> little<00:01:48.299> bit<00:01:48.420> extra

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
because I want a little bit extra

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.469 
because I want a little bit extra
coverage<00:01:48.810> out<00:01:49.470> of<00:01:49.619> this<00:01:49.740> foundation<00:01:49.950> so<00:01:50.729> it's

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
coverage out of this foundation so it's

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:53.270 
coverage out of this foundation so it's
a<00:01:51.720> lot<00:01:51.899> more<00:01:52.140> Foundation<00:01:52.829> and<00:01:52.920> I<00:01:52.950> just<00:01:53.070> have<00:01:53.159> to

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
a lot more Foundation and I just have to

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.429 
a lot more Foundation and I just have to
blend<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:53.880> blend<00:01:54.000> and<00:01:54.420> blend<00:01:54.540> until<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.290> all

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
blend and blend and blend until it all

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.219 
blend and blend and blend until it all
starts<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.070> kind<00:01:56.219> of<00:01:56.340> sink<00:01:56.610> into<00:01:56.820> my<00:01:57.090> skin<00:01:57.509> but

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
starts to kind of sink into my skin but

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.469 
starts to kind of sink into my skin but
I<00:01:58.500> do<00:01:58.560> get<00:01:58.799> more<00:01:59.070> coverage<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.820> could<00:02:00.119> just<00:02:00.329> do

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
I do get more coverage you could just do

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.480 
I do get more coverage you could just do
layers<00:02:00.810> for<00:02:01.439> some<00:02:01.590> reason<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.009> found<00:02:02.219> that<00:02:02.310> for

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:02.490 
layers for some reason I found that for

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.940 
layers for some reason I found that for
me<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.210> works<00:02:03.450> best<00:02:03.750> if<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.079> just<00:02:04.110> apply<00:02:04.380> a<00:02:04.590> ton

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
me it works best if I just apply a ton

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.580 
me it works best if I just apply a ton
at<00:02:05.100> first<00:02:05.340> verses<00:02:05.939> and<00:02:06.180> layers<00:02:06.409> but<00:02:07.409> that's

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
at first verses and layers but that's

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.080 
at first verses and layers but that's
something<00:02:07.950> you<00:02:08.190> know<00:02:08.310> else<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.940> can

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
something you know else that you can

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.639 
something you know else that you can
definitely<00:02:09.270> do

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
definitely do

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.399 
definitely do
I<00:02:10.709> think<00:02:11.099> that<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> looks<00:02:11.670> really<00:02:12.200> natural<00:02:13.200> on

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:13.409 
I think that it looks really natural on

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:16.130 
I think that it looks really natural on
my<00:02:13.590> skin<00:02:14.099> while<00:02:14.849> giving<00:02:15.390> me<00:02:15.569> some<00:02:15.840> pretty

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
my skin while giving me some pretty

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.339 
my skin while giving me some pretty
decent<00:02:16.470> coverage<00:02:16.950> I<00:02:17.459> would<00:02:18.090> say<00:02:18.420> that<00:02:18.930> it's

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
decent coverage I would say that it's

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.649 
decent coverage I would say that it's
about<00:02:19.470> medium<00:02:20.280> coverage<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:20.970> way<00:02:21.090> I<00:02:21.120> build<00:02:21.480> it

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
about medium coverage the way I build it

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.300 
about medium coverage the way I build it
up<00:02:21.750> you<00:02:21.989> can<00:02:22.140> build<00:02:22.319> it<00:02:22.470> up<00:02:22.530> to<00:02:22.590> about<00:02:22.950> medium

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:23.310 
up you can build it up to about medium

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.890 
up you can build it up to about medium
coverage<00:02:23.670> but<00:02:24.120> this<00:02:24.329> is<00:02:24.420> not<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.599> heavy

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
coverage but this is not a heavy

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:27.530 
coverage but this is not a heavy
coverage<00:02:25.379> product<00:02:26.040> it's<00:02:26.310> definitely<00:02:27.239> on<00:02:27.390> the

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
coverage product it's definitely on the

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.390 
coverage product it's definitely on the
lighter<00:02:27.780> side<00:02:27.930> if<00:02:28.379> you<00:02:28.500> just<00:02:28.650> do<00:02:28.859> one<00:02:28.890> pump

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:29.400 
lighter side if you just do one pump

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:30.949 
lighter side if you just do one pump
that's<00:02:29.790> going<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.030> give<00:02:30.209> you<00:02:30.329> kind<00:02:30.510> of<00:02:30.599> light

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
that's going to give you kind of light

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.860 
that's going to give you kind of light
coverage<00:02:31.530> but<00:02:32.099> what<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.670> really<00:02:33.209> love<00:02:33.569> about<00:02:33.689> it

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
coverage but what I really love about it

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.429 
coverage but what I really love about it
is<00:02:34.290> that<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:35.640> low<00:02:36.269> how<00:02:36.629> it's<00:02:36.840> kind<00:02:37.079> of<00:02:37.140> like<00:02:37.319> an

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
is that a low how it's kind of like an

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.089 
is that a low how it's kind of like an
aloe<00:02:37.680> based<00:02:38.420> product<00:02:39.420> so<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.019> not<00:02:40.200> oily<00:02:40.920> or

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
aloe based product so it's not oily or

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:44.930 
aloe based product so it's not oily or
greasy<00:02:41.189> at<00:02:42.060> all<00:02:42.090> it<00:02:43.010> kind<00:02:44.010> of<00:02:44.129> feels<00:02:44.459> just<00:02:44.879> like

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:44.940 
greasy at all it kind of feels just like

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.330 
greasy at all it kind of feels just like
aloe<00:02:45.269> like<00:02:46.019> if<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.319> ever<00:02:46.500> put<00:02:46.739> aloe<00:02:46.980> on<00:02:47.190> your

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
aloe like if you ever put aloe on your

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.789 
aloe like if you ever put aloe on your
face<00:02:47.579> it<00:02:47.849> just<00:02:48.060> kind<00:02:48.299> of<00:02:48.359> like<00:02:48.599> sinks<00:02:49.109> in<00:02:49.290> and

00:02:49.789 --> 00:02:49.799 
face it just kind of like sinks in and

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:53.149 
face it just kind of like sinks in and
this<00:02:50.670> is<00:02:50.879> fantastic<00:02:51.480> it's<00:02:52.049> really<00:02:52.159> hydrating

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
this is fantastic it's really hydrating

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.429 
this is fantastic it's really hydrating
but<00:02:53.909> it's<00:02:54.239> great<00:02:54.510> for<00:02:54.720> acne<00:02:54.900> prone<00:02:55.049> skin

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
but it's great for acne prone skin

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.580 
but it's great for acne prone skin

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
other thing that is kind of a negative

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:04.309 
other thing that is kind of a negative
about<00:03:01.950> this<00:03:02.189> is<00:03:02.370> I<00:03:02.519> noticed<00:03:03.030> I<00:03:03.450> don't<00:03:03.930> have

00:03:04.309 --> 00:03:04.319

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
like a huge problem with pore size but

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.460 
like a huge problem with pore size but
my<00:03:08.700> pores<00:03:09.000> definitely<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.870> be<00:03:09.900> visible

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
my pores definitely can be visible

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.379 
my pores definitely can be visible

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:12.389 
depending on makeup especially if I'm

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:15.199 
depending on makeup especially if I'm
wearing<00:03:12.659> like<00:03:12.870> a<00:03:12.900> really<00:03:13.290> glowy<00:03:13.680> or<00:03:14.209> shimmery

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:17.010 
blush and I bring it a little bit too

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:19.309 
blush and I bring it a little bit too
far<00:03:17.280> this<00:03:17.459> way<00:03:17.519> where<00:03:18.090> I've<00:03:18.209> got<00:03:18.449> bigger<00:03:18.840> pores

00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
far this way where I've got bigger pores

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.949 
far this way where I've got bigger pores
kind<00:03:19.769> of<00:03:19.859> right<00:03:20.040> here<00:03:20.510> they<00:03:21.510> will<00:03:21.660> become

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959 
kind of right here they will become

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.990 
kind of right here they will become
noticeable<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.680> what<00:03:22.919> I<00:03:22.949> noticed<00:03:23.400> happening

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:24.000 
noticeable so what I noticed happening

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.240 
noticeable so what I noticed happening
with<00:03:24.150> this<00:03:24.269> foundation<00:03:24.540> is<00:03:25.470> it<00:03:26.299> kind<00:03:27.299> of<00:03:27.449> like

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
with this foundation is it kind of like

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.490 
with this foundation is it kind of like
melts<00:03:29.250> into<00:03:29.459> your<00:03:30.090> course<00:03:30.959> a<00:03:31.230> little<00:03:31.379> bit

00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:31.500 
melts into your course a little bit

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.920 
melts into your course a little bit
sinks<00:03:32.099> into<00:03:32.310> your<00:03:32.609> pores<00:03:32.970> and<00:03:33.239> makes<00:03:33.599> them<00:03:33.840> a

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
sinks into your pores and makes them a

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.309 
sinks into your pores and makes them a
little<00:03:34.230> bit<00:03:34.349> more<00:03:34.620> visible<00:03:35.010> it's<00:03:35.909> not

00:03:36.309 --> 00:03:36.319 
little bit more visible it's not

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:38.750 
little bit more visible it's not
terribly<00:03:37.319> bad<00:03:37.680> I've<00:03:38.159> definitely<00:03:38.459> had

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
terribly bad I've definitely had

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.149 
terribly bad I've definitely had
products<00:03:39.269> that<00:03:39.720> are<00:03:39.900> worse<00:03:40.199> in<00:03:40.620> terms<00:03:40.889> of

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159 
products that are worse in terms of

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:44.210 
products that are worse in terms of
emphasizing<00:03:42.000> pores<00:03:42.329> but<00:03:43.199> this<00:03:43.739> definitely

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
emphasizing pores but this definitely

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.180 
emphasizing pores but this definitely
does<00:03:44.519> do<00:03:44.879> it<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.120> little<00:03:45.389> bit<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.650> that's

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
does do it a little bit so if that's

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.770 
does do it a little bit so if that's
something<00:03:47.400> that<00:03:47.729> you're<00:03:48.060> concerned<00:03:48.269> about

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
something that you're concerned about

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.170 
something that you're concerned about
maybe<00:03:49.739> you're<00:03:49.889> trying<00:03:50.099> to<00:03:50.250> hide<00:03:50.519> the<00:03:50.729> size<00:03:50.970> of

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
maybe you're trying to hide the size of

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:53.390 
maybe you're trying to hide the size of
your<00:03:51.299> pores<00:03:51.629> this<00:03:52.379> may<00:03:52.620> not<00:03:52.889> be<00:03:52.949> the<00:03:53.159> right

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
your pores this may not be the right

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.689 
your pores this may not be the right

00:03:56.689 --> 00:03:56.699 
product for you what I find works best

00:03:56.699 --> 00:04:00.050 
product for you what I find works best
for<00:03:56.849> me<00:03:57.060> is<00:03:57.540> I<00:03:58.500> like<00:03:58.859> to<00:03:59.099> use<00:03:59.430> setting<00:03:59.849> powder

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
for me is I like to use setting powder

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.930 
for me is I like to use setting powder
on<00:04:00.269> top<00:04:00.739> also<00:04:01.739> maybe<00:04:02.159> using<00:04:02.400> a<00:04:02.609> primer

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
on top also maybe using a primer

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.969 
on top also maybe using a primer
underneath<00:04:03.389> would<00:04:03.870> help<00:04:04.109> minimize<00:04:04.590> that<00:04:04.829> as

00:04:04.969 --> 00:04:04.979 
underneath would help minimize that as

00:04:04.979 --> 00:04:06.830 
underneath would help minimize that as
well<00:04:05.190> but<00:04:05.459> a<00:04:05.519> setting<00:04:05.879> powder<00:04:05.909> kind<00:04:06.449> of<00:04:06.540> helps

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:06.840 
well but a setting powder kind of helps

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.460 
well but a setting powder kind of helps
blur<00:04:07.409> it<00:04:07.680> even<00:04:08.159> more<00:04:08.430> so<00:04:08.790> it<00:04:09.120> kind<00:04:09.780> of<00:04:09.900> um<00:04:10.139> you

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
blur it even more so it kind of um you

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.059 
blur it even more so it kind of um you
know<00:04:10.680> counteracts<00:04:11.489> that<00:04:11.760> what<00:04:12.659> this<00:04:12.840> does<00:04:13.139> but

00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
know counteracts that what this does but

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:16.610 
know counteracts that what this does but
other<00:04:14.519> than<00:04:14.790> that<00:04:14.849> this<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:15.659> a<00:04:15.840> wonderful

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:16.620 
other than that this is a wonderful

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:19.279 
other than that this is a wonderful
foundation<00:04:16.799> so<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.849> just<00:04:18.000> has<00:04:18.180> you<00:04:18.900> know<00:04:18.989> that

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:19.289 
foundation so it just has you know that

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:21.440 
foundation so it just has you know that
flaw<00:04:19.620> and<00:04:19.919> then<00:04:20.099> the<00:04:20.279> fact<00:04:20.880> that<00:04:20.969> you<00:04:21.090> have<00:04:21.239> to

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:21.450 
flaw and then the fact that you have to

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:22.970 
flaw and then the fact that you have to
really<00:04:21.690> blend<00:04:22.049> it<00:04:22.289> the<00:04:22.409> fact<00:04:22.620> that<00:04:22.710> it's

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:22.980 
really blend it the fact that it's

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:24.500 
really blend it the fact that it's
kind<00:04:23.070> of<00:04:23.100> chunky<00:04:23.610> when<00:04:23.760> you<00:04:23.880> pump<00:04:24.090> it<00:04:24.210> out<00:04:24.360> of

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
kind of chunky when you pump it out of

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:27.890 
kind of chunky when you pump it out of
here<00:04:24.750> and<00:04:25.170> of<00:04:25.680> course<00:04:25.880> the<00:04:26.880> price<00:04:27.180> too<00:04:27.600> that's

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
here and of course the price too that's

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.470 
here and of course the price too that's
another<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:29.340> know<00:04:29.430> potential<00:04:29.970> issue<00:04:30.180> with

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
another you know potential issue with

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.480 
another you know potential issue with
this<00:04:30.630> is<00:04:30.900> this<00:04:31.080> is<00:04:31.200> really<00:04:31.590> expensive<00:04:32.190> it's

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:32.490 
this is this is really expensive it's

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:35.690 
this is this is really expensive it's
like<00:04:32.780> $50<00:04:33.780> so<00:04:34.380> I<00:04:34.410> really<00:04:35.010> like<00:04:35.250> it<00:04:35.490> I'm

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700 
like $50 so I really like it I'm

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:37.520 
like $50 so I really like it I'm
definitely<00:04:36.150> going<00:04:36.240> to<00:04:36.300> use<00:04:36.360> it<00:04:36.750> up<00:04:36.900> in<00:04:37.110> terms

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:37.530 
definitely going to use it up in terms

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:40.340 
definitely going to use it up in terms
of<00:04:37.860> am<00:04:38.130> I<00:04:38.220> going<00:04:38.400> to<00:04:38.490> purchase<00:04:38.730> it<00:04:39.060> again<00:04:39.390> I

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.350 
of am I going to purchase it again I

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.530 
of am I going to purchase it again I
don't<00:04:40.560> know<00:04:40.710> we'll<00:04:40.920> see<00:04:40.950> maybe<00:04:41.430> I<00:04:41.790> actually<00:04:42.150> do

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:42.540 
don't know we'll see maybe I actually do

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:45.110 
don't know we'll see maybe I actually do
really<00:04:42.840> like<00:04:43.170> it<00:04:43.230> but<00:04:44.070> a<00:04:44.460> lot<00:04:44.700> of<00:04:44.730> the<00:04:44.940> other

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:45.120 
really like it but a lot of the other

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.520 
really like it but a lot of the other
foundations<00:04:45.900> that<00:04:46.110> I've<00:04:46.200> been<00:04:46.320> really

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:46.530 
foundations that I've been really

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.530 
foundations that I've been really
enjoying<00:04:46.710> recently<00:04:47.400> tend<00:04:47.670> to<00:04:47.790> be<00:04:47.940> kind<00:04:48.270> of<00:04:48.390> on

00:04:48.530 --> 00:04:48.540 
enjoying recently tend to be kind of on

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.570 
enjoying recently tend to be kind of on
the<00:04:48.630> more<00:04:48.810> expensive<00:04:48.900> side<00:04:49.410> so<00:04:50.010> we'll<00:04:50.370> see

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:50.580 
the more expensive side so we'll see

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.820 
the more expensive side so we'll see
we'll<00:04:50.850> see<00:04:50.880> where<00:04:51.270> I<00:04:51.300> am<00:04:51.570> by<00:04:52.170> the<00:04:52.230> time<00:04:52.530> that

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
we'll see where I am by the time that

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.740 
we'll see where I am by the time that
I'm<00:04:53.040> done<00:04:53.280> using<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.090> then<00:04:54.300> at<00:04:54.540> that

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:54.750 
I'm done using this and then at that

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.410 
I'm done using this and then at that
point<00:04:54.990> I<00:04:55.230> guess<00:04:55.440> I'll<00:04:55.850> make<00:04:56.850> the<00:04:57.030> decision

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:57.420 
point I guess I'll make the decision

00:04:57.420 --> 00:04:58.550 
point I guess I'll make the decision
whether<00:04:57.570> I'm<00:04:57.720> going<00:04:57.870> to<00:04:57.930> purchase<00:04:58.290> it<00:04:58.410> or<00:04:58.500> not

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
whether I'm going to purchase it or not

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.590 
whether I'm going to purchase it or not
but<00:04:59.040> overall<00:04:59.490> you<00:04:59.940> know<00:05:00.060> if<00:05:00.210> you<00:05:00.330> have<00:05:00.480> the

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600 
but overall you know if you have the

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.030 
but overall you know if you have the
money<00:05:00.780> I<00:05:01.080> think<00:05:01.140> that<00:05:01.440> this<00:05:01.560> is<00:05:01.740> definitely

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:02.040 
money I think that this is definitely

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.950 
money I think that this is definitely
worth<00:05:02.280> a<00:05:02.460> try<00:05:02.490> and<00:05:02.760> I<00:05:02.940> think<00:05:03.150> it's<00:05:03.300> fantastic

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:03.960 
worth a try and I think it's fantastic

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:07.010 
worth a try and I think it's fantastic
and<00:05:04.890> it's<00:05:05.340> good<00:05:05.520> for<00:05:05.730> dry<00:05:05.940> skin<00:05:06.360> too<00:05:06.630> because

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
and it's good for dry skin too because

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.860 
and it's good for dry skin too because
it<00:05:07.170> is<00:05:07.290> really<00:05:07.590> hydrating<00:05:08.030> so<00:05:09.030> I<00:05:09.420> just<00:05:09.720> I

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:09.870 
it is really hydrating so I just I

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:12.170 
it is really hydrating so I just I
really<00:05:10.050> enjoy<00:05:10.560> this<00:05:10.800> I<00:05:11.070> just<00:05:11.640> kind<00:05:11.850> of<00:05:11.910> wish

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:12.180

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
that they instead of having this cool

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.220 
that they instead of having this cool
look<00:05:14.700> which<00:05:15.090> I<00:05:15.210> mean<00:05:15.390> that's<00:05:15.570> neat<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.170> I'm

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
sure that attracts people and probably

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.940 
sure that attracts people and probably
attracted<00:05:18.450> me<00:05:18.900> because<00:05:18.930> I'm<00:05:19.380> all<00:05:19.530> about<00:05:19.740> you

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:19.950 
attracted me because I'm all about you

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.340 
attracted me because I'm all about you
know<00:05:20.040> funky<00:05:20.520> presentation<00:05:21.330> but<00:05:21.570> I<00:05:21.720> wish<00:05:22.140> they

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:22.350 
know funky presentation but I wish they

00:05:22.350 --> 00:05:25.190 
know funky presentation but I wish they
just<00:05:22.590> blended<00:05:23.220> this<00:05:23.400> together<00:05:23.910> so<00:05:24.660> that<00:05:25.080> it

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:25.200 
just blended this together so that it

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.630 
just blended this together so that it
wouldn't<00:05:25.350> come<00:05:25.560> out<00:05:25.680> chunky<00:05:26.220> you<00:05:26.370> and<00:05:26.550> you

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:26.640 
wouldn't come out chunky you and you

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:28.070 
wouldn't come out chunky you and you
wouldn't<00:05:26.880> have<00:05:26.970> to<00:05:27.090> work<00:05:27.300> as<00:05:27.450> much<00:05:27.600> to<00:05:27.840> blend

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
wouldn't have to work as much to blend

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.500 
wouldn't have to work as much to blend
it<00:05:28.230> you<00:05:28.380> know<00:05:28.530> and<00:05:28.830> if<00:05:29.700> they<00:05:29.850> blended<00:05:30.270> it<00:05:30.390> all

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
it you know and if they blended it all

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570 
it you know and if they blended it all
together<00:05:30.780> maybe<00:05:31.590> they<00:05:31.860> can<00:05:32.040> have<00:05:32.190> a<00:05:32.220> little

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
together maybe they can have a little

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:35.120 
together maybe they can have a little
bit<00:05:32.730> less<00:05:33.000> of<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.390> clear<00:05:33.660> gel<00:05:34.050> and<00:05:34.410> a<00:05:34.860> little

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.130 
bit less of the clear gel and a little

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:36.680 
bit less of the clear gel and a little
bit<00:05:35.250> more<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.520> the<00:05:35.640> pigments<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:36.300> it<00:05:36.390> can<00:05:36.540> be<00:05:36.660> a

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
bit more of the pigments so it can be a

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:38.690 
bit more of the pigments so it can be a
little<00:05:36.990> bit<00:05:37.080> more<00:05:37.230> pigmented<00:05:37.860> so<00:05:38.220> that<00:05:38.550> would

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:38.700 
little bit more pigmented so that would

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:41.030 
little bit more pigmented so that would
make<00:05:38.880> this<00:05:39.030> foundation<00:05:39.570> better<00:05:39.810> for<00:05:40.140> me<00:05:40.320> but

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:41.040 
make this foundation better for me but

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.280 
make this foundation better for me but

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
wondering what this is like because it's

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:53.060 
wondering what this is like because it's
definitely<00:05:51.330> expensive<00:05:51.840> so<00:05:52.260> before<00:05:52.650> spending
