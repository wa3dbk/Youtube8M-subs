00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:23.210
 good afternoon dear viewers and subscribers 

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:25.430
 my channel with you dj on scott site 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.680
 updated picture which shows 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.140
 new animatronic why is it new and 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.239
 I will explain later 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:35.089
 the bottom left is written the final part 

00:00:32.239 --> 00:00:37.839
 then you understand yourself Scott himself said that 

00:00:35.089 --> 00:00:43.400
 so on four will be the last part alas 

00:00:37.839 --> 00:00:45.980
 below are the numbers there and 3115 is like me 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.739
 understood the release date of the game on October 10th 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:51.230
 years also with a clarified picture 

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.780
 below you can see the word nightmare that in 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:57.199
 translation means nightmare or scary 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:00.100
 dream by the way fnaf 3 6 night for some reason too 

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.100
 called on this 

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.820
 but now let's move on to the new 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.080
 I will immediately tell animatronics that this is not 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.090
 springtrap size and head does not look like 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.890
 here you see two options or is it new 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.409
 either it is a modified old 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:18.330
 animatronic but I think it's new 

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.470
 animatronic 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.040
 because pay attention to him 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:24.100
 finger 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.640
 their 5th past theories reasoned a lot 

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.070
 on the topic 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.290
 and where is the second suit about which says 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.420
 phone-guy because phone-guy is in 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.220
 the third part tells us that there were people 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.220
 made two special suits 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.500
 And now again attention on their finger here 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:49.710
 5 understand the hint it could be the same 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.940
 2 suit by the way the phone says that 

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:51.979
 in the morning the bones happened miserable 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:54.570
 happening 

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:58.430
 Apparently the employee of the pizzeria there squeezed 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:58.430
 like the purple man springtrape 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:04.200
 it's hard for me to say is there inside the gut 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.930
 and something human honestly i dont 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.090
 disassemble the whole picture 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:12.000
 brown-red is another feature 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.120
 this is not motronic this is his teeth they are new 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.090
 kinds of others just look at 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:21.290
 animatronics from past parts of this 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:25.519
 eerily sharp teeth and a lot of them 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.519
 there are no such animatronics 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.650
 another interesting point in this 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:36.530
 animatronic on the body of Freddie's head 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.540
 they are some very small you 

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:41.110
 For example, compare hats on these Freddy and 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:46.550
 in the hands of animatronics 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:50.600
 different in size times so in 4 of these 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.660
 There are a lot of heads that have sharp teeth. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.470
 again, such was not there then someone 

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.670
 in the course of collecting this animatronics 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.450
 By the way, Freddieâ€™s hat for some reason 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:03.310
 torn 

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:03.310
 although on the site it was whole 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.060
 but now my opinion, I believe that what the 

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.939
 the most 2 suit specially designed 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:16.730
 for a man since there are five fingers a 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:18.980
 the beauty is that he is on his body 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:23.000
 the head of Freddie whom we have never been anywhere 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:25.579
 not seen because the other teeth due 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.170
 someone finished this suit for me 

00:03:25.579 --> 00:03:27.709
 somehow I remembered a nightmare 

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:30.019
 Jeremiah 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:34.939
 from the second part when he has a review from 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:37.970
 faces animatronics and how do you think that 

00:03:34.939 --> 00:03:41.739
 is this a new animatronic or is it 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:41.739
 Freddy who modernized 

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:08.750
