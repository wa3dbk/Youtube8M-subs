 What is the similarity between 10 and Turks Saddam Hussein 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.750
 they both drove a very big s ii and I don't have this brand new one either 

00:00:19.749 --> 00:00:20.490
 agree on that 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.490

 lamborghini 

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.130
 lm 0 0 2 because you don't believe this is really a lamborghini 

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.650
 in that area 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:50.540
 and then what kind of a lamborghini really the last thing that gets your head at 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:54.560
 the name but who is this a truck is very good the Bible once not 

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.560
 paolo without a nose just what looks like a sea container 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:06.540
 Alderman The heavyweights in the car exist I don't have all cars while 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:10.310
 there were already you can sign up I have never had such a black hole that you have to 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.230
 a topic of debate 

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.230
 hand in the fourth set 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.840
 Maurice the dog was deceased son 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.310
 these motorways exceed 3000 kilos and yet it goes from 0 to 100 in less 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.870
 then 8 seconds and a top 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.870
 enschede with the door i don't even want to know 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.540
 if you switch to the new range rover sport you will notice that time 

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:05.720
 not stood still, however, what a revolution to a revolution almost 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:13.139
 the practice of course wants to be here now already in the early eighties this is must 

00:02:13.139 --> 00:02:16.949
 you need your news but also compared to the previous race about sport this is one 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:20.389
 significantly improves he is a lot lighter hundreds of kilos lighter 

00:02:23.139 --> 00:02:26.139
 However, many modern chassis that you also notice 

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.489
 it was a large wooden 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.489
 BNN is very sporty for theft 

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.749
 the 

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:55.279
 plastic plastic plastic but believe me there is a big v8 under the superchart 

00:02:55.279 --> 00:02:56.840
 500 and 10 hp 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.889
 no than this 

00:02:58.889 --> 00:02:59.880
 this engine 

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:03.129
 and that pahor not hoard the turnover nothing that fit in just to stop 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:07.640
 too large and too full this v12 also still the number of others who do not 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:08.819
 come home 

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:12.689
 I don't just look at the inner court for young viewers to put it one way 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.189
 12 connection points in Afghanistan 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:19.539
 you pay the tip of cleaning 

00:03:19.539 --> 00:03:21.309
 Yes 

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:27.299
 June are alfalab doctors and if it wasn't bought for too long by that sex I see 

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:30.989
 9,000 lanes it fell completely aside fed me drums rear corner 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.010
 why would I be a good rider if it is that heavy the tires are in lochem 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:38.299
 but not if you own the original tire 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:41.370
 there is a tire that was developed by pirelli especially for this car 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.999
 you can take a sober exhaust and riders with 180 through, among other things, sand in it 

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:49.579
 the cheek of the tire said March 6 the tires are not that I fit again 

00:03:49.579 --> 00:03:53.479
 get off to be she has made and if you then have a number then you can 

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:56.479
 the fourth set of $ 10,000 it 

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:11.209
 although the first engine is linked to an excessive five-lane just one 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.209
 good switching and daughter strength you have to have for that 

00:04:19.129 --> 00:04:23.779
 that was papandreou a little better on two and three sets kwo 

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:35.249
 that was very careful but just over 300 we built this car 

00:04:35.249 --> 00:04:38.249
 must be in the Netherlands 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:49.110
 of course this is not possible like the lamborghini let's be honest marie 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:50.599
 v8 herein is also 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:53.430
 amazingly good for a lot of power 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.800
 510 hp and 625 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:00.090
 then you go a lot of jack black is a large apartment building unbelieveable 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:02.490
 the or 

00:05:02.490 --> 00:05:07.280
 the 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:14.969
 Yes those were the ones in Ireland that race over this one 

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:18.279
 why all the sights of the Maldives of this car 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:23.400
 but these countries who do not who are in a free country all respects many maleh 

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.879
 the nicer what nonsense
