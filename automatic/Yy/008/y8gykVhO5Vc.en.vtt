what<00:01:55.829> I<00:01:55.860> have<00:01:56.100> here<00:01:56.399> in<00:01:56.520> front<00:01:56.670> of<00:01:56.880> me<00:01:56.969> is<00:01:57.030> an

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
what I have here in front of me is an

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.389 
what I have here in front of me is an
example<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.930> a<00:01:58.469> couple<00:01:58.770> different<00:01:58.890> steaks

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
example of a couple different steaks

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.300 
example of a couple different steaks
this<00:02:00.180> back<00:02:00.479> one<00:02:00.780> was<00:02:00.990> cut<00:02:01.229> from<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:01.890> wet<00:02:02.130> aged

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
this back one was cut from the wet aged

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.670 
this back one was cut from the wet aged
process<00:02:03.000> then<00:02:03.899> you'll<00:02:04.049> notice<00:02:04.320> that<00:02:04.439> it's<00:02:04.590> a

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:04.680 
process then you'll notice that it's a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.490 
process then you'll notice that it's a
little<00:02:04.920> rounder<00:02:05.399> a<00:02:05.579> little<00:02:06.060> thicker<00:02:06.500> in

little rounder a little thicker in
diameter<00:02:08.069> and<00:02:08.489> that's<00:02:09.030> because<00:02:09.390> it's<00:02:09.599> not

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:09.780 
diameter and that's because it's not

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:10.940 
diameter and that's because it's not
really<00:02:10.110> purged<00:02:10.410> any<00:02:10.679> of
