00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.580
 you knew that giving light is much more 

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.019
 efficient for its quality 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.850
 hello very good to everyone how are we 

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:09.110
 I hope well here in this video 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:11.780
 tutorial I will explain how 

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.889
 download and install in the version 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:14.240
 alpha 2 

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.269
 it is very easy we would need to have 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:19.519
 downloaded these four parts 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.710
 which are the game files in my 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:23.269
 case is for the 64 bit system for 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.310
 know the system that we have, let's not go on 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:27.650
 the beginning we would leave the team will 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:30.949
 we would click right and here where 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.450
 puts type of system says 67 4 bits os 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.790
 I will leave the links of the description of 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.100
 video 

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:38.740
 as much as for the 32-bit system 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:42.340
 as for the 64 system in my case and 

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.760
 You see the tutorial is very easy once 

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.690
 downloaded the files we would go 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.020
 we would also need to have installed 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.960
 the legit 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:52.640
 is that it is a file that is not a 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.750
 type program will back but that is 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.730
 much better 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:57.770
 we would simply click on the right 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.410
 first part open with the example more 

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.200
 default we give you a windows 

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:06.110
 truman and ready field 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.630
 fayez sorry and we would simply go to 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.090
 examine and we would go to the folder 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:15.020
 where we installed our blog fiarlo 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:17.660
 dyn then to flag we would open we would give 

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.910
 to accept and we would open this 

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.670
 we select the folder and we give 

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:25.370
 extract and here we would choose the route where 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:30.160
 extract it in my case on the desktop 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.690
 We give to accept then we give to accept 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:36.290
 here he will ask us for a password 

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:37.850
 so we put gamer 451 I have to 

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:39.140
 say that I have not uploaded this game 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.900
 I just found it by 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.450
 internet and I wanted to make a video 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:47.900
 tutorial just that so do 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:51.610
 so we could thank the gamer 4 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:53.560
 or 5 451 for uploading this game 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.290

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.350
 Now you will see good simply 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.650
 extract and masters these files already 

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:05.170
 we would be now would be extracted what 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:07.690

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:12.640
 put a blogger in the text and here upload 

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:14.740

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:24.860
 double click us to say it's the icon 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.260
 this 17 and if we open the game 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:30.080
 now we will wait for it to load and 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:31.880
 as you can see in the alpha 2 version that 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.670
 is what we have now in this 

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.040
 changed the game interface has 

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:39.410
 added music if I'm not wrong to 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.180
 put it in Spanish in case you have it in 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.520
 English simply left us two 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.360
 options to player and aki we would choose the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.070
 language that we wanted we want forgiveness 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.450
 and well this is all as you can see the 

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:52.280
 game works perfectly here 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.030
 We can choose several options of how 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.110
 create our world and all that 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.060
