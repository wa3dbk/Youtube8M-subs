into the treasure habitat now one of the
things<00:01:12.260> I<00:01:12.440> was<00:01:12.560> different<00:01:13.130> about<00:01:13.250> the<00:01:14.180> habitat

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
things I was different about the habitat

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.880 
things I was different about the habitat
now<00:01:15.050> is<00:01:15.410> that<00:01:16.070> the<00:01:16.250> habitat<00:01:17.560> allows<00:01:18.560> two

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
now is that the habitat allows two

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:20.980 
now is that the habitat allows two
dragons<00:01:19.460> now<00:01:19.610> as<00:01:19.850> we<00:01:20.030> know<00:01:20.060> before<00:01:20.660> that<00:01:20.840> it

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
dragons now as we know before that it

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:23.440 
dragons now as we know before that it
only<00:01:21.680> allowed<00:01:22.070> one<00:01:22.370> dragon<00:01:23.150> now<00:01:23.300> they

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
only allowed one dragon now they

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:26.620 
only allowed one dragon now they
upgraded<00:01:24.050> it<00:01:24.350> and<00:01:24.530> it<00:01:25.070> adds<00:01:25.220> two<00:01:25.760> dragons<00:01:26.390> or

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
upgraded it and it adds two dragons or

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.040 
upgraded it and it adds two dragons or

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
bright red ruby on its head and then

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.760 
bright red ruby on its head and then
there's<00:02:15.260> some<00:02:15.469> kind<00:02:15.739> of<00:02:15.829> a<00:02:15.950> silver

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
there's some kind of a silver

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.190 
there's some kind of a silver
I<00:02:17.220> think<00:02:17.880> he's<00:02:18.090> made<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.510> gold<00:02:18.780> that's<00:02:19.050> my

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
I think he's made of gold that's my

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.850 
I think he's made of gold that's my
opinion

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:21.860 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:28.190 

and<00:02:23.390> then<00:02:24.390> this<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.500> epic<00:02:26.040> forearm<00:02:27.200> so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
and then this is the epic forearm so

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.260 
and then this is the epic forearm so
that<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.680> about<00:02:28.980> it<00:02:29.280> there's<00:02:29.520> nothing<00:02:29.670> in

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
that is about it there's nothing in

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.360 
that is about it there's nothing in
particular<00:02:30.630> that's<00:02:31.320> different<00:02:31.920> about<00:02:32.190> this

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370 
particular that's different about this

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:34.700 
particular that's different about this
dragon<00:02:32.760> you<00:02:32.820> stop<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.240> buy<00:02:33.390> the<00:02:33.450> dragon<00:02:33.960> can't

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710 
dragon you stop to buy the dragon can't

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.130 
dragon you stop to buy the dragon can't
I<00:02:35.010> don't<00:02:35.370> think<00:02:35.730> you<00:02:35.820> can<00:02:35.940> breed<00:02:36.240> it<00:02:36.420> if<00:02:37.020> you

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
I don't think you can breed it if you

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:40.940 
I don't think you can breed it if you
can<00:02:37.410> then<00:02:37.910> yeah<00:02:38.910> then<00:02:39.660> you<00:02:39.780> probably<00:02:40.020> have<00:02:40.800> to

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
can then yeah then you probably have to

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.740 
can then yeah then you probably have to
let<00:02:41.130> me<00:02:41.280> know<00:02:41.310> but<00:02:42.060> I'm<00:02:42.210> pretty<00:02:42.390> sure<00:02:42.630> you

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:45.510 
can't I mean when they first started

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:47.690 
can't I mean when they first started
this<00:02:45.690> line<00:02:45.870> of<00:02:46.050> Dragon<00:02:46.530> they<00:02:46.680> said<00:02:46.950> buy<00:02:47.640> this

dragon in your game and basically that's

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.730 
dragon in your game and basically that's
hinting<00:02:52.380> usually<00:02:53.370> it<00:02:53.490> says<00:02:53.730> breed<00:02:54.600> or<00:02:54.960> buy<00:02:55.260> but

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:55.740 
hinting usually it says breed or buy but

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:58.190 
hinting usually it says breed or buy but
if<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.070> just<00:02:56.310> says<00:02:56.490> buy<00:02:56.880> there's<00:02:57.600> a<00:02:57.780> different

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
if it just says buy there's a different

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.100 
if it just says buy there's a different
story<00:02:58.440> but<00:02:58.650> this<00:02:58.890> one<00:02:59.190> they<00:03:00.000> just<00:03:00.480> said<00:03:00.720> hatch

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.110 
story but this one they just said hatch

00:03:01.110 --> 00:03:04.160 
story but this one they just said hatch
and<00:03:01.650> they<00:03:02.340> didn't<00:03:02.550> say<00:03:02.760> read<00:03:03.270> and<00:03:03.600> then<00:03:03.810> hatch

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
and they didn't say read and then hatch

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.280 
and they didn't say read and then hatch
or<00:03:04.530> something<00:03:04.950> like<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.100> but<00:03:05.790> anyways<00:03:06.180> um<00:03:06.420> I

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
or something like that but anyways um I

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.170

guess<00:03:07.740> they're<00:03:07.890> just<00:03:07.920> carefully<00:03:08.670> using<00:03:08.910> my

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:09.180 
guess they're just carefully using my

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.260 
guess they're just carefully using my
words<00:03:09.480> now<00:03:09.780> but<00:03:10.200> that<00:03:10.860> is<00:03:10.890> about<00:03:11.460> it<00:03:11.760> that's

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.270 
words now but that is about it that's

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.150
