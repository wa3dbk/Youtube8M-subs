okay<00:00:01.560> so<00:00:01.620> let's<00:00:01.979> move<00:00:02.220> on<00:00:02.520> let's<00:00:03.210> go<00:00:03.419> on<00:00:03.449> to<00:00:04.069> the

00:00:05.059 --> 00:00:05.069 
okay so let's move on let's go on to the

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay so let's move on let's go on to the
trim

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
trim

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.820 
trim
now<00:00:06.420> there's<00:00:06.750> three<00:00:07.140> different<00:00:07.470> types<00:00:07.649> of

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
now there's three different types of

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:09.980 
now there's three different types of
trim<00:00:08.099> there's<00:00:08.370> trim<00:00:08.670> in<00:00:08.820> general<00:00:09.240> there's<00:00:09.690> El

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
trim there's trim in general there's El

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.709 
trim there's trim in general there's El
trim<00:00:10.410> and<00:00:10.620> there's<00:00:10.769> our<00:00:10.980> trim<00:00:11.340> so<00:00:12.000> let's<00:00:12.570> go

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
trim and there's our trim so let's go

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.700 
trim and there's our trim so let's go
ahead<00:00:12.840> and<00:00:12.960> say<00:00:13.230> string<00:00:14.240> trimmed<00:00:15.240> equals<00:00:16.020> trim

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
ahead and say string trimmed equals trim

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.830 
ahead and say string trimmed equals trim
and<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.699> is<00:00:17.910> string<00:00:18.510> here<00:00:19.640> string<00:00:20.640> so<00:00:21.600> why<00:00:21.779> is

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
and that is string here string so why is

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.210 
and that is string here string so why is
this<00:00:22.020> function<00:00:22.410> useful<00:00:22.800> well<00:00:22.949> what<00:00:23.100> this

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
this function useful well what this

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.950 
this function useful well what this
world<00:00:23.460> what<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.760> will<00:00:23.880> do<00:00:23.970> first<00:00:24.300> is<00:00:24.570> it<00:00:24.840> will

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
world what it will do first is it will

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.759 
world what it will do first is it will
trim<00:00:25.439> the<00:00:25.470> white<00:00:26.220> space<00:00:27.080> from<00:00:28.080> the<00:00:28.349> left<00:00:28.619> and

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
trim the white space from the left and

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.470 
trim the white space from the left and
the<00:00:28.830> right<00:00:29.130> hand<00:00:29.369> side<00:00:29.670> of<00:00:29.820> a<00:00:29.880> string<00:00:30.179> so<00:00:30.359> if

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:30.480 
the right hand side of a string so if

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.749 
the right hand side of a string so if
we've<00:00:30.929> got<00:00:30.960> white<00:00:31.289> space<00:00:31.619> here<00:00:31.650> and<00:00:32.520> we've<00:00:32.730> got

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
we've got white space here and we've got

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.910 
we've got white space here and we've got
white<00:00:33.000> space<00:00:33.270> here<00:00:33.570> this<00:00:34.170> function<00:00:34.380> will<00:00:34.739> just

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
white space here this function will just

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.990 
white space here this function will just
return<00:00:35.250> this<00:00:35.730> itself<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:36.899> let's<00:00:37.079> go<00:00:37.200> ahead<00:00:37.320> and

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:38.000 
return this itself so let's go ahead and

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.670 
return this itself so let's go ahead and
first<00:00:39.000> of<00:00:39.210> all<00:00:39.270> echo<00:00:39.660> out<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.960> string<00:00:40.350> so<00:00:40.649> we

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:40.680 
first of all echo out the string so we

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.240 
first of all echo out the string so we
can<00:00:40.860> see<00:00:41.040> what<00:00:41.190> we've<00:00:41.309> got<00:00:41.340> here

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:43.250 
can see what we've got here

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.400 
can see what we've got here
I'm<00:00:44.250> refresh<00:00:44.610> okay<00:00:45.510> so<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.719> can<00:00:45.870> see<00:00:45.899> that<00:00:46.289> I

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
I'm refresh okay so you can see that I

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:47.750 
I'm refresh okay so you can see that I
know<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.770> because<00:00:47.070> it's<00:00:47.280> going<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> return

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
know that's because it's going to return

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.540 
know that's because it's going to return
I'll<00:00:47.969> eyes<00:00:48.149> now<00:00:48.950> well<00:00:49.950> I'm<00:00:50.100> not<00:00:50.219> sure<00:00:50.280> how<00:00:50.489> to

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:50.550 
I'll eyes now well I'm not sure how to

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.150 
I'll eyes now well I'm not sure how to
show<00:00:50.879> you<00:00:50.940> this<00:00:51.120> as<00:00:51.360> an<00:00:51.510> example<00:00:51.890> but<00:00:52.890> we<00:00:52.980> could

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
show you this as an example but we could

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.299 
show you this as an example but we could
go<00:00:53.280> ahead<00:00:53.489> an<00:00:53.579> echo<00:00:54.559> string<00:00:56.480> trimmed<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.160> this

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309 
go ahead an echo string trimmed so this

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.369 
go ahead an echo string trimmed so this
is<00:00:59.460> just<00:00:59.579> basically<00:00:59.760> going<00:01:00.270> to<00:01:00.420> return<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
is just basically going to return the

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:06.710 
is just basically going to return the
trimmed<00:01:02.129> string<00:01:05.090> think<00:01:06.090> if<00:01:06.210> we<00:01:06.330> go<00:01:06.479> ahead<00:01:06.570> and

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
trimmed string think if we go ahead and

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.300 
trimmed string think if we go ahead and
put<00:01:07.049> in<00:01:07.260> &amp;<00:01:09.590> nbsp

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
put in &amp; nbsp

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.429 
put in &amp; nbsp
in<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:13.130> cool<00:01:14.659> and<00:01:15.659> we<00:01:15.780> put<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.049> at<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.350> end

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
in there cool and we put that at the end

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:20.719 
in there cool and we put that at the end
as<00:01:16.830> well<00:01:16.860> which<00:01:17.340> is<00:01:17.369> an<00:01:18.060> HTML<00:01:18.659> space<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:20.100> let's

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:20.729 
as well which is an HTML space and let's

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:24.440 
as well which is an HTML space and let's
echo<00:01:21.090> out<00:01:21.270> string

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.640 

okay<00:01:25.450> yeah<00:01:25.570> so<00:01:25.750> now<00:01:25.900> we've<00:01:26.080> got<00:01:26.200> a<00:01:26.230> space<00:01:26.500> at

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:26.650 
okay yeah so now we've got a space at

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.230 
okay yeah so now we've got a space at
the<00:01:26.740> start<00:01:27.040> and<00:01:27.190> the<00:01:27.280> end<00:01:27.310> of<00:01:27.760> our<00:01:27.850> string

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:28.240 
the start and the end of our string

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:30.450 
the start and the end of our string
let's<00:01:28.930> go<00:01:29.050> ahead<00:01:29.170> now<00:01:29.440> and<00:01:29.470> echo<00:01:29.770> out<00:01:29.980> string

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:30.460 
let's go ahead now and echo out string

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:35.430 
let's go ahead now and echo out string
trimmed<00:01:31.150> and<00:01:31.680> should<00:01:32.680> produce<00:01:33.190> oh<00:01:34.320> no<00:01:35.320> because

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
trimmed and should produce oh no because

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.130 
trimmed and should produce oh no because
I'm<00:01:35.590> using<00:01:35.830> HTML<00:01:36.310> data<00:01:36.490> anyway<00:01:36.940> okay<00:01:37.660> so<00:01:37.690> let

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
I'm using HTML data anyway okay so let

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.570 
I'm using HTML data anyway okay so let
me<00:01:38.230> just<00:01:38.350> explain<00:01:38.680> this<00:01:38.800> rather<00:01:39.220> than

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
me just explain this rather than

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.000 
me just explain this rather than
demonstrate<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.510> if<00:01:41.290> we<00:01:41.500> were<00:01:41.710> to<00:01:41.860> have<00:01:41.980> a

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:42.010 
demonstrate it if we were to have a

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.950 
demonstrate it if we were to have a
string<00:01:42.310> like<00:01:42.460> this<00:01:42.490> why<00:01:43.330> might<00:01:43.600> we<00:01:43.630> have<00:01:43.930> a

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:43.960 
string like this why might we have a

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.630 
string like this why might we have a
string<00:01:44.260> like<00:01:44.410> this<00:01:44.440> well<00:01:45.130> let's<00:01:45.310> say<00:01:45.430> you<00:01:45.520> are

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
string like this well let's say you are

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:50.400 
string like this well let's say you are
feeding<00:01:45.880> in<00:01:46.150> values<00:01:46.570> from<00:01:46.870> a<00:01:47.880> from<00:01:48.880> a<00:01:49.410> text

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
feeding in values from a from a text

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:52.800 
feeding in values from a from a text
file<00:01:50.590> for<00:01:50.830> example<00:01:51.280> and<00:01:51.460> you'd<00:01:52.060> use<00:01:52.330> say<00:01:52.630> an

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:52.810 
file for example and you'd use say an

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.800 
file for example and you'd use say an
explode<00:01:53.260> function<00:01:53.860> to<00:01:54.130> get<00:01:55.060> each<00:01:55.210> value

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
explode function to get each value

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:01.890 
explode function to get each value
separated<00:01:56.770> by<00:01:57.220> comma<00:01:57.610> into<00:01:59.790> into<00:02:00.790> a<00:02:01.270> string

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
separated by comma into into a string

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.170 
separated by comma into into a string
you<00:02:02.590> may<00:02:02.710> have<00:02:02.860> white<00:02:03.100> space<00:02:03.400> on<00:02:03.640> either<00:02:03.760> side

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
you may have white space on either side

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.880 
you may have white space on either side
now<00:02:04.210> this<00:02:04.510> might<00:02:04.750> affect<00:02:04.869> if<00:02:05.320> statements

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
now this might affect if statements

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:07.859 
now this might affect if statements
because<00:02:06.040> you<00:02:06.250> might<00:02:06.400> be<00:02:06.479> comparing<00:02:07.479> let's<00:02:07.660> say

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
because you might be comparing let's say

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.290 
because you might be comparing let's say
if<00:02:08.110> the<00:02:08.649> certain<00:02:09.040> value<00:02:09.070> is<00:02:09.520> equal<00:02:09.880> to<00:02:10.030> this

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:10.300 
if the certain value is equal to this

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:12.210 
if the certain value is equal to this
that<00:02:10.570> I've<00:02:10.690> just<00:02:10.840> highlighted<00:02:11.080> in<00:02:11.440> blue<00:02:11.650> when

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
that I've just highlighted in blue when

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.460 
that I've just highlighted in blue when
in<00:02:12.310> actual<00:02:12.580> fact<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.970> might<00:02:13.120> equal<00:02:13.570> this<00:02:14.200> which

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:14.470 
in actual fact it might equal this which

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.870 
in actual fact it might equal this which
I've<00:02:14.620> highlighted<00:02:14.740> in<00:02:15.160> blue<00:02:15.310> so<00:02:15.490> might<00:02:15.730> have

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
I've highlighted in blue so might have

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.330 
I've highlighted in blue so might have
white<00:02:16.450> space<00:02:16.750> either<00:02:16.959> side<00:02:17.290> we<00:02:17.830> can<00:02:18.040> use<00:02:18.190> this

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:18.340 
white space either side we can use this

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.630 
white space either side we can use this
trim<00:02:18.790> function<00:02:19.690> to<00:02:20.590> trim<00:02:21.070> the<00:02:21.190> white<00:02:21.340> space

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
trim function to trim the white space

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.490 
trim function to trim the white space
from<00:02:21.850> the<00:02:22.030> left<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.540> the<00:02:22.600> right<00:02:22.810> which<00:02:23.320> will

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
from the left and the right which will

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.560 
from the left and the right which will
then<00:02:23.650> just<00:02:23.920> result<00:02:24.280> in<00:02:24.459> the<00:02:24.850> string<00:02:25.209> itself

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:25.570 
then just result in the string itself

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:28.699 
then just result in the string itself
here<00:02:26.489> so<00:02:27.489> that's<00:02:27.640> the<00:02:27.790> trim<00:02:28.090> function

00:02:28.699 --> 00:02:28.709 
here so that's the trim function

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.740 
here so that's the trim function
alternatively<00:02:29.709> if<00:02:29.920> you<00:02:29.950> just<00:02:30.220> wanted<00:02:30.550> to<00:02:30.750> trim

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
alternatively if you just wanted to trim

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.540 
alternatively if you just wanted to trim
the<00:02:31.900> left<00:02:32.140> hand<00:02:32.380> side<00:02:32.620> white<00:02:32.950> space<00:02:33.250> you<00:02:33.430> can

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:33.550 
the left hand side white space you can

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:36.150 
the left hand side white space you can
use<00:02:33.670> L<00:02:33.850> trim<00:02:34.239> and<00:02:34.420> vice<00:02:35.380> versa<00:02:35.680> if<00:02:35.830> you<00:02:35.890> wanted

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:36.160 
use L trim and vice versa if you wanted

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:37.860 
use L trim and vice versa if you wanted
to<00:02:36.280> trim<00:02:36.550> the<00:02:36.700> right<00:02:36.910> hand<00:02:37.150> side<00:02:37.390> white<00:02:37.600> space

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
to trim the right hand side white space

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.229 
to trim the right hand side white space
you<00:02:38.050> can<00:02:38.200> use<00:02:38.320> our<00:02:38.560> trim<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.430> is<00:02:39.820> the<00:02:40.000> our

00:02:40.229 --> 00:02:40.239 
you can use our trim so that is the our

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.410 
you can use our trim so that is the our
trim<00:02:40.660> function<00:02:40.959> and<00:02:41.410> the<00:02:42.310> left<00:02:42.940> and<00:02:43.209> the

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:43.420 
trim function and the left and the

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:46.920 
trim function and the left and the
standard<00:02:44.350> trim<00:02:44.650> of<00:02:44.890> course<00:02:45.660> okay<00:02:46.660> so<00:02:46.720> the<00:02:46.900> last

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
standard trim of course okay so the last

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.410 
standard trim of course okay so the last
we're<00:02:47.800> going<00:02:47.950> to<00:02:48.040> talk<00:02:48.220> about<00:02:48.250> is<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:48.940> mainly

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
we're going to talk about is that mainly

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.410 
we're going to talk about is that mainly
for<00:02:49.600> security<00:02:50.200> purposes<00:02:50.920> let's<00:02:51.910> go<00:02:52.060> ahead<00:02:52.150> and

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
for security purposes let's go ahead and

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:58.250 
for security purposes let's go ahead and
say<00:02:52.600> string<00:02:53.049> is<00:02:53.290> equal<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.830> this<00:02:54.430> is<00:02:55.360> a<00:02:56.190> string

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:58.260 
say string is equal to this is a string

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.440 
say string is equal to this is a string
maybe<00:02:59.260> and<00:02:59.530> here<00:02:59.890> we<00:03:00.100> could<00:03:00.459> yet<00:03:01.090> well<00:03:01.299> we'll

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
maybe and here we could yet well we'll

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.259 
maybe and here we could yet well we'll
leave<00:03:01.600> it<00:03:01.720> as<00:03:01.870> now<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.739> is<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.070> add<00:03:03.519> slashes

00:03:04.259 --> 00:03:04.269 
leave it as now this is the add slashes

00:03:04.269 --> 00:03:08.729 
leave it as now this is the add slashes
function<00:03:04.930> so<00:03:05.489> slashes<00:03:06.489> equals<00:03:07.120> add<00:03:07.739> slashes

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
function so slashes equals add slashes

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:13.020 
function so slashes equals add slashes
and<00:03:09.330> we'll<00:03:10.330> supply<00:03:10.900> that<00:03:11.170> with<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.560> string<00:03:12.459> so

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
and we'll supply that with the string so

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.370 
and we'll supply that with the string so
let's<00:03:13.060> go<00:03:13.330> ahead<00:03:13.390> and<00:03:13.690> echo<00:03:14.019> out<00:03:14.340> string

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
let's go ahead and echo out string

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:20.490 
let's go ahead and echo out string
slashes<00:03:17.380> to<00:03:17.530> see<00:03:17.680> the<00:03:17.799> result<00:03:18.100> that<00:03:18.220> we've<00:03:18.370> got

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
slashes to see the result that we've got

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.440 
slashes to see the result that we've got
okay<00:03:21.500> nothing<00:03:21.710> at<00:03:21.950> the<00:03:22.010> moment<00:03:22.090> now<00:03:23.090> let's<00:03:23.330> go

okay nothing at the moment now let's go

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.370 
okay nothing at the moment now let's go
ahead<00:03:23.540> and<00:03:23.900> add<00:03:24.020> in<00:03:25.630> image<00:03:26.630> source<00:03:27.080> equals

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
ahead and add in image source equals

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:32.470 
ahead and add in image source equals
something<00:03:28.780> so<00:03:29.780> image<00:03:30.500> jpg<00:03:31.370> for<00:03:31.610> example<00:03:32.060> now

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
something so image jpg for example now

something so image jpg for example now
the<00:03:32.810> first<00:03:33.050> thing<00:03:33.230> is<00:03:33.410> when<00:03:33.920> we<00:03:33.950> test<00:03:34.340> this

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:34.490 
the first thing is when we test this

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:35.980 
the first thing is when we test this
you'll<00:03:34.670> see<00:03:34.730> that<00:03:34.910> it's<00:03:35.180> added<00:03:35.270> slashes

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:35.990 
you'll see that it's added slashes

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.280 
you'll see that it's added slashes
before<00:03:36.440> this<00:03:36.650> and<00:03:36.980> and<00:03:37.390> this<00:03:38.390> double

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
before this and and this double

now that we've produced a string with
this<00:04:50.270> that<00:04:50.540> data<00:04:51.050> here<00:04:51.410> so<00:04:51.620> what<00:04:52.190> we've<00:04:52.310> done

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
this that data here so what we've done

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:54.430 
this that data here so what we've done
is<00:04:52.580> we've<00:04:52.760> used<00:04:52.790> the<00:04:53.270> add<00:04:53.480> slashes<00:04:54.110> to<00:04:54.140> add

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:54.440 
is we've used the add slashes to add

00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:56.920 
is we've used the add slashes to add
slashes<00:04:55.100> just<00:04:55.520> in<00:04:55.670> here<00:04:56.000> let's<00:04:56.540> go<00:04:56.630> ahead<00:04:56.690> and

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:56.930 
slashes just in here let's go ahead and

00:04:56.930 --> 00:05:01.450 
slashes just in here let's go ahead and
remove<00:04:57.020> this<00:04:57.500> add<00:04:57.740> slashes<00:04:58.220> function<00:04:58.670> and<00:05:00.460> you

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
remove this add slashes function and you

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.970 
remove this add slashes function and you
can<00:05:01.580> see<00:05:01.760> that<00:05:01.940> that's<00:05:02.030> just<00:05:02.300> produced<00:05:02.830> on<00:05:03.830> its

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:03.980 
can see that that's just produced on its

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.570 
can see that that's just produced on its
own<00:05:04.130> so<00:05:04.700> why<00:05:04.940> is<00:05:05.000> this<00:05:05.510> HTML<00:05:06.110> entity<00:05:06.680> sorry<00:05:07.250> why

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:07.580 
own so why is this HTML entity sorry why

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:10.120 
own so why is this HTML entity sorry why
is<00:05:07.640> this<00:05:07.940> add<00:05:08.600> slashes<00:05:09.170> function<00:05:09.530> useful

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:10.130 
is this add slashes function useful

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:12.250 
is this add slashes function useful
well<00:05:10.490> it's<00:05:10.640> useful<00:05:11.000> so<00:05:11.150> we<00:05:11.180> don't<00:05:11.480> we<00:05:12.110> don't

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:12.260 
well it's useful so we don't we don't

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:14.500 
well it's useful so we don't we don't
pass<00:05:12.590> anything<00:05:13.010> that<00:05:13.640> we<00:05:13.730> don't<00:05:13.910> want<00:05:14.120> to<00:05:14.300> for

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:14.510 
pass anything that we don't want to for

00:05:14.510 --> 00:05:16.990 
pass anything that we don't want to for
example<00:05:14.540> with<00:05:15.350> them<00:05:15.710> SQL<00:05:16.280> injection<00:05:16.310> which<00:05:16.880> I

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
example with them SQL injection which I

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.850 
example with them SQL injection which I
do<00:05:17.060> have<00:05:17.330> another<00:05:17.510> video<00:05:17.810> on<00:05:17.870> so<00:05:18.320> go<00:05:18.530> ahead<00:05:18.650> and

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:18.860 
do have another video on so go ahead and

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:20.080 
do have another video on so go ahead and
and<00:05:19.100> watch<00:05:19.370> that<00:05:19.550> if<00:05:19.610> you<00:05:19.790> haven't<00:05:19.940> already

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:20.090 
and watch that if you haven't already

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:23.020 
and watch that if you haven't already
and<00:05:20.480> if<00:05:21.230> you've<00:05:21.380> used<00:05:21.800> database<00:05:22.280> databases

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:23.030 
and if you've used database databases

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:25.630 
and if you've used database databases
before<00:05:23.330> that'll<00:05:23.960> be<00:05:24.050> useful<00:05:24.230> but<00:05:24.980> add<00:05:25.160> slashes

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
before that'll be useful but add slashes

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:30.240 
before that'll be useful but add slashes
is<00:05:25.790> basically<00:05:27.190> going<00:05:28.190> to<00:05:28.340> add<00:05:29.210> our<00:05:29.270> slashes<00:05:29.990> to

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:30.250 
is basically going to add our slashes to

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:33.640 
is basically going to add our slashes to
escape<00:05:31.250> different<00:05:31.610> characters<00:05:32.170> for<00:05:33.170> security

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:33.650 
escape different characters for security

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.160 
escape different characters for security
purposes<00:05:34.130> so<00:05:34.670> now<00:05:35.270> what<00:05:35.480> we<00:05:35.570> can<00:05:35.720> do<00:05:35.870> is<00:05:36.020> go

00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:36.170 
purposes so now what we can do is go

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:44.910 
purposes so now what we can do is go
ahead<00:05:36.470> and<00:05:36.710> say<00:05:38.740> echo<00:05:40.150> strip<00:05:41.150> slashes<00:05:43.450> and

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920 
ahead and say echo strip slashes and

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.000 
ahead and say echo strip slashes and
then<00:05:45.920> we<00:05:45.980> go<00:05:46.100> so<00:05:46.840> let's<00:05:47.840> go<00:05:48.080> ahead<00:05:48.200> and<00:05:48.410> get<00:05:48.860> rid

00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:49.010 
then we go so let's go ahead and get rid

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:52.900 
then we go so let's go ahead and get rid
of<00:05:49.070> that<00:05:49.280> there<00:05:49.790> and<00:05:50.000> you<00:05:50.090> can<00:05:51.020> see<00:05:51.260> that<00:05:51.910> we've

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:52.910 
of that there and you can see that we've

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:55.090 
of that there and you can see that we've
got<00:05:53.150> rid<00:05:53.300> of<00:05:53.330> them<00:05:53.510> so<00:05:54.170> we've<00:05:54.380> added<00:05:54.560> slashes

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:55.100 
got rid of them so we've added slashes

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:56.470 
got rid of them so we've added slashes
here<00:05:55.280> and<00:05:55.370> we've<00:05:55.460> stripped<00:05:55.760> slashes<00:05:56.240> here

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:56.480 
here and we've stripped slashes here

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.210 
here and we've stripped slashes here
let's<00:05:57.050> just<00:05:57.230> get<00:05:57.320> rid<00:05:57.440> of<00:05:57.530> that<00:05:57.650> again<00:05:57.950> so<00:05:58.190> you

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
let's just get rid of that again so you

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.780 
let's just get rid of that again so you
can<00:05:58.430> see<00:05:58.490> the<00:05:58.730> difference<00:06:00.130> there<00:06:01.130> so<00:06:01.640> why

00:06:01.780 --> 00:06:01.790 
can see the difference there so why

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:04.360 
can see the difference there so why
would<00:06:01.940> you<00:06:02.000> want<00:06:02.150> to<00:06:02.270> strip<00:06:02.570> slashes<00:06:03.080> well<00:06:03.650> for

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
would you want to strip slashes well for

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.690 
would you want to strip slashes well for
example<00:06:04.790> data<00:06:05.030> may<00:06:05.450> be<00:06:05.480> stored<00:06:06.220> in<00:06:07.220> a<00:06:07.310> database

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:07.700 
example data may be stored in a database

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.940 
example data may be stored in a database
if<00:06:08.180> it<00:06:08.600> was<00:06:08.690> going<00:06:08.780> to<00:06:08.840> be<00:06:08.990> produced<00:06:09.500> on<00:06:09.710> to<00:06:09.919> a

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
if it was going to be produced on to a

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.790 
if it was going to be produced on to a
page<00:06:10.810> for<00:06:11.810> viewing<00:06:12.050> and<00:06:12.290> you<00:06:12.380> might<00:06:12.560> want<00:06:12.740> to

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
page for viewing and you might want to

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.040 
page for viewing and you might want to
strip<00:06:13.160> the<00:06:13.370> slashes<00:06:13.850> or<00:06:14.090> add<00:06:14.480> the<00:06:14.660> slashes

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:15.050 
strip the slashes or add the slashes

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.800 
strip the slashes or add the slashes
rather<00:06:15.290> so<00:06:15.590> this<00:06:15.770> isn't<00:06:15.950> passed<00:06:16.310> as<00:06:16.550> HTML<00:06:17.120> code

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:17.810 
rather so this isn't passed as HTML code

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.510 
rather so this isn't passed as HTML code
now<00:06:18.500> why<00:06:18.680> would<00:06:18.830> you<00:06:18.860> want<00:06:19.010> to<00:06:19.130> strip<00:06:19.370> the

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
now why would you want to strip the

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.700 
now why would you want to strip the
slashes<00:06:20.000> if<00:06:20.150> you<00:06:20.570> were<00:06:20.690> say<00:06:20.900> putting<00:06:21.500> this

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:21.710 
slashes if you were say putting this

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.370 
slashes if you were say putting this
data<00:06:21.950> back<00:06:22.250> into<00:06:22.520> a<00:06:22.550> text<00:06:23.030> box<00:06:23.300> for<00:06:23.630> people<00:06:24.230> to

00:06:24.370 --> 00:06:24.380 
data back into a text box for people to

00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:26.290 
data back into a text box for people to
edit<00:06:24.680> so<00:06:24.980> you<00:06:25.010> might<00:06:25.280> have<00:06:25.490> this<00:06:25.640> in<00:06:25.790> an<00:06:25.940> input

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:26.300 
edit so you might have this in an input

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.630 
edit so you might have this in an input
text<00:06:26.690> box<00:06:26.740> you'll<00:06:27.740> want<00:06:27.919> to<00:06:28.010> strip<00:06:28.460> the

00:06:28.630 --> 00:06:28.640 
text box you'll want to strip the

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:30.400 
text box you'll want to strip the
slashes<00:06:29.060> before<00:06:29.390> you<00:06:29.510> put<00:06:29.720> it<00:06:29.840> into<00:06:29.990> a<00:06:30.140> text

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:30.410 
slashes before you put it into a text

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.650 
slashes before you put it into a text
box<00:06:30.650> for<00:06:30.919> people<00:06:31.430> to<00:06:31.520> edit<00:06:31.820> and<00:06:31.970> then<00:06:32.330> you<00:06:32.450> want

00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:32.660 
box for people to edit and then you want

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.540 
box for people to edit and then you want
to<00:06:32.780> obviously<00:06:32.930> add<00:06:33.350> slashes<00:06:33.890> when<00:06:34.040> it's<00:06:34.400> going

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:34.550 
to obviously add slashes when it's going

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:38.280 
to obviously add slashes when it's going
to<00:06:34.640> be<00:06:34.760> viewed<00:06:35.030> as<00:06:35.150> plain<00:06:35.450> text<00:06:35.780> on<00:06:36.110> a<00:06:36.169> page

to be viewed as plain text on a page
anywhere<00:06:39.190> on<00:06:39.430> your<00:06:39.460> website<00:06:39.610> so<00:06:40.240> what<00:06:41.050> if<00:06:41.230> you

anywhere on your website so what if you
ever<00:06:41.470> find<00:06:41.740> you<00:06:41.920> need<00:06:42.070> to<00:06:42.220> get<00:06:42.460> rid<00:06:42.640> of<00:06:42.700> these

00:06:43.010 --> 00:06:43.020 
ever find you need to get rid of these

00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:49.310 
ever find you need to get rid of these

your<00:06:54.460> page<00:06:54.670> securely<00:06:55.120> then<00:06:55.690> the<00:06:56.260> add<00:06:56.410> slashes

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:57.100 
your page securely then the add slashes

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:00.120 
your page securely then the add slashes
is<00:06:57.310> is<00:06:58.000> the<00:06:58.210> function<00:06:58.570> to<00:06:58.690> use<00:06:58.870> and<00:06:59.080> to<00:06:59.710> remove

00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:00.130 
is is the function to use and to remove

00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:03.570 
is is the function to use and to remove
this<00:07:00.430> it<00:07:00.760> strip<00:07:01.450> slashes<00:07:02.190> which<00:07:03.190> will<00:07:03.430> then

00:07:03.570 --> 00:07:03.580 
this it strip slashes which will then

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.420 
this it strip slashes which will then
allow<00:07:03.610> you<00:07:03.880> to<00:07:04.090> view<00:07:04.420> the<00:07:04.480> plain<00:07:04.870> data<00:07:05.430> so

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:06.430 
allow you to view the plain data so

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:08.490 
allow you to view the plain data so
that's<00:07:06.640> a<00:07:06.730> short<00:07:07.090> collection<00:07:07.930> of<00:07:08.110> string

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:08.500 
that's a short collection of string

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:11.040 
that's a short collection of string
functions<00:07:08.980> in<00:07:09.160> PHP<00:07:09.310> there<00:07:09.820> are<00:07:09.910> many<00:07:10.150> more<00:07:10.420> you

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:11.050 
functions in PHP there are many more you

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:13.920 
functions in PHP there are many more you
can<00:07:11.170> go<00:07:11.290> to<00:07:11.350> the<00:07:11.500> PHP<00:07:11.980> manual<00:07:12.160> php.net<00:07:12.940> have<00:07:13.900> a

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:13.930 
can go to the PHP manual php.net have a

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:15.360 
can go to the PHP manual php.net have a
look<00:07:14.140> through<00:07:14.260> the<00:07:14.350> string<00:07:14.650> functions<00:07:15.130> but

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:15.370 
look through the string functions but

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.150 
look through the string functions but
these<00:07:15.760> are<00:07:15.910> the<00:07:15.970> ones<00:07:16.150> that<00:07:16.270> I<00:07:16.420> tend<00:07:16.780> to<00:07:16.900> use

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:17.160 
these are the ones that I tend to use

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:21.750 
these are the ones that I tend to use
apart<00:07:18.160> from<00:07:18.460> the<00:07:19.500> string<00:07:20.500> reverse<00:07:20.650> I<00:07:21.160> tend<00:07:21.700> to

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:21.760 
apart from the string reverse I tend to

00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:24.390 
apart from the string reverse I tend to
use<00:07:21.880> I<00:07:22.240> on<00:07:22.510> a<00:07:22.540> regular<00:07:22.630> basis<00:07:23.380> when<00:07:24.040> I'm<00:07:24.160> coding

00:07:24.390 --> 00:07:24.400 
use I on a regular basis when I'm coding

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.060 
use I on a regular basis when I'm coding
so<00:07:25.180> yet<00:07:25.810> they're<00:07:26.020> the<00:07:26.050> string<00:07:26.380> functions<00:07:26.830> in

00:07:27.060 --> 00:07:27.070 
so yet they're the string functions in

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:29.310 
so yet they're the string functions in
PHP
