00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
have a brand new blade from bench made

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.200 
have a brand new blade from bench made
in<00:00:38.700> the<00:00:38.790> shop<00:00:39.030> this<00:00:39.989> has<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.739> g10<00:00:41.520> handle<00:00:41.550> scale

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
in the shop this has a g10 handle scale

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.930 
in the shop this has a g10 handle scale
but<00:00:43.110> not<00:00:43.200> texturize<00:00:43.770> g10<00:00:44.190> it's<00:00:44.370> milled<00:00:44.640> so

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
but not texturize g10 it's milled so

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.299 
but not texturize g10 it's milled so
it's<00:00:45.420> smooth<00:00:45.750> and<00:00:46.379> it<00:00:46.500> has<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> milling<00:00:47.129> for

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
it's smooth and it has the milling for

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:50.569 
it's smooth and it has the milling for

then<00:00:51.539> those<00:00:51.660> have<00:00:51.870> a<00:00:52.110> steel<00:00:52.649> liner<00:00:53.690> you<00:00:54.690> can

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
then those have a steel liner you can

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:55.580 
then those have a steel liner you can
see<00:00:54.989> there's<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.230> little<00:00:55.379> bit<00:00:55.559> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
see there's a little bit of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.240 
see there's a little bit of

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:20.030 
of the 154cm steel thumb studs part
serrated<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.720> like<00:01:19.409> I<00:01:19.560> said<00:01:19.619> a<00:01:19.770> first

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
serrated and like I said a first

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.070 
serrated and like I said a first
production<00:01:20.310> run<00:01:20.549> this<00:01:21.420> one<00:01:21.630> happens<00:01:21.930> to<00:01:21.990> be

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
production run this one happens to be

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.320 
production run this one happens to be
number<00:01:22.350> 34<00:01:22.860> of<00:01:23.070> 500<00:01:23.640> so<00:01:23.759> let's<00:01:23.909> talk<00:01:24.000> about<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
number 34 of 500 so let's talk about the

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:28.399 
number 34 of 500 so let's talk about the
action<00:01:25.549> it<00:01:26.549> has<00:01:26.610> the<00:01:26.909> axis<00:01:27.330> system<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.990> if<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
action it has the axis system and if you

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.620 
action it has the axis system and if you
want<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.619> fire<00:01:28.860> it<00:01:28.890> out<00:01:29.070> automatically<00:01:29.909> you

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630 
want to fire it out automatically you

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.370 
want to fire it out automatically you
pull<00:01:31.350> down<00:01:31.619> the<00:01:32.040> axis<00:01:32.900> has<00:01:33.900> a<00:01:33.930> little<00:01:34.200> bit<00:01:34.290> of

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
pull down the axis has a little bit of

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.920 
pull down the axis has a little bit of
resistance<00:01:34.680> there<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.189> the<00:01:35.280> bottom<00:01:35.460> and<00:01:36.119> the

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
resistance there at the bottom and the

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.050 
resistance there at the bottom and the
knife<00:01:37.079> flies<00:01:37.409> out<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:38.549> we'll<00:01:38.729> do<00:01:38.820> that<00:01:38.880> again

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
knife flies out and we'll do that again

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.280 
knife flies out and we'll do that again
so<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.479> want<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.689> see<00:01:39.810> the<00:01:39.900> knife<00:01:40.020> fly

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
so you want to see the knife fly

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:42.770 
so you want to see the knife fly
automatically<00:01:41.040> you<00:01:41.610> slide<00:01:41.970> down<00:01:42.000> the<00:01:42.390> axis

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
automatically you slide down the axis

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.539 
automatically you slide down the axis
system<00:01:42.960> through<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:43.860> resistance<00:01:44.250> at<00:01:44.460> the

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
system through the resistance at the

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.149 
system through the resistance at the
bottom<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.119> then<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.689> flies<00:01:46.049> out<00:01:46.290> you<00:01:46.890> want<00:01:47.070> to

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
bottom and then I flies out you want to

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.249 
bottom and then I flies out you want to
use<00:01:47.250> the<00:01:47.430> knife<00:01:47.579> as<00:01:47.790> a<00:01:47.850> manual<00:01:48.270> folder<00:01:48.689> you

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
use the knife as a manual folder you

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.569 
use the knife as a manual folder you
just<00:01:49.439> go<00:01:49.560> ahead<00:01:49.619> and<00:01:49.799> use<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.100> thumb<00:01:50.250> studs

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
just go ahead and use the thumb studs

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.499 
just go ahead and use the thumb studs
and<00:01:50.939> the<00:01:51.210> knife<00:01:51.360> opens<00:01:52.040> very<00:01:53.040> smoothly<00:01:53.509> still

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
and the knife opens very smoothly still

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.539 
and the knife opens very smoothly still
close<00:01:54.750> it<00:01:54.899> with<00:01:54.990> the<00:01:55.020> axis<00:01:55.470> system<00:01:55.649> it<00:01:56.250> still

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
close it with the axis system it still

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.030 
close it with the axis system it still
locks<00:01:56.820> up<00:01:57.060> rock<00:01:57.329> solid<00:01:57.630> with<00:01:58.350> the<00:01:58.469> axis<00:01:58.860> system

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
locks up rock solid with the axis system

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.120 
locks up rock solid with the axis system
either<00:01:59.490> way<00:01:59.880> I<00:02:00.240> really<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.350> this<00:02:01.530> blade<00:02:01.829> I

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
either way I really like this blade I

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.490 
either way I really like this blade I
like<00:02:02.520> the<00:02:02.670> idea<00:02:03.000> of<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.899> automatic<00:02:04.259> version

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:04.500 
like the idea of the automatic version

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.859 
like the idea of the automatic version
