that<00:00:50.810> we<00:00:50.930> did<00:00:51.170> a<00:00:51.440> couple<00:00:51.829> of<00:00:52.220> years<00:00:52.309> ago<00:00:52.670> is<00:00:53.000> a

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.030 
that we did a couple of years ago is a

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.560 
that we did a couple of years ago is a

full lifecycle analysis of where energy
and<00:00:57.230> where<00:00:57.410> water<00:00:57.710> is<00:00:57.950> consumed<00:00:58.579> through<00:00:59.450> the

00:00:59.620 --> 00:00:59.630 
and where water is consumed through the

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.860 
and where water is consumed through the
lifecycle<00:01:00.050> of<00:01:00.320> a<00:01:00.469> pair<00:01:00.710> of<00:01:00.739> jeans<00:01:01.040> and<00:01:01.870> a

lifecycle of a pair of jeans and a

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.140 
lifecycle of a pair of jeans and a
couple<00:01:03.350> of<00:01:03.559> fun<00:01:03.770> facts<00:01:04.070> out<00:01:04.339> of<00:01:04.489> that<00:01:04.610> first<00:01:05.000> of

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:05.150 
couple of fun facts out of that first of

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.360 
couple of fun facts out of that first of
all<00:01:05.239> sixty<00:01:05.690> percent<00:01:05.870> of<00:01:06.260> the<00:01:06.500> energy<00:01:06.950> is

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:07.370 
all sixty percent of the energy is

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:09.910 
all sixty percent of the energy is
actually<00:01:07.909> used<00:01:08.330> once<00:01:08.840> the<00:01:09.020> consumer<00:01:09.500> has<00:01:09.680> the

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
actually used once the consumer has the

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.399 
actually used once the consumer has the
product<00:01:10.310> in<00:01:10.460> their<00:01:10.670> in<00:01:11.270> their<00:01:11.600> wardrobe<00:01:12.200> in

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:12.409 
product in their in their wardrobe in

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:14.710 
product in their in their wardrobe in
their<00:01:12.590> closet<00:01:13.190> so<00:01:13.790> a<00:01:13.820> big<00:01:14.150> chunk<00:01:14.479> of<00:01:14.600> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
their closet so a big chunk of the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:18.219 
their closet so a big chunk of the
energy<00:01:15.080> is<00:01:15.200> consumed<00:01:15.650> by<00:01:15.770> the<00:01:16.280> consumer<00:01:17.229> the

00:01:18.219 --> 00:01:18.229 
energy is consumed by the consumer the

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:21.070 
energy is consumed by the consumer the
second<00:01:18.560> big<00:01:18.680> fun<00:01:18.890> fact<00:01:19.190> is<00:01:19.690> because<00:01:20.690> we're<00:01:20.900> so

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:21.080 
second big fun fact is because we're so

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.580 
second big fun fact is because we're so
dependent<00:01:21.799> on<00:01:22.190> cotton<00:01:22.810> about<00:01:23.810> 50<00:01:24.170> percent<00:01:24.530> of

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:24.590 
dependent on cotton about 50 percent of

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.310 
dependent on cotton about 50 percent of
the<00:01:24.650> water<00:01:24.799> use<00:01:25.240> happens<00:01:26.240> before<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:27.110> product

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:27.320 
the water use happens before the product

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.109 
the water use happens before the product
ever<00:01:27.590> winds<00:01:27.950> up<00:01:28.070> in<00:01:28.190> a<00:01:28.250> pair<00:01:28.460> of<00:01:28.520> jeans<00:01:28.790> that

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
ever winds up in a pair of jeans that

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:31.920 
ever winds up in a pair of jeans that
happens<00:01:30.020> in<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.680> growing<00:01:31.189> of<00:01:31.340> the<00:01:31.369> cotton

happens in the growing of the cotton

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:35.890 
happens in the growing of the cotton
itself<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:33.680> other<00:01:33.830> 45<00:01:34.430> percent<00:01:34.880> of<00:01:34.970> cotton<00:01:35.390> of

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
itself the other 45 percent of cotton of

itself the other 45 percent of cotton of
water<00:01:36.260> use<00:01:36.530> happens<00:01:37.189> once<00:01:37.939> it's<00:01:38.090> in<00:01:38.270> the

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:38.360 
water use happens once it's in the

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.240 
water use happens once it's in the
consumers<00:01:38.869> home<00:01:39.020> about<00:01:39.380> five<00:01:39.650> percent<00:01:40.130> is

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:40.250 
consumers home about five percent is

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.940 
consumers home about five percent is
within<00:01:40.430> our<00:01:40.760> direct<00:01:41.150> control<00:01:41.530> so<00:01:42.530> we've<00:01:42.710> put<00:01:42.920> a

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
within our direct control so we've put a

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.620 
within our direct control so we've put a
lot<00:01:43.159> based<00:01:43.520> on<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.850> science<00:01:44.240> we've<00:01:44.390> put<00:01:44.600> a

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:44.630 
lot based on that science we've put a

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:47.380 
lot based on that science we've put a
lot<00:01:44.869> of<00:01:45.080> effort<00:01:45.439> into<00:01:46.150> educating<00:01:47.150> the

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:47.390 
lot of effort into educating the

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
about that long it it's not that long

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.690 
about that long it it's not that long
and<00:03:09.610> it's<00:03:09.820> easily<00:03:10.030> doable<00:03:10.510> and<00:03:11.050> it<00:03:11.830> it<00:03:12.340> it

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
feasibility of doing that and so that's

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.110 
feasibility of doing that and so that's
part<00:03:16.930> of<00:03:17.170> it's<00:03:17.680> about<00:03:17.860> engaging<00:03:18.430> in<00:03:18.670> a<00:03:18.790> two-way

that well a few years ago we realized

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.610 
that well a few years ago we realized
just<00:03:51.370> as<00:03:51.790> the<00:03:52.030> recession<00:03:52.930> was<00:03:53.110> starting<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:57.060 --> 00:03:57.070 
hit hard that there was a shift in

00:03:57.070 --> 00:03:59.910 
hit hard that there was a shift in
consumption<00:03:57.820> going<00:03:58.360> on<00:03:58.600> just<00:03:59.320> amongst<00:03:59.680> a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
consumption going on just amongst a

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
small group of people but we felt it was

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:03.960 
small group of people but we felt it was
a<00:04:01.930> potentially<00:04:02.860> really<00:04:03.130> important<00:04:03.550> shift

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:03.970 
a potentially really important shift

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.810 
a potentially really important shift
where<00:04:04.690> people<00:04:05.290> were<00:04:05.380> reacting<00:04:05.530> to<00:04:06.100> hard<00:04:06.520> times

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:06.820 
where people were reacting to hard times

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.610 
where people were reacting to hard times
by<00:04:08.040> investing<00:04:09.040> in<00:04:09.630> more<00:04:10.630> expensive<00:04:11.140> products

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:11.620 
by investing in more expensive products

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.590 
by investing in more expensive products
that<00:04:11.800> would<00:04:11.890> last<00:04:12.100> a<00:04:12.490> longer<00:04:13.090> time<00:04:13.300> that<00:04:13.510> they

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:13.600 
that would last a longer time that they

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:14.880 
that would last a longer time that they
were<00:04:13.690> recognizing<00:04:14.350> that<00:04:14.470> value<00:04:14.860> proposition

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:14.890 
were recognizing that value proposition

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:17.729 
were recognizing that value proposition
so<00:04:15.640> we<00:04:15.820> wanted<00:04:16.150> to<00:04:16.330> engage<00:04:16.600> with<00:04:17.560> those<00:04:17.680> people

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
so we wanted to engage with those people

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:20.670 
so we wanted to engage with those people

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:22.660 
realized that that's just a small part

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.650 
realized that that's just a small part
of<00:04:22.750> it<00:04:22.900> that<00:04:23.710> we<00:04:24.700> needed<00:04:24.940> to<00:04:25.120> engage<00:04:25.270> with<00:04:25.630> our
