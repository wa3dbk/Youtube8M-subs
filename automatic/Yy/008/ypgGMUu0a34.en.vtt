rabbit<00:02:23.510> tremendous<00:02:24.440> what's<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.280> hardest

00:02:25.509 --> 00:02:25.519 
rabbit tremendous what's the hardest

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:27.070 
rabbit tremendous what's the hardest
thing<00:02:25.730> is<00:02:25.849> just<00:02:25.880> not<00:02:26.390> standing<00:02:26.840> still

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:27.080 
thing is just not standing still

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.729 
thing is just not standing still
yes<00:02:27.739> most<00:02:28.310> of<00:02:28.400> the<00:02:28.459> times<00:02:28.760> I<00:02:29.410> dribbling<00:02:30.410> I<00:02:30.560> go

00:02:30.729 --> 00:02:30.739 
yes most of the times I dribbling I go

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:33.340 
yes most of the times I dribbling I go
forward<00:02:31.519> but<00:02:32.390> here<00:02:32.600> you<00:02:32.720> have<00:02:32.750> to<00:02:32.959> stay<00:02:33.140> here

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:33.350 
forward but here you have to stay here

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.099 
forward but here you have to stay here
round<00:02:33.700> which<00:02:34.700> is<00:02:34.730> more<00:02:35.180> difficult<00:02:35.359> it's<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.930> lot

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:36.109 
round which is more difficult it's a lot

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:38.470 
round which is more difficult it's a lot
more<00:02:36.260> difficult<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.850> I<00:02:37.850> think<00:02:38.060> there's<00:02:38.359> more

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
more difficult and I think there's more

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:40.120 
more difficult and I think there's more
easy<00:02:38.630> for<00:02:38.690> them<00:02:38.959> usually<00:02:39.350> you'd<00:02:39.709> move<00:02:39.890> a<00:02:39.980> lot

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
easy for them usually you'd move a lot

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.640 
easy for them usually you'd move a lot
quicker<00:02:40.160> yeah<00:02:40.760> that's<00:02:41.180> our<00:02:41.359> way<00:02:41.510> no<00:02:42.410> it's<00:02:42.530> just

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:42.650 
quicker yeah that's our way no it's just

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.680 
quicker yeah that's our way no it's just
for<00:02:42.890> I<00:02:43.100> give<00:02:43.340> you<00:02:43.430> opportunity<00:02:43.910> to<00:02:44.030> them<00:02:44.150> to<00:02:44.359> to

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
for I give you opportunity to them to to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.370 
for I give you opportunity to them to to
give<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.870> shot<00:02:46.359> you<00:02:47.359> being<00:02:47.660> fair<00:02:47.870> playing<00:02:48.230> it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.990 

so<00:02:57.560> how<00:02:57.770> did<00:02:57.830> he<00:02:58.070> manage<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.550> get<00:02:58.700> through<00:02:58.880> the

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
so how did he manage to get through the

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.930 
so how did he manage to get through the
course<00:02:59.410> virtually<00:03:00.410> unscathed<00:03:00.940> when

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
course virtually unscathed when

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.190 
course virtually unscathed when
Christiana<00:03:02.390> was<00:03:02.570> doing<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.840> test<00:03:03.020> with<00:03:03.140> the

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
Christiana was doing the test with the

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.500 
Christiana was doing the test with the
snipers<00:03:03.650> see<00:03:04.010> a<00:03:04.040> lot<00:03:04.370> of<00:03:04.520> very<00:03:04.760> good<00:03:04.850> very

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
snipers see a lot of very good very

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.110 
snipers see a lot of very good very
impressive<00:03:06.080> close<00:03:06.860> work<00:03:07.130> with<00:03:07.520> the<00:03:07.610> ball<00:03:07.790> lot

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
impressive close work with the ball lot

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:29.960 
impressive close work with the ball lot
of<00:03:08.180> skills<00:03:08.480> on<00:03:08.660> shore

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.690 

he<00:03:30.970> manages<00:03:31.360> to<00:03:31.780> combine<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.410> Cruyff<00:03:32.830> turn<00:03:32.860> with

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700 
he manages to combine a Cruyff turn with

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.300 
he manages to combine a Cruyff turn with
R<00:03:33.730> all<00:03:34.000> in<00:03:34.209> the<00:03:34.540> outside<00:03:34.930> of<00:03:35.110> his<00:03:35.200> foot<00:03:35.410> over

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
R all in the outside of his foot over

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:38.610 
R all in the outside of his foot over
the<00:03:36.430> top<00:03:36.580> of<00:03:36.610> the<00:03:36.760> ball<00:03:37.200> swiveling<00:03:38.200> background

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:38.620 
the top of the ball swiveling background

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:40.890 
the top of the ball swiveling background
then<00:03:39.010> drops<00:03:39.340> his<00:03:39.519> center<00:03:39.760> of<00:03:39.819> gravity<00:03:39.900> knocks

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:40.900 
then drops his center of gravity knocks

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:42.449 
then drops his center of gravity knocks
the<00:03:41.080> ball<00:03:41.230> from<00:03:41.349> his<00:03:41.500> feet<00:03:41.709> and<00:03:41.920> accelerates

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
the ball from his feet and accelerates

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.740 
the ball from his feet and accelerates
away<00:03:42.700> leaving<00:03:43.120> his<00:03:43.300> opponent<00:03:43.720> for<00:03:43.840> dead

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
away leaving his opponent for dead

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.840 
away leaving his opponent for dead
if<00:03:45.680> we<00:03:45.860> watch<00:03:46.040> something<00:03:46.310> such<00:03:46.610> as<00:03:46.730> the

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
if we watch something such as the

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:48.880 
if we watch something such as the
step-over<00:03:47.420> we<00:03:47.840> see<00:03:48.020> that<00:03:48.170> the<00:03:48.260> timing<00:03:48.560> of<00:03:48.800> the

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
step-over we see that the timing of the

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:51.010 
step-over we see that the timing of the
step-over<00:03:49.250> occurs<00:03:49.670> at<00:03:50.120> just<00:03:50.450> the<00:03:50.570> right<00:03:50.750> time

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:51.020 
step-over occurs at just the right time

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:52.630 
step-over occurs at just the right time
to<00:03:51.200> make<00:03:51.350> the<00:03:51.470> opponent<00:03:51.680> think<00:03:52.160> that<00:03:52.550> he's

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
to make the opponent think that he's

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:54.250 
to make the opponent think that he's
going<00:03:52.760> to<00:03:52.850> move<00:03:52.940> one<00:03:53.180> way<00:03:53.210> before<00:03:53.960> offering

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:54.260 
going to move one way before offering

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.200 
going to move one way before offering
them<00:03:54.440> the<00:03:54.530> signal<00:03:54.740> to<00:03:55.280> move<00:03:55.460> the<00:03:55.610> other<00:03:55.730> but

00:03:56.200 --> 00:03:56.210 
them the signal to move the other but

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.840 
them the signal to move the other but
the<00:03:56.300> key<00:03:56.510> is<00:03:56.720> that<00:03:56.930> fast<00:03:57.530> foot<00:03:57.770> movement<00:03:58.250> lots

00:03:58.840 --> 00:03:58.850 
the key is that fast foot movement lots

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:00.520 
the key is that fast foot movement lots
of<00:03:58.970> little<00:03:59.180> touches<00:03:59.570> and<00:03:59.750> keeping<00:04:00.290> the<00:04:00.380> ball

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:00.530 
of little touches and keeping the ball

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:03.000 
of little touches and keeping the ball
moving

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:03.010 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:05.280 

it<00:04:03.549> was<00:04:03.670> really<00:04:04.060> amazing<00:04:04.360> to<00:04:04.720> see<00:04:04.750> that<00:04:05.170> he

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
it was really amazing to see that he

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.809 
it was really amazing to see that he
managed<00:04:05.590> to<00:04:05.650> perform<00:04:06.040> so<00:04:06.340> well<00:04:06.610> in<00:04:06.760> a

00:04:06.819 --> 00:04:08.640 
managed to perform so well in a
situation<00:04:07.420> that<00:04:07.599> he<00:04:07.959> wouldn't<00:04:08.230> necessarily

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
situation that he wouldn't necessarily

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.830 
situation that he wouldn't necessarily
have<00:04:08.769> been<00:04:08.890> in<00:04:09.250> ever<00:04:09.519> before<00:04:09.970> but<00:04:10.599> he<00:04:10.689> could

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:10.840 
have been in ever before but he could

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:12.660 
have been in ever before but he could
still<00:04:10.959> keep<00:04:11.260> control<00:04:11.709> keep<00:04:11.950> his<00:04:12.069> beliefs<00:04:12.400> nice

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:12.670 
still keep control keep his beliefs nice

still keep control keep his beliefs nice

today's tests have revealed how his body

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:17.969 
today's tests have revealed how his body
plays<00:05:16.810> a<00:05:16.840> crucial<00:05:17.199> role<00:05:17.440> in<00:05:17.800> his

plays a crucial role in his

plays a crucial role in his
effectiveness<00:05:18.580> on<00:05:18.880> the<00:05:19.090> pitch<00:05:20.039> one<00:05:21.039> of<00:05:21.130> the

strength and his power I think this is

strength and his power I think this is
what<00:05:25.090> sets<00:05:25.330> him<00:05:25.419> apart<00:05:25.740> alongside<00:05:26.740> that<00:05:27.220> high

in other players find it very very hard

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.710
