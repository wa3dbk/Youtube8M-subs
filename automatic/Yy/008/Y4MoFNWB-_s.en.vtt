for the last 3040 years is how on earth

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.709 
for the last 3040 years is how on earth
the<00:00:08.309> brain<00:00:08.519> represents<00:00:09.139> information<00:00:10.139> and<00:00:10.400> an

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679 
eternally appealing idea it's something

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.060 
eternally appealing idea it's something
like<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.160> language<00:00:14.490> of<00:00:14.820> thought<00:00:15.030> that<00:00:16.070> there's

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
like a language of thought that there's

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.250 
like a language of thought that there's
brain<00:00:17.369> writing<00:00:17.850> or<00:00:18.000> mental<00:00:18.660> ease<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.080> we

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
brain writing or mental ease and we

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.099 
brain writing or mental ease and we
write<00:00:19.500> the<00:00:20.130> brain<00:00:20.369> writes<00:00:20.760> sentences<00:00:21.570> and

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:22.109 
write the brain writes sentences and

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
mental ease that a store the belief so

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.240 
mental ease that a store the belief so
that<00:00:25.890> when<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:26.519> learn<00:00:27.150> that<00:00:28.010> giraffes<00:00:29.010> are

that when you learn that giraffes are

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.160 
that when you learn that giraffes are
mammals<00:00:29.490> there's<00:00:30.359> some<00:00:30.539> place<00:00:30.720> in<00:00:30.900> your<00:00:30.990> brain

mammals there's some place in your brain

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.319 
mammals there's some place in your brain
where<00:00:31.500> the<00:00:31.679> word<00:00:31.859> the<00:00:32.460> mental<00:00:32.820> words<00:00:33.030> your<00:00:33.300> a

with<00:00:35.550> an<00:00:35.700> is<00:00:35.880> ax<00:00:35.910> or<00:00:36.239> something<00:00:37.020> like<00:00:37.170> that<00:00:37.410> so

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
with an is ax or something like that so

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.190 
with an is ax or something like that so
we<00:00:37.649> have<00:00:37.800> we<00:00:38.579> have<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> big<00:00:39.360> library<00:00:39.960> of

we have we have a big library of

we have we have a big library of
sentences<00:00:40.770> those<00:00:41.610> are<00:00:41.760> our<00:00:41.879> beliefs<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.420> have

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
sentences those are our beliefs we have

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.529 
sentences those are our beliefs we have
a<00:00:42.540> belief<00:00:42.899> box<00:00:43.230> with<00:00:43.559> lots<00:00:43.590> of<00:00:43.860> beliefs<00:00:44.539> it's

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
a belief box with lots of beliefs it's

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.619 
a belief box with lots of beliefs it's
an<00:00:46.200> attractive<00:00:46.590> idea<00:00:46.920> nice<00:00:47.430> has<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.180> certain

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
an attractive idea nice has a certain

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.869 
an attractive idea nice has a certain
simplicity<00:00:48.809> that<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.980> we<00:00:50.219> think<00:00:50.789> we

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
simplicity that and we think we

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.600 
simplicity that and we think we
understand<00:00:51.390> how<00:00:51.770> sentences<00:00:52.770> work<00:00:53.160> to<00:00:53.370> store

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
understand how sentences work to store

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.790 
understand how sentences work to store
information<00:00:54.440> well<00:00:55.440> now<00:00:55.649> if<00:00:56.489> that<00:00:56.670> were<00:00:56.850> so

00:00:57.790 --> 00:00:57.800 
information well now if that were so

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:01.639 
information well now if that were so
could<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:58.829> clever<00:00:59.820> enough<00:01:00.170> neurosurgeon<00:01:01.170> why

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
could a clever enough neurosurgeon why

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.680 
could a clever enough neurosurgeon why
are<00:01:01.829> in<00:01:02.010> a<00:01:02.309> false<00:01:02.550> belief<00:01:02.789> just<00:01:03.270> out<00:01:03.480> of<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
are in a false belief just out of the

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.149 
are in a false belief just out of the
blue<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> let's<00:01:05.549> imagine<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.299> our

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
blue so let's imagine that our

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:10.219 
blue so let's imagine that our
neurosurgeon<00:01:08.159> decides<00:01:08.520> to<00:01:08.970> wire<00:01:09.720> into<00:01:10.020> your

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
neurosurgeon decides to wire into your

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.350 
neurosurgeon decides to wire into your
brain<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:11.310> belief<00:01:11.549> that<00:01:11.580> you<00:01:11.850> have<00:01:12.000> an<00:01:12.119> older

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
brain the belief that you have an older

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.560 
brain the belief that you have an older
brother<00:01:12.390> living<00:01:12.810> in<00:01:13.020> Cleveland<00:01:14.420> figures<00:01:15.420> out

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
brother living in Cleveland figures out

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.410 
brother living in Cleveland figures out
how<00:01:15.689> to<00:01:15.750> write<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.229> in<00:01:16.409> brainish<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.420> does

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
how to write that in brainish and does

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.780 
how to write that in brainish and does
all<00:01:18.600> the<00:01:18.860> microsurgery<00:01:19.860> and<00:01:20.100> there<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.670> is

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
all the microsurgery and there it is

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:24.170 
all the microsurgery and there it is
written<00:01:21.330> in<00:01:21.570> brainish<00:01:22.110> in<00:01:22.290> your<00:01:22.439> brain<00:01:23.180> okay

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
written in brainish in your brain okay

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.289 
written in brainish in your brain okay
you<00:01:24.420> wake<00:01:24.600> up<00:01:24.780> from<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.159> anaesthetic<00:01:26.159> and<00:01:26.340> so

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
you wake up from the anaesthetic and so

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.960 
you wake up from the anaesthetic and so
he<00:01:27.420> says<00:01:27.600> yeah<00:01:27.979> do<00:01:28.979> you<00:01:29.040> have<00:01:29.130> any<00:01:29.310> siblings

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
he says yeah do you have any siblings

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.359 
he says yeah do you have any siblings
well<00:01:30.780> if<00:01:31.020> he's<00:01:31.140> done<00:01:31.320> his<00:01:31.470> work<00:01:31.650> well<00:01:31.680> I<00:01:31.890> guess

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
well if he's done his work well I guess

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.450 
well if he's done his work well I guess
first<00:01:33.150> thing<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.509> do<00:01:33.689> is<00:01:33.840> you<00:01:33.960> say<00:01:34.110> yes<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.310> have

one<00:02:01.979> possibility<00:02:02.990> in<00:02:03.990> other<00:02:04.140> words<00:02:04.380> you

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
one possibility in other words you

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.889 
one possibility in other words you
couldn't<00:02:05.310> just<00:02:05.579> wire<00:02:05.790> in<00:02:06.030> one<00:02:06.270> belief<00:02:06.600> you

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
couldn't just wire in one belief you

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.690 
couldn't just wire in one belief you
would<00:02:06.990> have<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.320> wire<00:02:07.950> in<00:02:08.220> something<00:02:08.580> which

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
would have to wire in something which

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.600 
would have to wire in something which
generated<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.450> whole<00:02:09.629> slew<00:02:09.989> of

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:10.610 
generated a whole slew of

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.670 
generated a whole slew of
alternatively<00:02:11.610> maybe<00:02:12.030> you<00:02:12.330> would<00:02:12.540> say<00:02:13.530> oh<00:02:13.560> my

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
alternatively maybe you would say oh my

what<00:02:21.600> made<00:02:21.810> me<00:02:21.990> say<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.310> in<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.490> case<00:02:23.700> what

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
what made me say that in that case what

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.400 
what made me say that in that case what
we<00:02:24.420> would<00:02:24.570> see<00:02:24.780> is<00:02:24.870> that<00:02:25.020> whatever<00:02:25.230> the

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:25.410 
we would see is that whatever the

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.500 
we would see is that whatever the
surgeon<00:02:25.950> did<00:02:26.100> it<00:02:26.250> wasn't<00:02:26.400> wiring<00:02:26.970> in<00:02:27.090> a<00:02:27.180> belief

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
surgeon did it wasn't wiring in a belief

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.870 
surgeon did it wasn't wiring in a belief
because<00:02:28.410> as<00:02:28.590> soon<00:02:28.770> as<00:02:28.950> you<00:02:29.100> reflected<00:02:29.610> on<00:02:29.730> it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:29.880 
because as soon as you reflected on it

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.210 
because as soon as you reflected on it
boom<00:02:30.210> it<00:02:30.450> just<00:02:30.480> vanished<00:02:31.170> it<00:02:31.350> disappeared

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:32.220 
boom it just vanished it disappeared

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:36.140 
boom it just vanished it disappeared
well<00:02:32.970> if<00:02:33.090> it's<00:02:33.240> a<00:02:33.360> belief<00:02:34.220> then<00:02:35.220> it's<00:02:35.580> got<00:02:36.000> to

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
well if it's a belief then it's got to

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.170 
well if it's a belief then it's got to
be<00:02:36.950> secured<00:02:37.950> to<00:02:38.100> a<00:02:38.280> lot<00:02:38.520> of<00:02:38.670> other<00:02:38.820> beliefs

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:39.180 
be secured to a lot of other beliefs

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.240 
be secured to a lot of other beliefs
that's<00:02:39.450> just<00:02:39.750> on<00:02:39.960> the<00:02:40.110> nature<00:02:40.350> belief<00:02:40.860> you

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
that's just on the nature belief you

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:45.320 
that's just on the nature belief you
can't<00:02:41.640> have<00:02:42.480> an<00:02:42.959> isolated<00:02:43.950> belief<00:02:44.850> like<00:02:45.180> I

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
can't have an isolated belief like I

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:46.730 
can't have an isolated belief like I
have<00:02:45.570> an<00:02:45.690> older<00:02:45.959> brother<00:02:45.990> living<00:02:46.530> in

have an older brother living in
Cleveland<00:02:47.209> if<00:02:48.209> that<00:02:48.890> state<00:02:49.890> was<00:02:50.190> one<00:02:50.400> that<00:02:50.550> you

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
Cleveland if that state was one that you

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:52.790 
Cleveland if that state was one that you
seem<00:02:50.970> to<00:02:51.000> be<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:51.420> we'd<00:02:51.810> want<00:02:52.020> to<00:02:52.110> explore<00:02:52.470> to

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
seem to be in we'd want to explore to

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.400 
seem to be in we'd want to explore to
see<00:02:52.830> what<00:02:53.670> came<00:02:53.910> along<00:02:54.240> with<00:02:54.480> it<00:02:54.630> and<00:02:54.780> either

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
see what came along with it and either

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:57.590 
see what came along with it and either
we<00:02:55.650> would<00:02:55.800> decide<00:02:56.160> that<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.490> had<00:02:56.670> some<00:02:56.970> weird

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
we would decide that you had some weird

00:02:57.600 --> 00:03:01.220 
we would decide that you had some weird
sort<00:02:57.959> of<00:02:58.220> growth<00:02:59.220> in<00:02:59.520> your<00:02:59.640> brain<00:02:59.910> that<00:03:00.230> made

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
sort of growth in your brain that made

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.650 
sort of growth in your brain that made
you<00:03:01.440> fixate<00:03:02.070> on<00:03:02.100> a<00:03:02.280> sentence<00:03:02.790> sort<00:03:03.540> of

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
you fixate on a sentence sort of

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.850 
you fixate on a sentence sort of
parrot-like<00:03:04.430> and<00:03:05.430> you'd<00:03:06.360> say<00:03:06.630> I'm<00:03:07.500> an<00:03:07.709> only

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
parrot-like and you'd say I'm an only

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.680 
parrot-like and you'd say I'm an only
child<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.490> I<00:03:08.640> have<00:03:08.820> an<00:03:08.940> older<00:03:09.209> brother<00:03:09.240> living

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
child and I have an older brother living

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.100 
child and I have an older brother living
in<00:03:09.870> Cleveland<00:03:11.360> which<00:03:12.360> of<00:03:12.630> course<00:03:12.690> would<00:03:13.050> be

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
in Cleveland which of course would be

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.740 
in Cleveland which of course would be
contradicting<00:03:14.070> yourself<00:03:14.239> what<00:03:15.239> we<00:03:15.390> wouldn't

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
contradicting yourself what we wouldn't

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:17.360 
contradicting yourself what we wouldn't
decide<00:03:16.080> is<00:03:16.350> that<00:03:16.380> you<00:03:16.650> believed<00:03:16.980> you<00:03:17.100> had<00:03:17.220> an

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:17.370 
decide is that you believed you had an

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.210 
decide is that you believed you had an
older<00:03:17.610> brother<00:03:17.640> living<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.300> Cleveland<00:03:19.220> what

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
older brother living in Cleveland what

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.850 
older brother living in Cleveland what
this<00:03:20.430> little<00:03:21.360> thought<00:03:21.540> experiment<00:03:21.989> shows<00:03:22.500> is

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:22.860 
this little thought experiment shows is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:28.160 
this little thought experiment shows is
that<00:03:24.800> beliefs<00:03:25.800> don't<00:03:26.600> parcel<00:03:27.600> themselves<00:03:28.050> out

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
that beliefs don't parcel themselves out

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.949 
that beliefs don't parcel themselves out
the<00:03:28.350> way<00:03:28.470> sentences<00:03:28.980> do<00:03:29.360> you<00:03:30.360> could<00:03:30.540> take<00:03:30.720> any

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
the way sentences do you could take any

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.900 
the way sentences do you could take any
sentence<00:03:31.440> on<00:03:31.560> any<00:03:31.709> topic<00:03:32.010> and<00:03:32.430> write<00:03:32.610> it<00:03:32.760> on

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:32.910 
sentence on any topic and write it on

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:35.240 
sentence on any topic and write it on
any<00:03:33.330> medium<00:03:33.989> you<00:03:34.019> like<00:03:34.290> and<00:03:34.500> put<00:03:34.530> it<00:03:34.920> in<00:03:35.070> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
any medium you like and put it in a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:37.820 
any medium you like and put it in a
drawer<00:03:35.790> and<00:03:35.850> there<00:03:36.180> it<00:03:36.390> would<00:03:36.540> be<00:03:36.830> beliefs

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
drawer and there it would be beliefs

drawer and there it would be beliefs
aren't<00:03:38.130> like<00:03:38.280> that<00:03:38.480> they<00:03:39.480> come<00:03:40.440> in<00:03:40.709> systems

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
aren't like that they come in systems

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:44.360 
aren't like that they come in systems
they<00:03:41.519> cohere<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.720> large<00:03:42.959> clumps<00:03:43.470> this<00:03:44.160> is

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
they cohere in large clumps this is

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.400 
they cohere in large clumps this is
sometimes<00:03:45.209> called<00:03:45.510> holism

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
sometimes called holism

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.710 
sometimes called holism
and<00:03:46.620> there's<00:03:47.610> still<00:03:47.850> some<00:03:48.030> theorists<00:03:48.570> who

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
and there's still some theorists who

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.410 
and there's still some theorists who
think<00:03:48.750> that<00:03:48.989> holism<00:03:49.440> is<00:03:49.739> a<00:03:49.769> bad<00:03:50.040> idea<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.790> think

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
think that holism is a bad idea I think

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.259 
think that holism is a bad idea I think
it's<00:03:51.750> got<00:03:52.080> to<00:03:52.290> be<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.530> case<00:03:52.760> holism<00:03:53.760> is<00:03:53.970> a<00:03:54.030> good

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
it's got to be the case holism is a good

00:03:54.269 --> 00:03:59.449 
it's got to be the case holism is a good
idea<00:03:54.690> that<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:56.989> particulate<00:03:57.989> non<00:03:58.739> holistic
