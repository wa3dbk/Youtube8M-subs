 how old are you retired 65 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.399
 well now i would like to ask about myself 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.860
 the main question when did you start to be 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:44.299
 vegetarian what reasons prompted 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.299
 you be a vegetarian 

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:52.650
 first beginning at 30 years old by 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.460
 stories at the time being already a doctor all 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.400
 we studied 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:58.200
 cultural history from the turn of the century at 

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.710
 time has not yet been invented from ulf 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.620
 mide 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.260
 and antibiotics at the time inflammation 

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.570
 serum treated 

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:09.899
 gray and anti gray anti staphylococcus 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:12.630
 anti streptococci while medical 

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:15.080
 terrorism was a surplus of sulfur in 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.080
 in the body 

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:20.769
 I began to notice and suspect that this 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:23.890
 maybe I started studying statistics 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:25.120
 about this france at the highest level 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.489
 due to illness 

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.349
 and what disease do you say it when 

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:31.540
 man does not tolerate allergic 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.510
 food reaction or allergy to 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.519
 vaccinations people tolerated 

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:37.930
 anaphylactic shock and died and in 

00:02:36.519 --> 00:02:40.299
 They were mostly French 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:43.359
 I started looking for what is special about 

00:02:40.299 --> 00:02:46.120
 the french and guessed the french eat 

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.639
 horse meat at that time the french were mostly 

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.790
 ate horses then I began to guess 

00:02:48.639 --> 00:02:54.639
 that the vaccination that was used in it 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:57.700
 time in france is made from horse meat 

00:02:54.639 --> 00:03:02.049
 how to do it injecting man 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:04.389
 dose of staphylococcus bacteria certainly in 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:07.959
 a small dose of vaccine caused 

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:10.870
 slight inflammation lifting atropine 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:13.299
 while adding another dose of the same 

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.669
 vaccinations and one more to 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.340
 stabilize and to and coordinate 

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:20.250
 effect of vaccination to good 

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:23.440
 bacteria fought bad bacteria 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.720
 horses injected this vaccination through 

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.569
 some time pulled out with a syringe 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.540
 back and subsequently stuck in people 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:34.359
 so I thought that people who 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.760
 eat horse meat in humans 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:39.639
 allergic response manifested 

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.319
 reaction to horse vaccinations after 

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.439
 of this i realized that the same thing is happening 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:47.139
 and with pigs, too, with lamb and with 

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:50.470
 all other animals are human 

00:03:47.139 --> 00:03:53.560
 the body's reaction resists anyone 

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.409
 mind the meat of any animal but there are such 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.750
 antidotes but from such vaccinations that 

00:03:56.409 --> 00:04:01.540
 called against anti horse 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.810
 against a pork or burglar 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:08.470
 there are many of our human organisms 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:10.689
 common cells so bacteria of these animals 

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:13.359
 getting into our body starts to fight 

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:15.639
 with our bacteria for places in the body 

00:04:13.359 --> 00:04:17.709
 I began to look for evidence of this and 

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:21.419
 found evidence 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:25.150
 is that foreign bacteria 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:27.210
 animals being in humans with 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.880
 human age and 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:33.690
 father and multiply and already to retirement 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.910
 age they begin to remove specifically 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.949
 according to our health 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.650
 destroying our human organism on 

00:04:37.949 --> 00:04:43.280
 I remember what year you became a vegetarian 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:46.050
 in the sixties understand our body 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.780
 organize a response to others 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.060
 organisms within us and up to today 

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.620
 no day you eat no meat tell me 

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.419
 please give a little more detail about your 

00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:56.490
 vegetarianism of course from that time 

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:59.009
 how I became a vegetarian there were moments 

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:02.099
 when i was eating meat it used to be what i was 

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:04.169
 invited to events at weddings in those 

00:05:02.099 --> 00:05:06.720
 there was nothing for vegetarians 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:11.360
 they did not have to eat meat because they did not 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.360
 there were even fish that is they refused 

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:19.530

00:05:14.849 --> 00:05:21.630
