see<00:00:13.440> I've<00:00:13.709> decided<00:00:14.010> to<00:00:14.190> split<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.180> video<00:00:15.389> in

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
see I've decided to split the video in

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.349 
see I've decided to split the video in
two<00:00:15.809> so<00:00:16.080> you<00:00:16.109> got<00:00:16.500> one<00:00:16.949> third<00:00:17.220> person<00:00:17.820> and<00:00:18.119> one

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
two so you got one third person and one

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:21.440 
two so you got one third person and one
onboard<00:00:19.340> camera<00:00:20.340> for<00:00:21.000> those<00:00:21.120> of<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.330> that

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
want to watch that and I may do this in

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.000 
want to watch that and I may do this in
future<00:00:23.789> videos<00:00:24.090> I<00:00:24.720> haven't<00:00:25.200> quite<00:00:25.860> decided

trying to appeal to more people and I

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:41.239 
trying to appeal to more people and I

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:41.249 
know that loads of people prefer the

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:42.739 
know that loads of people prefer the
onboard<00:00:41.609> view<00:00:41.789> I<00:00:41.940> know<00:00:41.999> it's<00:00:42.179> not<00:00:42.269> the<00:00:42.329> helmet

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:42.749 
onboard view I know it's not the helmet

00:00:42.749 --> 00:00:46.700 
onboard view I know it's not the helmet
cam<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:44.359> unfortunately<00:00:45.530> can't<00:00:46.530> actually

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:51.800 
choose your helmet cam in the replay but

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.149 
choose your helmet cam in the replay but
the<00:00:52.800> onboard<00:00:53.219> is<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.510> pretty<00:00:54.719> good<00:00:54.809> but<00:00:55.739> I<00:00:55.769> do

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:56.159 
the onboard is so pretty good but I do

00:00:56.159 --> 00:00:58.569 
the onboard is so pretty good but I do
prefer<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:56.609> helmet<00:00:56.879> cam<00:00:57.030> maybe<00:00:57.299> I'll<00:00:57.479> do<00:00:57.690> a

00:00:58.569 --> 00:00:58.579 
prefer the helmet cam maybe I'll do a

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:02.419 
prefer the helmet cam maybe I'll do a
helmet<00:00:59.579> cam<00:00:59.789> video<00:01:00.710> Jesus<00:01:01.710> people<00:01:02.069> crashing

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
notice it in this video because this

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.209 
notice it in this video because this
video<00:01:19.049> is<00:01:19.259> before<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> update<00:01:19.950> but<00:01:20.909> am<00:01:22.130> it's<00:01:23.130> a

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
video is before the update but am it's a

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.039 
video is before the update but am it's a
little<00:01:23.340> bit<00:01:23.520> with<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.939> update<00:01:24.299> because<00:01:24.539> it's

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
little bit with the update because it's

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.569 
little bit with the update because it's
fixed<00:01:26.210> well<00:01:27.229> it's<00:01:28.229> meant<00:01:28.560> to<00:01:28.680> fix<00:01:29.039> the<00:01:29.340> world

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
fixed well it's meant to fix the world

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.990 
fixed well it's meant to fix the world
tool<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.390> corruption<00:01:30.750> and<00:01:31.820> various<00:01:32.820> other

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
tool that corruption and various other

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.560 
tool that corruption and various other
bugs<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:34.280> frame<00:01:35.280> rate<00:01:35.549> doesn't<00:01:35.880> seem<00:01:36.299> as<00:01:36.509> bad

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
bugs but frame rate doesn't seem as bad

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.300 
bugs but frame rate doesn't seem as bad
as<00:01:37.320> before<00:01:37.469> it's<00:01:37.890> still<00:01:38.189> pretty<00:01:39.200> bad<00:01:40.200> but<00:01:40.740> it's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
as before it's still pretty bad but it's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.749 
as before it's still pretty bad but it's
not<00:01:41.490> as<00:01:41.640> bad<00:01:42.119> as<00:01:42.179> what<00:01:42.509> it<00:01:42.630> was<00:01:42.899> so<00:01:43.500> it's<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.609> bit

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
not as bad as what it was so it's a bit

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:48.380 
not as bad as what it was so it's a bit
more<00:01:44.909> bearable<00:01:45.469> and

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
more bearable and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.930 
more bearable and
it<00:01:49.020> doesn't<00:01:49.610> gel<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.940> much<00:01:51.270> but<00:01:51.659> also<00:01:52.940> the

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:53.940 
it doesn't gel as much but also the

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:57.740 
it doesn't gel as much but also the
crackling<00:01:54.450> sound<00:01:54.750> as<00:01:54.900> well<00:01:55.140> is<00:01:56.479> it's<00:01:57.479> weird

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
crackling sound as well is it's weird

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.080 
crackling sound as well is it's weird
how<00:01:57.930> that's<00:01:58.440> working<00:01:58.770> because<00:01:59.220> if<00:01:59.700> you<00:01:59.909> do<00:02:00.060> a

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
how that's working because if you do a

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.880 
how that's working because if you do a
race<00:02:00.330> for<00:02:00.540> the<00:02:00.600> first<00:02:00.869> time<00:02:01.170> the<00:02:01.409> crackling

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
race for the first time the crackling

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:05.180 
race for the first time the crackling
sound<00:02:02.130> is<00:02:02.250> completely<00:02:02.820> gone<00:02:02.850> but<00:02:03.710> if<00:02:04.710> for

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
sound is completely gone but if for

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.400 
sound is completely gone but if for
whatever<00:02:05.310> reason<00:02:05.550> you<00:02:06.150> decide<00:02:06.780> to<00:02:06.900> restart

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:07.410 
whatever reason you decide to restart

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.310 
whatever reason you decide to restart
the<00:02:07.680> race<00:02:08.280> the<00:02:08.700> crackling<00:02:09.360> sound<00:02:09.660> comes<00:02:09.899> back

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:10.320 
the race the crackling sound comes back

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:13.280 
the race the crackling sound comes back
so<00:02:10.770> my<00:02:10.950> advice<00:02:11.070> would<00:02:11.280> be<00:02:11.520> don't<00:02:12.110> restart<00:02:13.110> the

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so my advice would be don't restart the

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:15.250 
so my advice would be don't restart the
race<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.770> do<00:02:13.920> one<00:02:14.160> time<00:02:14.459> and<00:02:14.640> one<00:02:14.760> time<00:02:14.820> only

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
race just do one time and one time only

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.550 
race just do one time and one time only
but<00:02:16.260> I<00:02:17.060> find<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.090> really<00:02:18.300> weird<00:02:18.600> how<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.290> can

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
but I find that really weird how it can

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.530 
but I find that really weird how it can
be<00:02:19.680> what<00:02:19.890> fine<00:02:20.250> one<00:02:20.760> minute<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.120> then<00:02:21.239> as<00:02:21.420> soon

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
be what fine one minute and then as soon

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.440 
be what fine one minute and then as soon
as<00:02:21.660> you<00:02:21.720> restart<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.590> race<00:02:22.739> it<00:02:23.209> comes<00:02:24.209> back

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
as you restart the race it comes back

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:28.490 
as you restart the race it comes back
again<00:02:24.510> but<00:02:26.239> other<00:02:27.239> than<00:02:27.480> that<00:02:27.600> you<00:02:28.019> know<00:02:28.080> it's

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:28.500 
again but other than that you know it's

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.390 
again but other than that you know it's
a<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:29.610> getting<00:02:30.060> there<00:02:30.860> hopefully<00:02:31.860> maybe<00:02:32.160> with

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:32.400 
a the getting there hopefully maybe with

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.240 
a the getting there hopefully maybe with
a<00:02:32.430> few<00:02:32.519> more<00:02:32.910> updates<00:02:33.360> they'll<00:02:33.570> be<00:02:33.720> able<00:02:33.870> to

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
a few more updates they'll be able to

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:37.100 
a few more updates they'll be able to
bring<00:02:35.250> the<00:02:35.400> frame<00:02:35.640> rate<00:02:35.880> back<00:02:36.480> up<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.840> where<00:02:36.870> it

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.110 
bring the frame rate back up to where it

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.740 
bring the frame rate back up to where it
should<00:02:37.140> be<00:02:37.380> and<00:02:38.209> crackling<00:02:39.209> sound<00:02:39.510> gone

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 
should be and crackling sound gone

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.530 
should be and crackling sound gone
completely<00:02:39.989> but<00:02:40.769> um<00:02:41.120> not<00:02:42.120> holding<00:02:42.420> my<00:02:42.510> breath

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
completely but um not holding my breath

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.960 
completely but um not holding my breath
at<00:02:42.900> the<00:02:42.989> moment<00:02:43.380> but<00:02:43.800> at<00:02:44.130> least<00:02:44.610> they've

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
at the moment but at least they've

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.870 
at the moment but at least they've
addressed<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.570> slightly<00:02:46.489> like<00:02:47.489> I<00:02:47.519> said<00:02:47.730> it's

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
addressed it slightly like I said it's

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.729 
addressed it slightly like I said it's
not<00:02:48.030> 100%<00:02:49.340> 30<00:02:50.340> frames<00:02:50.760> but<00:02:51.260> it's<00:02:52.260> definitely

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
not 100% 30 frames but it's definitely

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:56.120 
not 100% 30 frames but it's definitely
an<00:02:53.010> improvement<00:02:53.280> on<00:02:53.760> what<00:02:54.120> it<00:02:54.660> was<00:02:54.840> because<00:02:55.170> it

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.130 
an improvement on what it was because it

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.610 
an improvement on what it was because it
was<00:02:56.190> pretty<00:02:56.549> difficult<00:02:56.910> to<00:02:57.329> play<00:02:57.570> with<00:02:58.470> the

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
was pretty difficult to play with the

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:02.380 
was pretty difficult to play with the
framerate<00:02:59.040> issues<00:02:59.370> because<00:03:00.680> it<00:03:01.680> just<00:03:01.860> felt

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:02.390 
framerate issues because it just felt

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:06.920 
framerate issues because it just felt
really<00:03:03.390> bad<00:03:04.850> especially<00:03:05.850> online<00:03:06.269> as<00:03:06.690> though

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
really bad especially online as though

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.850 
really bad especially online as though
if<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:07.890> got<00:03:08.040> 12<00:03:08.340> people<00:03:08.519> in<00:03:08.820> the<00:03:08.910> lobby<00:03:09.120> then

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 
if you got 12 people in the lobby then

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.390 
if you got 12 people in the lobby then
yeah<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:11.340> was<00:03:11.519> just<00:03:11.640> really<00:03:12.000> bad<00:03:12.030> I<00:03:13.190> know<00:03:14.190> that

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
yeah it was just really bad I know that

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.920 
yeah it was just really bad I know that
online<00:03:14.579> now<00:03:15.030> is<00:03:15.239> a<00:03:15.269> bit<00:03:15.600> more<00:03:15.780> stable<00:03:16.140> and<00:03:17.930> of

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
online now is a bit more stable and of

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.319 
online now is a bit more stable and of
six<00:03:19.380> people<00:03:19.560> anyway<00:03:20.070> it's<00:03:20.400> a<00:03:20.549> lot<00:03:20.700> more<00:03:20.730> stable

00:03:21.319 --> 00:03:21.329 
six people anyway it's a lot more stable

00:03:21.329 --> 00:03:22.990 
six people anyway it's a lot more stable
than<00:03:21.360> what<00:03:21.600> it<00:03:21.720> was<00:03:21.750> I'm<00:03:22.380> not<00:03:22.560> sure<00:03:22.620> about

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:23.000 
than what it was I'm not sure about

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.240 
than what it was I'm not sure about
completely<00:03:24.000> a<00:03:24.079> complete<00:03:25.079> lobby<00:03:25.350> of<00:03:25.680> 12<00:03:26.070> people

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
completely a complete lobby of 12 people

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.699 
completely a complete lobby of 12 people
in<00:03:26.519> a<00:03:26.670> band<00:03:26.910> had<00:03:27.810> the<00:03:27.959> pleasure<00:03:28.140> of<00:03:28.320> doing<00:03:28.500> that

00:03:28.699 --> 00:03:28.709 
in a band had the pleasure of doing that

00:03:28.709 --> 00:03:30.910 
in a band had the pleasure of doing that
yet<00:03:29.040> and

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:30.920 
yet and

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.440 
yet and
but<00:03:31.920> milestone<00:03:32.370> really<00:03:32.730> need<00:03:32.880> to<00:03:32.970> bring<00:03:33.210> back

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
but milestone really need to bring back

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.190 
but milestone really need to bring back
the<00:03:33.810> collisions<00:03:34.500> off<00:03:34.850> for<00:03:35.850> the<00:03:35.970> for<00:03:36.840> online

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:37.200 
the collisions off for the for online

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
the collisions off for the for online
because<00:03:37.650> it's<00:03:38.120> such<00:03:39.120> a<00:03:39.150> pain<00:03:39.420> in<00:03:39.600> the<00:03:39.630> ass

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:40.220 
because it's such a pain in the ass

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:45.199 
because it's such a pain in the ass
trying<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:42.770> to<00:03:43.770> race<00:03:43.980> online<00:03:44.220> and<00:03:44.760> then<00:03:44.880> you

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
trying to to race online and then you

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.660 
trying to to race online and then you
just<00:03:45.390> get<00:03:45.660> absolute<00:03:46.590> Bell<00:03:46.980> ends<00:03:47.190> online

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:47.670 
just get absolute Bell ends online

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.840 
just get absolute Bell ends online
they're<00:03:47.850> just<00:03:48.060> try<00:03:48.270> and<00:03:48.330> crash<00:03:48.570> into<00:03:48.750> you<00:03:49.080> and

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:49.850 
they're just try and crash into you and

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.780 
they're just try and crash into you and
ruin<00:03:50.850> your<00:03:51.000> race<00:03:51.150> but<00:03:51.690> other<00:03:52.410> than<00:03:52.590> that<00:03:52.790> so

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
ruin your race but other than that so

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.390 
ruin your race but other than that so
good<00:03:54.060> hopefully<00:03:54.270> they<00:03:54.540> they'll<00:03:55.400> include

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
good hopefully they they'll include

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:03.560 
good hopefully they they'll include
collisions<00:03:57.090> off<00:03:57.270> in<00:03:58.370> mo<00:03:59.370> GP<00:03:59.700> 15<00:04:00.180> but<00:04:02.090> yeah<00:04:03.090> not

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
collisions off in mo GP 15 but yeah not

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.550 
collisions off in mo GP 15 but yeah not
a<00:04:03.600> win<00:04:03.870> see<00:04:04.140> when<00:04:04.770> that<00:04:04.920> comes<00:04:05.160> out<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:07.410> my

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560 
a win see when that comes out and my

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:11.120 
a win see when that comes out and my
battery<00:04:07.800> is<00:04:08.160> running<00:04:08.580> low<00:04:08.760> so<00:04:10.100> hopefully<00:04:11.100> I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
battery is running low so hopefully I

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:12.560 
battery is running low so hopefully I
can<00:04:11.190> finish<00:04:11.400> this<00:04:11.700> race<00:04:11.910> before<00:04:12.180> my<00:04:12.420> battery

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
can finish this race before my battery

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:19.490 
can finish this race before my battery
runs<00:04:12.989> out<00:04:13.200> but<00:04:13.530> we'll<00:04:13.680> see

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.230 

not<00:04:20.500> doing<00:04:20.710> too<00:04:20.890> bad<00:04:21.100> it<00:04:21.250> they<00:04:21.430> went<00:04:21.610> well<00:04:21.760> did
