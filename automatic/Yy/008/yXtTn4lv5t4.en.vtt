00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:29.070 
manuals it's a lengthy process to

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:31.880 
manuals it's a lengthy process to
unbuckle<00:04:30.030> buckles<00:04:30.630> and<00:04:30.840> pull<00:04:31.080> these<00:04:31.500> threads

out and strings and all sorts of stuff
that<00:04:35.420> well<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.450> think<00:04:36.540> it's<00:04:36.810> cool<00:04:37.080> they

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:37.260 
that well I think it's cool they

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.600 
that well I think it's cool they
included<00:04:37.650> it<00:04:37.770> it's<00:04:37.920> not<00:04:38.250> worth<00:04:38.430> the<00:04:38.490> effort

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
included it it's not worth the effort

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:40.610 
included it it's not worth the effort
for<00:04:39.000> me<00:04:39.090> so<00:04:39.300> maybe<00:04:39.630> you<00:04:39.810> can<00:04:39.960> find<00:04:40.350> some<00:04:40.530> other

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:40.620 
for me so maybe you can find some other

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:42.590 
for me so maybe you can find some other
review<00:04:40.980> that<00:04:41.160> covers<00:04:41.640> that<00:04:41.820> I<00:04:42.030> was<00:04:42.360> a<00:04:42.390> little

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
review that covers that I was a little

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:44.690 
review that covers that I was a little
nervous<00:04:42.720> about<00:04:42.900> the<00:04:43.170> arms<00:04:43.470> because<00:04:44.010> if<00:04:44.400> you're

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
nervous about the arms because if you're

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:46.430 
nervous about the arms because if you're
going<00:04:44.790> to<00:04:44.880> do<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.060> full<00:04:45.330> TrueType<00:04:45.840> figure<00:04:46.230> then

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
going to do a full TrueType figure then

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:48.380 
going to do a full TrueType figure then
it's<00:04:46.590> going<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.800> look<00:04:46.980> really<00:04:47.360> plasticky<00:04:48.360> and

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
it's going to look really plasticky and

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.000 
it's going to look really plasticky and
figuri<00:04:48.810> so<00:04:49.080> I'm<00:04:49.230> glad<00:04:49.380> that<00:04:49.470> they<00:04:49.650> did<00:04:49.920> the

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
figuri so I'm glad that they did the

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:52.100 
figuri so I'm glad that they did the
sculpted<00:04:50.430> arms<00:04:50.580> it's<00:04:50.880> the<00:04:51.240> right<00:04:51.450> mix<00:04:51.780> between

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
sculpted arms it's the right mix between

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.010

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.930 
like limited articulation and good
sculpting<00:04:55.530> and<00:04:56.250> it<00:04:56.370> gives<00:04:56.550> you<00:04:56.670> kind<00:04:56.790> of<00:04:56.880> the

00:04:56.930 --> 00:04:56.940 
sculpting and it gives you kind of the

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.770 
sculpting and it gives you kind of the
best<00:04:57.150> of<00:04:57.270> both<00:04:57.360> worlds
