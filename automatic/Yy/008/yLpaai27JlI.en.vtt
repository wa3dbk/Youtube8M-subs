is dripping out there right now not very
fast<00:00:10.040> I'm<00:00:11.040> hoping<00:00:11.190> as<00:00:11.429> it<00:00:11.550> warmed<00:00:11.790> up<00:00:11.940> it'll<00:00:12.120> go

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
fast I'm hoping as it warmed up it'll go

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.480 
fast I'm hoping as it warmed up it'll go
a<00:00:12.300> lot<00:00:12.450> faster<00:00:12.690> but<00:00:13.650> still<00:00:13.860> this<00:00:14.040> is<00:00:14.099> just<00:00:14.340> one

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
a lot faster but still this is just one

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:16.400

base to it I don't know how clean my
bandana<00:00:31.320> is<00:00:31.590> though<00:00:32.570> we'll<00:00:33.570> find<00:00:33.870> out<00:00:34.079> I<00:00:34.489> mean

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
bandana is though we'll find out I mean

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.090 
bandana is though we'll find out I mean
that'll<00:00:35.910> be<00:00:36.000> good<00:00:36.210> drinkable<00:00:36.719> water<00:00:36.840> for<00:00:37.110> sure

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:42.100 

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.500 

I've<00:00:42.550> just<00:00:42.730> been<00:00:42.879> sitting<00:00:43.210> here<00:00:43.329> for<00:00:43.480> about

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:43.510 
I've just been sitting here for about

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.349 
I've just been sitting here for about
all<00:00:43.809> three<00:00:44.050> minutes<00:00:44.410> watching<00:00:44.590> this<00:00:44.890> and

00:00:45.349 --> 00:00:45.359 
all three minutes watching this and

00:00:45.359 --> 00:00:48.840 
all three minutes watching this and
sometimes<00:00:46.359> when<00:00:46.570> a<00:00:46.600> breeze<00:00:46.930> kicks<00:00:47.289> up<00:00:47.850> this

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:48.850 
sometimes when a breeze kicks up this

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.939 
sometimes when a breeze kicks up this
will<00:00:49.089> start<00:00:49.329> swinging<00:00:49.870> and<00:00:50.050> then<00:00:50.800> I'll<00:00:50.920> start

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:50.949 
will start swinging and then I'll start

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.799 
will start swinging and then I'll start
dripping<00:00:51.399> down<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.789> sides<00:00:52.059> of<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.480> water

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:52.809 
dripping down the sides of the water

00:00:52.809 --> 00:00:55.170 
dripping down the sides of the water
bottle<00:00:53.079> so<00:00:53.680> I'm<00:00:53.769> not<00:00:53.890> collecting<00:00:54.460> some<00:00:55.030> of<00:00:55.089> the

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.180 
bottle so I'm not collecting some of the

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:56.939 
bottle so I'm not collecting some of the
water<00:00:55.329> that<00:00:55.420> I<00:00:55.570> could<00:00:55.809> be<00:00:55.930> otherwise<00:00:56.260> so<00:00:56.920> I

00:00:56.939 --> 00:00:56.949 
water that I could be otherwise so I

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:58.920 
water that I could be otherwise so I
think<00:00:57.039> what<00:00:57.339> I<00:00:57.370> might<00:00:57.430> do<00:00:57.789> is<00:00:58.059> just<00:00:58.570> cut<00:00:58.780> the

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
think what I might do is just cut the

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.959 
think what I might do is just cut the
top<00:00:59.140> of<00:00:59.320> this<00:00:59.409> bottle<00:00:59.680> off<00:00:59.979> so<00:01:00.640> it's<00:01:00.790> got<00:01:00.940> a

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
top of this bottle off so it's got a

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:03.029 
top of this bottle off so it's got a
wider<00:01:01.239> mouth<00:01:01.600> and<00:01:01.989> therefore<00:01:02.440> easier<00:01:02.649> to

00:01:03.029 --> 00:01:03.039 
wider mouth and therefore easier to

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.580 
wider mouth and therefore easier to
catch<00:01:03.760> the<00:01:03.909> water<00:01:04.089> even<00:01:04.449> if<00:01:04.600> even<00:01:04.809> if<00:01:05.199> this<00:01:05.409> is

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:05.590 
catch the water even if even if this is

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.730 
catch the water even if even if this is
swinging<00:01:06.340> around<00:01:06.490> a<00:01:06.610> little<00:01:06.700> bit<00:01:07.740> chicken

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:08.740 
swinging around a little bit chicken

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.529 
swinging around a little bit chicken
back<00:01:08.920> in<00:01:08.950> on<00:01:09.280> this<00:01:09.460> it's<00:01:09.729> been<00:01:09.909> about<00:01:10.119> oh<00:01:10.330> I

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:10.539 
back in on this it's been about oh I

00:01:10.539 --> 00:01:13.590 
back in on this it's been about oh I
don't<00:01:10.780> know<00:01:10.869> 45<00:01:11.380> minutes<00:01:11.740> and<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:13.090> can<00:01:13.270> see

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:13.600 
don't know 45 minutes and you can see

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:17.550 
don't know 45 minutes and you can see
how<00:01:13.920> much<00:01:14.920> water<00:01:15.340> I<00:01:15.460> got<00:01:15.670> there<00:01:16.020> not<00:01:17.020> bad<00:01:17.259> for

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
how much water I got there not bad for

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.980 
how much water I got there not bad for
not<00:01:18.369> you<00:01:18.759> know<00:01:18.880> setting<00:01:19.390> it<00:01:19.450> up<00:01:19.539> and<00:01:19.750> then<00:01:19.840> walk

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
not you know setting it up and then walk

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.350 
not you know setting it up and then walk
it<00:01:20.140> off<00:01:20.229> and<00:01:20.409> not<00:01:20.500> messing<00:01:21.039> with<00:01:21.069> it<00:01:21.369> you<00:01:22.300> can

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
it off and not messing with it you can

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.450 
it off and not messing with it you can
see<00:01:22.600> it<00:01:22.720> has<00:01:22.750> slowed<00:01:23.590> down<00:01:23.770> a<00:01:23.830> little<00:01:23.979> bit<00:01:24.190> is

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:24.460 
see it has slowed down a little bit is

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.300 
see it has slowed down a little bit is
it's<00:01:24.700> seven<00:01:25.509> o'clock<00:01:25.600> at<00:01:25.960> night<00:01:26.310> shades

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.310

coming<00:01:27.729> down<00:01:27.850> a<00:01:27.880> little<00:01:28.090> bit<00:01:28.240> more<00:01:28.450> and<00:01:28.659> it's

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
coming down a little bit more and it's

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:32.820 
coming down a little bit more and it's
certainly<00:01:29.470> cooling<00:01:29.979> off<00:01:30.159> so<00:01:31.140> soon<00:01:32.140> I'm<00:01:32.440> sure

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:32.830 
certainly cooling off so soon I'm sure

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.460 
certainly cooling off so soon I'm sure
that<00:01:33.009> will<00:01:33.159> stop<00:01:33.429> and<00:01:33.960> once<00:01:34.960> I<00:01:35.080> get<00:01:35.200> a<00:01:35.229> fire

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
that will stop and once I get a fire

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.020 
that will stop and once I get a fire
going<00:01:35.740> I'll<00:01:35.979> place<00:01:36.340> this<00:01:36.580> kind<00:01:36.819> of<00:01:36.850> by<00:01:36.970> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
going I'll place this kind of by the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.210 
going I'll place this kind of by the
fire<00:01:37.270> so<00:01:37.539> the<00:01:37.750> bandana<00:01:38.679> can<00:01:38.920> get<00:01:39.069> some

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:39.220 
fire so the bandana can get some

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:41.070 
fire so the bandana can get some
residual<00:01:39.640> heat<00:01:39.940> and<00:01:40.209> we'll<00:01:40.750> start<00:01:40.990> the

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:41.080 
residual heat and we'll start the

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:44.010 
residual heat and we'll start the
process<00:01:41.259> again<00:01:42.299> but<00:01:43.299> first<00:01:43.569> i'm<00:01:43.750> going<00:01:43.840> to<00:01:43.929> try
