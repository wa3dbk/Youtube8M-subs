00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:15.750
 Boys here is top again I want 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.550
 Welcome by another subscriber 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.750
 gave the beginning to represent 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.640
 at least in something quieter 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:25.070
 because the gameplay is so faster 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.300
 plays that when I talk slowly like 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:28.380
 I do not come to the point at all 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.950
 and then the gameplay would be already 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.040
 over 

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:35.550
 We definitely see stones here 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:38.160
 free is the name of the good and thus linen 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.989
 Go on for the rest of the settings on it 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.420
 asked me all the time and that 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.280
 search and destroy on express with the 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.110
 vector fast drag and city magazines 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:48.930
 perks nimble hands toughness and 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:51.570
 had fluency and as a reward 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.870
 while the drone hunter killer and 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.970
 the stocks link to the channel for 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 As always, subscribers are down in the 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.990
 description 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.510
 and first of all , I wanted to go 

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:08.220

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.310
 whether you like her or something 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:13.560
 something about me so far on the channel 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.259
 So you missed yes something was 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:17.819
 I would like to talk from your point of view 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:20.880
 where my opinion may know 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.770
 I want what I think of something then 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.509
 Today is the day of the day again you 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.420
 you can see below in the comments 

00:01:23.509 --> 00:01:30.060
 write down which topic which thing 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.579
 I want to discuss and the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:35.310
 tribespeople who will know that 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.780
 I value all the strongest then 

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.179
 Suggestions of that really at 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.490
 Post a facebook and then you can vote 

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.520
 and yes have to see what the 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.829
 That's the way it is and that's it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.929
 really come spectators then will 

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:50.429
 I since most of these issues by 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:53.329
 you come and then really many 

00:01:50.429 --> 00:01:55.829
 people will be desired then I will 

00:01:53.329 --> 00:01:57.779
 make tools and I ask at the place 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:59.729
 ever here to apologize that it 

00:01:57.779 --> 00:02:01.409
 there is no licking at all 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.850
 I was still the player I found 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.979
 the gameplay anyway so good that me 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.479
 I said I'll be the gameplay 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.050
 Nevertheless nobody can take something there 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.400
 i do if any youtubers 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.840
 So do not write any 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.760
 but I bet that's how I do that 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.040
 that already 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.920
 who would be fit to which topic 

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:22.800
 then be an interesting tool 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:26.720
 and then the whole thing stops in the 

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:29.430
 next weeks or years 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:33.410
 to be heard here on this canal 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:35.920
 No last weeks so at least 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:40.190
 until all the topics were there 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:43.220
 at least month and now no fear 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.220
 I still have enough topics 

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:49.100
 but I'm gonna do it all here 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.290
 the reason that I always do so 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:53.810
 I want to get involved with a bit 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.490
 can see how they take their interests 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:58.910
 you can be here a little bit 

00:02:55.490 --> 00:03:02.510
 channel with a decision to participate 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.450
 and that's what I like about youtube 

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:07.760
 I like it so much 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.680
 Community thing is and also one 

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.900
 good community thing even if many 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:12.680
 People always say the community is for 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:15.470
 rubbish 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.390
 this is not in our eyes and us 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 Here I would just say so 

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:20.990
 a good example of how it works 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:23.720
 youtube should expire if it does 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:26.330
 has also noses worth eg run 

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.230
 is wonderful to see with which 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:32.390
 irony you the greeted on the channel and 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:34.610
 not on the same track there 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:37.280
 wanted to return something but 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.980
 somehow makes clear that you 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.970
 do not mind this garbage but 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.970
 stop in a really sympathetic and 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:49.850
 funny way and as soon as I am 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.770
 then back here when the nation starts 

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:53.810
 blocked yes at this point you want 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:55.310
 the gameplay is why he here to 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:57.170
 controller threw away or something 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.540
 I still do not know it comes up 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.910
 a place where I personally 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:05.900
 in search and destroy the panels 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:09.080
 get nothing bad but the 

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:12.230
 shotgun shooting me in the back 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.910
 and I zero chance to come on anyway 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:16.459
 me always that way if in the other team 

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.030
 one with the shotgun i play case like that 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:19.970
 Forum 

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:23.330
 no matter which stuttgart no matter which 

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:26.720
 distance she is at a deep so 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:30.919
 against totti always deadly but no matter 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:35.030
 no yes i hope for the end for this 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:38.900
 comment this short for me if I am 

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:44.660
 am correctly informed could tomorrow 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:46.470
 ninth part of total escalation and 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.540
 I can always say 

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:54.390
 the new detail has been the 

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:59.160
 the most difficult with distance have similar 

00:04:54.390 --> 00:05:01.980
 long for used but more publishers 

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:05.460
 I would have to wait until tomorrow only 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:06.450
 if you know every day at 7 o'clock 

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.850
 new video 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.190
 So if you are a topic of mine 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.190
 it wants to be addressed today 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.540
 and in the comments purely and we 

00:05:14.190 --> 00:05:19.290
 see what happens 

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:22.410
 I'm out of the number here, say it 

00:05:19.290 --> 00:05:25.190
 as always moin moin and I hope you 

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:25.190
 sees himself again
