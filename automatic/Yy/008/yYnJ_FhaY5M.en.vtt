00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
he's I think that sort of ping-pong

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.259 
he's I think that sort of ping-pong
match<00:02:31.379> at<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.680> beginning<00:02:32.069> is<00:02:32.519> not<00:02:32.819> his<00:02:32.970> forte

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
match at the beginning is not his forte

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.990 
match at the beginning is not his forte
he'll<00:02:33.810> still<00:02:34.019> be<00:02:34.110> doing<00:02:34.319> that<00:02:34.470> but<00:02:34.849> that's<00:02:35.849> not

00:02:35.990 --> 00:02:36.000 
he'll still be doing that but that's not

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.330 
he'll still be doing that but that's not
his<00:02:36.090> best<00:02:36.209> work<00:02:36.510> DC's<00:02:37.200> got<00:02:37.230> such<00:02:37.829> a<00:02:37.860> knowledge
