dark but you can barely see not much of
it

00:01:15.709 --> 00:01:15.719 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:33.090 

watch<00:01:16.289> it<00:01:16.469> open<00:01:16.710> the<00:01:16.799> garage<00:01:16.890> door<00:01:17.070> though

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.100 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:35.969 

Horton's<00:01:33.909> not<00:01:34.119> working<00:01:34.540> again<00:01:35.140> does<00:01:35.740> that

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:35.979

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.389 

I<00:01:43.490> think<00:01:45.610> it's<00:01:46.610> very<00:01:46.820> cold<00:01:47.150> nature

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399
