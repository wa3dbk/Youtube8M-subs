 Solomon and his kinship with King Pharaoh 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.330
 from Egypt, he took Pharaoh's daughter and 

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:11.459
 He brought her to the city ​​of David in the meantime 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:13.559
 that he had just built his house and the 

00:00:11.459 --> 00:00:16.350
 house of jehovah and the walls of jerusalem 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.780
 around until then the town 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.910

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.850
 there was no house built to the name of 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.100
 jehová until those times more 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.650
 Solomon loved Jehovah walking in the 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.540
 statutes of his father david only 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:33.420
 sacrificed and burned incense in the 

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:35.610
 high places that the king would go 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:38.579
 because that in the main high place 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.640
 and sacrificed there a thousand holocaust 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.800
 sacrificed Solomon on that altar and 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.010
 the LORD appeared unto Solomon in Gabon 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.739
 one night in dreams and told him god asks 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:52.290
 whatever you want me to give you and Solomon 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:54.510
 He said you did great mercy to you 

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:57.570

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.239
 before you in truth in justice and 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.920
 with righteousness of heart for you and 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.439
 you have reserved him is your great 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.690
 mercy in which you gave him a son who 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.680
 sit on your throne as it happens in this 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.140
 day 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.240
 now you can jehovah my god you have made me 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:15.120

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.910
 from the vine my father and I am young and not 

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:19.410
 I know how to enter or leave and your servant is 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:22.170
 in the middle of your town to which you 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.350
 you chose a large town that does not 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.479
 can count or number by his crowd 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:29.610
 Give your servant a good heart 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.610

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.899
 I asked this and God told him why did you 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.479
 sued this and you did not ask for yourself 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:48.270
 many days you asked me for riches 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.130
