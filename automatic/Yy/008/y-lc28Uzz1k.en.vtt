00:00:01.639 --> 00:00:06.870
 the bus on 7 during peak hours 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.519
 travel free and the blitz emerged 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.679
 anti Portuguese shot at dawn in 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.480
 station the first in big times 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:13.980
 influence with the help in the graphics and 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.710
 that budget that rewrites the phenomenon 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:20.510
 of the Portuguese in Verona 29 buses 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:23.310
 verified 730 passengers checked 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:24.900
 107 without a ticket or pass 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.269
 a number that is considerably higher 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.099
 compared to what recorded in 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.390
 previous summer checks that 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:31.679
 means that in the hours of major 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.170
 influx of passengers 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.450
 the evasion rate increases to 14 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.430
 percent with lost revenue for 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.680
 the Verona public transport company 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.640
 with these data of 3 million euros 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.010
 per year 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.350
 this is particularly the data of this morning 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.700
 alarming goes against the trend compared to 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.199
 all the data we have registered 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:54.690
 so far and this requires a clear choice 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:57.690
 that the company will decide I already think of 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.719
 today to greatly enhance 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.870
 consistent checks also in 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.240
 province and it is important that users 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:08.520
 they understand that maybe a few moments 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.080
 minute delay due to the effect of 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.479
 checks and therefore not due to the effect of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.189
 service can generate a better one 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.689
 service for all that the budget 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.640
 it would have been heavier it was 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.200
 already understood this morning during the 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.360
 checks followed minute by minute 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.950
 alderman courses because if it is true that 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.600
 there is who the subscription showed it 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.340
 also with satisfaction 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.080
 others have tried all the 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:29.579
 excuses possible to justify the 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.710
 lack of ticket and there is also who 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:33.540
 among the general exaltation to avoid 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.369
 the fine is even thrown out 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.729
 from a window he risked getting himself 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:37.729
 very bad 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.110
 the blitz was triggered this morning at 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.510
 six thirty here in the station have 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:50.080
 operated a dozen controllers of the 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.470
 tv with the municipal police and others 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:55.210
 agents and civis in two hours are 

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:59.320
 about one hundred were surveyed 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:00.970
 verbal only on one arrival post 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.570
 bus track but the phenomenon is 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:06.850
 certainly heavy is therefore what 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:10.180
 as an administration we will ask for a tv is 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.100
 a detailed plan is certain because i 

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:14.860
 checks are actually made 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:16.630
 because if everyone actually pays the 

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.590
 service can be improved for everyone 

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.940
 the citizens 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.860
 here there were many students of course 

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.710
 This morning at this time is now 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:26.050
 in the last half hour yes but they are 

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:27.550
 here arrived six and a half there were 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:29.050
 lots of people taking the 

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:30.940
 train to go to work even 

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.900
 maybe some stowaway we have 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:34.510
 found 

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.600
 so as I repeat the company must 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:39.390
 commit to making checks 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.960
 ongoing to ensure 

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:43.750
 the administration but the same 

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:48.130
 citizenship that effectively all 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:49.900
 pay the 23 and the 24 73 the lines that 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.720
 they come from the holy lucia and golosine the 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.910
 41 from cadidavid the most risky runs 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:56.980
 Portuguese mentions the other hot areas 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.170
 bring palio where the buses arrive 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.640
 from the lake the junction of san massimo e 

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.890
 still lines coming from the east and 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:07.020
 from low to sample will be 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:07.020
 check them all without warning
