two bananas and another way to open them
is<00:00:43.800> by<00:00:45.019> squeezing<00:00:46.019> this<00:00:46.319> right<00:00:46.499> here<00:00:46.679> it's<00:00:46.800> a

00:00:46.849 --> 00:00:46.859 
is by squeezing this right here it's a

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.709 
is by squeezing this right here it's a
really<00:00:47.039> cool<00:00:47.280> trick<00:00:47.519> and<00:00:48.210> then<00:00:48.420> you<00:00:48.539> could

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
really cool trick and then you could

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.619 
really cool trick and then you could
peel<00:00:48.899> it<00:00:49.050> open<00:00:49.139> like<00:00:49.530> this<00:00:50.269> one<00:00:51.269> thought<00:00:51.449> this

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
peel it open like this one thought this

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.069 
peel it open like this one thought this
was<00:00:51.780> really<00:00:51.960> cool<00:00:53.269> so<00:00:54.269> if<00:00:54.359> you<00:00:54.479> can't<00:00:54.690> open<00:00:55.019> it

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
was really cool so if you can't open it

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.399 
was really cool so if you can't open it
the<00:00:55.199> other<00:00:55.350> way<00:00:55.499> just<00:00:55.769> open<00:00:56.190> it<00:00:56.280> the<00:00:56.460> easy<00:00:56.789> way

00:00:57.399 --> 00:00:57.409

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
then a faster way of cutting it as

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.120 
then a faster way of cutting it as

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
cutting it in half and then cutting them

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:15.069 
cutting it in half and then cutting them
like<00:01:08.789> this<00:01:10.700> so<00:01:11.700> cut<00:01:12.000> two<00:01:12.810> bananas<00:01:13.439> right<00:01:13.619> now

and yeah to chop your bananas you could

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.440 
and yeah to chop your bananas you could
put<00:01:19.229> them<00:01:19.439> in<00:01:19.500> some<00:01:19.829> foil<00:01:20.189> or<00:01:20.640> container<00:01:21.210> and

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.020 

I<00:01:31.010> should<00:01:32.010> have<00:01:32.100> probably<00:01:32.220> make<00:01:32.550> the<00:01:32.700> photo<00:01:32.910> a

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
I should have probably make the photo a

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:40.850 
I should have probably make the photo a
little<00:01:33.390> bit<00:01:33.510> longer<00:01:39.110> then<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.260> just<00:01:40.470> pop<00:01:40.650> them
