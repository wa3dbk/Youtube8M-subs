00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
garden my brother builds a lot of hog

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.260 
garden my brother builds a lot of hog
traps<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.070> deer<00:00:17.250> lease<00:00:17.490> and<00:00:17.789> he<00:00:17.880> had<00:00:18.060> some

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
traps for the deer lease and he had some

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.040 
traps for the deer lease and he had some
extra<00:00:18.800> hog<00:00:19.800> wire<00:00:20.130> and<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:21.510> bunch<00:00:21.750> of<00:00:21.869> extra

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
extra hog wire and a bunch of extra

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.109 
extra hog wire and a bunch of extra
lumber<00:00:22.920> that<00:00:23.400> he<00:00:23.490> had<00:00:23.640> just<00:00:23.789> laying<00:00:24.029> around

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
lumber that he had just laying around

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.170 
lumber that he had just laying around
his<00:00:24.330> yard<00:00:24.359> so<00:00:24.990> he<00:00:25.890> wanted<00:00:26.189> it<00:00:26.310> gone<00:00:26.340> and<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
his yard so he wanted it gone and I

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:30.130 
his yard so he wanted it gone and I
figured<00:00:27.779> I<00:00:27.840> could<00:00:27.990> put<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.199> to<00:00:28.289> good<00:00:28.320> use<00:00:28.470> so<00:00:28.980> I

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:30.140 
figured I could put it to good use so I

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:36.290 
figured I could put it to good use so I
built<00:00:31.140> a<00:00:31.969> crude<00:00:32.969> fence<00:00:33.510> around<00:00:34.140> it<00:00:34.350> I<00:00:35.120> was<00:00:36.120> kind

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:36.300 
built a crude fence around it I was kind

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.639 
built a crude fence around it I was kind
of<00:00:36.420> limited<00:00:36.780> to<00:00:36.809> the<00:00:37.020> way<00:00:37.140> I<00:00:37.170> could<00:00:37.410> work

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649 
of limited to the way I could work

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:39.770 
of limited to the way I could work
because<00:00:38.070> the<00:00:38.219> garden<00:00:38.520> was<00:00:38.700> already<00:00:39.059> going<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
because the garden was already going so

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.690 
because the garden was already going so
I<00:00:39.840> couldn't<00:00:40.530> really<00:00:40.710> walk<00:00:41.160> back<00:00:41.460> and<00:00:41.640> forth

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
I couldn't really walk back and forth

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.660 
I couldn't really walk back and forth
through<00:00:42.180> it<00:00:42.329> trying<00:00:42.629> to<00:00:42.750> build<00:00:43.710> a<00:00:43.829> fence<00:00:44.070> I'll

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
through it trying to build a fence I'll

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.910 
through it trying to build a fence I'll
already<00:00:45.480> do<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.079> have<00:00:46.200> it<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.500> little<00:00:46.800> bit

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
already do it and have it a little bit

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.900 
already do it and have it a little bit
better<00:00:47.160> next<00:00:47.460> year<00:00:48.200> but<00:00:50.629> figured<00:00:52.640> this<00:00:53.640> would

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
better next year but figured this would

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.520 
better next year but figured this would
do<00:00:54.059> what<00:00:54.239> I<00:00:54.270> needed<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:54.719> to<00:00:54.840> do<00:00:54.989> as<00:00:55.199> far<00:00:55.410> as

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
do what I needed it to do as far as

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.220 
do what I needed it to do as far as
keeping<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> rabbits<00:00:56.850> and<00:00:58.730> rodents<00:00:59.730> and

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
keeping the rabbits and rodents and

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.240 
keeping the rabbits and rodents and
everything<00:01:01.230> else<00:01:01.440> out<00:01:01.680> of<00:01:01.710> it<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.219> put<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> little

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
everything else out of it I put a little

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:10.820 
everything else out of it I put a little
simple<00:01:05.250> gate<00:01:05.489> on<00:01:05.729> it<00:01:07.220> but<00:01:09.080> as<00:01:10.080> you<00:01:10.350> can<00:01:10.470> see<00:01:10.530> the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
simple gate on it but as you can see the

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.200 
simple gate on it but as you can see the
garden<00:01:11.040> still<00:01:11.430> flourishing<00:01:13.340> I<00:01:14.340> mean<00:01:15.060> those

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
garden still flourishing I mean those

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.600 
garden still flourishing I mean those
tomato<00:01:15.570> plants<00:01:15.930> are<00:01:16.049> getting<00:01:16.140> huge<00:01:16.650> they're

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
tomato plants are getting huge they're

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.370 
tomato plants are getting huge they're
not<00:01:17.790> putting<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.210> as<00:01:18.420> many<00:01:18.570> tomatoes<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.259> I

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
not putting out as many tomatoes as I

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.830 
not putting out as many tomatoes as I
would<00:01:19.530> expect<00:01:19.650> but<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:20.820> plants<00:01:21.299> look

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
would expect but the plants look

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.700 
would expect but the plants look
beautiful<00:01:22.610> the<00:01:23.610> okra<00:01:24.060> is<00:01:24.200> doing<00:01:25.200> great<00:01:25.470> I'm

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
what four corn stalks so I don't expect

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:43.310

to<00:01:38.909> get<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.479> lot<00:01:40.350> of<00:01:40.439> ears<00:01:40.650> but<00:01:41.990> like<00:01:42.990> I've<00:01:43.140> said

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to get a lot of ears but like I've said

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.749 
to get a lot of ears but like I've said
in<00:01:43.439> my<00:01:43.470> other<00:01:43.560> videos<00:01:43.979> this<00:01:44.189> was<00:01:44.369> my<00:01:44.549> first

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759 
in my other videos this was my first

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.310 
in my other videos this was my first
attempt<00:01:45.210> at<00:01:45.270> gardening<00:01:45.720> so<00:01:45.840> I<00:01:45.869> didn't<00:01:46.079> want<00:01:46.229> to

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
attempt at gardening so I didn't want to

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.499 
attempt at gardening so I didn't want to
I<00:01:46.610> don't<00:01:47.610> want<00:01:47.729> to<00:01:47.880> overwhelm<00:01:48.090> myself<00:01:50.479> but<00:01:51.479> I

00:01:51.499 --> 00:01:51.509 
I don't want to overwhelm myself but I

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.870 
I don't want to overwhelm myself but I
built<00:01:51.689> all<00:01:51.869> that<00:01:51.930> for<00:01:52.290> free<00:01:52.729> and<00:01:55.700> what<00:01:56.700> he

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
built all that for free and what he

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.560 
built all that for free and what he
didn't<00:01:57.149> give<00:01:57.329> me<00:01:57.360> I<00:01:57.570> had<00:01:57.840> laying<00:01:58.049> around<00:01:58.200> here

00:01:59.560 --> 00:01:59.570 
didn't give me I had laying around here

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.819 
didn't give me I had laying around here
so<00:02:02.299> anyway<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.329> just<00:02:03.390> thought<00:02:03.630> I'd<00:02:03.869> share<00:02:04.770> it

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
so anyway I just thought I'd share it

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.760 
so anyway I just thought I'd share it
sure<00:02:05.579> what<00:02:05.790> you<00:02:05.909> can<00:02:06.030> do<00:02:06.240> with<00:02:06.509> free<00:02:07.200> materials

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
sure what you can do with free materials

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:10.520 
sure what you can do with free materials
if<00:02:07.920> you<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.239> the<00:02:09.420> motion<00:02:09.810> to<00:02:09.959> look

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
if you just take the motion to look

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.010 
if you just take the motion to look
around<00:02:10.770> for<00:02:11.099> them

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.020 
around for them

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:17.860 
around for them
take<00:02:12.440> a<00:02:12.470> few<00:02:12.650> minutes<00:02:12.920> of<00:02:13.010> your<00:02:13.100> time<00:02:16.720> so<00:02:17.720> this

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
take a few minutes of your time so this

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:26.440 
take a few minutes of your time so this
is<00:02:17.930> the<00:02:19.210> the<00:02:20.210> crude<00:02:21.880> rodent<00:02:23.380> fence<00:02:25.450> it's

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
is the the crude rodent fence it's

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:30.040 
is the the crude rodent fence it's
working<00:02:26.870> so<00:02:27.440> far<00:02:28.390> it's<00:02:29.390> not<00:02:29.540> going<00:02:29.690> to<00:02:29.750> keep<00:02:29.900> a

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
working so far it's not going to keep a

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.800 
working so far it's not going to keep a
squirrel<00:02:30.320> out<00:02:30.590> but<00:02:31.400> I<00:02:31.700> mean<00:02:32.030> if<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.510> squirrel

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:32.810 
squirrel out but I mean if a squirrel

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:38.100 
squirrel out but I mean if a squirrel
wants<00:02:32.960> in<00:02:33.260> he<00:02:33.650> can<00:02:33.880> he<00:02:34.880> can<00:02:35.030> jump<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.360> top<00:02:35.600> I
