00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
been the most pleasing thing so far for

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.090 
been the most pleasing thing so far for
me<00:00:54.660> I<00:00:54.690> think<00:00:54.840> it's<00:00:55.170> the<00:00:55.289> fact<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:55.890> many

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
me I think it's the fact that so many

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.590 
me I think it's the fact that so many
players<00:00:56.340> have<00:00:56.579> been<00:00:56.670> used<00:00:56.969> I<00:00:57.180> think<00:00:57.210> even

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
players have been used I think even

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.770 
players have been used I think even
watching<00:00:57.960> yesterday<00:00:58.170> I<00:00:58.410> think<00:00:59.149> five<00:01:00.149> sub<00:01:00.510> six

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
watching yesterday I think five sub six

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.330 
watching yesterday I think five sub six
ups<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:01.230> two<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.440> them<00:01:01.559> went<00:01:01.739> on<00:01:01.800> and<00:01:02.010> scored

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:02.340 
ups and two of them went on and scored

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:03.680 
ups and two of them went on and scored
so<00:01:02.640> it's<00:01:02.820> great<00:01:03.059> that<00:01:03.090> we've<00:01:03.390> got<00:01:03.539> that

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
so it's great that we've got that

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.510 
so it's great that we've got that
strength<00:01:03.960> in<00:01:04.170> depth<00:01:04.410> and<00:01:04.680> see<00:01:05.250> any<00:01:05.399> young

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:05.520 
strength in depth and see any young

00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:07.000 
strength in depth and see any young
players<00:01:05.789> come<00:01:06.000> through<00:01:06.030> it

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:07.010 
players come through it

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.940 
players come through it
Canada<00:01:07.880> have<00:01:08.120> a<00:01:08.210> strong<00:01:08.480> side<00:01:08.810> what<00:01:09.590> kind<00:01:09.830> of

performance corn in this game it's still
a<00:01:44.630> little<00:01:44.780> bit<00:01:44.900> raw<00:01:45.140> that<00:01:45.320> game<00:01:45.560> actually

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:45.770 
a little bit raw that game actually

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:47.710 
a little bit raw that game actually
obviously<00:01:46.310> so<00:01:46.730> disappointing<00:01:47.360> getting<00:01:47.600> to

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
obviously so disappointing getting to

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.290 
obviously so disappointing getting to
that<00:01:47.810> stage<00:01:47.870> in<00:01:48.260> losing<00:01:48.620> I<00:01:48.710> think<00:01:49.300> playing

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:50.300 
that stage in losing I think playing

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:51.700 
that stage in losing I think playing
against<00:01:50.510> a<00:01:50.630> diamond<00:01:51.050> playing<00:01:51.380> against<00:01:51.590> a

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.830 
against a diamond playing against a
4-4-2<00:01:52.160> and<00:01:52.520> how<00:01:52.610> to<00:01:52.670> defend<00:01:53.000> against<00:01:53.420> it<00:01:53.600> as<00:01:53.780> a

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
4-4-2 and how to defend against it as a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.300 
4-4-2 and how to defend against it as a
team<00:01:54.200> and<00:01:55.540> you<00:01:56.540> know<00:01:56.690> we<00:01:57.290> conceded<00:01:57.890> two<00:01:58.100> girls
