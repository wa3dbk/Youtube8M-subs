00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.660
 or the one that came is as you already know every time 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.580
 I am more and therefore there are more questions 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:09.349
 As I can not answer them all in 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.139
 the same day I ask you to be short 

00:00:09.349 --> 00:00:13.639
 concise and descriptive if possible in 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:16.340
 the last video so that all are 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.769
 gathered if you want me to upload your photos or 

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:21.199
 videos you can send less by gmail to 

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:24.679
 an aquarium diary at gmail.com or 

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:27.560
 by facebook www.facebook.com diary 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:30.140
 aquarium with its corresponding question 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.609
 franco lopez says hello friend apparently 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.829
 you see that you are an expert in this subject 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:35.210
 of the koi I have a doubt recently 

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.460
 I acquired some copies that 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.110
 they said they were koi all are from funds 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.570
 multicolored and others of a single color 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.550
 like the ones that show in my video my 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.980
 doubt is they are considered as koi to the 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.780
 carps type line or body mirror 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.550
 even when they present these coloration is 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.040
 so showy and have scales is 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:53.720
 different I hope you can answer me 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.030
 doubt or recommend an article for 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.739
 read and guide me better the truth is that 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.780
 I'm not an expert on the subject but I do 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.940
 I can say that between coix goal fish and 

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.100
 other tents there are four differences 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:06.020
 generals that only the colts have in 

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.880
 first place two pairs of whiskers or 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.740
 sensitive appendages that have the coen 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.119
 the mouth to detect the food in 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.280
 second place has in the body more 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:14.869
 elongated this is appreciated very well watching 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.700
 that there is more distance from the fin 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.409
 dorsal to the head in fact its 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:20.630
 head is also larger and longer 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.189
 third the fins of the cars 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.380
 They are more robust and more intense in color 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.810
 and in fourth place the coloring of the 

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.729
 coi is much more intense and sharp than 

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.439
 the blows and other carps other 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.570
 differences that do not usually say much 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.009
 are that today, for example, have the 

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.600
 eyes like a little more 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.250
 embedded in the skin the scales are 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.380
 much bigger and the difference more 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.990
 obvious but later is that they reach 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.729
 measure much more size easily get 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.420
 at 15 centimeters and can reach 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.119
 measure one meter 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.460
 bryant bustillo says hello friend here you 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.380
 I leave some pictures of my plants I do not know of 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.509
 what kind are they but I have them with some 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.429
 balls that they recommended to me they say that 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:57.899
 are worth for a year going back to what 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.420
 the plants sold them to me all 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.369
 equal and without knowing the names in a 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:04.259
 of them a snail was stuck while 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.820
 investigating about him and not found 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:08.130
 nothing could you give me a bit of 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.259
 information thanks your snail is a 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:11.880
 genius me elena also called snail 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.440
 killer and is that it feeds on others 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.420
 snails like the rules and so on 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:17.430
 that are tiny also eat everything 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.260
 type of food like vegetable flakes and 

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:21.269
 everything that your plants fall into your mouth 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.540
 they are andy already bacterium and variety barter and 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:26.239
 the fact of java 

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.769
 and amazons or equine of horus s are 

00:02:26.239 --> 00:02:29.359
 plants of the easy and with a 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.099
 Normal lighting water changes 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:33.290
 constants and those balls of fertilizer that 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.269
 you should throw it right it 's true that 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.719
 payment can last between six months and 

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:37.549
 one year 

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.260
 but then the ball remains inert and there 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.329
 to change it for another and barbe says 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.549
 Greetings I have seen many of your videos 

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.870
 but it is the first time that I comment and 

00:02:43.549 --> 00:02:46.909
 I would like you to guide me is with respect 

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.730
 to the trunk that I introduced in my aquarium 

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.310
 January 4, 2014 and already today is 17 of 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.780
 February and still try to rub I do not have 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.639
 fastened a stone with nylon 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.760
 transparent and the trunk has several 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:03:01.040
 branches so to speak it has a meter 25 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.439
 long by about 40 centimeters high 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.590
 my aquarium is 500 liters with cichlids 

00:03:03.439 --> 00:03:08.209
 American catfish two fringe and one 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.269
 poor school after plated 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.470
 I want to know when the trunk will sink 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.359
 of wood is beginning to be able to go 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:16.189
 It should be noted that I took the wood from 

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:18.169
 edge of a river in the summer when the 

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.720
 river was somewhat dry and it was very 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:22.189
 dry nothing green and does not have water nor is it 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.019
 harmful to my fish many 

00:03:22.189 --> 00:03:26.150
 thank you if you have been in a river 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:28.069
 sunk should sink again but 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.549
 how big it can last for weeks or 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:29.590
 months 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:31.660
 there are some ways 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.709
 are less dense than others or contain 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.780
 more air bags 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:37.360
 that's why they take longer to sink, although 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.190
 are less dense than water would be almost 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:40.989
 impossible that they would go up in that case just 

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:43.090
 there is the option of leaving it tied to a 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:44.650
 stone or something with weight boil the trunk 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.990
 would help a lot but in your case how is 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:49.910
 so big you can not raúl garcía says 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:51.800
 Mr. Daily I have a heater like the 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:54.110
 yours but I have it totally submerged 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.880
 that's bad it could spoil what 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.710
 I bought a few weeks ago and I have not 

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:59.480
 noticed nothing bad but when I saw that the 

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:01.640
 yours was not totally in the water I've 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:03.530
 I've already thought about it and I have several 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.330
 heaters the same and all the 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.340
 always had outside but I think 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:09.440
 remember that the instructions said that 

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:11.360
 anyway they do not have marks that 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:13.040
 indicate that it is submersible as it should be 

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.900
 be normal, indicating the centimeters 

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.760
 to which you can also submerge 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.110
 also having it placed like this I can 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.840
 regulate it more easily 

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:22.580
 rayco garcía peraza says hello jose me 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.530
 You could decide how to feed snails 

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.930
 in the most appropriate way thanks friends 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.120
 continue like this in small containers apart 

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.190
 of the aquarium with water without filter and 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.630
 making 100% water changes a 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.670
 once a week with the aquarium water 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.350
 it's like they get bigger and live 

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.510
 longer in aquariums by 

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.370
 reasons that I do not know do not grow as much and 

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:42.470
 they usually live much less time to eat 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:45.650
 you can give them everything you want from 

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:47.810
 fish food fish vegetable fruit 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:50.060
 shellfish practically snails do not 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:52.370
 they have limits here we have one of the 

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.380
 snails that I was creating in a 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:56.900
 container apart from the aquarium 10 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.940
 pretty size after I put them all 

00:04:56.900 --> 00:05:03.550
 in the aquarium and some died 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:06.220
 as for example it can be 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:09.400
 the one that is there let's focus a bit 

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:11.770
 plus the shell that is empty and the truth 

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.690
 I was very sorry because they were 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:17.050
 dying the biggest ones that had more 

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.090
 time the little ones survived 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.340
 They are a little fat but they do not reach 

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:23.259
 acquire the size that the others had 

00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:26.259
 around here a cabroncete with versions of 

00:05:23.259 --> 00:05:28.270
 the plants that look how you see you have it and 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:30.550
 for the rest of the aquarium there are enough 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:32.409
 tiny snails but you can tell 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.940
 they live as comfortable as in the container 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:35.940
 that had part of the aquarium 

00:05:38.729 --> 00:05:42.930
 good guys and girls thank you very much to 

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:45.180
 everyone to see my videos that every time 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.800
 you are more and much effort is appreciated 

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:48.180
 make better and better videos but not 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:50.999
 I see that that's enough to 

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:54.110
 compensate for it so I'll think about something 

00:05:50.999 --> 00:05:54.110
 until the next video
