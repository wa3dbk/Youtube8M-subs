you have to believe me on that I
thank<00:03:01.250> for<00:03:01.879> it

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:28.500 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.680 

some<00:03:28.860> trick<00:03:29.400> this<00:03:29.730> is<00:03:29.880> certain<00:03:30.150> he<00:03:30.240> picks

it could be 30 pics here

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:40.550 
it could be 30 pics here
out<00:03:36.980> there<00:03:37.280> night

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.059 

it's<00:03:41.010> another<00:03:41.250> passing<00:03:41.820> point

00:03:44.059 --> 00:03:44.069 
it's another passing point

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.369 
it's another passing point
this<00:03:44.640> inside<00:03:45.120> of<00:03:45.150> the<00:03:45.360> truck<00:03:45.599> is<00:03:45.750> 10<00:03:45.959> meters

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
this inside of the truck is 10 meters

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:50.539 
this inside of the truck is 10 meters
wide<00:03:47.569> is<00:03:48.569> the<00:03:48.750> relatively<00:03:49.230> wide<00:03:49.560> for<00:03:50.340> both

00:03:50.539 --> 00:03:50.549 
wide is the relatively wide for both

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:55.520 
wide is the relatively wide for both
parts<00:03:50.879> in<00:03:51.109> motorcycles<00:03:53.000> and<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.719> apex<00:03:55.260> for

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:55.530 
parts in motorcycles and the apex for

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.940 
parts in motorcycles and the apex for
hands<00:03:55.829> yes<00:03:56.099> prepare<00:03:56.489> well<00:03:56.939> for<00:03:56.969> the<00:03:57.950> final

hairpin

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:07.730 

so<00:04:06.510> there<00:04:06.660> are<00:04:06.720> two<00:04:06.840> variations<00:04:07.170> on<00:04:07.620> this

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:07.740 
so there are two variations on this

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.760 
so there are two variations on this
portion<00:04:08.220> you<00:04:08.250> can<00:04:08.340> make<00:04:08.610> it<00:04:08.760> straight<00:04:09.680> you<00:04:10.680> can

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:10.770 
portion you can make it straight you can

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:19.220 
portion you can make it straight you can
take<00:04:11.040> them<00:04:11.250> left<00:04:12.000> right<00:04:12.270> right<00:04:12.510> left<00:04:13.200> sequence

00:04:19.220 --> 00:04:19.230 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.820 

there<00:04:19.710> you<00:04:19.830> go<00:04:20.840> two<00:04:21.840> laps<00:04:22.110> around<00:04:22.290> the<00:04:22.620> car

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
there you go two laps around the car

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:31.390 
there you go two laps around the car
locks<00:04:23.070> you<00:04:23.280> can<00:04:23.340> feel

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:33.460 

you
