in<00:00:24.630> his<00:00:24.779> work<00:00:27.290> we<00:00:28.290> have<00:00:28.470> a<00:00:28.500> gentleman<00:00:29.430> named

in his work we have a gentleman named
rusty<00:00:29.820> hag<00:00:30.180> and<00:00:30.540> he's<00:00:30.779> done<00:00:31.140> almost<00:00:31.320> a

rusty hag and he's done almost a
thousand<00:00:31.950> crashes<00:00:32.399> so<00:00:32.550> he'll<00:00:32.730> be<00:00:32.790> in<00:00:33.000> some<00:00:33.239> of

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
thousand crashes so he'll be in some of

thousand crashes so he'll be in some of
that<00:00:33.480> as<00:00:34.440> I'm<00:00:34.590> on<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.800> approach<00:00:35.070> on<00:00:35.220> the<00:00:35.309> crash

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
that as I'm on the approach on the crash

have accidents that don't go the way
people<00:01:22.630> think<00:01:23.500> things<00:01:24.250> should<00:01:24.370> be<00:01:24.520> and<00:01:25.030> we

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
people think things should be and we

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.690 
people think things should be and we
have<00:01:25.630> an<00:01:25.750> accident<00:01:26.260> and<00:01:26.430> sometimes<00:01:27.430> we<00:01:27.550> will

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:27.700 
have an accident and sometimes we will

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.270 
have an accident and sometimes we will
get<00:01:27.820> hurt<00:01:28.030> sometimes<00:01:28.360> people<00:01:28.810> get<00:01:28.900> killed<00:01:29.280> and

get hurt sometimes people get killed and

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.740 
get hurt sometimes people get killed and
we'd<00:01:30.520> like<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:30.940> put<00:01:31.180> things<00:01:31.210> back<00:01:31.570> together

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:31.750 
we'd like to put things back together

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.410 
we'd like to put things back together
properly<00:01:32.380> and<00:01:33.010> determine<00:01:33.880> what<00:01:33.910> really

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.420 
properly and determine what really

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.570 
properly and determine what really
happened<00:01:34.780> the<00:01:35.230> whole<00:01:35.350> idea<00:01:35.500> is<00:01:35.740> that<00:01:35.800> the<00:01:36.430> guys

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:36.580 
happened the whole idea is that the guys

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.830 
happened the whole idea is that the guys
out<00:01:36.790> there<00:01:36.910> in<00:01:37.000> the<00:01:37.060> field<00:01:37.090> investigating

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:37.840 
out there in the field investigating

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.420 
out there in the field investigating
crashes<00:01:38.260> are<00:01:38.380> the<00:01:38.410> cornerstone<00:01:39.010> of<00:01:39.040> traffic

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:39.430 
crashes are the cornerstone of traffic

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.340 
crashes are the cornerstone of traffic
safety<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:40.300> know<00:01:40.420> if<00:01:40.510> there's<00:01:40.960> a<00:01:41.050> bunch<00:01:41.260> of

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:41.350 
safety you know if there's a bunch of

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.510 
safety you know if there's a bunch of

in measurements and photographs help us

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.620 
in measurements and photographs help us
to<00:01:52.270> determine<00:01:52.750> more<00:01:53.560> accurately<00:01:54.250> what<00:01:55.120> really

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
to determine more accurately what really

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.750 
to determine more accurately what really
happened<00:01:56.080> in<00:01:56.170> a<00:01:56.260> crash<00:01:56.500> and<00:01:57.220> that's<00:01:57.520> really

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:57.760 
happened in a crash and that's really

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.760 
happened in a crash and that's really
that's<00:01:58.630> really<00:01:58.750> where<00:01:59.350> we're<00:01:59.470> starting<00:01:59.620> here

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
that's really where we're starting here

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:03.420
