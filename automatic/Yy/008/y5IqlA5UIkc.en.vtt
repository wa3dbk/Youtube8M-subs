Cloverfield type of film but I found it

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:42.739 
Cloverfield type of film but I found it
to<00:02:40.829> be<00:02:40.859> a<00:02:40.950> bit<00:02:41.099> cheap<00:02:41.340> and<00:02:41.909> the<00:02:42.120> acting<00:02:42.419> scene

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:42.749 
to be a bit cheap and the acting scene

00:02:42.749 --> 00:02:44.659

but it was a good film what worth a

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:50.030 
but it was a good film what worth a
watch<00:02:47.659> and<00:02:48.659> one<00:02:49.139> to<00:02:49.260> keep<00:02:49.409> as<00:02:49.590> well<00:02:49.739> as<00:02:50.010> a
