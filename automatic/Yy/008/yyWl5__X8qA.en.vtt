I did have this piece like driftwood

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.120 
I did have this piece like driftwood
just<00:02:01.820> here<00:02:02.119> it<00:02:02.899> has<00:02:03.049> been<00:02:03.079> there<00:02:03.560> for<00:02:03.590> a<00:02:03.829> while

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:04.130 
just here it has been there for a while

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.370 
just here it has been there for a while
but<00:02:05.030> before<00:02:05.299> that<00:02:05.390> I<00:02:05.450> did<00:02:05.659> have<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.109> there

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:06.380 
but before that I did have that there

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:08.469 
but before that I did have that there
but<00:02:06.619> she<00:02:07.130> became<00:02:07.280> too<00:02:07.609> big<00:02:07.909> and<00:02:08.090> she<00:02:08.179> was<00:02:08.300> too

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
but she became too big and she was too

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.290 
but she became too big and she was too
close<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:08.780> the<00:02:09.429> heat<00:02:10.429> lamp<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.879> that<00:02:11.090> will

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
close to the heat lamp and that will

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.600 
close to the heat lamp and that will
burn<00:02:11.510> her<00:02:11.840> so<00:02:12.590> I<00:02:12.620> thought<00:02:12.980> this<00:02:13.129> is<00:02:13.190> having

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610
