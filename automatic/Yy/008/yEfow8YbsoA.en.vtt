lazy eye elephant yeah and to draw this
trunk<00:00:48.120> just<00:00:48.510> draw<00:00:48.780> two<00:00:49.200> lines<00:00:51.260> like<00:00:52.260> that<00:00:52.469> okay

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
trunk just draw two lines like that okay

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.250 
trunk just draw two lines like that okay
the<00:00:52.980> sense<00:00:53.190> one's<00:00:53.370> got<00:00:53.520> ruined<00:00:53.730> trunk<00:00:54.510> and

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
the sense one's got ruined trunk and

00:00:55.260 --> 00:01:00.319 
the sense one's got ruined trunk and
then<00:00:55.410> connect<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> one<00:00:57.770> and<00:00:58.770> turn<00:00:58.980> up<00:00:59.329> and

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
then connect that one and turn up and

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.770 
then connect that one and turn up and
around<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.960> join<00:01:01.230> up<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.620> other<00:01:01.739> line<00:01:02.780> if

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
around to join up to the other line if

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.219 
around to join up to the other line if
it<00:01:04.170> goes<00:01:04.350> wrong<00:01:04.559> like<00:01:05.100> my<00:01:05.369> wondered<00:01:05.729> just<00:01:06.229> mix

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
use pencil throw out diagrams now you

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.289 
use pencil throw out diagrams now you
control<00:01:15.540> eight<00:01:15.780> through<00:01:16.140> little<00:01:16.820> line<00:01:17.820> to<00:01:17.850> the

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
control eight through little line to the

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.530 
control eight through little line to the
detail<00:01:19.790> going<00:01:20.790> to<00:01:20.939> do<00:01:21.060> all<00:01:21.150> eight<00:01:21.299> little

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:21.540 
detail going to do all eight little

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.429 
detail going to do all eight little
tasks<00:01:22.729> which<00:01:23.729> are<00:01:23.820> kind<00:01:24.090> of<00:01:24.210> like<00:01:24.420> soft<00:01:24.750> upside

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
tasks which are kind of like soft upside

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.130 
tasks which are kind of like soft upside
down<00:01:25.590> triangles<00:01:27.950> but<00:01:28.950> they're<00:01:29.159> the<00:01:29.280> tusks<00:01:29.700> and

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
down triangles but they're the tusks and

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.080 
down triangles but they're the tusks and
then<00:01:31.140> orange<00:01:31.740> dude<00:01:32.100> but<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:32.520> number<00:01:32.880> goes

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
then orange dude but that number goes

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.999 
then orange dude but that number goes
wrong<00:01:33.299> for<00:01:33.479> me<00:01:33.570> is<00:01:33.750> your<00:01:33.960> head<00:01:34.259> right<00:01:34.290> try<00:01:34.890> and

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
wrong for me is your head right try and

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.530 
wrong for me is your head right try and
draw<00:01:35.159> it<00:01:35.299> halfway<00:01:36.299> in<00:01:37.250> two<00:01:38.250> or<00:01:38.970> three<00:01:39.210> quarters

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
draw it halfway in two or three quarters

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:44.260 
draw it halfway in two or three quarters
of<00:01:39.659> the<00:01:39.780> way<00:01:39.900> into<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.060> trunk<00:01:42.060> but<00:01:42.600> tusks<00:01:43.350> and

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
of the way into the trunk but tusks and

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.480 
of the way into the trunk but tusks and
just<00:01:45.270> go<00:01:45.479> around<00:01:45.710> doing<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.360> head<00:01:48.360> and

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:49.490 
just go around doing the head and

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.830 
just go around doing the head and
basically<00:01:50.490> what<00:01:50.700> that<00:01:50.729> does<00:01:50.820> is<00:01:51.210> it<00:01:51.390> makes<00:01:51.630> it

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
basically what that does is it makes it

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.950 
basically what that does is it makes it
look<00:01:52.079> the<00:01:52.979> tough<00:01:53.220> without<00:01:54.180> more

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.400 

so<00:01:58.960> that<00:01:59.170> is<00:01:59.380> very<00:01:59.560> wonky<00:01:59.800> here<00:02:00.280> tada

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:02.410 
so that is very wonky here tada

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:03.900 
so that is very wonky here tada
so<00:02:02.770> you<00:02:02.830> can<00:02:03.040> see<00:02:03.250> how<00:02:03.460> it's<00:02:03.610> coming<00:02:03.790> along

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:03.910 
so you can see how it's coming along

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:08.700 
so you can see how it's coming along
it's<00:02:04.660> not<00:02:04.750> a<00:02:05.250> well<00:02:06.280> now<00:02:06.880> job<00:02:07.300> it<00:02:07.420> is<00:02:07.710> which

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:08.710 
it's not a well now job it is which

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:13.220 
it's not a well now job it is which
aren't<00:02:09.520> round<00:02:09.910> really<00:02:10.540> they<00:02:10.720> kind<00:02:11.020> of<00:02:11.110> sound

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
aren't round really they kind of sound

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:17.730 
aren't round really they kind of sound
around<00:02:14.230> like<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:15.930> means<00:02:16.930> you<00:02:17.110> draw<00:02:17.320> them<00:02:17.500> all

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
around like that means you draw them all

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.670 
around like that means you draw them all
different<00:02:18.010> sizes<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:18.550> then<00:02:19.060> like<00:02:19.680> detail

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 
different sizes and then like detail

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.650 
different sizes and then like detail
again<00:02:22.230> other<00:02:23.230> ear<00:02:24.150> it's<00:02:25.150> going<00:02:25.300> to<00:02:25.360> be<00:02:25.450> really

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:25.660 
again other ear it's going to be really

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:27.990
