00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
 outside but you've been against them indicated against quotes in 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.830
 benches 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.840
 mouriño 

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:07.939
 it's like that 

00:00:07.939 --> 00:00:10.809
 and that's the way it is and that's how it behaves 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.269
 Like me 

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.419
 he kills her 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.599
 or how are they 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:18.899
 I do not know either of them personally was not spoken from the 

00:00:18.899 --> 00:00:22.130
 point look is the bench this zone the point of view bench 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.210
 guardiola 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.649
 it's out of the river Nazas contest to another level 

00:00:27.649 --> 00:00:30.429
 well above what it shows 

00:00:30.429 --> 00:00:32.980
 the reading that makes you 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.400
 previous serious type the each party how it faces 

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.020
 each party 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.540
 the opinions it generates in its players that I clearly understand that 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.980
 both the orchestrated with a script marked in this case by its 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.310
 trainer in delay for guardiola 

00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.530
 and the opposite pole is 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.680
 mouriño 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.000
 where all the statements and absolutely the entire script 

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.070
 preset should be 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:04.100
 to some baton marked in this case by the coach 

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:05.550
 and what good 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.030
 and that I will not come to discover right now 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.150
 that what an operator is doing is clear that eta 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.780
 removing the feet from the pot dish continuously not because they will help 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.780
 to a point six Chinese already last year 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.510
 iii and what I will walk around dark like we say around here for my land and not 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.990
 considers that the whole world is against mourinho is also to say that it is 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:28.930
 to fuck mouriño and right now 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.200
 the lokon entered as if it were the chipotec act in tarazona 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.110
 in that locality of Aragonese hallacas and bordering Navarre but that is the 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.310
 cipotegato party consist of putting afloat was a hood 

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:44.320
 and start to throw everything 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:48.030
 That is why the desire for acute syncope is true janukah holiday. 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.660
 will be the candidate 

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.060
 three days a week and stopped 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.960
 We can because you go to many places and you go to many to many autonomous communities 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.860
 and you like it 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:57.850
 travel 

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:01.030
 and they know what happens in Spain that we have in Spain 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.630
 absolutely lovely 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.020
 and so this type of data a total contribution tarazona to pay paco martínez 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.640
 soria for the canaries 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.230
 I think you are completely the opposite I think we have come against 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.460
 all not all against mourinho I think it is completely contrary to the psoe 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.390
 mouriño 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.969
 with everything 

00:02:17.969 --> 00:02:22.269
 in case you do not think that suddenly again not for me to answer what I want 

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.379
 kemp guardiola kills them silently the one who also ac 

00:02:26.029 --> 00:02:27.759
 things from the bench 

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:30.759
 hoa and premeditated strategies 

00:02:31.429 --> 00:02:35.540
 the strategies of guardiola xix are all 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.439
 from the 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:41.259
 my perception are all marked by the good taste for the treatment 

00:02:41.259 --> 00:02:42.259
 exquisite 

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:46.409
 just the opposite that is done in this case from the bench the Real Madrid 

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.089
 I only remember you goals is not the player with more cards rest of the frame 

00:02:50.689 --> 00:02:53.229
 and the most listened ballast of Barcelona 

00:02:53.229 --> 00:02:54.749
 and not kicked 

00:02:54.749 --> 00:02:56.449
 next to this said 

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:57.519
 good point 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:03.150
 0 but ask your soccer buddies how the environment was like in the 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.239
 field 

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:09.010
 is a guy who is very much in the dock because surely actor and 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.010
 another way but 

00:03:13.869 --> 00:03:17.819
 neither should the answer to the room lead to it so what I 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:19.850
 I want everyone to respond what they want but 

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:23.010
 What do you think of the summit that I was maintaining with Cristóbal de Roberto 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.179
 beloved come black from the Andes 

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:26.329
 the most cristóbal low 

00:03:26.329 --> 00:03:27.879
 the state of many of the things that happen
