00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.610 

okay<00:00:00.510> so<00:00:00.570> let's<00:00:00.840> talk<00:00:00.960> about<00:00:01.020> the<00:00:01.290> soldering

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:01.620 
okay so let's talk about the soldering

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:03.590 
okay so let's talk about the soldering
iron<00:00:01.860> why<00:00:02.610> do<00:00:02.669> we<00:00:02.790> need<00:00:02.939> a<00:00:02.970> soldering<00:00:03.210> iron

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
iron why do we need a soldering iron

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.780 
iron why do we need a soldering iron
because<00:00:04.200> what<00:00:04.410> a<00:00:04.440> soldering<00:00:04.830> iron<00:00:05.040> does<00:00:05.430> is

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
because what a soldering iron does is

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.230 
because what a soldering iron does is
it's<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.509> very<00:00:06.720> hot<00:00:07.140> tool<00:00:07.859> and<00:00:08.309> it's<00:00:08.940> actually

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
it's a very hot tool and it's actually

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:10.759 
it's a very hot tool and it's actually
can<00:00:09.420> be<00:00:09.540> very<00:00:09.719> dangerous<00:00:09.870> for<00:00:10.290> that<00:00:10.320> reason<00:00:10.740> so

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:10.769 
can be very dangerous for that reason so

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:12.290 
can be very dangerous for that reason so
I<00:00:11.010> want<00:00:11.160> to<00:00:11.219> talk<00:00:11.400> about<00:00:11.550> kind<00:00:11.910> of<00:00:11.969> soldering

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
I want to talk about kind of soldering

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.049 
I want to talk about kind of soldering
safety<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:12.870> a<00:00:12.960> bit<00:00:13.139> but<00:00:13.920> what<00:00:14.070> it<00:00:14.190> does<00:00:14.370> is<00:00:14.759> it's

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
safety in a bit but what it does is it's

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.660 
safety in a bit but what it does is it's
able<00:00:15.360> to<00:00:15.660> melt<00:00:15.929> a<00:00:16.350> metal<00:00:17.070> with<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.220> low<00:00:17.430> melting

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:34.710 
you're using the unique copper foil

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.770 
you're using the unique copper foil
method<00:00:34.920> you<00:00:35.640> have<00:00:35.670> to<00:00:35.790> coat<00:00:36.090> the<00:00:36.239> copper<00:00:36.570> foil

method you have to coat the copper foil

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.780 
method you have to coat the copper foil
with<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.050> liquid<00:00:37.590> flux<00:00:37.890> and<00:00:38.280> then<00:00:38.460> the<00:00:38.550> solder

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
with a liquid flux and then the solder

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.090 
with a liquid flux and then the solder
will<00:00:39.329> join<00:00:39.690> those<00:00:40.050> pieces<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:40.500> copper<00:00:40.829> foil

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:41.100 
will join those pieces of copper foil

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.619 
will join those pieces of copper foil
together<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.790> because<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> glass<00:00:42.420> is

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
together and because the glass is

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:44.450 
together and because the glass is
embedded<00:00:43.050> in<00:00:43.140> the<00:00:43.230> foil<00:00:43.469> now<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:43.980> glass<00:00:44.280> is

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
embedded in the foil now the glass is

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.160 
embedded in the foil now the glass is
stuck<00:00:44.640> together<00:00:44.789> too<00:00:45.149> and<00:00:45.629> we'll<00:00:45.780> go<00:00:45.930> through

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
stuck together too and we'll go through

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.330 
stuck together too and we'll go through
all<00:00:46.200> that<00:00:46.379> but<00:00:46.620> that's<00:00:46.770> what<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:47.010> soldering

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
all that but that's what the soldering

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.209 
all that but that's what the soldering
iron<00:00:47.520> is<00:00:47.820> for<00:00:48.090> if<00:00:48.360> heats<00:00:48.930> up<00:00:49.140> solder<00:00:49.469> so<00:00:50.100> that

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
iron is for if heats up solder so that

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.100 
iron is for if heats up solder so that
you<00:00:50.309> can<00:00:50.460> either<00:00:50.700> solder<00:00:51.090> joints<00:00:51.629> and<00:00:51.870> lead

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
you can either solder joints and lead

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:54.740 
you can either solder joints and lead
cane<00:00:52.410> or<00:00:52.829> you<00:00:53.190> can<00:00:53.370> solder<00:00:53.640> pieces<00:00:54.180> of<00:00:54.329> copper

all<00:00:59.129> kinds<00:00:59.670> of<00:00:59.730> soldering<00:01:00.059> irons<00:01:00.390> you<00:01:00.510> can<00:01:00.660> get

00:01:01.119 --> 00:01:01.129 
all kinds of soldering irons you can get

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:03.920 
all kinds of soldering irons you can get
one<00:01:02.129> thing<00:01:02.370> about<00:01:02.609> soldering<00:01:02.879> irons<00:01:03.390> is<00:01:03.570> they

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
one thing about soldering irons is they

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.050 
one thing about soldering irons is they
can<00:01:04.170> get<00:01:04.320> they<00:01:05.189> can<00:01:05.339> get<00:01:05.460> very<00:01:05.640> very<00:01:05.700> hot

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
can get they can get very very hot

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.060 
can get they can get very very hot
obviously<00:01:06.689> they<00:01:06.840> need<00:01:06.990> to<00:01:07.170> but<00:01:07.740> some

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
obviously they need to but some

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.010 
obviously they need to but some
soldering<00:01:08.460> irons<00:01:08.790> get<00:01:09.060> hotter<00:01:09.420> than<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
soldering irons get hotter than you

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
soldering irons get hotter than you
might<00:01:10.200> want<00:01:10.500> them<00:01:10.650> to<00:01:10.799> get<00:01:10.920> for<00:01:11.159> stained<00:01:11.400> glass

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
might want them to get for stained glass

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.539 
might want them to get for stained glass
you<00:01:12.960> don't<00:01:13.140> want<00:01:13.320> soldering<00:01:13.770> soldering<00:01:14.310> to

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
you don't want soldering soldering to

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.030 
you don't want soldering soldering to
get<00:01:14.640> so<00:01:14.850> hot<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.090> it<00:01:15.390> instantly<00:01:15.900> melts<00:01:16.409> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
get so hot that it instantly melts the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.620 
get so hot that it instantly melts the
solder<00:01:17.220> when<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.670> touches<00:01:17.850> it<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.240> want<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.509> to

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
solder when it touches it you want it to

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.800 
solder when it touches it you want it to
have<00:01:18.960> a<00:01:19.439> slightly<00:01:19.920> gradual<00:01:20.729> kind<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.420> melting

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
have a slightly gradual kind of melting

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.780 
have a slightly gradual kind of melting
process<00:01:21.990> where<00:01:22.560> it<00:01:22.680> kind<00:01:23.250> of<00:01:23.340> you<00:01:23.520> know<00:01:23.610> maybe

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
process where it kind of you know maybe

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:26.359 
process where it kind of you know maybe
takes<00:01:24.150> just<00:01:24.360> a<00:01:24.450> few<00:01:24.900> seconds<00:01:25.470> maybe<00:01:25.619> to<00:01:25.860> melt

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
takes just a few seconds maybe to melt

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.640 
takes just a few seconds maybe to melt
that<00:01:26.520> solder<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:27.900> point<00:01:28.110> I'm<00:01:28.229> getting<00:01:28.259> to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
that solder so the point I'm getting to

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.770 
that solder so the point I'm getting to
is<00:01:28.799> soldering<00:01:29.610> irons<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.030> plug<00:01:30.360> straight

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
is soldering irons that plug straight

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.749 
is soldering irons that plug straight
into<00:01:30.840> the<00:01:31.200> wall<00:01:31.409> you<00:01:32.159> don't<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.430> a<00:01:32.460> lot<00:01:32.640> of

into the wall you don't have a lot of

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:35.030 
into the wall you don't have a lot of
control<00:01:33.119> over<00:01:33.150> that<00:01:33.479> temperature<00:01:33.960> but<00:01:34.680> if<00:01:34.890> you

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
control over that temperature but if you

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.859 
control over that temperature but if you
can<00:01:35.250> buy<00:01:35.460> or<00:01:35.909> get<00:01:36.090> one<00:01:36.299> of<00:01:36.390> these<00:01:36.479> soldering

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
can buy or get one of these soldering

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:40.550 
can buy or get one of these soldering

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
it's uh you see it's very hot but this

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.890 
it's uh you see it's very hot but this
is<00:02:17.489> a<00:02:17.520> nice<00:02:17.730> stand<00:02:18.150> that's<00:02:18.390> keeping<00:02:18.750> my

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
is a nice stand that's keeping my

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.380 
is a nice stand that's keeping my
soldering<00:02:19.620> iron<00:02:19.680> safe<00:02:20.160> kind<00:02:20.640> of<00:02:20.790> away<00:02:21.000> from

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
soldering iron safe kind of away from

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.420 
soldering iron safe kind of away from
you<00:02:21.900> know<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.019> table<00:02:22.709> where<00:02:22.920> it<00:02:23.010> could<00:02:23.160> burn

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you know the table where it could burn

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:25.670 
you know the table where it could burn
my<00:02:23.640> wood<00:02:23.849> table<00:02:24.269> or<00:02:24.420> away<00:02:25.050> from<00:02:25.260> me<00:02:25.410> or<00:02:25.620> it

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
my wood table or away from me or it

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.530 
my wood table or away from me or it
could<00:02:25.800> burn<00:02:25.950> me<00:02:26.160> you<00:02:26.550> see<00:02:26.760> it<00:02:26.849> has<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.030> sponge

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
could burn me you see it has a sponge

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.750 
could burn me you see it has a sponge
underneath<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.319> a<00:02:28.440> wet<00:02:28.650> sponge<00:02:28.980> that<00:02:29.459> you<00:02:29.550> can

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
underneath it a wet sponge that you can

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.910 
underneath it a wet sponge that you can
use<00:02:29.970> to<00:02:30.150> kind<00:02:30.360> of<00:02:30.390> clean<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> tip<00:02:31.050> right<00:02:31.590> and

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
use to kind of clean the tip right and

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:34.309 
use to kind of clean the tip right and
so<00:02:32.610> it's<00:02:33.030> also<00:02:33.150> kind<00:02:33.450> of<00:02:33.480> nice<00:02:33.690> when<00:02:34.080> you<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.260> a

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
so it's also kind of nice when you get a

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.559 
so it's also kind of nice when you get a
soldering<00:02:34.709> iron<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.550> have<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.730> stand<00:02:36.150> to<00:02:36.420> keep

00:02:36.559 --> 00:02:36.569 
soldering iron to have a stand to keep

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:38.990 
soldering iron to have a stand to keep
it<00:02:36.780> safe<00:02:37.050> and<00:02:37.290> kind<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.950> you<00:02:38.130> know<00:02:38.220> an<00:02:38.489> internal

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
it safe and kind of you know an internal

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.670 
it safe and kind of you know an internal
sponge<00:02:39.269> to<00:02:39.480> clean<00:02:39.690> it<00:02:39.810> off<00:02:39.930> although<00:02:40.290> there

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:40.680 
sponge to clean it off although there

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.320 
sponge to clean it off although there
are<00:02:40.769> other<00:02:40.890> kinds<00:02:41.250> of<00:02:41.340> stands<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.940> systems

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:42.330 
are other kinds of stands and systems

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.660 
are other kinds of stands and systems
that<00:02:42.450> aren't<00:02:42.599> quite<00:02:42.810> this<00:02:43.019> complex<00:02:43.470> but<00:02:43.920> it's

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:44.670 
that aren't quite this complex but it's

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:46.460 
that aren't quite this complex but it's
nice<00:02:44.849> to<00:02:44.879> have<00:02:45.150> heat<00:02:45.390> control<00:02:45.810> it's<00:02:46.110> nice<00:02:46.260> to

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.470 
nice to have heat control it's nice to

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.559 
nice to have heat control it's nice to
have<00:02:46.590> a<00:02:46.620> stand<00:02:47.010> a<00:02:47.280> sponge<00:02:47.910> to<00:02:48.120> clean<00:02:48.150> it<00:02:48.450> off

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.039 
have a stand a sponge to clean it off
and<00:02:49.220> and<00:02:50.220> so<00:02:51.209> in<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.390> next<00:02:51.540> clip<00:02:51.750> I'm<00:02:51.900> going<00:02:51.930> to

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
and and so in the next clip I'm going to

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:53.330 
and and so in the next clip I'm going to
tell<00:02:52.200> you<00:02:52.260> a<00:02:52.319> little<00:02:52.530> bit<00:02:52.620> about<00:02:52.709> the<00:02:52.920> tip<00:02:53.190> of

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
tell you a little bit about the tip of

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.030 
tell you a little bit about the tip of
the<00:02:53.489> soldering<00:02:53.640> iron
