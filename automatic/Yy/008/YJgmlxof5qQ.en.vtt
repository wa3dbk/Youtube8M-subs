00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:38.290 
know how to do that but this is the most

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.260 
know how to do that but this is the most
important<00:01:38.740> thing<00:01:38.920> you<00:01:39.520> want<00:01:39.759> to<00:01:39.850> have<00:01:40.030> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
important thing you want to have the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.929 
important thing you want to have the
blogger<00:01:40.689> setting<00:01:41.500> click<00:01:41.770> that<00:01:42.009> but<00:01:42.670> another

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:42.939 
blogger setting click that but another

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:44.219 
blogger setting click that but another
thing<00:01:43.210> is<00:01:43.360> you<00:01:43.479> always<00:01:43.810> want<00:01:43.990> to<00:01:44.049> make<00:01:44.170> sure

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:44.229 
thing is you always want to make sure

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.499 
thing is you always want to make sure
they're<00:01:44.619> sent<00:01:44.890> to<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.100> featured<00:01:45.579> video<00:01:46.180> you

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
they're sent to the featured video you

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.630 
they're sent to the featured video you
don't<00:01:46.750> want<00:01:47.079> to<00:01:47.200> send<00:01:47.439> them<00:01:47.560> to<00:01:47.680> the<00:01:47.799> feed<00:01:48.040> now

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:48.640 
don't want to send them to the feed now

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.219 
don't want to send them to the feed now
I<00:01:48.670> think<00:01:48.850> the<00:01:49.149> feed<00:01:49.420> is<00:01:49.450> automatically

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:50.229 
I think the feed is automatically

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:52.679 
I think the feed is automatically
clicked<00:01:50.680> it's<00:01:51.040> just<00:01:51.280> a<00:01:51.369> default<00:01:51.820> setting<00:01:52.210> so

00:01:52.679 --> 00:01:52.689 
clicked it's just a default setting so

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:54.030 
clicked it's just a default setting so
you're<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:52.899> to<00:01:52.990> want<00:01:53.140> to<00:01:53.200> unclick<00:01:53.799> that

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
you're going to want to unclick that

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.730 
you're going to want to unclick that
because<00:01:54.759> the<00:01:54.909> feed<00:01:55.149> is<00:01:55.180> basically<00:01:56.049> just<00:01:56.079> your

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
because the feed is basically just your

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:58.319 
because the feed is basically just your
message<00:01:57.159> board<00:01:57.430> you<00:01:57.549> don't<00:01:57.700> want<00:01:57.939> that<00:01:58.119> you

00:01:58.319 --> 00:01:58.329 
message board you don't want that you

00:01:58.329 --> 00:01:59.670 
message board you don't want that you
want<00:01:58.540> them<00:01:58.659> to<00:01:58.750> go<00:01:58.840> to<00:01:58.869> the<00:01:59.049> featured<00:01:59.380> video

00:01:59.670 --> 00:01:59.680 
want them to go to the featured video

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:01.980 
want them to go to the featured video
