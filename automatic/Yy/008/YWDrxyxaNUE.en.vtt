here<00:01:47.740> with<00:01:48.100> the<00:01:48.310> Verizon<00:01:49.030> one<00:01:49.240> way<00:01:49.420> it's

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:49.720 
here with the Verizon one way it's

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:51.300 
here with the Verizon one way it's
slowing<00:01:49.990> down<00:01:50.080> here<00:01:50.440> too<00:01:50.680> which<00:01:50.890> shouldn't<00:01:51.250> be

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
slowing down here too which shouldn't be

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.170 
slowing down here too which shouldn't be
the<00:01:51.490> case<00:01:51.670> so<00:01:51.880> I'll<00:01:52.920> disclose<00:01:53.920> that<00:01:54.310> second

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:55.180 
the case so I'll disclose that second

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:58.350 
the case so I'll disclose that second
test<00:01:55.420> there<00:01:56.490> because<00:01:57.490> basically<00:01:57.759> uploads<00:01:58.270> are

00:01:58.350 --> 00:01:58.360 
test there because basically uploads are

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.760 
test there because basically uploads are
higher<00:01:58.509> almost<00:01:58.990> looking<00:01:59.200> higher<00:01:59.350> than<00:01:59.619> the

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
higher almost looking higher than the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.040 
higher almost looking higher than the
download<00:02:00.460> so<00:02:00.640> we<00:02:00.759> rerun<00:02:01.119> the<00:02:01.270> Verizon<00:02:01.690> one<00:02:01.840> one

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 
download so we rerun the Verizon one one

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.469 
download so we rerun the Verizon one one
more<00:02:02.229> time<00:02:02.550> so<00:02:03.550> we<00:02:03.580> can<00:02:03.729> just<00:02:03.970> match<00:02:04.149> what<00:02:04.360> we

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:04.479 
more time so we can just match what we

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:07.080 
more time so we can just match what we
have<00:02:04.630> here<00:02:04.810> for<00:02:04.990> AT&amp;T<00:02:05.350> at<00:02:06.280> the<00:02:06.430> let's<00:02:06.610> restart

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 
have here for AT&amp;T at the let's restart

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.790 
have here for AT&amp;T at the let's restart
that<00:02:07.330> test<00:02:07.600> again<00:02:10.620> okay

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 
that test again okay

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.580 
that test again okay
alright<00:02:12.340> so<00:02:12.670> it's<00:02:13.480> moving<00:02:13.840> up<00:02:13.959> to<00:02:14.110> standard

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:14.590 
alright so it's moving up to standard

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:23.370 
alright so it's moving up to standard
LTE<00:02:15.160> speeds<00:02:17.220> latency<00:02:18.220> is<00:02:18.280> a<00:02:18.340> little<00:02:18.550> high<00:02:22.380> okay

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
LTE speeds latency is a little high okay

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.800

nine megabits per second upload so just

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.540 
nine megabits per second upload so just
show<00:03:17.180> you<00:03:17.270> the<00:03:17.360> final<00:03:17.630> results<00:03:18.080> they're

show you the final results they're

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.710 
show you the final results they're
excluding<00:03:19.550> of<00:03:19.670> course<00:03:19.880> that<00:03:20.060> middle<00:03:20.690> one

there<00:03:21.020> for<00:03:21.230> Verizon<00:03:21.890> you<00:03:22.280> can<00:03:22.430> see<00:03:22.700> basically

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:23.180 
there for Verizon you can see basically

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.340 
there for Verizon you can see basically
agencies<00:03:23.690> killing<00:03:24.260> it<00:03:24.380> in<00:03:24.770> an<00:03:25.570> LTE<00:03:26.570> speeds<00:03:27.050> not

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:27.350 
agencies killing it in an LTE speeds not

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:29.650 
agencies killing it in an LTE speeds not
saying<00:03:27.680> that<00:03:27.800> it's<00:03:28.010> you<00:03:28.400> know<00:03:28.550> it's<00:03:28.940> better<00:03:29.180> or

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
saying that it's you know it's better or

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.210 
saying that it's you know it's better or
it's<00:03:29.840> worse<00:03:30.110> but<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.500> can<00:03:30.710> tell<00:03:30.860> you<00:03:31.010> right<00:03:31.160> now

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
it's worse but I can tell you right now

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.470 
it's worse but I can tell you right now
in<00:03:31.820> the<00:03:32.210> Boston<00:03:32.600> area<00:03:33.040> AT&amp;T<00:03:34.040> has<00:03:34.340> much<00:03:34.940> faster

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
in the Boston area AT&amp;T has much faster

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
in the Boston area AT&amp;T has much faster
almost<00:03:35.930> double<00:03:36.410> the<00:03:36.530> the<00:03:37.190> download<00:03:37.820> speeds

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:38.500 
almost double the the download speeds

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:40.930 
almost double the the download speeds
and<00:03:39.500> they<00:03:39.770> almost<00:03:39.890> even<00:03:40.160> double<00:03:40.460> the<00:03:40.490> upload

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
and they almost even double the upload

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.270 
and they almost even double the upload
speeds<00:03:41.300> for<00:03:42.080> their<00:03:42.200> LT<00:03:42.530> compared<00:03:43.130> to

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
speeds for their LT compared to

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.040 
speeds for their LT compared to
Verizon's<00:03:43.940> so<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.480> is<00:03:44.570> just<00:03:44.720> letting<00:03:44.900> you

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:45.050 
Verizon's so this is just letting you

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:46.990 
Verizon's so this is just letting you
know<00:03:45.080> Shane<00:03:45.470> you<00:03:45.620> guys<00:03:45.800> are<00:03:46.100> of<00:03:46.610> course<00:03:46.880> this

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:47.000 
know Shane you guys are of course this

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.790 
know Shane you guys are of course this
could<00:03:47.180> different<00:03:47.570> change<00:03:47.840> you<00:03:48.140> know<00:03:48.290> this

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
could different change you know this

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.560 
could different change you know this
could<00:03:48.950> be<00:03:49.010> a<00:03:49.100> result<00:03:49.520> that<00:03:49.670> AT&amp;T<00:03:49.970> is<00:03:50.240> just

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:50.570 
could be a result that AT&amp;T is just

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:52.660 
could be a result that AT&amp;T is just
launching<00:03:50.750> their<00:03:51.020> network<00:03:51.350> so<00:03:51.560> very<00:03:52.190> few<00:03:52.370> LTE

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:52.670 
launching their network so very few LTE

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:54.430 
launching their network so very few LTE
devices<00:03:53.000> compared<00:03:53.480> to<00:03:53.600> save<00:03:53.750> Verizon<00:03:54.320> which

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
devices compared to save Verizon which

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:56.250 
devices compared to save Verizon which
has<00:03:54.590> had<00:03:54.920> it<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.130> a<00:03:55.190> little<00:03:55.370> bit<00:03:55.459> of<00:03:55.520> time<00:03:55.700> now

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
has had it for a little bit of time now

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.690 
has had it for a little bit of time now
but<00:03:57.260> that's<00:03:57.560> pretty<00:03:57.770> much<00:03:57.890> it<00:03:58.040> the<00:03:58.370> winner<00:03:58.550> of

00:03:58.690 --> 00:03:58.700 
but that's pretty much it the winner of

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:02.890 
but that's pretty much it the winner of
the<00:03:58.760> speed<00:03:59.000> test<00:03:59.270> is<00:04:00.160> yep<00:04:01.690> AT&amp;T

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
the speed test is yep AT&amp;T

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:06.310 
the speed test is yep AT&amp;T
it<00:04:02.990> seems<00:04:03.260> he's<00:04:03.380> the<00:04:03.530> winner<00:04:03.709> with<00:04:03.920> the<00:04:05.320> speeds

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:06.320 
it seems he's the winner with the speeds

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:09.670 
it seems he's the winner with the speeds
of<00:04:06.500> up<00:04:06.830> to<00:04:06.890> thirty<00:04:07.630> thirty<00:04:08.630> I<00:04:08.750> believe<00:04:09.470> about

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:09.680 
of up to thirty thirty I believe about

00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.890 
of up to thirty thirty I believe about

thirty to thirty two megabits per second
for<00:04:12.140> downloads<00:04:12.709> and<00:04:12.920> roughly<00:04:13.670> around<00:04:13.760> 12

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:16.700 
megabits per second for uploads when it

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.880 
megabits per second for uploads when it
