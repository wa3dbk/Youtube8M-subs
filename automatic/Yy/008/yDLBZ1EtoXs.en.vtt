00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:26.160
 during the 1980s , imports 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.109
 are closed in Brazil, but the 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.180
 passionate about life two wheels had 

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:34.079
 one of the best options in the 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.420
 honda cbx 750f advisor of the legendary 750 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.489
 She also answered by the nickname 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.960
 quite simple and terrified the 

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.670
 with two words well 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.670
 simple seven cock 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.600
 is 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
 am 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.450
 It's good the whole story came because of the 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:42.810
 my father 

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.090
 Since I was born I 've already met a 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.520
 bike through him, right? 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:51.900
 had a cg 125 77 and I remember that in 

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:54.990
 weekends 

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:58.110
 we are in three children right and he 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.979
 put the three and there are two in the tank one 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.570
 behind 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.240
 shop at that time had no concern 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:06.270
 with the security issue but also 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:08.310
 it was very low speed 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.330
 but it was from that moment that the 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.390
 people 

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:15.239
 I particularly started to like 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.160
 and then ended up having to sell because 

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:18.540
 We just grew up and my mother got 

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:22.140
 worried that we are already walking 

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:25.440
 and had to sell part of the 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.959
 But I ended up selling a motorcycle and then 

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:32.190
 was to have another encounter with the vehicle 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:37.680
 two logical one motorized wheel 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.320
 moped was 10 years old and it's good 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.549
 To buy a purchase, so much do you buy 

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:44.190
 and was a moped 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.200
 the three then each one knew 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:49.230
 divide nothing had to see a fight but 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:51.769
 as the smallest still very small dispute 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.650
 I stood between me and my older brother 

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:58.260
 and then we stay with the moped is and for a 

00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:01.560
 time, but then the question started. 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.519
 the scoreboard with this question and why 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:09.180
 came back after selling moped and 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:16.890
 Then I went back to the question with the motorcycle. 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:21.450
 in 2003 with a suzuki gs 500 a motorbike 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:25.890
 It's really cool to travel to some places. 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:29.370
 she's just looking for something more 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.200
 your old bike has a thing with the 

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:35.549
 16 bikes because it 's the first bike when 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:40.530
 it was a 77 that is older but 

00:03:35.549 --> 00:03:42.720
 the idea is to research the seven cock 77 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:46.920
 we just researched researched 

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.670
 arriving at 87 which is this from here 

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:52.800
 the famous hollywood is what I tell 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.400
 everybody playing this one here I 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:59.030
 I do not want any more this one not a 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.030
 there are no more 

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:21.480
 Look, we think it was a survey. 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.790
 more or less three months 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:28.440
 It's funny that we saw the 

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:29.640
 750 such ads tin the more beautiful 

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.070
 Brazil 

00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:37.430
 so come on and talk more beautiful 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:39.510
 and I got there, I had a fret cry 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:42.440
 Suddenly we came out of hahnemann 

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:46.530
 a lada in piracicaba 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:51.360
 then we get there until the owner of this motorcycle 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.330
 there was also a whole 350 xlx there already 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.700
 that it has a differential right there 

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:58.920
 and then we bought the bike side of that person 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:02.250
 It's funny that after a year 

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:04.290
 He called me thinking he was going to sell. 

00:05:02.250 --> 00:05:06.900
 back to him 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:08.360
 I'm sorry but the bike is so good that it does not 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:12.300
 I'll sell again not 

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:15.000
 but the bike was already practically decided 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:18.750
 this way, only a logical issue is the 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:24.330
 parts there are normal because of the weather 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:26.840
 it is also the engine itself 

00:05:24.330 --> 00:05:26.840
 form 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:34.729
 when we went to get her there was a 

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:36.770
 marriage and he also had the 

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:38.449
 dimensioned 41 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.569
 the first change that was made was 

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:43.969
 put the 4 1 because it's like a 

00:05:41.569 --> 00:05:47.620
 opal watch books in a leak 

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.620
 scaled is not funny at all 

00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:12.070
 again coming back with the six engine 

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.990
 Cylinders on the road an impeccable thing 

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:19.070
 I think despite her size but she 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:22.010
 super quiet of heavy driving is 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:24.940
 a little heavy but it's so good 

00:06:22.010 --> 00:06:28.670
 distributed and did not feel too much is 

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:31.280
 sized for itself well 

00:06:28.670 --> 00:06:33.890
 We're going to be right, but it's 87 

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:35.480
 well settled there up to find 

00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:40.280
 piece nowadays being very 

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.740
 difficult and is one is reasonably car 

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.320
 Let's just say that, because the 

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:47.780
 idea that any president is changed 

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:51.140
 the search always for the original part 

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:53.710
 although there is more parallel there but 

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:56.570
 the main one again has a 

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:58.220
 difference protested and the original 

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.940
 in parallel we have to think a 

00:06:58.220 --> 00:07:02.150
 body 

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:04.400
 Look, if a lunatic appears 

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:06.800
 offering a good value 

00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.170
 the idea is to find an older one maybe 

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:13.720
 then I can make it happen to find a 

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.720
 77 the year I was born
