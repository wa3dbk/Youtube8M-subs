00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:13.820
 Today I will tell about the features 

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:16.340
 of the furniture market of Belarus and why 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:16.910

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.640
 let out 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.800
 Belarus is a matter of what I recently 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.920
 bought myself a chair and ran into such 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:28.340
 the situation I traveled probably 6 or 7 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:31.340
 furniture stores in Minsk and could not afford 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:34.880
 buy a cross that i liked me 

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:37.130
 to take and buy cost huge 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.719
 pavilions of the showroom of this pinski wood 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.870
 there is where there is there 57 option comrade 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:46.190
 various sofa chairs there dining rooms but 

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:47.840

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.879
 like give me two and we only 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:52.070

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:54.200
 and the second must be ordered and in one and a half 

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:56.629
 months you bring in what to do 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.660
 prepay another 50 percent or 75 

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:02.090
 percent or is there some other 

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:05.179
 quantity that is, there is no furniture in stock 

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:07.759
 although for a long time there is a world rule that is 

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:10.219
 the fact that in the showroom it is presented 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:12.100
 should be in stock then that is what 

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:14.179
 most often bought it is clear that 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.399
 impossible here this list there 

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:19.639
 let's say there are 20 different fabrics 

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:23.389
 options and keep thats these chairs on 

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:26.990
 stock there at least a pair of each 

00:01:23.389 --> 00:01:28.759
 There are 43 options, but you are the goods that 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.679
 presented in the showroom in the form 

00:01:28.759 --> 00:01:33.139
 which is the best way you should have on 

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:34.729
 warehouse so I came liked bought something

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:55.539
 futile what's behind this 

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:58.069
 Firstly, there is a reluctance 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.899
 furniture makers invest their development 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:01.789
 i.e. what is difficult for you to form 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:05.779
 small warehouse I'm not saying that you 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:09.110

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:21.270

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:55.500
 it is not said that this chair is not 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.840
 pass in the list that this chair will not work 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:00.380
 in the doorway that he is like a turner 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.120
