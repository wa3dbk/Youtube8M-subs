 ps3 pc or xbox 360 

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:48.790

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.260
 audacity so first of all i'm going 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.449
 try sending this video to cox fp 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.770
 getty berlin and this soon and maybe 

00:00:55.449 --> 00:00:58.930
 other chains like the ter I them 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.340
 thank you very much if they claude me then 

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:02.500
 we will start immediately the tutorial 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:04.449
 you go on google or something else 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.680
 you type the address of your livebox 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.220
 neufbox et cetera of your box 192 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:13.869
 points 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.979
 160 8.1.1 for the livebox the others I 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.729
 I do not know, I want to find them 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:19.750
 so after that it's the same normally 

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.910
 identify the password you are going 

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.470
 after in configuration you go in 

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:26.380
 livebox and advanced settings 

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:28.210
 after you go from one to two paws that 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:30.430
 it's simple so there you see but I 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.350
 will explain to you how to do so 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.119
 you add a new set 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.950
 rule and you're going to create new ones 

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.200
 rules then I do it at the same time 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:43.510
 that you put there as I put 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:47.430
 ps3 or xbox or pc you put the port 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:50.500
 who took away stern had 3074 here 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.530
 3074 internally you put the protocol 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.360
 tcp crtc peace you put that in 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.189
 equipment you put console to these 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.439
 lands there you put the console to and 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:01.270
 you make a new rule that's 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:06.060
 say there you do added a 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:10.239
 new rule you put ps3 3074 3074 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.160
 you put after udp cd rom and and udp 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:14.769
 how I like it is you put the same 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.180
 concept of course after you put ps3 

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:19.269
 blackhawks 2 ie there you put 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:22.030
 blackhawks 2 and you develop 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.250
 rest m 80 years internal ports 80 years 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.200
 protocol you put tcp and you put 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.989
 of course the same equipment 2 you have 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.120
 finished that you activate it all thanks to 

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.370
 gold after good we will end up on the 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.900
 ps3 to show you that nat and well 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.280
 open and I show you how to have 

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.109
 a little better connections are 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.290
 call of duty black ops we end up 

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:40.290
 soon 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.780
 so we'll see you again for now on 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.830
 the ps3 so it's pretty simple 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.370
 now as you see down my 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.380
 type of mats 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.300
 it's open I did not have to start 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:53.970
 video is hard when I was doing 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.410
 relegation the livebox my type of not being 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.850
 it was moderate ie I had 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.260
 a type of matting moderate a connection 

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.730
 average but now it's open 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.610
 pattern of mats and it's much better 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 played a lot of parts and the connection 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.460
 there is a small difference 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:09.180
 so now it's pretty simple to 

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:11.310
 say for pc xbox or ps3 then you 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:13.590
 go find party public you 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:14.760
 click on square or x on pc i know 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.500
 not what's the keys I'm 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.540
 clean on pc then you maybe you 

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.860
 go know it I do not know and that's 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.420
 nevertheless hint of research this is 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:25.410
 marked just down at you click on 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:26.580
 square for ps3 x for xbox and after the 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.740
 connection you put it to sea as 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.260
 I normally go half way 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.000
 normal normally I'm not sure where a 

00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:34.530
 all the time so I advise you to 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.760
 the sea â€‹â€‹put in better because they 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:37.350
 are looking for all parties who have 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.940
 a better connection and that's 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.160
 much faster to look for a 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.440
 part so in any case I hope this 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.850
 you will have liked 

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.620
 I hope that community channels 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.820
 that I hesitated at the beginning of the video go 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.560
 I plant I have to thank again 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:51.450

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.880
 I beg you to m a gem to comment
