that<00:01:28.250> we<00:01:28.340> try<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.549> coach<00:01:28.820> to<00:01:29.000> our<00:01:29.090> players

00:01:29.319 --> 00:01:29.329 
that we try to coach to our players

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:30.669

00:01:30.669 --> 00:01:30.679 
because the thing is when we make

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:32.709 
because the thing is when we make
mistakes<00:01:30.710> and<00:01:31.399> secondary<00:01:31.909> level<00:01:32.179> it<00:01:32.270> shows<00:01:32.509> I

00:01:32.709 --> 00:01:32.719 
mistakes and secondary level it shows I

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:34.029 
mistakes and secondary level it shows I
mean<00:01:32.750> it's<00:01:32.990> usually<00:01:33.170> a<00:01:33.380> touchdown<00:01:33.649> or<00:01:33.859> a

mean it's usually a touchdown or a
missed<00:01:34.219> tackle<00:01:34.670> so<00:01:35.210> we<00:01:35.329> have<00:01:35.479> to<00:01:35.600> be

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
missed tackle so we have to be

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
work at it not only in practice but

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:04.510 
work at it not only in practice but
they've<00:02:03.679> done<00:02:03.859> that<00:02:03.979> a<00:02:04.009> lot<00:02:04.159> over<00:02:04.399> the<00:02:04.460> summer

time working to where they can get to
that<00:02:06.049> point<00:02:06.319> we<00:02:06.829> have<00:02:06.979> to<00:02:07.069> add<00:02:07.159> a<00:02:07.189> connection

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
that point we have to add a connection

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:09.010 
that point we have to add a connection
on<00:02:07.819> in<00:02:07.999> off<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.179> field<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:08.660> can't<00:02:08.840> just

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
on in off the field you can't just

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.450 
on in off the field you can't just
happen<00:02:09.259> on<00:02:09.350> the<00:02:09.440> field<00:02:09.619> and<00:02:09.890> we<00:02:10.069> do<00:02:10.190> have<00:02:10.369> that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:10.460 
happen on the field and we do have that

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.950 
happen on the field and we do have that
condition<00:02:10.850> both<00:02:11.000> ways<00:02:11.270> we<00:02:11.540> have<00:02:11.690> to<00:02:11.810> have

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:11.960 
condition both ways we have to have

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.480 
condition both ways we have to have
those<00:02:12.140> two<00:02:12.200> safeties<00:02:12.740> on<00:02:12.890> point<00:02:13.160> when<00:02:13.340> you're

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:13.490 
those two safeties on point when you're

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.280 
those two safeties on point when you're
showing<00:02:13.970> this<00:02:14.210> guises<00:02:14.810> or

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
showing this guises or

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.200 
showing this guises or
you're<00:02:15.950> making<00:02:16.190> tackles<00:02:16.430> because<00:02:16.790> we<00:02:16.940> are<00:02:17.060> the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:17.210 
you're making tackles because we are the

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.490 
you're making tackles because we are the

last line of defense if you don't make
that<00:02:18.650> tackle<00:02:18.800> that's<00:02:19.100> the<00:02:19.190> touchdown

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
that tackle that's the touchdown

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.100 
that tackle that's the touchdown
regardless<00:02:20.030> if<00:02:20.150> it's<00:02:20.330> a<00:02:20.390> running<00:02:20.630> play<00:02:20.720> or
