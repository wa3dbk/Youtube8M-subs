the<00:02:20.600> recovery<00:02:20.990> so<00:02:21.080> we'll<00:02:21.200> go<00:02:21.260> ahead<00:02:21.350> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
the recovery so we'll go ahead and

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:29.990 
device into bootloader mode which it did

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.190 
device into bootloader mode which it did
once<00:02:30.680> that's<00:02:31.660> once<00:02:32.660> that<00:02:32.810> is<00:02:32.930> taking<00:02:33.170> place

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
once that's once that is taking place

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.970 
once that's once that is taking place
we'll<00:02:33.620> hit<00:02:33.830> X<00:02:34.130> and<00:02:34.550> that<00:02:34.970> will<00:02:35.270> initiate<00:02:35.510> the

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:38.390 
recovery so now it's sending recovery

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.740 
recovery so now it's sending recovery
its<00:02:38.510> flashed<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:39.080> recovery<00:02:40.090> and<00:02:41.090> we<00:02:41.510> should

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
its flashed the recovery and we should

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.940 
its flashed the recovery and we should
be<00:02:41.900> good<00:02:42.080> to<00:02:42.230> go

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.500 

this<00:02:45.950> will<00:02:46.160> just<00:02:46.250> select<00:02:46.550> the<00:02:46.670> perm<00:02:47.030> root<00:02:47.270> and

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
this will just select the perm root and

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.620 
this will just select the perm root and
select<00:02:48.140> run<00:02:48.670> that<00:02:49.670> should<00:02:49.910> go<00:02:50.030> ahead<00:02:50.180> and<00:02:50.300> push

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630 
select run that should go ahead and push

supersu<00:02:51.080> to<00:02:51.470> the<00:02:51.590> phone<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.010> reboot<00:02:52.310> it<00:02:52.489> in

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
supersu to the phone and reboot it in

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:54.160 
supersu to the phone and reboot it in
the<00:02:53.060> recovery<00:02:53.420> so<00:02:53.510> that<00:02:53.630> we<00:02:53.690> can<00:02:53.810> flash<00:02:53.989> this

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:54.170 
the recovery so that we can flash this

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:57.760 
the recovery so that we can flash this
we'll<00:02:54.350> click<00:02:54.530> OK<00:02:54.940> and<00:02:55.940> it<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:57.110> sent<00:02:57.380> the

00:02:57.760 --> 00:02:57.770 
we'll click OK and it just sent the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.250 
we'll click OK and it just sent the
recovery<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:59.090> we'll<00:02:59.630> wait<00:02:59.690> to<00:02:59.840> see<00:02:59.900> if<00:03:00.020> it

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
recovery and we'll wait to see if it

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.670 
recovery and we'll wait to see if it
reboots<00:03:01.010> into<00:03:01.280> recovery<00:03:06.850> which<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.030> did<00:03:08.180> not

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
reboots into recovery which it did not

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.750 
reboots into recovery which it did not
so<00:03:09.680> we'll<00:03:09.890> go<00:03:10.040> ahead<00:03:10.070> and<00:03:10.340> reboot<00:03:10.610> it

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:10.760 
so we'll go ahead and reboot it

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.910 
so we'll go ahead and reboot it
ourselves<00:03:11.000> in<00:03:11.450> the<00:03:11.540> recovery<00:03:11.900> just<00:03:12.650> select
