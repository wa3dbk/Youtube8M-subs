feet of copper tubing I wrapped one

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.870 
feet of copper tubing I wrapped one
around<00:00:32.470> a<00:00:32.619> 1<00:00:32.770> inch<00:00:32.950> pipe<00:00:33.190> and<00:00:33.460> wrapped<00:00:33.580> another

around a piece of inch and a half ABS I

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:41.120 
around a piece of inch and a half ABS I
can't<00:00:38.770> see<00:00:39.100> it<00:00:39.250> so<00:00:39.430> oh<00:00:39.910> here<00:00:40.330> it<00:00:40.390> is

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.130 
can't see it so oh here it is

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.360 
can't see it so oh here it is
it's<00:00:42.130> and<00:00:42.280> a<00:00:42.310> half<00:00:42.430> abs<00:00:43.650> for<00:00:44.650> the<00:00:44.770> large<00:00:44.950> coil

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:45.370 
it's and a half abs for the large coil

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:50.310

really<00:00:50.890> well<00:00:51.070> all<00:00:51.220> you<00:00:51.310> need<00:00:51.430> to<00:00:51.490> do<00:00:51.610> to<00:00:51.760> avoid

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:51.880 
really well all you need to do to avoid

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:56.340 
really well all you need to do to avoid
kinks<00:00:52.630> is<00:00:53.130> maintain<00:00:54.480> tensile<00:00:55.480> pressure<00:00:55.780> so<00:00:56.230> it

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
kinks is maintain tensile pressure so it

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.069 
kinks is maintain tensile pressure so it
has<00:00:56.530> your<00:00:56.680> wrap<00:00:56.950> in<00:00:57.190> it<00:00:57.310> you<00:00:57.400> need<00:00:57.520> to<00:00:57.640> pull

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
has your wrap in it you need to pull

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.210 
has your wrap in it you need to pull
really<00:00:59.079> hard<00:00:59.230> like<00:00:59.710> you're<00:00:59.860> trying<00:01:00.040> to

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:00.220 
really hard like you're trying to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.330 
really hard like you're trying to
stretch<00:01:00.610> the<00:01:00.880> copper<00:01:01.530> and<00:01:02.530> that<00:01:02.590> will<00:01:03.040> avoid

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:03.340 
stretch the copper and that will avoid

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.470 
stretch the copper and that will avoid
kinks<00:01:03.910> like<00:01:03.940> you<00:01:04.239> see<00:01:04.449> right<00:01:04.870> there

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:06.480 
kinks like you see right there

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:09.120 
kinks like you see right there
anywho<00:01:07.480> I<00:01:07.720> did<00:01:07.990> my<00:01:08.140> best<00:01:08.290> to<00:01:08.440> keep<00:01:08.680> them<00:01:08.920> from

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
anywho I did my best to keep them from

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.700 
anywho I did my best to keep them from
touching<00:01:09.370> to<00:01:10.240> avoid<00:01:10.480> rubbing<00:01:10.780> and<00:01:11.200> and

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
touching to avoid rubbing and and

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.690 
touching to avoid rubbing and and
wearing<00:01:12.480> put<00:01:13.480> them<00:01:13.659> through<00:01:13.900> the<00:01:13.990> lid<00:01:14.700> stick

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:15.700 
wearing put them through the lid stick

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.640 
wearing put them through the lid stick
this<00:01:15.880> thing<00:01:16.090> in<00:01:16.300> here<00:01:16.630> now<00:01:17.140> I'm<00:01:17.229> going<00:01:17.350> to<00:01:17.409> fill

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:17.650 
this thing in here now I'm going to fill

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.050 
this thing in here now I'm going to fill
this<00:01:17.680> with<00:01:18.510> antifreeze<00:01:19.510> and<00:01:19.780> water<00:01:21.060> just

this with antifreeze and water just

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.640 
this with antifreeze and water just
enough<00:01:22.300> any<00:01:22.510> freeze<00:01:22.780> to<00:01:23.020> keep<00:01:23.229> it<00:01:23.380> above<00:01:23.590> the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:32.890 
water freezes obviously as far as

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:36.300 
water freezes obviously as far as
corrosion<00:01:33.610> issues<00:01:34.060> it's<00:01:34.750> copper<00:01:35.290> that's<00:01:36.220> a

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:36.310 
corrosion issues it's copper that's a

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.250 
corrosion issues it's copper that's a
pink<00:01:36.549> in<00:01:36.760> water<00:01:37.510> it's<00:01:37.690> not<00:01:37.720> going<00:01:37.990> to<00:01:38.049> corrode

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:38.260 
pink in water it's not going to corrode

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.710 
pink in water it's not going to corrode
that<00:01:39.000> long-term<00:01:40.000> you'd<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.360> to<00:01:40.450> be<00:01:40.540> more

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:40.720 
that long-term you'd have to be more

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:42.420 
that long-term you'd have to be more
careful<00:01:41.170> with<00:01:41.290> copper<00:01:41.680> on<00:01:41.799> different<00:01:42.159> or

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:42.430 
careful with copper on different or

water on different you know surfaces and
obviously<00:01:48.070> one<00:01:48.400> of<00:01:48.430> these<00:01:48.610> coils<00:01:49.020> I'm<00:01:50.020> going

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
obviously one of these coils I'm going

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.910 
obviously one of these coils I'm going
to<00:01:50.200> bring<00:01:50.380> the<00:01:50.880> liquid<00:01:51.880> gas<00:01:52.180> line<00:01:52.750> in<00:01:53.380> and<00:01:53.799> out

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:53.920 
to bring the liquid gas line in and out

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.179 
to bring the liquid gas line in and out
through<00:01:54.310> here<00:01:54.580> and<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.869> my<00:01:55.960> heat<00:01:56.260> I'm<00:01:57.040> going

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:57.189 
through here and for my heat I'm going

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.510 
through here and for my heat I'm going
to<00:01:57.250> come<00:01:57.400> off<00:01:57.580> the<00:01:57.610> exhaust<00:01:58.210> manifold<00:01:58.990> port

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
to come off the exhaust manifold port

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:03.450 
to come off the exhaust manifold port
which<00:02:00.520> goes<00:02:00.760> to<00:02:00.970> the

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
recycling or the emission gas returned

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:16.229 
recycling or the emission gas returned
as<00:02:12.340> I<00:02:13.260> meant<00:02:14.260> to<00:02:14.380> say<00:02:14.670> I'm<00:02:15.670> actually<00:02:15.910> going<00:02:16.180> to

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
as I meant to say I'm actually going to

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:17.550 
as I meant to say I'm actually going to
tee<00:02:16.480> off<00:02:16.750> of<00:02:16.959> that<00:02:17.080> line

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
tee off of that line

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.190 
tee off of that line
so<00:02:18.400> that<00:02:18.670> when<00:02:19.180> they<00:02:19.300> still<00:02:19.569> annoyed<00:02:19.840> for<00:02:20.080> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
so that when they still annoyed for the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.100 
so that when they still annoyed for the
engine<00:02:20.530> opens<00:02:21.069> and<00:02:21.489> wants<00:02:22.060> those<00:02:22.330> gases

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
engine opens and wants those gases

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:28.050 
engine opens and wants those gases
during<00:02:24.750> mid-level<00:02:25.750> load<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:27.610> can<00:02:27.760> still

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:28.060 
during mid-level load that can still

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.790 
during mid-level load that can still
allow<00:02:28.420> that<00:02:30.000> so<00:02:31.000> from<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.690> T<00:02:32.019> that's<00:02:32.380> going

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
allow that so from that T that's going

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.809 
allow that so from that T that's going
to<00:02:33.220> the<00:02:33.370> stock<00:02:33.780> emissions<00:02:35.519> one<00:02:36.519> is<00:02:36.640> going<00:02:36.760> to

00:02:36.809 --> 00:02:36.819 
to the stock emissions one is going to

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:40.500

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
of the coils and to come out in order to

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.620 
of the coils and to come out in order to
maintain<00:02:43.620> constant<00:02:44.620> suction<00:02:45.040> will<00:02:45.970> go<00:02:46.180> into<00:02:46.420> a

maintain constant suction will go into a
part<00:02:46.930> of<00:02:47.019> my<00:02:47.170> air<00:02:47.860> intake<00:02:48.400> system<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:50.170> be

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.380 
part of my air intake system and be

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.309 
part of my air intake system and be
filtered<00:02:50.830> before<00:02:51.010> the<00:02:51.310> mass<00:02:51.489> airflow<00:02:51.730> sensor

00:02:52.309 --> 00:02:52.319 
filtered before the mass airflow sensor

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:57.300 
filtered before the mass airflow sensor
and<00:02:53.489> since<00:02:54.489> basically<00:02:55.060> most<00:02:55.480> exhaust<00:02:55.930> gas<00:02:56.349> and

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
and since basically most exhaust gas and

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:01.770 
and since basically most exhaust gas and
as<00:02:57.819> far<00:02:58.090> as<00:02:58.150> combustion<00:02:59.019> is<00:02:59.519> inert<00:03:00.630> so<00:03:01.630> it's

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
as far as combustion is inert so it's

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.570 
as far as combustion is inert so it's
not<00:03:01.930> going<00:03:02.110> to<00:03:02.200> affect<00:03:02.709> the<00:03:03.010> performance<00:03:03.190> of

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
not going to affect the performance of

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.509 
not going to affect the performance of
the<00:03:03.700> engine<00:03:04.769> being<00:03:05.769> pulled<00:03:06.040> in<00:03:06.190> through<00:03:06.370> the

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
the engine being pulled in through the

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:08.849 
the engine being pulled in through the
thought<00:03:07.420> of<00:03:07.570> plate<00:03:07.780> as<00:03:08.019> opposed<00:03:08.440> to<00:03:08.680> a

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:08.859 
thought of plate as opposed to a

00:03:08.859 --> 00:03:13.130 
thought of plate as opposed to a
constant<00:03:09.549> loop<00:03:09.810> or<00:03:10.810> open<00:03:11.260> you<00:03:11.560> know<00:03:11.680> open<00:03:12.670> port

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:13.140 
constant loop or open you know open port

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.080 
constant loop or open you know open port
basically<00:03:14.220> into<00:03:15.220> the<00:03:15.340> throttle<00:03:15.700> body<00:03:15.850> which

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
basically into the throttle body which

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:18.390 
basically into the throttle body which
would<00:03:16.239> cause<00:03:16.390> a<00:03:16.420> leading<00:03:16.870> condition<00:03:17.470> and<00:03:17.709> poor

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:18.400 
would cause a leading condition and poor

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:21.809 
would cause a leading condition and poor
island<00:03:18.880> and<00:03:19.030> engine<00:03:19.329> performance<00:03:20.190> so<00:03:21.190> this<00:03:21.519> is

00:03:21.809 --> 00:03:21.819 
island and engine performance so this is

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:23.789 
island and engine performance so this is
one<00:03:21.970> experiment<00:03:22.420> and<00:03:22.840> I'm<00:03:23.140> probably<00:03:23.500> going<00:03:23.739> to

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
one experiment and I'm probably going to

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:26.700 
one experiment and I'm probably going to
get<00:03:23.890> it<00:03:24.040> hooked<00:03:24.130> up<00:03:24.340> tonight
