then<00:01:22.920> we're<00:01:23.100> going<00:01:23.250> to<00:01:23.369> bump<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> a<00:01:24.360> little

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
then we're going to bump it a little

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.719 
then we're going to bump it a little
here<00:01:26.420> curve<00:01:27.420> it<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.189> then<00:01:29.189> we're<00:01:29.430> going<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.640> be

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
here curve it and then we're going to be

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:32.840 
here curve it and then we're going to be
getting<00:01:29.909> disability<00:01:30.860> each<00:01:31.860> or<00:01:32.280> spends<00:01:32.610> in<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:32.850 
getting disability each or spends in the

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.289 
getting disability each or spends in the
way<00:01:32.990> we<00:01:33.990> getting<00:01:34.290> this<00:01:34.409> bone<00:01:35.030> it's<00:01:36.030> going<00:01:36.240> to

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
way we getting this bone it's going to

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.609 
way we getting this bone it's going to
be<00:01:36.960> right<00:01:37.140> here<00:01:37.170> okay<00:01:39.290> next<00:01:40.290> we're<00:01:40.470> going<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
be right here okay next we're going to

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:44.510 
be right here okay next we're going to
do<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.860> other<00:01:41.009> side<00:01:41.400> the<00:01:42.210> deltoid<00:01:43.340> it's<00:01:44.340> going

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
do the other side the deltoid it's going

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.200 
do the other side the deltoid it's going
to<00:01:44.549> be<00:01:44.670> a<00:01:44.700> curve<00:01:44.939> like<00:01:45.180> that<00:01:45.210> you<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.200> see<00:01:46.439> it

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 
to be a curve like that you can see it

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:53.270 
to be a curve like that you can see it
probably<00:01:48.210> have<00:01:48.299> to<00:01:48.390> armpit<00:01:50.270> go<00:01:51.270> down<00:01:52.280> it's

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
probably have to armpit go down it's

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.590 
probably have to armpit go down it's
making<00:01:53.729> the<00:01:53.790> triceps

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:07.340 

side<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.810> tricep<00:02:00.830> okay<00:02:02.150> Nick<00:02:03.150> of<00:02:03.390> that<00:02:06.350> and

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
side of the tricep okay Nick of that and

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:14.510 
side of the tricep okay Nick of that and
we're<00:02:07.920> going<00:02:08.070> to<00:02:08.100> make<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.610> video<00:02:13.280> clip<00:02:14.280> that

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:14.520 
we're going to make the video clip that

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.820 
we're going to make the video clip that
here<00:02:15.230> pretty<00:02:16.230> much<00:02:16.290> go<00:02:16.530> down<00:02:17.360> and<00:02:18.360> then<00:02:18.800> make<00:02:19.800> a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:19.830 
here pretty much go down and then make a

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.740 
here pretty much go down and then make a
curve<00:02:20.100> down<00:02:20.340> here<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:22.230> it's<00:02:22.560> cars<00:02:23.010> and<00:02:23.750> curve

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:24.750 
curve down here so it's cars and curve

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.070 
curve down here so it's cars and curve
out<00:02:25.280> wide<00:02:26.280> in<00:02:27.110> curve<00:02:28.110> out<00:02:28.320> wider<00:02:29.130> line<00:02:29.490> and

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
out wide in curve out wider line and

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:36.010 
out wide in curve out wider line and
small<00:02:31.080> curve<00:02:32.960> okie<00:02:33.960> dokie<00:02:34.320> outline<00:02:34.950> curve

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
small curve okie dokie outline curve

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.290 
small curve okie dokie outline curve
like<00:02:37.020> make<00:02:37.200> a<00:02:37.230> cloud<00:02:37.500> curve<00:02:37.920> in<00:02:38.220> curve<00:02:38.970> in

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
like make a cloud curve in curve in

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.440 
like make a cloud curve in curve in
curves<00:02:40.260> and<00:02:40.800> curve<00:02:41.730> in<00:02:42.180> turf<00:02:43.370> Yogi<00:02:44.450> and

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
curves and curve in turf Yogi and

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.870 
curves and curve in turf Yogi and
curving<00:02:46.230> curve<00:02:46.530> into<00:02:47.130> vinegar<00:02:49.610> now<00:02:50.610> we're

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
curving curve into vinegar now we're

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.260 
curving curve into vinegar now we're
going<00:02:51.060> to<00:02:51.150> make<00:02:51.450> things<00:02:51.630> uh<00:02:51.900> oh<00:02:52.530> come<00:02:53.459> on<00:02:54.380> elbow

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
going to make things uh oh come on elbow

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.460 
going to make things uh oh come on elbow
we're<00:02:57.270> just<00:02:57.360> going<00:02:57.540> to<00:02:57.630> make<00:02:57.690> a<00:02:57.750> little<00:02:58.020> thing

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
we're just going to make a little thing

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:01.820 
we're just going to make a little thing
there<00:02:58.709> for<00:02:58.980> the<00:02:59.040> elbow<00:02:59.340> bone<00:03:00.620> then<00:03:01.620> I<00:03:01.680> got

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
there for the elbow bone then I got

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:05.030 
there for the elbow bone then I got

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:37.299 

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:45.660 

follow<00:03:38.299> the<00:03:38.510> muscle<00:03:38.840> under<00:03:41.349> get<00:03:42.349> some<00:03:42.590> shading

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:49.990 

 here<00:03:47.829> run<00:03:48.829> your<00:03:48.980> finger<00:03:49.340> along<00:03:49.459> it<00:03:49.849> to

there's got to be some shading over here

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:42.520 
there's got to be some shading over here
and<00:04:33.229> decide<00:04:33.680> um<00:04:38.380> get<00:04:39.380> the<00:04:39.680> flexor<00:04:40.490> carpi<00:04:41.530> were
