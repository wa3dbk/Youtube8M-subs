00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
it to the boys and it didn't really seem

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.020 
it to the boys and it didn't really seem
to<00:01:39.840> affect<00:01:40.320> them<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> whole<00:01:40.770> lot<00:01:40.829> did<00:01:41.759> you<00:01:41.880> think

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
to affect them a whole lot did you think

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.280 
to affect them a whole lot did you think
so<00:01:43.909> they<00:01:44.909> roll<00:01:45.090> in<00:01:45.210> everything<00:01:45.750> I<00:01:46.020> mean<00:01:46.229> I

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
so they roll in everything I mean I

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.160 
so they roll in everything I mean I
don't<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.920> it<00:01:47.130> might<00:01:47.549> work<00:01:48.000> maybe<00:01:48.360> they<00:01:48.899> need

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:49.170 
don't know it might work maybe they need

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:51.050 
don't know it might work maybe they need
something<00:01:49.590> more<00:01:49.920> than<00:01:50.130> just<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.549> little<00:01:50.790> tips

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
something more than just the little tips

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.280 
something more than just the little tips
or<00:01:51.270> something<00:01:51.450> maybe<00:01:51.689> we're<00:01:51.840> gonna<00:01:51.930> wait<00:01:52.140> till

been subconsciously avoiding showing

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:53.960 
been subconsciously avoiding showing
much<00:02:51.599> of<00:02:51.750> the<00:02:51.870> kitchen<00:02:52.230> in<00:02:53.220> videos<00:02:53.579> because

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
much of the kitchen in videos because

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.120 
much of the kitchen in videos because
it's<00:02:54.150> look<00:02:54.690> like<00:02:54.720> a<00:02:54.930> bomb<00:02:55.110> went<00:02:55.349> off<00:02:55.380> we<00:02:55.980> got

it's look like a bomb went off we got
the<00:02:56.220> kitchen<00:02:56.370> clean<00:02:56.700> we're<00:02:57.180> starting<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.870> get

00:02:57.949 --> 00:02:57.959 
the kitchen clean we're starting to get

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.770 
the kitchen clean we're starting to get
this<00:02:58.140> part<00:02:58.549> clean<00:02:59.549> just<00:02:59.849> because<00:03:00.150> stuff<00:03:00.660> was

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
this part clean just because stuff was

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.890 
this part clean just because stuff was
just<00:03:00.959> like<00:03:01.049> piled<00:03:01.530> up<00:03:01.709> everywhere<00:03:01.950> and<00:03:02.900> it's

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900 
just like piled up everywhere and it's

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.110 
just like piled up everywhere and it's
it's<00:03:04.560> bad<00:03:04.860> it's<00:03:05.099> not<00:03:05.220> only<00:03:05.400> bad<00:03:05.610> because<00:03:05.970> it's

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
it's bad it's not only bad because it's

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.819 
it's bad it's not only bad because it's
hard<00:03:06.269> to<00:03:06.299> find<00:03:06.480> stuff<00:03:06.750> and<00:03:06.780> it's<00:03:07.079> gross<00:03:07.290> but

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
hard to find stuff and it's gross but

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:09.860 
hard to find stuff and it's gross but
it's<00:03:08.010> also<00:03:08.160> bad<00:03:08.459> because<00:03:08.880> if<00:03:09.180> you<00:03:09.329> have<00:03:09.510> stuff

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
it's also bad because if you have stuff

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.449 
it's also bad because if you have stuff
sitting<00:03:10.410> around<00:03:10.590> like<00:03:10.769> if<00:03:10.890> your<00:03:11.069> place<00:03:11.280> is

00:03:11.449 --> 00:03:11.459 
sitting around like if your place is

00:03:11.459 --> 00:03:13.699 
sitting around like if your place is
junky<00:03:11.910> you<00:03:12.569> have<00:03:12.660> crap<00:03:12.900> everywhere<00:03:13.170> it's

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:13.709 
junky you have crap everywhere it's

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:15.500 
junky you have crap everywhere it's
actually<00:03:14.069> really<00:03:14.310> hard<00:03:14.610> to<00:03:14.819> keep<00:03:15.000> a<00:03:15.269> clear

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
actually really hard to keep a clear

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.210 
actually really hard to keep a clear
head<00:03:15.540> and<00:03:15.870> I<00:03:16.079> know<00:03:16.200> that<00:03:16.349> sounds<00:03:16.620> strange<00:03:16.799> but

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
head and I know that sounds strange but

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.610 
head and I know that sounds strange but
when<00:03:17.730> you<00:03:17.790> have<00:03:17.880> stuff<00:03:18.060> piled<00:03:18.329> up<00:03:18.480> everywhere

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:18.620 
when you have stuff piled up everywhere

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:22.610 
when you have stuff piled up everywhere
especially<00:03:19.620> like<00:03:20.609> working<00:03:21.060> at<00:03:21.150> home<00:03:21.620> it's
