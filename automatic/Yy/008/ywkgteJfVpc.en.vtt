00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:10.920
 hello to all and we all find ourselves 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.780
 to talk about an exotic contract so 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.429
 the contract to get the shotgun 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.780
 a workforce that is very pretty but who 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.279
 remains a shotgun so it stays 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.770
 anecdotal to a contract 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.119
 to have for example thistle but 

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.590
 it's always good to take 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.779
 but I really find the man very 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.810
 very pretty very successful at the visual level 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:30.420
 at least so the contract is called 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.009
 in a dubious fight and so the first 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.500
 step of this contract is going to be to achieve 

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.329
 five assaults without dying so that's 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.980
 pretty simple so the assaults it's going to be 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.960
 the onslaught on the vanguard 

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.579
 that will count, so of course you 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.379
 want to achieve at the difficulty level the 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:45.120
 lower if you want to be sure of yourself 

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:46.460
 I still did them antique 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.500
 the avangard to be sure to have 

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:52.020
 to have years g simply 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.300
 famous precious commodity on the g 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.199
 destiny so once your five to 

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.969
 achieve 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.989
 you will go back to see cora it's 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.489
 true he will have seven characters 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.609
 recurring contract which is therefore at 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.989
 level 2 of the avant-garde where goes in 

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.939
 all the beginning of the story 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.680
 so then the second step that makes 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.900
 very scared but actually it's okay 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.820
 which is to have a frag distribution 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.060
 death of 25 in pvp 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:16.650
 on the spot we say wow I am 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.700
 not able to make a ratio of 25 years 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.680
 later I tell you right now 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.460
 I can make good ratios but 25 

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.380
 still have to go 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.630
 unless you camp but in fact it's not 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.130
 so that it works it's more 

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:28.560
 more points in plus or minus 1 point 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.320
 Well, it's like that and it's actually 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.240
 if you make series in your in 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.220
 your matches very quickly in three 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.590
 four parts you make series of 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.000
 45 and here are things like that 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.130
 quite achievable things of the coup 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.500
 you will succeed this stage of 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.420
 contract in fact so it accumulates ceded 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.490
 cumulative points in the end did not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.200
 not a distribution of 25 cm to 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.369
 the explicitness we are quite 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.899
 feasible I know there are people who 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:53.880
 have outright removed the contract to 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.259
 Because of that, you must not have to 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.880
 not be afraid of this step she is 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.860
 quite achievable if you do 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.290
 a few series of course against will 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.259
 to avoid dying in series is 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.790
 there the counterpart re and so blow to 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.220
 the penultimate step which is to 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 achieve 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.340
 it's an event related to the events of 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.810
 the week so me it was already past 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.730
 like a hervé coach this step it's 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.350
 pity I had already realized the 

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.180
 events of the week but so these 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:18.100
 epic assaults of the week and aso night 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:20.380
 black you one of two and that 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.060
 validate this step you expect a 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.460
 week like me too if you are 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.280
 have it and the very last step 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:29.950
 who is going to buy 50 cartridges of 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.210
 special ammunition to the gunsmith so 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.520
 you know the magazine nothing about the 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.860
 right next to the crip later than at the level 

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.870
 of the tower so what will cost you the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.330
 blow each cartridge cost of 250 lumens 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.820
 so it's going to cost a total of 2500 lumens 

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:43.840
 that's okay knowing he does not 

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:45.850
 do not make the same mistake as me 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.730
 the special weapons cartridges of the 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.360
 special ammunition céline verte 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.980
 personally I got a little 

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:52.270
 packed I bought the roses the 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.320
 heavy weapon cartridges that in addition 

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:55.480
 costs a little more expensive 

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:56.890
 So I had to go train for Lille 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.720
 human since I had everything to spend 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:00.400
 before I realize my stupidity 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.870
 so for the lumens of the shot what I 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.190
 do you advise me what I did there 

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.110
 are a lot of women's curls that 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:07.209
 exists one is pretty simple me I'm 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.280
 went to the place my women's loop of 

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.540
 Venus you can see the video in my 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:12.459
 old videos if you want to see where 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.989
 is it and so simply 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.910
 I activated what allows me to have 

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:17.800
 more of him even when I kill some vexes 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.209
 and I chained the bishop that was enough 

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.489
 simple I am very quickly go up high 

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.530
 at the human el level so here is so 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:25.510
 is normally arriving at this stage 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:27.190
 you are going to have insulted you are 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.630
 very happy I think it's a 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.310
 very easy contract anyway it's a 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:31.989
 easy contract to realize 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.489
 it's so much better so I'll tell you 

00:03:31.989 --> 00:03:35.049
 advise if you do not want to lose 

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:36.580
 time of course it's not the contract the 

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.590
 more profitable at the level of tears than 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:40.630
 you get but at least you 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.489
 are sure you can succeed and that it's okay 

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.690
 you're not blocking a contract location 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.890
 even though now we've gone to ten 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.980
 locations will count so that's when 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:50.080
 even simpler and so I hope it 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.280
 you have been useful and I find you 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.459
 very quickly on the channel for others 

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:53.459
