this plant but what I want to know is
this<00:05:11.330> is<00:05:11.390> a<00:05:11.600> fertilizer<00:05:12.170> so<00:05:12.770> won't<00:05:13.040> this<00:05:13.280> end

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:13.550 
this is a fertilizer so won't this end

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:15.400 
this is a fertilizer so won't this end
up<00:05:13.820> down<00:05:14.150> in<00:05:14.180> the<00:05:14.330> sound<00:05:14.630> causing<00:05:15.080> trouble

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
up down in the sound causing trouble

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:18.250 
up down in the sound causing trouble
that's<00:05:16.070> a<00:05:16.250> really<00:05:16.550> good<00:05:16.730> question<00:05:16.840> but<00:05:17.840> this

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:18.260 
that's a really good question but this

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:20.800 
that's a really good question but this
has<00:05:18.530> worked<00:05:18.770> into<00:05:19.250> the<00:05:19.370> soil<00:05:19.669> so<00:05:20.450> it's<00:05:20.600> not

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:20.810 
has worked into the soil so it's not

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.840 
has worked into the soil so it's not
going<00:05:21.080> to<00:05:21.140> run<00:05:21.350> off<00:05:21.380> it's<00:05:22.190> not<00:05:22.430> like<00:05:22.640> you're

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:22.850 
going to run off it's not like you're

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.490 
going to run off it's not like you're
throwing<00:05:23.120> a<00:05:23.180> bunch<00:05:23.330> of<00:05:23.510> synthetic<00:05:24.050> fertilizer

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:24.500 
throwing a bunch of synthetic fertilizer

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:26.140 
throwing a bunch of synthetic fertilizer
that<00:05:24.650> could<00:05:24.950> reach<00:05:25.190> down<00:05:25.520> into<00:05:25.760> the<00:05:25.970> water

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
that could reach down into the water

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.600 
that could reach down into the water
cable<00:05:26.600> or<00:05:26.870> runoff<00:05:27.080> you<00:05:27.800> know<00:05:27.919> it<00:05:28.160> breaks<00:05:28.460> down

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:28.610 
cable or runoff you know it breaks down

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.180 
cable or runoff you know it breaks down
very<00:05:28.760> slowly<00:05:29.450> so<00:05:29.720> the<00:05:30.050> chance<00:05:30.380> of<00:05:30.560> any<00:05:30.860> of<00:05:31.040> this

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.190 
very slowly so the chance of any of this

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:32.740 
very slowly so the chance of any of this
getting<00:05:31.490> into<00:05:31.790> the<00:05:31.910> sound<00:05:32.120> it's<00:05:32.330> just<00:05:32.570> about

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
getting into the sound it's just about

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.690 
getting into the sound it's just about
nothing<00:05:33.020> at<00:05:33.380> all<00:05:33.560> excellent<00:05:34.130> once<00:05:34.520> and

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:34.700 
nothing at all excellent once and

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:36.490 
nothing at all excellent once and
establishes<00:05:35.240> those<00:05:35.390> big<00:05:35.660> ruts<00:05:35.930> I<00:05:36.110> don't<00:05:36.440> think

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:36.500 
establishes those big ruts I don't think

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:38.110 
establishes those big ruts I don't think
you'll<00:05:36.770> ever<00:05:37.040> have<00:05:37.370> to<00:05:37.550> water<00:05:37.790> this<00:05:38.060> plant

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
you'll ever have to water this plant

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.230 
you'll ever have to water this plant
again<00:05:38.840> oh<00:05:39.080> la<00:05:39.500> la<00:05:39.740> oh<00:05:40.010> that<00:05:40.520> is<00:05:40.669> my<00:05:40.850> kind<00:05:41.090> of
