00:00:01.129 --> 00:00:04.430 

this<00:00:02.129> is<00:00:02.399> a<00:00:02.429> series<00:00:03.179> of<00:00:03.210> bite<00:00:03.689> wings<00:00:03.959> of<00:00:04.170> one

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:04.440 
this is a series of bite wings of one

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.059 
this is a series of bite wings of one
patient<00:00:05.960> vertical<00:00:06.960> bite<00:00:07.140> wings<00:00:07.440> taken<00:00:07.919> with<00:00:08.040> a

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
patient vertical bite wings taken with a

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.030 
patient vertical bite wings taken with a
ring<00:00:08.340> system<00:00:08.929> and<00:00:09.929> you<00:00:10.139> can<00:00:10.349> see<00:00:13.040> it's

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
ring system and you can see it's

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.799 
ring system and you can see it's
projecting<00:00:14.670> up<00:00:14.790> on<00:00:14.940> the<00:00:15.030> screen

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
projecting up on the screen

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.849 
projecting up on the screen
there's<00:00:16.680> decay<00:00:17.100> in<00:00:17.160> this<00:00:17.550> area<00:00:17.970> is<00:00:18.060> very

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:18.859 
there's decay in this area is very

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.519 
there's decay in this area is very
significant<00:00:19.939> and<00:00:20.960> when<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.109> look<00:00:22.289> at<00:00:22.410> the

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
significant and when we look at the

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.340 
significant and when we look at the
other<00:00:22.680> areas<00:00:23.519> of<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:23.820> mouth<00:00:24.289> there's<00:00:25.289> a

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
other areas of the mouth there's a

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.349 
other areas of the mouth there's a
little<00:00:25.619> bit<00:00:25.800> of<00:00:25.890> grain<00:00:26.130> is<00:00:26.369> here<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.210> it's

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
little bit of grain is here but it's

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.060 
little bit of grain is here but it's
near<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.630> cement<00:00:28.230> of<00:00:28.349> this<00:00:28.529> ground<00:00:28.859> that's

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.070 
near the cement of this ground that's

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.440 
near the cement of this ground that's
been<00:00:29.810> placed<00:00:31.189> there's<00:00:32.189> still<00:00:32.730> some<00:00:33.000> grain<00:00:33.270> is

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
been placed there's still some grain is

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.139 
been placed there's still some grain is
here<00:00:33.750> but<00:00:33.899> they<00:00:34.020> could<00:00:34.200> be<00:00:34.230> cement<00:00:34.739> as<00:00:34.890> well

00:00:35.139 --> 00:00:35.149 
here but they could be cement as well

00:00:35.149 --> 00:00:39.280 
here but they could be cement as well
and<00:00:36.149> so<00:00:37.079> that's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.710> projection<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.640> that<00:00:38.700> one

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:39.290 
and so that's a projection of that one

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:44.180 
and so that's a projection of that one
tooth<00:00:40.290> number<00:00:40.680> 19<00:00:41.510> now<00:00:42.510> the<00:00:42.570> other<00:00:42.870> x-rays<00:00:43.559> for

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
tooth number 19 now the other x-rays for

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:52.550 
tooth number 19 now the other x-rays for
the<00:00:44.340> station

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:52.560 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.310 

here's

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.630 

the

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
the

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.090 
the
x-rays<00:00:58.640> a<00:00:58.670> little<00:00:59.000> further<00:00:59.180> forward<00:00:59.840> you<00:01:00.830> see

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:01.100 
x-rays a little further forward you see

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.780 
x-rays a little further forward you see
where<00:01:01.430> that<00:01:01.490> big<00:01:01.610> hole<00:01:02.000> was<00:01:02.180> on<00:01:02.360> 19<00:01:03.520> see<00:01:04.520> this

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
where that big hole was on 19 see this

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.170 
where that big hole was on 19 see this
is<00:01:05.750> where<00:01:05.990> there<00:01:06.200> was<00:01:06.320> a<00:01:06.350> time<00:01:06.770> line<00:01:07.130> with<00:01:07.910> some

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:08.180 
is where there was a time line with some

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:10.319 
is where there was a time line with some
sort<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.630> deep<00:01:08.900> filling<00:01:09.440> the<00:01:09.650> air

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:10.329 
sort of deep filling the air

00:01:10.329 --> 00:01:13.260 
sort of deep filling the air
in<00:01:10.719> this<00:01:10.899> brain<00:01:11.200> is<00:01:11.380> all<00:01:11.590> seems<00:01:12.399> to<00:01:12.579> be<00:01:12.729> mixed

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
in this brain is all seems to be mixed

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:18.510 
in this brain is all seems to be mixed
in<00:01:14.070> x-rays<00:01:15.960> the<00:01:16.960> ability<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> read<00:01:17.530> x-rays<00:01:18.189> is

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:18.520 
in x-rays the ability to read x-rays is

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.370 
in x-rays the ability to read x-rays is
to<00:01:19.299> be<00:01:19.780> able<00:01:19.960> to<00:01:21.450> see<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:22.630> different<00:01:22.960> colors

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
to be able to see the different colors

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:28.469 
to be able to see the different colors
of<00:01:23.729> grey

00:01:28.469 --> 00:01:28.479 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.050 

the<00:01:28.960> other<00:01:29.140> side

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.550 

looks<00:01:33.690> like<00:01:33.990> this<00:01:34.790> and<00:01:35.790> you<00:01:36.660> have<00:01:36.690> the<00:01:37.170> upper

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
looks like this and you have the upper

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.300 
looks like this and you have the upper
ride

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.440 

see<00:01:40.460> where<00:01:40.670> there's<00:01:40.850> been<00:01:41.000> some<00:01:41.240> more

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:41.450 
see where there's been some more

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.080 
see where there's been some more
felonies<00:01:42.020> actually

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:44.090 
felonies actually

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:48.050 
felonies actually
and<00:01:45.090> here<00:01:45.480> it's<00:01:45.660> darker<00:01:46.290> and<00:01:46.590> there<00:01:47.400> is<00:01:47.550> darker

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
and here it's darker and there is darker

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.150 
and here it's darker and there is darker
and<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.840> you<00:01:48.930> think<00:01:49.140> in<00:01:49.290> terms<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> there's<00:01:50.010> the

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 
and so you think in terms of there's the

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.070 
and so you think in terms of there's the
K<00:01:50.370> there<00:01:50.670> this<00:01:50.910> is<00:01:51.120> a<00:01:51.150> crown<00:01:51.540> that<00:01:51.570> was<00:01:52.020> done

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
K there this is a crown that was done

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.010 
K there this is a crown that was done
need<00:01:53.260> some<00:01:53.530> spacing<00:01:54.250> there<00:01:54.630> then<00:01:55.630> you<00:01:55.780> have

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:56.020 
need some spacing there then you have

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.910 
need some spacing there then you have
the<00:01:56.770> other<00:01:57.010> work<00:01:57.340> that's<00:01:58.090> been<00:01:58.420> down<00:01:58.660> below<00:01:59.620> I

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
the other work that's been down below I

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:09.919 
the other work that's been down below I
have<00:02:00.280> to<00:02:00.520> number<00:02:00.730> 29<00:02:01.330> and<00:02:01.360> 30<00:02:03.090> final<00:02:04.090> x-ray

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.979 

there's<00:02:10.349> a<00:02:10.409> little<00:02:10.590> further<00:02:10.890> back<00:02:11.780> of<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
there's a little further back of the

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:18.470 
there's a little further back of the
same<00:02:13.260> area

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.620 

3031<00:02:19.560> here's<00:02:20.560> the<00:02:21.010> area

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:22.630 
3031 here's the area

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.300 
3031 here's the area
we're<00:02:22.780> different<00:02:22.930> annual<00:02:23.410> list<00:02:23.590> multi<00:02:24.010> B<00:02:24.160> is

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
we're different annual list multi B is

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.250 
we're different annual list multi B is
dark<00:02:24.640> but<00:02:25.360> there's<00:02:25.600> still<00:02:25.780> some<00:02:25.990> darkness

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
dark but there's still some darkness

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.190 
dark but there's still some darkness
there

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
there

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.260 
there
this<00:02:27.709> realm

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.440 

this<00:02:30.870> place<00:02:31.110> there<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.700> those<00:02:32.880> are<00:02:33.030> the<00:02:33.120> x-rays

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
this place there so those are the x-rays

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:40.610 
this place there so those are the x-rays
for<00:02:35.360> this<00:02:36.360> patient<00:02:37.700> and<00:02:38.700> we<00:02:39.240> decide<00:02:40.230> what<00:02:40.500> to

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
for this patient and we decide what to

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.640 
for this patient and we decide what to
do<00:02:41.030> normally<00:02:42.030> you<00:02:42.480> would<00:02:42.630> go<00:02:42.810> to<00:02:43.140> the<00:02:43.260> largest

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
do normally you would go to the largest

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.760 
do normally you would go to the largest
area<00:02:44.190> decay<00:02:45.180> there<00:02:45.450> at<00:02:45.540> first<00:02:45.750> which<00:02:46.470> is<00:02:46.620> two

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
area decay there at first which is two

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:55.760 
area decay there at first which is two
number

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:55.770
