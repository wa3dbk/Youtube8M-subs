microwave<00:01:10.530> ovens<00:01:10.860> don't<00:01:11.580> require<00:01:11.970> a

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
microwave ovens don't require a

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:15.140 
microwave ovens don't require a
turntable<00:01:13.229> this<00:01:14.159> means<00:01:14.430> you<00:01:14.520> can<00:01:14.610> use<00:01:14.880> large

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
turntable this means you can use large

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.760 
turntable this means you can use large
square<00:01:15.570> dishes<00:01:15.960> as<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.350> microwaves

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
square dishes as the microwaves

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.679 
square dishes as the microwaves
themselves<00:01:17.520> spin<00:01:17.759> around<00:01:17.880> inside<00:01:18.299> the<00:01:18.450> cavity

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
themselves spin around inside the cavity

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.440 
themselves spin around inside the cavity
rather<00:01:19.439> than<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> food<00:01:20.009> having<00:01:20.310> to<00:01:20.490> it<00:01:21.150> also

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
rather than the food having to it also

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.090 
rather than the food having to it also
makes<00:01:21.659> the<00:01:21.780> oven<00:01:22.080> much<00:01:22.320> easier<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.890> clean

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
makes the oven much easier to clean

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.020 
makes the oven much easier to clean
there<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.240> so<00:01:24.450> clever<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:25.500> it<00:01:26.189> very<00:01:26.460> simple<00:01:26.820> to

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
there is so clever so it very simple to

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.660 
there is so clever so it very simple to
mentioned<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.320> Panasonic<00:01:28.829> bread<00:01:29.040> maker<00:01:29.340> as

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
mentioned the Panasonic bread maker as

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.300 
mentioned the Panasonic bread maker as
well<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.270> I<00:01:30.659> think<00:01:31.110> it's<00:01:31.530> been<00:01:31.799> recently
