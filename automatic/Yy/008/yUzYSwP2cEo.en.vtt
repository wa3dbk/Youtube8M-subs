00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
I think it's been patched so I wouldn't

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:39.020 
I think it's been patched so I wouldn't
try<00:00:37.530> using<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.520> anymore

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

some sort of video converter to convert
them<00:02:47.130> to<00:02:47.190> this<00:02:47.510> Pacific<00:02:48.510> video<00:02:49.019> file

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
them to this Pacific video file

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.810 
them to this Pacific video file
I<00:02:49.709> think<00:02:50.280> it's<00:02:51.019> WMV<00:02:52.019> yeah<00:02:52.410> there<00:02:52.709> is<00:02:52.830> so<00:02:53.760> you

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:53.820 
I think it's WMV yeah there is so you

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.729 
I think it's WMV yeah there is so you
just<00:02:54.120> you<00:02:54.600> just<00:02:54.630> convert<00:02:55.080> the<00:02:55.230> video<00:02:55.320> so<00:02:55.620> that

00:02:55.729 --> 00:02:55.739 
just you just convert the video so that

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.770 
just you just convert the video so that
you<00:02:55.860> can<00:02:55.980> only<00:02:56.100> use<00:02:56.190> this<00:02:56.760> and<00:02:57.180> I<00:02:57.300> think<00:02:57.480> it's

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
you can only use this and I think it's

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.810 
you can only use this and I think it's
that<00:02:58.019> one<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.769> can<00:02:58.890> only<00:02:58.980> use<00:02:59.250> these<00:02:59.430> for

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that one you can only use these for

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.240 
that one you can only use these for
months<00:03:00.239> as<00:03:01.019> videos<00:03:01.530> on<00:03:01.830> your<00:03:01.950> background

the easiest way to do it as well you can
use<00:03:27.989> any<00:03:28.260> video<00:03:28.590> you<00:03:28.650> want<00:03:28.980> as<00:03:29.190> long<00:03:29.340> as<00:03:29.400> you

00:03:29.539 --> 00:03:29.549 
use any video you want as long as you

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:31.430 
use any video you want as long as you
convert<00:03:29.970> them<00:03:30.209> off<00:03:30.450> there<00:03:30.750> already<00:03:30.959> that<00:03:31.049> you

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
convert them off there already that you

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.750 
convert them off there already that you
know<00:03:31.560> size<00:03:32.420> this<00:03:33.420> is<00:03:33.480> another<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.489> or<00:03:35.489> this<00:03:35.640> is

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:35.760 
know size this is another one or this is

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.220 
know size this is another one or this is
the<00:03:35.910> one<00:03:36.060> I<00:03:36.090> already<00:03:36.360> had<00:03:36.570> but<00:03:36.900> that's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
the one I already had but that's

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.550 
the one I already had but that's
basically<00:03:37.739> it<00:03:38.040> there's<00:03:38.640> another<00:03:38.760> site<00:03:39.150> here
