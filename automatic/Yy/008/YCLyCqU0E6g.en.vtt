three<00:01:34.229> or<00:01:34.350> four<00:01:34.530> items<00:01:34.829> per<00:01:35.369> villager<00:01:35.820> but<00:01:36.270> now

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
three or four items per villager but now

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.630 
three or four items per villager but now

after it's been used 32 15 times so a

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.280 
after it's been used 32 15 times so a
little<00:01:41.820> bit<00:01:42.000> of<00:01:42.150> a<00:01:42.210> nerd<00:01:42.450> the<00:01:42.899> biggest<00:01:43.110> thing

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
little bit of a nerd the biggest thing

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:44.810

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
is that redstone works under stairs now

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.120 
is that redstone works under stairs now
not<00:01:48.180> only<00:01:48.360> that<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.630> also<00:01:48.930> works<00:01:49.290> on<00:01:49.500> upside

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
not only that but also works on upside

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.280 
not only that but also works on upside
down<00:01:50.310> stairs<00:01:50.729> so<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.090> lot<00:01:51.509> of<00:01:51.540> updates<00:01:52.020> when<00:01:52.200> it

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
down stairs so a lot of updates when it

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
comes to redstone and it's gonna make

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.429 
comes to redstone and it's gonna make
things<00:01:53.880> a<00:01:54.180> little<00:01:54.270> bit<00:01:54.420> more<00:01:54.600> compact<00:01:55.079> for<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
things a little bit more compact for you

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.230 
things a little bit more compact for you
I<00:01:55.649> tested<00:01:56.219> it<00:01:56.250> out<00:01:56.399> here<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.729> little<00:01:56.880> bit<00:01:57.090> with

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
I tested it out here a little bit with

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.880 
I tested it out here a little bit with
the<00:01:57.360> normal<00:01:57.750> glowstone<00:01:58.320> that<00:01:58.590> it<00:01:58.680> works

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
the normal glowstone that it works

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.889 
the normal glowstone that it works
through<00:01:59.219> and<00:01:59.430> then<00:01:59.790> I<00:01:59.820> wanted<00:02:00.270> to<00:02:00.390> mostly<00:02:00.659> try

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
through and then I wanted to mostly try

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:02.899 
through and then I wanted to mostly try
the<00:02:00.960> slabs<00:02:01.500> because<00:02:02.040> if<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.250> put<00:02:02.280> one<00:02:02.490> down

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the slabs because if you put one down

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.639 
the slabs because if you put one down
it's<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:03.509> going<00:02:03.689> to<00:02:03.780> work<00:02:03.930> but<00:02:04.259> if<00:02:04.439> you<00:02:04.530> make

00:02:04.639 --> 00:02:04.649 
it's still going to work but if you make

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:06.889 
it's still going to work but if you make
it<00:02:04.799> a<00:02:04.860> double<00:02:05.030> automatically<00:02:06.030> kills<00:02:06.270> it<00:02:06.450> now

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
it a double automatically kills it now

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.180 
it a double automatically kills it now
