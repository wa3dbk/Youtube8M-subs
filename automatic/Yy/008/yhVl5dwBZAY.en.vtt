definitely we are the leaders in the

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.439 
definitely we are the leaders in the
low-power<00:01:02.250> strategy<00:01:02.940> right<00:01:03.149> we've<00:01:03.300> been

00:01:03.439 --> 00:01:03.449 
low-power strategy right we've been

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:04.759 
low-power strategy right we've been
doing<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.719> for<00:01:03.899> five<00:01:04.049> years<00:01:04.350> we've<00:01:04.619> been<00:01:04.710> doing

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
doing it for five years we've been doing

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
doing it for five years we've been doing
smaller<00:01:05.309> form<00:01:06.090> factors<00:01:06.450> for<00:01:06.600> five<00:01:06.840> years

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
smaller form factors for five years

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:09.800 
smaller form factors for five years
we've<00:01:07.350> got<00:01:07.560> that<00:01:07.890> down<00:01:08.220> we<00:01:08.729> the<00:01:09.270> Nano<00:01:09.479> is<00:01:09.720> an

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:09.810 
we've got that down we the Nano is an

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.480 
we've got that down we the Nano is an
out<00:01:09.930> of<00:01:09.960> order<00:01:10.170> architecture<00:01:10.950> it's<00:01:11.189> not<00:01:11.369> an

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
out of order architecture it's not an

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:12.800 
out of order architecture it's not an
inorder<00:01:11.820> architecture<00:01:12.299> like<00:01:12.450> our

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
inorder architecture like our

what's now so right I understand that

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:00.649 
what's now so right I understand that
it's<00:01:59.520> always<00:01:59.820> exciting<00:02:00.060> to<00:02:00.210> hear<00:02:00.390> about<00:02:00.479> the

it's always exciting to hear about the

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.179 
it's always exciting to hear about the
things<00:02:00.840> that<00:02:00.960> are<00:02:01.170> on<00:02:01.350> paper<00:02:01.649> and<00:02:01.860> coming<00:02:02.100> out

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
things that are on paper and coming out

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.380 
things that are on paper and coming out
in<00:02:02.340> the<00:02:02.369> air<00:02:02.549> media<00:02:02.909> so<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.270> of<00:02:03.329> course

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
in the air media so that of course

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.690 
in the air media so that of course
that's<00:02:03.689> always<00:02:04.140> exciting<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:05.189> I<00:02:05.490> think

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
that's always exciting but I think

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.709 
that's always exciting but I think
you're<00:02:05.820> going<00:02:05.909> to<00:02:05.969> see<00:02:06.030> better<00:02:06.390> and<00:02:06.570> better

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
you're going to see better and better

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.180 
you're going to see better and better
graphics<00:02:07.290> you're<00:02:07.409> going<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:07.619> still<00:02:07.799> see<00:02:08.039> that

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
graphics you're going to still see that

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:09.589 
graphics you're going to still see that
as<00:02:08.369> I<00:02:08.399> see<00:02:08.580> the<00:02:08.700> low-power<00:02:09.060> things<00:02:09.420> for<00:02:09.539> the

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
as I see the low-power things for the

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:10.580 
as I see the low-power things for the
battery<00:02:09.899> lights<00:02:10.080> are<00:02:10.200> only<00:02:10.289> going<00:02:10.410> to<00:02:10.500> get

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
battery lights are only going to get

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.770 
battery lights are only going to get
longer<00:02:10.830> there's<00:02:11.430> some<00:02:11.550> great<00:02:11.730> companies<00:02:12.629> out

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
longer there's some great companies out

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:13.550 
longer there's some great companies out
there<00:02:12.810> coming<00:02:13.050> with<00:02:13.230> some

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
there coming with some

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.380 
there coming with some
LCD<00:02:14.099> technologies<00:02:14.819> that<00:02:14.910> are<00:02:14.970> going<00:02:15.120> to<00:02:15.180> drive

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:15.390 
LCD technologies that are going to drive

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:18.290 
LCD technologies that are going to drive
down<00:02:15.660> a<00:02:15.739> battery<00:02:16.739> usage<00:02:17.040> as<00:02:17.190> well<00:02:17.430> so<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.000> think

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
down a battery usage as well so I think

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.570 
down a battery usage as well so I think
with<00:02:19.080> a<00:02:19.110> big<00:02:19.319> focus<00:02:19.470> on<00:02:19.709> mobile<00:02:19.860> like<00:02:20.160> via<00:02:20.340> has

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
with a big focus on mobile like via has

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:21.979 
with a big focus on mobile like via has
all<00:02:20.849> you're<00:02:21.000> going<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.180> see<00:02:21.330> is<00:02:21.480> products<00:02:21.840> that

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
all you're going to see is products that

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.690 
all you're going to see is products that
last<00:02:22.290> longer<00:02:22.650> when<00:02:22.680> they're<00:02:22.890> mobile<00:02:23.190> can<00:02:23.550> have

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:23.700 
last longer when they're mobile can have

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.699 
last longer when they're mobile can have
better<00:02:23.970> performance<00:02:24.209> when<00:02:24.660> their<00:02:24.750> mobile<00:02:25.080> the

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
better performance when their mobile the

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.380 
better performance when their mobile the
form<00:02:25.920> factors<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.520> maturing<00:02:26.819> right<00:02:27.060> now<00:02:27.209> so

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390 
form factors are maturing right now so

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.670 
form factors are maturing right now so
they're<00:02:27.510> very<00:02:27.540> usable<00:02:28.200> now<00:02:28.319> there's<00:02:28.560> no<00:02:28.650> more

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
they're very usable now there's no more

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.910 
they're very usable now there's no more
tiny<00:02:29.010> little<00:02:29.220> tramp<00:02:29.670> keyboards<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.720> think<00:02:31.440> the

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:31.920 
tiny little tramp keyboards I think the

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.710 
tiny little tramp keyboards I think the
pricing<00:02:32.459> seems<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.880> be<00:02:32.970> quite<00:02:33.150> good<00:02:33.420> right<00:02:33.599> now

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
pricing seems to be quite good right now

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.000 
pricing seems to be quite good right now
in<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.900> market<00:02:34.200> so<00:02:34.319> all<00:02:34.470> of<00:02:34.500> those<00:02:34.709> things<00:02:34.769> are
