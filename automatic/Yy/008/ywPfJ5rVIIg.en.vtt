hey guys what's up this is going to be
my<00:00:03.689> video<00:00:04.020> going<00:00:04.319> over<00:00:04.500> a<00:00:04.680> new<00:00:05.069> see<00:00:05.400> a<00:00:05.430> tweak<00:00:05.879> of

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
my video going over a new see a tweak of

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:08.419 
my video going over a new see a tweak of
Zephyr<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:06.899> what<00:00:07.410> Zephyr<00:00:07.770> basically<00:00:08.250> allows

00:00:08.419 --> 00:00:08.429 
Zephyr and what Zephyr basically allows

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:11.629 
Zephyr and what Zephyr basically allows
you<00:00:08.610> to<00:00:08.760> do<00:00:08.910> is<00:00:09.090> have<00:00:09.889> ipad<00:00:10.889> like<00:00:11.190> multitasking

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
you to do is have ipad like multitasking

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.440 
you to do is have ipad like multitasking
gestures<00:00:12.620> on<00:00:13.620> your<00:00:13.860> iphone<00:00:14.309> or<00:00:14.340> ipod<00:00:14.940> touch<00:00:15.210> on

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
gestures on your iphone or ipod touch on

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.340 
gestures on your iphone or ipod touch on
i<00:00:16.020> was<00:00:16.230> 5<00:00:16.560> and<00:00:16.859> above<00:00:17.430> to<00:00:18.240> enable<00:00:18.690> zephyr<00:00:19.140> all

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:19.350 
i was 5 and above to enable zephyr all

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.980 
i was 5 and above to enable zephyr all
you<00:00:19.470> have<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.680> do<00:00:19.859> is<00:00:20.660> enable<00:00:21.660> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
you have to do is enable the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.290 
you have to do is enable the
multitasking<00:00:22.769> gestures<00:00:22.830> from<00:00:23.340> anywhere<00:00:23.850> so

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
multitasking gestures from anywhere so

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.259 
multitasking gestures from anywhere so
for<00:00:24.539> example<00:00:24.600> if<00:00:25.019> i<00:00:25.230> go<00:00:25.380> like<00:00:25.410> this<00:00:26.090> you<00:00:27.090> can

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
for example if i go like this you can

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.140 
for example if i go like this you can
see<00:00:27.480> that<00:00:27.510> it<00:00:27.949> opens<00:00:28.949> up<00:00:29.070> the<00:00:29.220> multitasking

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
see that it opens up the multitasking

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:36.760 
see that it opens up the multitasking
switcher<00:00:30.599> so<00:00:31.080> if<00:00:31.260> i<00:00:31.380> open<00:00:31.560> up<00:00:31.800> the<00:00:32.130> music<00:00:33.059> app

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:36.770 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:40.729 

and<00:00:38.239> if<00:00:39.239> i<00:00:39.390> go<00:00:39.540> into<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.899> music<00:00:40.170> app<00:00:40.469> and<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and if i go into the music app and I

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.650 
and if i go into the music app and I
decide<00:00:41.100> to<00:00:41.129> swipe<00:00:41.579> right<00:00:41.940> into<00:00:42.510> these

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
decide to swipe right into these

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.430 
decide to swipe right into these
settings<00:00:43.079> you<00:00:43.800> can<00:00:43.829> see<00:00:44.219> that<00:00:44.399> it<00:00:44.579> does<00:00:44.879> works

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:45.440 
settings you can see that it does works

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:50.060 
settings you can see that it does works
very<00:00:46.440> simply<00:00:46.860> and<00:00:47.660> you<00:00:48.660> can<00:00:48.809> swipe<00:00:49.200> again<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
very simply and you can swipe again to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.279 
very simply and you can swipe again to
go<00:00:50.430> into<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:50.940> next<00:00:51.120> one<00:00:51.420> that's<00:00:51.899> basically

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
go into the next one that's basically

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:54.560 
go into the next one that's basically
what<00:00:52.530> zephyr<00:00:52.980> does<00:00:53.190> now<00:00:53.820> you<00:00:53.879> also<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.420> a

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
what zephyr does now you also have a

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.930 
what zephyr does now you also have a
settings<00:00:55.110> extension<00:00:55.949> so<00:00:56.460> if<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> go<00:00:56.789> into

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
settings extension so if you go into

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.880 
settings extension so if you go into
these<00:00:57.149> settings<00:00:57.539> up<00:00:57.780> and<00:00:58.020> then<00:00:58.559> you<00:00:58.680> go<00:00:58.829> to

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
these settings up and then you go to

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:01.990 
these settings up and then you go to
Zephyr<00:00:59.640> you<00:01:00.300> can<00:01:00.480> see<00:01:00.660> that<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.930> does<00:01:01.109> say

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.000 
Zephyr you can see that it does say

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.570 
Zephyr you can see that it does say
swipe<00:01:03.000> up<00:01:03.149> from<00:01:03.480> bottom<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.260> also<00:01:04.680> left<00:01:05.309> or

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
swipe up from bottom and also left or

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.510 
swipe up from bottom and also left or
right<00:01:06.000> edges<00:01:06.450> so<00:01:06.900> if<00:01:06.990> you<00:01:07.110> tap<00:01:07.320> up<00:01:07.560> from<00:01:08.130> bottom

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
right edges so if you tap up from bottom

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.050 
right edges so if you tap up from bottom
you<00:01:09.420> can<00:01:09.450> change<00:01:09.960> it<00:01:10.890> to<00:01:10.950> not<00:01:11.340> using<00:01:11.640> it<00:01:11.909> and

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
you can change it to not using it and

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.539 
you can change it to not using it and
that's<00:01:12.810> basically<00:01:13.049> all<00:01:13.320> it<00:01:13.500> does<00:01:13.799> now<00:01:14.340> there's

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
that's basically all it does now there's

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.190 
that's basically all it does now there's
going<00:01:14.610> to<00:01:14.790> be<00:01:14.850> many<00:01:15.030> more<00:01:15.299> updates<00:01:15.750> coming<00:01:15.840> to

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
going to be many more updates coming to

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.929 
going to be many more updates coming to
Zephyr<00:01:16.590> so<00:01:16.799> it'll<00:01:16.920> definitely<00:01:17.189> be<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.640> much

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
Zephyr so it'll definitely be a much

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.200 
Zephyr so it'll definitely be a much
useful<00:01:18.210> Cydia<00:01:19.110> tweak<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.740> you<00:01:20.670> can<00:01:20.820> find<00:01:21.060> it

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
useful Cydia tweak and you can find it

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.469 
useful Cydia tweak and you can find it
in<00:01:21.330> the<00:01:21.509> city<00:01:21.780> store<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.350> 299<00:01:22.860> although<00:01:23.850> in

do<00:01:30.479> is<00:01:30.600> open<00:01:30.780> up<00:01:30.960> cydia

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.450 

now<00:01:42.900> once<00:01:43.200> you<00:01:43.290> open<00:01:43.380> up<00:01:43.530> cydia<00:01:43.740> we'll<00:01:44.189> have<00:01:44.340> to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
now once you open up cydia we'll have to

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:50.149 
now once you open up cydia we'll have to
do<00:01:44.579> is<00:01:44.670> go<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.880> manage<00:01:45.479> sources<00:01:46.880> edit<00:01:47.880> add<00:01:49.159> and

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
do is go to manage sources edit add and

do is go to manage sources edit add and
then<00:01:50.189> you'll<00:01:50.939> type<00:01:51.180> in<00:01:51.360> I<00:01:52.040> hacks<00:01:58.310> repo<00:01:59.330> calm

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
then you'll type in I hacks repo calm

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.539 
then you'll type in I hacks repo calm
then<00:02:00.990> once<00:02:01.200> you<00:02:01.320> have<00:02:01.409> that<00:02:01.439> to<00:02:01.799> be<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:01.979> sort<00:02:02.280> to

then once you have that to be a sort to
add<00:02:03.090> these<00:02:03.420> sores<00:02:03.720> and<00:02:03.960> then<00:02:04.320> you'll<00:02:04.860> have<00:02:05.039> to

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
add these sores and then you'll have to

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:19.850 
add these sores and then you'll have to
search<00:02:05.399> for<00:02:05.640> Zephyr<00:02:10.250> z<00:02:12.530> z<00:02:13.530> e<00:02:15.799> ph<00:02:17.330> why<00:02:18.330> are<00:02:18.860> so

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
search for Zephyr z z e ph why are so

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.949 
search for Zephyr z z e ph why are so
now<00:02:20.010> once<00:02:20.250> you<00:02:20.400> find<00:02:20.670> Zephyr<00:02:21.150> out<00:02:21.360> deep<00:02:21.780> in

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
now once you find Zephyr out deep in

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:24.199 
now once you find Zephyr out deep in
blue<00:02:22.140> Texas<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:22.769> paid<00:02:23.040> version<00:02:23.549> which<00:02:24.060> I

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:24.209 
blue Texas you paid version which I

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:26.240 
blue Texas you paid version which I
recommend<00:02:24.360> getting<00:02:24.810> and<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.890> other<00:02:25.920> one
