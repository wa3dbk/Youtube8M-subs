00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
the application can do and now if you

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.460 
the application can do and now if you
download<00:03:36.239> a<00:03:36.269> game<00:03:36.510> and<00:03:36.810> it<00:03:36.930> tries<00:03:37.140> to<00:03:37.170> make<00:03:37.440> a

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.040 
to hook on the phone through which they
don't<00:04:09.050> recommend<00:04:09.500> Lee<00:04:09.680> do<00:04:09.920> but<00:04:10.600> my<00:04:11.600> altered

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050 
don't recommend Lee do but my altered

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:15.040 
don't recommend Lee do but my altered
policies<00:04:12.860> let's<00:04:13.280> see<00:04:13.550> if<00:04:13.700> we<00:04:14.030> can<00:04:14.180> load<00:04:14.390> up<00:04:14.570> one

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
policies let's see if we can load up one

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.970 
policies let's see if we can load up one
so<00:04:15.530> here's<00:04:15.860> an<00:04:16.010> altered<00:04:16.370> policy<00:04:16.910> i<00:04:16.940> got<00:04:17.390> and

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:17.980 
so here's an altered policy i got and

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.220 
so here's an altered policy i got and
basically<00:04:18.980> I<00:04:19.100> have<00:04:19.220> a<00:04:19.400> loud<00:04:20.120> multi<00:04:20.900> media

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:21.230 
basically I have a loud multi media

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:25.060 
basically I have a loud multi media
access<00:04:21.440> net<00:04:22.070> access<00:04:22.340> whatever<00:04:23.410> so<00:04:24.410> basically

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:25.070 
access net access whatever so basically

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:27.340 
access net access whatever so basically
do<00:04:25.340> backup<00:04:25.730> your<00:04:25.910> original<00:04:26.330> policy<00:04:26.690> which<00:04:27.080> you

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
do backup your original policy which you

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:28.750 
do backup your original policy which you
don't<00:04:27.470> really<00:04:27.620> need<00:04:27.980> to<00:04:28.160> because<00:04:28.430> all<00:04:28.580> you're

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:28.760 
don't really need to because all you're

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:32.260 
don't really need to because all you're
doing<00:04:29.090> is<00:04:29.450> say<00:04:30.350> you<00:04:30.410> want<00:04:30.830> message<00:04:31.580> reception

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:32.270 
doing is say you want message reception
