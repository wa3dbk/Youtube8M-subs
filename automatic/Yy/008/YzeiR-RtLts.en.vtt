00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.690

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.660
 oh 

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.410
 goo 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:09.410
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.780
 goo 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.430
 Yes Hello 

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:29.330
 It is a cute construction This time I will serve slice serve 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:33.230
 Even though Suresabu was to do once even before 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.940
 It is as a kind of slice serve 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.740
 2 types 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:43.940
 There is this one 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:48.800
 Though I think of whether to do is who Well people that he is easy to hit or rather say 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:54.440
 Bend the beautiful and many more rotation of the beautiful 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:01:01.190
 The type of slice serve to increase the amount and sharpness after 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.850
 There is a slice serve that is used when you want to give a little ball speed though there are few surroundings 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.930
 I will 

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.830
 What this is no different 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.650
 Last time 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:14.620
 When hitting the ball 

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:19.780
 We were allowed to a description of the Uchikata to pay transversely to those who want to hit a little 

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:24.130
 By doing this in the turn amount turns around 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:28.670
 Frequency it is will be larger by a voice 

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.310
 It will be able to drive out much in love and you outside of Well there how has increased 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:35.250
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:37.220
 This time I would like to introduce a type of slice serve that will speed up a little 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.390
 But this is 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:45.290
 Against those who want to hit it there are those who want to strike 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:51.860
 Slightly diagonal to the person who wants to strike instead of a straight surface 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:53.300
 Slice of feeling that contains the Luo get shake straight for those who want to hit as it is 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.690
 I will serve 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:59.659
 Hey o 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.820
 It's Ede Though a little 0 Description 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:05.050
 From here to a 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.050
 Slice now 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:12.130
 Swing as a swing 

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:15.480
 For those who want to hit 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.600
 Swing sideways 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.750
 By 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:24.920
 Orbit is 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:27.190
 I will go more wide 

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.190
 today 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.990
 To introduce 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:39.680
 This direction is for this left direction 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.549
 A little 

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.549
 Diagonally 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:47.710
 Can you see 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.680
 Do you see 

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:51.980
 It is you go to the unexpectedly 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.360
 Place 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:03:01.370
 Although the amount of rotation does not take much 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:03:03.569
 Required is for us faster is fast to come here 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:10.439
 Because 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:14.000
 The purpose is to drive the opponent out with slice serve but the ball is faster 

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:20.110
 A hit in particular therefore of opponent 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:23.800
 It will be a slice serve that takes time away 

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:30.580
 Well then I'll do a slice serve 

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:33.319
 Pay next to a little off to the wide as I said slice serve a little while ago 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.099
 Slice serve and after 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:40.519
 With slice serve to cut 4 core of mall to cut a little 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:46.030
 There are two documents but 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:46.030
 First of all, it's a slice serve that turns a little more to the side to pay 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:57.520
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.010
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:08.099
 A home 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.099
 I bought a bit and I got a slice of speed 

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:18.380
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.290
