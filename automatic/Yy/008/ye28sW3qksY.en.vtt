decided to do was to run flight on its

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.990 
decided to do was to run flight on its
own<00:00:48.660> and<00:00:48.930> then<00:00:49.559> so<00:00:50.340> I<00:00:50.370> did<00:00:50.520> that<00:00:50.550> for<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.850> week

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
own and then so I did that for a week

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540 
own and then so I did that for a week
and<00:00:51.270> then<00:00:51.329> I<00:00:51.899> ran<00:00:52.170> it<00:00:52.260> again<00:00:52.649> using<00:00:53.219> the<00:00:53.250> intro

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.209 
and then I ran it again using the intro
workout<00:00:53.910> and<00:00:54.410> honestly<00:00:55.410> fighting<00:00:55.770> by<00:00:55.890> itself

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
workout and honestly fighting by itself

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.069 
workout and honestly fighting by itself
was<00:00:56.670> enough<00:00:56.910> to<00:00:57.149> get<00:00:57.239> me<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.480> my<00:00:57.600> workouts<00:00:57.960> I

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
was enough to get me to my workouts I

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.369 
was enough to get me to my workouts I
definitely<00:00:58.320> felt<00:00:58.559> its<00:00:59.129> effects<00:00:59.550> um<00:01:00.020> but<00:01:01.020> when

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
definitely felt its effects um but when

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.260 
definitely felt its effects um but when
I<00:01:01.410> took<00:01:01.500> the<00:01:01.739> pre-workout<00:01:02.309> there<00:01:03.000> was<00:01:03.239> a

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
I took the pre-workout there was a

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:04.579 
I took the pre-workout there was a
little<00:01:03.510> bit<00:01:03.719> more<00:01:03.840> endurance<00:01:04.170> and<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.409> don't

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
little bit more endurance and I don't

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.530 
little bit more endurance and I don't
know<00:01:04.739> if<00:01:04.890> it<00:01:05.129> made<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.790> difference<00:01:06.000> that<00:01:06.270> I<00:01:06.360> was

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
know if it made a difference that I was

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.270 
know if it made a difference that I was
sipping<00:01:06.780> it<00:01:06.900> throughout<00:01:07.110> my<00:01:07.409> workout<00:01:07.799> or<00:01:08.250> I

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
sipping it throughout my workout or I

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.740 
sipping it throughout my workout or I
could've<00:01:08.610> got<00:01:08.700> that<00:01:08.820> same<00:01:09.030> benefit<00:01:09.479> just

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 
could've got that same benefit just

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.630 
could've got that same benefit just
taking<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.170> before<00:01:10.590> this<00:01:11.189> is<00:01:11.340> really

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
taking it all before this is really

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.000 
taking it all before this is really
similar<00:01:11.880> to<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:12.659> pre<00:01:13.140> workout<00:01:13.439> I<00:01:13.590> was<00:01:13.619> making

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.010
