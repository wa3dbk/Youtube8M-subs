00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
we're transparent we legitimately try to

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:42.940 
we're transparent we legitimately try to
help<00:01:41.330> people<00:01:41.420> as<00:01:41.810> much<00:01:41.840> as<00:01:41.990> we<00:01:42.230> can<00:01:42.410> if

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950 
help people as much as we can if

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:44.950

somebody<00:01:43.310> sends<00:01:43.550> me<00:01:43.640> an<00:01:43.760> email<00:01:43.880> I<00:01:44.180> respond<00:01:44.630> you

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:44.960 
somebody sends me an email I respond you

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.960 
somebody sends me an email I respond you
know<00:01:45.080> within<00:01:45.290> 48<00:01:45.800> hours<00:01:45.920> regardless<00:01:46.550> if

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
know within 48 hours regardless if

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.030 
know within 48 hours regardless if
they're<00:01:47.120> a<00:01:47.150> client<00:01:47.570> of<00:01:47.630> mine<00:01:47.780> or<00:01:47.900> anything<00:01:48.260> so

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.040 
they're a client of mine or anything so

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.350 
they're a client of mine or anything so
I<00:01:49.070> think<00:01:49.190> it's<00:01:49.340> just<00:01:49.520> really<00:01:49.580> being<00:01:49.910> about<00:01:50.300> I

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
I think it's just really being about I

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.210 
I think it's just really being about I
think<00:01:50.780> people<00:01:50.990> eventually<00:01:51.500> started<00:01:51.980> to<00:01:52.070> latch

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
think people eventually started to latch

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.580 
think people eventually started to latch
on<00:01:52.490> to<00:01:52.610> that<00:01:52.820> legitimacy<00:01:53.810> the<00:01:54.080> authenticity

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
on to that legitimacy the authenticity

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.430 
on to that legitimacy the authenticity
of<00:01:54.760> us<00:01:55.760> really<00:01:56.180> caring<00:01:56.630> about<00:01:56.660> business

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
of us really caring about business

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.880 
of us really caring about business
really<00:01:58.070> caring<00:01:58.370> about<00:01:58.430> our<00:01:58.550> audience<00:01:59.030> and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:01:59.890 
really caring about our audience and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:02.830 
really caring about our audience and
it's<00:02:00.890> unfortunately<00:02:01.670> not<00:02:02.210> much<00:02:02.360> of<00:02:02.540> a<00:02:02.600> tip

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:02.840 
it's unfortunately not much of a tip

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.210 
it's unfortunately not much of a tip
because<00:02:03.140> it's<00:02:03.380> more<00:02:03.590> of<00:02:03.740> an<00:02:03.830> approach<00:02:04.190> that

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.220 
because it's more of an approach that

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.750 
because it's more of an approach that

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760 
takes years and so I don't know if

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.359 
takes years and so I don't know if
there's<00:02:07.940> any<00:02:08.060> real<00:02:08.390> quick<00:02:08.959> answer<00:02:09.369> podcasts
