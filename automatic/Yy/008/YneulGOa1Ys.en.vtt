and<00:01:54.240> messy<00:01:55.080> didn't<00:01:55.350> do<00:01:55.440> that<00:01:55.620> and<00:01:55.830> that<00:01:56.010> at<00:01:56.190> the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
and messy didn't do that and that at the

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:58.190 
and messy didn't do that and that at the
time<00:01:56.460> this<00:01:56.670> was<00:01:56.730> like<00:01:57.000> five<00:01:57.210> years<00:01:57.240> ago<00:01:57.570> that

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
time this was like five years ago that

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.900 
time this was like five years ago that
at<00:01:58.320> the<00:01:58.410> time<00:01:58.590> was<00:01:58.890> where<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.370> just<00:01:59.760> thought

00:01:59.900 --> 00:01:59.910 
at the time was where I just thought

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:02.390 
at the time was where I just thought
messy<00:02:00.420> is<00:02:00.630> a<00:02:00.660> lot<00:02:01.080> better<00:02:01.320> than<00:02:01.560> ronaldo<00:02:01.800> but

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:02.400 
messy is a lot better than ronaldo but

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.340 
messy is a lot better than ronaldo but
Ronaldo<00:02:02.910> has<00:02:03.060> come<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.270> long<00:02:03.360> way<00:02:03.780> since<00:02:04.110> then

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
Ronaldo has come a long way since then

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:07.640 
Ronaldo has come a long way since then
and<00:02:04.680> I<00:02:05.430> think<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.720> could<00:02:06.930> see<00:02:07.140> last<00:02:07.410> night

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
and I think you could see last night

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.920 
and I think you could see last night
when<00:02:07.920> he<00:02:07.950> when<00:02:08.220> he<00:02:08.369> was<00:02:08.520> so<00:02:08.700> happy<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.270> he

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:09.930 
when he when he was so happy that he

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.990 
when he when he was so happy that he
actually<00:02:10.229> cried<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.979> I<00:02:11.160> think<00:02:11.430> that<00:02:11.670> just

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
actually cried and I think that just

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.960 
actually cried and I think that just
that<00:02:12.540> moment<00:02:12.840> should<00:02:13.620> get<00:02:14.040> the<00:02:14.220> notion<00:02:14.430> out<00:02:14.790> of

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
that moment should get the notion out of

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:17.240 
that moment should get the notion out of
people's<00:02:15.270> heads<00:02:15.510> that<00:02:15.870> Ronaldo<00:02:16.440> is<00:02:16.470> some<00:02:16.980> sort

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
people's heads that Ronaldo is some sort

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.730 
people's heads that Ronaldo is some sort
of<00:02:17.340> spoiled<00:02:17.910> child<00:02:18.150> because<00:02:18.630> I<00:02:18.870> don't<00:02:19.470> think

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
of spoiled child because I don't think

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:22.430 
of spoiled child because I don't think
he<00:02:19.890> is<00:02:19.920> I<00:02:20.070> think<00:02:20.310> he's<00:02:20.700> a<00:02:20.870> genuine<00:02:21.870> like<00:02:22.170> I

think he's a nice guy you know and I

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.420 
think he's a nice guy you know and I
don't<00:02:24.810> like<00:02:25.110> the<00:02:25.290> idea<00:02:25.410> that<00:02:25.650> he's<00:02:25.920> some<00:02:26.160> kind

was maybe very arrogant but also kind of
immature<00:02:56.790> when<00:02:57.210> he<00:02:57.270> first<00:02:57.480> started<00:02:57.630> and<00:02:58.170> I

00:02:58.550 --> 00:02:58.560 
immature when he first started and I

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:00.380 
immature when he first started and I
don't<00:02:59.070> know<00:02:59.130> i<00:02:59.190> think<00:02:59.459> since<00:02:59.790> he's<00:03:00.060> had<00:03:00.120> a<00:03:00.180> kid

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:00.390 
don't know i think since he's had a kid

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.880 
don't know i think since he's had a kid
he's<00:03:00.660> kind<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.020> evolved<00:03:01.530> a<00:03:01.620> lot<00:03:01.650> as<00:03:01.860> a

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:01.890 
he's kind of evolved a lot as a

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:03.860 
he's kind of evolved a lot as a
footballer<00:03:02.370> you<00:03:02.580> know<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.000> I<00:03:03.510> think<00:03:03.750> he's

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
footballer you know and I think he's

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.270 
footballer you know and I think he's
come<00:03:04.020> a<00:03:04.050> long<00:03:04.140> way<00:03:04.440> and<00:03:04.620> I<00:03:04.739> think<00:03:04.950> the<00:03:05.130> fact

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:05.280 
come a long way and I think the fact

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:06.830 
come a long way and I think the fact
that<00:03:05.400> he's<00:03:05.550> not<00:03:05.670> like<00:03:05.880> that<00:03:05.940> anymore<00:03:06.180> shows

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
that he's not like that anymore shows

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.320 
that he's not like that anymore shows
how<00:03:07.140> far<00:03:07.410> he's<00:03:07.620> come<00:03:07.650> and<00:03:08.489> he's<00:03:08.640> unfortunate

00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:09.330 
how far he's come and he's unfortunate

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.860 
how far he's come and he's unfortunate
in<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.570> sense<00:03:09.780> that<00:03:09.980> it's<00:03:11.270> he's<00:03:12.270> very<00:03:12.510> unlucky

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
in the sense that it's he's very unlucky

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.570 
in the sense that it's he's very unlucky
to<00:03:13.170> be<00:03:13.260> alive<00:03:13.530> at<00:03:13.770> a<00:03:13.830> time<00:03:14.040> when<00:03:14.310> there's<00:03:14.520> a

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
to be alive at a time when there's a

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.760 
to be alive at a time when there's a
player<00:03:14.820> as<00:03:15.030> good<00:03:15.239> as<00:03:15.330> messy<00:03:15.720> around<00:03:15.810> I<00:03:16.260> think<00:03:16.500> I

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
player as good as messy around I think I

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:18.290 
player as good as messy around I think I
think<00:03:16.980> that's<00:03:17.130> what<00:03:17.280> it<00:03:17.370> is<00:03:17.489> but<00:03:17.880> like<00:03:18.030> when<00:03:18.180> it

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:18.300 
think that's what it is but like when it

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:19.910 
think that's what it is but like when it
when<00:03:18.420> I<00:03:18.450> was<00:03:18.630> growing<00:03:18.930> up<00:03:19.050> in<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.380> like<00:03:19.680> we

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:19.920 
when I was growing up in that like we

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.010 
when I was growing up in that like we
had<00:03:20.010> players<00:03:20.250> like<00:03:20.459> sedan<00:03:20.850> add<00:03:21.150> the<00:03:21.840> real

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:22.020 
had players like sedan add the real

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.940 
had players like sedan add the real
Ronaldo<00:03:22.590> and<00:03:23.750> even<00:03:24.750> like<00:03:24.930> caca<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.620> was<00:03:25.739> a<00:03:25.770> time

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
Ronaldo and even like caca it was a time

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.140 
Ronaldo and even like caca it was a time
when<00:03:26.100> Kaka<00:03:26.310> was<00:03:26.550> like<00:03:26.670> the<00:03:26.790> best<00:03:26.880> player<00:03:27.090> in

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
when Kaka was like the best player in

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.640 
when Kaka was like the best player in
the<00:03:27.239> world<00:03:27.300> and<00:03:27.600> Ronaldinho<00:03:28.170> as<00:03:28.290> well<00:03:28.440> but

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
the world and Ronaldinho as well but

there was never ever two players at one

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:33.050 
there was never ever two players at one
point<00:03:31.200> who<00:03:32.100> were<00:03:32.250> as<00:03:32.370> good<00:03:32.580> as<00:03:32.640> Messi<00:03:32.910> and

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:33.060 
point who were as good as Messi and

point who were as good as Messi and
Ronaldo<00:03:33.209> are<00:03:33.630> now<00:03:33.870> so<00:03:34.140> it's<00:03:34.440> absolutely

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
awesome to see but I was wondering if

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.030 
awesome to see but I was wondering if
you<00:03:36.420> guys<00:03:36.600> if<00:03:36.900> your<00:03:37.050> opinion<00:03:37.410> has<00:03:37.560> changed<00:03:37.590> a

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:38.040 
you guys if your opinion has changed a

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:39.800 
you guys if your opinion has changed a
lot<00:03:38.160> of<00:03:38.280> people<00:03:38.519> think<00:03:38.700> as<00:03:38.910> well<00:03:39.060> that<00:03:39.330> messy

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
lot of people think as well that messy

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:41.479 
lot of people think as well that messy
the<00:03:40.380> only<00:03:40.560> reason<00:03:40.680> when<00:03:40.890> elder<00:03:41.130> one<00:03:41.310> was

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
the only reason when elder one was

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:43.220 
the only reason when elder one was
because<00:03:41.760> messy<00:03:42.060> was<00:03:42.180> injured<00:03:42.480> for<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:42.930> long

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230 
because messy was injured for so long

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:44.660 
because messy was injured for so long
and<00:03:43.470> I<00:03:43.530> don't<00:03:43.680> know<00:03:43.739> where<00:03:43.890> this<00:03:44.070> notion<00:03:44.340> comes

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
and I don't know where this notion comes

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.729 
and I don't know where this notion comes
from<00:03:44.850> either<00:03:44.910> Ronaldo<00:03:45.660> only<00:03:45.959> played<00:03:46.170> 12<00:03:46.500> games

than Messi did like so like I don't know
where<00:04:01.110> the<00:04:01.260> notion<00:04:01.620> is<00:04:01.739> that<00:04:01.769> messy<00:04:02.160> was

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
where the notion is that messy was

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:03.530 
where the notion is that messy was
injured<00:04:02.549> for<00:04:02.700> the<00:04:02.760> whole<00:04:02.880> year<00:04:03.150> like<00:04:03.209> do

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
injured for the whole year like do

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.870 
injured for the whole year like do
people<00:04:03.660> have<00:04:03.900> that<00:04:04.109> short<00:04:04.470> the<00:04:04.620> memory<00:04:04.980> and

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:05.880 
people have that short the memory and

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:07.580 
people have that short the memory and
that<00:04:06.150> being<00:04:06.330> said<00:04:06.510> messy<00:04:06.870> still<00:04:07.110> killed<00:04:07.410> it

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
that being said messy still killed it

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:08.990 
that being said messy still killed it
with<00:04:07.680> his<00:04:07.830> statistics<00:04:08.370> like<00:04:08.520> he<00:04:08.640> has<00:04:08.790> more

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:09.000 
with his statistics like he has more

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.460 
with his statistics like he has more
than<00:04:09.210> a<00:04:09.240> ghola<00:04:09.450> game<00:04:09.720> for<00:04:10.050> his<00:04:10.170> entire

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
than a ghola game for his entire

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.740 
than a ghola game for his entire
calendar<00:04:10.920> year<00:04:11.250> so<00:04:11.490> he<00:04:12.150> definitely<00:04:12.420> deserves

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:12.750 
calendar year so he definitely deserves

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.090 
calendar year so he definitely deserves
to<00:04:12.840> be<00:04:12.900> nominated<00:04:13.470> and<00:04:13.560> everything<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.040> that

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:14.100 
to be nominated and everything like that

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.150 
to be nominated and everything like that
and<00:04:14.250> you<00:04:14.760> know<00:04:14.880> it<00:04:14.910> was<00:04:15.480> um<00:04:15.750> it<00:04:16.080> was<00:04:16.890> fair<00:04:17.130> I

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:17.160 
and you know it was um it was fair I

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.300 
and you know it was um it was fair I
think<00:04:17.280> Ronaldo<00:04:17.820> did<00:04:18.000> deserve<00:04:18.300> to<00:04:18.510> win<00:04:18.690> because

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
think Ronaldo did deserve to win because

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:22.400 
think Ronaldo did deserve to win because
he's<00:04:20.310> played<00:04:20.730> out<00:04:20.940> of<00:04:21.090> his<00:04:21.180> skin<00:04:21.540> at<00:04:22.110> a<00:04:22.170> level
