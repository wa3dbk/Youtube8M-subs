00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:06.060
 hi guys today i would like to start this 

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:08.910
 video lesson or video recipe showing 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.519
 there is very important ambitions 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:16.109
 we have reached the optimum 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:20.699
 psycho-physical state then reduction of the 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.859
 Excess fat and goodbye attacks 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.289
 hunger these seem some of the most 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.720
 important extrapolated key points 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.730
 from the now very famous zone diet 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:32.099
 conceived and carried out by the biochemist 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.660
 american barry sears and seen 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.300
 the interest aroused by mine 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:38.610
 previous recipe cookies of the area age 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.800
 today I'm here for you to introduce you 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.989
 covered in the Zone diet bars 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.860
 with a ricotta cream and bitter cocoa 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.370
 for a set the recipe to prepare 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.430
 six age zone bars are needed 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:56.910
 then for the base we have 30 grams of 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:01.859
 wheat coca 10 grams of protein 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.549
 in powder pro 95 an album and 30 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:09.240
 milliliters of skim milk and 10 grams 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:11.670
 of fructose then for the cream with which 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.640
 we are going to cover them instead 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:19.979
 required 15 grams of bitter cocoa in 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:22.470
 powder 15 grams of fructose a 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:26.250
 organic orange where we will use 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:32.189
 only the rind then 120 g of ricotta 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:34.130
 lean 20 mm of skimmed milk and 3 grams 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.640
 of gelatin 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:41.189
 let's start with the preparation for the base 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.860
 we pour the wheat bran into one 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:47.340
 large bowl but we are then the 

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:49.470
 pro 95 milk proteins you can 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.270
 buy them at the pharmacy or online 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:53.100
 we at my personal train home and we have 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:57.829
 purchased on the integrated production site 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.829
 re.it then fructose 

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.870
 and mix the ok powders well 

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.870
 then the dry ingredients 

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:14.690
 now add the liquids or the 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:18.490
 skim milk and the album and we mix 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.490
 for good until you get a batter 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:24.770
 here we got the dough for 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:27.230
 the base of the bars now we have 

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:34.490
 took a strip of baking paper and 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:36.650
 we pour in everything on so now with 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.330
 the help of a spatula or a 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.630
 knife and long blade 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:43.600
 let's spread this batter 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.290
 that we got up to form a 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.320
 rectangle with dimensions 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.510
 approximate ten for 20 if you want 

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.650
 you can also help yourself by doing this 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:58.160
 operation ie close ok flattened 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:03:05.110
 with your hand and spread you will see that it will be 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:13.180
 also much easier to spread and then 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:13.180
 open and place a little with the blade 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:22.610
 we have placed our rectangle 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.620
 of bran on a baking tray e 

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:29.870
 now we can bake them already 

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.120
 warm 180 degrees for 15 minutes after 15 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:34.819
 minutes of cooking we removed the 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.140
 Our cookie so let's call it the 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:38.120
 we left them 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.230
 in short, completely cool this down 

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.150
 is the result 

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:44.989
 now let's start with the preparation 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.610
 of the cream we heated the milk 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.379
 they are in a little bit more linen 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.269
 great because this throws me too much 

00:03:48.379 --> 00:04:02.540
 small now we melt the jelly 

00:03:52.269 --> 00:04:10.670
 so feed and then who we also fail 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:13.220
 the fructose we have perfectly 

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:15.739
 chosen gelatin and fructose in the 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.630
 milk now we can move into one 

00:04:15.739 --> 00:04:22.750
 bowl a little bigger and prepare us from 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:26.599
 cream with lean ricotta and then 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:32.389
 we also sift the bitter cocoa 

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:38.300
 so for good everything and now we mix 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:40.070
 for good until you get a cream there 

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:44.349
 we also add the liquid to 

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:44.349
 also facilitate in everything 

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:50.589
 here is our ricotta cream 

00:04:48.339 --> 00:04:52.629
 I also used a small spatula in 

00:04:50.589 --> 00:04:54.639
 so as to remove all well though 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:57.039
 cream residues from the walls 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:05:04.119
 now we can pour it directly 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:10.389
 over our bar base and then 

00:05:04.119 --> 00:05:13.389
 with the spatula we reveal helping ourselves 

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:15.689
 even with the long-nosed spatula of 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:15.689
 before 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.620
 before cutting everything into bars 

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:26.420
 let's rest in the fridge reforms in 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.350
 an hour and a half network so as to 

00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:32.210
 give time to the gelatin to coagulate 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:34.370
 after an hour and a half of cooling 

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:37.370
 jelly has done its duty 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:41.000
 now we can also cut our own 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:43.310
 block of bars I have already done the 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:49.780
 try to feel if the jelly had 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:52.190
 learned everything and this was invited 

00:05:49.780 --> 00:06:00.650
 so let's proceed in this way up to 

00:05:52.190 --> 00:06:03.250
 run out all the bars and now a little 

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.900
 discreet orange slice to perfume 

00:06:03.250 --> 00:06:12.800
 end our bar area ton network are 

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:14.780
 graves as the zone diet imposes and le 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:17.840
 calories provided by these bars 

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:19.790
 they come from 30 percent from fat 

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.620
 of 30 percent of the proteins of the 

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:24.140
 40 remaining for Caribbean activities 

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.700
 thankful well with this I have finished hopefully 

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:28.930
 that my recipe can help you 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:28.930
 in your zone diet
