60g powdered sugar

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:22.849
160g margarine

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:26.789
let's begin: first put in the flour

00:00:27.819 --> 00:00:31.869
pistachios with almonds

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:37.130
baking powder and vanille

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:44.130

powdered sugar

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.680
margarine

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.680
work it all

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.430
work this for 5 minutes

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:16.850
we needed 250g flour before

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.630
done

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:25.380
let it rest for 10 minutes, the continue

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.350
the 10 minutes are up, now work the dough further

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.910
I halfed it, one half in my hand

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:34.680
I will make these round like these

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.220
then I make little pieces out of it, around 30g per piece

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.100
we got baking paper here

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.840
let's make the dough round like this

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.840
turn your hand around and press, lightly

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:58.320
and then press lightly

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.890
another one and we're done

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.940
press in lightly

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:08.739
OK

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:11.979
I will put in pistachios

00:02:11.979 --> 00:02:18.979
you can also use almonds
press these in just like this

00:02:19.369 --> 00:02:22.449
we are doing half with and half without

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:24.289
that's it

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:29.689
into the oven, 170 Â°C air circulation for
15 minutes

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:32.069
let's get the cookies out after 15 minutes

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.459
switch the stove off

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.039
and this is how it looks like

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:45.859
now wait 2 Min
and then put powdered sugar on top

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:47.969
after 2 minutes

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:54.969
now the powdered sugar on top

00:03:07.139 --> 00:03:08.169
now on the plate

00:03:30.619 --> 00:03:33.539
done

00:03:33.539 --> 00:03:36.069

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:37.489
