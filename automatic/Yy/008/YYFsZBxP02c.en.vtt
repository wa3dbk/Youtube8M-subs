00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:07.319
 hi girls and guys how are you 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.779
 hello girls and guys how are you good 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.430
 Today is Wednesday, play video and we are going to 

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.450
 keep watching everything I have inside 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:25.950
 of the closet and specifically the bags 

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:25.950
 Rodrigo do not make noise 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:33.270
 we will be able to survive all this 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:34.800
 summer with less than 50 bags because you 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.200
 It may seem an exaggeration but I 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:39.720
 I assure that there are people who have 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.920
 a lot of bags in the closet and how 

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.690
 We're going to do it well, today I'm going 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.920
 to explain a little bit how I do it 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:46.080
 theme of colors is so important 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.750
 that also affects the topic of 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.760
 the bags if it's from a warm season 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:55.740
 and warm colors correspond to you and 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.820
 intense or warm and powdered rodrigo 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.820
 if clean 

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:09.890
 what you should invest in is a 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:12.590
 brown bag to have let's say the bag 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.590
 star, that is to say, me, in my case 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:17.480
 As you know, I bought louis vuitton 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.430
 I bought it in brown in no case 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:23.390
 I planted to buy it more buy I do 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.980
 in black because my primordial colors 

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:27.560
 or the colors that correspond to me 

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.140
 are the warm and intense colors with 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.790
 which the brown was the bag in what 

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:36.260
 in which I should invest in the 

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:38.960
 maximum money once invested in a 

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:41.570
 brown bag in conditions yes I have 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.610
 raised and in fact is raised the 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.640
 made of investing in a good bag of 

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:49.310
 Black color is ok but even if we have 1 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.350
 and 1 is more than enough what you are 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:54.290
 winter or summer as the palette of 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.229
 colors be cold and in addition to colors 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.030
 intense or dusty it is clear that 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:01.070
 we have to invest only in a bag 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.640
 which is black 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:06.380
 the theme of colors and bags 

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:09.340
 includes a lot also in clothes is 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:11.300
 say those who are winter and summer 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.890
 practically you will not have colors 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.080
 browns with which you will have 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:19.190
 invest in bags of cool colors is 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.190
 say white gray blacks out there go 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.110
 the shots however who we are 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:27.050
 autumns yes we can invest in a 

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 black bag because yes that in certain 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:32.209
 moment we can put something black and 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:33.920
 it may look good to carry a bag of that 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.300
 color but not many since you complete 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.790
 1 is more than enough 

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:40.850
 I do not have I have very few in full 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.880
 I have 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 that I just 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:46.010
 record and with that I handle 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:50.000
 probably incorporate already I tell you a 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:53.330
 important bag in my in my closet I was going 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.239
 to be black but I do not think 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.400
 It is necessary to have 50 bags. 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.230
 to teach I have them well differentiated 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:03.019
 I have two black bags that are 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:05.850
 important and that also good because 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:08.880
 I use them a lot already you know 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.590
 and then I have my big brown bag 

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:12.780
 and I have the little ones 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.310
 and a very important thing when it comes to 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:15.900
 save it 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.360
 It is very important that you fill 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:20.010
 things because if not the bag is deformed 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:22.410
 it is important that you keep them 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.480
 in their in their bags is worth and if the 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:27.420
 you have paper stuffs and stuff like that 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.270
 much better because they do not deform good 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:33.480
 that I do not roll up more than I hope that you 

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.030
 like today's video a little kiss and we 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:39.550
 we see in the next video see you later 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.130
 as you see these are my two unique 

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:45.069
 black bags I have no more one more 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:47.530
 small for more informal looks and 

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:49.930
 this other bigger one that I use to go 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.850
 to work I do not need to have more 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:54.069
 bags of black color as you know my 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:58.260
 color is brown, that's why I only have 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:03:58.260
 these two and with this is enough 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.450
 these are my little bags as you see 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:06.970
 I only have four I do not have much more two 

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:08.740
 browns and two more pastel colors 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:11.200
 two brown ones one of them is 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:13.270
 season and the other a whole classic and the 

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:15.190
 another rosita and white are for 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:17.110
 slightly more risky combinations 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:20.019
 in which I can afford a bag 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:23.760
 different but as you can see four bags 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:23.760
 small and I do not need anything else 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:30.150
 as I said in the video if you want 

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:32.430
 invest in a good bag you should do it 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.190
 always in your color in my case 

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:37.500
 brown why I decided to buy this 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:41.450
 full level louis vuitton in brown no 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:41.450
 It could be another color I love it 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.630
 and here's the video today I hope that 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:49.419
 you have liked to see all my bags that 

00:04:46.630 --> 00:04:51.880
 do not add more than 8 notes and make 

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:55.199
 cleaning a big kiss and see you in 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.199
