00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:07.990
 hello i'm already d and this is not the pet cap 

00:00:10.209 --> 00:00:14.049
 9 it is an adapter seems to me a cable and of course I do not look myself 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.650
 we see in the mini closer up now the top find hd quality view 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.970
 there too deep first part seven comma experience nine innings with the 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.369
 resolution of 10 24 times sweden 68 pixels 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.419
 suppose we will still have the ipad 2 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.369
 look extensively then start the home button 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:35.270
 once found on the side seems a short one and if on both sides secretly like 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:37.170
 perforated at the eu of five 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.640
 hence the and right-hand side of the fin the volume buttons and block land 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.500
 at the top 

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.400
 on and off button 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.140
 and the headset port 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.229
 on the left side intention to do nothing 

00:00:47.229 --> 00:00:51.109
 go to the back we see the eight times finished just like the iphone 5 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:52.640
 the black king and 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:55.239
 and of course also find the 5 megapixel camera here 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.600
 we can see here the size difference between dyke became fourth generation left 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.470
 and it doesn't seem right there 

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:03.180
 but can also see if they lay on top of each other 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.299
 then we see that the end time mini f is a lot slower 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.990
 go to look not exactly works the Moroccans 

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:14.900
 he gets the party with 6 even though we can see the usual yes 

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:16.750
 interface of the owners 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.570
 but what to call interesting are the same time on the A15 by short SS 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.190
 equal 2 2 and resolution of the screen is also not that both from the second 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.160
 in terms of speed and performance, it also received the 

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:32.370
 rest then we can keep watching that level or are they often we go to 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.100
 competition doesn't allow us to be heavier 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.159
 we see that loading takes just a little longer than for both from the 3rd or 4th 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.380
 generation 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.789
 but in itself that is still pretty fast enough 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.820
 also see some editor when reading from website in the demo list 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:50.549
 hold can hold nice and good 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:54.189
 they can easily lose there if you have a company like children 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.500
 an upright mode the portrait mode 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.800
 it can sometimes be a bit awkward if you are working with one hand on div die 

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.880
 the one with it sometimes tends to rest a bit on the screen 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.820
 and then a year to click the trees through, for example, an article on what 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:08.510
 you didn't really want to click 

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:12.740
 and to hold on to it so that I still feel a little familiar like you 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.899
 then sit with your hands and reggaefÃ¨r newspaper 

00:02:14.899 --> 00:02:17.050
 one that hold tablet 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.190
 so yes music is slightly nicer in this position and he is yes he is not 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:22.969
 heavy so it is very light 

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.259
 That in itself is not a problem if you are so stuck that there is more good grip on it 

00:02:26.259 --> 00:02:27.349
 device 

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.349
 and then let's have a look and the application 

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:33.949
 which has not really changed much, I can only get one through several 

00:02:33.949 --> 00:02:37.689
 is that used to in other parents' devices 

00:02:37.689 --> 00:02:40.870
 and we see that we can easily browse through thorn forest 

00:02:40.869 --> 00:02:43.639
 Reading gistel can also zoom 

00:02:43.639 --> 00:02:47.089
 Then we go to watch a delegation performance of the device 

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:50.089
 set that game up 

00:02:52.469 --> 00:02:56.569
 but because the resolution also doesn't make the difference compared to it being 

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.250
 no black bars either, all applications work immediately 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.199
 without problems with the knee 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:05.269
 the battery life is also good, which is around Japan in ten hours 

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:06.219
 so is no more 

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:09.889
 And you can of course he just can't go all day with that 

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.889
 get up months later and that is of course super super handy 

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:17.599
 we see, for example, loading the game takes a little longer than, for example, 

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:19.789
 a fourth generation y pet 

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:23.259
 but the game is a nice loaded then it really works without any problems seeing that 

00:03:23.259 --> 00:03:26.259
 the graphic qualities of the played also look very good 

00:03:43.679 --> 00:03:47.369
 now you see the camera application of the oak are not after they are not really much 

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:49.480
 different from the other eu press of course 

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:52.720
 but here we can choose a focal point and we can take a picture with this button 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:55.629
 making foods to be printed is pretty fast a 5 megapixel camera 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:58.920
 show that also reasonable also if you go back then you can take pictures 

00:03:58.919 --> 00:04:00.059
 see back 

00:04:00.059 --> 00:04:04.769
 we see that that looks good so can also just view the photos 

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:09.589
 After a pedersen direct error, the second room application sting another one 

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:13.379
 options can turn commands on or off actually the only option and 

00:04:13.379 --> 00:04:15.030
 you are becoming a camera 

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:19.420
 of second room is a hd quality of two are camera yes for vaughters the 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:21.579
 for movies there is not really ideal 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.580
 but natural example in people who can diarrhea party ends and then looks 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:27.639
 do you have that in high resolution it is of course nice to see 

00:04:27.639 --> 00:04:29.710
 now we are also going to watch a movie 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:33.850
 very video recorded with the pet pet clinic the videos recorded in 27 p 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:36.210
 the maximum resolution steam 80 hp 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.210
 and the sound comes from the device itself 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.740
 June is not compatible with all animals and plants it seems it is not 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:44.180
 is becoming 

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:47.400
 and in addition, he has not really changed much in hardware terms compared to the 

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.059
 ipad 2 

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:54.719
 the mini has got used to and pol a beautiful that its finish and 

00:04:54.719 --> 00:04:55.880
 material use 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.039
 in addition, it has a very long battery life 

00:04:58.039 --> 00:05:01.130
 and finally it has all the advantages of the excellent system 

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:06.210
 small is finer and that certainly applies to the ipad knee 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.870
 new fast and easy because of its size 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.770
 At Knee is for anyone looking to have a handy but also 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:14.110
 nothing has been skimped 

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:17.500
 by going to order from this mini then click on the left lane at the bottom right 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.210
 the screen or will we enter our competition with center.nl or point b 

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.019
 I thank for time in this review and until next time
