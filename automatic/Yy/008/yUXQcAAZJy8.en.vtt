so<00:02:00.420> why<00:02:00.630> doesn't<00:02:00.960> this<00:02:01.200> Bob<00:02:01.440> spawn<00:02:01.770> after<00:02:02.040> many

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
so why doesn't this Bob spawn after many

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.190 
so why doesn't this Bob spawn after many
many<00:02:02.760> attempts<00:02:03.150> to<00:02:03.210> get<00:02:03.330> the<00:02:03.420> Bob<00:02:03.570> to<00:02:03.750> spawn<00:02:03.990> I

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
many attempts to get the Bob to spawn I

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.780 
many attempts to get the Bob to spawn I
have<00:02:04.409> to<00:02:04.590> say<00:02:04.770> it's<00:02:04.950> probably<00:02:05.159> just<00:02:05.520> a<00:02:05.700> glitch

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
have to say it's probably just a glitch

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.640 
have to say it's probably just a glitch
the<00:02:06.150> Bob<00:02:06.270> does<00:02:06.479> not<00:02:06.630> even<00:02:06.780> spawn<00:02:07.050> briefly<00:02:07.470> and

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:07.650 
the Bob does not even spawn briefly and

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.199 
the Bob does not even spawn briefly and
then<00:02:07.710> D<00:02:07.890> spawn<00:02:08.160> no<00:02:08.459> matter<00:02:08.640> what<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.060> Bob

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
then D spawn no matter what the Bob

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.020 
then D spawn no matter what the Bob
doesn't<00:02:09.509> show<00:02:09.720> up<00:02:09.899> I<00:02:10.340> hate<00:02:11.340> to<00:02:11.459> say<00:02:11.640> it<00:02:11.670> but<00:02:11.940> it

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
doesn't show up I hate to say it but it

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.850 
doesn't show up I hate to say it but it
seems<00:02:12.240> about<00:02:12.480> 28<00:02:12.930> is<00:02:13.050> glitched<00:02:13.320> in<00:02:13.500> such<00:02:13.680> a<00:02:13.709> way

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
seems about 28 is glitched in such a way

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.260 
seems about 28 is glitched in such a way
that<00:02:13.890> he<00:02:14.100> can<00:02:14.250> never<00:02:14.310> be<00:02:14.430> killed<00:02:14.820> if<00:02:15.060> you<00:02:15.150> can

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:15.270 
that he can never be killed if you can
