00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.660 
are gonna hang out with the rest of the
villagers<00:01:57.899> for<00:01:58.740> a<00:01:58.770> while<00:01:58.950> until<00:01:59.189> we<00:01:59.340> figure

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
villagers for a while until we figure

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.399 
villagers for a while until we figure
things<00:01:59.700> out<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> guess<00:02:00.390> they<00:02:00.960> come<00:02:01.140> across<00:02:01.320> a

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
things out I guess they come across a

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.380 
things out I guess they come across a
skull<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.130> they're<00:02:02.490> going<00:02:02.610> along<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.119> decide

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
skull as they're going along and decide

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.359 
skull as they're going along and decide
to<00:02:03.540> give<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:03.780> a<00:02:03.810> proper<00:02:03.960> burial<00:02:04.320> they<00:02:04.950> all<00:02:05.100> used

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
to give it a proper burial they all used

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:07.730 
to give it a proper burial they all used
to<00:02:05.490> live<00:02:05.640> underground<00:02:05.909> in<00:02:06.509> a<00:02:06.930> village<00:02:07.409> but

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
to live underground in a village but

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:09.619 
to live underground in a village but
they<00:02:08.039> had<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.399> come<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.910> surface<00:02:09.119> because

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:09.629 
they had to come to the surface because

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.540 
they had to come to the surface because
of<00:02:09.780> a<00:02:09.840> disaster<00:02:10.379> like<00:02:10.410> they<00:02:11.039> were<00:02:11.099> attacked

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
of a disaster like they were attacked

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:14.119 
of a disaster like they were attacked
and<00:02:12.239> they<00:02:12.510> had<00:02:12.660> to<00:02:12.750> fight<00:02:12.989> and<00:02:13.290> then<00:02:13.560> the

00:02:14.119 --> 00:02:14.129 
and they had to fight and then the

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.770 
and they had to fight and then the
village<00:02:14.400> was<00:02:14.520> badly<00:02:14.730> damaged<00:02:15.239> I<00:02:15.510> think

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:15.780 
village was badly damaged I think

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:17.660 
village was badly damaged I think
communist<00:02:16.200> having<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.560> dream<00:02:16.770> right<00:02:17.010> now<00:02:17.069> about

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
when he came to the surface with his dad

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.380 
when he came to the surface with his dad

then Simon's like but you're so much
food<00:02:31.170> me<00:02:31.560> you<00:02:31.709> should<00:02:31.920> do<00:02:32.099> it<00:02:32.250> becoming<00:02:32.849> is

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
food me you should do it becoming is

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.930 
food me you should do it becoming is
like<00:02:33.090> no<00:02:33.269> you<00:02:33.989> have<00:02:34.319> to<00:02:34.530> do<00:02:34.650> it<00:02:34.890> Simon<00:02:35.610> tries<00:02:35.760> to

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
like no you have to do it Simon tries to

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.640 
like no you have to do it Simon tries to
start<00:02:36.150> it<00:02:36.300> up<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.599> it<00:02:36.690> doesn't<00:02:37.140> work<00:02:37.410> because

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:37.650 
start it up but it doesn't work because

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:40.479 
start it up but it doesn't work because
it's<00:02:37.980> connected<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.700> his<00:02:38.879> confidence<00:02:39.629> /

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
it's connected to his confidence /

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.979 
it's connected to his confidence /
emotions<00:02:41.489> we<00:02:41.849> don't<00:02:41.940> know<00:02:42.120> that<00:02:42.150> for<00:02:42.330> sure<00:02:42.629> yet

00:02:42.979 --> 00:02:42.989 
emotions we don't know that for sure yet

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:44.960 
emotions we don't know that for sure yet
that's<00:02:43.319> my<00:02:43.470> theory<00:02:43.739> then<00:02:44.250> all<00:02:44.459> of<00:02:44.489> a<00:02:44.640> sudden

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:44.970 
that's my theory then all of a sudden

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:47.449 
that's my theory then all of a sudden
this<00:02:45.090> giant<00:02:45.690> one<00:02:45.840> I'm<00:02:46.140> smashing<00:02:46.860> down<00:02:47.069> and

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
this giant one I'm smashing down and

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.300 
this giant one I'm smashing down and
Simon<00:02:47.940> figures<00:02:48.239> out<00:02:48.450> that<00:02:48.560> the<00:02:49.560> earthquakes

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
Simon figures out that the earthquakes

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.330 
Simon figures out that the earthquakes
are<00:02:50.700> the<00:02:50.940> fault<00:02:51.239> of<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:52.640> gunman<00:02:54.230> and<00:02:55.230> if<00:02:56.160> we

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
are the fault of the gunman and if we

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:57.830 
are the fault of the gunman and if we
remember<00:02:56.700> his<00:02:56.970> parents<00:02:57.330> were<00:02:57.420> killed<00:02:57.569> by<00:02:57.780> an

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
remember his parents were killed by an

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.920 
remember his parents were killed by an
earthquake<00:02:57.989> so<00:02:58.409> all<00:02:58.590> of<00:02:58.620> a<00:02:58.709> sudden<00:02:58.950> he's<00:02:59.069> like

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
earthquake so all of a sudden he's like

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.610 
earthquake so all of a sudden he's like
infuriated<00:03:00.930> and<00:03:01.290> so<00:03:01.470> his<00:03:02.540> his<00:03:03.540> soup<00:03:04.290> thing

00:06:09.490 --> 00:06:09.500 
technically doesn't matter yet cuz I

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:12.220 
technically doesn't matter yet cuz I
still<00:06:09.710> might<00:06:09.860> not<00:06:09.920> watch<00:06:10.280> it<00:06:10.520> but<00:06:11.240> I<00:06:11.780> mean<00:06:12.140> I

liked<00:06:12.470> this<00:06:12.710> episode<00:06:12.920> I<00:06:13.220> thought<00:06:13.460> it<00:06:13.550> was

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:13.640 
liked this episode I thought it was

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.670 
liked this episode I thought it was
pretty<00:06:13.820> good<00:06:13.940> and<00:06:14.270> I<00:06:14.390> feel<00:06:14.780> inclined<00:06:15.290> to<00:06:15.530> watch

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:15.680 
pretty good and I feel inclined to watch

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.500 
pretty good and I feel inclined to watch
a<00:06:15.830> third<00:06:15.980> episode<00:06:16.130> unless<00:06:17.060> the<00:06:17.210> third<00:06:17.390> episode

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:17.510 
a third episode unless the third episode

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:20.380 
a third episode unless the third episode
is<00:06:17.840> just<00:06:18.050> like<00:06:18.230> detrimentally<00:06:19.190> awful<00:06:19.820> then

00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:20.390 
is just like detrimentally awful then

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:22.780 
is just like detrimentally awful then
I'll<00:06:20.600> probably<00:06:20.900> go<00:06:21.230> on<00:06:21.440> watching<00:06:21.680> more<00:06:22.100> anyway

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:22.790 
I'll probably go on watching more anyway

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.960 
I'll probably go on watching more anyway
I'll<00:06:23.030> see<00:06:23.090> you<00:06:23.360> next<00:06:23.420> time<00:06:23.720> bye
