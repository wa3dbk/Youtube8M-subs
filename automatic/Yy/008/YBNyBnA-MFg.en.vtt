way of doing that too
so<00:01:58.380> again<00:01:58.560> we're<00:01:58.680> gripping<00:01:58.920> it<00:01:59.009> like<00:01:59.130> that

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
so again we're gripping it like that

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:06.530 
so again we're gripping it like that
switch<00:02:01.520> switch<00:02:02.960> okay<00:02:03.979> now<00:02:05.180> let's<00:02:06.180> say<00:02:06.360> you're

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
switch switch okay now let's say you're

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.320

together
well<00:02:10.810> there's<00:02:10.960> a<00:02:11.020> method<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.440> that<00:02:13.080> again<00:02:14.080> same

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:14.560 
well there's a method to that again same

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.080 
well there's a method to that again same
thing<00:02:14.590> when<00:02:15.010> you<00:02:15.070> put<00:02:15.250> in<00:02:15.340> the<00:02:15.400> big<00:02:15.610> lens<00:02:15.880> on

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:16.090

thing when you put in the big lens on
it's<00:02:16.450> the<00:02:16.570> same<00:02:16.750> thing<00:02:16.990> okay<00:02:17.200> take<00:02:17.590> a<00:02:17.620> lens<00:02:17.800> cap

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's the same thing okay take a lens cap

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:23.160 
it's the same thing okay take a lens cap
off<00:02:21.120> now<00:02:22.120> it's<00:02:22.330> when<00:02:22.600> you're<00:02:22.720> switching<00:02:22.930> the

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
off now it's when you're switching the

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:25.500 
off now it's when you're switching the
small<00:02:23.500> lens<00:02:23.740> on<00:02:23.980> replacing<00:02:24.970> the<00:02:25.180> big<00:02:25.330> lens

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510
