00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.440
bjbjLULU JEFFREY BROWN: College students around
the nation are preparing to go back to school

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:09.490
soon, facing rising tuitions and a particular
hit on public universities from budget cuts

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:14.450
and a weak economy. NewsHour correspondent
Spencer Michels reports on the fallout in

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:20.160
California. SPENCER MICHELS: The signs are
everywhere. California's vaunted higher education

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:28.430
system is broken. Recently regarded as one
of the top systems in the nation, California's

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:34.270
public colleges offered places for all levels
of students at affordable rates. But, today,

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:40.930
at San Francisco State University, with nearly
30,000 students, and at all 23 of the California

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.120
state university campuses, the squeeze is
on. MONICA POPESCU, college student: It's

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.720
really hard to get into the classes you need.
TIFFANY TONG, college student: I took a math

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.300
class last semester. It was an online math
course. There are over 200 students, but we

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.920
only have two to three teaching assistants
to grade our homework. So it's ridiculous.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.149
SPENCER MICHELS: Nationally, higher education
funding is expected to drop $5 billion this

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:13.710
year. In California, such cuts affect both
the elite University of California, or U.C.,

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:20.899
system, with 187,000 students, and the more
broad-based California State University system,

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:29.130
or CSU, with 420,000, the largest university
system in the country. To offset declining

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.189
state support in a poor economy, CSU trustees
recently raised tuition 12 percent, on top

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:43.509
of a 10 percent raise earlier, jumping tuition
to about $6,000 a year. Though nearly half

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.499
the students in the system receive financial
aid, for the others, the raises have been

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:54.670
serious. Robert Corrigan has been president
of San Francisco State for 24 years, and he's

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:57.560
never seen it this bad. ROBERT CORRIGAN, San
Francisco State University: What I think we're

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:05.600
seeing is, increasingly, the middle class
being priced out of campuses like San Francisco

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.869
State. SPENCER MICHELS: But Corrigan says
he does understand why college budgets have

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:13.620
to take cuts, like everything else. ROBERT
CORRIGAN: Who can you really blame, you come

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.690
down to it? OK, legislatures, a large member
of them are graduates from the California

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:22.829
State University generally. But they're also
committed to a number of other things within

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:27.590
California, which is, you know, what about
the health care? What do we do with the needs

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.590
of 5-year-old children or the senior citizens
that need services? SPENCER MICHELS: Still,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:39.530
he says state universities like his were designed
to attract a wide, diverse student body. Nearly

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:45.370
anyone could attend. ROBERT CORRIGAN: We can't
provide that access any longer, and we can't

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.930
-- we can't project that we will continue
to have the quality faculty that we need in

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:57.329
order to educate them. SPENCER MICHELS: Phil
Klasky teaches ethnic studies at S.F. State,

00:02:57.329 --> 00:03:00.290
and he's seen the results of the cutbacks.
PHIL KLASKY, San Francisco State University:

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.870
I can tell you there's a big difference between
me teaching a class of 35 students, as opposed

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:10.900
to 60 students. Quality of education suffers.
SPENCER MICHELS: And so does the physical

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.920
plant. Roofs that need replacing are left
that way. Tiles fall off the ceiling in creative

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.670
arts classrooms, where the faculty has tried
to patch the problem, though not very well.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:28.330
The cutbacks and the tuition increases have
been met over the past two years by a series

00:03:28.330 --> 00:03:38.329
of demonstrations on several campuses. But
they seem to have had little effect. Ethnic

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:44.391
studies teacher Klasky, who has taken part
in the protests, lays the blame for poor state

00:03:44.391 --> 00:03:51.450
funding on inequities in the tax system. PHIL
KLASKY: Once the public understands fully

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:57.180
the impacts of these cuts on education, they
will rise up and demand that we stop giving

00:03:57.180 --> 00:04:04.280
away these huge tax cuts to the richest Californians
and the richest corporations, and California

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.170
can return to become a model for the nation.
SPENCER MICHELS: But others believe the situation

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:15.470
is more complex, and perhaps more long-lasting.
The University of California at Davis is part

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.950
of the 10-campus U.C. system, the jewel in
the state's education crown that includes

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:27.850
Berkeley and UCLA, ranked among the top public
universities in the world. Cutbacks and tuition

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:34.120
hikes here have jolted Davis chancellor Linda
Katehi, who is trying to preserve her school's

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:40.310
high reputation. She thinks the state legislature's
failure to fully fund education reflects a

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.220
shift in values. LINDA KATEHI, University
of California, Davis: What is happening with

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:50.310
higher education, that it is not anymore as
high in the public's mind and not as high

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:56.960
on their priorities list. And as we deal with
an economy that is not going very well, I

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:01.840
think the public worries about their well-being,
about their health care, about their ability

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:07.460
to live well after they retire. SPENCER MICHELS:
With undergraduate tuition at U.C. now more

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.110
than $11,000 a year, up nearly 10 percent,
on top of an 8 percent jump last year, many

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:20.640
students are hurting. To lessen the crisis,
and to increase revenue, U.C. Davis has promoted

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:25.780
its summer school program, where the classes
are smaller. It has encouraged admission of

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:31.860
international students, who pay high tuition.
It has made some administrative consolidations

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:37.790
to reduce costs. It has partnered with private
enterprise, rather than using scarce state

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:43.610
money, to construct a housing and educational
village on campus. And it has just launched

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:50.260
a drive to raise a billion dollars from private
and alumni sources, a large sum for a public

00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:55.100
university. But the chancellor says this is
all part of the new world, which includes

00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:00.900
higher tuition costs. LINDA KATEHI: We are
making higher education more of a private

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:06.570
good. We are asking the individual families
and the individual students to pay for their

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:14.380
own education. The time when the state was
the main contributor to the cost of higher

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:19.790
education is gone. And I don't necessarily
see us going back to that. SPENCER MICHELS:

00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.980
That's because getting more money from the
beleaguered state seems like a long shot,

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:30.100
given the legislature's refusal to raise taxes.
Regent Russell Gould, former president of

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:35.260
the board and former finance director for
the state, said, in the end, a tuition increase

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.780
was the only alternative. RUSSELL GOULD, University
of California: The regents had to accept an

00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.640
increase in fees just out of fundamental financial
realities. SPENCER MICHELS: That increase

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:50.220
has had real consequences for parents like
these attending freshman orientation week

00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:56.410
on campus this summer. Mayur Patel, who has
a son starting Davis, runs a small hotel in

00:06:56.410 --> 00:07:02.320
Ventura, Calif. He says the tuition increases
have kept him working overtime and created

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.400
real hardships. MAYUR PATEL, parent: In August,
we were planning to take a vacation, mini-vacation.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:11.950
As soon as we heard that it's going about
nine to 10 percent, we stopped that. We canceled

00:07:11.950 --> 00:07:18.490
that. Last time I took time off work was June
4, 2006. That was my dad's 50th wedding anniversary.

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:23.170
SPENCER MICHELS: Even with the tuition increase,
regent Gould worries about the future. RUSSELL

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:29.730
GOULD: I think the university is at risk,
in terms of its quality. The risk is if the

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:35.910
lack of confidence is created in the university,
and faculty starts believing that this is

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:40.880
not a sustainable enterprise, that California's
given up on it, I think you could see an erosion

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:48.251
of the kind of talent that we're able to bring
to the university. SPENCER MICHELS: University

00:07:48.251 --> 00:07:53.690
officials at all levels, eager to preserve
their schools' reputations, are reluctant

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:59.240
to say the educational quality has already
dropped, but they admit it's in jeopardy and

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:00.334
that major changes are coming. urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags
