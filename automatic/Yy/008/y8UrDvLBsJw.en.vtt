welcome<00:00:01.260> back<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:02.310> last<00:00:02.550> video<00:00:02.939> we<00:00:03.060> talked

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:03.330 
welcome back the last video we talked

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.420 
welcome back the last video we talked
about<00:00:03.449> different<00:00:04.410> ways<00:00:04.529> we<00:00:04.740> can<00:00:04.890> make<00:00:04.980> f<00:00:05.190> no

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:05.430 
about different ways we can make f no

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.270 
about different ways we can make f no
such<00:00:06.180> as<00:00:06.420> using<00:00:06.750> a<00:00:07.109> catalyst<00:00:07.980> such<00:00:08.130> as

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:08.280 
such as using a catalyst such as

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.419 
such as using a catalyst such as
sulfuric<00:00:08.490> acid<00:00:09.090> to<00:00:09.269> make<00:00:09.630> ethanol<00:00:10.070> this<00:00:11.070> video

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
sulfuric acid to make ethanol this video

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.190 
sulfuric acid to make ethanol this video
will<00:00:11.580> cover<00:00:11.700> its<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.450> different<00:00:12.900> way<00:00:12.990> to<00:00:13.049> make

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
will cover its a different way to make

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.430 
will cover its a different way to make
ethanol<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:14.059> this<00:00:15.059> is<00:00:15.240> the<00:00:15.420> main<00:00:16.049> way<00:00:16.410> that

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
ethanol and this is the main way that

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.920 
ethanol and this is the main way that
the<00:00:16.740> industry<00:00:17.190> makes<00:00:17.940> ethanol<00:00:18.449> itself<00:00:18.779> from

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
the industry makes ethanol itself from

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.830 
the industry makes ethanol itself from
sugarcane<00:00:19.260> so<00:00:20.189> actually<00:00:20.580> the<00:00:20.699> dot<00:00:20.939> point<00:00:21.210> it

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
sugarcane so actually the dot point it

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.009 
sugarcane so actually the dot point it
says<00:00:22.109> process<00:00:23.100> information<00:00:24.000> from<00:00:24.390> secondary

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:25.019 
says process information from secondary

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.800 
says process information from secondary
sources<00:00:25.320> to<00:00:26.250> summarize<00:00:26.820> the<00:00:27.240> processes

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810 
sources to summarize the processes

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.919 
sources to summarize the processes
involved<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:28.769> the<00:00:29.460> industrial<00:00:30.269> production<00:00:30.750> of

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
involved in the industrial production of

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:33.830 
involved in the industrial production of
ethanol<00:00:31.349> from<00:00:31.619> sugarcane<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> a<00:00:33.660> couple

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
ethanol from sugarcane so a couple

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.049 
ethanol from sugarcane so a couple
different<00:00:34.170> words<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.500> need<00:00:34.620> to<00:00:34.770> know<00:00:35.250> and<00:00:35.610> the

00:00:36.049 --> 00:00:36.059 
different words we need to know and the

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.950 
different words we need to know and the
industrial<00:00:36.719> production<00:00:38.390> refers<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:39.420> how<00:00:39.899> the

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
industrial production refers to how the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.190 
industrial production refers to how the
industry<00:00:40.200> is<00:00:40.620> so<00:00:40.770> how<00:00:41.420> the<00:00:42.420> industry<00:00:42.930> makes

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
industry is so how the industry makes

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.380 
industry is so how the industry makes
ethanol<00:00:44.010> and<00:00:44.219> how<00:00:44.760> the<00:00:44.820> industry<00:00:45.180> makes

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
ethanol and how the industry makes

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.380 
ethanol and how the industry makes
ethanol<00:00:45.750> from<00:00:45.870> sugarcane<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.829> sugar<00:00:47.390> cane

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
ethanol from sugarcane and sugar cane

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:51.290 
ethanol from sugarcane and sugar cane
was<00:00:48.690> a<00:00:48.719> crop<00:00:49.140> so<00:00:49.410> that's<00:00:49.590> something<00:00:49.739> we<00:00:50.300> plant

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
was a crop so that's something we plant

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.340 
was a crop so that's something we plant
a<00:00:51.660> plant<00:00:52.050> we<00:00:52.350> plant<00:00:52.649> sugarcane<00:00:54.079> so<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.199> we

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a plant we plant sugarcane so and we

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.590 
a plant we plant sugarcane so and we
need<00:00:55.469> to<00:00:55.590> summarize<00:00:56.399> so<00:00:56.969> summarize<00:00:57.329> means

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
need to summarize so summarize means

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.540 
need to summarize so summarize means
give<00:00:58.410> a<00:00:58.440> brief<00:00:59.300> detailed<00:01:00.350> outline<00:01:01.350> of<00:01:01.620> how

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
give a brief detailed outline of how

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.080 
give a brief detailed outline of how
that<00:01:02.609> happens<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:03.949> so<00:01:04.949> here<00:01:05.220> we<00:01:05.369> have<00:01:05.400> the

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
that happens and so here we have the

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.520 
that happens and so here we have the
first<00:01:06.330> step<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:06.780> is<00:01:06.810> we<00:01:06.990> need<00:01:07.350> to<00:01:07.470> actually

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
first step which is we need to actually

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.920 
first step which is we need to actually
able<00:01:07.830> to<00:01:07.890> get<00:01:08.040> our<00:01:08.189> sugarcane<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:08.939> we

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
able to get our sugarcane and we

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.270 
able to get our sugarcane and we
generally<00:01:10.170> can<00:01:10.350> get<00:01:10.470> our<00:01:10.590> sugar<00:01:10.740> cane<00:01:11.040> by

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
generally can get our sugar cane by

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.149 
generally can get our sugar cane by
harvesting<00:01:12.270> it<00:01:12.590> which<00:01:13.590> means<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:14.010> need<00:01:14.100> some

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
harvesting it which means we need some

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.060 
harvesting it which means we need some
land<00:01:14.549> we<00:01:15.450> plant<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.140> seeds<00:01:16.409> and<00:01:16.619> we<00:01:16.680> get<00:01:16.920> some

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
land we plant some seeds and we get some

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.940 
land we plant some seeds and we get some
sugarcane<00:01:17.689> our<00:01:18.689> next<00:01:19.020> step<00:01:19.200> is<00:01:19.380> something

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
sugarcane our next step is something

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.570 
sugarcane our next step is something
called<00:01:20.369> crushing<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.360> just<00:01:21.570> crush<00:01:21.960> it<00:01:21.990> so

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:22.580 
called crushing so we just crush it so

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:24.830 
called crushing so we just crush it so
we<00:01:23.580> have<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.729> sugarcane<00:01:24.180> which<00:01:24.450> is<00:01:24.540> a<00:01:24.600> plan

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
we have the sugarcane which is a plan

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.800 
we have the sugarcane which is a plan
then<00:01:25.049> we<00:01:25.110> crush<00:01:25.350> it<00:01:25.409> into<00:01:25.740> smaller<00:01:25.950> pieces<00:01:26.130> and

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
then we crush it into smaller pieces and

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:29.120 
then we crush it into smaller pieces and
we<00:01:27.810> get<00:01:27.930> two<00:01:28.170> different<00:01:28.470> products<00:01:28.770> we<00:01:28.979> get

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
we get two different products we get

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.390 
we get two different products we get
sucrose<00:01:30.030> juice<00:01:30.560> this<00:01:31.560> is<00:01:31.619> a<00:01:31.799> liquid<00:01:32.070> and

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
sucrose juice this is a liquid and

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.300 
sucrose juice this is a liquid and
forget<00:01:33.090> this<00:01:33.210> bog<00:01:33.630> gaze<00:01:33.930> which<00:01:34.500> is<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.070> waste

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
forget this bog gaze which is a waste

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.510 
forget this bog gaze which is a waste
product<00:01:35.579> this<00:01:35.909> is<00:01:36.030> a<00:01:36.060> waste<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:38.250> don't<00:01:38.400> really

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
product this is a waste we don't really

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.280 
product this is a waste we don't really
need<00:01:38.729> it<00:01:38.790> but<00:01:39.150> we<00:01:39.810> get<00:01:39.990> it<00:01:40.110> from<00:01:40.200> the

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:40.290 
need it but we get it from the

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.550 
need it but we get it from the
production<00:01:40.590> of<00:01:41.009> sugarcane<00:01:41.939> and<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:43.290> we<00:01:43.470> can

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
production of sugarcane and this we can

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.420 
production of sugarcane and this we can
use<00:01:43.740> to<00:01:43.979> make<00:01:45.229> heat<00:01:46.229> you<00:01:47.220> can<00:01:47.310> burn<00:01:47.549> it<00:01:47.700> and

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
use to make heat you can burn it and

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.679 
use to make heat you can burn it and
that<00:01:50.430> can<00:01:50.520> be<00:01:50.610> used<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:50.939> other<00:01:51.030> things<00:01:51.299> but

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
that can be used in other things but

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
that can be used in other things but
this<00:01:51.869> generally<00:01:52.320> is<00:01:52.380> a<00:01:52.409> waste<00:01:52.890> plucked<00:01:53.220> the

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
this generally is a waste plucked the

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.510 
this generally is a waste plucked the
main<00:01:54.000> reason<00:01:54.390> why<00:01:54.540> we<00:01:54.810> crush<00:01:55.320> sugar<00:01:55.710> cane<00:01:55.950> is

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
main reason why we crush sugar cane is

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.160 
main reason why we crush sugar cane is
to<00:01:57.210> make<00:01:57.390> this<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:57.920> sucrose<00:01:58.920> choose<00:01:59.250> a<00:02:00.170> next

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
to make this here sucrose choose a next

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.399 
to make this here sucrose choose a next
step<00:02:01.350> is<00:02:01.649> the<00:02:02.219> extraction<00:02:02.820> of<00:02:02.909> sucrose<00:02:03.600> and

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
step is the extraction of sucrose and

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.770 
step is the extraction of sucrose and
what<00:02:04.590> I<00:02:04.619> mean<00:02:04.799> by<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.399> here<00:02:06.360> you<00:02:06.390> might

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
what I mean by that is here you might

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.210 
what I mean by that is here you might
have<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.770> being<00:02:08.420> 23<00:02:09.420> percent<00:02:09.989> sucrose<00:02:10.220> but

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
have this being 23 percent sucrose but

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.130 
have this being 23 percent sucrose but
if<00:02:11.340> we<00:02:11.459> extracted<00:02:12.180> that<00:02:12.629> means<00:02:12.870> we're<00:02:13.050> getting

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:13.140 
if we extracted that means we're getting

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.850 
if we extracted that means we're getting
all

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
all

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.700 
all
the<00:02:13.950> sucrose<00:02:14.460> from<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.910> and<00:02:15.410> having<00:02:16.410> mostly

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:16.710 
the sucrose from it and having mostly

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.000 
the sucrose from it and having mostly
sucrose<00:02:17.220> so<00:02:17.520> mostly<00:02:18.510> sucrose<00:02:19.320> not<00:02:19.590> much<00:02:19.800> water

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
sucrose so mostly sucrose not much water

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.220 
sucrose so mostly sucrose not much water
itself<00:02:20.580> so<00:02:21.150> here<00:02:21.270> we<00:02:21.360> have<00:02:21.510> juice<00:02:21.900> juice

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
itself so here we have juice juice

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:23.840 
itself so here we have juice juice
refers<00:02:22.620> to<00:02:22.650> usually<00:02:23.040> like<00:02:23.250> a<00:02:23.280> mixture<00:02:23.700> between

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850 
refers to usually like a mixture between

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.740 
refers to usually like a mixture between
water<00:02:24.270> and<00:02:25.010> sucrose<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.850> now<00:02:27.360> we<00:02:27.420> have

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
water and sucrose but now we have

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.060 
water and sucrose but now we have
sucrose<00:02:28.320> mol<00:02:28.920> A's<00:02:29.100> and<00:02:29.670> that's<00:02:30.270> something

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:31.070 
sucrose mol A's and that's something

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.920 
sucrose mol A's and that's something
syrupy<00:02:32.070> so<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.090> can<00:02:33.240> imagine<00:02:33.360> that<00:02:33.660> to<00:02:33.780> be<00:02:33.900> a

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
syrupy so you can imagine that to be a

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.510 
syrupy so you can imagine that to be a
syrupy<00:02:34.440> and<00:02:35.510> it's<00:02:36.510> quite<00:02:36.720> thick<00:02:37.350> so<00:02:37.650> this<00:02:38.370> is

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:38.520 
syrupy and it's quite thick so this is

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.240 
syrupy and it's quite thick so this is
mostly<00:02:38.850> sucrose<00:02:39.270> now<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:40.410> after<00:02:40.709> extracting

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
mostly sucrose now so after extracting

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.790 
mostly sucrose now so after extracting
only<00:02:41.790> sucrose<00:02:42.180> from<00:02:42.390> our<00:02:42.570> juice<00:02:43.020> we<00:02:43.260> have<00:02:43.410> only

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:43.800 
only sucrose from our juice we have only

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.980 
only sucrose from our juice we have only
sucrose<00:02:44.430> left<00:02:44.670> and<00:02:44.940> it's<00:02:45.330> called<00:02:45.540> sucrose

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:45.990 
sucrose left and it's called sucrose

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:50.090 
sucrose left and it's called sucrose
malays<00:02:47.540> we<00:02:48.540> do<00:02:48.660> next<00:02:48.840> is<00:02:49.050> we<00:02:49.110> add<00:02:49.440> some<00:02:49.680> acid

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
malays we do next is we add some acid

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.690 
malays we do next is we add some acid
and<00:02:50.970> what<00:02:51.180> this<00:02:51.240> acid<00:02:51.570> does<00:02:51.750> is<00:02:52.410> acid<00:02:52.920> kills

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
and what this acid does is acid kills

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:58.040 
and what this acid does is acid kills
bacteria<00:02:54.000> and<00:02:55.310> the<00:02:56.310> bacteria<00:02:56.340> itself<00:02:57.050> might

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
bacteria and the bacteria itself might

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.130 
bacteria and the bacteria itself might
ruin<00:02:58.700> the<00:02:59.700> ethanol<00:02:59.970> because<00:03:00.720> it<00:03:00.840> might<00:03:00.959> turn

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
ruin the ethanol because it might turn

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.930 
ruin the ethanol because it might turn
it<00:03:01.290> in<00:03:01.410> ceased<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:02.400> we're<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.580> to<00:03:02.670> make<00:03:02.790> sure

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:02.940 
it in ceased so we're going to make sure

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.360 
it in ceased so we're going to make sure
we<00:03:03.180> kill<00:03:03.540> it<00:03:03.570> and<00:03:04.470> we<00:03:04.560> do<00:03:04.650> that<00:03:04.770> by<00:03:04.920> adding<00:03:04.950> acid

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:05.370 
we kill it and we do that by adding acid

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.470 
we kill it and we do that by adding acid
and<00:03:06.950> then<00:03:07.950> if<00:03:08.070> we<00:03:08.190> deliver<00:03:08.489> it<00:03:08.580> from<00:03:08.820> there<00:03:09.120> to

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
and then if we deliver it from there to

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.170 
and then if we deliver it from there to
the<00:03:09.600> fermentation<00:03:10.050> drainage<00:03:10.620> chamber<00:03:11.180> that's

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:12.180 
the fermentation drainage chamber that's

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.420 
the fermentation drainage chamber that's
basically<00:03:12.630> just<00:03:12.780> a<00:03:13.200> place<00:03:13.410> where<00:03:13.440> we<00:03:13.770> can<00:03:13.950> make

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
basically just a place where we can make

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.449 
basically just a place where we can make
a<00:03:14.489> lock<00:03:15.030> place<00:03:15.739> it<00:03:16.739> is<00:03:16.860> supposed<00:03:17.130> to<00:03:17.190> be<00:03:17.280> like<00:03:17.430> a

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
a lock place it is supposed to be like a

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.680 
a lock place it is supposed to be like a
shameful<00:03:18.450> thing<00:03:18.510> and<00:03:18.810> we<00:03:19.560> have<00:03:19.790> all<00:03:20.790> of<00:03:21.540> our

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:21.690 
shameful thing and we have all of our

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.610 
shameful thing and we have all of our
sucrose<00:03:22.620> inside<00:03:24.019> this<00:03:25.019> purple<00:03:25.380> thing<00:03:25.410> is

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
sucrose inside this purple thing is

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:28.850 
sucrose inside this purple thing is
meant<00:03:25.799> to<00:03:25.860> be<00:03:25.920> a<00:03:25.950> sucrose<00:03:26.310> and<00:03:27.590> here<00:03:28.590> we<00:03:28.709> can

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:28.860 
meant to be a sucrose and here we can

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.039 
meant to be a sucrose and here we can
ferment<00:03:29.130> it<00:03:29.340> so<00:03:29.489> fermenting<00:03:30.150> means<00:03:30.570> we<00:03:30.780> and

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:31.049 
ferment it so fermenting means we and

00:03:31.049 --> 00:03:33.560 
ferment it so fermenting means we and
put<00:03:31.890> a<00:03:31.920> yeast<00:03:32.160> into<00:03:32.430> it<00:03:32.640> right<00:03:32.820> this<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.299> locked

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:33.570 
put a yeast into it right this is locked

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.990 
put a yeast into it right this is locked
so<00:03:33.870> nothing<00:03:34.380> leaves<00:03:34.670> except<00:03:35.670> for<00:03:35.850> maybe

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
so nothing leaves except for maybe

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.620 
so nothing leaves except for maybe
carbon<00:03:36.510> dioxide<00:03:37.519> then<00:03:38.519> we<00:03:38.700> add<00:03:38.850> a<00:03:38.880> yeast<00:03:39.239> so

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:39.630 
carbon dioxide then we add a yeast so

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:41.660 
carbon dioxide then we add a yeast so
here<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:39.930> have<00:03:40.080> an<00:03:40.260> a<00:03:40.290> we<00:03:40.620> add<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.769> yeast<00:03:41.070> and

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
here we have an a we add a yeast and

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:46.420 
here we have an a we add a yeast and
remember<00:03:41.970> the<00:03:42.090> yeast<00:03:42.980> helps<00:03:43.980> to<00:03:44.670> break<00:03:44.880> down

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
remember the yeast helps to break down

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:51.440 
remember the yeast helps to break down
sugar<00:03:47.430> helps<00:03:48.060> break<00:03:48.510> down<00:03:48.780> sugar<00:03:50.180> and<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.239> does

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
sugar helps break down sugar and it does

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:53.780 
sugar helps break down sugar and it does
so<00:03:51.660> by<00:03:51.840> producing<00:03:52.260> enzyme<00:03:52.709> which<00:03:53.400> can<00:03:53.640> break

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
so by producing enzyme which can break

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.820 
so by producing enzyme which can break
that<00:03:53.970> sugar<00:03:54.720> into<00:03:54.930> ethanol

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
that sugar into ethanol

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:58.880 
that sugar into ethanol

idea how to actually pronounce that but

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:14.270 
idea how to actually pronounce that but
this<00:04:12.299> is<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.570> one<00:04:12.720> so<00:04:13.019> this<00:04:13.410> one<00:04:13.650> is<00:04:13.799> used<00:04:14.010> this

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
this is the one so this one is used this

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.180 
this is the one so this one is used this
is<00:04:14.519> a<00:04:14.790> certain<00:04:15.390> type<00:04:15.690> of<00:04:15.720> yeast<00:04:16.140> and<00:04:16.410> it's<00:04:16.979> used

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
is a certain type of yeast and it's used

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:23.510 
is a certain type of yeast and it's used
to<00:04:17.400> ferment<00:04:18.650> sucrose<00:04:20.359> into<00:04:21.359> ethanol<00:04:22.520> after

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:23.520 
to ferment sucrose into ethanol after

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:25.250 
to ferment sucrose into ethanol after
we've<00:04:23.700> left<00:04:23.910> you<00:04:24.120> should<00:04:24.660> take<00:04:24.840> some<00:04:25.050> time

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:25.260 
we've left you should take some time

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.710 
we've left you should take some time
this<00:04:25.470> mate<00:04:25.800> might<00:04:26.070> take<00:04:26.310> two<00:04:26.550> days

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:28.720 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:31.060 

so<00:04:29.720> might<00:04:29.870> be<00:04:29.990> in<00:04:30.080> that<00:04:30.200> chamber<00:04:30.410> for<00:04:30.710> two<00:04:30.860> days

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:31.070 
so might be in that chamber for two days

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:35.560 
so might be in that chamber for two days
and<00:04:31.340> by<00:04:32.150> the<00:04:32.210> end<00:04:32.480> we<00:04:33.140> have<00:04:33.580> ethanol<00:04:34.580> but<00:04:35.210> it's

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:35.570 
and by the end we have ethanol but it's

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.010 
and by the end we have ethanol but it's
10<00:04:36.050> to<00:04:36.170> 14<00:04:36.590> percent<00:04:36.710> ethanol<00:04:36.980> so<00:04:37.460> the<00:04:38.450> rest<00:04:38.750> of

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:39.020 
10 to 14 percent ethanol so the rest of

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.420 
10 to 14 percent ethanol so the rest of
the<00:04:39.170> so<00:04:39.860> it's<00:04:40.010> 10<00:04:40.220> to<00:04:40.430> 14<00:04:40.820> percent<00:04:40.940> ethanol<00:04:41.390> and

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
the so it's 10 to 14 percent ethanol and

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.510 
the so it's 10 to 14 percent ethanol and
the<00:04:43.430> rest<00:04:43.640> would<00:04:43.790> be<00:04:43.850> water<00:04:44.150> so<00:04:44.570> now<00:04:44.720> we<00:04:44.780> have

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:45.520 
the rest would be water so now we have

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.930 
the rest would be water so now we have
about<00:04:47.890> 86<00:04:48.890> to<00:04:49.400> 90<00:04:50.000> percent<00:04:50.450> water<00:04:51.940> the

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:52.940 
about 86 to 90 percent water the

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:54.280 
about 86 to 90 percent water the
majority<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.390> the<00:04:53.480> water<00:04:53.600> and<00:04:53.870> the<00:04:53.930> rest<00:04:54.080> is

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:54.290 
majority of the water and the rest is

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:58.720 
majority of the water and the rest is
ethanol<00:04:54.590> now<00:04:55.750> what<00:04:56.750> happens<00:04:57.080> next<00:04:57.290> is<00:04:57.680> we<00:04:57.740> go

00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:58.730 
ethanol now what happens next is we go

00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:00.760 
ethanol now what happens next is we go
through<00:04:58.760> distillation<00:04:59.390> distillation<00:04:59.770> helps

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
through distillation distillation helps

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.760 
through distillation distillation helps
us<00:05:00.980> to<00:05:01.280> purify<00:05:01.930> so<00:05:02.930> the<00:05:02.990> distillation<00:05:03.410> is<00:05:03.650> to

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
us to purify so the distillation is to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:09.430 
us to purify so the distillation is to
purify<00:05:05.740> and<00:05:06.740> what<00:05:07.250> I<00:05:07.490> mean<00:05:07.940> by<00:05:08.060> that<00:05:08.090> is<00:05:08.690> it

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:09.440 
purify and what I mean by that is it

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:16.420 
purify and what I mean by that is it
helps<00:05:09.740> us<00:05:09.950> to<00:05:11.020> remove<00:05:12.040> that<00:05:13.040> water<00:05:13.370> now<00:05:15.430> after

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
helps us to remove that water now after

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.730 
helps us to remove that water now after
distillation<00:05:16.730> we<00:05:17.720> are<00:05:17.810> from<00:05:18.080> 10<00:05:18.320> to<00:05:18.440> 40

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
distillation we are from 10 to 40

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:20.680 
distillation we are from 10 to 40
percent<00:05:18.890> ethanol<00:05:19.130> to<00:05:19.669> 97<00:05:20.330> percent<00:05:20.360> ethanol

00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:20.690 
percent ethanol to 97 percent ethanol

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:23.850 
percent ethanol to 97 percent ethanol
which<00:05:21.590> means<00:05:21.800> we<00:05:21.950> only<00:05:22.010> have<00:05:22.310> about<00:05:22.460> 3<00:05:23.390> percent

00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:23.860 
which means we only have about 3 percent

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.330 
which means we only have about 3 percent
water<00:05:24.860> left<00:05:26.410> so<00:05:27.410> we've<00:05:27.500> removed<00:05:27.740> most<00:05:27.980> of<00:05:28.250> the

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:28.340 
water left so we've removed most of the

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:33.250 
water left so we've removed most of the
water<00:05:29.800> but<00:05:30.800> to<00:05:30.950> go<00:05:31.070> from<00:05:31.190> 97<00:05:31.610> 207<00:05:32.510> all<00:05:32.630> we<00:05:33.080> still

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
water but to go from 97 207 all we still

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.770 
water but to go from 97 207 all we still
have<00:05:33.410> to<00:05:33.650> do<00:05:34.130> some<00:05:34.400> more<00:05:34.820> water<00:05:35.150> removal<00:05:35.600> to

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
have to do some more water removal to

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.960 
have to do some more water removal to
get<00:05:35.990> that<00:05:36.110> really<00:05:36.440> a<00:05:36.650> last<00:05:37.010> 3%

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
get that really a last 3%

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.500 
get that really a last 3%
we<00:05:38.780> do<00:05:38.900> that<00:05:39.050> through<00:05:39.490> dehydration

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:40.510 
we do that through dehydration

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:43.200 
we do that through dehydration
dehydration<00:05:41.510> makes<00:05:42.080> that<00:05:42.290> hundreds<00:05:42.620> methanol

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:43.210 
dehydration makes that hundreds methanol

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:45.760 
dehydration makes that hundreds methanol
so<00:05:44.210> I'll<00:05:44.270> quickly<00:05:44.419> summarize<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:45.080> main<00:05:45.320> part

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
so I'll quickly summarize the main part

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.890 
so I'll quickly summarize the main part
seen<00:05:45.979> is<00:05:46.100> know<00:05:46.310> when<00:05:46.820> it<00:05:46.910> comes<00:05:47.030> to<00:05:47.419> this<00:05:47.630> kind

00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:47.900 
seen is know when it comes to this kind

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:51.370 
seen is know when it comes to this kind
of<00:05:47.930> diagram<00:05:48.490> you<00:05:49.490> should<00:05:49.910> know<00:05:50.150> that<00:05:50.720> we<00:05:51.229> have

00:05:51.370 --> 00:05:51.380 
of diagram you should know that we have

00:05:51.380 --> 00:06:03.070 
of diagram you should know that we have
to<00:05:51.710> harvest<00:05:52.430> and<00:05:55.750> crush<00:05:58.180> sugar<00:05:59.180> cane<00:06:01.930> we<00:06:02.930> also

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:03.080 
to harvest and crush sugar cane we also

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:12.270 
to harvest and crush sugar cane we also
need<00:06:03.380> to<00:06:03.500> be<00:06:03.620> able<00:06:03.710> to<00:06:06.790> ferment<00:06:10.090> this<00:06:11.090> sucrose

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:12.280 
need to be able to ferment this sucrose

00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:15.969 
need to be able to ferment this sucrose
that<00:06:13.280> we<00:06:13.400> get<00:06:13.580> from<00:06:13.880> magnetic<00:06:14.270> cane<00:06:14.840> that<00:06:15.740> was

00:06:15.969 --> 00:06:15.979 
that we get from magnetic cane that was

00:06:15.979 --> 00:06:19.570 
that we get from magnetic cane that was
also<00:06:16.310> important<00:06:17.500> then<00:06:18.500> we<00:06:18.740> usually<00:06:18.950> do<00:06:19.310> some

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:19.580 
also important then we usually do some

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:23.320 
also important then we usually do some
distillation<00:06:20.180> the<00:06:21.760> third<00:06:22.760> step<00:06:23.150> was

00:06:23.320 --> 00:06:23.330 
distillation the third step was

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.040 
distillation the third step was
distillation<00:06:24.820> and<00:06:25.820> the<00:06:26.479> reason<00:06:26.720> why<00:06:26.810> we<00:06:26.930> do

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.050 
distillation and the reason why we do

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.219 
distillation and the reason why we do
distillation<00:06:27.470> is<00:06:27.800> to<00:06:28.760> remove<00:06:29.000> that<00:06:29.229> extra

00:06:30.219 --> 00:06:30.229 
distillation is to remove that extra

00:06:30.229 --> 00:06:32.440 
distillation is to remove that extra
water<00:06:30.680> we<00:06:30.919> go<00:06:31.010> through<00:06:31.220> 10242<00:06:31.700> the<00:06:32.000> ethanol<00:06:32.210> to

00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:32.450 
water we go through 10242 the ethanol to

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.830 
water we go through 10242 the ethanol to
97<00:06:33.020> percent<00:06:33.050> ethanol<00:06:33.320> and<00:06:33.880> then<00:06:34.880> sometimes<00:06:35.419> if

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:35.840 
97 percent ethanol and then sometimes if

00:06:35.840 --> 00:06:40.300 
97 percent ethanol and then sometimes if
when<00:06:36.140> I<00:06:36.169> get<00:06:36.349> 100%<00:06:36.740> we<00:06:37.160> also<00:06:37.810> dehydrate<00:06:39.160> to<00:06:40.160> get

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:40.310 
when I get 100% we also dehydrate to get

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:41.340 
when I get 100% we also dehydrate to get
rid<00:06:40.460> of<00:06:40.490> that<00:06:40.610> extra

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350 
rid of that extra

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:42.900 
rid of that extra
percent<00:06:41.770> of<00:06:41.830> water<00:06:42.130> to<00:06:42.340> make<00:06:42.430> it<00:06:42.580> hundreds<00:06:42.820> in

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:42.910 
percent of water to make it hundreds in

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.730 
percent of water to make it hundreds in
ethanol<00:06:43.090> so<00:06:43.810> these<00:06:43.900> four<00:06:44.710> is<00:06:44.860> main<00:06:45.130> steps<00:06:45.490> is

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:46.740 
ethanol so these four is main steps is

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:50.550 
ethanol so these four is main steps is
