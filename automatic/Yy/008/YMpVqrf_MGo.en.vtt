 are and are all welcome 

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:07.200
 again today we are guys 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:09.450
 back and today a video 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.880
 merely informative only for 

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.009
 tell them a little about the 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:15.960
 activity that we will have for what is 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 this February with respect to what is 

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:20.670
 plants against zombies to edgard in 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.400
 nurseries that guys already to almost a year 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.439
 of the release of this game is still 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.619
 keeps pretty active you still have 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.869
 Well go to the players with that desire 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.759
 of obviously therefore be doing 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.670
 items to keep them with that interest 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:37.860
 to a certain extent then go with with 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.629
 I want to continue playing it and it's that I 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.059
 I think they've always been worried about 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:44.670
 the news now certain details that 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:46.530
 obviously make the game well in your 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.750
 moment is going back then a little 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.660
 more attractive that you again give 

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:54.420
 enhance and encourage the players to be 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.030
 every day there and good guys how is 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.100
 and we are going to talk about the 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.199
 challenges that we have for the month of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.390
 February and ojito because I do not know very well 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:06.030
 why all this happens but good almost 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.720
 always the challenge that we have of each 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.180
 month for 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.370
 the end or for the final week ends 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.410
 being the challenge of week 1 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.090
 of the month that follows I'm not sure what it is 

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.790
 what happens but I think the weeks 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.510
 On top of it, the days do not come together or 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:23.940
 ends each month dividing the month 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.350
 of the one that follows and so so for the 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:27.150
 first the first week or the challenge 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.190
 number one of the month of February guys 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.620
 let's have what is the same challenge 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.480
 that supposedly was planned as 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.730
 that of week number four for January 

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.440
 which we know enough already did 

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:39.690
 a video these days and that consists 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.970
 basically making the pringue and good 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:44.640
 in providing as many zombies 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.830
 possible I remember them very quickly 8 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.960
 millions of priveados to receive a 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.880
 crazy envelope and 16 million 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.490
 Printed to receive a sachet 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.190
 ultra weird so that's what we have 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.530
 for week number 1 plus ojito 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.780
 I was also forgetting about a list 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.000
 of play for a limited time that 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.830
 likewise we already find in 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.110
 what is the multiplayer let's go from the 

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.729
 week number 2 and in this we are going to have 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.679
 something which will be based on 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.470
 consumables ojito because it's a 

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:16.440
 consumable which came out in it 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:18.750
 If I'm not mistaken , which is this? 

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.550
 zombie that can heal your companions 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.160
 obviously nothing more if you are from the side of 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.500
 the zombies which is a consumable that 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.200
 as soon as we send it out call with 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.090
 a little flag and with one of these 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.250
 they generate life that the scientists bring 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.110
 on his back and he goes running around 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:35.850
 the map and it's healing the people who are 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.280
 finds on the road so it's going to 

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:40.500
 basically based on this not on trying 

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.840
 that with these consumables 

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:45.120
 we want to a certain amount the first the 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.670
 first manasÃ© amount of 700 thousand 

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:50.250
 heals obviously with this through 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:54.170
 consumable nothing else comes out to receive a 

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:56.400
 rare envelope and one million 400 thousand 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.950
 cures to receive a sachet 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.570
 ultra weird this is going to start in the 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.110
 second week of February and it's going to 

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:06.930
 finish until the 19th to the 19th of 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.030
 February okay guys the third week and 

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:11.640
 almost ending and the month is going to 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:13.770
 consist of something very similar in fact 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.530
 I did not find much differences 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:18.330
 differences or whatever you say to it 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.440
 what are these two challenges but 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:20.100
 really now that I'm thinking 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.840
 all right 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.030
 the first one is going to base the consumable 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.130
 that I already told you in this zombie that 

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:29.070
 we can go call it out of the 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:31.410
 earth and he looks week number 3 goes 

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:33.300
 to consist in that the doctors 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:36.560
 characters that are medical either a 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:40.350
 sunflower or whatever they are the 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.830
 scientists heal covered by what 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.180
 that are your skills to 700,000 

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.450
 colleagues to receive a sachet 

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:51.060
 rare and 1,400,000 to receive a 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.340
 ultra rare envelope is something very similar 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.590
 only that the first one has to 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:58.110
 perform using the zombie consumable and 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:59.580
 the second using the skills already 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.560
 be it from the sunflowers of the bank of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.290
 plants or scientists from the side 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:06.030
 of the zombies but good now yes 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.280
 reaching the end of the month guys 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:10.440
 or hit because here they almost do not tell us anything 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.780
 and here it leaves us with enough to the 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:15.360
 imagination and that is what from the 

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:17.430
 start already a year almost launch 

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.380
 good game because apparently do 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:21.209
 that a surprise a surprise which goes 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:24.330
 to be preparing popcap people 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.400
 for us and is that yes yes at the end 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.370
 of this month announce 

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:31.290

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:34.229

 some surprise I do not know yet I'm 

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.750
 speculating a lot about what is it 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:47.699
 that can bring us but that is going to 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.039
