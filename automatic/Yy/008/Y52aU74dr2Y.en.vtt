00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:06.470
 first step to insert 

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.690
 cambric mormyshka need to be cleaned 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.079
 tin hole after soldering 

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:13.579
 hooks from various dirt 

00:00:11.079 --> 00:00:15.440
 after electroplating and additionally 

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:20.000
 expand the hole so that it remains easier 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.790
 cambric to cambric push in 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.390
 a thin hole needs to be reduced 

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:30.050
 diameter by stretching here you see 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:32.149
 how well he runs jig holes 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.320
 so small that even stretched 

00:00:32.149 --> 00:00:39.760
 cambric not always crawls well into 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:42.700
 hole so we sharpen it 

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.710
 cut at a high angle 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:48.050
 insert the next step directly 

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.570
 cambric mormyshka in this case we 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:54.230
 it turned out that the hole diameter is larger 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.200
 than the diameter of the stretched cambric therefore 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:01:01.219
 mormyshka move door thickening 

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:02.230
 cambric for a thin edge take tweezers 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:05.780
 or 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:10.070
 with small pliers 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:11.890
 cambric and mormyshka shift to thick 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.950
 part 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.750
 as a result of this manipulation 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:21.130
 it turns out that the cambric stretch 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.450
 through the mormyshku takes the desired diameter 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.500
 last final step is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.610
 trimming excess cambric 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.820
 you can prune 

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:38.030
 scissors tweezers I do it with a blade 

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:41.270
 you need to cut off almost to zero but not 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.120
 less need a small mushroom 

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:47.810
 stayed literally 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:51.200
 0102 millimeters but it turned out so 

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.280
 jigger with a cambric some edges 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.580
 cambric 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:58.400
 fuse the lighter so he takes 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:01.790
 rounded shape but it fell at all 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.960
 it was necessarily shown how to set 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.140
 cambric mormyshku 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:09.649
 on a fairly large sample for 

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.200
 comparisons here they lie side by side and we 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:16.280
 try to do the same with micro 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:19.190
 mormyshki also the first thing we clean 

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.760
 hole to do it from the side 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.440
 hook 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:26.030
 because and the little bit we have 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.580
 cone and cambric 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.550
 when dragging through the mormyshku too 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.860
 will have a cone and in this position 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:37.340
 it will be easier to get a fishing line in the holes 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:42.640
 u stretch the cambric habitual 

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:42.640
 movement immediately his 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:55.310
 to push the cambric inside the bait 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:58.939
 need to leave something thin stretched 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:03.739
 a piece a little bit in length 

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:05.090
 it was grab hold onto fat 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:10.040
 cambric edge 

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.310
 and start stretching it and at the moment 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.959
 when he starts dragging on 

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:20.540
 stretching part of the stretch 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:23.889
 Mormyshka turned out well and 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.889
 we cut as usual 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:49.240
 thanks to such a simple procedure 

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:52.080
 the loss of mormyshek fishing can 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:52.080
 cut at times
