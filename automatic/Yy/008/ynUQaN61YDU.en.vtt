00:00:09.409 --> 00:00:13.099
 make Tropenhaus Krefeld zoo last year, the euro 

00:00:13.099 --> 00:00:17.439
 Just when the baby is born the redhead will be one year old in July 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:20.289
 In the past few months he has already developed splendidly and it 

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:24.079
 In the meantime, he has become his own favorite 

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:28.570
 Excursions without his mother Lea and some courage something the St Petrasch if the 

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:32.250
 Press spokeswoman of the Krefeld zoo closely watches her protégé 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
 how has Schami evolved over the last few weeks? 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.400
 So Chong Tese, a real delight, had developed very well 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.650
 also an absolute crowd pleaser because of course he starts alone 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.840
 herumzuklettern 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.070
 of course that was especially nice with them was really nice 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:48.570
 can watch 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.680
 there will not show up like him and his conspecifics here in the Krefeld zoo 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.559
 bored, there is Christine Peter 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.350
 she is Germany's only specialist for employment that she tinkers 

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.620
 because here for the monkeys 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.950
 So today we will make felt cardboard rolls we will turn around today 

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:06.570
 Hoses and stuff with percent oatmeal and cottage cheese 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.790
 and today we will also be submitting paper with flour and water and who 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.090
 in grains give it 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.520
 So what do you have to look out for when making the toy? 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:21.260
 our tropical house he has no writing no grid it is all open 

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:25.260
 and we have to make sure that the materials are light because if the 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.320
 Silverback is lost 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.380
 and a visitor to the excerpt may not like it and the heavy ones 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:34.409
 Of course, throwing materials over would make it very much too 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.430
 Injuries therefore had to be because of that, real life always has to be easy 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.470
 why is it so right that the monkeys are employed as in the zoo 

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.330
 we all animals have a limited habitat 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:48.670
 and it's like us humans in the x have to do we get sick 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:53.150
 and thus we also promote my job in addition to the 

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.910
 Animal keepers that we have an intensive occupation for our animals 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:01:58.240
 can represent with 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.990
 and thus that they remain physically and mentally fit 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.850
 There are other animals here in the Krefeld Zoo than the monkeys 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:05.900
 in a playful way 

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.149
 We are active in those where the FIA ​​are active, for example, here are the low aphthae 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:10.979
 it does not belong to the great apes 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:14.749
 then we have the brushes or pigs then we take the porcupines and 

00:02:14.749 --> 00:02:16.509
 Year to do so 

00:02:16.509 --> 00:02:20.179
 how do the toys differ from each other, if only so 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.929
 quite clearly the engineers are the mindset the inventors 

00:02:23.929 --> 00:02:28.339
 all this can be a bit slower Euro per kg of energy have the rest way 

00:02:28.339 --> 00:02:30.549
 So the little hectic 

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:33.790
 in the gorillas it is the largest and English the 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:37.289
 gentlest of all four species 

00:02:37.289 --> 00:02:41.819
 Darrell must also be relatively quick otherwise they would be angry 

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:45.099
 one of the five percent that they may not crack the possibilities 

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.719
 In other words, they could someday use their power 

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:52.909
 and use their power to break the package or around the hoses 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:53.879
 do 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:58.269
 and if I'm going to lean on chimpanzees now, find the extroverted Finthen 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.859
 lautesten 

00:02:59.859 --> 00:03:03.909
 it has to be relatively fast, otherwise it can really be percent 

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:07.889
 turn around that they get angry and then maybe Irani Christof wife 

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:09.509
 on tires and bite 

00:03:09.509 --> 00:03:13.689
 Tata is the Krefeld Zoo really the purest player's paradise is boring 

00:03:13.689 --> 00:03:17.050
 thanks to the great ideas of Christine Peter not so fast 

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:20.780
 who also likes to make playtime for the monkeys can do that in one 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.060
 do great day internship information you can find on the homepage of the 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:28.370
