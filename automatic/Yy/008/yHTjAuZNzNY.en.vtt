just<00:00:11.849> I'll<00:00:12.690> do<00:00:13.019> it<00:00:13.730> so<00:00:14.870> in<00:00:15.870> synapse<00:00:16.470> I<00:00:16.800> have<00:00:16.949> a

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
just I'll do it so in synapse I have a

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.200 
just I'll do it so in synapse I have a
profile<00:00:17.580> for<00:00:17.880> my<00:00:18.150> mouse<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:19.580> by<00:00:20.580> default<00:00:21.000> I

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
profile for my mouse and by default I

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.080 
profile for my mouse and by default I
have<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.689> all<00:00:21.779> set<00:00:21.810> normal<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:23.189> for<00:00:24.000> that

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
have it all set normal and for that

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.439 
have it all set normal and for that
video<00:00:24.390> I<00:00:24.449> made<00:00:24.720> a<00:00:24.750> profile<00:00:25.310> with<00:00:26.310> these<00:00:26.970> macros

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
video I made a profile with these macros

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.740 
video I made a profile with these macros
but<00:00:27.779> to<00:00:28.529> make<00:00:28.680> the<00:00:28.800> macros<00:00:29.359> you<00:00:30.359> click<00:00:30.539> on<00:00:30.660> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
but to make the macros you click on the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.010

macro

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.139 
macro
and<00:00:35.070> name<00:00:35.460> it<00:00:35.610> whatever<00:00:35.760> you<00:00:35.969> want<00:00:36.950> and<00:00:38.149> then

and name it whatever you want and then
the<00:00:40.070> record<00:00:41.070> delay<00:00:41.399> will<00:00:42.030> make<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.840> when

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
the record delay will make it so when

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.930 
the record delay will make it so when
you<00:00:43.410> hit<00:00:43.500> record<00:00:43.940> it'll<00:00:44.940> have<00:00:45.649> the<00:00:46.940> actual

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
you hit record it'll have the actual

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.360 
you hit record it'll have the actual
time<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.390> took<00:00:48.570> for<00:00:48.840> you<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.379> press<00:00:50.160> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
time it took for you to press the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.360 
time it took for you to press the
buttons<00:00:50.750> and<00:00:51.750> you<00:00:52.620> don't<00:00:52.770> want<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:52.980> you<00:00:53.250> want

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
buttons and you don't want that you want

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.450 
buttons and you don't want that you want
a<00:00:53.550> default<00:00:53.969> delay<00:00:54.270> so<00:00:54.329> no<00:00:54.570> matter<00:00:54.719> what<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.110> do

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:55.460 
a default delay so no matter what you do

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:58.869 
a default delay so no matter what you do
it'll<00:00:56.460> always<00:00:56.640> have<00:00:56.969> this<00:00:57.629> time<00:00:58.230> in<00:00:58.500> between

00:00:58.869 --> 00:00:58.879 
it'll always have this time in between

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:02.270 
it'll always have this time in between
so<00:00:59.879> since<00:01:00.840> I<00:01:00.960> want<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.230> right-click<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:02.100> will

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so since I want to right-click I will

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.789 
so since I want to right-click I will
hit<00:01:02.370> record<00:01:02.789> and<00:01:02.969> right-click<00:01:03.570> twice<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.470> hit

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
hit record and right-click twice I hit

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:08.660 
hit record and right-click twice I hit
stop<00:01:05.040> and<00:01:05.689> now<00:01:06.689> my<00:01:06.869> macro<00:01:07.260> is<00:01:07.320> done<00:01:07.650> so<00:01:08.430> what<00:01:08.640> I

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
stop and now my macro is done so what I

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.960 
stop and now my macro is done so what I
do<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:09.150> I<00:01:09.960> go<00:01:10.110> to<00:01:10.170> my<00:01:10.350> mouse<00:01:10.530> I<00:01:10.860> picked<00:01:11.820> the

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
do is I go to my mouse I picked the

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:13.640 
do is I go to my mouse I picked the
button<00:01:12.240> where<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.420> want<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> macro<00:01:13.020> to<00:01:13.200> be<00:01:13.409> I

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
button where I want the macro to be I

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.880 
button where I want the macro to be I
think<00:01:13.920> in<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.310> video<00:01:14.549> it<00:01:14.640> was<00:01:14.790> this<00:01:14.970> and<00:01:15.590> then

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:17.890 
think in the video it was this and then

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.090 
think in the video it was this and then
I<00:01:17.950> go<00:01:18.880> to<00:01:20.070> the<00:01:21.070> de<00:01:21.820> macro<00:01:22.240> and<00:01:23.010> for<00:01:24.010> the

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
I go to the de macro and for the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.940 
I go to the de macro and for the
playback<00:01:24.460> option<00:01:24.970> you<00:01:25.450> want<00:01:25.570> to<00:01:25.780> play<00:01:26.380> while

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950 
playback option you want to play while

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.160 
playback option you want to play while
assigned<00:01:27.550> keys<00:01:27.820> pressed<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:28.540> as<00:01:28.840> long<00:01:29.020> as

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
assigned keys pressed so as long as

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:30.480 
assigned keys pressed so as long as
you're<00:01:29.650> holding<00:01:29.800> it<00:01:30.100> down

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
you're holding it down

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.810 
you're holding it down
it's<00:01:30.640> right-clicking<00:01:32.310> if<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.460> have<00:01:33.580> play

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:33.820 
it's right-clicking if you have play

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:35.460 
it's right-clicking if you have play
once<00:01:34.090> it'll<00:01:34.450> only<00:01:34.600> right-click<00:01:35.110> as<00:01:35.259> many

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
once it'll only right-click as many

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.710 
once it'll only right-click as many
times<00:01:35.770> as<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.190> did<00:01:36.400> when<00:01:36.610> you<00:01:36.640> recorded<00:01:37.360> it<00:01:37.450> I

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 
times as you did when you recorded it I

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.980 
times as you did when you recorded it I
think<00:01:38.680> playing<00:01:38.950> multiple<00:01:39.220> times<00:01:39.610> is<00:01:40.119> you<00:01:40.720> set

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
think playing multiple times is you set

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:42.300 
think playing multiple times is you set
the<00:01:41.020> number<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.470> times<00:01:41.680> you<00:01:41.860> want<00:01:41.979> it<00:01:42.130> to

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.310 
the number of times you want it to

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.330 
the number of times you want it to
playback<00:01:42.820> you<00:01:43.119> don't<00:01:43.300> want<00:01:43.450> that<00:01:43.630> and<00:01:44.340> toggle

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
playback you don't want that and toggle

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.090 
playback you don't want that and toggle
is<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.570> just<00:01:46.780> hit<00:01:47.170> it<00:01:47.290> once<00:01:47.470> and<00:01:47.650> it<00:01:47.740> will<00:01:47.830> keep

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:48.100 
is you just hit it once and it will keep

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.370 
is you just hit it once and it will keep
doing<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.490> until<00:01:48.729> you<00:01:48.790> hit<00:01:48.970> it<00:01:49.090> again<00:01:49.330> so<00:01:50.320> you

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
doing it until you hit it again so you

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:52.830 
doing it until you hit it again so you
want<00:01:50.920> play<00:01:51.220> well<00:01:51.399> assign<00:01:51.610> keys<00:01:51.850> rest<00:01:52.119> it<00:01:52.509> save

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
want play well assign keys rest it save

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.400 
want play well assign keys rest it save
and<00:01:53.560> now<00:01:53.950> when<00:01:54.369> I<00:01:54.399> hold<00:01:54.580> this<00:01:54.820> button<00:01:55.200> it<00:01:56.200> will

and now when I hold this button it will

00:01:56.410 --> 00:02:01.800 
and now when I hold this button it will
spam<00:01:57.220> right<00:01:57.430> click<00:01:59.970> and<00:02:00.970> then<00:02:01.000> just<00:02:01.390> make<00:02:01.600> sure
