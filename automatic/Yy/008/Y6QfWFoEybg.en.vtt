00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:05.620
 in my word arbex he developed the project I do not know how to draw due 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.620
 knowing and re-creating trees 

00:00:12.359 --> 00:00:15.359
 I realized then that children are a difficulty 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.580
 there are drawings that make comments would guarantee that they did not know but would win 

00:00:20.579 --> 00:00:24.199
 they always reproduced the same stereotypical ones and did not do well 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:25.200
 similar 

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.980
 so I thought about developing a project where kids could 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.119
 express more freely develop your own design 

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.960
 each one will have a family and with a screen that has 

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.600
 the pomegranate is about to write 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.470
 with the economy without action 

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.130
 they sang in chorus 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:44.930
 many times these places were all 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:45.780
 cereals 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.100
 great-grandson in the next class then we observe works of several artists 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:56.370
 Brazilians and also from outside our country I tried to choose good news 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.530
 varied 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.740
 deep 

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.800
 it will make my hand a lot harder on my body and marlon gotta get back on the bike 

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.750
 nadal get there on the table in morumbi 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.310
 let me die 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.330
 is what indicates that the children analyzes five years 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.670
 then there will be more sturdy 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.280
 greider won correction prizes if they drag the fish 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.030
 various school activities in tincture 

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.770
 now you are going to try the front and back on one was in April 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.350
 Bissau 10 years old 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.330
 and does not come out in the next years and nationality of the two 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.690
 part of the school 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:40.130
 after they did not realize mother of jesus 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.440
 and that they began to become increasingly evident to them 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.970
 the students collected the re-creation sheets 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.170
 but quickly choose 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:52.710
 then it begins to be very evident the differences of the areas 

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.299
 so we did during the field trips 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:00.049
 in separate feel each child chooses a tree and made a drawing of 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.399
 observation with charcoal 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.480
 Kuwait 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:07.480
 a year that the left side quite the opposite 

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:11.290
 so it's no wonder with ears out 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:15.440
 is more a comparative with the daily average verified exhibition space 

00:02:16.689 --> 00:02:19.689
 during finals 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:24.279
 the other then go if sometimes the children have changed in the 

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:27.690
 last time we performed the same entity for the first time 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.839
 those who evidently prove that sometimes over a five 

00:02:31.839 --> 00:02:34.839
 the chancellor 

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:39.449
 who bet subabdominal changed cheer that they leave us in catende cleiton ciel 

00:02:39.449 --> 00:02:41.699
 in the same way at 3:00 p.m. 

00:02:41.699 --> 00:02:42.889
 next year 

00:02:42.889 --> 00:02:46.950
 pathetic timely the children were also then develops this much 

00:02:46.949 --> 00:02:51.529
 imagination that passion that until then was 60 let's say the 

00:02:51.529 --> 00:02:54.290
 question of the imagination, each one has his way of winning
