flattening bamboo has a number of

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:12.940 
flattening bamboo has a number of
advantages<00:01:10.700> over<00:01:11.180> weaving<00:01:11.869> or<00:01:12.080> reinforcement

advantages over weaving or reinforcement

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.969 
advantages over weaving or reinforcement
because<00:01:13.400> you<00:01:14.240> can<00:01:14.450> use<00:01:14.720> dried<00:01:15.110> bamboo<00:01:15.290> and<00:01:15.680> you

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
because you can use dried bamboo and you

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.800 
because you can use dried bamboo and you
don't<00:01:16.159> reduce<00:01:16.490> the<00:01:16.700> wall<00:01:16.850> thickness<00:01:17.090> so<00:01:17.780> it

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
don't reduce the wall thickness so it

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.230 
don't reduce the wall thickness so it

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:54.340 
flattened by splitting at even intervals

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.430 
flattened by splitting at even intervals
with<00:02:54.850> the<00:02:54.970> chisel<00:02:55.330> and<00:02:55.450> mallet<00:02:55.540> the<00:02:56.230> end

with the chisel and mallet the end

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.590 
with the chisel and mallet the end
result<00:02:56.920> is<00:02:57.100> a<00:02:57.160> perfectly<00:02:57.790> flattened<00:02:58.269> piece<00:02:58.420> of

result is a perfectly flattened piece of

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.479 
result is a perfectly flattened piece of
bamboo<00:02:58.810> which<00:02:59.590> can<00:02:59.799> be<00:02:59.920> used<00:03:00.160> for<00:03:00.400> the

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
bamboo which can be used for the

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.130 
bamboo which can be used for the
construction<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.360> walls<00:03:01.540> of<00:03:01.750> your<00:03:01.810> bamboo
