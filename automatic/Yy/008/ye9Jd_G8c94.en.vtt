00:00:00.319 --> 00:00:04.830
 with a carlos for this case of the 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.629
 centrifugal engines for the brand 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:09.690
 electrolux we have had two 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.400
 inconveniences which we have tried 

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:16.730
 to give solution the first case is that 

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:18.619
 the spin is reversed from the engines 

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:20.750
 that you give us has the money 

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:23.840
 counter-clockwise in which we 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:26.180
 we need the turn that is schedule already 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.849
 that the position of the motor base 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.590
 where the brake is located is 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:34.579
 invested 

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:37.219
 in this case we have this 

00:00:34.579 --> 00:00:40.219
 as you see we have replaced some 

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:43.280
 bolts with nut and we have changed the 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.620
 Top cabinet position with 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.710
 regarding the lower base so that 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.030
 match at all points as a reference 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:55.309
 since it determines the position of the brake and 

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.119
 the rotation of the inverted motor 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:01:01.129
 we need the time shift 

00:00:58.119 --> 00:01:05.000
 for in that sense in this case they come 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.320
 all counter-clockwise you the cabinet that 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.320
 you give us the engines 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:15.740
 the position of the base where is located the 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.740
 brake has another position 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:21.770
 which does not fit in the washing machine 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.080
 here the modification that we are 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:27.980
 realizing is that the base pin 

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:30.060
 where the brake is located has a 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:34.140
 straight position 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.140
 in all positions here and here as 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.960
 it shows 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.210
 quickly 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.250
 is a reference base a position 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.520
 referential so that we can determine 

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:46.810
 that this engine will fit and a technician 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.479
 go directly to the house of 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:53.619
 customer replace more easily 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:56.850
 this engine now this engine gives us a 

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:59.680
 cost and additional position cost 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.540
 we invest in the cost of the bolts and 

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:03.759
 staff workforce that is going to 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.850
 install and who is doing this 

00:02:03.759 --> 00:02:10.360
 modification in this case would be more than 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.250
 all inform you for possible to 

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.280
 future applications that have that 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:18.250
 position so that you can give us 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.130
 what code or how to order the engine that 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.160
 we need 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.740
 as for the coil when disarming the 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:27.570
 motor is seen because it is very thin you 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.690
 I would be providing images to see 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.690
 the difference 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:36.430
 the 70- watt 65-watt coil 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.650
 it has much more winding much more copper 

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.920
 in this case the copper that we see 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:44.290
 it's like it's a 60- watt motor 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:46.030
 then this there if to see if please 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.210
 if here with the factory we could 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:51.210
 indicate the rated power of the motor 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.300
 for this case we have not had problems 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:57.940
 with the operation the solution that 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.700
 we have done is change the bolts 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.340
 locate the position 

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:07.130
 and turn the core to reverse the core 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:09.020
 so that the turn can be reversed 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:11.930
 that is only to be able to inform 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:14.870
 for possible future requests that 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:17.020
 be later and many thanks to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.020
 the
