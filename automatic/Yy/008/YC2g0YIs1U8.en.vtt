00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.087
 "Well, hello everyone, my name is Tyler Oakley 

00:00:02.087 --> 00:00:04.142
 and you always have so many questions 

00:00:04.142 --> 00:00:05.848
 and I always have so many answers, 

00:00:05.848 --> 00:00:08.867
 which means it's time for some 

00:00:08.867 --> 00:00:10.539
 Questions and Answers. 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.808
 I usually do Questions and Answers asking you 

00:00:12.808 --> 00:00:15.078
 to send your questions to Twitter, but today I said, 

00:00:15.078 --> 00:00:16.011
 "Do you know? 

00:00:16.011 --> 00:00:17.238
 I just finished a month 

00:00:17.238 --> 00:00:18.597
 collaborations with vloggers, 

00:00:18.597 --> 00:00:20.327
 I want to collaborate with you as well. " 

00:00:20.327 --> 00:00:23.786
 So I asked you to send my questions to Skype. 

00:00:23.786 --> 00:00:26.584
 You had to add me and then send me a video with your question 

00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:28.221
 and I'm very excited to see your videos, 

00:00:28.221 --> 00:00:30.021
 because I think, "This is finally an opportunity 

00:00:30.021 --> 00:00:32.260
 to put the faces of some of the users 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.454
 and I can get to know you a little better. " 

00:00:34.454 --> 00:00:35.883
 Let's hear what you wanted to ask me. 

00:00:35.883 --> 00:00:38.344
 "Hey, Tyler, my question of Questions and Answers is, 

00:00:38.344 --> 00:00:41.445
 when Troy will meet Queen Jackie. 

00:00:41.445 --> 00:00:43.819
 Because you already met his family, 

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:48.819
 that's why we wanted Troy to meet Jackie and make a deal. 

00:00:49.122 --> 00:00:51.299
 - Oh, that's a good question. 

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:53.285
 Well, yes, as you know, I was in Australia, 

00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:55.543
 to meet the Troy family. 

00:00:55.543 --> 00:00:57.690
 You know, these times ... 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.549
 They are approaching, that's all I'm going to say. 

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:00.987
 I do not know when, 

00:01:00.987 --> 00:01:04.411
 but we have plans to come to Michigan in the future. 

00:01:04.411 --> 00:01:05.664
 I know you hate the word "soon" 

00:01:05.664 --> 00:01:06.702
 so I will not say: "Soon is," 

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:09.176
 but it is the near future. (laughing) 

00:01:09.176 --> 00:01:12.160
 - My question is, from all your videos in August, 

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:14.494
 what was the most fun to shoot? 

00:01:14.494 --> 00:01:17.698
 Which was the psychologically most memorable for filming? 

00:01:17.698 --> 00:01:20.055
 And what was the dirtiest of filming? 

00:01:20.055 --> 00:01:22.881
 - The most filthy thing to shoot was 

00:01:22.881 --> 00:01:25.795
 this with SUPERFRUIT, Scott and Mitch, 

00:01:25.795 --> 00:01:28.279
 where we had to put our hands behind 

00:01:28.279 --> 00:01:30.682
 and eat a whole bunch of spaghetti. 

00:01:30.682 --> 00:01:34.434
 And the funniest one might have been 

00:01:34.434 --> 00:01:36.262
 this with Connor. 

00:01:36.262 --> 00:01:38.145
 We always have a lot of fun with it 

00:01:38.145 --> 00:01:39.721
 and we made a whispering challenge, 

00:01:39.721 --> 00:01:41.463
 where we whispered sentences to each other 

00:01:41.463 --> 00:01:42.682
 and we laughed all the time. 

00:01:42.682 --> 00:01:43.948
 Also, with Zoe, 

00:01:43.948 --> 00:01:45.782
 we always have fun when we make the videos together. 

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:49.021
 And psychologically the most memorable 

00:01:49.021 --> 00:01:51.666
 it was with Dan. 

00:01:51.666 --> 00:01:53.305
 (laughs) It was just ... 

00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.705
 We had to watch very strange things. 

00:01:56.705 --> 00:01:58.621
 This month was very funny, 

00:01:58.621 --> 00:02:00.455
 there were a few who stood out. 

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:03.484
 "My question to you is, what's the smartest thing, 

00:02:03.484 --> 00:02:06.480
 what did you ever smell in your life? 

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.975
 - Okay, this is (laughs) ... 

00:02:07.975 --> 00:02:11.312
 This question asks me many things. 

00:02:11.312 --> 00:02:15.307
 But the smartest thing I've ever smelled, 

00:02:15.307 --> 00:02:16.792
 is ... 

00:02:16.792 --> 00:02:18.556
 (laughs) I do not know. 

00:02:18.556 --> 00:02:21.331
 I smelled many things in my life, girl, 

00:02:21.331 --> 00:02:25.848
 you have no idea where my nose was. (laughing) 

00:02:25.848 --> 00:02:27.111
 I will not answer that. 

00:02:27.111 --> 00:02:28.242
 You can... 

00:02:28.242 --> 00:02:29.331
 I mean, I'm sure you'll be able to think 

00:02:29.331 --> 00:02:31.200
 for something even more smelly to smell 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.637
 in a fan's story, so go ahead. 

00:02:34.637 --> 00:02:37.440
 "Hi, Tyler, my name is Benji, and my question for you is, 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:40.585
 after Darren Chris, which celebrity you fall. 

00:02:40.585 --> 00:02:41.659
 - Hey, Benji! 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:43.909
 Well, I fall on a few celebrities. 

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:45.336
 I'm very thirsty. 

00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.171
 If you do not know this for me, learn it now, 

00:02:47.171 --> 00:02:48.889
 because they all know it 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:50.933
 and my thirst has to be quenched. 

00:02:50.933 --> 00:02:53.893
 I love Zack Efron, I love Nick Jonas, 

00:02:53.893 --> 00:02:57.097
 (sigh) Big Sean, I feel a great thirst 

00:02:57.097 --> 00:03:00.778
 and it seems that nothing can quench her. 

00:03:00.778 --> 00:03:02.635
 So if you know any of these guys, call me. 

00:03:02.635 --> 00:03:03.888
 - Hello, Tyler. 

00:03:03.888 --> 00:03:05.909
 "Well, we have a question about yours 

00:03:05.909 --> 00:03:07.777
 - Questions and Answers. 

00:03:07.777 --> 00:03:08.996
 "Well, our question is, 

00:03:08.996 --> 00:03:10.912
 if there was a movie about your life, 

00:03:10.912 --> 00:03:11.853
 which role would he play? 

00:03:11.853 --> 00:03:12.816
 We love you. 

00:03:12.816 --> 00:03:13.896
 - Bye. 

00:03:13.896 --> 00:03:16.055
 - Hey, ladies, (laughs) I think it's really fun, 

00:03:16.055 --> 00:03:17.657
 that I can finally see your faces. 

00:03:17.657 --> 00:03:20.280
 But if there was a movie about my life, 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.129
 I want no one but me to play 

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.230
 Ellen Degerner. 

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.529
 And then my mother must be someone 

00:03:27.529 --> 00:03:31.225
 with perfect acting skills, exactly the same in appearance 

00:03:31.225 --> 00:03:33.652
 and it will be none other than 

00:03:33.652 --> 00:03:34.871
 Miranda Singles. 

00:03:34.871 --> 00:03:37.030
 - Okay, my question to you is, 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.747
 what's the strangest collaboration you've ever done? 

00:03:39.747 --> 00:03:42.267
 "Okay, I've done millions and millions 

00:03:42.267 --> 00:03:43.817
 collaborations, obviously. 

00:03:43.817 --> 00:03:45.233
 I am the Queen of Collaborations, 

00:03:45.233 --> 00:03:48.252
 but my beloved most strange, which 

00:03:48.252 --> 00:03:50.985
 the most out of my comfort zone, the collaboration I've ever done, 

00:03:50.985 --> 00:03:52.904
 is something I did, 

00:03:52.904 --> 00:03:55.529
 when I had only 4,000 subscribers 

00:03:55.529 --> 00:03:57.584
 and that was a few years ago 

00:03:57.584 --> 00:04:01.078
 and there was none other than Grace Helbig. 

00:04:01.078 --> 00:04:02.806
 We made a video on her channel, 

00:04:02.806 --> 00:04:04.768
 where I had to do something like a sketch 

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:07.560
 and as you know, I do not sketch. 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:09.537
 So it was strange to me, 

00:04:09.537 --> 00:04:11.817
 but it gets very sweet 

00:04:11.817 --> 00:04:14.000
 and looking back in time, 

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.635
 given all the things she has achieved 

00:04:16.635 --> 00:04:17.690
 and all the things we have done together, 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.524
 with my people, 

00:04:19.524 --> 00:04:21.544
 it's just crazy to look back in time, 

00:04:21.544 --> 00:04:23.378
 when we were just babies, 

00:04:23.378 --> 00:04:24.481
 who collaborate together. 

00:04:24.481 --> 00:04:26.525
 - How do you make your favorite advertiser notice you? 

00:04:26.525 --> 00:04:29.287
 Because I have no luck, 

00:04:29.287 --> 00:04:30.610
 except when I made a tweed in my favorites, 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.864
 thank you, by the way. 

00:04:31.864 --> 00:04:33.698
 "Girl, it's easy to be spotted by me! 

00:04:33.698 --> 00:04:35.392
 I feel I'm on the internet 

00:04:35.392 --> 00:04:36.878
 all day, every day. 

00:04:36.878 --> 00:04:39.049
 So all you have to do is maintain your level 

00:04:39.049 --> 00:04:41.336
 of beautiful, fresh, cruel amazement 

00:04:41.336 --> 00:04:44.111
 and continue to break the game and see everything. 

00:04:44.111 --> 00:04:45.874
 "Hello, Queen Tyler, my name is Caitlin 

00:04:45.874 --> 00:04:48.708
 and my question to you is if you offer your own TV show, 

00:04:48.708 --> 00:04:50.298
 will you give up on YouTube to do it? 

00:04:50.298 --> 00:04:51.378
 - This is very interesting, 

00:04:51.378 --> 00:04:54.176
 because I actually received several such suggestions. 

00:04:54.176 --> 00:04:56.510
 Even after graduating from college, 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.890
 I applied for a job and everyone was asking me: 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:01.037
 "If you get this job, will you leave YouTube?" 

00:05:01.037 --> 00:05:02.431
 It was the hardest thing to do 

00:05:02.431 --> 00:05:04.391
 and probably the reason why I had none 

00:05:04.391 --> 00:05:06.910
 inspiring job I wanted after college, 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.362
 is because I said, "No." 

00:05:08.362 --> 00:05:09.824
 Because I feel that to give everything by myself 

00:05:09.824 --> 00:05:12.784
 in another environment, be it a work or a television show, 

00:05:12.784 --> 00:05:17.515
 I still have to stay myself out of this career. 

00:05:17.515 --> 00:05:19.953
 And that is to be a slogan 

00:05:19.953 --> 00:05:21.532
 and for people who do not understand this, 

00:05:21.532 --> 00:05:24.015
 they do not understand me and do not deserve to work. 

00:05:24.015 --> 00:05:26.374
 "If he was not a vendor, 

00:05:26.374 --> 00:05:28.370
 what would you do instead? 

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:30.035
 "If I was not a messenger, 

00:05:30.035 --> 00:05:33.900
 I would probably have been a model. (laughing) 

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.851
 Sometimes I do these fun photo sessions 

00:05:35.851 --> 00:05:38.119
 and I feel ridiculous, 

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:40.674
 because I smile with my eyes and shoot from different angles 

00:05:40.674 --> 00:05:43.194
 and process each particle of the camera. 

00:05:43.194 --> 00:05:45.933
 But I'm not perfect for this job, 

00:05:45.933 --> 00:05:47.882
 but I would be happy to try (laughs). 

00:05:47.882 --> 00:05:49.752
 As I said, sometimes I get this opportunity 

00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:51.843
 when photographers want to do something. 

00:05:51.843 --> 00:05:54.641
 Once I made a small photo shoot. 

00:05:54.641 --> 00:05:55.720
 I think it was about a month ago 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.694
 and I have a whole bunch of fun pictures of her, 

00:05:57.694 --> 00:05:59.377
 but I will not publish them all in Twitter 

00:05:59.377 --> 00:06:01.513
 and Tambler and everywhere, because it's too much. 

00:06:01.513 --> 00:06:03.300
 I've shown you some of the photos, 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.880
 but if you want to see the rest, 

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.677
 I will put them in a folder that you can download. 

00:06:07.677 --> 00:06:09.581
 All you have to do is click the link below 

00:06:09.581 --> 00:06:10.754
 to my OneDrive account. 

00:06:10.754 --> 00:06:13.599
 There are exclusive pictures if you want to see them. 

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:15.143
 The link is below. 

00:06:15.143 --> 00:06:16.222
 But that's all for today. 

00:06:16.222 --> 00:06:17.453
 If you liked these Questions and Answers, 

00:06:17.453 --> 00:06:18.672
 press the thumb up 

00:06:18.672 --> 00:06:21.052
 and I can do more of these reps and answers. 

00:06:21.052 --> 00:06:22.956
 But yes, thank you very much 

00:06:22.956 --> 00:06:24.331
 for the entire support this week. 

00:06:24.331 --> 00:06:25.921
 I have many fun projects, 

00:06:25.921 --> 00:06:28.122
 as you know from my latest video. 

00:06:28.122 --> 00:06:30.445
 My tour just breaks them. 

00:06:30.445 --> 00:06:33.612
 If you want to buy tickets, the links are below. 

00:06:33.612 --> 00:06:35.248
 Will write if there are still tickets, 

00:06:35.248 --> 00:06:37.093
 but it may or may not be there. 

00:06:37.093 --> 00:06:38.695
 Click below, you will see. 

00:06:38.695 --> 00:06:41.726
 My podcast became such a hit. 

00:06:41.726 --> 00:06:43.466
 You give me so much love. 

00:06:43.466 --> 00:06:45.186
 If you have not checked the first episode, 

00:06:45.186 --> 00:06:46.532
 the link to it is below. 

00:06:46.532 --> 00:06:48.935
 Subscribe to iTunes, it's free. 

00:06:48.935 --> 00:06:50.514
 Many of you say, "Do you know what? 

00:06:50.514 --> 00:06:51.709
 I have no money, Tyler. 

00:06:51.709 --> 00:06:53.370
 I do not have the budget for some of these things. " 

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:56.347
 It's free, so it's a gift for you. 

00:06:56.347 --> 00:06:57.950
 It will be every week, 

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.888
 so be sure to subscribe to iTunes. 

00:06:59.888 --> 00:07:02.686
 And I hope you continue to love him. 

00:07:02.686 --> 00:07:04.811
 But that's all, I hope you have an incredible life 

00:07:04.811 --> 00:07:06.645
 and until next time, until recently.
