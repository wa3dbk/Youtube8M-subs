00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
lot better than I transmitter because

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.259 
lot better than I transmitter because
you<00:02:28.950> don't<00:02:29.070> have<00:02:29.190> a<00:02:29.310> feedback<00:02:29.760> or<00:02:30.060> anything

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:55.070 
myself I don't know how the legroom is

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:58.790 
myself I don't know how the legroom is
but<00:03:56.070> you<00:03:56.489> know<00:03:56.609> what<00:03:57.000> can<00:03:57.150> you<00:03:57.269> expect<00:03:57.680> name<00:03:58.680> is

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:58.800 
but you know what can you expect name is

00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:02.270 
but you know what can you expect name is
see<00:03:59.670> if<00:03:59.730> it'll<00:03:59.849> fire<00:04:00.060> up<00:04:00.379> like<00:04:01.379> I<00:04:01.530> said<00:04:01.590> it<00:04:01.920> run

00:04:02.270 --> 00:04:02.280 
see if it'll fire up like I said it run

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.420 
see if it'll fire up like I said it run
area<00:04:02.760> it<00:04:03.209> idles<00:04:03.599> fine

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
area it idles fine

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:08.319 
area it idles fine
but<00:04:05.769> like<00:04:06.769> when<00:04:07.099> you<00:04:07.219> give<00:04:07.370> it<00:04:07.489> gas<00:04:07.640> it<00:04:07.700> wants

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
but like when you give it gas it wants

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.509 
but like when you give it gas it wants
to<00:04:08.510> die<00:04:08.900> it<00:04:08.959> runner<00:04:09.409> in<00:04:09.590> pretty<00:04:09.890> rough<00:04:10.069> so<00:04:10.400> I'm

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:10.519 
to die it runner in pretty rough so I'm

00:04:10.519 --> 00:04:12.670 
to die it runner in pretty rough so I'm
going<00:04:10.640> to<00:04:10.760> bring<00:04:11.689> in<00:04:11.840> there<00:04:12.019> put<00:04:12.260> some<00:04:12.409> spark

00:04:12.670 --> 00:04:12.680 
going to bring in there put some spark

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.819 
going to bring in there put some spark
plugs<00:04:12.890> on<00:04:13.329> you<00:04:14.329> spark<00:04:14.870> plug<00:04:14.989> wires<00:04:15.200> to<00:04:15.590> and

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
plugs on you spark plug wires to and

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:17.430 
plugs on you spark plug wires to and
then<00:04:15.920> if<00:04:16.009> that<00:04:16.130> doesn't<00:04:16.160> clear<00:04:16.609> it<00:04:16.699> up<00:04:16.850> I'll

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:17.440 
then if that doesn't clear it up I'll

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:19.629 
then if that doesn't clear it up I'll
still<00:04:18.440> looking<00:04:18.680> at<00:04:18.739> fuel<00:04:18.979> filters<00:04:19.310> and<00:04:19.459> stuff

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:19.639 
still looking at fuel filters and stuff

00:04:19.639 --> 00:04:28.180 
still looking at fuel filters and stuff
like<00:04:19.759> that<00:04:26.229> so<00:04:27.229> it<00:04:27.350> actually<00:04:27.590> doesn't<00:04:27.860> idol

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
like that so it actually doesn't idol

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.920 
like that so it actually doesn't idol
that<00:04:28.340> bad<00:04:30.789> but<00:04:31.789> yeah<00:04:31.970> like<00:04:32.150> once<00:04:32.360> it<00:04:32.479> starts<00:04:32.750> to

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:32.930 
that bad but yeah like once it starts to

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:35.770 
that bad but yeah like once it starts to
actually<00:04:33.880> drive<00:04:34.880> it<00:04:35.120> gets<00:04:35.300> a<00:04:35.479> little<00:04:35.600> bit

00:04:35.770 --> 00:04:35.780 
actually drive it gets a little bit

00:04:35.780 --> 00:05:42.719 
actually drive it gets a little bit
worse

00:05:42.719 --> 00:05:42.729 

00:05:42.729 --> 00:05:56.099 

oh<00:05:48.180> that's<00:05:49.180> about<00:05:49.449> it<00:05:52.919> there<00:05:53.919> it<00:05:54.009> is
