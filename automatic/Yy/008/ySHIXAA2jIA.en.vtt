training<00:00:53.980> most<00:00:54.309> people<00:00:54.400> lead<00:00:55.300> them<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.690> as

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
training most people lead them and as

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.139 
training most people lead them and as
that<00:00:56.020> final<00:00:56.590> thought<00:00:56.860> of<00:00:57.129> Allegro<00:00:57.640> account<00:00:57.940> so

00:00:58.139 --> 00:00:58.149 
that final thought of Allegro account so

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:00.270 
that final thought of Allegro account so
what<00:00:58.270> I<00:00:58.300> do<00:00:58.420> is<00:00:58.750> give<00:00:59.590> them<00:00:59.739> either<00:01:00.010> their<00:01:00.250> own

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:00.280 
what I do is give them either their own

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.189 
what I do is give them either their own
workout<00:01:00.790> or<00:01:01.030> train<00:01:01.329> them<00:01:01.480> at<00:01:01.629> the<00:01:01.780> beginning

00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:02.199 
workout or train them at the beginning

workout or train them at the beginning
of<00:01:02.230> a<00:01:02.739> leg<00:01:02.920> workout<00:01:03.070> therefore<00:01:03.850> I<00:01:03.879> can<00:01:04.030> hit

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.210 
of a leg workout therefore I can hit

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:05.880 
of a leg workout therefore I can hit
them<00:01:04.330> when<00:01:04.510> they're<00:01:04.690> fresh<00:01:04.930> and<00:01:05.199> give<00:01:05.740> them

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:05.890 
them when they're fresh and give them

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.859 
them when they're fresh and give them
all<00:01:06.130> the<00:01:06.220> attention<00:01:06.729> they<00:01:07.000> deserve<00:01:07.030> to<00:01:07.660> really

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
all the attention they deserve to really

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.109 
all the attention they deserve to really
encourage<00:01:08.229> growth<00:01:08.729> talking<00:01:09.729> about<00:01:09.910> growth

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:10.119 
encourage growth talking about growth

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:12.480 
encourage growth talking about growth
let's<00:01:10.450> have<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.630> look<00:01:10.810> at<00:01:10.930> way<00:01:11.160> with<00:01:12.160> calves

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
let's have a look at way with calves

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.920 
let's have a look at way with calves
there<00:01:12.850> are<00:01:12.910> similar<00:01:13.210> muscle<00:01:13.330> group<00:01:13.660> to<00:01:13.840> the

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
there are similar muscle group to the

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:14.580 
there are similar muscle group to the
abdominals

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
abdominals

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.190 
abdominals
there<00:01:14.800> are<00:01:14.950> slow<00:01:15.250> twitch<00:01:15.580> red<00:01:16.450> muscle<00:01:17.020> fibers

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:17.200 
there are slow twitch red muscle fibers

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.770 
there are slow twitch red muscle fibers
so<00:01:17.680> they<00:01:17.860> respond<00:01:18.250> best<00:01:18.430> to<00:01:18.580> volume<00:01:19.030> so<00:01:19.540> keep

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
so they respond best to volume so keep

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:22.140 
so they respond best to volume so keep
the<00:01:19.900> way<00:01:20.050> moderate<00:01:20.979> to<00:01:21.130> heavy<00:01:21.340> as<00:01:21.700> long<00:01:22.000> as<00:01:22.090> you

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:22.150 
the way moderate to heavy as long as you

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.109 
the way moderate to heavy as long as you
can<00:01:22.270> get<00:01:22.360> 20<00:01:22.840> 30<00:01:23.050> repetitions<00:01:23.619> for<00:01:24.130> each<00:01:24.520> set

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:25.119 
can get 20 30 repetitions for each set

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:27.900 
can get 20 30 repetitions for each set
and<00:01:25.810> then<00:01:26.050> ankles<00:01:26.860> knees<00:01:27.009> and<00:01:27.070> hips<00:01:27.310> keep<00:01:27.729> them

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:27.910 
and then ankles knees and hips keep them

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.359 
and then ankles knees and hips keep them
aligned<00:01:28.300> so<00:01:28.840> that<00:01:29.110> the<00:01:29.229> calf<00:01:29.470> muscle<00:01:29.890> is<00:01:30.039> fully

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
aligned so that the calf muscle is fully

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:32.609 
aligned so that the calf muscle is fully
working<00:01:30.880> across<00:01:31.450> the<00:01:31.539> whole<00:01:31.869> width<00:01:32.320> of<00:01:32.500> that

00:01:32.609 --> 00:01:32.619 
working across the whole width of that

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:34.770 
working across the whole width of that
muscle<00:01:32.890> you're<00:01:33.369> not<00:01:33.520> shifting<00:01:33.910> the<00:01:34.000> ankles<00:01:34.360> in

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 
muscle you're not shifting the ankles in

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.650 
muscle you're not shifting the ankles in
or<00:01:35.229> out<00:01:35.380> I'll<00:01:35.890> show<00:01:36.190> you<00:01:36.250> later<00:01:36.520> on<00:01:36.789> how<00:01:37.030> we<00:01:37.390> can

is<00:02:14.920> what's<00:02:15.130> going<00:02:15.280> to<00:02:15.340> help<00:02:15.400> add<00:02:15.849> some

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:15.910 
is what's going to help add some

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.660 
is what's going to help add some
thickness<00:02:16.450> and<00:02:16.810> size<00:02:17.170> to<00:02:17.709> the<00:02:17.830> front<00:02:18.160> part<00:02:18.370> of

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:18.670 
thickness and size to the front part of

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.240 
thickness and size to the front part of
our<00:02:19.330> calf<00:02:19.690> and<00:02:19.900> shin<00:02:20.140> area<00:02:20.380> so

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:22.250 
our calf and shin area so

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.580 
our calf and shin area so
with<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:22.910> foot<00:02:23.150> peg<00:02:23.360> we're<00:02:23.630> gonna<00:02:23.750> unlock<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590 
with a foot peg we're gonna unlock the

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:28.150 
with a foot peg we're gonna unlock the
machine<00:02:24.730> extend<00:02:25.730> the<00:02:25.820> legs<00:02:26.650> then<00:02:27.650> we<00:02:27.770> sit<00:02:28.010> down

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.160 
machine extend the legs then we sit down

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.220 
machine extend the legs then we sit down
into<00:02:28.580> it's<00:02:28.700> our<00:02:28.910> knees<00:02:29.180> are<00:02:29.420> at<00:02:29.720> about<00:02:30.080> the

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230 
into it's our knees are at about the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:32.830 
into it's our knees are at about the
right<00:02:30.440> angle<00:02:30.860> 90<00:02:31.040> degrees<00:02:31.460> then<00:02:31.940> here<00:02:32.240> and

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:32.840 
right angle 90 degrees then here and

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:35.620 
right angle 90 degrees then here and
then<00:02:33.020> we<00:02:33.080> do<00:02:33.200> the<00:02:33.320> same<00:02:34.150> heel<00:02:35.150> flexion

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:35.630 
then we do the same heel flexion

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:38.230 
then we do the same heel flexion
movement<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:37.340> the<00:02:37.460> cops<00:02:37.700> are<00:02:37.910> still<00:02:38.090> working

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
movement so the cops are still working

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.820 
movement so the cops are still working
you<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.660> see<00:02:38.840> now<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:39.230> having<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.530> work<00:02:39.680> a

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:39.830 
you can see now it's having to work a

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:42.490 
you can see now it's having to work a
lot<00:02:39.980> harder<00:02:40.040> on<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:41.000> inner<00:02:41.300> area<00:02:41.720> by<00:02:42.320> not

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:42.500 
lot harder on this inner area by not

00:02:42.500 --> 00:03:13.300 
lot harder on this inner area by not
keeping<00:02:42.680> my<00:02:42.950> knees<00:02:43.190> bed

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:13.310 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:15.800 

so<00:03:14.310> the<00:03:14.430> key<00:03:14.670> to<00:03:14.730> performing<00:03:15.450> this<00:03:15.540> exercise

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
so the key to performing this exercise

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.660 
so the key to performing this exercise
correctly<00:03:16.350> is<00:03:16.710> to<00:03:16.860> try<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.100> keep<00:03:17.250> those<00:03:17.460> knees

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:17.670 
correctly is to try and keep those knees

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:20.030 
correctly is to try and keep those knees
bent<00:03:17.730> at<00:03:18.300> all<00:03:18.540> time<00:03:18.870> not<00:03:19.110> flexing<00:03:19.590> the<00:03:19.650> knee<00:03:19.770> up

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.040 
bent at all time not flexing the knee up

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.460 
bent at all time not flexing the knee up
and<00:03:20.220> down<00:03:20.370> as<00:03:20.880> you<00:03:21.090> push<00:03:21.330> up<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.570> lower<00:03:21.990> down

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
and down as you push up and lower down

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.110 
and down as you push up and lower down
and<00:03:22.860> get<00:03:23.010> that<00:03:23.130> full<00:03:23.400> range<00:03:23.520> of<00:03:23.700> motion<00:03:23.760> with

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
and get that full range of motion with

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.660 
and get that full range of motion with
the<00:03:24.390> heel<00:03:24.570> again<00:03:24.870> so<00:03:25.050> you're<00:03:25.200> really

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:25.670 
the heel again so you're really

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.340 
the heel again so you're really
shortening<00:03:26.670> and<00:03:26.790> lengthening<00:03:27.110> the<00:03:28.110> calf

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:28.350 
shortening and lengthening the calf

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:31.130 
shortening and lengthening the calf
muscle<00:03:28.830> with<00:03:29.190> every<00:03:29.640> rep<00:03:29.850> and<00:03:30.540> again<00:03:30.840> going

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
muscle with every rep and again going

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.310 
muscle with every rep and again going
from<00:03:31.380> volume<00:03:31.790> 1520<00:03:32.790> repetitions<00:03:33.170> upwards<00:03:34.170> of

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:34.320 
from volume 1520 repetitions upwards of

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.740 
from volume 1520 repetitions upwards of
30<00:03:34.590> so<00:03:34.980> make<00:03:35.550> sure<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.820> wait<00:03:36.090> to<00:03:36.240> reflect<00:03:36.600> that

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
30 so make sure you wait to reflect that

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.990 
30 so make sure you wait to reflect that
so<00:03:37.290> that<00:03:37.470> you<00:03:37.620> can<00:03:37.770> enable<00:03:38.010> those<00:03:38.310> high<00:03:38.640> reps

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:39.000 
so that you can enable those high reps

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.240 
so that you can enable those high reps

we're<00:03:43.980> really<00:03:44.010> going<00:03:44.370> to<00:03:44.430> target<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:45.000> front

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:45.330 
we're really going to target the front

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.930 
we're really going to target the front
part<00:03:45.600> of<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.800> not<00:03:47.040> exactly<00:03:47.550> your<00:03:47.700> calf

part of the not exactly your calf

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.790 
part of the not exactly your calf
muscle<00:03:48.330> but<00:03:48.450> it<00:03:48.510> helps<00:03:48.780> with<00:03:49.230> that<00:03:49.350> overall

final exercises to do for crafts and

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:03.530 
final exercises to do for crafts and
I've<00:04:01.680> really<00:04:02.040> found<00:04:02.340> it's<00:04:02.670> helped<00:04:02.910> to<00:04:03.120> add

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
I've really found it's helped to add

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.690 
I've really found it's helped to add
some<00:04:03.780> thickness<00:04:04.050> and<00:04:04.410> depth<00:04:04.680> into<00:04:05.250> this<00:04:05.370> front

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
some thickness and depth into this front

some thickness and depth into this front
part<00:04:05.910> of<00:04:06.240> the<00:04:06.840> ship<00:04:07.020> so<00:04:07.620> how<00:04:07.860> it<00:04:07.980> works<00:04:08.010> is<00:04:08.490> I've

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
part of the ship so how it works is I've

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:12.140 
part of the ship so how it works is I've
got<00:04:09.680> basically<00:04:10.680> an<00:04:10.920> ankle<00:04:11.310> attachment<00:04:11.940> here

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:12.150 
got basically an ankle attachment here

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:14.030 
got basically an ankle attachment here
on<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.600> lowest<00:04:12.900> setting<00:04:13.050> of<00:04:13.380> the<00:04:13.500> cable<00:04:13.830> bring

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
on the lowest setting of the cable bring

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:18.310 
on the lowest setting of the cable bring
and<00:04:14.880> place<00:04:15.450> it<00:04:15.690> down<00:04:15.810> onto<00:04:16.110> this<00:04:16.320> map<00:04:16.880> position

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:18.320 
and place it down onto this map position

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.250 
and place it down onto this map position
strap<00:04:19.320> around<00:04:19.560> the<00:04:20.330> ball<00:04:21.330> of<00:04:21.600> my<00:04:21.630> foot<00:04:22.049> right

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:22.260 
strap around the ball of my foot right

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.630 
strap around the ball of my foot right
there<00:04:22.320> and<00:04:23.240> then<00:04:24.240> sit<00:04:24.630> back<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.080> get<00:04:25.230> enough

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:25.640 
there and then sit back to get enough

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.640 
there and then sit back to get enough
distance<00:04:26.640> between<00:04:27.000> myself<00:04:27.390> and<00:04:27.780> lift<00:04:28.500> the

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:28.650 
distance between myself and lift the

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.680 
distance between myself and lift the
weight<00:04:28.800> up<00:04:28.830> a<00:04:29.130> bit<00:04:29.310> keeping<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.330> knees<00:04:30.450> right

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:30.690 
weight up a bit keeping the knees right

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.250 
weight up a bit keeping the knees right
event<00:04:31.050> simply<00:04:31.500> pull<00:04:31.800> my<00:04:31.950> towards<00:04:32.610> me<00:04:32.760> and

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:33.260 
event simply pull my towards me and

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.620 
event simply pull my towards me and
extend<00:04:34.260> so<00:04:34.560> it's<00:04:35.460> really<00:04:35.760> that<00:04:35.910> tibialis

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
extend so it's really that tibialis

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.260 
extend so it's really that tibialis
muscle<00:04:36.870> here<00:04:37.470> that's<00:04:38.160> now<00:04:38.340> contracting<00:04:39.060> and

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:39.270 
muscle here that's now contracting and

00:04:39.270 --> 00:05:07.480 
muscle here that's now contracting and
lengthening<00:04:40.170> on<00:04:41.010> every<00:04:41.340> rep
