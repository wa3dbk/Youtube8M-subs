or<00:01:39.329> just<00:01:39.479> give<00:01:39.600> you<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.750> better<00:01:39.869> shot<00:01:40.229> but<00:01:40.799> not

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
or just give you a better shot but not

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:44.330 
or just give you a better shot but not
significantly<00:01:41.450> enough<00:01:42.450> to<00:01:43.380> justify<00:01:43.740> using<00:01:44.100> it

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
significantly enough to justify using it

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.370 
significantly enough to justify using it
over<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:44.729> ak-74<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:45.689> I<00:01:45.869> think<00:01:46.140> that<00:01:46.229> the

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.380 
over the ak-74 you I think that the

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.399 
over the ak-74 you I think that the
ak-74<00:01:47.130> you<00:01:47.430> with<00:01:47.790> extended<00:01:48.390> mags<00:01:48.420> grip<00:01:49.170> or

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
ak-74 you with extended mags grip or

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.190 
ak-74 you with extended mags grip or
suppressor<00:01:49.920> are<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:51.000> three<00:01:51.240> best<00:01:51.420> things<00:01:51.720> or

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
suppressor are the three best things or

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.520 
suppressor are the three best things or
the<00:01:52.619> three<00:01:52.770> of<00:01:52.799> us<00:01:52.890> attachment<00:01:53.520> for<00:01:53.820> the<00:01:54.000> best

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
the three of us attachment for the best

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.980 
the three of us attachment for the best
what<00:01:55.530> is<00:01:55.649> my<00:01:55.829> opinion<00:01:56.310> so<00:01:56.729> far<00:01:57.000> the<00:01:57.329> best<00:01:57.659> SMG

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
what is my opinion so far the best SMG

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.230 
what is my opinion so far the best SMG
in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> game<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:58.680> many<00:01:58.860> I<00:01:58.950> think<00:01:59.280> one<00:01:59.820> that<00:02:00.210> I

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
in the game so many I think one that I

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.730 
in the game so many I think one that I
don't<00:02:00.479> have<00:02:00.689> actually<00:02:01.170> going<00:02:01.290> to<00:02:01.380> check<00:02:01.530> right

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.610 
answer a couple
really<00:02:13.640> general<00:02:14.360> questions<00:02:14.840> is<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.470> my

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620 
really general questions is it my

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.059 
really general questions is it my
favorite<00:02:16.310> arm<00:02:16.510> call<00:02:17.510> duty<00:02:17.750> to<00:02:17.959> date<00:02:18.319> like<00:02:18.800> as

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:19.069 
favorite arm call duty to date like as

00:02:19.069 --> 00:02:22.119 
favorite arm call duty to date like as
far<00:02:19.250> as<00:02:19.370> fun<00:02:19.730> no<00:02:20.420> but<00:02:20.810> as<00:02:20.900> far<00:02:21.050> as<00:02:21.110> balance<00:02:21.620> yes

00:02:22.119 --> 00:02:22.129 
far as fun no but as far as balance yes

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:24.190 
far as fun no but as far as balance yes
I<00:02:22.400> feel<00:02:22.640> that<00:02:22.760> this<00:02:22.910> game<00:02:23.150> has<00:02:23.330> a<00:02:23.450> much<00:02:23.930> more

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:24.200 
I feel that this game has a much more

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.570 
I feel that this game has a much more
balanced<00:02:24.620> than<00:02:24.680> a<00:02:24.800> lot<00:02:25.010> of<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> other<00:02:25.370> games

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
balanced than a lot of the other games

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.180 
balanced than a lot of the other games
that<00:02:25.790> I<00:02:25.910> played<00:02:26.209> including<00:02:26.540> calls<00:02:27.470> before<00:02:27.739> and

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
that I played including calls before and

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.190 
that I played including calls before and
then<00:02:28.280> is<00:02:28.430> really<00:02:28.849> saying<00:02:29.120> something<00:02:29.239> I<00:02:29.750> think

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
then is really saying something I think

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.960 
then is really saying something I think
that<00:02:30.290> in<00:02:30.379> called<00:02:30.590> it<00:02:30.739> before<00:02:31.069> basically<00:02:31.790> you

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
that in called it before basically you

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.270 
that in called it before basically you
could<00:02:32.090> kill<00:02:32.299> people<00:02:32.599> pretty<00:02:32.810> fast<00:02:33.140> which<00:02:34.010> made

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280 
could kill people pretty fast which made

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.250 
could kill people pretty fast which made
for<00:02:34.519> this<00:02:34.670> you<00:02:35.390> could<00:02:35.540> still<00:02:35.750> kill<00:02:35.959> people

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
for this you could still kill people

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:37.930 
for this you could still kill people
fairly<00:02:36.500> fast<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.099> called<00:02:37.280> it<00:02:37.400> before<00:02:37.670> even

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
fairly fast and called it before even

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.009 
fairly fast and called it before even
though<00:02:38.090> it's<00:02:38.239> nothing<00:02:38.510> compared<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:38.900> modern

00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:39.019 
though it's nothing compared to modern

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:41.729 
though it's nothing compared to modern
warfare<00:02:39.170> 2<00:02:39.590> which<00:02:40.310> even<00:02:41.030> just<00:02:41.330> that<00:02:41.450> little

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:41.739 
warfare 2 which even just that little

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:44.860 
warfare 2 which even just that little
difference<00:02:42.739> made<00:02:43.040> a<00:02:43.069> big<00:02:43.390> difference<00:02:44.390> i<00:02:44.750> guess

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:44.870 
difference made a big difference i guess

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:45.699 
difference made a big difference i guess
you<00:02:44.959> can<00:02:45.049> say<00:02:45.200> there's<00:02:45.440> that<00:02:45.590> little

00:02:45.699 --> 00:02:45.709 
you can say there's that little

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:47.350 
you can say there's that little
discrepancy<00:02:46.130> made<00:02:46.519> a<00:02:46.549> big<00:02:46.730> difference<00:02:46.940> in<00:02:47.269> the

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:47.360 
discrepancy made a big difference in the

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.110 
discrepancy made a big difference in the
gameplay<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.230> even<00:02:48.650> still<00:02:48.799> when<00:02:49.760> you<00:02:49.880> ran

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:50.120 
gameplay but even still when you ran

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:51.940 
gameplay but even still when you ran
around<00:02:50.209> a<00:02:50.360> corner<00:02:50.630> you<00:02:50.930> could<00:02:51.110> kill<00:02:51.380> two<00:02:51.440> guys

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
around a corner you could kill two guys

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.699 
around a corner you could kill two guys
if<00:02:52.849> you<00:02:53.030> were<00:02:53.180> able<00:02:53.329> to<00:02:53.510> outshoot<00:02:53.870> them<00:02:53.930> but<00:02:54.560> it

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
if you were able to outshoot them but it

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:55.930 
if you were able to outshoot them but it
doesn't<00:02:55.040> seem<00:02:55.160> like<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.400> can<00:02:55.610> do<00:02:55.760> that

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
doesn't seem like you can do that

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.610 
doesn't seem like you can do that
anymore<00:02:56.150> call<00:02:56.540> you<00:02:56.660> black<00:02:56.840> ops<00:02:57.079> it<00:02:57.230> seems<00:02:57.470> that

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
anymore call you black ops it seems that

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.860 
anymore call you black ops it seems that
if<00:02:57.739> you<00:02:57.829> run<00:02:57.980> into<00:02:58.010> two<00:02:58.400> people<00:02:58.849> your<00:02:59.329> skill<00:02:59.629> it

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
if you run into two people your skill it

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.180 
if you run into two people your skill it
usually<00:03:00.230> isn't<00:03:00.379> gonna<00:03:00.560> be<00:03:00.680> able<00:03:00.769> to<00:03:00.890> outmatch

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 
usually isn't gonna be able to outmatch

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.009 
usually isn't gonna be able to outmatch
them<00:03:01.250> which<00:03:01.879> is<00:03:01.910> frustrating<00:03:02.209> at<00:03:02.599> times<00:03:02.629> but

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:03.019 
them which is frustrating at times but

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:05.170 
them which is frustrating at times but
does<00:03:03.680> create<00:03:04.010> an<00:03:04.190> element<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.610> balance<00:03:04.760> where

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
does create an element of balance where

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.089 
does create an element of balance where
you<00:03:05.329> can't<00:03:05.599> just<00:03:05.780> turn<00:03:05.930> a<00:03:05.989> corner<00:03:06.230> and<00:03:06.500> spray

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
you can't just turn a corner and spray

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:09.339 
you can't just turn a corner and spray
down<00:03:07.250> two<00:03:07.519> guys<00:03:07.730> so<00:03:08.180> it's<00:03:08.750> up<00:03:08.989> to<00:03:09.019> you<00:03:09.200> guys

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
down two guys so it's up to you guys

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:13.000 
down two guys so it's up to you guys

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:20.569 
something like this um my prediction was

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:23.319 
something like this um my prediction was
that<00:03:20.630> I<00:03:20.930> wouldn't<00:03:21.260> be<00:03:21.319> able<00:03:21.410> to<00:03:21.680> hold<00:03:21.859> a<00:03:22.280> 5k<00:03:23.150> t<00:03:23.209> I

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:23.329 
that I wouldn't be able to hold a 5k t I

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:25.240 
that I wouldn't be able to hold a 5k t I
wouldn't<00:03:23.690> be<00:03:23.780> able<00:03:23.840> to<00:03:23.959> do<00:03:24.079> a<00:03:24.109> 5k<00:03:24.650> t<00:03:24.709> challenge

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:25.250 
wouldn't be able to do a 5k t challenge

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:28.000 
wouldn't be able to do a 5k t challenge
series<00:03:25.579> I<00:03:25.760> was<00:03:25.970> absolutely<00:03:26.660> right<00:03:26.840> but<00:03:27.680> ah

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:28.010 
series I was absolutely right but ah

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:30.699 
series I was absolutely right but ah
that's<00:03:28.730> so<00:03:29.389> far<00:03:29.780> because<00:03:30.290> there's<00:03:30.500> still

00:03:30.699 --> 00:03:30.709 
that's so far because there's still

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.920 
that's so far because there's still
something<00:03:31.010> to<00:03:31.280> come<00:03:31.519> I'll<00:03:32.239> explain<00:03:32.359> right<00:03:32.870> now

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
that is above average in fact that's

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:43.900

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:48.980 
so I've played with quite a few people

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:51.729 
so I've played with quite a few people
who<00:03:49.099> have<00:03:49.250> black<00:03:49.489> ops<00:03:49.700> and<00:03:49.970> it<00:03:50.120> seems<00:03:50.359> that<00:03:50.739> the

00:03:51.729 --> 00:03:51.739 
who have black ops and it seems that the

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:54.490

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:54.500 
three KD is well above the average for a

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.490 
three KD is well above the average for a
commentator<00:03:54.950> and<00:03:55.239> as<00:03:56.239> far<00:03:56.450> as<00:03:56.510> you<00:03:56.930> know<00:03:57.049> what

commentator and as far as you know what
it<00:03:57.590> will<00:03:57.769> become<00:03:58.220> later<00:03:58.549> on<00:03:58.819> when<00:03:59.209> you<00:03:59.480> know

00:03:59.589 --> 00:03:59.599 
it will become later on when you know

the<00:03:59.840> game<00:04:00.049> has<00:04:00.410> matured<00:04:00.680> a<00:04:00.950> little<00:04:01.040> bit<00:04:01.280> i

00:04:01.479 --> 00:04:01.489 
the game has matured a little bit i

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
think my kill death ratio is very

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.319 
think my kill death ratio is very
increased<00:04:03.590> to<00:04:03.799> about<00:04:03.889> 4<00:04:04.340> and<00:04:04.579> the<00:04:04.940> reason<00:04:05.209> why

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
increased to about 4 and the reason why

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:07.720 
increased to about 4 and the reason why
i<00:04:05.359> think<00:04:05.450> that<00:04:05.630> is<00:04:05.900> because<00:04:06.079> number<00:04:06.530> one<00:04:06.730> I'm

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:07.730
