00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:29.119
 today we are going to make carrot bread 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.429
 first we drain the carrot with a 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:33.739
 Chinese colander helped by spoon 

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:36.260
 If we do not have a strainer , we can do it 

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.449
 hand let's try to extract all the 

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.030
 liquid that we can keep the liquid 

00:00:38.449 --> 00:00:43.309
 and the carrot the liquid we mix 

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.089
 with water until you get 200 centimeters 

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:46.970
 cubic 

00:00:44.089 --> 00:00:49.140
 we add salt and mix now we throw 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.110
 the flour in a bowl 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:57.000
 yeast we undo well with the 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:01:00.629
 hands we add the sugar we mix the 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.260
 olive oil we mix again now 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.390
 the carrot we mix and we're going to 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.369
 press it well with the flour we are going to 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.350
 try to remove the remaining moisture to 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.670
 the carrot we add the liquid 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.320
 we mix together and we bring them to 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.320
 the table we knead 

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.970
 and if it's still a bit sticky 

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.040
 add a little flour 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.840
 we keep moving until we are not 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:32.310
 stick on the fingers 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.310
 in flour we table 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:38.840
 in we lined up the dough and started to 

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:41.479
 stretch with a stick we try not to 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.229
 break the plot of the mass that is not us 

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:44.229
 paste below 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.880
 once stretched we fold it 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.630
 and we go back to stretch we are going to repeat 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.310
 this operation 8 to 10 times once 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:03.880
 list 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:06.310
 We take them to a bowl 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.310
 we cover it with film 

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:11.680
 until it rises twice its size 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.450
 once ready we take the dough to the table 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.690
 we hit her against the table to 

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.730
 remove the air in this way in flour 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.280
 moss the table 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.380
 we finished taking the air with the 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:28.040
 fingers this way 

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.980
 we roll it up and form a bar 

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:35.329
 we split it in two by turning each hand in 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.120
 opposite sense we stretch each piece and 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:40.400
 we cut each one in four we form the 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:42.590
 scones first with the singing of the hand 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:44.030
 and then we spin it sinking a 

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:46.730
 little the palm of the hand 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.730
 we stretch each pretty one in the form of 

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:52.909
 chorizo ​​we join four strips for a 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.760
 end and we cross the outer strips 

00:02:52.909 --> 00:03:00.560
 in the center like this then 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.910
 we cross again in the center always 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.490
 the outer strips 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:09.120
 we repeat this operation until we finish 

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.120
 the braid 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:17.240
 we finish it by sealing the edges 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.900
 we pass the base of each braid in flour 

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:22.900
 and we put them on a baking sheet 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:24.860
 we cover for the leven 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:27.110
 we will improvise with what we have to 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.959
 hand if it is a high plastic plate 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:32.329
 better once elevated we take them to 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.110
 200- degree preheated oven 

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.110
 about 20 minutes 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:42.090
 Once ready, we remove them and 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.560
 we can paint with olive oil as 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 is 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.390
 or with water like this other 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:53.000
 we see how it differs from one another in 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:55.310
 the color and we will also notice it later in 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:59.739
 the taste with this we give for finished 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:59.739
 our braided carrot breads
