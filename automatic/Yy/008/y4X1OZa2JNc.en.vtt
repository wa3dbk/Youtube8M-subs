00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:17.939
 each curve and balanced

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.529
 so the same and the patients 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.470
 currently on the topographic maps they represented

 sauro personal plan is at the end of the line the starting point of a city of

 the scale by which at the end of this month 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.130
 between each line every year a hundred backs 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.670
 from space 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.370
 and this space 2

 beauregard 10 

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.460
 a distance that will switch 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.620
 this distance the deformation zone per device but what about the end 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:03.670
 koor industries savior lessard 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:04.930
 today at her place 

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:08.380
 my point and 1 0 up to 4 joysticks 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.380
 and then I like to go 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:17.360
 and it was happening on the hillock and bringing according to the duck a dimension 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.250
 up to 4 meters bridge 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.250
 it will take over the prices of metals 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.840
 that's the reinsurer part so what does it mean know that here but two 

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.850
 points are still fairly spaced 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:33.560
 for my part I have rather sweet 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.329
 he signed to get closer emma the irm appeared rather happy here it is 

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:39.530
 the sweetest part 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.530
 but for the most spaced senses 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:44.410
 at the same time 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.660

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520
 so everyone here 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:06.219
 tight cyril would be financial for me dominique mattei europe 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.989
 ultimately the new

 we can use modern tools com 

00:02:13.279 --> 00:02:17.969
 level to lasalle you can can also use more tools 

00:02:19.419 --> 00:02:21.680
 houses like the phone

 with Portugal 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:28.229
 that allows me to really find places that are at a level where it is 

00:02:28.229 --> 00:02:31.749
 located the most xavier beauvois group which is very interesting if the 

00:02:31.749 --> 00:02:35.569
 water level which is easy enough to set up useless rather than 

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.229
 it is 

00:02:37.229 --> 00:02:40.669
 at the end of March, school lessons for you 

00:02:40.669 --> 00:02:44.739
 it's a question of making other terms 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:49.849
 from whom it is possible to lay hands and we too to be able to optimize its

 near very interesting for the recovery of crude filtrations 

00:02:59.449 --> 00:03:02.369
 I chose my starting point 

00:03:02.369 --> 00:03:05.299
 I clarified since it's a year 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:08.219
 all points atp at the same level 

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:12.340
 but other line I have plenty of things the sultan I climbed the few meters 

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:14.789
 at the table I made my line 

00:03:14.789 --> 00:03:17.849
 I missed some benefits 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.580
 he supported the efforts provided by year that are 

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.909
 illustrated and therefore parents more painful 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:24.669
 being more intense 

00:03:24.669 --> 00:03:28.399
 but I decided to go and he went suitcases and losses

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.259
 without complexes 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.899
 the beautiful and if we focus the om because the water always circulates to 90 

00:03:36.899 --> 00:03:39.389
 degrees to levels 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:43.359
 catherine thrush level it means that we are focused and do not leave a 

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:44.469
 view 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:47.469
 and because we obviously do not stop the latch 

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.809
 April outside 

00:03:49.809 --> 00:03:53.559
 it gives me very interesting information to trap increases 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:58.409
 we note and then especially this monopoly so many points kombouarÃ© this menu for 

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:00.529
 keep this at big events since
