00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.000
Ok... here is the deal guys...

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the new iGlide, a miniature stabilizer
 for little cameras like the GoPro.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
I told Mitch about it, he was all excited...
he wants to do an unboxing video.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
But as you can see... I have it all put together.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
That's him over there... so let's see what happens!

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Mitch - No Way!
Jerry - Yeah!

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Mitch - It's little!

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000
Mitch - I thought we were gonna open the box!

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Jerry - You wanted to open the box?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I've got the box... I got the box.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Do you want me to go get it?

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mitch - It's already out!

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Jerry - I'll get the box.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Wait!

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Just wait...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Now what he DOESN'T know...

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
... is that THIS is NOT an empty box!

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Mitch - What?

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Jerry - Take the box!

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.500
Jerry - take it!

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
Gimmie the GoPro and take the box!

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
Yeah, yeah... just look in the box!

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.000
Mitch - Two? Oh!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
Mitch - What's that for?

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.500
Jerry - For you!

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.000
Mitch - Why?

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.500
Jerry - You have been giving me all these tips man!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.500
Jerry - Yeah!

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Mitch - He asked, "What do you think about it?

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
Mitch - I said, "My favorite is blue."         Oh wow!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
