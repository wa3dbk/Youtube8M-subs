00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:43.340 
I think the fact that Edgar Wright was
on<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> movie<00:00:42.480> until<00:00:42.600> so<00:00:42.870> close<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> when<00:00:43.320> I

on the movie until so close to when I

started shooting kind of gave everybody

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:46.610 
started shooting kind of gave everybody
the<00:00:45.539> heebie-jeebies<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.200> they<00:00:46.289> kicked<00:00:46.500> him

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
the heebie-jeebies when they kicked him

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.740 
the heebie-jeebies when they kicked him
out<00:00:46.649> the<00:00:46.829> door<00:00:46.860> oh<00:00:47.129> sure<00:00:47.550> um<00:00:47.820> but<00:00:48.270> that<00:00:48.570> being

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
out the door oh sure um but that being

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.260 
out the door oh sure um but that being
said<00:00:48.840> Marvel<00:00:49.590> has<00:00:49.890> made<00:00:50.280> very<00:00:50.640> few<00:00:50.730> missteps

and I think they know what important it

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.650 
and I think they know what important it
is<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> keep<00:00:53.520> these<00:00:53.730> movies<00:00:54.030> alive<00:00:54.329> they

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239

00:00:57.239 --> 00:00:59.180 
certainly earned the benefit of the
doubt<00:00:57.270> at<00:00:57.660> this<00:00:57.690> point<00:00:58.230> the<00:00:58.559> number<00:00:58.800> one<00:00:58.980> thing

see<00:04:40.210> ant-man<00:04:41.110> fitting<00:04:41.950> into<00:04:42.070> the<00:04:42.250> big<00:04:42.460> picture

see ant-man fitting into the big picture
well<00:04:43.479> I<00:04:43.540> think<00:04:43.600> that<00:04:43.990> the<00:04:44.080> movie<00:04:44.380> will<00:04:44.560> fit

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:44.770 
well I think that the movie will fit

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.200 
well I think that the movie will fit
into<00:04:44.919> the<00:04:45.070> Marvel<00:04:45.340> Universe<00:04:45.370> just<00:04:45.970> because

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
into the Marvel Universe just because

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.670 
into the Marvel Universe just because
Hank<00:04:46.479> Pym<00:04:46.690> is<00:04:46.720> obviously<00:04:47.169> a<00:04:47.200> guy<00:04:47.350> that<00:04:47.500> seems

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:47.680 
Hank Pym is obviously a guy that seems

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.440 
Hank Pym is obviously a guy that seems
like<00:04:47.800> he's<00:04:47.919> been<00:04:48.130> ant-man<00:04:48.430> before<00:04:48.970> he's<00:04:49.300> had

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:49.450 
like he's been ant-man before he's had

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:50.940 
like he's been ant-man before he's had
this<00:04:49.570> technology<00:04:50.110> for<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.320> while<00:04:50.500> so<00:04:50.770> they're

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:50.950 
this technology for a while so they're

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:52.680 
this technology for a while so they're
gonna<00:04:51.070> probably<00:04:51.340> put<00:04:51.640> in<00:04:51.940> some<00:04:52.180> things<00:04:52.510> like

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
gonna probably put in some things like

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:54.810 
gonna probably put in some things like
where<00:04:53.050> he's<00:04:53.290> been<00:04:53.530> superheroing<00:04:54.370> now<00:04:54.520> for<00:04:54.760> the

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:54.820 
where he's been superheroing now for the

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.150 
where he's been superheroing now for the
last<00:04:55.000> you<00:04:55.300> know<00:04:55.330> 3040<00:04:56.020> years<00:04:56.290> in<00:04:56.530> the<00:04:56.740> comics

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:57.160 
last you know 3040 years in the comics

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.040 
last you know 3040 years in the comics
Hawkeye<00:04:57.550> has<00:04:57.790> actually<00:04:58.180> very<00:04:58.360> similar<00:04:58.600> origin

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050 
Hawkeye has actually very similar origin

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:00.420

where Hawkeye was a criminal who got
reformed<00:05:01.000> so<00:05:01.419> I<00:05:01.450> think<00:05:01.690> having<00:05:02.080> this

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:02.290 
reformed so I think having this

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:05.190 
reformed so I think having this
character<00:05:02.710> who<00:05:02.919> has<00:05:03.100> you<00:05:03.700> know<00:05:03.840> has<00:05:04.840> the<00:05:05.020> rest

know<00:05:56.899> if<00:05:56.959> you<00:05:57.019> know<00:05:57.110> this<00:05:57.259> the<00:05:57.709> galaxy<00:05:58.189> mm-hmm

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
know if you know this the galaxy mm-hmm

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.789 
know if you know this the galaxy mm-hmm
so<00:05:58.969> you<00:05:59.479> know<00:05:59.599> like<00:05:59.749> you<00:05:59.869> get<00:06:00.139> this<00:06:00.349> sense<00:06:00.619> of

00:06:00.789 --> 00:06:00.799 
so you know like you get this sense of

00:06:00.799 --> 00:06:02.019 
so you know like you get this sense of
scope<00:06:01.129> with<00:06:01.369> that<00:06:01.549> what<00:06:01.759> you<00:06:01.849> don't

00:06:02.019 --> 00:06:02.029 
scope with that what you don't

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.489

necessarily<00:06:02.179> have<00:06:02.509> an<00:06:02.749> ant-man<00:06:02.989> so<00:06:03.199> I<00:06:03.259> think

00:06:03.489 --> 00:06:03.499 
necessarily have an ant-man so I think

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:05.199 
necessarily have an ant-man so I think
they're<00:06:03.649> probably<00:06:03.860> fighting<00:06:04.249> a<00:06:04.429> bit<00:06:04.639> amongst

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:05.209 
they're probably fighting a bit amongst

00:06:05.209 --> 00:06:07.059 
they're probably fighting a bit amongst
the<00:06:05.299> tone<00:06:05.509> like<00:06:06.079> how<00:06:06.229> do<00:06:06.289> we<00:06:06.379> present<00:06:06.829> it<00:06:06.949> so

00:06:07.059 --> 00:06:07.069 
the tone like how do we present it so

00:06:07.069 --> 00:06:08.229 
the tone like how do we present it so
that<00:06:07.189> people<00:06:07.429> feel<00:06:07.610> like<00:06:07.789> this<00:06:07.939> movie<00:06:08.179> is

if that happens what are the chances

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:27.279 
if that happens what are the chances
that<00:06:25.339> ant-man<00:06:25.789> just<00:06:26.209> slinks<00:06:26.719> away<00:06:26.869> to<00:06:27.050> his

like<00:06:31.039> I<00:06:31.129> think<00:06:31.219> they'll<00:06:31.550> bench<00:06:31.819> ant-man<00:06:32.179> for<00:06:32.539> a

00:06:32.559 --> 00:06:32.569 
like I think they'll bench ant-man for a

00:06:32.569 --> 00:06:33.759 
like I think they'll bench ant-man for a
little<00:06:32.809> bit<00:06:32.959> like<00:06:33.110> maybe<00:06:33.289> there'll<00:06:33.529> be<00:06:33.589> some

00:06:33.759 --> 00:06:33.769 
little bit like maybe there'll be some

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:35.409 
little bit like maybe there'll be some
sort<00:06:33.889> of<00:06:33.949> a<00:06:34.039> nod<00:06:34.219> and<00:06:34.429> infinity<00:06:34.909> war<00:06:35.119> it's<00:06:35.299> like

00:06:35.409 --> 00:06:35.419 
sort of a nod and infinity war it's like

00:06:35.419 --> 00:06:37.419 
sort of a nod and infinity war it's like
he's<00:06:35.539> homeless<00:06:36.019> or<00:06:36.409> something<00:06:36.439> with<00:06:36.889> a<00:06:36.919> cup<00:06:37.189> or

00:06:37.419 --> 00:06:37.429 
he's homeless or something with a cup or

00:06:37.429 --> 00:06:40.179 
he's homeless or something with a cup or
some<00:06:37.610> but<00:06:37.879> he'll<00:06:38.779> be<00:06:38.989> an<00:06:39.169> ant-man<00:06:39.469> like<00:06:40.009> in

00:06:40.179 --> 00:06:40.189 
some but he'll be an ant-man like in

00:06:40.189 --> 00:06:43.389 
some but he'll be an ant-man like in
2025<00:06:40.969> we'll<00:06:41.749> get<00:06:41.869> a<00:06:41.899> revamped<00:06:42.439> ant-man<00:06:42.889> it
