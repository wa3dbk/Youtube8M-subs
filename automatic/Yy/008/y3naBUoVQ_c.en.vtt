00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
feel good when you ride it you're not

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:29.810 
feel good when you ride it you're not
going<00:02:28.980> to<00:02:29.070> write<00:02:29.250> it<00:02:29.459> when<00:02:29.579> you're<00:02:29.700> just

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
going to write it when you're just

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.420 
going to write it when you're just
wasting<00:02:30.209> the<00:02:30.299> money<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:31.070> it<00:02:32.070> should<00:02:32.250> always

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
wasting the money but it should always

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.819 
wasting the money but it should always
be<00:02:32.610> based<00:02:32.910> upon<00:02:33.060> the<00:02:33.329> fit<00:02:33.570> and<00:02:34.110> how<00:02:34.230> an<00:02:34.380> overall

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
be based upon the fit and how an overall

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.850 
be based upon the fit and how an overall
feels<00:02:35.130> if<00:02:35.400> it<00:02:35.519> feels<00:02:35.700> twitchy<00:02:36.540> in<00:02:36.750> a<00:02:36.810> turn<00:02:37.049> then

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
feels if it feels twitchy in a turn then

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.319 
feels if it feels twitchy in a turn then
you're<00:02:37.950> not<00:02:38.040> going<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.280> enjoy<00:02:38.370> riding<00:02:38.730> if<00:02:39.120> it

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
you're not going to enjoy riding if it

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.150 
you're not going to enjoy riding if it
feel<00:02:39.600> sluggish<00:02:40.019> then<00:02:40.739> you're<00:02:40.829> not<00:02:40.920> going<00:02:41.100> to

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
feel sluggish then you're not going to

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.770 
feel sluggish then you're not going to
enjoy<00:02:41.280> riding<00:02:41.640> and<00:02:41.910> so<00:02:42.060> it<00:02:42.209> should<00:02:42.600> be

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
enjoy riding and so it should be

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.600 
enjoy riding and so it should be
something<00:02:43.170> that<00:02:43.200> inspires<00:02:43.829> you<00:02:44.070> to<00:02:44.100> want<00:02:44.400> to

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:45.610 
something that inspires you to want to

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:47.710 
something that inspires you to want to
the<00:02:46.610> reason<00:02:46.880> we<00:02:47.000> did<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.210> construction<00:02:47.630> that

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
the reason we did the construction that

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.000 
the reason we did the construction that
we<00:02:47.840> do<00:02:47.960> is<00:02:48.110> because<00:02:48.380> it<00:02:48.500> accomplishes<00:02:48.920> a

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
we do is because it accomplishes a

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.040 
we do is because it accomplishes a
couple<00:02:49.280> different<00:02:49.550> things<00:02:49.580> and<00:02:50.240> does<00:02:50.780> it<00:02:50.900> in<00:02:51.020> a

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:51.050 
couple different things and does it in a

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:52.750 
couple different things and does it in a
you<00:02:51.230> know<00:02:51.290> in<00:02:51.380> a<00:02:51.560> way<00:02:51.680> that<00:02:51.860> eats<00:02:52.070> the<00:02:52.190> cost

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
you know in a way that eats the cost

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:54.910 
you know in a way that eats the cost
down<00:02:53.060> so<00:02:53.360> you<00:02:53.480> have<00:02:53.510> an<00:02:54.020> affordable<00:02:54.530> race<00:02:54.710> by

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
down so you have an affordable race by

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.220 
down so you have an affordable race by
the<00:02:55.340> front<00:02:56.120> end<00:02:56.300> of<00:02:56.420> the<00:02:56.480> frame<00:02:56.720> is<00:02:56.870> done<00:02:57.080> in

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:57.230 
the front end of the frame is done in

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:00.040 
the front end of the frame is done in
monocoque<00:02:57.710> so<00:02:58.070> it's<00:02:58.250> a<00:02:58.340> one-piece<00:02:58.850> mold<00:02:59.420> for

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
monocoque so it's a one-piece mold for

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.110 
monocoque so it's a one-piece mold for
this<00:03:00.470> front<00:03:00.740> section<00:03:01.010> and<00:03:01.430> that<00:03:01.580> gives<00:03:01.910> you<00:03:02.060> a

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
this front section and that gives you a

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.360 
this front section and that gives you a
structure<00:03:02.450> that<00:03:02.600> is<00:03:03.170> more<00:03:03.470> rigid<00:03:03.860> and<00:03:03.980> is<00:03:04.190> more

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:04.370 
structure that is more rigid and is more

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:07.630 
structure that is more rigid and is more
like<00:03:04.610> ways<00:03:04.850> the<00:03:05.780> the<00:03:06.140> plus<00:03:06.410> side<00:03:06.710> to<00:03:07.100> monocoque

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:07.640 
like ways the the plus side to monocoque

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.160 
like ways the the plus side to monocoque
construction<00:03:07.670> is<00:03:08.450> that<00:03:08.480> you<00:03:08.780> can<00:03:08.960> come<00:03:09.140> up

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
construction is that you can come up

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:11.590 
construction is that you can come up
with<00:03:09.290> really<00:03:10.040> cool<00:03:10.220> shapes<00:03:10.640> as<00:03:10.970> well<00:03:11.030> as

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
with really cool shapes as well as

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.590 
with really cool shapes as well as
design<00:03:12.170> features<00:03:12.620> in<00:03:12.830> for<00:03:13.550> rigidity<00:03:14.150> or<00:03:14.270> flex

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
design features in for rigidity or flex

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.080 
design features in for rigidity or flex
but<00:03:15.350> in<00:03:15.590> the<00:03:15.710> downside<00:03:16.280> the<00:03:16.610> monocoque

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
but in the downside the monocoque

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.400 
but in the downside the monocoque
construction<00:03:17.120> is<00:03:17.720> that<00:03:17.900> you<00:03:18.050> can't<00:03:18.260> really

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
construction is that you can't really

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.320 
construction is that you can't really
control<00:03:18.620> that<00:03:19.220> well<00:03:19.459> what<00:03:19.850> goes<00:03:20.030> on<00:03:20.120> inside

00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:20.330 
control that well what goes on inside

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.690 
control that well what goes on inside
the<00:03:20.660> mold<00:03:20.900> as<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.740> piece<00:03:21.920> gets<00:03:22.220> bigger<00:03:22.490> so

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:22.700 
the mold as the piece gets bigger so

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.460 
the mold as the piece gets bigger so
when<00:03:22.880> you<00:03:22.970> do<00:03:23.090> a<00:03:23.120> full<00:03:23.480> frame<00:03:23.780> in<00:03:24.020> monocoque

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
when you do a full frame in monocoque

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:25.960 
when you do a full frame in monocoque
yeah<00:03:24.830> you<00:03:24.890> can<00:03:25.100> make<00:03:25.190> it<00:03:25.280> super<00:03:25.580> lightweight

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
yeah you can make it super lightweight

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:28.420 
yeah you can make it super lightweight
and<00:03:26.150> very<00:03:26.360> rigid<00:03:26.600> but<00:03:27.320> you<00:03:27.440> have<00:03:27.620> places<00:03:28.250> in

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:28.430 
and very rigid but you have places in

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.770 
and very rigid but you have places in
the<00:03:28.610> frame<00:03:28.820> where<00:03:29.090> you<00:03:29.120> don't<00:03:29.360> know<00:03:29.480> where<00:03:29.630> the

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:29.780 
the frame where you don't know where the

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:36.790 
the frame where you don't know where the
resin<00:03:30.080> or<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.290> carpet<00:03:30.620> is<00:03:30.740> going<00:03:35.200> to<00:03:36.200> be

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:36.800 
resin or the carpet is going to be

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.760 
resin or the carpet is going to be
joking<00:03:37.010> edges<00:03:37.720> down<00:03:38.720> there<00:03:38.990> so<00:03:39.170> excited<00:03:39.650> I've

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:39.770 
joking edges down there so excited I've

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.400 
joking edges down there so excited I've

and<00:04:16.120> then<00:04:17.079> then<00:04:17.470> we<00:04:17.560> take<00:04:17.739> that<00:04:17.799> that<00:04:18.250> rigid

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
and then then we take that that rigid

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.949 
and then then we take that that rigid
lightweight<00:04:18.970> structure<00:04:19.359> in<00:04:19.450> the<00:04:19.510> front<00:04:19.750> and

00:04:19.949 --> 00:04:19.959 
lightweight structure in the front and

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:22.560 
lightweight structure in the front and
we<00:04:20.109> bond<00:04:20.410> it<00:04:20.650> to<00:04:21.220> the<00:04:21.340> rest<00:04:21.790> of<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.000> frame<00:04:22.210> so

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:22.570 
we bond it to the rest of the frame so

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:25.080 
we bond it to the rest of the frame so
this<00:04:22.900> is<00:04:23.080> one<00:04:23.260> piece<00:04:23.500> this<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:24.370> one<00:04:24.550> piece<00:04:24.820> and

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:25.090 
this is one piece this is one piece and

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.150 
this is one piece this is one piece and
this<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.480> one<00:04:25.690> piece<00:04:25.930> that<00:04:26.260> are<00:04:26.710> then<00:04:26.860> bonded

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
this is one piece that are then bonded

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.950 
this is one piece that are then bonded
together<00:04:27.280> through<00:04:27.670> these<00:04:27.790> lugs<00:04:28.060> and<00:04:28.660> what<00:04:28.840> you

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
together through these lugs and what you

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.100 
together through these lugs and what you
get<00:04:29.320> from<00:04:29.530> that<00:04:29.620> is<00:04:30.160> for<00:04:31.150> example<00:04:31.270> the<00:04:31.900> frame

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
get from that is for example the frame

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.260 
get from that is for example the frame
that<00:04:32.290> I<00:04:32.380> ride<00:04:32.590> the<00:04:32.770> 61<00:04:33.190> centimeter<00:04:33.640> frame<00:04:33.910> and

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:34.270 
that I ride the 61 centimeter frame and

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.260

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070 
frame that I ride needs to be

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:40.650 
frame that I ride needs to be
significantly<00:04:39.820> stiffer<00:04:40.090> than<00:04:40.360> the<00:04:40.420> frame
