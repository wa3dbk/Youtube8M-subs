my<00:01:49.270> disaster<00:01:49.810> office<00:01:50.640> we<00:01:52.050> are<00:01:53.050> in<00:01:53.140> the<00:01:53.229> process

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:53.440 
my disaster office we are in the process

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.999 
my disaster office we are in the process
of<00:01:53.770> reorganizing<00:01:54.729> and<00:01:55.360> moving<00:01:55.690> things<00:01:56.009> but

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
of reorganizing and moving things but

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:59.520 
of reorganizing and moving things but
the<00:01:57.130> case<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:57.729> a<00:01:58.360> really<00:01:58.750> neat<00:01:58.930> effect<00:01:59.050> itself

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
the case is a really neat effect itself

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:01.859 
the case is a really neat effect itself
so<00:01:59.619> it's<00:01:59.740> kind<00:01:59.860> of<00:01:59.890> like<00:02:00.009> a<00:02:00.070> two-in-one<00:02:00.869> so

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:01.869
