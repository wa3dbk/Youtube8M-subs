00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:15.420
 fuck I'm ultra len and I'm here 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.760
 finally after a long time 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.310
 unmissable unforgettable battle 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.849
 within this field of the great 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.930
 kvm network the best Italian player 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:27.840
 of modern warfare 2 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:31.050
 then let's start from an assumption when 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.110
 I tended to comment on the video of 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.360
 rich with a certain daily cadence 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.250
 I got excited every time I didn't think of myself 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.230
 worthy of doing such a thing 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:42.650
 until then I decided that in short 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.660
 there could be a mission to accomplish 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.190
 demonstrate to the people to demonstrate to the 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.680
 entire people 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.500
 such magnificence of content therefore I have 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.400
 decided to comment on at least five o 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.100
 six 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.839
 of course let's say I risked it 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.239
 to die for the great radioactivity that 

00:00:57.839 --> 00:01:01.680
 they emanate this nuclear power of video 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.089
 that many because it is the best 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 Italian modern warfare player 2 

00:01:03.089 --> 00:01:06.810
 which devastates all of us the fauna 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.030
 the flora breaks everything up when it fires a bat 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.830
 well the bacteria in the air and I had tried 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.650
 also to make commentary in the 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:18.000
 moment in which he made the example 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:19.500
 top10 made crazy moments I did 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.859
 a quick commentary because you don't 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.460
 could express such word with verbal 

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:28.229
 ecstasy of content explosions 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.549
 all together you couldn't do one 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:32.820
 something like that 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.719
 I also had to decant the deeds into 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:40.159
 verba in lyrical verses reward the divine 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:42.689
 comedy to express a lyricism a 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:44.789
 elegiac power like that of rich 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:46.590
 ktm but let's see that this time 

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:48.270
 video as you see has already taken a 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.740
 predator I still haven't started either 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.340
 to comment on the game and also does one 

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.719
 Double 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.149
 I will frankly have never seen 

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.429
 make a single kill with a 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:57.230
 predicted I don't know how for what race of 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.330
 mathematical equation 

00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:01.300
 that such a thing is possible but 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:05.030
 I think it's all planned then 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.460
 here is rich ktm let's start by saying one 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.500
 what when you see a video say that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.000
 ktm 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.340
 in addition to the fact that you risk that he fell 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.610
 adobe flash player because it fails to 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.800
 manage such a power stream but 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.210
 you must also disable the antivirus 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.430
 because you really risk that 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.880
 identify a thing as a threat 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.680
 gender 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.990
 now I don't know if you've noticed it but it's there 

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.850
 written minute ammunition running out 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:32.360
 what does it mean that ammunition 

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:34.010
 since they are in the barrel of rickli ktm 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:36.710
 they are so under stress that they are 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:39.350
 exhausted mentally and don't shoot one 

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:41.210
 bullshit parma I do then see 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:43.310
 who is shooting rich on the horizon 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.500
 ktm will never use snipers because 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.210
 he is the shitty fucking weapon that 

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:49.460
 there's a fucking laser sight that kills 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.230
 all of them from 400 meters have it 

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.140
 used for the assassination of Kennedy 

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.290
 fuck with cola what you also see that 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.420
 there is a ragù a rocket launcher as a weapon 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:00.980
 secondary precisely because it cannot be done 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:02.990
 certainly lower to use the slopes 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.490
 shit lines must break your ass to 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:06.290
 all of them making him jump for it 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:08.600
 air and as you see here in some ammunition 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.430
 exhausted, however, here by magic it appears 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:11.900
 I can't get a sniper rifle 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.150
 make me understand how they can happen 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.310
 certain things he had a weapon with 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:18.350
 ammunition exhausted and here comes a 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.120
 sniper rifle with thermal sight 

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.739
 precisely because his weapon evolved 

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.660
 from has reached a higher level of 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:25.310
 power than that of the real sniper e 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.290
 even if before it had the same 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:29.330
 function because he certainly does not come 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.990
 in front of killing them there are certainly some 

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:33.900
 moments when taking spaf 12 

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:36.130
 debuts a broomstick in the ass though 

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.050
 it can also happen no 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:40.060
 so let's say for the commentary in 

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:42.760
 this game I felt a little non 

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:46.740
 worthy because it is here you see a moment 

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:48.910
 strange I say sometimes when he dies 

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.430
 I understand that it is part of providence 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.470
 of the divine message that of what ktm 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:55.900
 he wants to leave us he certainly doesn't die 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:58.360
 by chance but they are randomness that 

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.970
 they are part of the design that he is 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.910
 trying to build within the 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.500
 his gameplay what the fuck I'm saying 

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:06.820
 then let's try to do some 

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.180
 commentary because it is approaching the 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:12.340
 moment here is rich get up kids 3 21 pm 

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 and ktm loads with the c 130 that shoots 

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:14.830
 from the clouds you can't see a 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:16.840
 fuck for that fucking channel is one 

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.860
 from 51 from 25 one from 10 13 of the qandil 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.970
 keep shooting and here is see i 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:20.739
 enemies left to right and para 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.270
 the daughter continues in canada here 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.650
 they come and shoot enemies continuously 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:25.030
 because he doesn't know what the fuck he needs to go 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.400
 had taken the take had the ricotta 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:28.630
 avap will have taken the c130 has taken of 

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.980
 new is gone because who knows why 

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:31.450
 he left obviously he was afraid of 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:32.680
 he decided to go fuck 

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:34.300
 and here he starts shooting like a 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.440
 fucking shit sniper inside 

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.420
 of the barker that doesn't really serve to 

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:39.010
 nothing a bank a useless bunker stood 

00:04:37.420 --> 00:04:40.420
 using an Anglo-Saxon pronunciation 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.710
 to pronounce a German word that 

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.180
 however it was used in Italian e 

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.710
 so you don't really understand a shit 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.180
 and here is ricky ktm hiding behind 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.040
 fucking been but it's going like 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.870
 a beast is going like a madman is 

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.880
 going like a maniac is going like 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.380
 a savage predator cabbage that 

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.670
 it destroys everyone 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:56.050
 it also destroys the atoms 

00:04:54.670 --> 00:04:57.370
 I hope he is not in front of an atom 

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:59.050
 of plutonium because destroying it 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.130
 could cause nuclear detonation 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.270
 that would even destroy us 

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:02.890
 on the other side of the screen of 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.990
 youtube because nuclear detonations 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.520
 provoked by ricky ktm are so powerful 

00:05:04.990 --> 00:05:08.110
 who manage to penetrate even from 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:08.620
 part of bytes of kilobytes on the internet 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.000
 same 

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:11.290
 and here we turn to the left right 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.520
 shoot and behold, they will let him out 

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.200
 bit of blood but did not make a fucking 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.430
 cosentino to shoot from with the fucking of 

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:16.960
 muretto the mason who did that 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:18.130
 muretto will be swearing because he comes 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:19.720
 the video probably saw what it has 

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.890
 he and he had attacked the wall 

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.060
 the count throws a grenade I have not 

00:05:20.890 --> 00:05:23.200
 even understood because she managed the 

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:25.000
 mazzoni enemy who goes to the other side 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:26.350
 of the of the of the track and here is that 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.430
 explodes thing there has not realized that 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:29.620
 was that there was an enemy 

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.390
 indeed there was a blue friend who had put himself 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.740
 near him probably the one t cell 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:34.000
 efficient who does not want to kill 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.500
 because if you put yourself in front of cup stripes 

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.670
 tm means that you are really stupid 

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:37.840
 that you don't understand anything because if you put yourself 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.820
 close to him he can't even do it 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.020
 there are internet for a whole game 

00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:43.030
 indeed we could say that if you put yourself 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.980
 close to him and rich ktm you take it pure 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.390
 the joystick makes the most of it 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.160
 who shoots at another manages to get 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.570
 the missile predicted king it is understood that it is 

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.950
 time to hide behind a wall 

00:05:49.570 --> 00:05:52.330
 in order not to get hit though 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.560
 if he were hit he wouldn't die 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.420
 same and there is no fucking messina 

00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.860
 predicted sees a friend who saab ign snow 

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:58.600
 on the other hand a fatality is killed 

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.920
 has failed to kill anything but does 

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.270
 part of the design is absolutely not 

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:02.530
 a bad thing 

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.940
 and here the rifle reappears from 

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.930
 sniper I can't understand how 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:06.580
 such a thing has happened 

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.170
 probably ricky ktm has some 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.030
 conversion psychophysical functions 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:11.110
 of matter in other forms and here it is 

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:13.030
 is approaching from the other side of the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:14.950
 village and here you see it on the right a 

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.420
 left but also blue now not 

00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:18.610
 I see a case he will probably see it 

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:19.720
 because a life at a vision a view 

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.190
 even more powerful than we humans 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:21.760
 probably approaches that of the 

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:23.710
 felines 

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:25.060
 and here it continues to advance sees the 

00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.590
 enemies that are beautiful before him 

00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.820
 all friends are in front of him 

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.350
 how many in front of him but they don't care 

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:31.690
 nothing because it kills enemy friends 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:32.950
 ammazzatutti also kills the houses ed 

00:06:31.690 --> 00:06:34.480
 here comes a stealth bomber 

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:35.680
 who can throw bombs but not 

00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.150
 he doesn't give a damn about it because he 

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:38.920
 shoots right shoots left décolleté 

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.270
 he continues and here's his rifle pulls the gun 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.620
 there is one who shoots behind him says but 

00:06:40.270 --> 00:06:43.090
 what the hell are you doing makes me shoot 

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.860
 I don't know why nothing is happening 

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.570
 in this game a paranormal wind 

00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:48.400
 and here he continues shoots in and gods 

00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:50.830
 no he is not dead probably used 

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.760
 a less precise rifle allocation and 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:53.470
 you still shooting 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:55.000
 and here it comes sparse and here it is 

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:56.500
 throw it down and here I throw it where 

00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.910
 he sees that there are enemies he probably was 

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.530
 biased but not even able to 

00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:00.940
 understand if they were actually there though 

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.230
 nobody is shot at the club though 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.730
 now the erioli will break 

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.290
 all of them and here it continues to 

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.130
 right to left but from take the weapon e 

00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:07.330
 of the laser sight 

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:08.770
 in reality this is more powerful than 

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:10.270
 Donkey even if less ammunition succeeds 

00:07:08.770 --> 00:07:10.990
 to be more precise than the sniper who 

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:12.760
 he had before 

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.890
 and here it continues not and here it goes 

00:07:12.760 --> 00:07:16.600
 go ahead and here goes on 

00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:18.280
 and here it continues still approaching 

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:20.140
 with the snout leo of placidia hiding 

00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:21.790
 I don't know what the hell it is behind it 

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.020
 behind the thing is good that there are gods 

00:07:21.790 --> 00:07:24.400
 flying skulls in the air that I don't know 

00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:25.930
 not even what they probably are 

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:28.390
 of the enemies who have died and here is the 

00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.920
 their nine soul and kill everyone is the 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.689
 limit of points achieved ladies 

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:33.509
 really 

00:07:30.689 --> 00:07:34.739
 an exciting game I succeeded 

00:07:33.509 --> 00:07:36.239
 also to make a commentary in the gods 

00:07:34.739 --> 00:07:38.369
 moments where no fucking happens then 

00:07:36.239 --> 00:07:41.069
 I consider myself fully satisfied with 

00:07:38.369 --> 00:07:43.199
 this comment is fine 

00:07:41.069 --> 00:07:45.659
