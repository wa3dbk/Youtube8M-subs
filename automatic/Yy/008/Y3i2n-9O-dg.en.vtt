correctly<00:01:43.500> I<00:01:44.040> believe<00:01:44.220> Lane<00:01:45.000> Kiffin<00:01:45.299> who's

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
correctly I believe Lane Kiffin who's

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.469 
correctly I believe Lane Kiffin who's
not<00:01:45.899> even<00:01:46.140> an<00:01:46.229> NFL<00:01:46.740> anymore<00:01:47.189> I<00:01:47.460> don't<00:01:47.820> think<00:01:48.060> he

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
not even an NFL anymore I don't think he

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.780 
not even an NFL anymore I don't think he
wanted<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.899> draft<00:01:49.200> them<00:01:49.409> Tom<00:01:50.009> I<00:01:50.280> punched<00:01:50.670> my

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
wanted to draft them Tom I punched my

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.700 
wanted to draft them Tom I punched my
assistant<00:01:51.270> coaches<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.720> the<00:01:51.810> face<00:01:51.990> cable<00:01:52.500> I

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
assistant coaches in the face cable I

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.830 
assistant coaches in the face cable I
don't<00:01:53.250> think<00:01:53.460> he<00:01:53.640> wants<00:01:53.970> anything<00:01:54.329> to<00:01:54.630> do<00:01:54.810> with

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
don't think he wants anything to do with

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.109 
don't think he wants anything to do with
them<00:01:55.110> so<00:01:55.290> bottom<00:01:55.920> line<00:01:55.950> is<00:01:56.130> you've<00:01:56.909> probably

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
them so bottom line is you've probably

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:59.389 
them so bottom line is you've probably
heard<00:01:57.479> they<00:01:57.990> want<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.320> release<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.829> man<00:01:59.070> I
