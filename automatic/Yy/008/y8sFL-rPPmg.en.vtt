00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.670
 hello you welcome to my dear 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:16.680
 fourth video from my Easter series 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.000
 Today we will do a small packing 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.369
 make because you have any 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.259
 little things have sweets to 

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:24.689
 example, in a little cute 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:27.060
 carrot pack volts from paper of course 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.009
 yes then I'll show you how you do this 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.330
 You can also make carrot crafts 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.000
 really very few materials 

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:35.070
 for that you need orange once 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.320
 katz there, of course, like motive 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.600
 paper of orange in some form 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:41.489
 is or the carrot then remembers 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.469
 she needs the crepe paper in green 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.480
 Of course you can also use green napkins 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.379
 take something easy 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.899
 bend 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:50.879
 so in the art then I have now 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:52.829
 green loop still used 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 Of course, such standard things like 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.890
 We need glue and scissors 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.510
 a circle then, of course, a ruler and 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.550
 pencil pretty much like that 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:04.500
 always and I have now a 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.710
 engines stanza would be best 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:09.570
 But such a motive sports scissors 

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.280
 It does not take more than that 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.530
 Start now and build us first 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.830
 from the orange katsdorf the 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.330
 base for our carrot and that's what we take 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.550
 i here just my circle and 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.200
 first look how long my carrot 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.840
 I shall have here now approximately 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.970
 10 cm I think that was the chosen one 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.530
 length and that has given me enough 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.690
 just how big your character 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.610
 have the size want you doing this 

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:35.429
 of course the more sweets or 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:37.200
 Otherwise, of course, it fits in well then 

00:01:35.429 --> 00:01:39.810
 I chose a wide me 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.590
 I have now decided for 7 cm 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:47.250
 or 14 centimeters wide her that 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:49.500
 makes the bigger the quasi top then 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.509
 the circle of a small bag 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.879
 you just have to have a look 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.709
 7 cm was so in my opinion 

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:57.509
 order and then I have the 

00:01:55.709 --> 00:01:59.369
 is seven centimeters measured the 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:01.289
 then my center and then again 

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:03.629
 seven centimeters in addition to the right 

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:06.390
 So at 14 cm still a small 

00:02:03.629 --> 00:02:10.259
 mark and then we can ours 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:12.840
 Circle attach to the 7 cm mark and 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.550
 us a little yes pseudo semicircle 

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:16.920
 So do not pull completely semicircle and 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:18.859
 Although the brand must be up to 14 centimeters 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.510
 You have to go with the ruler 

00:02:18.859 --> 00:02:23.159
 go vertically upwards so 90 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.930
 angle you can do this either 

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:27.150
 Use geodreieck I have that now 

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:28.950
 Here I roughly estimated 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:29.730
 can do that quite well by eye 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:31.709
 you can do that too 

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.720
 Check by looking where yours 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:35.519
 circle on the left stops and 

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.319
 Just have a look if you then 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.060
 to mark your mark from mest you 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.940
 Have you ever appreciated that? 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:44.879
 14 inches wide if that is so 

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:46.379
 then you have measured perfectly and that 

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:49.049
 then we just cut it with the whole 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.310
 scissors out of simple and the pencil 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:51.780
 Of course, you can mark it in the 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.060
 then erase connection 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.920
 now it is very useful if you have one 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.200
 Border scissors to hand you can 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.190
 Of course, like to leave so smooth 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.870
 I say I think so 

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:03.239
 quite simply just such a beautiful 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.480
 accent if the edge is still such a 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:07.829
 Pretty saboteure I have one here 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.720
 however, scissors is the 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.739
 terribly I scrap so that is 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.420
 really not to use at all 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:13.709
 I do not know what went wrong 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:14.790
 is definitely cutting the scissors 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:16.260
 somehow not really 

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:18.209
 That's why I have one here now 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:19.739
 touch punch and yes it is 

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:21.780
 a bit of a frieze job 

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.150
 Of course it is not optimal because 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:26.430
 This bordren punch is for straight 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.730
 designed and now we have 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:31.199
 here knew a vaulted and therefore 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.690
 is it a bit frieze me too 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.940
 because we stood in such a dry state 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:37.650
 the paper stood but yes you can 

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:40.379
 a little bit around it if you work 

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.579
 So it's a bit hard 

00:03:40.379 --> 00:03:44.609
 is also something I always say 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:46.769
 when you see something in others and you 

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:48.569
 did not try that yourself then 

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:50.639
 So then I think that makes sense 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:52.829
 Let's think about what you have to 

00:03:50.639 --> 00:03:55.109
 home does not matter if you do not like that 

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.120
 something similar can happen instead 

00:03:55.109 --> 00:04:00.419
 then buy everything immediately after that 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.910
 if you try hard and yes a few 

00:04:00.419 --> 00:04:04.859
 Compromise buying then you come 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.199
 pretty much always that way 

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:10.949
 So let's just say that on the edge 

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:12.389
 little yes inspirational support lives there 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.849
 not on if you do not mess so much 

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.799
 definitely have me here 

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.739
 just a little pretty punched 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:21.000
 on a carrot then I stick now 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:23.310
 the crepe paper 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.900
 and yes I have two lay here now 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.580
 crepe paper taken you can do three 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.900
 could take only one take there 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:28.949
 you just have to look like I said 

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.740
 Of course you can also napkins 

00:04:28.949 --> 00:04:33.470
 take or something similar stuff or 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.090
 Something like that somehow 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:37.400
 In any case, I have the crepe paper 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:39.560
 just war with glue 

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:42.620
 glued to the edge of mine 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:44.270
 carrot on this arched edge and 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.930
 by making the crepe paper now 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.700
 I say sticking around it affects itself 

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.200
 that is completely normal and that 

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:52.610
 is also wanted so go there 

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.160
 no thoughts that maybe one 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:56.450
 a bit weird at the moment or still 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.800
 at the moment where he is now with this 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:00.170
 step since that's really 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.940
 completely in order and later let him 

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:03.190
 then be like I said 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.270
 now here were two crepe paper 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.580
 Glued on each other I found that 

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.620
 just a bit prettier and ever 

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.420
 after what you use for a glue 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.630
 you have to pay attention to yours 

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.340
 glue always dries well 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.750
 not that it's easy for you 

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:20.300
 fall off while you do that 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.500
 further processed clever dry 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.550
 we can now do the packaging 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.610
 stick together 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:28.490
 if it's not so easy for you yes 

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:30.890
 the almost round to bend or stop in 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.320
 buckling shape can you also if 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:35.870
 bavaria use the whole thing like that 

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:37.730
 bit in shape to offer a little 

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.560
 if you have mine just take something 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:41.120
 with a round surface where you can do that 

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:42.680
 somehow wrap around it or 

00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:43.970
 so there are many possibilities 

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.110
 you just have to go there 

00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:47.330
 try what they do best 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:50.150
 get along and then you just give 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.090
 Glue on one side and glue that 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.870
 whole just just in this form 

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:56.479
 together 

00:05:53.870 --> 00:05:59.090
 and that was it already now 

00:05:56.479 --> 00:06:01.580
 So you can put your sweets in yours 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.800
 small carrot packaging and 

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:05.960
 the whole then with your ribbon 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.160
 easy to knot up 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.890
 Unfortunately I have only a few here 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.400
 short or very not so wide 

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:14.750
 script paper had to hand 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:17.030
 Of course it would be better if you were there 

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:18.919
 you can use wider crepe paper 

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:20.479
 or if that's not quite so far 

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:22.729
 sticking down then it still looks 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:25.550
 a little bit nicer it was now 

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.710
 a bit chubby for me the 

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:29.060
 not too high to tie 

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:31.220
 but otherwise it works really well 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.500
 Just sweets and above 

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:35.330
 too knotted with a pretty bow 

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.630
 and that's it already works 

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:40.460
 super fast and very easy i say 

00:06:38.630 --> 00:06:43.220
 sometimes in masses to produce if one 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:44.790
 somehow very many people something 

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:46.950
 wants to give I think is the one 

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:49.110
 sweet idea a very sweet little good 

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:51.180
 Idea, of course, you can go even further 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:53.850
 decorate one can do so much with it 

00:06:51.180 --> 00:06:56.100
 you can stamp but put on sayings 

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.020
 to bring ex install and so on and 

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:59.190
 So far, creativity really is 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:01.290
 no limits set 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:02.850
 I thank you for being too much, I hope so 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:04.620
 I enjoyed you a bit 

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:06.360
 wish you much fun if you do that 

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:09.360
 would like to tinker whole 

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:11.400
 and then we'll see each other 

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.410
 Saturday again that will be the last 

00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:13.830
 video from the first row for this 

00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:16.110
 year 

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:18.330
 and yes I hope you are looking forward to it 

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:20.670
 it gets a bit sad again 

00:07:18.330 --> 00:07:22.770
 I'll say a tutorial that yourself 

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.450
 many of you have wished 

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:26.340
 otherwise I link you here too 

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.950
 again the oster playlist with the three 

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:30.600
 other easter videos already existed 

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:32.970
