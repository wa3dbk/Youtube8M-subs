 great news for all those 

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:09.540
 they were waiting for her 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:13.769
 that is, the success of the route 

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:19.380
 on the acer iconia 1 830 I show that 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:25.830
 just he is he is he and I don't 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:29.869
 see also that everything is for everything 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:39.420
 unlocked then first of all there is that 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:43.950
 we verify and then with a beautiful one 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:51.180
 overview of sd even tells me that 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:56.239
 I have to give him grants of permits so it is 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.239
 unlocked and here's a nice overview 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.379
 it's all OK 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.350
 well guys now I'll show you the 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.290
 procedure to the computer procedure that 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.409
 will be performed with a developed toolkit 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:13.470
 from me along with the whole community of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.869
 we got Android developers 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.990
 below always definitively succeeded in 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.009
 unlock this blessed acer than not 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.570
 he wanted to know 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.880
 all the applications you don't 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.770
 all tool kits worked from 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.770
 computer windows didn't work 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:31.890
 they always came to install the super 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.470
 Roman museums did not succeed 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:38.310
 to grant this to the procedure 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.350
 final complete I think is the only one 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.270
 however the toolkit always in 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:47.350
 update guys then others too 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:50.430
 devices will be able to cover in the future 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.430
 let's move on to the neighborhood 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:56.650
 ok guys here we are at the computer for the 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.200
 configuration I leave you this folder 

00:01:56.650 --> 00:02:01.390
 tablet to extract plus two more 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.700
 compressed folders to copy this here 

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:07.240
 rootkits as they are without extracting 

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:10.289
 boys left as they are and e 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.289
 we launch the program 

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:22.780
 we accept sending to that point 2 because 

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:26.650
 is for mac the pledge then at 1 because it is 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:32.860
 for the udc and one because it stands for jelly 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:38.290
 bean 422 and make the two faces r 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:41.950
 because superuser I prefer to send to 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:44.459
 this point and we accept again e 

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.459
 we send 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:54.250
 now the kit stops here because 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.630
 wait and wait for the device 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:58.350
 now I'll show you with the video camera 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:00.400
 what happens and will happen with you 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.260
 the device well in this mode 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.299
 cli red bull and two were therefore what 

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.340
 let's go and press 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:13.350
 simply the power button for 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.350
 get it started montanitÃ  android put 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:23.270
 is leaving you see it is he is there remains 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:27.550
 so nothing has changed 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:27.550
 what we do now I'll show you 

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:33.230
 good guys now that how he had done 

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.770
 see everything stopped first 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.430
 let's go to windows 8.1 let's go 

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:43.870
 device suggestions up here you see 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:46.610
 android phone than the exclamation point 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.490
 because precisely because it does not recognize the 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:51.770
 dragut mode so we don't 

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:53.840
 day to driver searches for software in the 

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:56.540
 computer layout and choose 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:04:01.280
 manually milenko now android 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:03.709
 device then we reduce clarifying one 

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.530
 what the former should work 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:13.330
 four to always install then 1111 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:16.760
 there is no chance or the first two seconds 

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:22.910
 or the first two or it and the third and fourth 

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:25.580
 I used the first and the second in 

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:28.030
 this way I don't know about it today 

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:32.450
 talk sorry guys anyway 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:36.880
 then first the second ahead yes 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:36.880
 the warning let everyone stay 

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.520
 then what happened the device 

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:45.500
 one composed of some appeared 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:51.620
 written and written ok the program 

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:54.890
 remained so now yes now 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:58.210
 we recharge what we have 

00:04:54.890 --> 00:05:00.850
 done first a day to drivers 

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:05.090
 let's try it by hand 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:10.000
 android for one this time instead 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:15.710
 that the second the first forward closes 

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:19.040
 see how a game to bring 

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:22.570
 installation and is complete now the 

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:22.570
 device has been unlocked 

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.710
 what to say that it has nothing less bad less 

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.870
 bad because it was a long time that not that 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:36.470
 you were not in charge of this routing 

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:38.750
 for cir 830 Luckily, I have to say 

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.870
 the credit is not only mine but of the whole 

00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:46.220
 android developer community that 

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:48.260
 through tests through knowledge 

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:49.880
 shared guys like we do 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:51.740
 let's try this core other program 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:53.660
 we were able to create this tool kit 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.060
 which in the end however always in 

00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:58.580
 continuous evolution and will also support 

00:05:56.060 --> 00:06:03.100
 other devices well guys for 

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:05.900
 this acer 830 80 brother-in-law ruth is everything 

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:10.750
 I thank you for watching and I hope to
