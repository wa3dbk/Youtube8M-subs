00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:03.959 
hi this is yellow 13s bringing you the

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:10.220 
hi this is yellow 13s bringing you the
GAF<00:00:04.859> one<00:00:05.600> four<00:00:06.600> o'clock<00:00:07.189> now<00:00:08.189> this<00:00:08.460> plane<00:00:09.230> was

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
GAF one four o'clock now this plane was

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.610 
GAF one four o'clock now this plane was
made<00:00:10.440> before<00:00:10.650> my<00:00:11.160> su-47<00:00:12.030> so<00:00:12.690> might<00:00:13.200> not<00:00:13.320> be<00:00:13.500> as

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:13.620 
made before my su-47 so might not be as

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.279 
made before my su-47 so might not be as
good<00:00:14.269> but<00:00:15.269> this<00:00:15.780> plane<00:00:16.400> came<00:00:17.400> from<00:00:17.960> nan<00:00:18.960> pose

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:19.289 
good but this plane came from nan pose

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:25.609 
good but this plane came from nan pose
new<00:00:19.770> game<00:00:20.070> um<00:00:20.400> is<00:00:21.890> combat<00:00:22.890> joint<00:00:23.220> assault<00:00:24.619> so

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
new game um is combat joint assault so

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.540 
new game um is combat joint assault so
this<00:00:25.890> is<00:00:25.920> the<00:00:26.310> super<00:00:26.730> plane<00:00:27.029> of<00:00:27.390> that<00:00:27.689> game<00:00:27.960> I

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:28.550 
this is the super plane of that game I

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.229 
this is the super plane of that game I
decided<00:00:29.550> to<00:00:29.760> make<00:00:29.789> a<00:00:30.269> model<00:00:31.019> out<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.619> it<00:00:32.239> so

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
decided to make a model out of it so

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:43.569 
decided to make a model out of it so
here<00:00:33.780> it<00:00:33.870> is

00:00:43.569 --> 00:00:43.579 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.899 

alright<00:00:44.329> let's<00:00:44.690> give<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:44.929> a<00:00:45.050> few<00:00:45.350> test<00:00:45.800> flights

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 

00:00:48.909 --> 00:01:01.770 

hold<00:00:49.909> on

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:01.780 

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.530 

this<00:01:02.320> is<00:01:02.949> as<00:01:03.219> very<00:01:03.579> I<00:01:05.700> wouldn't<00:01:06.700> say<00:01:06.790> the<00:01:07.210> best

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
this is as very I wouldn't say the best

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:12.260 
this is as very I wouldn't say the best
but<00:01:08.049> this<00:01:08.229> is<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.409> very<00:01:08.790> unbalanced<00:01:10.950> aircraft

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
but this is a very unbalanced aircraft

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.730 
but this is a very unbalanced aircraft
as<00:01:13.270> you<00:01:13.390> can<00:01:13.509> see<00:01:13.780> it<00:01:15.000> stall<00:01:16.110> at<00:01:17.110> very<00:01:17.500> low

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
as you can see it stall at very low

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:24.560 
as you can see it stall at very low
speeds<00:01:18.100> so<00:01:18.550> not<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.240> very<00:01:20.229> good<00:01:22.590> paper<00:01:23.590> airplane

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
speeds so not a very good paper airplane

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:35.660 
speeds so not a very good paper airplane
doesn't<00:01:25.570> apply<00:01:25.899> as<00:01:26.140> well<00:01:26.170> as<00:01:26.470> my<00:01:26.649> others

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.130 

because<00:01:36.479> um<00:01:36.960> I<00:01:37.409> think<00:01:37.740> it's<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:39.140> has

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because um I think it's because it has

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.810 
because um I think it's because it has
little<00:01:40.890> wing<00:01:41.280> area<00:01:41.930> see<00:01:42.930> over<00:01:43.500> here<00:01:43.580> there's<00:01:44.580> a

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
little wing area see over here there's a

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.380 
little wing area see over here there's a
lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.149> wing<00:01:45.540> area<00:01:46.939> there's<00:01:47.939> only<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.180> little

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
lot of wing area there's only a little

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.260 
lot of wing area there's only a little
bit<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.899> fun<00:01:49.200> but<00:01:50.189> a<00:01:50.220> lot<00:01:50.490> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.700> back<00:01:50.909> so

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
bit in a fun but a lot in the back so

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.230 
bit in a fun but a lot in the back so
it's<00:01:51.420> basically<00:01:51.659> like<00:01:52.049> a<00:01:52.110> flying<00:01:52.500> start

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
it's basically like a flying start

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:04.590 
it's basically like a flying start
that's<00:01:54.240> what<00:01:54.450> I<00:01:54.479> would<00:01:54.570> consider<00:01:54.899> it

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.490 

and<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:06.369> make<00:02:06.490> it<00:02:06.700> fun<00:02:06.939> well<00:02:07.240> however<00:02:07.570> you<00:02:08.289> have

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:08.500 
and to make it fun well however you have

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.020 
and to make it fun well however you have
to<00:02:08.649> really<00:02:10.680> chuck<00:02:11.680> it<00:02:11.709> so<00:02:12.550> that<00:02:12.760> it<00:02:12.910> goes

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
to really chuck it so that it goes

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:16.229 
to really chuck it so that it goes
really<00:02:13.300> fast<00:02:13.690> and<00:02:14.380> then<00:02:14.470> it<00:02:14.709> flies<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:16.090> let<00:02:16.209> me

00:02:16.229 --> 00:02:16.239 
really fast and then it flies so let me

00:02:16.239 --> 00:02:36.580 
really fast and then it flies so let me
try<00:02:16.510> that<00:02:27.510> let's<00:02:28.510> try<00:02:28.660> that<00:02:28.870> again

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:48.400 

doesn't<00:02:37.370> fly<00:02:37.730> very<00:02:37.790> well

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:52.360 

I<00:02:49.120> was<00:02:50.120> expecting<00:02:50.390> it<00:02:50.780> to<00:02:50.840> fly<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.890> perform

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 
I was expecting it to fly and perform

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.380 
I was expecting it to fly and perform
like<00:02:52.580> the<00:02:52.760> one<00:02:53.090> in<00:02:53.120> the<00:02:53.390> game<00:02:53.600> but<00:02:54.850> it<00:02:55.850> turned

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
like the one in the game but it turned

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.740 
like the one in the game but it turned
out<00:02:56.510> didn't<00:02:56.990> do<00:02:57.080> that<00:02:58.210> it's<00:02:59.210> just<00:02:59.480> a<00:02:59.570> good

00:02:59.740 --> 00:02:59.750 
out didn't do that it's just a good

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.800 
out didn't do that it's just a good
model<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:01.340> really<00:03:01.850> doesn't<00:03:02.210> fly<00:03:02.810> I<00:03:04.540> was<00:03:05.540> a

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
model but really doesn't fly I was a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.920 
model but really doesn't fly I was a
good<00:03:06.170> flight<00:03:06.470> but<00:03:06.770> I<00:03:07.510> don't<00:03:08.510> know<00:03:08.630> its<00:03:08.780> other

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
good flight but I don't know its other

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:12.370 
good flight but I don't know its other
place<00:03:09.320> they<00:03:09.620> don't<00:03:09.800> it<00:03:10.370> doesn't<00:03:10.910> even<00:03:11.380> fly

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:12.380 
place they don't it doesn't even fly

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:22.449 
place they don't it doesn't even fly
that<00:03:12.620> well

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:25.449 

once<00:03:23.459> again<00:03:23.670> this<00:03:24.090> is<00:03:24.150> yellow<00:03:24.540> 13<00:03:24.959> ace

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
once again this is yellow 13 ace

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:31.360 
once again this is yellow 13 ace
bringing<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.700> an<00:03:27.379> epic<00:03:28.379> fail<00:03:29.480> when<00:03:30.480> aircraft

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:31.370 
bringing you an epic fail when aircraft

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.300 
bringing you an epic fail when aircraft
but<00:03:32.370> this<00:03:33.090> airplane<00:03:33.750> is<00:03:33.870> pretty<00:03:34.530> cool<00:03:34.739> I<00:03:35.010> think

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:35.310 
but this airplane is pretty cool I think

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.270 
but this airplane is pretty cool I think
it's<00:03:36.180> based<00:03:36.480> on<00:03:36.690> the<00:03:36.750> game<00:03:36.989> is<00:03:37.349> combat<00:03:37.890> join<00:03:38.129> us

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
it's based on the game is combat join us

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.470 
it's based on the game is combat join us
all<00:03:41.360> yeah<00:03:42.360> until<00:03:42.870> next<00:03:43.230> time
