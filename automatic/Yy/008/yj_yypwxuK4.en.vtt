like<00:01:08.369> some<00:01:08.549> people<00:01:08.790> do<00:01:08.939> it<00:01:09.270> just<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:10.200> too

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
like some people do it just it's too

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.660 
like some people do it just it's too
much<00:01:10.530> work<00:01:11.479> the<00:01:12.479> first<00:01:12.720> strategy<00:01:12.990> I'd<00:01:13.380> I<00:01:13.770> think

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
much work the first strategy I'd I think

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:16.820 
much work the first strategy I'd I think
that<00:01:14.850> defensive<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.600> best<00:01:15.869> because<00:01:16.409> they<00:01:16.650> are

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
that defensive the best because they are

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.020 
that defensive the best because they are
very<00:01:17.360> heavy<00:01:18.770> the<00:01:19.770> crosshairs<00:01:20.280> mood<00:01:20.640> they're

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030

short<00:01:57.810> burst<00:01:57.990> and<00:01:58.380> I'm<00:01:58.890> aiming<00:01:59.670> your<00:02:00.030> stick

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
short burst and I'm aiming your stick

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.920 
short burst and I'm aiming your stick
that<00:02:01.079> moves<00:02:01.920> the<00:02:02.189> gun<00:02:02.880> amed<00:02:03.479> down<00:02:03.689> a<00:02:03.719> little

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:03.930 
that moves the gun amed down a little

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:10.190 
that moves the gun amed down a little
bit<00:02:04.110> not<00:02:04.950> allow<00:02:05.369> come<00:02:06.299> on<00:02:07.520> if<00:02:08.520> you<00:02:09.000> wanted<00:02:09.360> full

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
bit not allow come on if you wanted full

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.580 
bit not allow come on if you wanted full
auto<00:02:10.440> you<00:02:11.069> want<00:02:11.250> to<00:02:11.340> point<00:02:11.520> it<00:02:11.610> down<00:02:11.760> even<00:02:11.910> more

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
auto you want to point it down even more

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.809 
auto you want to point it down even more
I<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:12.950> recommend<00:02:13.160> full<00:02:13.640> auto<00:02:15.340> moving<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.489> ah

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:16.819 
I would recommend full auto moving on ah

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.570 
I would recommend full auto moving on ah
well<00:02:17.690> move<00:02:18.110> back<00:02:18.140> to<00:02:18.560> that<00:02:18.709> you<00:02:19.099> have<00:02:19.280> the<00:02:19.370> grip

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:19.580 
well move back to that you have the grip

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.759 
well move back to that you have the grip
on<00:02:19.760> it<00:02:20.000> will<00:02:20.239> help<00:02:20.540> reduce<00:02:20.780> the<00:02:20.930> recoil<00:02:21.200> a<00:02:21.590> good

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
on it will help reduce the recoil a good

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.440 
on it will help reduce the recoil a good
bit<00:02:21.980> it's<00:02:22.220> like<00:02:22.370> a<00:02:22.459> silencer<00:02:22.940> for<00:02:23.090> a<00:02:23.180> normal

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:23.450 
bit it's like a silencer for a normal

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:28.660 
bit it's like a silencer for a normal
gun<00:02:23.599> I<00:02:23.870> helps<00:02:24.830> reduce<00:02:25.220> the<00:02:25.370> replay<00:02:27.580> if<00:02:28.580> you

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
gun I helps reduce the replay if you

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:30.430 
gun I helps reduce the replay if you
want<00:02:28.849> to<00:02:28.910> be<00:02:29.000> aggressive<00:02:29.209> I<00:02:29.690> suggest<00:02:30.230> using

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:30.440 
want to be aggressive I suggest using

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.130 
want to be aggressive I suggest using
the<00:02:30.879> sleight-of-hand<00:02:31.879> perk<00:02:32.420> instead<00:02:33.080> of

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.140 
the sleight-of-hand perk instead of

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:35.470 
the sleight-of-hand perk instead of
stopping<00:02:33.560> power<00:02:33.830> because<00:02:34.790> other<00:02:35.060> time<00:02:35.360> it

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:35.480 
stopping power because other time it

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.600 
stopping power because other time it
takes<00:02:35.629> to<00:02:35.810> reload<00:02:36.080> on<00:02:36.620> if<00:02:37.340> you're<00:02:37.489> being

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:37.610 
takes to reload on if you're being

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.070 
takes to reload on if you're being
aggressive<00:02:38.120> you're<00:02:38.209> not<00:02:38.360> going<00:02:38.569> to<00:02:38.629> find<00:02:38.750> very

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:39.080 
aggressive you're not going to find very

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.100 
aggressive you're not going to find very
good<00:02:39.260> spots<00:02:39.769> too<00:02:40.190> long<00:02:40.400> we<00:02:41.330> wait<00:02:41.660> and<00:02:41.780> reload

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
good spots too long we wait and reload

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.750 
good spots too long we wait and reload
you're<00:02:42.260> probably<00:02:42.440> gonna<00:02:42.620> get<00:02:42.769> found<00:02:43.190> is<00:02:43.519> going

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
you're probably gonna get found is going

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.210 
you're probably gonna get found is going
to<00:02:43.819> be<00:02:43.910> close<00:02:44.209> to<00:02:44.239> the<00:02:44.480> enemy<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.560> I<00:02:45.650> playing

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
to be close to the enemy then I playing

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.000 
to be close to the enemy then I playing
defensively<00:02:46.790> so<00:02:47.030> I<00:02:47.090> suggest<00:02:47.599> using<00:02:48.560> steady

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
defensively so I suggest using steady

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.610 
defensively so I suggest using steady
aim<00:02:49.190> and<00:02:49.579> slide<00:02:50.000> a<00:02:50.030> hand<00:02:50.120> I'll<00:02:51.110> probably<00:02:51.319> work

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
aim and slide a hand I'll probably work

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.830 
aim and slide a hand I'll probably work
again<00:02:52.250> I<00:02:52.340> don't<00:02:52.400> recommend<00:02:53.120> use<00:02:53.450> it<00:02:53.599> being

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:53.840 
again I don't recommend use it being

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.960 
again I don't recommend use it being
aggressive<00:02:54.319> but<00:02:54.530> maybe<00:02:55.069> play<00:02:55.489> how<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.760> want

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
aggressive but maybe play how you want

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:58.770 
aggressive but maybe play how you want
to<00:02:56.000> play<00:02:56.120> I'm<00:02:56.780> not<00:02:56.989> going<00:02:57.200> to<00:02:57.260> sit<00:02:57.379> here<00:02:57.440> and<00:02:57.650> I

100 round clip ID and I do relive a lot
I<00:03:08.870> tend<00:03:09.230> not<00:03:09.319> to<00:03:09.910> reload<00:03:10.910> until<00:03:11.299> it's

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
only have a few left and they're pushing

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.879 
only have a few left and they're pushing
towards<00:03:47.750> in<00:03:47.900> that<00:03:48.139> case<00:03:48.380> you<00:03:48.410> want<00:03:48.650> to<00:03:48.680> move

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:48.889 
towards in that case you want to move

00:03:48.889 --> 00:03:53.309 
towards in that case you want to move
back<00:03:49.160> behind<00:03:49.970> something<00:03:50.389> impenetrable

00:03:53.309 --> 00:03:53.319 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.839 

methods<00:03:54.319> for<00:03:54.530> shooting<00:03:54.919> like<00:03:55.280> I<00:03:55.370> said<00:03:55.430> burst

00:03:55.839 --> 00:03:55.849 
methods for shooting like I said burst

00:03:55.849 --> 00:03:57.849 
methods for shooting like I said burst
you<00:03:56.329> can't<00:03:56.599> shoot<00:03:56.780> very<00:03:57.079> long<00:03:57.260> distance<00:03:57.709> with

00:03:57.849 --> 00:03:57.859 
you can't shoot very long distance with

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:00.430 
you can't shoot very long distance with
