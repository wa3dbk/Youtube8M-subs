00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.890 
only medecine forests I've said that we
are<00:01:36.119> growing<00:01:36.799> indigenous<00:01:37.799> trees<00:01:38.540> which<00:01:39.540> grow

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
are growing indigenous trees which grow

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.230 
are growing indigenous trees which grow
in<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:40.229> area<00:01:40.439> and<00:01:40.740> some<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:42.060> indigenous

in the area and some of the indigenous
trees<00:01:42.689> are<00:01:42.930> endangered<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> so<00:01:43.950> we<00:01:44.759> have

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:44.909 
trees are endangered and so we have

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:48.109 
trees are endangered and so we have
brought<00:01:45.240> them<00:01:45.450> in<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.409> farm<00:01:46.710> to<00:01:47.399> be<00:01:47.520> grown<00:01:47.820> and

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
brought them in the farm to be grown and

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.630 
brought them in the farm to be grown and
then<00:01:48.780> well<00:01:49.590> if<00:01:49.770> they<00:01:49.950> are<00:01:50.040> going<00:01:50.189> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.399> grown

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
then well if they are going to be grown

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.190 
then well if they are going to be grown
in<00:01:50.790> this<00:01:50.939> farm<00:01:51.270> they're<00:01:51.570> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.869> be<00:01:51.990> used

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
in this farm they're going to be used

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:56.810 
in this farm they're going to be used
later<00:01:52.770> as<00:01:53.310> a<00:01:54.770> way<00:01:55.770> you're<00:01:56.009> providing<00:01:56.490> seeds

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
later as a way you're providing seeds

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.959 
later as a way you're providing seeds
for<00:01:57.090> the<00:01:57.210> endangered<00:01:57.509> trees<00:01:57.990> so<00:01:58.950> for<00:01:59.850> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
for the endangered trees so for that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.459 
for the endangered trees so for that
purpose<00:02:00.180> they<00:02:00.570> are<00:02:00.600> going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.869> be<00:02:01.079> concerned

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469
