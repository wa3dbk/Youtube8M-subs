would call me out on it so there I
mentioned<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.310> you<00:05:50.700> can<00:05:50.880> check<00:05:51.090> that<00:05:51.270> one<00:05:51.450> off

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:51.510 
mentioned it you can check that one off

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:53.810 
mentioned it you can check that one off
your<00:05:51.690> stupid<00:05:52.169> list<00:05:52.620> and<00:05:52.979> at<00:05:53.160> this<00:05:53.310> point<00:05:53.550> there

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:53.820 
your stupid list and at this point there

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.040 
your stupid list and at this point there
isn't<00:05:53.940> really<00:05:54.210> all<00:05:54.450> that<00:05:54.540> much<00:05:54.690> more<00:05:54.870> to<00:05:54.930> talk

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
isn't really all that much more to talk

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:57.140 
isn't really all that much more to talk
about<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.560> only<00:05:55.770> got<00:05:55.979> up<00:05:56.100> to<00:05:56.220> level<00:05:56.430> 15<00:05:56.880> so<00:05:57.120> that

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:57.150 
about I only got up to level 15 so that

00:05:57.150 --> 00:05:58.520 
about I only got up to level 15 so that
I<00:05:57.300> could<00:05:57.450> become<00:05:57.540> a<00:05:57.660> priest<00:05:58.050> and<00:05:58.260> test<00:05:58.410> that

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:58.530 
I could become a priest and test that

00:05:58.530 --> 00:05:59.780 
I could become a priest and test that
out<00:05:58.650> a<00:05:58.680> bit<00:05:58.800> and<00:05:59.100> I<00:05:59.250> actually<00:05:59.430> plan<00:05:59.760> on

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
out a bit and I actually plan on

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.400 
out a bit and I actually plan on
continuing<00:06:00.060> to<00:06:00.390> play<00:06:00.570> the<00:06:00.690> game<00:06:00.870> simply

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:01.410 
continuing to play the game simply

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:03.020 
continuing to play the game simply
because<00:06:01.860> of<00:06:01.979> the<00:06:02.070> community<00:06:02.490> yeah<00:06:02.790> that's

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
because of the community yeah that's

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.610 
because of the community yeah that's
actually<00:06:03.210> an<00:06:03.450> aspect<00:06:03.750> that<00:06:03.840> really<00:06:03.960> helps<00:06:04.530> a

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:04.620 
actually an aspect that really helps a

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.320 
actually an aspect that really helps a
game<00:06:04.800> that<00:06:05.280> much<00:06:05.550> and<00:06:05.970> it's<00:06:06.180> usually

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:06.330 
game that much and it's usually

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.810 
game that much and it's usually
painfully<00:06:07.080> ignored<00:06:07.470> a<00:06:07.740> good<00:06:08.100> community<00:06:08.610> can

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:08.820 
painfully ignored a good community can

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:10.550 
painfully ignored a good community can
really<00:06:08.850> help<00:06:09.300> elevate<00:06:09.750> a<00:06:09.780> game<00:06:10.020> in<00:06:10.260> this

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:10.560 
really help elevate a game in this

00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:12.590 
really help elevate a game in this
example<00:06:10.919> Dragon<00:06:11.520> Nest<00:06:11.700> which<00:06:12.000> is<00:06:12.150> essentially

00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:12.600 
example Dragon Nest which is essentially

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.750 
example Dragon Nest which is essentially
Vindictus<00:06:13.050> rises<00:06:13.590> above<00:06:13.860> that<00:06:14.100> game<00:06:14.310> simply

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:14.760 
Vindictus rises above that game simply

00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.890 
Vindictus rises above that game simply
due<00:06:14.940> to<00:06:14.970> people<00:06:15.180> being<00:06:15.479> friendly<00:06:15.810> and

00:06:15.890 --> 00:06:15.900 
due to people being friendly and

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.630 
due to people being friendly and
talkative<00:06:16.110> I<00:06:16.560> also<00:06:16.800> thought<00:06:17.040> the<00:06:17.190> combat<00:06:17.550> was

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
talkative I also thought the combat was

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:19.550 
talkative I also thought the combat was
a<00:06:17.700> bit<00:06:17.880> more<00:06:17.970> fluid<00:06:18.300> and<00:06:18.330> responsive<00:06:18.479> and<00:06:19.080> in<00:06:19.470> a

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
a bit more fluid and responsive and in a

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.200 
a bit more fluid and responsive and in a
game<00:06:19.680> based<00:06:19.919> all<00:06:20.070> around<00:06:20.310> combat<00:06:20.700> that's<00:06:20.970> kind

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
game based all around combat that's kind

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.090 
game based all around combat that's kind
of<00:06:21.270> important<00:06:21.750> much<00:06:22.020> like<00:06:22.260> Vindictus<00:06:22.800> I<00:06:22.979> wish

00:06:23.090 --> 00:06:23.100 
of important much like Vindictus I wish

00:06:23.100 --> 00:06:24.680 
of important much like Vindictus I wish
the<00:06:23.250> game<00:06:23.400> had<00:06:23.610> more<00:06:23.820> of<00:06:23.910> an<00:06:23.970> open<00:06:24.210> world<00:06:24.390> and

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:24.690 
the game had more of an open world and

00:06:24.690 --> 00:06:26.420 
the game had more of an open world and
maybe<00:06:25.080> it<00:06:25.229> opens<00:06:25.470> up<00:06:25.560> at<00:06:25.650> later<00:06:25.800> levels<00:06:26.190> but

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430 
maybe it opens up at later levels but

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:28.130 
maybe it opens up at later levels but
right<00:06:26.610> now<00:06:26.790> it's<00:06:27.060> just<00:06:27.270> a<00:06:27.390> city<00:06:27.600> that<00:06:27.780> leads<00:06:27.990> to

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:28.140 
right now it's just a city that leads to

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.540 
right now it's just a city that leads to
a<00:06:28.169> field<00:06:28.470> which<00:06:28.740> leads<00:06:29.010> to<00:06:29.130> a<00:06:29.220> bunch<00:06:29.400> of

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:29.550 
a field which leads to a bunch of

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.250 
a field which leads to a bunch of
different<00:06:29.700> instance<00:06:30.210> Maps<00:06:30.419> maybe<00:06:30.960> one<00:06:31.169> of

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:31.260 
different instance Maps maybe one of

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:32.150 
different instance Maps maybe one of
these<00:06:31.350> other<00:06:31.530> games<00:06:31.740> will<00:06:31.979> have<00:06:32.010> an
