I<00:00:26.609> always<00:00:26.849> thought<00:00:27.000> that<00:00:27.060> if<00:00:27.300> it<00:00:27.390> was<00:00:27.510> longer

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
I always thought that if it was longer

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.990 
I always thought that if it was longer
it<00:00:27.960> would<00:00:28.050> make<00:00:28.230> me<00:00:28.380> look<00:00:28.560> like<00:00:28.890> slimmer<00:00:29.460> yeah

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
