registeel idly enough with marks which

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.499 
registeel idly enough with marks which
is<00:00:13.920> actually<00:00:14.070> putting<00:00:14.400> when<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.580> used<00:00:14.790> my<00:00:15.030> team

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
is actually putting when I used my team

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.599 
is actually putting when I used my team
team<00:00:15.780> for<00:00:15.990> a<00:00:16.170> low<00:00:16.350> well<00:00:17.010> I<00:00:17.039> go<00:00:17.190> straight<00:00:17.460> for

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
team for a low well I go straight for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.040 
team for a low well I go straight for
the<00:00:17.670> Thunder<00:00:18.000> because<00:00:18.240> of<00:00:18.390> serene<00:00:18.690> grace<00:00:18.900> and

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
the Thunder because of serene grace and

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.810 
the Thunder because of serene grace and
I<00:00:19.080> have<00:00:19.199> a<00:00:19.230> wide<00:00:19.410> lens<00:00:19.619> too<00:00:19.949> so<00:00:20.369> I'm<00:00:20.490> grantor<00:00:20.789> a

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
I have a wide lens too so I'm grantor a

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.849 
I have a wide lens too so I'm grantor a
paralyzed<00:00:21.750> in<00:00:21.930> which<00:00:22.020> I<00:00:22.109> do<00:00:22.170> through<00:00:22.560> there

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:22.859 
paralyzed in which I do through there

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:24.920 
paralyzed in which I do through there
but<00:00:23.039> he<00:00:23.699> pulls<00:00:23.939> up<00:00:24.060> a<00:00:24.150> tee<00:00:24.300> wave<00:00:24.449> on<00:00:24.630> me<00:00:24.750> as<00:00:24.900> well

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
but he pulls up a tee wave on me as well

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.470 
but he pulls up a tee wave on me as well
so<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.039> guess<00:00:26.490> it's<00:00:26.519> like<00:00:26.699> an<00:00:26.849> even<00:00:27.119> trade<00:00:27.269> off

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
so I guess it's like an even trade off

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:28.730 
so I guess it's like an even trade off
and<00:00:27.510> he<00:00:27.750> has<00:00:27.869> stealth<00:00:28.140> rocks<00:00:28.380> she<00:00:28.470> was<00:00:28.590> kind<00:00:28.710> of

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
and he has stealth rocks she was kind of

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:30.410 
and he has stealth rocks she was kind of
ahead<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:28.980> the<00:00:29.099> game<00:00:29.279> of<00:00:29.460> me<00:00:29.550> if<00:00:30.090> I<00:00:30.150> want<00:00:30.300> to<00:00:30.359> go

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
this thing but I he pulls up a crate so

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.880 
this thing but I he pulls up a crate so
I'm<00:01:30.659> not<00:01:30.810> able<00:01:30.930> to<00:01:31.110> tell<00:01:31.259> if<00:01:31.290> it's<00:01:31.409> actually

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
I'm not able to tell if it's actually

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:34.069 
I'm not able to tell if it's actually
due<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.369> scarf<00:01:32.790> or<00:01:33.060> because<00:01:33.450> it's<00:01:33.600> banded

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
due to the scarf or because it's banded

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.170 
due to the scarf or because it's banded
so<00:01:34.799> that<00:01:35.310> kind<00:01:35.549> of<00:01:35.579> puts<00:01:35.729> me<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:35.970> awkward

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
so that kind of puts me in the awkward

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.149 
so that kind of puts me in the awkward
position<00:01:36.390> i'm<00:01:36.689> thinking<00:01:37.020> it's<00:01:37.110> banded<00:01:37.650> I<00:01:37.829> mean

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159 
position i'm thinking it's banded I mean

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:40.039 
position i'm thinking it's banded I mean
that's<00:01:39.090> this<00:01:39.270> lot<00:01:39.479> of<00:01:39.540> damage<00:01:39.659> i'm<00:01:39.840> going<00:01:39.960> to

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049

hope against the parallax and I go for

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.340 
hope against the parallax and I go for
earthquake<00:01:53.700> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.420> did<00:01:54.600> go<00:01:54.720> 40<00:01:54.990> waivers<00:01:55.290> to

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:55.350 
earthquake if you did go 40 waivers to

a<00:01:57.540> lump<00:01:57.780> berry<00:01:58.020> so<00:01:58.409> I<00:01:58.710> guess<00:01:58.979> that<00:01:59.009> would

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
a lump berry so I guess that would

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.120 
a lump berry so I guess that would
cancel<00:01:59.490> it<00:01:59.610> out<00:02:00.500> but<00:02:01.500> he<00:02:01.710> actually<00:02:01.829> pulled<00:02:02.070> out

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
cancel it out but he actually pulled out

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:03.590 
cancel it out but he actually pulled out
the<00:02:02.219> explosion<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.850> kills<00:02:03.060> up<00:02:03.210> destroyer

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
the explosion and kills up destroyer

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.499 
the explosion and kills up destroyer
here<00:02:03.869> so<00:02:04.200> yep<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.130> got<00:02:05.280> destroyed<00:02:05.850> in<00:02:06.149> that
