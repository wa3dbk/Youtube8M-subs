00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
might be in the next film whether it's

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:58.530 
might be in the next film whether it's
more<00:01:57.280> adult<00:01:57.610> but<00:01:57.730> there's<00:01:57.850> no<00:01:58.000> strip<00:01:58.330> bars

just seems like Hogwarts cherries yeah
that's<00:02:05.800> we<00:02:06.340> found<00:02:06.700> it<00:02:07.480> we've<00:02:08.050> done<00:02:08.350> a<00:02:08.380> lot<00:02:08.740> of

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
that's we found it we've done a lot of

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.250 
that's we found it we've done a lot of
the<00:02:09.040> other<00:02:09.190> parts<00:02:09.610> of<00:02:09.760> the<00:02:09.880> film<00:02:10.119> filming<00:02:10.720> kind

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:11.260 
the other parts of the film filming kind

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:13.740 
the other parts of the film filming kind
of<00:02:11.350> elsewhere<00:02:11.740> so<00:02:12.670> this<00:02:13.120> is<00:02:13.330> gonna<00:02:13.540> have<00:02:13.720> a

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
of elsewhere so this is gonna have a

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:15.090 
of elsewhere so this is gonna have a
very<00:02:13.990> different<00:02:14.290> feel<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.770> this<00:02:14.950> one

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
very different feel to it this one

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:16.200 
very different feel to it this one
because<00:02:15.280> we<00:02:15.370> barely<00:02:15.670> spent<00:02:16.000> any<00:02:16.090> time
