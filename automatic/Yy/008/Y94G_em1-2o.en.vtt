00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:06.009
 Russian millionaire promises immortality 

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:09.520
 through the holographic consciousness 

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:12.280
 for 2045 although it may seem like a 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.860
 science fiction story a millionaire 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.260
 Russian has an ambitious plan to 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.260
 overcome the physical form and achieve 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:22.840
 immortality do not assume anything until 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:25.390
 listen to all the video as it came out 

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:27.940
 a science fiction movie the 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:30.100
 russian millionaire dmitri peskov seeks the 

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.169
 immortality through the union of the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.629
 human consciousness with machines 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:39.670
 project that has funded at least 

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.739
 since 2011 2045 initiative the goal 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:44.019
 end of the project would be to be able 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:45.929
 transfer the mind of a person from a 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.550
 live brain towards a machine 

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.829
 conserving personality and memory 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.469
 intact as if it were a 

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:56.440
 transfer via cloud according to their 

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:58.989
 enthusiastic promoters if the mind is 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.569
 will rid the person of their physical form 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.969
 could exist in a network similar to 

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:07.010
 internet and be able to travel to the 

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:09.890
 speed of light all over the planet 

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.570
 even towards outer space but 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.000
 it's not just about the 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:16.850
 eccentricity of an old millionaire with 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.370
 fear of death itzkoff has a plan 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.250
 very concrete and a timeline that 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:26.690
 continue for the next few years the first 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:29.090
 goal of 2,045 initiative is avatar to the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:31.610
 stage where a person can control 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.890
 a human replica robot through a 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.910
 organic interface brain machine 

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:40.370
 UFO interface for its acronym in English 

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.979
 said technology already exists so its 

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:45.340
 development and improvement should 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:48.860
 Completed approximately in the year 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.140
 2025 when they will enter the avatar stage 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.870
 see here is where things get 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.030
 really interesting because it implies 

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:58.400
 transplant a human brain to a 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:01.070
 artificial body at the end of life of 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.680
 the person how it will be possible to do 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.540
 this is still suspended but for the 

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.170
 moment when the third stage arrives 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:11.510
 in the 2035 avatar is the memory and 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.990
 personality of the person should 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.730
 remain intact in the robot mechanism 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.550
 producing the desired quanbor for 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.740
 get to this point claim will be 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.010
 necessary to create a computer model 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:29.330
 of human consciousness the last stage 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:32.300
 avatar projected for the year 2045 is 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.580
 the most ambitious of all is expected 

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:36.590
 that by this point the physical interface 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.810
 is irrelevant so the 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:41.330
 human personalities saved from the 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.940
 death and the flesh could manifest 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:46.490
 in the form of holograms and live in shape 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:49.370
 of information in a space similar to 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.950
 internet today probably itzkoff has 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:54.620
 I've been reading many Isaacs novels 

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:57.230
 asimov or the possibility of an island of 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.660
 michel houellebecq however we must 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.270
 remember that what in the past sounded 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.730
 like foolishness call yourself travels in 

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.340
 plane artificial satellites 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.920
 even organ transplants or the 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.160
 Internet today are part of our 

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.410
 everyday life who knows maybe the 

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:17.690
 Next step in the evolution of man 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:21.490
 on the planet seriously be towards the 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:21.490
 overcoming the physical form
