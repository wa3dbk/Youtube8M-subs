zoomed in on the last time a possible

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.120 
zoomed in on the last time a possible
connection<00:00:15.210> here<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:15.929> where<00:00:16.920> they<00:00:17.070> were

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
connection here is where they were

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:19.010 
connection here is where they were
putting<00:00:17.490> in<00:00:17.670> those<00:00:17.820> power<00:00:18.119> lines<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.720> I<00:00:18.810> kind

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.020 
putting in those power lines and I kind

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:20.900 
putting in those power lines and I kind
of<00:00:19.080> want<00:00:19.260> to<00:00:19.350> as<00:00:19.560> you've<00:00:20.100> been<00:00:20.130> looking<00:00:20.820> at

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
of want to as you've been looking at

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.519 
of want to as you've been looking at
where<00:00:21.060> this<00:00:21.330> transmission<00:00:22.020> line<00:00:22.050> where<00:00:22.439> this

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
where this transmission line where this

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.609 
where this transmission line where this
rupture<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.480> you<00:00:24.480> also<00:00:24.660> showed<00:00:25.050> some<00:00:25.289> line

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
rupture is you also showed some line

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:27.470 
rupture is you also showed some line
some<00:00:25.980> of<00:00:26.070> those<00:00:26.130> power<00:00:26.400> poles<00:00:26.760> going<00:00:27.029> in<00:00:27.300> and

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
some of those power poles going in and

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.540 
some of those power poles going in and
it<00:00:27.570> almost<00:00:27.720> looks<00:00:28.080> look<00:00:28.289> like<00:00:28.619> that<00:00:29.010> lines<00:00:29.279> up

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
it almost looks look like that lines up

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.669 
it almost looks look like that lines up
a<00:00:29.670> little<00:00:29.849> bit<00:00:30.060> there's<00:00:30.630> a<00:00:30.720> we<00:00:31.380> have<00:00:31.529> an

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
a little bit there's a we have an

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.479 
a little bit there's a we have an
unconfirmed<00:00:31.890> report<00:00:32.579> coming<00:00:33.390> out<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.690> the

00:00:34.479 --> 00:00:34.489 
unconfirmed report coming out of the

00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:36.680 
unconfirmed report coming out of the
fire<00:00:35.489> department<00:00:35.969> working<00:00:36.239> on<00:00:36.360> this<00:00:36.480> that

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
fire department working on this that

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.380 
fire department working on this that
maybe<00:00:37.050> the<00:00:37.620> digging<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.309> those<00:00:38.610> power<00:00:38.940> poles

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:39.390 
maybe the digging of those power poles

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.810 
maybe the digging of those power poles
they're<00:00:39.629> quite<00:00:40.050> bigger<00:00:41.010> quite<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> bit<00:00:41.640> bigger

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
they're quite bigger quite a bit bigger

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.000 
they're quite bigger quite a bit bigger
than<00:00:42.000> those<00:00:42.300> wooden<00:00:42.719> poles<00:00:43.559> that<00:00:43.770> are<00:00:43.890> out

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:44.010 
than those wooden poles that are out

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.069 
than those wooden poles that are out
there<00:00:44.040> might<00:00:44.940> be<00:00:44.969> along<00:00:45.390> that<00:00:45.600> transmission

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
there might be along that transmission

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:48.200 
there might be along that transmission
line<00:00:46.440> and<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.800> don't<00:00:46.860> know<00:00:47.100> if<00:00:47.250> you<00:00:47.370> as<00:00:47.760> you<00:00:48.000> give

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
line and I don't know if you as you give

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:49.729 
line and I don't know if you as you give
us<00:00:48.239> that<00:00:48.480> perspective<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.140> think<00:00:49.350> as<00:00:49.440> you<00:00:49.559> went

00:00:49.729 --> 00:00:49.739 
us that perspective I think as you went

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:51.260 
us that perspective I think as you went
to<00:00:49.829> the<00:00:49.920> left<00:00:50.129> here<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> little<00:00:50.520> bit<00:00:50.700> there<00:00:50.910> was

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
to the left here a little bit there was

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:52.970 
to the left here a little bit there was
one<00:00:51.539> lying<00:00:51.840> on<00:00:51.989> its<00:00:52.140> side<00:00:52.199> that<00:00:52.530> was<00:00:52.620> about<00:00:52.829> to

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
one lying on its side that was about to

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.439 
one lying on its side that was about to
be<00:00:53.100> put<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.460> or<00:00:53.610> something<00:00:53.879> like<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.329> it

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
be put up or something like that and it

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.689 
be put up or something like that and it
almost<00:00:54.600> looks<00:00:54.960> like<00:00:55.110> those<00:00:55.260> are<00:00:55.289> running<00:00:55.770> yeah

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
almost looks like those are running yeah

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.310 
almost looks like those are running yeah
right<00:00:57.090> on<00:00:57.239> that<00:00:57.360> transmission<00:00:57.899> yeah

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
right on that transmission yeah

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.950 
right on that transmission yeah
absolutely<00:00:58.530> and<00:00:59.100> you<00:01:00.059> know<00:01:00.090> obviously<00:01:00.780> we're

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
absolutely and you know obviously we're

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.270 
absolutely and you know obviously we're
speculating<00:01:01.199> so<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.800> don't<00:01:01.949> really<00:01:02.100> know

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
speculating so we don't really know

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.250 
speculating so we don't really know
exactly<00:01:02.430> what's<00:01:02.940> going<00:01:03.120> on<00:01:03.270> there<00:01:03.480> but<00:01:03.660> you

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
exactly what's going on there but you

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.500 
exactly what's going on there but you
can<00:01:04.409> see<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.799> right<00:01:05.070> here<00:01:05.330> where<00:01:06.330> these

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:06.510 
can see this right here where these

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.219 
can see this right here where these
trucks<00:01:06.869> are<00:01:07.080> burned<00:01:07.470> up<00:01:07.619> that<00:01:07.939> clearly<00:01:08.939> is<00:01:09.060> a

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:09.229 
trucks are burned up that clearly is a

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.859 
trucks are burned up that clearly is a
powerline<00:01:10.430> pole<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.700> power<00:01:12.000> pole<00:01:12.210> being<00:01:12.450> put<00:01:12.689> in

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
powerline pole a power pole being put in

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:15.700 
powerline pole a power pole being put in
right<00:01:13.590> to<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> right<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.159> that<00:01:14.280> is<00:01:14.549> this

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:15.710 
right to the right of that is this

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:17.749 
right to the right of that is this
transmission<00:01:16.710> area<00:01:16.979> one<00:01:17.250> of<00:01:17.369> the<00:01:17.460> you<00:01:17.729> know

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
transmission area one of the you know

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:21.530 
transmission area one of the you know
the<00:01:19.520> and<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> last<00:01:20.820> forwards<00:01:21.150> but<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.390> of<00:01:21.420> the

the and the last forwards but one of the
transmission<00:01:21.990> areas<00:01:22.259> for<00:01:22.439> powers<00:01:22.740> where<00:01:22.920> they

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
transmission areas for powers where they

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.340 
transmission areas for powers where they
you<00:01:23.430> know<00:01:23.460> supply<00:01:23.820> the<00:01:23.880> area<00:01:24.330> as<00:01:24.479> I<00:01:24.930> go<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> the

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
other end of that but as as we can see

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
other end of that but as as we can see
there's<00:02:00.060> definitely<00:02:00.240> some<00:02:00.600> work<00:02:00.780> there<00:02:00.990> where

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
there's definitely some work there where

those trucks are burned out or those
tractors<00:02:03.540> are<00:02:04.729> definitely<00:02:05.729> they're<00:02:05.909> putting

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
tractors are definitely they're putting

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.700 
tractors are definitely they're putting
up<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.420> power<00:02:06.630> pole<00:02:06.869> right<00:02:07.049> there<00:02:07.079> you<00:02:07.409> can<00:02:07.530> see

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
up a power pole right there you can see

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.290 
up a power pole right there you can see
it<00:02:07.860> you<00:02:08.190> can<00:02:08.220> see<00:02:08.489> what<00:02:08.610> those<00:02:08.759> bucket<00:02:09.090> trucks

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
it you can see what those bucket trucks

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.639 
it you can see what those bucket trucks
are<00:02:09.479> you're<00:02:09.690> putting<00:02:09.929> up<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.110> brand<00:02:10.319> new<00:02:10.379> power

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:10.649 
are you're putting up a brand new power

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:13.760 
are you're putting up a brand new power
pole<00:02:10.920> so<00:02:11.190> it<00:02:11.370> may<00:02:12.239> be<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> coincidental

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
pole so it may be just coincidental

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.380 
pole so it may be just coincidental
or<00:02:14.310> it<00:02:14.400> may<00:02:14.490> be<00:02:14.550> something<00:02:14.820> else<00:02:15.030> we<00:02:15.240> don't

move around into the area of where the
actual<00:03:13.110> fireball<00:03:13.440> was<00:03:13.910> and<00:03:14.910> there's<00:03:15.090> also

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
actual fireball was and there's also

there<00:03:24.840> but<00:03:24.870> there<00:03:25.110> are<00:03:25.140> a<00:03:25.260> lot<00:03:25.320> of<00:03:25.440> trees<00:03:25.800> and

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:25.830 
there but there are a lot of trees and

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:29.030 
there but there are a lot of trees and
tall<00:03:26.310> brush<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:27.270> have<00:03:27.480> been<00:03:28.350> on<00:03:28.500> fire<00:03:28.770> so

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
tall brush that have been on fire so

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.470 
tall brush that have been on fire so
they're<00:03:29.190> putting<00:03:29.460> out<00:03:29.490> those<00:03:29.730> fires<00:03:29.970> as<00:03:30.210> we

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
they're putting out those fires as we

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:33.140 
they're putting out those fires as we
speak<00:03:30.780> but<00:03:31.710> right<00:03:31.920> now<00:03:32.040> we<00:03:32.100> have<00:03:32.430> seen<00:03:32.880> some

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
speak but right now we have seen some

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.150 
speak but right now we have seen some
people<00:03:33.300> move<00:03:33.630> into<00:03:33.810> the<00:03:33.990> actual<00:03:34.380> scene<00:03:34.650> you

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
people move into the actual scene you

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:36.710 
people move into the actual scene you
can<00:03:35.310> see<00:03:35.340> where<00:03:35.610> that<00:03:35.760> pole<00:03:36.000> was<00:03:36.300> into<00:03:36.570> where

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
can see where that pole was into where

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.630 
can see where that pole was into where
the<00:03:36.840> the<00:03:37.230> gas<00:03:37.440> line<00:03:37.710> was<00:03:37.920> where<00:03:38.130> that<00:03:38.220> fireball

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
the the gas line was where that fireball

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.460 
the the gas line was where that fireball
was<00:03:38.880> next<00:03:39.480> to<00:03:39.600> it<00:03:39.690> looks<00:03:39.840> like<00:03:39.990> some<00:03:40.170> type<00:03:40.440> of

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
was next to it looks like some type of

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.560 
was next to it looks like some type of
excavation<00:03:41.040> machine<00:03:41.640> that<00:03:41.820> was<00:03:41.940> there<00:03:42.150> they

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:42.570 
excavation machine that was there they

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:43.670 
excavation machine that was there they
were<00:03:42.630> checking<00:03:42.930> that<00:03:43.140> out<00:03:43.200> looking

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
were checking that out looking

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.590 
were checking that out looking
underneath<00:03:43.920> it<00:03:44.220> so<00:03:44.970> there<00:03:45.090> are<00:03:45.120> people<00:03:45.360> moving

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:45.600 
underneath it so there are people moving

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:47.660 
underneath it so there are people moving
in<00:03:45.840> to<00:03:45.960> see<00:03:46.320> what's<00:03:46.500> going<00:03:46.680> on<00:03:46.830> in<00:03:46.950> there<00:03:47.100> right

in the area earlier they were looking as

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.400 
in the area earlier they were looking as
i<00:04:03.210> zoom<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.570> this<00:04:03.720> you're<00:04:03.930> looking<00:04:04.200> basically

i zoom in this you're looking basically

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.910 
i zoom in this you're looking basically
at<00:04:04.770> Ground<00:04:05.130> Zero<00:04:05.370> where<00:04:05.520> this<00:04:05.640> blast<00:04:05.910> was<00:04:06.920> we

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:07.920 
at Ground Zero where this blast was we

00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.310 
at Ground Zero where this blast was we
can<00:04:08.100> see<00:04:08.280> kind<00:04:08.460> of<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.670> pipe<00:04:08.910> right<00:04:09.120> there<00:04:09.320> just

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
can see kind of a pipe right there just

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:11.690 
can see kind of a pipe right there just
underneath<00:04:10.770> where<00:04:10.980> that<00:04:11.100> little<00:04:11.250> ditch<00:04:11.520> is

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
underneath where that little ditch is

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.400 
underneath where that little ditch is
that's<00:04:11.910> where<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.240> gas<00:04:12.510> line<00:04:12.810> was<00:04:12.840> and<00:04:13.320> it

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:13.410 
that's where that gas line was and it

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:15.380 
that's where that gas line was and it
looked<00:04:13.709> like<00:04:13.830> it<00:04:13.950> had<00:04:14.070> been<00:04:14.100> split<00:04:14.430> open<00:04:14.850> just

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
looked like it had been split open just

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:16.789 
looked like it had been split open just
to<00:04:15.480> the<00:04:15.630> left<00:04:15.780> of<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.080> there's<00:04:16.290> an<00:04:16.410> auger<00:04:16.680> bit

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
to the left of that there's an auger bit

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.890 
to the left of that there's an auger bit
from<00:04:17.250> a<00:04:17.340> drill<00:04:17.640> don't<00:04:18.299> know<00:04:18.450> if<00:04:18.540> that's<00:04:18.720> what

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:18.900 
from a drill don't know if that's what

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.990 
from a drill don't know if that's what
was<00:04:19.080> used<00:04:19.500> but<00:04:19.950> it's<00:04:20.370> pretty<00:04:20.640> close<00:04:20.790> to<00:04:20.850> the

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
was used but it's pretty close to the

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.610 
was used but it's pretty close to the
scene<00:04:21.299> and<00:04:21.510> probably<00:04:22.140> when<00:04:22.260> they<00:04:22.350> were<00:04:22.410> using

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
scene and probably when they were using

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.440 
scene and probably when they were using
digging<00:04:23.340> equipment<00:04:23.729> this<00:04:23.790> was<00:04:23.970> part<00:04:24.210> of<00:04:24.330> it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
digging equipment this was part of it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.210 
digging equipment this was part of it
also<00:04:24.870> right<00:04:25.290> to<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.530> right<00:04:25.650> of<00:04:25.710> it<00:04:25.919> looks<00:04:26.070> like

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:26.220 
also right to the right of it looks like

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:26.950 
also right to the right of it looks like
some<00:04:26.430> kind<00:04:26.640> of

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:26.960 
some kind of

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:29.050 
some kind of
excavation<00:04:27.440> equipment<00:04:28.060> completely

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:29.060 
excavation equipment completely

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:30.670 
excavation equipment completely
destroyed<00:04:29.660> right<00:04:29.810> there<00:04:30.020> you<00:04:30.199> can<00:04:30.350> see<00:04:30.500> that

00:04:30.670 --> 00:04:30.680 
destroyed right there you can see that

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.439 
destroyed right there you can see that
and<00:04:30.919> we<00:04:31.250> had<00:04:31.430> some<00:04:31.610> people<00:04:31.729> out<00:04:31.940> here<00:04:32.090> earlier

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:32.449 
and we had some people out here earlier

00:04:32.449 --> 00:04:34.300 
and we had some people out here earlier
looking<00:04:32.780> underneath<00:04:33.080> that<00:04:33.380> checking<00:04:33.800> for<00:04:34.039> you

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:34.310 
looking underneath that checking for you

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.010 
looking underneath that checking for you
know<00:04:34.490> possibly<00:04:34.970> what<00:04:35.210> happened<00:04:35.569> see<00:04:35.840> if<00:04:35.900> they

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:36.020 
know possibly what happened see if they

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:38.559 
know possibly what happened see if they

here<00:04:44.210> that<00:04:45.080> was<00:04:45.229> burning<00:04:45.470> I'm<00:04:45.650> not<00:04:45.770> exactly

00:04:45.999 --> 00:04:46.009 
here that was burning I'm not exactly

00:04:46.009 --> 00:04:47.710 
here that was burning I'm not exactly
sure<00:04:46.160> what<00:04:46.490> that<00:04:46.520> is<00:04:46.729> they're<00:04:47.090> out<00:04:47.539> there

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:47.720

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:49.400 
spraying some water on that so we

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:50.920 
spraying some water on that so we
definitely<00:04:49.610> have<00:04:50.000> people<00:04:50.180> that<00:04:50.509> are<00:04:50.660> on<00:04:50.780> the

definitely have people that are on the

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:52.570 
definitely have people that are on the
scene<00:04:51.169> now<00:04:51.380> moving<00:04:51.800> into<00:04:52.009> the<00:04:52.099> scene<00:04:52.280> is<00:04:52.430> it

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:52.580 
scene now moving into the scene is it

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.249 
scene now moving into the scene is it
and<00:04:52.819> it<00:04:53.060> settles<00:04:53.419> down<00:04:53.539> a<00:04:53.599> little<00:04:53.810> bit<00:04:53.960> cools

00:04:54.249 --> 00:04:54.259 
and it settles down a little bit cools

00:04:54.259 --> 00:04:56.409 
and it settles down a little bit cools
off<00:04:54.500> they<00:04:55.099> also<00:04:55.340> have<00:04:55.699> people<00:04:55.970> around<00:04:56.330> the

00:04:56.409 --> 00:04:56.419 
off they also have people around the

00:04:56.419 --> 00:04:58.029 
off they also have people around the
perimeter<00:04:56.810> there<00:04:56.960> were<00:04:57.050> several<00:04:57.380> grass<00:04:57.740> fires

00:04:58.029 --> 00:04:58.039 
perimeter there were several grass fires

00:04:58.039 --> 00:04:59.920 
perimeter there were several grass fires
several<00:04:58.430> big<00:04:58.729> pretty<00:04:59.090> good-sized<00:04:59.660> grass

fires burning they have put most of

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:03.370 
fires burning they have put most of
those<00:05:01.880> out<00:05:02.060> at<00:05:02.300> this<00:05:02.419> point<00:05:02.630> so<00:05:02.750> the<00:05:02.870> smoke<00:05:03.229> is

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
those out at this point so the smoke is

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.719 
those out at this point so the smoke is
died<00:05:03.560> down<00:05:03.710> is<00:05:03.949> starting<00:05:04.190> to<00:05:04.250> cool<00:05:04.430> down<00:05:04.610> and

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:06.440 
we do have people on scene I want to

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:08.290 
we do have people on scene I want to

for several hours and Michael both of us

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:14.469 
for several hours and Michael both of us
together<00:05:12.080> kind<00:05:12.919> of<00:05:13.039> discovered<00:05:13.610> that<00:05:13.759> twisted

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:14.479 
together kind of discovered that twisted

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.450 
together kind of discovered that twisted
what<00:05:15.050> we<00:05:15.169> called<00:05:15.380> a<00:05:15.500> pole<00:05:15.740> sitter<00:05:16.099> you<00:05:16.160> see<00:05:16.370> the

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:16.460 
what we called a pole sitter you see the

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:17.800 
what we called a pole sitter you see the
auger<00:05:16.639> on<00:05:16.789> the<00:05:16.970> back<00:05:17.120> of<00:05:17.270> this<00:05:17.330> one<00:05:17.389> you're

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:17.810 
auger on the back of this one you're

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.060 
auger on the back of this one you're
gonna<00:05:17.870> do<00:05:18.050> look<00:05:18.199> comparison<00:05:18.710> of<00:05:18.830> kind<00:05:19.009> of

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
gonna do look comparison of kind of

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.279 
gonna do look comparison of kind of
before<00:05:19.520> and<00:05:19.909> after<00:05:20.030> we<00:05:20.330> think<00:05:20.599> the<00:05:20.780> the<00:05:21.080> one

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:21.289 
before and after we think the the one

00:05:21.289 --> 00:05:23.529 
before and after we think the the one
that<00:05:21.470> was<00:05:21.620> responsible<00:05:22.580> potentially<00:05:23.360> for

00:05:23.529 --> 00:05:23.539 
that was responsible potentially for

00:05:23.539 --> 00:05:26.469 
that was responsible potentially for
clipping<00:05:24.139> this<00:05:24.440> this<00:05:24.889> line<00:05:25.280> looks<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.300> lot

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
clipping this this line looks a lot

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:27.909 
clipping this this line looks a lot
different<00:05:26.509> than<00:05:26.960> this<00:05:27.229> one<00:05:27.289> which<00:05:27.680> is<00:05:27.740> the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:27.919 
different than this one which is the

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:31.689 
different than this one which is the
before<00:05:28.400> picture<00:05:28.759> right<00:05:28.940> go<00:05:29.120> ahead<00:05:30.699> clearly

before picture right go ahead clearly
that's<00:05:31.909> interrupts

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
that's interrupts

sitting there so hang on I'm gonna zoom

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.620 
sitting there so hang on I'm gonna zoom
way<00:05:36.229> over<00:05:36.470> here<00:05:36.710> it's<00:05:36.919> probably<00:05:37.310> about<00:05:37.630> three

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:38.630 
way over here it's probably about three

00:05:38.630 --> 00:05:40.029 
way over here it's probably about three

we're<00:05:40.190> gonna<00:05:40.280> zoom<00:05:40.580> it<00:05:40.789> to<00:05:41.360> the<00:05:41.509> truck<00:05:41.750> that<00:05:41.870> we

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960 
we're gonna zoom it to the truck that we

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.240 
we're gonna zoom it to the truck that we
believe<00:05:42.229> may<00:05:42.259> have<00:05:42.469> been<00:05:42.560> involved<00:05:43.070> in

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
believe may have been involved in

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.040 
believe may have been involved in
setting<00:05:43.759> off<00:05:43.940> this<00:05:44.120> explosion<00:05:44.539> as<00:05:44.750> you<00:05:44.870> look

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:45.050 
setting off this explosion as you look

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.050 
setting off this explosion as you look
at<00:05:45.169> that<00:05:45.289> that<00:05:45.919> truck<00:05:46.460> that<00:05:46.580> we<00:05:46.669> just<00:05:46.849> saw<00:05:47.030> a

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
at that that truck that we just saw a

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.760 
at that that truck that we just saw a
second<00:05:47.449> ago<00:05:47.630> is<00:05:47.810> the<00:05:47.930> exact<00:05:48.259> same<00:05:48.469> one<00:05:48.620> that

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:48.770 
second ago is the exact same one that

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.170 
second ago is the exact same one that
you're<00:05:48.889> looking<00:05:49.190> at<00:05:49.310> right<00:05:49.460> here<00:05:49.520> this<00:05:49.909> end<00:05:50.090> is

00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:50.180 
you're looking at right here this end is

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.330 
you're looking at right here this end is
just<00:05:50.360> a<00:05:50.449> pile<00:05:50.690> of<00:05:50.719> rubble<00:05:50.930> completely<00:05:51.860> melted

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.340 
just a pile of rubble completely melted

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.770 
just a pile of rubble completely melted
and<00:05:52.759> then<00:05:52.909> right<00:05:53.060> above<00:05:53.270> that<00:05:53.330> you<00:05:53.599> can<00:05:53.630> see

00:05:53.770 --> 00:05:53.780 
and then right above that you can see

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.170 
and then right above that you can see
the<00:05:54.050> pole<00:05:54.320> that<00:05:54.620> we<00:05:54.979> believe<00:05:55.250> piers<00:05:55.520> that<00:05:55.580> that

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:56.180 
the pole that we believe piers that that

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.719 
the pole that we believe piers that that
pipe<00:05:56.509> line<00:05:56.780> and<00:05:57.289> then<00:05:57.469> you<00:05:57.800> know<00:05:57.889> clearly<00:05:58.580> they

00:05:58.719 --> 00:05:58.729 
pipe line and then you know clearly they

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:00.040 
pipe line and then you know clearly they
that's<00:05:59.120> what<00:05:59.300> they<00:05:59.389> were<00:05:59.449> doing<00:05:59.719> it<00:05:59.810> as<00:05:59.900> i<00:06:00.020> zoom

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
that's what they were doing it as i zoom

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.749 
that's what they were doing it as i zoom
in<00:06:00.440> you<00:06:00.590> can<00:06:00.620> see<00:06:00.949> where<00:06:01.099> that<00:06:01.190> pipe<00:06:01.490> line

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:01.759 
in you can see where that pipe line

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.760 
in you can see where that pipe line
where<00:06:02.180> that<00:06:02.210> pole<00:06:02.509> was<00:06:02.659> put<00:06:02.840> in<00:06:02.990> and<00:06:03.199> that<00:06:03.229> pipe

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:03.770 
where that pole was put in and that pipe

00:06:03.770 --> 00:06:05.649 
where that pole was put in and that pipe
line<00:06:03.949> just<00:06:04.130> completely<00:06:04.669> split<00:06:05.060> apart<00:06:05.330> and

00:06:05.649 --> 00:06:05.659 
line just completely split apart and

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.659 
line just completely split apart and
it's<00:06:05.870> pretty<00:06:06.229> amazing<00:06:06.500> the<00:06:06.800> power<00:06:07.190> of<00:06:07.370> the

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
it's pretty amazing the power of the

setter truck and the pole and now we

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.999 
setter truck and the pole and now we
learn<00:06:59.659> of<00:06:59.689> course<00:07:00.020> that<00:07:00.349> pole<00:07:00.560> may<00:07:00.680> appears

00:07:00.999 --> 00:07:01.009 
learn of course that pole may appears
