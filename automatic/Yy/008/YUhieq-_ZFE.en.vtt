00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:08.750 
hey what's up guys this is blackout cat

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.690 
hey what's up guys this is blackout cat
in<00:00:09.020> today's<00:00:09.740> video<00:00:10.100> we're<00:00:10.430> going<00:00:10.520> to<00:00:10.610> be

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:10.700 
in today's video we're going to be

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.190 
in today's video we're going to be
looking<00:00:10.790> at<00:00:11.000> the<00:00:11.150> differences<00:00:11.570> between<00:00:11.750> using

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:12.200 
looking at the differences between using

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.170 
looking at the differences between using
the<00:00:12.500> standard<00:00:13.010> internal<00:00:13.370> drive<00:00:13.670> and<00:00:13.910> an<00:00:13.969> Xbox

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:14.180 
the standard internal drive and an Xbox

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:16.980 
the standard internal drive and an Xbox
one<00:00:14.629> versus<00:00:15.440> using<00:00:15.860> an<00:00:15.949> external<00:00:16.309> drive<00:00:16.580> I

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:16.990 
one versus using an external drive I

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:19.330 
one versus using an external drive I
went<00:00:17.990> ahead<00:00:18.050> and<00:00:18.470> did<00:00:18.590> a<00:00:18.650> couple<00:00:18.830> of<00:00:19.100> tests

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:19.340 
went ahead and did a couple of tests

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:22.359 
went ahead and did a couple of tests
where<00:00:19.730> I<00:00:20.170> recorded<00:00:21.170> and<00:00:21.410> time<00:00:21.680> the<00:00:22.070> amount<00:00:22.250> of

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:22.369 
where I recorded and time the amount of

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:23.890 
where I recorded and time the amount of
time<00:00:22.429> it<00:00:22.730> takes<00:00:22.849> to<00:00:23.119> get<00:00:23.240> to<00:00:23.539> different

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:23.900 
time it takes to get to different

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.900 
time it takes to get to different
loading<00:00:24.320> screens<00:00:24.650> or<00:00:24.890> in<00:00:25.039> the<00:00:25.279> actual<00:00:25.609> game

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
loading screens or in the actual game

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:28.630 
loading screens or in the actual game
for<00:00:26.570> destiny<00:00:27.019> and<00:00:27.349> watchdogs<00:00:27.919> and<00:00:28.279> titanfall

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:28.640 
for destiny and watchdogs and titanfall

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.359 
for destiny and watchdogs and titanfall
and<00:00:28.970> titles<00:00:29.300> like<00:00:29.449> that<00:00:29.720> and<00:00:30.130> then<00:00:31.130> it<00:00:31.220> went

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:31.369 
and titles like that and then it went

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.160 
and titles like that and then it went
back<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:31.609> I<00:00:31.939> put<00:00:32.329> those<00:00:32.450> games<00:00:32.780> on<00:00:33.050> my

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:33.170 
back and I put those games on my

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.380 
back and I put those games on my
external<00:00:33.500> drive<00:00:33.740> and<00:00:34.250> did<00:00:35.000> the<00:00:35.120> same<00:00:35.329> thing

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:35.390 
external drive and did the same thing

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:37.810 
external drive and did the same thing
and<00:00:35.960> I<00:00:36.620> notice<00:00:37.010> that<00:00:37.040> there's<00:00:37.340> actually<00:00:37.790> a

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:37.820 
and I notice that there's actually a

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.540 
and I notice that there's actually a
tangible<00:00:38.540> speed<00:00:38.990> difference<00:00:39.470> between<00:00:40.220> using

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:40.550 
tangible speed difference between using

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:41.920 
tangible speed difference between using
the<00:00:40.580> internal<00:00:41.030> drive<00:00:41.240> and<00:00:41.450> the<00:00:41.510> external

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:41.930 
the internal drive and the external

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:43.870 
the internal drive and the external
drive<00:00:42.160> so<00:00:43.160> I'm<00:00:43.220> going<00:00:43.340> to<00:00:43.370> go<00:00:43.460> ahead<00:00:43.520> and<00:00:43.700> show

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:43.880 
drive so I'm going to go ahead and show

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.150 
drive so I'm going to go ahead and show
you<00:00:43.940> the<00:00:44.360> different<00:00:44.810> tests<00:00:45.050> that<00:00:45.170> I<00:00:45.230> did<00:00:45.470> the

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
you the different tests that I did the

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.160 
you the different tests that I did the
first<00:00:46.370> run-through<00:00:46.790> is<00:00:47.090> going<00:00:47.510> to<00:00:47.630> be<00:00:47.810> with

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:48.170 
first run-through is going to be with

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:49.840 
first run-through is going to be with
the<00:00:48.290> internal<00:00:48.740> drive<00:00:48.920> just<00:00:49.160> a<00:00:49.310> standard<00:00:49.640> drive

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:49.850 
the internal drive just a standard drive

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:52.420 
the internal drive just a standard drive
and<00:00:50.090> your<00:00:50.180> Xbox<00:00:50.570> one<00:00:50.840> and<00:00:51.110> then<00:00:51.740> once<00:00:52.340> that

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:52.430 
and your Xbox one and then once that

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.860 
and your Xbox one and then once that
gets<00:00:52.760> to<00:00:52.880> a<00:00:52.910> certain<00:00:53.000> point<00:00:53.270> I'm<00:00:53.690> going<00:00:53.810> to

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:53.870 
gets to a certain point I'm going to

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.870 
gets to a certain point I'm going to
pause<00:00:54.050> it<00:00:54.290> show<00:00:54.530> the<00:00:54.650> time<00:00:54.890> and<00:00:55.160> then<00:00:55.670> we<00:00:55.760> do

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:55.880 
pause it show the time and then we do

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:58.360 
pause it show the time and then we do
the<00:00:55.970> same<00:00:56.240> thing<00:00:56.660> but<00:00:57.290> except<00:00:57.710> that<00:00:57.950> the<00:00:58.100> game

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:58.370 
the same thing but except that the game

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.610 
the same thing but except that the game
is<00:00:58.640> on<00:00:58.790> the<00:00:58.940> external<00:00:59.660> drive<00:00:59.870> and<00:01:00.080> you're

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:00.620 
is on the external drive and you're

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.320 
is on the external drive and you're
going<00:01:00.800> to<00:01:00.860> notice<00:01:01.220> some<00:01:01.550> speed<00:01:01.850> differences

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:02.330 
going to notice some speed differences

00:01:02.330 --> 00:02:08.010 
going to notice some speed differences
so<00:01:03.260> let's<00:01:03.290> go<00:01:03.500> ahead<00:01:03.650> and<00:01:03.770> take<00:01:03.860> a<00:01:03.890> look

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:08.020 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:03:41.110 

you

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.120 

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:43.670 

so<00:03:42.120> as<00:03:42.239> you<00:03:42.360> can<00:03:42.450> clearly<00:03:42.599> see<00:03:42.840> using<00:03:43.590> the

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
so as you can clearly see using the

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.649 
so as you can clearly see using the
external<00:03:43.980> drive<00:03:44.310> gives<00:03:44.909> you<00:03:45.030> a<00:03:45.060> significant

00:03:45.649 --> 00:03:45.659 
external drive gives you a significant

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:48.530 
external drive gives you a significant
speed<00:03:45.840> boost<00:03:46.140> it's<00:03:46.860> not<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.040> massive<00:03:47.519> gain<00:03:47.760> but

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
speed boost it's not a massive gain but

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.750 
speed boost it's not a massive gain but
you<00:03:48.720> know<00:03:48.840> it<00:03:49.140> is<00:03:49.290> 17<00:03:49.829> seconds<00:03:50.310> shaved<00:03:50.549> off

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
you know it is 17 seconds shaved off

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.130 
you know it is 17 seconds shaved off
your<00:03:50.790> loading<00:03:51.269> times<00:03:51.480> from<00:03:51.780> hitting<00:03:51.989> that

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
your loading times from hitting that

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:53.449 
your loading times from hitting that
play<00:03:52.349> button<00:03:52.590> all<00:03:52.860> the<00:03:52.980> way<00:03:53.069> till<00:03:53.250> getting

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
play button all the way till getting

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.430 
play button all the way till getting
into<00:03:53.610> the<00:03:53.700> game<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.060> that's<00:03:54.959> across<00:03:55.200> the<00:03:55.260> board

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
into the game so that's across the board

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:57.319 
into the game so that's across the board
I<00:03:55.799> mean<00:03:56.280> each<00:03:56.370> loading<00:03:56.730> screen<00:03:57.000> is<00:03:57.030> going<00:03:57.269> to

00:03:57.319 --> 00:03:57.329 
I mean each loading screen is going to

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.210 
I mean each loading screen is going to
be<00:03:57.450> slightly<00:03:57.659> quicker<00:03:58.019> it<00:03:58.680> all<00:03:58.860> kind<00:03:59.040> of<00:03:59.069> adds

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
be slightly quicker it all kind of adds

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.979 
be slightly quicker it all kind of adds
up<00:03:59.459> just<00:03:59.700> getting<00:03:59.970> into<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.299> game<00:04:00.450> faster

00:04:00.979 --> 00:04:00.989 
up just getting into the game faster

00:04:00.989 --> 00:05:11.140 
up just getting into the game faster
let's<00:04:01.950> take<00:04:02.160> a<00:04:02.190> look<00:04:02.430> at<00:04:02.519> another<00:04:02.609> test

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.850 

so<00:05:12.150> as<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.420> can<00:05:12.540> see<00:05:12.600> yet<00:05:13.050> again<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.470> external

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:13.860 
so as you can see yet again the external

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.820 
so as you can see yet again the external
drive<00:05:13.980> is<00:05:14.070> faster<00:05:14.900> you<00:05:15.900> may<00:05:16.050> notice<00:05:16.380> that<00:05:16.410> it's

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:16.830 
drive is faster you may notice that it's

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:18.710 
drive is faster you may notice that it's
not<00:05:17.040> a<00:05:17.070> huge<00:05:17.460> gap<00:05:17.700> this<00:05:17.970> time<00:05:18.180> around<00:05:18.390> it's

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
not a huge gap this time around it's

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.690 
not a huge gap this time around it's
only<00:05:18.840> about<00:05:19.050> four<00:05:19.380> seconds<00:05:19.830> but<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.400> think<00:05:20.610> the

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:20.700 
only about four seconds but I think the

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:22.730 
only about four seconds but I think the
difference<00:05:20.850> between<00:05:21.330> destiny<00:05:22.140> and<00:05:22.350> this<00:05:22.500> game

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
difference between destiny and this game

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.070 
difference between destiny and this game
is<00:05:22.950> that<00:05:23.610> in<00:05:23.790> destiny<00:05:24.210> I<00:05:24.240> went<00:05:24.540> all<00:05:24.750> the<00:05:24.990> way

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:25.080 
is that in destiny I went all the way

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:27.080 
is that in destiny I went all the way
through<00:05:25.320> the<00:05:25.440> game<00:05:25.470> all<00:05:25.830> the<00:05:26.340> way<00:05:26.460> till<00:05:26.760> I<00:05:26.820> was

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:27.090

actually has a 7200 rpm so it's pretty

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.820
