00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.310
 to 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.080
 there can not be a video game channel 

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.630
 without talking about one of the characters more 

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:15.370
 important of video games in this 

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.470
 video I will tell you how a 

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.880
 character that would mark the story in the 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:20.880
 mario industry 

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:29.720
 for this you have to go back in time 

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:31.730
 until 1975 in the industry of the 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.040
 video games the art games were very 

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.590
 popular at the time and one of the 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.510
 Most popular was fuck manita 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.880
 but a small video game company 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.740
 called nintendo decided to enter the 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.650
 competition creating a few games 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:48.020
 shark is one of which was radars 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.640
 code created by a small team of 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.470
 developers among whom 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.420
 I found a young industrial designer 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.760
 called I follow my love 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.469
 radial court was a similar game 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.370
 space invaders only with one 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:04.470
 3d perspective you had to destroy 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.820
 all the ships that came towards you and 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.750
 avoid being destroyed by them 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.750
 obviously 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.790
 this game became popular in Japan 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.190
 for a short period of time but 

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:18.590
 did not get to outperform the most popular one that 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:20.450
 was pacman back then nintendo 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.180
 decided to take advantage of this popularity to 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.650
 launch the game in North America the 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:27.080
 American version was a failure 

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.030
 because the sounds generated by the 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:42.560
 game were so sharp that they became 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:45.369
 annoying to those who played them and so 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.050
 this game managed to keep his players away 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:51.140
 this caused nintendo to stay with 2000 

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.759
 arkaitz already made of radars code since 

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:54.410
 they thought that this game would have the same 

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:58.160
 popularity he had in his native japan 

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.110
 but unfortunately it was not like that 

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.210
 president of the subsidiary in america 

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:04.580
 of nintendo at that time minor 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.679
 arakawa was about to disaster 

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:08.899
 financial so he called the president 

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:11.120
 of nintendo back then but it 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.340
 called like that and asked him to create a 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.260
 game which they could install in all 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:18.939
 these machines already created 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.939
 can replace through book 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:23.890
 yamauchi chose miyamoto for the 

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:26.260
 work since according to miyamoto there was no 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.840
 nobody available to do it 

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:30.220
 at that time nintendo sought to obtain 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.590
 the rights to be able to make a 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.480
 videogame of copei and life that 

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.069
 miyamoto decided to leave I have the loving 

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.870
 that was commonly seen in this 

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:41.799
 franchise and decided to use the 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:43.780
 characters of popeye brutes and olivia the 

00:02:41.799 --> 00:02:46.000
 treatment for the rights of popeye not be 

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.290
 gave and because of that he called me he had to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.340
 change the characters that was 

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.019
 using 

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.599
 replacing popeye with a carpenter 

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:55.560
 abrupt with a gorilla and olivia with 

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:57.840
 a simple miss 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.330
 so miyamoto with the help of 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.709
 computer programmers and technicians 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:03.930
 was creating a game where a gorilla 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:05.760
 steals a carpenter's girlfriend in a 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:07.770
 construction zone and the carpenter 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.989
 I had to go up all the tracks 

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:12.690
 construction avoiding the obstacles that 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:15.200
 the gorilla he threw had been created 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:15.200
 donkey kong 

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.560
 Donkey Kong is the name of the monkey his 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.390
 name comes from the search he did 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.580
 miyamoto to find a name in 

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.670
 English that will mean stupid mont or 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.490
 monotonous for the word stupid 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:31.470
 Miyamoto chose the word touch it 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.990
 which means donkey in Spanish and this one 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.060
 its time that it is synonymous with fool and 

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.030
 kong due to the popular giant gorilla 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.160
 King Kong of Carpenter was called 'Mr. 

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:42.330
 video and it was planned that the 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.490
 appeared in all games 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.470
 developed with fly mile but 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.650
 then he was just called young 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.450
 man and his girlfriend was called polÃ­n due 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.730
 that this was the name of the wife of 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.560
 a manager of nintendo donkey kong had 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.120
 a huge popularity because it was 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.040
 a game different from cybers 

00:03:57.120 --> 00:04:02.250
 specials which predominated in 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.260
 the coffers the 2006 converted from 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.090
 rappers like donkey kong were sold 

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.610
 and more of these were created because of the 

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.740
 great demand that this game had donkey 

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:13.590
 Kong managed to sell 4,000 arcade machines 

00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:15.720
 in a month and in a year he sold 60 thousand 

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.459
 machines generating the nintendo one 

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:21.440
 180 million dollars profit 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.479
 after the incredible event that donkey 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:25.930
 kong had nintendo decided to make a 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:28.610
 sequel called donkey kong young 

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:30.830
 this is where jackman gets his 

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.470
 distinctive the name of mario because of 

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:34.910
 a very curious story the executives 

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:36.949
 in tried to have a meeting in the 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.039
 building where the subsidiary of 

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:42.080
 nintendo in america in that the owner of the 

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:44.090
 building enters interrupting the board 

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.770
 to collect the rent 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.050
 the executives had a small 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:50.210
 discussion about the rent they asked the 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:53.120
 owner to give them a little more than 

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:55.460
 time to pay it the owner who 

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.020
 called Mario seguel decided to give them a 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:05:00.120
 opportunity and the executives decided 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.850
 called young but like him 

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:05.070

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:08.729
 depends on the son of donkey kong who stops 

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.470
 for all the obstacles that mario 

00:05:08.729 --> 00:05:12.300
 quang on the way to be able to free 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:14.310
 your dad after this game 

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.430
 miyamoto decided that mario had his 

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:19.860
 own game and so he and a programmer 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.530
 called a peugeot with whom also 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.030
 he worked in donkey kong they created a new 

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.760
 I play someone from platform called 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:27.950
 mario brothers 

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.890
 in this game the character of mario was 

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:32.720
 redesigned becoming plumber 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.370
 they gave him superhuman abilities like 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.190
 not hurt yourself by falling too high or 

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.590
 being able to jump long distances was created 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:41.990
 to his brother luigi who was the same as 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.100
 he just from a different color and they 

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:44.840
 together they had to get rid of 

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:47.300
 creatures that caused problems in the 

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:48.980
 sewers of new york the game does not 

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:51.040
 it was a brian ching like it was 

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:54.790
 due to the crisis of video games 

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:57.620
 1983 and we will not see mario until 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:06:01.490
 1985 on the nintendo entertainment system 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:06:03.110
 with his game called super mario bros in 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:06.140
 this game we see mario in a new 

00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:08.360
 world much a boy who mario arrived 

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:09.980
 through a pipe here you must 

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.930
 save the princess from this kingdom 

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:13.610
 the mind is current studies who was 

00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.460
 kidnapped by the evil boxer to 

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:18.080
 be able to take over your kingdom this game 

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:19.850
 It was very popular in the console 

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:21.890
 because of its simple gameplay and at the same time 

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.350
 with its degree of complexity and by the 

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:26.180
 atmosphere of adventure that this one creates this 

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.620
 it was because miyamoto wanted to focus 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.090
 more in the adventure that we made to 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.610
 through the game and not in the score 

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:34.919
 maximum as scheduled 

00:06:32.610 --> 00:06:36.689
 this game came to be the best selling in 

00:06:34.919 --> 00:06:38.430
 history and help induce 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.080
 recover from the crisis by which 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:43.139
 had passed and impulse to video games 

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.120
 to become what they are now leaving 

00:06:43.139 --> 00:06:46.590
 of monte step by mario later as 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.000
 visiting the different schools 

00:06:46.590 --> 00:06:50.639
 different worlds different galaxies 

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.789
 he had tennis games and those little pieces of 

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:57.289
 baseball soccer your racing tournaments 

00:06:53.789 --> 00:07:01.139

00:06:57.289 --> 00:07:03.180

 I'm such a fan of mario but he has taken 

00:07:03.180 --> 00:07:07.349
 very good games which have 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:10.669

 calm give an opportunity to mario 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:16.460

00:07:20.539 --> 00:07:25.879
