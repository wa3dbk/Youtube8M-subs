sturdy<00:01:00.359> you'll<00:01:01.260> then<00:01:01.289> want<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.739> add<00:01:01.890> some

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:02.840 
sturdy you'll then want to add some

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.460 
sturdy you'll then want to add some
room-temperature<00:01:03.840> water<00:01:06.110> okay<00:01:07.110> we're<00:01:07.380> going

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
room-temperature water okay we're going

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.500 
room-temperature water okay we're going
to<00:01:07.530> first<00:01:07.740> start<00:01:07.950> by<00:01:08.549> cutting<00:01:08.970> some<00:01:09.270> of<00:01:09.420> the

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
to first start by cutting some of the

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.070 
to first start by cutting some of the
branches<00:01:10.640> and<00:01:11.640> let<00:01:12.540> me<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.840> branch

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
branches and let me take the branch

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.190 
branches and let me take the branch
cutter<00:01:13.350> and<00:01:13.680> just<00:01:13.890> cut<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.000> up<00:01:15.060> first<00:01:15.960> of<00:01:16.110> all

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
cutter and just cut that up first of all

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:18.170 
cutter and just cut that up first of all
few<00:01:16.560> reasons<00:01:16.740> we'd<00:01:17.580> like<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.880> get<00:01:17.970> different

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
few reasons we'd like to get different

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.510 
few reasons we'd like to get different
heights<00:01:18.570> of<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:18.869> branches<00:01:19.409> we<00:01:20.070> also<00:01:20.220> want<00:01:20.460> to

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:20.520 
heights of the branches we also want to

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.490 
heights of the branches we also want to
give<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.700> a<00:01:20.759> fresh<00:01:20.909> cut<00:01:21.330> and<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:22.110> going<00:01:22.259> to<00:01:22.320> cut

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
give it a fresh cut and I'm going to cut

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.640 
give it a fresh cut and I'm going to cut
off<00:01:22.680> some<00:01:22.710> of<00:01:23.070> the<00:01:23.250> smaller<00:01:23.640> stems<00:01:24.500> and<00:01:25.500> I'm

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
off some of the smaller stems and I'm

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.850 
off some of the smaller stems and I'm
gonna<00:01:25.770> start<00:01:25.979> placing<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.549> in<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.729> vase<00:01:30.860> just

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
gonna start placing it in the vase just

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.410 
gonna start placing it in the vase just
like<00:01:32.009> for<00:01:32.250> some<00:01:32.369> of<00:01:32.549> these<00:01:32.640> you<00:01:32.909> may<00:01:33.030> not<00:01:33.180> need

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
like for some of these you may not need

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.300 
like for some of these you may not need
a<00:01:33.479> branch<00:01:33.840> cutter<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.259> may<00:01:34.380> just<00:01:34.590> be<00:01:35.100> able<00:01:35.189> to

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
a branch cutter you may just be able to

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.819 
a branch cutter you may just be able to
use<00:01:35.549> a<00:01:35.579> floral<00:01:36.030> shear<00:01:36.320> but<00:01:37.320> that<00:01:37.470> makes<00:01:37.619> it<00:01:37.740> a

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
use a floral shear but that makes it a

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.469 
use a floral shear but that makes it a
little<00:01:38.130> bit<00:01:38.460> more<00:01:38.640> difficult<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.180> might<00:01:39.329> want

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
little bit more difficult you might want

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:43.310 
little bit more difficult you might want
to<00:01:39.540> be<00:01:39.600> really<00:01:39.840> strong<00:01:40.110> to<00:01:40.170> do<00:01:40.439> that<00:01:42.320> okay

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
to be really strong to do that okay

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.179 
to be really strong to do that okay
let's<00:01:43.619> see<00:01:43.890> here<00:01:45.530> okay<00:01:46.530> now<00:01:46.680> these<00:01:46.860> are<00:01:47.040> going

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:47.189 
let's see here okay now these are going

00:01:47.189 --> 00:01:49.550 
let's see here okay now these are going
to<00:01:47.250> open<00:01:47.399> up<00:01:47.670> as<00:01:47.909> time<00:01:48.540> goes<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.960> these<00:01:49.259> last

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
to open up as time goes on these last

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.010 
to open up as time goes on these last
about<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:49.920> week<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.220> ten<00:01:50.640> days<00:01:50.670> and<00:01:51.570> that's<00:01:51.869> why

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
about a week to ten days and that's why

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.330 
about a week to ten days and that's why
I<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.200> suggest<00:01:52.470> to<00:01:52.799> use<00:01:53.009> room-temperature

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
I also suggest to use room-temperature

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.359 
I also suggest to use room-temperature
water<00:01:53.790> because<00:01:54.420> the<00:01:54.450> branches<00:01:55.049> drink<00:01:55.770> warm

00:01:56.359 --> 00:01:56.369 
water because the branches drink warm

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.340 
water because the branches drink warm
water<00:01:56.640> a<00:01:56.759> lot<00:01:56.939> quicker<00:01:57.240> than<00:01:57.390> the<00:01:57.540> cold<00:01:57.840> cool

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
water a lot quicker than the cold cool

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.670 
water a lot quicker than the cold cool
water<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> if<00:01:59.969> you<00:02:00.090> see<00:02:00.270> already<00:02:00.719> i'm<00:02:00.990> creating

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
water so if you see already i'm creating

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.130 
water so if you see already i'm creating
somewhat<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> a<00:02:02.340> design<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.759> also<00:02:03.140> symmetry

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
somewhat of a design and also symmetry

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.499 
somewhat of a design and also symmetry
as<00:02:04.350> well<00:02:05.130> as<00:02:05.280> sturdiness<00:02:05.640> within<00:02:06.210> the<00:02:06.329> vase

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
as well as sturdiness within the vase

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.479 
as well as sturdiness within the vase
and<00:02:06.869> then<00:02:07.409> i'm<00:02:07.500> going<00:02:07.619> to<00:02:07.680> start<00:02:07.860> building<00:02:08.369> it

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:08.489 
and then i'm going to start building it
