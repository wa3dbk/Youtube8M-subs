00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.790
 [music] 

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:11.760
 Hello dear friends, I decided 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.950
 make another honey home video 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.410
 Mastic thing is that many do 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.290
 mistakes in its manufacture and I decided 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.919
 tell and comment again 

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.360
 making gelatin I take 

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:27.119
 instantly made everything in grams 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:30.960
 so you are not mistaken I take 15 grams 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:33.920
 gelatin and 45 grams of water when mixed 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.180
 gelatin and water necessarily spoon 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:39.480
 stir to gelatin 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.269
 could evenly wait when 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.239
 gelatin swell no you get 

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:49.160
 such a mass that itself is similar to 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.789
 add strong gelatin to this mass 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.660
 175 grams of honey in the microwave I keep 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:01.260
 30 seconds stirring it turns out so 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:04.920
 weight and keep another 30 seconds to full 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:08.130
 dissolving gelatin and honey to 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:12.180
 such a stump was on top and gelatinous 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:16.290
 the mass was hot and so remembered and 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:20.160
 recorded up to 15 grams of gelatin 45 grams 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.440
 water and 175 grams of honey I already know this 

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:25.530
 recipe by heart because so many 

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:26.400
 wrong now I take icing sugar from 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.730
 I'm powdered 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.390
 1 pack I usually take for myself powder 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.970
 one kilo so stop you first need 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.970
 strain 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:41.880
 gelatin mass I'm filtering because 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.300
 that my gelatin is wonderful but you 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:46.830
 Suddenly gelatin will be some pieces 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.590
 be sure to strain through a sieve here 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.950
 look my sieve is clean 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:55.740
 Well, you still need to 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 strain off the extra pieces and now I 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:01.710
 I'm starting to stir 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.050
 pro 900 grams of powder to or one 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.550
 kilogram for myself I always take one 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:07.950
 kilogram but since so many people 

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:08.789
 complain that they get hard 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.900
 mastic 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:15.480
 I write 900 grams 900 grams for the lazy 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.200
 pens who have pens are not lazy who can 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:21.489
 knead mastic then add on 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:24.440
 im a kilo of powder look i am now 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:26.360
 Stir up with a spoon at first until it was 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.519
 hot gelatin mass now a 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.430
 earpiece is not so hot i keep 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:34.640
 kneading hands to mastic turns 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.940
 like a tight dough and naturally need 

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.470
 make some effort when you have her 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:41.780
 stir but it fails 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.480
 solid here look like this 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:47.330
 Mastic she elastic soft 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:47.840
 if it sticks to your hands and sticks to 

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.540
 the table 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.700
 it is normal to be sure to work 

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:56.440
 with starch and i take corn starch 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:59.930
 since he is odorless and snow white and 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.690
 look here again I stretch my hands 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:05.930
 mastic it turns out very soft 

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:08.599
 very elastic it is very comfortable for 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.299
 weaving cakes she is not torn and not 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:14.329
 crack if you leave 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:16.549
 this mastic for a day every other day from her 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.340
 you can sculpt figures 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:21.590
 I cut to show inside this 

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:23.900
 marshmallow mass 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:25.510
 if you need to make a white y 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:27.709
 mastic then you need to add 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.230
 super white dye 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:32.569
 if you roll mastic and you have it 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:35.660
 bubbles leave her to lie on 

00:03:32.569 --> 00:03:38.799
 half an hour and do the rolling again if 

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:41.660
 You have left pieces of mastic 

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:44.450
 throw them out don't have to put them in 

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:46.850
 sealed bag and stored mastic 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.370
 can be up to three months at room 

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:50.660
 temperature even think more to six 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:53.420
 months can be stored 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:55.940
 Well, in the freezer you can store more 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:58.100
 years in a sealed package naturally in 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:00.950
 the freezer has odors 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:03.560
 therefore it is possible even several packages 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:05.959
 wrap the mastic against odors 

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:07.910
 next when you get the mastic out 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.489
 refrigerator or she lay down 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.720
 a little and naturally it hardens and 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:15.169
 becomes hard 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:18.079
 it's not scary you take and put in 

00:04:15.169 --> 00:04:20.900
 microwave for 10-15 seconds 

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.120
 whichever size your 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:24.950
 watch a piece do not reheat and not 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:27.349
 melt and mastic too much 

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:29.810
 slightly warmed got out 

00:04:27.349 --> 00:04:31.700
 microwave and hands kneaded 

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:33.490
 mastic consistency again 

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.800
 rotates to soft elastic 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:39.890
 of mastic is very convenient and 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:42.350
 making cheap honey 

00:04:39.890 --> 00:04:45.080
 you can use absolutely any 

00:04:42.350 --> 00:04:48.980
 the lighter you will use honey 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:51.380
 the lighter your honey can be 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:54.320
 take even candied and melt 

00:04:51.380 --> 00:04:56.510
 its in the microwave with gelatin I 

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.420
 I think in this video I answered all 

00:04:56.510 --> 00:05:01.670
 your questions when making cakes for 

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.420
 stitches i use only honey 

00:05:01.670 --> 00:05:05.450
 mastic 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:07.100
 it is convenient and cheap if you like it 

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.660
 my video like and share 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.730
 video link 

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.950
 I will be glad to see you on the following 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.110
 master classes and hope this lesson to you 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.830
 also good for you all good 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:17.830
