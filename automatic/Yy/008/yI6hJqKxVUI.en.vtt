00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:02.970 
hey guys this is on desert for super

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:07.369 
hey guys this is on desert for super
super<00:00:03.300> quick<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.629> I<00:00:04.589> just<00:00:05.400> bought<00:00:05.730> one<00:00:06.379> of

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
super quick video I just bought one of

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.520 
super quick video I just bought one of
these<00:00:07.470> air<00:00:08.130> Raiders<00:00:08.519> that<00:00:09.330> require<00:00:09.660> D

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:10.530 
these air Raiders that require D

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.770 
these air Raiders that require D
batteries<00:00:10.769> so<00:00:11.400> this<00:00:12.330> is<00:00:12.420> what<00:00:12.570> I'm<00:00:12.660> gonna

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:12.780 
batteries so this is what I'm gonna

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.560 
batteries so this is what I'm gonna
showcase<00:00:13.130> and<00:00:14.130> I<00:00:14.190> figured<00:00:14.580> instead<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.360> buying

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
showcase and I figured instead of buying

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.090 
showcase and I figured instead of buying
be<00:00:15.809> batteries<00:00:16.170> just<00:00:16.199> gotta<00:00:16.560> be<00:00:16.680> a<00:00:16.710> better<00:00:16.830> way

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
be batteries just gotta be a better way

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.510 
be batteries just gotta be a better way
and<00:00:17.340> my<00:00:18.240> idea<00:00:18.840> was<00:00:19.230> there<00:00:20.100> we<00:00:20.220> go<00:00:20.369> it's

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
and my idea was there we go it's

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.750 
and my idea was there we go it's
good-bye-ee<00:00:21.650> batteries<00:00:22.650> with<00:00:22.800> the<00:00:22.949> spacers

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
good-bye-ee batteries with the spacers

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.380 
good-bye-ee batteries with the spacers
and<00:00:24.000> you<00:00:24.150> can<00:00:24.300> at<00:00:24.390> least<00:00:24.510> use<00:00:25.220> more<00:00:26.390> economical

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
and you can at least use more economical

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.380 
and you can at least use more economical
cells<00:00:27.750> instead<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.439> buying<00:00:28.730> deep<00:00:29.730> batteries

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
cells instead of buying deep batteries

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.269 
cells instead of buying deep batteries
because<00:00:30.630> that's<00:00:30.810> pretty<00:00:31.260> annoying<00:00:31.500> so<00:00:31.949> that's

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
because that's pretty annoying so that's

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:42.760 
because that's pretty annoying so that's
gonna<00:00:32.460> be<00:00:33.649> show<00:00:34.649> you<00:00:34.710> what<00:00:34.950> it's<00:00:35.070> all<00:00:35.219> about

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.260 

batteries<00:00:43.969> know<00:00:44.969> how<00:00:45.210> often<00:00:45.539> this<00:00:45.960> brand<00:00:46.620> is

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:47.270 
batteries know how often this brand is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:54.830 
batteries know how often this brand is
so<00:00:48.469> essentially<00:00:49.469> this<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.309> the<00:00:51.170> cell<00:00:53.840> nothing

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
so essentially this is the cell nothing

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.689 
so essentially this is the cell nothing
to<00:00:54.960> it<00:00:55.050> on<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.199> top<00:00:55.440> the<00:00:56.010> bottom<00:00:56.370> there's

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
to it on the top the bottom there's

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.160 
to it on the top the bottom there's
where<00:00:57.030> the<00:00:57.539> battery<00:00:57.870> will<00:00:57.960> slide<00:00:58.289> in<00:00:59.000> and<00:01:00.170> then

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
where the battery will slide in and then

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
where the battery will slide in and then
you<00:01:01.260> push<00:01:01.500> that<00:01:01.710> up<00:01:01.770> and<00:01:02.160> then<00:01:02.399> pops<00:01:02.969> up<00:01:03.270> this

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
you push that up and then pops up this

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.030 
you push that up and then pops up this
little<00:01:03.780> piece<00:01:04.850> that's<00:01:05.850> kind<00:01:06.150> of<00:01:06.180> neat<00:01:07.040> same

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
little piece that's kind of neat same

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.510 
little piece that's kind of neat same
thing<00:01:08.340> with<00:01:08.490> this<00:01:08.580> other<00:01:08.790> one<00:01:10.850> down<00:01:13.250> terms<00:01:14.250> of

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
thing with this other one down terms of

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.280 
thing with this other one down terms of
demonstrating<00:01:15.479> the<00:01:15.540> product<00:01:15.900> let<00:01:16.020> me<00:01:16.140> open

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
demonstrating the product let me open

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:23.420 
demonstrating the product let me open
this<00:01:16.530> little<00:01:16.909> aerator<00:01:21.799> it's<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:22.950> bubble<00:01:23.100> box

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
this little aerator it's the bubble box

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.109 
this little aerator it's the bubble box
b11<00:01:24.270> I'll<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.110> a<00:01:25.140> review<00:01:25.590> coming<00:01:25.920> out<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.939> the

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
b11 I'll have a review coming out in the

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:32.990 
b11 I'll have a review coming out in the
future<00:01:27.240> but<00:01:30.619> this<00:01:31.619> stuff<00:01:31.950> just<00:01:32.640> to<00:01:32.759> prove<00:01:32.939> that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
future but this stuff just to prove that

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.310 
future but this stuff just to prove that
it<00:01:33.180> works<00:01:33.950> positive<00:01:34.950> negative<00:01:35.130> in<00:01:36.170> fits<00:01:37.170> nice

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
it works positive negative in fits nice

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:47.270 
it works positive negative in fits nice
turn<00:01:40.320> it<00:01:40.439> on<00:01:40.590> see<00:01:40.979> what<00:01:41.100> happens<00:01:45.439> so<00:01:46.439> in<00:01:47.040> terms

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
turn it on see what happens so in terms

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.870 
turn it on see what happens so in terms
of<00:01:48.229> the<00:01:49.229> amount<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.470> power<00:01:49.740> you're<00:01:50.610> not<00:01:50.759> gonna

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
of the amount of power you're not gonna

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.639 
of the amount of power you're not gonna
get<00:01:51.060> as<00:01:51.149> much<00:01:51.329> because<00:01:51.899> it's<00:01:52.020> a<00:01:52.079> smaller<00:01:52.320> cell

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
get as much because it's a smaller cell

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:56.179 
get as much because it's a smaller cell
but<00:01:53.060> it'll<00:01:54.060> be<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.689> lot<00:01:55.140> more<00:01:55.350> easier<00:01:55.740> to<00:01:55.950> obtain

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
but it'll be a lot more easier to obtain

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.410 
but it'll be a lot more easier to obtain
these<00:01:57.149> double<00:01:58.140> a's<00:01:58.259> instead<00:01:58.590> of<00:01:58.680> DS<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.700> thanks

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
these double a's instead of DS so thanks

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:03.409 
these double a's instead of DS so thanks
for<00:02:00.479> tuning<00:02:00.630> in<00:02:00.780> later
