00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:49.170 
rhythm approach here everything that I'm

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:50.540 
rhythm approach here everything that I'm
playing<00:03:49.440> I'm<00:03:49.709> seeing<00:03:49.980> coming<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:50.430> of<00:03:50.490> those

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:50.550 
playing I'm seeing coming out of those

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.070 
playing I'm seeing coming out of those
pentatonic<00:03:51.180> scales<00:03:51.480> I've<00:03:51.780> seen<00:03:51.930> the

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
pentatonic scales I've seen the

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.280 
pentatonic scales I've seen the
arpeggios<00:03:52.650> no<00:03:52.860> less<00:03:53.040> stuff<00:03:53.250> and<00:03:53.720> our<00:03:54.720> final

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:55.290 
arpeggios no less stuff and our final

00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.370 
arpeggios no less stuff and our final
position<00:03:55.440> we<00:03:56.160> have<00:03:56.400> the<00:03:56.550> e<00:03:56.580> chord<00:03:57.180> with<00:03:57.989> the<00:03:58.020> D

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
position we have the e chord with the D

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.540 
position we have the e chord with the D
form

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.460 

then<00:04:02.090> we<00:04:02.270> need<00:04:02.390> a<00:04:02.450> D<00:04:02.750> chord<00:04:03.110> in<00:04:03.200> the<00:04:03.260> same

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:03.470 
then we need a D chord in the same

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:06.430 
then we need a D chord in the same
general<00:04:03.860> area<00:04:03.980> so<00:04:04.280> we<00:04:04.370> go<00:04:04.490> with<00:04:04.610> a<00:04:04.640> c4<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:06.350> have

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:06.440 
general area so we go with a c4 we have

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.330 
general area so we go with a c4 we have
an<00:04:06.560> a<00:04:06.680> core<00:04:07.040> with<00:04:07.370> the<00:04:07.400> G<00:04:07.640> form

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.730 
think in terms of these forms that's why
I'm<00:04:28.690> getting<00:04:28.900> a<00:04:28.930> little<00:04:29.110> tongue-tied<00:04:29.290> here

I'm getting a little tongue-tied here
once<00:04:30.460> you<00:04:30.580> learn<00:04:30.760> it<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.910> don't<00:04:31.090> really<00:04:31.180> think

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
once you learn it you don't really think

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.870 
once you learn it you don't really think
about<00:04:31.450> it<00:04:31.660> too<00:04:31.690> much<00:04:32.490> here<00:04:33.490> it<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.669> in<00:04:33.790> this

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:33.880 
about it too much here it is in this

00:04:33.880 --> 00:05:01.280 
about it too much here it is in this
position

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.020 

so<00:05:02.070> they<00:05:02.190> are<00:05:02.280> just<00:05:02.490> playing<00:05:02.670> kind<00:05:02.850> like<00:05:02.970> a

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
so they are just playing kind like a

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.290 
so they are just playing kind like a
little<00:05:03.210> rhythm<00:05:03.360> guitar<00:05:03.750> part<00:05:03.960> hybrid<00:05:04.380> picking

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.300 
little rhythm guitar part hybrid picking

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.460 
little rhythm guitar part hybrid picking
hopefully<00:05:06.300> you<00:05:06.420> see<00:05:06.660> how<00:05:06.840> there's<00:05:07.020> a<00:05:07.080> lot<00:05:07.320> of

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
hopefully you see how there's a lot of

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.280 
hopefully you see how there's a lot of
study<00:05:08.030> available<00:05:09.030> you<00:05:09.480> know<00:05:09.660> just<00:05:10.080> what<00:05:10.200> you

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:10.290 
study available you know just what you

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:12.620 
study available you know just what you
want<00:05:10.470> to<00:05:10.560> hear<00:05:10.710> you<00:05:11.370> can<00:05:11.520> spend<00:05:11.820> a<00:05:12.030> very<00:05:12.270> long

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:12.630 
want to hear you can spend a very long

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:16.070 
want to hear you can spend a very long
time<00:05:12.930> weeks<00:05:13.920> months<00:05:14.580> a<00:05:14.820> long<00:05:15.270> time<00:05:15.600> working<00:05:15.900> on

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:16.080 
time weeks months a long time working on

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:18.230 
time weeks months a long time working on
one<00:05:16.290> progression<00:05:16.860> to<00:05:17.310> really<00:05:17.520> master<00:05:18.060> these

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:18.240 
one progression to really master these

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:20.990 
one progression to really master these
areas<00:05:18.750> but<00:05:19.710> ideally<00:05:20.400> you<00:05:20.520> want<00:05:20.670> to<00:05:20.730> see<00:05:20.880> the

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:21.000 
areas but ideally you want to see the

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.850 
areas but ideally you want to see the
whole<00:05:21.180> neck<00:05:21.450> as<00:05:21.570> an<00:05:21.690> integrated<00:05:22.140> flow<00:05:22.650> of

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:24.630 
notes and scales and arpeggios so I'm

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:26.750 
notes and scales and arpeggios so I'm
I'm<00:05:24.840> blocking<00:05:25.530> it<00:05:25.620> up<00:05:25.770> you<00:05:26.070> know<00:05:26.160> chopping<00:05:26.640> up

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:26.760 
I'm blocking it up you know chopping up

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.250 
I'm blocking it up you know chopping up
into<00:05:26.910> these<00:05:27.000> very<00:05:27.240> strict<00:05:27.570> positions<00:05:28.110> and

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.260 
into these very strict positions and

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.480 
into these very strict positions and
it's<00:05:28.350> kind<00:05:28.530> of<00:05:28.560> hard<00:05:28.710> me<00:05:28.890> to<00:05:28.980> play<00:05:29.130> that<00:05:29.280> way<00:05:29.430> to

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:29.490 
it's kind of hard me to play that way to

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:31.040 
it's kind of hard me to play that way to
just<00:05:29.760> not<00:05:29.970> want<00:05:30.150> to<00:05:30.210> move<00:05:30.360> around<00:05:30.480> be<00:05:30.870> a<00:05:30.900> little

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050 
just not want to move around be a little

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:33.230 
just not want to move around be a little
more<00:05:31.110> lyrical<00:05:31.440> but<00:05:31.650> if<00:05:32.400> you<00:05:32.700> learn<00:05:32.880> two

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:33.240 
more lyrical but if you learn two

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.970 
more lyrical but if you learn two
positions<00:05:33.780> that<00:05:33.900> are<00:05:34.020> adjacent<00:05:34.320> then<00:05:34.710> you<00:05:34.800> can

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:34.980 
positions that are adjacent then you can

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:36.110 
positions that are adjacent then you can
kind<00:05:35.190> of<00:05:35.250> blend<00:05:35.460> them<00:05:35.700> I'm<00:05:35.790> not<00:05:35.880> going<00:05:36.060> to

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
kind of blend them I'm not going to

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.640 
kind of blend them I'm not going to
demonstrate<00:05:36.240> that<00:05:36.750> that<00:05:36.960> comes<00:05:37.290> with<00:05:37.470> time

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
demonstrate that that comes with time

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.590 
demonstrate that that comes with time
you'll<00:05:37.890> be<00:05:37.980> able<00:05:38.040> to<00:05:38.160> do<00:05:38.250> this<00:05:38.400> and<00:05:38.760> ultimately

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:39.600 
you'll be able to do this and ultimately

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:41.630 
you'll be able to do this and ultimately
you'll<00:05:40.260> see<00:05:40.500> this<00:05:40.650> approach<00:05:41.040> is<00:05:41.250> really<00:05:41.460> nice

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
you'll see this approach is really nice

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:42.860 
you'll see this approach is really nice
even<00:05:42.000> when<00:05:42.120> you're<00:05:42.240> playing<00:05:42.480> in<00:05:42.600> a<00:05:42.660> linear

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
even when you're playing in a linear

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.200 
even when you're playing in a linear
sense<00:05:43.320> what<00:05:43.890> I<00:05:43.920> do<00:05:44.070> is<00:05:44.370> if<00:05:44.490> I'm<00:05:44.640> moving<00:05:44.820> up<00:05:45.090> and

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 
sense what I do is if I'm moving up and

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:46.640 
sense what I do is if I'm moving up and
down<00:05:45.300> in<00:05:45.420> a<00:05:45.600> linear<00:05:45.780> sense<00:05:46.140> or<00:05:46.290> even<00:05:46.470> along

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:46.650 
down in a linear sense or even along

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:49.910 
down in a linear sense or even along
diagonal<00:05:47.130> lines<00:05:47.340> as<00:05:48.110> I<00:05:49.110> move<00:05:49.350> from<00:05:49.530> left<00:05:49.800> to

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:51.960 
right or right to left I still see that

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.400 
I'm moving in and out of these block

position oriented player it's an

efficient way to play it's kind of

efficient way to play it's kind of
traditional<00:05:58.590> it<00:05:59.100> has<00:05:59.430> its<00:05:59.610> upsides<00:05:59.940> it<00:06:00.210> has

is<00:06:02.640> much<00:06:02.820> more<00:06:03.000> lyrical<00:06:03.420> but<00:06:03.600> you<00:06:03.840> can't<00:06:04.050> rely

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:04.290 
is much more lyrical but you can't rely

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.440 
is much more lyrical but you can't rely
on<00:06:04.350> patterns<00:06:04.770> as<00:06:04.920> much<00:06:05.130> so<00:06:05.850> I<00:06:05.880> suggest<00:06:06.330> you

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:06.450 
on patterns as much so I suggest you

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.480 
on patterns as much so I suggest you
learn<00:06:06.630> this<00:06:06.900> because<00:06:07.260> then<00:06:07.950> it<00:06:08.070> helps<00:06:08.100> you<00:06:08.430> a

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:08.490 
learn this because then it helps you a

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:09.980 
learn this because then it helps you a
lot<00:06:08.700> no<00:06:08.880> matter<00:06:09.030> what<00:06:09.180> chord<00:06:09.450> progression<00:06:09.870> you

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
lot no matter what chord progression you

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:13.160 
lot no matter what chord progression you
may<00:06:10.170> encounter<00:06:10.700> we<00:06:11.700> have<00:06:11.850> studied<00:06:12.420> for<00:06:12.690> the

that in the next section we will talk

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:31.670 
that in the next section we will talk
about<00:06:28.890> your<00:06:29.490> five<00:06:29.850> minor<00:06:30.390> forms<00:06:31.020> and<00:06:31.320> the

00:06:31.670 --> 00:06:31.680 
about your five minor forms and the

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:33.440 
about your five minor forms and the
corresponding<00:06:32.310> minor<00:06:32.490> pentatonic<00:06:32.910> scales

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:33.450 
corresponding minor pentatonic scales

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.090 
corresponding minor pentatonic scales
it's<00:06:33.720> the<00:06:33.810> same<00:06:34.050> format<00:06:34.560> you<00:06:34.770> just<00:06:34.950> have<00:06:35.070> a

it's the same format you just have a

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:36.860 
it's the same format you just have a
little<00:06:35.370> different<00:06:35.640> alignment<00:06:36.150> I'm<00:06:36.660> also

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:36.870 
little different alignment I'm also

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.540 
little different alignment I'm also
going<00:06:37.110> to<00:06:37.170> talk<00:06:37.380> in<00:06:37.560> the<00:06:37.650> next<00:06:38.010> section<00:06:38.340> about

going to talk in the next section about

00:06:38.550 --> 00:06:40.400 
going to talk in the next section about
how<00:06:38.820> to<00:06:38.880> approach<00:06:39.360> this<00:06:39.600> principle<00:06:40.110> of<00:06:40.230> the

how to approach this principle of the
major<00:06:40.950> pentatonic<00:06:41.340> versus<00:06:41.940> the<00:06:42.060> minor
