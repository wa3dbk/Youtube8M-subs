00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:06.260
 with the new seat leon experience 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.819
 she has a combo on the 

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.210
 road also a terrain his man 

00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:10.040
 stands 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:11.570
 The vehicle is celebrating here in Paris 

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.870
 premiere at the dealers shot off 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.870
 mid october 

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:18.640
 Seat is once again allowed on the shelf 

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:21.250
 serving the Volkswagen Group and 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.740
 conjures up 1 ratio compact all-wheel 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.199
 combination on the street at the seat leon 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:26.949
 experience is the 4 x 4 drive even 

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.860
 series 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.599
 there is always more in the wake of the suv boom 

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.580
 Blender and pauser at first 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:35.530
 look all-terrain look and then 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.120
 not even a four-wheel drive on board 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.580
 to have 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.670
 unlike the seat leon experience 

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:43.960
 true combination for all cases and has 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.350
 especially in the compact class 

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:48.550
 Reason of value for consumption reasons 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:51.100
 but he is only to the front wheel drive 

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:53.500
 automatically switched on if necessary 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.359
 this happens for example when grip 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.120
 missing and one or more wheels 

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:59.469
 Slip have the technology with it 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.980
 Haldex coupling comes from the 

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.300
 Group shelf from volkswagen 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.670
 Visually, the four-wheel drive is through 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.580
 some clear features as a vehicle 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.950
 to recognize for rough planks of protection 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.300
 the side skirts and wheelhouses 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.119
 signal that the compact spanier 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.500
 had to take 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.619
 the same applies to the underrun protection in 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:22.119
 aluminum look on the rear also brings 

00:01:20.619 --> 00:01:24.789
 the increase of the entire body 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:26.619
 15 millimeter off-road flair 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.149
 yes we have two years ago yes in here 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:30.399

 complete family with the five-door with 

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:34.390
 the three-door with the kombi cooper and 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.739
 now experience league is playing 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.929
 actually the most elegant and 

00:01:35.739 --> 00:01:40.000
 most sporty way to drive this leon 

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:42.429
 These are very nice dynamic combination 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.660
 this is enriched by real off-road elements 

00:01:42.429 --> 00:01:45.340
 means the vehicle is higher 

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:47.530
 that has bigger wheels has one 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:49.980
 four-wheel drive is a hard to brake 

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:54.360
 music fantastic abroad very nice 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:58.200
 four engines from 110 to 184 ps are available 

00:01:54.360 --> 00:02:00.060
 to choose a petrol and three diesel 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:02.850
 the gears become manual 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:04.860
 six-speed gearbox selected at the two 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:06.930
 peak motorization is ex-works 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:09.840
 automated double-clutch transmission 

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:12.960
 with on board the kombi cas pit wants 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.730
 do not be blind and so is when 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.820
 experience not only the four-wheel drive 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510
 series but also electronic 

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:20.130
 differential lock the in really 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.720
 heavy terrain in addition to 

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:24.750
 sovereign propulsion worry 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:26.310
 it is with the design of the leo experience 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.290
 once again succeeded for the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:30.210
 known to be reliable and 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:32.430
 high-quality Volkswagen technology one 

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:33.350
 individual southern rassige cover 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.060
 to create 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:38.430
 thus he has allrad kombi on the basis of 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.910
 compact leo in completely independent 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:43.250
 occurs from mid-October always all-wheel 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:45.480
 leon at the dealer 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:48.210

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.709
 mobile for spanish terrain 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:58.170
 who opt for more ground clearance off-road 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:00.209
 and higher cross-country worth 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:04.070
 is with this compact combo for each 

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:04.070
