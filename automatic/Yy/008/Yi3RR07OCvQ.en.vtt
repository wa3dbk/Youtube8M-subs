00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
hi I am going to demonstrate the no

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:17.480 
hi I am going to demonstrate the no
chain<00:00:05.720> starting<00:00:06.720> method<00:00:08.389> in<00:00:09.650> the<00:00:10.650> round<00:00:16.100> so<00:00:17.100> I

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
chain starting method in the round so I

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:21.070 
chain starting method in the round so I
just<00:00:17.760> slip<00:00:18.060> stitched<00:00:18.090> I'm<00:00:18.779> pulling<00:00:19.230> up<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.619> loop

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
just slip stitched I'm pulling up a loop

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.070 
just slip stitched I'm pulling up a loop
and<00:00:22.080> earlier<00:00:22.560> I<00:00:22.680> showed<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.220> the<00:00:24.080> paperclip

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
and earlier I showed you the paperclip

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.690 
and earlier I showed you the paperclip
tool<00:00:25.350> that<00:00:25.710> I'm<00:00:25.859> using<00:00:27.109> to<00:00:28.109> catch<00:00:28.349> the<00:00:28.680> yarn<00:00:31.700> so

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
tool that I'm using to catch the yarn so

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:42.049 
tool that I'm using to catch the yarn so
yarn<00:00:33.059> over<00:00:33.530> yarn<00:00:34.530> over<00:00:35.040> pull<00:00:36.000> through<00:00:41.059> and

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
yarn over yarn over pull through and

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:52.639 
yarn over yarn over pull through and
secure

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.860 

so<00:00:53.280> this<00:00:53.460> is<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:53.789> my<00:00:53.969> favorite<00:00:54.420> way<00:00:54.570> to<00:00:54.600> do

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
so this is not my favorite way to do

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.650 
so this is not my favorite way to do
things<00:00:55.079> I'm<00:00:55.559> going<00:00:55.860> to<00:00:55.949> frog<00:00:56.760> these<00:00:57.210> two

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
things I'm going to frog these two

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.610 
things I'm going to frog these two
stitches<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> show<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.160> my<00:00:59.579> favorite<00:01:00.180> way<00:01:00.620> to

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
stitches and show you my favorite way to

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:09.210 
stitches and show you my favorite way to
make<00:01:01.949> this<00:01:02.100> stitch<00:01:02.430> in<00:01:03.059> the<00:01:03.540> round

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:09.220 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.760 

so

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
so

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.139 
so
back<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.549> the<00:01:11.670> beginning<00:01:13.909> pulling<00:01:14.909> up<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.119> loop

00:01:15.139 --> 00:01:15.149 
back to the beginning pulling up a loop

00:01:15.149 --> 00:01:17.630 
back to the beginning pulling up a loop
but<00:01:15.930> instead<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.409> starting<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:16.979> stitch<00:01:17.250> I'm

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
but instead of starting the stitch I'm

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.950 
but instead of starting the stitch I'm
going<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:18.649> put<00:01:19.649> a<00:01:19.680> little<00:01:19.950> twist<00:01:20.130> in<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.729> loop

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
going to put a little twist in the loop

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:29.570 
going to put a little twist in the loop
so<00:01:21.960> over<00:01:22.860> and<00:01:23.280> under<00:01:27.560> puts<00:01:28.560> a<00:01:28.710> little<00:01:29.009> twist<00:01:29.310> in

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
so over and under puts a little twist in

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.310 
so over and under puts a little twist in
the<00:01:29.789> loop<00:01:32.179> and<00:01:33.179> I'll<00:01:33.270> take<00:01:33.509> my<00:01:33.689> paper<00:01:34.020> clip

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
the loop and I'll take my paper clip

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.669 
the loop and I'll take my paper clip
tool<00:01:37.820> and<00:01:38.820> if<00:01:38.939> you<00:01:39.060> have<00:01:39.270> the<00:01:39.450> plastic<00:01:40.289> coated

00:01:40.669 --> 00:01:40.679 
tool and if you have the plastic coated

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:43.669 
tool and if you have the plastic coated
paper<00:01:40.920> clips<00:01:41.280> it's<00:01:41.610> less<00:01:41.880> slippery<00:01:42.679> because

00:01:43.669 --> 00:01:43.679 
paper clips it's less slippery because

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:46.219 
paper clips it's less slippery because
right<00:01:44.459> now<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:44.670> have<00:01:44.789> metal<00:01:45.270> on<00:01:45.360> metal<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.780> find

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
right now I have metal on metal I find

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.730 
right now I have metal on metal I find
it<00:01:46.350> a<00:01:46.380> little<00:01:46.470> bit<00:01:46.740> slippery<00:01:47.429> so<00:01:48.530> there's<00:01:49.530> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
it a little bit slippery so there's the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.680 
it a little bit slippery so there's the
loop<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.220> here's<00:01:50.490> the<00:01:50.640> paper<00:01:50.850> clip<00:01:51.179> holding

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 
loop and here's the paper clip holding

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:57.380 
loop and here's the paper clip holding
onto<00:01:51.990> it<00:01:52.289> and<00:01:52.649> I<00:01:52.830> yarn<00:01:53.130> over<00:01:55.100> yarn<00:01:56.100> over<00:01:56.640> pull

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
onto it and I yarn over yarn over pull

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:04.789 
onto it and I yarn over yarn over pull
through<00:01:57.420> yarn<00:01:58.409> over<00:02:03.110> secure<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.229> paper<00:02:04.470> clip

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
through yarn over secure the paper clip

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.719 
through yarn over secure the paper clip
on<00:02:04.920> the<00:02:05.069> stitch<00:02:06.830> again<00:02:07.830> this<00:02:08.220> is<00:02:08.399> an

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
on the stitch again this is an

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.270 
on the stitch again this is an
alternative<00:02:09.479> this<00:02:09.989> is<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.319> way<00:02:10.500> I<00:02:10.530> like<00:02:10.920> to<00:02:10.950> do

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280

clip I can see the little hole where I
need<00:02:43.829> to<00:02:44.010> put<00:02:44.340> my<00:02:44.519> slip<00:02:44.880> stitch<00:02:45.150> to<00:02:45.450> join<00:02:45.480> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
need to put my slip stitch to join the

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:58.240 
need to put my slip stitch to join the
round

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:13.309 

and<00:02:59.250> now<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.610> can<00:02:59.850> remove<00:03:00.300> my<00:03:00.600> paperclip

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:16.550 

so<00:03:13.829> for<00:03:14.129> the<00:03:14.219> next<00:03:14.549> round<00:03:15.480> you<00:03:15.840> do<00:03:16.170> the<00:03:16.319> same

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
so for the next round you do the same

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.880 
so for the next round you do the same
and<00:03:17.989> I'm<00:03:18.989> going<00:03:19.290> to<00:03:19.379> do<00:03:19.739> my<00:03:20.010> twist<00:03:21.620> but<00:03:22.620> that's

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
and I'm going to do my twist but that's

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:24.890 
and I'm going to do my twist but that's
optional<00:03:23.159> you<00:03:23.909> can<00:03:24.060> do<00:03:24.239> it<00:03:24.329> the<00:03:24.450> other<00:03:24.480> way<00:03:24.659> if

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:24.900 
optional you can do it the other way if

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:29.030 
optional you can do it the other way if
you<00:03:25.019> like<00:03:25.200> how<00:03:25.349> it<00:03:25.500> looks<00:03:25.709> I<00:03:27.230> don't<00:03:28.230> I<00:03:28.530> think

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.040 
you like how it looks I don't I think

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.240 
you like how it looks I don't I think
it's<00:03:29.189> a<00:03:29.280> little<00:03:29.400> loose<00:03:30.439> so<00:03:31.439> this<00:03:31.650> tightens<00:03:32.129> it

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
it's a little loose so this tightens it

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.640 
it's a little loose so this tightens it
up<00:03:32.370> a<00:03:32.489> little<00:03:32.609> bit<00:03:32.879> and<00:03:33.269> makes<00:03:33.480> it<00:03:33.689> a<00:03:33.900> little

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
up a little bit and makes it a little

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:56.000 
up a little bit and makes it a little
bit<00:03:34.829> neater<00:03:34.980> and<00:03:39.260> yarn-over<00:03:53.239> secure<00:03:55.010> paper

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
bit neater and yarn-over secure paper

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:18.009 
bit neater and yarn-over secure paper
clip

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:18.019 

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:26.000 

so<00:04:18.530> there<00:04:18.739> you<00:04:18.859> have<00:04:18.889> it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:26.010 

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:30.860 

and<00:04:26.520> as<00:04:26.670> you<00:04:26.850> can<00:04:27.000> see<00:04:28.400> the<00:04:29.400> stitch<00:04:29.790> looks<00:04:30.420> very

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:30.870 
and as you can see the stitch looks very

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.730 
and as you can see the stitch looks very
much<00:04:31.170> like<00:04:31.200> a<00:04:31.800> double<00:04:32.370> crochet<00:04:32.850> you<00:04:33.740> didn't

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
much like a double crochet you didn't

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:43.250 
much like a double crochet you didn't
chain<00:04:35.070> to<00:04:35.670> make<00:04:35.880> it<00:04:36.060> and<00:04:38.270> it's<00:04:39.530> this<00:04:40.530> one<00:04:42.260> you

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:43.260 
chain to make it and it's this one you

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.560 
chain to make it and it's this one you
can<00:04:43.410> hardly<00:04:43.710> tell<00:04:43.800> it's<00:04:44.130> there<00:04:45.320> have<00:04:46.320> fun
