00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:16.209
 the secret of mashed potatoes 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.610
 who do not stick or rather who does not strings 

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.509
 it does not reside essentially in the 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:22.480
 choice of potato 

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.340
 so I chose bintje but there 

00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:26.590
 in others it can be the manon 

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:28.149
 to put there caesar it can be the victoria 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.640
 the grid to if you have the happiness of 

00:00:28.149 --> 00:00:31.809
 find a day but not only in 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.100
 the choice of the potato for that 

00:00:31.809 --> 00:00:34.600
 it does not fit or that it will rope 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:37.149
 also spent in preparation then 

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.429
 we already start with the broth because 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.809
 that the potato for a mashed potato 

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:42.760
 do not mind like that in the water with 

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:45.070
 salt no no no no one prepares a 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.780
 broth with a branch of rosemary a 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:49.120
 garlic clove in a small shirt 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.170
 bouillon cube and of course salt we put 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.820
 the potatoes near the same in 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.739
 to brush and had it left skin 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.179
 simply to prevent the water from 

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:57.070
 penetrate troops inside the 

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:58.749
 potato what goes there soggy on 

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.640
 cooked over low heat 

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:02.350
 when the potato and 8 we get it out 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.390
 long the drops well we can even the 

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.580
 let it rest a little while and then 

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.450
 then we call that puts it in 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.430
 the vegetable mill 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:11.049
 and if we do not have a vegetable mill and 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.009
 well to this world is buying one be on 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:13.659
 can do it with a fork 

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:15.729
 we avoid the robot because it's 

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:18.280
 precisely that will make ropes and the 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.469
 purge wam of earth we pass the apple of 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:23.670
 ground to the vegetable mill and we add 

00:01:20.469 --> 00:01:25.930
 then milk cream and butter 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:26.920
 little trick have to serve for the 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.020
 make it even lighter and creamier 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.649
 before putting it on the table a 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.939
 little whip 

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:32.939
 it will be perfect 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.149
 it's not bad at all
