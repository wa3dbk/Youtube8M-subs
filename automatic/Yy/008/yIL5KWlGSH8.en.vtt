matter how rubbish it is it can take you

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.330 
matter how rubbish it is it can take you
literally<00:02:22.230> seconds<00:02:22.739> because<00:02:23.099> we're<00:02:23.250> now

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
literally seconds because we're now

literally seconds because we're now
going<00:02:23.519> to<00:02:23.610> cover<00:02:23.819> it<00:02:24.030> and<00:02:24.209> this<00:02:24.720> technique<00:02:25.110> is

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.000 
going to cover it and this technique is

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.509 
going to cover it and this technique is
very<00:02:27.000> similar<00:02:27.480> to<00:02:27.930> those<00:02:28.560> things<00:02:29.099> we<00:02:29.220> used<00:02:29.400> to

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:29.519 
very similar to those things we used to

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:30.410 
very similar to those things we used to
get<00:02:29.640> at<00:02:29.790> school

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:30.420 
get at school

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.370 
get at school
those<00:02:32.690> foil<00:02:33.690> do<00:02:33.780> you<00:02:33.870> remember<00:02:33.989> the<00:02:34.200> black

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.380 
those foil do you remember the black

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.280 
those foil do you remember the black
foil<00:02:34.709> things<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.190> you<00:02:35.340> used<00:02:35.550> to<00:02:35.760> have<00:02:36.390> with

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
foil things that you used to have with

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.660 
foil things that you used to have with
them<00:02:38.690> some-something<00:02:39.690> shop<00:02:40.200> to<00:02:40.650> pick<00:02:41.610> a

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
them some-something shop to pick a

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.850 
them some-something shop to pick a
picture<00:02:42.060> out<00:02:42.299> of<00:02:42.330> it<00:02:42.630> like<00:02:43.230> scratch<00:02:43.530> off<00:02:43.709> the

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 
picture out of it like scratch off the

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.009 
picture out of it like scratch off the
surface<00:02:44.340> it's<00:02:44.580> like<00:02:44.760> a<00:02:44.790> waxy<00:02:45.299> surface<00:02:45.540> that

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
surface it's like a waxy surface that

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.309 
surface it's like a waxy surface that
you<00:02:46.310> pull<00:02:47.310> off<00:02:47.489> and<00:02:47.910> now<00:02:48.750> I'm<00:02:48.840> laying<00:02:49.049> on<00:02:49.200> the

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
you pull off and now I'm laying on the

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:51.229 
you pull off and now I'm laying on the
dresser<00:02:49.680> quite<00:02:49.980> thick<00:02:50.370> the<00:02:50.610> sticker<00:02:50.849> you<00:02:51.090> lay

00:02:51.229 --> 00:02:51.239 
dresser quite thick the sticker you lay

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:52.759 
dresser quite thick the sticker you lay
it<00:02:51.390> the<00:02:51.510> longer<00:02:51.810> you've<00:02:51.930> got<00:02:52.110> to<00:02:52.260> play<00:02:52.500> around

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
it the longer you've got to play around

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:57.229 
it the longer you've got to play around
and<00:02:55.400> because<00:02:56.400> obviously<00:02:56.549> it's<00:02:56.910> not<00:02:57.000> going<00:02:57.180> to

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
and because obviously it's not going to

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:00.020 
and because obviously it's not going to
dry<00:02:57.450> very<00:02:57.480> quickly<00:02:57.959> on<00:02:58.230> you<00:02:58.410> and<00:02:59.030> obviously

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:00.030 
dry very quickly on you and obviously

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.449 
dry very quickly on you and obviously
the<00:03:00.510> key<00:03:00.690> you<00:03:00.780> lay<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.140> the<00:03:01.980> less<00:03:02.160> you're<00:03:02.340> going

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
the key you lay it the less you're going

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.580 
the key you lay it the less you're going
to<00:03:02.580> see<00:03:02.730> the<00:03:02.849> background<00:03:03.030> underneath<00:03:03.720> as<00:03:03.989> well

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.110 

put<00:03:07.590> it<00:03:07.709> in<00:03:07.799> with<00:03:07.890> my<00:03:08.040> bottle<00:03:10.579> so<00:03:11.579> just<00:03:11.850> spread

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
put it in with my bottle so just spread

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.810 
put it in with my bottle so just spread
it<00:03:12.150> around<00:03:12.359> until<00:03:13.170> everything<00:03:13.769> is<00:03:13.799> covered

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:16.820 

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.490 

and<00:03:17.820> you're<00:03:18.329> going<00:03:18.480> to<00:03:18.540> get<00:03:18.630> some<00:03:18.870> really<00:03:19.290> cool

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.500 
and you're going to get some really cool

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.180 
and you're going to get some really cool
effects<00:03:21.019> with<00:03:22.019> the<00:03:22.440> thing<00:03:22.650> that's<00:03:22.859> underneath

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 
effects with the thing that's underneath

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:25.490 
effects with the thing that's underneath
I<00:03:23.519> think<00:03:23.730> it<00:03:23.850> looks<00:03:24.030> better<00:03:24.299> where's<00:03:25.290> the

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:25.500 
I think it looks better where's the

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:27.470 
I think it looks better where's the
amount<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.859> colors<00:03:26.220> that<00:03:26.459> you<00:03:26.579> use<00:03:26.880> underneath

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:27.480 
amount of colors that you use underneath

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:28.819 
amount of colors that you use underneath
which<00:03:27.750> is<00:03:27.900> why<00:03:28.049> I<00:03:28.079> was<00:03:28.230> trying<00:03:28.470> to<00:03:28.530> go<00:03:28.620> through

00:03:28.819 --> 00:03:28.829 
which is why I was trying to go through

00:03:28.829 --> 00:03:31.430 
which is why I was trying to go through
the<00:03:28.950> whole<00:03:29.100> pack<00:03:29.459> of<00:03:29.790> those<00:03:30.359> oil<00:03:30.630> pastels<00:03:31.170> and

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.440 
the whole pack of those oil pastels and

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.259 
the whole pack of those oil pastels and
it's<00:03:31.769> also<00:03:31.950> why<00:03:32.190> the<00:03:32.250> oil<00:03:32.489> pastels<00:03:32.970> are<00:03:33.090> great

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
it's also why the oil pastels are great

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.940 
it's also why the oil pastels are great
for<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:33.480> because<00:03:33.720> that<00:03:34.079> pack<00:03:34.680> is<00:03:34.799> really

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
for this because that pack is really

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.220 
for this because that pack is really
cheap<00:03:35.310> so<00:03:36.180> doesn't<00:03:36.389> matter<00:03:36.660> how<00:03:36.780> much<00:03:36.900> you<00:03:36.959> lay

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
cheap so doesn't matter how much you lay

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.740 
cheap so doesn't matter how much you lay
on<00:03:37.260> you<00:03:37.560> don't<00:03:37.709> care<00:03:38.180> it's<00:03:39.180> a<00:03:39.239> really<00:03:39.480> cheap

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
on you don't care it's a really cheap

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:44.120 
on you don't care it's a really cheap
pack<00:03:41.090> okay<00:03:42.170> if<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.319> want<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.560> have<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:43.829> bit<00:03:44.100> of

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
write it writing with these because

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.959 
write it writing with these because
there's<00:04:07.079> a<00:04:07.260> variety<00:04:07.650> of<00:04:07.980> edges<00:04:08.400> it<00:04:08.549> can<00:04:08.760> use

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:08.969 
there's a variety of edges it can use

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:17.689 
there's a variety of edges it can use
you<00:04:09.150> can<00:04:09.329> create<00:04:09.569> quite<00:04:09.810> fat<00:04:10.200> quite<00:04:11.189> thin<00:04:16.699> yeah

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
you can create quite fat quite thin yeah

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.879 
you can create quite fat quite thin yeah
so<00:04:18.000> you<00:04:18.060> can<00:04:18.389> make<00:04:18.870> it<00:04:19.079> really<00:04:19.259> thin<00:04:19.680> if<00:04:19.799> you

00:04:19.879 --> 00:04:19.889 
so you can make it really thin if you

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:21.770 
so you can make it really thin if you
want<00:04:20.039> a<00:04:20.100> thin<00:04:20.340> line<00:04:20.579> or<00:04:21.329> you<00:04:21.449> can<00:04:21.630> make<00:04:21.750> it

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
want a thin line or you can make it

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:26.870 
want a thin line or you can make it
really<00:04:22.139> fat<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:24.780> also<00:04:25.740> you<00:04:26.070> get<00:04:26.370> gathered

really fat and also you get gathered

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.629 
really fat and also you get gathered
gesso<00:04:27.810> one<00:04:27.990> of<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> things<00:04:28.380> so<00:04:29.009> if<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.220> wanted

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:34.139 
take it off of the brush and cover it

00:04:34.139 --> 00:04:35.960 
take it off of the brush and cover it
over<00:04:34.289> you<00:04:34.710> can<00:04:34.740> do<00:04:35.009> this<00:04:35.190> as<00:04:35.340> many<00:04:35.460> times<00:04:35.610> as

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
over you can do this as many times as

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.659 
over you can do this as many times as
you<00:04:36.090> want<00:04:36.210> until<00:04:36.419> the<00:04:36.720> gesso<00:04:37.110> dries<00:04:37.770> up<00:04:38.099> now

you want until the gesso dries up now
this<00:04:38.880> jagged<00:04:39.210> edge<00:04:39.509> looks<00:04:39.780> pretty<00:04:40.080> cool<00:04:40.320> cut

00:04:40.969 --> 00:04:40.979 
this jagged edge looks pretty cool cut

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.050 
this jagged edge looks pretty cool cut
something<00:04:41.190> like<00:04:41.430> this<00:04:41.610> out<00:04:41.759> of<00:04:41.789> bit<00:04:42.030> of

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:42.060 
something like this out of bit of

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:48.680 
something like this out of bit of
cardboard<00:04:44.570> quite<00:04:45.570> like<00:04:45.750> that<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.880> these<00:04:48.419> are

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:48.690 
cardboard quite like that and these are

00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:50.540 
cardboard quite like that and these are
really<00:04:48.930> cool<00:04:49.110> these<00:04:49.289> brush<00:04:49.530> stencils<00:04:50.190> because

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
really cool these brush stencils because

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.129 
really cool these brush stencils because
they<00:04:50.669> give<00:04:50.820> you<00:04:50.910> a<00:04:50.970> kind<00:04:51.330> of<00:04:51.479> like<00:04:51.599> an<00:04:51.780> imprint

00:04:52.129 --> 00:04:52.139 
they give you a kind of like an imprint

00:04:52.139 --> 00:04:54.110 
they give you a kind of like an imprint
effect<00:04:52.530> doesn't<00:04:53.130> take<00:04:53.340> off<00:04:53.520> all<00:04:53.699> the<00:04:53.820> gesso

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:54.120 
effect doesn't take off all the gesso

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:58.550 
effect doesn't take off all the gesso
completely<00:04:56.780> but<00:04:57.780> if<00:04:58.020> you<00:04:58.110> just<00:04:58.259> squish<00:04:58.500> it

00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:58.560 
completely but if you just squish it

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:07.100 
completely but if you just squish it
down<00:05:03.710> you<00:05:04.710> get<00:05:04.889> kind<00:05:05.160> of<00:05:05.250> an<00:05:05.400> imprint<00:05:05.960> which<00:05:06.960> I

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:07.110 
down you get kind of an imprint which I

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:09.649 
down you get kind of an imprint which I
think<00:05:07.320> pretty<00:05:07.710> cool<00:05:08.039> just<00:05:08.909> like<00:05:09.180> an<00:05:09.330> embossed

00:05:09.649 --> 00:05:09.659 
think pretty cool just like an embossed

00:05:09.659 --> 00:05:13.670 
think pretty cool just like an embossed
effect<00:05:09.900> a<00:05:11.599> pen<00:05:12.599> you<00:05:12.810> can<00:05:12.840> do<00:05:13.139> all<00:05:13.349> I'm<00:05:13.560> getting

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
effect a pen you can do all I'm getting

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:15.379 
effect a pen you can do all I'm getting
messy<00:05:13.949> to<00:05:14.400> do<00:05:14.520> quite<00:05:14.699> a<00:05:14.729> bit<00:05:14.820> with<00:05:14.940> the<00:05:15.060> usual

00:05:15.379 --> 00:05:15.389 
messy to do quite a bit with the usual

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:17.060 
messy to do quite a bit with the usual
pen<00:05:15.630> like<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.930> pen<00:05:16.110> lid<00:05:16.320> you<00:05:16.470> can<00:05:16.530> use<00:05:16.770> again

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:17.070 
pen like the pen lid you can use again

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.060 
pen like the pen lid you can use again
thin<00:05:17.580> lines<00:05:18.470> or<00:05:19.470> flat<00:05:20.010> line<00:05:20.250> and<00:05:21.680> the<00:05:22.680> bottom

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:23.070 
thin lines or flat line and the bottom

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:27.500 
thin lines or flat line and the bottom
of<00:05:23.220> them<00:05:23.460> where<00:05:24.180> the<00:05:24.360> thing<00:05:24.870> is<00:05:25.020> often<00:05:26.510> I've

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
of them where the thing is often I've

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:29.000 
of them where the thing is often I've
made<00:05:27.750> the<00:05:27.930> gesture<00:05:28.199> a<00:05:28.320> little<00:05:28.560> bit<00:05:28.650> too<00:05:28.800> thick

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:29.010 
made the gesture a little bit too thick

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.920 
made the gesture a little bit too thick
on<00:05:29.159> this<00:05:29.280> one<00:05:29.460> to<00:05:29.610> see<00:05:29.820> but<00:05:30.300> there's<00:05:30.449> kind<00:05:30.659> of<00:05:30.840> a

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
on this one to see but there's kind of a

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.730 
on this one to see but there's kind of a
little<00:05:31.080> circle<00:05:32.240> on<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.840> bottom<00:05:33.870> which<00:05:34.590> will

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:34.740 
little circle on the bottom which will

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:37.330 
little circle on the bottom which will
give<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:34.919> kind<00:05:35.070> of<00:05:35.190> a<00:05:35.310> little<00:05:35.400> circle<00:05:35.880> effect

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
give you kind of a little circle effect

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.249 
give you kind of a little circle effect
and<00:05:39.860> straws<00:05:40.860> really<00:05:41.789> really<00:05:42.030> pointy<00:05:42.479> end<00:05:42.599> make

00:05:43.249 --> 00:05:43.259 
and straws really really pointy end make

00:05:43.259 --> 00:05:46.629 
and straws really really pointy end make
really<00:05:43.650> really<00:05:43.889> precise<00:05:44.280> lines<00:05:44.669> with<00:05:44.970> this

00:05:46.629 --> 00:05:46.639 
really really precise lines with this

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:56.270 
really really precise lines with this
teeny<00:05:47.639> teeny<00:05:47.940> tiny<00:05:48.330> round<00:05:48.570> lines<00:05:48.960> too<00:05:49.229> right

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:56.280 

00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:58.550 

right<00:05:57.000> I<00:05:57.180> really<00:05:57.600> like<00:05:57.750> these<00:05:57.930> two<00:05:57.990> results

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
right I really like these two results

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.600 
right I really like these two results
because<00:05:59.010> this<00:05:59.760> stump<00:06:00.150> here<00:06:01.460> has<00:06:02.460> a<00:06:02.490> very

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
because this stump here has a very

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.310 
because this stump here has a very
different<00:06:03.000> effect<00:06:03.090> to<00:06:03.450> a<00:06:03.480> firm<00:06:03.840> stamp<00:06:04.200> because

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:04.320 
different effect to a firm stamp because

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.770 
different effect to a firm stamp because
the<00:06:04.560> phone<00:06:04.740> stamp<00:06:05.070> has<00:06:05.250> a<00:06:05.280> very<00:06:05.780> larger

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:06.780 
the phone stamp has a very larger

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.150 
the phone stamp has a very larger
surface<00:06:07.200> area<00:06:07.710> and<00:06:07.980> this<00:06:08.220> has<00:06:08.460> pointy<00:06:09.060> bits

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:10.160 
surface area and this has pointy bits

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.860 
surface area and this has pointy bits
you<00:06:11.160> can<00:06:11.340> get<00:06:11.490> precise<00:06:13.790> images<00:06:14.790> think<00:06:15.780> I've

00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:15.870 
you can get precise images think I've

00:06:15.870 --> 00:06:17.360 
you can get precise images think I've
laid<00:06:16.020> this<00:06:16.169> just<00:06:16.470> on<00:06:16.620> a<00:06:16.650> little<00:06:16.770> bit<00:06:16.980> too<00:06:17.130> thick

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:17.370 
laid this just on a little bit too thick

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:18.879 
laid this just on a little bit too thick
on<00:06:17.520> this<00:06:17.700> one

00:06:18.879 --> 00:06:18.889 
on this one

00:06:18.889 --> 00:06:22.610 
on this one
note<00:06:19.889> to<00:06:20.070> self<00:06:20.690> note<00:06:21.690> to<00:06:21.870> you<00:06:21.990> guys<00:06:22.200> don't<00:06:22.530> make

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:22.620 
note to self note to you guys don't make

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:23.990 
note to self note to you guys don't make
it<00:06:22.710> quite<00:06:22.950> so<00:06:23.160> thick<00:06:23.190> because<00:06:23.580> what<00:06:23.700> I<00:06:23.730> just

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:24.000 
it quite so thick because what I just

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.040 
it quite so thick because what I just
did<00:06:24.180> and<00:06:25.520> then<00:06:26.520> these<00:06:26.700> ones<00:06:26.940> they<00:06:27.570> don't<00:06:27.810> take

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
did and then these ones they don't take

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.990 
did and then these ones they don't take
off<00:06:28.260> the<00:06:28.500> gesso<00:06:28.919> it<00:06:29.100> just<00:06:29.400> gives<00:06:29.640> you<00:06:29.760> a<00:06:29.790> like<00:06:29.970> a

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
off the gesso it just gives you a like a

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:38.140 
off the gesso it just gives you a like a
little<00:06:30.330> print

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:38.150 

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:40.490 

so<00:06:39.150> it's<00:06:39.630> really<00:06:39.810> cool<00:06:40.050> and<00:06:40.230> then<00:06:40.320> if<00:06:40.440> you

00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:40.500 
so it's really cool and then if you

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:48.910 
so it's really cool and then if you
don't<00:06:40.680> like<00:06:40.830> it<00:06:42.620> just<00:06:43.620> wipe<00:06:43.920> it<00:06:44.130> all<00:06:44.310> off<00:06:47.030> and

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:48.920 
don't like it just wipe it all off and

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:52.100 
don't like it just wipe it all off and
I'd<00:06:49.920> say<00:06:50.280> you<00:06:50.340> could<00:06:50.550> probably<00:06:50.690> keep<00:06:51.690> going

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:52.110 
I'd say you could probably keep going

00:06:52.110 --> 00:06:54.440 
I'd say you could probably keep going
that<00:06:52.980> the<00:06:53.100> gesture<00:06:53.460> will<00:06:53.550> probably<00:06:54.060> begin<00:06:54.210> to

00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:54.450 
that the gesture will probably begin to

00:06:54.450 --> 00:06:56.150 
that the gesture will probably begin to
start<00:06:54.690> clogging<00:06:55.110> and<00:06:55.200> drying<00:06:55.560> a<00:06:55.740> little<00:06:56.010> bit

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160 
start clogging and drying a little bit

00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:01.880 
start clogging and drying a little bit
after<00:06:56.610> about<00:06:57.710> four<00:06:58.710> or<00:06:58.740> five<00:06:59.040> goes<00:06:59.340> and<00:07:00.650> if<00:07:01.650> you

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:01.890 
after about four or five goes and if you

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:05.390 
after about four or five goes and if you
want<00:07:02.130> to<00:07:02.370> what<00:07:02.610> you<00:07:02.730> can<00:07:03.060> do<00:07:03.450> is<00:07:04.040> it<00:07:05.040> can<00:07:05.070> have<00:07:05.370> a

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:05.400 
want to what you can do is it can have a

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:07.780 
want to what you can do is it can have a
premeditated<00:07:06.240> picture<00:07:06.750> in<00:07:06.870> mind<00:07:07.080> to<00:07:07.380> create

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:07.790 
premeditated picture in mind to create

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:16.300 
premeditated picture in mind to create
so<00:07:08.790> here<00:07:09.090> I<00:07:09.710> drew<00:07:10.710> our<00:07:11.040> lovely<00:07:11.520> Union<00:07:11.910> Jack<00:07:12.500> and

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:16.310 

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.610 

over<00:07:17.310> the<00:07:17.400> top<00:07:17.640> did<00:07:17.940> this<00:07:18.120> gesso<00:07:18.630> and<00:07:18.840> I<00:07:19.380> mainly

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:19.620 
over the top did this gesso and I mainly

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:23.840 
over the top did this gesso and I mainly
used<00:07:20.070> this<00:07:20.550> for<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.860> scratchy<00:07:22.860> bits<00:07:23.190> and<00:07:23.669> then

00:07:23.840 --> 00:07:23.850 
used this for the scratchy bits and then

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:28.280 
used this for the scratchy bits and then
