00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.250
 hi friends of today's video we 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:07.710
 we start a series of video sketching our 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:09.389
 fishing first became my plot 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.200
 acquaintance targeted angling 

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:13.230
 on back 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.119
 watch our video report 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.400
 catching rotan at first glance 

00:00:16.119 --> 00:00:20.980
 It seems too simple and not even 

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.230
 interesting so this nine out of ten 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.950
 passersby asking you about the successes 

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.039
 fishing 

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:29.170
 however catching rotan on spinning classes 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.150
 very interesting extremely enticing 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:33.400
 before heading to the pond 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:35.830
 near his home, and had not even 

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.500
 representations of the presence of fish in his plans 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:39.699
 there was only the exploration of the water area I catch 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.739
 tried two snap 

00:00:39.699 --> 00:00:43.860
 involving the use of different 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:46.809
 silicone baits and also to drink 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:47.530
 suddenly began a photo fishing line attached 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.320
 hook 

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:52.989
 and below is compressed a small sinker of cherry 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:55.090
 I fished with a half gram weight however 

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.879
 as is often the case for catching 

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.370
 dictates the reservoir itself fishing on this 

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.920
 pond is no exception catching with 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:05.710
 each step is almost impossible then 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.600
 the load then the bait constantly clings 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:11.050
 a large amount of grass and other things 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:30.700
 trash catch the first kind at i am true 

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:33.640
 managed later I switched to a snap 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.250
 which is called go out and just dialing 

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:39.250
 Popularity in Russia it for given 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:42.430
 conditions fits just perfect all that 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.380
 you need this hook 6 or 8 numbers by 

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:46.750
 international classification with a wide 

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.170
 and rightly so, the worm of edible silicone 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.579
 2 to 4 inches 

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.820
 pierce it in the middle and 

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:57.310
 your tooling is ready i used 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.380
 bass worms 5 or 6 inches long 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:01.869
 which cut into several pieces 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.240
 sizes were different but with 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.479
 time and settled on larger ones 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 bait wiring is a 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
 alternation of different wiggles 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.130
 twitches with pauses most 

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.010
 poklevok 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.500
 occurs at the beginning of a pause when the bait 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.630
 comes close to the surface and then 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.260
 again begins to slowly fall into 

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:24.140
 grass window 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.329
 it was the light that made the best possible 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.000
 result for 4 visits to reservoirs 

00:02:26.329 --> 00:02:31.819
 except that rotan behaved every day 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.799
 quite differently sometimes 

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.709
 a small fish was enough for a couple of seconds 

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:38.780
 to bury the worm securely in 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.209
 another time the whole Votan was naughty 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.780
 uncertainly sucked the worm for 10 seconds 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.690
 and then the 15 most important are patience and 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:50.209
 wait for the right moment and sweeps what 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:52.459
 concerns the timing of the cover then in 

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.890
 the whole catch rotana succeeded in any 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:57.950
 the time however was traced in the evening 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.379
 explicit activation of bite followed 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.590
 on almost every fishing trip 

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:05.629
 came out very gambling by the way because 

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:08.120
 most often fishing is done on 

00:03:05.629 --> 00:03:09.769
 Minor depth would highly recommend 

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:12.319
 grab polarized glasses 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:15.170
 you can see firsthand 

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:19.389
 everything that happens here is visual 

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:19.389
 component comes first 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.610
 ahead of us waiting for a lot of interesting 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:09.220
 fishing
