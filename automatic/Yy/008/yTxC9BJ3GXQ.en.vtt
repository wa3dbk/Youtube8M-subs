00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.960
 there were people as well as I promised them 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.090
 the previous video 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:12.450
 let's talk briefly about 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.950
 the benefits considered by many 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.490
 experts from just ingesting if from site 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.310
 on the knees 

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:24.430
 so you remember it with the video 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.660
 related to olive oil already 

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.400
 in case they have a lot of benefits 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:29.400
 then we do not imagine 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.950
 small detail the beneficial ones not 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:37.329
 can be only 7 olives per day what 

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:40.600
 ideal of course is that the 7 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.300
 olives are consumed in a way 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.750
 varied not maybe directly 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:50.809
 of course it does not discriminate between 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.430
 or without bone in green strips or pieces 

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:54.320
 or black there are different types of 

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.540
 olives with different colors and for 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.970
 all tastes 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.980
 which is also used of course for a 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:03.650
 countless dishes that we can 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:06.170
 find specifically also in 

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:08.490
 a lot in winter 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.610
 and in summer 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.890
 it is a food to eat all year 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.360
 this food is consumed mostly 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.530
 as an appetizer of course in a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.530
 minced now enters dictates 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.630
 is the raw material of course 

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.580
 olive oil and they are a food 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.700
 healthy with a high value 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.660
 nutritional that has 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:32.090
 very important health benefits 

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:36.460
 and to maintain a healthy diet and 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:39.140
 balanced and omega 7 an agent 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.070
 because in this case we have so 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.870
 a making an olive and here we have 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:48.870
 manipulated sorry 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.410
 peeled almonds plums and raisins 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:54.090
 grape your small small foods 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.070
 food but they have a lot of 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.110
 benefits for our health after 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.540
 later we are going to talk about raisins 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.220
 of grape and also of plums like 

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.650
 also the almonds that I think is 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:07.650
 desirable but we will reinforce that part 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:10.149
 because they are those little foods but 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:13.000
 powerful 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:15.380
 then the benefits of the olive 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:19.430
 of table 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:21.890
 let's go to that so much that they are nutritious 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:24.620
 and for its mineral-rich content 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:27.910
 like sodium potassium magnesium and iron 

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:30.420
 phosphorus and sun 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:33.700
 more complete than that the truth 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:37.350
 contributes to the content cut of 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:40.600
 Calcium to the body are antioxidants 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.430
 thanks to your group B vitamins and 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.430
 his promises mines of the group to 

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:49.650
 they provide amino acids and vitamins 

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:52.450
 essentials are super necessary for 

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:55.450
 our daily life 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.190
 They contain oleic acid that has 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.760
 beneficial properties to protect 

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.439
 the bone heart 

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.829
 if you get olives because we're 

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:06.439
 protected from any kind of thing that 

00:03:03.829 --> 00:03:08.900
 give us to the heart there is a great 

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:10.710
 reality with more than 90 types of speech 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.890
 different signs 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.010
 It is very affordable and a very ingredient 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.390
 suitable in typical summer recipes 

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:20.820
 like for example the salad now that 

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:23.910
 it sounds social of summer people 7 

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.440
 olives per day, keep it in mind if 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.320
 they eat a little bit more, they are not going to 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.850
 do wrong be careful not to overdo it 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:35.240
 in the consumption olives as I did 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:40.000
 can also of course as said is 

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:43.250
 You can taste it without expensive or stuffed 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:46.640
 black green integral locks villena 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:49.040
 what it will be like are these little foods 

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:52.000
 that they have the truth a lot of 

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:55.600
 benefits a lot of benefits 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:59.480
 we briefly review then the summary 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:02.660
 something to the productive contains a visual 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:06.070
 essential amino acids minerals and 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:09.040
 vitamins and are an essential component 

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:11.349
 in the diet 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.200
 until with half of the seven 

00:04:11.349 --> 00:04:16.620
 olives per day diet the reality is 

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:19.169
 one more recommendation of daily intake 

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:21.579
 budget angle when they could 

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:23.150
 it really is not that they have a high value 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.860
 caloric 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:27.139
 and why do I say that we should not exceed 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.500
 with this for the simple fact that 

00:04:27.139 --> 00:04:32.180
 has a lot of sodium so people are 

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.970
 a part of any doubt the 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.050
 Comment or suggestion of course 

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:39.090
 shortly you know where 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:41.520
 and good with this I say goodbye to eat 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.849
 oil an agent and now a video about 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:43.849
 this
