00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:11.910
 April 12, 2015 

00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:14.920
 This time can not be brought in with your luggage, etc. and objections in the travel destination 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:19.410
 We will introduce how to arrange hair 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:19.410
 It is collection to use this time 

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.560
 Rubber 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:27.680
 And pins 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:32.029
 It is a simple half-up style that can be done 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:38.870
 It's easy to do, but it looks a bit fancy 

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:42.230
 Please remember if you are going to travel 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.890
 First temple at the beginning 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.890
 From about 

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:50.440
 Because it is not style 

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:53.160
 I will take both sides with this feeling 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.680
 It feels like this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.640
 If you take Zensai 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.640
 Fasten a rubber 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.019
 Once it stopped with a rubber Seriously 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:07.570
 I will break down a little 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:11.070
 If you pinch a hair bundle and pull it 

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:11.070
 To be high here 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:17.060
 Little by little 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:18.480
 Pull up 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:20.200
 Next to the 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:23.280
 10 laps 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.280
 I will do during 

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:27.210
 If this island 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:34.790
 this 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:38.330
 Divide it like this and pass the hair bundle in your heart this time 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.409
 If it passes like this 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:42.670
 Between rubber and shush 

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.159
 Pull 

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:47.119
 Contact The Guitar 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:47.119
 While picking 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.100
 There is an error 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.250
 Behind 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.860
 In a feeling of saying 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:02:00.030
 Pull it back and forth 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.000
 Next , during this collection etc. 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.750
 In the same way 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.750
 Front and back, right and left 

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:09.030
 Pull out the tuft 

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:19.060
 I will in this kind of feeling 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:21.030
 But the second shot I'm kinda not withdraw behind after the drawer front, rear, left and right in this kind of feeling 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.030
 To 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.280
 Around 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:26.000
 Mommy 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:29.900
 With this hair tip 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.330
 In the part of the root where this rubber has been stuck 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.080
 Round 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:36.740
 Rutne- 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.010
 It will turn 

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:41.540
 Of hair the way 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.140
 Indigo 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:44.140
 Stop 

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:51.690
 Enter with pin 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:54.130
 Or marquee full around Japan 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:56.400
 If you stop using it 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.840
 Finally, balance Oa 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.840
 Went trimmed raised 

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.770
 It is a feeling 

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.060
 The future is 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.690
 That poor Palmer in advance 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.220
 There is a thing called poor perm but 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.140
 I will keep it in mind 

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.630
 This is the last way 

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:29.390
 Just pull out the tufts 

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:32.140
 If good, since it is possible to issue a par Mappoi curl of Yurufuwana feeling 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.480
 poor palmer on youtube 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:42.000
 Get me a search 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:42.000
 I think it would be better to combine the Limbo Palmer with this method 

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:47.690
 If good, such as those to travel from now 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.100
 try it 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:51.100
 This time was over
