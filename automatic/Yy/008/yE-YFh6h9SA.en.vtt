00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:07.190
 the tank arrived at the game with peñarol 

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:09.170
 after a defeat against phoenix the 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.230
 coalman came to match in their 

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.740
 last two presentations the first 

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:17.180
 once they fought in all their history 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.790
 plays in the Olympic champions in the 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:21.590

 this free kick pablo migliore that in 

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:25.220
 the times caught the ball was going to 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.630
 complicate the Argentine goalkeeper who 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:31.820
 attack in the spot because here the ball 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.760
 it bounces and the one that ends it saving me 

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:37.670
 and free is darío rodríguez not look 

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.500
 I can stop and Rodriguez arrives 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.420
 point it to the corner shot the ball will 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:45.200
 goes very close to the stick of the right hand 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.300
 of my glory that is halfway there 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.650
 it is true falls gonzalo saw the 

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.340
 definition is de miguel murillo after 

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:54.680
 from the pass to the middle of joel burgueño 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:57.370
 there is no need the Colombian soccer player 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:01.600
 that defines crossed 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:02.860
 my glory is thrown covering his load 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.060
 football is known as the first 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.450
 stick in an action like that 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:12.310
 the question is that it defines the second 

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:15.130
 murillo and 1 to 0 was the tank 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:17.560
 this was the only one that had peñarol in the 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:19.600
 first time fabian estoyanoff hit him 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.189
 crossed 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.460
 after a play they had armed 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:26.740
 Between juan manuel olivera andrés rodales 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.000
 and the aforementioned and jhonny da silva se 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.810
 I was left with the ball 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.030
 the tank was going to have this headbutt of 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.850
 Miguel Murillo after the center that 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:41.700
 arrives from the left goes very close 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 of the pole of the left-handed rod of greater shot 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:47.270
 free for Antonio Pacheco 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.880
 the archer gives silva that the band at 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.590
 corner the ball did not seem so 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.750
 complicated but resolved the goalkeeper well 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:56.090
 looking at it 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.710
 towards one side he ended up losing 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.580
 by the bottom of the corner tub 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.860
 another one to peñarol here it bounces 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:04.870
 the firing of estoyanoff to da silva that 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.290
 It is good to put a breast 

00:02:04.870 --> 00:02:10.060
 ball and I knew I was going to chop it before 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.819
 look at the minute 78 felipe 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.060
 rodríguez 

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:16.290
 hooks gives you left-handed and you can not 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.349
 avoid the corner kick but that 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.359
 saved the fall of its frame until a 

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:23.359
 six of the end this happens 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.390
 comes a free kick by Antonio Pacheco 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:30.280
 at the second post appears sergio 

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:33.900
 Ortemán sends it to half Juan Manuel 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:36.220
 Olivera Juan Manuel Olivera is the one 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:40.380
 perfectly located was not in ounces 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:44.520
 and in no way do you pull pigeon 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:46.830
 and note the parity center passed sergio 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.540
 Orteman who then sends it to the second 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.940
 pole they say two headers in the area 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.040
 it's a goal many times that 

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.920
 Marcelo Zalayeta's football maxim 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.570
 I would have this pacheco pass 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.180
 estoyanoff the touch to the middle for the 17th 

00:02:57.570 --> 00:03:03.100
 the ball that ends up giving miren 

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:05.320
 you on the crossbar 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:06.790
 entertaining party ended up being about 

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.670
 all the second time since he lifted 

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.540
 pretty peñarol equaled 1 to 1 the 

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.540
 tank and the stain
