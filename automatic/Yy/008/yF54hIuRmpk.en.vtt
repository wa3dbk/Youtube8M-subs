peculiar things about this dance I find
is<00:01:29.869> the<00:01:30.869> point<00:01:31.500> where<00:01:31.829> we<00:01:32.070> step<00:01:32.460> away<00:01:32.700> from

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
is the point where we step away from

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.270 
is the point where we step away from
each<00:01:33.509> other<00:01:33.750> and<00:01:34.079> this<00:01:34.439> happens<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.070> rock

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
each other and this happens on the rock

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.870 
each other and this happens on the rock
step

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
step

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.510

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
too much space between their steps which

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.590 
too much space between their steps which
overextends<00:01:47.460> them<00:01:47.670> and<00:01:47.880> now<00:01:48.270> we're<00:01:48.479> off

doing a rock step so our hand connection

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.690 
doing a rock step so our hand connection
here<00:02:03.960> is<00:02:04.049> critical<00:02:04.290> it's<00:02:05.100> going<00:02:05.369> to<00:02:05.430> fluctuate

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
here is critical it's going to fluctuate

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.839 
here is critical it's going to fluctuate
through<00:02:06.390> here<00:02:06.840> as<00:02:06.990> our<00:02:07.680> connection<00:02:08.369> is<00:02:08.489> hooked

00:02:08.839 --> 00:02:08.849 
through here as our connection is hooked

00:02:08.849 --> 00:02:11.300 
through here as our connection is hooked
together<00:02:09.239> through<00:02:09.539> our<00:02:09.660> fingers<00:02:09.959> here<00:02:10.500> as<00:02:10.619> I

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
together through our fingers here as I

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.340

point out about the swing that's it's
really<00:03:43.110> critical<00:03:43.770> is<00:03:43.980> how<00:03:44.940> we<00:03:45.410> displace<00:03:46.410> our

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
really critical is how we displace our

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.730 
really critical is how we displace our

one two three Rock step ideally the best

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.100 
one two three Rock step ideally the best
way<00:03:58.260> to<00:03:58.290> count<00:03:58.650> that<00:03:58.890> would<00:03:59.040> be<00:03:59.280> one<00:04:00.090> and<00:04:00.420> two

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
way to count that would be one and two

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:03.980

in<00:04:01.440> a<00:04:02.040> triple<00:04:02.460> step<00:04:02.730> there<00:04:03.000> are<00:04:03.120> two<00:04:03.450> beats<00:04:03.780> of

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 
in a triple step there are two beats of

in a triple step there are two beats of
music<00:04:04.230> so<00:04:05.010> as<00:04:05.220> I<00:04:05.370> go<00:04:05.610> there<00:04:05.880> I'm<00:04:06.060> going<00:04:06.360> one<00:04:07.350> and

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
Rock step swing is one of those odd

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.660 
Rock step swing is one of those odd
dances<00:04:14.460> that<00:04:14.910> does<00:04:15.330> not<00:04:15.570> balance<00:04:16.280> it<00:04:17.280> takes

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:17.670 
dances that does not balance it takes

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:20.450 
dances that does not balance it takes
six<00:04:18.090> beats<00:04:18.420> of<00:04:18.630> music<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:19.170> do<00:04:19.320> one<00:04:19.590> basic<00:04:19.830> step

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:20.460 
six beats of music to do one basic step

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.060 
six beats of music to do one basic step
but<00:04:21.120> there<00:04:21.330> are<00:04:21.450> eight<00:04:21.810> beats<00:04:22.169> of<00:04:22.380> music<00:04:22.560> in

00:04:27.130 --> 00:04:27.140 
music so we have to go through our basic

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.410 
music so we have to go through our basic
step<00:04:27.350> three<00:04:27.710> times<00:04:28.040> before<00:04:28.520> the<00:04:28.850> one<00:04:29.120> would

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:29.420 
step three times before the one would

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.110 
step three times before the one would
come<00:04:30.020> back<00:04:30.290> to<00:04:30.650> being<00:04:31.220> at<00:04:31.430> the<00:04:31.550> beginning<00:04:31.910> of
