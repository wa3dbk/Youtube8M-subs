00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:12.460
 The greatest art my dear friends is the great art, but big is small and small is big 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:19.820
 Uh, because big in the end makes small and small in size. Or the other way around 

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.580
 Great art is crap and and small is big, small, big and er 

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:36.380
 That is exactly what we will now have to learn in this wonderful enlightening film about young and old and have to believe in a miraculous way 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.320
 And he means: the frog is a big mouth 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:41.440
 Once, Schnuddel heard someone croaking and croaking down by the pond. As if the whole world belonged to him 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:50.180
 When Schnuddel came there, there was a frog sitting on a stone and that was it, the quack 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:56.220
 What are you quacking? asked Schnuddel. As if the whole world belongs to you 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.400
 Heard me too, croaked the frog 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.500
 How come? asked Schnuddel. Because I am the greatest, the frog quacked 

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.960
 Which biggest? asked Schnuddel 

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:19.980
 For example, in terms of beauty. Because green is the most beautiful color in the world and if that is not the case then prove the opposite 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.700
 Hard to prove. And what else? asked Schnuddel 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:35.780
 As for the long jump, the frog quacked. Because, for example, you can not jump further than me and if so prove it to me 

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:48.880
 Also hard to prove. Or not to prove at all, because Schnuddel almost can not jump, as far as the jump into the distance 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.240
 And then? What else? asked Schnuddel 

00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:03.720
 As for the high jump, the frog quacked. For example, because you can not jump higher and if so prove it 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:11.860
 Which was hard to prove because Schnuddel could not jump well 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.840
 And then on? asked Schnuddel 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:34.300
 Chesting, said the frog. World Champion, for that matter. Or if you can swim better than me, then prove it 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.260
 Nor to prove. Clearly 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.460
 And then? And then? 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:53.780
 Diving, hunting flies, soprano vocals and second voice, poetry and thinking, cycling, whitewater paddling and uh 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.020
 And uh, you have the biggest mouth in the world, called Schnuddel 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.020
 Which you are right about, the frog said and swelled up 

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.040
 The greatest of all, cried Schnuddel 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.960
 What I'm talking about all along, the frog quacked. Always the biggest, for that matter 

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:20.120
 Your mouth is bigger than you are in the whole, cried Schnuddel 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:28.220
 Which proves to you that you are not stupid, croaked the frog. As for the sharp mind and the reasonable insight 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:36.940
 And if that's what I'm supposed to believe, Schnuddel shouted, then open it so that it's so big that I can not see you anymore 

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.760
 Nothing easier than that, the frog croaks in terms of size 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:05:02.540
 And he opened his mouth so far that it was bigger than himself. And choked himself. Path. Forever 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:10.120
 Look, Schnuddel said. That's what happens 

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:13.060
 And he was right
