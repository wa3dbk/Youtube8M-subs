00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:36.580
 the extraordinary 2011 

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.750
 and here I am a nice victory in malaga 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.500
 Alas 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:47.500
 several villages 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.800
 along the agents 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:53.420
 and tonight I forgot the slot machines 

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.420
 so it's true it's a little jaded gasket too but mostly 

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.270
 mandelieu the napoule but if you see 

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:01.790
 frankly in the estrie am glad to have done 

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.640
 this operation with 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.460
 a question there are few people on a bridge winning this planet 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.920
 they can play on a slot machine that bears their name what is it 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.710
 it makes 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.440
 do you see there are few people who can play on unemployment either to 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.250
 expect 

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.290
 but you know what it's like that you had like that 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:23.280
 they want me to wonder if it should be so I do it because of this 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.560
 great buzz and I hope it will bring happiness you see 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.580
 it will be a challenge 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.580
 a black man who will come out of this machine end of the year a lot 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.560
 the original idea was to create machines that are different from 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:35.540
 machines we usually see 

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.480
 create a corner to the image the effigy of someone and then it is representative 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.190
 of these beasts slot machines in emotion 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:43.140
 in his tenth 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.180
 and in this case the door 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.170
 for me who am just a self-evident 

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.740
 I did not know him 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.579
 I got to know him very summarily he received me very 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.270
 sympathetically to los angeles 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.200
 he repeated at the foot on the premise 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.080
 the first league 4a our present 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.960
 he supported the project and I thank him for it's a generous man it's 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.090
 the man of the woman who succeeded I am admiring did not solicited 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.230
 obviously his own talla sylla like that there's not a lot of French 

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.010
 who will do 

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:09.429
 concrete for that today I am neither honoring 

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:12.569
 flattered and I thank you again really 

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:13.939
 - before you leave the field free 

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:16.409
 even the strongest that are waiting for you impatiently 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.779
 almost 

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.189
 a note on 

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:20.489
 beaulieu 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.839
 olive tree is a nice guy on julian assange steve 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:26.079
 time-lagged as I am today 

00:02:26.079 --> 00:02:29.099
 we made the effort to come to my house i do the same thing it's a very nice guy 

00:02:29.099 --> 00:02:30.839
 friendly 

00:02:30.839 --> 00:02:34.569
 and she has today we do not count we're going to bring them back by car from 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:35.959
 things together star 

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:38.959
 so it was very nice a nice guy in montreal 

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:41.829
 a personality in its own right 

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:43.789
 I think we need to go beyond the image 

00:02:43.789 --> 00:02:46.029
 you have to meet the power person who is behind 

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:46.909
 established statistics
