00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.150
 to me 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.110
 such as they were welcome to a 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:11.850
 new video and good guys in this from 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.350
 battle in which we will fight against 

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.969
 zombie pickman so remember that the 

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:16.529
 description of that download link but 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.420
 before starting I want to tell you that 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.340
 If you have an iPhone 4 or equipment 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:21.899
 fourth generation I do not recommend that 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.790
 interest the map because it is very heavy 

00:00:21.899 --> 00:00:25.890
 so then if you have an iphone 4s for 

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:27.689
 up or that is two cores and then 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.610
 that supports everything there so 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:31.079
 frank up boy remember that 

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.420
 we will fight against your vehicle so 

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:36.300
 You can see the sunlight but you can not 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.060
 be outside ok you can not go outside says 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:41.280
 around here, I'm 12, so you can already 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.020
 hear it zombie pickman says it's a 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.330
 which is for one is three players are going 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:47.310
 to become a brave man today so 

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:49.290
 your person here we have a chest which 

00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:51.090
 there's nothing so you can guys ok ya 

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:52.890
 I was testing it and it turns out that we have 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.270
 to put a block of sand over there 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.400
 but there is not so, because they can be here 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 see that we have more information says that 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:01.290
 we can tinker is not an armor of 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.329
 gold just in case but good says good 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.710
 here please read give the rules that 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.540
 do we have this and as the sand 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.970
 It's very good I like it very much 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.670
 that here we have what is a sword 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.369
 of diamond for this part we have 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.710
 gold here we have a breastplate here 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 we have a pair of pants in this other 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.030
 we have some diamond boots that yes 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.189
 that I look like a rainbow 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.110
 I'm scared because I want to kill 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:27.270
 Many man pickman but as I say 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.369
 This map is the guide so much 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.930
 It is recommended that you download it if 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.549
 you have a good device that so 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.369
 around here that we had here 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.070
 we have here is the sand on that part 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.390
 we have the carrot and so it is ok 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.759
 so nothing that we're going to start today 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.110
 with this and then I remember leaving in the 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.690
 comments you know about your bets 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.250
 follow this if you think I will kill some 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:50.640
 ten or about 15 whatever so for 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:53.250
 here we have a few chops I think 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.830
 that the walls of the I'm going to use kay hire 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.630
 since we have chicken so we started 

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:00.149
 with this magners of that luck method 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.369
 of the world and here says rules says no 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.979
 change so change the difficulty to 

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:08.160
 maximum and have armor before 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.470
 start fighting you can keep it 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.660
 or I did not keep it in survival 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.620
 do not escape do not want to because so 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.079
 then here we go boys 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:17.590
 We start with this and remember that 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.610
 you can download it and everything and 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:27.099
 and we go badly so they go for a demon and 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:29.590
 here another clip did not want to start at 

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:32.019
 find this do not explode kripper by 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.000
 please you're going to ruin the map so the 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.110
 sound of the fire that bothers me a lot 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.790
 pussy fuck no no no 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.110
 I do not even know when I 'm going to kill I'm a 

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.420
 little scared if it is not that much so 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.310
 Well, it will begin to be more than 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.980
 all because I'm recording and well I'm going to 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:50.829
 try to kill him they are with lake that the atc 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.540
 He is not an enemy, so what I do not 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:54.010
 like minecraft because you have not me 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.959
 Well, in part it can be good and in 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.120
 bad part is that if you hit a zombie 

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.340
 pizjuán then do not preside over all what 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:02.349
 which is good ok so it can be the 

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:04.209
 PC version so if you hit 167 

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.299
 comes half the world of shadows and that as 

00:03:04.209 --> 00:03:08.590
 great ok here dead here and then no 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.849
 you hear almost nothing from the 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.739
 zombies pickman when he hit them for the 

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:14.310
 reason that there is fire here and 

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.720
 I also have river water so to toño 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.610
 I just want good zombie I want 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:20.890
 creepers and nothing damn is this 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.750
 because I store this so I'm going to 

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.090
 cut the video I'm going to finish when 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.120
 kill us twice ok to kill me two 

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.560
 Sometimes we end up with this and it is a 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:32.380
 very fun map that can serve you 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:34.660
 If you're bored or something for me in 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.920
 I liked that staff a lot and remember that 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.569
 in the description you have the link of 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:40.389
 download next to the information of 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:42.040
 creator speak here damn be because 

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:43.810
 that law of so much even you remove all 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.120
 the graphics and you download everything to make it 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:49.329
 faster since since I did not have a 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:52.090

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:54.579

 hurricane and well as I tell you I had 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:10.239
 the fancy graphics and everything and the distance 

00:04:08.349 --> 00:04:12.700
 of editing to the maximum when suddenly 

00:04:10.239 --> 00:04:13.930
 Well, you believe me, so how do you 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.269
 I say if you do not have a good device 

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:18.729
 so to speak I do not recommend you 

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:20.500
 download what you saw them when you 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.479

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:25.599

 mind seeing a clip is burning 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.780
 Fuck that when they fall because I think it's a 

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.410
 criterion pay for a sand of are 

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:40.540
 victims not by an arena of creepers 

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:41.740
 assigned to see cows boys and I 

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:43.210
 remember that you can also leave a 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.580
 like that motivates me a lot to continue 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:47.050
 day to day with the videos so well 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.930
 seriously I've had a lot of TV in the 

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:52.330
 last days and the sound of them 

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:55.210
 is not stressing seriously now here 

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:56.920
 we are going to look for this we kill him and then 

00:05:55.210 --> 00:05:58.990
 with all this gold I think it was more not 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.540
 I lost everything in the lava thing 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.940

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:06.130
 time to climb also what is a series 

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.840
 that is a zombie arena so it was 

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:10.390
 more or less when we were about 200 sub 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:12.070
 it's 300 I do not know how many we climb 

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:13.540

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:54.570
 just a small fraction since
