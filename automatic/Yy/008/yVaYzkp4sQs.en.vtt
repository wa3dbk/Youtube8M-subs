00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.410
 hello today we are going to learn how to do 

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.730
 centerpieces for a wedding or 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:11.010
 any event where you want 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:13.890
 mark the numbers of the tables as 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:15.930
 You see, it's very simple, it's done with paper and 

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.150
 the result would be a grinder that 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:21.180
 would simulate a flower and everything would be with 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.590
 Home materials good to do 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.180
 our grinders what are we going to 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.310
 need are colorful folios of the 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.130
 that you like more scissors a 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.529
 apparatus of these to make holes a 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 porta mines glue and this already if 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.609
 you want to decorate then put 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.609
 those that are like diamonds 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.149
 The first thing we have to do is 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:46.110
 fold our folio our first 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:48.449
 Folio as if it were a fan 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.300
 trying to make it as straight as possible 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:54.970
 trying to make all the folds are 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:57.629
 of the same size or as close 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.629
 possible 

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:01.650
 Well, we have done our 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.470
 accordion what we will do is make two 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:07.979
 accordions more and once made 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:11.720
 we'll take some scissors and we'll do 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.720
 the rounded tips 

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:21.540
 those on both sides of the three accordion 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.600
 is that we have to do 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:26.960
 then we will fold them by the 

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.960
 half 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.880
 and we will stick the two ends with a 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.880
 glue 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.940
 you can use glue in bar glue 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:45.170
 which you think will be left 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.170
 better fixed 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:52.570
 liquid the one you want 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:56.060
 once we have thrown the glue 

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:57.950
 what we do those styles 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:59.630
 and you see our fan and is already taking 

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.729
 shape 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:05.590
 now one more day all three of it 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.590
 way that we have come together have one 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:12.289
 hitting 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:12.289
 to the sides 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.020
 well then that would be our 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.580
 grinder that as you see I have done 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.920
 pretty big if you want if you stay 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.720
 smaller as each folio you can 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.060
 cut in half then you will have a 

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:37.700
 smaller size so you can only use it 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.890
 to decorate some space but we 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.660
 we are going to add something else for 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.790
 that you can use it for example center 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.680
 of table or water if the tree stops 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.569
 decorate our grinder let's 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:48.850
 make little holes at the edges to 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:54.510
 it 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:54.510
 in each fold we will make a hole 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.209
 so that when they open they look 

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.209
 our little holes 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.250
 Well, as you can see the edges already 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.230
 they would be decorated 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.900
 in one folio apart from another color 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.960
 we are going to use a rose you can 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.580
 make a little circle we 're going 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.190
 do with compass but you can help 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.440
 those of a glass of any surface 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.150
 round that you can mark a little the 

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:24.690
 guide of where you will have to cut 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.690
 OK 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:31.260
 and we cut it 

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.879
 in the center of the circle you can write 

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.790
 what you want then for example we 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:43.219
 we will use it to indicate the tables 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:45.769
 of a wedding then we would put a 1 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:49.010
 for the number that corresponds with the 

00:03:45.769 --> 00:03:50.750
 table where you are going to go located our 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.069
 grinder 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.659
 well, you can decorate it 

00:03:52.069 --> 00:03:56.490
 as you want and we are going to use 

00:03:53.659 --> 00:03:59.270
 some little glitter 

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:02.250
 rhinestones for a bumper 

00:03:59.270 --> 00:04:04.650
 round the number I'll put more together 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:06.370
 more separated and that goes according to 

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.870
 pleasures 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:11.750
 good things like that would be 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:15.260
 and now what we're going to do is paste it 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:17.989
 in the center of our grinder 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.620
 for this we are going to throw glue with 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:26.420
 Care for the back 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:30.490
 and we paste it with care 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:30.490
 slightly filling 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.889
 Well, now we only have to hit him 

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:40.110
 a stick and put it inside a jar 

00:04:37.889 --> 00:04:43.169
 glass vacuum to which we have attached 

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.449
 a satin ribbon and put it on stones or 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:47.639
 some cap of a nice color that 

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:49.110
 that you have at home and as you see 

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:51.419
 Well the result would be quite 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.210
 original and very home and we could 

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:56.780
 put it on the tables of a wedding or in a 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.780
 event
