00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
but obliteration I want to get my hands

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.710 
but obliteration I want to get my hands
on<00:00:44.040> that<00:00:44.100> and<00:00:44.430> get<00:00:44.580> as<00:00:44.670> much<00:00:44.880> experience<00:00:45.360> as<00:00:45.600> I

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:45.720 
on that and get as much experience as I

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:47.330 
on that and get as much experience as I
could<00:00:45.930> while<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.170> had<00:00:46.440> a<00:00:46.470> chance<00:00:46.800> because<00:00:47.010> I

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
could while I had a chance because I

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.370 
could while I had a chance because I
really<00:00:48.030> think<00:00:48.180> that<00:00:48.300> this<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.540> be<00:00:48.990> one<00:00:49.350> of

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:49.380 
really think that this could be one of

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:51.320 
really think that this could be one of
like<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.740> new<00:00:49.950> great<00:00:50.520> game<00:00:50.940> modes<00:00:51.180> that

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
chance to play obliteration for quite a

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.560 
chance to play obliteration for quite a
bit<00:01:16.530> and<00:01:16.650> after<00:01:17.580> perusing<00:01:17.730> time<00:01:18.090> on<00:01:18.270> it<00:01:18.450> I

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
bit and after perusing time on it I

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.540 
bit and after perusing time on it I
actually<00:01:18.870> had<00:01:19.290> a<00:01:19.320> few<00:01:19.530> days<00:01:19.680> reflect<00:01:20.100> on<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.400> at

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:20.550 
actually had a few days reflect on it at

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.040 
actually had a few days reflect on it at
this<00:01:20.730> point<00:01:21.000> you<00:01:21.180> know<00:01:21.210> since<00:01:21.390> been<00:01:21.570> ended<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.050 
this point you know since been ended I

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:24.350 
this point you know since been ended I
don't<00:01:22.560> want<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.770> throw<00:01:22.950> a<00:01:23.190> few<00:01:23.520> suggestions<00:01:24.030> I

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
don't want to throw a few suggestions I

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.580 
don't want to throw a few suggestions I
think<00:01:24.600> could<00:01:24.720> actually<00:01:24.870> make<00:01:25.110> the<00:01:25.260> game<00:01:25.440> Oh

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
think could actually make the game Oh

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.410 
think could actually make the game Oh
better<00:01:25.860> I'm<00:01:26.130> not<00:01:26.580> saying<00:01:26.909> that<00:01:26.970> didn't<00:01:27.300> like

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
better I'm not saying that didn't like

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.060 
better I'm not saying that didn't like
it<00:01:27.540> far<00:01:27.780> from<00:01:27.870> the<00:01:28.020> truth<00:01:28.229> but<00:01:28.680> to<00:01:28.920> think

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
it far from the truth but to think

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:30.500 
it far from the truth but to think
there's<00:01:29.310> some<00:01:29.490> room<00:01:29.610> for<00:01:29.760> improvement<00:01:29.820> yeah

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:30.510 
there's some room for improvement yeah

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.899 
there's some room for improvement yeah
that's<00:01:30.870> not<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> case<00:01:31.260> to<00:01:31.470> go<00:01:31.500> for<00:01:31.909> everything

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
that's not the case to go for everything

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.100 
that's not the case to go for everything
but<00:01:33.150> for<00:01:33.360> the<00:01:33.420> vast<00:01:33.450> majority<00:01:33.659> yeah

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
but for the vast majority yeah

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.450 
but for the vast majority yeah
everything<00:01:34.530> could<00:01:34.620> always<00:01:34.890> use<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.100> little<00:01:35.370> bit

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
everything could always use a little bit

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.850 
everything could always use a little bit
of<00:01:35.490> improvement<00:01:35.700> so<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.840> opinion<00:01:37.229> first<00:01:37.680> off

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
of improvement so my opinion first off

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.260 
of improvement so my opinion first off
some<00:01:38.040> of<00:01:38.070> things<00:01:38.190> I've<00:01:38.370> changes<00:01:38.760> I<00:01:38.909> would<00:01:39.060> put

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
some of things I've changes I would put

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.300 
some of things I've changes I would put
a<00:01:39.299> delay<00:01:39.780> on<00:01:39.990> showing<00:01:40.380> the<00:01:40.590> bomb<00:01:40.860> holders

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
a delay on showing the bomb holders

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.399 
a delay on showing the bomb holders
position<00:01:41.820> that<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.540> the<00:01:42.630> one<00:01:42.870> thing<00:01:42.900> that<00:01:43.229> I

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409 
position that is the one thing that I

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.100 
position that is the one thing that I
found<00:01:43.620> to<00:01:43.830> be<00:01:43.860> very<00:01:44.180> very<00:01:45.180> annoying<00:01:45.659> was<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
found to be very very annoying was the

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.990 
found to be very very annoying was the
moment<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.380> picked<00:01:46.560> up<00:01:46.650> the<00:01:46.770> bomb<00:01:46.979> I<00:01:47.220> was<00:01:47.850> on

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:48.000 
moment I picked up the bomb I was on

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.550 
moment I picked up the bomb I was on
everyone's<00:01:48.299> map<00:01:48.570> was<00:01:48.900> on<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.020> mini-map<00:01:49.229> and

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
everyone's map was on the mini-map and

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.530 
everyone's map was on the mini-map and
they<00:01:50.040> knew<00:01:50.190> exactly<00:01:50.400> where<00:01:50.909> was<00:01:51.150> getting

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
they knew exactly where was getting

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.170 
they knew exactly where was getting
real-time<00:01:51.840> feedback<00:01:52.440> of<00:01:52.860> my<00:01:53.100> exact<00:01:53.610> position

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:54.180 
real-time feedback of my exact position

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.600 
real-time feedback of my exact position
non-stop<00:01:55.140> until<00:01:55.409> I<00:01:55.560> died<00:01:55.890> and<00:01:56.190> dropped<00:01:56.460> the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:56.610 
non-stop until I died and dropped the

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.539 
non-stop until I died and dropped the
bomb<00:01:56.760> and<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.900> got<00:01:58.110> really<00:01:58.680> really<00:01:59.070> annoying

00:01:59.539 --> 00:01:59.549 
bomb and that got really really annoying

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:01.880 
bomb and that got really really annoying
I<00:02:00.020> think<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.140> there<00:02:01.290> needs<00:02:01.320> to<00:02:01.560> be<00:02:01.619> some

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
I think that there needs to be some

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.340 
I think that there needs to be some
balance<00:02:02.100> with<00:02:02.490> that<00:02:02.670> because<00:02:03.200> showing<00:02:04.200> where

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
balance with that because showing where

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.950 
balance with that because showing where
they<00:02:04.500> are<00:02:04.650> the<00:02:04.979> entire<00:02:05.220> time<00:02:05.460> it<00:02:05.729> just<00:02:05.940> no<00:02:06.869> one

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
they are the entire time it just no one

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.210 
they are the entire time it just no one
could<00:02:07.110> ever<00:02:07.170> do<00:02:07.380> anything<00:02:07.590> I<00:02:07.799> mean<00:02:07.979> even

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:08.220 
could ever do anything I mean even

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:10.759 
could ever do anything I mean even
rounded<00:02:08.670> by<00:02:08.729> teammates<00:02:09.179> is<00:02:09.450> it<00:02:10.349> was<00:02:10.439> kind<00:02:10.709> of

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
rounded by teammates is it was kind of

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:12.530 
rounded by teammates is it was kind of
like<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.220> bunch<00:02:11.430> of<00:02:11.549> dogs<00:02:11.819> in<00:02:12.000> a<00:02:12.060> park<00:02:12.330> and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
like a bunch of dogs in a park and

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.059 
like a bunch of dogs in a park and
they're<00:02:12.989> all<00:02:13.080> like<00:02:13.230> looking<00:02:13.470> for<00:02:13.560> a<00:02:13.620> toy<00:02:13.830> and

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
they're all like looking for a toy and

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:15.350 
they're all like looking for a toy and
it's<00:02:14.250> like<00:02:14.400> one<00:02:14.580> guy<00:02:14.670> staying<00:02:14.939> over<00:02:15.150> there<00:02:15.269> and

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
it's like one guy staying over there and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.699 
it's like one guy staying over there and
he's<00:02:15.480> like<00:02:15.599> squeezing<00:02:16.110> your<00:02:16.200> squeak<00:02:16.409> toy<00:02:16.560> and

00:02:16.699 --> 00:02:16.709 
he's like squeezing your squeak toy and

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:18.559 
he's like squeezing your squeak toy and
ever<00:02:16.830> looks<00:02:17.040> at<00:02:17.189> you<00:02:17.280> like<00:02:17.400> oh<00:02:17.879> he's<00:02:18.420> good

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
ever looks at you like oh he's good

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.120 
ever looks at you like oh he's good
speaker<00:02:18.870> and<00:02:19.020> that<00:02:19.380> that's<00:02:19.620> how<00:02:19.709> I<00:02:19.740> felt<00:02:19.980> every

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:20.130 
speaker and that that's how I felt every

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.290 
speaker and that that's how I felt every
time<00:02:20.250> picked<00:02:20.430> up<00:02:20.520> bomb<00:02:20.700> i<00:02:20.819> get<00:02:20.940> runs<00:02:21.090> like<00:02:21.180> a<00:02:21.209> me

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
time picked up bomb i get runs like a me

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:23.480 
time picked up bomb i get runs like a me
like<00:02:21.450> bump<00:02:21.900> as

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
like bump as

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.130 
like bump as
I<00:02:23.610> don't<00:02:24.270> I<00:02:24.420> don't<00:02:24.450> want<00:02:24.720> this<00:02:24.870> anymore

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
I don't I don't want this anymore

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:26.630 
I don't I don't want this anymore
because<00:02:25.410> I'm<00:02:25.590> gonna<00:02:25.740> die<00:02:25.920> really<00:02:26.160> fast<00:02:26.250> and

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:26.640 
because I'm gonna die really fast and

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.280 
because I'm gonna die really fast and
that's<00:02:26.790> exactly<00:02:26.940> what<00:02:27.270> happened<00:02:27.600> I<00:02:27.720> think<00:02:28.230> a

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
that's exactly what happened I think a

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:30.530 
that's exactly what happened I think a
good<00:02:28.440> balance<00:02:28.830> or<00:02:28.950> good<00:02:29.100> fixing<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.550> make<00:02:30.390> it

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:30.540 
good balance or good fixing that make it

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.900 
good balance or good fixing that make it
a<00:02:30.690> four<00:02:31.020> to<00:02:31.170> five<00:02:31.350> second<00:02:31.770> delay<00:02:31.920> on<00:02:32.340> showing

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
a four to five second delay on showing

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.880 
a four to five second delay on showing
you<00:02:33.150> where<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.540> are<00:02:33.690> on<00:02:33.780> the<00:02:33.810> map<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.350> the

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
you where you are on the map and the

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.290 
you where you are on the map and the
reason<00:02:35.160> why<00:02:35.250> I<00:02:35.280> think<00:02:35.520> that'll<00:02:35.730> work<00:02:35.760> is<00:02:36.060> four

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
reason why I think that'll work is four

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.910 
reason why I think that'll work is four
to<00:02:36.390> five<00:02:36.510> seconds<00:02:36.900> really<00:02:37.110> isn't<00:02:37.440> that<00:02:37.590> long

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
to five seconds really isn't that long

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
to five seconds really isn't that long
in<00:02:38.190> the<00:02:38.700> grand<00:02:38.820> old<00:02:39.090> scheme<00:02:39.360> of<00:02:39.480> things<00:02:39.510> what

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
in the grand old scheme of things what

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.980 
in the grand old scheme of things what
that<00:02:40.650> does<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:41.360> when<00:02:42.360> you're<00:02:42.510> looking<00:02:42.780> at<00:02:42.870> the

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:42.990 
that does is when you're looking at the

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.450 
that does is when you're looking at the
mini-map<00:02:43.380> at<00:02:43.620> the<00:02:43.770> person<00:02:44.010> that's<00:02:44.190> holding

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
mini-map at the person that's holding

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.300 
mini-map at the person that's holding
the<00:02:44.550> bomb<00:02:44.790> as<00:02:45.030> I'm<00:02:46.020> moving<00:02:46.110> along<00:02:46.530> you<00:02:46.950> get<00:02:47.190> an

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:47.310 
the bomb as I'm moving along you get an

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.730 
the bomb as I'm moving along you get an
idea<00:02:47.610> of<00:02:47.670> their<00:02:47.880> direction<00:02:48.240> of<00:02:48.540> exactly<00:02:49.470> where

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:49.740 
idea of their direction of exactly where

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:51.440 
idea of their direction of exactly where
they're<00:02:49.950> heading<00:02:50.280> for<00:02:50.430> 25<00:02:50.970> seconds<00:02:51.390> you

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
they're heading for 25 seconds you

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.300 
they're heading for 25 seconds you
really<00:02:51.630> can't<00:02:51.840> cover<00:02:52.050> that<00:02:52.350> much<00:02:52.620> ground<00:02:53.040> in

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
really can't cover that much ground in

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.300 
really can't cover that much ground in
that<00:02:53.520> gap<00:02:53.820> so<00:02:54.600> what<00:02:55.080> it<00:02:55.200> does<00:02:55.440> is<00:02:55.680> it<00:02:55.710> always

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
that gap so what it does is it always

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.910 
that gap so what it does is it always
gives<00:02:56.940> everyone<00:02:57.480> an<00:02:57.720> idea<00:02:58.050> as<00:02:58.260> to<00:02:58.290> where<00:02:58.770> you

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
gives everyone an idea as to where you

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.130 
gives everyone an idea as to where you
are<00:02:59.160> and<00:02:59.430> where<00:02:59.700> you're<00:02:59.820> heading<00:03:00.210> but<00:03:00.870> it<00:03:00.960> does

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
are and where you're heading but it does

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.200 
are and where you're heading but it does
not<00:03:01.290> give<00:03:01.530> them<00:03:01.710> explicit<00:03:02.610> information<00:03:02.790> as<00:03:03.150> to

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.210 
not give them explicit information as to

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:06.440 
not give them explicit information as to
where<00:03:03.450> you<00:03:03.570> are<00:03:03.810> the<00:03:04.110> entire<00:03:04.710> time<00:03:05.160> so<00:03:05.490> it<00:03:06.060> also

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:06.450 
where you are the entire time so it also

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.150 
where you are the entire time so it also
does<00:03:06.840> is<00:03:06.990> kind<00:03:07.440> of<00:03:07.500> put<00:03:07.590> people<00:03:07.860> in<00:03:08.010> your<00:03:08.100> area

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
does is kind of put people in your area

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.190 
does is kind of put people in your area
so<00:03:08.730> they<00:03:08.850> know<00:03:08.970> kind<00:03:09.270> of<00:03:09.330> where<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.450> be<00:03:09.660> but

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
so they know kind of where to be but

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.110 
so they know kind of where to be but
then<00:03:10.320> that's<00:03:10.440> it<00:03:10.680> after<00:03:10.800> that<00:03:11.280> point<00:03:11.670> it's<00:03:11.940> up

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
then that's it after that point it's up

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.300 
then that's it after that point it's up
to<00:03:12.240> them<00:03:12.420> to<00:03:12.480> find<00:03:12.900> you<00:03:13.080> inside<00:03:13.320> of<00:03:13.650> that<00:03:13.950> area

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
to them to find you inside of that area

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.760 
to them to find you inside of that area
from<00:03:14.760> where<00:03:15.150> they<00:03:15.300> saw<00:03:15.600> you<00:03:15.660> at<00:03:16.140> one<00:03:16.320> point<00:03:16.500> and

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:16.770 
from where they saw you at one point and

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
from where they saw you at one point and
then<00:03:16.890> where<00:03:17.010> they<00:03:17.070> saw<00:03:17.220> you<00:03:17.280> again<00:03:17.430> in<00:03:17.760> the

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:17.790 
then where they saw you again in the

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.700 
then where they saw you again in the
next<00:03:17.910> 45<00:03:18.390> seconds<00:03:19.020> away<00:03:19.140> from<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.440> last

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:19.710 
next 45 seconds away from that last

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.710 
next 45 seconds away from that last
point<00:03:20.070> I<00:03:20.340> really<00:03:20.970> really<00:03:21.180> think<00:03:21.210> it's<00:03:21.510> a<00:03:21.570> good

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
point I really really think it's a good

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:23.810 
point I really really think it's a good
idea<00:03:21.840> who<00:03:22.740> knows<00:03:22.800> if<00:03:23.070> anyone<00:03:23.310> thinks<00:03:23.460> that<00:03:23.580> I'd

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:23.820 
idea who knows if anyone thinks that I'd

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.850 
idea who knows if anyone thinks that I'd
love<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.030> hear<00:03:24.090> your<00:03:24.150> thoughts<00:03:24.470> second<00:03:25.470> make

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:25.860 
love to hear your thoughts second make

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:28.130 
love to hear your thoughts second make

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
the bomb on siege of Shanghai because it

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:33.170 
the bomb on siege of Shanghai because it
had<00:03:31.800> to<00:03:31.920> appear<00:03:32.190> in<00:03:32.340> the<00:03:32.460> middle<00:03:32.730> that<00:03:32.970> way<00:03:33.090> it

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
had to appear in the middle that way it

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.550 
had to appear in the middle that way it
was<00:03:33.270> balanced<00:03:33.660> between<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:34.110> tube<00:03:34.320> team

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
was balanced between the tube team

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.560 
was balanced between the tube team
spawns<00:03:34.920> and<00:03:35.160> that<00:03:35.700> middle<00:03:35.910> part<00:03:36.150> of<00:03:36.270> the<00:03:36.360> map

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:36.570 
spawns and that middle part of the map

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:37.970 
spawns and that middle part of the map
where<00:03:36.750> the<00:03:36.840> skyscraper<00:03:37.350> was<00:03:37.590> then<00:03:37.800> the<00:03:37.860> one

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
where the skyscraper was then the one

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.740 
where the skyscraper was then the one
that<00:03:38.070> always<00:03:38.160> fell<00:03:38.490> was<00:03:39.150> actually<00:03:39.480> like<00:03:39.600> the

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
that always fell was actually like the

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.000 
that always fell was actually like the
skinniest<00:03:40.140> part<00:03:40.320> of<00:03:40.440> the<00:03:40.500> nap<00:03:40.620> even<00:03:40.920> the

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
skinniest part of the nap even the

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:42.830 
skinniest part of the nap even the
skyscraper<00:03:41.520> fell<00:03:41.760> it<00:03:42.000> still<00:03:42.270> was<00:03:42.420> really<00:03:42.810> a

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
skyscraper fell it still was really a

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.650 
skyscraper fell it still was really a
very<00:03:43.500> very<00:03:43.860> small<00:03:44.010> playable<00:03:44.640> area<00:03:44.790> compared

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
very very small playable area compared

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.940 
very very small playable area compared
to<00:03:45.750> what<00:03:45.870> was<00:03:45.990> available<00:03:46.110> on<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.530> other<00:03:46.650> sides

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:46.950 
to what was available on the other sides

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.250 
to what was available on the other sides
I<00:03:47.190> don't<00:03:47.820> know<00:03:48.120> if<00:03:48.300> that's<00:03:48.480> going<00:03:48.630> to<00:03:48.690> be<00:03:48.810> the

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
I don't know if that's going to be the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.770 
I don't know if that's going to be the
same<00:03:49.560> for<00:03:50.130> how<00:03:50.700> the<00:03:50.760> other<00:03:51.060> maps<00:03:51.330> are<00:03:51.480> designed

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:51.780 
same for how the other maps are designed

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:54.350 
same for how the other maps are designed
but<00:03:52.500> I<00:03:52.680> really<00:03:53.040> do<00:03:53.160> think<00:03:53.460> that<00:03:53.580> it<00:03:53.880> needs<00:03:54.120> to

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
but I really do think that it needs to

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.840 
but I really do think that it needs to
be<00:03:54.860> spread<00:03:55.860> out<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:56.040> lot<00:03:56.280> more<00:03:56.460> there's<00:03:56.700> one

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
be spread out a lot more there's one

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:57.890 
be spread out a lot more there's one
thing<00:03:56.970> every<00:03:57.300> they<00:03:57.390> didn't<00:03:57.540> like<00:03:57.660> about<00:03:57.780> it

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:57.900 
thing every they didn't like about it

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.840 
thing every they didn't like about it
was<00:03:57.990> you<00:03:58.680> know<00:03:58.740> what<00:03:58.920> the<00:03:59.130> bomb<00:03:59.310> keeps<00:03:59.610> showing

00:03:59.840 --> 00:03:59.850 
was you know what the bomb keeps showing

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.090 
was you know what the bomb keeps showing
up<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.150> basically<00:04:01.140> the<00:04:01.290> same<00:04:01.470> three<00:04:01.800> spots

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:02.100 
up and basically the same three spots

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.950 
up and basically the same three spots
every<00:04:02.430> time<00:04:02.610> and<00:04:02.910> I<00:04:03.240> just<00:04:03.390> got<00:04:03.540> old<00:04:03.690> because

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:03.960 
every time and I just got old because

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.360 
every time and I just got old because
what<00:04:04.110> happened<00:04:04.440> was<00:04:04.470> after<00:04:04.830> you<00:04:05.070> plant<00:04:05.220> the

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
what happened was after you plant the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.740 
what happened was after you plant the
bomb<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:05.730> had<00:04:05.850> about<00:04:05.940> a<00:04:06.090> minute<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.480> kill

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
bomb you had about a minute to kill

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.380 
bomb you had about a minute to kill
before<00:04:07.320> the<00:04:07.560> next<00:04:07.710> one<00:04:07.920> shown<00:04:08.130> up<00:04:08.310> and<00:04:09.180> by<00:04:09.330> the

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:09.390 
before the next one shown up and by the

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:11.240 
before the next one shown up and by the
time<00:04:09.480> I<00:04:09.600> showed<00:04:09.780> up<00:04:09.930> but<00:04:10.050> you<00:04:10.170> would<00:04:10.290> say<00:04:10.440> bomb

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250 
time I showed up but you would say bomb

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.220 
time I showed up but you would say bomb
is<00:04:11.430> spotted<00:04:11.850> bob<00:04:12.090> has<00:04:12.240> been<00:04:12.390> picked<00:04:12.570> up<00:04:12.690> it's

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:13.230 
is spotted bob has been picked up it's

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.290 
is spotted bob has been picked up it's
like<00:04:13.410> instantly<00:04:14.070> because<00:04:14.340> every<00:04:14.880> new<00:04:15.180> is

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:15.300 
like instantly because every new is

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:16.490 
like instantly because every new is
gonna<00:04:15.450> be<00:04:15.570> so<00:04:15.750> they<00:04:15.840> just<00:04:15.870> SAT<00:04:16.170> there<00:04:16.200> waiting

00:04:16.490 --> 00:04:16.500 
gonna be so they just SAT there waiting

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.460 
gonna be so they just SAT there waiting
you<00:04:16.770> know<00:04:16.799> you<00:04:16.950> had<00:04:17.070> like<00:04:17.280> a<00:04:17.460> squad<00:04:18.290> 25<00:04:19.290> man

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
you know you had like a squad 25 man

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:20.870 
you know you had like a squad 25 man
squad<00:04:19.500> just<00:04:20.070> sitting<00:04:20.370> there<00:04:20.400> waiting<00:04:20.520> for<00:04:20.820> the

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:20.880 
squad just sitting there waiting for the

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.220 
squad just sitting there waiting for the
damn<00:04:21.030> thing<00:04:21.270> they're<00:04:21.390> staying<00:04:21.630> around<00:04:21.750> top<00:04:22.080> of

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
damn thing they're staying around top of

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:25.090 
damn thing they're staying around top of
it<00:04:22.350> so<00:04:22.920> I'd<00:04:23.190> like<00:04:23.370> to<00:04:23.460> see<00:04:23.610> more<00:04:24.300> randomized

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:25.100 
it so I'd like to see more randomized

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:27.530 
it so I'd like to see more randomized
spawn<00:04:26.100> locations<00:04:26.640> from<00:04:26.760> the<00:04:26.820> bombs<00:04:27.030> as<00:04:27.270> they

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
spawn locations from the bombs as they

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.590 
spawn locations from the bombs as they
reappear<00:04:28.160> third<00:04:29.160> and<00:04:29.310> final<00:04:29.580> one<00:04:29.700> get<00:04:30.360> rid<00:04:30.570> of

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:30.600 
reappear third and final one get rid of

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.630 
reappear third and final one get rid of
the<00:04:30.750> parachute<00:04:31.170> deploy<00:04:31.440> the<00:04:32.130> problem<00:04:32.460> that<00:04:32.580> I

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:32.640 
the parachute deploy the problem that I

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.400 
the parachute deploy the problem that I
saw<00:04:32.850> it<00:04:32.970> that<00:04:33.150> was<00:04:33.330> it<00:04:33.540> allows<00:04:33.780> people<00:04:33.960> to<00:04:34.140> jump

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:34.410 
saw it that was it allows people to jump

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:35.930 
saw it that was it allows people to jump
right<00:04:34.620> down<00:04:34.860> on<00:04:35.070> the<00:04:35.100> bomb<00:04:35.400> which<00:04:35.580> kind<00:04:35.850> of

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
right down on the bomb which kind of

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.279 
right down on the bomb which kind of
takes<00:04:36.090> away<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.450> excitement<00:04:36.720> of<00:04:36.990> seeing

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
takes away the excitement of seeing

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.379 
takes away the excitement of seeing
appear<00:04:37.649> and<00:04:37.860> making<00:04:38.069> a<00:04:38.129> dash<00:04:38.369> for<00:04:38.399> it<00:04:38.699> and<00:04:38.879> I

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
appear and making a dash for it and I

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.299 
appear and making a dash for it and I
did<00:04:39.599> that<00:04:39.779> I<00:04:39.990> did<00:04:40.020> that<00:04:40.349> why<00:04:40.649> I<00:04:40.680> did<00:04:40.889> that<00:04:40.919> every

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:41.309 
did that I did that why I did that every

00:04:41.309 --> 00:04:42.769 
did that I did that why I did that every
single<00:04:41.610> time<00:04:41.789> after<00:04:42.300> we<00:04:42.360> armed<00:04:42.569> a<00:04:42.629> bomb

00:04:42.769 --> 00:04:42.779 
single time after we armed a bomb

00:04:42.779 --> 00:04:44.389 
single time after we armed a bomb
because<00:04:43.199> I<00:04:43.259> knew<00:04:43.680> that<00:04:43.919> that<00:04:44.099> was<00:04:44.249> the

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:44.399 
because I knew that that was the

00:04:44.399 --> 00:04:46.070 
because I knew that that was the
quickest<00:04:44.639> way<00:04:44.759> to<00:04:44.819> get<00:04:44.969> to<00:04:45.180> it<00:04:45.210> I<00:04:45.449> knew<00:04:45.899> it<00:04:45.960> was

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
quickest way to get to it I knew it was

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.570 
quickest way to get to it I knew it was
going<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.259> show<00:04:46.469> up<00:04:46.680> somewhere<00:04:47.069> in<00:04:47.309> the<00:04:47.369> middle

00:04:47.570 --> 00:04:47.580 
going to show up somewhere in the middle

00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:49.249 
going to show up somewhere in the middle
of<00:04:47.610> the<00:04:47.669> map<00:04:47.849> but<00:04:48.509> didn't<00:04:48.689> want<00:04:48.809> to<00:04:48.899> be<00:04:48.990> on<00:04:49.139> the

00:04:49.249 --> 00:04:49.259 
of the map but didn't want to be on the

00:04:49.259 --> 00:04:51.019 
of the map but didn't want to be on the
ground<00:04:49.379> trying<00:04:50.009> to<00:04:50.159> fight<00:04:50.399> before<00:04:50.639> the<00:04:50.849> thing

00:04:51.019 --> 00:04:51.029 
ground trying to fight before the thing

00:04:51.029 --> 00:04:53.089 
ground trying to fight before the thing
even<00:04:51.210> got<00:04:51.360> there<00:04:51.569> so<00:04:52.229> after<00:04:52.499> the<00:04:52.589> bomb<00:04:52.770> went<00:04:52.800> up

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
even got there so after the bomb went up

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.249 
even got there so after the bomb went up
I<00:04:53.279> would<00:04:53.639> either<00:04:54.180> go<00:04:54.509> and<00:04:54.539> fight<00:04:54.899> and<00:04:55.139> get

00:04:55.249 --> 00:04:55.259 
I would either go and fight and get

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:56.989 
I would either go and fight and get
killed<00:04:55.529> or<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.830> would<00:04:56.189> just<00:04:56.399> allow<00:04:56.550> myself<00:04:56.759> to

00:04:56.989 --> 00:04:56.999 
killed or I would just allow myself to

00:04:56.999 --> 00:04:58.279 
killed or I would just allow myself to
be<00:04:57.119> killed<00:04:57.330> by<00:04:57.449> the<00:04:57.509> bomb<00:04:57.689> and<00:04:57.930> I'd<00:04:58.050> sit<00:04:58.229> there

00:04:58.279 --> 00:04:58.289 
be killed by the bomb and I'd sit there

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:00.589 
be killed by the bomb and I'd sit there
in<00:04:58.619> the<00:04:58.740> spawn<00:04:58.979> menu<00:04:59.339> and<00:04:59.520> just<00:04:59.999> wait<00:05:00.149> and<00:05:00.389> buy

00:05:11.149 --> 00:05:11.159 
on to where the bomb was and it took a

00:05:11.159 --> 00:05:12.290 
on to where the bomb was and it took a
lot<00:05:11.249> of<00:05:11.309> travel<00:05:11.669> up<00:05:11.759> but<00:05:11.939> you<00:05:12.089> know<00:05:12.149> like<00:05:12.240> I
