00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:37.510
 collectors 

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:41.130
 there were four guys in their 20s who 

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.130
 when four the doctor does 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:49.320

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:53.190
 for my follower where it's hectic 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.170
 the doctor who represents me the one 

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.050
 the doctor gave me that he felt 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:00.690
 neighborhoods and the girl boot the group to 

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:03.750
 Marina de Córdoba 9th and the girl from 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:08.100
 sea group in which they sing cumbia no 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.610
 knows what it sings so well we have it 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.950
 what Brig 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:14.100
 and I want to comment I want to comment 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:17.640
 to the public 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.130
 that I am very cultured that when we know 

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:25.460
 Anaya already said if I read all day 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:29.110
 even when handling light 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.110
 and it is difficult 

00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:40.060
 I read the legends that the 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:43.480
 truck drivers on the bumpers and I'm going 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:47.120
 driving only the boring fart in the 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:52.540
 radio gives me to fuck in the laws 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:56.269
 I have retained several makes a partner 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.849
 economic a phrase that he said was a country 

00:02:56.269 --> 00:03:01.360
 so poor that the national bird was the 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:01.360
 fly 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:08.099
 another one that I read in an atmospheric truck 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:10.819
 that said here we take the effort of 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:10.819
 all the people 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.920
 another more philosophical 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:24.120
 of a Greek philosopher who greek 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:28.770
 Cordovan that is a cliché that says 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.740
 the early bird finds everything closed 

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:37.730
 another more dramatic phrase that says dad 

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:37.730
 dad do not run mom the same thing happens to you 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:45.300
 another one that said if you see that this 

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:48.620
 letter is enlarged to make it shit 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:48.620
 I'm doing reverse 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:59.870
 but the one I liked the most 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:04:02.830
 what poetic and that phrase of change says 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:07.860
 I get excited 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:10.770
 an emotional moment that cultural music 

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:14.790
 yesterday I passed by your house 

00:04:10.770 --> 00:04:18.269
 you threw me with a pearl 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:21.199
 tomorrow throw me the height that I do not have 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.199
 where to get 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:29.580
 i live 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.600
 but less strong not with the pearl where 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:34.080
 the pearl goes 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:40.530
 to the shell 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.530
 and put them and if the mass thinks badly 

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:51.209
