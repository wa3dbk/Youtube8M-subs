00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:27.630 
you that diffuses the bomb you can't

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:29.660 
you that diffuses the bomb you can't
play<00:00:27.810> with<00:00:27.840> four<00:00:28.199> players<00:00:28.470> to<00:00:29.130> fuse<00:00:29.400> five

bombs<00:00:29.939> amongst<00:00:30.570> the<00:00:30.660> four<00:00:30.840> of<00:00:30.900> you<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.380> then

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:31.529 
bombs amongst the four of you and then

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.010 
bombs amongst the four of you and then
everybody<00:00:32.070> expect<00:00:32.640> to<00:00:32.820> get<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.690> achievement

everybody expect to get the achievement
ok<00:00:34.710> it's<00:00:35.399> not<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> way<00:00:35.850> it<00:00:35.969> works<00:00:36.000> so<00:00:36.660> when

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
ok it's not the way it works so when

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.709 
ok it's not the way it works so when
you're<00:00:36.989> running<00:00:37.200> in<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.800> single<00:00:38.190> player<00:00:38.430> um<00:00:38.730> for

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
you're running in a single player um for

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:42.290 
you're running in a single player um for
I<00:00:39.750> think<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.500> until<00:00:40.620> approximately<00:00:41.610> round<00:00:41.850> 20

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
I think up until approximately round 20

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.060 
I think up until approximately round 20
you're<00:00:42.719> only<00:00:42.840> going<00:00:43.079> to<00:00:43.200> get<00:00:43.320> two<00:00:43.680> of<00:00:43.950> the

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
you're only going to get two of the

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.130 
you're only going to get two of the
Atlas<00:00:44.370> guys<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:45.030> actually<00:00:45.210> are<00:00:45.420> defending

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
Atlas guys that actually are defending

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.770 
Atlas guys that actually are defending
the<00:00:46.260> bomb<00:00:46.440> ok<00:00:47.219> and<00:00:47.460> I<00:00:48.120> think<00:00:48.180> once<00:00:48.539> you<00:00:48.629> get

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
the bomb ok and I think once you get

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.630 
the bomb ok and I think once you get
past<00:00:48.809> around<00:00:49.289> 20<00:00:49.710> that's<00:00:49.950> when<00:00:50.250> you<00:00:50.370> get<00:00:50.550> the

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
past around 20 that's when you get the

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.250 
past around 20 that's when you get the
mech<00:00:50.850> there's<00:00:51.120> a<00:00:51.180> mech<00:00:51.420> that<00:00:51.600> actually<00:00:51.960> joins

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
mech there's a mech that actually joins

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.319 
mech there's a mech that actually joins
in<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.620> think<00:00:52.829> its<00:00:52.980> ends<00:00:53.309> up<00:00:53.399> being<00:00:53.579> like<00:00:53.789> one

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
in I think its ends up being like one

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.000 
in I think its ends up being like one
mech<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:54.629> one<00:00:55.079> atlas<00:00:55.440> guys<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:55.829> we're<00:00:55.980> just

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
mech and one atlas guys so we're just

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.240 
mech and one atlas guys so we're just
going<00:00:56.309> through<00:00:56.670> the<00:00:56.879> times<00:00:57.780> that<00:00:57.989> I<00:00:58.170> got<00:00:58.590> the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
going through the times that I got the

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.819 
going through the times that I got the
bomb<00:00:59.489> defused<00:00:59.930> when<00:01:00.930> I<00:01:00.960> was<00:01:01.109> running<00:01:01.230> solo<00:01:01.620> the

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
the contact grenades work awesome on the

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.120 
the contact grenades work awesome on the
Atlas<00:01:16.830> guys<00:01:17.040> and<00:01:17.970> when<00:01:18.119> you<00:01:18.180> run<00:01:18.360> solo<00:01:19.130> you

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
Atlas guys and when you run solo you

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.700 
Atlas guys and when you run solo you
know<00:01:20.280> your<00:01:20.610> camouflage<00:01:20.970> lasts<00:01:21.750> I<00:01:22.020> don't<00:01:22.680> think

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
know your camouflage lasts I don't think

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:24.649 
know your camouflage lasts I don't think
it<00:01:22.890> last<00:01:23.070> longer<00:01:23.400> but<00:01:23.610> the<00:01:23.729> bomb<00:01:23.909> defuse<00:01:24.390> is

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:24.659 
it last longer but the bomb defuse is

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:27.980 
it last longer but the bomb defuse is
very<00:01:25.110> very<00:01:25.350> short<00:01:25.710> ok<00:01:26.430> so<00:01:26.909> you're<00:01:27.630> gonna<00:01:27.750> have

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
very very short ok so you're gonna have

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.080 
very very short ok so you're gonna have
no<00:01:28.200> problem<00:01:28.229> getting<00:01:28.829> this<00:01:29.100> especially<00:01:29.939> when

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
no problem getting this especially when

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.370 
no problem getting this especially when
running<00:01:30.299> so<00:01:30.540> a<00:01:30.570> little<00:01:30.930> bit<00:01:31.049> more<00:01:31.229> difficult

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
running so a little bit more difficult

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:32.600

running<00:02:36.760> in<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> kit<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.450> cargo<00:02:38.080> area

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
running in the kit in the cargo area

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.640 
running in the kit in the cargo area
probably<00:02:40.090> one<00:02:40.330> of<00:02:40.360> the<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.870> better<00:02:41.080> spots<00:02:41.290> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
probably one of the the better spots to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.350 
probably one of the the better spots to
run<00:02:41.830> when<00:02:42.100> you're<00:02:42.250> running<00:02:42.430> solo<00:02:42.790> even<00:02:43.210> when

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
run when you're running solo even when

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:45.240 
run when you're running solo even when
you're<00:02:43.540> running<00:02:43.720> multiplayer<00:02:44.260> hyper<00:02:45.040> and<00:02:45.190> I

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
you're running multiplayer hyper and I

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.520 
you're running multiplayer hyper and I
one<00:02:45.610> was<00:02:45.820> running<00:02:46.150> in<00:02:46.240> cargo<00:02:46.720> I<00:02:46.990> think<00:02:47.350> that

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530 
one was running in cargo I think that

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:50.010 
one was running in cargo I think that
was<00:02:47.830> mostly<00:02:48.370> me<00:02:48.670> hyper<00:02:49.210> was<00:02:49.480> running<00:02:49.750> in<00:02:49.840> moon

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:50.020 
was mostly me hyper was running in moon

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:52.650 
was mostly me hyper was running in moon
pool<00:02:50.290> you<00:02:51.010> can<00:02:51.160> even<00:02:51.280> run<00:02:51.550> in<00:02:51.760> in<00:02:52.000> hangar<00:02:52.540> and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:52.660 
pool you can even run in in hangar and

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:54.750 
pool you can even run in in hangar and
armory<00:02:53.080> I<00:02:53.530> think<00:02:54.190> we've<00:02:54.340> done<00:02:54.580> a<00:02:54.640> couple

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:54.760 
armory I think we've done a couple

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.420 
armory I think we've done a couple
rounds<00:02:55.120> in<00:02:55.450> there<00:02:55.690> especially<00:02:56.380> when<00:02:56.530> in<00:02:57.040> later

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:57.430 
rounds in there especially when in later

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:58.980 
rounds in there especially when in later
on<00:02:57.640> when<00:02:57.850> the<00:02:57.910> bombs<00:02:58.090> started<00:02:58.450> going<00:02:58.660> off<00:02:58.810> and

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
on when the bombs started going off and

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:00.150 
on when the bombs started going off and
we<00:02:59.080> couldn't<00:02:59.260> go<00:02:59.410> in<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.650> areas<00:02:59.950> that<00:02:59.980> we

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:00.160 
we couldn't go in the areas that we

00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:02.100 
we couldn't go in the areas that we
wanted<00:03:00.400> to<00:03:00.460> go<00:03:00.610> in<00:03:00.760> okay<00:03:01.390> so<00:03:01.450> here<00:03:01.870> we<00:03:01.960> are<00:03:02.080> in
