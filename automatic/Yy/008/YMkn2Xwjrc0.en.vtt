00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.490
 hello good friends 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.919
 Today we are going to show you how to cut a 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.019
 long or extra long hair cutting alone 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.790
 a little bit at a time, it will be because 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:13.590
 I meet many people with very 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.480
 long here a lot to trim anything up 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.160
 of cloves we will do a treatment of 

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:19.560
 infrared and infrared stem cells 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.150
 so that well to seal the 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.779
 tips and that is well silky and 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.930
 sparkly 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.580
 Then let's do this we bernard I 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.429
 chosen to sheila because she has a mane 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.320
 long and as it is a model can not be cut 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.540
 hair for work reasons without 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.640
 However I'm going to show you how 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.590
 cut it and leave it shiny and silky 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.000
 to 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.550
 what we are going to do is make the 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.860
 Stem cell treatment works for 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.989
 reconstruct hair in depth or 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.550
 if it's only super effective but we have 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.010
 a tool that we can use that 

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.260
 is the infrared machine so that 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.960
 penetrate well and seal the ends 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:58.430
 come back in a little bit please we have 

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.930
 washing with the shampoo of the cells 

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:01.879
 mother we have conditioned it with the 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:03.770
 mask of the stem cells and now 

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:06.400
 let's proceed to be the three 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.400
 pulsations 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.150
 bombay 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.280
 but if I pass it through my hair, I 'll catch 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.280
 temperatures 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.050
 let's tell the tips a little 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:30.970
 then nothing to repair a bit the 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:35.250
 mane give a little layer to the part 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.250
 superior paraded a little step 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:52.580
 we are going to give layers I will not cut you 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:56.800
 a finger I cut it and we are going to dispute him 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.800
 Gently all the perimeter of the face 

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:01.220
 I will lightly help the layers of the 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:03.590
 part of the front I'm not going to 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.960
 to break off , I can not break them 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.420
 cut long 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.349
 just repair 

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.349
 a little bit 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:17.090
 how can we know that the cut is known 

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:19.480
 well effected with softness diego 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.480
 check 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.580
 and I let it fall very soft 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.000
 the truth is that I loved doing it here 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.930
 it's easy man here everything is easy 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.930
 being the champion of europe 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.210
 then it came out
