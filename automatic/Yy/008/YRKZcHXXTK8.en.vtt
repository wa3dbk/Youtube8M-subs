 Olfa Marianas Street and I am Alejandra 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:12.830
 quesada fashion designer for new 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:14.120
 I think he basically does it collect it 

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.099
 in advertising and converts it into 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.100
 products of daily use for 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.910
 form them in bags or backpacks 

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.740
 generally what manuel vÃ¡zquez does 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:23.750
 we use stamping the post as 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.000
 achieve an advertising agency or the 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.440
 brand but in this case we decided to give the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.869
 back with a rural collaboration 

00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.599
 crusade that did not stamped your believable and 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.280
 decided to use the white part and give it 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.929
 to know a blank canvas and 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.899
 he developed interesting concepts like 

00:00:35.929 --> 00:00:40.760
 the birds and the plot of the 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:45.100
 removal of social tourism plans 

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.100
 this collaboration through 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:54.190
 and good we decided to join forces designs 

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:56.530
 creativity to make a product of 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.440
 sustainable design a design is 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.839
 totally in charge of remote but the 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:04.479
 products that we use to make the 

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:07.110
 bags are all organic we have the 

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:09.970
 canvas that comes from an advertising canvas 

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.189
 we have the denim that comes from the group 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.039
 kaltex that is made from pet 

00:01:12.189 --> 00:01:17.310
 recycled the print for the bag me 

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.270
 I inspired in my collection of 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.420
 autumn / winter how to present in fashion 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.049
 week 'we are birds hugging birds 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:27.490
 humans and because we wanted to how 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:30.310
 transmit this movement this 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.110
 evolution this freedom is flying this 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:35.229
 dreaming a pattern is a pattern 

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:37.360
 geometric is just a bit of the plot 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.510
 that comes behind the ball has recycled 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:42.640
 this combination between plastic and a 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:46.090
 plot that explains that it is a reticle 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:49.150
 then he alleges work is his own 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:51.460
 lines make up the canvas and that was done 

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.960
 pattern with true colors 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.610

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:02.350
