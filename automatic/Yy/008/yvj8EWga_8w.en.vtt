00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.369
 in playstation 4 and one so far 

00:00:30.839 --> 00:00:34.290
 in playstation 3 you already know that you can 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.360
 do going to the strip club 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.130

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:41.670
 inside the strip club and when leaving 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.170
 will put the helmet on top of the 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.020
 mask for which you will already have the 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.910
 glitch is worth but in xbox wii playstation 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.010
 4 we have to do it with the method that 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.830
 before it worked in the old generation 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:56.550

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.770
 clothing store by the door we leave there 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.330

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.850
 catch without any problem and come to us 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.259
 a clothing store to do the trick as 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.450
 The only thing you have to do is open the 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:13.450
 select menu or go to accessories worth 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.759
 Inventory 

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.259
 and you choose the helmet you want 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:18.759
 use once 

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.159
 have the helmet you want to use 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.200
 to fight with your mask you give 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:25.240
 to the square that you see that puts the option 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.250
 to fix like that whenever you ride 

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.350
 a motorcycle or that helmet that 

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.039
 you have chosen then you take it away from 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.710
 helmet you keep the menu open 

00:01:32.039 --> 00:01:36.670
 interactions in this inventory is worth and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.350
 the only thing you have to do is 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.000
 next here as you see we have 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.439
 mounted the motorcycle to check that 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.420
 really put on the helmet that we have 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.100
 chosen we hope you have it the soil 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.810
 and what we have to put on is about 

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:47.740
 the mask menu we ride on the 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.539
 motorcycle 

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:50.799
 we hope that the motorcycle starts and when 

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:53.020
 You see that he is making the gesture of 

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.700
 put on the helmet change to the mask 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.920
 you want and as you can see it has already been 

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.539
 the mask with the helmet you have to 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.310
 do it right at the moment when you 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:02.079
 is putting the helmet on and now what 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.939
 you have to do is the following you can 

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.039
 close the east accessories menu and 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.780
 others and you have to be pretty fast 

00:02:06.039 --> 00:02:10.479
 that's why what I told you to leave the 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.950
 motorcycle very very close to the door and 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.180
 again I repeat that it only works 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.190
 with the quads with the bikes of two 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.110
 wheels does not work then what 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.290
 you have to do is the following you have 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.569
 that motorbike birds very very 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.519
 and get into the store and change a 

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:25.349
 garment that is the same as 

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.750
 be the shoes a trousers whatever 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:29.340
 ok and in this way we will avoid that 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.170
 remove the helmet how are you going to see now 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.569

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.549

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.319

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:41.189
 bottom part and I put on a pair of pants 

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:42.810

00:02:41.189 --> 00:02:44.939

00:02:44.939 --> 00:02:48.689
