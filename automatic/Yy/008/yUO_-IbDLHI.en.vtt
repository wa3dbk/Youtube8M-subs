 new technique sloth video 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.560
 i have just got a package from rajko 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.960
 get or in there is a 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.730
 bluetooth speaker and at this 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.679
 thank you all 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.969
 by watching my videos 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.130
 become the manufacturer on me 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.779
 attentively and then go and say 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:21.869
 Technology tested please 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.269
 our product makes videos about it and 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.550
 the whole program at this point 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.119
 not only thanks to three ko for sending 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:32.460
 but also to you that you are 

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.610
 such videos of me ever looked at 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.520
 so we'll see something in it, I know 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:41.850
 that it is a bluetooth speaker 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.969
 I do not know which model there 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:48.059
 I'm very excited now and we 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.489
 otherwise there is nothing in the packaging 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:53.059
 just wrapped up nicely in music or here 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:59.520
 but there are small air bubbles 

00:00:53.059 --> 00:01:02.489
 we have the evolution bluetooth vacuum 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:05.760
 speaker na that's my name 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:08.520
 including usb battery pack this is one 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.619
 from the speakers about the one then 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.780
 also his smartphone directly with 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.060
 can recharge if you then the cable 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:19.259
 has and what we still find out 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:23.070
 bluetooth show battery pack 2 wiegel 

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:25.140
 speaker and otherwise there is also 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.759
 in different colors black red white 

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:30.090
 here is the tick I have the 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:33.869
 black very nice in german sound 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:36.390
 energy 2 2 1 1 the speaker and usb 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.000
 charger 2 x 3 watt five 1000 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.159
 milliampere battery-powered by bluetooth 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.930
 or line-in battery runtime maximum 24 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.450
 hours of integrated lithium polymer battery 

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:47.790
 Handsfree setup so there should 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.250
 then everything in it should be what you get from it 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.950
 we expect a loudspeaker 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.770
 the thing also on super where have 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.360
 I threw the deep snow 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:00.979
 Nobody should tell me that would not be 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.979
 everything live and uncut and 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:16.350
 so optically alone now from the 

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.090
 packaging gives bonus points 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:20.030
 So that's not all right now 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:21.690
 simple but there is one 

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:23.850
 Packaging designer or designer 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.620
 really hard given at this point 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.200
 that also gives praise if that 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:31.140
 Unpack so much fun making so 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.580
 and we have the next box in one 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.580
 box to get just so to do then 

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.110
 Let's do it that way 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.850
 handbook that I do not think so 

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.110
 bad and, above all, there is 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.490
 Again, the bonus point is so small 

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:46.350
 things that is not so 

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.930
 cheap paper vehicle but here 

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:50.970
 nice a little handbook what really 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.950
 make mood now there is again 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.300
 really bonuspunkte who knows me the 

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:56.760
 I know I'm looking for everyone 

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:59.370
 unboxing after sticker and what have 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.070
 Here we finally get a sticker 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:04.320
 very, very nice so that makes me happy 

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:07.520
 just that is my unboxing what the 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:10.590
 personally just a lot of fun 

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:13.170
 so so manual in different 

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:16.020
 Speech speaker is nicely explained 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.430
 Well, there I am, but we are happy 

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.560
 now want to see what else is 

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:22.350
 still in the process 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:24.180
 we get an adapter set for the 

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:26.489
 I fold all the time if I only as 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:28.140
 charger wants to use iphone but 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:31.830
 then probably only 30 am not 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:34.620
 lightning samsung mini usb micro usb 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:36.270
 Nokia plug and again extra samsung 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.950
 So everything you plug in what you do 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.900
 wishes and then not loose in 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:44.010
 the box in it but nice again 

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:46.050
 Packed class then once again 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.940
 good of these velvety carrying bags 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:53.670
 that are probably getting used to it then there is that 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:55.320
 even a small cable in the flat 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.900
 Cable design in red recalls 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:02.310
 a bit of beats but very nice that 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:04.950
 we got something like that directly with us 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:09.440
 once again advertising for other small ones 

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:09.440
 micron speakers for all 

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:18.919
 and there is also the evolution with it 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:27.650
 with the built-in battery pack and what 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:30.680
 we still offer a usb on micro usb 

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:32.900
 cable probably to load and we 

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.500
 even have a charger fits 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.990
 fits even with interchangeable ones 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:41.270
 plug for the trip very nice 

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.509
 the whole thing is very reminiscent of the ipad 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:46.190
 charger design the micro came usb cable 

00:04:44.509 --> 00:04:49.340
 is a bit short if I am 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:51.530
 that's how it looks like this 

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.180
 a bluetooth speaker with built-in 

00:04:51.530 --> 00:04:54.650
 Battery is of course for the mobile 

00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:56.599
 intended use but there are certainly 

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.490
 enough that the thing sometimes somewhere 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.979
 want to use stationary for longer 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.020
 time and there we have a longer micro 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:05.199
 usb cable to load naturally better 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.710
 the device is permanently supplied with electricity 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:14.419
 that was it remains only our micro 

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:16.070
 evolution speaker jobs empty and the 

00:05:14.419 --> 00:05:17.479
 Hammer that part I would have now 

00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:21.560
 a thicker bigger or expected 

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:23.150
 presented but size is no matter we 

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:26.000
 know this is a little joke speaker 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:29.139
 the question is how good does the part sound? 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.500
 then later on the design i have to say 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:35.210
 nice that's what I like here in front 

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.159
 then that flat roofs you can do it that way 

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.520
 see those are so small mini dare or 

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:42.949
 point opening very nice from above too 

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:44.990
 marked black that's what something again 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.240
 I do not like shiny ones 

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:48.949
 high gloss so piano finish where you 

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.770
 then see the fingerprints and everything 

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:54.110
 but quite properly frosted in 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.360
 ride so visually tells me the thing 

00:05:54.110 --> 00:06:01.430
 to see why we do that 

00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:03.409
 shape then fits our usb car manufacturer what 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:06.530
 i know how to load smartphone or tablet 

00:06:03.409 --> 00:06:08.719
 then the micro usb to charge and the 

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.880
 leyen in for the direct operation so 

00:06:08.719 --> 00:06:13.810
 not via bluetooth on and off switch 

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:13.810
 you can press 

00:06:14.349 --> 00:06:19.449
 there seems to be a noise 

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:21.040
 but I do not see anything on the led 

00:06:19.449 --> 00:06:22.510
 light strip 

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.120
 he'll do it, I think that's there for 

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:27.070
 to show us how much battery charge there 

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:29.290
 Yoghurt is still charging in there 

00:06:27.070 --> 00:06:31.870
 and then we still have the keys above 

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:33.400
 microphone opening I say louder 

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:35.530
 quietly maybe you can do it too 

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:38.020
 the next tracks tipped 

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:39.940
 Bluetooth connection button and was watching 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:41.370
 the only thing you have that for now 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.910
 I also do not on the packaging 

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:47.230
 read which we have apparently nfc 

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:49.900
 that means your android devices that 

00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:51.940
 have and support direct parent 

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.740
 is pairing seems to be possible 

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:55.720
 Of course that's what I had with me 

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:56.590
 none in a mobile small 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.970
 bluetooth speaker 

00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:00.970
 Of course, I'm looking forward to it now 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:03.340
 especially on it first impression of 

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:05.560
 the packaging of the accessories of design 

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:08.370
 really positive about this reiko 

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.810
 evolution bluetooth stereo speakers 

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.730
 which has the thing on it like the whole 

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:15.430
 Of course there is then in 

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:17.040
 some days maybe a two 

00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.690
 weeks only when I get that thing 

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:21.820
 Thank you very much 

00:07:19.690 --> 00:07:25.050
 It looks good and to see 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:25.050
 next video bye
