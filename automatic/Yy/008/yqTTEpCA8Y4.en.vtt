hopefully give you a bit of a helping
hand<00:00:32.550> in<00:00:32.820> if<00:00:32.970> you<00:00:33.090> do<00:00:33.300> hook<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.660> golf<00:00:33.870> ball

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:34.080 
hand in if you do hook the golf ball

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.930 
hand in if you do hook the golf ball
then<00:00:34.260> you<00:00:34.710> can<00:00:34.890> sort<00:00:35.070> of<00:00:35.129> go<00:00:35.309> away<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.700> check

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
then you can sort of go away and check

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.939 
then you can sort of go away and check
this<00:00:36.120> and<00:00:36.360> see<00:00:36.540> if<00:00:36.870> this<00:00:37.320> is<00:00:37.350> the<00:00:37.470> reason<00:00:37.710> why

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:37.949 
this and see if this is the reason why

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.130 
this and see if this is the reason why
you<00:00:38.010> hook<00:00:38.250> it<00:00:38.400> so<00:00:38.670> hook<00:00:39.330> shot<00:00:39.600> for<00:00:40.110> a

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
you hook it so hook shot for a

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.200 
you hook it so hook shot for a
right-handed<00:00:40.590> golfer<00:00:40.670> always<00:00:41.670> finishes<00:00:42.030> left

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
right-handed golfer always finishes left

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.460 
right-handed golfer always finishes left
a<00:00:42.300> target<00:00:42.660> a<00:00:42.690> lot<00:00:42.840> of<00:00:42.960> spin<00:00:43.170> quite<00:00:43.410> a

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:43.470 
a target a lot of spin quite a

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:46.160 
a target a lot of spin quite a
destructive<00:00:44.040> shot<00:00:44.280> as<00:00:44.400> well<00:00:44.580> now<00:00:45.239> first<00:00:46.050> of

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
destructive shot as well now first of

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.140 
destructive shot as well now first of
all<00:00:46.230> it<00:00:46.470> could<00:00:46.800> come<00:00:47.070> from<00:00:47.100> the<00:00:47.400> set<00:00:47.580> up<00:00:47.760> so<00:00:47.970> we

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:48.150 
all it could come from the set up so we

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.670 
all it could come from the set up so we
need<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.480> make<00:00:48.660> sure<00:00:48.690> that<00:00:48.900> the<00:00:49.170> how<00:00:49.530> we're

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
need to make sure that the how we're

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.320 
need to make sure that the how we're
holding<00:00:50.040> the<00:00:50.129> golf<00:00:50.340> club<00:00:50.610> is<00:00:50.730> correct<00:00:51.150> first

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330 
holding the golf club is correct first

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:53.660 
holding the golf club is correct first
so<00:00:51.660> some<00:00:52.500> people<00:00:52.650> who<00:00:52.979> may<00:00:53.100> have<00:00:53.250> a<00:00:53.280> strong

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
so some people who may have a strong

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.490 
so some people who may have a strong
hold<00:00:53.909> on<00:00:54.089> the<00:00:54.180> golf<00:00:54.360> club<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:55.110> means<00:00:55.379> that

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
hold on the golf club this means that

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.110 
hold on the golf club this means that
the<00:00:55.620> hands<00:00:55.830> are<00:00:56.010> too<00:00:56.250> far<00:00:56.489> round<00:00:56.729> to<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.089> right

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
the hands are too far round to the right

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.740 
the hands are too far round to the right
that<00:00:58.110> can<00:00:58.320> influence<00:00:58.850> this<00:00:59.850> hook<00:01:00.089> shot<00:01:00.330> so<00:01:00.600> we

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
that can influence this hook shot so we

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.119 
that can influence this hook shot so we
need<00:01:00.900> to<00:01:01.019> make<00:01:01.199> sure<00:01:01.229> that's<00:01:01.559> correct<00:01:01.860> first

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
need to make sure that's correct first

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.799 
need to make sure that's correct first
but<00:01:02.760> today<00:01:02.879> we're<00:01:03.059> going<00:01:03.150> to<00:01:03.239> talk<00:01:03.360> about<00:01:03.390> more

of the reasons why Matt we may hook it

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.250 
of the reasons why Matt we may hook it
with<00:01:07.740> the<00:01:08.100> with<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.430> golf<00:01:08.640> swing<00:01:08.760> so<00:01:09.140> first<00:01:10.140> of

out<00:01:22.260> there<00:01:22.530> don't<00:01:23.130> really<00:01:23.549> have<00:01:23.700> the<00:01:23.820> concept

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090

as we move the club away they're trying
to<00:01:34.410> keep<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.740> golf<00:01:34.980> club<00:01:35.220> square<00:01:36.090> or<00:01:36.300> pointing

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
to keep the golf club square or pointing

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.120 
to keep the golf club square or pointing
towards<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.230> target<00:01:37.470> so<00:01:37.710> they're<00:01:37.830> trying<00:01:38.100> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
towards the target so they're trying to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.700 
towards the target so they're trying to
keep<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.460> as<00:01:38.610> straight<00:01:38.700> as<00:01:39.180> possible<00:01:39.500> okay<00:01:40.500> now

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
keep it as straight as possible okay now

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.560 
keep it as straight as possible okay now
because<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.550> stand<00:01:41.790> at<00:01:41.940> the<00:01:42.000> side<00:01:42.180> of<00:01:42.330> the<00:01:42.390> golf

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
because we stand at the side of the golf

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
because we stand at the side of the golf
ball<00:01:42.630> the<00:01:43.350> golf<00:01:43.590> clubs<00:01:43.860> going<00:01:44.070> to<00:01:44.220> move<00:01:44.460> around

ball the golf clubs going to move around
on<00:01:45.060> an<00:01:45.150> arc<00:01:45.360> but<00:01:46.050> the<00:01:46.200> face<00:01:46.500> will<00:01:46.800> open<00:01:47.250> with

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
on an arc but the face will open with

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.640 
on an arc but the face will open with
that<00:01:47.730> so<00:01:48.180> as<00:01:48.300> you<00:01:48.420> can<00:01:48.540> see<00:01:48.750> here<00:01:49.080> as<00:01:49.200> I've

pointing towards the sky and there's

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.430 
pointing towards the sky and there's
somebody<00:01:54.060> who<00:01:54.150> tends<00:01:54.330> to<00:01:54.450> hook<00:01:54.810> the<00:01:54.990> golf<00:01:55.170> ball

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
pointing more over there okay so if

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.520 
pointing more over there okay so if

amount<00:03:06.490> so<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.750> difference<00:03:08.110> on<00:03:08.260> this<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.530> we

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:08.620 
amount so the difference on this is we

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:09.990 
amount so the difference on this is we
always<00:03:08.740> talk<00:03:09.010> about<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.280> feeling<00:03:09.700> the<00:03:09.790> real

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
always talk about the feeling the real

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.600 
always talk about the feeling the real
so<00:03:10.810> if<00:03:10.900> you're<00:03:11.020> someone<00:03:11.260> who<00:03:11.410> has<00:03:11.890> a<00:03:12.160> severe

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:12.610 
so if you're someone who has a severe

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:14.520 
so if you're someone who has a severe
hook<00:03:12.820> you're<00:03:13.000> going<00:03:13.240> to<00:03:13.390> need<00:03:13.930> to<00:03:14.080> feel<00:03:14.380> that

the way back guess what you're probably
not<00:03:42.610> doing<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:42.970> enough<00:03:43.180> so<00:03:43.840> I<00:03:43.870> want<00:03:44.080> you<00:03:44.140> to

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
not doing it enough so I want you to

not doing it enough so I want you to
work<00:03:44.470> at<00:03:44.740> this<00:03:44.890> point<00:03:45.220> here<00:03:45.520> from<00:03:45.790> from<00:03:46.420> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
work at this point here from from the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:48.600 
work at this point here from from the
golf<00:03:46.750> ball<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.140> waist<00:03:47.410> height<00:03:47.590> and<00:03:48.070> get<00:03:48.459> the

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:48.610 
golf ball to waist height and get the

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:50.730 
golf ball to waist height and get the
feeling<00:03:48.970> that<00:03:49.120> Club<00:03:49.600> is<00:03:49.810> turning<00:03:50.350> on<00:03:50.470> the<00:03:50.590> way

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:50.740 
feeling that Club is turning on the way

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.040 
feeling that Club is turning on the way
back<00:03:50.980> so<00:03:51.640> the<00:03:51.790> toe<00:03:52.030> is<00:03:52.180> pointing<00:03:52.600> to<00:03:52.720> the<00:03:52.810> sky

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:53.050 
back so the toe is pointing to the sky

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:55.020 
back so the toe is pointing to the sky
it's<00:03:53.709> much<00:03:53.980> easier<00:03:54.310> than<00:03:54.400> to<00:03:54.580> get<00:03:54.670> to<00:03:54.790> the<00:03:54.850> top

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
it's much easier than to get to the top

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:56.850 
it's much easier than to get to the top
of<00:03:55.060> the<00:03:55.240> backswing<00:03:55.660> and<00:03:55.900> have<00:03:56.410> a<00:03:56.440> square

00:03:59.280 --> 00:03:59.290 
clubface and make it much easier then to

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.690 
clubface and make it much easier then to
get<00:03:59.380> that<00:03:59.440> ball<00:03:59.680> starting<00:04:00.130> on<00:04:00.250> line<00:04:00.430> and
