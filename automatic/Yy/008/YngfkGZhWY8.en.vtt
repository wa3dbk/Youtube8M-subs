tremonti petromax 1dy listen to him I

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:21.220 
tremonti petromax 1dy listen to him I
already<00:03:19.790> know<00:03:20.090> what<00:03:20.269> his<00:03:20.420> solo<00:03:20.629> sound<00:03:20.930> electro

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
already know what his solo sound electro

00:03:21.230 --> 00:04:14.180 
already know what his solo sound electro
why<00:03:21.410> would<00:03:21.739> you<00:03:21.799> be<00:03:21.890> looking<00:03:21.950> at<00:03:22.190> you<00:03:22.970> wanted

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:18.080 

I<00:04:14.900> think<00:04:15.900> of<00:04:15.990> anything<00:04:16.260> else<00:04:16.410> of<00:04:17.090> importance

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
I think of anything else of importance

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.120 
I think of anything else of importance
we<00:04:18.959> don't<00:04:19.049> think<00:04:19.260> there<00:04:19.380> is<00:04:19.410> much<00:04:19.560> as<00:04:19.980> the

00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:20.130 
we don't think there is much as the

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.160 
we don't think there is much as the
boost<00:04:20.370> is<00:04:21.299> actually<00:04:21.780> something<00:04:21.989> of

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.170 
boost is actually something of

00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.840 
boost is actually something of
importance<00:04:22.590> just<00:04:22.740> pop<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.640> end<00:04:23.730> right<00:04:23.790> there

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:23.850 
importance just pop the end right there

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:28.220 
importance just pop the end right there
and<00:04:25.190> obviously<00:04:26.190> the<00:04:26.670> boost<00:04:26.940> kicks<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.780> when

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
and obviously the boost kicks in when

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.420 
and obviously the boost kicks in when
you're<00:04:28.350> throwing<00:04:28.440> around<00:04:28.620> i'm<00:04:29.070> sure<00:04:29.220> i<00:04:29.250> said

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:29.430 
you're throwing around i'm sure i said

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.840 
you're throwing around i'm sure i said
already<00:04:29.610> rogers<00:04:30.360> reiterate<00:04:30.810> i<00:04:31.730> usually<00:04:32.730> keep

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:32.850 
already rogers reiterate i usually keep

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.310 
already rogers reiterate i usually keep
it<00:04:32.970> around<00:04:33.150> quarter<00:04:33.510> because<00:04:33.900> gives<00:04:34.200> it<00:04:34.260> a

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
it around quarter because gives it a

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.190 
it around quarter because gives it a
nice<00:04:34.410> little<00:04:34.620> boost<00:04:35.430> you<00:04:35.700> can't<00:04:35.880> hear<00:04:36.200> from

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:37.200 
nice little boost you can't hear from

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.640 
nice little boost you can't hear from
variable<00:04:37.790> as<00:04:38.790> soon<00:04:39.030> as<00:04:39.120> you<00:04:39.180> turn<00:04:39.360> it<00:04:39.510> on<00:04:39.650> it's

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.650 
variable as soon as you turn it on it's

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:42.410 
variable as soon as you turn it on it's
nice<00:04:40.860> to<00:04:40.890> kind<00:04:41.070> of<00:04:41.160> oil<00:04:41.340> so<00:04:41.850> you<00:04:41.940> can<00:04:42.120> hear<00:04:42.300> the

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:42.420 
nice to kind of oil so you can hear the

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.150 
nice to kind of oil so you can hear the
noise<00:04:42.600> on<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:42.930> but<00:04:43.620> if<00:04:43.680> you<00:04:43.710> turn<00:04:43.920> it<00:04:43.950> way<00:04:44.130> up

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
noise on it but if you turn it way up

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.290 
noise on it but if you turn it way up
you'll<00:04:44.460> be<00:04:44.490> able<00:04:44.640> to<00:04:44.730> hear<00:04:44.820> is<00:04:44.940> nearly<00:04:45.090> lower

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
you'll be able to hear is nearly lower

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.120 
you'll be able to hear is nearly lower
than<00:04:45.510> me<00:04:45.630> talking<00:04:46.020> so<00:04:46.380> this<00:04:46.530> is<00:04:46.560> the<00:04:46.680> full<00:04:46.890> 20

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:47.130 
than me talking so this is the full 20

00:04:47.130 --> 00:05:01.730 
than me talking so this is the full 20
DB<00:04:47.550> okay<00:04:49.820> well<00:04:50.820> at<00:04:50.940> the<00:04:51.060> same<00:04:51.210> time

00:05:01.730 --> 00:05:01.740 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:17.950 

no<00:05:04.259> but<00:05:05.259> sometimes<00:05:05.440> letters<00:05:05.979> back

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:17.960 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:21.860 

it's<00:05:18.960> a<00:05:19.050> hot<00:05:19.229> one<00:05:20.090> it's<00:05:21.090> a<00:05:21.240> loud<00:05:21.449> while<00:05:21.720> when

you wanted to be put loud as good see
here's<00:05:26.940> you<00:05:27.090> have<00:05:27.240> around<00:05:27.539> halfway<00:05:27.990> up<00:05:28.320> which

00:05:28.460 --> 00:05:28.470 
here's you have around halfway up which

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.520 
here's you have around halfway up which
me<00:05:28.620> about<00:05:28.800> 10<00:05:29.009> decibels<00:05:30.169> give<00:05:31.169> that<00:05:31.320> nice<00:05:31.410> to

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:31.530 
me about 10 decibels give that nice to

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:51.440 
me about 10 decibels give that nice to
the<00:05:31.620> beach

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:57.240 

so<00:05:52.450> believe<00:05:52.750> is<00:05:53.110> we<00:05:53.260> are<00:05:54.120> like<00:05:55.120> subscribe<00:05:56.250> send
