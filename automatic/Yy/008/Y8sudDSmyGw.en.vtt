00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:34.850 

and<00:02:11.790> this<00:02:12.060> side<00:02:12.510> here

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.670 

the<00:02:35.490> best<00:02:35.790> part<00:02:36.300> I<00:02:36.780> was<00:02:36.990> thinking<00:02:37.200> about<00:02:37.380> my

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
the best part I was thinking about my

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.540 
the best part I was thinking about my
banana<00:02:38.070> clip<00:02:38.340> but<00:02:38.550> then<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.970> think<00:02:39.390> something

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.550 
banana clip but then I think something

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.190 
banana clip but then I think something
so<00:02:41.550> I'm<00:02:41.910> just<00:02:42.120> going<00:02:42.300> to<00:02:42.390> brush<00:02:42.600> this<00:02:42.780> up<00:02:42.990> like

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
so I'm just going to brush this up like

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.910 
so I'm just going to brush this up like
this

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:48.920 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:03:01.930 

and<00:02:49.920> then<00:02:50.219> pin<00:02:50.640> this<00:02:50.790> up<00:02:51.030> to

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.350 

and<00:03:02.360> I'm<00:03:02.660> probably<00:03:02.900> used<00:03:03.410> to<00:03:03.970> divide<00:03:04.970> expands

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
and I'm probably used to divide expands

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:14.270 
and I'm probably used to divide expands
in<00:03:05.660> the<00:03:05.750> back

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:17.770 

so<00:03:15.280> I<00:03:15.519> like<00:03:16.000> that

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
so I like that

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.809 
so I like that
and<00:03:18.260> then<00:03:18.410> let<00:03:18.709> me<00:03:18.800> just<00:03:19.040> fix<00:03:19.310> this<00:03:19.520> a<00:03:19.580> little

00:03:19.809 --> 00:03:19.819 
and then let me just fix this a little

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:23.770 
and then let me just fix this a little
bit<00:03:20.030> more

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:27.920

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
on the top just I'm going to loosely

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:37.940 
on the top just I'm going to loosely
take<00:03:31.830> my<00:03:32.190> curls<00:03:32.580> apart<00:03:33.920> very<00:03:34.920> little<00:03:36.860> like<00:03:37.860> I

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:37.950

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.500 

and<00:03:52.480> this<00:03:52.690> is<00:03:52.900> pretty<00:03:53.170> much<00:03:53.290> my<00:03:53.710> style

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:58.510 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:01.360 

what<00:03:59.510> do<00:03:59.600> you<00:03:59.630> think<00:04:00.100> something<00:04:01.100> it's<00:04:01.220> all
