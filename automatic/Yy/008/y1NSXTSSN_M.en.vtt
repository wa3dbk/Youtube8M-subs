00:00:00.019 --> 00:00:04.339
 this is a very cool thing if you knew that this one is a cookbook of the 

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:07.549
 Grandma's impossible to get lost in is a cookbook 

00:00:09.399 --> 00:00:14.279
 but it's a cookbook I'm not so unfortunately has no good vision 

00:00:14.279 --> 00:00:18.029
 go to study then I did not want 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.390
 how are you doing? 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.850
 it was a person who treated himself and in the kitchen 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.850
 a person with visual impairment 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:31.509
 I was doing 

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.390
 do after doing 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.500
 and I'm going to do this that I'm going to close today, for example, they would dedicate themselves 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:39.450
 So 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.480
 It is common sense to find out if we want to ask this question and 

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.800
 to be winning as a gift forward 

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.680

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.970
 we are facing the home of the visually impaired 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:59.020
 after being happy in the kitchen their team know and I keep thinking so 

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:00.999
 scared that I thought of that before 

00:01:00.999 --> 00:01:04.540
 but we can learn to do at our house, he pointed out 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.960
 the way 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.530
 the students who have two things in common are passionate about 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:20.640
 art of cooking and do not see me when you do not arrive they are not 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.500
 so sharp after you lose sight 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.210
 then the separation 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.210
 to use more of these or directions to the beach 

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.950
 this locomotion in the case of the time it came right in the door cooking for 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.540
 everything in the classes the guidelines range from the choice of ingredients to the time 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.650
 from purchase to preparation 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.240
 one of the most important explanations as embroidery foods 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.680
 to exemplify the proof of the role of potato on server day a knife here 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.140

 teresa portela as well as in good 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.790
 the decision of the supreme ah the course initiative is a group formed by 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.429
 women who also love to cook 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.790
 the classes are held in the squares of the volunteers 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:17.220
 after the theory time to put your hand in the dough it all starts with the washing of 

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:22.680
 some ingredients then each student accompanied by a helper peaks 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.630
 of gomes that will be used to make the fryer only in the class 

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:29.939
 and today he has learned little more 

00:02:29.939 --> 00:02:33.009
 I did not see it hanging on to any country that in person back 

00:02:33.699 --> 00:02:36.209
 everything ready at the time of serving 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:41.379
 a lot of people ran with eyes here at the moment are all the senses 

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:44.900
 here you are finding the center of wonder food 

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:48.099
 there is such a project 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:49.519
 between them 

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:50.980
 and now you do it at home 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:55.629
 It sure is a match that if the this incision if it stays 

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:58.629
 aiming to isolate themselves from independence 

00:03:00.089 --> 00:03:04.219
 1 of the steps that we need too we do not expect entities to 

00:03:04.219 --> 00:03:07.400
 each helen attendant with a new 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.789
 the truck and the mana 

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:13.699
 a new effective discovery on the network it seems evident that there are no more signs 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.809
 independent 

00:03:16.809 --> 00:03:17.339
