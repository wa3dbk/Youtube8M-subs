hook from the from post and you can feel
just<00:02:21.480> by<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.750> weight<00:02:21.989> these<00:02:22.500> are<00:02:22.560> pretty

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:22.829 
just by the weight these are pretty

00:02:22.829 --> 00:02:25.310 
just by the weight these are pretty
heavy<00:02:23.010> duty<00:02:23.190> units<00:02:23.840> whopper<00:02:24.840> gives<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.200> an

heavy duty units whopper gives you an

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:29.650 
heavy duty units whopper gives you an
access<00:02:25.739> hole<00:02:25.950> underneath<00:02:26.459> so<00:02:27.390> they<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.900> lift

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:29.660 
access hole underneath so they can lift

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.440 
access hole underneath so they can lift
push<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.870> pin<00:02:31.079> from<00:02:31.290> the<00:02:31.440> inside<00:02:31.890> and<00:02:32.420> then<00:02:33.420> a

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
push that pin from the inside and then a

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.720 
push that pin from the inside and then a
snap<00:02:33.810> ring<00:02:34.079> is<00:02:34.380> all<00:02:34.920> you<00:02:35.040> really<00:02:35.190> need<00:02:35.430> to<00:02:35.459> hold

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
about getting in behind it again so we

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:46.670 
about getting in behind it again so we
get<00:02:44.820> it<00:02:44.910> on<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.060> far<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:45.840> slide<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.500> rest

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
get it on that far and slide it the rest

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:50.180 
get it on that far and slide it the rest
of<00:02:46.859> the<00:02:46.920> way<00:02:47.180> until<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.299> hear<00:02:48.510> it<00:02:48.829> snap<00:02:49.829> in

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
of the way until we hear it snap in

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:56.710 
of the way until we hear it snap in
place

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.850 

keep<00:02:57.720> pushing<00:02:58.080> that<00:02:58.170> a<00:02:58.230> little<00:02:58.470> bit<00:02:58.590> at<00:02:58.740> a<00:02:58.770> time

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
keep pushing that a little bit at a time

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.350 
keep pushing that a little bit at a time
and<00:02:59.280> then<00:02:59.370> eventually<00:02:59.610> we'll<00:02:59.940> hear<00:03:00.120> it

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
and then eventually we'll hear it

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.290 
and then eventually we'll hear it
there<00:03:00.630> we<00:03:00.780> go<00:03:01.430> make<00:03:02.430> sure<00:03:02.460> it's<00:03:02.790> seated<00:03:03.030> all

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:03.300 
there we go make sure it's seated all

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.990 
there we go make sure it's seated all
the<00:03:03.330> way<00:03:03.420> around<00:03:04.250> and<00:03:05.250> that's<00:03:05.400> all<00:03:05.640> you<00:03:05.790> need

00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:06.000 
the way around and that's all you need

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.580 
the way around and that's all you need
you<00:03:06.270> don't<00:03:06.540> have<00:03:06.690> to<00:03:06.810> worry<00:03:06.990> about<00:03:07.050> this<00:03:07.410> being

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.590 
you don't have to worry about this being

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:08.960 
you don't have to worry about this being
just<00:03:07.800> a<00:03:07.890> thin<00:03:08.100> snap<00:03:08.400> ring<00:03:08.670> because

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
just a thin snap ring because

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.640 
just a thin snap ring because
essentially<00:03:09.510> any<00:03:09.660> time<00:03:09.900> you<00:03:10.050> ever<00:03:10.230> use<00:03:10.440> this

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
essentially any time you ever use this

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.890 
essentially any time you ever use this
it's<00:03:10.860> gonna<00:03:10.980> be<00:03:11.160> in<00:03:11.280> pull<00:03:11.490> mode<00:03:11.520> not<00:03:12.030> not<00:03:12.600> push

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
it's gonna be in pull mode not not push

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.570 
it's gonna be in pull mode not not push
so<00:03:13.260> that's<00:03:13.500> not<00:03:13.710> going<00:03:13.890> anywhere

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:14.580 
so that's not going anywhere

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.220 
so that's not going anywhere
what's<00:03:15.060> the<00:03:15.210> fact<00:03:15.420> is<00:03:15.600> once<00:03:15.750> you<00:03:15.900> put<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
what's the fact is once you put the

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.800 
what's the fact is once you put the
swivel<00:03:16.560> jack<00:03:16.860> back<00:03:17.160> or<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.460> hook<00:03:18.300> back<00:03:18.540> on

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
swivel jack back or the hook back on

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:33.949 
swivel jack back or the hook back on
it's<00:03:19.500> not<00:03:19.740> going<00:03:19.980> anywhere<00:03:21.470> all<00:03:22.470> this<00:03:32.959> now

00:03:33.949 --> 00:03:33.959 
it's not going anywhere all this now

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:38.480 
it's not going anywhere all this now
what<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.770> can<00:03:34.920> do<00:03:35.100> just<00:03:37.040> give<00:03:38.040> this<00:03:38.190> a<00:03:38.250> little

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:38.490 
what you can do just give this a little

00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:41.780 
what you can do just give this a little
bit<00:03:38.700> of<00:03:39.830> don't<00:03:40.830> even<00:03:41.070> have<00:03:41.220> to<00:03:41.310> be<00:03:41.430> really

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
bit of don't even have to be really

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:43.490 
bit of don't even have to be really
tight<00:03:42.090> we<00:03:42.390> just<00:03:42.600> need<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.930> just<00:03:43.080> get<00:03:43.230> it<00:03:43.380> so

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
tight we just need to just get it so

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.530 
tight we just need to just get it so
that<00:03:43.650> the<00:03:43.740> bolts<00:03:43.980> not<00:03:44.130> gonna<00:03:44.310> back<00:03:44.550> off<00:03:47.420> and<00:03:48.420> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
that the bolts not gonna back off and it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.750 
that the bolts not gonna back off and it
still<00:03:48.780> allows<00:03:49.050> you<00:03:49.260> to<00:03:49.410> swivel<00:03:50.220> that<00:03:50.459> shackle

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:50.760 
still allows you to swivel that shackle

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.490 
still allows you to swivel that shackle
you<00:03:51.120> can<00:03:51.270> see<00:03:51.480> you've<00:03:51.660> got<00:03:51.840> really<00:03:52.200> good

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
you can see you've got really good

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.710 
you can see you've got really good
versatility<00:03:53.340> on<00:03:53.490> it<00:03:53.670> pretty<00:03:54.150> much<00:03:54.330> put<00:03:54.600> this

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
versatility on it pretty much put this

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.530 
versatility on it pretty much put this
at<00:03:54.930> any<00:03:55.080> angle<00:03:55.550> going<00:03:56.550> down<00:03:56.820> the<00:03:56.940> road<00:03:57.120> if<00:03:57.390> you
