that's<00:02:52.420> good<00:02:52.629> news<00:02:52.810> because<00:02:53.590> well<00:02:54.160> I<00:02:54.400> don't

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:54.609 
that's good news because well I don't

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.580 
that's good news because well I don't
know<00:02:54.700> I<00:02:54.910> feel<00:02:55.390> like<00:02:55.540> raging<00:02:55.870> bus<00:02:56.019> to<00:02:56.230> at<00:02:56.379> really

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:56.590 
know I feel like raging bus to at really

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:58.259 
know I feel like raging bus to at really
good<00:02:56.739> character<00:02:57.069> models<00:02:57.370> but<00:02:57.579> that<00:02:58.030> can<00:02:58.180> be

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
good character models but that can be

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.640 
good character models but that can be
good<00:02:58.420> news<00:02:58.599> because<00:02:58.780> it's<00:02:59.079> possible<00:02:59.530> they

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
good news because it's possible they

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.770 
good news because it's possible they
could<00:02:59.709> do<00:02:59.890> it<00:02:59.920> better<00:03:00.129> I<00:03:00.220> guess<00:03:00.340> but<00:03:00.780> that

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
could do it better I guess but that

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.509 
could do it better I guess but that
could<00:03:01.989> also<00:03:02.109> be<00:03:02.260> bad<00:03:02.560> news<00:03:02.799> because<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.370> you've

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
could also be bad news because if you've

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:04.830 
could also be bad news because if you've
got<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.730> start<00:03:03.940> from<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.150> ground<00:03:04.180> up<00:03:04.510> that's<00:03:04.750> a

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
got to start from the ground up that's a

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:07.860 
got to start from the ground up that's a
lot<00:03:04.989> of<00:03:05.109> work<00:03:05.260> that<00:03:06.239> didn't<00:03:07.239> have<00:03:07.450> to<00:03:07.630> go<00:03:07.720> in

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:07.870 
lot of work that didn't have to go in

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.330 
lot of work that didn't have to go in
there<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.440> if<00:03:08.560> they<00:03:08.650> could<00:03:08.829> have<00:03:08.950> ported<00:03:09.310> from

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
there but if they could have ported from

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:10.680 
there but if they could have ported from
raging<00:03:09.670> blast<00:03:09.880> 2<00:03:10.030> if<00:03:10.209> I<00:03:10.269> understand<00:03:10.540> what<00:03:10.569> I'm

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
raging blast 2 if I understand what I'm

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.089 
raging blast 2 if I understand what I'm
saying<00:03:10.930> because<00:03:11.440> instead<00:03:11.769> of<00:03:11.829> making

00:03:12.089 --> 00:03:12.099 
saying because instead of making

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:13.229 
saying because instead of making
everything<00:03:12.310> new<00:03:12.430> again<00:03:12.819> if<00:03:12.940> they<00:03:13.060> would<00:03:13.209> have

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239 
everything new again if they would have

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.819 
everything new again if they would have
ported<00:03:13.599> it<00:03:13.720> over<00:03:13.989> that<00:03:14.500> would<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.709> saved

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:14.829 
ported it over that would have saved

00:03:14.829 --> 00:03:17.610 
ported it over that would have saved
them<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.040> lot<00:03:15.190> of<00:03:15.280> time<00:03:15.459> but<00:03:15.849> I<00:03:16.319> don't<00:03:17.319> know<00:03:17.410> if

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:17.620 
them a lot of time but I don't know if

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:19.530 
them a lot of time but I don't know if
like<00:03:18.310> obviously<00:03:18.730> that<00:03:18.910> time<00:03:19.120> could<00:03:19.329> have<00:03:19.450> been

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
like obviously that time could have been

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.120 
like obviously that time could have been
spent<00:03:19.810> doing<00:03:19.930> other<00:03:20.349> things<00:03:20.440> had<00:03:20.980> they<00:03:21.099> been

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
spent doing other things had they been

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:23.699 
spent doing other things had they been
able<00:03:21.340> to<00:03:21.459> port<00:03:21.730> but<00:03:22.000> just<00:03:22.329> because<00:03:22.450> I<00:03:22.930> don't

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
able to port but just because I don't

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.900 
able to port but just because I don't
know<00:03:23.739> newer<00:03:23.980> could<00:03:24.280> be<00:03:24.400> better<00:03:24.579> you<00:03:24.730> never

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:24.910

time<00:04:11.220> you<00:04:11.340> had<00:04:11.459> to<00:04:11.549> work<00:04:11.670> on<00:04:11.819> this<00:04:11.940> game

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
time you had to work on this game

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.280 
time you had to work on this game
because<00:04:12.269> been<00:04:12.569> a<00:04:12.599> while<00:04:12.780> since<00:04:12.930> we've<00:04:13.110> gotten

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.290 
because been a while since we've gotten

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.470 
because been a while since we've gotten
one<00:04:13.580> but<00:04:14.580> yeah<00:04:14.700> they<00:04:14.849> said<00:04:15.030> they're<00:04:15.150> not<00:04:15.180> sure

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
one but yeah they said they're not sure

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:17.599 
one but yeah they said they're not sure
on<00:04:15.720> GT<00:04:16.169> characters<00:04:16.590> and<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.340> I<00:04:17.579> mean

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
on GT characters and to that I mean

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:19.280 
on GT characters and to that I mean
maybe<00:04:18.060> it's<00:04:18.269> possible<00:04:18.479> to<00:04:18.840> end<00:04:18.989> up<00:04:19.079> in<00:04:19.169> the

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:19.290 
maybe it's possible to end up in the

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:20.780 
maybe it's possible to end up in the
final<00:04:19.440> release<00:04:19.769> of<00:04:19.919> the<00:04:19.979> game<00:04:20.010> but<00:04:20.459> if<00:04:20.549> I<00:04:20.669> had

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
final release of the game but if I had

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.009 
final release of the game but if I had
to<00:04:20.820> guess<00:04:21.030> I'd<00:04:21.299> say<00:04:21.329> that's<00:04:21.570> gonna<00:04:21.750> be<00:04:21.900> some

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:22.019 
to guess I'd say that's gonna be some

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:23.420 
to guess I'd say that's gonna be some
kind<00:04:22.199> of<00:04:22.229> downloaded<00:04:22.680> content<00:04:22.830> you<00:04:23.160> can<00:04:23.250> get

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
kind of downloaded content you can get

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:25.129 
kind of downloaded content you can get
which<00:04:24.000> I<00:04:24.120> went<00:04:24.300> in<00:04:24.360> mind<00:04:24.510> I'd<00:04:24.660> fork<00:04:24.870> over<00:04:25.080> a

00:04:25.129 --> 00:04:25.139 
which I went in mind I'd fork over a

00:04:25.139 --> 00:04:26.570 
which I went in mind I'd fork over a
couple<00:04:25.380> extra<00:04:25.590> bucks<00:04:25.620> if<00:04:25.919> I<00:04:25.949> go<00:04:26.130> super<00:04:26.430> saiyan

00:04:26.570 --> 00:04:26.580 
couple extra bucks if I go super saiyan

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.870 
couple extra bucks if I go super saiyan
4<00:04:26.850> goku<00:04:27.060> or<00:04:27.360> anything<00:04:27.630> like<00:04:27.660> that<00:04:27.780> so<00:04:28.580> yeah<00:04:29.580> GT

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
4 goku or anything like that so yeah GT

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.430 
4 goku or anything like that so yeah GT
characters<00:04:30.240> to<00:04:30.419> be<00:04:30.540> determined<00:04:30.750> possible

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:31.440 
characters to be determined possible

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.620 
characters to be determined possible
regular<00:04:32.040> Dragonball<00:04:32.490> characters<00:04:32.910> but<00:04:33.090> that

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:33.630 
regular Dragonball characters but that

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:35.360 
regular Dragonball characters but that
wasn't<00:04:33.990> as<00:04:34.080> highly<00:04:34.320> requested<00:04:34.530> so<00:04:34.979> no<00:04:35.160> that

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.370 
wasn't as highly requested so no that

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:38.689 
wasn't as highly requested so no that
would<00:04:35.490> actually<00:04:35.610> be<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.880> thing<00:04:36.090> on<00:04:36.300> um<00:04:37.490> this<00:04:38.490> is

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:38.699 
would actually be a thing on um this is

00:04:38.699 --> 00:04:41.360 
would actually be a thing on um this is
not<00:04:38.990> dragon<00:04:39.990> ball<00:04:40.139> raging<00:04:40.169> blast<00:04:40.530> 3<00:04:40.979> they

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
not dragon ball raging blast 3 they

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:42.620 
not dragon ball raging blast 3 they
talked<00:04:41.639> about<00:04:41.729> that<00:04:42.030> in<00:04:42.060> the<00:04:42.210> interview<00:04:42.449> I

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:42.630 
talked about that in the interview I

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:44.240 
talked about that in the interview I
guess<00:04:42.960> it<00:04:43.110> was<00:04:43.199> asked<00:04:43.500> this<00:04:43.590> is<00:04:43.740> not<00:04:43.889> in<00:04:44.070> any

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
guess it was asked this is not in any

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.040 
guess it was asked this is not in any
relation<00:04:44.729> that<00:04:44.850> at<00:04:44.970> all<00:04:45.060> although<00:04:45.600> it<00:04:45.900> was<00:04:46.020> a

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050 
relation that at all although it was a

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.870 
relation that at all although it was a
new<00:04:46.229> developer<00:04:46.710> they<00:04:46.949> might<00:04:47.190> pick<00:04:47.460> up<00:04:47.639> on<00:04:47.850> a

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
new developer they might pick up on a

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.580 
new developer they might pick up on a
dragon<00:04:48.150> ball<00:04:48.389> raging<00:04:48.419> blast<00:04:48.720> 3<00:04:49.110> later<00:04:49.350> maybe

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:49.590 
dragon ball raging blast 3 later maybe

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:50.990 
dragon ball raging blast 3 later maybe
that<00:04:49.860> wasn't<00:04:50.039> really<00:04:50.220> hinted<00:04:50.550> at<00:04:50.639> that's<00:04:50.820> me

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:51.000 
that wasn't really hinted at that's me

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.659 
that wasn't really hinted at that's me
guessing<00:04:51.240> but<00:04:51.720> this<00:04:52.680> is<00:04:52.800> not<00:04:52.949> in<00:04:53.160> any<00:04:53.280> way<00:04:53.370> a

00:04:53.659 --> 00:04:53.669 
guessing but this is not in any way a

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.310 
guessing but this is not in any way a

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
three missions to start out in the demo

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.190 
three missions to start out in the demo
that<00:05:33.180> they<00:05:33.389> could<00:05:33.599> have<00:05:33.690> played<00:05:33.900> they<00:05:34.020> only

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
that they could have played they only

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.719 
that they could have played they only
chose<00:05:34.440> one<00:05:34.650> of<00:05:34.770> them<00:05:34.889> one<00:05:35.430> of<00:05:35.460> the<00:05:35.580> missions

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:35.729 
chose one of them one of the missions

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:38.240 
chose one of them one of the missions
was<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.210> was<00:05:36.360> napa<00:05:36.630> and<00:05:36.900> three<00:05:37.500> schreibman<00:05:37.950> you

was it was napa and three schreibman you

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:39.620 
was it was napa and three schreibman you
could<00:05:38.400> be<00:05:38.520> fighting<00:05:38.849> with<00:05:38.940> your<00:05:39.090> team<00:05:39.270> of<00:05:39.389> four

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:39.630 
could be fighting with your team of four

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:40.700 
could be fighting with your team of four
because<00:05:39.840> again<00:05:40.050> that's<00:05:40.169> what<00:05:40.349> this<00:05:40.470> game<00:05:40.680> is

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
because again that's what this game is

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.589 
because again that's what this game is
you<00:05:41.070> picked<00:05:41.190> him<00:05:41.370> to<00:05:41.520> force<00:05:41.789> it<00:05:41.970> was<00:05:42.060> napa<00:05:42.270> 3

you picked him to force it was napa 3

00:05:42.599 --> 00:05:44.779 
you picked him to force it was napa 3
shadman<00:05:43.050> then<00:05:43.560> it<00:05:43.680> was<00:05:43.800> just<00:05:43.830> vegeta<00:05:44.460> which<00:05:44.669> is

00:05:44.779 --> 00:05:44.789

gohan and someone else maybe piccolo

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:53.689 
gohan and someone else maybe piccolo
fighting<00:05:50.699> Vegeta<00:05:51.060> in<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:52.229> demo<00:05:52.560> and<00:05:53.400> that's

00:05:53.689 --> 00:05:53.699 
fighting Vegeta in the demo and that's

00:05:53.699 --> 00:05:54.890 
fighting Vegeta in the demo and that's
what<00:05:53.849> they<00:05:53.970> played<00:05:54.180> for<00:05:54.419> us<00:05:54.449> and<00:05:54.720> then<00:05:54.810> the

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:54.900 
what they played for us and then the

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:56.689 
what they played for us and then the
third<00:05:55.050> option<00:05:55.289> was<00:05:55.650> like<00:05:55.770> the<00:05:55.889> ginyu<00:05:56.220> force<00:05:56.250> I

00:05:56.689 --> 00:05:56.699 
third option was like the ginyu force I

00:05:56.699 --> 00:05:58.189 
third option was like the ginyu force I
saw<00:05:56.940> a<00:05:56.970> glimpse<00:05:57.240> of<00:05:57.360> the<00:05:57.449> ginyu<00:05:57.720> force<00:05:57.750> it<00:05:58.080> was

00:05:58.189 --> 00:05:58.199 
saw a glimpse of the ginyu force it was

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.719 
saw a glimpse of the ginyu force it was
only<00:05:58.320> on<00:05:58.410> the<00:05:58.530> screen<00:05:58.830> briefly<00:05:59.130> but<00:05:59.340> that<00:05:59.520> and

00:05:59.719 --> 00:05:59.729 
only on the screen briefly but that and

00:05:59.729 --> 00:06:01.159 
only on the screen briefly but that and
I<00:06:00.270> feel<00:06:00.449> like<00:06:00.539> they're<00:06:00.720> moving<00:06:00.900> along<00:06:01.110> pretty

00:06:01.159 --> 00:06:01.169 
I feel like they're moving along pretty

00:06:01.169 --> 00:06:03.080 
I feel like they're moving along pretty
fast<00:06:01.710> to<00:06:01.979> be<00:06:02.010> jumping<00:06:02.400> already<00:06:02.669> to<00:06:02.760> ginyu

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:03.090 
fast to be jumping already to ginyu

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:05.750 
fast to be jumping already to ginyu
force<00:06:03.260> so<00:06:04.260> I'm<00:06:04.500> predicting<00:06:05.130> it's<00:06:05.400> either

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
force so I'm predicting it's either

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.400 
force so I'm predicting it's either
going<00:06:06.030> to<00:06:06.150> be<00:06:06.240> very<00:06:06.510> little<00:06:06.780> story<00:06:07.139> mode<00:06:07.320> at

00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:41.820 
look forward to at least also I saw

00:06:41.820 --> 00:06:43.760 
look forward to at least also I saw
ultimate<00:06:42.300> gohan<00:06:42.510> in<00:06:42.900> one<00:06:43.290> of<00:06:43.320> the<00:06:43.440> opening

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
ultimate gohan in one of the opening

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.900 
ultimate gohan in one of the opening
title<00:06:44.040> screens<00:06:44.310> as<00:06:44.430> they<00:06:44.520> were<00:06:44.580> flipping

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:44.910 
title screens as they were flipping

00:06:44.910 --> 00:06:47.210 
title screens as they were flipping
through<00:06:45.060> the<00:06:45.090> demo<00:06:45.450> which<00:06:45.840> so<00:06:46.350> we've<00:06:46.500> seen<00:06:46.740> the

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:47.220 
through the demo which so we've seen the

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.070 
through the demo which so we've seen the
the<00:06:47.460> Saiyans<00:06:47.790> series<00:06:48.570> we've<00:06:48.750> seen<00:06:48.780> the

00:06:49.070 --> 00:06:49.080 
the Saiyans series we've seen the

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.540 
the Saiyans series we've seen the
freezer<00:06:49.350> series<00:06:49.710> in<00:06:49.830> there<00:06:50.010> in<00:06:50.160> other

00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:50.550 
freezer series in there in other

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:52.250 
freezer series in there in other
trailers<00:06:51.180> and<00:06:51.330> stuff<00:06:51.390> so<00:06:51.660> I'm<00:06:51.750> guessing<00:06:51.960> it's

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140 
yeah that's about all I got they were

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.010 
yeah that's about all I got they were
talking<00:07:07.410> about<00:07:07.620> some<00:07:07.920> BGM<00:07:08.490> music<00:07:08.850> in<00:07:09.840> the

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:10.020 
talking about some BGM music in the

00:07:10.020 --> 00:07:11.300 
talking about some BGM music in the
interview<00:07:10.350> that<00:07:10.380> I<00:07:10.500> didn't<00:07:10.770> fully<00:07:10.920> understand

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:14.060 
interview that I didn't fully understand

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:15.560 
I guess they'd used some kickass music
for<00:07:14.220> Japan<00:07:14.490> before<00:07:14.700> that<00:07:15.150> they<00:07:15.270> didn't
